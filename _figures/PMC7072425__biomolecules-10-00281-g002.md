caption: ABA biosynthesis, transport, and signaling. (A) ABA biosynthesis. ABA biosynthesis
  begins with isoprenoids derived from the plastidic methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate
  (MEP) pathway, ultimately leading to the carotenoid zeaxanthin. Zeaxanthin then
  feeds into the ABA biosynthetic pathway. (B) ABA transport. Direction of ABA transport
  for each of the transporters is indicated by the arrow through the transporter.
  ABCG22 is listed with a question mark due to it currently not being directly shown
  to transport ABA but was included due to evidence suggesting that it is involved
  in ABA transport. Similarly, multiple NRT1/PTR (NPF) family transporters are simply
  designated as “NPFs?” due to their current standing as possibly involved, but no
  direct evidence with the exception of NRT1.2 (also known as NPF4.6) has been provided
  for their involvement in ABA transport. (C) ABA signaling. In the absence of ABA
  (top), the PP2C protein phosphatases interact with and represses the SnRK2 kinases
  through dephosphorylation. However, in the presence of ABA (bottom), PYR/PYL/RCAR
  ABA receptors inhibit the PP2Cs, relieving SnRK2 kinases from repression. This leads
  to SnRK2 phosphorylation and activation, allowing SnRK2s to phosphorylate downstream
  targets such as the ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) transcription factors.
