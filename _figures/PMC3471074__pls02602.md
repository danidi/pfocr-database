caption: Schematic representation of the effects of cytokinins on plant architecture
  in Arabidopsis and rice. (A) Cytokinins induce growth of the shoot apical meristem
  (SAM) in a pathway that is parallel to WUSCHEL (WUS)-induced SAM growth. The meristem
  regulators KNAT2 and STM positively regulate cytokinin-mediated SAM growth by inducing
  cytokinin biosynthesis via IPT gene expression, and by repressing negative regulators
  of cytokinin signalling, type-A ARRs. LONELY GUY (LOG) converts cytokinins to their
  active forms, and thus plays a positive role in SAM growth as well. (B) Cytokinins
  induce axillary bud outgrowth, leading to more bushy phenotypes, an effect that
  is counteracted by the cytokinin-degrading enzymes of the CKX family. (C) They repress
  root growth via effects on auxin action, both by repressing auxin transport (PIN
  proteins) and by inducing SHY2/IAA3, a negative regulator of auxin signalling. Arrows
  indicate an induction or activation (positive effect); diamonds suggest inhibition
  or repression (negative effect). This model is based on current knowledge obtained
  mainly from work on Arabidopsis and rice.
