caption: Sensitization to allergens and development of allergic responses. The sensitization
  pathway starts when an Antigen Presenting cell (APC) recognizes and processes an
  environmental protein as potentially dangerous, such as inhalants allergens (pollen,
  animal dander, house dust mites), or food proteins. This phase is known as sensitization.
  During allergen sensitization, naïve T cells are primed into CD4+ T helper type
  2 T cells, producing Th2 cytokines as IL4 and IL-13, which are responsible of class
  switching to the IgE production by B cells. IgE will bind to the surface mast cells
  and basophils IgE receptor. Upon the next encounter with the allergen, the protein
  will crosslink 2 IgE molecules starting a signaling cascade that causing mast cells
  and basophils degranulation, releasing preformed mediators (histamine, proteases,
  prostaglandins, thromboxanes) constituting the early-phase response. In addition,
  mast cells and basophils also produce cytokines and chemokines that recruit inflammatory
  cells to the site (late-phase). This immune response type 2 (Th2) immunity is counterbalanced
  by Type 1 (Th1) immunity and T regulatory cells.
