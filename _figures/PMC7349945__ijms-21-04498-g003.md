caption: 'An overview of the regulation mechanisms of CIN-like TCP transcription factors
  during leaf development. The external stimuli and internal factors are summarized
  at the left column. The schematic diagram includes the regulation mechanisms of
  CIN-like TCPs at the transcriptional level, at the post-transcriptional level, and
  at the protein level. The arrows directly pointing on the double helix symbols indicate
  transcriptional regulations. The arrows pointing to the proteins indicate the regulations
  of protein stabilities or antagonistic functions. The proteins related with the
  “26S” symbols indicate protein degradation through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome
  pathway. The blue arrows represent the positive regulation, and the red arrows with
  dash-headed ends indicate the negative regulation. The green arrows and red dash-headed
  ends at the double-helix icons indicates the activation and repression of gene expression,
  respectively. All the unknown factors are indicated with question marks. R:FR, red
