number: FIG. 1
caption: Incretin-induced cAMP signaling in the pancreatic β-cell. Incretins interact
  with G protein–coupled receptors at the cell membrane to stimulate production of
  cAMP from ATP. Subsequently, cAMP is thought to signal via PKA-dependent or PKA-independent
  pathways. The PKA-dependent pathway (left side of the figure) results in the phosphorylation
  of proteins such as Snapin, which activate the exocytosis machinery to cause fusion
  of insulin granules from a readily releasable pool. The PKA-independent pathway
  (right side of the figure) involves interactions between Epac2 and Rap1, which regulate
  the size of the readily releasable pool of insulin granules. The figure emphasizes
  the involvement of the PKA-dependent pathway in the stimulation of insulin release,
  as reflected by the studies of Kaihara et al. The figure also shows the potential
  interactions between the two major cAMP-signaling pathways (dotted arrow), wherein
  direct interactions between Snapin and Epac2 may be important for insulin release.
  AC, adenylyl cyclase; Gs, stimulative regulatory G protein.
