caption: 'Shown is a graphical model. Left: at baseline, TRBP undergoes polyubiquitination
  and degradation facilitated by Merlin protein. Lin28a protein levels are negligible
  as it undergoes rapid turnover. Right: growth factor binding to cognate receptors
  activates Erk1/2 signaling and subsequent TRBP phosphorylation, which stabilizes
  TRBP and enhances the TRBP/Lin28a protein complex, elevating Lin28a protein levels.
  Downstream inhibition of Let-7 miRNAs facilitates protein synthesis from pro-growth
  mRNAs. Bottom: The rapid Erk1/2-dependent induction pathway exerts Lin28a-dependent
  trophic effects on neuronal spines and peritoneal macrophage survival.'
