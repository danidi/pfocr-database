caption: Hypothesized mechanisms through which sigma (σ) receptors elicit neuroprotective
  and/or neurorestorative effects. Injury and/or inflammation in the CNS may stimulate
  an excessive and sustained glutamate release, which leads to abnormal increases
  in intracellular calcium levels and the generation of ROS/RNS. Subsequently, a disruption
  of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and activation of mitochondrial death cascade pathways
  and ER stress can contribute to cell damage and/or death. Moreover, the activation
  of microglia and astrocytes in response to injury and/or inflammation can amplify
  neuronal processes that contribute to neurotoxicity. σ Receptors can intervene at
  a number of points in this process, including attenuating glutamate release and
  NMDA receptor activity, mitochondria death pathway and ER stress activation, ROS/RNS
  production and reactive gliosis while promoting the expression of anti-apoptotic
  factors (e.g., bcl-2) and calcium homeostasis. ER; endoplasmic reticulum; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; NOS, nitric oxygen synthase; NMDA,
  N-methyl-D-aspartate; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein.
