caption: Working model of trafficking of L1 fragments to nucleus upon stimulation
  of L1 signaling. Stimulation of L1 signaling triggers attachment of one SUMO molecule
  to the full-length 200-kDa L1 (step 1). Extracellular serine protease-dependent
  cleavage of the sumoylated L1 results in the generation of a soluble extracellular
  135-kDa fragment and a transmembrane 70-kDa fragment containing the intracellular
  domain and part of the extracellular domain (step 2). The 70-kDa fragment is internalized
  by endocytosis (step 3) and translocated to endosomal compartments (step 4) from
  where it is transferred to the ER (step 5). In late endosomes/MVBs, the 70-kDa fragment
  is packed into intraluminal vesicles (step 6), and after fusion of MVBs with the
  plasma membrane (step 7), the fragments are released into the extracellular space
  in association with exosomes (step 8). Through ESCRT-III-associated proteins CHMP1,
  Alix, and Vps4, the 70-kDa fragment is translocated from the endosomal membrane
  to the cytoplasm (step 9) followed by import through nuclear pores into the nucleus
  in association with CHMP1 and in an importin-dependent pathway (step 10). In the
  nucleus, the 70-kDa fragment may associate with nucleoplasmic proteins or interact
  with DNA or chromatin-associated proteins (step 11).
