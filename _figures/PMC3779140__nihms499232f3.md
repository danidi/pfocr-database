caption: 'DNA damage tolerance pathway (DDT): lesions (yellow Square) in the DNA template
  blocks progression of high-fidelity replicative polymerase resulting in stalled
  replication forks. DNA damage tolerance mechanism mediates bypass of lesions by
  replicating over damaged DNA by low-fidelity DNA polymerases (translesion synthesis)
  or using the undamaged sister chromatid as a template (template switching). Template
  switching is mediated by structural rearrangement of the replication fork either
  by recombination or fork reversal. The key regulator of DDT pathway is the modification
  of PCNA. Under undamaged conditions replicative polymerase binds to unmodified PCNA
  during DNA replication. Upon genotoxic stress, PCNA is ubiquitinated at K164 to
  initiate DNA damage tolerance pathways. Monoubiquitination of PCNA promotes translesion
  synthesis, while polyubiquitination facilitates template switching. PCNA is monoubiquitinated
  by RAD18-RAD6 E3-ligase and polyubiquitinated by Rad5 (human homologue, SHPRH or
  HLTF). Following lesion bypass Usp1 deubiquitinates PCNA, thereby facilitating loading
  of the replicative polymerase to resume DNA synthesis'
