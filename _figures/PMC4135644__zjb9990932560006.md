caption: The l-lysine degradation pathway in HD73. l-Lysine is converted to β-lysine
  by a lysine-2,3-aminomutase (KamA) that is subsequently acetylated to Nε-acetyl-β-lysine
  by the action of an acetyltransferase (YodP); Nε-acetyl-l-β-lysine is deaminated
  to 3-keto-6-acetamidohexanoate by an Nε-acetyl-β-lysine transaminase (YodT) in the
  presence of 2-ketoglutarate. The conversion of 3-keto-6-acetamidohexanoate and acetyl-CoA
  to 4-acetamidobutyryl-CoA and acetoacetate is catalyzed by a 3-keto-6-acetamidohexanoate
  cleavage enzyme (YodS and YodR); 4-acetamidobutyryl-CoA deacetylase (YodQ) converts
  4-acetamidobutyryl-CoA to 4-aminobutyrate. 4-Aminobutyrate is readily converted
  via succinic semialdehyde to succinate, which is called GABA shunt. The succinate
  product will enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The encoding genes are annotated
  in parentheses, and the dashed arrows marked the genes controlled by σ54.
