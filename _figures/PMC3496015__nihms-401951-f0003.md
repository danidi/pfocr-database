caption: Estradiol membrane signaling induces spinogenesis in the ARH. (A) During
  low estradiol conditions, as during diestrus, ARH neurons have a population of mature
  spines. The ERα-mGluR1a signaling complex is not stimulated. (B) Estradiol induces
  the formation of thin, filapodial spines by stimulating the ERα-mGluR1a signaling
  complex leading to activation of PKC and LIM kinase and the phosphorylation of cofilin.
  The deactivation of cofilin allows new spines to grow. EMS stimulates gene expression
  through the activation of the MAPK pathway leading to CREB-mediated transcription.
  (C) With time, mushroom-shaped spines appear in the ARH. These spines are thought
  to be functional and stable. The time course of their appearance coincides with
  the display of lordosis behavior in the female rat, starting at 20 hours after estradiol
  treatment. Whether the necessary gene transcription for spine maturation is regulated
  by membrane to nucleus signaling (B) or the result of direct nuclear action (C)
  is being investigated. Some immature spines are eliminated (C). In the ARH, the
  mechanism of this degeneration is not clear, but is probably due to a failure to
  associate with a presynaptic element, which stabilizes the spine.
