caption: Schema depicting the Peli1-mediated pathway following SAH. TLR4 signaling
  is initiated by SAH stimuli. Increased Peli1 after SAH positively regulates MyD88-dependent
  TLR4 signaling via cIAP1/2 activation. Upregulated cIAP1/2 facilitates phosphorylation
  of MAPK signaling pathway and activates pro-apoptotic pathway. These combined effects
  promotes microglia polarization into the M1 phenotype, sequentially releasing destructive
  pro-inflammatory cytokines to amplify the inflammatory response in the central nervous
  system (CNS). Suppression of Peli1 by Peli1-shRNA lentivirus impairs the induction
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
