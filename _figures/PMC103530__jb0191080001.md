caption: Pathway for the metabolism of GlcNAc and proposed pathway for the degradation
  of ManNAc and NANA (sialic acid). GlcNAc is transported by both the manXYZ-encoded
  transporter and its own specific transporter, encoded by nagE, producing intracellular
  GlcNAc-6-P, which is degraded by the nagA- and nagB-encoded enzymes. The biosynthetic
  pathway producing UDP-GlcNAc for incorporation into cell wall components involves
  the glmS, glmM, and glmU gene products. ManNAc is taken up by the manXYZ transporter,
  producing intracellular ManNAc-6-P. NANA is taken up as the free sugar by a sugar-cation
  symporter encoded by nanT. Inside the cell, NANA is cleaved by the aldolase encoded
  by nanA to give ManNAc and pyruvate. The results of this study allow us to propose
  that intracellular ManNAc is phosphorylated to ManNAc-6-P, which is subsequently
  converted to GlcNAc-6-P, the substrate of the nagA-encoded deacetylase. Thus, the
  pathways for degradation of NANA, ManNAc, and GlcNAc converge at the level of GlcNAc-6-P.
