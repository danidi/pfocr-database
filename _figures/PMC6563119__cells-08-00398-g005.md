caption: Dual functions of the cancer cell-intrinsic Hippo pathway in immune modulation.
  (Left) Immunnostimulatory effects mediated by YAP activation or LATS1/2 inactivation.
  In cancer cells, YAP inhibits IFNγ-inducible PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand-1, also
  known as CD274) expression partially through miR-130a-mediated suppression of IRF1.
  IRF1 up-regulates the expression of PD-L1 that binds to PD-1 (programmed cell death
  1, also known as PDCD1) on T cells and provides inhibitory signals to cytotoxic
  T cells (CTL). Upon deletion of LATS1/2, extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from
  cancer cells trigger an anti-cancer immune response by stimulating the host nucleic-acid-sensing
  pathway and enhancing antigen cross-presentation. (Right) Immunosuppressive effects
  mediated by YAP activation. Active YAP induces the expression of PD-L1, as well
  as cytokines [TNFα (tumor necrosis factor alpha), CSF1 (colony stimulating factor
  1)] and chemokine ligands [CXCL1 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1), CXCL2, CXCL5,
  and CCL2 (C-C motif chemokine 2)]. Those cytokines or chemokines recruit immunosuppressive
  cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and M2-type macrophages,
  to inhibit CTL functions.
