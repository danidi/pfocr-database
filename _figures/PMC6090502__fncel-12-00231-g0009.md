caption: Model for NG2 ICD-mediated intracellular signaling in OPCs. (A) We propose
  the signaling pathway shown for OPCs, based on our previous NG2 cleavage study (Sakry
  et al., ; Sakry and Trotter, ) and the present NG2 ICD overexpression and NG2 knock-down
  study (highlighted in part B). The mTOR pathway shown has been suggested by Bhattacharya
  et al. () for neurons (without NG2 signaling). In OPCs, NG2 full-length (FL) protein
  undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) leading to the release of an
  ectodomain into the extracellular matrix (ECM) and generation of a c-terminal fragment
  (CTF) by α-secretase activity. γ-secretase activity on the NG2 CTF releases the
  NG2 intracellular domain (ICD) into the cytoplasm. This NG2 cleavage occurs constitutively
  in OPCs and can be increased by neuronal activity (Sakry et al., ). Under normal
  conditions, FMRP, which is a translation repressor and target of the mTOR-S6K1 signaling
  cascade, binds to eEF2 on ribosomal subunits and stalls translation, as suggested
  for neurons (Bhattacharya et al., ). (B) Increased NG2 cleavage generates an increased
  amount of NG2 ICD by γ-secretase activity. NG2 ICD overexpression mimics an increase
  in products of intracellular NG2 cleavage, elevating levels of phosphorylated (active)
  p-mTOR/p-S6K1/p-eIF4B, all known downstream components of the mTORC1 signal cascade,
  and thus indicating an increase in p-eIF4B dependent translation initiation. P-S6K1
  phosphorylates and inactivates eEF2K leading to increased levels of active eEF2
  protein favoring translation elongation. Increasing levels of NG2 ICD resulted in
  a higher levels of eEF2 and a reduction of FMRP protein, leading to a reduction
  of stalled FMRP-eEF2 complexes and relieving translation inhibition. These combined
  effects on the signaling cascade favor the observed mTORC1-dependent increase of
  overall translation in OPCs (Figures ) after ICD overexpression. A reduction of
  NG2 protein level in primary OPCs leads to a reduction of the total translation
  rate (Figures ).
