caption: 'Functional role of deubiquitinating enzymes in autophagy. An overview of
  the involvement of deubiquitinases in different steps of the autophagy pathway.
  In general, the stimuli that elicit autophagy induction can be integrated by certain
  signaling cascades. This results in the formation of the pre-autophagosomal structure
  (PAS), which is a newly-formed membrane that surrounds the potential cargo, like
  cytosolic components, protein aggregates or damaged organelles. The formed compartment
  is called the autophagosome. In certain cases, it can fuse with endosomes to generate
  an amphisome. Finally, the amphisome fuses with the lysosome, and the cargo is degraded.
  Depicted is a composite figure, which displays an overview of the function of the
  DUBs related to autophagy. Therefore, not all of the shown enzymes may be active
  in the same autophagic pathway. (a) A central event in early autophagic signaling
  is the activation of Beclin 1 and, thereby, the formation of PtdIns3P by the Beclin
  1-containing PI3K-III complex. In macrophages, Beclin 1 is polyubiquitinated with
  Lys63-linked ubiquitin-chains, which supports xenophagy. A20 deubiquitinates Beclin
  1 and, thereby, inhibits the autophagic degradation of bacteria. (b) USP10 and USP13
  deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated Beclin 1 and thereby contribute to its stabilization.
  Interestingly enough, USP10 also deubiquitinates p53, thereby eliciting a balanced
  breakdown of Beclin 1 in order to prevent the uncontrolled induction of autophagy.
  (c) USP33 deubiquitinates mono-ubiquitinated RALB. This allows RALB to associate
  with Beclin 1-containing complexes and to induce autophagy. (d) Selected cargoes
  of autophagy are engulfed by the PAS in order to form autophagosomes (A). Insoluble
  proteins form aggregates. The aggregates are marked with ubiquitin in order to be
  recognized by autophagy-receptors, like p62, in a process called aggrephagy. USP36
  counteracts this process by removing the chains from the substrate. (e) Mitochondria
  (M) are degraded via mitophagy. In the case of Parkin-dependent mitophagy, the ubiquitination
  of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, for example VDAC1, by the E3 ligase Parkin
  is required. USP8 keeps Parkin in its active form, as it prevents Lys6-linked auto-ubiquitination.
  In contrast, USP15, USP30 and USP35 inhibit mitophagy by removing the ubiquitin-signal
  from Parkin-targets. (f) Intracellular Salmonella species are usually surrounded
  by a protective membrane (SCV, Salmonella containing vacuole). However, the penetration
  of the cell also causes stress-induced protein aggregates (aggresome-like induced
  structures (ALIS)). Damaged SCVs, as well as ALIS are ubiquitinated and then recognized
  by the autophagy-receptor NDP52. NDP52 itself has to be activated by the E3 ligase
  TRAF6 via the attachment of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. A20 counteracts the
  function of NDP52 in order to prevent an overactivation. The DUB SseL is secreted
  by Salmonella in order to deubiquitinate ALIS and SCVs with the aim to hide the
  presence of the bacterium from the autophagy-machinery. (g) In several cases, the
  autophagosome fuses with late endosomes (E) to form amphisomes. This fusion requires
  a functional ESCRT-III machinery, as well as the deubiquitinase AMSH. Moreover,
  USP20 and USP33 are negative regulators of endocytosed β2-AR before the fusion step
  with the amphisome. Finally, the autophagic cargo is delivered to the lysosome to
  form an autolysosome for degradation. Legend: “Ub” = ubiquitin (this can involve
  different kinds of ubiquitination); “black arrows” = target of a DUB, which can
  support autophagy (“+”) or inhibit autophagy (“−”); “grey arrow” functional interaction'
