caption: Excitatory synapses onto MNs are impaired in the SOD1G93A mice and are restored
  through activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. (a) Drawing illustrating a
  normal excitatory synapse in a WT mouse. (b) In the presymptomatic SOD1G93A mice
  (~ 50 days old), the GLUR subunits of the AMPA receptors and the scaffold proteins
  (Shank1, Homer) are less expressed in the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses.
  At the same time, the presynaptic element does not seem affected. The postsynaptic
  disruption is responsible for a significant decrease of the EPSP amplitude (Bączyk,
  Alami et al., ). (c) Activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, either through intracellular
  iontophoretic ejection of Sp‐AMP (a cAMP agonist) or through CNO‐activation of a
  DREADD G(s) specifically inserted in MN using an AAV9 vector, partially restores
  the synaptic impairment, entailing a firing increase and a burden decrease of disease
  markers such as misfSOD1, LC3A and p62 aggregates (Bączyk, Alami et al., ). The
  authors would like to thank Prof. Francesco Roselli who has drawn a preliminary
  draft of this figure and Dr. Marin Manuel who has prepared the final version
