caption: Comparison of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PROTAC and therapeutic monoclonal
  antibodies mechanism of action. (A) TKIs bind to the kinase domain of the receptor
  which inhibits receptor phosphorylation and activation. Upon acquisition of drug
  resistance either develops on-target mutations or activate compensatory bypass pathways.
  (B) PROTACs degrade tyrosine kinase receptors through protein ubiquitination and
  receptor degradation. The degradation of the receptor is thought to minimize the
  activation of compensatory bypass pathways. (C) A combination of three monoclonal
  antibodies can target T790M and C797S mutant EGFR tumors. Cetuximab (EGFR), trastuzumab
  (HER2) and mAb33 (HER3) when used together were shown to suppress HER2, HER3, MET
  and AXL compensatory bypass pathway activation.
