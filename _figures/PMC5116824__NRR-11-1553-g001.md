caption: A schematic model illustrating amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism
  control by the nerve growth factor/tyrosine kinaseA NGF/TrkA signaling system in
  healthy basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) (anti-amyloidogenic route, left),
  and the consequences of its perturbation in Alzheimer's disease (amyloidogenic route,
  right).Anti-amyloidogenic route. The NGF pathway is shown. Upon binding to its ligand
  NGF, TrkA trans-phosphorylation takes place, inducing TrkA phosphorylation at the
  tyrosine 490 (Y490) residue and TrkA docking of the signaling adaptor SH2 containing
  sequence C (ShcC). Once activated, ShcC inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
  a ser/thr APP kinase thus hindering the phosphorylation of APP at the threonine
  residue 668 (T668). Since TrkA is able to bind only APP molecules not phosphorylated
  at T668, the reduction of APPpT668 levels induced by NGF promotes 1) APP-TrkA binding,
  2) subsequent TrkA-mediated trafficking of APP to the Golgi compartment and to the
  plasmamembrane, and 3) preferential cleavage of APP by the neuronal alpha secretases
  10–17 (ADAM10–17) through the physiological pathway.Amyloidogenic route. Reduced
  availability of mature NGF, and/or expression levels of TrkA affect APP metabolism
  in BFCN. In fact, disturbances in the anti-amyloidogenic NGF/TrkA-ShcC signaling
  pathway grant the activation of JNK by pro-apoptotic signals, resulting in augmented
  APPpT668 levels and disruption of APP interaction with TrkA in favor of beta secretase
  1 (BACE1) binding and cleavage of APP along the amyloidogenic pathway. This is a
  schematic model of results reported in Triaca et al., 2016.
