caption: Pathways leading to cell death. Healthy cells respond to death-inducing stimuli
  by initiating a variety of molecular pathways leading to cell death. Completion
  of the proper pathway is a critical cellular function to ensure that the appropriate
  outcome is ultimately achieved in a multicellular organism. Failure to die in response
  to particular stimuli can result in abortive embryogenesis and organ dysfunction
  and contributes to the initiation of cancer. Proinflammatory death is vital in triggering
  appropriate immune responses or, in the extreme, may cause tissue pathology and
  organ dysfunction. Therefore, pathway utilization can dramatically influence biological
  systems. Apoptosis is a pathway leading to cell death that features the activation
  of initiator caspases that activate effector caspases to cleave cellular substrates.
  Apoptotic cells demonstrate cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, DNA damage, formation
  of apoptotic bodies, maintenance of an intact plasma membrane, and exposure of surface
  molecules targeting intact cell corpses for phagocytosis. In the absence of phagocytosis,
  apoptotic bodies may proceed to lysis and secondary or apoptotic necrosis. Autophagy
  features degradation of cellular components within the intact dying cell in autophagic
  vacuoles. The morphological characteristics of autophagy include vacuolization,
  degradation of cytoplasmic contents, and slight chromatin condensation. Autophagic
  cells can also be taken up by phagocytosis. Oncosis is the prelethal pathway leading
  to cell death accompanied by cellular and organelle swelling and membrane breakdown,
  with the eventual release of inflammatory cellular contents. Pyroptosis is a pathway
  to cell death mediated by the activation of caspase-1, a protease that also activates
  the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, and IL-18. This pathway is therefore inherently
  proinflammatory. Pyroptosis also features cell lysis and release of inflammatory
  cellular contents. Undoubtedly, other pathways exist that have not yet been described.
