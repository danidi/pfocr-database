caption: Model of antipsychotic regulation of NAFLD via sympathetic nervous system
  (SNS), metabolic, inflammatory, and endocrine factors. We propose that antipsychotic
  (AA) associated increase in sympathetic activity impacts the liver by causing alterations
  in the hepatic proteome and associated pathways leading to hepatic steatosis and
  NAFLD. A hematoxylin and eosin stained liver from OLAN-treated mouse at 20× magnification
  and pathway analysis heat maps (red-shading—RIS; green-shading—OLAN) are shown in
  support of this model.
