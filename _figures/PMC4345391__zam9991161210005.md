caption: 'Simplified overview of the central carbon metabolism, including the oxidation
  of methanol via Bm(Mdh-Act) or Bm(Mdh3-Act) and the assimilation of formaldehyde
  via the RuMP pathway of recombinant C. glutamicum Δald ΔadhE strains. Additionally,
  the labeling fractions of the M + 1 mass isotopomers of the measured intracellular
  metabolites are listed for C. glutamicum Δald ΔadhE Ptuf-Bm(mdh-act) Ptuf-Bs(hps-phi)
  (values in the upper row) and C. glutamicum Δald ΔadhE Ptuf-Bm(mdh3-act) Ptuf-Bs(hps-phi)
  (values in the lower row, bold). For each strain, two independent batch reactors
  (BR1 and BR2) with CGXII defined medium (55 mM glucose, 120 mM 13C-labeled methanol)
  were run. Quenching of metabolic activity as well as intracellular metabolic analysis
  were performed at the transition to the second growth phase, and raw mass spectrometry
  data were corrected for the contribution of all naturally abundant isotopes. Abbreviations:
