caption: Signaling pathway of coagulation cascade for schizophrenia. This figure illustrates
  the signaling pathway of coagulation process for schizophrenia. The modulation of
  G-protein couple receptor on the cell membrane involved the existence of A(2A)-NCS-1
  complex by neuronal calcium binding protein, NSC-1 and Adenosine A2a receptor. The
  tissue factor triggered by antipsychotic-associated DRD2/3 receptor was released
  into vessel lumen to activate the cascade(F3, F7 and F10) of extrinsic pathway of
  coagulation process. In cluster 39, NCS-1 gene is associated with inhibition of
  dopamine D2 desensitization, and its expression was decreased in schizophrenic patients.
  The under-expressed genes in cluster 39 might contribute to the potential pathogenesis
  of schizophrenia.
