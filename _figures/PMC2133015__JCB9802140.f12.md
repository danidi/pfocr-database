caption: Model of signal transduction and cross-talks of the Rho–ROCK pathway in the
  neurite remodeling. p160ROCK is activated downstream of Rho in response to agonist
  stimulation, and in turn induces the actomyosin-based contractility and the disassembly
  of the microtubules and the intermediate filaments, leading to the neurite retraction.
  p160ROCK also transmits a negative signal to the Cdc42/Rac pathways and suppresses
  the neurite outgrowth by tonically inhibiting their actions. The activation of the
  cAMP–A kinase pathway is likely to inhibit the Rho–ROCK pathway and to release the
  suppression of neurite outgrowth. Disassembly of intermediate filaments may be caused
  by direct phosphorylation by p160ROCK at specific amino acid residue(s) of this
  cytoskeletal proteins as shown for GFAP () or may well be a secondary consequence
  of ROCK's effect on the actomyosin system.
