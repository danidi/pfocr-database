caption: (A) Fecal levels of GABA and its relevant metabolites (N-acetylornithine,
  proline, oxoproline, and glutathione) were decreased in the MDD relative to the
  HC group. In addition, a microbial enzyme–related gene (BetB) that participated
  in arginine metabolism to GABA was down-regulated in MDD. Meanwhile, three microbial
  genes (glsA, gltB, and GLT1) involved in the metabolism of glutamine to GABA was
  up-regulated in MDD. (B) Microbial genes (AOC3, hpaB, hpaE, and hpaG) and metabolite
  (homovanillate) involved in the phenylalanine catabolic pathways were decreased
  in MDD relative to HCs, suggesting an inhibition of fecal phenylalanine degradation
  in MDD. (C) The gene (KYNU) involved in the metabolism of kynurenate to quinolinate
  was up-regulated in patients with MDD. Meanwhile, fecal quinolinate levels were
  down-regulated in MDD subjects relative to HCs. KEGG genes (squares) and metabolites
  are colored. Red indicates enriched microbial genes or fecal metabolites in the
  MDD group, and blue indicates enriched in the HC group. Fecal metabolites are colored
  gray, while no information was available. The pathways were generated on the basis
  of KEGG pathway maps. Bar plots show the relative abundances of differential microbial
  genes and fecal metabolites between two groups (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01; Wilcoxon
  rank-sum test).
