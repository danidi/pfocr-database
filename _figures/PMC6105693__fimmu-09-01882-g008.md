caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis network representation of two prominently overrepresented
  pathways in the epididymis of the Tgfbr2ΔDC mice with high relevance to the model
  of autoimmunity: response of antigen-presenting cells (p = 4.17E−005) and immune
  response of leukocytes (p = 2.5E−005). The relationship and direction of change
  are indicated as upregulated in Cre+ (shades of red) or downregulated in Cre+ (shades
  of green).'
