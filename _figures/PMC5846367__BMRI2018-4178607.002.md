caption: 'Interplay between immune system and gut microbiota in homeostasis, tolerance,
  and inflammation. (a) Both commensals and opportunists compete for the metabolites
  (SCFA) and various nutrients. The intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) play a role
  in steady state environment by releasing interleukins IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal
  lymphopoietin (TSLP) factors in the presence of SCFA, PSA (Bact., fragilis), lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), and AMPs (defensins, cathelicidins, and C-type lectins). IL-25, IL-33, and
  various growth related factors help in the transformation of progenitor basophils
  to basophils, activation of monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells functioning.
  The bacteriocins released by segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) also influence
  the release of TSLP. The microfolding (M) cells upon sensing the presence of the
  microbes act as antigen presenting cell (APC) phagocytic activity by engulfing and
  presenting it to mucosal dendritic cells (DCs). In turn DCs are endowed with the
  ability to produce cytokines and other products such as IL-6 and IL-1β, tumor growth
  factor (TGF-β), retinoic acid (RA), and vitamin A. DCs form a major histocompatible
  complex (MHC) with the T cell receptors (TCR). In the presence of TGF-β and RA,
  the naïve T cells (CD4+ cells) transform into regulatory T cells (Treg). Simultaneously
  during interaction and competition of commensals and pathogens for nutrients, macrophages
  after recognition microbes released proinflammatory cytokine such as IL-10, which
  in turn helps with expansion of Treg cells which are already released during homeostasis
  and inflammation. Also with the help of DCs, macrophages release certain B cell
  activating factors which increase the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)
  to maintain tolerance and steady state. (b) ((1) & (2)): in the elderly, there are
  declined physiological functioning and dysbiosis (reduction in commensal bacteria),
  resulting in an increase in pathogens. (3) The production of IL-25, IL-33, and thymic
  stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) by IEC reduces. (4) There is decline in M cell/APC
  activity to present PSA or microbe to DCs (activation of inflammatory pathway).
  Moreover lack of PSA stimulation reduces the IL-12 levels and releases T helper
  2 cells. Decline in DCs not forming MHC with TCR reduces the population of active
  T cells such as Treg cells. Activation of B cells to plasma secretory cells and
  release of SIgA decreases. (5) The activation and function of macrophages (low levels
  of IL-10) are reduced. (6) The steady state or the tolerance is reduced. (7) Macrophages
  (inflammatory) are activated in the presence of pathogens and release proinflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) which leads to production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and causes oxidative stress. Altogether with reduced levels of Treg
  and T helper cells and SIgA increase the pathogen invasion leading to release of
  proinflammatory cytokines and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines increases inflammation,
  causing various GI disorders.'
