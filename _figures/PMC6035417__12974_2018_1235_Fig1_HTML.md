caption: Molecular mechanism of apoptosis and necroptosis. Death receptor mediates
  both extrinsic apoptosis as well as necroptosis; RIPK1 plays a key role in apoptosis
  and necroptosis. Activation of caspase-8 drives the pathway towards apoptosis while
  its inhibition leading to necroptosis. During necroptosis, RIPK1 and RIPK3 interact
  with each other resulting in the formation of functional heterodimer complex; this
  complex promotes oligomerization of MLKL by phosphorylating it. Oligomeric form
  of MLKL translocates towards the plasma membrane from cytosol resulting in the formation
  of the pore, causing an inflammatory response. In spite of pore formation, MLKL
  also mediates its effect after interacting with ion channels
