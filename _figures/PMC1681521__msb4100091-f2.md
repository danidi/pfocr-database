caption: Graphical representation of the systems level response in Halobacterium NRC-1
  to direct and indirect effects of γ radiation showing both repair and oxidative
  strategies for cell recovery. Text or arrow color indicates whether the cellular
  process or pathway was upregulated (red) or downregulated (green). Green X's indicate
  downregulated steps in the TCA cycle. Blue ellipses represent Htr8 and Htr12.
