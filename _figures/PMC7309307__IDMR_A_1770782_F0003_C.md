caption: The schematic diagram of replication cycle of coronavirus. The virus (pink)
  across the plasma membrane (brown color) by receptor-mediated endocytosis (dark
  blue) and release into the cytosol of infected persons and yield in two replicase
  polyproteins including pp1a and pp1ab (in a light brown box) by genome translation.
  The viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) accumulates into RTC (dark brown ball with
  viral nsps) that resembled in minus-strand RNA formulation due to internal proteases
  like HAT, and TMPRSS2. The sub-genome mRNAs (brown lines with red balls), (sg)-length
  minus strands (purple) and full-length genome produced, and accessory proteins exist
  in the 3’-proximal quarter of the genome. Finally, the encapsulation of viral RNA
  occurs by budding in the smooth endoplasm reticulum (green) and packed in the form
  of nucleocapsids (light blue) by the Golgi apparatus (orange) and released from
  the cell via an exocytic pathway (Snijder et al. ; de Wilde et al. ).
