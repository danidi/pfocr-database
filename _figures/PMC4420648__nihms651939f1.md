caption: As the bacterial load of P. gingivalis in the oral cavity increases Periodontal
  Disease becomes more severe. However, damage is not just limited to the oral cavity
  since local vasculature enables an entry point for bacteria, bacterial by-products,
  or inflammatory mediators (e.g. cytokines IL-1 or TNF-α). Bacteremia, common in
  periodontal disease due to dental work e.g. cleaning, flossing or surgery, effect
  both endothelium and macrophages by inducing homotolerance along the TLR pathway.
  However, since P. gingivalis is an invasive bacterium, mediated by its Fim protein,
  it has the ability to activate the cytosolic NODs through recognition of MDP, a
  fragment of peptidoglycan (PGN). In addition, various bacterial by-products, e.g.
  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can also activate both the endothelium and macrophages.
  Further, from the oral cavity a state of local inflammation exists and immune cells
  are constantly releasing inflammatory mediators into the circulation, these mediators,
  IL-1 or TNF-α, can activate both the endothelium and macrophages. Finally, activated
  endothelium and macrophages have been shown to exacerbate Atherosclerosis when coupled
  with a HFD.
