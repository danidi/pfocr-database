caption: 12-LOX generates 12(S)-HETE by its enzymatic activity on cell membrane arachidonic
  acid. 12(S)-HETE, being a lipid molecule, can freely diffuse across the cell membrane
  and bind to the cell membrane receptors, triggering intracellular signaling pathways.
  The present study has shown that 12-LOX and 12(S)-HETE are capable of upregulating
  HIF-1α mRNA levels, protein level, and functional activity. In addition to the effect
  on the transcriptional pathway, 12-LOX was also found to modulate HIF-1α via the
  PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which is antagonized by the tumor suppressor PTEN. Transcriptional
  and post transcriptional pathways activated by 12-LOX may be sufficient to overcome
  the loss of HIF-1α protein by degradation thereby, enhancing the availability of
  functionally active protein, which can activate transcription of downstream genes
  such as VEGF and in turn prostate cancer angiogenesis.
