caption: 'Simplified overview of the (engineered) oxidation of methanol, the endogenous
  pathway for formaldehyde oxidation, and the synthetic pathway for the assimilation
  of formaldehyde via the RuMP pathway in the context of the central carbon metabolism
  of C. glutamicum. Abbreviations: oxPPP/redPPP, oxidative/reductive pentose phosphate
  pathway; MDH, methanol dehydrogenase; AdhA, alcohol dehydrogenase; FADH, formaldehyde
  dehydrogenase; FDH, formate dehydrogenase; HPS, 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase;
  PHI, 6-phosphate-3-hexuloisomerase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; FBA, fructose bisphosphate
  aldolase; TPI, triosephosphate isomerase; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate;
  H6P, hexulose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PYR, pyruvate.
  The three enzymes (MDH, HPS, and PHI) necessary for establishing a synthetic pathway
  for methanol oxidation and formaldehyde assimilation in C. glutamicum are circled.'
