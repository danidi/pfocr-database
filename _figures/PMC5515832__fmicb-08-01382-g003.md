caption: (A) Number of genes involved in the relevant methanogenesis pathways in both
  RS and DS datasets. Number in boxes indicates the reads assigned at each level.
  The three known pathways involved in methanogenesis are colored differentially.
  The hydrogenotrophic pathway is marked in blue arrows, the acetoclastic pathway
  is shown in red arrows, and the methylotrophic pathway is presented in black arrows.
  The pathway common to all is represented by brown headed arrows. FdhA, glutathione-independent
  formaldehyde dehydrogenase; EchA, hydrogenase subunit A; FmdA, formylmethanofuran
  dehydrogenase subunit A; FTR, formylmethanofuran-tetrahydromethanopterin N-formyltransferase;
  MCH, methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase; MTD, methylenetetrahydromethanopterin
  dehydrogenase; MER, coenzyme F420-dependent N5, N10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin
  reductase; MtrA, tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase; MtaA, [methyl-Co(III)
  methanol-specific corrinoid protein]:coenzyme M methyltransferase; McrA, methyl-coenzyme
  M reductase alpha subunit; AckA, acetate kinase; ACSS, acetyl-CoA synthetase; PTA,
  phosphate acetyltransferase; HdrA, heterodisulfide reductase subunit A; CdhC, acetyl-CoA
  decarbonylase/synthase complex subunit beta. (B) Schematic representation of anaerobic
  carbon mineralization in DS with the microbial communities involved at each step.
