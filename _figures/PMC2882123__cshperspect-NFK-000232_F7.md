caption: Imd pathway in adult Drosophila melanogaster. The transmembrane protein PGRP-LC
  senses the presence of DAP-type PGN and activates the Imd pathway Imd has an essential
  role in controlling the phosphorylation of Relish through the activation of TAK1
  and the IKK signalosome. Cleavage of phosphorylated Relish is dependent on the caspase
  Dredd. The activation of TAK1 and the IKK signalosome requires several proteins,
  including FADD and Dredd. Cleaved Relish is translocated in the nucleus and binds
  to NF-κB response elements, inducing the expression of numerous genes encoding immune
  response proteins, namely antimicrobial peptides such as Diptericin. In addition
  to phosphorylating the IKK complex, TAK1 also acts as a JNK kinase and activates
  the JNK pathway.
