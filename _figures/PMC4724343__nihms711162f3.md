caption: 'Because KAT2B is a novel genetic susceptibility factor for drug abuse, we
  built a GeneMANIA () network centered around KAT2B to find related genes that may
  have functional links to drug abuse.  shows that 20 genes were implicated in the
  KAT2B network, based on their co-expression, physical interactions, predicted functional
  relationships (e.g., protein interactions), and pathway data. We investigated rs9829896
  as a trans- eQTL for transcripts encoded by the 20 genes identified in the KAT2B
  network via GeneMANIA. Two gene transcripts were associated with rs9829896 at P<0.05:
  the C allele being associated with lower expression of MAML1 (P=0.043) and CREBBP
  (P=0.011) in AAs only. MAML1 functions as a transcriptional co-activator of the
  Notch signaling pathway that is involved in cell fate determination (). Notch signaling
  has been indicated for altering drug reward properties in Drosophila melanogaster
  (), but the function of MAML1 in relation to drug abuse is unclear. In contrast,
  CREB binding protein (CREBBP) is a member of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) pathway that has been widely studied for drug addiction.  shows that rs9829896-C
  was associated with lower CREBBP expression in AAs (P=0.011) but not in EAs (P=1.00).'
