caption: Cdk2 directly phosphorylates at least two proteins, ATRIP and Cdc6, that
  directly regulate the G2-M transition via the ATR-Chk1-Cdc25A pathway. The activity
  of Cdk1 is independently inhibited upon activation of the p53-p21 pathway, which
  is defective in many cancer cells. See text for additional details.
