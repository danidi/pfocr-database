caption: Proposed pathways for ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in ozone-exposed
  plants. Activity of ACC synthase (ACS), the key enzyme of this pathway, is regulated
  with MPK6 in Arabidopsis or SIPK in tobacco, which activity is controlled with cytosolic
  free Ca2+. Ethylene binds to ethylene receptors (e.g., ETR), and ethylene signal
  is transmitted via EIN2.
