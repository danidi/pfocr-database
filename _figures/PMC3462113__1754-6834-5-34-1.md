caption: 'Overview of the main metabolic reactions in central carbon metabolism.A)
  Xylose can be assimilated through two pathways: the fungal oxidoreductive pathway
  consisting of XR and XDH or the bacterial isomerization pathway via an XI. The xylulose
  formed by the two pathways is phosphorylated by XK and channelled through the non-oxidative
  PPP yielding 2/3 moles F6P and 1/3 moles GAP per mole substrate. These metabolites
  enter glycolysis to generate ATP in the conversion of PEP to pyruvate and the oxidative
  PPP to regenerate NADPH. Pyruvate is converted into ethanol, acetate and oxaloacetate,
  which is transported into the mitochondria for amino acid synthesis. Under anaerobic
  conditions succinate dehydrogenase is not operational which results in a branched
  TCA-cycle with succinate as the end product. The twelve precursor metabolites which
  are required for biosynthesis of macromolecules are highlighted in orange colour.
  Metabolites in capital letters have been measured in the current study. B) Glycolysis
  is activated through the induction of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway. cAMP formed by adenylate
  cyclase (CYR1) interacts with the regulatory subunits (R) of PKA which releases
  the catalytic subunits (C). The active PKA phosphorylates PFK26 which subsequently
  produces F26BP from F6P and ATP. F26BP is an essential activator of PFK1 which phosphorylates
  F6P to FBP. The production of FBP in turn activates PYK and ATP generation. Production
  of ATP and ethanol depends on a high catalytic activity of PYK which requires the
  simultaneous presence of G6P, F6P and FBP. PKA and F26BP also efficiently inactivate
  gluconeogenesis by inhibiting FBP1.'
