caption: 'The circadian transcription/translation loop is comprised of rhythmically
  expressed “clock genes”. Circadian protein complexes containing BMAL1 drive expression
  of rhythmic genes including period (PER) and cryptochrome (CRY) through E-box DNA
  elements in promoters. PER/CRY negatively regulate their own expression. As PER/CRY
  degrade over several hours, BMAL1 activity increases and the cycle repeats. Time
  of onset (phase), duration (period), and strength (amplitude) of the cycle is regulated
  by multiple signaling pathway inputs. The figure was adapted from Landgraf et al.
