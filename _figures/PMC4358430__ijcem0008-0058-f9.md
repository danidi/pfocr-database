caption: Schematic diagram describing PM2.5 induced autophagy mediated by the AMPK
  pathway. PM2.5 exposure in A549 cells causes the activation of AMPK, potentially
  through the ROS signaling pathway, which subsequently leads to autophagy. The AKT,
  MAPK and p53 signaling pathways are also activated, with an inhibitory effect by
  the AKT, ERK and p38 pathways and no apparent effect on autophagy by JNK and p53
  signaling pathways. These results suggest there is a balance of activating and inhibitory
  pathways, and that activating pathways (ROS and AMPK) predominately regulate the
  response to PM2.5 to promote an overall induction of autophagy. The DNA damage induced
  by PM2.5 also activates apoptosis, which is counteracted in part by the induction
  of autophagy.
