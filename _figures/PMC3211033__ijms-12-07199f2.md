caption: Proposed role of PGC-1α in ischemic condition. ROS overproduction may stimulate
  the activation of PGC-1α signaling pathway, further triggering upregulation of mitochondrial
  proteins, including UCP2 and SOD2, in ischemic neurons. PGC-1α also regulates NRF-1,
  NRF-2 and Tfam expression as well as mitochondrial biogenesis that may have protective
  effects in ischemic condition. PGC-1α = peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ
  co-activator 1α; UCP2 = uncoupling protein 2; SOD2 = superoxide dismutase 2; NRFs
  = Nuclear respiratory factors; Tfam = Mitochondrial transcription factor A; ↑ and
  ↘ denote increase and decrease, respectively.
