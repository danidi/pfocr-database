caption: Proposed model summarizing the findings of this study. Under normal conditions,
  both insulin and IGF-I reduce APP phosphorylation through an Akt-mediated pathway.
  In IR, the PI3-K/Akt pathway is compromised, leading to an almost complete inhibition
  of the insulin-mediated reduction in APP phosphorylation. IGF-I still is able to
  reduce APP phosphorylation under IR conditions, but its effect is greatly reduced.
