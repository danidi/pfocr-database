caption: CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks in hematological malignancies. Selected samples
  of circRNAs and their genomic targets are exhibited for tumor growth, progression
  and drug resistance. (A) Circ_0000190 was downregulated in MM and inhibited proliferation
  as well as induced apoptosis of MM cells through negatively regulating the suppression
  of miR-767-5p to MAPK4, which led to tumor growth. (B) Circ-CBFB, overexpressed
  in CLL, was identified as a sponge of miR-607 that targeted FZD3. Circ-CBFB promoted
  FZD3 expression, resulting in activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and consequent
  progression of CLL. (C) CircPAN3 could inhibit both miR-153-5p and miR-183-5p, thereby
  upregulating the expression of XIAP. CircPAN3 was also responsible for AML drug
  resistance via regulating the level of autophagy-associated proteins
