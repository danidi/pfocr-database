caption: Summary of strigolactone biosynthetic and signaling pathways. The biosynthesis
  involves two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, CCD7 (MAX3, RMS5, D17/HTD1, DAD3)
  and CCD8 (MAX4, RMS1, D10, DAD1), one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (MAX1) and one
  novel iron-containing protein (D27) [,,–]. In Medicago, SL biosynthesis also requires
  GRAS-type transcription factors NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY1 (NSP1) and NSP2 [].
  SL signaling involves MAX2/RMS4/D3 [], an F-box leucine-rich protein and DWARF14
  (D14)/DAD2/D88/HTD2 [–], a member of α/β-fold hydrolase superfamily. Potential downstream
  component in the SL pathway, such as members of the TCP family of transcription
  factors, are not shown in the chart.
