caption: T2R38-mediated regulation of sinonasal immunity. Bacterial species like P.
  aeruginosa release quorum sensing molecules like acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)
  and quinolones. These bitter microbial products activate T2R38 and elicit a local
  immune response via the canonical taste-signaling pathway. This response involves
  activation of PLCβ2 and IP3 production. IP3 triggers the release of calcium (Ca2+)
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  activates nitric oxide (NO) formation via nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO increases
  ciliary beat frequency via activation of protein kinase G and diffuses into the
  airway surface liquid to directly kill bacteria.
