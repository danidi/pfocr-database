caption: A proposed model for the regulation of NO-triggered jasmonate (JA) and ABA
  synthesis and signaling pathways through a RAP2.3-based rheostat-like mechanism
  that controls nitrate reductase (NR/NIA)-mediated NO biosynthesis and NO-regulated
  hypocotyl growth. Potential direct targets of RAP2.3 containing the putative RAP2.3-binding
  site in their gene promoters are highlighted in black. An arrow indicates promotion
  of a pathway by RAP2.3 whilst a blocked line indicates repression.
