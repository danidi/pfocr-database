caption: The pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic effects of the NGF signaling pathway
  in CSC metabolism and EMT. Schematic model illustrating the opposite pro-oncogenic
  (left) and anti-oncogenic (right) actions of NGF signaling pathway in the control
  of CSCs growth and cancer evasion from the host immune system. Pro-oncogenic pathway.
  CSCs promote tumor growth, perineural invasion, CSCs proliferation and spreading
  through vessels and nerves by NGF release. In fact, tumor-released NGF attracts
  cholinergic endings and promotes cancer expansion and neoangiogenesis through neuronal-derived
  Ach and VEGF. Further, CSCs inhibit the host immune response and facilitate metastatic
  spreading through IL-10, IL-6, and TGF-β. Excess amount of proNGF stimulates macrophages
  polarization toward the M2 phenotype, giving rise to TAMs, which are unable to phagocytize
  cancer cells. Moreover, MDSCs induce Tregs expansion by TGF-β release and contribute
  to dismount the T-cells mediated immune response. Anti-oncogenic pathway. On the
  other hand, increasing evidences pinpoint a role for NGF pathway in promoting tumor
  surveillance by both natural and adaptive immune cells. The NGF-TrkA signaling system
  induces phagocytic M1 macrophages, thus resolving cancerogenic inflammation. Moreover,
  NGF receptors allow membrane exposure of activatory NK receptors. The p75-expressing
  γδ T cells are phagocytic T cells of the so-called “lymphoid stress surveillance”
  system. NGF-TrkA promotes MHC-I and MHC-II expression by cancer cells and CSCs,
  and allow recruitment of IL-2 activated T cells in lymph- , promoting the tumor
  mass eradication. The illustration includes images modified from “freevector.com”,
