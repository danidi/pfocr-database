caption: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate innate immune responses through activation
  of RIG‐I and via deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms. A, Under normal circumstances
  in the resting state of macrophages, RIG‐I exists in the autoinhibited state with
  the CARD2 domain of RIG‐I binding to the insertion region of the helicase. With
  the invasion of the 5′‐triphosphate double‐stranded viral RNA, the CTD senses and
  binds the viral RNA, which leads to the structural transformation of RIG‐I into
  an open conformation and the release of CARDs, thereby mediating downstream signaling
  and induction of IFN‐β expression. After sensing the extracellular IFN‐β signal,
  TLR2 upregulates the expression of lnc‐Lsm3b, which inhibits RIG‐I‐mediated immune
  responses by binding to RIG‐I and suppresses the production of IFN‐β and other anti‐inflammatory
  factors. B, TLR2 and TLR4 induce the expression of lincRNA‐Cox2 through the NF‐κB
  signal pathway upon LPS or Pam3CKS4 stimulation. On the one hand, lincRNA‐Cox2 promotes
  the binding of the Mi‐2/NuRD complex in the promoter region of IL‐12b, decreasing
  histone H3K27 acetylation and increasing H3K27 dimethylation, which leads to lincRNA‐Cox2‐mediated
  transinhibition of the secondary response gene IL‐12b. Alternatively, upon LPS stimulation,
  lincRNA‐Cox2 is assembled into the SWI/SNF complex and acts to recruit NF‐κB to
  the complex, which plays an important role in the regulation of SWI/SNF‐associated
  chromatin remodeling and the transactivation of advanced inflammatory response genes
