caption: Metabolic network designed to simulate the ASC-GSH pathway in chloroplasts
  under light/dark conditions. a The light-dependent processes and enzymatic steps
  involved in the model; black and white checkered arrows indicate the steps which
  are light-dependent, so they are switched off under dark conditions. b the APX catalytic
  mechanism introduced into the network, including the inactivation of the enzyme
  by the reaction of CoI with H2O2 and continuous APX input into the system by de
  novo synthesis of the protein. c The spontaneous reactions included in the model;
  k j values (j = 1–6) were considered apparent bimolecular rate constants
