caption: Metabolic pathways fueling the RSI. In mammals, L-arginine is formed from
  citrulline, derived either from dietary glutamine or proline via ornithine and carbamoylphosphate
  in the mitochondria or from bicarbonate (HCO3−) and ammonia (NH3) via the hepatic
  urea cycle. Citrulline is then transported via the blood to the kidney where it
  is converted into arginine. Arginine used for protein formation and (O2-dependent)
  NO synthesis can be recycled via the arginine/citrulline cycle. NOS activity is
  inhibited by different methylated arginine residues released by proteolysis (e.g.,
  ADMA). A key interaction between nitrogen and sulfur metabolism is the methylation
  of arginine using SAM-dependent methyltransferases. SAM is a cofactor produced from
  methionine and used for methylation of a large number of biomolecules; in the methionine
  recycling pathway, the removal of one methyl group (-CH3) results in the formation
  of homocysteine. Depending on the availability of methionine, homocysteine is either
  recycled to methionine with the help of vitamin B12 and folic acid or is degraded
  to cystathionine and cysteine. While the latter also serves as precursor of cellular
  glutathione production, both compounds can generate H2S in the transsulfuration
  pathway. Not shown here is the formation of ROS via NADPH oxidases, the mitochondrial
  respiratory chain, and other sources. See  for more details. ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine;
  NOS, nitric oxide synthases; SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine; SAM, S-adenosyl-methionine.
