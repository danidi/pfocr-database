caption: Axels and brakes in the immune reaction. Immune reaction against a certain
  antigen is regulated both positively (axels) and negatively (brakes). a Axels (positive
  regulation). A main pathway is the stimulation of T cells by antigen presented in
  the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules by antigen-presenting
  cells (APC) and recognition of antigen-MHC class II complexes by the T cell antigen
  receptor (TCR) on T cells (signal 1). In addition to signal 1, a costimulatory signal
  induced by the interaction of the CD28 receptor on T cells with its ligands, B7
  [B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86)] (signal 2), is necessary to start the immune reaction
  against antigen. b Brakes (negative regulation). CTLA4, a receptor expressed on
  T cells, recognizes as ligands the same B7 molecules as those recognized by CD28
  and inhibits the immune reaction at both the level of ligand recognition by competing
  with the same ligands as those of CD28 and the level of signal transduction in the
  CD28-mediated costimulatory pathway. PD-1 is another receptor expressed on T cells
  acting as a negative regulator of the immune reaction. Upon recognition of its ligands,
  PDL1 (also known as B7-H1 or CD274) and PDL2 (B7-DC or CD273), PD-1 negatively regulates
  the immune reaction by inhibiting the TCR signaling pathway (signal 1) through inactivation
  of ZAP70, a major integrator of TCR-mediated signaling. PD-1 also inhibits the CD28-mediated
  costimulatory pathway (signal 2) by inhibiting PI3 kinase (PI3 K). c Axels without
  brakes. Inhibition of PD-1 and CTLA4 by anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies strongly
  activates the immune reaction, leading to a beneficial effect on cancers and malignant
  tumors, but a harmful effect on autoimmunity and immune-related diseases, including
  type 1 diabetes
