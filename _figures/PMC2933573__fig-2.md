caption: NO can both protect and sensitize cells to excitotoxic cell death through
  a mitochondrial pathway. (A) NO plays a key role in excitotoxic pathways mediated
  by NMDA Ca2+ channels. Under normal physiologic conditions, NO (after converting
  to NO+) S-nitrosylates NMDA receptors, blocks Ca2+ influx, and promotes cell survival.
  (B) When mtNOS is responsible for the majority of NOS activity (as is the case in
  immature neurons), Ca2+ enters mitochondria and stimulates NO production by mtNOS.
  NO inhibits the respiratory chain, which reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential,
  collapses the ion gradient, and decreases entry of Ca2+ into the mitochondria. Decreased
  Ca2+ influx causes a decrease in mtNOS activity and NO production, promoting cell
  survival. (C) When cytosolic nNOS is the primary producer of NO (as is the case
  in mature neurons), Ca2+ entry through overactive NMDA channels stimulates nNOS,
  and NO can then enter the mitochondria and directly inhibit complex IV (cytochrome
  c oxidase; COX) of the respiratory chain, which leads to a block of ATP production
  and eventual cell death due to energetic failure. In contrast to pathway B, no feedback
  loop is present to protect the cell from damage. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
