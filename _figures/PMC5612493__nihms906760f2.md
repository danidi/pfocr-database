caption: Simplified schematic of heroin conjugate immunological pathway and mechanism
  of action. Upon vaccination, the conjugate is taken up by dendritic cells (DCs),
  processed and displayed on the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)
  as a haptenated peptide for activation of helper T-cells (Th-cells) via the T-cell
  receptor (TCR). B-cells which have encountered the conjugate via their B-cell receptors
  (BCR) are stimulated by activated Th-cells. Adjuvants alum and CpG ODN enhance the
  vaccine response through NLRP3 inflammasome and TLR9 signaling, respectively. Memory
  B-cells and plasma cells produce high affinity anti-6AM IgG antibodies which bind
  to an administered heroin dose (metabolized to 6AM) in the periphery, thus mitigating
  drug effects in the brain.
