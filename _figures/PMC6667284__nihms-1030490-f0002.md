caption: Complement and TLRs are co-activated in response to microbial infection.
  Certain microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), e.g., zymosan, LPS, and CpG
  (agonists of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, respectively) can activate both TLRs and complement.
  Complement anaphylatoxin receptor signaling stimulated by C3a or C5a synergizes
  with TLR-MyD88 signaling, induced either by MAMPs or endogenous danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs; e.g., biglycan, hyaluronan fragments, and heparan sulfate
  fragments). This synergy leads to enhanced activation of MAPKs and transcription
  factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1, resulting in upregulated expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules. TLR activation can also upregulate the expression
  of complement proteins via a TRIF pathway (induced by TLR3 or TLR4 signaling), thereby
  generating a feed-forward loop that further amplifies inflammatory responses.
