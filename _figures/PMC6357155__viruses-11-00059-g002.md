caption: The life cycle of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in host cells. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
  enter target cells through an endosomal pathway. The S proteins of SARS and MERS
  bind to cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cellular receptor
  dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively. Following entry of the virus into the
  host cell, the viral RNA is unveiled in the cytoplasm. ORF1a and ORF1ab are translated
  to produce pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, which are cleaved by the proteases that
  are encoded by ORF1a to yield 16 non-structural proteins that form the RNA replicase–transcriptase
  complex. This complex drives the production of negative-sense RNAs [(−) RNA] through
  both replication and transcription. During replication, full-length (−) RNA copies
  of the genome are produced and used as templates for full-length (+) RNA genomes.
  During transcription, a subset of 7–9 sub-genomic RNAs, including those encoding
  all structural proteins, is produced through discontinuous transcription. Although
  the different sub-genomic mRNAs may contain several open reading frames (ORFs),
  only the first ORF (that closest to the 5′ end) is translated. Viral nucleocapsids
  are assembled from genomic RNA and N protein in the cytoplasm, followed by budding
  into the lumen of the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermediate compartment).
  Virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis. SARS-CoV, severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus; S, spike; E, envelope; M, membrane; N, nucleocapsid.
