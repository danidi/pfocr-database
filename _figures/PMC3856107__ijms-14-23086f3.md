caption: Roles and signaling pathways of let-7 in hypoxia- and neural stem/progenitor
  cells (NSPCs)-induced angiogenesis. Hypoxia treatment on endothelial cells (ECs)
  induced angiogenesis through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)/let-7s/(AGO1)/VEGF
  signaling pathway. In ECs co-incubated with NSPCs, pro-angiogenic factors released
  by the NSPCs induced angiogenesis through SMAD2 (SMAD3), and p53/IGF-1R/p-mTOR signaling
  pathways.
