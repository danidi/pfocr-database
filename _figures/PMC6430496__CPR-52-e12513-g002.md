caption: Underlying molecular mechanisms of ZFAS1 in multiple human cancers. A, ZFAS1
  functioned as a ceRNA to directly interacted with miR‐150 to increase the expression
  of ZEB1, MMP14, MMP16, and SP1. B, silencing ZFAS1 could decrease the expression
  of CDK1 by competing for miR‐590‐3p. C, ZFAS1 may act as a ceRNA to upregulate the
  expression of BMI1 by competitively binding miR‐200b/c. D, After Silencing ZFAS1,
  the expression levels of mesenchymal markers, including MMP2, MMP9, N‐cadherin,
  Integrin β1, ZEB1, Twist, and Snail, were markedly downregulated, while the expression
  of epithelial markers including E‐cadherin and ZO1 significantly upregulated. E,
  ZFAS1 could regulate the expression of Hes‐1 and NICD to activate Notch signalling
  pathway. F, decreased ZFAS1 contributed to cell‐cycle arrest and inducement of apoptosis
  by reducing the expression of p53 and cyclin B1 and promoting PARP cleavage. G,
  ZFAS1 could simultaneously interact with EZH2 and LSD1/CoREST to inhibit KLF2 and
  NKD2 transcription. H, SP1 could activate the expression of ZFAS1
