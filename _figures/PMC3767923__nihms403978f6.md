caption: Schematic of DNA damage response to double strand breaks. After a double
  strand break occurs ATM is activated via interaction with the MRN (MRE11A-RAD50-NBN
  (NBS1) complex. After ATM is activated it establishes a very broad cascade of second
  messengers (including the MRN complex) to perform a varieties of cellular functions.
  Progression of the cell cycle is arrested. This is thought to help prevent the propagation
  of the DNA damage and allow time for repair. Arrest of the cell cycle involves interaction
  with the cyclin dependent kinase machinery and potentially the centrosome as well.
  In addition, apoptotic response pathways related to TP53 (p53) are activated permitting
  the cell to initiate programmed cell death if the level of DNA damage is severe,
  but much remains to be determined as to how these decisions are made 178. Finally,
  the proteins that will perform the DNA repair are attracted to the site of damage
  break. Abnormalities in genes involved in the non-homologous end-joining pathway
  leads to microcephaly in humans including LIG4, NHEJ and PNKP and an analogous phenotype
  in mice Lig4 , , Xrcc4 , Xrcc6 (Ku70)/Xrcc5 (Ku80), or Prkdc (DNA-PKcs) .
