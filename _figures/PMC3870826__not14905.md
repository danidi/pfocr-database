caption: 'Model showing the vasculogenesis pathway that restores tumor vasculature
  after irradiation and the various inhibitors of this pathway that can improve the
  radiation response of the tumor. In addition to summarizing the data from the present
  study, the figure draws data from prior publications., Abbreviations: MAb, monoclonal
  antibody; HIF-, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
  IR, irradiation.'
