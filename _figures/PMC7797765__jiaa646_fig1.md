caption: Simplified overview of the complement pathway. Activation of the complement
  system commences via the classical, lectin, and/or alternative pathway, resulting
  in the formation of C3 convertase, which cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b further
  degrades to C3c but also activates C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and
  C5b. C5b combined with other complement factors forms the terminal complement complex
  (TCC) or membrane attack complex (MAC). C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins and are inducers
  of inflammation and coagulation. TCC leads to cell lysis and can also activate the
  coagulation pathway. The complement factors measured in this study are highlighted
  with a black outline.
