caption: The cellular response to growth factor (GF) via its receptor. Upon dimerization
  of the receptor, IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) is phosphorylated and activates
  (via its SH2 domain) downstream effectors, particularly PI3K (phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase). The latter, in turn, phosphorylates the second messenger PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate), resulting in the activation of AKT (protein kinase B), which
  activates the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1). This pathway promotes
  cellular proliferation (via AKT) and also promotes angiogenesis and protein synthesis
  via the mTORC1 effector. Overactivation of the catalytic unit of PI3K, called PIK3CA,
  or AKT1 may result in uncontrolled activation of this pathway and signal-independent
  (over) growth. The former is seen in PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) and
  the latter in Proteus syndrome, both are segmental overgrowth syndromes. A similar
  picture can be seen with biallelic deactivation of PTEN which is a growth repressor,
  as it dephosphorylates PIP3 back to its inactive form PIP2. This condition is seen
  in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). Not shown in the figure, but similar to
  PHTS, other growth repressors are the TSC1/2 complexes (tuber sclerosis complex),
  which inhibit mTORC1, but themselves are inhibited by AKT. The pathogenesis of variants
  in TSC1/2 is different, resulting in discrete tuberous growth of the cutaneous and
  CNS tissues, and predispose to variety of cancers. Of note, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  is one pathway in which the growth factor activates.
