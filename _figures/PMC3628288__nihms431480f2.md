caption: 'Diagram of two potential molecular pathways of serrated neoplasia. The precursors
  of the first pathway are the microvesicular hyperplastic polyp and/or the sessile
  serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P) with the potential for SSA/P to arise de novo from
  normal mucosa. This pathway results in cancers that are CIMP-high and carry BRAFV600E
  mutations with either MSI or MSS status. The second pathway is less defined with
  the potential precursor lesion being the goblet cell hyperplastic polyp and the
  tradiational serrated adenoma (TSA). The end result of the second path is MSS and
  CIMP-low cancers that are associated with KRAS mutations, although this remains
  speculative. Abbrev.: CIMP, CpG Island methylator phenotype; MSI, microsatellite
  instability; MSS, microsatellite stable;'
