caption: Apoptotic cell (AC)-derived cargo can be cytotoxic, and therefore it needs
  to be released from the efferocyte or metabolized. Metabolic changes resulting from
  these processes can be used by the efferocyte to optimize further AC uptake and
  to trigger resolution pathways. Three examples are illustrated here. a | AC-derived
  free cholesterol can be esterified by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)
  into cholesterol esters and sequestered in neutral lipid droplets or effluxed from
  the cell to prevent its accumulation. Efflux is facilitated by various efferocytosis
  receptor signalling pathways and sterol pathways that lead to the induction of cholesterol
  efflux transporters, such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). b | AC-derived
  fatty acids undergo oxidation in a mitochondria-mediated pathway that promotes upregulation
  of expression of proresolving IL-10. c | Binding of ACs to efferocyte receptors
  that recognize phosphatidylserine (PS) leads to the upregulation of glucose transporter
  1 (GLUT1; also known as SLC2A1) and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1),
  which is required for GLUT1 transport to the plasma membrane. ADGRB1, adhesion G
  protein-coupled receptor B1; ELMO1, engulfment cell motility 1; GAS6, growth arrest-specific
  protein 6; LRP1, LDL-related protein 1; LXR, liver X receptor; MERTK, MER proto-oncogene
  tyrosine kinase; PBX1, pre-B cell leukaemia homeobox 1.
