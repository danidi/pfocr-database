caption: Molecular networks generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis using the top
  selected genes discriminating chronic kidney disease (CKD) from hemodialysis (HD)
  patients. Network, algorithmically generated based on the functional and biological
  connectivity among genes, was graphically represented as nodes (genes) and edges
  (the biological relationship between genes). Shaded nodes represented genes identified
  by our microarray analysis and others (empty nodes) were those that IPA automatically
  included because biologically linked to our genes based on evidence in the literature.
  Meaning of node shapes and edges are indicated. Red and green shaded genes were
  those used for validation by classical biomolecular techniques.
