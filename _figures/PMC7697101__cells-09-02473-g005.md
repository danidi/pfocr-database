caption: Anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of targeting the AnxA1/Fpr2/ALX
  pathway against thrombo-inflammation. Thrombo-inflammatory conditions such as sepsis
  [] and sickle cell disease (SCD) [] induce inflammation (Box 1) as well as thrombus
  formation (Box 2) in the cerebral microcirculation enabling thrombo-inflammation
  (as indicated by e.g., heightened platelet GPVI, αIIbβ3 and P-selectin expression,
  and increased platelet–platelet (homotypic) aggregates and platelet-neutrophil (heterotypic)
  aggregates). Neutrophils also produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) which
  can exacerbate thrombo-inflammation (Box 3). AnxA1Ac2-26 inhibits lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) and SCD-induced cerebral inflammation (Box 4) and cerebral thrombosis (Box
  5) via Fpr2/ALX. The AnxA1 peptide affords protection by altering the haemostatic
  action of platelets, modulating platelet cell surface molecules elicited by GPVI
  (e.g., αIIbβ3 and P-selectin), and reducing platelet (homotypic and heterotypic)
  aggregation. Thus, AnxA1Ac2-26 promotes the resolution of thrombo-inflammation by
  reducing platelet activation, adhesion, and aggregation which cause and promote
  thrombosis (Box 6).
