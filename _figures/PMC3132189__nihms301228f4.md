caption: Proposed lipid metabolic pathways in Giardia. The model proposes that PC
  and lyso-PC, which are abundant in the growth medium, can be taken up by Giardia
  with the help of gPLT or gFLIP (step 1). Diacylglycerol (DAG) and FA are internalised
  by specific transporter(s) from the growth medium (steps 2 & 3). Internalised PC
  can be converted to PS with the help of gPSS1-like enzyme encoded by putative gpss
  gene (step 4). Giardia expresses psd gene (), and its possible encoded product (gPSD)
  may facilitate PE synthesis from PS (step 5). The putative gpss can also encode
  gPSS2-like enzyme for the synthesis of PS from PE (step 6). Because PG is the major
  phospholipid in Giardia and is not present in the growth media (), it is likely
  that Giardia has the ability to synthesize PG not only by CDP-DAG pathway (step
  16) but also by the headgroup remodelling reaction shown in step 9. Similarly, PI
  is synthesized from PC by base or headgroup exchange reactions from PG (step 10).
  However, the presence of these two pathways—i.e., PC -> PG and PG -> PI—is yet to
  be elucidated in Giardia or other eukaryotic cells. PI can be converted to various
  phosphinositides facilitated by gpiks (step 11) as mentioned before (; ). Giardial
  plb and lpl gene may be responsible for synthesizing glycerophosphorylcholine from
  PC and lyso-PC, respectively (steps 7 & 8). Diacylglycerol (DAG) obtained from the
  growth medium can be converted to CDP-DAG (step 13) and serves as a precursor for
  TAG (step 14), PG (step 15), and PI (step 16). Exogenous FAs can produce unsaturated
  FAs (MUFA and PUFA) and elongated FAs as depicted in steps 18 & 19. Exogenous PalmA
  can be used as a precursor to synthesize 3-ketosphinganine with the help of gspts
  (steps 20–21). Similarly, both ceramide and SM can be acquired from the growth medium
  (step 22) by endocytic and non-endocytic pathways. Exogenously obtained SM can be
  hydrolyzed by gsmases to produce ceramide (step 23), and ceramide can be used to
  synthesize GlcCer (step 24). PC, phosphatidylcholine; lyso-PC, lyso-phosphatidylcholine;
  PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PIP, phosphatidylinositol
  phosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol triphosphate;

  acid; MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; SM, sphingomyelin;
