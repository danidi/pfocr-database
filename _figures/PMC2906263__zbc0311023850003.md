caption: Suppression of IFN-induced Jak-STAT signaling in hepatitis C. Type I (IFN-α/β)
  and III (IFN-λ) IFNs initiate signaling by binding to distinct heterodimeric receptors
  on the plasma membrane but then signal through a common pathway involving Tyk-2
  and Jak-1 phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and subsequent recruitment of IRF9
  to form the transcription factor ISGF3, which stimulates transcription of ISGs under
  the control of IFN-stimulated response elements. The HCV core protein may confound
  these responses by interacting directly with STAT1, whereas endoplasmic reticulum
  stress within infected cells may induce PP2A activity that acts indirectly through
  PRMT1 and PIAS to suppress signaling. Type I IFN signaling may also be impeded by
  induction of USP18 that interacts directly with the IFNAR2 subunit of the IFNAR.
  See text for details. ISRE, IFN-stimulated response element.
