caption: Adipose tissue is largely comprised of adipocytes but also contains preadipocytes,
  endothelial cells, and infiltrating immune cells, including NK cells, T cells, and
  macrophages. Adipocytes are highly responsive to many hormones and growth factors
  that utilize the JAK/STAT pathway. The receptors for these ligands are indicated
  in the diagram. Infiltrating immune cells also produce cytokines which likely act
  in a paracrine fashion to induce JAK/STAT signaling in adipocytes. Adipocytes also
  have important endocrine properties and four JAK/STAT activating hormones have been
  shown to be produced from adipocytes.
