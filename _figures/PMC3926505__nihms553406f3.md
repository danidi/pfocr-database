caption: 'Roles of Cu in synaptic function. Cu enters cells through CTR1 and binds
  to cytosolic chaperones including Atox-1, which delivers Cu to ATP7A. Cu gains entry
  into the secretory pathway through ATP7A and is stored in LDCVs along with secreted
  cuproenzymes DβM, SOD3 and PAM. Influx of Ca2+ through NMDARs and VGCCs results
  in LDCV release and Cu secretion. This calcium signal also facilitates long-term
  potentiation post-synaptically. Extracellularly, Cu has inhibitory effects on NMDARs,
  VGCCs and GABAARs. Cu binds PrP and APP, which are located at synapses. Upon binding
  of Cu, PrP can be internalized or can interact with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA
  receptor, attenuating ion flux. APP binds Cu at attomolar concentrations, facilitating
  the multiple cleavages that yield extracellular Aβ, which also binds Cu with high
  affinity. Aβ can abrogate the inhibitory effect of PrP on the NMDA receptor by sequestering
  Cu or by binding to PrP. Abbreviations: Aβ, beta amyloid peptide; AMPAR, 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-
  oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid receptor; APP, amyloid precursor protein; Ca++, calcium;
  CTR1, Cu transporter 1; GABAAR, γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor; LDCV, large dense-core
  vesicle; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; PrP, prion protein; PSD, post-synaptic
  density; VGCC, voltage-gated Ca++ channel.'
