caption: 'Biosynthesis of β-carotene via both the MEP and MVA pathways used in this
  study. DMAPP and IPP, precursors for β-carotene biosynthesis are synthesized via
  both the MEP and MVA pathways. The MVA pathway was divided into two portions, the
  upper (acetyl-CoA to MVA) and lower (MVA to IPP and DMAPP). The upper portion is
  composed of the mvaE (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), mvaS (HMG-CoA synthase) and
  mvaE (HMG-CoA reductase) genes, which are from E. faecalis, while the lower is composed
  of the Erg12 (mevalonate kinase), Erg8 (phosphomevalonate kinase), Erg19 (diphosphomevalonate
  decarboxylase) and idi1 (IPP isomerase) genes, which are from S. cerevisiae. DMAPP
  and IPP are converted to GPP by IspA (GPP/FPP synthase) from E. coli and by GPPS2
  (GPP synthase) from A. grandis. FPP is transformed into β-carotene via the foreign
  carotenoid synthesis pathway which includes crtE (GGPP synthase), crtB (phytoene
  synthase), crtI (phytoene desaturase) and crtY (lycopene cyclase) from E. herbicola.
