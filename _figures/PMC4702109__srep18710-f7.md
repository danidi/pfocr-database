caption: When cells are exposed to osmotic stress, WNK4 Ser575 phosphorylation is
  increased via the p38MAPK-MK pathway. ASK3 is required for the p38MAPK activation
  induced by hypotonic stimulation. In case of hypertonic stimulation or hypotonic
  low-chloride stimulation, other MAP3K would be involved in triggering p38MAPK activation.
  However the function of Ser575 phosphorylation remains unknown, our results suggest
  that the p38MAPK-MK pathway might regulate WNK4 in an osmotic stress-dependent manner.
