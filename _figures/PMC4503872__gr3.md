caption: 'Results from a transcriptomic analysis of the OCM: Downregulated genes were,
  dependening on their level colored in green, upregulated in red. The analyzed cell
  lines are from the left to the right: U2OS osteosarcoma treated with ibandronate
  and simvastatin; PC-3 prostate cancer cells treated with ibandronate. The labels
  are the actual gene names according to the NCBI gene database. Abbreviations: MTHFD,
  methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase;
  DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; TYMS, thymidylate synthetase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase;
  AHCYL1, adenosylhomocysteinase-like 1; MTR, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
  methyltransferase; DNMT1, DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1; MAT2B, methionine
  adenosyltransferase II, beta.'
