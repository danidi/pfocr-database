caption: The dynamic regulation of intracellular NAD+ levels. Intracellular NAD+ levels
  are highly dynamic and are regulated by NAD+-producing and NAD+-consuming pathways
  as well as by cellular respiration. Three NAD+-producing pathways have been identified,
  which are the (i) de novo synthesis pathway (ii) the Preiss–Handler, and (iii) the
  NAD+-salvage pathway. Each pathway uses different precursor molecules and enzymes
  for the synthesis of NAD+. The precursor molecules surrounded by boxes are obtained
  from the diet. Similarly, three NAD+-consuming pathways have been identified and
  they include the (i) sirtuins (SIRTs) (ii) the PARPs, and (iii) the cADPR synthases
  known as CD38 and CD157, which are reported to exist both intra- and extracellularly
  (only depicted as extracellularly in the figure). NAD+ levels are further regulated
  by cellular redox reactions involved in cellular respiration, where NAD+ plays a
  role as a coenzyme. Enzymes of glycolysis reduce NAD+ in the cytoplasm, whereas
  the TCA cycle enzymes reduce additional NAD+ molecules in the mitochondria. Reducing
  equivalents of cytoplasmic NAD+ are then transferred to the mitochondrion through
  the G3P and MAS enzymes, ultimately reaching the electron transport chain complexes,
  where they get oxidized to generate the proton gradient necessary for ATP production.
  Another important factor regulating NAD+ not depicted in this figure is the circdian
  regulation of NAD+ by the circadian genes. cADPR, cyclic ADP ribose; G3P, glycerol-3-phoshate;
