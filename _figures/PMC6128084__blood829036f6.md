caption: Overview of cellular metabolism for heme synthesis during early and late
  erythropoiesis. A cartoon of a cell is shown where the plasma membrane is a heavy
  blue line, and the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes are red with intermembrane
  space in light pink. Plasma membrane transporters for glucose, glycine, and glutamine
  are orange; mitochondrial inner membrane transporters for glutamate, glycine, ALA,
  and pyruvate are green. The heme biosynthetic pathway is abbreviated as a dashed
  arrow, but is shown in its entirety in supplemental Figure 1. Heme, the end product,
  exits the mitochondrial matrix following its release from FECH, but the pathway
  for this is currently undetermined. The TCA cycle is in blue with the enzymes KDH
  and SCS see text) shown boxed in the figure. The site of inhibition by AOA is illustrated
  with a bold red X. Multiple glutamine transaminases exist within the cell, and all
  are inhibited by AOA. (A) Cellular metabolism for late erythropoiesis when large
  quantities of heme are necessary for hemoglobinization of the developing erythron.
  Inside the mitochondrion are shown the pathways of glutamate to ALA with KDH in
  complex with ALAS2 and the previously described heme metabolon (Heme Metab.) as
  a red pentagon. (B) Cellular metabolism during early erythropoiesis when heme for
  cellular functions is synthesized utilizing ALAS1. Under these conditions, the amounts
  of heme synthesized are relatively low, and the required succinyl-CoA can be provided
  by the TCA cycle.
