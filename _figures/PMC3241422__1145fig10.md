caption: 'Control of Rho1 activity through the cell cycle. Rho1 is activated at three
  sites through the cell cycle: the incipient bud site and bud tip during wall expansion,
  the mother/bud neck during mitosis, and between the septin rings during cytokinesis.
  Rho1’s recruitment and activation at these sites involves different regulators and
  is likely to result in the activation of only a subset of effectors. The secondary
  septum is cell wall material that is distinct from the primary septum, which is
  chitin produced by Chs2. GS, glucan synthase; CAR, contractile actin ring.'
