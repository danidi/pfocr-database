caption: Schematic representation of a mechanism of action for cannabinoid based multi-target
  drugs. The novel strategy for the pain treatment is based on altering more than
  one enzymatic reaction and/or nociceptive pathway. Anandamide (AEA) is hydrolyzed
  into arachidonic acid (AA) and ethanolamine (ETA) principally by fatty acid amide
  hydrolase (FAAH). In addition to its hydrolysis by FAAH, AEA is metabolized by COX-2.
  On the other hand, COX metabolizes AA, leading to increase in pro-inflammatory prostaglandins
  (PG). AEA can act on transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member
  1 (TRPV1) activating pro-nociceptive pathways or through cannabinoid receptor 1/2
  (CB1/2) pathway leading to alleviation of pain. Although, in the molecular stress
  conditions elevation of AEA occurs, FAAH and COX quickly metabolize it. Therefore,
  there are three pathways that may increase anti-nociceptive properties of AEA; (1)
  inhibition of FAAH enzyme, that leads to an increase in AEA level and a decrease
  in AA level; (2) inhibition of COX enzyme, that leads to an increase in AEA level
  and a decrease in PG level; (3) antagonism of TRPV1 receptor, which prevents activation
  of pro-nociceptive pathway by AEA. Action on more than one molecular target lowers
  the redundancy of the system and may lead to obtaining more stable and robust response
  in pain alleviation. (PGI—prostacyclins; TXA—thromboxanes).
