caption: Glycolytic pathway in trypanosomatids. The figure shows the glycolytic pathway
  as occurs in trypanosomatids. Seven of the glycolytic enzymes are compartmentalized
  in glycosomes. The enzymes involved in the pathway are (1) hexokinase (2) glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase (3) phosphofructokinase (4) aldolase (5) triosephosphate isomerase (6)
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (7) phosphoglycerate kinase (8) glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (9) glycerol kinase (10) phosphoglycerate mutase (11) enolase (12)
  pyruvate kinase
