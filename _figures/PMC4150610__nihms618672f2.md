caption: Interferon (IFN)-inducible proteins are required for host resistance to intracellular
  bacteria, a Specific immunity-related GTPases (IRGs).guanylate-binding proteins
  (GBPs) and other GTPases translocate to compartmentalized bacteria in phagosomes
  or inclusion bodies. Here, different membrane regulatory complexes — IRGM1-snapin,
  GBP1-sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) and GBP7–ATG4B — are assembled. These complexes initiate
  autophagic capture and SNARE-mediated fusion of the bacterial compartments with
  lysosomes,–. In addition, IRGM3-IRGA6 (or IRGB10) mediate vacuole disruption,,,
  and GBP7 (and possibly leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)) help to assemble NADPH
  oxidase 2 (NOX2) on bacterial phagosomes, which mediates bacterial killing. Using
  this pathway, these GTPases can also deliver antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to the
  autophagolysosome and, in the case of human IRGM, may instigate mitochondrial fission
  before autophagy. Other IFN-inducible components, such as natural resistance-associated
  macrophage protein 1 (N RAMP1), help to exclude Mn2+ and Fe2+ from the bacterial
  phagosome, while importing protons (H+) into this compartment. Nitric oxide synthase
  2 (NOS2), which synthesizes NO, works in concert with NOX2, which produces reactive
  oxygen species such as superoxide (O2−)and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), to produce
  compound intermediates like peroxynitrite (not shown) that are highly bactericidal.
  b An emerging signature for the recognition of some escaped bacteria in the cytosol
  is ubiquitylation (eithersingle or multiple modifications with monoubiquitin and/or
  polyubiquitin chains) (see REF. ). SQSTM1, NDP52 and optineurin bind to ubiquitylated
  bacteria to initiate innate immune signalling and to recruit the autophagic machinery
  via LC3 family members. In addition, GBP1 and GBP2 polymerize around cytosolic bacteria
  in a ubiquitin-independent process that may recruit specific antimicrobial partners,
  while galectin 3 and galectin 8 bind to exposed glycans on the bacteria and, in
  the case of galectin 8, recruit NDP52 and downstream autophagic effectors. SQSTM1
  also activates a second antibacterial pathway involving diacylglycerol(DAG)and protein
  kinase Cδ(PKCδ)to induce NOX2 complex assembly. Dashed lines indicate possible routes
  and consequences. Ptdlns(4,B)P2, phosphatidylinositol-4,B-bisphosphate; Ptdlns(3,4,B)P3,phosphatidylinositol-3,4,B-trisphosphate;TBK1,TANK-binding
