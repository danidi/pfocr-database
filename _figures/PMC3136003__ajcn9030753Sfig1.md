caption: Model illustrating the signaling effectors downstream of the umami receptor
  T1R1/T1R3. Receptor binding activates Gβ3γ13, which in turn activates phospholipase
  C β2 (PLCβ2), to produce the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and
  diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds type III IP3 receptor (IP3R3) to elicit release
  of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and subsequent Ca2+ activation of TRPM5, which
  results in taste cell depolarization and release of ATP onto gustatory afferent
  fibers. In fungiform and palate taste buds, Gα gustducin or Gα transducin activates
  phosphodiesterase (PDE) to decrease intracellular cAMP concentrations. In circumvallate
  and foliate taste buds, cAMP is also decreased by activation of Gα, but likely by
  inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) (dashed line) rather than by activation of PDE.
  The target of the decreased cAMP is not known, but cAMP antagonizes responses to
  umami stimuli in physiologic studies, which suggests that it may modulate the sensitivity
  of the PLC signaling pathway.
