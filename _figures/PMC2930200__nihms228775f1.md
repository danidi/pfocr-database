caption: The major transcription factors involved in the promyelinating to myelinating
  transition are depicted with their regulatory relationship. Arrows indicate activation
  while blunt lines indicate repression. This regulatory pathway culminates in induction
  of several genes in myelinating Schwann cells, such as Myelin protein zero (Mpz),
  Myelin basic protein (Mbp), Connexin 32 (Cx32), and HMG CoA reductase. See text
  for further details.
