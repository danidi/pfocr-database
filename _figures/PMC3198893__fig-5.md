caption: One of the networks of genes strongly induced in dendritic cells but less
  so, unchanged, or suppressed in macrophages. (The legend is the same as in .) The
  network was constructed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (www.ingenuity.com). The gray-colored
  nodes are genes inferred to be expressed at high levels in dendritic cells but not
  in macrophages, regardless of the bacteria type or species. White-colored nodes
  are genes interacting with such induced genes. Many known dendritic immune response
  genes are present in this network. CD86 is an essential costimulatory molecule and
  is also a marker of dendritic cell maturation. TAP is involved in the transportation
  of peptides generated by the proteosome from the cytosol to endoplasmic reticulum,
  which is an important step in MHC class I antigen presentation, a major function
  of dendritic cells. The profiles of CD86 are shown in .
