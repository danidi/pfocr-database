caption: Phospholipids have a glycerol backbone and an esterified phosphate moiety
  at the sn-3 position that may also be esterified to a polar head group, such as
  choline, ethanolamine, glycerol, serine, inositol or phosphatidylglycerol. In the
  sn-2 position, a fatty acid moiety is esterified to the glycerol backbone. In the
  sn-1 position, there may be a second esterified fatty acid residue or there may
  be a saturated ether linkage to a fatty alcohol residue or a vinyl ether linkage
  to a fatty aldehdye residue. Phospholipases C cleave the diglyceride moiety from
  the phospho-headgroup. Phospholipases D cleave the polar head group from the phosphatidic
  acid moiety. Phospholipases A1 hydrolyze the sn-1 fatty acid substituent from the
  glycerol backbone to yield a free fatty acid and a 1-lysophospholipid, and Phospholipases
  A2 (PLA2) cleave the sn-2 substituent from the glycerol backbone to yield a free
  fatty acid and a 2-lysophospholipid. The products of PLA2 action on the phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) species illustrated in the figure are arachidonic acid and 2-lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC). Downstream effects of PLA2 action may arise from intrinsic actions of the
  fatty acid product or of its metabolites, such as oxygenated eicosanoids, or from
  actions of the lysophospholipid products or its metabolites. In the case of LPC,
  such metabolites could include the bioactive product lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),
  and an alkyl ether LPC species could also be acetylated to yield the lipid mediator
  Platelet Activating Factor (PAF), e.g., 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.
  Other downstream effects of PLA2 action can arise from remodeling or loss of the
  phospholipid substrate. With Group VIA PLA2 (iPLA2β) examples of downstream effects
  attributable to each of these possibilities are thought to occur. The free fatty
  acid arachidonic acid derived from iPLA2β action in pancreatic islet β-cells is
  thought to activate voltage-operated K+ channels,. A 12/15lipoxygenase product from
  iPLA2β-derived free arachidonic acid is thought to activate a RhoA kinase pathway
  to vascular smooth muscle cell activation in diabetic vasculopathy. LPC derived
  from iPLA2β action is thought to participate in CREB-mediated activation of transcriptional
  responses to viral infection in macrophages, and LPA derived from iPLA2β action
  is thought to stimulate macrophage migration into sites of vascular inflammation
  in diabetes. Ether linked LPC derived from iPLA2β action appears to provide substrate
  for PAF biosynthesis in inflamed endothelial cells,,. iPLA2β also appears to participate
  in the repair of oxidized cardiolipin species in mitochondria by excising oxygenated
  fatty acid residues, and with overwhelming mitochondrial injury this may lead to
  cytochrome c release and initiation of apoptosis–.
