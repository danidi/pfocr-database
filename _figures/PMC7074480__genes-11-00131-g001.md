caption: The mechanism of action of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like
  receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The priming
  step involves the recognition of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)
  or a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) by a specific pattern recognition
  receptors (PRR), which activates the NF-κB pathway to release precursor forms of
  IL-1β and IL-18 into the cytoplasm. NLRP3 is turned on by lysosome-mediated cathepsin
  B, K+ efflux, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via dysfunctional mitochondria,
  the release of mitochondrial DNA in oxidized form, and alterations in Ca2+ concentration.
  The oligomerization and activation of NLRP3 take place after it interacts with the
  leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NEK7. This event is followed by the cleavage
  of pro-caspase 1 into caspase 1, which converts pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their
  respective mature forms, which are finally released from the cell via pores generated
  by gasdermin D (GSDMD) (N-terminal fragments).
