caption: Identified B lymphocyte‐induced maturation protein‐1 (Blimp‐1) targets in
  mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs). Blimp‐1, encoded by Prdm1, represses interleukin
  (IL)‐6 directly and indirectly by regulating the levels of the microRNA (miRNA)
  let‐7c and SOCS1·,  It also represses cathepsin S (CTSS) directly and indirectly
  via repression of IL‐6·,  By downregulating CTSS and CIITA, Blimp‐1 directly influences
  both antigen‐processing and ‐presentation by interfering with transcription of MHC
  Class II‐dependent genes. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)4 induces Blimp‐1 transcription
  and negatively regulates CST3, an inhibitor of CTSS, thereby allowing Blimp‐1‐mediated
  fine‐tuning of the antigen‐processing and ‐presentation machinery. Blimp‐1 also
  directly represses CCL2 and CCL8,,  and has been implicated to regulate CXCL10 as
  well as SIGLEC1, IFNλ1 and possibly CD86, which are all components of a pro‐inflammatory
  response. On the other hand, Blimp‐1 can enhance activation by repressing the NFkB/TNFR
  pathway repressor NLRP12· These regulatory mechanisms of Blimp‐1 in the antigen‐processing
  and presentation as well co‐activation/pro‐inflammatory mediation, are likely to
  be operative upon pattern recognition receptor (PRR) engagement in MNPs. Additionally,
  RANK‐RANKL interaction (not shown) induces Blimp‐1‐mediated repression of anti‐osteoclastogenic
  genes Bcl‐6, IRF8 and MafB,, ,  assigning a central role to Blimp‐1 in osteoclast
  development. Solid lines indicate genes shown to be directly repressed by Blimp‐1,
  and dotted lines indicate Blimp‐1 repression by a currently unknown mechanism.
