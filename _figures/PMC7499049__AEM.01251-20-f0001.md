caption: Pathways to the synthesis of lysergic acid amides and dihydrolysergic acid
  amides. Both pathways begin with the same core set of genes (dmaW, easF, easE, easC,
  and easD) and branch at easA depending on the allele present in a species. The pathway
  branch to the right (with red labeling) leads to lysergic acid amides, as are found
  in M. brunneum (), with a further branch to ergopeptines (labeled in orange), as
  found in Claviceps purpurea and several Epichloë species (, , ). Red font is used
  to mark the carbons present in the D ring of ergoline nucleus. The pathway branch
  to the left (with blue labeling) leads to dihydroergot alkaloids as found naturally
  in C. africana () or in previously engineered strains of N. fumigata (, ). The dihydroergot
  alkaloid pathway features a further branch, shown in pink, that occurs in no natural
  species but whose formation is a subject of this paper. Double arrows represent
  multiple enzymatic steps. Enzymes with hypothesized roles are marked by parentheses.
  Trp, l-tryptophan; DMAPP, dimethylallylpyrophosphate.
