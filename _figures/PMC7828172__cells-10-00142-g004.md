caption: Targeting ROR1 with small molecules and immunotherapy—a selection of agents.
  While KAN0441571C functions as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and already meets clinical
  evaluation, the inhibitor ARI-1, binding to the CRD of ROR1, is still in preclinical
  development. The most advanced monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting ROR1 is cirmtuzumab.
  Other antibody-based targeting options comprise VLS-101, an antibody drug conjugate
  linking cirmtuzumab to MMAE, or bispecific antibodies such as ROR1 × CD3 or NBE-002.
  ROR1 is also an attractive target for chimeric antigen receptor-engineered (CAR)
  T cells since it does not lead to B cell depletion. Strictinin is a newly discovered,
  plant-derived tannin, which seemingly interacts with ROR1 and inhibits PI3K/AKT/GSK-3
  activity.
