caption: Potential mechanisms involved in hypoxia-induced systemic hypertension. Increased
  NADPH oxidase (NOX)- and mitochondria (mito)-derived ROS stimulated by intermittent
  decreases in pO2 in multiple systems is speculated to be associated with sleep apnea
  in humans. Placental hypoxia-induced ROS generation also appears to promote preeclampsia.
  Increases in vascular smooth muscle calcium and activation of Rho kinase by various
  factors and cytokines released during hypoxia could be a common pathway leading
  to vasoconstriction and hypertension. Additionally, we speculate loss of NO derived
  from NOS leading to decreased activation of PKG may influence vascular smooth muscle
  contractile phenotype protein expression and remodeling which contribute to increases
  in systemic blood pressure.
