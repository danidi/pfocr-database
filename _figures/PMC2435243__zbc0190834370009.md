caption: Several signaling pathways work together in the  TGFβ1-induced expression
  of CCN2/CTGF in primary human gingival  fibroblasts. Cdc42, Rac1, and Ras are small
  GTPases involved in the  TGFβ1-stimulated expression of CCN2/CTGF whose activity
  relies upon the  availability of products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.
  Proposed  stimulation of protease secretion in response to stimulation with TGFβ1  may
  result in the activation of protease-activated receptors and ultimately  lead to
  the activation of Ras to prolong CCN2/CTGF expression in these cells  (hypothetical
  pathway indicated by broken arrows). TGFβ1 and LPA  both stimulate CCN2/CTGF expression
  in gingival cells with TGFβ1 being  the more potent inducer. Both TGFβ1 and LPA
  stimulate the activating  phosphorylation of JNK1 and nuclear localization of phosphorylated
  Smad3. JNK1  does not, however, enhance Smad3 nuclear localization in gingival fibroblasts  but
  is required for TGFβ1 stimulation of CCN2/CTGF expression  (). LPA induces only
  a weak  nuclear localization of Smad3. Data support that although LPA stimulates  signaling
  pathways also stimulated by TGFβ1, LPA and TGFβ1 each  uniquely stimulate a subset
  of complementary parallel signaling events that  result in additive up-regulation
  of CCN2/CTGF levels in gingival  fibroblasts.
