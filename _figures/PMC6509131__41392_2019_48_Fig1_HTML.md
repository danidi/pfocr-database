caption: Regulation model of serotonin. a Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, functions
  through the serotonergic signaling pathway. b MLL and SET1 mediate H3K4me3 methylation
  and regulate gene expression. c The H3K4me3Q5ser double modification enhances the
  interaction of histone with certain H3K4me3 ‘reader’ proteins, such as TFIID, and
  then reinforces permissive patterns of gene expression
