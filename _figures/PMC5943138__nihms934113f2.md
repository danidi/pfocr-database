caption: In the classical pathway of B cell development, pro-B cells experience strong
  IL-7R signaling, which activates the JAK/STAT pathway leading to active, phosphorylated
  (p) STAT5. Igk recombination is suppressed by pSTAT5 in IL-7R+ pro-B cells, which
  undergo VH-DJH recombination at the Igh locus, and is induced only after the pre-BCR
  transition in small IL-7R− pre-B cells containing low pSTAT5 levels. In contrast,
  IL-7R/pSTAT5 signaling is low already in fetal and neonatal pro-B cells, leading
  to efficient Igk rearrangements concomitant with Igh recombination, which directly
  generates mature BCRs. If an autoreactive BCR is generated, it is stimulated by
  self-antigen (red dots), which results in proliferative cell expansion and commitment
  to the B-1a cell lineage by bypassing the pre-BCR stage. The model of the alternative
  developmental pathway is based on recently published data [].
