caption: Overview of the apoptosis pathway and potential targets for pharmacological
  modulation. Pro-apoptotic factors are illustrated in red and prosurvival factors
  in green. Apoptosis can be initiated by multiple factors. Extrinsic pro-apoptotic
  pathways are activated when death ligands such as Fas ligand (FasL), TNFα and TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) bind on death receptors (DR) such as Fas, TNFR1
  and DR4/5, respectively. These receptors contain a death domain (DD) on the cytoplasmic
  side of the cell membrane, which can interact with other DD-containing proteins.
  The TNFα pathway is illustrated in more detail in . Upon binding of FasL to Fas
  or TRAIL to DR4/5, Fas-associated death domain (FADD) is recruited. Consequently,
  FADD recruits pro-caspase 8 and converts it to active caspase 8. When caspase 8
  is inhibited, for example by nitrosylation (due to high levels of NO production),
  or by peroxidation resulting from oxidative stress inside the plaque, a switch from
  apoptosis to necroptosis is observed, as further depicted in . Other pro-apoptotic
  pathways include the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by pathogen
  associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and ER stress, both generating active caspases
  9 and 12. Prolonged ER stress can activate the unfolded protein response (UPR),
  of which CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) has been demonstrated
  to be a crucial pro-apoptotic effector in macrophages. CHOP promotes Ca2+ release
  from the ER, which in turn promotes activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase II (CamKII). The latter can induce Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria which
  alters their membrane potential, thereby triggering the release of pro-apoptotic
  proteins, such as cytochrome C. Cytochrome C forms, together with caspase 9 and
  apaf-1, a complex called the apoptosome which also activates the effector caspases
  of apoptosis. Intrinsic pro-apoptotic pathways are activated upon exposure to ER
  stress, along with other cellular stressors or damage associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs). They can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways
  which provide either pro-apoptotic (through JNK or p38 activation) or prosurvival
  signals (through ERK1/2 activation). The protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin
  and cycloheximide are known to induce macrophage apoptosis through the p38 MAPK
  pathway. The pro-apoptotic pathways eventually lead to the activation of effector
  caspases 3, 6, and 7 which induce DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing and cell
  shrinkage, all key features of apoptosis. Apoptosis can be pharmacologically inhibited
  by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk.
