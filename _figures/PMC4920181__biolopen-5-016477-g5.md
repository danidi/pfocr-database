caption: 'An illustration showing roles or functions of analyzed retinal disease-related
  genes. Localization and functions of analyzed retinal disease-related genes are
  illustrated based on previously reported papers. Gene names written in black and
  red here indicate that expression of those genes was detected in CRX-transduced
  PBMCs and in modified culture conditions, respectively (,). Expression of genes
  written in white was not detected in any culture conditions. Localization is categorized
  into disc, cilium, inner segment (IS) and nucleus. Phototransduction: in opsins
  (rhodopsin, blue opsin, red/green opsins), 11-cis retinal is isomerized to all-trans-retinal
  by absorption of photons. All-trans-retinol is converted from all-trans-retinal
  by RDH12 and carried by RBP3/4. Activated opsins in turn activate G protein transducin
  α subunit (GNAT1/2), and GNAT1/2 activates PDE6A/H. PDE6A/H hydrolyses cGMP to GMP.
  cGMP is synthesized by guanylyl cyclase (GUCY2D), which reaction is regulated by
  guanylyl cyclase activating protein (GUCA1A/B) and RD3. CNG channels are composed
  of CNGA (CNGA1/3) and CNGB (CNGB1/3) subunits. CNG channels are kept open by cGMP
  for influx of potassium and calcium ion (; ). RBP3 (equal to IRBP) and RBP4 bind
  and protect 11-cis or all-trans retinoids, and transport these retinoids between
  the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors (). RPE65 is expressed in mammalian
  cone cells as well as retinal pigment epithelium and synthesize 11-cis-retinol from
  all-trans-retinyl ester (). RGR (retinal G protein coupled 2eceptor) binds all-trans-retinal
  and converts it to 11-cis retinal (). RDH12 (retinol dehydrogenase 12) was reported
  to play roles for retinoid cycle (). Cilium constructing proteins: RP1, RP1L1, MAK,
  RPGRIP1, NPHP1, CC2D2A and C2ORF71 are relating to ciliogenesis and/or function
  of the photoreceptor cilium. Those were reported about their expressions around
  transition zone (). Ectodomains of USH2A (Aliases are Usherin or USH2) and GPR98
  (equal to ADGRV1, USH2B, USH2C, VLGR1) connect USH1G (equal to SANS) ant these complexes
  construct USH protein network and are related to vesicle delivery along microtubules.
  PCDH15 (equal to USH1F or CDHR15) is essential for maintenance photoreceptors (;
  ). Others: KCNV2 is voltage-gated potassium channel subunit (). CRB1 (Crumbs homolog
  1) constructs zonula adherens and maintains photoreceptor morphogenesis (). The
  autosomal recessive mutation tubby (tub), which show retinal degeneration, occurred
  spontaneously in C57BL/6J (B6) mice (). TLR3 (toll-like receptor 3) protect photoreceptors
  from oxidative stress (). Norrin, FZD4 and TSPAN12 have been suggested to participate
  in Norrin signal pathway and their protective roles from cell death by light damage
  (). OTX2 and CRX are expressed in photoreceptor precursors (; ). NR2E3 promotes
  differentiation to rod photoreceptors () and COUPTFs regulate S- or M-opsin expression
  ().'
