caption: Elementary flux pattern belonging to an aspartate-producing pathway. (Bold
  arrows) The reactions of the elementary flux pattern (i.e., they belong to the subsystem).
  The species entering the subsystem are acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate via the alternate
  glyoxylate-producing pathway presented in . (Dashed lines) Condensed reaction. Selected
  fluxes are given. A list of abbreviations can be found in Supplemental materials
  S2 and S3.
