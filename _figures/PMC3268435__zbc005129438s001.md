caption: 'Proposed model for coupling of carbohydrate catabolism to photo-H2 production
  in Cyanothece where nonphotochemical reduction of PQ by catabolically derived NAD(P)H
  is the primary source of reductant for PSI-dependent, nitrogenase-mediated photo-H2.
  Sites of proton pumping coupled to ATP generation are denoted by blue arrows, and
  sites of inhibitor action are denoted with a red X. An abbreviated scheme of carbohydrate
  catabolism showing the reduction of NADH by glycolysis and the reduction of NADPH
  by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPP) is shown in the inset at left.
  Stoichiometries are not included. Abbreviations: CHO, carbohydrates; G6P, glucose
  6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde phosphate; PYR, pyruvate; Ac-CoA, acetyl coenzyme-A;
  QA and QB, PSII-bound plastoquinone molecules; PQ, the pool of membrane soluble
  plastoquinones; b6f, cytochrome b6f, FNR, ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase; N2ase,
  nitrogenase; TH, pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase; [NiFe]-H2ase, bidirectional
  hydrogenase.'
