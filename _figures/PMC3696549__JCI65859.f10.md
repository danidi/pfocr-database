caption: Ectopic upregulation of TLR4 and its activation by LPS induce the pluripotency
  factor NANOG, other stem cell genes, and self-renewal of TICs. NANOG induces IGF2BP3
  and YAP1, which in turn inhibit TGF-β signaling at the level of SMAD3 phosphoactivation
  and p-SMAD3 nuclear translocation. The former effect is dependent on the IGF2BP3/AKT/mTOR
  pathway, while the latter is caused by p-YAP1/SMAD7/SMAD3 interactions, which are
  enhanced by IGF2BP3/AKT–mediated YAP1 phosphorylation. Restoration of the TGF-β
  tumor suppressor pathway by silencing IGF2BP3 and YAP1 downregulates TLR4 via SMAD3-mediated
  transcriptional repression and inhibits TLR4/NANOG–mediated TIC self-renewal and
  oncogenic activity while chemosensitizing TICs. A defective canonical TGF-β pathway,
  as in Spnb+/– mice, upregulates TLR4 by transcriptional derepression and activates
  the TLR4/NANOG oncogenic pathway for liver tumorigenesis.
