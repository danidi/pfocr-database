caption: 'Shown are the major signaling pathways involved in the regulation of spine
  remodeling and synaptic plasticity, including NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptor subtypes,
  neurotrophic factors (i.e., BDNF), and related downstream signaling, particularly
  the ERK and Akt pathways. Long-term synaptic plasticity and spine formation require
  protein synthesis, which is regulated in dendrites by activity-dependent activation
  of the mTOR pathway. Recent studies demonstrate that the rapid synaptogenic and
  behavioral actions of ketamine are also dependent on mTOR signaling and protein
  synthesis. Less is known about the mechanisms underlying the atrophy of spines and
  dendrites in response to stress, but it is possible that inhibition of neurotrophic
  factor levels, mTOR signaling and synaptic protein synthesis could contribute to
  the effects of stress.Abbreviations: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; TrkB,
  tropomysin related kinase (BDNF receptor); NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate
  receptor; AMPA, amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid glutamate receptor;
  PSD-95; postsynaptic density protein 95; MEK, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP)
  kinase kinase; CaMK, calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase; PI3K, phophotydilinositol-3
  kinase; ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin.'
