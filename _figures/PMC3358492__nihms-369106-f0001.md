caption: Shown is a simplified model of how aberrant IFNα production can occur in
  SLE patients. Inherently abnormal T and B lymphocyte signaling in conjunction with
  innate immune stimulation via endogenous and/or exogenous triggers leads to a vicious
  cycle of autoantibody-immune complex signaling. The putative autoantigens in SLE
  form complexes with a myriad of autoantibodies produced in SLE. These complexes
  have been shown to trigger TLR signaling in antigen-presenting cells, in particular
  TLR7 and TLR9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). These endosomal ligands can
  also physiologically be triggered by viral or bacterial nucleic acids. The DNA/RNA
  molecules could be released from either pathogens or commensals which then amplify
  the IFNα circuit in SLE patients. Endosomal TLR7/9 signaling leads to interferon
  regulator factor (IRF) 5/7 activation and induction of IFNα gene production. Translated
  and secreted IFNα can in turn stimulate T and B cells as well as augment TLR signaling,
  closing the cycle that leads to ongoing IFNα pathway activation. Shown in red are
  some of the current approaches described in the main text that attenuate this vicious
  cycle. A, blockade of TLR signaling (at various levels) via novel TLR7/9 inhibitors;
  B, endosomal inhibition of TLR7/9 with antimalarials like hydroxychloroquine (which
  is only one of many modes of action of antimalarials); C, direct targeting of IFNα
  via monoclonal antibodies; D, indirect targeting of IFNα using a kinoid that leads
  to an endogenous T- and B-cell mediated anti-IFNα response after vaccination.
