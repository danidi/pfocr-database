caption: Transcriptional regulatory network of leaf senescence regulated by light
  signaling. Under red light, PIF4 and PIF5 are degraded through a phyB-mediated proteasomal
  degradation pathway, leading to the inactivation of PIF-dependent promotion of leaf
  senescence. In darkness, however, phyB exists in the inactive Pr state, which allows
  PIF4 and PIF5 to activate the expression of ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), ABSCISIC
  ACID INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), and ENHANCED EM LEVEL (EEL). Then PIFs, together with
  EIN3, ABI5, and EEL, form a feedforward loop to activate the expression of ORE1.
  Among the proteins that act downstream of PIF4 and PIF5, ORE1 is involved in feedforward
  loops that activate genes, encoding chlorophyll degradation enzymes, repressing
  GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) genes, which encode transcriptional activators of photosynthesis
  and chlorophyll biosynthesis-related genes. In the circadian oscillator, the EARLY
  FLOWERING3 (ELF3)–ELF4–LUX evening complex (EC) represses the expression of PIF4
  and PIF5 as well as that of MYC2, which encodes a key TF involved in jasmonate signaling,
  while CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), a core component of the circadian oscillator,
  activates the expression of GLK genes and represses the expression of ORE1. WRKY6,
  which encodes a senescence-associated WRKY TF, is negatively and positively regulated
  by phyA- and phyB-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. Solid lines indicate
  direct regulation, while dashed lines indicate indirect regulation. CCGs, chlorophyll
  catabolic genes; PGs, photosynthesis genes; CBGs, chlorophyll biosynthetic genes.
