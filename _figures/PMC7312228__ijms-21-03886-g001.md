caption: Schematic representation of complement activation. Proximal complement activation
  initiated by any of the three pathways (classical, alternative, or lectin pathway)
  leads to C3 activation and C3 convertase formation on C3-opsonized surfaces. C3
  activation through the alternative pathway of complement amplifies this response
  (APC amplification loop, shown in dotted lines), culminating in pronounced C3 fragment
  deposition on target cells. In the presence of increased surface density of deposited
  C3b, the terminal (lytic) pathway is triggered, leading to membrane attack complex
  (MAC) formation on the surface of target cells. C3a and C5a mediate complement interactions
  with inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial cell activation. These alterations
  are also triggered by CAR (chimeric antigen receptor)-T cell toxicity syndromes,
  including CRS (cytokine release syndrome) and neurotoxicity.
