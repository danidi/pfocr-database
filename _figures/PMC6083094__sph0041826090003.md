caption: Lipid metabolism pathway of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, observed
  SNPs, and relative abundance changes of key lipids and transcripts between WT and
  HLDR isolates. (A and B) The PG (A) and CL (B) lipid synthesis pathways were constructed
  with KEGG. A total of 8 WT and HLDR isolate paired genomes were compared and nonsynonymous
  single nucleotide polymorphisms identified. The names and structures of the metabolites
  are on the left, with key lipids colored in red and green. R1 represents the 16:0
  carbon chain, and R2 represents the 18:1 carbon chain. The enzyme nomenclature for
  each enzymatic step and the corresponding genes are located next to the appropriate
  synthesis arrow. SNP mutations for each enzyme/gene unit are indicated at the far
  right with the number of mutations among the 8 HLDR isolates, unless no mutations
  were present in any of the isolates. Except for pgsA2, none of the lipid synthesis
  genes for PG have SNPs. On the left side, black bars indicate the functional completeness
  of the PG synthesis pathway. The WT strain proceeds through the entire synthesis
  pathway producing PG, while the HLDR strain ends at the production of CDP-DAG. The
  green coloring of the lipid CDP-DAG indicates a 543-fold to 5,946-fold buildup of
  that metabolite in the HLDR isolates compared to the WT. The red coloring of PG
  and cardiolipin indicates a reduction of that metabolite in the HLDR isolates compared
  to the WT with a 369- to 1,990-fold reduction in PG. (C) Expression levels of genes
  involved in lipid synthesis pathways were not significantly altered in HLDR isolates
  (P > 0.05). Expression levels of the housekeeping genes rpoA and gyrA were also
  not significantly altered (P > 0.05).
