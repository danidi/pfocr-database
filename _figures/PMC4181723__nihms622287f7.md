caption: 'Proposed TLR signaling mechanism by CS14K: a hypothetical model of TLR4
  signaling, pathway activated by fusion protein, in a MyD88-independent fashion.
  Inhibition of p65 movement to the nucleus by CS14K prevents the action of NF-κB
  while activation of IRF-3 and STAT-1 leads to elevated levels of NO, IL-6, and TNF-a,
  which could inhibit the growth of parasites.'
