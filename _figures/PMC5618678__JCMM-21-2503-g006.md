caption: Schematic of proposed signalling involved in protective effects of MG53 on
  HIR injury. Hepatocyte cell membrane was damaged by ischaemia/hypoxia and aggravated
  by reperfusion/reoxygenation. Apoptosis is a main cell death pathway of hepatocytes
  subjected to ischaemia/reperfusion or hypoxia/reoxygenation. MG53 could promote
  repair of damaged cell membrane anchored by dysferlin, accompanied with decrease
  of hepatocytes oxidative stress which was manifested by ROS generation‐caused lipid
  peroxidation, DNA damage and protein peroxidation.
