caption: Overview of shared metabolic pathways among glycolysis, the OPPP, and the
  Calvin cycle, as well as the circadian patterns of genes for their enzymatic steps.
  (A) A diagram of the metabolic pathway which includes overlapping reactions from
  glycolysis, the OPPP, and the Calvin cycle and overlays the timing of circadian
  gene expression onto each pathway. Genes exclusively part of the OPPP generally
  peak at dusk (red), whereas genes exclusively part of the Calvin cycle generally
  peak at dawn (green). Additionally, glycogen metabolism (gray box) shows a similar
  pattern in which anabolic genes peak at dawn and catabolic genes peak at dusk. (B)
  The table indicates the probability of observing the set of coincident peak times
  strictly by chance. P values were calculated using Fisher’s exact test. 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
