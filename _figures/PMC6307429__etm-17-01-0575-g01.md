caption: The JAK/STAT pathway is involved in the miR155/SOCS1 axis in the immune system.
  When immune cells are stimulated by cytokines, including IFN-γ and LPS, the JAK/STAT
  pathway is activated. Phosphorylated STATs form a complex and are translocated to
  the nucleus, where they activate or repress the transcription of target genes. In
  macrophages, this pathway induces M1 polarization and promotes the production of
  tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. JAK/STAT signaling also regulates IL-12
  production and DC maturation. Furthermore, the JAK-STAT pathway contributes to Treg
  and Th17 differentiation and regulates the competitive ability and proliferative
  potential of Tregs. SOCS1 negatively regulates the JAK/STAT pathway by binding to
  phosphorylated JAKs. miR-155 targets SOCS1 and inhibits it expression, leading to
  decreased binding of SOCS1 to phosphorylated JAKs. Therefore, miR-155 positively
  regulates the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; miR, microRNA; SOCs,
  suppressor of cytokine signaling; Th, T-helper cell; Treg, T-regulatory cell; IL,
  interleukin; rbx, ring box; DC, dendritic cell.
