caption: Postnatal angiogenesis in bone involves the formation of arch and bud structures.
  Blood flow is higher in metaphyseal type H vessels, which correlates with higher
  expression and activity of the Notch pathway. Reduction of flow impaired endothelial
  Notch activity, bone angiogenesis and osteogenesis. In aged mice, type H capillaries,
  vessel buds, endothelial Notch signalling and osteogenesis were low, all of which
  were reactivated by induction of EC-specific Notch activity leading to significant
  increases in osteoprogenitors and mineralized bone.
