caption: 'A number of genes including those downstream of HIF-1 signaling pathway
  were up-regulated in the pancreas in response to HFD. The sorted loadings of pancreatic
  HFD gene eigenvector demonstrated that the exposure to HFD (A) upregulated the genes
  downstream of the KEGG HIF-1 signaling pathway (B) Most of these genes are related
  to increasing oxygen delivery including angiogenesis whereas some others are related
  to regulation of proliferation and anti-apoptosis. Genes related to angiogenesis
  other than those in the KEGG HIF-1 signaling pathway such as Ang were also examined,
  including Adipoq, Cav1 and Ptgis, and others from the Biological Processes of Gene
  Ontology (GO): Positive Regulation of Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis. The top ranked
  gene Car3 in the HFD gene eigenvector was reported to be a target of HIF-1signaling
  pathway. (C) Whether this kind of up-regulation attributed, at least in part, to
  the subsequent over-secretion of insulin from the pancreas that results in hyperinsulinemia
  is worth of future investigations.'
