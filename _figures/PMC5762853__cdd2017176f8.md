caption: Schematic model of miR-20a in regulating drug response. MiR-20a increases
  drug sensitivity in breast cancer cells through reducing drug efflux by inhibiting
  P-gp in a MAPK1-dependent manner. In drug-resistant cells, the dysregulated histone
  methylation inhibits the expression of miR-20a. In addition, miR-20a decreased the
  expression of c-Myc by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway and formed a feedback loop,
  thus controlling the drug response and growth signal of the cells
