caption: ITIM-bearing CTLRs within the Dectin-1 cluster. The ITIM motif within MICL
  and MAH is known to interact with SHP-1 and SHP-2; however, pathways downstream
  of these phosphatases are only partially known. MICL is known to inhibit cytokine
  transcription instigated by other receptors as a method of control. On the other
  hand, there is evidence to suggest that MICL induces activatory pathways through
  MAPK, which is somewhat contradictory to the known functions of its motif. Downstream
  signaling of MAH is largely unknown. Dashed arrows represent a pathway that has
  yet to be fully defined.
