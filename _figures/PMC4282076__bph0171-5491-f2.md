caption: Regulation of cellular actomyosin dynamics by Rho-GTPases. Simplified regulatory
  pathway highlighting the central role of the Rho-GTPases Rho, Rac and Cdc42 in controlling
  actomyosin dynamics in cells. Rho and Rac inhibit one another and influence myosin
  contractility through effector kinases such as ROCK, PAK, Citron- and Lim kinase.
  MLCK phosphorylates MRLC, thereby promoting myosin activity. ROCK further inhibits
  myosin light-chain phosphatase, thus doubly contributing to myosin activation. Rho
  also activates formins, which together with G-actin-binding profilin, promotes actin
  polymerization. The nucleation-promoting factors Scar/WAVE and WASp/N-WASp are activated
  by both Rac and Cdc42, and induce actin polymerization either via Arp2/3 complex
  (branched actin networks) or via profilin-activation (unbranched actin networks).
  Rho affects actin polymerization dynamics via LIM kinase-mediated inhibition of
  cofilin, which as an actin-severing protein influences the balance between G- and
  F-actins.
