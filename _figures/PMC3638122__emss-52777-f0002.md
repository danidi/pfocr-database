caption: Purine nucleotide synthesis and its role in regulation of AMPK. ZMP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide, AICA ribotide) is a natural intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway
  leading from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to the purine nucleotides IMP,
  AMP and GMP. Incubation of many cells with AICA riboside leads to the accumulation
  of ZMP because uptake and phosphorylation of the riboside is more rapid than its
  subsequent metabolism to IMP. Depending on the flux through the purine nucleotide
  synthesis pathway, the antifolate drugs pemetrexed [] and methotrexate [] or their
  polyglutamate derivatives can also cause accumulation of ZMP and lead to activation
  of AMPK.
