caption: Outline of the chaperone response in protein folding. Chaperones facilitate
  proper folding of a diverse array of client proteins and prevent oligomer and aggregate
  formation. If folding is not possible, misfolded proteins are targeted for protein
  degradation to maintain proper protein homeostasis. Degradation is achieved through
  the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) or the autophagy-lysosome pathway. A list
  of diseases and the associated aggregate discussed in this review are outlined.
