caption: Figure 1. Model showing the RAPGEF3-dependent pathway involved in the control
  of autophagy and the molecules involved in the autophagic response induced by Staphylococcus
  aureus. (A) Bacterial infections may modulate the levels of intracellular cAMP.
  When the levels of cAMP are increased, this can activate RAPGEF3, which through
  RAP2B and PLCE1/PLCε activation induces an increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3. In turn, this
  Ins(1,4,5)P3 increase leads to calcium release from the ER, which activates the
  calpain cysteine-proteases. These calpains are able to cleave ATG5 inhibiting the
  autophagic pathway. Thus, cAMP via calpains activation negatively regulates autophagy.
  (B) S. aureus is incorporated into the cell by phagocytosis. After the infection,
  S. aureus produces a decrease in the amount of active RAP2B, likely through the
  decline in the intracellular cAMP levels activating the autophagic pathway. The
  damage caused by the α-toxin Hla to the phagosomal membrane is likely responsible
  for the recruitment of LC3 to the phagosomal membrane of a subset of phagosomal-containing
  bacteria. Afterwards, the pathogen escapes into the cytoplasm to finally cause cell
  death, and spread to neighboring cells. Another group of bacteria recruits RAPGEF3
  and/or RAP2B to the phagosome membrane.
