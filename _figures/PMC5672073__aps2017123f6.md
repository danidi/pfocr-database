caption: Schematic representation of the proposed molecular regulatory mechanisms
  of osimertinib-mediated PD-L1 expression in EGFR-driven NSCLC cells. Inhibition
  of p-EGFR by osimertinib not only causes reduction of PD-L1 mRNA but also activates
  GSK3β, resulting in PD-L1 degradation by the proteasome pathway.
