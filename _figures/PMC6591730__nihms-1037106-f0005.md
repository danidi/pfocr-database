caption: (A) Upon gene activation, canonical topoisomerase activity promotes gene
  expression. The enzymes TOP1 and TOP2 cleave one or both strands to alleviate positive
  supercoiling ahead of and negative supercoiling behind RNA polymerase (Pol II).
  ssDNA behind Pol II can be a substrate for cytosine deamination.(B) Non-canonical,
  abortive TOP2 reactions result in protein-linked DNA breaks that are resolved the
  NHEJ repair pathway. Abortive TOP2 activity also promotes transcription by an unknown
  mechanism. Persistent DNA damage may also result in chromosomal alterations.
