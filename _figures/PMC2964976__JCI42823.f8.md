caption: Oxidative vascular injury leads to dissociation of the transcription factor
  Nrf2 from its cytoplasmic partner, Keap1/INrf2. Nrf2 then enters the nucleus, where
  it binds to specific ARE elements in key antioxidant genes, including HO-1 and Prdx2.
  Expression of these genes then attenuates oxidant stress. Oxidative stress also
  leads to generation of specific CD36 ligands, such as MP and oxLDL. Engagement of
  these ligands by CD36 recruits and activates Fyn kinase, which in turn phosphorylates
  Nrf2 in the nucleus. The phosphorylated Nrf2 is transported out of the nucleus and
  degraded.
