caption: PGI2signaling pathways in VSMCs. PGI2/IP cell surface interaction is coupled
  primarily to Gs to activate cAMP/PKA leading to Ca2+ extrusion via cell surface
  and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ pumps, and activation of different K+ channels
  (including ATP-sensitive K+ channels and MaxiK channels), which in turn cause VSMC
  hyperpolarization and relaxation. In contrast, TXA2/TP interaction causes stimulation
  of Gq, activation of phospholipase C (PLC), and increased production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3), which stimulates Ca2+ release from SR, and DAG, which activates PKC. Increased
  [Ca2+]i causes activation of Ca2+/calmodulin/myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway
  and stimulation of VSM contraction. TP-mediated stimulation of Gα12/13 activates
  Rho signaling and the RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway, which inhibits
  myosin-light chain phosphatase (MLCP) and causes Ca2+ sensitization and enhancement
  of VSMC contraction. PGI2/IP signaling via cAMP/PKA can inhibit TXA2-induced VSMC
  contraction by PKA-mediated TPα phosphorylation and thereby inhibition of both Gq/PLCβ/Ca2+-dependent
  and G12/13/RhoA Ca2+-independent signaling pathways. PGI2 also activate genomic
  pathways and cellular processes including, as shown from left to right, PGI2-induced
  PGI2 release, PPAR, VSMC hypertrophy, proliferation, differentiation, and migration.
  PGI2/IP signaling can induce COX2 expression in VSMCs to metabolize AA and produce
  PGI2, which in turn may act in an intracrine fashion on the same VSMC or paracrine
  on nearby VSMCs (feedback loop). PGI2 intracrine signaling may involve direct binding
  to PPAR nuclear receptors and gene transcription. PGI2/IP signaling can inhibit
  Shc/GRB2 complex formation and subsequent ERK1/2 activation by TXA2/TP signaling,
  thus inhibiting VSMC hypertrophy. PGI2 also inhibits VSMC proliferation by inhibiting
  G1-to-S phase progression through inhibition of cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase
  (cdk2) as well as activation of p27kip1, which keeps cyclin E-cdk2 in an inactive
  state, either directly or via inhibition of the gene for S-phase kinase-associated
  protein (Skp2), which causes p27kip1 degradation. PGI2 can also act through IP/cAMP/PKA-mediated
  activation of CREB or other SM-specific transcription factors to increase the expression
  of SM-specific differentiation markers and cause VSM differentiation. PGI2 via cAMP-dependent
  activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) causes inhibition of focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK) and disruption of focal adhesion formation, leading to inhibition of
  cell migration.
