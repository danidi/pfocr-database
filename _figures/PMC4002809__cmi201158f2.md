caption: Current model for NF-κB signaling pathway induced by C-type lectin receptors.
  Dectin-1, Dectin-2 and Mincle induce signaling cascades by recruiting Syk through
  its ITAM or the ITAM in FcRγ, leading to activation of PLCγ2. The activated PLCγ2
  induces the activation of undefined kinases inducing phosphorylation of IKK complex,
  and it also induces the activation of the CBM complex leading to a K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of IKK complex. The phosphorylation and K63-linked polyubiquitination of the IKK
  complex activate IKK, leading to induction of NF-κB. CBM, CARD9–BCL10–MALT1; IKK,
  IκB kinase; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif.
