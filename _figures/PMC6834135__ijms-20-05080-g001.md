caption: 'NK cell features in chronic HBV infection. A: The interaction between TRAIL,
  which is up-regulated on intrahepatic NK cells, and its receptors represents a mechanism
  for NK cell-mediated lysis of HBV-infected hepatocytes, but also a pathway leading
  to the deletion of HBV-specific T cells overexpressing the TRAIL-R2 receptor. B:
  The NK cell dysfunction observed in CHB infection has been targeted by correction
  interventions based on up-regulated inhibitory receptors blockade, like Tim-3, NKG2A,
  and Siglec-9. C: FcεRIγ-negative memory-like CD56dim NK cells have been detected
  in patients with chronic HBV infection, particularly in those co-infected with HCMV,
  as compared with healthy donors. This NK cell subset shows increased CD16-mediated
  effector functions and a distinct metabolic and epigenetic signature. D: KLRG1+
  NK cells displaying a mature phenotype, with elevated CD57 and DNAM-1 expression,
  have been found enriched in CHB patients, within the FcεRIγ-negative memory-like
  CD56dim NK cell subpopulation. Such cells can be stimulated by osteopontin (OPN),
  produced by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and exert an anti-fibrotic effect
  by killing HSC in a TRAIL-dependent manner.'
