caption: Schematic visualization of our hypothesis. In cancer or upon infection, professional
  antigen-presenting cells take up antigens released by dying cells, degrade them
  in the endosome-lysosome compartments, and present their longer peptides as either
  HLA-II or HLA-I peptides in a proteasome-independent manner. In addition, shorter
  HLA-I peptides are presented via the conventional proteasome-dependent class I pathway.
  In case cells are directly infected with intracellular pathogens or at steady state
  conditions, autophagy may similarly lead to the presentation of longer peptides,
  from the pathogens or from the self proteome, including as HLA-I.
