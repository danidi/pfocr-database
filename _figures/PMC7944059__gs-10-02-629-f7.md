caption: 'Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway map illustrating differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs), as identified by protein-protein interaction network analysis
  using STRING. The network map was generated in the Database for Annotation, Visualization
  and Integrated Discovery 6.8. Each node is a differentially expressed gene. Network
  nodes represent proteins, edges represent protein-protein associations; colored
  nodes: query proteins and first shell of interactors; white nodes: second shell
  of interactors; empty nodes: proteins of unknown 3D structure; filled nodes: some
  3D structure is known or predicted.'
