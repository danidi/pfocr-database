caption: Model for the action of PAV-206, a possible first-in-class selective inhibitor
  of HIV-1 assembly. Upper diagram shows the intracellular pathway for HIV-1 immature
  capsid assembly, in the presence of an inactive compound, starting with synthesis
  of HIV-1 Gag and formation of the early ∼10S assembly intermediate. The ∼80S assembly
  intermediate is formed when HIV-1 Gag coopts a host RNP complex related to an RNA
  granule to form the ∼80S cytosolic intermediate. This and subsequent intermediates
  contain Gag associated with ABCE1, DDX6, other host factors, and HIV-1 gRNA. After
  targeting of the cytosolic ∼80S assembly intermediate to the host plasma membrane,
  Gag multimerization continues leading to the formation of the ∼500S assembly intermediate.
  The host proteins are released upon formation of the ∼750S completed immature capsid,
  and budding results in release of the completed immature capsid. The lower diagram
  shows one model for PAV-117/PAV-206 activity based on the findings in this study.
  Our colocalization studies suggest that this chemotype is associated with both the
  HIV-1 assembly intermediates and the host RNA-granule-related complex from which
  they are derived, since the compound colocalizes with two host components of this
  complex, ABCE1 and DDX6, in the presence and absence of Gag. The compound does not
  colocalize with G3BP1 or XRN1, proteins found in stress granules and P-bodies, indicating
  that this chemotype acts with some selectivity for the RNP complex that is coopted
  to form assembly intermediates. In addition, we observed a reduction of virus production
  and the amount of ∼500S assembly intermediate in PAV-117-treated infected cells.
  Thus, we hypothesize that PAV-117/PAV-206 inhibits virus production by acting during
  the HIV-1 immature capsid assembly pathway to inhibit progression of assembly past
  the ∼80S/150S assembly intermediate.
