caption: Involvement of ROS in regulating M1 responsible phagocytic activity and inflammatory
  response. (a) Multiple pathways are involved in generating NADPH, followed by ROS
  production by NADPH oxidase. The high ROS level mainly used to mediate the phagocytic
  activity of M1 macrophages. (b) ROS serves as second messenger mediating the inflammatory
  response of M1 macrophages, primarily through MAPK and NF-κB as well as inflammasome
  activation. Mt, mitochondrial; FA, fatty acid; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; R5P, ribulose-5-phosphate;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
