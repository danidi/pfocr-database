caption: Upstream and downstream AMPK signaling pathways that negatively regulate
  NF-κB activation and suppress inflammatory responses. AMPK is activated by several
  hormones, many phytochemicals, certain drugs (for example, metformin) and physical
  exercise. Obesity and hyperglycemia reduce the expression of AMPK. But Yuk et al.
  showed that LPS, which strongly activates NF-κB via TLR signaling, induced SHP transcription
  via a CaMKKβ–AMPK–USP1-dependent signaling pathway and that newly produced SHP inhibited
  NF-κB in a negative feedback loop. MSP mimicked LPS in that it induced the expression
  of SHP via an LKB1–AMPK–USP1-dependent pathway, attenuating LPS-induced NF-κB activation.
  Once AMPK has been activated, it stimulates SIRT1, PGC1α, FoxO and p53, which could
  attenuate NF-κB activation. Liu et al. showed that AMPK, via the Nrf2/ARE pathway,
  induced the HO-1/CO system, which reduced cellular stress and inhibited TLR signaling
  pathways, resulting in the suppression of NF-κB activation. AMPK can ameliorate
  inflammatory responses via various direct and indirect anti-inflammatory signaling
  pathways. ↓, activation; ⊥, inhibition. AMPK, AMP-activated kinase; ARE, antioxidant
  responsive element; CaMKKβ, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β HO-1/CO,
  heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MSP, macrophage-stimulating
  protein; SHP, small heterodimer partner; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
