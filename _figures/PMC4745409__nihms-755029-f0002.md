caption: 'Pathways involved in internalization and sensing of dsDNA. dsDNA-containing
  immune complexes undergo endocytosis after engaging the BCR on B cells or FcRs on
  DCs, macrophages and glomerular cells. Additionally, dsDNA can be internalized after
  binding to LL-37, or through the HMGB1–RAGE pathway. These routes result in localization
  of DNA to endosomes. It is not known if DNA is released from endosomes to the cytoplasm;
  additional receptors that mediate direct uptake into the cytoplasm might exist.
  The dsDNA-sensing pathways activated differ according to the structure of the DNA.
  CpG-rich dsDNA activates TLR9 whereas AT-rich dsDNA signals through DAI or RNA polymerase
  III. These signaling pathways all lead to production of type I IFN and inflammation.
  A fourth dsDNA-sensing pathway involves the AIM2 inflammasome, and results in activation
  of IL-1β and induction of pyroptosis. Abbreviations: BCR, B-cell receptor; DCs,
  dendritic cells; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; FcR, Fc receptor; IFN, interferon;
  IRF, interferon regulatory factor; NFκB, nuclear factor κB.'
