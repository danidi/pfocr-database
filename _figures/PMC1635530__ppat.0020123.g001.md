caption: (A) A schematic representation of the strategy to identify NPR1 direct targets.
  SA treatment activates components of the SAR pathway upstream or independent of
  NPR1. Subsequent application of dexamethasone (DEX) triggers nuclear translocation
  of the NPR1-GR fusion protein to activate existing TGA transcription factors. Direct
  target genes of NPR1 are transcribed but not translated in the presence of the inhibitor
  cycloheximide (CHX) to prevent transcription of indirect target genes. ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum–resident proteins; TF, transcription factors; PR, pathogenesis-related
  proteins.(B) Mode of action for the NPR1-target WRKY factors. In WT, SA accumulation
  triggers nuclear localization of NPR1, which directly induces several WRKY genes.
  When SA levels are low, WRKY58 functions to prevent (blocked arrow) spurious activation
  of SAR (dotted lines). When SA levels are high, signaling through positive WRKY
  factors overcomes the negative effect of WRKY58 to activate (arrow) downstream gene
  transcription (solid lines). In addition, WRKY70 and WRKY54 prevent excessive SA
  accumulation (blocked arrow).
