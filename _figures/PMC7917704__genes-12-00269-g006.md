caption: HMGA2 is regulated by the RAF kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) pathway. RKIP
  suppresses HMGA2 expression directly, as well as indirectly, by inducing the miRNAs
  miR-185, miR-200, and miR-98, which target the 3′UTR of HMGA2 mRNA. Suppression
  of HMGA2 via RKIP and miRNAs reduces the expression of the EMT-promoting factors
  CCL5 and SDC2.
