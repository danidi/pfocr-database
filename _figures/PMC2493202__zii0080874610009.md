caption: S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. flexneri induce PMN transepithelial
  migration through the utilization of distinct PLA2 enzymes. S. enterica serovar
  Typhimurium interacts with intestinal epithelial cells from the apical surface,
  and the effector protein, SipA, activates a novel signal transduction cascade that
  leads to the activation of PKC (*, activated PKC). We postulate (dashed arrow) that
  this PKC-dependent signal transduction cascade leads to the activation of iPLA2,
  which liberates arachidonic acid (AA) from membranes for subsequent metabolism by
  the 12/15-LOX pathway, culminating in the synthesis of HXA3. S. flexneri gains access
  to and interacts with the intestinal epithelium from the basolateral surface. Once
  inside the host cell, S. flexneri secretes the effector proteins OspF and OspC1,
  which leads to the phosphorylation (P) of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 activation is a prominent
  trigger (dashed arrow) which leads to the activation of cPLA2. This enzyme releases
  arachidonic acid from membranes, where is becomes an available substrate for the
  12/15-LOX pathway and leads to the eventual production of HXA3. IL-8, interleukin-8.
  Large black ovals represent cell nuclei.
