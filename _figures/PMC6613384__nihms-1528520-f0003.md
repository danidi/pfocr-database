caption: Protective effects of fibroblast growth factor 21 in cardiovascular disease.
  Most work on the protective effects of FGF21 in CVD has focused on FGF21 signaling
  primarily in tissues, such as the liver, kidney, adipose tissue, and heart (i.e.
  effects on cardiomyocytes). The induction of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
  in adipocytes and renal cells by FGF21 attenuates pathologic vascular remodeling,
  fibrosis, and inflammation in hypertension. The induction of adiponectin in adipocytes
  and the liver by FGF21 limits vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis and cardiac
  dysfunction in MI and suppresses smooth muscle cell proliferation and macrophage
  oxLDL uptake directly. In atherosclerosis, FGF21 directly inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis
  by signaling on hepatocytes. The immune effects of FGF21 have primarily been studied
  in vitro (see box). FGF21 suppresses macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine production
  and foam cell formation by inducing the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2 (Nrf2) pathway and upregulation of cholesterol efflux machinery (e.g. ABCA1, ABCG1)
  in vitro. It is unknown whether FGF21 impacts myeloid cell and other leukocyte functions
  in cardiovascular disease in vivo.
