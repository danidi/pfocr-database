  adenine dinucleotide/reduced form; Cho, choline; PC, phosphocholine; GPC, glycerophosphocholine;
  PTC, phosphatidylcholine; UDP, uridine diphosphate; UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine;
  FAs, fatty acids; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; OXPHOS; Oxidative phosphorylation.
