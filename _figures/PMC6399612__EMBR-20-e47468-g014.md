caption: Although Ddx17 and PCAF bind to the myogenin promoter, the interaction between
  Ddx17 and PCAF is weak in the absence of Myoparr. Thus, occupancies of both Ddx17
  and PCAF on the myogenin promoter are not sufficient for maximum Pol II recruitment
  to the myogenin promoter. After binding to the myogenin promoter, Myoparr interacts
  with Ddx17 to promote the Ddx17‐PCAF interaction. Enhanced Ddx17‐PCAF interaction
  by Myoparr may be sufficient for maximum Pol II recruitment to the myogenin promoter.
  Thus, Myoparr is required for specification of myoblast lineage into myogenic differentiation
  through the Myoparr (upstream) and myogenin (downstream) pathway. In addition, Myoparr
  is involved in the regulation of myoblast cell cycle withdrawal by activating the
  expression of myogenic regulatory miRNAs in a myogenin‐independent manner.
