caption: Impact of homo- and heterodimerization in GLP-1R signaling. Arr3 = Arrestin3.
  Disruption of GLP-1R homodimer formation severely inhibits GLP-1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization,
  suggesting that homodimerization is involved in this signaling pathway. GLP-1 has
  also been shown to induce heterodimerization of GLP-1R and GIPR. Coexpression of
  GIPR with GLP-1R attenuates GLP-1-mediated cAMP production, arrestin3 recruitment,
  Ca2+ mobilization, and GLP-1R internalization. This suggests that GIPR acts as a
  negative regulator of GLP-1R signaling.
