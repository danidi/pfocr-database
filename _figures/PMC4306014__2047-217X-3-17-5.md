caption: Phenylpropanoid synthesis pathway for Colchicum autumnale. Labelled rectangles
  are proteins. Small circles are metabolites. Black lines show the KEGG pathway.
  Red lines show the BioGRID interactions emanating from protein (K12355), which was
  interactively selected. A right-click on the protein will display the inferred function
  and a link to the sequence(s).
