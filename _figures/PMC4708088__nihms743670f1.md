caption: A. Notch receptors are activated by binding of the Notch extracellular domain
  (NECD) to Notch ligands of the Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 families on adjacent signal-sending
  cell. Ubiquitination of Notch ligands by the Mindbomb and Neuralized E3 ubiquitin
  ligases promotes endocytosis, facilitating cleavage by ADAM family metalloproteases
  through exposure of the S2 proteolytic cleavage site. S2 cleavage results in the
  separation of ligand-bound NECD, and the remaining transmembrane receptor. Subsequently,
  the ligand-NECD complex is taken up by the signal-sending cell. The remaining membrane-bound
  Notch receptor is cleaved at the S3 and S4 proteolytic sites by Gamma-Secretase,
  releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane tether and allowing
  NICD to translocate to the nucleus. In the absence of Notch receptor activation,
  Notch transcriptional targets are bound by RBPjK/CSL and transcriptional corepressors
  (Co-R), and held in a transcriptionally repressed state. Nuclear NICD binds RBPjK,
  displacing the corepressor complex and allowing for the recruitment of transcriptional
  partner Mastermind (MAM) and additional coactivators (Co-A), allowing for transcriptional
  activation of Notch target genes. B. In some cases RBPjK occupies Notch transcriptional
  target sites in a more dynamic manner. In this case, RBPjK does not occupy the Notch
  target site in the absence of Notch activation, and is instead recruited upon activation
  alongside NICD and transcriptional co-activators.
