caption: The caspase-2 activation pathway. A schematic representation of the proposed
  mechanism for capase-2 activation by the PIDDosome. Inactive caspase-2 monomers
  are recruited to the PIDDosome in response to certain cellular stresses. This results
  in dimerization and activation of caspase-2. Caspase-2 cleaves and activates Bid
  to induce MOMP eventually resulting in activation of executioner caspases by caspase-9-mediated
  cleavage.
