caption: . Fungal exposure leads to the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
  and unfolded protein response (UPR) in the lung. Inhaled fungi possess a wide array
  of ligands that activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on structural
  cells (e.g. airway epithelial cells) and dendritic cells (DCs). Fungi can also produce
  large amounts of secreted enzymes, such as proteases, which disrupt tight junctions
  of airway epithelium. Initial recognition of fungi is followed by allergic sensitization
  and eosinophilic airway inflammation through close interactions between various
  facets of host immunity (not presented here). During this process, various cell
  types, including frontline cells (e.g. airway epithelial cells, DCs, and alveolar
  macrophages) and adaptive T and B cells, produce large amounts of cytokines/chemokines
  as well as host defensive molecules. Increased protein folding demand in these cells
  results in ER stress and triggers UPR. UPR signaling is orchestrated by 3 ER-localized
  sensors, namely, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. These adaptive responses together reduce
  protein folding demand, increase enzymes and chaperones involved in protein folding,
  and facilitate protein degradation pathway. However, when cells fail to resolve
  ER stress, UPR mediates ER stress-induced apoptosis.
