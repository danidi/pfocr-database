caption: 'The major biosynthetic activities used by proliferating tumor cells (synthesis
  of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids) are outlined in boxes. Supporting pathways,
  including glycolysis, the oxidative and non-oxidative arms of the pentose phosphate
  pathway, mitochondrial glutamine metabolism and the TCA cycle are also shown. Alternative
  metabolic pathways normally used during nutrient deprivation and suppressed during
  cell proliferation (β-oxidation of fatty acids, autophagy) are indicated by dashed
  lines. Selected effects of p53, Myc, Ras and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling system
  (boxed P) are indicated; black symbols indicate supression and white symbols indicate
  activation. In the case of p53, loss of function mutations in tumor cells have the
  opposite of the effect shown here (e.g. glucose uptake and glycolysis are no longer
  suppressed by p53 activity). Abbreviations: Glc, glucose; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; F1,6biP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; F2,6biP, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate;
  GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate; Lac, lactate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate;
  PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; Ser, serine; Gly, glycine; Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA;
  Cit, citrate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Succ, succinate; OAA, oxaloacetate; Mal-CoA,
  malonyl-CoA; Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate, NH4+, ammonia; TIGAR, TP53-induced
  glycolysis and apoptosis regulator; PFK1, phosphofructokinase-1; PGAM, phosphoglycerate
  mutase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase.'
