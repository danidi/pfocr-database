caption: Model of Tpl2-ERK activation during TLR signaling. Stimulation of TLR2, 4
  and 7 immediately activates the IKKβ-Tpl2-ERK inflammatory pathway. In addition
  to a TLR adaptor protein, activation of this pathway by TLR4 requires the TLR4 co-receptor
  CD14 and the tyrosine kinase Syk. Active IKKβ phosphorylates both NFκB1 and Tpl2-p58
  and leads to release of active Tpl2, which in turn induces MEK-dependent ERK activation
  prior to Tpl2-p58 proteosomal degradation. ERK signaling facilitates processing
  and secretion of TNFα. TLR3 and 9 do not cause Tpl2-p58 phosphorylation-induced
  mobility shift, degradation, or early ERK activation. Instead, TLR3 and 9 induce
  delayed ERK phosphorylation via autocrine signaling by ROS, which is generated in
  a Tpl2-dependent manner. Consequently, TLR3 and 9 induce delayed secretion of innate
  TNFα compared with other TLRs.
