caption: Hypothetical regulatory model for flagellar synthesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens
  F113. In this updated model, the transcriptional regulator AmrZ positively controls
  the expression of the gene encoding the transmembrane DGC AdrA. This DGC responds
  to unknown environmental signals and synthesizes the c-di-GMP that, when bound to
  SadB, is involved in the repression of the flagellar apparatus synthesis. SadB dimers
  bound to c-di-GMP activates the expression of the gene encoding the sigma factor
  AlgU, required for the expression of the gene encoding the global regulator AmrZ.
  From this point, the hub AmrZ/FleQ by means of a mutual transcriptional repression
  controls the expression of the flagellar biosynthesis genes. The Gac branch of the
  signaling pathway remains as described earlier.
