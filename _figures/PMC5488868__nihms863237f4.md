caption: 'A pathway schematic for JA biosynthesis and breakdown, with transcription
  factors/enzymes shown by bare text with a circle, representing RNA, and star, representing
  protein levels. Metabolites are shown by rounded rectangles. For metabolites, RNA,
  and protein, the log2-fold change for ceh1 vs parent (left) and ceh1/eds16 vs. parent
  (right) is represented by shading, from -2 (darkest) to 2 (lightest). Non-detectable
  products in each section are shown by an asterisk, while empty symbols with grey
  borders represent non-significant fold changes relative to parent. Arrows represent
  chemical conversions, catalyzed by the enzymes shown on the line, or metabolite
  transport. Peroxisome-localized steps in conversion of 12-OPDA to JA are shown in
  the grey box, while simplified chloroplast-localized steps leading to 12-OPDA synthesis
  are in the green. Open arrows represent metabolite/protein, protein/protein, and
  protein/DNA (transcription regulation) interactions. Abbreviations: α-LA: α-linolenic
