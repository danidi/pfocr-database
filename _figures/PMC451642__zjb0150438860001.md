caption: Pathways for the biosynthesis of AroAAs in M. maripaludis. The precursors
  for the de novo pathway in methanogens are not known, but homologs for genes at
  all the steps after 3-dehydroquinate are present in the genomic sequence (see the
  text). After chorismate, the pathway splits into three branches, one of which leads
  to tryptophan. At prephenate, the branches leading to phenylalanine and tyrosine
  form. The aryl acid pathway starts from phenylacetate, p-hydroxyphenylacetate, and
  indoleacetate, precursors for phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, respectively.
  The enzymes shown are DHQ, CM, PDT, PDH, AroAT, and IOR. Possible transcriptional
  regulation of DHQ is indicated by double dashed lines. Inhibition (−) or activation
  (+) of the PDT and PDH enzyme activities are indicated by single dashed lines.
