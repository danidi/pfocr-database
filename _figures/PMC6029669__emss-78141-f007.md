caption: Increased intracellular iron activated the Akt and AMPK pathways, resulting
  in decreased gluconeogenesis and hepatocyte glucose production. In addition, iron
  decreased levels of IRS-1 and 2, which are upstream of Akt in the insulin signaling
  pathway, resulting in decreased insulin-stimulated activation of the Akt pathway.
