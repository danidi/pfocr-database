caption: A mechanistic map depicting the potential role of the HDAC1/LSD1/SESN2 pathway
  in VC in CRF. HDAC1 regulates the deacetylation of LSD1 promoter region through
  H3K9ac and then inhibits the expression of LSD1. After the inhibition of LSD1, H3K4me2
  binds into the promoter region of SESN2 to promote the expression of SESN2. SESN2
  promotes autophagy of VSMCs via mTOR signalling pathway regulation which ultimately
  alleviated VC in CRF. BUN, blood urea nitrogen; CRF, chronic renal failure; HDAC1,
  histone deacetylase 1; Runx2, Runt‐related transcription factor 2; SCr, serum creatinine;
  U‐pro, urine protein; VC, vascular calcification; VPA, valproic acid; VSMCs, vascular
  smooth muscle cells; α‐SMA, α‐smooth muscle actin
