caption: Cyclin D1 stability is regulated by ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal
  degradation. In normal cells, cyclin D1 degradation allows for normal G1 to S phase
  progression. In cancer cells, the cyclin D1 ubiquitination pathway is impaired by
  defects in the E3 ligase or upregulation of USP2, leading to cyclin D1 accumulation,
  accelerating G1 to S phase progression and increasing tumorigenesis.
