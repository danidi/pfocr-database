caption: Proposed alternative model for cytosolic-mitochondrial trafficking associated
  with astrocytic production of glutamine (pathway 1), its transfer to glutamatergic
  neurons (without indication of any extracellular space, because there is no other
  function for extracellular glutamine than astrocyte-to-neuron transfer) and extracellular
  release as the transmitter glutamate (pathway 2), and subsequent reuptake of glutamate
  and oxidative metabolism in astrocytes (pathway 3), with connections between pathways
  1 and 3 shown as pathway 4. Biosynthesis of glutamine is shown in brown and metabolic
  degradation of glutamate in blue. Redox shuttling and astrocytic release of glutamine
  and uptake of glutamate are shown in black, and neuronal uptake of glutamine, hydrolysis
  to glutamate, and its release is shown in red. Reactions involving or resulting
  from transamination between aspartate and oxaloacetate (OAA) are shown in green.
  AGC1, aspartate/glutamate exchanger, aralar; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Glc, glucose;
  Pyr, pyruvate; OGC, malate/α-ketoglutarate exchanger. It must be noted that (i)
  aralar activity is not required until the oxidation of glutamate, probably allowing
  rapid glutamate synthesis, (ii) all reactions are stoichiometrically accounted for,
  and (iii) the model is consistent with the 13C labeling data of the study by Pardo
  et al in aralar−/− animals, because even in the absence of aralar, mitochondrial
  aspartate can be synthesized, but under these conditions, it is unable to enter
  across the mitochondria into the cytosol, a prerequisite for its ability to enhance
  glutamate synthesis. For further details, see text.
