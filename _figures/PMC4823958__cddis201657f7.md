caption: A diagram depicting the signaling mechanisms of C2dat1. I/R-induced C2dat1
  upregulates the expression of CAMK2D at the transcriptional level, possibly through
  direct binding to the CAMK2D gene via the overlapping sequence. The upregulation
  of CAMK2D led to an increased CaMKIIδ protein expression and enhanced activity (I/R
  is known to activate CaMKII). The activated CaMKIIδ stimulates IKKα/β protein expression
  and their phosphorylation at S176/180, which resulted in IκBα degradation and subsequent
  NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of multiple
  genes including Bcl-xL to promote cell survival
