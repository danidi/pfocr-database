caption: 'Proper embryonic brain development and size are achieved through clonal
  expansion of apical progenitors (APs), followed by expansion of basal progenitors
  (BPs). The first step is clonal expansion of the AP cell layer: AP cells undergo
  a series of Wnt signaling-induced proliferative symmetrical divisions. Due to Wnt
  signaling activation, DVL3 levels increase and the β-catenin destruction complex
  is recruited to the membrane, preventing it from phosphorylating β-catenin, leading
  to accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and eventually in the nucleus. This
  triggers activation of Wnt signaling-specific genes that allow the APs to further
  proliferate and maintain their progenitor identity, generating the first clonal
  expansion in the developing brain. Once there is sufficient number of AP cells,
  ALFY attenuates Wnt signaling by autophagy-mediated removal of DVL3, allowing the
  β-catenin destruction complex to phosphorylate β-catenin, resulting in its removal
  from the cytoplasm. This attenuation of the Wnt signaling enables the cells to start
  asymmetric differentiative divisions, generating the second critical layer in the
  developing brain, the BPs. The BPs will continue to proliferate and eventually differentiate
  to generate neuronal cells. In the absence of appropriate ALFY activity (right panel)
  DVL3 levels remain high, resulting in elevated β-catenin levels and high activation
  of the Wnt signaling pathway. This lack of attenuation of Wnt signaling prevents
  proper generation of the BP cell layer and therefore reduces the generation of differentiated
  neurons. We believe that this locks the AP cells in successive rounds of symmetrical
  proliferative divisions, further expanding their population at the expense of generating
  the crucial BP cell layer, resulting in major reduction of BPs. Since the AP layer
  is confined in space, this expansion of APs cells is limited and will not compensate
  for the lack of BPs. It is the BP cell layer that demonstrates the most significant
  difference between primates and rodents and is believed to be responsible for determining
  the final size of the primate brain []. Thus, lack of BP cells in the developing
  brain eventually leads to reduced number of neurons and microcephaly.'
