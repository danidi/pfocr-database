caption: CG numbers are given for each Drosophila pathway component, as well as the
  protein names or complex names for their human orthologues. Pathway entry points
  are noted with Roman numerals at the top, and end points are at the bottom. A key
  for the following symbols is provided. Symbols encircled with thick lines represent
  proteins that act together or in a complex, while symbols encircled with thin lines
  represent paralogues or proteins that may substitute for one another. Proteins found
  to affect MMS survival are noted as down (death) or up triangles (resistance). Statistically
  significant proteins are indicated with black triangles, while trend hits are indicated
  with grey triangles. Essential genes are noted with a thick bar and any with downwards
  or upwards pointing boxes were also validated as conferring death or resistance,
  respectively, to MMS upon knock-down. Shaded squares are proteins not found to be
  hits after validation, and open squares were not tested in our validation. Yeast
  orthologues previously found to be required for MMS survival  are noted with a dot
  under the symbol. (A) Base Excision Repair. (B) DNA Damage Response. (C) Proteasome.
