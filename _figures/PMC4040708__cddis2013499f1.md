caption: Model of HCV apoptotic signaling pathways. HCV induces infected hepatocytes
  to apoptosis. Death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway is enforced by mitochondrial
  amplification loop. Oxidative and ER stress with apoptosis are also shown, which
  reflect a potential interaction between the host cell response and apoptosis. Stress
  pathways are converged at the nucleus and low levels of NF-κB and BCL-xL sensitize
  hepatocytes to apoptosis. Lines with arrows denote an activating reaction; red lines
  ending in perpendicular lines denote inhibition of the reaction
