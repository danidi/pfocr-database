caption: A model for GPR-mediated initiation of G protein signaling. (A) A pathway
  for spindle force regulation by LIN-5/GPR/Gα, which may be locally regulated by
  polarity genes. (B) Classical heterotrimeric G protein activation. Exchange of GDP
  for GTP associated with Gα is stimulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange activity
  of a GPCR. The heterotrimer is dissociated into two independent signaling modules,
  Gα·GTP and Gβγ, which are then competent to activate downstream effectors. (C) Activation
  of G protein signaling in the absence of a GPCR. A GoLoco/GPR motif protein, such
  as Pins, could compete with and dissociate Gβγ from the heterotrimer, thus initiating
  Gβγ signaling. It is not known if Gα·GDP/Pins is competent to signal. (D) Receptor-independent
  initiation of Gα·GTP signaling. The GPR-1/GPR-2 GoLoco proteins could dissociate
  Gβγ from the heterotrimer and allow the subsequent production of Gα·GTP through
  the activity of a GEF such as RIC-8. Additionally, free Gβγ could regulate its specific
  effectors. The signal could be attenuated by intrinsic or GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis,
  allowing for cycling activation of this pathway.
