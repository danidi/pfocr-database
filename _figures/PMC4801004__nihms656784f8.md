caption: Model of Ca2+ mediated regulation of TFEB. Under normal feeding conditions
  TFEB is phosphorylated on the lysosomal surface and is sequestered in the cytoplasm
  by the 14-3-3 proteins. During starvation and physical exercise Ca2+ is released
  from the lysosome via MCOLN1, thus establishing a Ca2+ microdomain. This leads to
  calcineurin activation and TFEB de-phosphorylation. De-phosphorylated TFEB is no
  longer able to bind 14-3-3 proteins and can freely translocate to the nucleus where
  it transcriptionally activates the lysosomal/autophagic pathway.
