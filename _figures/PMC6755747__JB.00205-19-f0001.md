caption: Selected phosphotyrosine-regulated processes in Gram-positive and Gram-negative
  bacterial cells. The two large boxes indicate a representative bacterial cell and
  the dashed line represents a cell division site (septum). Arrows indicate the pathway
  direction of the cellular process. Interrupted lines (in 3 and 5) indicate transcriptional
  inhibition. (1) Wzc autophosphorylation increases copolymerase activity in E. coli.
  (2) Tyrosine phosphorylation of DnaK by PtkA during heat shock enhances maintenance
  of misfolded proteins in Bacillus subtilis. (3) Tyrosine phosphorylation of SalA
  promotes DNA binding to prevent scoC transcription in B. subtilis. (4) S. pneumoniae
  CspD requires CpsC to be recruited to cell division site, leading to its autophosphorylation,
  which supports capsule production. (5) DNA binding and transcriptional repressor
  activity of Cra is blocked by its tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to LEE-1 gene
  expression in enterohemorrhagic E. coli. (6) Tyrosine phosphorylation of SSB enhances
  SSB affinity for DNA in B. subtilis. (7) Phosphorylation of CesT on Y152 results
  in enhanced effector secretion via the type III secretion system in enteropathogenic
  E. coli.
