caption: Working Model. (a) In normal colon, dnTCF-1E is expressed in the nuclei of
  cells where it counteracts the actions of FL-TCF-4E and preserves a balance between
  the signals that promote growth and those that promote differentiation. (b) In colon
  cancer, export of dnTCF-1E protein predominates. Export is mediated by CRM1 in response
  to activated Ca2+/Calmodulin dependent Kinase II (CaMKII) and TAK-1-NLK kinases.
  Export requires Wnt ligand action, a soluble factor secreted in response to activated
  CaMKII since SFRP proteins and Dkk-1 can block the export pathway. CaMKII actions
  is also required downstream of the Wnt ligand, suggesting that the export pathway
  functions as an auto-activating loop. (c) FL-TCF-1B is expressed and dnTCF-1E is
  under-expressed to further skew the balance towards the growth-promoting signals
  in colon cancer.
