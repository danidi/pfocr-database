caption: Proposed model of IFN and inflammasome activation by HCMV and IL-1β inhibition
  by IE86. Cellular entry of HCMV particles into THP-1 cells is detected by the dsDNA-reactive
  PRR cGAS, which synthesizes 2′,3′-cGAMP and triggers STING-mediated activation of
  IRFs and NF-κB. These then induce transcription of type I IFN and pro-IL-1β, and
  the IFN-dependent pathway drives AIM2 expression, enabling virus-mediated activation
  of the inflammasome, formation of GSDMD pores, and IL-1β secretion. Expression of
  the HCMV IE86 protein counteracts this response both by inhibiting pro-IL-1β transcription
  and by leading to degradation of the pro-IL-1β protein. MIEP, major immediate-early
  promoter; ISGs, interferon-stimulated genes.
