caption: 'The role of micronutrients in one-carbon (1C) metabolism and DNA methylation.
  Methionine, the precursor of SAM, is obtained from the diet or through the re-methylation
  of homocysteine (Hcy). Hcy re-methylation can occur via two pathways: (1) Folate,
  in the form of tetrahydrofolate (THF), is converted to 5,10-methyltetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-mTHF) and subsequently to 5-mTHF, which acts as a methyl donor for Hcy re-methylation.
  The reactions are catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT), methylene
  tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MS), and their respective
  cofactors (vitamins B6, B2, and B12); (2) betaine homocysteine methyl transferase
  (BHMT) catalyzes the re-methylation of Hcy by using betaine (dietary or via choline
  oxidation) as a methyl donor resulting in methionine and dimethylglycine (DMG).
  Methionine (endogenous or dietary) is converted to SAM via methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT). The transfer of the methyl group from SAM to DNA results in SAH and Hcy.
  Hcy also bifurcates to the transsulfuration pathway.'
