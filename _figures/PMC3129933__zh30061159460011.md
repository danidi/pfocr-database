caption: Schematic illustration of the potential interaction of dietary fiber with
  the TGF-β signaling pathway. Upon binding to its receptors (TβRs) on the gut epithelial
  cells, TGF-β activates (or phosphorylates) Smad3 and inhibits Id2 expression. Butyrate,
  derived from dietary fiber in the gut, acts on the gut epithelial cells to increase
  Smad3 expression and subsequently to inhibit Id2 expression, thereby enhancing TGF-β-induced
  growth inhibition through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction.
