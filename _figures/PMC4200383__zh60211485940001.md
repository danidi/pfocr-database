caption: Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from a common mesenchymal stem cell
  precursor, and their balance is regulated by molecules that lead to osteoblastogenesis
  and inhibit adipogenesis or vice versa. Activation of Wnt signaling pathway inhibits
  adipogenesis, while supporting osteogenesis. In contrast, PPARγ promotes the differentiation
  of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes over osteoblasts. Besides these proteins,
  the Wnt inhibitor molecules are also necessary to control the balance between osteogenesis
  and adipogenesis. The interplay of these molecular regulators could be crucial in
  the pathogenesis of obesity, as it was found to be essential in osteoporosis. Future
  studies could reveal a putative role of oxytocin in controlling the balance in favor
  of osteogenesis at the expense of adipogenesis through downregulation of sclerostin
  synthesis.
