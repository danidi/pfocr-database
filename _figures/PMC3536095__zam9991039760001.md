caption: Production of clavam metabolites. (A) The biosynthetic pathway to clavaminic
  acid, the branch point intermediate leading to production of clavulanic acid and
  5S clavams. Gene designations are shown in italics. (B) Part of the cephamycin-clavulanic
  acid gene cluster. Cephamycin-specific genes are shown in white, and clavulanic
  acid-specific genes are shown in gray. Locations of restriction endonuclease cleavage
  sites relevant to descriptions in the text are shown.
