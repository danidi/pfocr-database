caption: Proposed model. Inhibition of PIP4Ks by a131 or a166 arrests normal cells
  at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
  via transcriptional upregulation of PIK3IP1 (a, top). This cell cycle arrest is
  reversible after drug removal (a, bottom). In contrast, mutation or activation of
  the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in cancer cells promotes positive cross-talk with the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by negative transcriptional regulation of PIK3IP1, which allows
  cancer cells to bypass a131-induced growth arrest at the G1/S phase of the cell
  cycle, but subsequently leads cancer cells to a131-induced mitotic catastrophe and
  cell death. However, it is important to note that the mitotic targets of a131 remain
  unidentified b. Pretreatment with a166 protects normal cells from chemotherapeutic
  toxicity by arresting normal cells at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle c. In contrast,
  mutation or activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in cancer cells bypasses the
  growth arrest, leading to cell death caused by chemotherapeutic drugs (Eto, etoposide;
  PTX, paclitaxel) and a159 d. Of note, this Ras˧PIK3IP1˧PI3K signaling network identified
  in this study may contribute to “oncogene collaboration” of the Ras and PI3K pathways
  for cancer cell growth and proliferation
