caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanism(s) by which NO‐independent sGC
  stimulators and sGC activators fit into the NO/sGC/cGMP pathway. Oxidative stress—a
  risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases—is associated with increased formation
  of reactive oxygen species that are known to oxidize and inactivate many biomolecules,
  culminating in tissue damage. In particular, ONOO− oxidizes sGC, resulting in loss
  of the heme group. Heme‐free sGC is unable to respond to NO and can be regarded
  as a dysfunctional form of the enzyme (NO stimulates only the native form of sGC).
  Stimulators of sGC have a dual mode of action: they directly stimulate the native
  form of the enzyme and make it more sensitive to endogenous NO. Activators of sGC
  specifically activate dysfunctional or heme‐free sGC. Stimulation of native sGC
  and activation of heme‐free sGC both lead to increased formation of cGMP, which
  exerts a profound, multifaceted cytoprotective effect. cGMP indicates cyclic guanosine
  monophosphate; GMP, guanosine monophosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; NO, nitric
  oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; ONOO−, peroxynitrite; PDE, phosphodiesterase;
  sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase. Adapted and modified with permission from Hobbs
