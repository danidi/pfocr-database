caption: 'Proposed multi-target and multi-component action modes of hawk tea as a
  previously unrecognized cholesterol-lowering agent. In brief, hawk tea extract (HTE)
  inhibits Niemann–Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1)-mediated free cholesterol uptake by HepG2
  cells, thereby inducing the transcription of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)
  downstream of the sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) pathway, and
  promoting the clearance of LDL. Meanwhile, HTE suppressed hepatocyte nuclear factor
  4α (HNF4α)-mediated transcription of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)
  and apolipoprotein B (APOB), thereby decreasing the production of very-low-density
  lipoprotein (VLDL) by HepG2 cells. The catechin (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)
  and the flavonoids kaempferol and quercetin are bioactive components mediating the
  effects of HTE on the NPC1L1-SREBP2-LDLR axis and HNF4α-MTP/APOB axis in HepG2 cells.
  In addition, the gut microbiota serves as another target of hawk tea. LPL: lipoprotein
  lipase'
