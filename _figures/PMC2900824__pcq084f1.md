caption: The SL-dependent branching inhibition pathway in rice. D17/HTD1, D10 and
  D27 participate in SL synthesis. The role of CYP711A in rice has not been shown,
  but Arabidopsis CYP711A1/MAX1 has been shown to act downstream of CCDs. D27 is localized
  to the plastid, but its relative position in the pathway has not been clear. D3
  and D14/D88/HTD2 act in a step downstream of SL synthesis. CCD, carotenoid cleavage
  dioxygenase.
