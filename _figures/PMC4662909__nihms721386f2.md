caption: Activation of protein synthesis downstream of MYC supports tumor progression.
  An increase in ER protein load triggers the UPR (A), which limits ER stress by multiple
  mechanisms. Activation of PERK facilitates cytoprotective autophagy (B). IRE-1α
  signaling upregulates the NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase SIRT7 (C), which represses
  MYC-dependent transcription of ribosomal genes and limits protein synthesis rate
  to prevent ER stress. MYC activates lipogenic gene expression by upregulating MondoA-dependent
  lipid synthesis (D), which is required for viability in MYC-activated cells. A potential
  mechanism involves maintenance of ER lipid homeostasis to accommodate increased
  protein load and limit ER stress (E). MYC drives glutamine uptake and metabolism
  to support anabolic processes. (F). This process, termed glutamine-dependent anaplerosis,
  requires mitochondrial metabolism. MYC activates an ARK5-AMPK pathway to maintain
  mitochondrial function (G). ARK5 ablation is synthetically lethal to MYC activated
  cells. Functional outputs of tumor cell adaptations are shown in red. Question marks
  denote hypothesized mechanisms that have not been directly tested.
