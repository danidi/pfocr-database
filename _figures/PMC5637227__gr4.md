caption: Systems metabolic engineering of E. coli for the production of l-threonine  (A)
  and l-tryptophan  (B). (A) The green colored arrows, “X”, and dotted lines represent
  the strategies used in the first round of systems metabolic engineering, specifically
  the amplification of enzymes in the synthetic pathway, the deletion or decrease
  of competing and degradation pathway. The red colored arrows and “X” represent the
  strategies used in the second round of engineering based on transcriptome data and
  in silico flux response analysis, specifically the enhancement of the PPC flux,
  the glyoxylate shunt, and the export system of l-threonine, and the blocking of
  the import system of l-threonine. The blue colored arrow represents the strategy
  for the reduction of acetic acid in the third round of engineering based on in silico
  flux response analysis. (B) The green colored arrows represent the amplification
  of relative genes; the red dotted lines and “X” represent deletion of relative genes.
