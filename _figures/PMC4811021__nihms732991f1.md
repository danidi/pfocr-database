caption: The diagrams of the Hippo signaling pathway in (A) Drosophila melanogaster
  and (B) mammals highlight the core kinase cascade and upstream regulatory signals.
  For simplicity, most of the regulatory proteins upstream of the kinase cascade are
  not included in the diagram, except for Merlin (Mer), a membrane- and cytoskeleton-interacting
  protein that plays a conserved role in regulating Hippo signaling in both Drosophila
  and mammals. The illustration includes verteporfin (VP), a small-molecule inhibitor
  of Yki and YAP that disrupts the Yki-Sd (Drosophila) or YAP-TEAD (mammals) complex.
  In Drosophila, the core kinase cascade involves a kinase complex between Hippo (Hpo)
  and its partner Salvador (Sav), which phosphorylates and activates another kinase
  complex containing Warts (Wts) and its partner Mob as tumor suppressor (Mats). The
  activated Wts-Mats complex, in turn, phosphorylates and inactivates Yki. Only unphosphorylated
  Yki can enter the nucleus, where it partners with Scalloped (Sd) to activate the
  transcription of progrowth target genes. Loss of Hpo, Sav, Wts, or Mats results
  in constitutive nuclear localization of Yki, elevated expression of progrowth target
  genes, and tissue overgrowth. In mammals, the core kinase cascade comprises Mst1/2
  (Hpo homologs), Sav1 (Sav homolog), Lats1/2 (Wts homolog), and Mob1 A/B (Mats homolog),
  which converge on the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ (Yki homolog). Only unphosphorylated
  YAP/TAZ can enter the nucleus and partner with TEAD1/2/3/4 (Sd homolog) to activate
  the transcription of progrowth genes. Small-molecule inhibitors of YAP such as VP
  may be useful for the treatment of the subpopulation of patients with lung cancer
  who carry the R331W allele. GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; P, phosphorylation.
