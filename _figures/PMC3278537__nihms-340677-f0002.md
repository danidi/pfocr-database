caption: 'BDNF binding to the extracellular domain of TrkB induces dimerization and
  activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain []. This results in autophosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues that then serve as sites for interaction with adaptor proteins
  and activation of intracellular signaling cascades, including the Ras- microtubule
  associated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/ serine
  threonine kinase (Akt), and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ pathways. Phosphorylation of
  tyrosine 515 of TrkB leads to recruitment of the Src homology 2 domain containing
  (Shc) adaptor protein, followed by recruitment of Growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2 (Grb2) and son of sevenless (SOS) and activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway (right).
  Shc-Grb2 can also lead to recruitment of Grb2-associated binder-1 (GAB1) and activation
  of the PI3K-Akt pathway (left). Phosphorylation of the TrkB tyrosine residue 816
  results in recruitment of PLCg, which leads to the formation of inositol triphosphate
  (IP3) and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG), which activates
  CAMK and protein kinase C (PKC). These pathways control many different aspects of
  cellular function, including synaptic plasticity, survival, and growth/differentiation.
  Basic and clinical studies demonstrate that BDNF and components of the Ras-MAPK
  and PI3K-Akt pathways are decreased by stress and depression, and increased by antidepressant
  treatments [, , ]. Abbreviations: ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; MEK,
  MAP/ERK kinase; MKP1, MAP kinase phosphatase 1; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1.'
