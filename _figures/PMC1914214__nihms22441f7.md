caption: (A) Low level Shh signaling from the ectopic source in the otic vesicle of
  ShhP1 embryos (blue arrow) results in an expansion of v0 and v1 interneurons in
  the adjacent hindbrain. (B) A revised classification scheme for Shh target genes.
  Class I genes (light blue) are activated by low level Shh signaling and oppose the
  expression of corresponding Class II genes. Class II genes (navy blue) are activated
  by high level Shh signaling and oppose the expression of corresponding Class I genes.
  Dorsal genes (red) are repressed by the lowest level of Shh signaling and are not
  necessarily opposed by Class I and/or Class II genes. Class I genes are also activated
  by a Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling pathway operating in parallel to Shh ().
