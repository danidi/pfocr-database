caption: (A) Proposed two distinct stages of SPG11 pathogenesis. Neurodevelopmental
  phenotype represents early onset within the first two decades characterized by a
  proliferation deficit, impaired cortical development and consequently to cognitive
  impairment. The neurodegenerative phenotype, marked by progressive spasticity and
  paraparesis, leads to functional neuronal deficits, motor neuron degeneration, and
  peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy. (B) Schematic model of GSK3ß‐mediated neural
  development in SPG11‐ and CTRL‐NPCs. Increased GSK3 activity leads to reduced ß‐Catenin
  level in SPG11‐NPCs, thereby compromising proliferation and neurogenesis in SPG11
  patients. Pharmacological treatment with the GSK3 inhibitors, tideglusib and CHIR99021,
  activates the canonical Wnt pathway by inhibiting GSK3 signaling and thereby restores
  proliferation and neurogenesis (shown by dashed green arrows). NPCs = cortical neural
  progenitor cells.
