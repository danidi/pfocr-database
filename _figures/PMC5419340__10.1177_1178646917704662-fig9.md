caption: The key switch is the kynurenine ‘de novo’ pathway. When dietary supplies
  of nicotinamide/NAD are not sufficient, there is Treg-induced tolerance for metabolically
  useful symbionts but dangers to individual health from dysbioses or pathogens. However,
  when dietary nicotinamide is high, there is immune intolerance with too few Tregs
  and an excess of pro-inflammatory T17 cells and many diseases of modernity. Many
  immunologic therapies from steroids to recent T-cell–targeted approaches or artificial
  infection try to correct this imbalance. Prevention might be more effective and
  safer.
