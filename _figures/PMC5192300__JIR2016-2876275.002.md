caption: 'The cellular trafficking of CD1 molecules. After synthesis, CD1 molecules
  associate with β2-microglobulin in the endoplasmic reticulum. Then, they traffic
  to the trans-Golgi network, where they are glycosylated and follow to the plasma
  membrane (solid arrows). There, CD1 molecules are internalized by the endocytic
  pathway, where most of the loading occurs. The different CD1 isoforms localize in
  different endocytic compartments. The loaded CD1 molecules then traffic to the plasma
  membrane, where they activate T cells (dashed arrows). EE: early endosome; LE: late
  endosome; hCD1d: human CD1d; mCD1d: mouse CD1d.'
