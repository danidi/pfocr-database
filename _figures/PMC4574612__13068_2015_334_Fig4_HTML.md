caption: Substrate competition for a shared enzyme, combined with product inhibition.
  The accumulation of H lignin in the 4CL transgenic line calls for a regulatory mechanism
  that guides the flow towards the upper branch of the pathway. Direct activation
  or an inhibited inhibitor can achieve this result. Simulation results support the
  second option
