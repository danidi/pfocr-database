caption: 2-TD affects the biosynthesis and metabolism of insect hormones (JH and molting
  hormone). Genes down-regulated following treatment with 2-TD are shown with solid
  blue lines, up-regulated genes are shown with solid red lines. The dashed blue and
  red lines indicate the down- and up-regulated products, respectively. The portion
  with a blue background shows the biosynthetic pathway of 20E; portions with red
  backgrounds show the metabolic pathways of insect hormones [, , , ]
