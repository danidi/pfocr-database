caption: Endogenous H2S production in mammalian systems. Mammalian cells mainly rely
  on the enzymatic pathways to generate H2S; however, nonenzymatic pathways are also
  responsible for a small portion of the production. There are four enzymatic pathways
  for the biosynthesis of H2S, including CBS, CSE, 3MST coupled with CAT, and 3MST
  coupled with DAO. The first three pathways utilize l-cysteine as a main precursor
  of H2S, whereas peroxisome-located DAO (blue circle) can catalyze d-cysteine into
  3MP, which can be further transformed into H2S by 3MST. This d-cysteine pathway
  may exclusively exist in brain and kidney. In addition, CBS and CSE may generate
  H2S in the cytosol whereas 3MST mainly resides and synthesizes H2S in mitochondria
  (purple rectangle). A small portion of endogenous H2S is derived via nonenzymatic
  reduction (dotted green rectangle). In the presence of reducing equivalents such
  as NADPH and NADH, reactive sulfur species in persulfides, thiosulfate, and polysulfides
  are reduced into H2S and other metabolites. 3MP, 3-mercaptopyruvate; 3MST, 3-mercaptopyruvate
  sulfurtransferase; CAT, cysteine aminotransferase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase;
  CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; DAO, d-amino acid oxidase; H2S, hydrogen sulfide; NADH,
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.
