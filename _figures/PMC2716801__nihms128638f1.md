caption: Schematic illustration of the Warburg effect in tumor cells and in early
  asymptomatic endothelial cell dysfunction. Under normoxic conditions, intact cells
  metabolize glucose through the TCA cycle. In contrast, tumor cells avidly uptake
  glucose and exhibit blockade of oxidative phosphorylation at the entry point of
  conversion of lactate to pyruvate because of the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase-1 (PDK-1). In addition, mutations of p53 result in the reduced signaling
  through TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), which normally
  inhibits the glycolytic pathway. As a result, lactate is produced in excessive amounts,
  all hallmarks of the Warburg effect. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibitors of
  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may reverse glucose metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation.
  At the early stages of endothelial cell dysfunction, similar to tumor cells, oxidative
  phosphorylation is suppressed and glycolysis enhanced, resulting in overproduction
  of lactate. Under these conditions, blockade of the TCA cycle occurs at the level
  of the catalyzed by ECHS-1 conversion of acyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, the point of entry
  to the cycle, and at the level of the conversion of citrate to isocitrate (because
  of the depletion of aconitase 2). This block in the TCA cycle can be resolved by
  bypassing the deficient aconitase 2 with the downstream substrate, α-ketoglutarate
  (Alpha-KG). These new data on the early metabolic stigmata of dysfunctional endothelia
  vis-à-vis tumor cells emphasize their similarities and distinctions.
