caption: Abbreviated biosynthetic sterol pathway and composition in T. brucei. In
  T. brucei, C4 is demethylated before C14, contrary to mammalian and fungal pathways
  (cf. ). Values are percentage sterol composition reported by Zhou et al. []. Dietary
  cholesterol 1 accounted for 20.0 %, and other components were 16 (0.1%), 30 (1.0%),
  48 (1.0%), 57 (8.0%), and others (0.2%). 24,24-Dimethylcholesta-5,7,25(27)-trienol
  and 86 and protothecasterol 87 were not detected in this composition, but have been
  reported in subsequent studies [,], respectively.
