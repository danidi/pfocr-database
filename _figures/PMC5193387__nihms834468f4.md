caption: Cancer cells are characterized by the “Warburg effect” wherein the cells
  use greatly increased levels of glucose (indicated by the black arrows throughout
  the diagram). One consequence of increased glucose utilization by cancer cells is
  increased production of UDP-GlcNAc, which promotes cancer progression by several
  complementary glycan-based mechanisms including (1) O-GlcNAc protein modification,
  (2) production of mucin-type O-glycans such as those that decorate MUC1, (3) activation
  of GNTs, which produce highly-branched N-glycans linked to cancer including through
  promotion of EGFR signaling, (4) sialic acid biosynthesis via ManNAc production
  and (not shown in this diagram) through epigenetic control of glycogene expression.
  In these cases, lower glucose uptake found naturally in normal cells or induced
  by nutrient deprivation in cancer cells is expected to reduce UDP-GlcNAc levels
  and attenuate these cancer-promoting mechanisms (as indicated schematically by the
  smaller blue arrows). Supplementation of nutrient-deprived cells with sialic acids
  (e.g., either Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc, bottom) can counteract the effects of nutrient deprivation
  and maintain the production of cancer-promoting glycans by several potential mechanisms
  indicated with the red arrows including (a) direct incorporation into cellular glycans,
  (b) catabolism to ManNAc, which can be re-used for sialic acid production (not shown)
  or conversion to GlcNAc. In turn, GlcNAc can (c) be salvaged by the HBP and used
  to replenish cellular supplies of UDP-GlcNAc or (d) be routed into a pathway that
  creates fructose-6-phosphate that can be used for energy production. Specific endpoints
  investigated in this report are highlighted in yellow (additional details on the
  relevant enzymes involved and supporting literature references are provided in the
  main text).
