caption: Model of the Prdm1a gene regulatory network for NCC specification. Prdm1a
  is activated at the NPB by NPB specifiers during gastrulation and epiboly. Prdm1a
  directly activates foxd3 and tfap2a at 2-somites (green arrows) and these genes
  in turn feedback on prdm1a through either direct or indirect mechanisms (black arrows).
  Prdm1a also directly represses genes that are repressors for neural crest specification
  as marked by sox10 at 4-somites (red capped arrow). Additionally, sox10 expression
  and NCC specification are likely to be regulated by other genes that are parallel
  to the Prdm1a pathway of regulation (curved black arrow). Prdm1a also transcriptionally
  activates and represses genes required for the further development of NCCs during
  migratory stages. Green arrows denote direct activation, red arrows represent direct
  repression, and black arrows/capped arrows show activation or repression through
  indirect or unknown mechanisms. GRN, gene regulatory network; NCC, neural crest
  cell; NPB, neural plate border; som, somite.
