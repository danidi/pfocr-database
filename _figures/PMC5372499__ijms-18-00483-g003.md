caption: USP15 acts as a “biological thermostat” in the TGF-β signaling pathway. USP15
  competes with the action of SMAD7-SMURF2 complex that trends to promote the ubiquitination
  of type-1 TGF-β receptor. USP15 participates in deubiquitination of the monomeric
  ubiquitin from R-SMADs, which participates in transcription of TGF-β target genes.
  Protein ubiquitination is indicated by the presence of an attached ubiquitin moiety
  (Ub). The phosphate group (P) is shown as a red sphere.
