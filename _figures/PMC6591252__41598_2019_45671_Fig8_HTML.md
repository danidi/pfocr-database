caption: The proposed model for the scaffolding role of the IQ3 motif in IQGAP1 towards
  the PI3K-Akt pathway. The wild-type IQGAP1 provides a molecular platform for the
  assembly of the PI3K-Akt pathway components into proximity for concerted and efficient
  generation of the PI3,4,5P3 lipid messenger and activation of Akt upon agonist stimulation,
  promoting cellular processes related to cancer, such as proliferation, migration,
  and invasion. The IQ3 motif mediates the binding of PIPKIα and partial binding of
  PI3K (p85α) to IQGAP1. Deletion of the IQ3 motif in IQGAP1 sustains the interaction
  with EGFR and ERK but losses the PIPKIα binding and reduces PI3K (p85α) association,
  which turn off the pipeline for PI3,4,5P3 generation and Akt activation, leading
  to the blockade of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.
