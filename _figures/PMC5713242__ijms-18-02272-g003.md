caption: Cilia-dependent Hedgehog signaling. (A) The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in vertebrates
  utilizes cilium as a signal transduction compartment. In the absence of the Hh ligand,
  the PTCH1 receptor localizes to the cilium and is thought to block the entry of
  SMO into cilia. The kinesin Kif7 (the COS2 homologue) localizes to the base of the
  cilium, where it may form a complex with Gli transcription factors and other pathway
  components. Kif7 at the cilium base prevents Gli proteins’ enrichment within the
  cilium and promotes processing of GliRs. (B) Upon Hh binding, SMO moves to the ciliary
  membrane and Kif7 translocates into the primary cilium, thereby promoting Gli accumulation
  at the ciliary tip. Kif7 and SMP in the cilia may also block the function of SUFU.
  Activated Gli (GliA) is transported out of the cilium by the dynein motor and intraflagellar
  transport particles (IFT). X and T symbols denote inhibition of gene transcription
  and protein function, respectively.
