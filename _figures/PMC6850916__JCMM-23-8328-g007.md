caption: Inhibition of leucocyte migration was included in early moderate exercise‐mediated
  improvement of inflammation. The integrated ingenuity pathway analysis between miRNAs
  and mRNAs predicted that leucocyte migration in the infarct zone would be decreased
  in the early moderate exercise myocardial infarct (MI) heart compared with the sedentary
  MI heart (P‐value = 2.67E‐04; z‐score = −2.912). The regulatory network shows that
  36 molecules (30 down‐regulated genes, 5 up‐regulated genes and 1 up‐regulated miRNA)
  were included in the regulatory network for decreased leucocyte migration. The directive
  inhibition relationship, which included miR‐125b‐5p for VTCN1 and VDR and KLF2 for
  THBS1 and CCL2, was revealed to be related to the inhibition of leucocyte migration.
  The animals were trained on the early moderate exercise for two weeks beginning
  one day after MI. n = 3 per group
