caption: Cortical branched actin controls the G1/S transition. The formation of cortical
  branched actin by ARPC1B-containing Arp2/3 complexes is under the control of the
  RAC/WAVE/ARPIN pathway. ARPC1B-containing complexes are specifically sensed by CORO1B,
  which signals S-phase entry. In contrast, ARPC1A-containing complexes are critical
  for endosomal branched actin, but do not affect cell cycle progression. Cortical
  branched actin integrates proliferation signals from soluble growth factors and
  mechanotransduced adhesion cues
