caption: Hypothetical mechanism(s) regulating stomatal closure or opening. ABA and
  ethylene can individually regulate stomatal closure via H2O2 and ETR1. While high
  levels of ABA can inhibit ethylene and vice versa. However, the presence of both
  ABA and ethylene (ABA–ET) induces antioxidant activity, which in turn reduces H2O2
  contents and thus diminishes stomatal closure (half-open stomata). Under ozone stress,
  ethylene binds to ERT1, which inhibits the ABA response pathway leading to open
  stomata (indicated by yellow arrows).
