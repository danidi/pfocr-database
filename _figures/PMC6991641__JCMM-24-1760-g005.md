caption: Schematic of proposed signalling involved in ALP attenuates DCM and cardiac
  dysfunction via activating Nrf2 pathway. Hyperglycaemia‐induced oxidative stress
  destructs Nrf2 signalling by inhibiting its nuclear translocation, which concomitantly
  with activated autophagy and subsequently reduced HO‐1 and p62 expression, resulting
  in cardiomyocytes apoptosis and cardiac hypertrophy. ALP activates Nrf2 by increasing
  its nuclear translocation following with target on ARE elements (including p62 and
  HO‐1) and concomitantly normalizes autophagy, which in turns reduces myocardial
  oxidative stress, attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis and eventually improves
  cardiac function
