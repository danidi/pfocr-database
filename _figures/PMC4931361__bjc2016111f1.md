caption: Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signalling pathways and points of therapeutic
  intervention. Apoptosis can be initiated by signals originating from either the
  plasma membrane via death receptor ligation (extrinsic pathway) or at the mitochondria
  (intrinsic pathway). Stimulation of the extrinsic pathway by TRAIL results in TRAIL
  receptor (TRAIL-R) aggregation and formation of the DISC, in which pro-caspase 8
  becomes activated and initiates apoptosis by direct cleavage of downstream effector
  caspases. The addition of either agonistic TRAIL-R1/R2 antibodies or recombinant
  human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) has been used to trigger the extrinsic pathway for therapy.
  The intrinsic pathway is regulated by the BCL-2 family of proteins, which regulate
  pore formation in the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of apoptogenic factors
  such as cytochrome c or SMAC from the mitochondria. The release of cytochrome c
  into the cytosol triggers caspase 9 activation through the formation of the cytochrome
  c/Apaf-1/caspase 9-containing apoptosome complex. SMAC promotes caspase activation
  through neutralising the inhibitory effect of IAPs. The intrinsic pathway has been
  targeted for therapy either by blocking the inhibitory action of the pro-survival
  BCL-2 family proteins with BH3 mimetics or by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic action
  of IAPs with SMAC mimetics. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are interconnected,
  for example, by BID, a BH3 domain-containing protein of the BCL-2 family, which
  upon cleavage by caspase 8 triggers intrinsic apoptosis, thereby further amplifying
  the signal from the extrinsic pathway.

  description: Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signalling pathways and points of
