caption: 'Bold lines indicate pathways reported to be activated. Thin lines represent
  pathways reported decreased. The question marks imply unknown changes or inconsistent
  observations. IMS: mitochondrial intermembrane space; GLUT: glucose transporter;
  FAT: fatty acid transporter. (A) Fatty acid oxidation is impaired in cardiac hypertrophy
  and failure leading to reduced ATP production. (B) HBP: hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; TG: triglyceride. Most evidence suggests
  that glucose oxidation is unchanged in compensated hypertrophy and decreased in
  HF, but discrepancies exist. In contrast, several non-ATP-generating pathways of
  glucose metabolism (HBP, PPP, anaplerosis) are induced. (C) Increased generation
  of mitochondrial ROS (perhaps due to changes in the electron transport chain) causes
  direct mitochondrial damage, which may further increase mitochondrial ROS production
  to create a vicious cycle. Mitochondrial damage results in ATP deficiency. Mitochondrial
  ROS may also cause oxidative damage to other cellular components and may contribute
  to adverse structural remodeling. (Illustration Credit: Ben Smith)'
