caption: The schematic diagram represents the treatment schedule and the mechanism
  of NAM neuroprotection in mouse brains. The schematic representation (A) showing
  that NAM was treated for 7 days following the brain injury in mice and (B) showing
  that NAM treatment for 7 days ameliorated neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis,
  and rescued memory impairment via regulation of RAGE/JNK/NF-KB signaling pathway
  after mouse brain injury.
