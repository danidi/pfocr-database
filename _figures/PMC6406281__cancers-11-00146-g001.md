caption: 'Cholesterol homeostasis in normal cells. Cells obtain cholesterol primarily
  through one of two mechanisms: (1) by synthesizing it de novo from acetyl CoA generated
  from glycolysis and (2) through exogenous uptake by low density lipoprotein receptors
  (LDLR). Cholesterol can negatively regulate its own levels through (3) the inhibition
  of proteolytic processing and nuclear import of sterol regulatory element binding
  proteins (SREBP2), leading to a decrease in activity in the mevalonate pathway or
  (4) through its conversion to oxysterols that activate liver X receptors (LXRs).
  LXRs lower cellular cholesterol levels by (5) inducing the transcription of the
  E3 ubiquitin ligase, IDOL, which ubiquitinates LDLR, and (6) by upregulating expression
  of the cholesterol efflux pump, ABCA1. SCAP: SREBP cleavage-activating protein;
  ER: endoplasmic reticulum.'
