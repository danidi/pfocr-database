caption: Results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR of the aerobic glycerol metabolic pathway.
  Y. pestis KIM5 were pre-grown with aeration in BCS medium supplemented with 0.2%
  K-gluconate at 26°C for 24 hours with two transfers. At OD600 = 0.3 (0 hours time
  point) additional carbon sources were added and temperature from 26°C to 37°C was
  changed in half of the samples. Approximately 1×108 bacteria were taken at 1 hour
  and 4 hours post-temperature shift from both 26°C and 37°C cultures grown in the
  presence of either 0.2% K-gluconate alone (K); both 0.2% K-gluconate and 0.2% glycerol
  (KY); or 0.2% K-gluconate, 0.2% glycerol, and 0.2% glucose (KYU). RT-PCR conditions
  consisted of 25 ng total RNA for 25 cycles of amplification. Expression values were
  derived from ImageJ software analyses and normalized to gyrB. Color scale reflects
  relative percentile changes in gene expression from the mean.
