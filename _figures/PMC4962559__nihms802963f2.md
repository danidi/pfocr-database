caption: 'A. Notch1 heterodimerization domain mutations in T-ALL. HD mutations destabilize
  the receptor and lead to constitutive ligand-independent proteolytic activation
  (right). HD-mutated Notch1 receptors also remain sensitive to ligand-mediated activation
  (left). Both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent inputs can contribute to Notch
  signaling in malignant T cells.B. Notch1/2 PEST domain mutations in T-ALL and B
  cell lymphoproliferative disorders. PEST mutations truncate the PEST domain, leading
  to decreased proteasomal degradation and increased half-life of cleaved ICN1/2.
  Notch signaling through PEST-mutated receptors requires ligand-dependent activation.
  The most frequent disease associations are shown as follows: T-ALL, T cell acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; MCL, mantle cell lymphoma;
  FL, follicular lymphoma; SMZL, splenic marginal zone lymphoma; DLBCL, diffuse large
  B cell lymphoma.'
