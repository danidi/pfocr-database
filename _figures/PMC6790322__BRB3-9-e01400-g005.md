caption: Schematic diagram of the effect of miconazole on nerve damage postcrush.
  Miconazole exerts neuroprotection by phenotypic modulation of the macrophage shift
  and suppression of NF‐κB signaling. Miconazole inhibits IκB phosphorylation and
  decreases NF‐κB translocation into nuclei, which activates downstream gene transcription.
  Thus, expression of proinflammatory cytokines is suppressed and the polarization
  of macrophages shifts to the M2 phenotype
