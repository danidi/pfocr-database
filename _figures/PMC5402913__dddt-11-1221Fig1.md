caption: 'The canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway and the effects of inhibition
  through loss of function mutations and sclerostin inhibition.Notes: (A) When Wnt
  binds to the LRP-5 and -6 coreceptors and the specific Frizzled family receptor,
  inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex occurs. Accumulated β-catenin in
  the cytoplasm enters the nucleus, leading to transcription of Wnt-responsive genes
  and bone formation. Panels (B), (C), and (D) show how various mechanisms inhibit
  the canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway. Due to the inability of Wnt to exert
  its effect due to (B) the loss of mutation of LRP-5 and LRP-6 coreceptors, (C) the
  loss of mutation of Wnt, and (D) the prevention of Wnt from binding to LRP-5 or
  LRP-6 coreceptors by sclerostin, the β-catenin destruction complex is assembled.
  β-Catenin is phosphorylated and degraded. Wnt-responsive genes are not activated,
  leading to an increased bone resorption and a decreased bone formation. Copyright
