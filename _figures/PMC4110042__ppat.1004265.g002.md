number: Figure 2
caption: A. Figure depicts the uptake of glucose by the cells (K, rate of uptake),
  and its subsequent recruitment into the CCM pathways. The latter is initiated by
  the conversion of glucose into G6P, which then feeds both the PP and the glycolysis
  pathways. The integration of glycolysis with the TCA cycle is also shown, as well
  as the generation of 3HB from mitochondrial AcCoA. The cataplerosis of mitochondrial
  citrate and its subsequent breakdown to generate the cytoplasmic pools of OXA (OA)
  and AcCoA is also depicted. Cytoplasmic AcCoA can then potentially initiate CL biosynthesis
  through the intermediate MVA, and/or FA synthesis through the Malonyl-CoA (MaCoA)
  pathway. In this scheme r(n) represents the actual rate of synthesis of the corresponding
  metabolic intermediate and was calculated as described in the text. The term k(n)
  denotes unknown fluxes that may contribute additional input to the metabolite concentration
  (i.e. inflow). Side-reactions that could provide for outflow of a given metabolite
  from the CCM pathways are accounted for by the term δ(n). The detailed set of equations
  employed in the model is provided in . B. The steady state concentrations of metabolites
  predicted by our model are compared with the experimentally (Exp. Conc.) determined
  values (n = 5, ±S.D.) as described in the text.
