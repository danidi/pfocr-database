caption: a Schematic overview of heterologous d-glucaric acid (GA) synthesis pathways
  in engineered Escherichia coli starting from glucose []. Red text indicates key
  substances in the synthesis pathway of GA. Black and bold text represent heterologous
  enzymes involved in the production of GA. b Sucrose is used as an alternative substrate
  for GA synthesis in vivo and some genes are knocked out to increase GA production.
  Some genes related to the consumption of GA synthesis intermediates, such as G6P,
  GlcA, and GA, have been knocked out. A red cross indicates that enzymes in the relevant
  metabolic pathway have been eliminated []. c Dynamic regulation of genes to increase
  GA production. The means of sending G6P to glycolysis in pink arrow is to dynamically
  knock-down Pfk-I, whose expression is controlled by a quorum-sensing system [].
  A degradation tag is fused with Pfk-I and it rapidly loses activity in the presence
  of SspB. The black “TF” indicates transcriptional activator protein EsaR170V. In
  the pathway of conversion of G6P to GA, the expression of MIOX has been dynamically
  controlled by a biosensor-based promoter regulated by the MI-specific sensor IpsA.
  The red “TF” indicates transcriptional repressor IpsA. CscA invertase, CscB sucrose
