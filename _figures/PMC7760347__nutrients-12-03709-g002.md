caption: Mechanisms governing bile acid (BA) enterohepatic circulation. In the liver
  BA undergo secretion into the perisinusoidal space by multidrug resistance proteins
  (MRP3, MRP4), and heterodimeric organic solute transporter (OSTα/β). Uptake is via
  organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) and Na+−taurocholate cotransporting
  polypeptide (NCTP). In the bile canaliculus, BA are secreted by bile acid export
  pump (BSEP) [], MRP2, and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), and stored in the
  gallbladder upon neurohormonal-mediated contraction. In the terminal ileum, BA uptake
  occurs across the apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), the intracellular
  transport requires the intestinal BA binding protein (I-BABP); the secretion into
  the portal vein requires OSTα/β. BA signal the nuclear receptor Farnesoid X receptor
  (FXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) with effects on the small heterodimer partner
  (SHP), OSTα/β, and synthesis of the human enterokine fibroblast growth factor 19
  (FGF19). BA also signal the ileal membrane receptor GPBAR-1 governing the secretion
  of peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucagon-like peptide 2
  (GLP-2) with metabolic effects (see text) [,]. Reabsorbed BA undergo peripheral
  spill over into the systemic circulation by about 10–50% []. About 15% of BA enter
  the colon for biotransformation into secondary BA and passive reabsorption. BA re-entering
  the liver can interact with GPBAR-1 in Kupffer cells and FXR-RXR-SHP (hepatocytes)
  [] pathway which inhibits the activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4α) and
  liver-related homologue-1 (LRH1), resulting in inhibited expression of target genes
  governing BA synthesis (CYP7A1 and CYP8B1) and fatty acid synthesis. At low concentrations
  of BA, however, LRH-1 acts with LXR to trigger BA synthesis [,,]. The circulating
  BA undergo renal uptake by the ASBT in the proximal tubules. MRP 2, 3, 4 transporters
  regulate glomerular filtration of BA []. The dashed red lines (-----●) indicate
  inhibition.
