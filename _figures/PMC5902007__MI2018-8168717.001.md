caption: 'The role of the gut microbiota in health and MS. The gut microbiota can
  affect the body''s nervous system function in numerous ways, including the neural
  regulating pathway, the endocrine pathway-HPA axis, and the immunoregulating pathway
  (via lymphocyte, cytokines, chemokines, and antigens presenting effect of SCFAs).
  The normal microbiome has many functions: (1) maintenance of the motility and permeability
  of the gut; (2) synthesis and secretion of essential vitamins, such as vitamin B12,
  folate, vitamin K, nicotinic acid, biotin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, panthotenic acid,
  and thiamine; (3) maintenance of intestinal epithelial functions, such as absorption
  and secretion; and (4) local stimulation of the development of innate and adaptive
  immune systems via GALT secreting immune cells, cytokines, and IgAs. When the gut
  microbiota is in dysbiosis, several diseases may develop, such as MS. The pathology
  of MS includes increased BBB permeability, destruction of the myelin layer in the
  CNS, and inflammatory cell infiltration of perivascular tissues. The immunological
  changes of MS in the periphery are characterized by an increase in pro-inflammatory
  effector such as CD4+ T cells, monocytes, macrophages, inflammatory dendritic cells,
  and B cells and a decrease in CD8+ T cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ Treg cells [, –].
  Patients with MS can exhibit gut microbial dysbiosis, with increases in Methanobrevibacter
  Akkermansia [], Desulfovibrionaceae [], Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus
  [], Firmicutes, Euryarchaeota [], Ruminococcus [], Pseudomonas, Mycoplana, Haemophilus,
  Blautia, and Dorea [] and decreases in Butyricimonas [], Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae
  [], Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, Anaerostipes, Clostridia XIVa and IV Clusters
  [], Fusobacteria [], Bacteroidaceae [], C. perfringens type A [], Parabacteroides,
  and Adlercreutzia []. BBB: blood-brain barrier; CNS: central nervous system; HPA
  axis: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; SCFA: short chain fatty acids; APC: antigen
  presenting cell; GLAT: gut-associated lymphoid tissue; FoxP3: forkhead box 3; Treg:
