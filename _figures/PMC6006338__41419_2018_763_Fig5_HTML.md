caption: JEV infection impairs the development of organoids by targeting hNPCs, astrocytes,
  and outer radial glia cells. JEV was recognized by RIG-I after infection, and then
  ISG15 was independently associated with the expression of IFN-β. IRF9 cooperates
  with p-STAT1 to induce the expression of ISGs to inhibit JEV infection
