caption: 'Hh signaling pathway. In the absence of Hh ligand, Ptch exerts an inhibitory
  effect on Smo, and no downstream signaling occurs. In the presence of Hh ligand
  binding to Ptch, the suppression of Smo is released. Smo interacts with Suppressor
  of fused (SUFU), which promotes the activation and nuclear translocation of Gli1.
  Gli1 translocation results in the transcription of Hh target genes.Abbreviations:
  Hh, Hedgehog; Ptch, Patched; Smo, Smoothened, COS, Ccoastal-2; FU, Fused.'
