caption: 'Schematic summary of the proposed role of mitochondrial cardiolipin oxidation
  in β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Oxidative stress results in increased
  mitochondrial ROS generation in β-cells. With moderate oxidative stress, ROS oxidize
  polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substituents in mitochondrial cardiolipin molecules,
  which may generate signals that mitigate ROS production via effects on respiratory
  electron transport chain complexes or on uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) (dotted arrows).
  After delivery of the signal from the ROS-PUFA interaction, the oxidized cardiolipin
  molecule is repaired in a pathway in which iPLA2β excises the oxidized PUFA residue
  to yielded monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), which is then reacylated with an unoxidized
  PUFA substituent by MLCL acyltransferase (MLCLAT) to complete the oxidation and
  repair cycle. Under conditions of overwhelming oxidative stress imposed by high
  metabolic loads, the rate of cardiolipin oxidation exceeds the capacity of the repair
  mechanism and oxidized cardiolipin molecules accumulate and compromise mitochondrial
  membrane integrity, and this leads to cytochrome c (Cyt. c) release into the cytosol
  and induction of apoptosis, which eventuates in β-cell failure and the development
  of T2DM. Circumstances in which the capacity of the repair mechanism is overwhelmed
  in this way would include reductions in iPLA2β activity caused by genetic deficiency,
  pharmacologic inhibition, or yet to be defined regulatory influences on expression.
  Block arrows denote the iPLA2β-mediated deacylation; line arrows denote the stimulatory
  pathway. SFAs: saturated fatty acids.'
