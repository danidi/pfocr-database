caption: The intra-molecular interaction between the N-terminal kinase domain and
  the C-terminal domain requires structural studies to confirm. Thus, it is shown
  as dash lines here. For simplicity, proteins and protein complexes involved in the
  signaling pathway, such as RPA, TopBP1, Tim/Tipin, are omitted in this model. The
  catalytic site is illustrated in open and solid stars for ‘closed’ and ‘open’ conformation,
  respectively. The inner and outer circles represent the nucleus and the cytoplasm,
  respectively. The CM1 motif bears non-canonical NES activity, facilitating nuclear
  export of Chk1.
