caption: A schematic mechanism of DOX chemoresistance in ERα-positive breast cancer
  cells. In ERα-positive breast cancer cells, DOX treatment switches on ERα-mediated
  EMT pathway. Through ERα, DOX increases EMT key transcription factors, Snail and
  Twist, resulting in the decrease of E-cadherin and promoting EMT in ERα-positive
  breast cancer cells. Cells undergoing EMT exhibit DOX-resistance.
