caption: PTEN alterations may lead to upregulation of TLR signaling pathway and may
  increase tumor cell proliferation. Loss of PTEN repressor role by its deletion or
  phosphorylation, as may occur more frequently in classical subtype, may activate
  downstream TLR canonical pathway through the decreased inhibition over TIRAP. This
  pathway through TIRAP-PTEN may not be the major mechanism in mesenchymal subtype,
  and the integrity of PTEN may inhibit TIRAP and then not activate this pathway in
  proneural subtype.
