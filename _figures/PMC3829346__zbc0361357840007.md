caption: The proposed mechanisms by which miR-200s contribute to IL-6-induced insulin
  resistance in the hepatocytes. IL-6 impairs activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK pathway
  and the synthesis of glycogen via down-regulation of miR-200s, accompanied by up-regulation
  of the expression of FOG2. p-AKT and p-GSK, phospho-AKT and -GSK, respectively.
