caption: (A) Under normal growth condition, DDR genes are inhibited through the binding
  of DdrO to the promoter regions of DDR genes. (B-C) Once DNA is damaged, PprI is
  activated to bind to the promoter regions of DDR genes and cleave DdrO into two
  fragments. (D-E) Resulting in anti-oxidation, DNA repair, metabolic regulation and
  so on. (F) Some cells survive, in which DdrO rebinds to the promoter regions, and
  the transcriptions of DDR genes are stopped.
