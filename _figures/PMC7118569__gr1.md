caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming of neoplastic cells and crosstalk with the tumour
  microenvironment. Glucose uptake and glycolysis are activated in PDAC cells, which
  promotes the flux of glycolysis intermediates into biosynthetic pathways, including
  pentose phosphate pathway and hexose biosynthesis pathway, for the production of
  nucleic acid and glycan structures, amongst others. Tumour cells also uptake circulating
  lactate, which is further fed into TCA cycle through yet unknown mechanisms. Glutamine
  metabolism in PDAC cells is rewired to support the production of NADPH in the cytosol
  to maintain redox balance. PDAC cells are characterized by enhanced nutrient salvage,
  including the induction of macropinocytosis and autophagy, which provide substrate
  for energy production and anabolism in mitochondria. Autophagy in stromal fibroblasts
  provides alanine, which feeds into mitochondrial TCA cycle in tumour cells. Amino
  acids are also transferred from fibroblasts to tumour cells through exosomes. In
  addition, stromal fibroblasts provide phospholipids to support the proliferation
  of tumour cells. Tumour-associated macrophages excrete pyrimidines, in particular
  deoxycytidine, which competitively inhibit DCK in tumour cells to prevent gemcitabine
  activation and thus leading to chemoresistance. CAFs: cancer-associated fibroblasts;
  LPC: lysophosphatidylcholine; LPA: lysophosphatidic acid; TAMs: tumour-associated
  macrophages; DCK: deoxycytidine kinase; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; HBP: hexose
  biosynthesis pathway; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
