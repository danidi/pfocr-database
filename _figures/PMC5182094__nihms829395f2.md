caption: 'A. Alignment of the ammosamide (amm) and lymphostin (lym) biosynthetic gene
  clusters. Related orphaned gene cluster (xan) from S. xanthophaeus also included.
  ORFs of high sequence homology are connected with a dotted line. TAR cloning sites
  for amm are indicated with “X”. Conserved genes are indicated with brackets and
  tailoring genes are outline in black. B. For ammosamide B and lymphostin, structural
  features derived from tailoring genes in their respective pathways are highlighted
  in grey. C. Aligned translated sequences of the short ORFs in amm, lym, and xan
  pathways. FNLD motif is in bold. Abbreviations: H = hypothetical protein; LD = lantibiotic
  dehydratase; P = peptidase; O = oxidoreductase; Amt = amido transferase; M = methyl
  transferase; Hal = halogenase. Pairs of ‡ * ¤ ¥ indicate homologues.'
