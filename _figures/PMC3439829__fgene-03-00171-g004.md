caption: Model for diverse cohesinopathy phenotypes. In interphase (red shading),
  cohesin binding to chromatin is dynamic, with varying residency times. Interphase
  cohesin binding is likely to be cell type-specific and to contribute toward regulating
  developmental genes. Mutations in cohesin subunits and their key interphase regulators
  (e.g., Nipbl, Hdac8) primarily impact on the regulation of gene expression, including
  transcriptional regulation of growth pathways. This results in syndromic developmental
  defects that derive from dysregulated transcription, with the possibility of cell
  death as a contributing factor. From S phase to G2/M (blue shading), the overriding
  function of cohesin involves sister chromatid cohesion and DNA damage repair. Key
  regulators in this process include the CoAT ESCO2 and other DNA damage repair proteins.
  Mutations in these regulators result in chromosome segregation defects, genomic
  instability, and cell death. Increased cell death and reduced cell proliferation
  results in too few cells to make up body structures, leading to a different class
  of developmental defects and dysregulation of metabolic pathways. Transcription
  of a small subset of hypersensitive genes, including some in the Notch signaling
  pathway, appears to be sensitive to both interphase and S/G2 modes of cohesin binding.
