caption: 'Metabolites in blue are fixed parameters, while other metabolites are free
  variables. The sum of variable CoA esters and free CoA is a conserved moiety. Green:
  enzymes participating in the carnitine cycle; purple: enzymes participating in the
  short-chain branch; grey: enzymes participating in the medium-and long-chain branch.
  All processes are reversible and the size of the arrowheads indicates the net direction
  of the flux. This model is exactly the same as published before [], without modifications.'
