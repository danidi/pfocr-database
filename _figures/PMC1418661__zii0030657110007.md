caption: Schematic representation of the role of IKK in human gastric cancer cells.
  The signalings activated by H. pylori are indicated with a boldface solid line,
  and those induced by LT are indicated with a broken line. cag-positive H. pylori
  activated TAK1 and IKK complex, followed by a classical pathway activation via IKKβ
  and by IKKα nuclear translocation in AGS cells. In contrast, LT induced classical
  pathway activation as well as alternative pathway activation through p100 processing.
