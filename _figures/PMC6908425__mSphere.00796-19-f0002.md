caption: Deletion of fumarases leads to changes in carbon fluxes and amounts of metabolic
  enzymes. S. Typhimurium WT and ΔfumABC strains were grown aerobically in LB broth
  for 18.5 h at 37°C. For the proteomic approach, harvested cells were lysed and proteins
  were precipitated with 10% TCA. After trypsin digestion, the peptides were analyzed
  by quantitative LC-MSE (where E stands for elevated offset). For metabolomics analyses,
  harvested cells were disrupted and metabolites were extracted for GC-MS analysis.
  Heat map colors of oval symbols indicate relative changes in amounts of enzymes
  detected for ΔfumABC mutant compared to WT. Heat map colors of square symbols indicate
  relative changes in amounts of metabolites determined in ΔfumABC mutant compared
  to WT. Gray symbols indicate less than 2-fold or nonsignificant differences in enzyme
  or metabolite amounts. Quantitative data are shown for TCA cycle (A), glycolysis
  (B), pentose phosphate pathway (C), and glycogen synthesis (D). Data represent means
  from at least four or three biological replicates for the metabolomics or proteomics
  analyses, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed by Student’s t test,
  and all data shown have significance differences between the two strains of P < 0.05
  or lower.
