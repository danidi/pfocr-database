caption: The circles and rectangles in the network correspond to drugs and metabolic
  subpathways, respectively. A drug and a metabolic subpathway are connected by an
  edge if the corresponding drug-affected genes are statistically significantly enriched
  to the corresponding subpathway. Node size is proportional to the degree of the
  node. Nodes are colored according to 14 ATC and 11 KEGG pathway categories.
