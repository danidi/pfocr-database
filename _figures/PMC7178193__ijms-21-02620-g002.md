caption: Adiponectin properties on healthy skeletal muscle. This figure summarizes
  the main metabolic effects of ApN, while specifically highlighting a central crosstalk
  between ApN-AdipoR1-AMPK and insulin pathways. Briefly, binding of ApN to AdipoR1
  will recruit LKB1 and increase calcium influx, both required to fully activate AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α
  axis. Then, AMPK signaling will repress the activity of NF-κB and decrease muscle
  inflammation. It will also increase, via PGC-1α, mitochondrial biogenesis and function
  and favors an oxidative myofiber phenotype, while markedly decreasing oxidative
  stress. In addition, this pathway will limit and reduce lipid deposition via direct
  action, through inhibition of ACC, or indirect one, through activation of PPARα
  and its target genes (CPT1 and ACO). Eventually, decrease in muscle oxidative stress
  and lipid content, as well as inhibition of p70S6K1, will significantly reduce insulin
  resistance. Finally, ApN could also boost insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake
  by promoting IRS1 binding to insulin receptor and by activating p38MAPK, respectively.
  Pointed head black arrows indicate activation or induction, while blunt head red
  arrows indicate inhibition. Dashed and blurred circle represents removal of the
  indicated residue. Boxes with processes in green represent net beneficial effects
  of ApN, while boxes with processes in red represent metabolic dysfunctions counteracted
  by ApN. ApN, adiponectin. TF, transcription factors. Created with BioRender.com.
