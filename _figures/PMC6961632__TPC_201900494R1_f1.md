caption: Unique Features of Nodules.(A) Nod factor activation of the CSSP. Brown,
  signaling in the rhizobium symbiont resulting in Nod factor production. Gray, CSSP
  in the host cells activates nodule organogenesis, infection, and autoregulation
  of nodulation.(B) Organization of nodule tissues. Tissues are color-coded. The dividing
  meristem cells (yellow) give rise at the edge to several vascular bundles (blue)
  concentrically organized around the central nodule tissue. The meristem cells (2C
  to 4C DNA content) also give rise to the central nodule tissue, which is mainly
  composed of infected symbiotic cells formed from postmeristematic cells by successive
  rounds of endoreduplication (shades of gray from light to dark indicate cells with
  increasing ploidy from 8C to 64C). Infection threads (green) deliver rhizobia to
  early differentiating symbiotic cells.(C) Infection threads, filled with rhizobium
  bacteria, are initiated in a root hair and have polar growth (red). The underlying
  cortical cells are activated and initiate a cell cycle. Outer cortical cells, adjacent
  to an infection thread-carrying cell, do not complete the cell cycle but form a
  cytoplasmic bridge (related to a phragmosome) that will be penetrated by the growing
  infection thread, which is referred to as a preinfection thread. Inner cortical
  cells complete the cell cycle and the newly generated cells constitute the nodule
  primordium. Drawings are based on .(D) An infection thread reaching a target cell
  in a nodule primordium or growing nodule releases rhizobia by endocytosis. The exocytosis
  pathway of the host cell targets proteins and peptides to bacteria located in vesicles
  called symbiosomes, resulting in the differentiation of these bacteria into nitrogen-fixing
  bacteroids. PTI is actively repressed in symbiotic cells. Specific expression in
  symbiotic cells is required for the production of symbiosome-targeted secretory
  proteins (green and orange), for immune suppression functions (yellow), and for
  metabolism [purple, see (F)].(E) A fully mature symbiotic cell is entirely filled
  with bacteroid-containing symbiosomes and has a central vacuole and a polyploid
  nucleus (blue).(F) Integration of the bacteroid metabolism (brown) with symbiotic
  cell metabolism (gray) relies on complementarity of the metabolic functions in both
  symbiotic partners and a complex exchange of small molecules mediated by a multitude
  of transporters. Some metabolic steps require a third partner, the plastid (green).
  The drawing is based on , , and .
