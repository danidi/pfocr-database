caption: ER and SR interactions within mammalian cells. The ER establishes important
  physical contact with other organelles and plasma membrane (upper panel). The contact
  of SR with the membrane permits the rapid reload with Ca2+ from the extracellular
  environment and is mediated by oligomers of STIM-1 (a Ca2+ sensor) and the channel
  Orai (panel 1). The ER stress response called UPR relies on the release of Bip from
  the stress sensors when unfolded proteins accumulate in the organelle. Without Bip,
  IRE1 and PERK form homodymers and their cytoplasmic portions are free to interact
  with XBP1 and eIF2α to increase the transcription of housekeeping genes and translation
  attenuation, respectively. The Bip-free ATF6 in targeted to the Golgi where its
  cytoplasmic portion is released to migrate to the nucleus for transcriptional activation
  (panel 2). SR (and ER) and mitochondria also make intimate contact, which is very
  important for cell function, although only the Ca2+ exchange is represented in panel
  3. This exchange is mediated by RyR, VDAC, and Mitochondrial Ca2+ uniport (MCU)
  for Ca2+ influx from SR to mitochondria. For influx from mitochondria to SR the
  players are an undefined channel (?, in figure), VDAC and SERCA. SERCA also mediates
  Ca2+ influx from cytoplasm to SR (panel 3). For ER/autophagy pathway there is the
  export of unfolded proteins through the Sec61 translocon for degradation by the
  proteasome, in a process called UPR, and/or the activation of autophagy (upper panel).
  The Atg1 kinase homologue, unc-51-like kinase (ULK1) in mammals, is one of the initial
  molecules in autophagy and is silenced by Bcl-2, located on the ER, and m-TOR (panel
  4). Then the PI3K complex is formed, composed by Beclin-1, P150, phosphorylated
  Vps34 (a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)), and UVRAG in mammals.
  The next step represented in panel 4 is the elongation of the phagophore through
  the addition of LC3-PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) for lysosomal degradation of sequestered
  components in the closed autophagosome.
