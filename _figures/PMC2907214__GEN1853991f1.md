caption: GSL biosynthesis and cloned QTL. Arrows show the known and predicted steps
  for GSL biosynthesis with the gene name for each biochemical reaction within the
  arrow. For undetected intermediate compounds, only chemical names are provided;
  for detected compounds, both the structure and chemical name are provided. The position
  of known genetic loci controlling biosynthetic variation is shown in bold italics.
  (A) The pathway and genes responsible for the production of the core GSL structure
  from tryptophan (indolic GSL) and methionine (aliphatic GSL). (B) Chain elongation
  cycle for aliphatic GSL production. Each reaction cycle adds a single carbon to
  a 2-oxo-acid, which is then transaminated to generate homomethionine for aliphatic
  GSL biosynthesis. The GSL.Elong QTL alters this cycle through variation at the MAM1,
  MAM2, and MAM3 genes that leads to differential GSL structure and content (; ).
  (C) Aliphatic GSL side chain modification within the Bay-0 × Sha RIL population.
  Side-chain modification is controlled by variation at the GSL.ALK QTL via cis-eQTL
  at the AOP2 and AOP3 genes (). The Cvi and Sha accessions express AOP2 to produce
  alkenyl GSL. In contrast, the Ler and Bay-0 accessions express AOP3 to produce hydroxyl
  GSL. Col-0 is null for both AOP2 and AOP3, producing only the precursor methylsulfinyl
  GSL (; ). The GSL.OX QTL appear to be controlled by cis-eQTL regulating flavin-monoxygenase
  enzymes (GS-OX1 to 5) that oxygenate a methylthio to methylsulfinyl GSL (; ). The
  GSL.OH QTL is a cis-eQTL in the GS-OH gene, which encodes the enzyme for the oxygenation
  reaction ().
