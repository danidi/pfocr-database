caption: View at a glance of the landscape of the metabolic interactions between genes
  and pathways discussed in the manuscript. On the left, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  highlighted by BCL-2 as the pivotal player (targeted by Venetoclax) and the interaction
  with BAX and BIM to initiate the caspases cascade to trigger apoptosis. On the right,
  the interaction between the Krebs cycle (TCA), the convergence of IDH1/2 generating
  α-ketoglutarate, 2-hydroxyglutarate and the TET family of genes, which finally impacts
  DNA methylation. Included are also the available drugs used to target the depicted
  pathways. On the top, in relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
  the interconnection between the increase in NAD metabolism generated by alteration
  of oxidative phosphorylation and Venetoclax resistance is shown together with proposed
  actionable target agents (e.g., KPT-9274) inhibiting Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT). Images were generated using BioRender.
