caption: Metabolic fate of 2-chlorotoluene with an in vitro-constituted pathway comprising
  TecA tetrachlorobenzene dioxygenase and TecB chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase
  (expressed by E. coli DH5α) (pSTE44) (), chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CC12O)
  (both TfdCI chlorocatechol dioxygenase, derived from Wautersia eutropha JMP222 [pBBR1
  M-I] [], and chlorocatechol dioxygenase, derived from Ralstonia sp. strain PS12
  [], were used), and chloromuconate cycloisomerase (CMCI) (both TfdDI chloromuconate
  cycloisomerase, derived from Wautersia eutropha JMP222 [pBBR1 M-I] [], and chloromuconate
  cycloisomerase, derived from Ralstonia sp. strain PS12 [], were used). Chemical
  shifts of protons from the 1H-NMR analyses are given. The relative amounts of 2-chlorobenzylalcohol
  and chloromethylcatechols formed by E. coli DH5α (pSTE44) () are given in parentheses.
  The relative amounts of lactones formed were calculated on the basis of their abundance
  after transformation by chlorocatechol dioxygenase and chloromuconate cycloisomerase,
  taking into account 2-chlorobenzylalcohol formation.
