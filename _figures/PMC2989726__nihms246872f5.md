caption: LPA2 and CFTR are physically associated with NHERF2, which clusters LPA2
  and CFTR into a macromolecular signaling complex at the apical plasma membranes
  of gut epithelia. This macromolecular complex is the foundation of functional coupling
  between LPA signaling and CFTR-mediated Cl− transport. Upon LPA stimulation of the
  receptor, adenylate cyclase is inhibited through the Gipathway, leading to a decrease
  in cAMP level. This decreased local or compartmentalized accumulation of cAMP results
  in the reduced activation of Cl− channel in the vicinity by CFTR agonists (e.g.,
  adenosine) (adapted from ref. ).
