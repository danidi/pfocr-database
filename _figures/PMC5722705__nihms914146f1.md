caption: The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The pathway begins with the conjugation
  of ubiquitin molecules to a substrate protein, forming a polyubiquitin chain through
  E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. The chain is then recognized and removed by the 19S lid of
  the 26S proteasome, followed by either release or degradation of the protein by
  the 20S catalytic core.
