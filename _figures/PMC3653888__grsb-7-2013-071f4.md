caption: 'Summary of YY1 gene network expression in steers comparing early weaning
  (EWS) against normal weaning without creep feeding (NWN) at 240 days on treatment.Notes:
  Cellular locations depicted are from the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® knowledge base.
  Differences in color denote expression level of genes comparing EWS and NWN treatments
  (black to grey background according with the level of expression; black color (highly
  upregulated) to grey color (modest upregulation). Also shown are all significant
  (P < 0.05) positive correlations (thick continuous lines) and non-significant correlations
  (thin dotted lines) due to treatment × time in EWS and NWN.'
