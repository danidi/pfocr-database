caption: Brief summary of ceramide production. Ceramide is produced through three
  major pathways. The first involves de novo synthesis from serine and palmitoyl-CoA,
  where serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step.
  In the sphingomyelinase pathway, membrane sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed to ceramide
  through the action of a sphingomyelinase. Last is the salvage pathway, wherein various
  complex sphingolipids can be broken down to sphingosine before being converted to
  ceramide by ceramide synthases.
