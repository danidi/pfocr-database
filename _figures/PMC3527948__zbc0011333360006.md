caption: TPPP1 regulates the microtubule network. TPPP1 regulates the microtubule
  network by promoting tubulin polymerization and by binding to HDAC6 to inhibit its
  activity. This leads to increased acetylation of the HDAC6 substrates α-tubulin.
  Increased MT acetylation results in decreased cell migration and invasion. When
  TPPP1 is phosphorylated by ROCK, it is unable to bind to HDAC6, resulting in increased
  HDAC6 activity in the cell, which leads to decreased acetylated-tubulin levels and
  increased cell migration and invasion.
