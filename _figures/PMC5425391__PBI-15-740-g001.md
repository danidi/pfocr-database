caption: Putative model of the inulin and isoprenoid metabolic network in dandelion
  roots. Sucrose, either transferred from the apoplast or synthesized from glucose
  and fructose in the cytosol of the parenchymal root cells, is transported into the
  vacuole and used as a substrate for inulin biosynthesis. The degradation of inulin
  by 1‐FEH produces free sucrose and fructose. Sucrose is actively transported through
  the cytoplasm and apoplast into the laticifers and is used as a precursor via the
  mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), the basic
  building block of isoprenoids such as triterpenes and poly(cis‐1,4‐isoprene). F‐6‐P,
  fructose‐6‐phosphate; G‐1‐P, glucose‐1‐phosphate; GFF, 1‐kestose; MVA, mevalonic
  acid; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate.
