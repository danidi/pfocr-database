caption: Schematic depiction of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. NHEJ
  is initiated by the Ku70-Ku80 complex (Ku) that recognizes DNA double-strand breaks
  (DSBs) and recruits DNA-PK. If the DNA ends cannot be ligated directly due to complex
  DNA damage, end resection is carried out by the Artemis endonuclease. The removed
  strand segments are resynthesized by a DNA polymerase (pol), before ligation is
  carried out by the DNA ligase 4–XRCC4 complex.
