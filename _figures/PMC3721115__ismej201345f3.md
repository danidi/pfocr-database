caption: 'Energy metabolism pathways and levels of expression in γ- and ɛ-dominated
  metatranscriptomes. (a) Relative abundance of genes involved in sulfur oxidation,
  hydrogen oxidation, nitrogen reduction and assimilation, and aerobic respiration.
  Circle area reflects total normalized expression for each gene category for γ- or
  ɛ-dominated metatranscriptomes, respectively. Circles are divided according to relative
  contribution of each individual sample. ɛ-dominated metatranscriptomes are shaded
  yellow, while γ-dominated metatranscriptomes are shaded blue. (b) Energy metabolism
  models for γ- and ɛ-proteobacterial symbionts represented in a stylized cell. The
  upper, yellow half shows the model for ɛ-symbionts, while the blue lower half shows
  the model for γ-symbionts. Proteins and complexes are colored by metabolic category:
  yellow=sulfur metabolism; white=aerobic respiration; green=nitrogen metabolism;
  blue=hydrogen oxidation. Arrows show general direction of electron flux. Sox, Sox
