caption: (a) The monomeric precursor of peptidoglycan, Lipid II, is synthesized and
  modified on the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. It is then translocated
  by a flippase, and polymerized and crosslinked by peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase
  (PGT) and transpeptidase (TP) domains of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) respectively.
  The cell wall synthesis pathway is a target of multiple antibiotics. Moenomycin
  inhibits the PGT domain, beta-lactams inhibit the TP domain, and vancomycin binds
  to Lipid II. The acyl-enzyme intermediate formed on the catalytic serine during
  the transpeptidation reaction is depicted. The order of the Fem enzyme and GatD/MurT
  has not been experimentally established. (b) Structure of native S. aureus Lipid
  II.
