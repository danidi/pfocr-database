caption: 'Schematic representation of central carbon metabolism and the introduced
  Calvin-cycle enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Orange: Formation of biomass and
  NADH from glucose and NADPH. Stoichiometries are according to Verduyn et al.[];
  Blue: Redox-neutral, ATP-yielding alcoholic fermentation of glucose and galactose
  via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas glycolysis and Leloir pathways, respectively; Magenta:
  NADPH generation via the oxidative part of the pentose-phosphate pathway; Green:
  rearrangement of sugar-phosphate carbon skeletons via the non-oxidative pentose-phosphate
  pathway; Black: NADH oxidation by formation of glycerol through glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphatase; Red: heterologously expressed Calvin-cycle
  enzymes phosphoribulokinase and Rubisco. Numbers in boxes represents the distribution
  of carbon along the different pathways (in mmol) normalized for a combined glucose
  and galactose uptake of 100 mmol for a wild-type, glycerol-producing reference strain
  (top) and for a scenario in which the alternative pathways via the Calvin cycle
  enzymes completely replace glycerol formation as the mechanism for reoxidizing NADH
  formed in biosynthetic reactions (bottom). In the scenario with the Calvin cycle
  enzymes, ribulose-5-phosphate was assumed to be preferentially derived from the
  oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway. Once the generation of NADPH
  from these reactions matched the requirement for NADPH in biosynthesis, further
  ribulose-5-phosphate was derived from glycolytic intermediates via the non-oxidative
  pentose-phosphate pathway rearrangement reactions. The biomass yield on ATP was
  assumed to be identical for both scenarios.'
