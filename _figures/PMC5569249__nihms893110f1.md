caption: 'miRNA pathways in myeloid differentiation and myeloid-derived malignancies.
  A: Schematic of adult definitive hematopoiesis. Multipotent, self-renewing HSCs
  (yellow background) give rise to lymphoid and myeloid multi-potent progenitors (orange
  background), which differentiate into mature blood cells (red background). B: Schematic
  of miR-regulated signaling cascades in myeloid differentiation. Cytokines and growth
  factors bind to their respective receptors to stimulate the activation of downstream
  signaling cascades. G-CSF signals primarily through the Ras/MEK/Erk MAPK pathway
  to induce granulocytic differentiation (blue arrows). Aberrations in Ras signaling,
  via gain-of-function mutations or otherwise, are known causes of MPD and AML (red
  knob-endline). All human Ras mRNAs possess let-7 binding sites in their 3′UTRs,
  subjecting the initiation of this cascade to let-7-mediated regulation. miR-34a
  targets MEK1 to inhibit cell proliferation during megakaryocyte differentiation.
  Expression of the transcriptional repressor Gfi1 is induced during the transition
  from CMP to GMP. Gfi1 negatively regulates the expression of miR-21 and miR-196b.
  Gfi1 loss-of-function mutations in mice and humans arrest myeloid development, and
  offer one underlying cause of SCN. Co-expression of miR-21 and miR-196b in wild-type
  bone marrow is sufficient to recapitulate a Gfi1-mutant block in neutrophil formation.
  In contrast, the AP-1 driven expression of the myeloid-enriched miR-21 amplifies
  Ras signaling by targeting several direct antagonists of the Ras/MEK/Erk pathway
  such as BTG2. miR-21 also targets several indirect antagonists of Ras signaling
  crosstalk within the PI3K/Akt pathway, including PTEN and PDCD4. The JNK and p38
  MAPK signaling cascades are also regulated by miRNA. miR-24 represses MKP-7, a negative
  regulator upstream of JNK and p38 phosphorylation. Additionally, miRNAs play marked
  roles in the regulation of other lineages by targeting the expression of essential
  cell-surface receptors. miR-28 targets the thrombopoietin receptor to inhibit megakaryocyte
  differentiation (orange arrow). Overexpression of miR-28 is associated with MPN
  (red knob-end line). miR-24 targets the type I activin receptor ALK4 to inhibit
  erythropoiesis (maroon arrow). miR-221 and miR-222 also inhibit erythropoiesis by
  targeting the SCF receptor kit. ACT, activin; ALK4, activin type Ireceptor; AML,
