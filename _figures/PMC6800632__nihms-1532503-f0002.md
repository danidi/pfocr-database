caption: At acidic pH, Mtb exhibits arrested growth on various single carbon sources
  (shown in blue), that fully support growth at neutral pH[]. In contrast, carbon
  sources that feed the anaplerotic node (shown in red) promote growth at both acidic
  and neutral pH. Notably, icl and pckA, genes that encode enzymes that promote anaplerotic
  metabolism are strongly induced at acidic pH (in both permissive and non-permissive
  conditions). Mutations in these genes cause reduced growth at acidic pH in rich
  medium and altered accumulation of metabolites in defined media[]. Together, these
  data suggest that at acidic pH Mtb may shift its metabolism to the PEP-glyoxylate
  pathway (highlighted in red), which would limit metabolism around the oxidative
  branch of the TCA cycle and decrease synthesis of NADH and CO2 release. These changes
  would directly mitigate reductive stress and conserve carbon which can then be used
  to synthesize lipids or other metabolites to further mitigate reductive stress.
  Notably, mutations in ppe51 enable growth on glycerol at acidic pH, suggesting that
  the bacterium is adapted to limit metabolism at acidic pH[].
