caption: 'Autocrine/paracrine role of IFNs on QRFP expression in a state of obesity.
  In ME, LPS activates TLR-4 and its TRIF-dependent pathway leading to the production
  of IFN-β by macrophages. The activation of this signaling pathway directly down-regulates
  QRFP mRNA. Possible autocrine stimulation of macrophages by IFN-β by PI3K- and p38-dependent
  pathways down-regulates QRFP protein and mRNA. Stimulation of macrophages by Th1
  cytokine IFN-γ down-regulates QRFP protein and mRNA by an ERK1/2-dependent pathway.
  In adipocytes, LPS-induced IFN-β secreted from macrophages also down-regulates QRFP
  mRNA in a PI3K- and p38-dependent manner. The media were harvested and filtered,
  and antibodies were added. Thirty or 300 U/mL of IFN-β neutralizing antibody (IFN-β
  Ab) or 1.827 μg/mL rabbit IgG (IgG) were used. Media were put on 3T3–L1 adipocytes
  for 24 hours (n = 6 for this experience). Data are shown as fold change relative
  to untreated medium (complete DMEM) set to 1. All data were normalized to β-actin
  mRNA. *, P < .05; **, P < .01; ***, P < .001 vs vehicle (Veh); #, P < .05 vs IgG;
  ##, P < .01; ###, P < .001 vs IFN-β alone (n = 3).'
