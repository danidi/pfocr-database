  of a stem (containing a miR) and a terminal loop. The pri-miR is recognized cotranscriptionally
  in the nucleus by the Microprocessor complex (b), whose catalytic core (formed by
  the Drosha and DGCR8 proteins) processes the base of the stem of the pri-miR and

  miR strand while degrading the passenger strand, and mediates recognition of the
  target mRNA. The downstream regulatory effect is degradation of the mRNA (the prevalent
  mechanism in mammalian cells (i) () or its translational repression (j) (; ), although
  instances of up-regulation have also been reported (k) ().
