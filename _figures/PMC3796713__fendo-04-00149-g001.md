caption: Neuron-to-glia transcellular aspartate efflux pathway for glial glutamate
  synthesis. Neuronal mitochondria are provided with aralar/AGC1/Slc25a12 and the
  oxoglutarate carrier/OGC/Slc25a11 and carry out the malate-aspartate shuttle to
  transfer NADH reducing equivalents to the mitochondrial matrix. AGC1 is irreversible
  in polarized mitochondria and the main pathway of glutamate supply to the mitochondrial
  matrix. As cAST functions in the direction of glutamate formation in cells with
  an active MAS, mitochondria are the only site where aspartate is produced (in the
  mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase reaction), and aspartate leaves the matrix
  through AGC1 to reach the cytosol. De novo glutamate synthesis in astroglial cells
  takes place in the cytosol in the cAST reaction with aspartate as amino-nitrogen
  donor to α-KG. A second amino group (possibly arising from ammonia itself formed
  in neurons in the phosphate-activated glutaminase reaction, or imported from the
  blood stream) is acquired in the glutamine synthetase reaction and glial glutamine
  is now transferred to neurons along the glutamate–glutamine cycle (not shown). Oxaloacetate
  (OAA) arising from the cAST reaction is converted to malate, and malate entry in
  glial mitochondria along the OGC provides an alternative pathway for redox transfer
  to mitochondria, which partly compensates for the lack of a malate-aspartate shuttle
  in brain astrocytes. In this way, equivalent transfer to astroglial mitochondria
  is stoichiometrically related to de novo glutamate production. Alternatively, malate
  formed in astroglial cytosol may be transferred back to neurons, as malate is released
  to a higher extent from cultured astrocytes than from cultured neurons () (not shown).
  The diagram does not address the regulation of the two fates of aspartate in the
  neuron, MAS (as depicted) or the transfer to the astrocyte (as also depicted), which
  are obviously mutually exclusive. Thus, transfer of aspartate to astrocytes is associated
  with glutamate oxidation in neurons, possibly through a truncated TCA cycle, rather
  than the operation of MAS. AGC, aspartate–glutamate carrier; Asp, aspartate; Gln,
  glutamine; Glu, glutamate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Mal, malate; OAA, oxaloacetic
