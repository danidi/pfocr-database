caption: The effect of caloric restriction on energy metabolism translates into longevity.
  Caloric restriction decreases energy levels, which leads to the activation of a
  signalling cascade to enhance longevity. Decreased glucose intake reduces the flow
  of carbon through the glycolytic pathway and slows down the conversion of ADP to
  ATP, which eventually alters the NAD+:NADH ratio. SIRT1, which is a NAD+-regulated
  chromatin deacetylase, prolongs lifespan in response to caloric restriction in lower
  organisms. Also, signalling by insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is attenuated
  under these conditions, which allows the FOXO forkhead transcription factors to
  increase stress resistance (pro-ageing). As extremes in fat mass are inversely related
  to lifespan, this indicates that PPARγ could also affect longevity, although the
  mechanisms are not yet established.
