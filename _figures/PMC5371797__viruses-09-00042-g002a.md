caption: 'Involvement of DENV NSPs in the evasion of host innate immune response.
  (A) Pathways of immune response affected by DENV NSPs. (1) Activation of the complement
  system is triggered by different pathways that converge to the cleavage of factor
  C3 by the protease C3 convertase. This enzyme formed by the association of two other
  cleavage products: C4b, a fragment of C4, and C2a, a fragment of C2. The cleavage
  of C4 and C2 may be catalyzed by two different pathways: the classical pathway,
  triggered by C1 binding to antigen-antibody complexes, or by the lectin pathway,
  in which a carbohydrate recognition receptor, such as mannose binding lectin (MBL),
  associates to a serine protease after binding to carbohydrates. One of the products
  of C3 cleavage, C3b, binds to C3 convertase changing its substrate specificity,
  so that the enzyme becomes a C5 convertase. The fragment C5b, generated from the
  cleavage of C5, binds to the infected cell membrane, initiating the assembly of
  a complex formed by C6, C7, C8, and C9, which promotes cell lysis. (2) Viral dsRNAs
  produced during the replication of RNA viruses are recognized by PRRs. Binding of
  dsRNA leads the cytosolic PPRs to associate with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  protein (MAVS) through its caspase-recruitment domain (CARD), recruiting the TANK-protein
  kinase 1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase-ε (IKKε). These kinases phosphorylate IRF-3, which
  forms homodimers or heterodimers with IRF-7, which, in turn, translocate to the
  nucleus, inducing the expression of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This
  pathway also includes the participation of the adaptor protein STING, which acts
  in mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) to mediate RIG-I downstream signaling.
  (3) Type I IFN-mediated antiviral responses occurs via the expression of several
  IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN binding to its heterodimeric IFN-α receptor (IFNAR1/2)
  activates Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), leading to the phosphorylation
  of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, which dimerize
  and translocate to the nucleus. STAT1–STAT2 heterodimer binds to IFN regulatory
  factor 9 (IRF9) and migrates to the nucleus, inducing the expression of ISGs through
  its binding to the IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE). Type I and type II IFNs
  can also induce dimerization of STAT3, which translocate to the nucleus, where it
  binds to gamma-activated sequences (GAS), stimulating the production of both pro-
  and anti-inflammatory cytokines; (B) Participation of DENV NSPs in the evasion of
  the host immune response. (1) DENV NS1 inhibits complement activation by interacting
  with different components of the complement system, including C1 proenzyme, C1s,
  C4, C4b, and MBL. The formation of the complex C4-NS1-C1s/C1 results in degradation
  of C4, impairing the formation of C3 convertase. NS1 binding to MBL protects DENV
  against MBL-mediated virus neutralization by the lectin pathway of complement activation.
  (2) DENV NSPs impair the innate immune response mediated by viral dsRNA recognition.
  NS4B interacts with the CARD domain of MAVS, impairing its binding to the cytoplasmic
  PRRs. Moreover, this protein, by inducing the formation of convoluted membranes
  (CM) and promoting mitochondrial elongation, inhibits the translocation of PRRs
  to MAMs. NS2B/NS3 interacts with IKKε and cleaves STING and NS2A together with NS4B,
  inhibiting the phosphorylation of TBK1 and its substrate IRF3. These steps impair
  the activation of transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7. (3) DENV NSPs inhibit INF-stimulated
  signaling in different points. NS4B interacts with STAT1, blocking its phosphorylation,
  and NS5 mediates STAT2 degradation, so both proteins inhibit the expression of ISGs
  by interfering in ISRE activation. Additionally, NS1 interacts with STAT3, inhibiting
  the formation of its homodimers, thus preventing GAS-induced gene expression. Red
  arrows represent the events induced by NSPs, while dashed red arrows represent those
  ones that are blocked by NSPs. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MT, mitochondria.'
