caption: The cellular itinerary and fate of classical cadherins. (A) Adherens junctions
  are assembled around classic cadherins. Their extracellular domains mediate homophilic
  cell–cell adhesion. The distal regions of their cytoplasmic tails bind β-catenin,
  which in turn binds α-catenin. α -catenin links the junction to the actin cytoskeleton
  via direct and indirect interactions. The juxtamembrane domain of the cadherin cytoplasmic
  tail binds proteins of the p120 family. (B) The surface expression of E-cadherin
  is one facet of a complex trafficking network. Upon delivery to the cell surface,
  classical cadherins may adopt either of two fates. Productive homophilic ligation
  and attachment to the cytoskeleton allows cadherins to be retained at the cell surface,
  supporting lateral clustering and assembly of cadherins into adherens junctions
  (red arrow). Alternatively, cadherins may be endocytosed. They then can either be
  trafficked back to the cell surface (via a post-Golgi recycling pathway) or ultimately
  targeted for degradation, at least in part via lysosomes. Cadherins delivered to
  the cell surface can thus derive either from newly synthesized material or via the
  recycling pathway. p120 appears to play a key gatekeeper function in determining
  the fate of cadherins after delivery to the surface. When incorporated into the
  cadherin complex p120 can also potentially coordinate a range of other activities,
  including surface adhesion, cadherin clustering, and cell signaling.
