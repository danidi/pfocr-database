caption: Variations in epithelial organization can modulate levels of cellular response
  to a given morphogen. During the epithelialization process, tight junctions act
  as impermeable seals that compartmentalize the apical and basolateral membranes
  of a cell. As a consequence, a morphogen present at the apical pole will not be
  able to reach receptors localized on the basolateral membrane, and vice-versa. Some
  receptors are known to be localized specifically to either the apical or basolateral
  plasma membranes, and variations in cell's epithelial organization will result in
  different levels of signaling pathway activation.
