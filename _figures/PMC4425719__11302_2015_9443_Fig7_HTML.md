caption: 'Proposed bimodal signalling pathways activated by opioid and leading to
  inhibition and enhancement of P2X3 receptor-mediated current in DRG neurones. Activated
  MORs may acquire two distinct states associated either with G proteins. Two distinct
  PIP2 pools linked with P2X3 receptor (upper panel) or separated from it (lower panel),
  are both hydrolyzed by PLC (that can be inhibited by U73122), which is activated
  either by Gi/o (sensitive to PTX) or by (yet unidentified) PTX-insensitive G proteins.
  Hydrolysis of the PIP2 pool associated with P2X3 receptor results in the inhibition
  of the latter. Hydrolysis of PIP2 pool separated from P2X3 receptor results in the
  generation of second messenger DAG, which activates PKC (that can be inhibited by
  staurosporine); activated PKC in turn may stimulate P2X3 receptors. Thus, P2X3 receptor
  is subjected to the two opposite regulatory influences: inhibition via Gi/o/PLC/PIP2pathway
  and stimulation through Gq/PLC/PIP2/DAG/PKC pathway'
