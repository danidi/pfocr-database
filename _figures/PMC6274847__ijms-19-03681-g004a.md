caption: 'Model for the activation of stress-related genes under different stress
  environments in plants. There are two groups of stresses: (A) abiotic and (B) biotic.
  This diagram shows the up-regulation and down-regulation of the OAT, pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  dehydrogenase (P5CDH), pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  reductase (P5CR), and Pro dehydrogenase (ProDH) enzymes under different stress conditions.
  Red indicates up-regulation, blue indicates down-regulation, and the thickness of
  each arrow shows the extent of up- or down-regulation. Yellow dots indicate Pro,
  which accumulates either in the cytosol or chloroplast depending on the nature of
  stress. Dotted red lines show activation of P5CR mediated Pro biosynthesis while
  dotted black lines show normal interacellular transportation of P5C/GSA. In A1 and
  A2, down-regulation of ProDH1 results in Pro accumulation during drought and salinity
  stress. During drought stress, all Pro biosynthesis enzymes are up-regulated and
  the catabolic pathway is down-regulated to favor Pro biosynthesis. During salinity
  stress, P5CDH is down-regulated and OAT is up-regulated to increase Pro biosynthesis.
  In A3 when exogenous Pro is supplied all stress-related genes are up-regulated.
  In B1 and B2, increased Pro catabolism due to up-regulation of ProDH causes the
  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus activating defense mechanisms
  during avirulent and non-host pathogen resistance. In B3, induction of P5CDH expression
  by virulent pathogens prevents pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) accumulation in mitochondria,
  and activation of the ProDH gene results in moderate levels of Pro accumulation,
  reducing cell death during infection. Additionally, OAT expression is increased
  during non-host pathogen resistance, causing increased production of ROS, which
  in turn activates the hypersensitive response and other defense responses. PCD:
  programmed cell death.'
