  or changes in Vmem excitability. We hypothesize that at these stages, the brain
  is in part controlling the bioelectric state of peripheral tissues, and a correct
  balance (turquoise triangle) of brain activity (long-range instructive cues or top-down
  perspective) and local signals (bottom-up perspective) is necessary for correct
  morphogenesis. Both an excess of tonic activity (induced after carbachol or RS treatment)
  and an excess of slow If gradients through membrane lead to mispatterning. The extra-spinal
  pathway by which the brain is acting on muscles can be mimicked pharmacologically,
  with pharmacological agents targeting bioelectricity (i.e., scopolamine). We hypothesize

  at the onset of Xenopus development starts at the spinal cord level, as early patterned
  electrical gradients in SC cells is required for the correct axon guidance. The
