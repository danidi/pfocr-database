caption: Oxidative pathways of alcohol metabolism. Alcohol is metabolized mainly in
  the cytosol by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to produce acetaldehyde. At high levels
  of alcohol consumption, an enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytochrome P450
  IIE1 (CYP2E1), becomes involved in metabolizing alcohol to acetaldehyde; this enzyme
  also is induced by chronic drinking. A catalase-mediated reaction in the peroxisomes
  is considered a minor metabolic pathway of alcohol metabolism. Acetaldehyde is further
  metabolized to acetate in the mitochondria. Alcohol metabolism results in the formation
  of NADH and thus changes the redox state of hepatocytes (i.e., increases the ratio
  of NADH/NAD+). Both alcohol metabolism by CYP2E1 and the re-oxidation of NADH via
  the electron transport chain in the mitochondria results in the formation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS).
