caption: Schematic summary and proposed model. ER stress activates IRE1/XBP1 signaling
  to regulate the influx of acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen through the membrane transporter
  AT-1. Acetyl-CoA levels in the lumen of the ER determine the acetylation status
  of Atg9A, which acts as the last output for the induction of autophagy/ERAD(II)
  during the UPR. Acetylated (with red dots) Atg9A prevents autophagy, whereas nonacetylated
  (without red dots) Atg9A activates autophagy.
