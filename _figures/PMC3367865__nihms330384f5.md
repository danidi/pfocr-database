caption: Regulation of p53 can occur through the MDM2 oncogene which reduces p53 levels
  through degradation by ubiquitination. MDM2 can in turn be inhibited by the tumor
  suppressor p14ARF, an isoform of CDKN2A. As such, the genes that encode MDM2 and
  p14ARF are commonly altered in lung cancer through amplification and loss of expression,
  respectively–. The CDKN2A/RB1 pathway controls G1 to S phase cell cycle progression.
  RB acts as a tumor suppressor by acting with E2F proteins to repress transcription
  of genes necessary for the G1-S phase transition. RB is inhibited by hyperphosphorylation
  by CDK-CCND1 complexes (complexes between CDK4 or CDK6 and CCND1), and in turn,
  formation of CDK-CCND1 complexes can be inhibited by the p16 isoform of CDNK2A.
  Nearly all constituents of the CDKN2A/RB pathway have been shown to be altered in
  lung cancer through mutations (CDK4 and CDKN2A), deletions (RB1 and CDKN2A), amplifications
  (CDK4 and CCDN1), methylation silencing (CDKN2A and RB1), and phosphorylation (RB)–.
