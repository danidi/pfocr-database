caption: 'Schematic diagram of HBV infection pathway. The pathway of infection involves
  NTCP receptor-mediated uptake of HBV particles into hepatocytes, followed by controlled
  endo-osmolysis that enables the nuclear capsid to enter the cell nucleus where rcDNA
  can be processed into fully functional cccDNA. This is either propagated into pgRNA
  for new virus particle production or integrated into host cell chromosomes. The
  pgRNA has multiple functions to initiate the re-synthesis of viral DNA, plus originate
  pre-C mRNA and all other sub viral mRNAs that code for all the main viral proteins.
  In the case of the first function, pgRNA is encapsulated with viral DNA polymerase
  (Pol) using HBc proteins to form immature nucleocapsids within which pgRNA is subject
  to reverse transcription by Pol to form complementary single-stranded DNA [negative
  (anti-sense)]. This is then nicked during reverse transcription as positive (sense)
  strand DNA is being partially generated and rcDNA reformed. Packaged rcDNA in mature
  nucleocapsid is then processed through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of a host
  hepatocyte leading to exocytosis of mature infectious HBV viral particles. The different
  classes of active pharmaceutical agents (APIs) that can modulate the infection cycle
  are as follows: entry inhibitors that act on NTCP mediated entry; anti-cccDNA agents
  such as HBx inhibitors, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs),
  zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
  repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated endonuclease (Cas); anti-mRNA agents such as RNA
  interference (RNAi) effectors, RNA destabilizers, and antisense oligonucleotides
  (ASOs)–locked nucleic acids (LNAs); anti-nucleocapsid assembly agents such as core
  protein allosteric modulators (CpAMs); reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as
  nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NUCs) or RNaseH inhibitors; release inhibitors
  including nucleic acid polymers (NAPs).'
