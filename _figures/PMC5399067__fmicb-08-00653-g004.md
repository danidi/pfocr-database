caption: 'Cytoscape network analysis of select lipid pathways in the serum when comparing
  Probiotic + Rice Bran and Probiotic. Cytoscape visualization of lipid metabolites
  in serum metabolic pathways associated with anti-diarrheal activity across Pro+RB
  and Pro. For each metabolite, node diameter is proportional to the magnitude of
  the fold difference in Pro+RB compared to Pro. Node color indicates the direction
  of a metabolite’s fold difference: red indicates metabolites with a higher scaled
  abundance in Pro+RB (p < 0.05), blue indicates lower abundance in Pro+RB (p < 0.05),
  pink indicates trending higher in Pro+RB (0.05 < p < 0.10), and light blue indicates
  trending lower in Pro+RB (0.05 < p < 0.10). Black nodes indicate metabolites with
  fold differences that were not significantly altered between treatments. The pathway
  enrichment score is the number in the circle for each pathway.'
