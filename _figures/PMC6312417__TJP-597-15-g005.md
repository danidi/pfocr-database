caption: A, appearance of genes based on published approximations (Taylor & McElwain,
  ). B, during normoxia, hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1 alpha (HIF‐1α) is hydroxylated
  on prolines by the prolyl hydroxylases (PHD), tagging it for recognition by the
  von Hippel Lindau tumour suppressor protein (VHL), resulting in the continual ubiquitination
  and degradation of HIF‐1α. During hypoxia, superoxide anions formed in the mitochondrial
  at the Q0 site of the bc1 complex of Complex III are released into the intermembrane
  space and enter the cytosol to decrease PHD activity, preventing hydroxylation and
  resulting in HIF‐1α stabilisation and transcription of genes that collectively preserve
  cerebral oxygen (O2) homeostasis. Note that ‘quantum’ aspects of cerebral O2 sensing
  are also outlined. FIH, factor inhibiting HIF; CBP, cyclic AMP‐response element
  binding protein; HRE, hypoxia response element.
