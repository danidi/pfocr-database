caption: Summary of putative mechanisms linking TGR5-mTORC1 signaling pathway and
  GLP-1 production after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.After RYGB, circulating bile acids
  and ileal TGR5 are elevated, whereas FXR is down-regulated. This concurrent increase
  of TGR5 and decrease of FXR stimulates mTORC1 signaling, leading to the subsequent
  stimulation of GLP-1 production.
