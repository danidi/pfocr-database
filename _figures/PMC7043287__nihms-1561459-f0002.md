caption: Schematics show the mechanism of initiation and maintenance of immune signaling
  in cells defective for DNA sensing, repairing and signaling factors (DDR). Excessive
  processing of newly replicated genome by nucleases, normal DNA replication and DNA
  repair or defective G2/M checkpoint followed by cytokinesis in cells defective in
  DDR factor result in the accumulation of self-DNA in the cytosol, fragmented DNA
  in the nucleus transported to cytosol and accumulation of chromatin fragments in
  the cytosol, respectively. Subsequently, cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3
  pathway initiates expression of immune genes, culminating in the establishment of
  aging, immune disorder or cancer.
