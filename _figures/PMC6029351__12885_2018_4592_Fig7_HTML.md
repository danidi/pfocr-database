caption: The mechanism of Nm23-H1 participating in multiple steps of DSBR pathway.
  Nm23-H1 involved in two pathways, which was cell-cycle checkpoint signaling pathway
  (ATM, Chk2 and p53 phosphorylated signaling pathway) and DNA repair pathway (interaction
  with Ku80). Moreover, Nm23-H1 also interacted with MRN complex. MRN complex functioned
  as the recognition and stabilization of DSBs and was the part of the DSB-sensing
  machinery. Thus the interaction of Nm23-H1 with MRN complex may promote the signaling
  of above two pathways

  breaks in the A549 lung cancer cell line.
