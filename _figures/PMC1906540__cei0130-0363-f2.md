caption: Activated neutrophils, which mediate the acute phase of innate immune responses,
  use the myeloperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide, chloride pathway to convert l-tyrosine
  to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde which partitions to plasma membranes to forms Schiff
  bases with ɛ-amino groups. In separate studies the latter process has been shown
  to costimulate T-cells and amplify Th1 responses in the same way as the immunopotentiatory
  drug tucaresol.
