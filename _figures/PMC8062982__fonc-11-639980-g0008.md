caption: The mechanism diagram. During the progression of cervical cancer (CC), LIPE-AS1
  is upregulated and inhibits the expression of miR-195-5p, which targets at the 3′UTR
  of MAP3K8 mRNA. Low level of miR-195-5p leads to overexpressed MAP3K8 thus enhancing
  the phosphorylation of ERK. The activation of MAPK/ERK pathway increases the proliferation,
  viability, invasion, and EMT of CC cells, therefore promoting the development of
  CC.
