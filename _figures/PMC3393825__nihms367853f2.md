caption: UPRmtsignaling is initiated as unfolded proteins accumulate beyond the resident
  chaperone folding capacity. To prevent protein aggregation, unfolded or misfolded
  proteins are degraded to peptides by the quality control protease ClpP in the mitochondrial
  matrix []. HAF-1-mediated peptide efflux leads to activation of the bZip transcription
  factor ATFS-1 that accumulates in the nucleus. HAF-1-mediated peptide efflux is
  also required for the accumulation of the ubiquitin-like protein UBL-5 which complexes
  with the transcription factor DVE-1 []. ATFS-1 and DVE-1/UBL-5 then cooperatively
  induce the expression of mitochondrial chaperone genes including Hsp60 and mtHsp70
  in order to restore protein homeostasis.
