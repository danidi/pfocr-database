caption: 'Predicted metabolic fluxes of intermediate metabolites related to intermediate
  carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways under nitrogen-replete and -stressed conditions.
  The flux line width represents the relative volume of the flux as calculated by
  the model. (A) Fluxes that represent recycling of internal nitrogen recycling. Dark
  gray, glutamate dehydrogenase- and aspartate aminotransferase-related fluxes; light
  gray, GS/GOGAT pathway; black, nitrogen uptake and assimilation related fluxes.
  (B) Fluxes that are mainly related to the TCA and the urea cycles. Fluxes are color-coded
  according to their pathway: black, nitrogen uptake and assimilation and shunting
  carbon toward FA metabolism; blue, urea cycle; green, pyruvate-related; red, TCA
  cycle. acCoA, acetyl-CoA; arg, arginine; arg-suc, argininosuccinate; asp, aspartate;
  carbam-P, carbamoyl-phosphate; citrul, citrulline; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase;
  gln, glutamine; glu, glutamate; GS, glutamine synthetase; maCoA, malonyl CoA; NH4+,
  ammonium; NO2−, nitrite; NO3−, nitrate; oxa, oxaloacetate; 2-oxoglut, 2-oxoglutarate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; pyr, pyruvate; suc-CoA, succinyl CoA.'
