caption: (A) Heme synthesis occurs through eight reactions that take place between
  the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm. The first step is the formation of delta-aminolevulinic
  acid (ALA, structure shown in the left top corner), which is then exported to the
  cytoplasm through a yet unidentified mechanism. ABCB10 can form a complex with ferrochelatase
  (FECH) and mitoferrin (Mtfn). Once synthesized, heme is exported by an unidentified
  protein. (B) Structure of heme (Fe2+ protoporphyrin). (C) Structure of hemin (Fe3+-Cl
  protoporphyrin). Commercially available heme comes in the form of hemin since in
  free heme the iron can be quickly oxidized. (D) Structure of Zn2+-protoporphyrin.
  (E) Structure of Zn2+-mesoporphyrin; notice the presence of ethyl instead of vinyl
  groups in the porphyrin ring. All chemical structures were created in ChemDraw.
