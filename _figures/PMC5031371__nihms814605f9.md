caption: 'High level microbial production of artemisinin precursors, isoprene and
  taxol precursors through metabolic engineering of either MVA or MEP pathway. Isoprenoid
  production through metabolic engineering normally involves two parts: 1) the production
  of a common intermediate FPP (59) by FPP synthase from IPP (1) and DMAPP (2) supplied
  by either the MEP or the MVA pathway (); 2) After FPP, by introducing enzymes specific
  to a product of interest (e.g., Artemisinin (64), Taxol (68), or Isoprene (69)),
  E. coli or yeast can then be tailored by introducing the corresponding genes to
  produce a specific product.'
