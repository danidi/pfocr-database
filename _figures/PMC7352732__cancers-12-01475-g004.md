caption: 'K-ras transcription regulation roadmap. Mutant K-ras signaling induces increased
  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is counterbalanced by thioredoxin
  (TRX) and glutathione (GSH) synthesis. GSH leads to the formation of the lipid peroxide-detoxifying
  enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Targeting cystine input with an antiporter
  xCT (SLC7A11) inhibitor, imidazole ketone erastin (IKE), or cotreatment with an
  inhibitor of GSH synthesis, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), induces lipid oxidation
  reducing cell viability. Coenzyme A (CoA) is produced also by cysteine via the pantothenate
  (Pant) pathway. CoA and its derivative coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) cooperate by inhibiting
  accumulation of lipid ROS (ferroptosis). In vitro cyst(e)inase treatment reduces
  cell viability in multiple tumor models. Co-mutations and/or loss of LKB1 and loss
  of salt-inducible kinase 1 and 3 (SIK1/3) activate CRTC2 that, with CREB, could
  signal via ID1 to RIPK3-MLKL (see also ). CREB is activatable by adenosine A1 receptor
  (ADORA1) and ADRB2. It is possible that loss of LKB1 with inactivation of AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) can downregulate Period (Per), a circadian gene, that is also
  down regulated when the histone methyltransferase KMT2D is diminished (by mutations
  occurring often in lung cancer. Loss of KMT2D and Per lead to increased expression
  of numerous glycolytic genes (ENO1, PGK1, LDHA1, GAPDH and others). Co-treatment
  up-regulation of genes is involved in the glycolysis pathway. Also, when LKB1 is
  impaired, pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) increases glutamate dehydrogenase 1
  (GDH1), which leads to increased calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase
  (CamKK2) with AMPK T172 phosphorylation impinging on mTOR and CPS1 (see the text).
  Aspirin can restore AMPK function. KEAP mutations or loss of function are closely
  related to NRF2 overproduction. PALB2 is a negative regulator of KEAP function.
  Docetaxel was associated with better progression free survival, overall survival
  and response rate in metastatic NSCLC patients with high PALB2 mRNA (see text).
  De-glycation of NRF2 by fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) is pivotal for NRF2 function.
  Brusatol is a NRF2 inhibitor. BTC and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) is induced by alterations
  in the KEAP- NRF2 axis. BACH1, a heme-binding transcription factor, negatively regulates
  transcription of electron transport chain (ETC) genes. Combination of hemin (we
  posit that also dihidroartemisin (DHA)) with metformin is effective in cancer cell
  lines. The homeobox protein HOXC10 is overexpressed in 51% of K-ras mutant NSCLC);
  BET plus MEK inhibitors suppress pre-replication, triggering stalled replication
  and DNA damage. Proviso: The figure construction is based on robust findings, some
  of them recently described, and thereby cited in the legend. Since there are multiple
  biological routes involved, the pretension of the figure is to provide a glimpse
  at the approximate actual knowledge that could serve for developing biomarkers and
  customizing therapy in K-ras mutant patients.'
