caption: Schematic representation of proposed models for the release of apoptogenic
  proteins from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space mediating the mitochondrial
  death decision. Different models explaining how OMM permeability changes during
  apoptosis induction, allowing the release of apoptogenic factors, such as Cyto c.
  (A) A permeability transition pore (PTP) provides the apoptogenic proteins release
  pathway. It is proposed that a large conductance pore-forming complex, the PTP,
  composed of VDAC at the OMM, ANT at the IMM and CypD in the matrix, allows apoptogenic
  protein release. (B) VDAC closure and OMM rupture serves as the cytochrome c release
  pathway. Prolonged VDAC closure leads to mitochondrial matrix swelling, OMM rupture,
  and hence, the appearance of a non-specific release pathway for apoptogenic proteins.
  (C) Bax activation followed by its oligomerization resulting in OMM permeabilization.
  Upon apoptosis induction, Bax became associated with mitochondria as a large oligomer/complex,
  forming a Cyto c-conducting channel in the OMM. (D) A pore formed by oligomerized
  forms of Bax and Bak after their activation by tBID. BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bid)
  induce oligomerization of Bax/Bak on the OMM, resulting in Bax activation and OMM
  permeabilization. (E) MAC as the release pathway. The mitochondrial apoptosis-induced
  channel, MAC, is a high-conductance channel that forms during early apoptosis and
  is a putative cytochrome c release channel. MAC formation occurs without loss of
  outer membrane integrity and depolarization. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins
  regulate apoptosis by controlling the formation of MAC. (F) A Bax- and VDAC-based
  hetero-oligomer mediates cytochrome c release. The interaction of pro-apoptotic
  proteins (Bax/Bak) with VDAC forms a cytochrome c release pathway. (G) A lipid channel
  formed by the lipid, ceramide. Ceramides were shown to induce apoptosis via direct
  action on mitochondria. A self-assembled ceramide channel is proposed to act as
  the apoptotic protein release pathway. (H) Oligomeric VDAC1 as a channel for the
  release of apoptotic proteins. A protein-conducting channel is formed within a VDAC1
  homo-oligomer. VDAC1 oligomerization thus functions in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
  (see VDAC1 Oligomerization and Release of Cytochrome c). The dynamic equilibrium
  between VDAC monomeric and oligomeric states can be regulated by various factors,
  such as Ca2+, oxidative stress and cytochrome c.
