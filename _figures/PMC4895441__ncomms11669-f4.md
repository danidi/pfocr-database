caption: A simplified portrait of the Ras pathway is presented. Components of the
  Ras pathway and other identified proteins are colour coded by whether they can result
  in the rough phenotype when mutated (red), harbour cryptic variants (green) or are
  unlikely to harbour functionally distinct alleles that affect colony morphology
  in the cross (black). IRA2 and SFL1 are coloured as both green and red because they
  fall into two of the aforementioned classes. Most of the genes that uncover the
  rough phenotype when mutated or possess cryptic variants function in Ras signalling
  and Ras-dependent transcriptional regulation. Certain proteins, namely End3, Mds3
  and Trr1, do not act directly in the Ras pathway, but have been shown to either
  influence or be influenced by the Ras activity. Our results also suggest that Irc8
  might have some functional relationship to the Ras pathway.
