caption: Interactions between RHOB and EGFR, Ras, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MYC, and HDAC. RHOB’s
  function is differentially regulated by factors including EGFR, K-Ras, and PI3K/AKT.
  EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that autophosphorylates upon binding ligands,
  such as EGF and TGF-α. The activated EGFR can then facilitate activation of Ras-GDP
  into Ras-GTP via GEFs. Ras-GTP can lead to increased activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  AKT then co-localizes near the nuclear membrane along with RHOB, where AKT becomes
  phosphorylated and downregulates RHOB. Finally, RHOB can then inhibit or (in angiogenic
  states) enhance AKT activity, inhibit the EGFR receptor, antagonize Ras/PI3K/mTOR
  signaling, facilitating MYC turnover, and inhibit overall cell growth, proliferation,
  and survival. Aside from the PI3K pathway, Ras-GTP can also affect regulation of
  RHOB by means of cross-talk between Raf and AKT. Ras-GTP can activate Raf, which
  may either upregulate or downregulate function of AKT, which is known to inhibit
  RHOB. Conversely, AKT may also inhibit the function of Raf. Furthermore, transcription
  of RHOB is tightly controlled by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and HDAC1/6.
  Acetylation of chromatin by HATs causes relaxation of the chromatin structure, allowing
  for transcriptional activation of RHOB. On the other hand, deacetylation of chromatin
  by HDAC1/6 creates a condensed structure that represses transcription of RHOB.
