caption: Ethanol indirectly interferes with DNA integrity by affecting key points
  (labeled in red) or enzymes in folate metabolism. From these key points, DNA synthesis
  and methylation are hindered. A reduction in folic acid levels decreases all reactions
  in the above pathway. Reducing methionine synthase (MTR) activity inhibits both
  DNA synthesis and DNA methylation. Reducing methionine synthase (MAT) and DNA methyltransferase
  (DNMT) activities inhibits DNA methylation.
