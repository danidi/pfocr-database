caption: The role of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)/redox effector factor-1
  (Ref-1) in maintaining genome integrity in response to reactive oxygen species/reactive
  nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)-mediated oxidative stress associated with various human
  diseases and the possible intervention of phytochemicals toward the functional modulation
  of APE1/Ref-1. ROS/RNS from endogenous and exogenous sources cause oxidative stress
  in various cell types; in response to this stress, APE1/Ref-1 dual functions (repair
  and redox) are activated as a part of the DNA repair response through the base excision
  repair (BER) pathway to maintain the genomic integrity of the cell and the redox
  regulation of various transcription factors (TFs) in cell-survival pathways. Natural
  plant products hold the potential to modulate the expression and functions of APE1/Ref-1,
  thus representing a promising therapeutic intervention against various human diseases
  including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. EGCG, epigallocatechingallate;
  UV, ultraviolet.
