caption: Notch signaling pathway during epidermal stratification and hair follicle
  differentiation. (a) Schematic of canonical Notch signaling. Upon ligand (Jagged
  or Delta) binding, the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved by proteases (ADAM
  protease and γ-secretase), releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which
  can then translocate into the nucleus and associate with the DNA-binding protein
  RBP-Jk to permit transcription of target genes. (b) Role of Notch1 in skin development.
  Notch1 is cleaved and generates its active form, NICD1, which controls epidermal
  stratification and differentiation. Early, NICD1 is present in basal cells but later
  it is found primarily in suprabasal cells. Loss-of-function studies suggest that
  Notch1 acts as a tumor suppressor in skin epidermis to restrict proliferation to
  the basal layer. Notch1 also plays a role in the hair follicle, where it has been
  demonstrated to play a critical role in the differentiation of the inner root sheath
  and the hair shaft.
