caption: GEF-H1 plays an important role in the interplay between microtubules, actomyosin,
  and focal adhesions. After GEF-H1 is released from microtubules, it still requires
  BNIP-2 to act as a scaffold to activate RhoA via GEF-H1. When the levels of BNIP-2
  are too low or too high, the interaction between GEF-H1 and RhoA and the levels
  of Rho–guanosine triphosphate are reduced. An optimal level of BNIP-2 promotes RhoA
  activation and inhibits cell migration. On the other hand, although microtubules
  sequester GEF-H1 from release, the binding of BNIP-2 to the microtubule motor kinesin-1
  is required for the interaction between BNIP-2 and GEF-H1. This suggests that the
  BNIP-2/kinesin-1 trafficking pathway may regulate the dynamics of GEF-H1 on microtubules
  and release GEF-H1 in a spatially and temporally specific manner.
