caption: Simplified Overview of the Purine Metabolism PathwayThe scheme is derived
  from KEGG Pathways hsa00230 (purine metabolism) and hsa00240 (pyrimidine metabolism).
  Indicated in red is the alternative pathway to replenish purine nucleotides via
  SAM. Enzymes central in this review are highlighted by blue boxes. PRS-I is printed
  in bold. Boxes show the essential role of PRPP in the purine metabolism. Dashed
  arrows indicate multiple intermediate steps that are not shown. PRPP is also used
  for the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, as indicated by the arrow to UMP, the
  central intermediate in pyrimidine pathway. In addition, PRPP is essential for pyridine
  nucleotide (NAD/NADP) synthesis (not shown).
