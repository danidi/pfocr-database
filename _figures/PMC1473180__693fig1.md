caption: 'Inter-relationship between genes involved in the GH-IGF pathway containing
  SNPs associated with risk of lung cancer. Interactions were established using Pathway
  Assist software and are color-coded as follows: blue (expression), gray (regulation),
  and red (protein binding). Supporting publications are indicated with the corresponding
  NCBI Entrez PubMed ID in square brackets. (1) Binding [12,888,636]; (2) Binding
  [11,832,396]; (3) Expression [11,849,991]; (4) Expression [11,606,442]; (5) Binding

  Validated nsSNPs with frequency data from Caucasian populations were not available
  in dbSNP Build 123 for genes AKT1, ARG2, FGF2, IGF1, PZDK1, and PRKCE.  found association
  between lung cancer and SNP T790M.'
