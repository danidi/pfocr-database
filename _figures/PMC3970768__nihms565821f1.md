caption: 'The biotin cycle and the known and putative roles. Free, unbound, biotin
  is the coenzyme for four carboxylases in humans and mice: propionyl-CoA carboxylase
  (PC), β-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), pyruvate carboxylase (PC), and acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC). Holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) catalyzes the covalent attachment
  of free biotin to apocarboxylases forming holocarboxylases. The holocarboxylases
  participate in amino acid catabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and gluconeogenesis.
  Biotinidase releases biotin from biocytin and/or biotinylated peptides generated
  from the proteolytic turnover of holocarboxylases, thereby recycling biotin and
  resupplying the free biotin pool. Biotinidase also mediates the release of biotin
  from biocytin and/or biotinylated peptides generated by the proteolysis of dietary
  proteins. Biotinidase may posttranslationally modify histones by biotinylating them
  in the presence of biocytin and removing the biotinyl moiety from histones. HCS
  can also biotinylate histones and produces biotinyl-AMP, which can then participate
  in the cGMP signaling pathway regulating gene expression. Free biotin is absorbed
  in intestine, recaptured in the kidney and transported in the cytoplasm by transporter
  proteins, sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) and monocarboxylate transporter
  1 (MCT1).'
