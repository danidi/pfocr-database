caption: Schematic diagram of the transport pathways during acrosome formation. The
  major membranous organelles and intracellular transport pathways are indicated,
  with the anterograde biosynthetic pathway in green, the endocytic retrograde pathway
  in black and the trans-Golgi network (TGN)-to-multivesicular body (MVB) pathway
  in red. The reported ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes involved in these
  transport pathways are indicated.
