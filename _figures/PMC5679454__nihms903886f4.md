caption: This illustration summarizes some of the mechanisms by which a stiff ECM
  or augmented cellular tension may alter tumor cell fate. A stiffened matrix strengthens
  cell-ECM interactions in tumor cells and prompts the disruption of E-cadherin mediated
  cell-cell junctions, thereby freeing β-catenin to relocate to the nucleus (β). Similarly,
  mechanical stress may cause the mislocalization of cell polarity proteins. Breast
  cancer cells cultured on a stiff matrix exhibit SCRIB mislocalization, leading to
  nuclear translocation of the Hippo signaling pathway transcriptional coactivator
  TAZ, to induce stem-like programming of tumor cells. Integrin receptor clustering
  and adhesion plaque formation through the recruitment of Vinculin, Talin, and other
  focal adhesion components is another consequence of tumor cell interaction with
  a stiff matrix. Focal adhesion maturation may then stimulate Rho/ROCK mediated actomyosin
  contractility and intracellular signaling through FAK, ERK and PI3K to enhance cell
  growth and survival. Integrin clustering may be further modified by a bulky glycocalyx,
  which creates a membrane kinetic trap for integrin complex assembly. Mechanical
  stress on tumor cells also activates the cellular production and secretion of WNTs,
  which may drive stem-like phenotypes in tumor cells through β-catenin activity.
  Moreover, the mechanical action of integrin adhesion and cell-generated tension
  releases latent-TGFβ from the ECM, allowing it to potentially stimulate tumor cell
  Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis. High cell tension
  might also alter the activity of the transcription factor, HIF-1α, in addition to
  YAP/TAZ and β-catenin, to promote gene expression patterns associated with an EMT
  and the acquisition of stem-like properties.
