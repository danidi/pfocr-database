caption: Model of TNF receptor signaling regulation of cell fate. Upon the binding
  of TNF to its receptor TNFR1, RIP1 is recruited to TNFR1 and is subsequently ubiquitinated.
  The polyubiquitinated RIP1, in turn, binds to NEMO, the regulatory subunit of NF-kB,
  to promote NF-κB activation, which leads to the induction of pro-survival genes
  to counter the death signals. Cell survival is a result of this pathway. The polyubiquitinated
  RIP1 can also migrate to the cytoplasm, where RIP1 is de-ubiquitinated by A20, the
  de-ubiquitylating enzyme. RIP1 and RIP3 can then form a pro-necrotic complex followed
  by phosphorylation on both kinases and induction of necroptosis. In circumstances
  in which caspase-8 is activated, RIP1 and RIP3 can be cleaved by caspase-8, and
  the pro-necrotic complex is blunted, which stimulates the cell to undergo apoptosis
