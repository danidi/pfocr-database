caption: Model of receptor-proximal differences in α4β1 and α5β1 signaling events
  promoting p130Cas phosphorylation associated with Rac activation in migrating cells.
  α4β1 binding to VCAM-1 or FN (CS-1) stimulates c-Src-family PTK phosphorylation
  at Y418 and promotes Src catalytic activation in a FAK-independent manner. This
  linkage between α4 and Src does not require paxillin binding to α4, which has been
  shown to down-regulate Rac activation at posterior regions of migrating cells through
  a signaling linkage involving paxillin binding to the ADP ribosylation factor GTPase-activating
  protein (Arf-6 GAP) GIT1. However, α4β1-mediated Src activation requires the integrity
  of the α4 cytoplasmic domain, implying that Src activation does not reflect enhanced
  β1-mediated signaling. α4β1-mediated c-Src activation is inhibited by p50Csk PTK
  phosphorylation of c-Src at Y529, and α4β1-stimulated cell motility is inhibited
  by a catalytically inactive mutant of RPTPα, a phosphatase that can dephosphorylate
  Src pY529. This α4β1-Src linkage promotes p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and Rac
  activation and is associated with enhanced lamellipodium formation as well as the
  reversal of FAK−/− cell motility defects. Crk adaptor protein binding to phosphorylated
  p130Cas coupling to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Dock180 is one of several
  pathways that can promote Rac activation. It is speculated that the α4 linkage to
  Src and lamellipodium formation at the front of cells coupled with the α4-paxillin-GIT1
  linkage at the rear of cells may act to promote the establishment of cell polarity.
  α5β1 binding to FN (9-11) also promotes p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, Rac activation,
  and cell motility. This linkage is dependent on FAK expression and activity and
  is inhibited by overexpression of the FAK C-terminal domain that binds to β1 integrin-associated
  proteins such as talin and paxillin. Thus, FN binding α4β1 and α5β1 integrins use
  distinct receptor-proximal mechanisms to activate c-Src or a FAK-Src complex, respectively.
  Phosphorylation of p130Cas by c-Src or a FAK-Src complex occurs via a shared pathway
  associated with enhanced Rac activation, lamellipodium formation, and cell motility.
