caption: Cysteine protease activity and endotoxin within allergens can activate lung
  epithelial cells through protease-activated receptors (PARs) and pattern-recognition
  receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors. Recent experimental data indicate
  that a population of ‘innate helper’ cells can secrete interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
  IL-13 in response to epithelial cell-derived cytokines, such as IL-33 and IL-25,
  and promote T helper 2 (TH2)-type immune responses. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin
  (TSLP) can promote TH2-type responses in the lung, but a direct association with
  this cytokine and innate helper cells in the lung has not yet been found. Although
  these innate helper cells have been identified in a number of different tissues,
  including in the resting lungs, evidence for their involvement in allergic airway
  inflammation remains indirect. Therefore the model described here is theoretical
  and remains to be tested in vivo.
