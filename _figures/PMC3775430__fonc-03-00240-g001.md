caption: The PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway. Binding of growth factors to the receptor tyrosine
  kinase activates the receptor complex, which in turn recruits and activates PI3K.
  Activated PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3, which subsequently mediates the phosphorylation
  of Akt through PDK1. Phosphorylated Akt is active on a wide range of substrates,
  but one of its most important targets is mTOR, which is involved in cell growth,
  proliferation, and survival. Activated Akt also interacts with androgen receptor
  (AR) in an androgen-independent manner, leading to over-activation of the AR signaling
  pathway in castration resistant prostate cancer. PTEN is a tumor suppressor that
  negatively regulates the pathway by removing the 3-phosphate from PIP3, converting
  it back to PIP2. Loss of PTEN leads to over-activation of Akt which, in turn, is
  associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and enhanced
  tumor angiogenesis.
