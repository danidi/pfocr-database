caption: Pathways involved in aging. There are numerous cellular mechanisms that regulate
  aging, many of which were first shown to regulate lifespan in C. elegans (see text
  for details and for names of the genetic homologs in C. elegans). Regarding hormonal
  signaling, the IIS pathway consists of a phosphorylation cascade triggered by the
  insulin receptor (IR) or the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). This cascade prevents the translocation
  of the FOXO transcription factor to the nucleus. When the pathway is blocked, however,
  FOXO functions in the nucleus to activate or repress genes important for promoting
  longevity. FOXO can also be regulated through phosphorylation by AMPK and JNK, and
  through deacetylation by SIRT1. SIRT1 activation occurs during dietary restriction,
  as does inhibition of TOR signaling. TOR function can also be inhibited by rapamycin;
  in either case, this results in an increase in autophagy, as well as a decrease
  in translation through activation of eIF4EBP and suppression of S6K. The FOXA and
  NRF transcription factors are also required to extend longevity through dietary
  restriction. Additionally, factors that monitor components of the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain and ROS generation function during aging, such as COQ7,
  which is required for the production of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q).
