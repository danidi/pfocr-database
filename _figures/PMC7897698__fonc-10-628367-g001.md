caption: 'A model summarizing the regulation of MIR211 gene expression: MIR211 gene
  is nested within the TRMP1 transcript. TRPM1 transcription is promoted by the transcription
  factor MITF, and the latter’s transcription is in turn regulated by the Notch signaling
  pathway via the expression of RBPJK. The DNA methyl transferase DNMT1 regulates
  the epigenetic state of TRPM1 gene via promoter methylation. MIR211 negatively regulates
  various genes, including MLANA, PRAME, RABB22A, KCNMA1, and BRN2. Simultaneously
  BRN2 gene product induces MIR211expression through an unknown mechanism. Apart from
  that, MIR211 expression also negatively regulated by pro-apoptotic protein BCL2
  through MITF inhibition. The BRAFV600E mutation, a frequent driver mutation for
  melanoma, activates BRN2, which is negatively regulated by MIR211. EMT is Epithelial
  Mesenchymal Transition. The inset is a color-coded summary of salient mRNA expression
  patterns in different cell types related to melanoma formation (blue, MITF; orange,
  TRPM1; red, MIR211; green, BRN2). The Y-axis is an arbitrary scale of gene expression
  levels, used as a schematic representation of the salient points on how MIR211 expression
  varies in various cell types. See text for evidence regarding these circuits and
  the gene expression levels from the following sources (, , –). *Proposed negative
  regulation.'
