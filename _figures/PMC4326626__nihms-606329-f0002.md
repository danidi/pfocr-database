caption: Pathway interaction networks for differentially and concordantly expressed
  genes (DCEG) and top-ranked candidates between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
  A. Interaction network constructed from the pathways significantly enriched with
  DCEGs from the discovery sample. Node size and edge width are proportional to pathway
  enrichment significance level and pathway interaction significance level, respectively.
  Fc gamma receptor mediated phagocytosis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and axon
  guidance pathways had the strongest mutual interactions, and the triangle formed
  by these three pathways were highlighted by solid, red edges. B. Interaction network
  constructed from the top-ranked DCEG candidates from the replication sample. The
  legends were the same as in A. The interactions between the regulation of actin
  cytoskeleton, axon guidance, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and pancreatic cancer
  were replicated between the discovery and replication samples.
