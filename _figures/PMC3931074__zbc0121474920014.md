caption: PAK1 and GEF-H1 in ANP-induced microtubule stabilization and attenuation
  of thrombin- and ventilator-induced endothelial hyperpermeability and acute lung
  injury. Thrombin or HTV-related pathologic mechanical forces induce peripheral microtubule
  disassembly, activation of microtubule-released Rho-specific GEF-H1, and stimulation
  of the Rho-dependent pathway of endothelial permeability and lung barrier dysfunction.
  ANP stimulates Rac GTPase and its effector PAK1, which down-regulates GEF-H1 activity
  via phosphorylation at Ser885. In addition, PAK1 stabilizes microtubules and promotes
  GEF-H1 recruitment to MT and further GEF-H1 inactivation. As a result, ANP-induced
  GEF-H1 inactivation and MT stabilization reduce RhoA signaling, abrogate barrier-disruptive
  effects of pathologic mechanical and chemical stimulation, and prevent increased
  vascular leak associated with ALI/ARDS.
