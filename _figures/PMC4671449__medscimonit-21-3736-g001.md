caption: Normal cells rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to meet their
  energy needs. The majority of cancer cells depend on aerobic glycolysis, e.g., Warburg
  effect. The Warburg effect confers on these cells the ability to undergo glucose
  fermentation in the presence of adequate oxygen levels. Interestingly, in normal
  healthy invertebrates, e.g., Mytilus edulis, some tissues can respire via this “Warburg”
  pathway []. This further indicates that mitochondria exhibit biochemical and functional
  variation, including the capacity for aerobic glycolysis []. In this regard, M.
  edulis has been well studied [–]. Thus, when hypoxia gives way to anoxia, an additional
  metabolic pathway is employed [], allowing the animal to survive, especially since
  this animal is intertidal [,]. Further, the aerobic glycolysis hypothesis suggests
  most cancers rely on this pathway and, considering its origin or presence in simple
  animals, for example, mammalian cancers may represent a reversion to this low-energy
  – yielding pathway because its genomics are present in our cells.
