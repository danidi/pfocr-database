caption: Catalytic diaminations were conducted with N-sulfonyl-2-allylanilines and
  unsaturated hydroxylamine derivatives using sulfonamides as exogenous amines and
  MnO2 as the stoichiometric oxidant ( and )., For the catalytic diastereoselective
  or racemic process, copper(2-ethylhexanoate)2 is the most efficient copper salt,
  MnO2 is the most efficient oxidant and the hindered pyridine, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine,
  is the most efficient base (this more soluble base reduces a hydroamination side
  product likely formed from proton-promoted cyclization). For N-sulfonyl-2-allylanilines,
  use of (t-BuO)2 can be a lower yielding replacement for MnO2 and K2CO3 or Cs2CO3
  can be replacements for the pyridine base in some instances (). Under the catalytic
  conditions, diamination of N-tosyl-2-allylaniline occurred with concomitant formation
  of 31% of the sultam side product. Substrates functionalized with the hindered 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxyarylsulfonyl
  group or alkyl-sulfonamides could be used instead to discourage the carboamination
  pathway.
