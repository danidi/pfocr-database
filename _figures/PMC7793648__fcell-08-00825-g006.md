caption: Model for the regulatory role of MACC1 in osteosarcoma progression. MACC1
  promotes cell proliferation through the HGF/c-Met pathway, and contributes to the
  proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial cells via the regulation
  of microtubule stability, which further promotes osteosarcoma progression.
