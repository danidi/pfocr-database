caption: Distinct effects on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling
  by BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type cells. (A) In BRAF-mutant
  melanoma cells, both BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) inhibit the
  MAPK pathway, resulting in increased apoptosis, tumor antigen expression, and decreased
  release and/or expression of suppressive cytokines and ligands (eg, interleukin-6,
  interleukin-10, transforming growth factor beta, programmed cell death protein 1
  ligand). (B) BRAF inhibition in BRAF wild-type cells that have upstream MAPK signaling
  results in paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway. This phenomenon can increase
  effector T or natural killer cell function but also has the potential to lead to
  exhaustion. Overreacting T cells could attack normal cells causing autoimmune toxicity.
  The paradoxical MAPK activation could also have the potential to increase immune
  suppressive cell functions (eg, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, T regulatory cells).
  (C) Adding a MEKi to the BRAFi in BRAF wild-type immune cells could decrease autoimmune
  toxicity or release of suppressive factors and inhibit immune suppressive cells.
  There might be detrimental effects on T-cell functions, but there is also the potential
  to balance the overexhausted T cells. P, phosporylation.
