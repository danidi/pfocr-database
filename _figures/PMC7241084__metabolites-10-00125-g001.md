caption: 'Schematic diagram showing Idi–CrtE (isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase-Geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase) enzyme assembly. (a) Pathway of carotenoid synthesis in bacterial
  cells. (b) Idi–CrtE enzyme assembly using the RIAD–RIDD peptide enhances carotenoid
  synthesis. For carotenoid synthesis, Idi and CrtE represent the limiting step between
  the upstream MEP pathway and the downstream carotenoid pathway. GA3P: D-glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; PYR: pyruvate; MEP: 2-C-methyl-D-Erythritol-4phosphate; HMBPP: 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)butenyl4-diphosphate;
  DXS: 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXR: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase;
  MCT: 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-Derythritol synthase; HDS: 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl
  4-diphosphate synthase; IPP: isopentenyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP: dimethylallyl pyrophosphate;
  GGPP: geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.'
