caption: Diagrammatic representation of biased signaling at a G-protein coupled receptor
  (GPCR). In this example, an unbiased agonist is depicted that engages the GPCR and
  activates both G protein-dependent [i.e., adenylyl cyclase/cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP)] and -independent (i.e., β-arrestin) signaling pathways. A biased agonist
  engages the receptor to generate a GPCR-ligand conformational ensemble that preferentially
  activates one or the other signaling cascade. If the preferentially activated signaling
  pathway were associated with a therapeutic effect vs. a harmful response from the
  non-preferred signaling pathway, the resulting signal bias could generate a pharmacologically
  improved therapeutic with less risk of on-target adverse events as compared to the
  unbiased ligand.
