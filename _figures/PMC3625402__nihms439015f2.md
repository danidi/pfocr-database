caption: Schematized pathway showing the sorting of amyloid precursor protein (APP)
  (red dumbbell ) and BACE (β-secretase) (blue dumbbell ) into post-trans-Golgi network
  (TGN) compartments. The retromer retrieves endosomal proteins and conveys them to
  the TGN. Retromer deficiency leads to excess retention in the endosome and, theoretically,
  excess generation of Aβ because of enhanced cleavage of APP by BACE or (not shown)
  cleavage of APP carboxyl terminal fragments by γ-secretase. Reprinted with permission
