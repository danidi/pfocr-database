number: Figure 2
caption: 'The first half of the figure (blue) shows the hypothetical pathways for
  sulfur utilization in the Sulfolobales, including both oxidizing and reducing pathways,
  beginning with elemental sulfur. Sulfur reducing complexes: hydrogenase (Hyd), sulfur
  reductase (SR). Sulfur oxidizing enzymes: sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR), thiosulfate:quinone
  oxidoreductase (TQO), Sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase (SAOR), adenylylsulfate reductase
  (APSR), adenylylsulfate:phosphate adenyltransferase (APAT). The second panel shows
  a hypothetical pathway for the oxidation of ferrous iron using several fox stimulon
  proteins as well as some iron-responsive respiratory proteins. Ferrous-Oxidation
  (Fox), rusticyanin (Rus), cystathionine-β-synthase containing protein subunits A
  and B (CbsAB), sulfur oxidation (Sox), NADH dehydrogenase (NAD),.'
