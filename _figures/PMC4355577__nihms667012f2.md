caption: Cancer stem cell (CSCs) are metastatic cancer cells that can self-renew.
  Their plasticity and dormancy correlates with their therapeutic resistance. By secreting
  CXCL12, IL6, and IL8, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote cancer cell stemness
  through upregulating NF-κB while CSCs secrete IL6 to attract more MSCs. They also
  produce the antagonist, Gremlin 1, to promote the undifferentiated state. Surrounding
  tumor cells produce IL4 to accumulate TH2, which produces TNFα to upregulate the
  NF-κB signaling pathway and facilitates a pro-tumor microenvironment. In such a
  microenvironment, tumor cells produce M-CSF, GM-CSF and G-CSF to induce expansion
  of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),
  tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and dendritic cells (DCs). TAM produces TNFα
  and TGF-β to promote NF-κB dependent or TGF-β dependent EMT and thus enhance CSC
  plasticity. TGF-β can also directly interact with NF-κB signaling pathways to further
  enhance cancer cell stemness. In addition, TGF-β produced by TAMs accumulates Treg
  cells. In addition, TAM, TReg and the hypoxic environment inhibit immunosurveillance
  by inhibiting CD8+ T cell and NK cells cytotoxicity and macrophage phagocytosis.
  A subset of anti-tumor stimulatory DCs necessary for T-cell-mediated tumor rejection
  is kept away from the niche. Furthermore, hypoxia increases ROS, which promotes
  cell survival and induces EMT through the TGF-β signaling pathway. Both hypoxia
  and ROS induce CSCs to express HIF-1α, directly promote EMT. Moreover, hypoxia also
  inhibits cell proliferation by downregulating c-Myc expression, enhancing stemness.
  Hypoxia further promotes cancer cell stemness by promoting an undifferentiated state
  through TGF-β and WNT signaling pathways. Under hypoxia, endothelial cells produce
  TF to promote angiogenesis. CSCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) produce
  CXCL12 to promote angiogenesis, and hypoxia causes both CSCs and endothelial cells
  to produce VEGF, which further induces angiogenesis. CAFs produce TNC and HGF to
  enhance WNT and NOTCH signaling for CSC maintenance. CAFs also produce MMP2, 3,
  and 9. Along with the MMP10 produced by CSCs, those MMPs promote ECM degradation
  and remodeling which enhances EMT and CSC state. Of note, this figure does not provide
  spatial information as to the exact localization of CSCs and niche cells.
