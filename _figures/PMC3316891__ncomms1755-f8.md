caption: Schematic model for the epigenetic regulation of energy metabolism by LSD1.
  FAD-dependent LSD1 facilitates metabolic changes through the repression of energy-expenditure
  genes via H3K4 demethylation. This pathway may be influenced by nutrients and/or
  fluctuating FAD level, implicating the link between energetic information and the
  epigenome.
