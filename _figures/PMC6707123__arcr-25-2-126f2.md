caption: 'Schematic representation of the neural circuitry underlying the control
  of circadian rhythms. The circadian pacemaker resides just above the base of the
  brain in a distinct region of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus
  (SCN). Cells of the SCN mutually interact and contain a number of chemicals important
  in cellular communication, including the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid
  (GABA) and one or more neuropeptides (NP). The SCN receives incoming information
  from three primary sources: (1) the retina of the eye, which sends signals about
  environmental lighting to the SCN along a direct pathway that uses glutamate (GLU)
  as its primary transmitter, along with at least two different NPs; (2) the intergeniculate
  leaflet (IGL) of the visual thalamus, which receives retinal signals and sends signals
  to the SCN via a pathway that employs both GABA and neuropeptide Y (NPY) as transmitters;
  and (3) the raphe cell groups of the midbrain, which use the monoamine serotonin
  (5 HT) as the primary neurotransmitter and also send signals to the IGL. As indicated,
  the serotonin pathways to the SCN (and IGL) are most likely involved in mediating,
  at least in part, the effects of alcohol on the circadian pacemaker in the SCN.
  However, alcohol also is known to interact with GLU, GABA, and NP signaling elsewhere
  in the brain. Thus, these systems also may be important for the circadian effects
  of alcohol.'
