caption: a, PD-1 is expressed on the surface of immune cells called T cells. When
  PD-1 is bound by a ligand produced by tumour cells, PD-1 signalling renders the
  T cell inactive, preventing immune responses that would destroy the tumour. Treatment
  with an antibody to PD-1 blocks ligand binding and so PD-1 signalling, instead promoting
  the PI3K signalling pathway, which is involved in T-cell activation. As such, anti-PD-1
  treatment triggers an immune response, b, Wartewig et al.  have demonstrated that
  PD-1 signalling in a mouse model of T cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma prevents proliferation
  of cancerous T cells (the source of the PD-1 ligand was not defined). In these mice,
  anti-PD-1 treatment can aggravate disease by reactivating the cancerous cells to
  enable their continuous proliferation.
