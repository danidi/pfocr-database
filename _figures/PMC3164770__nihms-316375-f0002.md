caption: The VHL gene complex targets hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) for ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation. When there is a mutation in the VHL gene in clear cell kidney cancer,
  in either the elongin binding or HIF binding domain (A), HIF is not degraded and
  over-accumulates. Increased HIF levels lead to increased transcription of a number
  of downstream pathway genes that are thought to be important in kidney cancer, such
  as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transport (GLUT-1), and transforming
  growth factor alpha (TGF-α) (B). Targeted approaches to therapy include tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors that target the downstream gene receptors (C). From Linehan et
  al. with permission ().
