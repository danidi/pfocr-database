caption: Biogenesis of circRNA and piRNA. (A) CircRNAs are generated from pre-mRNA
  through back-splicing, connecting 5’ splice site to an upstream 3’ slice site. The
  exon circRNAs (ecircRNAs) are synthesized by either RNA-binding protein (RBP)-driven
  circularization or lariat-driven circularization that involves exon skipping due
  to partial folding of the RNA during transcription of the pre-mRNA. Exon intron
  circRNAs (EIciRNAs) retain the introns during biogenesis, whereas ciRNAs are derived
  from lariat intron that is excised from pre-mRNA. (B) PiRNAs are transcribed from
  piRNA clusters and are processed from single-stranded precursor transcripts. They
  are then loaded onto Piwi or PIWIL1 (or its isoforms PIWIL2, PIWIL3, and PIWIL4).
  Alternatively, they are amplified through the Ping-Pong cycle, in which PIWI proteins
  associated with antisense piRNAs cleaves piRNA precursors in the sense strand, or
  vice versa. The Ping-Pong pathway silences the expression of the target transposon,
  while simultaneously amplifying the piRNA sequence.
