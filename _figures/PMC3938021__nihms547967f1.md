caption: A schematic representation of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex. The shape
  of α-dystroglycan is deduced from electron micrographs of fully processed mature
  chicken α-dystroglycan.[] Filled circles indicate O-glycans, with the laminin binding
  glycan structure believed to be associated with some of those on the N-terminal
  lobe.
