caption: 'Replication cycle of HIV: graphical depiction of the major events of the
  HIV replication cycle. Viral entry is mediated by binding of Env to CD4 and a co-receptor
  (CXCR4 or CCR5). After the viral membrane fuses with the plasma membrane the capsid
  and RNA genome are transported into the nucleus. The viral genome is reversed transcribed
  by Pol and integrates into the host genome. The host RNA polymerase transcribes
  RNA copies of the genome, which are exported in an unspliced form to produce Gag
  and Gag–Pol or various spliced forms to produce the other viral proteins. Unspliced
  RNA genomes are also packaged into newly formed virions. Most viral protein translation
  occurs in the cytoplasm, but Env gp160 is translated into the lumen of the rough
  ER and transported through the secretory pathway, where it is glycosylated and cleaved
  by furin into gp120 and gp41.'
