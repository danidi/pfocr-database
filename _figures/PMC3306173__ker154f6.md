caption: 'Activation of the TLR3 pathway. Endosomal poly(I:C)-bound TLR3 activates
  Toll/IL1R-domain containing adapter-inducing interferon beta, a TLR adaptor molecule
  as well as members of the TRAF family, leading to the activation of the TBK1–IKKε
  complex. This complex phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7, transcription factors that regulate
  IFN response genes such as IFN-β and IP-10. ISRE: interferon-stimulated response
  elements.'
