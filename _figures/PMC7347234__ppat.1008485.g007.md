caption: Haemoglobin-derived haem activates peroxide antimalarials within the parasite
  digestive vacuole. The resulting drug-derived radicals initially damage components
  proximal to the activation site, including proteases involved in haemoglobin digestion
  (arrow shown in blue). This leads to disruption of the haemoglobin degradation pathway.
  To correct for peroxide-induced damage, parasites may respond by increasing the
  levels of proteases involved in haemoglobin catabolism. Peroxide radicals induce
  further oxidative insult and cause widespread alkylation of parasite components
  as the duration of drug exposure is increased (arrows shown in green). This may
  include damage to lipids, inducing upregulation of the Kennedy Pathways, and proteins
  involved in other vital parasite functions, such as pyrimidine biosynthesis. To
  mitigate peroxide-induced cellular damage, the parasite engages a stress response
  involving translational regulation and the ubiquitin-proteasome systems. Asp, aspartic
