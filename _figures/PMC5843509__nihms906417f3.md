caption: Light intensity controls AII amacrine cell coupling via two independent pathways.
  Glutamatergic activity close to electrical synapses, including that of presynaptic
  rod bipolar cells and likely nearby cone bipolar cells, activate dedicated non-synaptic
  NMDA receptors associated with the gap junctions via glutamate spillover. This initiates
  a calcium signaling cascade that activates CaM Kinase II and phosphorylates Cx36
  to increase coupling. Direct synaptic activation of AII amacrine cells via the synaptic
  AMPA receptors facilitates this process by depolarizing AIIs and relieving Mg2+
  block of the NMDA receptors. This pathway can be supported by dim light that activates
  the rod pathway. At high light intensities, dopamine secretion from dopaminergic
  amacrine cells activates D1 receptors on AIIs, initiating a cAMP signaling cascade
  that activates PKA and, in turn, Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This results in
  net dephosphorylation of Cx36 and reduction in coupling. The widely separated light
  intensity thresholds of the two independent pathways leads to a distinct biphasic
  plasticity curve.
