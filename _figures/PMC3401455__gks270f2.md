caption: Rad51 filament formation and regulation. RPA can be replaced by Rad51 from
  ssDNA with the help of recombination mediators, including Rad52 and Rad55/57. These
  proteins can promote both the formation and stability of Rad51 presynaptic filaments
  and they themselves also bind DNA during this process (not drawn here for simplicity).
  Rad51 presynaptic filaments perform homology search with help from Rad54 and Rhd54.
  Mph1 can promote the SDSA pathway by unwinding D-loop intermediates. Srs2 is capable
  of dismantling Rad51 filaments in an ATP-dependent manner, leading to the displacement
  of Rad51 by RPA. This prevents untimely or unwanted recombination. However, Rad52
  and Rad55/57 can antagonize Srs2 activity. The Shu complex promotes Rad51 function
  during replication-associated repair but may also function by antagonizing Srs2.
  RPA–ssDNA complex can also lead to Rad51-independent repair wherein Rad52 and Rad59
  replace RPA from DNA and anneal complementary strands. The balancing act of proteins
  with antagonistic roles as depicted here determines the fate of Rad51 nucleofilaments
  and the recombination outcome. Most proteins regulating Rad51 are modified by phosphorylation
  (P) and/or SUMOylation (S). The modifications are depicted on one form of the protein
  for simplicity; future work is needed to determine when the modification takes place.
  These modifications can dynamically change in response to DNA damaging agents and
  regulate the functions of the target proteins.
