caption: 'The succinate dehydrogenase complex (SDH), as a member of the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA), catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. In this reaction,
  two hydrogen atoms are removed from succinate by flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD).
  These electrons from the reduced SDH-FADH2 complex are then transferred to ubiquinol-ubiquinone
  (coenzyme Q), a soluble component of the electron transport system of complex II.
  In the Q cycle, the sequential oxidation and reduction of the lipophilic electron
  carrier, coenzyme Q, generates protons that are transferred to complex III, with
  the ultimate generation of ATP (complex V). Coenzyme Q, beside its function in the
  respiratory chain as an electron carrier mediating electron transfer between the
  various dehydrogenases and the cytochrome pathway, also works as a powerful antioxidant
  in biological membranes. Dysfunction of SDH inactivates the electron transport chain
  and the Krebs cycle. A lack or suboptimal level of SDH activity will not only cause
  decreased ATP production, but will also result in increased reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) with succinate accumulation. An increase in ROS, like the accumulation of
  succinate, leads to stabilization of HIF-α. HIF-α stabilization subsequently activates
  glycolysis, cell proliferation, cell migration, invasiveness, and angiogenesis and
  inhibits apoptosis. The overexpression of ROS triggers genomic instability, oncogene
  activation, and tumor suppressor inactivation.Abbreviations: e−- electron; FAD-
