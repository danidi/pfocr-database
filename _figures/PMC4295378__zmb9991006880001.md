caption: Overview of the WNT signaling network. WNT ligands signal via a number of
  intracellular pathways in a highly tissue context-dependent manner. In the “off”
  state, WNT signaling is inhibited (left of the broken line). Extracellularly, this
  occurs through secreted frizzled receptor-related protein (SFRP) sequestering of
  WNT ligands to inhibit both canonical (β-catenin-dependent) and noncanonical (β-catenin-independent)
  WNT signaling. Dickkopf (DKK) is an extracellular antagonist of the LRP5/6 receptor,
  which is specific to the canonical WNT pathway. For the canonical pathway, in the
  absence of a WNT ligand, β-catenin levels in the cell are kept low (except at adherens
  junctions, where β-catenin exists in a cadherin-bound pool at the cell membrane)
  by a multiprotein destruction complex. The destruction complex binds and phosphorylates
  β-catenin, targeting it for polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation.
  In the presence of WNT ligands, the signaling network becomes activated (right of
  the broken line). In the canonical WNT pathway, WNT ligands bind to the FZD receptors
  (large seven-transmembrane domain receptors; blue/brown in schematic) and LRP5/6
  coreceptors to activate DVL. DVL inactivates the destruction complex, which in reality
  occurs through recruitment of the scaffold protein axin to the cytoplasmic tail
  of LRP5/6, preventing β-catenin degradation. Following inactivation of the destruction
  complex, cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin rise and the protein is eventually translocated
  to the nucleus, where it associates with TCF/LEF transcription factors to control
  the expression of WNT target genes such as the c-Myc gene. Noncanonical WNT signaling
  consists of two main pathways, the WNT/Ca2+ and WNT/PCP pathways. Both of these
  pathways involve WNT ligand binding of FZD receptors (also involving coreceptors;
  not shown) and subsequent activation of DVL. In the WNT/Ca2+pathway, intracellular
  Ca2+ levels increase following WNT-induced activation of phospholipase C, resulting
  in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-3 (IP3) generation and subsequent Ca2+ release from
  intracellular stores. Increased Ca2+ levels result in activation of Ca2+-dependent
  enzymes and subsequent NFAT-mediated gene activation and inhibition of TCF gene
  transcription through activated NLK. The WNT/PCP pathway involves WNT-mediated activation
  of the small GTPase RhoA, which activates Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) to remodel
  the cytoskeleton and regulate cell movement and tissue polarity. Red arrows represent
  inhibition, green arrows represent activation, gray arrows represent translocation,
  and broken green arrows represent second-messenger signaling. See the text for additional
  details.
