caption: 14-3-3 negatively regulates Hippo pathway signaling. (A) In the canonical
  Hippo pathway, Lats generates a phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding site on
  YAP/TAZ under conditions of high cell density. The binding of 14-3-3 sequesters
  YAP/TAZ in the cytosol. NPHP4 can complete with YAP/TAZ for Lats binding, thus blocking
  Lats-mediated phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ and 14-3-3 binding. (B) In non-canonical
  Hippo signaling, α-catenin forms a complex with 14-3-3-bound YAP under high cell
  density, thus stabilizing the 14-3-3/YAP interaction. Under low cell density conditions,
  PP2A dephosphorylates the 14-3-3 docking site on YAP, resulting in its nuclear import.
