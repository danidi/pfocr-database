caption: Mast cells are highly reactive cells expressing a plethora of receptors with
  specificity toward many types of stimuli. Upon activation, mast cells can release
  pre-formed mediators stored in cytoplasmic granules, including proteases and vasoactive
  mediators, while cytokines and chemokines can be either pre-stored or de novo–synthesized.
  The most commonly studied pathway for mast cell activation includes the engagement
  of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI), and is dependent on the production of
  antigen-specific IgE antibodies by B lymphocytes, in response to interleukin-4 (IL-4)
  and IL-13 produced by T helper 2 (Th2) lymphocytes . Crosslinking of the FcεRI-bound
  IgE by antigens results in mast cell degranulation and cytokine production . Mast
  cells can also express surface receptors for IgG antibodies, namely FcγR, whose
  engagement can lead to both activating and inhibitory signals, depending on the
  specific receptor involved . A variety of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs),
  including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), are also expressed on the mast cell surface.
  For example, TLR2 is activated by bacterial lipopeptides, while TLR4 is activated
  by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding. Notably, TLR-mediated activation does not usually
  lead to mast cell degranulation, but triggers the production of de novo–synthetized
  mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. Mast cells also express receptors for
  chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors, essential not only for their maturation
  and differentiation but also to modulate their responses. For example, the KIT receptor
  binds the stem cell factor (SCF), important for mast cell proliferation and maturation
  . The MRGPRX2 receptor is activated by a range of ligands, including inflammatory
  peptides and drugs associated with allergic reactions . Finally, complement receptor-mediated
  activation of mast cells can be induced by different complement components, such
  as C3a or C5a . Transcription factors such as PU.1, MITF, GATA and C/EBP family
  members have critical roles in regulating mast cell development and in the maintenance
  of cell identity , while transcription factors such as NF-κB, NFAT and AP-1 are
  predominantly involved in the acute regulation of inflammatory genes .
