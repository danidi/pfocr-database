caption: Role of Scratch2 in neuron survival during development. (a) In the wild-type
  embryo, Scratch2 maintains puma transcription repressed, allowing neuronal differentiation
  and survival. (b) Scratch2 downregulation de-represses puma, permitting p53 binding
  to its response element in the intron and resulting in neuronal cell death. Apoptosis
  mediated by the intrinsic pathway in these cells induces the extrinsic apoptotic
  program in the neighboring cells. Dying cells induce progenitor cells in the ventricular
  zone to increase proliferation in an attempt to compensate for cell loss. (c) On
  DNA damage, p53 induces the transcription of several target genes, including mdm2,
  puma and scratch2. p53 protein levels are controlled by degradation induced by Mdm2.
  Cells expressing high levels of Scratch2 can interfere with the p53 apoptotic program
  through the repression of puma, leading to cell survival. A long-lasting or strong
  damage induces apoptosis as the final outcome of persistent p53 activity
