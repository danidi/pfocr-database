caption: Overview of the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen. The steps common to the
  human nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway are highlighted with thicker lines and bold characters.
  The catalytic centers (d1 heme and copper T2 center) of the enzymes responsible
  for the nitrite reduction to NO in those steps are also presented. Denitrification
  (a "respiratory" pathway), blue arrows; anaerobic ammonium oxidation (AnAmmOx; "respiratory"
  pathway), grey arrows; "denitrification/intra-aerobic methane oxidation" ("respiratory"
  pathway that links the nitrogen and carbon cycles), violet arrows; dinitrogen fixation
  (nitrogen assimilatory pathway), yellow arrow; assimilatory ammonification (nitrogen
  assimilatory pathway), orange arrows; "organic nitrogen pool", pink arrows; dissimilatory
  nitrate reduction to ammonium ("respiratory" pathway), green arrows; nitrification
  and complete ammonium oxidation (ComAmmOx) ("respiratory" pathways), black arrows.
