caption: VPS13A is a peripheral membrane protein likely to follow the secretory pathway
  via Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane (PM). VPS13A may
  be endocytosed thus coating and/or tethering early or recycling endosomes (EE/RE).
  It may then translocate to multivesicular bodies (MVB), late endosomes (LE) and
  lysosomes (Ly), respectively. Alternatively, it may take the direct route from TGN
  to MVB that is regulated by ESCRT proteins or in the retrograde direction regulated
  by GARP proteins. Lack of VPS13A may impair the function of the MVB/LE/Ly compartment
  and the associated autophagic flux via phagophores (Php), autophagosomes (APh) and
  autolysosomes (ALy), thus leading to lysosomal storage disease-like conditions.
  Likewise, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) will be impaired, which leads to inefficient
  elimination of toxic protein aggregates. Moreover, inefficient mitophagy of reactive
  oxygen radical (ROS)-damaged mitochondria (MT) will lead to cell death. In ChAc
  erythrocytes, the Src-family kinase Lyn is overactive thus leading to aberrant PM-cytoskeleton
  association, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K/VPS34) activity is low.
  Downstream signaling via Rac1 and PAK1 leads to depolymerization of cortical actin
  filaments thus explaining the red cell shape change. Low PI3K activity reduces phosphorylation
  of Proteinkinase B (PKB/AKT) and Bcl2-Antagonist of cell Death (BAD) thus inducing
  Bcl2-dependent apoptosis. AKT is an activator of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin
  (mTOR), which is a key regulator of autophagy. The XK protein is an integral membrane
  protein at the PM of erythroid cells and perinuclear endosomes in neurons. It is
  hypothesized to be involved in the maintenance of phospholipid asymmetry, particularly
  of phosphatidylserine (PS). PS plays an important role in apoptotic signaling, endocytic
  sorting and recycling, retrograde membrane traffic, and may play a role in the synthesis
  of sphingolipids. Due to the similarity of XK with CED8, it is hypothesized that
  XK may be involved in cytochrome c (Cyt c)-induced caspase activation downstream
  of CED3. VPS13A pathways are highlighted in blue, while XK pathways are marked in
  red.
