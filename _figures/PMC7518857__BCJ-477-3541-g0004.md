caption: (A) In the absence of Hedgehog ligand, (i) its receptor PTCH localises to
  the primary cilium and represses the pathway by (ii) sequestering the GPCR-like
  protein SMO out of the cilium. (iii) The GLI transcription factors are sequestered
  in the cytoplasm. (iv) The GPCR GPR161 localises to cilia and supports the processing
  of GLI to the proteolytically processed transcriptional repressor. (v) GLI repressors
  translocate to the nucleus to inhibit target gene expression. (B) (i) Hedgehog ligand
  binding to PTCH1 results in PTCH1 movement out of the cilium and (ii) de-repression
  of SMO, which now accumulates in the ciliary membrane. SMO may also be directly
  activated by the small molecule ligand SAG. (iii) These events result in exit of
  GPR161 from the cilia and (iv) GLI accumulation at the cilia tip where it becomes
  activated. (v) Active GLI then translocates to the nucleus to promote Hedgehog target
  gene expression.
