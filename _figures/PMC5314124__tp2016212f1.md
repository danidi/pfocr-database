caption: Main branches of the kynurenine pathway. The enzyme indoleamine 2,3 deoxygenase
  (IDO), which converts tryptophan to kynurenine is upregulated by pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Each box represents a metabolite resulting from the oxidation of tryptophan.
  The black italicized text shows the enzymes that catalyze select steps in the metabolic
  pathway. NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate.
