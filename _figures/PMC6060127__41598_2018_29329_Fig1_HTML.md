caption: Overview of analytical meta-analysis approach to understand the molecular
  mechanism of ZIKV Infection. The comparative analysis of transcriptome alterations
  due to ZIKV infection in different cell types were performed to identify a meta-signature
  of ZIKV infection (left top). Furthermore, to identify the core set of genes unique
  to ZIKV infection, we also performed a comparative analysis of the ZIKV transcriptome
  with transcriptomes of DENV, WNV, and JEV (right middle). The genes only in the
  ZIKV extended set and not the other transcriptome comprise the ZIKV-core signature
  (middle right). Both the ZIKV extended and core-signature genes were evaluated by
  regulatory pathway and gene ontology analysis (bottom).
