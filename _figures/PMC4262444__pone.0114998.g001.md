caption: The pathway consists of a cascade of regulatory interactions driving sexual
  fate. Essentially, fem-1, -2 and -3 together with fog-1 and fog-3 promote spermatogenesis.
  To allow hermaphrodite animals to switch to oocyte production at the late L4 stage,
  tra-2 is repressed by the action of FOG-2 and GLD-1. fem-3 is repressed at the level
  of mRNA by multiple factors. Thus, regulation of the balance of TRA-2 and FEM-3
  levels allows the timely transition from sperm to oocyte production, in order to
  generate fully fertile hermaphrodites. Factors that promote male and female fates
  are highlighted in blue and red, respectively. Adapted from Kimble and Crittenden  and
  Rybarska et al. .
