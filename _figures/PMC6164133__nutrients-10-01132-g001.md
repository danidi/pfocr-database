caption: Intracellular signalling pathways of vitamin A. (A) Nuclear receptor signalling
  pathway. In blood, hydrophobic retinol (ROH) is bound by retinol-binding protein
  (RBP4) and transthyretin (TTR) and retinoic acid (RA) is bound to albumin. They
  enter the cell through membrane diffusion or ROH via the membrane transporter stimulated
  by RA (STRA6). Inside the cell, ROH is found in cytosol bound to cellular retinol
  binding protein (CRBP), metabolized into retinaldehyde (RAL), which is irreversibly
  converted into RA. Intracellular RA is transported by cellular retinoic acid binding
  proteins (CRABP) or fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) and it can be degraded
  by CYP26 or translocated to the nucleus, where it binds and activates nuclear receptors.
  If transported by CRABP it binds nuclear retinoid acid receptors (RARs), whilst
  in association to FABP5 it binds peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor β/δ
  (PPARβ/δ), activating the transcription of specific target genes; (B) RA extranuclear
  effects. In response to RA, a subpopulation of RARα and RARγ present in membrane
  lipid rafts activates kinase cascades. In neuronal cells, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) phosphorylation is mediated through RARγ in association with sarcome
  (Src) kinase, whereas in other cellular subtypes RARα is the effector of the transduction
  cascade through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) or ERK signalling.
  Activated p38MAPK and Erks translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate several
  targets, being mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK1) a good candidate.
  Plasma ROH, bound to RBP4, binds to the cell receptor STRA6 which phosphorylates
  and activates Janus kinases2/signal transducers and activators of transcription
  5 (JAK2/STAT5) signalling pathway. This phosphorylated STAT5 translocates into the
  nucleus where it regulates gene expression of target genes.
