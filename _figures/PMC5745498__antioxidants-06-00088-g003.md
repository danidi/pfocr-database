caption: Polyphenols modulate the HER2 pathway. The HER2 membrane receptor, when activated,
  dimerizes with other HER2 (homodimerization) or other HER family receptor (heterodimerization)
  and transduces proliferation signals to downstream pathways such as the Ras/Raf
  or PI3K/Akt routes. This activation also inhibits apoptotic signals and promote
  antiapoptotic mechanisms. In addition, HER2 expression can be modulated by FASN,
  and some polyphenols are able to modify this action by actuating on FASN activity
  and/or expression. Finally, Hsp90 chaperone is required for HER2 to be functional,
  and some polyphenols modify this interaction leading to HER2 degradation by proteasome.
