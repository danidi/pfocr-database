caption: Signaling circuit driving transformation and tumorigenesis. After Src activation,
  NF-κB is activated and IL6 is produced []. STAT3, a DNA-binding transcriptional
  activator that is phosphorylated in response to IL6, is an important mediator of
  cellular transformation. IL6 activates NF-κB and activation of NF-κB increases IL6
  expression, resulting in a positive feedback loop. In addition to cell transformation,
  the activation of IL6 expression is important for induction and maintenance of cancer
  stem cells. IL6 regulates negatively the micro RNA family miR-200 and positively
  the Notch-3 transduction pathway. Both, downregulation of miR-200 and activation
  of Notch are important for induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
  for induction and maintenance of cancer stem cells.
