caption: Schematic model of 14-3-3ζ mediated lung vascular integrity regulation and
  respiratory distress mediated neonatal lethality. On C57Bl/6J background, 14-3-3ζ
  is critical for the activation of multiple signaling pathways including the Raf/Mek/Erk
  pathway, facilitating the Ets2 mediated transcription of the pro-angiogenic miR-126,
  which promotes lung vascular integrity (left). In the absence of 14-3-3ζ, the Raf/Mek/Erk/Ets2
  pathway, along with other signaling pathways, is inhibited and miR-126 expression
  is attenuated, resulting in defects in lung vascular integrity that leads to neonatal
  lethality (right)
