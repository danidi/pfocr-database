caption: LT expression by RORγt+ ILCs is necessary for IL-22 production following
  invasion of mucosal bacterial pathogen. LT signaling by RORγt+ ILC promotes the
  development of lymphoid follicles in the gut. Lymphoid follicles provide necessary
  microenvironment for interaction between innate RORγt+ cells and DC. Interplay between
  RORγt+ ILCs and DCs promotes IL-23 production by DCs that, in turn, activates IL-22
  synthesis by RORγt+ cells as a positive feedback loop. IL-22 stimulates IL-22R on
  epithelial cells which triggers production of antimicrobial proteins RegIIIγ and
  RegIIIβ to eliminate mucosal bacterial pathogen.
