caption: 'Original figure representing how the rising oxidative stress and accumulation
  of ROS or the presence of bioactivators molecules triggers the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling
  pathway. Under homeostatic conditions, Nfr2 is bound to Keap1 through the DLG and
  EGTE motifs in the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 by means of the ubiquitin ligase complex
  Cullin (Cul)3-RING-box protein (Rbx)1 (Cul3). Nrf2 is ubiquitinized due to its rapid
  proteosomal degradation. The electrophilic molecules produce the oxidation of the
  cysteine residues in Keap1, favoring its conformational change; consequently, ubiquitination
  is impaired and Nrf2 dissociates itself from the inhibitor complex. Nrf2 accumulates
  and is maintained transcriptionally active as it proceeds into the nucleus. It futher
  heterodimerizes with small musculo-aponeurotic fibrosarcoma proteins (sMaf), bonding
  in a specific DNA sequence denominated the antioxidant response element (ARE), inducing
  the expression of cytoprotector genes to increase cellular defense: the elimination
  of ROS; the gluthathione (GSH), and NADPH synthesis, and the expression of phase-II
  detoxifyng enzymes.'
