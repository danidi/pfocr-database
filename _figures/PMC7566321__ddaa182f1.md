caption: Schematic representation of the various analyses performed in the study.
  Consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis (cWGCNA) with datasets from
  three different studies—Mayo Clinic Brain Bank (Mayo) temporal cortex (TC); Religious
  Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) prefrontal cortex (PFC); Mount
  Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) para-hippocampal gyrus (PHG), inferior frontal gyrus
  (IFG), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and frontal pole (FP)—identified Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD)-associated modules. Distinct cell-types were detected using single-nuclei
  RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) from postmortem human brain tissue revealing cell-type
  proportion changes in AD. Disease-associated modules and cell-type clusters were
  used for functional pathway analysis in addition to GWAS enrichment, transcription
  factor binding site enrichment and validation in published datasets.
