caption: Photoreceptor metabolism cycles between an anaerobic light cycle and an aerobic
  dark cycle associated with phototransduction through PDE6 activities and mediated
  by SIRT6 and HIFlα. In the dark cycle, photoreceptor metabolism is similar to neurons.
  Glucose is metabolized via oxidative phosphorylation, generating NADH/NADPH, ATP
  to fuel the CNG channels for continuous depolarization to activate secondary neurons,
  and also producing ROS. SIRT6 acts as the driver of aerobic respiration; SIRT6 inhibits
  HIFlα to prevent transcription of glycolysis enzymes including PDK and PFK-1 and
  to promote oxidative phosphorylation. In the light cycle, photoreceptor metabolism
  is similar to that of cancer cells in the Warburg effect. Glucose undergoes glycolysis
  to form pyruvate and lactic acid, and glucose also enters the pentose phosphate
  pathway, generating several molecules of NADPH. NADPH is used for anabolic production
  of fatty acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and 11-cis retinal. Light activates the
  phototransduction pathway through high PDE6, and energy consumption is 4 times less
  than in the dark cycle. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
