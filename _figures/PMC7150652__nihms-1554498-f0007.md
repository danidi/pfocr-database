caption: (A) Represents the canonical pathway for pyochelin production with the role
  iron-bound PQS plays in indirectly (dashed-line) activating pyochelin production.
  (B) However, TLCA treatment of the WT or ΔpqsH, and Δphz mutants leads to an increase
  in pyochelin production and subsequently virulence supporting that these genes play
  a role in the observed increase in pyochelin production from TLCA exposure.
