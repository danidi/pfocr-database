caption: 'Endotoxin binding: Schematic overview of the LPS, LBP, CD14 and TLR-4 signal
  transduction pathway. LBP conveys LPS to membrane-bound or soluble CD14, which is
  surface-anchored by GPI (Glycosylphosphatidylinositol) of host cells. LPS then comes
  into contact both with TLR4 and with MD-2, a small protein associated with the TLR-4
  ectodomain. MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene) and the IL-1-receptor-associated
  kinase (IRAK) are recruited and induce activation of the transcription factor nuclear
  factor kappa B (NFκB), which leads to downstream gene transcription and production
  of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6.'
