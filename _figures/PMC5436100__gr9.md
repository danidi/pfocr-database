caption: Mechanisms of H2O2signaling. In the direct signaling pathway, H2O2 reacts
  directly with a redox switch. In the redox relay mechanism, the sensor of H2O2,
  a high-reactive protein such as a peroxiredoxin, relays the oxidation to a redox
  switch. The redox relay mechanism can be made more complex by the intervention of
  additional intermediates, as exemplified in the thioredoxin-peroxiredoxin model
  in which the protein responsible for the reduction of the redox sensor acts as a
  redox relay.
