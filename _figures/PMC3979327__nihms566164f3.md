caption: Graphical representation of the miR-196a pathway. Hoxc8 targets and represses
  C/EBPβ expression in cooperation with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) through a C/EBPβ
  3' regulatory sequence. Cold exposure and adrenergic stimulation lead to an increase
  in miR-196a expression, which directly suppresses Hoxc8 expression and thereby de-represses
  C/EBPβ expression. This leads to induction of beige adipogenesis exclusively in
  MYF5 negative progenitor cells.
