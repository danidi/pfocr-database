caption: Mechanisms of activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in adaptive versus maladaptive
  hypertrophy. In adaptive hypertrophy, binding of growth factors to their cognate
  receptors triggers translocation of the PI3K isoform p110α to the cell membrane,
  a process triggered by the interaction of the p85 subunit of PI3K with specific
  tyrosine phosphorylated residues in the growth factor receptor. p110α then phosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositols in the membrane at the 3′ position of the inositol ring. The
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of both Akt and its activator, PDK1, associate
  with the 3′ phosphorylated lipids, allowing PDK1 to activate Akt. Full activation
  of Akt requires phosphorylation by a second kinase, PDK2 (not shown), that may be
  the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Activation of Akt then leads to activation
  of mTOR, a central regulator of protein synthesis, via its effects on both ribosome
  biogenesis and activation of the protein translation machinery. Akt also phosphorylates
  and inhibits a kinase, GSK-3 (of which there are 2 isoforms, α and β). Since GSK-3
  inhibits a key component of the protein translation machinery, as well as a number
  of transcription factors believed to play roles in the induction of the hypertrophic
  program of gene expression, inhibition of GSK-3 promotes both protein synthesis
  and gene transcription. Maladaptive hypertrophy, triggered by neurohormonal mediators
  and biomechanical stress, also activates Akt, but the mechanism involves activation
  of heterotrimeric G-protein–coupled receptors coupled to the G-protein family Gq/G11.
  The PI3K isoform p110γ associates with the βγ subunits of Gq and phosphorylates
  membrane phosphatidylinositols, which leads to the recruitment of PDK1 and Akt.
  Maladaptive hypertrophy also recruits alternative pathways to activation of mTOR
  and Akt. Also shown is the phosphatase, PTEN, which, by dephosphorylating the 3′
  position of phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP3), shuts off signaling down
  the pathway.
