caption: Schematic representation of the VEGF-DLL4-Notch signaling pathway in angiogenic
  sprouts. Tip cells express vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)
  and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) together with several
  co-receptors, including neuropilin-1 (NRP1), to sense for vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) signals. Extracellular gradients of VEGF provide a template for tip
  cell attraction. Upon activation, tip cells express DLL4, which binds to Notch receptors
  on follower stalk cells. In stalk cells, Notch is cleaved by gamma-secretase, releasing
  the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which dampens the expression of VEGFR2 and
  VEGFR3, as well as increases VEGFR1 expression. sVEGFR1 is released by stalk cells
  and binds to VEGF molecules to block local VEGF signaling. Jagged1 is expressed
  by stalk cells and negatively regulates Notch activity in tip cells.
