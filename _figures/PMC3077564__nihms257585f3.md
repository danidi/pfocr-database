caption: Activation of glia and neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord after
  peripheral injury. (a) Microglia-neuron interactions. Upon activation, afferent
  nerve terminals release neurotransmitters, substance P, CGRP, glutamate (Glu), ATP
  and BDNF, as well as inflammatory mediators including IL-6 and CCL2 and the growth
  and differentiation factor neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), into the spinal cord. Three examples
  are shown. (1) Neuronal NRG-1 acts on microglial erbB2, leading to IL-1β release.
  (2) Microglial cathepsin S (catS) cleaves neuronal CX3CL1, which binds CX3CR1 and
  stimulates phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in microglia. This pathway may be inhibited
  by protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). (3) ATP binds P2X4 and induces BDNF
  release from microglia, which upon binding TrkB receptor induces a shift in the
  chloride anion gradient and GABAA receptor-mediated depolarization in dorsal horn
  neurons. (b) Astrocyte-neuron interactions. (1) Astrocytes release glutamate and
  D-serine, which bind extrasynaptic and synaptic NMDA receptors on neurons, respectively.
  (2) Injury-induced downregulation of astrocytic GLT-1 alters glutamate homeostasis
  in the synaptic cleft. (3) TNF-α activates the JNK1 pathway, which leads to release
  of CCL2 and alterations in NMDAR and AMPAR activity. (c) Cross-talk between nerve
  terminals, astrocytes and glia. (1) TLR priming and purinergic signaling increase
  IL-1β release by glia, which modulates NMDA receptor activity on postsynaptic neurons.
  TIMPs in astrocytes inhibit MMP-mediated cleavage of pro–IL-1β. (2) Microglial IL-18
  binds IL18R on astrocytes and induces NF-κB activity and upregulation of inflammatory
  cytokines. Dashed lines represent multiple intermediate signaling events.
