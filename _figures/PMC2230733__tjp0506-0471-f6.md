caption: Skin stimulation can excite 1–5 sensory RB neurons. These project (200 μm)
  into the spinal cord where their longitudinal axons synapse with up to 60 dlc interneurons
  (dlc INs) and 15 dl interneurons (dl INs). dlc interneurons are more closely spaced
  (mean, 23 μm) and project across the spinal cord (157 μm) where they can ascend
  or descend to synapse with the contralateral motoneuron (mn). dl interneurons are
  more widely spaced (mean, 43 μm) and project ventrally on the same side (78 μm)
  then ascend to synapse with the ipsilateral motoneuron. The position of the jth
  dlc interneuron and the kth dl interneuron were specified relative to the recorded
  motoneuron (either contralateral or ipsilateral). More details in text and  and
  .
