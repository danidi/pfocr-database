caption: 'Thiamine and purine biosynthesis in S. enterica. A schematic of thiamine
  synthesis is illustrated, with the gene products involved in purine biosynthesis
  shown near the relevant position in the pathway. The inset displays the fate of
  individual atoms in the synthesis of HMP-P from AIR on the basis of labeling studies
  (, –, ). Metabolic processes that impact ThiC activity in vivo are depicted. Stains
  lacking PurR are derepressed for all purine genes (not depicted). Abbreviations:
  AIR, 5-aminoimidazole ribotide; THZ-P, 4-methyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-thiazole HMP-P,
  4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate.'
