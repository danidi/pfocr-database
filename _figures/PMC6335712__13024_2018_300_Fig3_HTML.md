caption: 'Lysosome as the nutrient sensor and signaling hub of the cell. Emerging
  evidence indicates that the lysosome in addition to performing its digestive function
  also acts as a signaling hub for regulating cellular metabolism. In growing cells,
  signals from amino acids (e.g. arginine, leucine etc), within the lysosomal lumen
  are integrated upstream of the Rag and Rheb GTPases to promote recruitment of mTORC1
  on lysosomal membrane leading to its activation. Signals from other factors such
  as oxygen and growth factors are also integrated in this fashion by the AKT-TSC
  pathway. Upon activation, AKT relieves the TSC complex from inhibiting Rheb. The
  v-ATPase, Ragulator, Rag GTPases and SLC38A9 also participate in the complex process
  of mTORC1-translocation to the lysosomal membrane where it is activated. Disruption
  of one or more of these signaling inputs may impair mTORC1 signaling and its recruitment
  to the lysosomal membrane suppressing its kinase activity. It should be noted that
  in a nutrient replete state the mTORC1 activation stimulates cell proliferation
  (anabolic effect), whereas in nutrient depleted state mTORC1 is inactive allowing
  autophagic pathway to be active (catabolic effect). Most notably, inhibition of
  mTORC1 by rapamycin and its analogs has been reported to ameliorate pathology and
  increase lifespan. Abbreviations used: mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  1; AKT, Protein kinase B; TSC, Tuberous sclerosis complex; IGFR, Insulin-like growth
  factor receptor'
