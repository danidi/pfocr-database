caption: Figure 1. Sources of ATP production. Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate via
  the glycolytic pathway. Pyruvate (and free fatty acids) enter the mitochondria where
  they are converted to acetyl CoA. This enters the Krebs cycle that, via NADH and
  FADH2, donates electrons to Complexes I and II of the electron transport chain,
  respectively. The electrons pass down the chain to Complex III and thence to Complex
  IV, where oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor. Protons cross the mitochondrial
  membrane and, in so doing, create an electrochemical gradient to enable ATP synthase
  to generate ATP from ADP. The ATP is then transported to the cytosol to fuel energy-requiring
  cellular processes. A relatively small amount of ATP is also produced by glycolysis
  and the Krebs cycle.
