caption: Schematic of the classic model of motor loops between the cortex and the
  basal ganglia.Note the excitatory glutamatergic connections (red) and the inhibitory
  GABA-ergic neurons (blue). Direct and indirect connections are highlighted with
  dissociated dopamine receptor associations. The hyperdirect pathway between cortex
  and subthalamic nucleus (STN) is also shown. DBS treatment for PD involves implantation
  of electrodes into the STN, globus pallidus interna (GPi) or thalamus depending
  on the patient phenotype. D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are excited and inhibited
  by dopamine released from the substantia nigra pars compacta. GPe, globus pallidus
  externa. Adapted with permission [].
