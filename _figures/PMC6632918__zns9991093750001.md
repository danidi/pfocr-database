caption: BNP/NPR-A/PKG-I/BKCa channel signaling in small primary afferent neurons
  during nociceptive processing (). NPR-A activation by BNP increases intracellular
  cGMP levels, leading to the activation of PKG-I and subsequent phosphorylation of
  BKCa channels. Activation of this signaling pathway is restricted to peptidergic
  DRG neurons. It results in reduced transmission of noxious heat stimuli in the presence
  of extracellular glutamate that increases intracellular Ca2+. How BNP is released
  from primary afferent neurons remains to be elucidated.
