caption: Model of TM-mediated leukocyte adhesion via binding to Ley. Our results support
  a model in which TM interacts with Ley-conjugated adhesion molecules to initiate
  p38 MAPK signaling pathway within monocytes as they roll over the endothelial surface.
  This signal consequently activates β2 integrins, which are able to bind ICAM-1,
  leading to firm adhesion.
