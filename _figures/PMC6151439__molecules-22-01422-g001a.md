caption: 'The schematic REPRESENTATION of the dihydroartemisinic acid synthesis pathway
  from amorphadiene and the optimization workflow for the yeast whole-cell biocatalysis.
  The abbreviations for the metabolites were shown in parentheses. The enzyme names
  are as follows: CYP71AV1, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Artemisia annua; CPR,
  cytochrome P450 reductase from Artemisia annua; DBR2, artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13)
  reductase from Artemisia annua; STH, transhydrogenase from Escherichia coli; ADH1,
  artemisinic alcohol dehydrogenase from Artemisia annua; ALDH1, artemisinic aldehyde
  dehydrogenase from Artemisia annua.'
