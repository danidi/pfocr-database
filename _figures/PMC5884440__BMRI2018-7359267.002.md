caption: Signaling network promoting apoptosis and Ros production after discs damage.
  Damage causes the activation of different signals that lead to apoptosis and high
  levels of Ros accumulation in dying cells. The function of Duox leads to extracellular
  Ros production that is responsible for hemocyte recruitment and promotes the activation
  of different signaling pathways in surrounding cells. Hemocytes secrete Eiger, which
  activates JNK pathway in the adjacent cells. Apoptotic cells produce also different
  signals that influence surrounding cells.
