caption: Proposed model of apo-A4 mediated signaling pathway in kidney injury. (A)
  TNF-α mediates an increase in apo-A4 expression during inflammatory AKI. TNF-α activates
  apo-A4 expression via the TNFR2-NFκB pathway. (B) Continuous kidney damage caused
  by ischemic reperfusion injury promotes apo-A4 deposition in kidney cells.
