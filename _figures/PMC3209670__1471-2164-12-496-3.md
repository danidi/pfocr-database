caption: 'mTOR signaling pathway affected by pollen feeding or varroa parasitism.
  Genes from the Drosophila mTOR signaling pathway that were differentially transcribed
  after pollen feeding or varroa parasitism. The pathway was modified from KEGG: Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes http://www.kegg.com/. Grey indicates the presence
  of genes in the bee genome. Squares and circles indicate genes and enriched functions
  that were up- and downregulated between two treatments, respectively.'
