caption: The relation between macrophages and obesity or diabetes. After activation
  of IRF/STAT-1 by stimulation with IFN-γ and LPS, macrophages convert to inflammatory
  macrophages (M1 macrophages), which are characterized by production of NO from arginine
  through iNOS activity, enhanced glycolysis, PPP flux, fatty acid synthesis, and
  impaired OXPHOS and TCA cycle activities. Anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2 macrophages,
  activation of IRF/STAT-6 with IL-4 stimulation) produce polyamines from arginine
  by arginase-1 and ornithine decarboxylase 1 and are characterized by OXPHOS, FAO,
  and less glycolysis and PPP. In lean adipose tissue, macrophages have an M2 phenotype
  and have critical roles in clearing cellular debris and lipid buffering, whereas
  macrophages in obese adipose tissue are M1 macrophages, which are activated by cytokines
  in the microenvironment of adipose tissues of obese individuals (1) and, in turn
  exacerbate inflammation in adipose tissue and trigger insulin resistance, as well
  as promote the development of metabolic syndrome associated with obesity (2). The
  blue pathway indicates activity in an impaired situation. FAO, fatty acid oxidation;
  iNOS, inducible NO synthase; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; OXPHOS, oxidative
  phosphorylation; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
