caption: 'Schematic view of the anti-inflammatory roles of SLPI in obesity-related
  atherosclerosis pathway. In obesity-related chronic low-grade inflammatory status,
  SLPI may act as an anti-inflammation factor through several aspects: (1) inhibit
  the activation of NF- κB; (2) prevent endogenous IκBα degradation; (3) bind to the
  DNA of NF-κB regions within the IL-8 and TNF-α promoters, and prevent p65 interaction
  with the NF-κB consensus region; (4) may be interference with parallel pro-inflammatory
  signaling pathways to inhibit cytokine production. All of those consequently lower
  the production of pro-inflammatory adipokines and the expression of adhesion molecules,
  which are conformed to lead to atherosclerosis through varies pathways. (−): inhibit;
  (+): promote. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)'
