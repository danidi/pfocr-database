caption: 'Pro-oxidant effects of intravenously administered high-dose vitamin C. Intravenous
  administration (I.V.) of high-dose vitamin C (plasma ascorbate levels >1 mM) induces
  cytotoxic effects against cancer cells through different mechanisms of action. Ascorbate
  reacts with Fe3+ via Fenton reaction leading to the formation of Fe2+ that, by reacting
  with H2O2, produces highly damaging hydroxyl radicals. In the blood, H2O2 is eliminated
  by ROS scavenger systems [e.g., the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase] present
  on the erythrocyte membrane. In the extracellular matrix of the tumor microenvironment,
  hydroxyl radical accumulation can induce direct damage to cell membrane by lipid
  peroxidation; H2O2 can also enter into the cell by diffusion. Vitamin C enters into
  the cell by using different transporters: (1) via SVCT2 as ascorbate; (2) via GLUTs
  as DHA produced by ascorbate oxidation. Inside the cells, DHA is converted back
  to ascorbate decreasing GSH activity and NADPH. Tumor cells contain higher levels
  of labile iron (Fe2+) due to altered iron metabolism and high intracellular concentrations
  of ascorbate may favor the release of Fe2+ from ferritin. Tumors may also secrete
  in the extracellular matrix high amounts of ferritin from which Fe2+ can be released
  either directly by ascorbate or indirectly through the production of O2. ROS accumulation
  induces ATP depletion and causes cancer cell death as a consequence of DNA damage,
  GAPDH inhibition and NAD+ depletion, metabolism alteration due to glycolysis blockade,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) disruption and shift toward the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP).'
