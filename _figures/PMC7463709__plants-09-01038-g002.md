caption: Regulation of autophagy by plant hormones. Phytohormones can modulate autophagy
  at the transcriptional level and through protein regulations. In respect to the
  former, the transcription factors ethylene response factor 5 (ERF5) in ethylene
  pathway and brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1) in the brassinolide (BR) pathway directly
  bind to the corresponding ATG promoters and then activate gene expression to promote
  autophagy. In contrast, the auxin regulator auxin response factor (ARF) also likely
  binds to the AtATG8 promoter to repress its expression, eventually leading to attenuating
  autophagy activity. In addition, auxin also can repress autophagy by promoting target
  of rapamycin (TOR) activity. On another hand, abscisic acid (ABA) can promote the
  SnRK2 and TSPO to positively regulate autophagy. By contrast, gibberellin (GA) seems
  to antagonize ABA in regulating autophagy through inhibiting SnRK2 activity. Alternatively,
  GA may also directly modulate autophagy through an unknown component. Jasmonic acid
  (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) induce the expression of WRKY33, and then WRKY33 directly
  triggers the expression of ATG genes, consequently promoting autophagy. Solid lines
  represent the activation or repression with known evidence. Dashed lines represent
  the proposed activation or repression.
