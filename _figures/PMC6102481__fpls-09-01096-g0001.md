caption: Biosynthetic pathway of artemisinin starting from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP).
  1. Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) synthesizes the first committed product of
  the artemisinin pathway, AD. 2. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP71AV1 oxidizes
  AD to AA in three successive reactions (2, 3, and 8). CYP71AV1 is the main rate-limiting
  enzyme of the committed artemisinin pathway. Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) restores
  the active state of CYP71AV1. 3. AO can be produced by CYP71AV1/CRP enzymatic system,
  and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) can also make AO using AOH as a substrate. 4.
  AO is utilized by the enzyme artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13) reductase (DBR2), which
  generates DHAO, as well as the third reaction of CYP71AV1 (7), which generates AA.
  5. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) converts DHAO to DHAA. 6–7. The conversion of
  DHAA into ART through the intermediate DHAAHP is postulated to be non-enzymatic,
  but induced only by ultraviolet light and oxygen. 8. The third reaction of CYP71AV1
  converts AO into AA, diverting the pathway from producing ART and DHAA. 9. AA can
  be converted non-enzymatically into AB. 10. AB can be converted into AT. 11. DHAAHP
  may also generate DART. Once extracted from plants and purified, ART is derivatized
  into dihydroartemisinin (dART), then into other antimalarial drugs (e.g., artemether
  and artesunate), which the body metabolizes to the bioactive DART.
