caption: 'SOCS induction by and inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway. (1) Extracellular
  cytokines cause dimerization of their cognate transmembrane receptors. This brings
  intracellular receptor-associated JAK proteins into proximity to cross-phosphorylate
  each other and tyrosine residues on the receptors. (2) STAT proteins dock at phosphotyrosines
  on intracellular receptor subunits. (3) JAK proteins phosphorylate STAT proteins,
  activating them. (4) Activated STAT proteins undock from their receptors, dimerize,
  and translocate to the nucleus. (5) STAT proteins act as transcription factors for
  dozens of immune targets, including SOCS. (6) Functioning in the cytoplasm, SOCS
  proteins can bind various phosphotyrosines on intracellular receptors, blocking
  STATs from their native docking sites. (7) With their KIR domains, SOCS1 and SOCS3
  can inhibit the kinase activity of JAK proteins, preventing tyrosine phosphorylation
  of STAT proteins. (8) SOCS boxes facilitate ubiquitination of SOCS-bound protein
  targets for proteasomal degradation. Abbreviations: suppressor of cytokine signaling
  (SOCS), Janus kinase (JAK), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT),
  kinase inhibitory region (KIR). See Akhtar and Benveniste ().'
