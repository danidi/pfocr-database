caption: Transdifferentiation of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
  into the multiple skin component cells. The particular subset(s) of allogenically
  transferred MSCs, a PDGFRα +/c-kit−/Sca-1− lineage, can differentiate into the keratin-marker-positive
  epidermal keratinocytes via a paracrine action of HMGB1. In another cascade, the
  transdifferentiation activity of the MSCs into other skin components such as vasculature
  (endothelial cells and pericytes) and dermal fibroblasts—albeit much lesser with
  monocytes, macrophages, and adipocytes—is accelerated by certain cytokine/chemokine
  signalling, especially CCR7-SLC/CCL21 pathway. These BM-derived multiple cell lineages
  can be a potential source for supplying skin structural molecules, such as type
  VII collagen (COLVII) and type XVII collagen (BPAGII; BP180), both of which are
  essential anchoring molecules in the basement membrane zone (BMZ).
