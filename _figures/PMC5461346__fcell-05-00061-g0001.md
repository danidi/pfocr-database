caption: Schematic indicating processes affecting cell size and growth downstream
  of mammalian TORC complexes. Black arrows indicate well-established relationships
  between TORC1 and TORC2 with temporal and spatial aspects of cell growth, respectively.
  Red arrows indicate new functional connections while double red arrows indicate
  a cross-regulation between TORC1 and cytoskeleton as well as TORC2 and ribosomes.
