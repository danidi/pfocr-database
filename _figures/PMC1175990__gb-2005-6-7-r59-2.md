caption: Relationship of the 13 differentially regulated pathways identified by GSEA.
  Nine pathways were related via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and three other
  pathways are linked through cholesterol metabolism. These pathways contain a total
  of 170 genes, some of which are present in multiple pathways.
