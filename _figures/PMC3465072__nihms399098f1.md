caption: '(A) Experimental approach: HepG2 cells were pretreated with four different
  inhibitors and subsequently stimulated with four different ligands. For each combination
  of inhibitor and ligand, the phosphorylation activity of seven proteins or groups
  of protein isoforms was measured. (B) PKN pathway map (derived from the Ingenuity
  database) summarizing the signaling pathway relevant to the DREAM4 phosphoproteomics
  challenge. Green, ligands used as stimuli; red, proteins that were inhibited with
  small-molecule inhibitors but the phosphorylation status of which was not measured;
  blue, proteins that were measured in all experiments but were not targeted by small
  molecule inhibitors; purple, proteins targeted by small molecule inhibitors and
  also for which phosphorylation status was measured; gray, proteins known to be part
  of the network but were neither measured nor targeted by small-molecule inhibitors
  in the data sets supplied for the challenge. (C) Summary of the compressed model
  networks with edges weighted according to the frequency of their appearance in the
  networks submitted by each team. Only ligands, measured phosphoproteins, and proteins
  targeted by small-molecule inhibitors are included. Black arrows correspond to compressed
  interactions from the figure in (B), in which an edge exists between two nodes if
  there is a path from the source to the target nodes in the PKN. The thicknesses
  of the black arrows correspond to the number of teams that used an interaction to
  account for the training set (the thickest edge was used by 12 teams, whereas the
  thinnest was used by just one team). The red arrows are the most frequently predicted
  interactions that were not present in the PKN. Both the left and right networks
  were created with Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/). The protein ERK1/2 represents
  both ERK1 and -2, and JNK represents JNK1, -2, and -3.'
