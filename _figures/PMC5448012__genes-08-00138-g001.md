caption: The simplified mesocorticolimbic pathway in the rodent brain. Solid black
  lines represent dopaminergic projection; dashed blue lines represent GABAergic projections
  and dotted red lines represent glutamatergic projections. Regions in green are implicated
  in the drug craving, blue in binge, and red in the withdrawal stages of the addiction
  cycle. PFC = prefrontal cortex; Hipp = hippocampus; CPu = caudate and putamen; NAc
  = nucleus accumbens; AMG = amygdala; VTA = ventral tegmental area.
