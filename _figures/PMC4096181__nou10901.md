caption: The hedgehog signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of hedgehog (Hh) ligands,
  the transmembrane receptor patched (PTCH) inhibits entry of the G-protein-coupled
  receptor-like transmembrane signal transducer smoothened (SMO). Glioma-associated
  oncogene (GLI) transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm in a complex
  containing the negative regulator suppressor of fused (SUFU). GLIs are processed
  into a transcriptional repressor form or degraded. (B) Hh signaling is activated
  when Hh binds to PTCH on the cell surface. Both molecules are then internalized
  (and PTCH is degraded), allowing SMO to activate downstream signaling events. The
  GLI transcription factors are released from SUFU and processed into their activating
  forms. Activated GLIs translocate into the nucleus and promote transcription of
  Hh pathway target genes.
