caption: IPA® analysis of signalling pathways of the genes differentially expressed
  upon lysozyme treatment. U937 cells were treated with lysozyme 15 μg/mL for 1 h
  and analysed immediately at the end of the treatment (1 h). Down-regulated genes
  by lysozyme treatment are marked in green, up-regulated genes are marked in red,
  orange colour indicates the prediction of an activation, blue colour the prediction
  of an inhibition; continuous line indicates direct relationships, dashed line indicates
  an indirect relationship (one or more intermediates), yellow colour indicates relationships
  non-consistent with the state of the down-stream molecule, grey colour indicates
  an unpredicted effect.
