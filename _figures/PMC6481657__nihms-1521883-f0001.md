caption: The SARM1 NADase is the central executioner of the axon degeneration pathway.
  Upon activation, SARM1 triggers NAD+ depletion, which elicits a metabolic crisis
  in the axon and subsequent axon degeneration. SARM1 activation is blocked in the
  presence of axonal NMNAT2, which is a labile protein that must be constantly delivered
  via fast axonal transport from the cell body. Neuronal injury and disease can interrupt
  delivery of NMNAT2 to the axon, allowing for SARM1 activation and induction of axon
  degeneration. The turnover of axonal NMNAT2 is promoted by the activity of the neuronal
  stress kinases DLK and LZK as well as the PHR1 ubiquitin ligase complex. There are
  a number of potential sites of therapeutic intervention in this pathway (red). These
  include inhibitors of the SARM1 NADase, dominant negative versions of SARM1 that
  block its activation, kinase inhibitors of DLK/LZK, and NAD+ precursors to help
  maintain NAD+ levels.
