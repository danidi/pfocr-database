caption: A proposed model for C. trachomatis secretion of effectors into host cell
  cytosol. When an infectious and metabolically inactive elementary body (EB) attaches
  to an epithelial cell, preexisting effectors such as TARP and CT694 can be injected
  into host cell cytosol via a single step type 3 secretion system (T3SS) for facilitating
  EB invasion. Once the internalized EB is differentiated into a non-infectious but
  metabolically active reticulate body (RB), newly synthesized chlamydial proteins
  can be secreted into host cell cytosol via either the single step T3SS (for example,
  secretion of CT847) or multi-step pathways. The C. trachomatis-secreted proteins
  (CtSPs) with an N-terminal signal sequence (termed Sec-CtSPs) such as cHtrA & CPAF
  may be translocated into periplasm via a SecY-dependent pathway while those without
  any N-terminal signal sequences (Nonsec-CtSPs) may be translocated into the periplasmic
  space via a novel translocon or a leaking T3SS pathway. The periplasmically localized
  CtSPs may exit the chlamydial organisms via an outer membrane vesicle (OMV) budding
  mechanism. The CtSP-laden vesicles in the inclusion lumen can enter host cell cytosol
  via vesicle fusion with or passing through the inclusion membrane. That's why CT621
  can be visualized in granules in the lumen of inclusion and its secretion can also
  be inhibited by C1, a small molecule inhibitor known to target bacterial T3SS.
