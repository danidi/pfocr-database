caption: Rap2B increases the intracellular calcium level, which subsequently phosphorylates
  the downstream target of ERK1/2, thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion in vitro. Together, it will support the novel notion that
  Rap2B promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via calcium-related
  ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
