caption: Collision of a replication fork, comprised of genomic DNA (dark blue) and
  newly synthesized DNA (green), with a LINE-1 insertion intermediate—an RNA:DNA hybrid
  made of LINE-1 mRNA (red) and LINE-1 cDNA (green). The LINE-1 insertion intermediate
  is recognized by the Fanconi Anemia pathway core complex and recruits and activates
  FANCD2 and FANCI, which are then monoubiquitinated. The stalled fork leads to an
  accumulation of RPA, which recruits ATR-ATRIP and the 9-1-1 (RAD9-HUS1-RAD1) complex,
  key replication stress signaling proteins. These coordinate the cell response to
  the replication stress, including phosphorylation of RPA. Failure to resolve this
  collision reduces cell fitness. A similar conflict could occur upstream of the lagging
  strand as well.
