caption: 'Sites of action of different classes of drugs that are either in clinical
  use (left hand side) or in development (right hand side).Notes: Drugs that inhibit
  resorption: BPs are internalized and inactivate resorbing osteoclasts, whilst calcitonin
  binds to a cell-surface receptor to inhibit osteoclast function. Denosumab prevents
  RANKL interacting with RANK, therefore potentially inhibiting both the differentiation
  of osteoclasts and the function of mature osteoclasts. Drugs that stimulate formation:
  Teriparatide, an analog of PTH, binds to the PTHR on osteoblasts and, following
  a transient increase in osteoclast activity, a coupled increase in osteoblast activity
  is observed. Anti-sclerostin antibodies prevent sclerostin binding to the LRP5/6
  coreceptor, thereby allowing Wnt ligands to activate the canonical signaling pathway
  in osteoblasts. Drugs that uncouple bone formation from resorption: Raloxifene interacts
  with intracellular ERα in osteoblasts and, via upregulation of OPG and downregulation
  of RANKL, inhibits osteoclasts. Raloxifene also has positive effects on osteoblast
  proliferation. Strontium ranelate (Sr2+) substitutes for Ca2+ in the bone and interacts
  with the CaSR on osteoblasts, upregulating OPG expression and downregulating RANKL
  expression to indirectly inhibit osteoclasts, whilst acting directly on the CaSR
  on osteoclasts themselves to induce apoptosis. The anabolic effect of strontium
  ranelate on osteoblasts is also mediated via the CaSR as well as potentially other,
  unidentified receptors. Cathepsin K inhibitors uncouple resorption from formation
  since the cross-talk between inactive osteoclasts and osteoblasts is maintained.Abbreviations:
