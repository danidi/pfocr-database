caption: 'The models show the molecular mechanisms responsible for relocalizing DSBs
  to sub-nuclear domains to continue repair, including the current understanding of
  the final destination of these movements, regulatory components of the SUMOylation
  pathway involved (black, bold), and repair outcomes (blue, italics). The potential
  role of SUMOylation/relocalization in genome stability is also shown (black, italics).
  Light blue circles indicate Rad51 recruitment and strand invasion. Question marks
  point to some of the questions highlighted in the main text. Whether SUMOylation
  contributes to the spatial and temporal regulation of rDNA repair in human cells
  is still unclear. GC: Gene conversion. BIR: Break-induced replication. MMEJ: Microhomology-mediated
  end joining.'
