caption: Exploiting synthetic lethal interactions for the treatment of human cancer.
  DNA damage signaling networks commonly show extensive rewiring incancercells.(A)Inp53andATM-proficient
  cancer cells primarily promotes apoptosis. Due to a functional proapoptotic ATM-Chk2-p53-
  Puma/Noxa signaling axis conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics should be recommended.
  (B) Loss of p53 in cancer cells largely abrogates DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
  in these cells ATM signaling is re-directed to induce a robust cell cycle arrest
  following genotoxic stress. ATM-mediated homologous recombination repair remains
  intact in p53-deficient cancer cells. Rewiring of DNA damage-induced ATM signaling
  promotes cellular survival in response to DNA damage. Treatment of p53-deficient
  tumors should include a combination of conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapy and
  ATM inhibitors. (C) Loss of ATM selectively reduces the induction of the pro-apoptotic
  p53 target genes Puma and Noxa following genotoxic stress. induction of the cell
  cycle-regulatory p53 target genes p21 and Gadd45α remains intact allowing ATM-depleted
  cancer cells to arrest the cell cycle after DNA damage. ATM-deficient cancer cells
  with retained p53 expression depend on the DNA-PKcs-mediated NHEJ pathway to repair
  chemotherapy-induced DSBs and maintain genomic stability. Abolishing DNA-PKcs signaling
  in these cells results in a dramatically increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapy.
  Treatment of ATM-deficient tumors with retained p53 expression should include a
  combination of conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapy and DNA-PKcs inhibitors. (D)
  The combined loss of ATM and p53 precludes the execution of functional cell cycle
  checkpoints in cancer cells that are exposed to DNA-damaging agents. This inability
  to halt progression through the cell cycle despite the presence of DNA damage ultimately
  results in mitotic catastrophe. p53 and ATM-deficient cancer cells should be exquisitely
  sensitive to treatment with conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapy.
