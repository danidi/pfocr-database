caption: 'Proposed mechanisms leading to the neurotoxicity in hyperhomocysteinemia
  (hHcy) + ischemia-reperfusion insult (IRI) conditions. HHcy followed by IRI induced
  neurotoxicity lead to the dysregulation in redox balance, lipoperoxidation and protein
  oxidation, secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase dysfunction and activation of MAPK
  p38 which was detected in the selective vulnerable cells followed by an increased
  FluoroJade-C and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling)
  cell positivity. These combined conditions were associated with histone hyperacetylation,
  increased BBB permeability, astrocyte changes and cognitive decline as well. (↑):
  increased number of cells and/or activity; (↓): decreased number of cells and/or
  activity [,,,,,,,,].'
