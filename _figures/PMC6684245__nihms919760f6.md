caption: The N-tails of H2A and H3 coordinate base excision repair (BER) and postreplication
  repair (PRR) to mitigate the cytotoxic effects of BER intermediates, such as abasic
  sites. The N-tails of H2A and H3 are highlighted in the model to show their role
  in different branches of the DNA damage response to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS).
  The N-tails of H2A and H3 are important for coordinately regulating BER, by modulating
  expression of Mag1, and PRR. Stimulating the PRR pathway could help suppress the
  cytotoxic effects of BER intermediates, such as abasic sites, during DNA replication.
