caption: In addition to its numerous actions in the nucleus, SIRT1 also has some newly
  discovered cytosolic targets. SIRT1 deacetylates and activates LKB1, leading to
  increased AMPK activity and attenuating ischemic brain injury. SIRT1 activity can
  also inhibit enzyme activity. Deacetylation of PTEN by SIRT1 inhibits the phosphatase’s
  ability to bind and dephosphorylate PIP3, and results in unhindered activity of
  the neuroprotective PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Deacetylation of eNOS stimulates
  the production of NO, a potent vasodilator. Putatively, this improves cerebral perfusion
  following ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Finally, SIRT1 also deacetylates
  phosphorylated tau, facilitating its degradation and reducing neuronal death in
  models of Alzheimer’s disease.
