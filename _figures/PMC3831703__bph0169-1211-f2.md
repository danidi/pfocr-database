caption: 'A summary of the involvement of kynurenines in three groups of CNS cognitive
  disorders: (A) schizophrenia and related conditions such as autism spectrum disorders
  (SZ), (B) Huntington''s disease (HD) and (C) dementias such as HIV-Associated Neurocognitive
  Disorders (HAND), with probable relevance to conditions such as Alzheimer''s disease.
  The diagram also illustrates the influences of stress on the kynurenine pathway
  via the induction of glucocorticoid secretion which induces TDO in the liver, and
  infections which cause the induction of IDO in several subsets of leucocytes via
  the action of interferons. The activation of IDO or TDO can produce localized depletion
  of tryptophan from proliferating cells while increasing the concentrations of kynurenine
  and its metabolites in tissues. Some of these metabolites such as kynurenic acid
  and quinolinic acid are active primarily on neuronal function, while 3HK and 3HAA
  have their main effects on T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion.α7NRs, α7-nicotinic
  cholinoceptors; 3HAA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; 3HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine; DAm,
  dopamine; Glu, glutamate; Htt, huntingtin; IDO, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase; Kyn,
  kynurenine; Kyna, kynurenic acid; Quin, quinolinic acid; TDO, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase;
  Trp, tryptophan.'
