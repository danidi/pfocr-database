caption: The IL-12 and IL-23 heterodimers are each composed of a common p40 subunit
  and a unique p35 and p19 subunit, respectively. The nonselective IL-23 inhibitors,
  such as ustekinumab, bind to the p40 subunit on IL-12 and IL-23, thereby inhibiting
  both signalling pathways. The selective IL-23 inhibitors, as guselkumab, bind to
  the p19 subunit on IL-23 and inhibit only the IL-23-mediated signalling pathway,
  allowing the IL-12 axis to remain intact.
