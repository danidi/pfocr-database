caption: The GAAC pathway. (a) In the presence of amino acids, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor, eIF2, is mainly in the GTP-bound state as a result of stimulation
  by its GEF, eIF2B. GTP-bound eIF2 forms a TC with initiator Met-tRNA. TC along with
  the 40S ribosomal unit scans mRNA and recruits the 60S ribosomal unit to form the
  functional ribosome. The latter starts translating mRNA into protein once it encounters
  the start codon. This is also true for the GCN4 mRNA, but the ORF is preceded by
  multiple μORFs, which largely prevent the ribosomes from reaching the GCN4 ORF.
  Hence, under these conditions, production of the Gcn4 transcription factor is very
  limited. (b) Under amino acid starvation, the levels of uncharged tRNA increase,
  which activates the Gcn2 protein kinase. This enhances the level of phosphorylated
  eIF2, which as a result binds too tightly to eIF2B, preventing the stimulation of
  the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2. Hence, eIF2 is largely in the GDP-bound state
  and the level of TC drops, which causes a strong reduction in the level of general
  protein synthesis. However, paradoxically, the μORFs in front of the GCN4 ORF are
  now largely read through by the ribosomes because of the lack of TC to initiate
  translation. As a result, the ribosomes are now able to reach the main GCN4 ORF,
  causing its translation into Gcn4 protein. The enhanced level of the Gcn4 transcription
  factor stimulates the expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, resulting
  in a strong increase in the endogenous synthesis of amino acids when amino acids
  are absent in the medium.
