caption: Reverse electron transfer (RET) as a new ROS-based mitochondrial signaling
  pathway. The redox state of the CoQ pool determines electron leak and superoxide
  production and can be used by mitochondria as a signaling mechanism. Since RET is
  sensitive to changes in electron flow and membrane potential, it can be used to
  detect changes in energy supply and fine-tune cell metabolism. For example, an increase
  in the availability fatty acid alters the NADH:FADH2 ratio from 5:1 to 2:1 and in
  response levels of CI are reshuffled by ROS produced via RET (RET-ROS) (Guaras et
  al., ).
