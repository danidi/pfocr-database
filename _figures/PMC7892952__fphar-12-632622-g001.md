caption: 'Adenine-based purines are ubiquitous compounds present at intra- and intracellular
  levels in normal (i.e., astrocytes) and tumoral (i.e., GSCs) cells. Left panel:
  ATP is released by virtually all cell types, and is usually metabolized by ecto-enzymes
  into adenosine (ADO) that is regained by cells through selective transporters (carriers).
  Right panel: In tumors, including GBM, extracellular purine amount is increased
  in pericellular tumor fluid by cell membrane leakage and also by low metabolism
  of ATP by ecto-nucleotidases coupled to increased activity of the ectoenzyme (CD73)
  converting AMP into ADO. The interaction of extracellular ATP or ADO with specific
  receptors, the expression of which has been found increased in GSCs such as ADO/A3
  and/or ATP/P2X7 receptors, activates processes contributing to transform tumor cells
  in phenotypes more aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy. Additionally, GBMs
  frequently show homozygous deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP),
  an enzyme working in the purine/methionine salvage pathway to convert methylthioadenosine
  (MTA) formed during polyamine biosynthesis into adenine and methionine. MTAP loss
  favors GSC formation with increased aggressiveness () and is associated with poor
  clinical outcome of GBM patients (). In both panels, changes in the receptors expression
  or purine levels are highlighted by increasing or decreasing the character size
  and/or by using bold characters. AK, adenosine kinase; NTs, nucleotidases; SAH,
  S-adenosyl hydroxylase, converting MTA into adenosine.'
