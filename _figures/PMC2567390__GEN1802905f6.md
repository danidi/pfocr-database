caption: Model of proteasome activity in regulating the proliferation vs. meiotic
  entry decision. In this model, proliferative cells in the mitotic zone (green) have
  active GLP-1/Notch signaling. This signaling inhibits the activity of GLD-1 by limiting
  its expression in the distal end (), which allows for specific mRNAs to be translated
  and produce proteins necessary for proliferation (blue). As part of one model, an
  unknown factor (X) may also inhibit GLD-1 activity in a manner independent of GLP-1/Notch
  signaling (see discussion). As cells move proximally, GLP-1/Notch signaling is reduced
  due to the distance from the LAG-2 ligand expressed in the DTC (yellow), and cells
  enter meiotic prophase (red). The proteasome also degrades a core component(s) or
  positive regulator of GLP-1/Notch signaling, reducing the level of signaling further.
  Reduced GLP-1/Notch signaling allows GLD-1 to bind target mRNAs, preventing further
  production of proliferation proteins. The proteasome could interact with the GLD-1
  pathway by degrading a negative regulator of GLD-1 activity (factor X) and/or by
  degrading proliferation proteins that were translated while cells were still in
  mitosis, but persist as cells enter meiotic prophase. In either situation, proliferation
  protein levels are reduced, which allows cells to enter meiotic prophase (red).
  Dashed lines represent reduced activity.
