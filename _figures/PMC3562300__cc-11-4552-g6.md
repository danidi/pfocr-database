caption: Figure 6. Proposed simplified model showing the mechanisms through which
  p53 can either be involved in a pro- or anti-apoptotic response to cisplatin treatment
  in TC cells. Cisplatin-induced DNA damage activates p53, which, in turn, transcribes
  p21 and MDM2, and induces Fas membrane expression. Recently, we have identified
  the Fas pathway to be involved in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cisplatin-sensitive
  TC cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrated that high cytoplasmic p21 expression inhibits
  both Fas death receptor-mediated apoptosis and cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Here,
  we propose the following model. In TC cells hardly expressing p21, cisplatin-induced
  p53 activation results in enhanced Fas death receptor expression and Fas death receptor-mediated
  apoptosis. In addition, cisplatin-induced activation of p53 may also lead to enhanced
  intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis. Thus, p53 has a pro-apoptotic function. TC
  cells, resistant to cisplatin, express relatively high cytoplasmic p21 levels that
  are strongly dependent on p53 transcriptional activity and lower Oct4 and miR-106b
  family members. In these cells, cisplatin-induced p53 activation also results in
  enhanced Fas death receptor expression, although to a lesser extent. However, the
  relatively high cytoplasmic p21 expression levels are blocking both cisplatin-induced
  extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. In these cisplatin-resistant TC cells, p53 has
  an anti-apoptotic function as transcriptional activator of p21 and MDM2.
