caption: Unifying model of TGFβ signaling in breast epithelium. Implications for cancer
  treatment using TGFβ pathway antagonists. The model assumes the existence of a primitive
  multipotent stem cell population that is ER-negative, PR-negative, CD44+, CD24lo,
  ESA+, KRT5+, TGFbR2+ and possibly express mesenchymal markers. When these cells
  divide, they give rise either to phenotypically identical daughter stem cells or
  to precursors of differentiated progeny (luminal, basal, or myoepithelial). Luminal
  cells are epithelioid (ESA+, KRT8/18+, CDH1+), express ER and PR, are CD44-, CD24+,
  and the TGFBR2 gene is transcriptionally silent (TGFBR2-). The basal and myoepithelial
  progeny express basal cytokeratins (KRT5/6/14+) or myoepithelial markers (αSMA,
  p63), lack ESA (ESA-), and appear to be enriched for CD44+, CD24lo cells. Whether
  these cells do or do not continue to express TGFBR2 is unclear. One of the fundamental
  determinants of the proportions of these different subpopulations in normal or cancer
  tissue is the ratio of stem cell divisions that give rise to daughter stem cells
  versus differentiated progeny []. We propose that exposure to TGFβ leads to enrichment
  of the cell population with multipotent CD44+, CD24lo clonogenic/tumor initiating
  cells that express mesenchymal markers (EMT) [], while treatment with a TGFβ receptor
  kinase inhibitor leads to enrichment with CD44-, CD24+, TGFBR2- nonclonogenic differentiated
  luminal cells []. Thus, we would like to propose the idea that TGFβ signaling is
  a key determinant of the fate of stem cell progeny, and responsible for maintenance
  of the stem cell pool in the normal mammary gland. Moreover, this model suggests
  the hypothesis that the constitutive activation of TGFβ signaling associated with
  invasive and metastatic breast cancer might contribute to steadily enriching the
  cancer stem cell pool, thereby indirectly enhancing the potential for metastasis
  and poor patient survival. In this context, it is noteworthy that EMT of normal
  as well as malignant human mammary epithelial cells appears to be tightly associated
  with the stem cell state []. Superimposed on to these population dynamics at the
  tissue level is the role of systemic estrogens and progestins in regulating TGFβ
  signaling (see section “Extensive cross-talk between estrogen- and TGFβ signaling
  pathways”). The ER/PR-positive luminal cells respond to estrogen by producing growth
  factors and lowering TGFβ production. These conditions would favor the commitment
  of stem cell daughter cells to become more differentiated progenitor cells. Moreover,
  because the TGFBR2 gene is transcriptionally silenced in these luminal daughter
  cells, this would further favor their clonal expansion. Conversely, anti-estrogens
  induce TGFβ production, which, even if it inhibits the rate of stem cell proliferation,
  would favor their self-renewal over commitment to differentiation. Once cancer stem
  cells break through the barrier of TGFβ-mediated growth arrest, the presence of
  active TGFβ would select for continued expansion of the cancer stem cell pool, and,
  consequently, metastasis. This model predicts that treatment of basal-like cancers
  with TGFβ antagonists may have anti-tumor effects by converting the putative stem
  cell population into a luminal, non-proliferating (and, perhaps, non-metastatic),
  phenotype (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, MET). Conversely, these agents
  might antagonize the therapeutic effects of anti-estrogens in estrogen-dependent
  luminal cancers. However, once these cells become estrogen-independent because they
  escape from TGFβ-mediated growth arrest, our model provides a rationale for including
  TGFβ pathway antagonists in the treatment program. Each of these predictions is
  testable in model systems as well as in clinical trials
