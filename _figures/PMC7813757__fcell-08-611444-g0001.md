caption: The mechanism underlying the role of TLRs in tumor immunity. TLRs are expressed
  on different immune cells and cancer cells. The roles of immune cells in tumor immunity.
  As a class of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells (DCs) recognize tumor
  antigen and present the antigen to CD8+ T cells through the MHC class I pathway
  and CD4+ T cells through the MHC class II pathway. After activated by DCs, CD8+
  T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and CD4+ T cells differentiate
  into Th1 and Th2 cells. CTLs are recruited to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and
  recognize tumor cells through T cell receptor (TCR) and MHC class I-bound antigen,
  then kill them. Th1 cells secreting proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, TNF-α,
  and IFN-γ to promote immunity. Immune checkpoints—CTLA-4 and PD-1, can suppress
  T cell response. NK cells inhibit cancer by directly kill tumor cells and secreting
  several inflammatory factors. M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory and M2 Macrophages
  are anti-inflammatory. Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) are anti-inflammatory cells
  suppressing of CTLs, Th1 cells, macrophages, and NK cells. TLRs are expressed both
  on immune cells and gastric cancer cells. Different TLRs agonists act on different
  immune and cancer cells to affect tumor immunity—pro-tumor or anti-tumor. Th1 cells,
  T helper type 1 cells; Th2 cells, T helper type 2 cells; IL-2, interleukin-2; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor-α; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; CTLA-4, The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  antigen-4; PD-1, Programmed cell death protein 1; PD-L1, Programmed death ligand
