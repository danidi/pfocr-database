caption: Proposed metabolic grid for biosynthesis of the type A trichothecenes. The
  preferred T-2 toxin biosynthetic pathway (boldface arrows) has been previously established
  in F. sporotrichioides NRRL 3299 (, , , , ). Thin arrows, major alternative biosynthetic
  routes; dashed arrows, minor routes. Any one of the alternative routes can become
  the predominant route in response to limitations imposed by a variety of mechanisms,
  including mutations or other perturbations that alter substrate availability or
  inhibit the activity of one or more of the TRI enzymes. For example, the routes
  indicated by the thin arrows define the preferred alternative routes in response
  to single gene mutations that inactivate either Tri11 (), Tri13 (), or Tri7 ().
  MAS, monoacetoxyscirpenol.
