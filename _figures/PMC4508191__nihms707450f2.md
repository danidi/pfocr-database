caption: Targeting the multistepped pathways of IL-1β–mediated inflammation. The inflammasome
  is an intracellular protein complex that is activated by numerous pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This
  activation involves several hypothesized mechanisms, including potassium efflux
  secondary to ATP-gated channels, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and membrane perturbation.
  Activation of the inflammasome leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase 1,
  which cleaves pro–IL-1β to its mature active form, which is subsequently released
  from the cell. Once released, IL-1β binds to the IL-1 receptor, leading to downstream
  signaling and a cascade of inflammation involving other proinflammatory cytokines.
  Pro–IL-1β expression is driven by Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and autocrine
  IL-1 receptor activation. There are several points along this pathway that can be
  targeted to inhibit IL-1–mediated inflammation, including specific inflammasome
  triggers, common activation mechanisms, specific components of the inflammasome,
  inflammasome stability, caspase 1, IL-1β release, binding of IL-1β to the IL-1 receptor,
  IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling transduction, and downstream proinflammatory cytokines.
  ASC, apoptosis associated speck-like protein including a caspase 1 activation and
  recruitment domain (CARD); Cardinal, CARD inhibitor of NF-κB activation ligand;
  HSP90, heat shock protein 90; NF-κB, nuclear factor κ-light chain enhancer of activated
  B cells; SGT1, suppressor of G2 allele of skp1.
