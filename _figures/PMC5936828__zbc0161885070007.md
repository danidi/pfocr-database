caption: Proposed biosynthetic scheme for the galactofucosylation of high-mannose
  and paucimannosidic structures. MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF MS analyses of both permethylated
  and 2-AB–labeled N-glycans reveal the presence of multiple isomeric structures containing
  mono- and polygalactosylated core fucose structures. The presence of high mannose
  with such modifications suggests the occurrence of a GlcNAc-independent fucosylation
  pathway. The proposed biosynthetic scheme for the production of the above mentioned
  structures would involve core fucosylation reactions independent of β(1–2)-GlcNAc
  at the α(1–3)-Man arm and subsequent galactosylation (via GALT-1-1 or GALT-1-2 (*)
  whose functions are currently unknown) and trimming by mannosidase (represented
  by the dotted lines and the red box). An alternate biosynthetic scheme would involve
  GlcNAc-dependent biosynthesis where Man-5 to Man-2 are formed through the sequential
  action of FUT-8, hexosaminidase, mannosidase II, and GALT-1. This biosynthetic scheme
  was constructed using the data on molecular ions obtained through MALDI-TOF MS spectra
  of PNGase A–released N-glycans. The molecular ions indicated are singly charged
  monosodiated permethylated N-glycans. Gn, N-acetylglucosamine.
