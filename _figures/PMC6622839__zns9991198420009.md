caption: Model of VAMP3- and VAMP7-dependent surface transport. VAMP3 and VAMP7 control
  two distinct transport pathways of PLP. VAMP3 acts as R-SNARE mediating fusion of
  PLP-containing vesicles traveling from RE to the plasma membrane (1). Stx4 and SNAP23
  may serve as cognate target Q-SNARES for membrane fusion in this pathway. On endocytosis,
  PLP travels to LE/Lys (2). VAMP7 mediates fusion in exocytic trafficking of PLP
  from LE/Lys implicated in myelin formation (3). Stx3 and SNAP23 are putative target
  SNAREs of the VAMP7-dependent pathway. The mode of PLP trafficking is influenced
  by cAMP signaling. Elevated cAMP results in depletion of LE/Lys pools because of
  inhibition of endocytosis. Under these conditions, the VAMP3-dependent pathway is
  prevailing.
