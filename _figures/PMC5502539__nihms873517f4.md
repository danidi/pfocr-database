caption: Complement factors are targets for pharmacologic inhibition in retinal disease.
  Numerous therapeutic targets for complement pathway inhibition are investigated
  in preclinical and clinical investigations. Alexion engineered a whole IgG humanized
  antibody (eculizumab) against C5 which was tested in a phase II trial with negative
  results. Ophthotech developed a pegylated RNA aptamer (ARC1905/Zimura®) that also
  neutralizes C5 and is currently in a phase I trial for the combination treatment
  of polypoid choroidal vasculopathy. Potentia revived a previously described small-molecule
  inhibitor of C3, compstatin, which completed phase I trials for the treatment of
  wet AMD with no preliminary signature of efficacy. Genentech has advanced the anti-CFD
  antibody fragment, lampalizumab, to phase III trials for the treatment of geographic
  atrophy; 1-year results are anticipated in early 2016 for this important trial.
