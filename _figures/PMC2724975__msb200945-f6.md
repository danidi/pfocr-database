caption: 'Illustrating expansion results with ambiguity networks. Ambiguity networks
  for regulatory modules obtained in expansion of the yeast model using the first
  five (A) and six (B) experiments on the list proposed by M-TOPOL (i.e., A and B
  differ only by one additional sixth experiment from the list). The ambiguity network
  provides a detailed insight into the ambiguous modules. Each white-filled node represents
  a regulatory program matching one of the identified modules. It is labeled with
  its regulator, and has a boundary color-coded according to its regulation function.
  Unambiguous modules are presented only by their unique matching regulatory program,
  without indicating their size. Ambiguous modules are presented as gray-filled nodes,
  labeled with their size and connected by edges to all their matching regulatory
  program nodes. Exemplary modules (highlighted with dashed squares) are shown together
  with their predicted profile (colored vector above the square). Dashed red: an ambiguous
  module controlled by seven regulatory programs containing a large set of genes in
  A is replaced in B by two smaller ambiguous modules controlled by four and three
  regulatory programs, respectively. The two modules differ in the gene response to
  the additional sixth experiment. Matrices showing expression profiles of the target
  genes (rows) across the experiments (columns) are plotted next to the modules. Dashed
  blue: A large ambiguous module whose genes did not respond in any of the first five
  experiments (the corresponding predicted profile is filled with black in A). Using
  the sixth experiment, the large module is replaced by two smaller ones in B. One
  module contains genes that were downregulated in the sixth experiment, whereas another
  contains genes that were upregulated (can be seen in green versus red entries in
  the predicted profiles of the modules). A large group of genes, whose expression
  has not changed in the sixth experiment, does not match any profile and therefore
  is not contained in any regulatory module.'
