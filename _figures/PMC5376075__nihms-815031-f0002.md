caption: TLRs signaling pathway showed on TLR2 example. To be activated, TRL2 requires
  dimerization with TLR1 or TLR6. The signaling cascades via TIR domains are mediated
  by specific adaptor molecules including MyD88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM. Upon ligand
  binding to TLRs, the adaptor molecule MyD88 is recruited to the TLR complex as a
  dimer. Binding of MyD88 promotes association with IL- 1, IRAK-4, and IRAK-1. TRAF6
  is recruited to IRAK-1 and the IRAK-4/IRAK-1/TRAF6 complex dissociates from the
  receptor. It interacts with another complex consisting TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. TAK1
  is subsequently activated in the cytoplasm, leading to the activation of IKKs. IKK
  activation leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB and consequent release
  of NF-κB. Translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus activates inflammatory chemokines
  and cytokines. The MyD88-independent pathway induces NF- B and MAPKs with delayed
  kinetics. It is possible that product of this pathway will have different targets
  from those activated by MyD88 dependent pathway. For example it can induce dendritic
  cell maturation instead cytokine production []. This pathway induces a fast and
  transient activation of the Rho GTPases - Rac1 and Cdc42. Recruitment of active
  Rac1 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) to the TLR2 cytosolic domain allows
  activation of Akt kinase, activation and translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB
  into the cell nucleus and specific cytokines release.
