caption: An overview of the inhibition of the type I interferon (IFN) induction and
  signaling pathways by viral proteins of KSHV. Following KSHV infection of cells,
  specific TLRs are activated, initiating the recruitment of adaptor proteins like
  TRIF. TRIF mediates the subsequent recruitment and activation of virus-mediated
  kinases (TBK1 and IKKε), triggering the phosphorylation of IRF-3. Phosphorylated
  IRF-3 homodimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to the histone transacetylase
  complex (p300/CBP). The expression of IFN-β is turned on subsequent to the binding
  of the IRF-3-p300/CBP complex to specific IFN-β promoter sites. TBK1 and IKKε also
  phosphorylate IRF-7, which translocates to the nucleus subsequent to homodimerization,
  binding to specific IFN-α promoter sites and triggering its transcription. IRF-7
  can also heterodimerize with IRF-3, and this complex also translocates to the nucleus
  to activate the IFN-β promoter. The newly expressed IFN-α/β genes bind to the IFN-α
  receptor (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) in both paracrine and autocrine manners, resulting
  in the phosphorylation and activation of IFNAR-associated Janus kinases (Tyk2 and
  Jak1) and the downstream STAT1 and STAT2. Phosphorylated STATs recruit and associate
  with IRF-9, generating the ISGF3 complex. This complex translocates to the nucleus,
  binds to ISRE, inducing the activation of the antiviral effectors (ISGs, including
  MxA, OAS, PKR, IRF-7, and others). Recruitment of TRIF to the TLRs also activates
  the IKK complex group of enzymes (IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ) that mediate the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB, essential for IFN-β promoter activation. The different modalities
  of action of a plethora of KSHV viral proteins (indicated within wavy-outlined ovals)
  at different stages of the type I IFN induction and signaling pathways (as discussed
  in the review) are also illustrated here. Thus, the viral proteins interfering with
  the type I IFN induction pathway are (i) vGPCR, vIRF-1, and RTA, which interfere
  with the TLR signaling/activation pathways; (ii) ORF45, which interferes with IRF-7
  activation pathways, and RTA, also targeted against IRF-7; (iii) K8 (K-bZIP), ORF36,
  vIRF-1, vIRF-2, and LANA, which interfere with activation of the IFN-β promoter
  through multiple mechanisms; (iv) vIRF-3, which interferes with the transcriptional
  ability of IRF-7; and (v) KSHV-encoded and host cellular miRNAs, which also interfere
  with the type I IFN induction pathway. Among the KSHV proteins interfering with
  the type I IFN signaling pathways are (i) RIF, which inhibits phosphorylation of
  IFNAR-associated Janus kinases (Tyk2 and Jak1) and the downstream STATs, and (ii)
  vIRF-2, which interferes with activation of specific antiviral ISGs. Interestingly,
  vIRF-3 inhibits the activation of IKKβ, thus hindering the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB, a protein necessary for IFN-β activation.
