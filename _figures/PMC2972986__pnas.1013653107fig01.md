caption: Biological processes known to be stimulated in an AHR-dependent and/or AHR-independent
  manner by the tryptophan photoproduct FICZ. (A) FICZ acts as an agonist of AHR,
  thereby stimulating the canonical AHR-ARNT signaling pathway that leads to rapid
  and transient enhancement of the transcription of various sets of genes in different
  types of cells (, , , , , ). (B) In murine T cells stimulated by IL-27, FICZ promotes
  the binding of AHR to c-Maf and, consequently, expression of IL-10 and IL-21 ().
  (C) FICZ activates human LXRα and LXRβ with EC50 values similar to those of endogenous
  activators of these same receptors, such as oxysterols (). (D) FICZ activates L1-RTP,
  as described by Okudaira et al. (). (E) Human cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2,
  and CYP1B1 convert FICZ to ring-hydroxylated metabolites that are further metabolized
  via sulfoconjugation ().
