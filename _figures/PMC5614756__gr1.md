caption: DJ-1 activates ERK1/2 signaling pathway. (1) DJ-1, but not its C106S mutant,
  can bind directly to c-Raf and augment c-Raf phosphorylation at Ser-338, which can
  then activate MEK and ERK1/2 . (2) DJ-1, but not its L166P mutant, protects cells
  from oxidative injury by activating ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 . The over-expression of wild-type
  DJ-1 up-regulates ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 phosphorylation , while knock-down of DJ-1 down-regulates
  phosphorylated ERK1/2 . (3) Under oxidative conditions, DJ-1, but not its C106S
  mutant, sequesters the transcription factor p53 away from promoters, resulting in
  down-regulation of the ERK1/2 inhibitor, DUSP1 . (4) DJ-1 interacts directly with
  ERK1/2 and enhances the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2, where it can activate and
  phosphorylate the transcription factor Elk1, leading to increased transcription
  of superoxide dismutase (SOD) . (5) DJ-1 modulates dopamine (DA) homeostasis through
  activation of ERK1/2 and the resulting phosphorylation and activation of the transcription
  factor Nurr1, which regulates the transcription of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) , .
  (6) Oxidative stress induced by 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) may up-regulate DJ-1
  through activation of ERK1/2 , . Positive regulation is indicated by pointed green
  arrows, and negative regulation is indicated by blunted red arrows. Direct or known
  regulation is indicated by solid lines; indirect or unknown regulation is indicated
  by dotted lines. Black dashed arrows indicate translocation. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of this article).
