caption: As a modulator of signaling, endocytosis, transcription, translation and
  protein stability, the HSP may coordinately regulate nutrient sparing and salvage.
  Some of the key intracellular targets of O-GlcNAc modification are shown with respect
  to their role in nutrient uptake and salvage. OGT modifies numerous signaling cascades
  including those triggered by PI3K, MAPK, AMPK and mTOR (For details, see ). In addition,
  by interacting with adapters like the D. melanogaster protein Milton, OGT may modulate
  intracellular movement of mitochondria on microtubules. The mammalian Milton homolog
  GRIF-1 binds to OGT and may be involved in orchestrating directed organelle movement
  including the trafficking of neurosecretory vesicles, endosomes, lysosomes and autophagosomes.
  These processes are critical for nutrient acquisition and immunity. OGT overexpression
  alters the movement of GLUT4 rich endosomes to the plasma membrane in response to
  insulin, a hallmark of mammalian insulin resistance. O-GlcNAc may also play a role
  in the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism. For example, O-GlcNAc modifies
  many ribosomal proteins and is required for the formation of stress granules involved
  in mRNA triage. O-GlcNAc also regulates the proteasome by modifying the ATP-dependent
  rpt2 domain as described in the text, and may directly, or indirectly regulate autophagy.
  O-GlcNAc also modifies nuclear pores and transcription-complexes playing an essential
  role in transcriptional repression [].
