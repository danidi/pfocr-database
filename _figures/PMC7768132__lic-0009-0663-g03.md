caption: Regulatory mechanism of KRT19 expression in HCC. Expression of KRT19 is regulated
  at the transcriptional level by various external signals. HGF secreted from CAF
  activates the MET-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway and transcriptional factors JUN/FOSL1 and SP1
  which upregulate KRT19 transcription. EGF secreted from HCC cells also acts in an
  autocrine manner to upregulate KRT19 through the EGFR-JNK pathway and unknown TF.
  Laminins also play an important role in KRT19 regulation. Laminin-332 and laminin-111
  upregulate KRT19 through the mTORC complex and the integrin-FAK-SRC pathway, respectively.
  Epigenetic regulation of KRT19 is also important for KRT19 expression; the dense
  methylation of the KRT19 promoter decreases the expression of KRT19. HGF, hepatocyte
  growth factor; CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; EGF, epidermal growth factor;
  FAK, focal adhesion kinase; TF, transcription factor; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase;
  EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.
