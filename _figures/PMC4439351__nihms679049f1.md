caption: Innate immune responses are required for allo-ECDI-SP tolerance induction.
  The splenic marginal zone is the primary interface between the splenic non-lymphoid
  compartment and the lymphoid compartment. It is composed of B cells and macrophages
  important for capturing exogenous Ags and debris, which may be processed for subsequent
  presentation to T cells in T cell zones. For efficient tolerance, allo-ECDI-SP must
  be delivered () via i.v. administration. Once within the marginal sinus, the ECDI-SP
  rapidly degrade via apoptotic pathways (), with debris and cells recognized and
  rapidly taken up via scavenger receptors on MZMs and DCs either directly from the
  marginal zone sinus or via membrane transfer. The uptake of allo-ECDI-SP triggers
  the production and secretion of soluble mediators including IL-10 and TGF-β, which
  have multifarious functions including the regulation of costimulatory molecules,
  such as PD-L1, on APCs (). The immunoregulatory milieu provided by the MZM response
  to the apoptotic allo-ECDI-SP conditions DCs to present antigen to T cells in the
  context of low CD80/CD86 expression and increased PD-L1 expression, thereby favoring
  costimulation through the inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 (). T cells
  of the indirect allorecognition pathway recognizing cognate peptide/MHC ligands
  on host APCs undergo deletion in this context (), while T cells directly engaging
  peptide/MHC ligands on allo-ECDI-SP become anergic (). Regulatory T cells of the
  Foxp3+ lineage expand in the presence of TGF-β to inhibit further priming in the
  secondary lymphoid organs and effector responses in the transplanted tissue ().
