caption: The 319 significantly proteins (up- and down-regulated) that were found by
  Benjamini-Hochberg analysis for early stage cervical cancer were applied to the
  IPA analysis tool. The pathway analysis resulted in the finding of the network “Cardiac
  Arrythmia, Cardiovascular Disease, Organismal Injury and Abnormalities” containing
  29 out of the 319 significant proteins. The network itself consists of 35 proteins.
  The up-regulated proteins in early stage cervical cancer are marked red and those
  up-regulated in healthy epithelial cells are marked green. The intensity of the
  color (red or green) relates to fold-change. Interestingly, almost 50% (13 out of
  29) of proteins identified were down-regulated. The symbols shown in the network
  are explained at http://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis
