caption: A schematic diagram of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and clearance
  via the autophagic pathway. (A) Mtb, but not M. bovis BCG, has diverse strategies
  for evading host immune system. Phagosomes containing Mtb do not fuse with lysosomes
  and mature into the phagolysosomes by preventing phagolysosome biogenesis. The restricted
  fusion of phagosomes with lysosome is attributable to limited entrance of lysosomal
  hydrolases to Mtb, preventing acidification of phagosomes. Mtb, but not M. bovis
  BCG or heat-killed (HK)-Mycobacteria, can evade to the cytosol depending on the
  ESX-1 Type VII secretion system. (B) Diverse stimuli including toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), interferon (IFN)-γ, and antimycobacterial antibiotics induce activation
  of the autophagic pathway to eliminate Mtb. The activation of endosomal and plasma
  membrane TLRs is linked to the induction of xenophagy of phagocytosed Mtb. IFN-γ
  induces autophagy through a downstream effector, Irgm1, in human macrophages, which
  then results in autophagic clearance of Mtb. Antimycobacterial antibiotics activate
  autophagy, which depends on cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.
  (C) The activation of autophagy plays a critical role in the clearance of intracellular
  Mycobacteria through diverse signaling pathways. First, ubiquitinated proteins are
  internalized and delivered via vesicles to the late endosome. Cargo receptors, such
  as p62, recognize ubiquitinated proteins and bind to LC3, contributing to autophagy
  activation. The autophagic vacuoles which contain ubiquitinated proteins traffic
  to the late endosome. This process promotes activation of lysosomes and fusion of
  Mtb-containing phagosomes with the lysosomes. Second, cytosolic recognition of Mtb-DNA
  via the STING-dependent pathway promotes ubiquitination of Mtb, and delivery of
  bacteria to autophagosomes through the cargo receptors p62 and NDP52. Finally, various
  stimuli induce autophagic clearance.
