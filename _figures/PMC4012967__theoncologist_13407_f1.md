caption: 'The IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway. The endogenous inhibitors of the latter are shown
  including SOCS3 and PIAS. Knocking the SOCS off cancer: SOCS3 and PIAS keep STAT3-mediated
  proliferation in balance under normal conditions. Inflammation is needed to deploy
  an attack against pathogens and cancer; nevertheless, inflammation will be halted
  when the noxious agents are no longer present, hence restoring balance. Otherwise,
  cell death follows from uncontrolled pathway activation. Src is part of a family
  of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, called Src family kinases, that can also activate
  the STAT pathway. The IL-6 receptor complex comprises the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor
  α chain and the gp130 receptor chain. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6R antibody, binds
  to the membrane-bound IL-6R portion of the receptor complex. Selective inhibition
  of IL-6 trans-signaling may provide higher efficacy with lower toxicity than complete
  IL-6 inhibition; therefore, agents that selectively target IL-6/soluble IL-6R trans-signaling
  may be attractive.Abbreviations: IL, interleukin; JAK, Janus kinase; PIAS, protein
  inhibitor of activated STAT3; SOCS, suppressors of cytokine signaling; STAT, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription.'
