caption: The two genes coloured in red are specific for cps3. The blue colour indicates
  the two genes that are dispensable in the cps3 locus because homologues occur elsewhere
  in the S. pneumoniae genome. The nomenclature suggested by Bentley et al. was used
  . Alternative gene names introduced by Dillard et al.  and Arrecubieta et al.  are
  indicated in brackets.
