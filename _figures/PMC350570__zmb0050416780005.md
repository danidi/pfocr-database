caption: Model for two differing innervation-dependent mechanisms that inhibit myogenin.
  In innervated (Inn), electrically active muscle, the transient release of calcium
  from intracellular stores and/or the entry of extracellular calcium through voltage-activated
  channels increases the activity of PKC and CaMKII, resulting in the phosphorylation
  of Myg at T87, inhibiting Myg from binding E-boxes and activating myg transcription.
  Electrical activity stimulates a second inactivation pathway, which may inhibit
  transcription mediated by proteins that bind a MEF2 site and/or a MEF3 site in the
  myg regulatory region. This second inactivation pathway is rapidly lost following
  denervation (Den, 12 h), but myg transcription resumes only after sufficient Myg
  phosphorylated at T87 (Myg-T87-P) is dephosphorylated and/or adequate Myg is synthesized
  to activate myg transcription (Den, 24 h). In mygT87N/T87N mutant mice, once the
  second inactivation mechanism is no longer effective (Den, 12 h), the latent transcriptional
  potential of T87N myogenin is apparent and results in a premature increase in myg
  transcription.
