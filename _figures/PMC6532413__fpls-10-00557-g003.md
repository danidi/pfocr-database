caption: The role of COP1 in the BR signaling pathway. Under the light conditions,
  COP1 is transported out of the nucleus, leading to enhanced HY5/HYH accumulation
  and increased expression of genes involved in photomorphogenesis, COP1 also induces
  MSBP1 accumulation, which can thereby interfere with the function of BRI1/BAK1 and
  affect the transduction of BR signals. Meanwhile, COP1 suppression of BIN2 and pBZR1
  is reversed, positively affecting BR signal transduction while GATA2 is activated
  to promote photomorphogenesis. In the dark, accumulation of COP1 in the nucleus
  inhibits the activities of positive photomorphogenesis regulators (such as HY5);
  on the other hand, COP1 might also enhance the suppression of negative regulators
  in the BR signal, thus promoting the expression of genes in skotomorphogenesis.
