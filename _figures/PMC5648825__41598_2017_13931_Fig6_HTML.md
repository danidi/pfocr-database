caption: Proposed SP pathway of eukaryotic protozoan parasites based on the detailed
  sphingolipidome analysis (bold) performed in this study. The pathway takes into
  consideration the variations of the headgroup, FA length and degree of unsaturation
  as well as the LCB chain length and degree of unsaturation and hydroxylation. The
  enzymes involved in most steps remain to be identified and characterized. Some of
  the pathways are found in human (host) but a few (denoted by **) are unique in some
  parasite species, including the synthesis of AEPnC and IPC. *EPC is found in low
  abundance in mammalian cells, but highly enriched in several parasites.
