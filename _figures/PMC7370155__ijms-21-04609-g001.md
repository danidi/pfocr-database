caption: HMGB1 mediated neuroinflammatory response in TBI. TBI induces nucleocytoplasmic
  translocation of HMGB1 resulting into the release of HMGB1 in extracellular milieu.
  The extracellular HMGB1 may be partially oxidized at the two cysteine residues generating
  the disulfide form of HMGB1. The disulfide HMGB1 further binds to its prominent
  receptor system such as TLR4 and RAGE which in turn interacts with MD-2 and initiates
  the MyD88 dependent pathway. It also binds to Ras to initiate the ERK pathway, respectively.
  HMGB1-TLR4 axis can activate NF-κB signaling both directly and through TRAF6. These
  pathways ultimately interact with the NF-κB lead to the generation of neuroinflammatory
  response by producing several pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6).
  In this way, HMGB1 might mediate the TBI-induced secondary injury where HMGB1 is
  understood to amplify vicious neuroinflammation, M1 polarization, apoptosis, oxidative
  damage, cerebral edema, increased BBB permeability. TBI, Traumatic brain injury;
