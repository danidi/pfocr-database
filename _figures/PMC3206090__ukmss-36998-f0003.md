caption: 'The aberrant activation of caspase-6 that is seen in animal models and patients
  of both HD and AD could be mediated through multiple pathways: 1) Excitotoxicity,
  as described above, leads to an excessive influx of Ca2+, which can depolarize mitochondria
  and lead to caspase activation. 2) Aberrant signalling through trophic receptors
  or death receptors as outlined can result a release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo
  from mitochondria, which activate caspase-9 and inhibit Bcl-2 as well as IAP proteins.
  These events lead to a subsequent activation of caspase-6 by both blocking of inhibitory
  pathways as well as direct activation through caspase-9. 3) Caspase-6 and -3 could
  furthermore be activated through the intrinsic pathway, since evidence for DNA and
  mitochondrial damage, ER stress and protein misfolding as well as oxidative stress
  is found in AD and HD patients and animal models. Degradation of caspase-6 through
  the proteasome reduces its activity. Therapeutic targets are highlighted in red.'
