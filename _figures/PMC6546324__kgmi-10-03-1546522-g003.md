caption: Simplified diagram for the simultaneous oxidation of lactate and reduction
  of sulfide, based on data for the prominent SRB Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough.
  Both lactate oxidation and sulfate reduction occur in the cell cytoplasm. The protons
  and electrons produced during lactate oxidation are acted upon by a number of hydrogenase
  enzymes, with interconversion between H2, and 2H+ + 2e−. A proton gradient is maintained
  across the cytoplasmic membrane, enabling the synthesis of ATP by membrane-bound
  ATPase. * = ATP synthase; ~ = hydrogenase enzyme. See refs. , ,  and  for full pathway
  descriptions.
