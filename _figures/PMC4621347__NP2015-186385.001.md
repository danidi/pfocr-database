caption: The role of putrescine in neuron and Schwann cell responses. This figure
  summarizes the previously reported functions of polyamines in neurons and Schwann
  cells within the wider literature from in vitro and in vivo studies and how these
  mechanisms could elicit the observed responses in the current study. Neurotrophins
  and growth factors secreted by implanted Schwann can elevate intrinsic cyclic AMP
  levels within neurons. Cyclic AMP is an important second messenger whose main effectors
  are downstream protein kinase signaling cascades (e.g., PKA) that result in the
  phosphorylation and activation of the constitutive transcription factor CREB. Bound
  to the nuclear DNA, CREB is known to enhance the expression of a number of genes
  that include arginase 1, which encodes the first enzyme of the polyamine pathway
  to generate endogenous putrescine. Putrescine produces a number of neuroprotective
  effects by scavenging free radicals and suppressing excitotoxicity. Putrescine also
  promotes the reorganization of actin and microtubules, allowing axons to grow. Administered
  putrescine is known to be taken up by both the neuron, bolstering the effects of
  the endogenous polyamines, and SCs, encouraging their migration and proliferation
  in vitro. We hypothesize that SC implants and administered putrescine work in concert
  to augment each other's ability to promote neuropreservation and neuroregeneration
  following SCI.
