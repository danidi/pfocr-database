caption: (a) Condition-specific dependency network (CDN) for TG-101348-sensitive cell
  lines. Dashed lines represent statistical dependencies while solid lines known interactions.
  Size of nodes represents node essentiality. (b) CDN for TG-101348-insensitive cell
  lines. (c) Evidence network for the TG-101348 – DAPK3 drug-mediator pair. All edges
  represent a known association based from the STRING/STITCH databases. Blue edges
  represent mediator-gene associations, red edges drug-gene associations, and yellow
  edge a direct drug-mediator association.
