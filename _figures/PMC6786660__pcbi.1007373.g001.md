caption: '(a): the cross-section of the simulated cylindrical volume (insert) containing
  a semispherically shaped chloroplast, the peripheral cytoplasm, and a part of the
  vacuole interior (not to scale). The cylinder radius is determined by the chloroplast
  surface coverage. (b): The cylindrical symmetry approximates the ‘personal’ space
  of an individual chloroplast in a roughly hexagonal close-packed arrangement of
  chloroplasts in the areas of mesophyll surface adjacent to internal airspaces. An
  arrangement is shown at 50% surface coverage ratio. The simulated cylinder is represented
  by the dashed circle. (c) A comparison of the chloroplast light-harvesting capacity
  expressed in terms of photon absorption per stromal volume and the fraction of maximal
  incoming solar flux it would correspond to. An array of a 1.5 μm radius chloroplasts
  with 40 mol m-3s-1 light-harvesting capacity at 50% cell surface coverage could
  capture 1% of maximal-insolation photon flux incident on the cell surface. (d):
  A schematic representation of the physical processes and chemical pathways modelled.
  O2, CO2, and HCO3- can freely diffuse within individual regions, but O2 and CO2
  can also diffuse through interregional boundaries (dashed green and blue arrows).
  Depending on the region, the interconversion of CO2 and HCO3- (dark blue arrows)
  proceeds with or without CA assistance. CO2 reacting with RuBP-primed RubisCO drives
  the Calvin-Benson cycle (orange arrows). O2 reacting with RuBP-primed RubisCO activates
  the photorespiratory pathway (red arrows). HCO3- reacting with PEP-primed PEPC is
  the starting point for the carbon transport through the C4pathway (purple arrows).
  Oxygen production at PS-II is coupled to the NADPH consumption in the Calvin-Benson
  and photorespiratory cycles (black arrows). Parentheses in (a) and (d) show the
  default parameter values.'
