caption: Aging negatively affects HSC function through both intrinsic and hematopoietic
  microenvironment mediated mechanisms. Intrinsic effects include increased ROS levels
  leading to DNA damage and replicative senescence, epigenomic alterations with H4K16ac,
  H4K20me3 and H3K4me3 and telomere attrition. Increased ROS in aged HSC consequently
  activates p38-MAPK, followed by induction of cell cycle regulators p53, BCL2 and
  p16Ink4a, resulting in an age-associated decline in HSC function and increased senescence.
  Moreover, aging associated amplification of nutrient sensing PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
  and the inhibition of downstream FOXO (1, 3 and 4) transcription factors, as well
  as metabolic alterations comprising decrement in NAD+ or Sirtuins (Sirt1/3/7) and
  consequent alleviation of transcription factors Nrf1, ERRα, and PPARα are involved
  in loss of proteostasis, autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in aged
  HSC. Low calorie intake however activate AMPK pathway, and promotes HSC quiescence
  and self-renewal. Increase in Cdc42 activity and subsequently loss of Cdc42 and
  tubulin polarization in aged HSC associated with defective HSC self-renewal activity.
  Aging associated changes in hematopoietic microenvironment including high oxidative
  stress, decreased adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells, increased adipogenic differentiation
  and decreased mesenchymal progenitors also linked with reduced HSC self-renewal
  and differentiation, homing as well as HSC mobilization. Various niche cells including
  osteoblasts, endothelial cells (EC), Nestin+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), CXCL12
  abundant retricular (CAR) cells and nonmyelinating Schwann cells have been implicated
  for their roles in HSC aging. In addition, aging of HSC increased CD41 expression,
  which modulates HSC long-term repopulation and survival as well as myeloid skewing,
  while increased levels of surface adhesion molecules P-selectin (CD62P) and intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1/CD54) have been associated with enhanced HSC mobility
  and attenuated engraftment. Red down arrows represent repressive and blue up arrows
  represents activating signals. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), osteopontin (OPN),
  common myeloid progenitor (CMP), common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA), oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), Forkhead O (FOXO), nuclear respiratory
  factor 1 (Nrf1), estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor alpha (PPARα), CXC-chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), CC-chemokine ligand 5
  (CCL5).
