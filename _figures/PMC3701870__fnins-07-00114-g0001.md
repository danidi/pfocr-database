caption: Striatal projection pathways. In the direct “GO” pathway, MSNs expressing
  DA D1 receptors receive inputs from intratelencephalically projecting (IT) neurons
  in the cortex (Ctx) and project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) as
  well as the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). In the indirect “STOP”
  pathway, MSNs expressing DA D2 receptors receive inputs from pyramidal tract (PT)
  neurons in the Ctx and project to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe).
  The GPe, in turn, projects to the STN and SNr. Both D1 and D2 MSNs also receive
  afferents from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and thalamus (Thal).
