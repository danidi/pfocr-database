caption: Association between expression of cell cycle proteins in NETs according to
  pathway. Raw immunoreactivity scores were used for correlation analysis. CCND1 expression
  was positively correlated with expression of CDK4 (R = 0.12, P = 0.05) and phospho-RB1
  (R = 0.21, P = 0.0007). CDK6 expression was positively correlated with expression
  of CDK4 (R = 0.26, P < 0.0001). NETs indicates neuroendocrine tumors; P, phosphorylated.
