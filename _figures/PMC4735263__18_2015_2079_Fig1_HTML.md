caption: A simplified illustration of the multiple metabolic pathways of glucose in
  the brain and the metabolic signals used in different neuroimaging techniques. The
  initial step of glucose metabolism is phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate
  (Glc-6-P) by hexokinase. Glc-6-P can enter several metabolic pathways in the brain.
  It can be metabolized to produce energy via glycolysis or the TCA cycle. Glycolytic
  and TCA cycle intermediates are also used for the synthesis of amino acids and neurotransmitters.
  In addition, Glc-6-P is a precursor for glycogen. Lastly, metabolism of Glc-6-P
  via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) provides pentose for nucleotide synthesis
  and NADPH, required for reductive reactions, such as lipid synthesis and for protection
  against oxidative stress. Arteriovenous concentration differences (AV dif) can be
  used to estimate global cerebral metabolic rate from the disappearance of metabolites
  from the circulation. PET (depicted in orange) uses radiolabeled glucose analogues
  (such as FDG), which are trapped early in metabolism (for example fluorodeoxyglucose-6-phosphate/FDG-6-P),
  to estimate rates of glucose uptake and metabolism. 31P MRS (depicted in blue) provides
  information about ATP production and thus brain energy metabolism. 13C-MRS (depicted
  in green) is useful for estimating TCA cycle fluxes and CMRglc, derived from 13C
  label incorporation into specific metabolites (Glu, Gln). Both ASL and BOLD fMRI
  provide estimates of CBF
