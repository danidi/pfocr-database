caption: Schematic representation of metformin/AMPK/ER signalling pathway and its
  potential crosstalk with bromocriptine/D2R pathway in prolactinoma treatment. Red
  arrow/line refers to regulatory relationship proposed in this study. Dashed line
  with question mark refers to potential AMPK‐independent pathway for BC/D2R to regulate
  ER expression
