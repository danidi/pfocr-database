caption: The intersection of radiation and the tumor immune microenvironment. A, Microbiome.
  Broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce microbiome diversity, which decreases gut microbiota–derived
  SCFA, leading to increased antigen presentation and T-cell priming, which sensitizes
  tumors to radiotherapy. B, Immune response. Immunogenic cell death leads to release
  of DAMPs such as high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), calreticulin, and ATP.
  Cytosolic DNA activates the cGAS/STING pathway, leading to an increase in IFNb,
  which activates Baft3þ dendritic cells that play a key role in cross-presentation
  and cross-priming of CD8þ T cells. CD39þ CD103þ tissue resident memory T cells also
  increase sensitivity to ionizing radiation. C, Metabolome. Hypoxia leads to an increase
  in glucose uptake and glycolysis, which contributes to radioresistance. During hypoxic
  conditions, mitochondria act as O2 sensors and convey signals to hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF)-1a. Impaired glucose and lipid metabolism leads to an increase in lipid
  and fatty acid stores, and fatty acid uptake by CD36, can increase radiosensitivity.
  PPAR-g inhibition of p53 can also increase sensitivity to ionizing radiation. D,
  Stroma. FGF2 is sequestered in the extracellularmatrix and released upon proteolysis.
  FGF signaling induces M1 to M2 macrophage conversion. M1 macrophages promote radiosensitivity,
  while M2-polarized macrophages mediate radiation resistance and promote MSCs to
  develop an M2 phenotype, which facilitates tumor cell migration and invasion.
