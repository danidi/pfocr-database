caption: Fine adjustment of autophagy by the AMPK-mTORC1-Ulk1/2 kinase network. The
  two protein complexes AMPK and mTORC1 are known to oppositely regulate the autophagy
  inducing complex Ulk1/2-Atg13-FIP200. Under sufficient supply of growth factors
  and nutrients, the active mTORC1 stimulates growth related processes such as protein
  translation, e.g., by phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP, while simultaneously inhibiting
  self-consuming processes such as autophagy (, ). mTORC1 activity is positively regulated
  by growth factor signaling via the PI3K-Akt pathway. Akt activates mTORC1 by inhibition
  of TSC1/2 (, , , ) or PRAS40 (), two negative regulators of mTORC1 activity that
  both antagonize the Rheb-mediated activation. Hypoxia counteracts mTORC1 activation
  via the TSC1/2-Rheb pathway, e.g., by upregulation of REDD1 (). Amino acids, in
  contrast, stimulate the Rag-GTPase-dependent recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes
  and its subsequent activation by Rheb-GTPases (, , ). The catalytic activity of
  AMPK crucially depends on phosphorylation by upstream kinases, such as the constitutively
  active LKB1. AMPK activity is further enhanced by decreasing ATP/AMP ratios ().
  In addition, the other two known upstream kinases, CaMKKβ and TAK1, have been implicated
  in AMPK-mediated autophagy induction by intracellular [Ca2+] and TRAIL treatment,
  respectively (, ). Under low-energy conditions, AMPK positively regulates autophagy
  induction () through inhibition of mTORC1. This releases the negative regulation
  of mTORC1 on the Ulk1/2-Atg13-FIP200 complex, especially on Ulk1/2 kinase activity
  (, , ). AMPK inhibits mTORC1 either via the TSC1/2-Rheb pathway () or by direct
  phosphorylation of raptor (). However, AMPK is also able to bind, phosphorylate,
  and directly activate Ulk1/2 (, , , , , ). Again, this interaction is counteracted
  by mTORC1 (). For a more detailed discussion see Roach () and . Prolonged TORC1
  activation, on the other hand, leads to the accumulation of Sestrin (SESN) in Drosophila,
  a DNA damage-inducible protein that suppresses TOR activity by AMPK activation ().
  Furthermore, mTORC1 not only inhibits autophagy by suppressing Ulk1/2 kinase activity,
  it also simultaneously inhibits DAP1, a negative regulator of autophagy (). mTORC1
  inhibition thus leads to both autophagy induction via Ulk1/2-Atg13-FIP200 and to
  its restriction via DAP1. Ulk1 kinase activity might be linked to autophagy induction
  in several ways. Two downstream targets of Ulk1 have been proposed thus far. First,
  Ulk1 directly phosphorylates AMBRA1, a Beclin1-interacting protein and regulatory
  component of the PI3K class III complex () and, second, it phosphorylates and activates
  a distinct myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in mammals (ZIPK) and Drosophila (Sqa)
  (). Two Ulk1-dependent feedback loops additionally help to fine-tune the autophagic
  response. Ulk1 has been shown to phosphorylate and inhibit both of its upstream
  regulators AMPK and mTORC1. While phosphorylation of raptor might help to maintain
  mTORC1 inhibition when nutrients are limited (, ), the inhibition of AMPK activity
  by Ulk1 antagonizes this action and restricts the autophagic response (). This perplexingly
  complex network of mutual activation and inhibition will ultimately establish an
  appropriate response to conflicting demands.

    The two protein complexes AMPK and mTORC1 are known to oppositely regulate the
