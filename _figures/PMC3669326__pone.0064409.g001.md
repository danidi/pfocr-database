caption: Activation through phosphorylation of the substrate kinase at each step is
  mediated by the upstream kinase, the single and doubly phosphorylated states of
  the substrate being denoted by the superscripts “*” and “**”, respectively. Activated
  kinases are eventually dephosphorylated into their inactive forms by the corresponding
  phosphatases (indicated by the suffix “-P’ase”). Activity in the three-component
  pathway is initiated by a signal S regulating the activation of the MAPK kinase
  kinase (MAP3K). Activated MAP3K controls the activation of MAPK kinase (MAP2K),
  which in its turn regulates the activation of MAPK. Note that unlike the single
  phosphorylation of MAP3K, both MAP2K and MAPK require double phosphorylation in
  order to become active, i.e., capable of acting as the enzyme for the corresponding
  downstream substrate protein. The eventual response of the cascade is quantified
  by the concentration of activated MAPK, which can be used in initiating transcription,
  activating other protein molecules, etc.

  description: Activation through phosphorylation of the substrate kinase at each

    Activated kinases are eventually dephosphorylated into their inactive forms by

    the three-component pathway is initiated by a signal S regulating the activation
    of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K). Activated MAP3K controls the activation of
    MAPK kinase (MAP2K), which in its turn regulates the activation of MAPK. Note
