caption: Schematic overview of TGF-β/SMAD and non-SMAD signalling. TGF-β triggers
  cellular responses by binding and activating two transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinase
  receptors, denominated TGF-β type I (TβR-I) and type II (TβR-II). In the canonical
  SMAD pathway, activation of these ligand–receptor complexes lead to the phosphorylation
  and activation of SMAD2/3 which, in turn, binds to cofactor SMAD4. The trimeric
  SMAD complex translocates into the nucleus and cooperates with other transcription
  molecules to regulate target gene expression. The activation of transcription factors
  such as Snail, Twist, or ZEB promotes the prolonged induction of EMT, repressing
  epithelial marker genes and activating genes linked to the mesenchymal phenotype.
  Feedback regulation is mediated by SMAD7 which interferes with the binding of SMAD2/3
  to TGF-β receptors. In the non-SMAD pathway, TGF-β receptors activate other pathways
  that contribute to induce the EMT program. The RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK MAPK signalling cascade
  is a major non-canonical pathway activated by the TGF-β/ TGF-βRI/II complex. Once
  activated, ERK1 and ERK2 MAPK can facilitate EMT by increasing the expression of
  EMT transcription factors.
