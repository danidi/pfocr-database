caption: A speculative pathway for the production of PQQ, illustrating the large number
  of unknown features. A. A working mechanism invokes hydroxylation of the conserved
  Tyr within PqqA by PqqB, prior to the action of PqqE. B. The limited number of conserved
  components of the PQQ operon suggests the presence of a number of spontaneous (non-catalyzed)
  steps. C. The last step, in which AHQQ is converted to PQQ, is established.
