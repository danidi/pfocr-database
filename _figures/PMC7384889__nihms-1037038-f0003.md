caption: Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) is an ER resident chaperone able to specifically
  bind type I procollagen molecules, preventing local unfolding and lateral aggregation
  and/or fibril formation. In the ER, HSP47 interacts with the chaperone peptidyl
  prolyl cis-trans isomerase 65-KDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP65) and the lysyl hydroxylase
  2 (LH2). The stability of this complex is regulated by the master effector of the
  unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, Bip. Upon binding to HSP47, procollagen
  trafficking towards Golgi is mediated by the formation of larger COPII vesicles
  derived by the HSP47 anchorage to the SH3 domain of the ER protein TANGO1. Once
  reaching the Golgi, HSP47 releases its cargo in a pH dependent manner and it is
  recycled back to the ER thanks to the presence of a C-terminal RDEL retention signal.HSP47
  interacts also with the Ire1α effector of the UPR, thus modulating the adaptive
  UPR.
