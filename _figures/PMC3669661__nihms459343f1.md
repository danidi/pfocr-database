caption: Regulation of mTOR has many inputs. The PI3K input involves the generation
  of PIP3 from PIP2, which recruits and activates phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
  1 (PDK1), which then phosphorylates Akt at Thr308. Subsequently, Akt phosphorylates
  and suppresses the GAP activity of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) consisting
  of TSC1 and TSC2 (TSC1/2). Suppression of TSC1/2 results in elevated activation
  of the GTPase Rheb, which leads to a complex activation of mTORC1 via the activation
  of PLD1 and suppression of FKBP38 whereby elevated PLD activity generates the PA
  necessary for the formation of mTORC1 complex, and FKBP38 dissociates from mTORC1().
  This pathway is also impacted by AMPK, which in combination with the tumor suppressor
  LKB1 activates TSC1/2, which suppresses Rheb and thus mTOR – under conditions where
  ATP levels are low and AMP levels are high. Akt is also phosphorylated by mTORC2
  at Ser473 in response to insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), in a PLD-dependent
  manner. Phosphorylation at this site has been correlated with altered substrate
  specificity and kinase activity for Akt. Insulin also increases the level of glucose
  transporters and increased uptake of glucose (). A common theme in this complex
  signaling network leading to mTORC1 activation is that it is highly sensitive to
  the presence of glucose and amino acids – nutrients needed for cell growth.
