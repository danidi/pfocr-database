caption: 'Schematic summary of mechanisms underlying prolonged A1R activation-induced
  sortilin upregulation and α-synuclein accumulation in dopaminergic neurons.Prolonged
  A1R activation induced by CPA administration dramatically increased sortilin expression
  via the JNK/c-JUN pathway. Subse-quently, sortilin bound to α-synuclein protein
  to aggravate its accumulation in dopaminergic neurons. Substantial accumulation
  of α-synuclein disturbs its transport by sortilin to the lysosome for degradation
  or to the plasma membrane for exocytosis by vesicular traf-ficking, which in turn
  accelerates cellular accumulation of α-synuclein protein. Consequently, long-term
  A1R activation facilitated sortilin upregulation and α-synuclein accumulation to
  damage dopaminergic neurons, ultimately leading to host PD-like behavior. A1R: Adenosine
  A1 receptor; CPA: N6-cyclopentyladenosine; JNK: c-JUN N-terminal kinase; PD: Parkinson’s
  disease.'
