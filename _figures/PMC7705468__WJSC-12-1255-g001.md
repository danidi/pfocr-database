caption: 'Mechanisms involved in the tenocytes during the process of diabetic tendinopathy.
  High glucose and high insulin inhibit the expression of the tendon-related genes
  TGF-β, collagen I, and biglycan in tenocytes by inactivating the AMPK/Egr1 pathway.
  In addition, high glucose promotes the adipogenic transdifferentiation of tenocytes
  and increases the protein expression of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2. Activation of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway plays an essential role in maintaining the expression of the adipogenic
  transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and C/EBP,
  however, activation of ERK signaling downregulates PPARγ expression, suggesting
  the fibroblast-to-adipocyte phenotypic transition induced by high glucose which
  can be inhibited by Akt inhibitor LY294002 and promoted by ERK inhibitor PD98059.
  High glucose stimulates transglutaminase (Tgase) activity, leading to an increase
  in extracellular matrix degradation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation
  is also increased in tenocytes under high glucose conditions, triggering the oxidative
  stress and increasing Tgase activity. Oxidative stress increases both FOXO1 and
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) expression in tenocytes. Under high glucose
  conditions, miR28-5p is also upregulated, especially in oxidative stress-treated
  tenocytes. miR28-5p directly inhibits the expression of the p53 deacetylase sirtuin
  3, resulting in an increase in acetylated p53. p53 inhibits the expression of miR17-92,
  repressing the degradation of the proapoptotic protein Bim. Meanwhile, FOXO1 promotes
  the transcription of Bim, the gene product of which is a proapoptotic protein. Inhibition
  of Bim degradation and upregulation of Bim transcription synergistically result
  in an increase in Bim, facilitating the tenocyte apoptosis. However, under low glucose
  conditions, miR28-5p-sirt3-p53 pathway is not stimulated. Instead, p38 MAPK is activated
  and acts on both FOXO1 and HIF1α, resulting in the inhibition of FOXO1 transcriptional
  activity and activation of HIF1α. HIF1α enhances the expression of the tendon-related
  genes Sox9 and Scx. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which bind to receptor
  for AGEs, impair the mitochondrial functions, affecting the DNA and mRNA synthesis
  in tenocytes. In addition, mitochondrial and total ROS/superoxide production are
  also remarkably increased in AGEs-treated tenocytes. AGEs: Advanced glycation end-products;
  RAGE: Receptor for AGEs; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; Tgase: Transglutaminase;
  Col I: Collagen I; Bgn: Biglycan; PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  γ; HIF1α: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α.'
