caption: K-Ras/MEK signaling pathway positively regulates Met mRNA levels. Met mRNA
  is translated by the eIF4F complex (eIF4E and eIF4G) via cap-dependent translation
  (left). In anchorage-independent culture conditions, enhanced Mettranslation increases
  Met expression. Increased Met expression results in increased cell proliferation
  (middle). In anchorage independent culture conditions under K-Ras ablation, Met
  protein expression is decreased due to Met mRNA down-regulation even with enhanced
  Met translation. Down-regulation of Met signaling results in the suppression of
  cell proliferation.
