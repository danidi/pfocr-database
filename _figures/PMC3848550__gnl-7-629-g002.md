caption: Schematic representation of the sialic acid metabolism pathway in eukaryotic
  cells. The synthesis, activation, conjugation, and breakdown of mammalian sialic
  acids (N-acetyl neuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) are shown. Sialic acid is taken in through
  the diet or synthesized in the cytosol. From there, it is transported into the nucleus,
  where cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-sialic acid is synthesized. In the Golgi apparatus,
  ST6 Gal I transfers the sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to a glycoprotein. ST6
  Gal I is cleaved by cathepsin-like proteases, and then released from the cell. The
  sialylated conjugates can be cleared by neuraminidases in lysosomes, the cytosol,
  the plasma membrane, and mitochondria. Gal, galactose; GlcNAc, N-acetyl glucosamine;
  Man, mannose; Neu, neuraminidase.
