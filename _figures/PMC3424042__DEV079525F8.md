caption: Major steps in MP3 and H-cell development. A single segment is shown. (A)
  sim commits mesectodermal cells to an MP4 fate. (B) wg signaling activates slp1/2
  expression in the anterior region, which represses en and commits cells to an MP1
  fate (pink). (C) hh signaling directs a group of anterior cells to an MP3 fate (green)
  by activating expression of gsb/gsb-n. (D) Notch signaling selects one cell in the
  MP3 cluster to become MP3. (E) H-cell and H-cell sib fates are determined by Notch
  signaling and asymmetric localization of Numb. gsb/gsb-n activate expression of
  l(1)sc and tup in the H-cell. (F) l(1)sc and tup control H-cell-specific gene expression
  and differentiation. Genes expressed in common between the H-cell and H-cell sib
  are regulated by a different pathway.
