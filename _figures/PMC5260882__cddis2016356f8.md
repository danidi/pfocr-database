caption: The proposed hypothesis for DOX-injured cardiomyocyte apoptosis via damage
  to CHIP, destabilizing HSF1 and inducing the IGF-IIR apoptosis signaling pathway.
  Under physiological conditions, the cytosolic CHIP is directly bound to HSF1 through
  its TPR domain, which stabilizes HSF1 binding to the heat shock element (HSE) on
  the IGF-IIR gene to inhibit its expression. Therefore, CHIP chaperones HSF1 at its
  TPR domain to protect cardiomyocyte apoptosis via suppressing the IGF-IIR apoptotic
  signaling pathway. However, DOX challenge damages the CHIP–HSF1 interaction, which
  in turn influences HSF1 stability and results in HSF1 degradation. Once HSF1 degrades,
  IGF-IIR is highly expressed and translocates into the membrane to induce caspase-3
  activation, and eventually cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Moreover, supplementation with
  HSF1A, an HSF1 activator, alleviates DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via suppression
  of the IGF-IIR apoptotic signaling pathway
