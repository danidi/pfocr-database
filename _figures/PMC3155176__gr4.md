caption: FRAM Is Characterized by Increased Signaling of the BRAF/MEK/ERK Pathway(A)
  IPA analysis led to the generation of a gene-interaction network of genes differentially
  expressed in patients. Nodes represent genes, the shape of the node represents the
  functional class of the gene product, and the edges indicate the biological relationship
  between the nodes. Green indicates downregulation, and red indicates upregulation
  in patients compared to controls. The color intensity is correlated with the n-fold
  change.(B) Upregulation of BRAF and p-ERK is confirmed at the protein level in patient
  lymphoblasts (family F005 II-1, II-2, and II-4, from left to right) compared to
  those of two controls. BRAF shows 100% increased intensity, and p-ERK shows 170%
  increased intensity in patients compared to two controls.
