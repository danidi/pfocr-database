caption: Next-generation metabolic screening (NGMS) results in xanthinuria type II.
  Panels b–e, show the feature intensity distribution in 26 control plasma samples
  (X-axis represents feature peak area in arbitrary units), and should be interpreted
  as described in Fig. . Red patient values. a xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) (a1) and
  aldehyde oxidase (AO) function (a2). b Xanthine, m/z 151.02624 ([M − H] − adduct),
  retention time (RT) 2.02, is significantly increased in the patient sample (fold
  change 7.2). c 5-Hydroxyisourate, m/z 183.01634 ([M − H]− adduct), RT 1.47, is significantly
  decreased in the patient sample (fold change −15.4). d Urate, m/z 167.02137 ([M − H]−
  adduct), RT 1.49, is virtually absent in the patient sample (fold change −810.2).
  b–d represent perturbations resulting from defective xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH)
  function (see pathway in a1). e N-1-methyl-4/2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, m/z 153.0659
  ([M + H] + adduct), RT 2.95, is virtually absent in the patient sample (fold change
  −232.4) due to defective AO function (see pathway in a2), and results are therefore
  indicative of type II
