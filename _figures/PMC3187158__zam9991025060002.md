caption: 'Metabolic flux distribution of P. putida KT2440 grown in the presence of
  different amounts of DNP (A) and during overexpression of NADH oxidase (B). In panel
  A, the numbers in each list (from top to bottom) represent reaction rates for growth
  of P. putida KT2440 in the presence of 0, 300, 500, 700, and 1,100 mg liter−1 DNP.
  In panel B, rates in each list (from top to bottom) are given for the reference
  strain P. putida KT2440(pCOM10) and for P. putida KT2440(pCOM10-nox) induced with
  0.002% (vol/vol) and 0.05% (vol/vol) DCPK. On average, the 95% confidence intervals
  were between 5% and 10% for the major fluxes. Fluxes around the glucose-6-phosphate
  node and the TCA cycle could be determined only with higher uncertainties. The nonzero
  fluxes through the glyoxylate shunt in panel A (top values) are a consequence of
  the very high biomass yields determined for the reference state and the culture
  containing 300 mg liter−1 DNP. If this pathway was excluded, the carbon balance
  did not close. Abbreviations: GLC, glucose; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
