caption: Metabolic pathways of sphingolipid metabolism. Ceramide (Cer) is either sinthesized
  by de novo pathway through the sequential action of serine palmitoyl transferase
  (SPT), ketosphinganine reductase (3-KR), ceramide synthase (CerS), and dihydroceramide
  desaturase (DES), or it is generated from sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolisis by sphingomyelinase
  enzyme (SMase). Cer could be converted into sphingosine (Sph) by ceramidase (CDase)
  action. Ceramide kinase (CerK) and sphingosine kinase (SphK) generate ceramide 1-phosphate
  (C1P) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), respectively.
