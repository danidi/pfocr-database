caption: 'Schematic depiction of TRPM8 regulation by α2A- and β-adrenoreceptors. α2A-AR
  stimulation by clonidine initiates a sequence of intracellular events as follows:
  Gαi protein activation following clonidine fixation on α2A-AR leads to AC inhibition
  and decrease of cAMP production. By consequence, PKA transition from an inactive
  (i-PKA) to an active (PKA) form is reduced. In parallel, the intracellular serine/threonine
  protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylates TRPM8 Ser-9 and Thr-17 inhibiting
  the channel activity. This inhibitory pathway can be abolished by stimulation of
  β-AR with isoproterenol, because it would lead to a stimulation of the Gαs protein
  coupled to this receptor and to an up-regulation of the adenylate cyclase activity.
  The subsequent increase in cAMP concentration would potentiate PKA phosphorylation,
  which will fully maintain the functional activity of TRPM8.'
