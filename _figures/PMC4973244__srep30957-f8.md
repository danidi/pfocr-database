caption: SEA upregulates the expression of P-STAT3 via the activation of TLR4 signaling.
  Then, P-STAT3 may contribute to the upregulation of P-p53 as well as its targeting
  gene, p21. Additionally, SOCS3 is also involved in the process through interaction
  with p53. Ultimately, the increased level of p21 promotes the senescence of LX-2
  cells.
