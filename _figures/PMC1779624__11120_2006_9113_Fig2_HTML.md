caption: The initial hypothesis for a revised reaction scheme for the reductive PP
  of photosynthetic carbon reduction in C-3 plants. The hypothesis differs from the
  Calvin Pathway by the inclusion of new enzymes and reactions by octulose and arabinose
  phosphates and is tested by the results reported in this paper. The figure shows
  the distributions (for one cycle) of the coloured carbon of CO2 into traditional
  and proposed new intermediates of a modified Calvin Pathway
