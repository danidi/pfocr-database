caption: 'Mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitochondrial biogenesis lead to
  insulin resistance and other risk factors of metabolic syndrome. Various etiological
  factors lead to impair cell metabolism to nutrient overload which increases 12/15-LOX
  expression in the adipocytes. ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) induced
  by 12/15-LOX increase the adipocyte inflammation and recruits macrophages into the
  adipocytes. Resultant increase of proinflammatory mediators and imbalance in adipokines
  reduced eNOS expression. The reduction in eNOS reduces the formation of nitric oxide
  which impairs mitochondrial biogenesis via cGMP/PGC-1α pathway. This decreases beta
  oxidation of fatty acids and lipid accumulation in adipocytes. The resultant adiposity
  and release of free fatty acids caused mitochondrial dysfunction and paradoxical
  reduction in oxidative phosphorylation and increase in the formation of oxidative
  free radicals. They further activate JNK and PKCs which cause serine phosphorylation
  of IRS-1/2 leading to insulin resistance by decreasing PI3-K/PDK-1/Akt signaling.
  This causes the development of type 2 diabetes which along with central adiposity
  amplifies the risk of cardiovascular diseases in metabolic syndrome. 12/15-LOX:
