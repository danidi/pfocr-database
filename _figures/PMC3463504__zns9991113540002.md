caption: 'SER-7 activates pharyngeal pumping by activating the Gsα signaling pathway
  in response to serotonin. Activation of Gsα signaling has a small effect in activating
  isthmus peristalsis. A, Schematic of the Gsα signaling pathway in C. elegans. B,
  The constitutively active gsa-1(ce81) mutation activated pumping as effectively
  as serotonin did. C, Activation of adenylyl cyclases by an acute forskolin treatment
  activated pumping as effectively as serotonin did. D, ce179, a hypomorphic allele
  of kin-2, increased both feeding rates in response to serotonin. E, The gsa-1(pk75)
  null mutation completely suppressed the serotonin-stimulated pharyngeal pumping.
  Expression of gsa-1 using the flp-21 promoter fully restored the pumping rate in
  the gsa-1(pk75) null mutant in response to serotonin. F, An acy-1(pk1279) null mutation
  attenuated pumping in response to serotonin. G, H, Forskolin (G) and ce179 (H),
  a hypomorphic allele of kin-2, increased pumping in the gsa-1(pk75) null mutant
  in response to serotonin. I, J, Activation of Gsα signaling by constitutively active
  gsa-1(ce81) (I) or by forskolin treatment (J) fully restored pumping in the ser-7(tm1325)
  null mutant in response to serotonin. K, Acute expression of constitutively active
  GSA-1(Q227L) using heat shock was sufficient to activate pharyngeal pumping, but
  not isthmus peristalsis in absence of serotonin. L, Acute expression of constitutively
  active GSA-1(Q227L) using heat shock activated both feeding motions in response
  to serotonin. M, The gsa-1(pk75) null mutation failed to suppress serotonin-stimulated
  isthmus peristalsis. N, The constitutively active acy-1(ce2) mutation activated
  isthmus peristalsis but not pumping in the absence of serotonin. ***p < 0.001; *p
  < 0.05; n.s., not significant (p > 0.05); the unpaired t test (two-tailed test)
  was used for comparison of pumping rates, and the difference indicated in green;
  isthmus peristalsis rates were compared as described in Materials and Methods, and
  the level of significance is indicated by asterisks in pink. #Comparison of isthmus
  peristalsis rates was infeasible due to lack of overlap in pumping rates between
  the two samples compared. The number of animals tested (n ≥ 3 independent assays
  per each group) is shown in parentheses.'
