caption: De novo synthesis of DPPC by the CDP-choline pathway. DPPC (16:0/16:0) is
  synthesized via the CDP-choline (Kennedy) pathway. In this pathway, CTP-phosphocholine
  cytidylyltransferase-α (CCT-α) makes the liponucleotide cytidine 5′-diphosphate-choline
  (CDP-choline) from choline phosphate (choline-P) and cytidine 5′-triphosphate (CTP).
  This reaction, which is rate-limiting for DPPC synthesis, also generates inorganic
  pyrophosphate (PPi). 1,2-Diacylglycerol [DAG (16:0/16:0)] is synthesized from glycerol-3-phosphate
  (glycerol-3-P) by sequential acylation. Glycerol-3-P is first palmitoylated at the
  sn-1 position to form lysophosphatidic acid [LPA (16:0)] by acyl-CoA:glucose-3-P
  acyltransferase (GPAT). Acyl-CoA:LPA acyltransferase (LPAT) then catalyzes a second
  palmitoylation of LPA at the sn-2 position to generate phosphatidic acid [PA (16:0/16:0)].
  Both reactions also yield CoA (not shown). Dephosphorylation of PA by PA phosphatase
  (PAP) generates DAG (16:0/16:0). The final reaction of CDP-choline with DAG (16:0/16:0)
  to yield DPPC (16:0/16:0), glycerol (not shown), and cytidine 5′-monophosphate (CMP;
  not shown) is catalyzed by choline phosphotransferase (CPT). Enzymes are shown in
  bold font. Gray circles, phosphate moiety.
