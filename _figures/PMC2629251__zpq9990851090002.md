caption: Differentiation of vulE vs. vulF. The positions of the vulE and vulF cells
  relative to the anchor cell (AC) are shown. vulF is closer spatially than vulE to
  the AC. The network diagram was generated using BioTapestry Editor, Version 2.1.0
  (www.biotapestry.org) (). Linkages with arrowheads represent positive inputs and
  linkages with bar-heads represent repressor inputs for target gene expression. Black
  font indicates detectable expression levels and gray font indicates no detectable
  expression. This model presumes that nhr-67 acts in the AC to differentiate between
  vulE and vulF cells. Signal X could be Ras, Wnt, or some other signaling pathway.
  The blue linkage in vulF is indicated by a thicker line than the blue linkage in
  vulE because it is hypothesized that vulF receives higher levels of signal X-mediated
  nhr-67 signal from the AC. The thick purple and pink linkages highlight differences
  in the network architecture between the vulE and vulF cells, respectively.
