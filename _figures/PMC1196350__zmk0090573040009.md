caption: Diagram to show a novel pathway for calcimycin-induced apoptosis in N/N1003A
  cells, also a novel protective mechanism of αB-crystallin against calcimycin-induced
  apoptosis and the partial explanation why the ocular lens lacks spontaneous tumor.
  Calcimycin induces an increase of the intracellular calcium, which induces RAS-GRF2
  translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane to activate RAS. RAS then activates
  RAF1, leading to activation of the downstream MEK1/2, which activates ERK1/2. Activation
  of this pathway triggers p53 up-regulation and activation, which through regulation
  of Bax, signals the mitochondrial death pathway as reflected by the release of cytochrome
  c followed by activation of caspase-3. In lens epithelial cells (LECs), stress-activated
  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway mediates apoptosis, leading to elimination of
  cells with genome lesion. In contrast, in most other cells, the same pathway activated
  by stress promotes survival, allowing accumulation of cells with damaged DNA, which
  likely develops into cancer. This partially explains why the ocular lens lacks spontaneous
  tumor. αB-crystallin suppresses calcimycin-induced RAS-GRF2 translocation to block
  RAS activation and thus suppress the activation of ERK signaling pathway. Through
  repression of ERK1/2 activation, it prevents downstream apoptotic events including
  calcimycin-induced up-regulation of p53 and Bax, release of cytochrome c and activation
  of caspase-3. Up-arrow stands for the increase of intracellular calcium (Ca2+),
  or up-regulation of enzyme activity (RAS, RAF1, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and capase-3), or
  up-regulation of protein (p53, Bax, and cytochrome c).

  description: Diagram to show a novel pathway for calcimycin-induced apoptosis in
    N/N1003A cells, also a novel protective mechanism of αB-crystallin against calcimycin-induced

    Calcimycin induces an increase of the intracellular calcium, which induces RAS-GRF2

    Activation of this pathway triggers p53 up-regulation and activation, which through
