caption: Inhibition of the complement system by pathogenic fungi. Activation of the
  different pathways is initiated by the C1q complex in the classical pathway, MBL
  (mannan-binding lectins), or ficolins in the lectin pathway and the C3 thioester
  bond in the alternative pathway. All pathways result in the assembly of the C3 convertase
  enzyme responsible for the cleavage of the C3 component into C3a and C3b. The binding
  of C3b to the available C3 convertase results in C5 convertase, which cleaves C5
  into C5a and C5b. This latter binding to different components, such as C6, C7, C8,
  and C9 molecules, results in a membrane attack complex (MAC) that causes cell lysis.
  Factor H is involved in the alternative pathway as a regulatory component that prevents
  C3 and C5 convertase formation and inactivates C3b. Plasminogen, another protein
  present in plasma, is related to the complement system since it may bind to C3 and
  induce its cleavage into C3b and C5, inhibiting complement activation. The figure
  shows examples of pathogenic fungus interactions with the different components of
  complement system regulatory molecules or other molecules resulting from the decrease
  in cell lysis and opsonization favoring the survival of these pathogens.
