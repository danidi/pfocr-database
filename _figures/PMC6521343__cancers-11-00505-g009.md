caption: Scheme of the mechanism activated by high doses of ethanol. High doses of
  ethanol induce ROS generation and ER stress responsible for the induction of a prosurvival
  autophagic process and the aggressive tumor phenotype. Such events are sustained
  by the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and HO-1, which activate antioxidant response
  systems and promote the upregulation of MMP2 and VEGF.
