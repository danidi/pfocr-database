caption: 'The crosstalk between Panx1 and ligand-gated receptor channels. Top panel:
  Interactions between Panx1 and P2XRs. Activated P2XRs cross-activate Panx1 channels
  probably through the Src family kinases. This leads to potentiation of P2XR signaling.
  Two pathways have been proposed: enhancement of the current (red arrows) and continued
  activation of P2XRs and co-activation of P2YRs, and ARs (black arrows). Opening
  of the Panx1 channel facilitates ATP release, which acts as agonist at P2XRs and
  P2YRs before ectonucleotidases metabolize it into ADP, AMP, and adenosine. ADP also
  acts as natural ligand for some P2YRs, whereas adenosine is natural ligand for ARs.
  P2YRs signals through Gq/11 and Gssignaling pathway, whereas ARs receptors facilitate
  adenylyl cyclase activity through Gs coupling and inhibit this enzyme through Gi/o
  coupling. Both autocrine and paracrine mode of actions were reported. This system
  is operative in many tissues, including the pituitary gland (see ). Bottom panel:
  Interactions between Panx1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channels. Activated
  NMDAR cross-activates Panx1 through the Src family kinases, which in turn potentiate
  the NMDAR signaling, by enhancement of the current (red arrows) and/or through ATP
  released from Panx1 and dephosphorylated to adenosine, which binds to adenosine
  receptors to diminish neuronal excitability (Gi/o coupling) or provides sustained
  NMDR activity, probably through release of glutamate and D-serine (Gs-coupling).
