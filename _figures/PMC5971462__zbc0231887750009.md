caption: Schematic graph of miRNA-involved pathways in the SMC differentiation process
  from MSCs. In MSC to SMC differentiation, upon stimulation of TGFβ1, miR-503 is
  up-regulated in a SMAD4-dependent pathway and directly targets SMAD7, which is a
  negative regulator of the TGFβ1 SMAD-dependent signaling pathway, to promote SMC
  differentiation. The level of miR-222-5p was down-regulated in the differentiation
  process. This results in de-repression of its direct targets ROCK2 and αSMA and
  subsequent promotion of SMC differentiation. Furthermore, the expression of miR-503
  could be inhibited by miR-222-5p.
