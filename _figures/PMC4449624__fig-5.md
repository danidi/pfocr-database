caption: Paradoxical effect of oxidative penthose pathway-derived NADPH as substrate
  for superoxide-generating enzymes in the failing heart. In the presence of NADPH
  oxidase upregulation and uncoupled NOS, NADPH generated by the oxidative penthose
  pathway may paradoxically fuel superoxide production. GP, glutathione peroxidase;
  GR, glutathione reductase; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione;
  NOS, nitric oxide synthase; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
