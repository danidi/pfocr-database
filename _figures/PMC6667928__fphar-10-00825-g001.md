caption: Heme metabolic pathway. Heme oxygenase (HO) catabolizes free heme into biliverdin
  (BV), carbon monoxide (CO) and Fe2+. Biliverdin (BV) is transformed into bilirubin
  (BR) by biliverdin reductase (BVR) enzyme. Fe2+ can be bound by the iron storage
  protein ferritin. The heme molecule provides a multitude of crucial biological functions
  in the form of various apo-heme proteins like hemoglobin, nitric oxide synthase,
  and cytochromes. HO-1-derived metabolite CO could exert anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation,
  anti-apoptosis and vasodilation effects in immune system. Similarly, BR could play
  a key role in anti-inflammation, anti-proliferation, anti-apoptosis, anti-oxidation
  and free radical scavenger. Additionally, iron-induced ferritin could play a cytoprotective,
  anti-oxidative and iron storage effect. Notably, HO-1 and serum BR/BV can be used
  as biomarker for autoimmune diseases. While, the potential of serum ferritin as
  a biomarker in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis
  process needs further verification. Serum ferritin levels are positively correlated
  with disease activity index in SLE and RA patients. In addition, the serum levels
  in patients with SLE and RA are lower than healthy controls and were inversely correlated
  with disease severity. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and experimental autoimmune
  encephalomyelitis (EAE) diseases, the level of HO-1 in lesions rises along the disease
  course, and the induction of HO-1 could improve diseases severity.
