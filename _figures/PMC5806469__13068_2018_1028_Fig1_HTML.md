caption: Putative lignin biosynthesis pathway with identification of species-specific
  reactions. Generic reactions, mainly from studies in the model dicot Arabidopsis
  thaliana, are shown in grey. Other enzymatic reactions are color coded based on
  the plant species where they were documented. Multicolored arrows represent reactions
  present in more than one species. PAL phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, TAL tyrosine
  ammonia-lyase, C4H cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, C3H p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase, C3′H
  p-coumaroyl shikimate 3-hydroxylase, COMT caffeic acid O-methyltransferase, F5H
  ferulate 5-hydroxylase, 4CL 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, HCT hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate
  hydroxycinnamoyl transferase, CCoAOMT caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, CCR cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase, CAD cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, CSE caffeoyl shikimate esterase.
  Interestingly, some monocots, such as Brachypodium and maize, do not have CSE ortholog
  genes. Dashed arrows are currently considered less efficient metabolic reactions
  in vivo
