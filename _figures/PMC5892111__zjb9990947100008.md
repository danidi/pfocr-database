caption: Morphological changes in a Synechocystis culture. During salt stress a change
  in life style occurs, leading planktonic Synechocystis cells to form cell aggregations
  in a biofilm. The conversion of arginine to agmatine, which is the initial step
  in the polyamine synthesis pathway in Synechocystis, is performed by two arginine
  decarboxylases, Adc1 and Adc2. Spermidine contents decline when the biofilm is formed.
