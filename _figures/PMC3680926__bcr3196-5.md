caption: Transrepression of estrogen receptor and NFκB. (a) NFκB can inhibit estrogen
  receptor (ER) in different ways. Activation of Akt can inhibit the activity of forkhead
  box O3 (FOXO3A). This protein has an important role in the synthesis of ER. Consequently,
  blocking FOXO3A activity leads to a reduction in the transcription of ER. Another
  mechanism by which NFκB can inhibit ER is by stimulating enhancer of zeste homolog
  2 (EZH2) activity, which in turn will inhibit ER. Finally, NFκB (RelB) can also
  inhibit ER transcription by upregulating Blimp1. (b) Besides the repression of ER
  by NFκB, ER is also able to repress NFκB. One mechanism to block nuclear translocation
  of NFκB is by increasing the transcription of NFκB subunit p105, which is located
  into the cytosol until it is partially degraded. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway could also lead to accumulation of NFκB in the cytosol.
  A second mechanism by which ER inhibits NFκB activity is by preventing binding of
  the transcription factor to the DNA. In addition, NFκB activity is counteracted
  by the increased interaction with co-repressors and a competition for co-activators
  with ER. E2, estradiol.
