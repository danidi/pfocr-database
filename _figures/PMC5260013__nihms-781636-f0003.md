caption: Classic T cell licensing involves CD154 expressed on activated CD4+ T cells
  ligating CD40 expressed on DC or other APC, resulting in transmission of an activating
  signal into the APC (red arrows represent directionality of signaling). CD154-CD40
  interactions can also occur through ligation of CD154+ CD4+ T cells by CD40-expressing
  CD8+ T cells. There is potentially also a role for CD154 expressed on the surface
  of a CD11c+ DC, binding to CD40 on the surface of an activated CD8+ T cell. Finally,
  CD154 expressed on CD4+ T cells can also interact with CD11b+ monocytes or macrophages.
