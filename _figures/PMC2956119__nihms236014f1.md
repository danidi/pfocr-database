number: Figure 1
caption: 'This figure shows the two distinct but ultimately converging apoptosis signaling
  pathways in mammals. One is activated by so-called ‘death receptors’, members of
  the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family with an intra-cellular ‘death
  domain’ and requires FADD-mediated activation of caspase-8 (shown on the right).
  Auto-processing of caspase-8 results in a hetero-tetrameric form of the protein
  that is able to activate the zymogens of ‘effector’ caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7,
  eventually leading to cleavage of vital proteins within the cell, such as PARP or
  lamins, or activation of the DNAse CAD (caspase-activated DNAse) by cleavage of
  its inhibitor, ICAD (inhibitor of CAD). It is possible that caspase-8 may also proteolyze
  to a certain extent some of the classical substrates of effector caspases. The ‘BCL-2-regulated’
  pathway (shown on the left) is arbitrated by the complex interplay between pro-
  and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family and involves mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). MOMP results in release of cytochrome C
  from the inter-membrane space of the mitochondria into the cytosol to initiate apoptosome
  formation resulting in APAF-1-mediated activation of the ‘initiator’ caspase, caspase-9,
  further leading to proteolytic activation of the downstream ‘effector’ caspases,
  caspase-3 and caspase-7. Abbreviations: BH3-only: BCL-2 homology domain 3 only protein;
  MOMP: mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; Cyt. C: cytochrome C. ICAD:
  Inhibitor of caspase activated DNAse (CAD); PARP: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.'
