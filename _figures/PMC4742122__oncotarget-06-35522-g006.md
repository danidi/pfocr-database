caption: 'A. NDRG1 inhibits Src activity and its downstream signaling pathway. B.
  Line drawings of the structures of potential anti-metastatic agents under development.
  A. NDRG1 expression inhibits c-Src phosphorylation at its activating site (Tyr416).
  This occurs through NDRG1-induced reduction in EGFR expression, abrogation of EGF-mediated
  EGFR activation, and thus preventing the EGFR-c-Src interaction. Moreover, NDRG1
  was shown to suppress Rac1 activity by modulating the phosphorylation of a c-Src
  down-stream effector, namely p130Cas and its association with CrkII, which acts
  as a molecular switch to activate Rac1. B. Line drawings of: Genistein, KISS1-derived
  peptide, etoposide, atrasentan, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4,-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone
  (Dp44mT) and di-2-pyridylketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (DpC).'
