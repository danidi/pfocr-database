caption: Schematic depicting the proposed molecular mechanism by which citrate regulates
  cellular redox signaling pathways in BMSCs. Citrate increases the cellular anti-oxidant
  capacity under oxidative stress conditions via different mechanisms. Citrate may
  serve as a metal iron chelator to prevent reaction of free radicals under physiological
  conditions. Citrate may regulate PPARγ expression. As PPARγ is a central organizer
  of the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant responses, inhibition of this protein
  may disrupt the cellular redox signaling pathways regulated by citrate. Third, citrate
  directly regulates anti-oxidant proteins via a PPARγ independent pathway. The combination
  of all these mechanisms regulates the expression of proteins and increases cellular
  anti-oxidant capacity. PPARγ may be a key molecule in citrate-mediated redox signaling.
