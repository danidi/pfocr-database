caption: Model for two HEB-dependent pathways of γδT17 cell development. Uncommitted
  γδ T-cell precursors (circle on the left) encounter TCR signals that induce them
  to enter Pathway 1 (unboxed) or Pathway 2 (orange box), depending on the strength
  of ERK activity downstream of the TCR signal. Pathway 1 involves upregulation of
  CD73, and is favored by Id3 activity. Pathway 2 proceeds without CD73 upregulation,
  and entry into this pathway is dependent on HEB activity. High ERK signalling leads
  to the upregulation of Id3, which suppresses HEB function and thereby inhibits Pathway
  2. Most cells in Pathway 1 become IFNγ-producing γδT1 cells. In the fetal thymus,
  these are mostly Vγ5+ cells, whereas they are mostly Vγ4+ and Vγ1+ cells in the
  postnatal thymus. A minority of Pathway 1 CD24+CD73+ cells become CD73+ γδT17 cells
  that are RORγt+ and express mostly Vγ4. HEB-deficient cells can take this pathway,
  but the resulting CD73+ RORγt+ cells are severely defective in IL-17 production.
  Pathway 1 generation of γδT17 cells is mostly restricted to the neonatal period.
  Pathway 2 leads to the generation of CD73− RORγt+ γδT17 cells that mostly express
  Vγ6, and this pathway is restricted to fetal and early neonatal life. Pathway 1
  generation of γδT1 cells appears to be independent of HEB. Circles indicate cells
  at distinct developmental stages, arrows indicate developmental progression
