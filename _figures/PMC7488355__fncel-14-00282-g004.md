caption: Potential association between Alcohol Use Disorder and development of Parkinson’s
  disease (PD). Increase in α-synuclein production and nigrostriatal dopaminergic
  neurodegeneration contribute to Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. At early stage
  of AUD, alcohol consumption transiently increases vesicular monoamine transporter
  (VMAT2) activity and dopamine release in nigrostriatal reward pathway. Chronic binge
  alcohol intake exhausts dopamine content and consequently reducing VMAT2 activity
  in striatal neurons (caudate putamen and nucleus). Increased expression of α-synuclein
  in AUD also restricts the release of dopaminergic synaptic vesicles via reduced
  (VMAT2) activity. Chronic alcohol intake causes α-synuclein aggregation, leading
  to formation of Lewy bodies, which eventually results in degeneration of dopaminergic
  neurons at substantia niagra.
