caption: A model for differential sorting of nephrin along endocytic pathways is shown.
  (A) The SD is composed of the backbone nephrin, signaling molecules (e.g., Fyn),
  and scaffold proteins (podocin), all of which reside individually in membrane microdomains.
  (B) Clustering of nephrin induces coalescence of microdomains that in turn leads
  to selective recruitment of the signaling components for its own tyrosine phosphorylation.
  Podocin facilitates the formation of a signaling platform and stabilizes the SD
  complex by linking it to the actin cytoskeleton of foot processes. (C) In the steady
  state, cell surface nephrin comprises two distinct membrane pools of raft and nonraft
  compartments. Most of the raft-resident nephrin molecules are organized into a largely
  immobile lipid–protein supercomplex in a dephosphorylated form, and they turn over
  at a slow rate in the foot processes. Clathrin-mediated machinery captures the membrane
  compartments spatially at random, irrespective of their raft association, and internalizes
  them quickly at a constant rate. β-Arrestin 2 preferentially binds to the nonraft,
  dephosphorylated nephrin form and directs it toward the CME pathway. This pathway
  ensures fast and continuous replacement of surface nephrin from a reservoir of its
  intracellular vesicles, thereby maintaining its steady-state surface expression
  level. Conversely, the nephrin residing within the functional signaling platform
  is internalized via a distinct, raft-enriched endocytic structure that traffics
  at a slower rate (the RME pathway). This pathway specifically internalizes the signal-activated
  domains containing phosphorylated nephrin, which in turn removes the signaling microdomains
  from the cell surface (in a “shut-off” feedback loop). The RME therefore enables
  a finely tuned, spatiotemporal sequestering of the SD complex by minimizing unnecessary
  breakdown of the signaling platforms. Such cooperation between signaling and endocytosis
  is particularly important when podocytes assemble a new SD complex (e.g., during
  development and the remodeling processes that follow injury).
