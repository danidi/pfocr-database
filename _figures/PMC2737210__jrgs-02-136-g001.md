caption: 'The classical RNAi and miRNA pathways: Long dsRNAs [and short hairpin RNA
  (shRNA)] are processed by Dicer to give siRNAs. The duplexed siRNAs are unwound
  as they assemble to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The single-stranded
  siRNA guides the endonuclease activity of the activated RISC to the homologous site
  on the mRNA, cleaving the mRNA. In miRNA pathway: The pre-miRNA is expressed in
  the nucleus from endogenous long transcripts and is processed into ∼70-nt hairpins
  by the RNase III family member Drosha to become the pre-miRNA. The pre-miRNA is
  exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 and is further cleaved by Dicer into the
  mature miRNA. The miRNA is loaded into RISC where it guides the protein complex
  to a site on the mRNA that has only partial sequence complementarity to the miRNA,
  leading to repression of translation.'
