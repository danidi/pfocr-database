caption: Systems-level regulation of metabolic genes by Met TFs. The schematic represents
  an overview of yeast metabolism. Genes are first colored according to their promoter
  type. A promoter can contain a Cbf1p motif (blue), a Met31p/Met32p motif (green),
  joint (red), or neither (no color). Motifs were mapped to promoters using the MAST
  algorithm. Second, genes that have expression changes in response to several different
  perturbations are marked with colored boxes. Significant responses to Met4p or Cbf1p
  induction are marked in red and orange, respectively, and significant differences
  between met31∆met32∆/control or cbf1∆/control experiments are marked in purple and
  cyan, respectively. Finally, significant differences in expression in response to
  induction of Met31p and Met32p are marked in brown. Significance was determined
  using linear regression and template matching as described in Materials and Methods.
  Genes repressed by Met4p are marked with an asterisk. While MET6 is a joint target,
  it is deleted in all strains (marked by a dagger). In addition, SUL1 and PDC6 are
  marked with a dagger because MAST did not detect a Cbf1p-binding site in the promoter
  of either gene. However, it was previously shown that the promoters of these genes
  each contain a noncanonical Cbf1p-binding site ().
