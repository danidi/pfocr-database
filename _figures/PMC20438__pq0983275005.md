caption: Schematic diagram of possible Rad6-mediated metabolic pathways. Rad6 forms
  distinct complexes with either Ubr1 or Rad18; the Rad6–Rad18 complex is proposed
  to be responsible for DNA repair (–). The DNA repair component consists of an N-terminal-dependent
  error-free PRR pathway and an N-terminal-independent error-prone mutagenesis pathway.
  Mms2, PCNA, Polδ, and Rad30 are proposed to participate in the error-free PRR, whereas
  Rev1, -3, and -7 are responsible for mutagenesis.
