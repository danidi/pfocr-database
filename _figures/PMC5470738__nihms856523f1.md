caption: Several hepatic receptors are involved in Lp(a) catabolism. The plasminogen
  receptor PlgRKT is responsible for a futile cycle of Lp(a) and apo(a) uptake in
  Rab5 early endosomes with subsequent apo(a) recycling via Rab11 recycling endosomes.
  The secreted apo(a) can re-associate with newly-formed or circulating LDL to generate
  new Lp(a). LDLR and LRP1 are PCSK9-sensitive clearance receptors for which Lp(a)
  needs to compete with apoE-bearing TRLs, a process influenced by the apoE genotype.
  Uptake via this clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway will lead to lysosomal degradation
  of the Lp(a)-lipid moiety (i.e. LDL) and associated apo(a). Finally, other receptors
  such as SR-BI have been implicated and result in lysosomal degradation of the whole
  particle or the lipid content.
