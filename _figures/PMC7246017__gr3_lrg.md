caption: 'Complement activation and vasculopathy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) on endothelial cells and activates the complement lectin pathway
  first and then the classical pathway, leading to complement (C) 3b deposition. C3b
  formation fuels the alternative pathway and participates in the formation of the
  C5 convertases that cleave C5 into the terminal complement products C5a and C5b-9
  (upper box). The terminal complement components promote vascular inflammation through
  multiple processes: the anaphylatoxin C5a recruits neutrophils (polymorphonuclear
  neutrophils [PMN]) and monocyte/macrophages. C5b-9 and C5a induce the release of
  interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) by endothelial cells
  and stimulates the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, E-selectin, VCAM-1)
  that favor recruitment, adhesion, and transendothelial migration of neutrophils
  and macrophages. Thereafter, infiltrating leukocytes release proteases, cytokines,
  and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contribute to inflammation, subendothelial
  matrix disruption, and remodeling, causing vasculitis-like lesions. C5a and the
  membrane attack complex (MAC) also induce the exocytosis of P-selectin and von Willebrand
  factor (VWF) multimers from endothelial cells that promote platelet adhesion, and
  the shedding of thrombomodulin (TM) from the endothelial cell surface, which triggers
  the coagulation cascade. Finally, C5b-9 directly activates platelets, causing platelet
  aggregation and the release of procoagulant microparticles (PMP). The results of
  all these events are vascular injury and dysfunction, with extensive formation of
  blood clots.'
