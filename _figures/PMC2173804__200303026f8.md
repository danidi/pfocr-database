caption: Regulation of bim gene expression by NGF in sympathetic neurons. FOXO transcriptional
  activity is inhibited by NGF via PI3-K signaling and Akt/SGK-mediated phosphorylation.
  NGF withdrawal and LY294002 inhibit PI3-K signaling, resulting in FOXO activation
  and subsequent activation of the bim promoter via the bim1 and bim2 FOXO binding
  sites. The JNK pathway is repressed in the presence of NGF. PI3-K signaling could
  account for some of this repression via Akt-mediated inhibition of MLK activity
  but PI3-K–independent pathways may also be involved. NGF withdrawal and LY294002
  activate the JNK pathway via mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), resulting in c-Jun activation.
  Dominant-negative c-Jun (DN c-Jun) can partially inhibit BIM induction after NGF
  withdrawal, which suggests that c-Jun/AP-1 may also directly regulate the bim promoter.
  Furthermore, our results do not rule out the possibility that other transcription
  factors/signaling pathways might also be involved in regulation of bim promoter
  activity or that NGF might regulate BIM expression post transcriptionally.
