caption: The transcriptome of genes encoding enzymes and proteins on the lactose synthesis
  pathway, including GLUT1, HK1, PGM1, UGP2, GALE, GALT, SLC35A2, LALBA, and β4-GALT1,
  -3, and -5. The transcriptome of enzymes required for the interconversion of glucose
  to UDP-galactose was upregulated (P < 0.01). The highest transcriptomes in abundance,
  fold changes, and correlation coefficients with lactose synthesis are UGP2, PGM1,
  and SLC35A2. GLUT1 was increased only 1.5-fold after day 7. HK1 was downregulated.
  Only β4-GALT3 was upregulated, whereas LALBA expression was initially high and did
  not change.
