caption: Mutations in the BCS1L assembly factor cause severe complex III enzyme deficiency,
  which hampers oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. A metabolic switch towards glycolysis
  and protein catabolism probably occurs in an attempt to maintain the intracellular
  ATP levels, increasing the ATP productive phase of glycolysis (1, 2 and 3) and decreasing
  the pyruvate dehydrogenase and Krebs cycle activities (4, 5). These events would
  lead to the accumulation of intermediate metabolites and amino acids (5, 6). A blockage
  of the pentose phosphate pathway (7, 8) could also be inferred, which would affect
  the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines and therefore nucleic / ribonucleic acids
  formation, resulting in an increased AMP/ATP ratio (9, 10). The detoxifying glutathione
  metabolism would also be affected, which would amplify ROS damage (11). Eventually,
  the degradation of extracellular matrix components could take place as an alternative
  way to obtain energy (12), as well as alterations in the iron homeostasis (13) and
  the breakdown of the cytoskeleton architecture (14). These events could lead to
  alterations in the regulation of gene expression (15, 16 and 17), in intracellular
  trafficking and signal transduction mechanisms (18), as well as provoke a raise
  in the cellular responses to the oxidative and metabolic stress (19). Proteins whose
  levels were increased in the BCS1L mutant fibroblasts compared to the controls are
  indicated in red, and those whose levels were decreased are shown in green. Abbreviations
  are in accordance with the gene identity of proteins listed in .
