caption: Outline of two potential mechanisms of Spt20 in C. albicans response to osmotic
  stress. Previous work found that when cells are subjected to high osmolarity, Hog1
  is activated and bind to osmostress promoters, then recruits SAGA complex components
  to induce expression of Hog1-dependent osmostress response genes and genes involved
  in glycerol accumulation. In our study, we found that Spt20 regulates the phosphorylation
  of Hog1 in response to osmotic stress.
