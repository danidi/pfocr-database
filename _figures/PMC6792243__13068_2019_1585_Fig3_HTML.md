caption: 'Genetically encoded biosensors and their applications in lignin valorization:
  a functional metagenomic screening method based on an EmrR-based biosensor for identifying
  lignin-degrading and transforming enzymes from metagenomic samples. A multicopper
  oxidase (CopA) enzyme capable of degrading lignin to vanillin and syringaldehyde
  was identified from a recovered metagenomic fosmid DNA library using this system
  []. b Transcriptional biosensors as screening methods to allow enzymatic characterization
  and evolution. A FerC-based biosensor was applied to identify optimal feruloyl esterase
  (CE1) activity by detecting ferulic acid release []. c Dynamic pathway regulation
  system for vanillic acid production. A ferulic acid biosensor was utilized to activate
  and regulate the biosynthetic pathway only when high cell density was reached and
  enough substrate was present, diminishing metabolic stress and increasing productivity
