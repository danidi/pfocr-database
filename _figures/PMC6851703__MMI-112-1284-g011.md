caption: Metabolic network utilised for assimilation of lactate and pyruvate in Mtb.
  The scheme illustrates the pathways identified in this study that Mtb employs to
  metabolise lactate and pyruvate; gluconeogenesis (green), Krebs cycle (brown), glyoxylate
  shunt (violet), methylcitrate pathway (orange), GABA shunt (light blue) and a novel
  uncharacterised pathway, which includes MmsA enzyme, to synthesise propionyl‐CoA
  (grey). Bold arrows are used to underline the main pathways. The enzymes involved
  in lactate and pyruvate metabolism which were identified in this study are highlighted
  with the colours of the respective pathways they belong to.
