caption: Outline of pathways involved in nitrogen regulation in S. cerevisiae. (A)
  Pathway of the SPS sensor system mediated by sensing of external amino acids. Ssy1
  is activated by external amino acids. The signal is transduced by Ptr3 and activates
  Ssy5. The activated Ssy5 is responsible for activating two transcriptional factors,
  Stp1 and Stp2. Finally, Stp1 and Stp2 activate the transcription of relevant genes.
  (B) Pathway of TOR pathway mediated by sensing of internal amino acids. The accumulation
  of internal amino acids promotes the establishment of the EGOC and decreases the
  internal abundance of tRNAs. As a result, TORC1 is activated by the EGOC and derepressed
  by the reduction of internal tRNAs. Next, the downstream effectors Sch9 and Tap42
  are activation by activated TORC1. Finally, the phosphorylation of regulators, such
  as Gln3, Gat1, and Gcn2, is induced by Sch9. In addition, activated Tap42 promotes
  its interaction with PP2A, which represses the PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of
  regulators. (C) Transcriptional regulatory pathway mediated by NCR. The major activators
  of NCR, Gln3 and Gat1, are phosphorylated in the presence of preferred nitrogen
  sources. As a result, the transcriptional activation mediated by these two activators
  is repressed. (D) Regulation of the GAAC pathway responds to nitrogen sources. Gcn2
  is activated under nitrogen repletion conditions, which then represses the transformation
  of eIF2α from a GDP- to a GTP-bound status. The reduction of eIF2α-GTP decreases
  the TC, which then inhibits the formation of the PIC. As a result, the translation
  of GCN4 mRNA is repressed, leading to a decreased intracellular concentration of
  Gcn4. On the other hand, nitrogen repletion conditions also induce the degradation
  of the Gcn4 through activation of Srb10. In addition, nitrogen repletion also induces
  the activation of Pcl5, which then activates Pho85 and finally induces the degradation
  of Gcn4. The decrease of Gcn4 finally represses the transcriptional activation of
  relevant genes dependent on Gcn4.

    The accumulation of internal amino acids promotes the establishment of the EGOC
