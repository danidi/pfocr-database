caption: A schematic illustration of the interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 pathway. IL-12
  and IL-23 are released from macrophages and dendritic cells. IL-12 via coupling
  of IL-12p40 with IL-12Rβ1, and IL-12p35 with IL-12Rβ2, induces activation of Janus
  kinase 2 (JAK2) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). This leads to activation of signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4, which is essential for induction
  of interferon (IFN)-γ and T-helper (Th) 1 differentiation. Naive T cells lack IL-23
  receptor (IL-23R). Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and IL-6 induce expression
  of retinoic acid receptor–related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt), which, along with
  STAT3, promotes expression of IL-23R. Th17 cells induced by TGF-β and IL-6 are not
  mature; thus, exposure to IL-23 is required to promote their pathogenicity. Binding
  of IL-23 to its receptor activates JAK2 and TYK2, leading to STAT3 and STAT4 formation.
