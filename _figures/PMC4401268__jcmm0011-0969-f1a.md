caption: 'Dual role of Cav-1 Y14 phosphorylation: phosphorylat-ed caveolin (pYCav-1)
  is involved in the control of integrin-mediated signal transduction and caveolae-mediated
  cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains (CEMM) endocy-tosis. In adherent cells
  (A), pYCav-1 is retained mainly at focal adhesions and its concentration at caveolae
  is low. In focal adhesions (FA), pYCav-1 is involved in controlling cell polarity
  and directional migration. We propose a model in which pYCav-1 regulates Src activity
  by recruiting C–terminal Src kinase (Csk) to FA; Csk inhibits Src by phosphorylation
  and this modulates Src-dependent inactivation of Rho through p190RhoGAP. Moreover,
  integrin activation targets Rac and other proteins to caveolae/CEMMs, allowing interaction
  with effector molecules. In the case of Rac, integrins increase the affinity for
  Rac by modulating CEMMs, thus displacing Rac from its cytosolic ligand, Rho-GDI
  (magnification in A). This process may be controlled directly by integrins or by
  an unknown pathway that regulates the localization of pYCav-1 at focal adhesions,
  preventing CEMM internalization. The presence of CEMMs in the plasma membrane allows
  the activation of multiple signalling pathways. When integrin signalling is interrupted,
  as in suspended cells or at areas of the cell that transiently detach from the substrate
  (B), CEMMs are endocytosed by a mechanism involving pYCav-1 translocation to caveolae.
  This process uncouples many signalling intermediates from their effectors, thereby
  shutting down associated signalling pathways.'
