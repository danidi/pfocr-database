caption: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and autophagy (adapted with permission from Ventham et
  al, Gastroenterology). This diagram summarises the influence of miRNAs within different
  components of autophagy. Altered sequence in the immunity related GTPase family
  M protein (IRGM) gene results in an impaired binding site for miR-196. The consequent
  reduction in miR-196 activity results in IRGM upregulation and causes ineffective
  bacterial clearance of adherent invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) in the intestinal
  cells of patients with Crohn's disease. ATG16L1 has also been shown to be a target
  of a host of miRNAs. miR-106B and miR-93 repress ATG16L1 mRNA translation, thereby
  disrupting the autophagy pathway and bacterial clearance of AIEC. miR-30C and miR-130A
  have also been shown to directly target ATG16L1 and ATG5. Similarly, miR-142-3p
  has also been shown to negatively regulate ATG16L1 and autophagy. Finally, NOD2
  has been shown to induce the expression of miR-29 to limit IL-23 release, indirectly
  influencing the Th17 pathway in human dendritic cell lines. Polymorphisms in NOD2
  impair the ability to express miR-29 resulting in exaggerated IL-23 induced inflammation.
  Recently, a set of miRNAs that directly target NOD2 expression, miR-192, miR-495,
  miR-512 and miR-671 have also been described albeit in a different cell line (colonic
  epithelial HCT116 cells).
