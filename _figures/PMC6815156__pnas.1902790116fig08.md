caption: Proposed model for p75NTRsignaling on the plasma membrane. (A) Model of the
  membrane partitioning undergone by wt p75NTR (Left, green) or mut p75NTR (Right,
  green) upon NGF (orange) binding. Cholesterol-rich, signaling-competent regions
  are represented with increased membrane thickness and containing cholesterol and
  gangliosides. Partitioning is highlighted by the arrows in opposite directions.
  (B) Model of p75NTRsignaling at the membrane and downstream internalization. Signaling
  can occur from cholesterol-poor or cholesterol-rich membrane regions, resulting
  in receptor internalization within clathrin-positive (green) or caveolin-positive
  (red) endosomes. In our model, interactors of surface-retained p75NTR (magenta),
  involved in actin remodeling and growth cone collapse, are more abundant in nonraft
  regions as this pathway is not impaired by the mutations introduced in mut p75NTR.
  Conversely, apoptotic signaling effectors (light and dark blue) are enriched in
  raft platforms being efficiently activated only by NGF-bound wt p75NTR. Different
  from mature NTs, proNTs at the growth cones cause surface accumulation of p75NTR,
  which could arise from internalization inhibition (as for Dynasore and Pitstop2
  treatments or expression of the dominant negative K44A dynamin) or by increased
  receptor recycling at the membrane.
