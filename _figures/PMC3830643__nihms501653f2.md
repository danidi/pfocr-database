caption: A, T. gondii is shown as a representative apicomplexan parasite (pink) and
  intracellular pathogen capable of fatty acid and lipid salvage from the host cell
  (blue). This process can intersect host cell import as well as synthesis routes.
  B, In addition, the parasite harbors three fatty acid synthesis pathways that are
  localized to different cellular compartments. C, Apicoplast (green)-localized FASII
  pathway produces significant amounts of myristic and palmitic acid, in addition
  to lipoic acid relying on cytoplasmic glycolysis for precursors. E, Apicomplexan
  parasites also maintain an ER-associated elongase system that synthesizes very long
  chain monounsaturated fatty acids, subsequently using the activity of ELO-B and
  ELO-C. D, Apicomplexan FASI remains largely uncharacterized. Its stage-specific
  expression pattern and localization are not established. It is also unclear whether
  this megasynthase synthesizes fatty acids de novo, like the FASI of humans, or acts
  as an elongase for saturated fatty acids, as demonstrated for FASI of C. parvum.Major
