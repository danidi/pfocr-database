caption: Known gene regulation mechanisms mediated by the PIWI–piRNA pathway. PIWI
  proteins and piRNAs regulate the expression of genes and transposon at both transcriptional

  to the cytoplasm and processed by the primary biogenesis pathway to generate mature
  sense piRNAs that associate with PIWI proteins. (3) The PIWI–antisense piRNA complexes
  mediate cleavage of sense piRNA precursors and transposon (and protein-coding) transcripts,
  which silences transposon and gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.

  piRNA binding. The PIWI–sense piRNA complexes then cleave antisense piRNA precursor
  transcripts to amplify the piRNA biogenesis cycle [,]. (4) The PIWI–piRNA complexes
