caption: Molecular mechanisms linking insulin resistance with neurodegeneration. Obesity
  is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which impacts all tissues and
  organs. Inflammatory cytokines bind to their receptors (1) activating the nuclear
  factor-kappaB (NF-κB/IκBα) pathway, which stimulates a proinflammatory condition
  (2). Nutrient imbalance may also activate inflammatory pathways and DNA damage,
  adversely impacting redox regulation (via glutathione peroxidase (GPx); glutathione
  (GSH); and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) levels) and so promoting oxidative stress
  (3). β-cell metabolism and ATP production are affected by nutrient imbalance via
  glycolytic dysfunction and reduced activation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH) reducing pyruvate (PYR) generation but promoting β-oxidation (4). As a result
  of the metabolic dysfunction, superoxide and subsequently hydrogen peroxide generation
  (which can combine with nitric oxide, NO, to create peroxynitrite, an example of
  RNS) may occur due to compromised mitochondrial electron transport chain, ETC, and
  action, and so reducing ATP synthesis (5). All these processes impact endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress, leading to a reduction in the ability to secrete insulin
  (6). High circulating levels of lipids and glucose and chronic inflammation increase
  amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation, which together with low insulin reduce the transport
  and utilisation of glucose in the brain (7) via impairment in insulin signalling
  (8), including the negative regulator of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Activated
  GSK3 is associated with tau hyperphosphorylation (9). The vicious cycle mediated
  by ROS/RNS and Aβ may eventually result in enzyme inhibition (e.g., alpha-enolase
  (ENO1), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), ATP synthase, and GAPDH), lowering ATP generation,
  which together with tau promotes neuronal loss (10). Protein kinase B (AKT); fructose
