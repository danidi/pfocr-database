caption: The classical l-arginine-NOS-NO signaling pathway. NO is produced in mammalian
  cells by an oxygen-dependent oxidation of a guanidine nitrogen of l-arginine (with
  citrulline as a side product). This multistep reaction is catalyzed by the heme-containing
  protein NOS, which also requires two flavin molecules and tetrahydrobiopterin as
  cofactors. In most endothelial cells, the type III isoform is expressed (or eNOS)
  as is regulated by calcium-dependent binding of calmodulin and by tyrosine phosphorylation.
  Target tissue effects of NO depend on its quantity. At higher concentrations, NO
  rapidly reacts with oxygen (and especially with superoxide), forming the highly
  reactive peroxynitrite. At lower concentrations, NO serves a regulatory role via
  the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, resulting in increased cGMP levels
  in target cells. In vascular smooth muscle, cGMP causes relaxation by reducing the
  intracellular calcium concentration and by downregulating the contractile apparatus.
  These actions are mostly (although not exclusively) mediated by type I cGMP-dependent
  protein kinases. cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; eNOS, endothelial NOS; NO,
  nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase. (To see this illustration in color, the
  reader is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertpub.com/ars.)
