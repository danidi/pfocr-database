caption: Model of light-signaling control of translation. Translation of several chloroplast
  mRNAs is regulated in response to light via at least two major pathways. In the
  first, the reduced PQ pool activates a signal-transduction pathway that leads to
  the priming of the translational factors required for thiol-mediated modulation
  of translation. In the second, a thiol-mediated signal, proportional to the reducing
  potential generated by PS I, is transduced by Fd, Fd–thioredoxin reductase (FTR),
  and thioredoxin (Trx) to stimulate translation. DCMU binds to the QB site of PS
  II, resulting in oxidation of the PQ pool. DBMIB inhibits cytochrome b6f (Cyt bf),
  leading to increased reduction of the PQ pool. DCPIP is an artificial electron donor
  of PS I that can be used to allow electron transport through PS I under conditions
  of inhibited PS II to I electron transport.
