caption: '(A) In red: the rod bipolar (RB) pathway. Rods make synapses onto RBs (Ai),
  which make synapses onto AIIs (Aii). AIIs make glycinergic synapses (Aiii) onto
  the terminals of some OFF cone bipolar (CB) cells and onto the dendrites of some
  OFF ganglion cells (GCs). AIIs are coupled by electrical synapses to the terminals
  of ON CBs, which make glutamatergic synapses onto ON GCs (Av). The AMPAR antagonist
  DNQX blocks transmission from RBs to AIIs (Aii).(B) In blue: rods are coupled electrically
  to cones by gap junctions (Bi), and cones make synapses onto ON and OFF CBs (Bii).
  Depolarization of the ON CB by the cone not only drives glutamatergic transmission
  to ON GCs (Biii); it also depolarizes AIIs via the electrical synapse (Biv) and
  thereby elicits glycinergic transmission to OFF GCs and, perhaps, OFF CBs (Bv).
  Signaling from cones to OFF GCs via the AII (Bi→Bii→Biv→Bv) is preserved in the
  presence of DNQX. OFF CBs make glutamatergic synapses onto OFF GCs (Bvi). (C) In
  green: rods make direct chemical synapses onto some types of OFF CB (Ci), which
  in turn contact OFF GCs (Cii). Transmission through this pathway is blocked by DNQX.'
