caption: Leptin signaling. Binding of leptin results in the cross-linking of two adjacent
  receptors and the recruitment of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2), which cross-phosphorylates
  each other. Activated JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor allowing
  the docking of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). JAKs
  phosphorylate STAT3, which then dissociate and dimerize. STAT3 dimers translocate
  to the nucleus where they upregulate the expression of anorexigenic protein pro-opiomelanocortin
  (POMC) and suppressing that of the orexigenic protein Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)
  mediating the regulation of energy expenditure, control of body weight and suppresses
  appetite. The negative regulatory actions of PTP1B on leptin signaling pathway are
  indicated.
