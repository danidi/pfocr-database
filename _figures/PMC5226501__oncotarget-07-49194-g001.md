caption: The upstream activators of MST1/2 are not defined although cell–cell contact
  probably is an important stimulus. RASSF family proteins could link MST1/2 to extracellular
  signals facilitating their activation before the proteolytic cleavage. Indeed, most
  catalytically active MST1/2 in the liver are in a truncated form that lacks the
  autoregulatory carboxy-terminus. Mst1/2 are required to phosphorylate MOB1. Phospho-MOB1
  is likely to facilitate the activation of an intermediary kinase, which phosphorylates
  YAP. YAP phosphorylation at ser127 allows 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic sequestration.
  Subsequent phosphorylation of YAP-ser127 at ser381 by LATS1/2 followed by phosphorylation
  at ser384 and ser387 by CK1δε allows ubiquitinylation and degradation. The phosphorylation
  of YAP at tyr357 promotes nuclear translocation and binding to the oncosuppressor
  p73. Nuclear migration of not phosphorylated YAP protein is followed by the formation
  of YAP/TEAD complex that enhances cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis.
