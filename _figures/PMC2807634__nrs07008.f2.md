caption: Progestins bind to cytoplasmic PR/ER complexes, and activate the Src/Ras/Erk
  pathway, leading to nuclear accumulation of activated Erk. Most of PR is nuclear
  and complexed to chaperones (Hsps). Upon binding of progestins, PR homodimers dissociate
  from chaperones and a fraction of PR is phosphorylated by pErk, which also phosphorylates
  Msk1. A “PR -activated complex” composed of pPR/pErk/pMsk1 is formed.
