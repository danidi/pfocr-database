caption: Transcription by RNA pol II leads to capped and polyadenylated pri-miRNAs
  which are processed by Drosha in the nucleus to generate pre-miRNAs. After translocation
  to the cytoplasm by exportin 5, pre-miRNAs are processed by Dicer to form the mature
  miRNA/miRNA* duplex. Following processing, miRNAs are assembled into the RISC complex.
  Only one strand of the duplex is stably associated with the RISC complex. The mature
  miRNA directs repression of mRNA containing partially complementary miRNA binding
  sites within the 3′UTR.
