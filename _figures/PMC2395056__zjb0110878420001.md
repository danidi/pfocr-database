caption: Model of peptidoglycan recycling in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. As the bacterial
  cell grows and divides, the sacculus is remodeled by peptidoglycanases including
  lytic transglycosylases LtgA and LtgD and amidase AmiC. The liberated PG fragments
  include 1,6-anhydro PG monomers and free disaccharide. The gonococcal genome was
  found to encode homologues of multiple PG recycling proteins, and their predicted
  functions are shown here. PG fragments are taken into the cytoplasm through the
  AmpG permease to be further degraded by a carboxypeptidase (LdcA), an N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine
  amidase (AmpD), and an N-acetylglucosaminidase (NagZ). The order in which these
  reactions occur in gonococci is not known. The resulting tripeptide is incorporated
  within the PG biosynthetic pathway leading to UDP-pentapeptide monomers for incorporation
  into the growing sacculus. The symbols used to represent amino acids and sugar residues
  were chosen to mirror those used by Jacobs et al. ().
