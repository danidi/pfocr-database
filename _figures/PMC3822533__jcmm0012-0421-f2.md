caption: The MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway. In the ER lumen, newly
  synthesized MHC-I heavy chains (HC) assemble with β2m. The interaction with the
  peptide loading complex (calreticulin, Erp57, tapasin and TAP) promotes peptide
  loading onto MHC-I molecules. The peptides are derived from endogenous antigens
  (including viral-derived proteins, represented in red), which are degraded by the
  proteasome into short peptides and transported into the ER lumen by TAP. The peptide
  loaded MHC-I complexes proceed to the cell surface via the standard secretory pathway,
  for presentation to CD8+ T lymphocytes. CNX, calnexin; Crt, calreticulin; TPN, tapasin;
  DRiPs, defective ribosomal products; TCR, T-cell receptor.
