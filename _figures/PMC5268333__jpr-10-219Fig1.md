caption: 'Overview of neuropathies affecting pain pathways.Notes: C and Aδ fibers
  are affected by diabetes, drugs, and alcohol (and its metabolite acetaldehyde),
  whereas large, myelinated Aα and Aβ fibers are affected by drugs and thiamine deficiency.
  Channels (sodium, calcium) and receptors (NMDA, serotonin, adrenergic, opioid) along
  the pain pathway serve as drug targets for treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.Abbreviations:
  NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid; TRP, transient receptor potential; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide.'
