caption: 'A The metabolic pathway showing two axes of RAS system: (1) “Classical RAS
  ACE–Ang II–AT1 regulatory axis” and (2) “ACE2–Ang–(1–7)–Mas counter-regulatory axis.”
  Abbreviations: (P) RR, (pro) renin receptor; Ang, angiotensin; ACE, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; NEP, neutral endopeptidase; PEP,
  prolyl endopeptidase; PCP, prolyl carboxypeptidase []. B Structure of S CTD—human
  ACE2 Complex: The core subdomain and external subdomain in SARS-CoV-2-CTD are colored
  cyan and orange, respectively. hACE2 subdomains I and II are colored violet and
  green, respectively. The right panel was obtained by anticlockwise rotation of the
  left panel along a longitudinal axis [PDB:6LZG]. Courtesy Wang et al. []'
