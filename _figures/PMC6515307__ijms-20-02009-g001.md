caption: Mechanisms contributing to regulation of tumor clearance by effector cells.
  APC, antigen presenting cell. In this context, an APC may be a macrophage, dendritic
  cell (or Langerhans cell) or B cell. Regulatory cells may represent various populations,
  including Treg, B cell regulatory populations, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells
  (MDSCs). Effector cell relates predominantly to CD8+ T cells, but may also include
  natural killer (NK), natural killer T (NKT), gamma-delta T, and cytotoxic CD4+ T
  cells. The above mechanisms contribute to effector, particularly CD8+, cell dysfunction
  and lead to a failure of tumor clearance. Those mechanisms highlighted in blue represent
  mechanisms of immune escape for the tumor. Examples of relevant mediators for each
  pathway are provided in brackets. Solid arrows represent mechanisms directed against
  specific cells through cell contact, whilst dashed arrows represent nonspecific
  mechanisms through remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME).
