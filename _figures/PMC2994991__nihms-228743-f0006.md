caption: Reporter gene assay for HIF-1 activity. During normoxia, the HIF-1α subunit
  is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. In this case, the absence of ß-lactamase
  expression leaves the fluorescent substrate molecule, which contains coumarin and
  fluorescein. Excitation of the coumarin results in fluorescence resonant energy
  transfer to the fluorescein moiety, resulting in the emission of green fluorescent
  signal (530 nm). However, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α heterodimerizes with
  the HIF-1ß subunit and translocates to the nucleus. Next, the HIF-1 complex binds
  to HRE regulatory sequences upstream of target genes. In this assay, stimulation
  under hypoxic conditions results in the transcription of ß-lactamase, which cleaves
  the fluorescent substrate molecule, disrupting energy transfer. Excitation of the
  coumarin molecule in the presence of ß-lactamase enzyme activity results in a blue
  fluorescence signal (460 nm). The ratio of the blue:green signals provides a normalized
  reporter response.
