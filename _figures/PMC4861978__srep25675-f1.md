caption: 'The n-butanol biosynthesis pathway via threonine was relocalized in cytoplasm
  (A) or mitochondria (B). Single and double arrows represent single and multiple
  enzymatic steps respectively. The broken line indicates the transport of chemicals
  between mitochondria and cytosol. Relocalized reactions in (B) were highlighted
  with red. The information on the biochemical pathways and enzyme locations was from
  previous literature. L-aspartyl-4-P: 4-phospho-L-aspartate; Homoserine-P: O-phospho-L-homoserine;
  KDCs: keto-acid decarboxylases; ADHs: alcohol dehydrogenases.'
