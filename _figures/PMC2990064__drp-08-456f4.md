caption: Signaling pathway of checkpoint control and IR-induced perturbation (The
  antagonism reaction governing G1/S checkpoint in the model takes place between CycE
  and Rb and the antagonism reaction governing G2/M checkpoint takes place between
  CycB and Wee1. P27 and Cdc25 contribute to the two checkpoint transitions, respectively.
  To describe the perturbation caused by IR, IR first induces double strand break
  (DSB), then DSB activates ATM by autophosphorylation. Phosphorylated ATM (ATMp)
  has repair function to DSB and it can also phosphorylate and activate the transcriptional
  factor p53. Activated p53p then transcriptionally activates p21, GADD45 and 1433
  sigma. These are the genes that repress G1/S and G2/M transitions. p53 dependent
  signaling also mediates the entry into the apoptotic pathway through regulation
  of Bax and Bcl-2. Bax is pro-apoptotic and is transcriptionally activated by p53.
  Bcl-2 is anti-apoptotic and is transcriptionally repressed by p53. Both Bax and
  Bcl-2 signal to caspases, which are proteases at the core of the apoptotic machinery).
