caption: HFD-induced accumulation of RIP140 in the cytoplasm and the biological activities
  of cytoplasmic RIP140 in adipocytes. HFD-feeding elevates circulating ET-1 and DAG
  levels. Increase in ET-1 and intracellular DAG activates PKCe, initiating the signaling
  pathway to stimulate nuclear export of RIP140. In the cytoplasm, RIP140 can interact
  with AS160 to block the traffic of GLUT4 and adiponectin vesicles. Cytoplasmic RIP140
  can also interact with perilipin on the surface of lipid droplets to increase lipolysis.
  Ambrisentan blocks ET-1 signal to reduce RIP140’s accumulation in the cytoplasm,
  thereby lessening the severity of HFD-induced metabolic diseases.
