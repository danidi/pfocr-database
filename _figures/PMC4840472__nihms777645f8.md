caption: (a) During corticostriatal pathway activation glutamate is released into
  the synaptic cleft. Astrocytes surrounding the synaptic cleft take up glutamate,
  which stimulates lactate and ascorbic acid release from these cells. Neuronal cells
  uptake ascorbic acid via the neuronal ascorbic acid transporter, SVCT2. Intracellular
  ascorbic acid is utilised to maintain the redox balance within neurons. Synaptic
  activity produces ROS that are reduced by ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid also inhibits
  glucose uptake via specific GLUT3 inhibition and stimulates lactate transport. (b)
  Ascorbic acid release from astrocytes and ascorbic acid uptake is impaired in HD,
  promoting a decrease in neuronal intracellular ascorbic acid concentration and redox
  imbalance. Ascorbic acid is sequestered to act more as an antioxidant molecule than
  a metabolic modulator. Decreased GLUT3 expression at the plasma membrane in HD cells
  contributes to metabolic failure.
