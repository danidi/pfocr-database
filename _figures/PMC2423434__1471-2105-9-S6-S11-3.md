caption: Class hierarchy for controlled vocabularies of DIO. Classes prefixed with
  "fma:" were references for the classes defined in the FMA. The class hierarchy was
  stored in "dio_event.owl". According to BFO, the controlled vocabulary was divided
  into two parts; process (e.g. events) and continuants (e.g. things). (This figure
  was generated using ontoviz plug-in of Protege with manual changes.).
