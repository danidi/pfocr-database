caption: A working model for auxin control of the interdigitated pattern of plant
  PCs. (A) PCs highlighted to show lobes and indentations. The additional white arrows
  indicate lobes. (B) Schematic view of the coordination of two mutually exclusive
  ROP signalling pathways by both auxin and cytokinin signalling on the basis of known
  components, including ABP1, TMK, ROP2, ROP6, PIN1, RIC4, RIC1, KTN1, CRE1/AHK3,
  and ARR20. (C) A model for auxin- and cytokinin-based integrated control of interdigitated
  pattern through both inter- and intracellular coordination of the ROP2 and ROP6
  pathways. On one hand, interdigitated growth of PCs is regulated by an auxin-dependent
  self-organizing mechanism. Auxin activates the ROP2 pathway via the cell surface
  ABP1–TMK auxin receptor complex and subsequent downstream RopGEF. Both the ROP2–RIC4
  pathway and PID/PP2A-mediated phosphorylation switch polarizes PIN1 to nascent lobe
  tips, where it exports auxin to locally amplify extracellular auxin through the
  ROP2–PIN1 positive feedback loop. PIN1-exported auxin at the lobe sites can diffuse
  across the cell wall to coordinately activate ROP6–RIC1 at the complementary indenting
  site through another ABP1–TMK auxin receptor complex. Mutual inhibition of the ROP2
  and ROP6 pathways maintains ROP polarity and promotes lobe protrusion and neck indentation.
  On the other hand, ARR20, the positive regulator of cytokinin signalling, acts upstream
  of ROP2 to suppress the formation of the interdigitated pattern.
