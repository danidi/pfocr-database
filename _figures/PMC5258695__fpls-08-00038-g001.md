caption: Structural overview of ethylene biosynthesis. The amino acid methionine is
  converted to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) by SAM-synthetase (SAMS), a reaction
  that requires ATP. SAM is then converted to ACC by ACC synthase (ACS), in a reaction
  that cleaves off a 5′methylthioadenosine (MTA). MTA is recycled back to methionine
  through a series of intermediate steps, known as the Yang cycle or Methionine Salvage
  Pathway. In the presence of oxygen, ACC is converted to ethylene by ACC oxidase
  (ACO). The ovals represent sets of endogenous and exogenous cues stimulating ethylene
  production. IAA, indol-3-acetic acid (Auxin); CK, cytokinin; BR, brassinosteroid;
  JA, jasmonic acid; ABA, abscisic acid.
