caption: 'Network analysis of CD47-dependent gene expression in primary lung endothelial
  cells. A set of redox pathway-related genes () was used to analyze published microarray
  data comparing WT and Cd47−/− mouse lung endothelial cells (). Extracted data for
  genes on this list were subjected to Ingenuity pathway analysis. The canonical pathway
  for production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species gave a z-score −1.342
  for CD47 dependence (p-value: 1.74 × 10−5). Upregulated genes in CD47-deficient
  cells are labeled red and downregulated genes are labeled green. In addition to
  elements of the NO and ROS pathways, this analysis identifies several protein phosphatases
  as potential transcriptional targets of CD47 signaling, which could also be regulated
  post-translationally by CD47-dependent ROS and sulfhydration. To see this illustration
