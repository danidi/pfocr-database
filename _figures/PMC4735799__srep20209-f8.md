caption: (a) In E-cells, EGF-EGFR-ERK signaling activates the expression of ZEB1,
  which suppresses E-cadherin and miR205/200c. Under these conditions, cells exhibit
  mesenchymal-like characteristics. The red arrows indicate integrated signal strength.
  (b) In response to ligand-switching from EGF to AREG, the strength of EGFR-ERK signaling
  temporally decreases. The subsequent ZEB1 downregulation triggers the expression
  of E-cadherin and miR205/200c, leading to the change from mesenchymal-like to epithelial
  cell characteristics. Simultaneously, EGFR begins to accumulate on the plasma membrane.
  (c) AREG-mediated EGFR accumulation on the plasma membrane compensated for the weak
  association between AREG and EGFR, by which the EGFR-ERK strength of A-cells reaches
  levels almost equivalent to that of E-cells. On the other hand, A-cells expressed
  higher levels of miR-205/200c than E-cells and the expression of the ZEB1 protein
  is suppressed. Under these conditions, cells exhibit epithelial cell characteristics.
  (d) Ligand-switching from AREG to EGF results in an increase in integrated signal
  strength of the EGFR-ERK pathway. The alteration inverts the relative expression
  levels of ZEB1 and miR-205/200c, leading to a change from epithelial to mesenchymal-like
  cell characteristics. Simultaneously, EGFR on the plasma membrane begins to decrease.
  After the transitional stage (d), cells re-acquire mesenchymal-like cell characteristics
  shown in (a).
