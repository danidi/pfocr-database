caption: Model of starch synthesis in pollen grains. A schematic representation is
  shown for carbohydrate metabolism and transport in the pollen grain. All expressed
  isoforms during pollen development are indicated in red. Sugar uptake by the pollen
  occurs only via the apoplast, because developing microspores are symplastically
  isolated. Suc is either transported via the apoplast (SUC transporters) or metabolized
  first by cell wall invertases, and the resulting monosaccharides are transported
  by STP, PMT, and INT transporters. In the cytosol, expressed genes of the different
  metabolic routes for Suc, monosaccharide, hexose phosphate, and starch metabolism
  are depicted. Not or lowly expressed but important genes are indicated in green;
  expressed genes with unknown functions or with unknown substrate specificities are
  in blue; and the three genes for which we analyzed insertional mutants are highlighted
  by red boxes. Based on these expression patterns, the most likely pathway of starch
  biosynthesis within the developing pollen grain is highlighted in yellow. For the
  full names of enzymes and genes, see .
