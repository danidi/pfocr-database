caption: 'Deletion of glycogen synthase in a ΔfumABC strain restores carbon fluxes
  without changes in amounts of metabolic enzymes. (A to D) S. Typhimurium ΔfumABC
  and ΔfumABC ΔglgA strains were grown aerobically in LB broth for 18.5 h at 37°C.
  Analyses of metabolic enzymes and metabolites were performed as described for ,
  and comparisons of S. Typhimurium ΔfumABC ΔglgA to the ΔfumABC mutant are shown
  for TCA cycle (A), glycolysis (B), pentose phosphate pathway (C), and glycogen synthesis
  (D). Data represent means from at least four or three biological replicates for
  the metabolomics or proteomics analyses, respectively. (E) The concentrations of
  metabolites glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate
  (S7P) were determined and normalized to WT (=1). Statistical analyses were performed
  by Student’s t test, and all data shown have significance differences between the
  two strains of P < 0.05 or lower: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.'
