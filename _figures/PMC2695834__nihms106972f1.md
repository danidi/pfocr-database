caption: Different forms of regulation of ion channels relevant to Ca2+signaling.
  (A) In the canonical phosphoinositide signaling pathway, phospholipase C (PLC) activation
  from cell surface receptors leads to the generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3, which, in turn,
  releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores via Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor-channels.
  The decreased ER luminal Ca2+ is sensed by the ER resident STIM proteins that respond
  with oligomerization and interaction with PM (PM) Orai/CRACM channels at ER-PM junctional
  sites activating Ca2+ influx. This form of Ca2+ entry is indirectly linked to Ins(1,4,5)P3
  production, but direct regulation of the Orai channels and possibly STIM interaction
  with the PM by phosphoinositides has also been proposed. (B) Direct regulation of
  ion channel (and transporter) activities by PM phosphoinositides. Here the lipid
  directly interacts with some molecular component of the channel usually by electrostatic
  interaction involving positively charged regions of the channel facing the cytoplasm.
  Phosphoinositide levels can change as a result of PLC activation, or due to a shift
  in the balance of 5-phosphatase and PIP 5-kinase ctivities. Channels with the highest
  affinity to inositides may not respond to decreasing inositide levels if they tightly
  hold on to their bound lipid, therefore, the same lipid change can evoke a variety
  of activity changes depending on the lipid affinities of the channels. Potassium
  channels are also known to be sensitive to phosphoinositide changes and because
  they have significant impact on the membrane potential, they can indirectly affect
  Ca2+ entry by changing the electrochemical driving force of Ca2+. This is especially
  important for voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or for the inwardly rectifying ICRAC channels.
  (C) Ion channels are also moved around within the cells as a result of membrane
  trafficking. The synthesis and assembly of channels usually occures in the ER and
  the channels are glycosylated in the Golgi from where they are heading their final
  destination, the PM. It is now believed that most channels are not active within
  the internal membranes, although there are examples suggesting otherwise. PtdIns(4,5)P2
  is present in the PM and channels and transporters that require this lipid for activity
  gain functionality only upon insertion in the PM. In the opposite process, active
  channels can be removed from the PM by various interanlization routes, some clathrin-dependent,
  some –independent. Internalized channles are moved into recycling compartments from
  where they can recycle back to the membrane or head to degradation. All of these
  trafficking events are regulated by phosphoinositides.
