caption: Mesenchymal stem cell characteristics and activities in tumor suppression.
  (1) Mesenchymal stem cells express several surface molecules that have a pivotal
  role in their homing to tumor sites. These surface molecules are important during
  MSC adhesion to different cell types; for example, MSCs express connexin 43 on their
  membrane, which plays an important role in MSC adhesion to endothelial cells. (2)
  Tumor cells are able to produce several growth factors, for example, vascular endothelial
  growth factor, which stimulates new vessel formation and angiogenesis. Mesenchymal
  stem cells inhibit tumor angiogenesis by reducing the secretion of these growth
  factors and inducing apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest in endothelial cells. (3)
  During and after tumor formation, tumor cells undergo uncontrolled proliferation.
  Mesenchymal stem cells inhibit tumor cell proliferation by decreasing the expression
  of positive regulators of cell cycle and/or regulating cell cycle inhibitory genes.
  (4) Mesenchymal stem cells can increase tumor cell apoptosis either by up-regulating
  death receptors expression (extrinsic pathway of apoptosis) or stimulating intrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis. (5) Mesenchymal stem cells inhibit tumor metastasis by decreasing
  tumor cell motility in the primary site of a tumor. (6) Decreasing permeability
  of lymphatic or blood vessels for circulating tumor cells. (7) Early after carcinogen
  exposure, the initial inflammatory response is started, which recruits other innate
  immune cells from nearby capillaries. Mesenchymal stem cells affect different types
  of immune cells in the site of inflammation and modulate the immune response, which
  results in tumor inhibition. Mesenchymal stem cells decrease the amount of M2 phenotype
  macrophages (which promote tumor tolerance and angiogenesis through secretion of
  VEGF, TGF-β, and other soluble factors) and induce more regulatory T cells (which
  are produced during the active phase of immune response and limit the strong immune
  response by CD4+ and CD8+ cells and as a result prevent damage to the host tissue)
  to enter the inflammatory site.
