caption: Pathogenetic mechanisms of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα)
  dysfunction. C/EBPα function is disturbed at various levels in acute leukemias.
  Promoter methylation leads to silencing of promoter activity and decreased expression
  of C/EBPα. The fusion protein AML1-ETO suppresses C/EBPα transcription via disturbed
  autoregulation. Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobin H locus and
  the CEBPA gene (t14;19) occur in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
  have been described to induce aberrant C/EBPα expression in lymphoid cells. Other
  translocations which are associated with AML (AML1/MDS/Evi1 and CBFB/SMMHC) or chronic
  myelogenous leukemia (CML; BCR-ABL) have been demonstrated to increase the expression
  of specific RNA binding proteins which can block proper C/EBPα translation from
  an intact mRNA. In addition, posttranslational modifications such as Serine-21 phosphorylation
  by oncogenic Flt3-ITD as well as impairment of C/EBPα DNA binding by PLZF-RAR results
  in dysfunction of C/EBPα and a block of granulocytic differentiation. Finally, C/EBPα
  protein degradation is induced by Trib2 whose expression is increased by Notch1
  mutations in AML. CBFB, core-binding factor β; BP, RNA-binding protein; UPD, uniparental
  disomy.
