caption: Schematic model depicting assembly of the Atg1 kinase complex. Atg17 first
  interacts with the Atg13-Vac8 proteins. Atg13 and Atg1 may be phosphorylated by
  Tor and/or PKA (; ) or by downstream effectors. The highly phosphorylated form of
  Atg13 has a lower affinity for Atg1 () and this form of the complex may promote
  the Cvt pathway. Partial dephosphorylation of Atg13 and Atg1 allows the assembly
  of the putative holo-complex that triggers autophagy. Atg17 is depicted as interacting
  with Atg1 via Atg13, but the interaction may be direct (see text). Factors that
  have previously been characterized as being relatively specific for the Cvt pathway
  are depicted in gray. The timing of assembly of the Atg11, Atg20, and Atg24 proteins
  is not known as denoted by dotted lines. See text for additional details.
