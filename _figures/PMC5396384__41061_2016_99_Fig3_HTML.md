caption: Inositol polyphosphates synthetic pathway. The synthesis of higher phosphorylated
  inositol polyphosphates begins with the synthesis of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae uses only phospholipase C (PLC) hydrolysis of the lipid PI(4,5)P2 to
  synthesise Ins(1,4,5)P3 [], whereas Dictyostelium discoideum utilises the cytosolic
  route, of which the enzymology is not fully elucidated (dashed line) []. Ins(1,4,5)P3
  is metabolised by ITPKA, B, or C to synthesise Ins(1,3,4,5)P3, which is acted on
  by the 5-phosphatase (grey line) to generate the Ins(1,3,4)P3 converted by ITPK1
  to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5. However, this isomer of InsP5 can also be directly generated
  by IPMK from Ins(1,4,5)P3. InsP5 is converted to InsP6 by the IP5-2Kinase IPPK.
  Phosphorylation of InsP6 by the IP6Ks generates the inositol pyrophosphate InsP7,
  specifically the depicted isomer 5PP-InsP5, which is further acted on by PPIP5K1,2
  to IP8, specifically to 1,5(PP)2-IP4. The IP6K enzymes can also use Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5
  as a substrate, generating the inositol pyrophosphate PP-IP4. In this figure, for
  visual reasons, inositol is abbreviated as “I” instead of “Ins”, and phosphatidylinositol
  as “PI” instead “PtdIns”. Kinases catalysing each step are indicated in red (human)
  and blue (S. cerevisiae)
