caption: Three theoretical scenarios regarding lung epithelial cell apoptosis during
  pneumovirus infection, which may co-exist. First (A), viral infection triggers the
  mitochondrial (intrinsic) apoptotic pathway via interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins.
  Second (B), death receptor ligands (either membrane-bound or soluble) presented
  or secreted by local immune cells activate the death receptor (extrinsic) apoptotic
  pathway in viral-infected cells. Similarly, granzymes released from effector lymphocytes
  into the cytosol of target cells induce apoptosis. Viral infection may modulate
  the susceptibility to death receptor ligands or granzymes by altering the expression
  of and interaction with the protein machinery, such as surface death receptors,
  involved in these pathways. Third (C), bystander (uninfected) epithelial cells undergo
  apoptosis as a result of extensive, non-specific signaling via the death receptor
  (extrinsic) and/or granzyme apoptotic pathway.
