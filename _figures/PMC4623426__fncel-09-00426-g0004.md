caption: Regulation of Janus activated kinase (JAK)-Stat and nuclear factor kappa
  B (NFκB) signaling by TGFβ through MKP-1. Modulation of Interferon gamma (IFNγ)-
  and Interleukin 1β (IL1β)- induced signaling pathways (as models of inflammatory
  activation) by TGFβ1 reveals, at least partially, the anti-inflammatory effects
  of TGFβ1. IFNγ activates JAK- signal transducer and activator of transcription-type-1
  (STAT1) pathway, increasing pSTAT1tyr, pERKs and to a lesser extent pP38. ERK and
  P38 MAPKs potentiate STAT1 activation by phosphorylation of a serine residue. IFNγ-induced
  signaling pathway inhibits Smad signaling by increasing synthesis of its endogenous
  inhibitor Smad7. TGFβ1 is also able to activate MAPKs. Particularly, TGFβ1 can activate
  ERK and P38 and also, through the activation of the Smad3 pathway, induces an increase
  in MKP-1 expression. Particularly in microglia, TGFβ1 inhibits IFNγ-induced STAT1
  activation via a MKP-1-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2. Cytokines, such as IL1β induces
  activation of glial cells and the production of TNFα and nitric oxide (NO) through
  the activation of P38 and NFκB pathways. TGFβ1, by inducing an increase in MKP-1
  levels, inhibits P38 and NFκB pathways, reducing production of TNFα and NO. In aging,
  there are increased levels of IFNγ, inhibiting activation of the TGFβ1-Smad signaling
  pathway, as well as reducing induction of MKP-1, which will result in a decreased
  regulation of MAPKs and NFκB pathways. An alternative pathway observed in aging
  leads to atypical TGFβ1 signaling that through inducing sequestering of IκB, induces
  activation of NFκB. Furthermore, age-related inflammation and increased production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are strong activators of NFκB.
