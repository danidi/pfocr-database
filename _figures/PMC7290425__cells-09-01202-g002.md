caption: 'Breast cancer cells use HSFs to drive various tumor-promoting mechanisms.
  Several mechanisms contribute to the activation of human HSFs in breast cancer.
  Upon activation, trimeric HSF1, HSF2 and HSF4 bind to DNA and initiate the transcription
  of their target genes, which are involved in tumorigenesis. Multiple proteins enhance
  the activation of HSF1 by regulating its phosphorylation status. The hormone 17β-estradiol
  (E2) binds to and activates estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), which leads to HSF1 phosphorylation
  through the mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases
  (MAPK/ERK) pathway, in which the kinases MEK and ERK increase the phosphorylation
  of HSF1, most probably in the cytoplasm. Activation of HSF1 is also enhanced by
  epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which increases the phosphorylation of
  HSF1 by the intermediate kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein
  kinase B (AKT). Phosphorylated residues in HSF1 that are known to repress the trans-activating
  capacity of HSF1, are dephosphorylated (Pi) by a complex consisting of the transcription
  factor immeadiate early response gene 5 protein (IER5) and protein phosphatase 2
  (PP2A), thereby promoting HSF1 activation. In the nucleus, once activated, HSF1
  induces the transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), which enhance
  migration, proliferation, and oncogenic maturation as well as decrease cell–cell
  adhesion. HSF2 and the transcription factor zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1
  (ZEB1) cooperatively induce the transcription of pri-mir-183/96/182, and following
  post-transcriptional processing, these miRNA molecules stimulate migration and proliferation.
  For example, mir-183, targets the small GTPase RAB21, a protein that prevents aneuploidy.
  HSF2 also stimulates the expression of Dol-P-Man:Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase
  (ALG3), an enzyme involved in modulating migration and proliferation in breast cancer
  cells. HSF2 together with HSF4 modulates the transcription of hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), a transcription factor regulating a myriad of genes, including
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes angiogenesis. Abbreviation:
