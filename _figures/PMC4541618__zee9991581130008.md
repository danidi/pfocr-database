caption: Schematic model depicting the proposed signaling pathway in LH/hCG-induced
  miR-122-mediated LHR mRNA down-regulation. Binding of ligand to LH receptor induces
  activation of cAMP/PKA signaling followed by ERK1/2. This leads to an increase in
  the expression of miR-122, which causes the activation of SREBPs. Activated SREBPs
  increase the gene expression of LRBP, and the increase in translated protein is
  expressed as an increase in its LHR mRNA binding activity, ultimately leading to
  the degradation of LHR mRNA.
