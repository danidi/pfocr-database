caption: 'Carbon contribution of medium ingredients to riboflavin based on combined
  parallel 13C-labeled tracer studies using [13C2] glycine, [13C] formate, [13C5] glutamate,
  and [U13C] yeast extract. Riboflavin was synthesized by A. gossypii B2 grown on
  complex medium with rapeseed oil. Riboflavin was obtained at the end of the growth
  phase of riboflavin producing A. gossypii after 144 h. Data are derived from positional
  13C enrichment obtained from 13C NMR measurements (Table ), corrected for natural
  labeling and dilution effects through unlabeled pre-culture medium. Values denote
  carbon atoms and are normalized to 17 carbon atom influx into riboflavin. All values
  were multiplied by the number of carbon atoms of the reactants. Note that the model
  is simplified and cannot distinguish between carbon flux through e.g. gluconeogenesis
  or lower PP pathway as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase. Reaction between OAA/MAL
  and PEP/PYR pool is a lumped flux. Only reactions necessary for riboflavin biosynthesis
  were considered and all reactions represent net fluxes. Note that the conversion
  of citrate to isocitrate via aconitase most likely does not occur in the peroxisome
