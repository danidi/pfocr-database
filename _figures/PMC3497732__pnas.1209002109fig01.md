caption: Metabolic pathway construction for direct microbial synthesis of pentanol
  from glucose or glycerol. (A) Nature has evolved an efficient way to supply structurally
  diverse compounds by initially forming a carbon skeleton from which a handful of
  bioactive compounds are generated. For example, the highly functionalized antimalarial
  drug Artemisinin and anticancer drug Taxol can be derived from the isoprenoids pathway;
  various antibiotics such as Tetracycline can be synthesized from the polyketides
  pathway; and precursors for synthesis of various amino acids can be supplied from
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). (B) The pentanol biosynthetic pathway consists
  of three modules, each of which was validated separately and then assembled together.
  Genes in red and italics were overexpressed from inducible plasmids. (C) An enzyme
  toolkit was established and used to analyze the pentanol biosynthetic pathway by
  channeling membrane-impermeable CoA-tagged metabolite intermediates to membrane-permeable
  free acids, allowing for extracellular detection by HPLC. Similarly, certain free
  carboxylic acids can be activated with an adduct of a CoA tag using the enzyme toolkit
  and channeled into the pentanol pathway. (D) Tailor-made synthesis of various odd-chain
  chemicals can be achieved through particular combinations of the pathway and toolkit
  enzymes.
