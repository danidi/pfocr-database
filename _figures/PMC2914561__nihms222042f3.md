caption: Identified and potential key players involved in the regulation of translation
  in the axonal compartment and nociceptor plasticity. The available evidence suggests
  that mTOR activity is critical for maintaining the sensitivity of a subset of nociceptive
  neurons and that mTOR is also an important mediator of chemically-mediated nociceptor
  plasticity. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR activity, is a powerful tool
  for regulating protein synthesis of TOP mRNAs. Furthermore, findings from studies
  in FMRP-KO mice suggest that FMRP is crucial for mediating activity-dependent synthesis
  of new proteins that promote the hypersensitivity of nociceptors in response to
  mGluR1/5 agonists, chemically mediated pain (formalin) and perhaps after nerve injury.
  Although ERK and/or p38 activity have been positively linked to plasticity after
  inflammation or nerve injury, its role in regulating translation in the axonal compartment
  has not yet been explored. However, the availability of a specific MNK1 inhibitor,
  CGP57380, has been shown to reduce the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G, making
  the ERK–p38–MNK1 pathway an attractive target to explore. We propose that gaining
  a better understanding of how algogens and/or nerve injury modulate the expression
  of new proteins via these signaling pathways will lead to the discovery of new targets
  for the control of chronic pain directly at its source either via inhibition of
  these pathways (e.g. mTOR or ERK) or identification of proteins locally synthesized
  which may be targets for therapeutic intervention.
