caption: Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway contributes to hepatic carcinogenesis. The
  canonical Hh pathway starts from the Hh ligands binding to the 12-pass transmembrane
  protein patched 1 (PTCH1), which liberates SMO and further promotes the translocation
  of GLI into the nucleus. The non-canonical Hh pathway does not involve the ligand
  and receptor (PCTH1), and is operated in an SMO-independent fashion. In fact, it
  is activated by other factors, such as TGF-β. TGF-β binds to TGF-β receptor II and
  facilitates the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, and then p-SMAD2/3 is translocated into
  the nucleus together with SMAD4. The GLI transcription factor may interact with
  the SMAD complex and co-transact GLI targeting genes although how SMAD and GLIs
  work together in co-transactivation of the targeting genes is unclear. These targeting
  genes are involved in chronic inflammation and its transformation to oncogenic initiation,
  together with the fibrogenic (TGF-β) and oncogenic (c-Myc, Wnt, Nanog) factors.
  Hh signaling plays a critical role in maintenance of stem-like properties (CD133,
  CD44 and Nanog) in onset of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and in HCC invasion
  and metastasis through Snail, Twist, Zeb-1 and MMPs, as well as in drug resistance
  through ABCC1 and TAP1. The Hh signaling is self-amplified through a positive feedback
  of its signaling molecules as targeting genes (PTCH1 and GLI1), and the activated
  cells produce more ligands under an oncogenic status.
