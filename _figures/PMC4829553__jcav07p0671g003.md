caption: Gene network of top 50 genes that are closely associated to Egfr in the male
  mouse liver and their network in the female liver. The 50 nodes in the graph below
  show the selected traits. Only nodes with the edges are displayed. The graph's canvas
  is 40.0 by 40.0 cm; the node labels are drawn with a 18.0 point font, and the edge
  labels are drawn with a 18.0 point font. A. Gene network in the female liver. The
  684 edges between the nodes, filtered from the 1225 total edges and drawn as curves,
  show Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5. B. Gen
  network in the liver of the male mice. The 366 edges between the nodes, filtered
  from the 1225 total edges and drawn as curves, show Pearson correlation coefficients
  greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5.
