caption: TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) is the primary IRF3 activating kinase. IRF3
  is activated by phosphorylation, after which is translocates to the nucleus and
  induce Interferon gene transcription. DNA induction of this pathway may occur by
  RNA Polymerase III (RNAP3) transcription of abundant DNA into RNA, which can then
  function as a RIG-I substrate. RIG-I is well known in RNA induction pathways to
  signal through CARDIF, a mitochondrial adaptor to TRAF3 and downstream to TBK1.
  In addition, DAI has been found to recognize DNA and induce signals downstream to
  TBK1. Further studies may reveal new receptors that are either parallel or a more
  primary receptor for DNA that either DAI or RNAP3. However, STING has recently been
  found to be an ER associated multi-membrane protein that is required for signaling
  by these nucleic acid receptors, potentially by serving as a signaling docking and
  coordination center. In addition, TLR2 has recently been found to induce IRF3 activation
  in inflammatory monocytes by signaling from endosomal compartments. Finally, LRRFIP1
  has recently been found to respond to cytoplasmic nucleic acids and signal to induce
  β-catenin phosphorylation. Phosphorylated β-catenin translocate to the nucleus and
  is recruited to interferon promoters to activate CBP/p300 that then induce acetylation
  and activation of the interferon promoter in a mechanism whose importance is still
  being dissected.
