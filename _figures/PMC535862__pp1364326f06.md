caption: Schematic of a proposed metabolic pathway for the interconversions of the
  major amino acids in the maize cob. Relative assimilate concentrations are represented
  by size of the surrounding box and depict levels at 2 DAS for cobs and 18 DAS for
  spikelets of plants grown at high N and unpollinated. Average activities of measured
  and proposed (AS) N assimilation enzymes in the cob are represented by the relative
  size of the stars.
