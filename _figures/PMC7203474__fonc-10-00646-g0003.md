caption: Copper addiction of cancer cells could prevent the pro-inflammatory phenotype
  of macrophages. The increased copper flow via CTR1 is followed by loading onto the
  copper chaperone ATOX1, which acts as a copper-dependent transcription factor promoting
  cyclin D1 expression and cell replication. Since copper is essential for the activity
  of proteins, like cytochrome c oxidase (Cox), involved in the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain, mitochondria rely on the phosphate carrier SLC25A3 (PTP) for its
  uptake. Copper not only binds to proteins directly involved in cancer progression,
  such as MEK1, but also indirectly modulates their expression or activation. Copper
  inhibits prolyl hydroxylase thus stabilizing HIF-1α and increasing the transcription
  of several angiogenic genes (e.g., ceruloplasmin and VEGF) and genes involved in
  the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (e.g., LOX). Copper is essential for sustaining
  the pro-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages; indeed, as a component of the SOD
  enzyme which catalyzes the production of H2O2 from superoxide, it contributes to
  the ROS-dependent killing capacity of macrophages. The removal of copper from microenvironment
  by cancer cells might drive the polarization of TAMs toward a pro-tumoral M2-like
  phenotype. In parts the figures are based on speculations and have been prepared
  by assembling in-house built cellular metabolic pathway outlines with a modified
  and adapted version of BioRender images.
