number: Figure 1
caption: 'Hepatic synthesis of glutathione and nutritional substrates, co-factors,
  and other nutrients that influence metabolism. Key: 5-Methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5MTHF),
  system alanine–serine–cysteine (ASC), cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine
  gamma-lyase (CGL), electrophile response element (EpRE), glutathione-S-transferase
  (GST), glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), glutathione reductase (GRx), glutathione
  peroxidase (GPx), glutathione synthetase (GSx), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Nuclear
  factor erythroid factor-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe),
  S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), tetrahydrofolate (THF), thioredoxin reductase 1 (TRR1),
  water (H2O), cystine/glutamate antiporter system (xc−). Description: Folic acid
  is reduced to THF and converted to 5MTHF which can subsequently be transferred to
  homocysteine and generate methionine. Methionine forms SAMe, which produces SAH
  from methylation reactions. SAH is hydrolyzed to homocysteine. Homocysteine can
  either regenerate methionine or be directed to the trans-sulfuration pathway forming
  cystathionine via the catalytic activity of CBS and serine. CGL cleaves the sulfur–gamma
  carbon bond of cystathionine, resulting in the release of cysteine which can be
  used by GCL and GSx to form glutathione. Extracellular cysteine can be either taken
  up by the cysteine transporter ASC or oxidized to cystine and taken up by system
  xc−. N-acetylcysteine can donate cysteine or reduce plasma cystine to cysteine.
  Intracellular cystine is reduced to cysteine via TRR1 or glutathione. The synthesis
  of γ-glutamyl cysteine is catalyzed by GCL from cysteine and glutamate, and the
  addition of glycine to γ-glutamyl cysteine via GSx generates glutathione. GPx catalyzes
  the reduction of H2O2 by glutathione and forms reduced glutathione which is then
  recycled to glutathione by GRx. Glutathione can also form adducts and conjugate
  xenobiotics via GST. Oxidative stress activates the Nrf2 pathway which induces EpRE-dependent
  gene expression of enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism, including GCL, GSx,
  GPx, and GST, to re-establish cellular redox homeostasis. Modified and developed
  from [,,,,].'
