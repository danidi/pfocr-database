caption: Inhibition of TGF-β signaling pathway. The TGF-β signaling pathway is often
  elevated in human tumors, and thus a clinical target. This has led to the development
  of a range of anti-TGF-β-signaling drugs for cancer therapy. The four major classes
  of TGF-β inhibitors include ligand traps (e.g. 1D11 or Fresolimumab), antisense
  oligonucleotides (ASO) like Trabedersen, small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors
  such as LY2109761 or LY2157299, and peptide aptamers (e.g. Trx-SARA).
