caption: Changes in synaptic activity drive homeostatic compensatory changes in the
  number of surface AMPARs at synapses. Downregulation of synaptic AMPARs in response
  to increased activity requires the influx of calcium (Ca2+) through L-VGCCs and
  activation of a CaMKIV-dependent transcriptional pathway (green arrow). Upregulation
  of synaptic AMPARs in response to decreased synaptic activity is driven by reduced
  calcium influx through L-VGCCs, and a decrease in activity of the CaMKK/CaMKIV pathway
  (red bar). Because transcriptional activity is required for scaling induced by either
  increases or decreases in synaptic activity, these data that suggest that distinct
  classes of calcium-regulated transcription factors (one group activated by CaMKIV
  and one repressed) and distinct sets of target genes (Gene A and Gene B) mediate
  the two sides of the pathway.
