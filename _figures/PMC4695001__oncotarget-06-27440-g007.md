caption: '1) Major pathway for gal-induced fAR degradation (left). Gal treatment of
  PC cells implicates PI3K/Akt pathway: Akt phosphorylates AR at Ser210. Active Akt
  also phosphorylates Mdm2, which enhances ubiquitination of AR. Ubiquitinated AR
  is degraded by the 26S proteasome. 2) Major pathway for gal-induced AR-V7 degradation
  (right)). Gal treatment of PC cells stimulates increased interaction between CHIP-AR-V7,
  which then enhances ubiquitination of AR-V7 and targets it to degradation via the
  26S proteasome.'
