caption: 'Schematic representation of hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A induced
  insulin resistance. Based on our findings, a model has been proposed that depicts
  various check points in the insulin signaling pathway that gets modulated by nonstructural
  protein 5A (NS5A) protein. The up and down arrows represent upregulation and downregulation
  of proteins involved in insulin signaling cascades. The blunt headed line represents
  the check point that gets blocked by NS5A as this protein favors serine phosphorylation
  of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) while under normal conditions tyrosine phosphorylation
  is known to take place. HCV: Hepatitis C virus.'
