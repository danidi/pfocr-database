caption: Glucose-lipid crosstalk in diabetic kidney disease. (1) SREBP-1 is the master
  regulator of lipid metabolism and can be upregulated by insulin, glucose, and liver
  X receptor (LXR). Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) can negatively regulate SREBP-1 expression
  in the kidney. In diabetic patients, hyperglycemia induces expression of SREBP-1,
  which enhances lipogenic gene expression and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and leads
  to excess lipid accumulation in the kidney. (2) Activation of AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) suppresses the transcription of SREBP-1 and prevents renal lipotoxicity.
  Activated AMPK can also participate in the glucose-lipid crosstalk through the p-AMPK/Sirt-1/PGC-1α
  pathway or through suppression of mTOR. Drugs such as metformin can improve the
  lipid profile beyond its glucose-lowering effect. FA(S), fatty acid (synthase);
  ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
