caption: Schematic depiction of proposed increased activation of ERK signaling pathway
  in SS RBCs. Epinephrine stimulates β2ARs on SS RBCs. β2ARs are prototypic G-coupled
  receptors whose signaling is largely mediated by activation of stimulatory GTP-binding
  proteins (Gs proteins), and inhibited by activation of Gαi protein. Activation of
  Gs proteins in turn activates AC, leading to generation of cAMP, and the subsequent
  activation of PKA. The activity of downstream signaling proteins, such as MEKs and
  ERKs is enhanced by PKA activation. The tyrosine kinase p72Syk acts synergistically
  with PKA to activate MEK/ERK cascade. Activation of ERK results in phosphorylation
  of the ERK consensus motif on the cytoskeletal proteins α- and β-adducins, dematin,
  and protein 4.1, albeit not at the ERK consensus motif. Phosphorylation of cytoskeletal
  proteins may result in cytoplasmic membrane protein conformational changes, which
  could render ICAM-4 accessible to phosphorylation.
