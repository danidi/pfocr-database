caption: Diagram showing the potential role of the RAGE signaling pathway in the actions
  of AGEs on JNK activation and ECV304 viability inhibition. Increased blood sugar
  (diabetes) can trigger rapid increases in AGEs on the walls of vein grafts and arteries.
  As the ligand of RAGE, AGEs can cause deformation of ECV304 cells, activating RAGE
  and its downstream signaling molecules, including JNK. Activated JNK (P-JNK) leads
  to overexpression of RAGE and viability inhibition of ECV304 cells (MTT), thereby
  altering vascular structure and function. Blocking RAGE and its downstream molecules
  by hyperoside might inhibit vascular remodeling induced by AGEs.
