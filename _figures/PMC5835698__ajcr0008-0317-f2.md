caption: 'Antitumor mechanisms of ivermectin. 1. Ivermectin inhibits the P-glycoprotein
  pump, that induces a multidrug phenotype in the cancer cell. 2. Ivermectin acts
  as an ionophore and up-regulates chloride channels to generate apoptosis and osmotic
  cell death. 3. By decreasing the function of the mitochondrial complex I, ivermectin
  limits the electronic movement in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway that stimulates
  oxygen consumption rate to generate ATP for the cell. Concomitantly there is a reduction
  in the phosphorylation levels of Akt, impacting in the mitochondrial biogenesis
  process. Furthermore, alterations in the mitochondrial machinery are related with
  increased levels of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA. 4. Ivermectin induces
  ICD through the stimulation of an ATP- and HMGB1-enriched microenvironment, which
  promotes inflammation. This drug also increases ATP sensitivity and calcium signals
  in P2X membranal receptors, particularly P2X4 and P2X7, to induce ATP-dependent
  immune responses. 5. Ivermectin promotes the poly-ubiquitination of the kinase PAK1,
  which directs it to degradation in the proteasome. Defective PAK1, in turn, inhibits
  the Akt/mTOR pathway. At the same time, ivermectin stimulates the expression of
  Beclin1 and Atg5, both related with induction of autophagy and reduces the function
  of the negative regulator of apoptosis Bcl-2. Together, this generates autophagy
  and apoptosis. 6. Ivermectin represses AXIN2, LGR5 and ASCL2, all of them positive
  regulators of WNT-TCF while promotes the repressor of the WNT signaling FILIP1L.
  Concomitantly, ivermectin promotes the expression of several IFN-related genes,
  such as IFIT1, IFIT2, IF144, ISG20, IRF9 and OASL. 7. Ivermectin modifies the epigenetic
  signature and the self-renewal activity in the malignant cell due to its ability
  to mimic the SIN3-interaction that binds to the PAH2 motif of the cancer-associated
  deregulators SIN3A and SIN3B. SIN3A naturally induces NANOG and SOX2, which are
  stimulants of stem cell pluripotency. 8. Ivermectin limits the function of the RNA
  helicases NS3 and DDX23, both of which are related with ribosome biogenesis and
  post-transcriptional modifications, as well as with mRNA degradation. DDX23 acts
  as a promoter of miR-21, which is a well-recognized stimulator of tumor progression.
  9. Ivermectin inhibitis preferentially the CSC population and up-regulates pluripotency
  and self-renewal genes NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4. IVM: ivermectin; ATP: adenosine triphosphate;
  OCR: oxygen consumption rate; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
