caption: 'The chemical structure of trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine;
  T(SH)2) is depicted at the center. Synthesis: trypanothione synthetase catalyzes
  the ligation of two molecules of gluthatione to one of spermidine using the energy
  provided by two ATP molecules. Regeneration: trypanothione reductase maintains trypanothione
  in the reduced state at expenses of NADPH, which can be supplied by the oxidative
  phase of the pentose phosphate pathway via glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Utilization:
  reduced trypanothione is involved in multiple functions such as the detoxification
  of xenobiotics, cell proliferation, defense against oxidants and protein thiol-redox
  homeostasis. The multipurpose oxidoreductase tryparedoxin plays an important role
  catalyzing electron transfer from T(SH)2 to different molecular targets (e.g. peroxidases,
  ribonucleotide reductase and protein disulfides). G6P: glucose-6-phosphate, 6PGL:
  6-phosphogluconolactone, T(SH)2: reduced trypanothione, TS2[ox]: oxidized trypanothione,
  NDPs: nucleosides diphosphate, dNDP: deoxinucleosides diphosphate, E-: electrophilic
  species, TS-E: trypanothione-electrophile adduct, ROOH: hydroperoxide, ONOOH: peroxynitrite,
  NO2-: nitrite.'
