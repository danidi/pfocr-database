caption: Sirtuins and epigenetic regulation of immune cell functions. Sirtuins are
  a family of 7 members with different subcellular localization. These NAD-dependent
  deacetylases are involved in epigenetic regulation of metabolic reprogramming of
  cancer and immune cells and in promoting T cell differentiation and function. Particularly,
  in myeloid cells SIRT1 decreases inflammation negatively regulating NF-KB pathway,
  and inducing a metabolic rewiring mediated by its activity on AMPK/PGC-1α and HIF-1α
  stabilization. In T cell populations, SIRT1 modifies the phenotypic plasticity of
  Thelper and Treg and induces T cell tolerance. The manipulation of the Sirtuins/NAD
  axis is an important area of study for therapeutic implications in cancer research
  to repolarization of immune cell responses and to block tumor progression. TLR4,
  Toll-like receptor 4; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; HIF, Hypoxia-inducible
  factor; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; CTLA-4, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen
  4; TAM, tumor-associated macrophages; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressive cells.
