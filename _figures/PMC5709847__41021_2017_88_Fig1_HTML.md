caption: Checkpoint cascade in S. cerevisiae. DNA replication arrest and DNA lesions
  act as signals and are recognized by sensors to activate the checkpoint pathway.
  Sensors activate Mec1p kinase, followed by the consecutive phosphorylation of transducers
  and effectors to induce the expression of DNA damage response genes
