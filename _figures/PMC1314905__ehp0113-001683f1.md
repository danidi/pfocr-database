caption: 'Arsenic metabolic pathway. Arsenate is reduced to arsenite in a reaction
  thought to be dependent on GSH or other endogenous reductants. Abbreviations: GSH,
  glutathione; GSSG, glutathione disulfide; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; TR, thioredoxin reductase. Arsenite then undergoes an
  oxidative methylation, with SAM as the methyl donor, forming MMAV and SAH. MMAV
  is reduced to MMAIII before a subsequent oxidative methylation step yielding DMAV
  and SAH. Little is known regarding in vivo reduction of DMAV to DMAIII. Enzymes
  capable of catalyzing the illustrated reactions include Cyt19 (), arsenite methyltransferase
  and methy-larsonite methyltransferase (two activities of one enzyme) (), and MMAV
  reductase (also known as GST-Ω) ().'
