caption: Non-cell-autonomous overgrowth. Examples of different types of non-cell-autonomous
  overgrowth. Mutant cells are in pink, wild-type cells are in blue, hemocytes are
  in grey, and the basement membrane (basal lamina) is in purple. (a) Cell polarity
  or endocytosis mutant cells are induced by JNK signalling to undergo cell death
  and induce non-cell-autonomous overgrowth of the surrounding wild-type cells. In
  vps25 or tsg101 (ept) endocytic mutants, which also show apicobasal cell polarity
  defects, ectopic activation of Notch signalling leads to the expression and secretion
  of the Dome-Jak-Stat pathway ligand, Upd, which promotes non-cell-autonomous proliferation
  and overgrowth of surrounding tissue. In scrib mutant cells, elevated JNK signalling,
  and impaired Hippo signalling, leads to transcriptional upregulation of Upd, which
  activates Dom-Jak-Stat signalling in the surrounding wild-type cells, thereby inducing
  their proliferation. (b) Undead cells, where apoptosis is initiated, but effector
  caspase activity is blocked, emit morphogens (such as Wg, Dpp, and Hh) that promote
  proliferation of their wild-type epithelial neighbours, thereby leading to non-cell-autonomous
  overgrowth. (c) Mitochondrial mutants expressing RasV12 lead to non-cell-autonomous
  overgrowth. The mitochondrial impairment results in the production of ROS, which
  induces JNK activation, which, in turn, results in Hippo pathway impairment, leading
  to expression of the Yki targets, Upd and Wg. Upd elevates Jak/Stat signalling and
  Wg induces Wg pathway signalling in the surrounding wild-type cells to promote their
  overgrowth.
