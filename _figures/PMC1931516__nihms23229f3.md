caption: 'Glutamine/Glutamate (GLN/GLU) cycle in neurons and astrocytes. Glutamate
  released into the synaptic cleft is taken up by Na+ driven co-transport (GLT1) into
  astrocytes. Within the astrocyte GLU is enzymatically transformed to GLN by an ATP
  and NH4+ coupled reaction. GLN is transported by a glutamine/Na+ co-transporter
  (SN1) to the extracellular space and taken up by neurons by another Na+ coupled
  transporter (GlnT) and converted back to GLU by GLN synthetase and re-packaged into
  pre-synaptic vesicles. There is also a Na+ independent glutamine transport pathway
  but it is not shown. Two major effects of ammonia toxicity are shown. 1) Astrocytic
  swelling from intracellular accumulation of GLN. This is the result of putative
  inhibition of GLN export from the cell and osmotic swelling. 2) Excess synaptic
  GLU is thought to be caused by NH3 inhibition of astrocytic GLU uptake; the net
  effect is hyperstimulation of post-synaptic NMDAr. Acute NH3 exposure may excite
  NMDAr directly. Legend: GS represents glutamine synthetase; GLNase, glutaminase;
  GLT1, glutamate transporter; GlnT, neuronal glutamine tranporter; SN1, astrocytic
  glutamine transporter.'
