caption: Mechanisms by which bacteria influence cancer development and progression.
  (A) Barrier loss and increased bacterial translocation engages pattern recognition
  by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activation of innate and adaptive responses. The
  interleukin-23 (IL-23)-IL-17 axis, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, lead to chronic
  inflammation mediated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, favoring tumor progression (). (B) Bacterial
  virulence-factors promote carcinogenesis by engaging specific host pathways, which
  plays a decisive role in many malignancies. Fusobacterium nucleatum Fad-A binds
  host E-cadherin on colonic epithelial cells, and triggers Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  activation, resulting in increased NF-κB, and ultimately in increased tumor growth
  (). Other virulence factor such as H.pylori CagA have been widely studied (). (C)
  Some microorganisms modulate tumorigenesis through specific toxins, which induce
  host DNA damage. Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) produced by Gram-negative bacteria,
  Bacteroides fragilis toxin and Escherichia coli colibactin constitute some of the
  most studied toxins identified as potential drivers of CRC (). (D) Dietary residues
  determine the composition and metabolic activity of the microbiota. An imbalanced
  high-fat, high-meat, low-fiber diet, lead to a greater exposition to secondary bile
  acids, and protein fermentation metabolites (such as ammonia, phenols, sulfides,
  and nitrosamines), which have inflammatory and carcinogenic effects ().
