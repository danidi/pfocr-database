caption: '(Adapted from Alinari, Quinion, and Blum. Clin Pharmacol Ther 2015). B-Cell
  Receptor (BCR) signaling is a critical component of B cell activation, proliferation,
  survival, and migration in normal as well as malignant B cells. BCR activation,
  for example after antigen binding, induces CD79A and B immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motif (ITAM) phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of multiple kinases
  including Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and the SRC family kinases (SFK), LYN, SRC
  and BLK. Activation of these kinases initiates the signaling cascade leads to phosphorylation,
  recruitment, and activation of other important kinases and signaling molecules including
  Bruton''s tyrosine kinase (BTK), Phospholipase C–gamma 2 (PLCγ2), Protein kinase
  C (PKC), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The BCR signaling cascade ultimately
  leads to activation of multiple pro-survival pathways including ERK, NF-κB, and
  AKT signaling leading to increased transcriptional activation, proliferation, and
  migration. Additional abbreviations: SDF-1: stromal cell-derived factor 1; CXCR4:
