caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway. Binding of the Hedgehog ligand(s) (HhN, corresponding
  to Shh, Dhh, or Ihh) to the Patched receptor relieves its inhibitory effect on Smoothened
  (Smo), resulting in the activation of Gli transcription factors and induction of
  Gli-controlled genes. Hedgehog-Interacting Protein (HHIP) inhibits the signaling
  pathway by competing with Patched for binding to the Hedgehog ligands. Adapted from
