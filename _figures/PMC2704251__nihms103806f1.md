caption: P. gingivalis is predominantly recognized by the TLR2/1 heterodimer []. Through
  its fimbriae, the pathogen binds CXCR4 which cross-talks with and suppresses the
  TLR2/1-induced TIRAP/MyD88-mediated antimicrobial pathway []. The mechanism involves
  CXCR4-induced activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) which suppresses
  NF-κB activation and induction of proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial molecules,
  such as the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These inhibitory effects promote
  P. gingivalis survival in vitro and in vivo []. The CXCR4 mechanism does not however
  inhibit the P. gingivalis-induced inside-out signaling, which proceeds via phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) and cytohesin-1 and activates the high-affinity conformation of
  CR3 [, ](and unpublished data). Intriguingly, P. gingivalis interacts with activated
  CR3 and is thereby internalized; this is a relatively safe portal of entry since
  CR3 is not linked to vigorous microbicidal mechanisms [, ]. Moreover, the P. gingivalis-CR3
  interaction induces outside-in signaling, which via extracellular signal-related
  kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) downregulates IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression [], possibly
  through ERK1/2 suppression of IRF-1 and ICSBP transcription factors []. At the protein
  level, the outcome is reduced production of bioactive IL-12 resulting in impaired
  immune clearance of P. gingivalis in vivo [].
