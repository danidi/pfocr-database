caption: 'Summary of the proposed metabolic IP3-mediated SR/mitochondrial signaling
  pathway in the presence (upper panel) or absence (lower panel) of intact Mfn2-tethers.
  IP3-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in WT myocytes (upper panel), which is followed
  by an increase in ATP generation. When the physical contact of mitochondria and
  the SR is disturbed by knockout of Mfn2 (lower panel), Ca2+ released from the SR
  by IP3 cannot be taken up into mitochondria anymore leading to the decrease in ATP
  level. Yellow circles: Ca2+, yellow arrow: Ca2+ movement, green arrow: IP3 movement.'
