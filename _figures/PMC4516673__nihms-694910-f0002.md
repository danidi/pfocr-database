caption: De novo pathway enzymes for production of ceramide. Ceramide synthesis is
  initiated by serine palmitoyltransferase and culminates with addition of a 4,5-trans
  double bond in dihydroceramide, catalyzed by dihydroceramide desaturase. Ceramide
  synthases, which number 6, are the subject of engaged investigations due to their
  selectivity for an array of fatty acyl-CoAs, giving rise to a myriad of molecular
  species of ceramides with distinct biological properties. Enzymes of the de novo
  pathway are shown in italics.
