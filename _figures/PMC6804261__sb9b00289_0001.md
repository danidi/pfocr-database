caption: Schematic overview of metabolism in Synechocystis surrounding fumarate. During
  day-time fumarate is produced as part of the purine and urea metabolism. Removing
  the FumC blocks the reutilization of fumarate, causing it to accumulate and eventually
  leak out. At night-time Synechocystis uses the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to
  generate energy-carriers from glycogen. Removal of the zwf gene, disables the OPPP
  and forces the utilization of the disrupted TCA cycle.
