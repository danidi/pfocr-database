caption: The transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-smad signaling pathway. The TGFβ
  ligand binds the transmembrane type II ser/thr kinase receptor (TβRII) leading to
  recruitment of type I ser/thr kinase receptor (TβRI). Within this complex, TβRII
  transphosphorylates the TβRI within the GS domain which in turn promotes the activation
  of the TβRI's kinase moiety. The activated ligand-receptor heteromeric complex associate
  with the Receptor-regulated Smad 2 and 3, whereby the last two C-terminal serine
  residues within these Smads are targeted by phosphorylation by the TβRI kinase.
  The TGFβ-phosphorylated R-Smad dissociates from the receptor complex and forms a
  hetero-oligomer complex with the common-partner Smad4, and the complex accumulates
  in the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the Smad complex binds to specific DNA elements
  on TGFβ-responsive genes and in collaboration with other transcription factors and
  transcriptional coregulators, including SnoN, can positively or negatively regulate
  the expression of these genes and consequent responses including EMT. The ubiquitin
  E3 ligase Smurf2 is recruited to the activated TGFβ receptors leading to their ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation and suppression of TGFβ signaling pathway.
