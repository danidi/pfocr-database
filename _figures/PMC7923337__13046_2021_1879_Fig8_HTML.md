caption: Overexpressed WDR3 induces the activation of Hippo pathway by interacting
  with GATA4 in pancreatic cancer. The overexpressed WDR3 promoted the nuclear translocation
  of GATA4 and increased the binding of GATA4 to the promoter of YAP1 by interacting
  with GATA4 in pancreatic cancer cells. As a transcription factor, the binding of
  GATA4 to the promoter of YAP1 induced the expression of YAP1. The upregulation of
  YAP1, the main effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, resulted in the activation
  of the Hippo pathway signaling and the overexpression of downstream effector genes,
  CTGF and CYR61. Finally, the cell proliferation and invasion were promoted
