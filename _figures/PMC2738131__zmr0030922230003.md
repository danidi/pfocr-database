caption: Synthesis of NAD through the NaMN intermediate. (A) In the Preiss-Handler
  pathway, nicotinic acid is salvaged to NAD via NaMN and NaAD intermediates. The
  pathway is depicted with S. cerevisiae gene names over the arrows and E. coli gene
  names under the arrows. (B) In F. tularensis, the de novo pathway depicted in Fig.  was
  found, but the nadD gene was found to be missing. Utilization of NaMN depends on
  NaMN amidation to NMN by a unique nadE gene, followed by NMN adenylylation by nadM.
