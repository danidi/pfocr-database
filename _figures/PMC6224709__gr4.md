caption: Central carbon metabolism pathways in daf-2 and eat-2 mutants. (a) Data from
  the gene expression profile (rectangles) and metabolite profile (circles) were color-coded
  and integrated in three major pathways of central carbon metabolism, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
  the pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle. The majority of genes involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  remained unaltered in both long-lived mutants.Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis intermediates
  remained low in both long-lived mutants, except the final product of this pathway,
  i.e. pyruvate, which accumulated in daf-2 mutants. Genes coding for PPP enzymes
  were mostly unchanged and PPP intermediates were lowered in both long-lived mutants.
  Alcohol fermenting genes also showed increased expression in both long-lived mutants.
  The majority of genes involved in the TCA cycle were unchanged and TCA intermediates
  were significantly lowered in daf-2 mutants. TCA intermediates were unchanged in
  eat-2 mutants except for elevated cis‑aconitate and succinate levels. White circles
  are metabolites that were not measured. (b) Gene expression profiles of genes that
  are involved in fermentative metabolism. Each column represents one biological replicate
  (four biological replicates for each worm strain), and the fold-change is represented
  as log2-transformed.
