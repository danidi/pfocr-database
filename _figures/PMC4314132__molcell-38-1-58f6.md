caption: A model for ATF3 action during S. pneumoniae infection. During pneumococcal
  infection, PLY seems to interact with TLR4 and activates ATF3 via the TLR4/MAPK
  signaling pathway, which stimulates formation of an ATF3 complex with c-Jun, and
  this complex binds to promoters of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ), resulting in
  enhanced cytokine production.
