caption: Secondary ROS and signaling from endosomes in aspergilli. Proposed model
  for stress-tolerant fungal germling development by ROS generated during secondary
  metabolism is based on available experimental data including current studies. The
  model proposes that increased levels of extracellular ROS up-regulate NADPH oxidase
  A (NoxA) and the stress activated protein kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase
  (SAPK/MAPK) signaling pathway. Activation of the SAPK/MAPK signaling cascade promotes
  AtfB binding to corresponding CRE sites in promoters of antioxidant and aflatoxin
  genes. NoxA induces intracellular primary ROS bursts that in turn activate AflR,
  which binds to corresponding AFLR sites in promoters of aflatoxin biosynthetic genes
  for activation of the gene expression. Aflatoxin biosynthetic enzymes are transported
  into endosomes, where aflatoxins (AF) are produced, and then secreted into medium
  concurrently with the toxin. Secondary ROS bursts produced during aflatoxin production
  in endosomes/aflatoxisomes, by most likely epigenetic mechanisms convey H2O2 resistance
  to next generation germlings. The dotted lined arrows indicate signal transduction
  and the solid lined arrows indicate binding of transcription factors, AtfB and AflR,
  to the corresponding sites in the promoters of the genes. The curved arrows designate
  entering of the transcription factors from cytoplasm to nucleus. Superoxide dismutase
  (S) and catalase (C) present in aflatoxisomes control levels of secondary ROS and
  associated signaling.
