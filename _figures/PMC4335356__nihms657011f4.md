caption: '(a) The overlap of 16p11.2 genes (left Venn diagram) and their co-expressed
  interacting partners (right Venn diagram) across four significant spatio-temporal
  intervals. Statistical significance of observing higher than expected number of
  overlapping genes (star symbol) was assessed by permutation test using simulated
  CNVs. The enrichment analyses of 20 interacting pairs shared by four intervals were
  performed using DAVID. “Signaling by NGF” and “Signaling by Wnt” pathways are significantly
  enriched. (b) Comparison of spatio-temporal networks across different brain regions
  within the same developmental period (P3R1, P3R2 and P3R3) and across different
  developmental periods within the same brain region (P3R2 and P6R2). 16p11 genes
  are shown as red nodes; their co-expressed interacting partners as grey nodes; and
  the PPIs between co-expressed genes at a particular developmental period are shown
  as colored edges: P3R1 (turquoise); P3R2 (blue); P3R3 (greenish gray); P6R2 (purple).
  The nodes that lost all edges were removed from the corresponding networks. Significant
  differences are observed across developmental periods but not across brain regions
  (ANOVA Table below). See also .'
