caption: Ingenuity Pathway Maps of the Fatty Acid Biosynthesis gene set that was enriched
  in both the basal-like (A) and non-basal like residual cancers (B) and the Sonic
  Hedgehog Signaling gene set that was depleted in basal-like (C) as well as non-basal-like
  (D) residual cancers. Red = genes over-expressed in residual samples; green = genes
  under -expressed in residual samples; grey = genes with no statistically significant
  differential expression (P<.01); white = pathway member not available in data. Mixed
  colors represent variable association for the same gene depending on probe set (6.3.4.14=biotin
  carboxylase 6.4.1.2= acetyl-CoA carboxylase).
