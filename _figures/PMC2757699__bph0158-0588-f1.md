caption: Metabolic fate of the 13C-label from [1-13C]-glucose. Label incorporation
  (black solid circles) is presented for glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  intermediates from metabolism of [1-13C]-glucose. Briefly, in cancer cells, increased
  uptake of [1-13C]-glucose through the glucose transporter GLUT-1 is detected by
  analysing extracellular levels of [1-13C]-glucose in the media. Increased activity
  of glycolysis was calculated from the amount of intracellular [3-13C]-lactate in
  the cellular fraction, as well as the amount of lactate exported into media through
  the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT4). Decreased mitochondrial activity is detected
  by low levels of 13C-enrichment into [4-13C]-glutamate (and glutamine, through pyruvate
  dehydrogenase) and [2,3-13C]-glutamate (and glutamine, through pyruvate carboxylase
  from the first TCA run). Finally, exported acetyl-CoA (from the truncated TCA cycle)
  into the cytosol is used for increased 13C-fatty acid synthesis. 13C-fluxes through
  the pentose phosphate pathway can be detected by alternative methods such as GC-LC.
