caption: 'Rhizosphere-induced genes in Rlv3841 metabolic pathways. Bold lines show
  reactions encoded by genes induced (by three-fold or more, P ≤ 0.05) and are color
  coded for the rhizospheres: black, all; green, pea-specific; red, alfalfa-specific;
  blue, legume-specific; purple, alfalfa and sugar beet. An induced gene is also considered
  to be elevated in further rhizospheres where expression was elevated by two-fold
  or more (Additional file ). Where more than one enzyme carries out a reaction the
  color reflects the gene elevated in most rhizospheres. Asterisks indicate compounds
  imported by a transport system whose expression was elevated (Figure 1). aGenes
  are part of an induced operon and elevated ≥ 1.3-fold; bgenes induced ≥ 3-fold,
  P ≤ 0.11; cgenes elevated ≥ 2.2-fold, P ≤ 0.05. Dotted lines and boxed genes show
  those down-regulated (≤ 0.3-fold, P ≤ 0.05) relative to glucose-grown cells. Expression
  is considered to be down-regulated in all rhizospheres if ≤ 0.5-fold. Reactions
  carried out by genes slightly down-regulated (0.4- to 0.8-fold; Additional file
  ) are shown by a thin grey line. The dichloroethane pathway shown in italics is
  speculative. Genes underlined have been mutated and results of their competitiveness
  in the rhizosphere are shown in Additional file . DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
  ED, Entner-Doudoroff; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.'
