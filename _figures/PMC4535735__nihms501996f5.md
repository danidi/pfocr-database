caption: The three classification problems (configurations) considered in this paper
  are defined by a pair of biologically interesting cellular contexts. For each configuration
  we attempt to classify samples as coming from class 0 or class 1 given measurements
  of the 9 downstream signaling proteins. The presence of an input indicates activation,
  absence indicates inactivation, and a shaded input indicates the input may either
  be active or inactive.
