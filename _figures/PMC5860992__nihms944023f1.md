caption: Accumulation of misfolding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates
  the transmembrane protein UPR signal transducers PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. Dimerization
  and auto-phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1, or trafficking to the Golgi and subsequent
  proteolytic processing of ATF6, result in the production of the UPR transcription
  factors by enhancing translation of ATF4, splicing XBP1 mRNA to yield XBP1s, and
  releasing ATF6f from the Golgi membrane. These transcription factors proceed to
  the nucleus and remodel the ER proteostasis environment by upregulating chaperones,
  quality control components, and other UPR target genes to maintain or recover secretory
  proteostasis. PERK can globally reduce the nascent protein load on the ER via phosphorylation
  of eIF2α, a pathway that can be similarly induced by the integrated stress response.
  The RNase domain of activated IRE1 degrades several ER-targeted transcripts and
  may play a related role.
