caption: Schematic overview of the RhoGDIα-mediated balance between RhoA and RhoC,
  resulting in modifications of the signaling pathway and leading to cancer cell growth
  and migration. (1) In basal condition, the activation of RhoA and RhoC is not sufficient
  to induce NAG-1 expression via ROCK. Cancer cells proliferate and migrate efficiently.
  (2) On RhoC silencing, the amount of RhoA-GDP stabilized by RhoGDIα and available
  for activation by specific GEF is increased. This leads to an enhanced level of
  RhoA-GTP, which drives NAG-1 gene expression via ROCK. RhoA overexpression induces
  a similar phenotype. The shift of the balance toward RhoA also inhibits cell migration
  but through an NAG-1–independent pathway.
