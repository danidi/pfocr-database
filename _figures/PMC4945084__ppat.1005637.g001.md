caption: (A) Upon entry into the alveolar space, resident neutrophils and macrophages
  are essential in the recognition and effective removal of A. fumigatus. (B) In the
  event that A. fumigatus evades removal, it can germinate into a filamentous hyphal
  form, which causes damage to the lung epithelium and vasculature. This leads to
  the leakage of serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL) into the alveolar space where
  it interacts with A. fumigatus. It has been demonstrated in vivo that MBL is capable
  of modulating inflammatory cytokine production, enhancing phagocytosis, fungal killing,
  and survival. Moreover, MBL activates the lectin complement pathway. (C and D) The
  surfactant proteins (SP)-A and –D are both secreted directly into the alveolar space
  by type II epithelial cells. SP-A can predominantly be found within the pulmonary
  surfactant, whereas most of the SP-D can be found within the bronchoalveolar lavage
  fluid (BAL). As for MBL, SP-A and SP-D have been demonstrated to modulate cytokines,
  increase phagocytosis, and reduce fungal burden in vivo. However, SP-A appeared
  to be detrimental to survival following A. fumigatus infection, and neither are
  capable of activating complement. (E) H-ficolin is the most abundant ficolin in
  the serum, but it is also produced directly into the alveolar space by type II epithelial
  and bronchial cells. H-ficolin is capable of activating the lectin complement pathway
  on A. fumigatus conidia, and H-ficolin opsonised conidia promote the secretion of
  IL-8 from type II epithelial cells. However, the interactions of H-ficolin opsonised
  A. fumigatus with other cells of the immune system (neutrophils and macrophages)
  or in vivo (H-ficolin is a pseudogene in rodents) is unknown. (F) L-ficolin is found
  circulating in the serum but can enter the alveolar space following fungal infection.
  L-ficolin opsonisation has been demonstrated to lead to a reduction in inflammatory
  cytokine production by neutrophils and macrophages, promote IL-8 production by type
  II epithelial cells, increase host–fungal interactions, and activate the lectin
  pathway of complement. However, the in vivo function of this protein is still unknown.
