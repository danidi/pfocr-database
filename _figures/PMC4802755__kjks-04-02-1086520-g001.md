caption: 'Schematic depiction on exogenous LIF mediated intra-cellular signaling pathways
  for robust self-renewal in mESCs. LIF activates at least 3 intra-cellular signaling
  pathways: Jak-Stat3, PI3K-Akt and Shp2-MAPK pathways. Upon LIF stimulation, Jaks
  (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3 and Tyk2) are activated by auto-phosphorylation. Activated Jaks
  induce downstream cascades. Stat3 is phosphorylated and activated by Jaks, and subsequently
  induces the expressions of various pluripotent associated genes. Activated PI3K-Akt
  by Jaks also positively regulates the genes. In contrast to these 2 pathways, activated
  MAPK pathway inhibits the expressions of the pluripotency associated genes both
  at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In addition to signal mediated
  transcriptional regulation, activated Jak2 tunes the chromatin status through histone
  modification. Also, activated Erk1 and Erk2 directly interact with Klf2 and phosphorylate
  it, leading to ubiquitination and degradion of Klf2 via proteasomal pathway. Also,
  LIF-PI3K-Akt axis stabilizes c-myc via inhibiting Gsk3 activity.'
