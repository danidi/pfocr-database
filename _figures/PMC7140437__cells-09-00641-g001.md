caption: Scheme of vectors used for protoplast transient transfections in this study.
  (A) The protein-fusion reporter vectors. The coding sequences of wild-type and mutant
  Jas-motif and the JasSHY chimeric protein were fused in-frame to the N-terminus
  of firefly luciferase (fLuc) reporter gene. Expression of reporter proteins were
  under the control of the UBQ10 promoter. (B) The effector vectors. Expression of
  SHY2, JaSHY chimera, COI1 and COI1 mutant effector proteins were placed under the
  control of the UBQ10 promoter. All reporter and effector proteins contain a hemagglutinin
  (HA) epitope tag at the N-terminus. (C) The promoter-reporter vector. The auxin
  responsive DR5 promoter sequence was fused to the firefly luciferase (fLuc) reporter
  gene. Not drawn to scale.
