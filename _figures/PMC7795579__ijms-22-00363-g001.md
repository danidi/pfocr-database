caption: Our conceptual model hypothesizes that, following airway inflammation, TNFα
  induces an increase in airway smooth muscle (ASM) force generation and ATP consumption
  leading to increased mitochondrial O2 consumption and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production. TNFα-induced ROS formation leads to protein unfolding and selective
  activation of the pIRE1α/XBP1s endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway and a mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response (mtUPR). Downstream XBP1s mediates an increase in PGC1α,
  PINK1/Parkin expression resulting in increased Drp1 and reduced Mfn2 expression,
  which leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy. Reduced Mfn2 also disrupts
  mitochondrial tethering to the ER, thereby decreasing mitochondrial Ca2+ influx.
  Increased PGC1α also promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and increased mitochondrial
  volume density. The homeostatic remodeling of mitochondria reduces O2 consumption
  and ROS formation by individual mitochondrion while still meeting the increased
  ATP demand. Thus, the energetic load of hyper-reactivity is shared across the mitochondrial
  pool within ASM cells.
