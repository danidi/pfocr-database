caption: Fig. 1. Three hormone signalling pathways as defined by genetic and molecular
  analysis. A, In the absence of ethylene the family of ethylene receptors (ETR1,
  ETR2, ERS1, ERS2, EIN4) activates CTR1, which in turn represses the positive membrane
  protein regulator EIN2. Addition of ethylene inactivates the ethylene receptors
  resulting in inactivation of CTR1 thereby releasing EIN2 to activate EIN3. The EIN3
  transcription factor binds to regulatory sequences in the promoter of ethylene‐regulated
  genes inducing transcription. B, A receptor for ABA has not been defined. However,
  genetically downstream of ABA reception, dephosphorylation (ABI1/2), protein farnesylation
  (ERA1) and RNA processing (ABH1) are all required to attenuate the ABA signal. At
  the bottom of the pathway three transcription factors (ABI3, ABI4, ABI5) are responsible
  for at least seed sensitivity to ABA. C, The receptor for GA has not been defined.
  However, in the absence of GA a family of transcription factors (GAI, RGA, RGL1
  and RGL2) inhibits various GA‐mediated responses. Through unknown mechanisms, GA
  antagonizes these proteins resulting in expression of GA‐regulated genes. SLY1 and
  SPY are also thought to regulate these transcriptional repressors. Green molecules
  indicate transcription factors, blue molecules indicate signalling intermediates,
  and yellow molecules represent receptors. Arrows represent positive regulation and
  bars represent negative regulation.
