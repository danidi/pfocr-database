caption: A. Structure of NAD. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is composed
  of two nucleotides, an adenine monophosphate (AMP) and a nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN) linked together by two phosphate groups. During the ADP-ribosylation reaction
  the ADP-ribose unit is transferred to target proteins by ARTD enzymes and a unit
  of nicotinamide (Nam) is released.B. Pathways of NAD+synthesis. NAD+ is synthesized
  by a de novo pathway from the amino acid tryptophan (black arrows) and by a salvage
  pathway (Blue arrows).
