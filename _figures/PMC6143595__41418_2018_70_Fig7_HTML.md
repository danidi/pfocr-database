caption: Our model depicts the protection conferred by Lactobacillus on the intestinal
  epithelial barrier via the modulation of ISCs. Lactobacillus stimulated LPLs to
  secret IL-22 via AhR and then activated phosphorylation of STAT3 to accelerate ISCs
  regeneration and thus maintain the epithelial barrier. Some factors, such as DSS,
  stimulated the intestinal mucosa to secret IL-1β and TNF-α, and then induced epithelial
  damage and intestinal inflammation. However, Lactobacillus stimulated ISCs proliferation
  through the pSTAT3 pathway activated by IL-22 and inhibited inflammatory cytokine
  secretion to protect the mucosa barrier
