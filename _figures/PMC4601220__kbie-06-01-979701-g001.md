number: Figure 1
caption: RNAi pathways in insects. The figure shows the biogenesis pathways for siRNAs,
  miRNAs and piRNAs in insects. In the siRNA pathway, the RNA transcript from a DNA
  construct encoding hairpin loop sequences, or from a virus-derived dsRNA will trigger
  siRNA generation in the cytoplasm, resulting from the recognition and dicing by
  Dicer 2. The siRNA duplexes will then load into the AGO 2 - RISC complex. The guide
  strand of siRNA is maintained in the RISC and will lead it to the target mRNA for
  degradation/cleavage or translation repression. For endogenous miRNAs, pri-miRNA
  is transcribed from genomic DNA, and processed by Drosha and cofactor Pasha (DGCR8)
  into the pre-miRNA. Next, the pre-miRNA will be transported into cytoplasm by exportin
  5 and Ran-GTP, and cleaved by Dicer 1 into miRNA duplexes. Similar to siRNAs, the
  miRNA duplexes will incorporate into the AGO 1 - RISC complex, followed by target
  mRNA cleavage/degradation or translation repression. In the piRNA pathway, piRNA
  precursors are transcribed from piRNA clusters in the genomic DNA sequences. The
  antisense transcript could transport into cytoplasm, processed by series of proteins
  of the Piwi-group, in Zuc dependent or independent manner and incorporated into
  the PIWI-RISC complex, or into the AUB-RISC complex in the ping-pong cycle. The
  sense strand, which is targeted by the antisense strand in AUB-RISC, will then be
  cleaved and incorporated into AGO 3 to target the antisense strand; hence the ping-pong
  cycle.
