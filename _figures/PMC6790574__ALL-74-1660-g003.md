caption: Nucleic acid sensors. RIG‐I and MDA5 have two CARD domains at the N‐terminus
  and a helicase domain at the center. Both RIG‐I and MDA5 bind viral RNAs bearing
  5’‐triphosphate or 5’‐diphosphate distinct from the mammalian RNA with 5’ cap structure.
  After viral RNA recognition, RIG‐I and MDA5 interact with IPS‐1 (MAVS) through CARD‐CARD
  interactions. IPS‐1 (MAVS) is localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Aggregated
  IPS‐1 (MAVS) activates TBK1 and IKKi (IKKε) through TRAFs, leading to induction
  of type I IFN via phosphorylation of IRF‐3/7. cGAS binds dsDNA and produces a second
  messenger, cGAMP, from ATP and GTP. cGAMP binds to STING localized on the ER membrane
  and induces type I IFN production via the TBK1/IRF‐3 pathway. CARD, caspase‐recruitment
  domain; cGAMP, cyclic GMP‐AMP; cGAS, cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  IKKi, inducible inhibitor of NF‐κB (IκB) kinase; IPS‐1, IFN‐β promoter stimulator
  1; IRF, IFN regulatory factor; MDA5, melanoma differentiation‐associated gene 5;
  RIG‐I, retinoic acid‐inducible gene I; STING, stimulator of IFN genes; TBK1, TRAF‐associated
  NF‐κB activator (TANK)‐binding kinase 1; TRAF, TNF receptor‐associated factor
