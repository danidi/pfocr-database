caption: Schema of the Stat3-promoter TA-Rluc-RFP (pS3/RR) reporter construct. (A)
  Schematic diagram of lentiviral vector carrying the STAT3 reporter gene (pS3/RR).
  Purple bricks are the STAT3-recognition sequence (TGCTTCCCGAACGT), within which
  TTCCCGAA is the STAT3 specific–binding element. A fusion reporter gene with renilla
  luciferase (Rluc) and red fluorescence protein (RFP) is driven by 7 repeat of STAT3-recognition
  sequence (enhancer) and a small TA promoter (from the herpes simplex virus thymidine
  kinase promoter). The expression of this cassette is specific for activated STAT3.
  A separate cassette with human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (CMV promoter)-driving
  green fluorescence protein (GFP) is included as internal transfection control. (LTR,
  long-terminal repeat; RRE, Rev-responsive element; FLAP, central DNA flap; CMV,
  cytomegalovirus; WRE, woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element;
  SIN LTR, self-inactivating long terminal repeat.) (B) Schematic for noninvasive
  imaging of STAT3 activity. JAK kinases are phosphorylated by a cell surface receptor
  tyrosine kinases in response to cytokine activation. JAK kinases can then phosphorylate
  STAT3, which bind to the STAT3 DNA-binding sequence to activate the reporter construct.
