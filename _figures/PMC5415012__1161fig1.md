caption: Schematic representations of selected modes of cross-talk between autophagy
  and the secretory pathway. Right, the small GTPase Ypt1/Rab1 regulates the tethering
  of ER-derived, COPII-coated vesicles to the Golgi in rich medium. During starvation,
  however, Sec24 is phosphorylated, which promotes the fusion of COPII vesicles with
  Atg9 vesicles to regulate autophagosome abundance. Middle, growth factors and nutrients
  signal to the ERES regulator SEC16A. The autophagy-initiating kinases ULK1/2 are
  also activated by nutrient signaling and phosphorylate SEC16A. Finally (middle,
  bottom), the autophagy-regulating protein TECPR2 regulates COPII carrier biogenesis
  in a manner that depends on LC3C, thereby bridging secretion and autophagy.
