caption: Ischemia leads to inflammation, tissue injury, and ROS production, which,
  when coupled with reperfusion can lead to injury. Gaseous transmitters now known
  to be produced endogenously (e.g. CO, NO) may have the ability to modify the response
  to IR injury at various points along the pathway to injury.
