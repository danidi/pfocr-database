caption: Regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis. FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), plays
  a key role in flowering time induction by acting as a repressor of flowering. The
  expression of FLC is regulated by FRIGIDA, vernalization, autonomous pathways, and
  SWR1-C. FLC restricts flowering by directly repressing the key genes responsible
  for flowering including FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), FD, and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION
  OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1). The vernalization pathway promotes flowering in response to
  the prolonged exposure to cold temperature by turning off the FLC. Flowering can
  also be induced by age, photoperiod, and Gibberellic acid (GA). The photoperiod
  promotes flowering in response to day length. Additionally, miR156/miR172 also play
  a critical function in phase change by targeting the transcription factors SQUAMOSA
  PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) and APETALA2 (AP2) like genes.
