caption: Protein-protein connection networks among the eight genes involved in PPARG-MI
  signaling pathways. The network was built using Pathway Studio (http://www.pathwaystudio.com).
  One or more references supported each relationship within the network. + represents
  positive regulation; -| is negative.
