caption: The two main pathways for metabolism of estrogens are 16α-hydroxylation and
  2-hydroxylation. The major estrogen metabolites excreted in urine are the parent
  estrone (E1) and 17β-estradiol (E2), 2-hydroxy products [2-hydroxyesterone (2-OHE1),
  2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2), 2-methoxyesterone (2-MeOE1)] and 16α-hydroxy products
  [estriol (E3) and 16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OHE1)] [] (). The 16α-metabolites are
  considered the dominant biologically active metabolites, while the 2-OHE1 is less
  estrogenic. The ratio of 2-OHE1/16α-OHE1 has been linked to reduced risk of breast
  cancer []. In a recent prostate cancer study, participants with elevated urinary
  2-OHE1/16α-OHE1 ratio (highest tertile) had a 40% non-significant reduction in prostate
  cancer risk when subjects with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value higher than
  4 ng/ml were excluded from the control group []. PSA concentrations are closely
  related to advanced age and prostate size [] and larger prostate size also correlates
  with estrogen concentrations []. A later case-control study, with a wider estrogen
  metabolite profile of only 14 prostate cancer cases, did not find differences in
  the concentration of estrogen metabolites but suggested that the oxidative pathway
  that leads to DNA adduct formation is more active in the prostate cancer group than
  in the control group [].
