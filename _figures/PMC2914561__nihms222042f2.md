caption: Similarities between translation control in CNS dendrites and PNS axons.
  Advances in our understanding of how translation can be controlled at distal sites
  in neurons has shown a number of parallels between translation control in CNS dendrites
  (which is linked to synaptic plasticity) and in PNS axons (which is linked to regeneration,
  repair and nociceptive plasticity). Both of these structures contain initiation
  factors (4E-BP and eIF4E), kinases that signal to initiation factors (mTOR and ERK),
  RNA binding proteins (FMRP and staufen), a diverse subset of mRNAs, miRNAs and miRNA
  pathway components (dicer and argonaute) and Golgi outposts for the proper processing
  of transmembrane and other proteins (TGN38 and GM130). Many of these components
  and related mechanisms have been experimentally linked to synaptic plasticity in
  CNS dendrites (red stars). Many of them have also been shown to be involved in PNS
  axon regeneration, repair and/or nociceptive plasticity (red stars).
