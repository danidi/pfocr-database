caption: LPS recognition by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Serum protein LBP (LPS-binding
  protein) binds monomer of LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and delivers it to a CD14
  molecule that can be either soluble or membrane-bound (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
  protein). CD14 transfers LPS to the ectodomain of the TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex
  which leads to homodimerization of TLR4. This change in conformation leads to dimerization
  of the cytoplasmic TIR-domain (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor) that provides a binding
  site for MyD88. This activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and transcription of various proinflammatory
  cytokines. In addition, the endocytosis of the LPS-TLR4/MD-2 complex leads to the
  TRIF-dependent signaling pathway that mediates the induction of interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) and type-1 interferons.
