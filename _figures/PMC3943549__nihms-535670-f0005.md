caption: 'Enzymes, transporters and metabolites involved in the 4 metabolic pathways
  from mitochondrial oxalacetate to cytosolic PEP. The charge valences of the metabolites
  that are used by the different transporters are listed as superscripts. The accounting
  is based on the number of protons equivalents generated (in green) or consumed (in
  red) by each of the metabolic steps. Synthesis of both ATP and GTP within the mitochondria
  was assumed to be equivalent to 3 protons, the transport of one ATP out of the mitochondria
  and glutamate into the mitochondria each consume one proton. Oxidation of mitochondrial
  NADH pumps 10 protons, while cytosolic translocates 6 via the glycerol-3-phosphate
  step since the malate aspartate shuttle is not available. Abbreviations: OAA, oxaloacetate;
  PEP, Phosphoenolpyruvate; CIC, citrate isocitrate transporter; DIC, dicarboxylate
  transporter; Asp, aspartate; αKG, α-ketoglutarate; Asp/Glu, aspartate glutamate
