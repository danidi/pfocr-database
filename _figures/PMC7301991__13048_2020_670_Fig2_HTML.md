caption: '①Gut microbiota can cause IR by affecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its
  receptor CD14(LPS-CD14; ②SCFAs protect intestinal barrier integrity and act on beta
  cells to promote insulin secretion, thus improving metabolism; ③Bile acids (BAs)
  are signaling molecules that regulate glucose metabolism and promote insulin sensitivity;
  ④The metabolic disorder of amino acids might aggravate IR by changing glucose metabolism
  or inducing inflammation;⑤A vicious cycle between hyperandrogenemia and IR in PCOS,
  thus promoting the occurrence and development of PCOS; ⑥Gut microbiota and its metabolites
  cause insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia by stimulating the secretion of gut-brain
  peptides and regulating inflammation pathway activation. LPS: lipopolysaccharide;
  SCFA: short-chain fatty acid; BCAA: branch-chain amino acid; BA: Bile acids'
