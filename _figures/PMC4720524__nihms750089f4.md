caption: Under iron deficiency, mammalian cells first activate the IRP1/2 pathway
  which brings iron into the cell from extracellular space, releases iron from intracellular
  stores, and reduces iron export. If iron deficiency is mild or short in duration,
  IRP1/2 are sufficient to restore iron balance. However, if after activation of IRP1/2,
  cellular iron levels are still low, iron conservation response is initiated through
  activation of TTP. TTP binds to the ARE in 3’UTR of target molecules and reduces
  cellular iron utilization through selective suppression of non-essential iron-consuming
  pathways. As a result, all iron that is available in the cell is used to support
  only those functions that are essential for survival.
