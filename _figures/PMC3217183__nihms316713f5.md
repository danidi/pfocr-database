caption: The signaling components of the RAS/MAPK pathway found to harbor activating
  mutations in various types of nevi and melanoma. Most commonly known are the BRAF
  mutations in acquired nevi, superficial spreading melanomas (SSM), and nodular melanomas
  (NM); HRAS mutations in Spitz nevi and Spitzoid lesions, NRAS mutations in congenital
  nevi, KIT alterations in acral and mucosal melanoma, and GNAQ and GNA11 mutations
  in ocular melanoma and blue nevi. Mutated GNAQ and GNA11 can alternatively activate
  MAPK. An approximate prevalence of each mutation is also listed for each type of
  lesion. Activation of this pathway triggers a cascade of events that eventually
  upregulates several transcription factors, including MITF, which plays a critical
  role in melanocyte survival and melanocytic neoplasia.
