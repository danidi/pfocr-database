caption: FimH, localized at the distal tips of type 1 pili, bind and cluster unspecified
  host receptors, possibly concentrated within lipid raft domains (green regions).
  This triggers a signaling cascade leading to localized rearrangements of F-actin
  (red), which in turn results in the envelopment and uptake of adherent UPEC. Once
  internalized, UPEC is trafficked into membrane-bound compartments. From here, undefined
  signals derived from the host environment (and possibly associated with the host
  cell differentiation state) trigger UPEC replication, resulting in the formation
  of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) and the eventual efflux of UPEC. Alternatively,
  UPEC enters a nonreplicating or viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state that can persist
  for days or weeks, possibly serving as a reservoir for subsequent recurrent acute
  infections. PIPs phosphoinositides.
