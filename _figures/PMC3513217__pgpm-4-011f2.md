caption: 'Schematic illustration of irinotecan disposition pathway. Irinotecan is
  activated to 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) by human carboxylesterase 1
  and 2 (hCE1 and hCE2), and SN-38 is subsequently detoxified by UGT1A1 to a β-glucuronide
  derivative, SN-38G. In addition, irinotecan undergoes CYP3A4-mediated oxidation
  to form the inactive metabolites 7-ethyl-10-(4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-peperidino)
  carbonyloxycamptothecin (APC) and 7-ethyl-10-(4-amino-1-peperidino) carbonyloxycamptothecin
  (NPC), and NPC also undergo a subsequent conversion by hCE2 to SN-38. Irinotecan
  and its metabolites (ie, SN-38 and SN-38G) are also transported by the ABC transporters
  including ABCB1, ABCC1/2, or ABCG2 or the organic anion transporting polypeptide
  1B1 (OATP1B1).Adapted and reprinted by permission from the American Association
