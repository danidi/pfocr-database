caption: Schematic presentation of the biosynthetic pathway leading from (R)-reticuline
  to morphine in the opium poppy. Along the biosynthetic pathway from (R)-reticuline
  to morphine, salutaridine synthase catalyzes the first step, the C-C phenol-coupling
  of (R)-reticuline to salutaridine. The genes encoding the two subsequent enzymes,
  salutaridine reductase and salutaridinol acetyltransferase as well as the penultimate
  gene in the pathway encoding codeinone reductase have been characterized (, , ).
