caption: '(A) In C. elegans PVD neurons, dendritic growth cone MTOCs give rise to
  two distinct populations of polymerizing microtubules: plus-ends-out microtubules
  that invade the tip, and minus-ends-out microtubules that create the specialist
  polarity organization of the dendrite. This MTOC consists of γ-TuRC organized around
  a population of RAB11-positive endosomes. When the MTOC is mislocalized to the soma,
  all microtubules in the dendrite are now plus-ends-out. (B) Sites of MTOC activity
  in late stage neurons, illustrated for the combined data from multiple studies in
  Drosophila da neurons. (i) A subset of Golgi outposts is associated with γ-Tub,
  and unidirectional microtubule generation is promoted from some. (ii) In the mature
  neuron, Golgi mediated microtubule generation is principally from stacks in the
  soma. These generate a population of polymerizing microtubules that exclusively
  invade the axon. Golgi may also act as local site of microtubule generation at the
  branchpoints of a nascent branch. (iii) γ-Tub is localized at Rab5-positive endosomes
  at dendrite branchpoints. γ-TuRC-TPs and components of the Wnt signaling pathway
  are required for microtubule generation activity at these positions.'
