caption: Metabolic changes in cancer-associated neutrophils. Neutrophils, which possess
  few mitochondria, are reliant on glycolysis to generate ATP to fuel effector functions
  such as phagocytosis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and NETosis. In cancer,
  neutrophils upregulate oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid transporters
  to mediate many neutrophil functions; including migration and T cell suppression.
  Under nutrient limiting conditions, such as low glucose, neutrophils can reprogram
  their metabolism to break down fatty acids or utilize certain amino acids (glutamate,
  proline) to fuel pro-tumorigenic/pro-metastatic functions. PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; GLUT, glucose transporter; MCT, Monocarboxylate transporter 1; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; FATP2, fatty acid transport protein 2; AA, arachidonic acid; PGE2, prostaglandin
  E2.
