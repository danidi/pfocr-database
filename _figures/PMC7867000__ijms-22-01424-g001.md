caption: Canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway. RNA polymerase II transcribes DNA of
  interest into pri-miRNA containing ~80 nucleotides (nts). The Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessing
  complex cleaves pri-miRNA into pre-miRNA which contains ~65 nts. The Ran-GTP/Exportin-5
  complex binds to pre-miRNA and exports it from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Dicer
  aids in unwinding and transforming pre-miRNA into an miRNA duplex. The miRNA duplex
  is then further processed by RISC and Ago2 into mature miRNA containing ~22 nts.
  Then the miRNA-induced silencing complex miRISC either causes cleavage and degradation
  or translational repression of its target mRNA.
