caption: GPR and HDAC co-regulation network related to epithelium growth. The functions
  of the first neighbors were predicted by the KEGG pathway analysis. The genes colored
  in red were the genes that were significantly upregulated after 4 weeks of 30% NFC
  feeding, and the genes colored in blue were the significantly downregulated genes
  after 4 weeks of 30% NFC feeding. The signaling pathways regulating the same functions
  are given with the same line shapes in connection with the corresponding functions.
  Blue lines indicate that the largest number of signaling pathways was regulated
  by PLCG1
