caption: Positive stringent response of the ilv-leu operon to amino acid (lysine)
  starvation involves two molecular mechanisms. As shown at the top, when B. subtilis
  cells grow in MM medium containing glucose and glutamine and supplemented with 16
  amino acids, the CodY protein interacting with GTP and branched-chain amino acids,
  corepressors of CodY, represses the transcription from the ilv-leu promoter through
  interference of RNAP entry to it by the complex. As shown at the bottom, when cells
  are subjected to lysine starvation, the RelA protein synthesizes (p)ppGpp from GTP.
  The promoter (p)ppGpp inhibits IMP dehydrogenase, forming XMP in the de novo synthesis
  pathway starting from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), resulting in lowering
  of the in vivo GMP and subsequent GTP concentrations. On the other hand, addition
  of decoyinine to the same medium causes the inhibition of GMP synthase without the
  production of (p)ppGpp, resulting in lowering of the in vivo GMP and subsequent
  GTP concentrations. The lowering of the GTP concentration most likely causes relief
  from CodY repression of the ilv-leu promoter (mechanism 1), whereas lowering of
  the GTP concentration as well as raising of the ATP and CTP concentrations likely
  causes the activation of the transcription from the ilv-leu promoter catalyzed by
  RNAP (mechanism 2).
