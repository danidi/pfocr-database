caption: TNF stimulation leads to activation of the canonical NF-κB signal transduction
  pathway marked by IκBα degradation and translocation of the p65-p50 dimer to the
  nucleus. Subsequent NF-κB DNA binding enables transcription of different genes,
  among which the cytokine IL-6. Venom treatment leads to the inhibition of TNF induced
  IL-6 gene expression. In addition, TNF activates the MAPKs,JNK, ERK1/2 and p38,
  and pretreatment with venom results in prolonged JNK activation. The negative NF-κB
  regulators A20 and IκBα are indicated and both were suppressed by the venom. Glucocorticoid
  binding to the cytosolic Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) results in the dissociation
  of chaperoning proteins, followed by GR translocation to the nucleus, where it can
  interfere with the activity of NF-κB. Activated GR can also directly bind to the
  DNA, stimulating transcription of FKBP5, MKP1 and GILZ target genes. Only the two
  latter genes are transcriptionally induced by the venom. The red arrows mark the
  various levels at which venom of N. vitripennis interferes with the represented
  cellular signaling pathways.
