caption: The extracellular parts of TLRs are activated after binding with ligands,
  and the conformation changes lead to convergence of downstream molecules, which
  triggers the signaling pathway and induced the up-regulation and activation of cytokines,
  chemokines, and other co-stimulatory factors. With the exception of TLR3, all TLRs
  initiate MyD88 through the expressed MyD88 or simultaneous bridging MAL, and then
  activate the NF-kB and MAPK through tandem reactions, which induces the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, etc. The overexpression
  of both TRIF and TRAM or TRIF alone initiated the TRIF dependent pathway, the TRIF
  dependent pathway activates IFN regulatory factors and mediates the production of
  type I IFNs. In addition, the activation of TLR4 is related to both pathways.
