caption: Comparison of results with the known response pathway. This comparison reveals
  that of the 18 known genes expected to be found in this screen, 15 were recovered
  (red labels); three core genes were missed (gray labels). Thirteen genes are pathway
  inhibitors (blue labels) whose corresponding deletion strains shmoo. Ten known pathway
  genes are absent from the deletion collection (green labels). Of the 15 putative
  additional genes found, nine (black labels, boxed) could be associated with the
  core pathway via protein interactions or mRNA coexpression with intermediates (pink
  labels, boxed). Four network-implicated intermediates (orange labels, boxed) were
  also found in the initial cell-chip screen, though not reconfirmed. Bold arrows
  mark the canonical signal transduction cascade leading to transcriptional changes.
  Thin black arrows indicate activation; barred lines indicate inhibition; dotted
  lines indicate functional genomics linkages [40]. Genes with asterisks are also
  implicated in filamentous growth [54].
