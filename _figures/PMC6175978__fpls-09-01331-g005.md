caption: Metabolome analyses of wild-type and mutants plants. Wild-type and mutant
  plants impaired in the TPT and/or XPT were grown for 3 weeks under HL-conditions
  (PFD = 300 μmol⋅m-2⋅s-1) in the long-day. Samples for metabolite extractions were
  taken either at about the middle of the dark period (i.e., 5 h in the dark), at
  the beginning of the light period (i.e., 1 h in the light), or in the middle of
  the light period (i.e., 8 h in the light). The small heatmaps for each metabolite
  and the color scheme for the log2-ratios are defined under ‘Samples and Conditions’.
  The background colors in the metabolic sketch highlight aspects of various pathways,
  i.e., light green, reactions specific for the Calvin-Benson cycle including initial
  reactions of photorespiration; light blue, reactions of the OPPP and the overlap
  with the Calvin-Benson cycle; light cyan, reactions of photorespiration; light brown,
  glycolysis and TCA cycle as well as aspects of amino acid biosynthesis; light grey,
  carbohydrate metabolism. The colors of the arrows incidate more specifically reactions
  of individual pathways or groups of pathways, i.e., green, Calvin-Benson cycle and
  photorespiration; dark red, oxidative part of the OPPP; dark blue, regenerative
  part of the OPPP and Calvin-Benson cycle; blue, carbohydrate metabolism; red glycolysis
  and TCA; purple, amino acid metabolism including the shikimate pathway. The metabolites
  in black letters have been determined by GC-MS or LC-MS/MS whereas the grey-lettered
  metabolites indicate important intermediates that have not been determined. All
  phosphorylated metabolites, ATP and AMP, as well as Asn and Trp were determined
  by LC-MS/MS, all remaining metabolites were determined by GC-MS. Please note that,
  for the sake of clarity, compartmentation has been omitted. The data represent the
  mean ± SE of n = 3 to 5 replicates. The metabolite contents at each time point of
  the day are contained in Supplementary Tables ,  with a statistical analysis in
  , .
