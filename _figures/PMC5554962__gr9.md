caption: 'Involvement of RIP1 in the Major Antiviral Innate Immune Signaling Pathways
  Affecting Baculovirus Transgene ExpressionAccording to the KEGG pathway database
  and several reports,, ,  RIP1 is upstream of TBK1 and a common mediator of the TLR-,
  RIG-I-, and cytosolic DNA-sensing receptor signaling pathways. It is not known whether
  RIP1 is involved in the NOD signaling pathway. Knockdown of NOD signaling pathway
  genes also increases baculovirus transgene expression (this study). In previous
  studies, the innate immune response-related cytosolic DNA-sensing receptor, RLR,
  and TLR3 were responsive to baculovirus transduction in mammalian cells. RIP1 also
  plays roles in regulation of the cytosolic DNA-sensing, RLR, and TLR3 pathways.
  Silencing of RIP1 blocks the activation of downstream mediators (TBK1 and IRF3/7)
  and affects the expression of interferons and cytokines (IFN-β and IL-6 in this
  study), which consequently enhances baculovirus transgene expression. Furthermore,
  silencing of each component (; #1) in these pathways also enhanced baculoviral transgene
  expression, demonstrating the importance of these receptors in viral transgene regulation.
  Moreover, silencing of RIP1 did not have severe effects on cell viability, making
  it a promising candidate in applications of baculovirus transgene expression. #1,
