caption: (A) Schematic of pseudopod extension for all stains and conditions. An excitable

  pseudopod inhibits the start of a new pseudopod A-fold. The pseudopod extends at
  a rate v, thereby -with time t- reaching a larger size s. The STOP of the pseudopod
  is mediated by processes that depends on a combination of rate, time and size; together

  STOP; see text for details. Panels D-G presents the outcome of mutant analysis in
  Dictyostelium. (E) The extending pseudopod. In Dictyostelium a Ras-bF-actin-excitable
  system triggers pseudopod extension by activating Rac1 and the Scar complex, which
  induces Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation and branching; scar-null cells stop prematurely.

  plasma membrane consisting of parallel F-actin filaments (pF-actin), myosin filament
  and additional F-actin-binding proteins; formins stimulate and stabilize the pF-actin/myosin
  structure. Branched-F-actin is not easily formed in a strong cortex. Observations
  reveal that an extending pseudopod very fast generates an unknown global signal
  X that inhibits new pseudopods. This inhibition requires RacE and the pF-actin/formin/myosin
  cortex (cluster a in S7 Fig in ). (G) The uropod. In Dictyostelium, a cGMP-based
  signaling pathway activates the interaction between myosin filaments and pF-actin
  filaments, leading to contraction of the uropod. Pseudopods that extend at a very
  high rate stop prematurely in cells with a very strong uropod (cluster b in S7 Fig
  in ). In mammalian cells the three major components of the cell -pseudopod, cortex
  and uropod- play similar roles as in Dictyostelium, but the excitable system in
  panel E may have other small GTP-proteins such as CDC42, and the uropod in panel
  G is not regulated by cGMP but by the Rho-kinase Rock.
