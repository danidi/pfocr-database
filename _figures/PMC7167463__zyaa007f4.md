caption: Hypothesized signaling model showing how signals associated with IL-8, CCL2,
  and interstitial flow (IF) activate a common regulator, both individually and in
  combination, to regulate macrophage migration directedness and speed. The input
  stimuli (IL-8, CCL2 and IF), associated cytokine receptors (CXCR1/2 and CCR2), and
  intermediary signaling species (S1–S8), including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and
  heterotrimeric small G proteins, G(α, β, γ), are identified by their respective
  abbreviations and species variables ( and Equations [–] in section ‘Mathematical
  model development’). These elements contribute toward interconnected signaling pathway
  reactions (reaction numbers R1–R7).
