caption: The asparagine-linked glycosylation pathway. The biosynthesis of lipid-linked
  oligosaccharide (LLO) is catalyzed by a series of glycosyltransferases encoded by
  asparagine-linked glycosylation (ALG) genes. The buildup of the glycan is initiated
  at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine
  (GlcNAc)-phosphate to dolichol-phosphate (Dol-P) from nucleotide-activated UDP-GlcNAc.
  After the addition of a second GlcNAc residue to Dol-PP-GlcNAc, five mannoses (Man)
  are attached from GDP-Man to the LLO. After translocation into the ER lumen, four
  additional Man from Dol-P-Man and three glucoses are added from Dol-P-Glc. The oligosaccharide
  is then transferred en bloc to asparagine side chains of nascent polypeptides by
  the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). The synthesis of dolichol and dolichol-bound
  monosaccharide precursors as well as proposed models for dolichol recycling are
  discussed in detail in the text.
