caption: ADB-FUBINACA suggested metabolic pathway. M20 accurate mass and fragmentation
  pattern suggest the loss of four hydrogen atoms and the addition of an oxygen on
  ADB-FUBINACA dimethylbutanamide moiety but its structure was not fully elucidated.
  Bold arrow, major pathway; gluc, glucuronide.
