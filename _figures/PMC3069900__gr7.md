caption: Summary of a putative pathway that regulates FGF-2–mediated wound repair
  through the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. The TGF-β promotes the phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3, resulting in VIC wound repair. Betaglycan binds endogenous TGF-β, resulting
  in less available TGF-β to bind to its signaling receptors. The FGF-2 also binds
  betaglycan, which makes more TGF-β available for receptor signaling.
