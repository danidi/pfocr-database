caption: 'The aspartate family pathway leading to lysine, methionine and threonine.
  Key enzymes and amino acids in the pathway are specified. Inserts are the relative
  expression level of OsDHPS, OsDAPD, OsLRK/SDH, OsCGS, OsMGL, OsTS, and OsTD in PA110
  and wild-type at 5 DAF and 15 DAF. Abbreviations: AK, aspartate kinase; DHPS, dihydrodipicolinate
  synthase; HSD, homoserine dehydrogenase; DAPD, diaminopimelate decarboxylase; LKR,
  Lys-ketoglutarate reductase; SDH, saccharopine dehydrogenase; CGS, cystathionine
  γ-synthase; TS, threonine synthase; MGL, methionine γ-lyase; TD, threonine dehydratase.
  Solid arrows indicate the flow of metabolic processes. Arrows with dashed lines
  indicate allosteric product feedback inhibition [Modified from [, ]]'
