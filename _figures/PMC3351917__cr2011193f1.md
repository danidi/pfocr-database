caption: Activity of the ERK1/2 MAPK cascade can be modulated by inputs at different
  sites in the pathway. The best studied mechanism of ERK1/2 activation is through
  receptor tyrosine kinases. Signaling events at the plasma membrane initiate the
  cascade through ligand/receptor binding. The signal is transmitted by recruiting
  adaptor proteins (e.g., Grb2) and exchange factors (e.g., SOS) that induce the activation
  of Ras at the plasma membrane. The activated, GTP-bound Ras then transmits the signal
  by activating Raf protein kinases (MAP3Ks). Rafs activate MEK1/2 through phosphorylation,
  which in turn phosphorylate ERK1/2. Once activated, ERK1/2 propagate the signal
  by affecting a variety of downstream signaling pathways. Additional components that
  can provide inputs to the cascade are shown including a KSR-associated AKAP and
  the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin.
