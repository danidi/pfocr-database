caption: Signaling Pathways Involved in the Regulation of Flowering by Photoperiod
  in Arabidopsis.A diagram showing the putative relationships among genes involved
  in the photoperiod pathway. On the basis of the phenotypes of known mutants, genes
  shown in red generally repress flowering, whereas those in green promote it. Small
  upright arrows indicate the role of the genes as determined by overexpression in
  transgenic plants. Arrows between genes represent a promotive effect, whereas perpendicular
  lines represent a repressive effect, and simple lines represent protein–protein
  interactions. Arrows from the clock indicate that the expression of the gene is
  circadian clock controlled. Arrows to the clock indicate that the gene lengthens
  period length, while perpendicular lines indicate that it shortens period length.
  Numbers between brackets refer to the following publications, which support the
  indications provided in the diagram. (1) () (2) () (3) () (4) () (5) () (6) () (7)
