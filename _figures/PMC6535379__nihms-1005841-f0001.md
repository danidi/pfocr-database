caption: 'Signaling pathways involved on induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
  The misfolded proteins can be degraded through proteasomal ERAD pathway. However,
  accumulation of misfolded proteins activates three ER stress sensors: activating
  transcription factor-6 (ATF6), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease
  1 (IRE1), and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) kinase (PERK). Activation of IRE1 leads to splicing
  of XBP1-mRNA and the spliced XBP1 accumulated inside the nucleus and activates gene
  expression that is required for ERAD pathway. In the Golgi apparatus, ATF6 can be
  cleaved by S1P or S2P. The fragmented ATF6a translocate to the nucleus and function
  as a transcription factor to synthesize mRNA for ER chaperones and XBP1. On ER stress,
  PERK phosphorylates and dimerizes; the activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α to shut
  down protein synthesis and increases the expression of ATF4, which translocates
  to the nucleus to function as a transcription factor to synthesize mRNA for ER-chaperones
  and GADD34, which blocks ATF4 in a feedback loop.'
