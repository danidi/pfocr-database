caption: 'Pathways of apoptosis: In response to nitrosative stress either by activation
  of death receptors (extrinsic) or through the initiation of genotoxic insults that
  increase pro-apoptotic molecules such as p53 and Bax, the mitochondrial membrane
  becomes permeable, releasing cytochrome c. Proteins such as Apaf1 and caspase-9
  are activated, resulting in the formation of a death complex or apoptosome. Formation
  of the apoptosome stimulates the activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3,
  -6 and -7, leading to apoptotic cell death. This pathway may also be stimulated
  extrinsically through the formation of truncated Bid (tBid), which transduces these
  signals to cause increased permeabilization of the mitochondrion. On the other hand,
  in response to external nitrosative stressor stimulated through binding of death
  receptors such as Fas/DR4/TNFR to their respective ligands, proteins such as TRAF
  and FADD/TRADD are recruited to the receptor to form a death-inducing signaling
  complex. Caspase-8 is recruited to the DISC, leading to its processing and subsequent
  activation of effector caspases, leading to apoptosis. In addition, Bid is also
  activated, which transduces these death signals to the intrinsic pathway. Proteins
  that have a protective effect (pro-survival) upon S-nitrosation are highlighted
  in green, whereas those that have pro-apoptotic effects upon S-nitrosation are highlighted
  in red. Proteins that have been reported to have dual effects are indicated in orange.'
