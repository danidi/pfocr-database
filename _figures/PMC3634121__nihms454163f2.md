caption: 'Left: wild-type signaling. In most cells the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase
  (MAPK) pathway is tightly regulated by ligand-dependent activation of receptor tyrosine
  kinases, which signal through any of 3 RAS family GTPases (N-, K-, and H-RAS, depending
  on the cell type). RAS-GTP in turn triggers dimerization and activation of RAF family
  tyrosine kinases (A-, B-, and C-RAF), leading to activation of the downstream proliferative
  signaling pathway. Middle: Oncogenic BRAF signaling. The BRAFV600E mutation promotes
  kinase activity as a monomer and independent of RAS regulation, leading to potent
  and constitutive activation of the pathway. Such cells may be highly responsive
  to BRAF inhibitor therapy. Right: Secondary KRAS mutation. A KRASG12D mutation locks
  KRAS in the GTP-bound (ON) configuration, independent of receptor tyrosine kinase
  regulation. Oncogenic KRAS activates multiple downstream pathways regulating proliferation
  and survival (not shown here). Among other effects, it may bypass inhibition of
  BRAFV600E by BRAF inhibitors, through stimulating dimerization of other RAF family
  members, leading to downstream activation of the MAPK pathway.'
