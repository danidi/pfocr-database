caption: 'EPM: Epimorphin. Unlike the control groups on PLL, cell contact with EPM
  showed a rapid induction of focal adhesions of which αvβ1 integrin, the EPM receptor,
  is one of the components. Our results showed that EPM had an effect on stress fiber
  alignment, MO and bile duct-like structure formation, when compared with the PLL
  control. Proof of the effects on MO and DF were given in our EPM neutralizing experiments.
  FA: Focal adhesion. Stress fibers in the cytoplasm are connected to the β1 integrin-containing
  FA on the cellular membrane. Our data and those of others suggest that blockade
  of αvβ1 integrin results in disoriented spindles  and a loss of key processes in
  cyst formation . FAK and Src, as components of focal adhesion, are downstream molecules
  in the EPM biochemical signaling pathway . SF: Stress fiber. The guidance of MO
  by a patterned EPM protein can be blocked by La-A, which suggests an important role
  of SFO in guiding the mitosis orientation of WB cells. The fact that the high correlation
  between MO and the uniaxial static stretch direction can be blocked by La-A provides
  additional evidence that the SFO determines MO. Disassembly of stress fibers can
  also block the duct formation induced by EPM. MO: Mitosis orientation. Radisky et
  al. proposed that EPM might be involved in duct formation by guiding MO . The present
  study shows that all MO blockers used in our experiments (EPM neutralizing antibody,
  β1 integrin neutralizing antibody, and La-A) can also suppress the bile duct-like
  structure formation induced by EPM. DF: Duct formation. In vivo results demonstrated
  that EPM is involved in bile duct formation in CCl4-injured or healthy adult mice
  (). Our analysis indicates that these ducts are biliary ducts rather than hepatocytic
  ducts ().'
