caption: Fasciola hepatica modulates macrophage activation. F. hepatica ES, F. hepatica
  tegumental antigens (FhTeg), and ES-derived enzymes, such as thioredoxin peroxidase
  (Tpx), 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (Prx), and heme-oxygenase-1 (AO-1) drive Mo phenotype
  toward an alternative activation profile. Fatty acid binding protein (Fh12) binds
  the co-receptor CD14 and inhibits LPS-induced TLR4 activation, suppressing the expression
  of IL-12, TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β. F. hepatica Cathepsin L1 (FheCL1) induces TLR3 degradation,
  which impairs LPS-induced TLR4–TRIF-dependent pathway with the consequent inhibition
  of inflammatory cytokine production. The decrease of an inflammatory cytokine milieu
  might promote the inhibition of a Th1 type response favoring a Th2 profile. F. hepatica
  defense molecule 1 (FhHDM-1) has been shown to have the ability to destabilize lysosomal
  acidification, which impairs Mo NLRP3 activation and consequently inflammasome function,
  resulting in the downregulation of IL-1 β production.
