caption: Chemerin/GPR1 signaling suppresses progesterone synthesis and secretion during
  follicle/corpus luteum development and luteolysis in mice. (A) Chemerin could suppress
  progesterone synthesis through its receptor GPR1 during follicle and corpus luteum
  development in mice, the process go through PI3K pathway and effect some key enzymes
  such as StAR, P450scc, and 3-HSD in the synthesis of progesterone. (B) PGF2α lead
  to caspase-3, highly expressed, further induced luteolysis and progesterone level
  significantly decreased. Chemerin cooperate with this process through its receptor
  GPR1.
