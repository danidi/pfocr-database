caption: Pathway analysis of representative genes that responded to [BF/S+L/Ep] treatment.
  A prototypical cell was constructed from 37 representative genes that responded
  to treatment with [BF/S+L/Ep] in vitro from 4 h to 12 h. A, Genes whose expression
  was up-regulated (more than doubled) are colored red, and those whose expression
  was down-regulated (to less than half) are shown in green. Selected regions of the
  network highlight several groups of genes. Group 1, Immune response related genes.
  Group 2, Adhesion molecules and cytoskeleton; cell movement related genes. Group
  3, Cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis related genes. Gene networks were
  analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathways program. B, The TRANSPATH Professional 7.1
  database was searched to assess possible signaling pathways, networks or potential
  interactions among the responsive genes/target molecules in DCs treated with [BF/S+L/Ep].
  The 37 genes that were up- or down-regulated at least 2-fold compared to controls
  were analyzed. Specifically, connections (hits) within 7 genes were employed as
  the parameter for the current search. Five postulated key molecules/pathways; JNK2
  (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 2), PP2C-α (protein phosphatase 2C-alpha), AKT (protein
  kinase B), ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase) and MAPKAPK (MAPK-activated
  protein kinase 2) that may be activated by [BF/S+L/Ep] treatment are predicted with
  arrows. The green rhombuses indicate the upstream transcription factors of responsive
  genes.
