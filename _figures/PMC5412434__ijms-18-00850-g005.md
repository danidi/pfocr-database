caption: Panx1- and Cx-dependent mechanisms leading to platelet aggregation. Upon
  GPVI binding to collagen, Src phosphorylation occurs, which permits opening of Panx1
  channels and ATP release from platelets. ATP activates P2X1 purinergic receptors,
  enhancing intracellular calcium concentration and therefore platelet activation
  and aggregation. Apart from classical anti-platelet drugs targeting signaling pathways
  linked to ADP and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptors, Panx1 inhibitors (FDA approved
  compounds are indicated in bold) mefloquine (Mfq), probenecid (Pbn), carbenoxolone
  (Cbx), Brilliant blue FCF and the specific peptide 10Panx1 have demonstrated inhibitory
  effects on collagen-induced aggregation (see also ). The role of Cxs in platelet
  aggregation remains to be further clarified. Two pathways are thought to play a
  role in platelet aggregation. The first one would occur after stable platelet contact
  is established, allowing formation of gap junctions and cAMP trafficking between
  adjacent platelets. cAMP has a regulatory role, inhibiting further platelet recruitment
  and thrombus growth. The second mechanism would involve inhibition of Cx hemichannels,
  resulting in diminution of the aggregation response through an as yet undefined
  pathway. It has been proposed, but not yet proven, that Cx hemichannels may act
  in a similar fashion as Panx1, thus activating P2X1 receptors via the release of
  ATP from intracellular space.
