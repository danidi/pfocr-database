caption: 'Insulin binds extracellular α-subunits of the insulin receptor (IR), leading
  to dimerization and autophosphorylation of β-subunits and activation of its kinase
  activity. The IR phosphorylates select tyrosine residues (pY) on insulin receptor
  substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, leading to exposure of binding sites for signalling
  partners. IRS1 and IRS2 recruit and activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
  complex, which then phosphorylates and activates AKT, the major node of the insulin
  signalling cascade, as well as protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) and PKCλ. Activated AKT
  has many downstream effects: of greatest relevance to systemic glucose control,
  AKT phosphorylates AKT substrate of 160 kDa (AS160; also known as TBC1D4), which
  controls the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane
  for uptake of glucose into muscle, adipose and some neurons. AKT-mediated activation
  of mTOR and the downstream targets of mTOR serves to regulate protein and lipid
  synthesis and many aspects of cell metabolism, growth, survival and autophagy. Phosphorylation
  of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) by AKT inhibits the constitutive activity
  of this key kinase. GSK3β has many protein substrates, such as glycogen synthase,
  β-catenin, microtubule-associated proteins (including tau), intermediate filaments,
  cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and others. Through these diverse
  proteins, insulin and GSK3β signalling play important parts in the regulation of
  cellular proliferation, migration, glucose regulation, apoptosis and neuroplasticity.
  AKT kinase activity also directly activates proteins such as inhibitor of nuclear
  factor-κB kinase (IKK), CREB and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mdm2 (MDM2) to regulate
  transcription, cytokine production and cell survival, and it directly inhibits selected
  proteins, including regulators of apoptosis (Bcl2-associated agonist of cell death
  (BAD) and caspase 9 (CASP9)) and Forkhead box protein (FOX) transcription factors.
  Independent of IRS1 and IRS2 and AKT, IR kinase activity initiates the activation
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is especially important
  for regulating the transcription of CREB, Myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC) and ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase 2 (RSK2; also known as S6Kα3), affecting cell proliferation, differentiation,
  innate and adaptive immune function and neuroplasticity. Importantly, AKT, GSK3β,
  mTOR and MAPK themselves provide feedback autoregulation of IRS1 and IRS2, inhibiting
  their activity through site-specific serine phosphorylation. 4EBP, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E binding protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; EIF4G, eukaryotic
