caption: Mechanisms by which agents that generate ROS interact with MDA-7/IL-24 to
  kill kidney cancer cells. As a single agent, MDA-7/IL-24 kills tumor cells by generating
  ceramide that in turn promotes elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, which in turn
  promotes increased ROS levels. Increased ceramide (via lipid rafts), Ca2+, and ROS
  by altering CD95 phosphorylation and through unknown mechanisms all also independently
  facilitate activation of CD95 (extrinsic pathway). Activation of the extrinsic pathway
  through caspase 8/BID cleavage causes kidney cancer cell killing by promoting mitochondrial
  dysfunction. The drugs 17AAG and 4HPR both enhance signaling proximal to MDA-7/IL-24
  to “boost” the established MDA-7/IL-24 pro-apoptotic pathway. The drug As2O3 (heavier
  arrows) acts distally to ceramide resulting in increased ROS levels that increases
  Ca2+ levels, again with MDA-7/IL-24 –induced ceramide combining with elevated ROS
  and Ca2+ levels to activate CD95 and cause tumor cell killing.
