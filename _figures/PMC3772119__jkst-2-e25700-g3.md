caption: Figure 3. Roles of JAK-STAT signaling in gut homeostasis. (A) Under physiological
  conditions, Upd is expressed by visceral muscles (VM), enteroblasts (EB), and intestinal
  stem cells (ISC). Basal activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in ISCs and EBs allows
  ISC renewal and differentiation of EBs into enteroendocrine cells (EE) or enterocytes
  (EC). (B) Upon ingestion of pathogenic bacteria, the Imd pathway is activated in
  ECs, leading to the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Bacterial infection
  also results in the production of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
  the gut lumen, which induces cell damage and EC apoptosis. Upd3, and to a lower
  extent, Upd2 produced in apoptotic ECs induce both ISC proliferation and EB differentiation,
  in order to regenerate gut epithelium. The cells in which JAK-STAT signaling is
  required to stimulate ISC proliferation and the role of EGF-R signaling in this
  process remain to be firmly established. The position of the peritrophic and basal
  membranes (pm and bm respectively) is indicated on the left.
