caption: Potential pathways for biosynthesis of IAA and secondary metabolites IGs
  and camalexin in plant and microbe. The key intermediate product for each tryptophan
  (Trp)-dependent IAA biosynthesis pathway is boxed. Enzymes for which plant genes
  are identified are in blue; enzymes for which microbial genes are identified are
  in green; enzymes for which both plant and microbe genes are identified are in black.
  A question mark indicates that the enzyme is unknown. Dashed arrows indicate that
  the conversion needs to be accomplished in more than one step. IAM, indoleacetamide;
  IaaM, Trp-2-monooxygenase; AMI, amidohydrolase; IaaH, IAM hydrolase; IPA, indole-3-pyruvic
  acid; IPDC, indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase; IAAld, indole-3-acetaldehyde; AAO,
  aldehyde oxidase; TAM, tryptamine; YUCCA, flavin monooxygenase (FMO)-like enzyme;
  IAOx, indole-3-acetaldoxime; IAN, indole-3-acetonitrile; NIT, nitrilase; TSO, Trp
  side-chain oxidase.
