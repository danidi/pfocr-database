caption: Role of autophagy in nutrient-sensitive longevity pathways in the nematode
  C. elegans. (A) Multiple conserved longevity pathways extend life span in C. elegans
  by upregulating autophagy. Highlighted in blue is the germline signaling pathway,
  in which removal of germline stem cells extends the life span of adult worms. Germline
  loss can be achieved by laser ablation of germline precursor cells in the worm larvae,
  or by genetic mutation. (B) Model of the mechanism by the germline signaling pathway
  extends life span in C. elegans by coordinately regulating LIPL-4-mediated lipolysis
  and autophagy. These processes are likely regulated by the common upstream regulator
  TOR through the forkhead transcription factors DAF-16/FoxO and PHA/FoxA. These two
  transcription factors regulate lipid metabolism and autophagy, respectively. This
  model is modified from Lapierre et al., Curr Biol 2011.
