caption: 'Schematic diagram of autophagy process. (A) Current model of the cellular
  events involved in autophagic pathway, include membrane nucleation, elongation and
  completion of autophagosome, and maturation of autolysosome. In response to nutrient
  starvation, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex dissociates from the
  unc-51 like-kinase 1 or 2 (ULK1 or ULK2) complex, leading to dephosphorylation,
  activation, and translocation of ULK1/2 complex to ER. Then the ER-localized ULK1/2
  complex activates the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (class III-PI3K)
  complex, leading to generation of PtdIn(3)P which recruits double-FYVE-containing
  protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD-repeat domain PtdIns(3)P-interacting (WIPI) proteins onto
  the isolation membrane of ER, also called omegasome. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation
  systems including ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L and ATG4-ATG3-LC3II pathways are coordinated
  with the elongation and enclosure of autophagosome. Finally, the autophagosome fuses
  with lysosome, and the sequestrated materials are degraded in the autolysosome.
  (B) Ubiquitin-like conjugation cascades of ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L and ATG4-ATG3-LC3II.
  Upper panel: ATG12 is first activated by ATG7 (E1-like enzyme) through the formation
  of thioester bonding between the C-terminal glycine of ATG12 and the active site
  cysteine residue of ATG7 in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. Then the activated
  ATG12 is transferred to ATG10 (E2-like enzyme) via a thioesterification reaction,
  and finally forms a conjugate with ATG5. The ATG5-ATG12 conjugate interacts with
  ATG16 to form an ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 complex. Bottom panel: LC3 is processed by the
  cysteine protease ATG4, resulting in exposure of the C-terminal glycine of LC3.
  The exposed glycine of LC3 is activated by ATG7 (E1-like enzyme), transferred to
  ATG3 (E2-like enzyme), and then covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
  to form the lipidated form of LC3, i.e., LC3-II. The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L is present
  on the outer membrane, and LC3II is present on both the inner and outer membranes
  of autophagosome.'
