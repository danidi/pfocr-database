caption: BDNF-related PPI network. The PPI of BDNF and NARG2 through EVAVL1 interacts
  with UBC to cascade the molecular function of cell cycle. Genome-wide association
  studies indicate significance for the SNP in the ELAVL2 gene associated with schizophrenia.
  The ELAVL family of RNA-binding proteins regulates gene expression with the implication
  of biological processes of cancer, and plays an important role in schizophrenia.
  The KIAA0101 gene interacts with NFkappaB which is important in the BDNF pathway.
  KIAA0101 is critical in modulating schizophrenic pathway.
