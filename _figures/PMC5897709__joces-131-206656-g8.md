caption: Proposed model for EGFR-dependent kinase cascade and feedback loop during
  E-cadherin force transduction. Force-loading E-cadherin bonds results in the EGFR-dependent
  activation of PI3K and downstream activation of integrins at the basal plane (),
  as well as α-catenin unfurling. Results in this study suggest that integrin activation
  downstream from perturbed E-cadherin receptors, in turn, triggers the activation
  of Abl, which is required for VCL targeting to unfurled α-catenin at stressed E-cadherin
  junctions. This mechanosensitive pathway thus couples force-activated E-cadherin-mediated
  signaling to rapid and early VCL targeting to cadherin junctions. This positive-feedback
  loop, which reinforces stressed E-cadherin adhesions, requires EGFR kinase activity
  and integrin activation.
