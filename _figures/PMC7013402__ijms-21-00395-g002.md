caption: 'The Greatwall- Endosulphin Alpha (ENSA) pathway in the control of G1 and
  G0. Left panels, in blue (Saccharomyces cerevisiae): During growth on rich nitrogen
  and carbon sources, the TORC1 and PKA pathways repress Rim15, and PP2A-B55Cdc55
  dephosphorylates and prevents Gis1-mediated transcription of quiescence genes. Upon
  TORC1 and PKA inhibition, Rim15 is activated and phosphorylates Igo1/2, which is
  a potent PP2A-B55Cdc55 inhibitor. As PP2A-B55Cdc55 is inactivated, Gis1 initiates
  the quiescence transcriptional program. Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A-B55Cdc55
  favours the post-transcriptional stability of those Gis1-regulated targets. PP2A-B55Cdc55
  also counteracts Mpk1 phosphorylation of Sic1 on Thr173. When PP2A-B55Cdc55 is inhibited
  during nutritional deprivation, Sic1 is stabilized and becomes an inhibitor of Clb5-Cdc28,
  facilitating the arrest in G1. This regulation also takes places in proliferating
  cells: during early G1, Rim15 activity is high, preventing Thr173 dephosphorylation
  and degradation of Sic1. At the Start transition G1 CDK complexes repress Rim15.
  This results in the activation of PP2A-B55Cdc55 and the dephosphorylation of Sic1
  Thr173. Increasing CDK activity brings about multisite phosphorylation of Sic1 that
  triggers its degradation. In addition, the Rim15-ENSA-PP2A-B55Cdc55pathway regulates
  the expression of SBF-dependent genes (e.g., CLN1, CLN2) through the phosphorylation
  of Whi5. During early G1, inhibition of PP2A-B55Cdc55 contributes to the initial
  phosphorylation of Whi5 by Cln3-Cdc28, which promotes the transcription of CLN1
  and CLN2. As Cln1,2-Cdc28 activity rises, Whi5 is further phosphorylated and the
  Start transition is made irreversible. The antagonistic relation between G1-CDK
  complexes and Rim15 and their cooperation in the activation of SBF contributes to
  the homeostatic control of Start, facilitating Whi5 phosphorylation when Cln3 levels
  are low during growth on poor nutritional conditions. (see main text for details)
  Right panel, in orange (Schizosaccharomyces pombe): During growth on rich nitrogen
  and carbon sources, TORC1 and PKA repress Rim15. This inhibition is relieved upon
  nutritional stress, promoting the phosphorylation of Igo1 and inactivation of PP2A-B55Pab1.
  Since PP2A-B55Pab1 counteracts CDK-dependent phosphorylation on Wee1 and Cdc25,
  its inhibition brings about the activation of CDK and mitotic entry at a smaller
  cell size. In turn, this leads to the engagement of the G1 cell size checkpoint
  and prolongation of this phase. Additionally, PP2A-B55Pab1 opposes TORC2 phosphorylation
  on its effector Gad8. Following nitrogen deprivation, PP2A-B55Pab1 inhibition facilitates
  the phosphorylation of Gad8, G1 arrest and engagement of the sexual differentiation
  response.'
