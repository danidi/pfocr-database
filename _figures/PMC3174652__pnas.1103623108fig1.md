caption: De novo and salvage pathway synthesis of dTTP. There are two distinct pathways
  for dTTP synthesis. In the de novo pathway, SHMT catalyzes the conversion of serine
  and tetrahydrofolate (THF) to methyleneTHF and glycine. TYMS converts methyleneTHF
  and dUMP to dihydrofolate (DHF) and dTMP. DHF is converted to THF for subsequent
  rounds of dTMP synthesis in an NADPH-dependent reaction catalyzed by DHFR. In the
  salvage pathway, thymidine is phosphorylated by TK to form dTMP.
