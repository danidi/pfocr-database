caption: (A) An early pulse of Cas at early larval stage primes the expression of
  hh in both NB and GMCs. The Hh ligand (unpublished data) acts in an autocrine and/or
  paracrine fashion to activate Hh signalling transduction in the NB. Among the outcomes
  of Hh signaling pathway activation in the context of postembryonic NB, grh expression
  is down-regulated and Pros moves into the nucleus, eventually leading to NB cell
  cycle exit at early pupal stage. The strength of Hh signaling activation is likely
  to be regulated PP4, which dampen Hh pathway activity by dephosphorylating Smo.
  svp probably constitutes a parallel pathway, which may or may not converge with
  cas→hh pathway at a point prior to the eventual NB cell cycle exit. Dotted lines
  and double question marks denote uncertainties while solid lines represent availability
  of experimental evidences. Triangular and diamond-shaped arrowheads imply positive
  and negative regulations respectively. This illustration is not drawn to scale.
  (B) Type I NB lineage trees at three different developmental stages, during which
  the expression of Grh (red), Cas (blue), Svp (yellow), Hh (green), and Elav (dark
  blue) are shown. The NB, GMC, and neuron are represented by circles with black,
  tan, and brown outlines, respectively. The green arrows show the autocrine/paracrine
  mode of Hh signaling during lineage progression.
