caption: ABP1 signaling pathway in root cells. In the root, SPK1, after perceiving
  the ABP1-mediated auxin signal from the apoplast, induces the ROP6-RIC1 signaling
  pathway, stabilizes the cortical F-actin networks instead of MT and further suppresses
  the endocytosis of PIN1, PIN2 and possibly other PINs. TMK may also contribute to
  PIN endocytosis, and ROP3, after receiving a signal from unknown upstream components,
  promotes PIN1 and PIN3 exocytosis. Dotted lines and question marks indicate potential
  signaling and signaling components, respectively.
