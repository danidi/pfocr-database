caption: (A) The dsDNA immune sensor cGAS, found associated with chromatin in mitosis,
  can synthesize a second messenger cyclic AMP/GMP from ATP and GTP that activates
  an ER‐resident signaling molecule, stimulator of interferon genes (STING). STING
  can trigger the activation of transcription factors, including the interferon response
  factor (IRF)3 and NF‐κB, leading to the production type I interferons, IFN, as well
  as a set of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to alert the immune system and
  neighboring cells. A non‐transcriptional cell death activating function of IRF3
  at mitochondria may contribute to mitotic cell death directly. Moreover, mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization in a minority of mitochondria (miMOMP), frequently
  seen during mitotic arrest, could lead to NF‐κB‐driven inflammation when caspase
  activation is impaired while released mitochondrial (mt)DNA could lead to STING‐dependent
  IFN production. (B) Errors in mitosis that lead to micronucleation in the next G1‐phase,
  such as chromosome missegregation or slippage, alert the immune system via recruiting
  the cGAS/STING signaling pathway, described above. cGAS enters micronuclei upon
  lamin breakdown, binds to nucleosomal chromatin, and produces the second messenger
  cGAMP for STING activation and IFN signaling. Cytokinesis failure that does not
  lead to micronucleation, yet tetraploidy, may engage pro‐inflammatory signaling
  via the activation of the so‐called NEMO–PIDDosome complex, leading to NF‐κB activation.
