caption: A variety of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic stresses can activate the cellular
  senescence program. These stressors engage various cellular signalling cascades
  but ultimately activate p53, p16Ink4a, or both. Stress types that activate p53 through
  DDR signalling are indicated with grey text and arrows (ROS elicit the DDR by perturbing
  gene transcription and DNA replication, as well as by shortening telomeres). Activated
  p53 induces p21, which induces a temporal cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting cyclin
  E–Cdk2. p16Ink4a also inhibits cell-cycle progression but does so by targeting cyclin
  D–Cdk4 and cyclin D–Cdk6 complexes. Both p21 and p16Ink4a act by preventing the
  inactivation of Rb, thus resulting in continued repression of E2F target genes required
  for S-phase onset. Upon severe stress (red arrows), temporally arrested cells transition
  into a senescent growth arrest through a mechanism that is currently incompletely
  understood. Cells exposed to mild damage that can be successfully repaired may resume
  normal cell-cycle progression. On the other hand, cells exposed to moderate stress
  that is chronic in nature or that leaves permanent damage may resume proliferation
  through reliance on stress support pathways (green arrows). This phenomenon (termed
  assisted cycling) is enabled by p53-mediated activation of p21. Thus, the p53–p21
  pathway can either antagonize or synergize with p16Ink4a in senescence depending
  on the type and level of stress. BRAF(V600E) is unusual in that it establishes senescence
  through a metabolic effector pathway. BRAF(V600E) activates PDH by inducing PDP2
  and inhibiting PDK1 expression, promoting a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation
  that creates senescence-inducing redox stress. Cells undergoing senescence induce
  an inflammatory transcriptome regardless of the senescence inducing stress (coloured
  dots represent various SASP factors). Red and green connectors indicate ‘senescence-promoting’
  and ‘senescence-preventing’ activities, respectively, and their thickness represents
  their relative importance. The dashed green connector denotes a ‘senescence-reversing’
  mechanism.
