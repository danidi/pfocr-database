  proteins are involved in the regulation of cell growth through the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase signaling pathway (PI3K), an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR). TSC1: tuberous sclerosis complex 1; TSC2: tuberous sclerosis complex 2;
  Rheb: Ras homolog enriched in brain; GTP: Guanosine triphosphate; Raptor: regulatory-associated
  protein of mTOR; mLST8: target of rapamycin complex subunit LST8; mTOR: mammalian
  target of rapamycin.'
