caption: Proposed model for the hypotensive mechanisms of Murtilla fruit extract.
  The phenolic compounds in Murtilla activate the vasorelaxation response partially
  by nitric oxide synthase (NOS)/guanylate cyclase when the tissue is exposed to low
  concentrations of the extract, while at high concentrations the effect is unspecific
  or vasodilation could be regulated by an alternative pathway. However, when the
  smooth muscle cell is blocked using a protein kinase G inhibitor, the effect is
  no longer dependent on eNOS; otherwise it is apparently modulated by an alternative
  pathway, as we did not observe an inhibitory effect upon stimulation with the extract.
  In the smooth muscle cell, there could be a hyperpolarization phenomenon leading
  to vasorelaxation when small-conductance Kca channels are inhibited, probably because
  large-conductance channels remain active and enhance the vasodilator effects of
  the extract. In other words, this hyperpolarization in smooth muscle cells leads
  calcium channels to close, so decreasing the concentration of intracellular calcium
  and inducing vasodilation.
