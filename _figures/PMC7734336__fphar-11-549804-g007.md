caption: Elements of the SPINK1 pathway are involved in PDAC progression. Acinar gland
  cells (right) of the pancreas produce trypsin, which influences the TGFβ signaling
  pathway in pancreatic duct cells (left). Increased expression of cathepsin B (CTSB)
  in acinar gland cells will cause premature activation of trypsinogen into trypsin
  1/2 serine protease 1/2 (PRSS1/2), which in turn can activate elastase 1), chymotrypsin
  2), kallikrein 3), carboxypeptidase 4), phospholipase 5) and colipase (CLPS, 6).
  Premature activation of these serine proteases will lead to injury of pancreatic
  cells, pancreatitis and ultimately, pancreatic cancer. Acinar gland cells also synthesize
  and export SPINK1, which inhibits trypsin. Thus, in acinar gland cells, SPINK1 plays
  a protective role by inhibiting prematurely activated trypsin thus preventing trypsin
  from causing cellular damage. Premature activation of trypsinogen into trypsin triggers
  a signaling cascade that causes injury to pancreatic cells. In pancreatic duct cells
  (left), trypsin is involved in the activation of coagulation factor II thrombin
  receptor (F2R) like trypsin receptor 1 (F2RL1). This G-protein coupled trypsin receptor
  influences the signaling of TGFβ receptor 2 (TGFBR2) or of Smad2/3, which is an
  intracellular signal transducer and transcriptional modulator activated by TGF-beta.
  Increased expression of TGFβ or its receptors triggers a signaling cascade via Smad2/3
  processes such as epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and metastasis,
  which are associated with cancer progression.
