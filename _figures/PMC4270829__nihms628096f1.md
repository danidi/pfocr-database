caption: The peptidoglycan synthesis pathway is shown on the left in green, and the
  wall teichoic acid pathway is on the right in purple. Both pathways use the carrier
  lipid undecaprenol phosphate (UndP). Boxed writing indicates inhibitors and their
  targets. GlcNAc = N-acetyl glucosamine; MurNAc = N-acetyl muramic acid; ManNAc =
  N-acetyl mannosamine; FPP = farnesyl pyrophosphate; IPP = isoprene phosphate.
