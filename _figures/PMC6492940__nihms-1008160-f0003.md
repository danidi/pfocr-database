caption: In this figure, 3b is a magnified illustration of the synaptic level shown
  in 3a. In 3a, Glu is the biochemical compound with the highest concentration in
  the mammalian brain[]. It is the carboxylate anion of glutamic acid, a non-essential
  α-amino acid used extensively for protein biosynthesis. Glu is the primary excitatory
  neurotransmitter in the CNS, where it activates neurons via its dedicated receptors[].
  Within cells, Glu is typically stored in vesicles (3a.1), while extracellular Glu
  is recycled by plasma membrane transporters at a steady rate to avoid its accumulation
  in the extracellular space[]. Since ATP must bind both to the Na+/K+ (sodium/potassium)
  ATPase (3a.2) and to the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) (3a.3) to maintain the
  electrochemical potential of the cell membrane, TBI-related hypoxia results in ATP
  production impairment, and thereby to membrane depolarization. In 3b, the accumulation
  of extracellular Glu results in the opening of an excessive fraction of Ca2+-permeable
  Glu NMDARs (3b.7) and in the consequent flow of Ca2+ into the neuron (3b.8)[],[].
  Simultaneously, a membrane potential decrease due to NMDAR activation results in
  the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VLCCs) (3b.9), which leads to further
  membrane potential decrease. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is produced from Glu by
  means of the tonically-active glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) enzyme (3a.16).
  In the mammalian CNS, it is the chief neurotransmitter responsible for inhibiting
  synaptic activity[, ], exerting its effect primarily via the activation of ionotropic
  GABAA receptors. GABA concentrations are relatively higher presynaptically, where
  its levels are controlled by phasically-active GAD[]. Synaptically-released GABA
  is uptaken by glia via GABA transporters (GATs) (3a.18) and converted to Glu in
  mitochondria (3a.19). Glu is then converted to glutamine (Gln) (3a.20) and transported
  by system A Gln transporters (SATs) back into neurons (3a.21), where Gln is reconverted
  to Glu, by the action of glutaminase (GLS-2) (3a.22) and reused to produce GABA[].
  Subsequent to TBI, the number of GATs decreases partly due to the death of GABAergic
  neurons, where GATs are produced. This lowers the rate at which GABA is reuptaken
  by glia, such that the extracellular concentration of GABA increases and the rate
  of its conversion to Glu and then to Gln decreases[],[]. The net result of this
  process is a decrease in the amount of Gln which is exported from glia to the extracellular
  space and then to GABAergic neurons via SATs[]. After TBI, GABAergic signaling may
  be disrupted partly because of modifications to GABAA subunits, including the GABAA
  α1, α4, γ2 and δ subunits (3b.26). The earliest changes to the α1 subunit occur
  in the first day after injury and are brought about by disruptions of the pathway
  involving the Janus Kinase (JaK) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription
  (STAT) protein (i.e. the JAK/STAT pathway) (3b.25)[],[],[]. Such disruptions result
  in neuronal membrane depolarization (3b.27) and in weaker downregulation of neuronal
  excitation (3b.28)[]. GABAB regulates gene expression by activating protein kinase
  A (PKA) (3b.30) in the presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This second
  messenger is bound to by cAMP (3b.29) response element-binding (CREB) proteins (3b.31),
  thereby increasing or decreasing the transcription of downstream genes (3b.32)[].
