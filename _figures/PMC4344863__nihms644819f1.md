caption: Retinol (ROL), bound to RBP4 binds to its receptor STRA6 in the cell membrane.
  Upon transport into the cell, CRBP1 binds ROL and delivers it to LRAT for storage
  as Retinyl esters (RE) or to RDH10, which oxides it to retinal (RAL). ALDH1A oxidizes
  RAL to RA or RAL can be reduced back to ROL via DHRS3 for storage. Upon conversion
  to RA, it binds to CRABP2, which can distribute RA to RARs or CYP26 enzymes for
  oxidation and degradation. Green arrows indicate where positive transcriptional
  feedback has been observed, while red bars indicate where negative transcriptional
  feedback has been observed. Although we depict that both positive and negative feedback
  is initiated through transcriptional activation, this is only a hypothesis. One
  mechanism of negative feedback could be through ligand-induced negative feedback
  at RAREs, indicated by the red bar emanating from the RARE. Overall, there is only
  limited data supporting that direct activation of the positively regulated RA signaling
  pathway genes is through RAREs in their promoters, while there is currently no data
  describing how the negatively regulated RA signaling pathway genes are suppressed.
