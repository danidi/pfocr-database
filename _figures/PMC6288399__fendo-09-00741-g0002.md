caption: Model of intestinal sweet taste sensing and signaling effectors. Sweet stimuli,
  including LCS, bind to STR comprised of a heterodimer of G-protein coupled receptors
  T1R2 and T1R3. Upon receptor binding an intracellular signaling cascade is activated,
  initiated by dissociation of G-protein gustducin into Gα and Gβγ subunits and activation
  of phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2); intracellular Ca2+ is then released from inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive stores, leading to opening of the melastatin type-5
  transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPM5) to sodium influx. Increases
  in intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ then depolarize the basolateral membrane, to facilitate
  release of peptide hormones such as GLP-2. GLP-2 may then trigger an enteric neuron
  pathway to release an unknown neuropeptide at nearby absorptive enterocytes leading
  to adenylate cyclase-dependent stablilization of the 3' end of SGLT-1 mRNA (to increase
  half-life), and SGLT-1 translation and insertion into the apical brush border membrane.
