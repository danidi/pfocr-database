caption: Pathogens as well as ischemia and other forms of injury activate cytokine
  production, which normally restores health. If the cytokine response is unbalanced
  or excessive, however, then these same mediators can cause disease. Efferent signals
  from the vagus nerve, which can be controlled by brain networks, inhibit cytokine
  production via pathways dependent on the α7 subunit of the AChR on macrophages and
  other cells. Efferent vagus nerve activity also increases instantaneous heart rate
  variability. A cholinergic brain network that is responsive to M1 agonists can increase
  the activity of the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway and also increase instantaneous
  heart rate variability. Afferent signals carried in the vagus nerve can activate
  an efferent response that inhibits cytokine release, termed the inflammatory reflex.
