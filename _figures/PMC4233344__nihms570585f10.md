caption: Current model for lipoic acid synthesis and utilization in E. coli. The rounded
  rectangle denotes an E. coli cell. Exogenous lipoic acid or octanoic acid enter
  by diffusion and are attached to the 2-oxo acid lipoyl domains and to H protein
  by LplA. The domains modified with exogenously derived octanoate can be converted
  to lipoyl domains by LipA, although this is probably not a reaction of physiological
  significance because high levels of octanoic acid are required for significant modification
  by this route. In contrast LplA-catalyzed attachment of lipoate is very efficient
  and provides a salvage or scavenging pathway for utilization of exogenous lipoic
  acid and seems likely to be physiologically significant. The major (and probably
  sole) route of lipoic acid synthesis is LipB-catalyzed transfer of octanoate from
  octanoyl-ACP to the 2-oxo acid lipoyl domains and H protein followed by LipA-catalyzed
  sulfur insertion to give lipoate.
