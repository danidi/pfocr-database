caption: 'Models. A. Model for Mist regulation and function within Fog signaling pathway.
  Colored boxes denote classification of Fog pathway components. Blue: Transcription
  factor, Yellow: Secreted protein, Red: Transmembrane protein, Green: Cytoplasmic
  protein. B. Schematic of mist and fog RNA expression in cellularizing embryos. Areas
  of overlapping expression are where the ventral furrow and posterior midgut invaginate.'
