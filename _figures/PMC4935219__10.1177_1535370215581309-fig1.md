caption: Cellular and molecular targets of MTX, 5FU and irinotecan in the small intestine
  of the AT. In the small intestine, the barrier provided by the small IECs (white)
  ensures a segregation between luminal microbiota and the mucosal immune system.
  In the crypts, the intestinal epithelial stem cells (pink) share their niche with
  stromal (blue), dentritic cells (green) and macrophages (yellow), and ensure the
  continuous renewal of the epithelial cell layer. After differentiation, IECs migrate
  up the crypt–villus axis (dashed) arrow. Goblet (brown) and Paneth (purple) cells
  secrete mucus and antimicrobial proteins to exclude microbiota. The release of sIgA
  further contributes to this barrier function. M cells and goblet cells mediate transport
  of luminal antigens and live microbiota across the epithelial barrier to dendritic
  cells (green), and macrophages sample the lumen through transepithelial dendrites.
  Pathogen recognition receptors such as TLRs recognize conserved microbial-associated
  molecular motifs and pathogen-specific virulence properties. TLRs induce cytokines
  on ligation to signal molecules via NF-kappaB activation and the MAPK pathway. Cytotoxics
  MTX, 5FU, and irinotecan impair different normal epithelial intestinal functions
  via different mechanisms:(1) MTX enhances the production of ROS and RNS, probably
  formed by phagocytes in the inflammatory regions of the small intestine, which trigger
  the activation of TLR4, and downstream NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways leading to elevated
  levels of MIP-2, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta.(2) MTX impairs cell–cell adhesion by destabilizing
  the interaction between ZO-1 and claudin-4 and altering the normal expression levels
  of claudin-2 (increased), claudin-4 (decreased) and occludin. Irinotecan has been
  shown to decrease claudin-1 and occludin expression in both the small and large
  intestine. This might be due to the increased expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta,
  MIP-2, and TLR4. MTX also causes the formation of RNS that probably act together
  with ROS in damaging small intestinal cells, either in the MLNs or the spleen.(3)
  MTX increases the risk in Escherichia coli translocation and both MTX and 5FU have
  been shown to promote adherence of Candida albicans. Microbiota is also detected
  in irinotecan-treated rats.(4) MTX stimulates the levels of GLP-2, a peptide secreted
  from L-type entero-endocrine cells (green) of the distal small intestine and colon,
  in blood and might therefore be a potential marker for MTX-induced intestinal mucositis.
  The disruption of basal GLP-2 R signaling seems to play a role in irinotecan-induced
  intestinal injury as exogenous activation of the GLP-2 receptor ameliorates gut
  injury.(5) MTX downregulates the transcription factors Cdx2, GATA-4, and HNF-1alpha,
  which are important for intestinal development, differentiation, and gene expression.
  This is correlated with a decreased expression of the SI. Also enterocyte markers
  lactase, I-FABP, L-FABP, SGLT1, and GLUT5 are downregulated by MTX. In contrast,
  5FU stimulates the activity of the Na+-dependent SGLT1 while the SGLT1 protein expression
  is decreased, resulting in a higher absorption of d-glucose.(6) MTX alters the expression
  of TFF3, which are predominantly synthesized by the goblet cells. TFFs play an important
  role in preserving the integrity of the epithelial barrier.(7) MTX, 5FU, and irinotecan
  induce p53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the epithelial stems cells
  of the deep crypts of the small intestine in the initial stage of mucositis. The
  degree of apoptosis seems to depend on the expression levels of members of the Bcl-2
  family. Irinotecan, MTX, and 5FU also reduce the number of goblet cell numbers.
  In the mucosal regeneration phase, an upregulation of HGF and c-met can be noticed
  following MTX treatment while the Hh signaling seems to be important during the
  repair phase of the gut mucosa damage following 5FU.(8) GALT in the intestine has
  been considered a centre of mucosal immunity. 5FU has been shown to reduce the number
  of lymphocytes at the GALT effector sites and the levels of intestinal and respiratory
  tract IgA levels.(9) Endocannabinoids receptors are localized throughout the gut
  and predominantly located in the enteric nervous system expressed in cholinergic
  neurons. Receptor activation leads to relaxation in muscle cells (red) of the gut.
  MTX results in an overactive endocannabinoid system in the gut which might function
  to reduce intestinal inflammation.(10) 5FU and irinotecan alter the microbial composition
  of the gut. A decrease in Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Streptococcus
  spp., and an increase in Escherichia spp. could be observed in the jejunum of 5FU-treated
  rats. In irinotecan-treated rats, a decrease in Bacteroides spp., Lactobacillus
  spp., and Bifidobacterium spp can be noticed, whereas Staphylococcus spp., Clostridium
  spp., and E. coli are increased.(11) Irinotecan and 5FU can cause dramatic changes
  in the ECM. Irinotecan results in the increase of total collagen deposits around
  crypts, but a decrease in collagen IV and fibronectin expression in the crypt region.
  Irinotecan and 5FU further alter the levels of MMP-2, -3, -9, and TIMP-1 and -2
  in the jejunum. Also, the expression of the serine proteases uPA and tPA as well
  as PAI-1, known to play a role in MMP activation, is increased following irinotecan.
