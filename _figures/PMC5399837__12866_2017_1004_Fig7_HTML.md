caption: 'Schematic graphical presentation of the major pathway components or proteins
  significantly regulated in the Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) dprA mutant. Downregulated
  proteins are written in black text and upregulated in green. The figure illustrates:
  the limitation on the nutrient transport of Nm from the outside source possibly
  imposed by the reduced expression of ABC transporters and the subsequent effect
  on the Nm metabolism. The enzymes affected within the Nm core metabolism network
  (glycolysis, TCA cycle and electron transport chain). The less expressed enzymes
  involved in the production (cytochromes) and detoxification of ROS byproducts of
  metabolism. Components of the DNA-uptake machinery involved in the internalization
  of foreign DNA, proteins necessary for the integration of the internalized foreign
  DNA, DNA damage-repair, and replication, including the proteins required for proper
  division of the cell that are less expressed in the dprA mutant. IM- inner membrane,
  OM- outer membrane, Cyc- Cytochrome c, Cyc5- Cytochrome c5'
