caption: Hypothetical pathways involved in MHC–self peptide-TCR recognition and PNH
  clone dominance. Both immunorecognition and apoptosis mechanisms are involved in
  clonal selection of PNH hematopoietic cells. Down-regulation of hematopoiesis and
  limited cytotoxicity are direct effects of low affinity MHC–self peptide-TCR immunorecognition.
  Self peptide repertoires are diversely presented by HSC-located MHC class II to
  Tregs and apoptotic pathways are diversely modulated by PI content in PIG-A mutant
  and normal HSCs. (A) A somatic mutation occurs in PIG-A gene in a hematopoietic
  stem cell followed by gradual PI imbalance in plasma membranes, followed by putative
  PLD, PI3K, and PKB/Akt activation and suppression of Foxo transcription factors.
  This makes the PIG-A mutant HSCs more resistant to apoptosis than normal HSCs. (B)
  Treg-mediated self recognition of HSCs (including complex MHC class II-self peptide)
  results in the Treg-activation, MHC unrestricted intercellular contact with Th CD4+
  cells of any antigenic specificity and possibly other effector cells that are present
  in the bone marrow in the vicinity of activated Tregs. (C) The induction of this
  process is more productive if increased avidity of the recognition is the case,
  i.e., when more efficient presentation of certain HSC-derived self peptides occurs
  in the context of PNH associated than non-associated MHC class II molecules. (D)
  The bone marrow “cellular network” is downregulated, that results in IL-2 deprivation,
  and (E) the “cytokine network” shift toward IFN-γ production, leading to the “pro-apoptotic
  stress” and MHC class I and II up-regulation. The bone marrow turns to the picture
  of bone marrow insufficiency. In local bone marrow hematopoietic foci PNH cells
  overcome the pro-apoptotic stress by the PIG-A gene mutation, PI alteration and
  activation of anti-apoptotic pathway, so that (F) high and (G) low apoptosis, respectively,
  occurs in normal and PNH HSCs. At this stage the anti-apoptotic loop is closed between
  IFN-γ-producing cells and PIG-A mutant hematopoietic stem cells creating the mechanism
  of PNH clone domination. (H) Excessive presentation of certain HSC-derived self
  peptides in the context of up-regulated MHC class I can increase avidity of specific
  TCR of naive CD8-positive T cells close to the activation threshold and induce maturation
  of TCR. (J) Normal and PNH HSCs presenting line-specific peptides are attacked by
  these mature “post-naive” T cells and aplastic anemia picture is presented. This
  process is triggered by more efficient presentation of certain HSC-derived self
  peptides in the context of PNH associated than non-associated MHC class I. (K) Normal
  HSCs present normal levels of tissue-specific peptides. (L) Recognition with normal
  MHC–self peptide-TCR avidity is tolerant. HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; MHC, mayor
  histocompatibility complex; Treg, regulatory T cell; naïve T CD8+, naive cytotoxic
  T cell; Th, helper T cells; NK, natural killer cells; TCR, T cell receptor; IL,
