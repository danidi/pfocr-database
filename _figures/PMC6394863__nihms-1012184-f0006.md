caption: During AVC development, oscillatory flow activates mechanosensitive calcium
  channels Trpp2 and Trpv4 in the endocardium, which then promote klf2a expression
  (). In addition, flow-induced Heg1 represses klf2a expression in conjunction with
  the CCM complex, establishing a feedback loop for klf2a (; ). Klf2a, in turn, regulates
  wnt9b expression in the endocardium () and Fibronectin deposition in the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) (). At the same time, flow-induced miR-21 represses receptor tyrosine
  kinase signaling by targeting sprty2 (). Meanwhile, during ventricle emergence,
  function-dependent miR-143 inhibits retinoic acid signaling in the endocardium ()
  and targets Adducin3 in the myocardium (). Mechanical forces also activate Notch
  signaling in the endocardium, which further induces expression of the Erbb2 ligand
  nrg1 (). During trabeculation, cardiac function regulates nrg2a () and erbb2 expression
  (), as well as Wwtr1 localization (). The Nrg/Erbb2 pathway can further affect Notch
  signaling in cardiomyocytes (Jiménez-Amilburu et al., 2016) and regulate Wwtr1 localization,
  which can also activate Notch signaling ().
