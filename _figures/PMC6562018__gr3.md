caption: Restriction of sulfur-containing AAs, such as Met or Cys, increases H2S production
  through TSP pathway activation, including the activation of CBS and CGL. H2S exerts
  anti-oxidative/anti-inflammatory effects. A LP/LPHC diet or MetR suppresses mTORC1,
  which leads to TSP pathway activation, and reduces the overproduction of ROS from
  mitochondria. BCAA restriction suppresses oxidative stress and inflammation through
  inhibition of NADPH oxidase and NF-κB.
