caption: (A) mtROS in bacterially triggered immune responses. mtROS contribute to
  Salmonella clearing. TLR/TRAF6 pathway activation leads to poly-ubiquitination of
  ECSIT in the mitochondria and increase mtROS in macrophages. Mycobacterium infection
  triggers a TNF response via RIP1/RIP2 that increases mtROS in macrophages, first
  increasing bactericidal effects but ultimately leading to macrophage death and increased
  bacterial dissemination. Listeria infection triggers mtROS through an INF-γ response,
  activating ERRα and PGC-1β and the INF-γ/STAT1 pathway contributing to macrophage
  clearing of the bacteria. (B) mtROS generation. Superoxide is produced as an intermediate
  in the electron transport chain (ETC). In the mitochondria matrix excess superoxide
  is reduced to hydrogen peroxide by SOD2. Superoxide in the inter-membrane space
  can be exported to the cytoplasm through VDAC. It is then transformed into hydrogen
  peroxide by SOD1 and finally reduced to water through catalase, peroxiredoxins and
  glutathione peroxidases.
