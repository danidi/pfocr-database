caption: Rickettsia species synthesize cell envelope glycoconjugates from imported
  host sugars and fuel the TCA cycle with a range of host-acquired metabolites. (A)
  Previously shown to be imported, UDP-glucose is predicted to yield UDP-glucuronate
  and UDP-α-d-galactose, sugars likely to be used in LPS synthesis (light blue pathway
  lines). Synthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosamine, another sugar likely incorporated
  into LPS, as well as pathways for O-antigen, lipid A, and lipid I of PGN (green
  pathway line), initiates with UDP-NAG. Without glycolysis enzymes, rickettsiae are
  predicted to import host NAG-1-P and convert this charged sugar to UDP-NAG via the
  uridyltransferase GlmU. d-Ribose 5-P, which is required to initiate CMP-Kdo synthesis,
  is also predicted to be imported from the host, provided that Rickettsia species
  lack enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway. (B) Rickettsia species must acquire
  pyruvate for generation of PEP and acetyl-CoA. Pyruvate interconversions with Ser,
  Gly (via Ser), and malate are likely mediated by additional import of these molecules,
  ensuring that enough pyruvate enters the PDC to yield acetyl-CoA (brown). Aside
  from entering the TCA cycle (green), acetyl-CoA is also used in fatty acid biosynthesis
  and production of PHB (dark blue), a storage molecule that is metabolized when host
  energy sources are unavailable. Imported malate, glutamine (Gln), and glutamate
  (Glu) likely regulate the flow of acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle, with Gln/Glu interconversions
  with 2-oxaloglutarate and oxaloacetate providing additional energy (dashed burgundy
  pathway lines). Generated aspartate is essential for initiation of the synthesis
  of DAP, which is used in PGN biosynthesis (light blue), a pathway nearly conserved
  except for a central hole (gray circle). DAP synthesis also requires generated succinyl-CoA,
  which is also used to synthesize porphyrins (orange). HTPA, (2S,4S)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate.
