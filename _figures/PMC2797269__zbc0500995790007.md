caption: Hypothetical model for the effect of oxidative stress on IGF-I regulation
  of chondrocyte proteoglycan (aggrecan) and collagen II production. In this model,
  the balance of Akt and ERK1/2 activation determines the final effect of IGF-I on
  proteoglycan production and collagen expression. In normal chondrocytes, IGF-I activates
  the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), which induces IRS-1 activation through tyrosine phosphorylation
  and subsequently activates the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway, which leads downstream to
  increased aggrecan synthesis and collagen II expression. Increased activation of
  MEK-ERK signaling, stimulated by oxidative stress and increased ROS levels present
  in OA cartilage, inhibits aggrecan and collagen gene transcription. Oxidative stress
  also activates MEK-ERK signaling, which, through inducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation,
  negatively regulates IGF-I activation of PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling and proteoglycan
  synthesis.
