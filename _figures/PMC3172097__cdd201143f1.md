caption: The autophagy pathway in plants. Upon induction by environmental and developmental
  stimuli, macroautophagy starts by nucleation and expansion of a pre-autophagosomal
  membrane, the phagophore, which engulfs cytoplasmic material destined for degradation.
  Autophagosomes are then transported to and dock with the vacuole, which leads to
  release of the inner single-membrane vesicle, the autophagic body, into the vacuolar
  lumen and hydrolytic breakdown of the enclosed cargo. Autophagy induction and vesicle
  nucleation require the action of the TOR kinase and ATG1-complex, which activates
  the class III PI3K complex containing ATG6/Beclin1 and possibly other yet unknown
  interactors. Additionally, as known from other eukaryotes, the ATG9 complex is required
  for recycling and retrieval of autophagy proteins, but this function awaits verification
  in plants. Membrane elongation and autophagosome formation require the action of
  two-ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, which modify two ubiquitin-like molecules,
  ATG5 and ATG8, to mediate association with the phagophore and its subsequent folding
  and expansion. *ATG proteins not identified in plants yet
