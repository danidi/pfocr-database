caption: 'Biochemistry of hydrogen production in Synechocystis PCC 6803 by direct
  biophotolysis. In this pathway the reducing equivalents are obtained directly from
  the splitting of water at PSII. The electrons are transferred into the photosynthetic
  electron transport chain through a series of transport molecules including plastoquinone
  (PQ), cytochromeb6F (Cyt b6f) and plastocyanin (PC), and move through photosystem
  I (PSI) to reduce ferredoxin (Fdx) which goes on to reduce NADP+ to NADPH via the
  enzyme ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR). At the same, time the reduced ferredoxin
  also has the capacity to directly donate the electrons to the Hox hydrogenase indicated
  by the highlighted arrow. Under the present conditions hydrogenase can compete with
  the Calvin cycle for hydrogen production till it is inactivated due to the evolution
  of oxygen at PSII. The dotted arrow speculates NADPH as another possible electron
  donor to the hydrogenase. The dotted double-headed arrow under TH suggests a hypothetical
  conversion of NADPH into NADH and vice versa. Abbreviations: OPP: Oxidative Pentose
  Phosphate pathway; TH: transhydrogenase; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; ADP: adenosine
  diphosphate.'
