caption: A variety of host and tumor interactions can promote angiogenesis. (1) Marrow-derived
  endothelial precursor cells (EPC) can localize to tumor where they can participate
  in vascular formation; (2) Intratumoral Th1 cells, which produce interferon-gamma
  (IFNγ) can inhibit vascular endothelial growth cell inhibitor (VEGI), which itself
  is an inhibitor of angiogenesis, thus resulting in an overall pro-angiogenic effect;
  (3) Both intratumoral Th17 cells and M2-differentiated macrophages promote angiogenesis
  through cytokine secretion; and (4) tumor-associated decrease of upregulated gene
  19 (U19) expression results in decreased thrombospondin-1 (TSP) expression, which
  itself inhibits angiogenesis, resulting in an overall pro-angiogenic effect. Macrophages
  can also differentiate along an M1 pathway, resulting in inhibition of T regulatory
  (Treg) cells which will result in derepressing a variety of T cell responses that
  can promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. In addition to angiogenic effects, there
  were multiple interactions identified that result in impacting the bone microenvironment.
  In breast cancer (BrCa) it was show that transducin-β-like protein 1 (TBL1) was
  required for induction of NFκB activity, which resulted in production of granulocyte
  monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and osteoclast (OC) production. Multiple
  myeloma (MM) was also shown to simulate OC differentiation through activation of
  activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). In addition to its impact on OCs, MM also
  promotes overall bone loss through inhibition of osteoblasts (OB) by upregulating
  Gfi-1 expression, which in turn inhibits the RNX2 transcription factor that is required
  for osteoblastogenesis. In contrast, prostate cancer (PCa) was shown to promote
  osteoblast activity through downregulation of dikkopf-1 (DKK1), which allows for
  Wnts to promote osteoblastic activity. DKK1 also was shown to promote the cell cycle
  through activation inhibition of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, which overall promotes
  tumor growth.
