caption: 'The virus activates the JNK signaling pathway of the vector insects in three
  ways: i) upregulating TNF-α; ii) decreasing the expression of GPS2, which is a repressor
  of JNK activation; and iii) binding of the virus capsid protein to GPS2 to prevent it
  from inhibiting the JNK activation machinery. JNK activation is beneficial to the
  ability of the virus to replicate in its vector insects.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26591.028'
