caption: A model depicting the DNA damage response pathway inducing disease-related
  phenotypes in T cells in rheumatoid arthritis. RA risk factors, including viral
  infection, environmental events, and genetic factors lead to defective DDR signals
  in T cells, and the inadequate DDR responsiveness subsequently alters T cell functionality
  in multiple aspects. First, deficiency in DNA repair influences T cell survival
  resulting in a lower apoptotic threshold. Second, DDR is implicated in the metabolic
  regulation of RA-associated T cells. Moreover, an impaired DDR response biases T
  cell differentiation to inflammatory effector T cells. Therefore, DDR deficiency
  in RA-associated T cells represents a key mechanism for the pathogenesis of RA with
  transitional genetic and environmental factors to RA pathogenesis-related T cell
  dysfunction.
