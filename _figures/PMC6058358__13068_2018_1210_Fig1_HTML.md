caption: 'Schematic overview of synthesis pathway (a) and expression constructs containing
  the pathway genes (b). GPP and FPP are synthesized by IspA* and IspA, respectively,
  through condensations of DMAPP and IPP, generated from the MVA pathway. NudB catalyzes
  dephosphorylation of IPP, DMAPP, GPP, and FPP into IP, DMAP, GP, and FP, respectively.
  AphA catalyzes hydrolysis of IP, DMAP, GP, and FP into isoprenol, prenol, geraniol,
  and farnesol, respectively. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) is responsible
  for transformation of isoprenol, prenol, and geraniol into their corresponding acetate
  esters. An alcohol dehydrogenase, YjgB oxidizes geraniol and farnesol into citral
  and farnesal, respectively. An unknown acetyl transferase (ATF) is involved in transformation
  of farnesol into farnesyl acetate. Solid colored arrows and black bent arrows represent
  genes and promoters, respectively. Abbreviations of the pathway intermediates are
  as follows: MVA, mevalonate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; IP, isopentenyl
  phosphate; DMAP, dimethylallyl phosphate; GP, geranyl phosphate; FP, farnesyl phosphate.
  The abbreviations of enzymes are as follows: NudB, dihydroneopterin triphosphate
  diphosphatase; IspA, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; AphA, acid phosphatase; IspA*,
  IspA mutant of geranyl diphosphate synthase; MvaE, bifunctional acetoacetyl-CoA
  thiolase and HMG-CoA reductase; MvaS, HMG-CoA synthase; MvaK1, mevalonate kinase;
  MvaK2, phosphomevalonate kinase; MvaD, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase; IDI,

  NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductases; ?ATF, unknown acetyl transferase of E. coli'
