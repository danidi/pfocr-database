caption: 'Diagram of the sphingolipid metabolism. The de novo synthesis pathway starts
  at the endoplasmic reticulum by the condensation of palmitate and serine to produce
  3-ketosphinganine, which is then reduced to sphinganine, and converted to DhCER
  by the addition of a fatty acid. CER is the core molecule of SPL metabolism and
  is formed by the desaturation of DhCER. CER is the precursor of SPH, C1P, and a
  collection of complex SPLs: SM, GlcCer, GalCer and its derivatives. The SPL groups
  analyzed and quantified in this work are depicted in blue. (For interpretation of
  the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
