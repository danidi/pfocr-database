caption: Model for A3B-Mediated Activation of ER Enhancers toward Regulation of ER
  Target Gene ExpressionEstrogen binding to ER promotes its recruitment to ER enhancers.
  A3B, recruited to these regions through interaction with ER, provides enzymatic
  conversion of C to U. Generation of U:G mismatches promotes DNA nicks through the
  action of UNG and AP endonuclease, resulting in DNA cleavage and repair by the non-homologous
  end-joining DNA repair pathway. Induction of transient C-to-U changes stimulates
  chromatin modification and remodeling and PolII recruitment to facilitate expression
  of ER target genes.
