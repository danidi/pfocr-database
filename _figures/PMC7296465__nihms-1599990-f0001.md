caption: Serotonin-dependent (Q) and adenosine-dependent (S) pathways to phrenic motor
  facilitation (pMF) interact via powerful cross-talk inhibition. In our working model,
  the Q pathway is induced by 5-HT2 receptor activation on phrenic motor neurons due
  to AIH-induced increases in raphe neuron activity and serotonin release within the
  phrenic motor nucleus. However, AIH also activates 5-HT7 receptors, which constrain
  the dominant Q pathway (not shown). On the other hand, as local spinal tissue PO2
  decreases, extracellular adenosine accumulation (ADO) contributes to the now dominant
  S pathway, over-riding the Q pathway via PKA-dependent cross-talk inhibition. Spinal
  tissue PO2 will depend on the prevailing arterial PO2 blood hemoglobin concentration
  (and oxygen concentration), tissue metabolic rate and perfusion of the phrenic motor
  nucleus. Thus, factors other than the arterial PO2 within hypoxic episodes, such
  as blood hemoglobin concentration and local perfusion, may shift the relative Q
  versus S pathway balance. “Standard” mAIH protocols could equally activate these
  pathways, canceling phrenic motor plasticity.
