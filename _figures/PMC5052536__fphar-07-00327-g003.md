caption: ErbB/HER downstream signaling pathways may influence the ability of ErbB/HER
  and other kinase inhibitors to modulate MHC expression. In settings where the MAPK
  pathway is actively repressing MHC expression, the location of the activating/oncogenic
  event (indicated in red) will likely influence the response to ErbB/HER and/or other
  kinase inhibitors. (A) In the setting of ErbB/HER ligand overproduction, inhibition
  of ErbB/HER activity (via an ErbB/HER inhibitor) and/or enzymes in the MAPK signaling
  pathway may increase MHC expression. (B) In the setting of ErbB/HER activating mutations
  and/or overproduction, an ErbB/HER inhibitor and/or MAPK inhibitor may increase
  MHC expression. (C) In the setting of an activating RAS mutation, the effect of
  an ErbB/HER inhibitor may be null/minimal because MAPK signaling is being driven
  by activated RAS, whereas a downstream MAPK inhibitor may increase MHC expression.
  (D) In the setting of an activating mutation in BRAF, as with an activating RAS
  mutation, an ErbB/HER inhibitor would not likely change MHC expression whereas a
  BRAF inhibitor and/or a MEK inhibitor may increase MHC expression.
