caption: 'Proinsulin and its biosynthetic pathway. A, pathway of insulin biosynthesis
  beginning with preproinsulin (top): signal peptide (gray), B-domain (blue), dibasic
  BC junction (green), C-domain (black), dibasic CA junction (green), and A-domain
  (red). In the ER the unfolded prohormone undergoes specific disulfide pairing to
  yield native proinsulin (middle panels). Cleavage of BC and CA junctions (by prohormone
  convertases PC1 and PC2 and by carboxypeptidase E) leads to mature insulin and the
  C-peptide (bottom). B, structural model of insulin-like moiety and disordered connecting
  peptide (dashed line). The A- and B-domains are shown in red and blue, respectively;
  the disordered connecting domain is shown in dashed black line. Cystines are labeled
  in yellow boxes. C, cellular pathway of insulin biosynthesis: nascent proinsulin
  folds as a monomer in ER (left) wherein zinc-ion concentration is low; in post-Golgi
  granules proinsulin is processed by cleavage of connecting peptide to yield mature
  insulin, and zinc-stabilized hexamers begin to assemble. Zinc-insulin crystals are
  observed in secretory granules. On secretion into the portal circulation (right),
  hexamers dissociated to yield bioactive insulin monomers. rER, rough endoplasmic
  reticulum; SRP, signal recognition particle.'
