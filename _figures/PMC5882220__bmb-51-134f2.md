caption: Overview of the Hippo signaling pathway in Drosophila. Key steps of Hippo
  signaling. () Membrane proteins Ft and Crb regulate junctional localization of Dachs
  and Ex-Mer-Kibra, respectively. () Ex-Mer-Kibra function together to activate the
  Hippo kinase cascade. Mer and Kibra can form a complex at cell junction (Junctional
  complex) and at apical medial region (Medial complex). Ex binds to Schip1 which
  then promotes Tao-1 kinase activity for Hpo phosphorylation. () Hpo-Wts core kinase
  cascade. Activated Wts phosphorylates Yki to block its nuclear entry. F-actin formation
  and Yki activation are negatively regulated by capping proteins (Cp) and Tsr/cofilin.
  () When Wts is inactive, Yki induces target gene expression to promote cell proliferation
  and cell survival.
