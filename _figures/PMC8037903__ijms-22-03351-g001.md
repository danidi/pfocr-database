caption: Role of gut in inducing adipose tissue inflammation. Inflammation alters
  the gut barrier function through a reduction in the thickness of the intestinal
  mucus layer and a subsequent increase in gut permeability []. Lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), trigger inflammation in adipocytes and, along with macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor (M-CSF), infiltrated from the intestine, promotes ATM recruitment within
  the mesenteric fat depot []. Once in the circulation, LPS could reach adipose tissue
  and acts as a Toll-like receptor agonist (TLR)-4, increasing the expression of proinflammatory
  markers []. TLR4 binds to LPS through the formation of a complex with LPS-binding
  proteins (LBP), MD-2 (myeloid differentiation factor 2) and CD14 (cluster of differentiation
  14). This complex activates the myeloid differentiation primary-response protein
  88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway leading to Nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) activation and
  to transcription of proinflammatory genes both in adipocytes and ATM [,].
