caption: A model for Rad4–Rad23 and GG-NER E3 ligase function in DDR signalling and
  dNTP synthesis. The top left side and top middle panel of the figure shows the redundant
  two-pathway NER system as previously described (). Pathway I involves Rad23 and
  the 19S proteasome that control NER independently of de novo protein synthesis,
  while Pathway II involves Rad4 ubiquitination by the GG-NER E3 ligase that regulates
  the gene expression of DUN1 and DDR2 and other genes described in this study. Ubiquitination
  of Rad4 (left panel) drives dissociation of the Rad4–Rad23 complex from the promoter
  region of STRE containing genes. DUN1 is shown as an example. This loss of occupancy
  promotes increased gene expression. This example is specific for the STRE containing
  DUN1 gene and other genes from cluster 2 in Figure . Rad4–Rad23 binding in the vicinity
  of the STRE may be direct or indirect. The central signalling cascade of Mec1-Rad53-Dun1
  is represented in the middle section, including the RNR pathway as an important
  end-point in the bottom right panel. In response to DNA damage Crt1 is hyperphosphorylated
  by activated Dun1. Derepression of the RNR genes by Rad4–Rad23 and Crt1 results
  in enhanced expression of these genes and subsequent increase of the cellular dNTP
  pools. The transcription response of DUN1 and RNR1–4 provides downstream substrates
  for the DDR signalling pathway. How pathway II is activated in response to DNA damage
  remains to be determined.
