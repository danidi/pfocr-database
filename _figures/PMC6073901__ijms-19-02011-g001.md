caption: The Notch core pathway and endocytic routes to ligand-dependent and ligand-independent
  activation of Notch signaling. Red arrows indicate canonical paths of Notch activation
  initiated by Notch/Ligand (Dl/Jag) binding and generating Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD) molecules upon sequential proteolytic cleavage of Notch at site 2 (S2) and
  3 (S3), by Adam metalloproteases and γ-secretase, respectively. Black arrows indicate
  the endocytic route of unbound Notch receptor regulated by the endosomal sorting
  complex required for transport (ESCRT) system and culminating with Notch degradation
  in late endosome (LE) fused to lysosome (Lys). Green arrows indicate the alternative
  endocytic path of unbound Notch, allowing Notch to escape degradation and whereas
  generation of NICD. Both red and green paths culminate with nuclear translocation
  of NICD and its recruitment at CSL-bound promoters, which triggers the exchange
  of CSL-bound co-repressor with Maml and co-activators of transcription.
