caption: 'After synthesis histones H3 and H4 interact in the cytosol with common folding
  chaperones HSC70 and HSP90, with H3 being mono-methylated on K9 co-translationally
  by SetDB1. Two pathways have been proposed for the import of H3 and H4: folding
  of an H3–H4 dimer in the cytosol and subsequent binding to ASF1 before import by
  IPO4, or import of monomeric histones bound directly to importins, with H3–H4 dimerisation
  occurring in the nucleus. ASF1’s interaction with H3–H4 in the cytosol can be regulated
  by the protein CDAN1, which competes with histone for ASF1 binding. H2A and H2B
  are imported as dimers bound to NAP1 and IPO9. In the nucleus, NASP interacts with
  H3 downstream of ASF1 through a high affinity interaction with the H3 α3 helix,
  and may thereby function as a receptor of H3 from the import machinery. Whether
  a monomeric H4 chaperone exists is not known. RbAp46 and HAT1 associate with H4,
  acetylating K5 and K12, and together with NASP and ASF1 form the major soluble H3–H4
  complex. The S-phase-specific TLK1 and TLK2 can increase the affinity between histones
  and ASF1 through ASF1-specific phosphorylation marks.'
