caption: A schematic diagram showing classic and alternative pathways by which extracellular
  Ang II induces biological actions in proximal tubule cells, namely through activation
  of cell surface AT1-receptors under acute physiological settings and/or intracellular
  AT1-receptors (cytoplasmic and nuclear) following endocytosis under pathophysiological
  conditions. While the classic pathway plays an essential role in the physiological
  regulation of proximal tubular transport, the alternative pathway may play a critical
  role in the development of hypertension and Ang II-induced tubulo-interstitial injury.
