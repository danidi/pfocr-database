caption: Mechanisms of E2F1-induced apoptosis. E2F1 promotes apoptosis via the tumour
  suppressor p53 and independent of p53. In the p53-dependent pathway, E2F1 activates
  ARF, which in turn stabilizes p53 by alleviating its proteosome degradation through
  Mdm2. ARF negatively regulates E2F1 in a feedback loop mechanism. In response to
  DNA damage E2F1 is stabilized through phosphorylation by ATM/ATR and Chk2 kinases
  (Chk2 also stabilizes p53 by phosphorylation). In addition, E2F1 interacts directly
  with p53 via the cyclin A binding domain, thereby inducing p53-mediated apoptosis.
  Alternatively, p53-independent apoptosis by E2F1 occurs via direct up-regulation
  of genes including p73 and Apaf-1. The assembly of Apaf1 with cytochrome c released
  from the mitochondria leads to formation of the apoptosome that catalyzes Caspase-9,
  and successive initiation of proapoptotic effector caspases including Caspase-3.
