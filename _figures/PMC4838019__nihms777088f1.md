caption: Neuronal electrical activity includes generation and propagation of axonal
  action potentials through opening of depolarizing Nav and hyperpolarizing Kv. Arrival
  of traveling depolarization at axon terminal triggers opening of Cav and entry of
  Ca2+, which in turn activates the secretory machinery of vesicle exocytosis. Relased
  transmitter (either glutamate or GABA in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons, respectively)
  binds to postsynaptic receptors (GLURs or GABAA/B) thereby producing depolarizing
  excitatory or hyperpolarizing inhibitory ion fluxes on postsynaptic neurons. Depolarization
  is eventually amplified and propagated in dendrites by Nav and Kv. Transmitter molecules
  are readily taken up mainly by astrocytes via the relative transporter proteins
  (EAATs or GATs) and then returned back to neurons in the glutamate-glutamine cycle
  (note that GABA is converted to glutamate by astrocytic GABA-T). Cycling of neurotransmitter
  strictly requires the action of astrocyte-specific GS. Inhibition of GS by MSO and/or
  loss-of-function during epilepsy-induced astrocytosis determines the depletion of
  presynaptic transmitter molecules and accumulation of glutamate in astrocytes. High
  glutamate levels in these cells result in excessive channeling of glutamate in TCA
  cycle and dowstreaming stimulation of gluconeogenic pathway (e.g. PEPCK and FBPase).
  The activation of FBPase is correlated with new synthesis of aberrant glycogen molecules
  called polyglucosans, which are partly insoluble and thus inaccessible to degrading
  enzymes. Ion gradients are primarily re-established by action of NKA in both neurons
  and astrocytes. However, astrocytic NKA is poised for reuptake of neuronally released
  K+, a process requiring glycogenolysis. Thus, defective glycogenolysis due to accumulation
  of polyglucosans impairs astrocytic K+ uptake. Excess extracellular K+ shifts neuronal
  membrane potential towards chronically depolarized values and possibly initiates
  and perpetuates the epileptic seizure. Note that in the figure, the stimulation
  of polyglucosans synthesis by glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is present only for illustration
  purposes, as the exact mechanisms leading to polyglucosans synthesis are presently
  unknown. AQP, aquaporin; Cav, voltage-gated Ca2+ channel; Cx, connexin; EAATs, excitatory
