caption: 'PARP inhibitors: Some possible mechanisms of action and resistance. The
  left panel illustrates two possible mechanisms of action of PARPi. Upper pathway:
  Inhibition of PARP enzyme activity or catalytic inhibition interferes with the repair
  of single-strand breaks, leading to stalled DNA replication forks that requires
  HR repair. In HR-deficient tumours, such as those with BRCAm, PARP inhibition results
  in synthetic lethality. Lower pathway: PARP trapping refers to trapping of PARP
  proteins on DNA, which also leads to replication fork damage, but because this pathway
  utilises additional repair mechanisms, it is not restricted to tumours with HR deficiency.
  The right panel illustrates three possible mechanisms of resistance to PARPi. These
  include: (1) secondary mutations in BRCA genes that restore BRCA function and HR;
  (2) somatic mutation of TP53BP1, causing partial restoration of HR; and (3) increased
  PARPi efflux mediated by MDR1/P-glycoprotein 1, preventing the drugs from acting
  at the appropriate sites. The first two mechanisms of resistance restore HR and
  apply to PARP catalytic inhibition in HR-deficient tumours; whereas, the third mechanism
  applies to both mechanisms of action of PARPi. BRCAm BRCA mutation; HR homologous
  recombination; MDR1 multidrug resistance protein 1; p53BP1 tumour suppressor p53-binding
  protein 1; PARP poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PARPi PARP inhibitor'
