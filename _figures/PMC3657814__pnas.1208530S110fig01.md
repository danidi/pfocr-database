caption: Metabolically controlled apoptosis pathway of Myc. Myc activation (i) reduces
  ATP levels (ii), activating a cellular energy sensor, AMPK (iii). Active AMPK initiates
  energy-saving metabolism via AMPK-induced phosphorylation events that inhibit biosynthetic
  reactions [e.g., AMPK suppresses acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by phosphorylating
  Ser79, which reduces fatty acid synthesis]. AMPK also promotes glutamine use in
  the mitochondria and phosphorylates p53 at Ser15, increasing p53 levels. In healthy
  cells, p53 halts cell proliferation, which conserves energy. Oncogenic Myc prevents
  proliferation from slowing down, and AMPK-induced p53 phosphorylation continues
  to extend the p53 lifetime (iv), so p53 accumulates at the mitochondrial surface
  (v). High levels of p53 alter the interactions between p53 and mitochondrial apoptosis
  proteins Bak and Bcl-xL (vi), and Bak acquires an active open conformation. Activated
  Bak sensitizes mitochondria to triggers of apoptosis, inhibiting the expansion of
  oncogene-transformed cells. Dashed arrows indicate concentration changes; phosphorylation
  events are denoted with a circled p. GLS, glutaminase.
