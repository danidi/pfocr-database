caption: Proposed model for superior performance of S. cerevisiae YB-2625 in the aspects
  of xylose fermentation and stress response. Three modules were highlighted in different
  colors. Module 1 includes transporters, endogenous xylose-assimilating genes, and
  metabolic pathway (in blue) which were well studied. Module 2 emphasizes the key
  transcription factors (in brown) and module 3 contains key factors involved in oxidative
  stress tolerance (green)
