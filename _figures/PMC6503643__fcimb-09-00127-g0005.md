caption: HSVs interfere with antiviral processes in innate immune cells. (A) HSV has
  been described to reduce MHC-I expression on the surface of infected cells. In addition,
  HSV also reduces MICA and ULBP1-3 expression through the inhibition of PIGT, a member
  of the GPI anchoring complex by the HSV-1-encoded microRNA H8 (miR-H8). (B) The
  HSV glycoprotein gD reduces nectin-1 expression on the surface of infected cells,
  hampering DNAM-1 binding to this host factor and diminishing the capacity of NK
  cells to mediate the lysis of HSV-infected cells, which is normally mediated by
  granzymes. (C) HSV has been reported to directly engage TLR2 on the surface of NK
  cells, which leads to IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion. (D) FasL expressed on the surface
  of HSV-infected macrophages has been reported to induce Fas-mediated apoptosis in
  NK cells. (E) Within HSV-infected macrophages, the HSV protein ICP27 has been reported
  to inhibit STING and TBK1 activation, thus interfering with this signaling pathway
  that generally leads to IRF3-dependent type-I IFN secretion by virus-infected cells.
  (F) HSV infection of macrophages reduces the surface expression of CD1d, which in
  combination with a glycolipid acts as a receptor for NKT cell TCRs. CD1d is sequestered
  by the HSV proteins US3 and VP22. Thus, HSV reduces NKT expansion and function by
  hiding its activating ligand. Black lines show cellular processes. Red lines show
  processes modulated by HSVs.
