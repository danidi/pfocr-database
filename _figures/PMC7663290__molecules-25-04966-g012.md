caption: Metabolism of NAD+ with membranes from lung or after incubation of ASM cells.
  NAD+ is converted to ADPR by CD38. In the absence of CD38, NAD+ is metabolized to
  AMP by a pyrophosphatase activity such as CD203a. ADPR is also converted to AMP
  by CD203a. The conversion of NAD+ or ADPR to AMP is much slower than that of NAD+
  to ADPR by CD38. Once AMP is formed, it is rapidly converted to adenosine (ADO)
  by CD73. Based on results of cells in culture and incubations of membranes with
  various substrates, the rate limiting step of these reactions is at the CD203a step.
  Formed adenosine can be recycled intracellularly to the ATP pool or be metabolized
  to uric acid (UA). Chemical structures are shown.
