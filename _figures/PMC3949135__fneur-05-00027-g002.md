caption: Role of tertiary lymphoid organs in intrathecal synthesis. CNS TLO are able
  to mount a classical antigen-driven T and B-cell clonal response that is responsible
  for intrathecal synthesis against brain-borne (and possibly disease-relevant) antigens
  (, –) (upper part of figure). A hypothetical pathway (lower part of figure) may
  involve the non-specific recruitment of circulating plasmablasts (PB) and plasma
  cells (PC) from blood by CNS TLO. These disease-irrelevant PB may further differentiate
  after proliferation to PC, home in on survival niches provided by TLO and maintain
  the non-specific intrathecal Ig synthesis.
