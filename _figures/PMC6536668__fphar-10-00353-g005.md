caption: Schematic representation for the effect of taVNS on CAP. Inflammatory/toxic
  substances invoke series of pro-inflammatory signals to bind with toll like receptors
  on the cellular membranes. Binding to the toll like receptors mediates the translocation
  of NFκB to nucleus and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. taVNS can facilitate
  the Ach release to act upon the α7nAchR receptor, which in turn inhibits the translocation
  of NFκB to nucleus and therefore curtails the inflammatory signaling.
