caption: Schematic model of IFN-induced apoptosis in WISH cells. IFN binding to its
  receptors activates the canonical JAK-STAT pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest
  and expression of caspase-8, which progresses within days. Meanwhile, the cFLIP
  cytoplasmic concentration increases rapidly, binding FADD within hours after IFN
  induction to inhibit caspase-8 cleavage. This results in slow and gradual caspase-8
  activation, followed by caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis. Caspase-8–cFLIP competition
  is FADD dependent and requires DR5 as a platform independent of death ligands.
