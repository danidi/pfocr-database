caption: 'A simplified model of the feeding regulation hypothesis involving the hypothalamic
  neuropeptide signaling pathway. Leptin, insulin, CCK, and PYY stimulate an anorexigenic
  pathway and inhibit an orexigenic pathway. The effect of ghrelin in the hypothalamus
  is opposite to that of leptin, insulin, CCK, and PYY. Ghrelin stimulates an orexigenic
  pathway and inhibits an anorexigenic pathway. Together, this system functions to
  regulate food intake to optimize metabolic energy balance. NPY: neuropeptide Y;
  POMC: proopiomelanocortin; AgRP: agouti-related protein; CART: cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated
  transcript; ARC: arcuate nucleus; PVN: paraventricular nucleus; MCH: melanin-concentrating
  hormone; LH: lateral hypothalamus; CRF: corticotrophin-releasing factor.'
