caption: The role of the NIC2 ERF cluster in the activation of the nicotine biosynthetic
  pathway. Attack by insects activates the production of JA, which moves downward
  to the root. JA is transported into root cells and subsequently converted to methyl-JA,
  which induces SCFCOI1-mediated degradation of Jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins (JAZ).
  Upon JAZ degradation, the master regulator MYC2, sequestered by JAZ in the absence
  of JA, is freed to activate the ERF cluster genes. MYC2, in addition to activating
  NIC2 cluster genes, coactivates the nicotine pathway genes with ERF189. Not all
  NIC2 members are significantly involved in the activation of the nicotine biosynthetic
  pathway, which starts from aspartate and ornithine. ERF189 (likely also ERF199)
  selectively activates the enzymes of the nicotine pathway (indicated by red dash
  arrows), which overlaps with several primary metabolic pathways (i.e. NAD, spermidine
  and GABA, indicated by purple arrows). Newly synthesized nicotine is transported
  into vacuoles by transporters, MATE1 and MATE2, which are also regulated by ERF189.
  NUP1 and other unidentified transporters are involved in the nicotine transport.
  Insecticidal nicotine, especially under the induction of JA, is transported out
  of the vacuoles, moved upward to vegetative tissues through the xylem and uploaded
  into leaf cells by NUP1. AO, aspartate oxidase; QS, quinolinate synthase; quinolinate
  phosphoribosyltransferase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; PMT, putrescine N-methyltransferase;
  MPO, N-methylputrescine oxidase; BBL, berberine bridge enzyme-like proteins; A622,
  PIP-family protein; NUP, purine permease transporter.
