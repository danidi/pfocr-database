caption: Activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway downstream of multiple
  inflammatory cell surface receptors, such as interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), Toll-like
  receptor (TLR), tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and CD40, triggers the recruitment
  and ubiquitylation of many molecules with scaffolding and catalytic activities.
  Recent evidence suggests that multiple ubiquitin species join forces to bring spatial
  and temporal organization to the different branches of the NF-κB pathway. Distinct
  ubiquitin signals seem to be spatially restricted close to specific ubiquitin-binding
  proteins such as TAK1-binding 2 (TAB2) and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO; also
  known as IKKγ). TAB2 can bind Lys63-linked chains, which are produced by the E2
  complex of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13; also known as UBE2N) and UBE2
  variant 1A (UEV1A) and E3 ligases such as TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). NEMO
  can bind linear diubiquitin chains, produced by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly
  complex (LUBAC), which is composed of HOIL1-interacting protein (HOIP), haeme-oxidized
  IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL1; also known as RBCK1) and SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting
  protein (SHARPIN). NEMO can also bind longer ubiquitin chains with variable linkages,
  including Lys11, which is generated by the E2 UBCH5 and E3 ligase cellular inhibitor
  of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1). Regardless of which pathway is activated and by
  what type of ubiquitin chain, all scenarios result in the activation of the inhibitor
  of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex. Following activation, the IKKs phosphorylate
  the inhibitory IκBα, thus creating a binding site for the Skp–cullin–F-box–βTrCP
  (SCFβTrCP) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. This triggers the Lys48-linked ubiquitylation
  and subsequent proteasomal degradation of IκBα. NF-κB (made up of p50 and p65) can
  then translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes promoting
  cell survival and inflammation. IRAK, IL-1R-associated kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal
