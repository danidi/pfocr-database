caption: 'Metabolic pathway of the compatible solute ectoine in H. elongata. The degradation
  pathway is based on genetic and chromatographic analysis carried out in this study.
  Shown here is the hydrolysis of ectoine that leads directly to Nγ- and Nα-acetyl-l-2,4-diaminobutyric
  acid. For more details on DoeA activity see text. The depicted ectoine biosynthesis
  pathway is according to studies previously published (; ; ). LysC: aspartate kinase;
