caption: Canonical JAK–STAT signaling. A simplified schematic representation of the
  Drosophila JAK–STAT pathway, which is typical of the canonical JAK–STAT pathway,
  in which unphosphorylated STAT resides in the cytoplasm. JAK activates STAT by phosphorylation,
  leading to nuclear translocation of dimerized phospho-STAT, which functions as a
  transcription factor. Names of the Drosophila homologs are in parentheses.
