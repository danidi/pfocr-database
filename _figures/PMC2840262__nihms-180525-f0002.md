caption: The UPS degrades soluble misfolded proteins. Aberrant protein aggregation
  impairs proteasome proteolytic function and insufficient proteasome function in
  turn further accumulates misfolded proteins, thereby forming a vicious cycle. The
  inadequate or impaired UPS might activate the autophagy-lysosome pathway as a compensatory
  mechanism. The autophagy-lysosome pathway removes both soluble oligomers of misfolded
  proteins and protein aggregates. p62 and NBR1 recognize ubiquitinated proteins and
  mediate their autophagic degradation. HDAC6 binds to ubiquitinated proteins and
  facilitates their transportation along microtubules toward the microtubule organizing
  center (MTOC), where ubiquitinated proteins are organized into aggresomes. Moreover,
  the autophagic degradation of aggresomes is promoted by HDAC6. As co-chaperones,
  BAG1 and BAG3 regulate proteasomal and autophagic pathways, respectively.
