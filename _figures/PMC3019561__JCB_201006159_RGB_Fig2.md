caption: Mitochondria and the synthesis of phospholipids. (A) Schematic summary of
  phospholipid biosynthesis. Cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond in CDP-DAG provides
  the energetic driving force to catalytically replace CMP with inositol, G3P, or
  serine to form PI, PGP, or PS, respectively, using specific synthetic enzymes. PGP
  is dephosphorylated to produce PG. CL is synthesized from PG and CDP-DAG substrates
  with the catalytic cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond in the latter substrate providing
  the chemical energy to transfer the PA moiety to the vacant primary hydroxyl of
  PG. PS can be decarboxylated to PE, which in turn can be methylated to yield PC.
  Alternatively, PE and PC can be synthesized via an enzymatic cascade known as the
  Kennedy pathway. See Mitochondrial phospholipid biosynthesis for further details.

  synthesis of CL (B) and aminoglycerophospholipids (PE and PC; C). Yeast biosynthetic
  enzymes are indicated. PA synthesized in the ER or mitochondria drive biosynthetic
  reactions. CDP-DAG may derive from the ER/MAM or be generated at the mitochondrial
  inner membrane by the action of CDP-DAG synthase (Cds1; ). IM, mitochondrial inner
  membrane; OM, mitochondrial outer membrane.
