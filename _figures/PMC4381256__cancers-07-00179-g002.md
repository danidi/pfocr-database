caption: 'Functions of CDK4/Cyclin D and CDK5/p25. (A) Function and regulation of
  CDK4/cyclin D: The expression of cyclin D (orange) via mitogenic signals leads to
  its association with CDK4 (blue) and formation of the complex. The binding with
  Cip/Kip proteins (light purple) is required for complex assembly and its nuclear
  localization. The activity of CDK4/cyclin D activity is negatively regulated by
  interaction with the INK4 protein family (pink). Once activated, CDK4/cyclin D regulates
  the progression through G1 phase and the transition into S phase. CDK4/cyclin D
  phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (dark purple) inducing the derepression
  of E2F transcription factors (green) which allows the transcription of genes which
  are required for G1/S transition; (B) Different functions of CDK5 in the nervous
  system and schematic representation of CDK5 regulation through cleavage of p35 to
  p25 at the cellular membrane; when CDK5/p35 binds p27 and E2F1 and DP1 in the nucleus,
  the cell cycle is inactivated. When p27 is degraded CDK5/p35 returns to the cytoplasm
  and the cell death pathway is inactivated.'
