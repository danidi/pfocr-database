caption: Autophagy in mammalian cells can be activated by various stimuli. Although
  the suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a major signaling
  pathway regulating autophagy, autophagy can also be activated independent of mTOR
  by various stimuli. Two major pathways that regulate mTOR in mammalian cells are
  the PI3K-Akt and AMPK pathways. The PI3K-Akt pathway is triggered by the binding
  of insulin growth factors (IGF or other growth factors) to its receptor, thereby
  activating PI3K. Activated PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3 to activate Akt. Akt then
  phosphorylates and inactivates the TSC1/TSC2 complex resulting in activation of
  Rheb and mTOR. AMPK is normally activated by its upstream kinase LKB-1 or by an
  increased intracellular ratio of AMP/ATP. AMPK can be suppressed by chemical inhibitors
  such as compound C. Active AMPK then directly phosphorylates TSC2 and inhibits mTOR
  to activate autophagy. mTOR also phosphorylates two downstream targets 4E-BP1 and
  p70S6K that control protein translation.
