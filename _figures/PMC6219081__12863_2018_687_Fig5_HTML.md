caption: Gene networks comprised of SNPs and their associated drought-related gene
  expression and metabolite level phenotypes. Blue dot nodes represent SNPs. Details
  of the SNPs and the genes containing them are presented in Table . The blue dot
  nodes 13, 20, 57, 70, and 78 with a larger size represent the SNPs that reside in
  transcription factor (TF) genes. The yellow dot nodes represent genes, for which
  expression level was used as a phenotype trait in the SNP association analysis.
  The pink dot nodes represent metabolites, for which concentration level was used
  as a phenotype trait in the SNP association analysis. The grey and red edges represent
  SNP-gene-expression and SNP-metabolite-level associations, respectively. The purple
  edges represent SNP-SNP interactions that significantly impact the phenotypes. Expressed
  genes in the network include drought signaling genes (ABI1, NCED, and RPK1), drought-responsive
  TF genes (NAC1, RAP2.1, RAP2.4, and ATAF-1), late embryogenesis abundant protein
  genes (PtEMB3–4), phenylpropanoid pathway gene (ANR)
