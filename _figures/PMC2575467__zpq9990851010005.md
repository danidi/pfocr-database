caption: A model of KCNQ1/KCNE1 function in embryogenesis. (A) A parsimonious model
  of the data proposes that KCNE1 modifies the function of KCNQ1, which up-regulates
  Sox10 and its downstream targets, such as XSlug. These factors are known to be necessary
  and sufficient for the observed up-regulation of proliferation, change in cell shape,
  and induction of invasive migration behavior in melanocytes. (B) Embryonic regions
  expressing KCNE1 induce up-regulation of key transcription factors, such as Sox10
  and Slug, in other cells in the neural crest population, which confers upon them
  a hyperproliferative, invasive phenotype. This illustrates a non-cell-autonomous
  mechanism by which ion flows are transduced into canonical transcription cascades
  that control cell behavior. Black dashed lines indicate migration of hyperproliferating
  offspring of the target (green) cell. The original event takes place in the cell
  expressing KCNE1 (blue), which does not itself contribute all of the proliferative
  offspring. The target cell may induce the XSox10 pathway in neighbors by conventional
  biochemical signals (e.g., BMPs, FGFs, and WNTs). The direct biophysical interaction
  occurs in the target cell, where KCNE1-mediated loss of membrane polarization is
  relayed to the downstream signaling machinery by cell-autonomous mechanisms.
