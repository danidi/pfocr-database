caption: Pathways by which BrdU impairs epithelial repair and induces persistent inflammation
  in the chronic NA injury model. BrdU induces genotoxic stress, which activates the
  DNA damage response, thereby promoting premature senescence, which results in the
  growth arrest of epithelial cells. Genotoxic stress caused by BrdU also activates
  p38-MAPK pathways that trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines,
  which exacerbate inflammation. Which is necessary for p38-MAPK activation, the DNA
  damage response or cell cycle arrest (p21, etc.), has not been determined (broken
  arrows). Recent evidence indicates that pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6,
  IL-8) at least in part reinforce cell cycle arrest via the DNA damage response pathway
  [,], suggesting a positive feedback loop (dashed arrow) in which inflammation in
  turn promotes senescence.
