caption: Network built up with the genes included in the endodermal carcinogenic gene
  signature (ECGS) derived from ToxoFunctions identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) analyses. The differentially regulated genes (grey nodes) mapped to pathway
  annotations derived from literature and gene ontology using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA)). The solid lines connecting molecules represents a direct relation and dotted
  lines an indirect relation. IPA constructs networks that optimize for both interconnectivity
  and number of Focus Genes (the grey nodes) under the constraint of a maximal network
  size. White nodes are added by the algorithm to build a highly connected molecular
  network between Focus Genes.
