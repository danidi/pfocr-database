caption: 'NaB inhibited HDAC activity and improved AMP expression, even following
  challenge with the TLR2 ligand peptidoglycan. The mechanism: NaB leads to IκB α
  degradation, a reduction of p50 transcription and an increase in p65 phosphorylation,
  subsequently activating the NF-κB pathway and leading to enhanced AMP transcription
  via TLR2. The MAPK pathway also plays a role in the regulation of AMPs by NaB. NaB
  reversed the down-regulation of AMPs induced by the TLR2 ligand peptidoglycan by
  inhibiting the levels of p65 and decreasing p50 transcription and even IκB α degradation,
  which are key factors in the NF-κB pathway. Finally, overexpression of pBD3 protein
  regulated the expression of other cytokines in porcine kidney cells.'
