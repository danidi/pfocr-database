caption: Model of hyperphosphorylation of tau caused by the expression of a dominant-negative
  mutant form of PP2A Cα in transgenic mice. Our data suggest that hyperphosphorylation
  of tau at distinct phospho-epitopes is mediated not only directly by reduced PP2A
  activity toward tau, but also indirectly by the activation of the ERK and JNK pathway.
  As PP2A is a heterotrimeric protein which is formed by at least 20 different subunits,
  the different actions of PP2A may be mediated by distinct holoenzyme complexes of
  PP2A.
