caption: 'Leptin receptor isoforms and intracellular signaling. (A) Leptin receptor
  is composed of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic
  domain. All variants of the leptin receptor include the extracellular domain. The
  extracellular domain is composed of several protein motifs: the N terminal domain
  (NTD), two cytokine receptor homology (CRH) domains that make up the leptin binding
  site, an immunoglobulin-like domain (IGD), and two fibronectin type 3 (FN III) domains.
  The cytoplasmic domain of leptin receptor varies between isoforms. LRb, the long
  form receptor, includes two box domains and several tyrosine residues important
  for leptin receptor signaling. The other leptin receptor variants are labeled LRa,
  LRc, LRd, LRf and they all have the complete extracellular binding domain, but their
  intracellular tails differ; however, they all contain the two box domains. There
  is also a soluble form of leptin receptor in both humans and mice called LRe. In
  mice, LRe is directly secreted, while in humans, LRe is generated by ectodomain
  shedding (metalloproteases cut the receptor off the surface). (B) Leptin receptor
  isoforms are generated by alternative splicing or processing at the cell membrane.
  The long form of leptin receptor, also known as LRb, is the only known receptor
  variant that is capable of signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway. LRb has a long
  intracellular tail that includes several tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated
  for signal transduction by JAK2. LRb signaling primarily occurs through the JAK2/STAT3
  pathway, with STAT3 translocating to the nucleus to modify gene expression. LRb
  also signals through the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK pathway. These pathways in
  immune cells have been shown to lead to metabolic and functional changes, which
  could account for the pleiotropic effects of leptin on different immune cell types
