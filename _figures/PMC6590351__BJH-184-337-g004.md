caption: Potential therapeutic target proposed to block leukaemia properties induced
  by the presence of CBFA2T3‐GLIS2. Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) inhibitors repress proliferation
  interfering with cell cycle and engages terminal differentiation of megakaryoblastic
  leukaemia cells (Thiollier et al, ). Small peptides, such as NC128, interfere with
  the NHR2 domain of CBFA2T3 moiety disrupting the complex and abrogating growth of
  AMKL cells in‐vivo (Thirant et al, ). Treatment with GLI inhibitors interferes with
  expression pathway induced by CBFA2T3‐GLIS2. The specific interaction between GANT61
  and GLIS2 remains to be formally demonstrated (Masetti et al, ). DiMF, dimethylfasudil.
