caption: ER stress and autophagy in AD. Both mPSEN1 (mutant PSEN1) and Aβ induce calcium-dependent
  ER stress, resulting in astrogliosis and neuronal injury. Loss of BECN1 not only
  contributes to neuronal damage but also debilitates the phagocytic function and
  induces inflammatory responses in microglia. Interestingly, mPSEN1 renders neurons
  vulnerable to ER stress by suppressing major UPR mediators while MAPT protein enhances
  its phosphorylation through activation of UPR mediators, especially EIF2AK3. The
  EIF2AK3-dependent autophagy pathway is crucial for degradation of Aβ, and autophagic
  activities can be also enhanced by genetic deletion of CSTB/cystatin B or treatment
  with temsirolimus. However, autophagy mediated by EIF2AK3 signaling also activates
  GSK3B by removing its inactive form resulting in subsequent phosphorylation and
  aggregation of MAPT protein. Moreover, ATPase inhibitors for HSPA/DNAJ complexes
  and HSP90 multi-component complexes facilitate the triage of MAPT toward the ERAD
  pathway. CLU and TTR are able to bind to aggregated proteins to prevent their aggregation.
