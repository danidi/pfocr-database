caption: Main metabolism pathway of tamoxifen. After absorption tamoxifen is metabolized
  mainly by CYP2D6 in its active metabolite endoxifen. Tamoxifen relies on phase II
  metabolism before it can be excreted from the body. Endoxifen is ultimately glucuronidated
  into endoxifen-glucuronide mainly by UGTs. Several in vitro studies suggest inhibition
  by green tea of several phase I enzymes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and inhibition of several
  drug-transporters which the efflux transporter P-gP (ABCB1) and sever influx-transporters
  like OATP. P-gP P-glycoprotein, CYP cytochrome P450, OATP organic anion transporting
  polypeptide, UGT UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
