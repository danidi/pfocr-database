caption: 'The rate of lactose synthesis is an important driver of milk production
  level. Panel A: Strong up-regulation of genes encoding lactose synthesis enzymes
  occurs between colostral and transitional stages; Panel B: UDP-Glucose production
  (PGM) is attenuated between transitional and mature stages. Notably, this occurs
  while LALBA continues to increase in expression. Panels A-B: Gene symbols are detailed
  in . Color denotes change in gene expression from colostrum to transitional (Panel
  A) or transitional to mature (Panel B): red = significant increase; green = significant
  decrease; and yellow = no significant change in gene express levels between stages.
  Differences with p<0.05 after adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing (method = “BH”)
  were deemed statistically significant. Footnotes: * more than one member of this
  gene family is expressed >0.5 FPKM; – Alternate pathway for producing UDP-Galactose;
  SLC–?, specific family member that translocates D-Galactose is not known.'
