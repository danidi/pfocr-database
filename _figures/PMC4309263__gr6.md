caption: Schematic representation of the reciprocal auto-sustaining loop between Jagged1
  ligand and Notch3 receptor in T-ALL. (A) The Jagged-1–triggered transactivation
  induces cleavage of Notch, by sequential activation of ADAM10/TACE and γ-secretase,
  to generate Notch-IC. In a T ALL cell context, a Notch3-IC–driven transcriptional
  complex activates the Jagged1 target gene, by constitutively binding the canonical
  RBP-Jκ binding site spanning between − 997 and − 991 bp in the Jagged1 promoter.
  (B) The constitutive expression of Notch3 intracellular domain in thymocytes and
  lymphoma cells from N3-ICtg mice determines a Notch3/Jagged1 cis-expression within
  the same cell and a constitutive raft-dependent Jagged1 processing, whose result
  is the empowering of Notch3 signaling. The Jagged1 intracellular domain is able
  to translocate into the nucleus where it is recruited specifically by the Notch3
  transcriptional complex (Notch3-IC + MAML1 + RBP-Jκ), acting as a co-activator able
  to sustain the activation of specific target genes, such as pTα and Jagged1 itself
  (autocrine effect). On the other hand, the shedding of soluble extracellular domain
  of Jagged1 (sJag1-ECD) has a positive impact on triggering Notch signaling pathway
  in neighboring cells (paracrine effect).
