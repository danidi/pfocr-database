caption: Proposed model for Marf-mediated ER stress in FRDA flies. (A) Model suggested
  by our results. In short, mitofusin regulates the ER stress response in frataxin-deficient
  glia likely by mitochondria-ER tethering. Marf silencing is able to normalize the
  altered ER stress response and concomitantly to reverse the locomotor dysfunction,
  the brain degeneration and the accumulation of lipid droplets. (B) Hypothetical
  graphical model showing that ER-mitochondrial contacts might be mediating different
  phenotypes described in FRDA models. On the one hand, frataxin deficiency increases
  mitochondrial iron concentration. In parallel, iron stimulates sphingolipid synthesis
  in the ER. Sphingolipids activate the Pdk1/Mef2 pathway and might induce ER stress
  leading to cell death. Whether a transport of iron from the mitochondria to the
  ER is underpinning this effect still has to be demonstrated (Fe?). On the other
  hand, frataxin downregulation in mammalian cells has been shown to abolish mitochondrial
  buffering capacity for calcium. This results in an increased concentration of cytosolic
  calcium by inhibiting SERCA pumps, downregulating the calcium transporter NCLx and
  opening the MPTP. High calcium activates the nNOS pathway and the transcription
  factors CREB and NFAT3, leading also to cell death. Importantly, some crucial sphingolipids
  are synthesized in the MAMs and MAMs play critical roles in the regulation of Calcium
  homeostasis. Ca, Calcium; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; ER, Endoplasmic
  Reticulum; Fe, Iron; MAMs, Mitochondria-associated membranes, Mef2, myocyte enhancer
  factor-2; MPTP, Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore; nNOS, Neuronal nitric
  oxide synthases; Pdk1, 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1.
