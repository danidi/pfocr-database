caption: Proposed role of luteolin in attenuating hepatic and adipocyte fibrosis and
  insulin resistance by targeting the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway in high-fat-fed
  mice. Luteolin improved chronic low-grade inflammation by modulating the TLR signaling
  pathway, resulting in suppression of hepatic and adipocyte fibrosis by decreasing
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipokine dysregulation, macrophage and extracellular
  matrix accumulation, and captesin gene expressions. Interestingly, Emr1 and Ccl7,
  important markers inducing low-grade inflammation, were affected by advanced age
  and greater body weight, which were normalized by luteolin treatment. Moreover,
  luteolin prevented hepatic lipotoxicity via an increase in uptake of FFA into adipocytes
  from plasma [] and the hepatic antioxidant system, which was linked to activation
  of lipogenesis in adipose tissue mediated via Tlr5, Map2k7, Mapk12, Mapk13, and
  Mapk9 gene expressions; further, Tlr5 may be a key transcription factor for luteolin-mediated
  lipotoxicity protection. Decreased plasma FFA levels by luteolin were associated
  with improved pancreatic islet dysfunction, which all contribute to improvement
  of lipotoxicity, fibrosis, and insulin resistance.
