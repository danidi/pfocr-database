caption: 'Spatial regulation of non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic processing of
  APP. Dysregulated amyloid precursor protein (APP) trafficking and processing underlies
  the most prominent hallmark of disease in AD affected areas, represented by an abundance
  of Aβ soluble oligomers, fibrils and plaques. Non-amyloidogenic processing starts
  with APP shedding by ADAM10, mainly at the cell surface but as well in the trans-Golgi
  network []. Hereafter, the remaining carboxyterminal fragments (CTFs), C83, are
  processed by γ-secretase to produce harmless p3 peptides and an intracellular domain
  (inset a). In the amyloidogenic pathway (inset b for details), which occurs more
  dominantly in neurons, APP is cleaved first by BACE1 preferentially in endosomes.
  This endosomal encountering is spatially regulated as BACE1 and APP are found to
  follow distinct internalization itineraries, the former mediated through ARF6 and
  GGA3 []. C99 is further processed by γ-secretase in recycling and degradative endosomes.
  It is first cut at position 48 or 49 of the Aβ sequence (ε-cleavage), followed by
  a carboxypeptidase-like trimming every three amino acids. This results in the production
  of different Aβ peptides of which the longer ones, like Aβ42 and Aβ43, are more
  aggregation-prone. γ-Secretase assembly is thought to occur stepwise during ER-Golgi
  recycling []. Assembled PSEN1 complexes (PSEN1/γ) are active at the cell surface
  and in sorting/recycling endosomes, while PSEN2 complexes (PSEN2/γ) reside in late
  endosomes/lysosomes due to an aminoterminal sorting motif that selectively binds
  AP-1. PICALM may mediate internalization of PSEN1/γ, while CD2AP in neurons sorts
  APP into intraluminal vesicles of MVBs for degradation in lysosomes, instead of
  through secretase-mediated processing pathways. BIN1 intervenes in recycling BACE1
  to the cell surface as well as to lysosomes. BACE1 and APP sorting between distinct
  compartments involves several other sorting proteins and adaptor complexes of which
  some are depicted in this figure: such as GGA1, SNX17, retromer and SorLA'
