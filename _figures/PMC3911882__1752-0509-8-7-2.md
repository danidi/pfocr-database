caption: Summary of FL enzymatic and transcription factor gene targets. Genes affected
  by fluconazole (FL) investigated in this study are enzymes along the ergosterol
  biosynthetic pathway (circles) and transcription factors directly regulated by sterol
  and heme levels (squares). ERG11, the gene that codes for lanosterol C-14-α demethylase,
  is the primary target of FL. CYP450 C-22 sterol desaturase, ERG5 (circle), is also
  a target of FL and its enzymatic activity is inhibited upon FL binding. FL’s nitrogen
  interacts with the heme groups of both Erg11p and Erg5p disrupting normal ergosterol
  synthesis and affecting downstream enzymatic reactions, including those performed
  by Δ[]-sterol C-methyltransferase, Erg6p (circle). FL disruption of sterol biosynthesis
  additionally affects UPC2 (square), the gene that encodes for a sterol regulatory
  binding protein responsible for increased transcription of ERG genes upon sterol
  depletion. FL induces defective respiration due to its disruption of heme and oxygen
  levels. Therefore, HAP1 (square), a transcription factor responsible for regulating
  ERG11 expression under hypoxic conditions, is also targeted.
