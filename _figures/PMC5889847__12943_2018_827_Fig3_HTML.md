caption: circRNAs function as ceRNAs in the regulation of apoptosis in tumor cells.
  The expression of c-MYC affects apoptosis. One pathway consists of stabilizing p53
  through ARF, whereas a second pathway involves a mechanism independent of the apoptotic
  pathway involving FasL and DNA damage []; the mechanism of kissing apoptosis involves
  the activation of the Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX), thereby promoting the release
  cytochrome C from mitochondria and triggering apoptosis. In this signaling pathway,
  circRNAs also function as ceRNAs. CircCCDC66 can promote apoptosis by inhibiting
  miR-93, thereby promoting the expression of c-MYC. However, circUBAP2 can control
  cancer by reducing Bcl-2 levels as a consequence of sequestering miR-143
