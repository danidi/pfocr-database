caption: Intracellular osmolarity changes trigger cellular responses for volume regulation.
  Under hypertonic extracellular conditions, water extrudes from the cells and causes
  cell shrinkage, triggering a counter-response of regulatory volume increase (RVI).
  In this condition, the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway is activated and phosphorylates NKCC1
  and KCCs, resulting in NKCC1activation and KCCs inhibition. This subsequently leads
  to influx of Na+, K+ and Cl- via NKCC1 along with water, thus restoring cell volume.
  On the contrary, cell swelling due to hypotonic stress elicits regulatory volume
  decrease (RVD), in which the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway remains inactive and NKCC1 and
  KCCs are dephosphorylated. This results in NKCC1 inhibition but stimulation of KCCs,
  which lead to KCC-mediated efflux of K+ and Cl- along with water, and cell volume
  decrease.
