caption: Schemes of the Ethylene Biosynthetic, Signaling, and Response Pathways.Key
  elements of the pathways are displayed in a linear manner and are connected by arrows.
  A previously established link between auxin and ethylene biosynthesis is indicated.
  The new branch in the ethylene response pathway that connects ethylene with auxin
  biosynthesis is highlighted by a gray box. SAM, S-adenosyl-Met.
