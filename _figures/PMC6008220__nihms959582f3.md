caption: Methyl-specific endonuclease digestion followed by RT-PCR was performed on
  isolated DNA from CD4+ T cells from helminth infected or uninfected children. Genes
  outlined in pink expressed increased DNA methylation in helminth-infected children
  compared to uninfected age-matched controls. n = 6 per group. A) Th1 Signaling Pathway.
  B) IFN-γ signaling pathway.
