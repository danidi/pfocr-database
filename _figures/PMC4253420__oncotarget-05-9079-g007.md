caption: PRL produced locally in the normal and tumoral breast activates the JAK2/STAT5
  pathway via the long form of the PRLR. The pSTAT5 bound to a GAS element located
  in the non-coding exon 1 of the PRLR associates with pERα recruited to Sp1 and C/EBPβ
  bound to their sites at the hPRLR promoter causing increase hPRLR transcription,
  mRNA and protein. PRL/PRLR, independent of estrogen, induces ERα phosphorylation
  (via the JAK2/PI3K-MEK-ERK pathway), nuclear translocation, and complex formation
  by its recruitment to Sp1/C/EBPβ bound to their DNA sites at the promoter and transcriptional
  activation. PRL/PRLR activates JAK2 which phosphorylates HER2 and activates several
  pathways which in turn may cause phosphorylation of ERα. The series of molecular
  events induced by endogenous PRL via PRLR causing up-regulation of its cognate receptor
  could participate in breast cancer progression and explain resistance to endocrine
  therapy.
