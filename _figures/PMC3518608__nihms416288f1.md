caption: Potential mechanisms of protein nitrosothiol formation and degradation. Activation
  of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) results in NO production and auto-S-nitrosation.
  S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) or protein nitrosothiols can be generated from NO through
  either a transition metal catalyzed pathway, thiyl radical recombination, NO oxidation
  to N2O3, or transnitrosation with protein nitrosothiols such as NOS. Once formed,
  GSNO or S-nitrosated NOS can transfer nitrosothiols to other proteins through transnitrosation
  reactions. Degradation of nitrosothiols can occur through direct denitrosation of
  GSNO by the NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes GSNO reductase (GSNOR) or carbonyl reductase
  1 (CBR1). Thioredoxin (Trx) can denitrosate protein nitrosothiols, a process that
  becomes catalytic through the activity of thioredoxin reductase (Trx).
