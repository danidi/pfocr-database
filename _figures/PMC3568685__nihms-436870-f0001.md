caption: Active and passive cell deaths. Passive cell death occurs when a vital cellular
  function is directly damaged or inhibited, thus killing the cell. Active cell death
  can be of two forms. One can be classified as cellular `suicide,' in which a pathway
  that is specialized for cell death signaling is engaged. The best example of this
  is apoptosis, although there may be others. Alternatively, cell death can be active
  -- that is, a cell participates in its own demise -- if cellular processes are `sabotaged'
  such that the continuation of the process is lethal. This distinction may prove
  useful in understanding why there appear to be so many ways that cells can actively
  die (images from iStockphoto.com).
