caption: The differences in glucose metabolism between normal and cancerous tissues
  are shown. Oxidative phosphorylation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which
  yields large quantities of ATP, is the dominant metabolic pathway in differentiated
  cells. Cancer cells, in contrast, preferentially use glycolysis, which is assumed
  to be driven by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and yields numerous precursors of
  cell constituents, but limited amounts of ATP.
