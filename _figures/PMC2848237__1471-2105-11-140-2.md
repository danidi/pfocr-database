caption: Reconstruction of a KEGG pathway. In this figure we present the KEGG pathway
  (A) and the reconstructed analogue of our ENFRN-based method. A grey shaded rectangle
  represents genes that compose a complex. The edges inside these circles are considered
  as correct edges since genes inside the same circle will co-express with some delay.
  In blue colour we have correct determined interactions, in dotted blue we have interactions
  that are true via an intermediate gene and false interactions are indicated in red
  colour. 71.4% of the interactions extracted were in absolute accordance with biological
  knowledge, and this percentage rose to 85.7% when considering the interactions that
  were correct via an intermediate gene.
