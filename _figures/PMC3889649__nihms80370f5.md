caption: 'The GLI1 target genes converge on a regulatory pathway that suggests roles
  in cell proliferation, survival and genomic stability. Genes in yellow represent
  GLI1 targets identified by our analysis. Genes in blue, identified in the literature,
  are included based on a connection to the experimentally recognized genes. Dotted
  lines connect GLI1 targets, whether direct or indirect, identified here experimentally.
  Solid lines represent connections between genes identified in the literature. Green
  lines represent genes that are activated. Red lines represent genes that are repressed.
  Blue lines represent genes that are both activated and repressed. The following
  genes, shown here to be altered by GLI1, have not been previously published as controlled
  directly or indirectly by GLI1: PLTP, GATM, PRKCH, TST, SLIT2, SLC19A1, KIDINS220,

  factor 4; E2F1, E2F transcription factor 1; TAF1, TATA-binding protein associated
  factor 1; PLCG1, phospholipase C, gamma-1; CSNK2A1, casein kinase 2, alpha 1; FYN,
  FYN oncogene related to SRC; GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; PRNP,
  prion protein; AP1, adaptor-related protein 1; Bcl2, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2; CREB1,
