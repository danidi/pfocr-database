caption: We propose that in addition to being stimulated by several signals that regulate
  hepcidin such as iron, BMP6, erythropoeitic drive, and hypoxia, TMPRSS6 expression
  is also inhibited indirectly by IL-6. IL-6 stimulates hepcidin expression through
  the induction of STAT3 phosphorylation and through the stimulation of the BMP6-HJV-SMAD
  pathway activity, leading to binding of p-STAT3 on STAT3-responsive element (STAT3-RE)
  and SMAD complexes to BMP-responsive elements (BMP-REs) on the hepcidin promoter.
  In parallel, inflammation through IL-6 and/or through another non-identified cytokine,
  inhibits the STAT5 phosphorylation leading to a decrease of P-STAT5 binding on the
  STAT5-responsive element (STAT5-RE) of the TMPRSS6 promoter resulting in a decrease
  of TMPRSS6 expression. TMPRSS6 is a negative feedback inhibitor of BMP-SMAD pathway
  activity and hepcidin expression by cleaving the BMP co-receptor HJV. By inhibiting
  this negative feedback, TMPRSS6 participates to the hepcidin increase in response
  to IL-6.
