caption: 'Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling pathway(s) upon CpG oligodeoxynucleotides
  (CpG-ODN) stimulation: CpG-ODN is internalized through endosomes where it interacts
  with the endosomic domain of TLR9. In the subsequent signaling cascade, the cytosolic
  domain of TLR9 interacts with the adaptor proteins MyD88 or TRIF in the cytosol.
  Depending on the adapter engaged, a different signaling cascade occurs. MyD88 signaling
  (red) is triggered when TLR9 is agonized by a low CpG-ODN concentration. This cascade
  leads to the induction of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways, AP1 and
  IRF7 transcription factors, inducing inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-12,
  IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23. TRIF signaling (green) is triggered when TLR9 is agonized
  by a high concentration of CpG-ODN. In contrast to the MyD88 signaling pathway,
  the TRIF cascade leads to the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB and IRF3. These
  transcription factors will induce the production of type 1 IFN and anti-inflammatory
  molecules such as TGF-β and IDO. When LPS is present (orange), TLR4 and TLR9 signals
  are combined to engage MyD88 leading to an enhanced inflammatory reaction by the
  increased production of IL-12 and TNF-α.'
