caption: A model depicting MED13 regulation of NURR1–MEF2 activity and the influence
  of skeletal muscle MED13 on liver steatosis. (A) MED13 represses SIK1 expression,
  which allows activation of MEF2 and its target genes, including Nurr1. MED13 represses
  the expression and activity of Nurr1, which acts together with MEF2 as an activator
  of Glut4 and other genes involved in glucose metabolism in muscle. In the absence
  of MED13, MEF2 activates Nurr1 transcription. Consequently, increased NURR1 expression,
  together with MEF2, activates Glut4 transcription. (B) In HFD-induced insulin resistance,
  insulin fails to promote muscle glucose uptake and disposal, therefore directing
  glucose to de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Increased insulin and glucose levels
  in the HFD-induced insulin-resistant state stimulate hepatic nutrient sensors to
  drive the expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. Under HFD conditions,
  MED13 exerts a repressive effect on glucose handling genes through the NURR1/MEF2
  regulatory pathway. (C) Med13 deletion in skeletal muscle leads to an increase in
  the expression of glucose-handling genes and Nurr1 expression that generates an
  insulin-sensitizing effect with enhanced skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen
  storage, which improves hyperinsulinemia. This effect is sensed primarily by the
  liver and influences it in two ways. First, since MED13-mKO skeletal muscle disposes
  of and stores glucose as glycogen, less glucose is diverted to the liver for lipid
  storage. Second, it leads to a decrease in compensatory insulin secretion by the
  pancreas followed by a reduction of hyperinsulinemia that results in decreased hepatic
  lipogenesis. Red arrows represent the processes occurring in CTL mice in HFD conditions.
  Green arrows represent the processes occurring in MED13-mKO mice in HFD conditions.
