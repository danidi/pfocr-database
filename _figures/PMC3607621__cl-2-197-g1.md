caption: 'Figure 1. The mechanisms by which AMPK regulate NADPH homeostasis during
  energy stress. When glucose is available, NADPH is generated by the PPP and mitochondrial
  metabolism. NADPH is consumed in FAS and in regeneration of GSH to detoxify ROS.
  Energy stress conditions, such as glucose deprivation or matrix detachment, which
  decrease glucose metabolism, impair NADPH production by the PPP. Under these conditions,
  AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios are increased and the LKB1-AMPK pathway is activated.
  Matrix detachment also activates the CaMKK2-AMPK pathway. Oxidative stress is also
  known to activate AMPK through poorly understood mechanisms. Activated AMPK could
  inhibit cell proliferation through the inhibition of mTORC1. However, AMPK also
  phosphorylates and inactivates ACC1 and ACC2, which result in the inhibition of
  FAS and activation of FAO respectively. Inhibition of FAS reserves intracellular
  NADPH levels by blocking NADPH consumption during FAS. The activation of FAO increases
  NADPH production by increasing TCA cycle metabolites and substrates for ME1 and
  IDH1 that generate NADPH from malate and isocitrate respectively (for details see
  text). Abbreviations: PY, pyruvate; OA, oxaloacetate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate'
