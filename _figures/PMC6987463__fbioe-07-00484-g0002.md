caption: The biosynthetic pathway for propionyl-CoA. (A) The metabolic pathway by
  which propionyl-CoA is synthesized from glucose. The genes overexpressed in this
  study are shown in blue. Pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to oxaloacetate
  by pyruvate carboxylase, and oxaloacetate is converted to threonine through the
  biosynthesis of aspartate and homoserine. Threonine deaminase subsequently generates
  α-ketobutyrate from threonine. Then, α-ketobutyrate is converted to propionyl-CoA
  by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. (B) Structure of the multigene modules
  encoding enzymes in the aspartate/α-ketobutyrate pathway that were constructed in
  this study. Each gene expression cassette included the native TEF1 promoter and
  LIP2 terminator. (C) The genes included in the modules and the enzymes they encode.
