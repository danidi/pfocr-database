caption: Schematic showing actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways in adult hippocampal
  spines (see []) and the proposed mechanisms by which the glucocorticoid receptor
  (GR) affects actin assembly and stabilization. The GR is represented as being both
  membrane bound (mb) and in the cytoplasm (c) (see []). Shown are the major Rho GTPase
  signaling pathways involved in regulating spine F-actin assembly and stabilization.
  Activation of Rho A leads to the phosphorylation of cofilin which blocks its constitutive
  F-actin severing activities thus promoting filament assembly (i.e., polymerization).
  Newly polymerized actin undergoes “treadmilling”, a process whereby actin monomers
  are continuously removed from one end and added to the other end of the filaments,
  prior to stabilization by processes that involve activation of Cdc42/Rac and Ras/Raf
  pathways. The present results demonstrate that in spines DEX-induced GR activation
  reduces levels of phosphorylated cofilin, which is down-stream of the Rho GTPase
  Rho A and it’s effector ROCK; the exact mechanism by which this negative (−) action
  occurs is not known, but could arise through inhibition of RhoA or its downstream
  effectors, or activation of phosphatases (not shown). By comparison, the estrogen
  receptor (ER) markedly facilitates (+) activation of RhoA and increases phosphorylated
  cofilin levels and actin polymerization in adult hippocampal spines []. Recent work
  showing that dephosphorylation of cofilin reduces GR activation [] also is illustrated
  (grey pathway), although this negative feedback mechanism has not been confirmed
  in spines. GR activation also increases spine levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, possibly
  via the activation of Rho GTPases Ras/Raf, which can affect both actin stabilization
  via cortactin and actin rearrangement via myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and its
  effects on myosin. Activation of GR does not increase pPAK suggesting that the receptor
  does not influence the Cdc42/Rac>PAK pathway.
