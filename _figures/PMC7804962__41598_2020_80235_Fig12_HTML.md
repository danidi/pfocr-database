caption: Proposed mechanistic pathways of mercury-induced toxicity to spermatozoa.
  Mercury-induced necrosis and death of spermatozoa seems to involve two independent
  pathways; mercury results in increase in levels of ROS and MDA and reduces total
  antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and these ultimately
  result in decreased membrane intactness and cell death. Oxidative stress also results
  in lowered mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) that may lead to increase
  in cAMP level and increased intracellular Ca++ release from spermatozoa that increase
  spontaneous acrosome reactions (AR) and reduction of capacitation which ultimately
  lead to reduction of sperm fertilizing ability. Altogether, mercury leads ROS-induced
  cell death via necrosis rather than apoptosis pathway. Necrosis seems to be the
  dominant signaling pathway in mercury-induced sperm death, and it may be due to
  major damage to ultra-structures of sperm cells.
