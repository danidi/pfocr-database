caption: The Bacillus subtilis set of two component signaling pathways. The Gram-positive
  model organism B. subtilis reveals a set of 29 TCS signaling pathways, about the
  average for bacterial genomes. The modular SK proteins feature variable sets of
  signal detection domains (in blue) and most are transmembrane spanning proteins.
  Most RR proteins feature a DNA-binding transcription factor domain (green). The
  SK is defined by a structurally conserved autokinase catalytic core, which features
  a dimeric four-helix bundle HisKA (also referred to as DHp) domain (red rectangles),
  subject to phosphorylation by the ATP-binding (also referred to as CA) domain (red
  diamonds). The RR proteins are defined by a structurally conserved phosphoacceptor
  domain (red circle), which is subject to phosphorylation by the HisKA domain of
  the SK. Despite the conservation of the structural elements almost all pathways
  appear monogamously mated. A special case is the sporulation phosphorelay, in which
  five SK converge to phosphorylate a single RR Spo0F, which transfers its phosphoryl
  group to a second SK like protein Spo0B. The complex of Spo0B and Spo0F was the
  first structurally resolved example of the SK/RR interaction and has long served
  as a model to explain SK/RR fidelity. For clarity the chemotaxis pathway, which
  feature a structurally distinct kinase CheA and three RR proteins, CheY, CheB and
  CheV are excluded from the figure.
