caption: The Bx biosynthetic pathway and deglucosylation by β-glucosidase (Glu). The
  enzyme catalyzing each reaction is shown in a box. Black boxes indicate glucosyltransferase
  (GT) and Glu examined in this study. BX6 and BX7, which catalyze sequential 7-hydroxylation
  and 7-O-methylation of DIBOA-Glc to DIMBOA-Glc, have been identified in maize but
  not in wheat or rye. The GTs we identified have been designated TaGTs and ScGT in
  wheat and rye, respectively. The corresponding GTs in maize have been designated
  BX8 and BX9.
