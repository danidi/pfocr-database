caption: Some examples of 13C-labelling patterns in brain metabolism, based on results
  with singly labelled substrates (). Turquoise fills indicate 13C atoms. Yellow highlight
  indicates the metabolic pathway by which 13C-labelled lactate is processed via the
  TCA cycle, emerging as 13C-labelled glutamate or 13C-labelled glutamine that can
  be recovered in brain microdialysates. (For interpretation of the references to
  colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article.)
