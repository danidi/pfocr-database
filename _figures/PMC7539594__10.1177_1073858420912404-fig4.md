caption: Summary of the amyloid, tau, and inflammation hypotheses for Alzheimer’s
  disease. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a membrane protein that is proteolyticaly
  cleaved by multiple enzymes. The non-amyloidgenic pathway proceeds when APP is cleaved
  by the activity of α-secretase (α-sec) to soluble APP α (sAPPα) and APP carboxy
  terminal fragment α (APP-CTFα), these products are cleaved by γ-secretase (γ-sec)
  to produce truncated Aβ (p3) and the cytoplasmic polypeptide named AICD. The amyloidgenic
  pathway occurs when APP undergoes cleavage by β-secretase (β-sec) to form sAPPβ
  and APP-CTFβ. These proteins are cleaved by γ-sec to form AICD and amyloid-β (Aβ).
  In YOAD, mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 there is an increase in the 42-residue
  Aβ42, relative to Aβ40, which leads to an increase in Aβ oligomers and amyloid plaque
  formation (). Tau binds to microtubules and is important in cytoskeletal function.
  In AD, tau is hyperphosphorylated resulting in cytoskeletal dysfunction. Hyperphosphorylated
  tau detaches from microtubules and forms paired helical filaments that aggregate
  and form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Inflammation is hypothesized to contribute
  to cognitive loss in AD. Astrocytes and microglia are activated in the AD brain,
  releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α [TNFα], interleukin
  [IL]-1β, IL-6, interferon-γ [IFNγ]) and chemokines (e.g., MIP-1α and MIP-1β) resulting
  in neuronal death, either by directly damaging neurons or by failing in their normal
  function to clear aggregates from the brain (). There are multiple underlying molecular
  pathways leading to AD; intersecting pathways between amyloid, tau, inflammation,
  and other processes contribute to a complex mechanism that drives neurodegeneration.
