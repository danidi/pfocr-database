caption: A schematic pathway illustrating the role of ROS-dependent RhoA activation
  in collagen synthesis and lung fibrosis in oxygen toxicity. Hyperoxia induces the
  formation of ROS which causes RhoA-GDI dissociation and RhoA activation. RhoA activation
  leads to the increase in collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts and lung fibrosis
  caused by oxygen toxicity.
