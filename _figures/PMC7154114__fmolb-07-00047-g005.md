caption: Systems biology is an interdisciplinary field that involves computational
  and mathematical investigations for modeling a complex biological mechanism. This
  figure is a depiction of the genes in a lung cancer biochemical pathway and how
  they interact in a system. FOS, GTSE1, CDKN1C, and NMU could be the potential genes
  for further evaluation in this regard and may play an important role as biomarkers
  of lung cancer diagnosis. The CDKN1C, which is also known as p57kip2, is claimed
  to be a tumor suppressor considered to be a potential tumor suppressor caught up
  in lung cancer in humans. However, recent reports demonstrate CDKN1C in lung cancer
  is observed to be intensely down-regulated. The low expression of CDKN1C is expressively
  connected with overall poor survival rate shown in . In contrast, the growth-encouraging
  movement and augmented mobilization of cells are conferred by inducing an exogenous
  expression of NMU shown in . The GTSE1 gene is claimed to be involved in lung cancerous
  pathways because of its overexpression and negative regulation of p53 expression.
  It is also observed that its expression is linked with venous invasion, global short
  survival, and size of the tumor. FOS can be utilized as markers of poor prognosis
  of lung cancer shown in ,  as pathway for each species.
