caption: a |  In small adipocytes (lean condition), insulin promotes free fatty acid
  (FFA) esterification into triglycerides (TG, schematically represented as the three-carbon
  glycerol backbone with three acyl fatty acid chains (wavy lines)) through stimulation
  of glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT4)-mediated glucose uptake. Glucose can be converted
  to α-glycerol phosphate, the main source of the glycerol backbone of TG. Peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression
  and the TG biosynthetic pathway. Secreted LPL hydrolyses TG from circulating very
  low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), releasing FFAs to be re-esterified. Several thiazolidinediones
  (TZDs) can activate PPARγ. Insulin signalling also downregulates TG lipolysis through
  hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Insulin stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway leads to activation of the enzyme
  phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3). This enzyme catalyses the breakdown of cyclic AMP (cAMP)
  which in turn reduces activation of HSL. b |  In enlarged adipocytes from inflamed
  fat tissue, high levels of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) result in decreased fatty
  acid esterification and enhanced lipolysis. GLUT4, LPL and PPARγ protein levels
  are attenuated by TNFα, resulting in decreased glucose transport and fatty acid
  esterification. TNFα also has a stimulatory effect on lipolysis by increasing the
  levels of cAMP and activation (plus signal) of HSL, combined with the downregulation
  of perilipin through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
