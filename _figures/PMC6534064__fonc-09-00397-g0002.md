caption: A schematic presentation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and the drugs
  that interfere with this pathway in DTF. The graph depicts that inhibition of the
  Hedgehog pathway, by SMO inhibitors, works by blockage of Smoothened (SMO), a key
  regulator of downstream signaling by GLI transcription factors. The compound triparanol
  is known for inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis but can also interfere with
  Hedgehog signaling molecules including the Hedgehog ligand receptor Patched 1.
