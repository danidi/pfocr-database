caption: Schematic cartoons showing the proposed positive feedback loop in cervical
  cancer cells. Data in this study support the existence of an autocrine loop involving
  EGF-like ligands/EGFR pathway/Hippo pathway/EGF-like ligands in regulating the proliferation
  and motility of cervical cancer cells, which plays a critical role in cancer progression.
  Under normal conditions, low levels of EGF-like ligands such as TGF-α and AREG are
  not sufficient to activate EGFR. The inactive EGFR ensures the activation of Hippo
  signaling pathway, which in turn results in ubiquitination-dependent degradation
  of YAP protein. In cervical cancer tissues, especially the advanced-stage cancer
  tissues, the elevated nuclear YAP protein stimulates the expressions of TGF-α and
  AREG, which in turn activates the EGFR, leading to suppression of LATS1 and MOB1
  phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation of LATS1 and MOB1 results in the dissociation
  of LATS1/2-MOB1 complex, leading to inactivation of the Hippo pathway and subsequent
  activation of the growth-promoting co-activator YAP. Activated YAP induces expression
  of growth factors such as TGF-α and AREG to drive cervical cancer growth. YAP-induced
  growth factors such as TGF-α and AREG complete the autocrine loop by activating
  EGFR and YAP to drive the proliferation of cancer cell and the production of growth-promoting
  factors in cervical cancer cells. HPV E6 protein maintains YAP protein level in
  the HPV-infected normal and cancerous cervical cells by preventing YAP from proteasome-dependent
  protein degradation.  Schematic cartoons showing the clinical relevance of the proposed
  positive feedback loop in cervical cancer. Multidimensional cancer genomics data
  analysis indicates that very high frequency of alterations has been observed in
  genes involved in the Hippo/YAP/EGFR positive feedback loop in cervical cancer (we
