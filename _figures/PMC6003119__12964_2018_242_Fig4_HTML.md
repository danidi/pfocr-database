caption: Signaling mechanism that regulates the TFEB nuclear translocation and activation
  involved AKT/PKB. Under normal conditions, AKT/PKB is activated, leading to phosphorylation,
  decreased nuclear translocation and TFEB activation. The inhibition of AKT activity
  with pharmacological inhibitors promotes TFEB nuclear translocation, which enhanced
  the transcriptional regulation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway and increased cellular
  clearance [, ]
