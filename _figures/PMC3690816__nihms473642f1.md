caption: (A) Degradation. The lentiviral accessory protein Vpx antagonizes the host
  restriction factor SAMHD1 by targeting it for degradation, . Vpx bridges SAMHD1
  to an E3 Ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex, which ubiquitylates SAMHD1, thus targeting
  SAMHD1 for degradation by the proteasome. (B) Mislocalization and sequestration.
  The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu antagonizes the host restriction factor Tetherin
  by mislocalization leading to functional downregulation. Vpu interacts with tetherin
  at the plasma membrane and trafficks it to the early endosome. Tetherin is then
  sequestered in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it is unable to restrict viral
  budding from the cell surface, or degraded in the lysosome. (C) Mimicry. The poxvirus
  accessory protein K3L antagonizes the host PKR pathway by acting as a mimic of the
  PKR substrate, eIF2α. PKR is activated by binding to double-stranded RNA and induces
  an antiviral signaling pathway that leads to the inhibition of protein translation.
  By competing with eIF2α for binding to PKR, K3L prevents eIF2α from inhibiting translation.
