caption: Calcium-independent microtubule-dependent pathway is required for FcɛRI-mediated
  degranulation in mast cells. The FcɛRI-mediated signaling pathway can be dissected
  into calcium-dependent and calcium-independent pathways. The calcium-independent
  pathway is critical for microtubule-dependent translocation of granules to the plasma
  membrane, and this pathway is regulated by Fyn/Gab2/RhoA signaling.
