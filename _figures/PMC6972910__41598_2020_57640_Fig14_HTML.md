caption: Depiction of generation and effect of free radicals. Inside mitochondria,
  source of generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) are Fumarase reductase (FR)
  and Ubiquinone 9 (UQ) carrying single electron reaction in ETC in mitochondrial
  membrane contributing to the generation of superoxide anion free radicals (O2•−)
  which are usually detoxified by other membrane bound complexes (eg., cytc, etc.,
  not shown in the figure) by transporting the electron to oxygen. Superoxide anion
  free radicals contribute to form other ROS and damage various proteins, DNA and
  lipids. Similarly, leishmanial Nitric oxide synthase (NOS), in unfavorable circumstances,
  synthesizes NO• ions that further contribute to the formation of RNI (reactive nitrogen
  species). ROS and RNI also inactivate Fe-S cluster proteins (Fumarase reductase
  (FR) and Aconitase) by leaching out their iron centres. ROS and RNI also decrease
  GSH (glutathione) level thereby directly affecting the synthesis of trypanothione
  (T[SH]2) and activation of various T[SH]2 dependent proteins and enzymes. These
  reactive species also inactivates glyoxalase I (GLOI), an important rate limiting
  enzyme in a two-step methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive metabolite and a by-product
  of glycolysis, detoxification pathway. Further, inactivation of GLOI enzyme can
  also be carried out by drugs or inhibitors leading to the increased level of MGO.
  MGO, when in excess, irreversibly modifies proteins (including GLOI) by reacting
  with their Arg and Lys residues and forms advanced glycation end products (AGEs),
  (leading to the degradation of proteins), and MGO•- free radicals.
