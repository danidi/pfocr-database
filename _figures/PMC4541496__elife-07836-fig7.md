caption: 'GSC absence results in activation of transcription factors in the intestine,
  with SKN-1 being regulated in parallel to DAF-12 and DAF-16. Yolk transport to oocytes
  is disrupted by GSC loss, resulting in lipid accumulation in the intestine and body
  cavity. The resulting SKN-1 activation requires OA, the FAT-6/7 FA desaturases,
  and the lysosomal lipases LIPL-1/3. This lipid-based signaling to SKN-1 depends
  partially upon LBP-8, which transports FAs from the lysosome to the nucleus. SKN-1
  induces transcription of genes involved in stress resistance, detoxification, proteasome
  maintenance, extracellular matrix, and lipid metabolism, thereby reducing fat storage
  and increasing stress resistance and lifespan. Magenta denotes processes that are
  active in the presence of GSCs.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07836.019'
