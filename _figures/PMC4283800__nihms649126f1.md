caption: The biosynthesis of type I collagen and other fibrillar collagens can be
  divided into intracellular (parts a–c) and extracellular (parts d–f) steps. The
  first intracellular step involves the synthesis of procollagen polypeptides from
  any of 42 distinct collagen gene transcripts (part a). Procollagens are post-translationally
  modified within the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by prolyl 4-hydroxylase
  α-subunit isoform 1 (P4HA1), P4HA2 and P4HA3 and by procollagen-lysine 2-oxyglutarate
  5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1), PLOD2 and PLOD3 lysyl hydroxylase enzymes (part b). Hydrolysine
  residues can be further modified to galactosyl hydroxylysine and to glucosylgalactosyl
  hydroxylysine by collagen galactosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase, respectively.
  The carboxyl termini of three properly hydroxylated procollagen molecules will associate
  and spontaneously propagate a procollagen triple helix from the carboxyl terminus
  to the amino terminus. The triple helical procollagen will be transported from the
  ER to the extracellular space via the Golgi (part c). Two metalloproteinases, a
  procollagen N-terminal proteinase and a procollagen C-terminal proteinase, cleave
  the non-helical termini (part d) and the mature collagen proteins spontaneously
  aggregate to form a collagen fibril (part e). The final step, collagen fibre formation,
  is initiated by collagen crosslinking, which is catalysed by lysyl oxidase (LOX)
  family members and occurs via the lysine aldehyde- or hydroxylysine aldehyde-initiated
  pathway (part f). The number and the proportion of the various crosslinks are tissue
  specific and are regulated by the steric relationship between localized collagen
  molecules, the type of collagens co-polymerized and the glycosylation and the hydroxylation
  of the participating amino acid residues. For example, lysine aldehyde-initiated
  crosslinks are found in soft connective tissue, in contrast to hydroxylysine aldehyde-initiated
  crosslinks, which are found in stiff connective tissues. Many non-fibrillar collagens
  retain a non-collagenous N- or C-terminal, which prevents the spontaneous formation
  of collagen fibrils, and in these collagens cysteine crosslinks might be the only
  source of covalent intermolecular bonds. Enzymes highlighted in red are induced
  under hypoxic conditions. LOXL, LOX-like protein.
