caption: Proposed mechanism by which erythrocytes participate in the matching of oxygen
  (O2) supply with demand in skeletal muscle. When O2 demand in the tissue increases,
  oxygen is released from erythrocytes. The fall in oxygen saturation (SO2) of hemoglobin
  results in activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gi. This initiates a signal
  transduction pathway leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase, increases in 3′5′-adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP), activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and the cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and, ultimately, adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) release. The released ATP binds to purinergic receptors (PR) on the endothelium
  (Endo) which induces the production of vasodilators that relax smooth muscle (SMC)
  inducing a vasodilation which is conducted upstream. Insulin inhibits ATP release
  by binding to receptors on the erythrocyte membrane (IR) activating a phosphodiestease
  (PDE3) that enhances the breakdown of cAMP (see text for additional detail).
