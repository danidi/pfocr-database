caption: Schematic representation of the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. In
  response to external stimuli (e.g., skeletal muscle contraction or exercise), the
  nuclear genome coordinates the expression of nuclear and mitochondrial proteins.
  This pathway is triggered by the activation of signaling molecules, including AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK), and converges on the expression of the transcriptional coactivator
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), the master
  regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1α promotes its own expression as well
  as that of the nuclear respiratory factor 1 and 2 (NRF-1/2). NRF-1 and 2 bind and
  up-regulate the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins as well
  as the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which is subsequently
  transported into mitochondria. Here, TFAM binds to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and
  activates the transcription and replication of the mitochondrial genome, a crucial
  step in the generation of new organelles. TF, transcription factor.
