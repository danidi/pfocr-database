caption: (A) JMJD2A Tudor domain (in red) binds to H4K20me2 in undamaged cells and
  prevents the damage-associated formation of 53BP1 loci. Upon DNA damage, E3 ubiquitin
  ligases RNF8 and RNF168 promote JMJD2A ubiquitination and degradation at sites of
  DNA damage, which allow 53BP1 to bind to H4K20me2 and form loci at the damaged sites.(B)
  During cellular response to DNA damage, recognition of H4K20me2 by the 53BP1 Tudor
  (in red) helps to efficiently recruit 53BP1 to sites of double-strand DNA breaks
  (DSB) where 53BP1 promotes the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway.
  TIP60-mediated H4K16 acetylation inhibits 53BP1 interaction to H4K20me2, blocks
  53BP1 recruitment, and promotes BRCA1-mediated homologous repair (HR) pathway.(C)
  ‘Reading’ H3K4me3 and the N-terminus of H3 (exampled by A1R2) by the SGF29 Tudor
  (in red) is critical for recruitment of GCN5 and other SAGA complex components to
  target gene promoters where GCN5-SAGA promotes histone acetylation and gene transcription.(D)
  The nucleolar protein Spindlin1 utilizes a Tudor domain (in red) to recognize H3K4me3
  and the surrounding H3 residues (exemplified by H3R2 and H3R8), which facilitates
  its recruitment to active rDNA genes and its promotion of rRNA expression.(E) A
  multivalent engagement of the unmodified N-terminus of histone H3 (shown as A1R2T3K4),
  H3K9me3, and the hemi-methylated DNA by the linked UHRF1 PHD finger (in green),
  Tudor (in red) and SRA (in pink) motifs, respectively, helps to recruit UHRF1 and
  associated DNMT1 to heterochromatin. DNMT1 subsequently methylates the newly synthesized
  DNA and maintains a normal cellular level of DNA methylation.(F) Binding to H3K36me3
  by the PHF1 or PHF19 Tudor (in red) provides a novel mechanism for recruiting PRC2
  to a subset of actively transcribed genes, which results in optimal H3K27me3 and
  repression of gene transcription.Ac, acetylation; Me, methylation; Ph, phosphorylation;
  rDNA, ribosomal DNA; All Tudor-containing proteins are colored in light green.
