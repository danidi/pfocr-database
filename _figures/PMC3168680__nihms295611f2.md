caption: 'The yellow boxes represent the mAKAPβ signalosome. A. There is evidence
  for three conjoined negative feedback loops intrinsic to the mAKAPβ complex that
  control local cAMP levels: (1) AC5, cAMP, PKA; (2) cAMP, PKA, PDE4D3; and (3) cAMP,
  Epac1, Rap1, MEK5, ERK5, PDE4D3. βAR stimulation will activate AC5, resulting in
  cAMP production and PKA activation. PKA phosphorylation inhibits AC5 and activates
  PDE4D3 activity, resulting in decreased cAMP accumulation [, , ]. The MEK5/ERK5
  MAPK pathway is activated in myocytes by α1AR and gp130/LIF-R agonists []. Activation
  of ERK5 will lead to PDE4D3 inhibition and increased PKA activity []. When high
  cAMP levels activate the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1, Rap1 will inhibit
  the ERK5 pathway, reversing the ERK5-mediated inhibition of PDE4D3 and limiting
  downstream signaling. In addition, there is an incoherent feedforward loop that
  will oppose PKA phosphorylation of PDE4D3 resulting from PKA phosphorylation and
  activation of PP2A in the complex. An incoherent feedforward loop is present when
  two pathways lead to the same effector with opposite results []. Compare PKA-PDE4D3
  and PKA-PP2A-PDE4D3. B. Calcineurin Aβ (CaNAβ) may serve as an mAKAPβ signalosome
  effector. RyR2 bound to mAKAPβ is PKA phosphorylated when myocytes are stimulated
  by β-agonists, potentially increasing local Ca2+ levels []. Norepinephrine-treatment
  of myocytes results in CaNAβ recruitment into the complex, where it can catalyze
  the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATc transcription factors [].
  While not illustrated in this Figure, ERK5 and HIF-1α are also potential effectors
  for mAKAPβ complexes.'
