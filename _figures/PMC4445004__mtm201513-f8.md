caption: Schematic diagram depicting the proposed role of proNGF/p75NTR in mediating
  EC death and development of acellular capillaries. Overexpression of proNGF impairs
  endogenous NGF/TrkA survival signaling pathway and activates p75NTR-mediated apoptotic
  signal. ProNGF triggers interaction of intracellular domain of p75NTR (p75ICD) and
  the transcriptional factor neurotrophin interacting factor (NRIF) to activate JNK
  apoptotic signal. Targeting p75NTR prevents the apoptotic signal and stimulates
  endogenous cell survival.
