caption: Schematic showing signaling mechanism of β3 integrin-mediated Ub for NFκB
  activation and cIAP1 expression during compensatory cardiac hypertrophy. The β3
  integrin recognizes the RGD motif of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and responds
  by clustering, followed by recruitment of molecules onto the actin cytoskeleton
  to create a focal adhesion complex in order to mediate downstream intracellular
  signaling responses, including enhanced Ub. This can be recreated in vitro by overlaying
  cardiomyocytes with collagen containing an RGD peptide. During PO in vivo or RGD
  treatment in vitro, IκB undergoes phosphorylation, which is not β3 integrin-specific.
  However, when β3 integrin is activated, phosphorylated IκB is recruited to the actin-cytoskeleton
  complex (a protein complex resistant to Triton X-100 solubilization), where it is
  recognized for Ub and subsequent degradation. NFκB is then freed in the cytoplasm
  and translocates to the nucleus for transcription of cIAP1, an E3 ligase. cIAP1
  is also recruited to the cytoskeleton, and it promotes Ub and negatively regulates
  the proapoptotic caspase pathway for cell survival.
