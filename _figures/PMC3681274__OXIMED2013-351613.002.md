caption: Positive and negative regulators of the retrograde pathway. The retrograde
  pathway is constitutively inhibited by Mks1p as well as TOR1/2p/Lst8p which hyperphosphorylates
  (P) the Rtg1/3p heterodimer. Bmh1/2p stabilizes the phosphorylated Mks1p contributing
  to its activity and preventing its degradation. Mitochondrial stress activates Rtg2p
  which dephosphorylates Mks1p. Mks1p then dissociates from Bmh1/2p and is degraded
  by Grr1p. Rtg2p also inhibits the inhibitory factor Lst8p. Additionally, Lst8p is
  part of the TOR1/2p complex and is also controlled by canonical regulators of TOR.
  The disinhibition of the Rtg1/3p heterodimer allows dephosphorylation and translocation
  to the nucleus where it activates the RTG genes. The prototypical RTG gene CIT2
  encodes peroxisomal citrate synthase (CIT2) which converts Acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetic
  acid (OAA) to citrate. This contributes nitrogen to the TCA cycle in order to maintain
  an adequate supply of α-ketoglutarate. Ultimately, this leads to production of glutamate
  which is the ultimate source of biosynthetic reactions in yeast. The plasma membrane
  amino acid sensor SPS inhibits Rtg2p in a negative feedback mechanism in the presence
  of excess glutamate.
