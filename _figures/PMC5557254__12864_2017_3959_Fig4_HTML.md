caption: Summary of changes in expression levels of coral genes that are candidates
  for involvement in an algal-like pathway of DMSP synthesis. For each candidate gene,
  transcripts levels are indicated as a bar, the length of which indicates log2-fold
  change (as in the x axis) relative to control in (a) adult and (b) juvenile corals.
  Blue bars and red bars represent the expression levels of up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes, respectively. Values of candidate gene expression are in Table , and abbreviations
  are as in Fig.  and Table
