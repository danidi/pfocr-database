caption: Bile acids, after synthesis, are secreted into the bile where bile acids,
  cholesterol and phospholipids form micelles. Food intake stimulates the gallbladder
  to release bile acids into the small intestine. Conjugated bile acids are efficiently
  re-absorbed in the ileum by active transport systems in the ileum, and a small amount
  of un-conjugated bile acids is reabsorbed by passive diffusion in the small and
  large intestine. Less than 5% of the bile acids is lost through fecal excretion,
  which is compensated by de novo synthesis in the liver. At the canalicular membrane
  of the hepatocytes, the bile salt export pump (BSEP) is the primary bile acid efflux
  transporter, while the multidrug resistance-associated protein-2 (MRP-2) can also
  secrete organic substrates including bile acids, bilirubin and glutathione. ABCG5
  and ABCG8 form heterodimers and transport cholesterol into the bile, and multidrug
  resistance-2 (MDR2) is responsible for phospholipid secretion. At the basolateral
  membrane of the hepatocytes, The Na+-dependent taurocholate transporter (NTCP) is
  mainly responsible for Na+-dependent uptake of conjugated bile acids. The microsomal
  epoxide hydrolase (mEH) may also mediate Na+-dependent uptake of conjugated bile
  acids. The organic anion transporters (OATPs) show substrate specificity for unconjugated
  bile acids. At the basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes, organic solute transporters
  OSTα and OSTβ heterodimers, MRP3 and MRP4 secrete bile acids into the systemic circulation.
  In cholestasis, this pathway is induced and leads to subsequent renal bile acid
  excretion. In the intestine, the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transport (ASBT)
  mediates bile acid uptake in the ileum. Intracellular bile acids are bound to the
  intestinal bile acid binding protein (I-BABP) and are transported to the basolateral
  membrane where bile acids is secreted into the portal circulation by the OSTα and
  OSTβ heterodimer.
