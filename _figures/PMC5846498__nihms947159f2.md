caption: A. Cellular intoxication of DT-like toxins. DT-like toxins bind host membrane-bound
  receptors and enter via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Protease cleavage of the
  peptide backbone results in a single disulfide-linked chain. Upon endosomal acidification,
  the A domain of DT is translocated into the cytosol by insertion of the translocation
  domain into the endosomal membrane and reduction of the disulfide bond. Conversely,
  PE undergoes retrograde trafficking to the ER, where reduction of the disulfide
  and interactions with ER-associated chaperone proteins like PDI promote translocation
  of the A domain through a Sec61-like channel into the cytosol. Once in the cytosol,
  the A domains of DT-like toxins ADP-ribosylate EF2, inhibiting protein synthesis
  and killing the cell. Cholix can utilize LRP1 to enter cells and may follow the
  PE intoxication pathway.
