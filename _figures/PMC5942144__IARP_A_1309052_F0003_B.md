caption: Schematic model of AA release in endothelial cells. In addition to the release
  of AA from PL stores (e.g. by the action of cPLA2, iPLA2, PLC, and ATGL phospholipase),
  our data provide evidence that AA is also released from TG pools (by ATGL) and might
  be directly metabolised to prostaglandins (by the action of COX enzymes). Alternatively,
  and especially evident upon stimulation with A23187, ATGL releases AA which is reincorporated
  into the PL pool (by the Kennedy pathway or the Lands cycle, respectively). Thus
  ATGL seems to be involved in the replenishment of the PL pool with AA.
