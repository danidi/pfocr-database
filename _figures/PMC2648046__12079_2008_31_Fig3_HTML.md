caption: Schematic depicting notochordal cell interaction with nucleus pulposus cells.
  The notochordal cell secretes a pro-form of CCN2 that is likely activated within
  the cytoplasm to the active form. CCN2 acts in a paracrine fashion upon nucleus
  pulposus cells. The possible role of TGF-β within this notochordal cell/nucleus
  pulposus cell milieu is a question at the present. CCN2 is known to be a downstream
  effector molecule of TGB-β signaling-however the specific role of TGF-β within this
  pathway has not yet been tested. Notochordal cells secrete a unique form of aggrecan
  themselves (depicted as notochordal cell secreted increased proteoglycan synthesis).
  Also, soluble factors secreted by notochordal cells activate nucleus pulposus cells
  to increase their proteoglycan production (indicated as increased proteoglycan synthesis
  by nucleus pulposus cells in red)
