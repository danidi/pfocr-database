caption: Pathogens and innate immune signalling for autophagy induction in flies and
  mammals. Autophagy is induced by the infection of intracellular bacteria and some
  kind of viruses. In flies, PGN of invasive bacteria is detected by PGRPs inside
  cells, which provokes autophagy independent from Toll pathway and Imd pathway. Viral
  glycoprotein (VSV-G) causes autophagy induction via unidentified sensor. In mammals,
  NLRs detect bacterial PGN in the cytosol of infected cells to induce autophagy independent
  from RIP2, while TLRs on the cell plasma membrane also involved in the activation
  of autophagy via NF-κB signalling pathway. Sindbis virus infection causes autophagy
  in mice, although the pathogen sensors involved for the induction has yet not been
  clarified.
