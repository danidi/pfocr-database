caption: (a) In unstimulated T cells, CARD11 is kept in a closed, inactive conformation
  in the cytoplasm through intramolecular interactions between the ID and the CARD
  and Coiled-coil domains. PKCθ, GAKIN, and the depicted pathway components are cytoplasmic
  and unbound to CARD11. (b) Upon TCR engagement, PKCθ clusters at the membrane and
  phosphorylates the ID of CARD11, leading to the conversion of CARD11 to an active
  conformation that can associate with several signaling proteins including TRAF6,
  IKKγ, and Bcl10. (c) Subsequent to the activation of CARD11, GAKIN and CARD11 interact
  in a manner that can compete Bcl10 off of a fraction of CARD11 molecules and that
  results in the redistribution of CARD11 away from the synapse center to a distal
  region. GAKIN is depicted here as directly transporting CARD11 along microtubules
  in a plus-end directed fashion, but other mechanisms by which GAKIN can influence
  CARD11 localization are possible. Since intramolecular interactions within GAKIN
  can regulate the association with CARD11, GAKIN is depicted as undergoing a conformational
  change that is influenced by TCR signaling.
