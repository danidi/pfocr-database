caption: The working model of AMDE-1-induced canonical and noncanonical LC3 lipidation.
  AMDE-1 is able to induce both canonical autophagy and NCA. The ULK1 complex and
  the Beclin1–Atg14 complex are required in the canonical pathway, but not in the
  noncanonical pathway. However, the LC3 conjugation system is required in both pathways.
  While the phagophore provides the membrane platform for LC3 lipidation in canonical
  autophagy, the Golgi complex is likely the membrane platform for the noncanonical
  LC3 lipidation. Notably, the V-ATPase can have an important role in the latter by
  acting at the Golgi complex, although the exact molecular mechanism has yet to be
  determined. Thus, V-ATPase inhibitors, such as Baf, can cause LC3-II accumulation
  because of blockage of autolysosome degradation in canonical autophagy, but can
  cause LC3-II decrease because of suppression of Golgi signaling at the early stage
  in NCA. Different agents can thus affect the canonical and noncanonical pathways,
  which modulate the ultimate outcomes for cells treated with chemicals with dual
  capability, such as AMDE-1
