caption: Overview of major metabolic pathways discussed in the text. Glucose is metabolized
  in the cytosol via glycolysis, yielding pyruvate which can be converted to lactate
  (Warburg metabolic or aerobic glycolysis). Alternatively, pyruvate can be further
  oxidized in the TCA cycle. The pentose phosphate pathway is a glycolytic shunt that
  produces ribose 5-phosphate and NADPH to support nucleotide synthesis and lipid
  synthesis. Glucose and glutamine also fuel the hexoamine pathway, which produces
  UDP-GlcNAC and other amino sugars that are used for the generation of glycoproteins,
  glycolipids, and proteoglycans. Fatty acids are catabolized via β-oxidation in the
  mitochondria, yielding Ac-CoA which enters the TCA cycle. Glutamine is metabolized
  via glutaminolysis to produce α-ketoglutarate. Entry of α-ketoglutarate into the
  TCA cycle (“anaplerosis”) replenishes the cycle, which may be important in conditions
  where citrate is diverted to the cytosol for Ac-CoA production and lipogenesis.
  The TCA cycle is a major metabolic hub that produces cytosolic Ac-CoA (via citrate)
  for lipogenesis, amino acids, and other key metabolites. In addition, NADH and FADH2
  generated by TCA cycle activity fuels ATP generation by oxidative phosphorylation;
  alternatively, ATP can be produced by aerobic glycolysis (not shown).
