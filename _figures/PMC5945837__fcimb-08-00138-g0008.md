caption: Schematic representation of galactose metabolism pathway in Streptococcus
  pneumoniae D39. In S. pneumoniae, lactose, and galactose are metabolized by the
  tagatose-6-phosphate pathway (light gray box) and the Leloir pathway (left; light
  pink box). The lacA, lacB, lacC, and lacD genes are involved in the tagatose-6-phosphate
  pathway, and the galM, galK, galT-1, and galE-2 genes are involved in the Leloir
  pathway. The lacE2 gene (which encodes the PTS system, lactose-specific IIBC component)
  is required for galactose transport. The lacA, lacB, lacC, lacD, galM, and lacE-2
  genes were downregulated in the present study.
