caption: A UPR-independent role for eIF2α phosphorylation in CMT1B Schwann cells.
  In condition of ER stress, PERK phosphorylates eIF2α to attenuate general protein
  synthesis. This also leads to the selective translation of the mRNA for the transcription
  factor ATF4, which in turn activates genes involved in in the antioxidant response
  and in amino acid metabolism. ATF4 also activates CHOP and Gadd34 (also known as
  PPP1R15a), which is part of the PP1 holophosphatase complex that dephosphorylates
  eIF2α to restart protein translation. In most cell types (here epitomized by pancreatic
  β-cells), impediment of eIF2α phosphorylation and lack of ATF4 translation leads
  to a failure to properly activate the UPR pathways governed by IRE1 and ATF6, accumulation
  of misfolded protein, and increased ER stress and oxidative stress, ultimately resulting
  in apoptosis. In S63del-CMT1B Schwann cells lacking eIF2α phosphorylation, despite
  reduced translation of ATF4, the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways of the UPR remain properly
  activated, and there is no increase in ER stress or oxidative stress. Rather, through
  an as yet unidentified mechanism, lack of eIF2α phosphorylation determines a hyperactivation
  of the P-ERK/c-Jun pathway, which in turn disrupts Schwann cell development and
  myelination.
