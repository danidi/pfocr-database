caption: The NF2 gene encodes the merlin protein, which regulates the Hippo pathway.
  Loss of NF2 function leads to inactivation of the Hippo pathway, activation of the
  YAP transcriptional coactivator, ultimately promoting cell proliferation and survival.
  Defactinib is a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor created for potential action
  on the NF2 pathway, but was unsuccessful in MPM treatment.PTEN is a negative regulator
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and loss of PTEN function results in over activation of
  this pathway, leading to cell growth and proliferation.BAP1 is a tumor suppressor
  gene. Without it, the EZH2 component of the PRC2 complex is activated, leading to
  tri-methylation of Histone 3 Lysine 27 (H3K27), and ultimately malignant transformation.
  Tazemetostat is an EZH2 inhibitor.CDK2NA encodes p14ARF and p16INK4a. p14ARF interacts
  with MDM2, resulting in MDM2 degradation and ultimate activation of p53 Loss of
  p14ARF expression increases MDM2 levels, decreasing p53 function, resulting in increased
  cell survival. p16INK4a is essential in hyperphosphorylation and subsequent inhibition
  of the retinoblastoma pathway. Loss of this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor leads
  to unchecked activation of the retinoblastoma pathway and ultimately cell cycle
  progression.TP53 encodes p53, and loss of this results in loss of p53 and subsequent
  cell proliferation and survival.
