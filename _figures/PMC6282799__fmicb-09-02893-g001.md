caption: Schematic illustration of engineered H. mediterranei for lycopene production.
  (A) Enhancement of lycopene synthesis by enhancing lycopene biosynthetic pathway
  and blocking its flux to bacterioruberin and its competitive pathway for PHBV biosynthesis.
  Green arrows represent enhanced steps and red arrows and crosses represent blocked
  steps. (B) Flowchart of engineering H. mediterranei strain for increasing lycopene
  synthesis. Green terms represent gene insertion and red ones represent gene deletion.
  The blue terms show the plasmids used for constructing the mutants of H. mediterranei.
