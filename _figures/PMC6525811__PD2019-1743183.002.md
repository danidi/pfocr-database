caption: miRNAs that indirectly impact α-syn without binding to its 3′-UTR. Several
  miRNAs cause impairment of the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and autophagy-lysosome
  network (ALN) pathways, leading to α-syn accumulation. Lamp2a in the CMA pathway
  is targeted by miR-21∗, miR-224, miR-373∗, and miR-379, while Hsc70 is targeted
  by miR-26b, miR-106a∗, miR-301b, and probably miR-320a and miR-16-1. In the ALN,
  TFEB, which is necessary for lysosomal biogenesis and function, is directly targeted
  and reduced by miR-128. Let-7, on the other hand, can suppress lgg-1 and atg-13.
  Therefore, miR-128 and let-7 contribute to PD pathogenesis by impairing the ALN.
  On the other hand, SIAH1, a monoubiquitylation modifier of α-syn, is inhibited by
  miR-15b-5p, leading to decreased α-syn aggregation. Moreover, lncRNA SNHG1 could
  directly bind miR-15-5p and repress miR-15-5p expression. The roles of miR-133b
  and miR-433 are controversial. miR-133b may inhibit α-syn expression via inhibition
  of RhoA, while miR-433 may suppress α-syn expression via FGF20 inhibition.
