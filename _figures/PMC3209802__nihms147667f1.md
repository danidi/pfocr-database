caption: Schematic illustration of MDC1 domain organization and their respective roles
  in the assembly of various components in the DNA damage response pathway. i) Upon
  DNA damage, the histone variant H2AX (orange) surrounding DNA damage sites is phosphorylated
  by the ATM, DNA-PK and ATR kinases, which allows the direct engagement of MDC through
  its phospho-protein binding BRCT domain (black). ii) At damaged chromatin, the MDC1
  FHA domain (blue) recruits phosphorylated ATM (gray) molecules and allows amplification
  of ATM signaling. iii) The MDC1 tandem SDTD repeats (aqua) are phosphorylated by
  casein kinase 2, which allows accumulation of the MRN complex through its interaction
  with NBS1. iv) Phosphorylation of the tandem TQXF repeats (lime green) on MDC1 mediates
  its interaction with RNF8 through its FHA domain, which initiates the ubiquitin-dependent
  signaling pathway involving RNF8, RNF168 and UBC13.
