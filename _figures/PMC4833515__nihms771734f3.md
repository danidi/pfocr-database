caption: 'H295R WT and ORP2kd cells were cultured into 100 mm dishes treated for 48
  h with 0.4 mM Bt2cAMP media collected and the amounts of steroids quantified by
  ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as described in
  Materials and Methods. Data are displayed as a heat map of the steroid hormone biosynthetic
  pathway, with steroid metabolites in untreated cells shown in A and Bt2cAMP metabolites
  depicted in B. Fold change in metabolite secretion ORP2kd is normalized to the wild
  type and data represent the mean ± SD of two separate experiments (n=6 per experiment).
  Steroid metabolite amounts are normalized to the cellular protein concentration.
  Enzymes catalyzing each reaction are denoted adjacent to the arrows. Abbreviations
  are as follows: cholesterol, CHOL; P5, pregnenolone; 17-OHP5, 17-hydroxypregnenolone;
  DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; P4, progesterone; 17-OHP4, 17-hydroxyprogesterone;
  A4, androstenedione; T, testosterone; DCORT, deoxycorticosterone; DCRT, 11-deoxycortisol;
  E1, estrone; E2, estradiol; CORT, corticosterone; S, 11-deoxycortisol; F, cortisol;
  ALDO, aldosterone.'
