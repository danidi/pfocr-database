caption: Activation of RTKs and downstream signaling cascades. (a) Growth factors
  bind to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to induce receptor dimerization, followed
  by autophosphorylation of key tyrosine (Tyr) residues (red circles) located within
  its cytoplasmic domain. In turn, these phosphorylated Tyr residues serve as docking
  sites for associating proteins to activate a number of downstream signaling cascades.
  Two such pathways, Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT, are shown here for simplicity. Ligand-receptor
  interactions also trigger the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) complexes,
  followed by subsequent production of H2O2 through spontaneous dismutation or action
  of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Once formed, endogenous H2O2 may pass through specific
  aquaporin (AQP) channels and/or diffuse across the membrane to reach the intracellular
  cytosol. Transient increases in H2O2 lead to the oxidation of localized redox targets.
  (b) Unlike other RTKs, insulin receptor kinase (IRK) exists as a heterotetrameric
  receptor composed of two extracellular α subunits and two transmembrane β subunits.
  Binding of insulin to IRK α subunits induces a conformational change in its quaternary
  structure to enable ATP binding, receptor autophosphorylation, and production of
  Nox-derived H2O2. Once activated, IRK recruits members of the insulin receptor substrate
  (IRS) protein family to initiate glucose metabolism through the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  Insulin signaling also has mitogenic effects that are mediated through Ras/ERK.
