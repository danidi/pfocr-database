caption: Genes from the first three categories of SFARI Gene database (“high confidence”,
  “strong candidate”, and “suggestive evidence”) interacting with three core elements
  (FMRP, mTOR, vitamin D) directly (179 genes) and due to secondary effects (43 genes).
  All secondarily affected genes are painted pink. The right legend shows the color
  of the node description. The left legend shows the interaction type colors between
  43 secondary genes and genes from the original list.
