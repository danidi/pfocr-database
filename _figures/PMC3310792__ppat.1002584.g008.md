caption: The lipidomic analyses of dengue virus infected C6/36 mosquito cells suggest
  several metabolic pathways that may be significantly up regulated during infection.
  The grey dashed line highlights specific pathways of interest. Black arrows highlight
  reactions suggested by the lipidomic data and grey arrows represent reactions not
  observed in the data. Metabolites highlighted in boxes (solid line) are up regulated
  (white) or down regulated (grey) in DENV infected mosquito cells. 1. Through the
  recruitment and activation of FAS, DENV stimulates de novo phospholipid biosynthesis
  in the replication complex . 2. Inhibition of this process with C75 disrupts the
  cellular lipid repertoire in mosquito cells to be unfavorable for virus replication.
  3. The lipidomic analyses reveal an up regulation of fatty acids such as palmitic
  (C16) and stearic (C18) acid. These fatty acids are intermediates in the biosynthesis
  of phospholipids, which is up regulated during DENV infection. Interestingly, in
  DENV infected cells the prevalent phospholipids primarily consist of C16 and C18
  unsaturated acyl chains. Very long chain fatty acids are not significantly up regulated
  during infection. 4. FAS activity also stimulates de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis.
  In the lipidomic analyses, the up regulation of intermediates such as N-palmitoylesphingosine
  suggests sphingolipid biosynthesis is activated during DENV infection. Specifically,
  SM and CER are enriched in DENV infected cells. Alternately, the up regulation in
  CER (and DG) during infection could result from the degradation of SM through the
  activity of sphingomyelinases (Smase). The resulting CER and DG could be redirected
  into several signaling pathways or be utilized for de novo phospholipid biosynthesis.
  The glycopshingolipids, GlcCER and GalCER are down regulated during DENV infection,
  which suggest that they are catabolized to produce CER. 5. Lipidomic analyses also
  suggest the up regulation of triacylglycerol catabolism (Lipolysis) in DENV infected
  cells. This pathway results in the generation of MG, DG and palmitic acid. These
  intermediates are all up regulated in DENV infected cells and could be utilized
  for downstream signaling or de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. It has also been
  shown that TG catabolism is necessary for mitochondrial β-oxidation during DENV
  infection . 6. Elevated levels of LPC in DENV infected cells also suggest activation
  of PC hydrolysis by PLA2. This enzyme is activated during DENV infection. The elevated
  levels of other phospholipids such as PA, PI, PE, PG as well as PC suggest that
  the CDG-DG pathway for phospholipid biosynthesis could also be activated. FAS, fatty
