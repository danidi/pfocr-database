caption: Steroid hormone synthesis pathways in the adrenal gland and testis. A. Steroid
  synthesis in the adrenal gland occurs in three zones, each with a specific complement
  of enzymes. The zona glomerulosa contains the enzymes necessary to produce aldosterone.
  The zona fasciculata and reticularis additionally express CYP17A. The hydroxylase
  activity of CYP17A is active in the zona fasiculata resulting in the production
  of cortiso. Due to tissue-specific expression of the cytochrome b5 coregulator,
  the lyase activity of CYP17A is only present in the zona reticularis and drives
  efficient production of DHEA which is then sulfated to DHEA-S. 17α-OH progesterone
  is a poor substrate for CYP17A lyase (dotted arrow) and thus androstenedione is
  formed at lower levels. The zona fasciculate and zona reticularis are sensitive
  to the ACTH feedback stimulation that occurs when cortisol production is suppressed
  by inhibition of CYP17A. Agents specifically targeting the lyase but not hydroxylase
  activity of CYP17A would not inhibit cortisol synthesis and are anticipated to induce
  less ACTH feedback stimulation; B. Testicular androgen synthesis follows a similar
  pathway to DHEA formation as that in the zona reticularis. Due to the absence of
  SULT2A1, and the presence of HSD3B2 and HSD17B3, DHEA is efficiently converted to
  testosterone.
