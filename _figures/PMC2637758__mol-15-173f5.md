  software was used to map the above three identified proteins onto characterized
  human pathways and networks that are associated with these proteins based on known
  protein-to-protein interactions, mRNA expression studies, and other biochemical
  interactions previously described. Proteins belonging to different structural and
  functional families had PHB as a common target and were involved in processes such
  as mitogenesis, defense response, germination, inflammation, proliferation, and
  apoptosis. Most of the diseases associated with these three proteins were cancer
  derived from various organs.
