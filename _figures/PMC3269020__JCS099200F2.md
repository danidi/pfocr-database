caption: 'Role of miRNAs in C. elegans aging. (A) lin-4 and lin-14 regulate lifespan
  in C. elegans. lin-4 loss-of-function mutants display shortened lifespans and various
  accelerated aging phenotypes, whereas lin-14 loss-of-function mutants exhibit extended
  longevity [not drawn to scale; see Boehm and Slack for lifespan curves ()]. lin-4
  and LIN-14 are thought to function in the same pathway as DAF-2 and DAF-16, as illustrated
  in the lower part of this panel. Therefore, LIN-14 function during aging might result
  in direct repression of DAF-16 or indirect repression of DAF-16 through DAF-2 activation,
  which would in either case prevent DAF-16 from activating longevity genes. (B) miR-71,
  238, 239, and 246 regulate lifespan in C. elegans. mir-71 mutants (as well as mir-238
  and mir-246 mutants) have a shorter lifespan than wild-type animals, whereas mir-239
  mutants have a longer lifespan [not drawn to scale; see de Lencastre et al for lifespan
  curves ()]. Shorter-lived C. elegans also display hallmarks of accelerated aging,
  such as increased stress sensitivity; the opposite holds true for longer-lived animals.
  The targets for some of these miRNAs have been established, as illustrated in the
  lower part of this panel: miR-71 targets AGE-1 and PDK-1 in the IIS pathway, as
  well as CDC-25.1 and CDK-1, which are involved in cell cycle checkpoints for DNA
  damage. Additionally, miR-239 activates AGE-1 and PDK-1 through unknown mechanisms
  (represented with question marks on the diagram).'
