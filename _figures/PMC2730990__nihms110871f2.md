caption: Following breach of the epithelial barrier of the airways by environmental
  allergens, particularly in genetically susceptible hosts, APC process the allergen
  and upon presentation to T cells initiate an immune response. Activation of Th2
  cells represents the classic allergic pathway, but newly appreciated roles for Th17,
  Treg and likely Th9 populations confound dissection of the complex immunopathogenic
  events. Th2-derived cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13 influence eosinophil recruitment,
  mast cell activation, airway smooth muscle cell contraction and proliferation, goblet
  cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion, monocyte/macrophage CD23 and class II
  MHC expression, and fibroblast matrix production. IL-5 coordinates eosinophil differentiation
  from progenitors. TGF-β, which orchestrates suppression of Th1 and Th2, in large
  part via Treg (TGF-β and IL-10) may exacerbate the response via Th17 commitment
  and generation of IL-17, which not only recruits and activates granulocytes, but
  also stimulates epithelial cells to release chemokines (CXCL1/CXCL6/CXCL8/CCL11eotaxin),
  inflammatory mediators (TNFα, IL-lβ, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF), as well as mucins. Th2
  activation of B cell IgE triggers FcεRI on mast cells and basophils that release
  large amounts of inflammatory mediators including histamine, proteases, cytokines
  and lipid mediators. Putative Th9 secretion of IL-9 together with eosinophil-derived
  IL-9 dictates IgE, mucus secretion and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In this milieu,
  there may be inadequate incentive for recruitment and/or induction of Treg and failed
  suppression of the host response evoking tissue damage, aberrant repair, airway
  constriction, obstruction, and remodeling which can eventuate in compromised function.
