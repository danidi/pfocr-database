caption: Schematics of the TORC1/TORC2, PI3K, and TSC1/TSC2 signaling pathways and
  portions of plant and yeast cell walls (CWs). (A) In conjunction with LST8 and other
  proteins, the TORC1/TORC2 pathway stimulates protein translation and transcription,
  ribosome biogenesis, messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, and actin polarization and
  organization. Both TORC1 and TORC2 are inhibited by the TSC1/TSC2 pathway that is,
  in turn, inhibited if growth factors trigger the PI3K pathway. (B) A portion of
  the plant plasma membrane (PM) showing two cellulose synthase terminal complexes
  (TCs) and three cellulose microfibrils (CMs). The TCs leave the CMs behind on the
  external surface of the PM as they are driven by microtubules. (C) A portion of
  the yeast PM and CW associated with the yeast cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling
  pathway that transmits mechanical stresses (in the CW and PM) through a family of
  Wsc1–Wsc3 and Mid1–Mid2 protein sensors to the Rho1 protein, which integrates signals
  from the PM membrane to govern β-glucan synthesis, actin organization, and polarized
  secretion.
