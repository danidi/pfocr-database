caption: 'Epithelial and Epidermal barrier dysfunction: Various molecules involved
  in the signaling pathways shown in figure are maintaining the epithelial and epidermal
  barrier. Defects in the molecules indicated through red circles has a potential
  to disrupt these pathways and cause dysfunction. a. Signaling through GUCY2C activates
  PTEN which inhibits AKT and thereby, inhibits tight Junction expression. It also
  promotes proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and helps in continuation of cell
  cycle. b. Toll-Like Receptors, on receiving signals, activate NEMO through Reactive
  Oxygen Species (ROS). NEMO along with IKK-alpha and IKK-beta activates Inhibitory
  kappa B (IκB) and initiates its ubiqutination to release NFκB. c. TTC7A helps in
  protein trafficking. Here, it takes PI4K from trans-golgi network near cell membrane
  so that PI4K can activate PI and helps in accumulation of PI-4P, which is further
  involved in maintaining cell polarity and cell survival. d. ADAM-17 cleaves the
  membrane bound EGFR/TGFR ligands. This helps in receptor-ligand binding and initiation
  of signaling of EGFR/TGFR mediated pathway. e. COL7A1 helps hemi-desmosomes to keep
  the cell bound to the basement membrane. f. Kindler 1 protein increases the integrin
  and integrin-ligand binding.'
