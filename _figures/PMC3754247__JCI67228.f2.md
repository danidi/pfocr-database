caption: SDH and FH are Krebs cycle enzymes and tumor suppressors. Loss-of-function
  mutations in SDH and FH result in abnormal accumulation of Krebs cycle metabolites
  succinate (Succ) and fumarate (Fum), respectively, both of which can inhibit the
  activities of α-KG–dependent oxygenases. Inhibition of HIF PHDs leads to activation
  of HIF-mediated pseudohypoxic response, whereas inhibition of KDMs and TET family
  of 5mC hydroxylases causes epigenetic alterations. Fumarate is electrophilic and
  can also irreversibly modify cysteine residues in proteins by succination. Succination
  of KEAP1 in FH deficiency results in the constitutive activation of the antioxidant
  defense pathway mediated by NRF2, conferring a reductive milieu that promotes cell
  proliferation. Succination of the Krebs cycle enzyme Aco2 impairs aconitase activity
  in Fh1-deficient MEFs. Fumarate accumulation may also affect cytosolic pathways
  by inhibiting the reactions involved in the biosynthesis of arginine and purine.
  AcCoA, acetyl CoA; Mal, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate; Succ-CA, succinyl CoA.
