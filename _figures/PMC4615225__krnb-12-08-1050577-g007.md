caption: Overview of regulatory networks in which miRNA/target pairs function during
  the rice response to fungal elicitors. Small RNA and degradome sequencing data were
  used to establish regulations in the indicated pathways. All target genes were supported
  by degradome sequencing. miRNAs targeting these genes are boxed. Except for EDF1,
  all the indicated target genes are classified in categories 0, 1 or 2 in the degradome
  analysis. (A) Small RNA biogenesis and functioning. AGO, ARGONAUTE; DCL, DICER-like;
  RDR, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; SGS3, Suppressor of gene silencing. (B) Ethylene
  signaling pathway and crosstalk with salcylic-acid and jasmonic-acid signaling pathways,
  and polyamine biosynthesis. EDF1, ethylene response DNA binding factor 1; EREBP,
  ethylene-responsive element binding protein; ERF, ethylene responsive factor; ETR,
  ethylene receptor; JMT, jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase; Me-JA, methyl-jasmonic
  acid; Me-SA, methyl-salicylic acid; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAMT, salicylic acid
  carboxyl methyltransferase. (C) Auxin signaling pathway. ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate;
  ACO, ACC oxidase; ARF, auxin response factor; TIR1, TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE
  1.
