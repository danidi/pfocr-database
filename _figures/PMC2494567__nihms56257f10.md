caption: A schematic representation of the distinct roles of Get1 in eyelid development.
  Get1 plays an early role in formation and migration of the leading edge keratinocyte
  sheet (left panel), and a later role in the formation of the epidermal barrier after
  eyelid closure (right panel). During leading edge formation, Get1 activates F-actin
  polymerization through the TGFα/EGFR/ERK signaling pathway. F-actin fibers further
  regulate cell shape change and filopodia formation to promote keratinocyte migration
  and eyelid closure. Get1 promotes skin barrier formation by directly or indirectly
  regulating genes encoding structural proteins and crosslinking enzymes, adhesion
  molecules, and lipid metabolizing enzymes (; ). SC, cornified layer; SG, granular
  layer; SB, basal layer; Conj, Conjunctiva.
