caption: 'A proposed model for the TOR pathway and JH in regulating Vg synthesis responding
  to AAs stimulation. After feeding with normal diet, free AAs concentrations in the
  hemolymph are increased, the expression levels of the TOR pathway genes are elevated
  and S6K phosphorylation in the fat body is up-regulated. The activated TOR pathway
  works through some brain factors, like allatotropin, to induce JH biosynthesis in
  the corpora allata, and JH, in turn, activates expression of Vg gene in the fat
  body. Thus, the TOR pathway induces JH biosynthesis that, in turn, regulates AA-mediated
  vitellogenesis. JHAMT: juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase.'
