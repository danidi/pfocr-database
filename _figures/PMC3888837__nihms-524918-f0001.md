caption: This figure illustrates the sphingolipid metabolic pathway described in the
  text along with the structure of each product. It emphasizes the opposing roles
  played by two major bioactive products of sphingolipid metabolism, ceramide and
  sphingosine-1-phosphate. While ceramide is known to play a role in cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis, S1P is known to be involved in promoting cell proliferation, inflammation,
  migration, and invasion. Glu (Glucose), Gal (Galactose), GCS (Glucosylceramide Synthase),
  GBA (Glucocerebrosidase), CK (ceramide kinase), SMS (sphingomyelin synthase), SMase
  (sphingomyelinase), CDase (Ceramidase), CerS (Ceramide Synthase), SK (sphingosine
  kinase), S1PPase (S1P Phosphatase).
