caption: Mode of BMP signaling determines Smad dependent and independent pathways.
  In the BMP-mediated signaling complex, BMP dimers bind to type I BMPR dimers and
  recruit type II BMPR dimers to the complex resulting in caveolae-mediated internalization
  and activation of the non-canonical (Smad independent) pathways including PI3K/Akt,
  p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2. While the non-canonical pathways are not as well characterized
  as the canonical (Smad dependent pathways), BMP stimulation has been found to upregulate
  both Ras and TAK-1 phosphorylation, the upstream MAPKKKs for the ERK pathway and
  JNK pathways, respectively.[] In addition, recent work in our laboratory has demonstrated
  an interdependence of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activation in hMSCs undergoing osteogenic
  differentiation on collagen glycosaminoglycan scaffolds (JCL, unpublished data).
  When type I and type II receptors are assembled in a preformed tetrameric complex,
  Smad dependent canonical pathway is activated via a clathrin-mediated internalization
  of the receptor complex. Phosphorylated receptor Smads (Smad1/5/8) associate with
  co-Smad (Smad 4) and translocate to the nucleus to activate Runx2 and other Smad-dependent
  genes. Crosstalk between the canonical and non-canonical pathways exist at multiple
  levels. Both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation has been reported to target
  Smads for ubiquitination by Smurf1 and proteasomal degradation. Despite the apparent
  inverse relationship between BMPR-mediated Smad and ERK signaling, both have been
  reported to contribute to osteogenic differentiation. Adapted with permission.[]
