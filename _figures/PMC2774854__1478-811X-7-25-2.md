caption: 'Inhibition of the calcineurin-NFATc pathway at multiple levels. Upon receptor
  induced Ca2+ entry into the cell, calmodulin (CaM) and calcineurin B (CaNB) bind
  Ca2+ ions and activate calcineurin by inducing a conformational switch of the subunit
  A (CaNA). Activated calcineurin binds NFATc via the PxIxIT and the LxVP motifs of
  NFATc and subsequently dephosphorylates the transcription factor. Dephosphorylated
  NFATc exposes its nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and is therefore shuttled
  into the nucleus, where it binds to the appropriate DNA sequences. NFATc exerts
  its transactivation effects often in combination with another transcription factor
  (TF). NFATc is deactivated by rephosphorylation and subsequent translocation into
  the cytosol. Different steps in this pathway are targeted by certain compounds to
  finally suppress NFATc-dependent gene expression. A selection of the most important
  and best characterized inhibitors of calcineurin-NFATc signalling is shown (in red)
  at their point of interference. AID: autoinhibitory domain of calcineurin A; TCR:
  T cell receptor.'
