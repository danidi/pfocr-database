caption: Activation of Breg cells. Numerous mechanisms have been demonstrated to induce
  Breg cells, the most important of which are summarized as the inflammatory micro-environment
  and intercellular interactions. The inflammatory microenvironment is mainly produced
  by inflammatory factors, such as IL-35, IL-21, and other inflammatory cytokines.
  Cytokines often mediate activation of downstream signaling pathways by binding to
  cytokine receptors on the membrane. Microorganisms infection is another essential
  part of the inflammatory environment in the body, including invasive bacteria and
  commensal microbiota. Most microbial infections are activated by downstream molecular
  pathways mediated by membrane surface molecules, causing IL-10 transcription and
  translation and secretion. Intercellular interactions play a vital role in the induction
  of regulatory B cells, such as apoptotic cells or type3 innate lymphoid cells. Intercellular
  interactions mainly depend on the interaction of molecules on the surface of the
  membrane and the most classic surface molecules are Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
  CD40, B cell receptor (BCR). Many environmental and pharmaceutical factors can activate
  TLRs and cause downstream pathways activation, such as STATs and ERK orMyD88-NF-κB
  signaling pathway. CD40 can be activated by the CD40 ligand or binding immunoglobulin
  protein to mediate the activation of downstream signaling pathways STATs, and the
  downstream signaling pathways can be enhanced through synergy with other cell membrane
  surface molecules. BCR is thought to be involved in multiple functional processes
  of B cells, especially the induction of Breg cells. BCR combined with antigen can
  promote the release of calcium ions into the cell from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and also promote the activation of STIM on the endoplasmic reticulum, which
  open the calcium ion channels (SOC channel) on the cell membrane. A large amount
  of calcium influx increases the intracellular calcium ion concentration and promotes
  the phosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in the downstream
  pathway, thereby increasing the transcription and translation secretion of IL-10.
  Other membrane surface molecules can promote Breg cell differentiation, such as
  Galectin-1and CD38. Research on regulatory B cell-specific transcription factors
  is still inconclusive, but the transcription factors such as Blimp1, IRF4, andHIF-1α
  have been shown to promote the transcription of IL-10.
