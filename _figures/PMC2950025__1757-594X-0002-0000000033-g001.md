caption: (a) A balance between Cdk1 and Cdc14 activities governs mitotic exit in budding
  yeast. Early in mitosis, Cdk1 activity is at its peak while Cdc14 activity is very
  low. As cells progress through anaphase, Cdk1 activity drops and Cdc14 activity
  rises to trigger mitotic exit. This transition is reversible - despite mitotic cyclin
  degradation - until Sic1 protein accumulates beyond a threshold level [discussed
  in (b)]. (b) The circuitry controlling an irreversible switch. Early in mitosis,
  phosphorylation by Cdk1-Clb leads to downregulation of the Cdh1-activated form of
  the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), the transcription factor Swi5, and the cyclin-dependent
  kinase (CDK) inhibitor Sic1. As cells enter anaphase, Cdk1 phosphorylates Net1,
  triggering an initial, partial release of Cdc14 by the Cdc14 early anaphase release
  (FEAR) pathway (which also requires APC function). Concomitantly, the Cdc20-bound
  form of the APC (which is positively regulated by CDK activity) ubiquitylates mitotic
  cyclins to target them for degradation. Later in anaphase, the remaining Cdc14 is
  released due to activation of the mitotic exit network (MEN) pathway, allowing for
  more extensive dephosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins. Unphosphorylated Swi5
  can trigger transcription and accumulation of Sic1, which is now able to evade phosphorylation-directed
  ubiquitinylation and degradation, leading to further Cdk1 inhibition. Activation
  of APC-Cdh1 leads to further destruction of mitotic cyclins as cells complete exit
  from mitosis. It is through this system of feedback loops that irreversibility of
  mitotic exit is ensured.
