caption: Crosstalk among mediators of liver injury. In the absence of Wnt ligands,
  the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway is mostly inactive. During cell regenerative
  processes and in certain pathological conditions, the Wnt/β-catenin signal is activated.
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling controls several processes such as cell growth, differentiation
  and polarisation. Chemokines released by Kupffer cells during liver injury recruit
  several cell types such as leukocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and endothelial
  cells to the site of injury. These cells regulate the extracellular VEGF-mediated
  processing of vascular permeability and angiogenesis and, through the differentiation
  of HSCs to myofibroblasts, promote fibrosis. Kupffer cells become activated when
  they phagocytise blood-borne pathogens transported by the portal circulation. Current
  evidence suggests that these cells are the principal effectors of fibrogenic PDGF-
  and TGF-β-mediated signalling, which activate HSCs and regulate extracellular matrix
  accumulation. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth
  factor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta.
