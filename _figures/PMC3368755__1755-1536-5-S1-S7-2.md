caption: Schematic diagram showing the putative TGF-β signaling pathways involved
  in EndoMT. The diagram shows the numerous putative pathways that may participate
  in the EndoMT process and may be involved in the pathogenesis of human fibrotic
  disorders. One central pathway initiated following ligand-binding activation of
  the Smad-independent TGF-β pathway causes phosphorylation of GSK-3β mediated by
  PKC-δ and the cAbl non-receptor kinase. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at serine 9 (ser9)
  causes its inhibition which then allows Snail1 to enter the nucleus. Nuclear accumulation
  of Snail1 results in marked stimulation of Snail1 expression which then leads to
  acquisition of the myofibroblast phenotype with stimulation of α-SMA. The inhibition
  of GSK-3β ser9 phosphorylation by specific inhibition of PKC-δ or c-Abl activity
  allows GSK-3β to phosphorylate Snail1 targeting it for proteosomal degradation and
  thus, effectively abolishes the acquisition of the myofibroblastic phenotype and
  the fibrotic response. Other pathways such as the ET-1, Wnt, hypoxia and cellular
  stress pathways may also participate although the molecular events have not been
  fully elucidated. Modified from Li and Jimenez [].
