caption: (A) Inflammatory pathway centered upon TNF in the process of NASH-HCC development.
  First, high-fat diet sustains endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Second, ER stress
  promotes the enhancement of lipogenesis and hepatic steatosis. Third, ER stress
  and steatosis increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to cause oxidative
  stress and the subsequent genomic instability. Fourth, ER and oxidative stress stimulate
  release of inflammatory mediators. Fifth, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) produced by
  macrophages stimulate hepatocyte proliferation and expand HCC progenitors. TNF further
  reinforces the inflammatory microenvironment and induces expression of related chemokines
  and growth factors/cytokines. (B) The effects of dysbiosis on liver fibrosis and
  carcinogenesis through the microbiota-liver axis. Several gut-derived factors, including
  gut bacteria, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), etc, have a strong
  impact on hepatic diseases via the portal vein. The intestinal permeability is also
  significantly enhanced, and aberrant overgrowth of intestinal bacteria has been
  found in most patients with NAFLD and NASH. In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  in portal blood supports the augmentation of TNF-α production in Kupffer cells,
  through an enhanced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signal. LPS-enhanced sensitivity
  to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) results in progression toward liver fibrosis
  and promotion of tumorigenesis in the liver. Augmented deoxycholic acid (DCA) has
  been shown to cause hepatic stellate cells' senescence, thereby facilitating hepatocarcinogenesis
  via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factor. (C) Individual
  pathways of STAT-1-dependent NASH and STAT-3-dependent HCC from fatty liver. Activation
  of protumorigenic signaling pathways is stimulated in HCC. Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) signaling is key in driving the transformation
  of tumor progenitors and progression to HCC. The dissociation between NASH and HCC
  in obesity depends upon different STAT signaling pathways. Stimulated STAT-1 leads
  to cytotoxic T cell activation in NASH but not in HCC; in contrast, STAT-3 is responsible
  for T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) inactivation that promotes HCC in
  obesity, independent of T cell recruitment.
