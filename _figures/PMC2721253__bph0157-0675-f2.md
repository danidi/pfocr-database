caption: 'Modes of neurite growth inhibition of molecules expressed on CNS myelin
  and oligodendrocytes. RGM A has two modes of inducing growth inhibition: a trans-mode,
  with RGM A on myelin/oligodendrocytes binding to neuronal Neogenin and downstream
  activation of the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway. LMO4 is a transcriptional co-regulator,
  present in neurites and growth cones, stimulating the Rho pathway via an unknown
  mechanism. In the cis mode, RGM A expressed on neurites interacts with BMP-2/BMP-4.
  This complex then stimulates LIM-Kinase via activation of BMP-receptors I and II,
  leading to axonal growth inhibition (Figure 2 is a courtesy of Dr T. Yamashita,
  University of Osaka, Japan).'
