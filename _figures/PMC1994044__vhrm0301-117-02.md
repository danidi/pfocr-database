caption: 'PDGF-mediated signaling pathways for proteoglycan synthesis have classic
  and novel components. The PDGF stimulated signaling pathway for proteoglycan core
  protein expression is of the classic type as associated with proliferation and is
  sensitive to the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. GAG elongation
  is not sensitive to genistein and the effect of genistein on the PDGF effect to
  increase the 6:4 sulfation ratio is unknown. The implication is that GAG elongation
  may be mediated by a completely novel PDGF signaling pathway which would provide
  an opportunity for the development of a specific therapeutic agent targeting GAG
  elongation but not other PDGF responses.Abbreviations: GAG: glycosaminoglycan; PDGF:
  platelet-derived growth factor.'
