caption: Immunopathology of Trichomoniasis (TV). T. vaginalis through unknown ligand
  lead to immune response generation by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs including
  TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9) via p38 MAPK signaling pathway, consequently leading to IL-8
  and TNF-α release from vaginal epithelium. Independent of this, Galectin-1 and Galectin-3
  expressed by vaginal epithelial cells recognize T. vaginalis LPG, wherein Galectin-3
  accounts for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and MIP-3α) release. The pro-inflammatory
  cytokines promote recruitment and migration of immune cells, with predominant accumulation
  of neutrophils. The neutrophils achieve T. vaginalis killing either by phagocytosis
  or by novel mechanism i.e. taking T. vaginalis “bites” prior to parasite death,
  using trogocytosis. T. vaginalis also leads to the activation of complement system,
  encouraging killing through neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis. Phagocytosis involves
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that further regulates all stages of inflammation.
  The phagocytised pathogenic components activate NLRP3 inflammasome, which further
  link innate with adaptive immunity, promoting adaptive CD4+ T cells response. The
  different subsets of Th cells trigger cytokines that collectively lead to the activation
  and migration of effectors cells promoting extreme vaginal inflammation, along with
  differentiation of B cells into T. vaginalis-specific antibody producing plasma
  B cells.
