caption: ASD mutation-induced redox-sensitive protein signatures compromise core synaptic
  functions in autism. (A) The ribosome recruits mRNAs, encoding proteins for specific
  pathways (black, green, blue mRNAs). Subsets of mRNAs are under the control of the
  translational regulator RPL10 (orange), which itself is controlled by upstream regulators
  (grey). This forms a protein signature characteristic for example for mRNA and protein
  metabolism (black), redox-metabolism (green) and energy metabolism (blue). (B) In
  the presence of (mis)functional RPL10 variants (for example, RPL10[H213Q]) or other
  ASD variants (red crosses) regulating RPL10 the protein signatures are selectively
  shifted (red rectangles) resulting in alterations (change in number of the framed
  protein spots) of pathway-specific redox-sensitive proteins as observed here. The
  altered protein signature thus indicates a response to oxidative stress elicited
  by the ASD mutation(s). (C) In peripheral tissues, for example, a lymphoblast, deficiencies
  in RPL10 or upstream regulators thereof alter the redox-sensitive signature in a
  way which in the presence of moderate ROS (reactive oxygen species) production (small
  red bolt) is still able to balance cellular stress response. In particular, altered
  expression of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH (blue) may be employed for redox buffering
  by rerouting glycolysis into the PPP (pentose phosphate pathway). This will increase
  reductive power to balance oxidative power caused by ROS. (D) Under conditions of
  high oxygen metabolism (large red bolt) as present in neural cells, redox buffering
  will still support basal synaptic functions, but may no longer be able to prevent
  oxidative damage of lipids and proteins required for cellular fine-tuning (undulations)
  of synaptic functions and plasticity (purple, double headed arrow). We hypothesize
  that the effect of different ASD-mutation induced protein signatures would drive
  individual autistic phenotypes with differential failure to secure correct executing
  of synaptic plasticity. Question marks indicate unknown individual steps. ASD, autism
  spectrum disorders.
