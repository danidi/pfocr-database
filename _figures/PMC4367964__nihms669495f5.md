caption: We developed a model of the cholera-related immune pathways under selection
  in the BEB population by mapping all interactions cataloged by Ingenuity’s IPA software
  between strongly selected genes, including IKBKG, and genes shown to respond to
  cholera toxin (see methods). Upon exposure to V. cholerae, toll-like receptor 4
  (TLR4) and GM1 ganglioside interact with V. cholerae LPS and CT, resulting in coordinated
  activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the NF-κB regulatory complex, through multimerization
  of PYCARD and assembly of the NEMO complex, respectively. NEMO is encoded by IKBKG
  (red dashed box), the central gene in a gene set that is significantly enriched
  for selection in the BEB. TLR4 stimulates production of interferon β (IFNβ), which
  cleaves procaspase-4 into mature caspase-4. The NLRP3/PYCARD complex cleaves pro-caspase-1
  into mature caspase-1. Caspase-1 and caspase-4, central mediators of the inflammasome
  pathway, then facilitate cell death and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
  as HMGB1, IL-18, and IL-1β. Genes in selected regions (red boxes), including three
  specifically associated with cholera susceptibility (red shaded boxes) interact
  with regulatory components of the proposed pathway. Genes that are significantly
  upregulated during acute cholera are denoted with red arrows. Interactions shown
  as arrows or dashed lines; those found using Ingenuity Knowledge Base are labeled
  with references in parentheses(, –).
