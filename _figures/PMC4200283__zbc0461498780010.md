caption: A proposed signal transduction pathway and feedback control for iron-inducible
  nuclear influx of Myb3. In cells at the resting state (iron depletion), a trimeric
  G protein composed of Gα and Gβ/γ resides close to an adenylyl cyclase (AC) on the
  inner side of the plasma membrane (PM). The PKA holoenzyme comprising two catalytic
  (TvPKAc) and two regulatory (TvPKAr) subunits and another protein complex comprising
  Myb3, TvHsp70-1, and presumably other accessory proteins reside in the cytoplasm
  (C). Right after iron repletion (stimulation state), the upstream signal is relayed
  to the G protein. The Gα and Gβ/γ are separated and dislodged into the cytoplasm.
  The activated Gα migrates to a nearby AC to start biosynthesis of cAMP, which diffuses
  into the cytoplasm and binds to TvPKAr, resulting in the release and autophosphorylation
  of TvPKAc. The activated TvPKAc forms a new complex with Myb3 and phosphorylates
  Myb3 at Thr156, which facilitates subsequent ubiquitination at Lys143, presumably
  by an E3 ligase. The modified Myb3 is immediately transported across the nuclear
  membrane (NM) into the nucleus (N). The level of cAMP is probably regulated by feedback
  control in the desensitization state, in which TvPKAc presumably phosphorylates
  and activates a phosphodiesterase to hydrolyze cAMP. When cAMP is depleted, TvPKAc
  is dissociated from the Myb3 protein complex and binds to TvPKAr to form inactive
  holoenzyme. Active nuclear influx of Myb3 is then terminated.
