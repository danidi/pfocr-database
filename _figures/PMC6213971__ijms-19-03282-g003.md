caption: Regulation of PTPIP51 in melanoma. The left panel depicts the regulations
  of PTPIP51 in normal nevi. The phosphorylation level of the Tyr176 residue is low
  due to the high interaction with PTP1B. The phosphorylation of the Ser46 residue
  of PTPIP51 via PKA and the low phosphorylation level of the Tyr176 residue induce
  the formation of the PTPIP51/14-3-3β (not depicted)/BRAF complex and thereby a stimulation
  of the MAPK pathway. In the progression of the dysregulation of signaling as represented
  by the dysplastic nevi, the phosphorylation of PTPIP51 at Tyr176 is upregulated
  and thus inhibits the MAPK pathway stimulation of PTPIP51. This potentially mirrors
  a counter-regulation against the dysregulated growth and proliferation signaling
  in dysplastic nevi (middle panel). In melanoma cells the regulation of the phosphorylation
  and the interactions of PTPIP51 lie in between the normal nevi and the dysplastic
  nevi. This depicts the complete dysregulation of signaling since the counter-regulation
  of MAPK pathway via PTPIP51 phosphorylation is also deregulated (black arrows indicate
  a phosphorylation/interaction) (A); regulation of PTPIP51 interactions in acute
  myeloid leukemia. Activating mutations of the FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)
  receptor induce an activation of the Src family kinase Lyn. Lyn phosphorylates the
  Tyr158 and the Tyr176 residue of PTPIP51, which inhibit the formation of the Raf-1/14-3-3β/PTPIP51
  complex and thus the MAPK pathway stimulation of PTPIP51. In acute myeloid leukemia
  blasts the N-terminus of PTPIP51 is missing. Therefore, the PTPIP51 protein does
  not contain the TMD. Due to the loss of the TMD a translocation to the mitochondrion
  is not possible and the apoptosis-inducing function of PTPIP51 is omitted (black
  arrows indicate a phosphorylation/activation, arrows with vertical bar as arrow
  head indicate an inhibition of interaction/activation) (B).
