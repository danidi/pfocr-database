caption: A proposed overview of AMPK-dependent regulation of post-MI scar formation
  in the aged heart. AICAR treatment in the aged heart activates AMPK. AMPK phosphorylation
  increases TGF-β responsiveness via activation of a non-canonical TGF-β pathway.
  Enhanced TGF-β signaling results in increased collagen and α-SMA expressions. Elevated
  collagen deposition and scar contraction leads to the formation of a competent scar
  that improves postishemic heart function and prevents adverse remodeling.
