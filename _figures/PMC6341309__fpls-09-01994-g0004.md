caption: Overview of the changes in physiological traits and gene expression between
  very segmented transpiration (STR+) and linear transpiration (LTR) durum wheat lines.
  The scheme shows the significant mean expression of better or up-regulated values
  of LTR lines (red underline) and STR+ lines (blue underline) as well as significant
  traits evaluated across all field trials and the integrated pathway of N and C metabolism.
  Data used corresponds to the 20 lines growth in the different yield environments
  (i.e., trials) where gene expression was analyzed, with three biological replicates
  (i.e., three plots of each trial) for each line and yield environment. For trait
  and transcript abbreviations see Tables , .
