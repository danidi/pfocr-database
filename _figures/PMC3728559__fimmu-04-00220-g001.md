caption: The HXA3 inflammatory pathway. (A) Infection of the epithelial cell (blue)
  surface by pathogenic bacteria (red) induces signaling through pattern recognition
  receptors, including TLR5, and activation of NFkB, leading to pro-inflammatory responses
  including basolateral secretion of IL-8. An IL-8 gradient forms that is imprinted
  in the subepithelial extracellular matrix, and IL-8 binds to endothelial cell (green)
  surface in order to recruit neutrophils out of the vasculature. Meanwhile, bacterial
  infection activates phospholipase A2-mediated liberation of arachidonic acid from
  the plasma membrane. Arachidonic acid is converted to HXA3 via the action of 12/15-lipoxygenase
  and secreted from the apical surface via the action of MRP2. HXA3 released into
  the lumen diffuses across the paracellular junction between epithelial cells to
  create a concentration gradient that will recruit neutrophils across the epithelium.
  (B) Neutrophils extravasate through endothelial cells into lamina propria, where
  they sense the HXA3 gradient, and migrate across the epithelial paracellular junction
  into the lumen. There, they encounter bacteria and release effectors including ROS
  and proteases, which can also lead to collateral damage to epithelial cells (dying
  cell shown in orange).
