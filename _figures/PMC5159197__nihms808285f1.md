caption: A hypothesis on the multi-hit process of the pathogenesis of IgAN explains
  autoimmune features of the disease, wherein Gd-IgA1 is recognized by anti-Gd-IgA1
  autoantibodies, resulting in the formation of immune complexes, some of which deposit
  in the kidney and incite glomerular injury []. Mucosal infection-associated inflammatory
  mediators may in genetically predisposed subjects activate plasma-cell precursors,
  possibly originating from mucosal tissues, to produce pGd-IgA1 at higher proportions
  in IgAN patients (red arrows) relative to healthy controls (blue arrows).Gal deficiency
  is associated with aberrant O-glycosylation of IgA1 HR (A)O-glycosylation is initiated
  by a family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts)
  which catalyze the transfer of GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl group on Ser
  or Thr residues (S/T). GalNAc-T2 was the identified as the key enzyme initiating
  glycosylation of IgA1 []. GalNAc-T14 is another candidate GalNAc-T involved in IgA1
  HR O-glycosylation [, ]. Attachment of GalNAc is followed by addition of Gal from
  UDP-Gal catalyzed by C1GalT1. Synthesis of the stable enzyme C1GalT1 depends on
  Core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase-specific chaperone (Cosmc). The Core 1 disaccharide
  can be decorated with sialic acid residue(s) transferred from CMP-neuraminic acid
  (CMP-NeuAc) by sialyltransferases to either Gal or GalNAc or both. The reactions
  are catalyzed by a Galβ1,3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal) and a α2,6-sialyltransferase
  (ST6GalNAc), respectively. In IgA1-producing cells, sialylation of GalNAc is catalyzed
  exclusively by ST6GalNAc II [, ]. Patients with IgAN have elevated serum levels
  of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1, with some of their O-glycans Gal-deficient and,
  thus, composed of GalNAc or sialylated GalNAc [, ]. This aberrancy is associated
  with decreased activity of C1GalT1 and increased activity of ST6GalNAc II, in the
  IgA1-producing cells from the patients with IgAN []. Sialylated GalNAc (α2,6) represents
  a terminal step of the O-glycosylation pathway, as it presents a block for further
  O-glycan processing [, ].pGd-IgA1 in the circulation is recognized by autoantibodies
  specific for Gd-IgA1 HR glycans or glycopeptides, leading to the formation of nephritogenic
  circulating immune complexes (CIC). pGd-IgA1-containing CIC are not effectively
  eliminated by liver clearance (hepatocytes) because of its large size precluding
  entry into the space of Disse and the reduced binding to liver receptor for IgA,
  the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), due to occupation of Gd-IgA1 O-glycans
  by the autoantibody. In contrast, normal circulatory IgA1, mostly monomeric, is
  effectively eliminated by liver hepatocytes after binding to ASGPR (blue arrows).Therapeutic
  outlook for interference with immune-complex formation (B). Formation of CIC in
  IgAN could be prevented by monovalent analogs of Gd-IgA1-specific autoantibodies
  (scFv, Fab, VHH) or by analogs of Gd-IgA1 hinge region (α1-HR-α2, HR). scFv, Fab,
  VHH would block the epitopes on Gd-IgA1, whereas α1-HR-α2 or HR must be prepared
  as GalNAc-osylated polypeptides to neutralize Gd-IgA1-specific autoantibodies.Nephritogenic
  CIC are inefficiently eliminated by liver clearance and ultimately may deposit in
  the mesangium after passing through fenestrae in glomerular capillary endothelial
  cells. CIC bind to mesangial cells, involving transferrin receptor (CD71), and activate
  them. This process may be enhanced by alternative complement pathway activation.
  Subsequently, mesangial cells proliferate and produce inflammatory mediators and
  extracellular matrix proteins, thus inciting glomerular injury (C)
