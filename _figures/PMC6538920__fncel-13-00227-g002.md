caption: Wnt signaling deregulation in the aging brain and in AD. (A) Wnt signaling
  components are deregulated in both the aging and AD brain. Notably, the Wnt antagonist
  Dkk1 is upregulated, whereas Wnt ligands, Dvl, ß-catenin, and TCF are downregulated,
  leading to decreased canonical Wnt signaling. (B) As Dkk1 mainly affects the canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway, we propose a model by which elevation of Dkk1 results in
  an imbalance between the Wnt/ß-catenin and PCP pathways, resulting in synaptic defects
  and synapse loss. (C) In the brain of AD subjects and AD mouse models, the Wnt antagonist
  Dkk1 is elevated, leading to increased activity of both Gsk3ß and ROCK, thus resulting
  in reduced Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and increased PCP signaling. The activation of
  these two kinases leads to synapse vulnerability but the precise mechanisms downstream
  remain to be defined. A possible mechanism is that tau phosphorylation and actin
  remodeling contribute to synaptic changes (gray arrows and diffuse red boxes in
  the scheme) and subsequent cognitive deficits. These results suggest that pharmacologically
  targeting Wnt signaling could be a promising therapeutic strategy for synapse protection
  in AD.
