caption: Role of serotonin in hematopoiesis. In zebrafish and mouse embryos, serotonin
  has been demonstrated to control the development of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
  cells (HSPCs), but through different mechanisms. In zebrafish, stresses, such as
  hypoxia, can induce the release of serotonin from serotonergic neurons in the central
  nervous system (CNS); through the receptor(s) on hypothalamus, serotonin can activate
  the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interregnal (HPA/I) axis to promote the production
  of glucocorticoid in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) and accelerate the formation
  of HSPCs. In contrast, in the AGM of mouse embryos, serotonin can be directly produced
  by the endothelial cells to maintain the survival of HSPCs. This process is regulated,
  through serotonin receptors expressed on HSPCs, by inhibiting the pro-apoptotic
  pathway mediated by the AKT-Foxo1 signaling. In humans, serotonin can also promote
  the expansion of umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells in vitro and ex vivo.
