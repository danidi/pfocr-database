caption: Modulation of plant-pathogen defense responses by mineral limitation. Increasing
  evidence indicates that nutritional status has an impact on plant defense. In Arabidopsis,
  phosphate limitation can modulate defense signaling either via the jasmonic acid
  (JA) pathway or via PHR1, a master regulator that governs responses to phosphate
  starvation. PHR1 has a dual function of modulating the plant immune system, either
  by inhibiting the expression of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent genes or by activating
  a subset of JA-responsive genes that are mainly involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis
  (). Low potassium leads to opposite responses in Arabidopsis, barley, and rice (;
  ). Although low potassium leads to an increased level of JA and expression of JAZs
  genes in Arabidopsis and barley, a decreased level of JA occurs in rice. Upon low
  nitrate conditions, genes belonging to the WRKY transcription factor family are
  induced in Arabidopsis (), which in turn can regulate the SA/JA balance as well
  as hormone-related gene expression. Interestingly, a direct interaction between
  NLA and ORE1, two key regulators of nitrogen limitation and senescence, has recently
  been demonstrated. ORE1 is a NAC transcription factor (NAC092) that might modulate
  JA-dependent gene expression ().

  description: Modulation of plant-pathogen defense responses by mineral limitation.
    Increasing evidence indicates that nutritional status has an impact on plant defense.
    In Arabidopsis, phosphate limitation can modulate defense signaling either via
    the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway or via PHR1, a master regulator that governs responses
    to phosphate starvation. PHR1 has a dual function of modulating the plant immune
    system, either by inhibiting the expression of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent genes
    or by activating a subset of JA-responsive genes that are mainly involved in glucosinolate
    biosynthesis (). Low potassium leads to opposite responses in Arabidopsis, barley,
    and rice (; ). Although low potassium leads to an increased level of JA and expression
    of JAZs genes in Arabidopsis and barley, a decreased level of JA occurs in rice.
    Upon low nitrate conditions, genes belonging to the WRKY transcription factor
    family are induced in Arabidopsis (), which in turn can regulate the SA/JA balance
    as well as hormone-related gene expression. Interestingly, a direct interaction
    between NLA and ORE1, two key regulators of nitrogen limitation and senescence,
    has recently been demonstrated. ORE1 is a NAC transcription factor (NAC092) that
