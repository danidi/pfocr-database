caption: Central role of AP convertase in complement activation. Complement tickover
  occurs through hydrolysis of the C3 thioester, or cleavage of C3 to C3b by plasma
  proteases. Fluid phase production of either molecule results in formation of the
  AP C3 convertase, C3bBb, and production of further C3b which either binds a surface
  or remains fluid phase. Each newly produced C3b can in turn form a convertase, which
  cleaves C3, resulting in exponential production of C3b. This self-propagation, referred
  to as the ‘amplification loop’ and indicated here in red, is responsible for amplifying
  a small trigger to yield large responses. C3b formed through any activation pathway
  feeds into the amplification loop. Binding of C3b to C3 convertase creates C5 convertase;
  cleavage of C5 and generation of C5b marks the start of the terminal pathway. C6
  and C7 bind C5b to form C5b67, which is released from convertase, binds membrane
  and incorporates C8 and multiple C9 molecules to form the MAC. Self tissues are
  protected from accidental complement damage by regulatory proteins present in plasma
  and on membranes, indicated by maroon boxes. Note the abundance of regulators which
  control the amplification loop and C3 convertases.
