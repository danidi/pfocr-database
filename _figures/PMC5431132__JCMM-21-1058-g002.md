caption: Endoplasmic reticulum‐associated degradation (ERAD) and unfolded protein
  responses (UPR). Nascent polypeptides emerging into the ER as they are translated
  from their associated ribosomes undergo folding through linkage of cysteine residues
  by protein disulphide isomerases (PDIs). N‐terminal glycosylation forms binding
  sites for calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). These chaperones along with Grp78
  (BiP) direct misfolded proteins into retrotranslocation out of the ER, into degradation
  via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. ERAD constitutes a cell's first‐line countermeasure
  to the accumulation of potentially harmful metabolic detritus. Misfolded proteins
  displace GRP78/BiP from PERK, IRE1 and ATF6, thereby activating each factor. The
  activation of IRE1 mediates XBP1 splicing (sXBP1) and enhances lipids, chaperone
  ERAD proteins and also promotes autophagy. PERK activation globally reduces protein
  synthesis via  eIF2a phosphorylation, and ATF6 is cleaved to nATF6, promoting expression
  of a variety of UPR target genes.
