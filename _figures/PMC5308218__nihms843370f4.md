caption: '(A) Overlay of our experimental results with phosphorylation site annotations
  obtained from the PhosphoSite database. Large nodes represent proteins; small nodes
  represent their phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation sites detected in this study
  are denoted with a yellow circle. Detected interactions from our study are shown
  as the edges of the network; if available, interactions are linked to the phosphorylation
  sites which mediate the interaction (for some phospho-dependent interactions the
  specific site is unknown: “pY” nodes). The color of the phosphorylation sites denotes
  their functional annotation. Known upstream kinases are indicated (see legend key,
  RTK = receptor tyrosine kinase). Abi1, CD2AP, and CrkL were linked to the network
  based on additional literature-based evidences (dotted lines, ). This representation
  yields insights into the assembly of the identified core complexes. For example,
  we obtain detailed information on the phosphorylation-dependent assembly of the
  Grb2/Gab2/Shc1 complex. BCR-pY177 is crucial for the recruitment of this complex
  (), this site is phosphorylated by BCR-ABL1 itself, and it has been implicated in
  the regulation of growth and survival. The Grb2/Gab2/Shc1 core complex is stabilized
  through pair-wise interactions between all three components. (B) String database
  integration. A protein association network was obtained from the STRING database
  with an extended “multi names” query of all protein names in the adaptor complexome
  of panel A (). (C) High-level summary of network organization. Three adaptor complexes
  form the inner core of the network and three complexes are more peripheral. Implicated
  regulation of pErk, Pi3-kinase, and small GTPases is indicated. Regulation can be
  positive (+), negative (−), or mixed (Shc1). Literature information was used to
  annotate the more peripheral complexes: (1) the Stam2/Hrs complex, as well as ITSN2
  and Eps15l, function in the endosomal/vacuolar protein sorting pathway (; ; ); (2)
  the complex formed by Cd2ap is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton
  (); and (3) the Abi1/Wasf2(Wave2) complex regulates actin assembly (; ; ).'
