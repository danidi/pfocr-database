caption: Arid5a stabilizes interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Stat3 messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
  Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and induces IL-6 mRNA
  via activation of the signaling pathway of nuclear factor of κB (NF-κB). Regnase-1
  promotes IL-6 mRNA degradation in ribosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas
  Arid5a inhibits the destabilizing effect of Regnase-1. Roquin, which requires deadenylase
  for its function, degrades inactive mRNA in stress granules and processing bodies.
  In naïve CD4+ T cells, IL-6 activates signal transducers and activators of transcription
  (STAT)3 and induces transcription of IL-6-target genes, including Arid5a, which
  protects STAT3 mRNA from the degrading effect of Regnase-1. The regulation of IL-6
  and STAT3 mRNAs by Arid5a is important for the IL-6 production and strength of the
  IL-6R-mediated signaling. MyD88, Myeloid differentiation primary response 88; IκB,
  inhibitor of NF-κB; UTR, untranslated region.
