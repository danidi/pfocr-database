caption: 'Incorporation of non‐native monomers in the lignification process, via genetic
  modification to the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway (Scheme , see asterisked
  intermediates that are either the new monomers themselves, or give rise to a new
  monomer via the subsequent transformations shown here). The incorporation of new
  monomers (highlighted in red) by the same radical coupling modes gives rise to new
  structures in the lignin polymer (Table ), mainly as a result of new opportunities
  for rearomatisation of the intermediate quinone methides: a) In CCoAOMT‐deficient
  softwoods, caffeyl alcohol is incorporated into the lignins producing benzodioxane
  structures. Some plants, such as vanilla, make lignin in their seed coats entirely
  from caffeyl alcohol, producing a polymer that is almost entirely composed of long
  chains of benzodioxane units. b) Employing a novel monolignol transferase enzyme,
  FMT, Feruloyl‐CoA can be conjugated to a monolignol, coniferyl alcohol (CA) or sinapyl
  alcohol (SA), to produce monolignol ferulate conjugates. Formation of labile ester
  linkages in the lignin polymer backbone can be achieved via lignification with a
  proportion of its monomer pool as these monolignol ferulate conjugates. Conjugates
  of this type are incorporated into the lignin structure in the same manner as conventional
  monomers. c) Ferulic acid itself can be formed either via the action of the enzyme
  HCALDH or by downregulation of CCR (Scheme ). During lignification, double‐β‐O‐4‐coupling
  is undergone, to yield acid‐labile acetal bonds in the lignin. d) The intermediate,
  coniferaldehyde, accumulates in CAD‐deficient plants and can be incorporated into
  lignins via β‐O‐4‐coupling (shown) as well as other modes (not shown); the β‐O‐4‐coupling
  product is unsaturated due to the acidity of the β‐proton in the quinone methide
  intermediate that allows rearomatisation via H‐abstraction. e) In COMT‐deficient
  angiosperms, the intermediate 5‐hydroxyconiferaldehyde that accumulates can still
  be reduced by CAD, producing 5‐hydroxyconiferyl alcohol that, like caffeyl alcohol,
  produces benzodioxane analogues in the lignin. f) Sinapaldehyde also incorporates
  into lignins in CAD‐deficient angiosperms.'
