caption: The mitochondrial network is dynamic with events of membrane fusion and fission
  within the network. The morphology of the mitochondrial network observed reflects
  the balance between these events. An increase in fission or a decrease of fusion
  is favourable to mitophagy when an increase of fusion or decreased fission inhibits
  the mitophagy. A simplified view of mitophagy is represented in the cartoon; briefly
  a dysfunctional mitochondria is targeted, potentially by Parkin and Pink1 proteins,
  to a forming autophagosome, the phagophore. The phagophore formation is under the
  control of Atg5/7 proteins notably. The autophagosome matures and engulfs the mitochondria
  before fusing with a lyososome for degradation. Our IN Cell system is able to measure
  the co-localization between mitochondria and autophagosome.
