caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of the 450 target genes of the 11 miRNA using
  Enrichment Map []. 450 genes targeted by the 11 miRNA were identified using ExpNet.
  I used DAVID online tool to identify enriched pathways of the 450 genes using Enrichment
  Map []. Results showed that the target genes are enriched with multiple cancer pathways
  including prostate, thyroid, and pancreatic cancer pathways.
