caption: Increased metabolic endotoxemia may occur and activate the TLR4 pathway via
  the adapter protein, MyD88, leading to immune cell activation and inflammation.
  Also, macrophages could infiltrate the adipose tissue and activate mitogen-activated
  protein kinases, such as c-Jun aminoterminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB, resulting in
  increased cross-talk and adipose-tissue–derived adipokines. A hyperglycemic and
  high fat diet could also result in changes to the gut microbiome by altering the
  content of histidine, glutamate, SCFAs, and other factors and promote gut-barrier
  dysfunction and conditions prevalent in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes
  by altering the host response. All of these metabolic alterations that result in
  increased systemic inflammation, macrophage activity, and TLR activation contribute
  to the increased cardiometabolic burden in obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
