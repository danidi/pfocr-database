caption: Effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 and Aβ on the key reactions involved in the sphingolipid
  metabolic pathway. The effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 is shown in blue and dashed lines,
  whereas the effect of Aβ treatment or alterations associated with AD on the key
  enzymes involved in the reactions are shown in red and continuous line.
