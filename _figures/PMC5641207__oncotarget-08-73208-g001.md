caption: 'The MYC pathway is activated in a patient with HNSCC by analysis of the
  cell lysate. MYC pathway activation was also detected in single CCR5+ breast cancer
  cells. (A) RNA-seq of a HNSCC lysate shows activation of multiple members in the
  MYC pathway. (B) Single-cell RNA-seq shows activation of MYC members through VEGFA
  and SP1. (C) Another single-cell RNA-seq shows activation of the MYC pathway through
  JUN and VEGFA. This heterogeneity of MYC pathway activation could explain why target
  therapies based on cell lysate results are often not effective or fail to control
  the cancers which contain multiple activation patterns of the MYC pathway. Red:
  upregulation; Green: down-regulation. Up- or down-regulation are calculated with
  fold difference of expression level cancer lysate/non-cancer lysate or cancer single
  cell/normal single-cell respectively. Darker color indicates higher fold changes.'
