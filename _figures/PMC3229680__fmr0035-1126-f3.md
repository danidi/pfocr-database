caption: Biosynthetic pathways of important nucleotide and lipid-linked sugar donors
  involved in the synthesis of PIMs, lipomannan and Man-LAM. Most of the sugars utilized
  by mycobacteria are derived from glycolytic intermediates or glucose as the major
  carbon source. The experimentally characterized enzymes have been indicated in bold.
  Apart from the glycolytic pathway, GDP-Manp, C50-P-Manp, C50-P-Araf and PI are also
  derived from exogenous sources, which have not been shown here to retain simplicity.
