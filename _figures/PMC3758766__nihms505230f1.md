caption: a) The intestinal epithelium normally provides an effective barrier to macromolecules,
  bacterial products, and food antigens, but a small percentage can cross the tight
  junction (dashed arrow). In genetically susceptible individuals, translocation of
  luminal materials has been proposed to trigger exaggerated mucosal immune activation
  and cytokine release (e.g. IL-13, TNF, IFN-γ), which subsequently activates two
  distinct pathways of trans-tight junction flux. These are referred to as the pore
  (thin arrow) and leak (bold arrow) pathways, and are selectively activated by IL-13
  and TNF, respectively. Increased tight junction permeability may lead to further
  translocation of macromolecules from the lumen into the lamina propria and amplification
  of mucosal immune activation. In the absence of appropriate regulatory signals,
  this vicious cycle may progress to disease.b) Intestinal permeability is most commonly
  measured by fractional urinary excretion of orally ingested probes. These probes
  can cross the intestinal epithelium by the paracellular pathway and enter the blood
  stream. They are then filtered by the glomerulus and excreted in the urine. Ideal
  probes are not metabolized in the intestinal lumen or blood, are readily filtered
  by the glomerulus, and are not actively absorbed or secreted in the kidney. Fractional
  urinary excretion can therefore be used as an indirect measure of intestinal permeability.
