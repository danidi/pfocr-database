caption: A testable model for the modulating role of Dcs1 in the yeast stress response.
  Increases in yeast growth rate, or stress conditions, can accelerate mRNA turnover,
  thus increasing the rate of generation of mRNA turnover products, including m7G-oligoribonucleotides,
  m7GDP and other m7G-derivatives. In the 5′→3′ pathway, decapping of deadenylated
  but capped mRNA yields m7GDP, which is a substrate of Dcs1. In the 3′→5′ pathway,
  m7G-oligoribonucleotides are the final products of exosome-catalysed degradation.
  Where there is a reduction in the activity of Dcs1 (and more markedly where Dcs2
  activity is also reduced), m7G-oligoribonucleotides and m7GDP levels increase and
  compete with capped mRNA for eIF4F and thereby inhibit translation initiation. In
  our experiments, we studied the extreme case where DCS1 and/or DCS2 were disrupted.
  Due to this inhibition, or possibly via an alternative stimulatory route, cAMP-PKA-mediated
  activation of STRE-promoters occurs, inducing a stressed state. Dashed arrows represent
  pathways that generate strong inhibitors of translation. Dotted arrows indicate
  potential stimulatory routes for STRE-dependent transcriptional activation, with
  the cAMP-PKA pathway providing one such route. In the latter case, inhibition of
  cAMP-PKA activity has to be repressed in order for transcription to be stimulated.
