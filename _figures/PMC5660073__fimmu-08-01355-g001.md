caption: 'Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell-mediated immune surveillance of blood
  cancer and counteractive evasion strategies utilized by blood cancer cells. (Left)
  iNKT cells recognize glycolipid antigens presented on CD1d, commonly expressed by
  blood tumor cells. Recognition of glycolipid:CD1d complex via the invariant T cell
  receptor (TcR) leads to a cascade of events: the production of immunomodulatory
  cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNFα), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), release of
  cytolytic mediators such as perforin/granzyme, activation of antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and IL-12 production, as well as the
  rapid transactivation of NK cells and T cells. iNKT cells can also recognize tumor
  and degranulate in a CD1d-independent manner via Natural Killer Group 2D (NKG2D)
  receptors. (Right) In turn, tumor cells can evade recognition and killing by downregulating
  CD1d, NKG2D-L, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL-L) and FAS/CD95. In
  addition, certain blood tumors can disrupt death signaling pathways to avoid killing.
  Some blood tumors express aberrant levels of glycolipids or shed soluble glycolipids
  and NKG2D-L which in turn dysregulate normal signaling pathway in iNKT cells. Blood
  tumors cells can also skew the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) in iNKT
  cells. IL-4 is associated with the activation of regulatory T cells (Treg) which
  are involved in dampening of antitumor responses. Dysfunction of iNKT cells have
  also been associated with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their ability
  to induce hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment.'
