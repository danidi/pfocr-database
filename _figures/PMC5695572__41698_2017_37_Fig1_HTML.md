caption: Protein pathway activation map of the AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways. Cancer
  Landscape (CScape) Protein Pathway Activation Maps are shown in the center of the
  figure comparing the 5 min compared to baseline a on top and the 24 h comparison
  on the center bottom b. More significant positive differences are shown in increasing
  shades of red, whereas higher negative differences are shown in green. White balloons
  represent no significant change. Each balloon pin is placed over the protein measured.
  Magnified views of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (blue boxes, left top showing the
  5 min time point, A1 and bottom right showing the 24 h time, B1) are shown to reveal
  pathway detail and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (red boxes, right top showing the 5 min
  time point, A2 and bottom left showing the 24 h time, B2). Images are modified from
  the “Pathways in Human Cancer” diagram courtesy of Cell Signaling, Inc
