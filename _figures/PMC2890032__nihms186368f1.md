caption: 'A subset of projection neurons in the striatum and the cortex (represented
  by dashed lines) are particularly vulnerable in HD. These include medium spiny neurons
  (MSNs, pink dashed lines) of the striatum and large pyramidal projection neurons
  in cortical layers V, VI and III of the cerebral cortex (gray dashed lines). MSNs
  in the “indirect pathway” of the basal ganglia project to the external segment of
  the globus pallidus (GPe) and are affected early in the course of the disease. As
  HD progresses, MSNs projecting to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi)
  via the “direct pathway” and cortical pyramidal cells projecting to the striatum
  are also impaired. Remarkably, most interneurons in both the striatum (pink solid
  lines) and the cerebral cortex (gray solid lines) are largely spared. This morphological
  and functional difference has been proposed to play a role in the differential vulnerability
  of neurons observed in HD (), as well as other neurodegenerative diseases (, , ).
