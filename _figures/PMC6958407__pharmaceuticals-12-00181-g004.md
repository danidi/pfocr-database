caption: Proposed model for modulations of Hippo pathway by PDEF. Our results show
  that PDEF increases expression and phosphorylation (Ser127) of YAP1 in prostate
  cancer cells. We hypothesize that PDEF might regulate YAP1 phosphorylation indirectly
  by modulating expression and or activities of various components of the Hippo pathway
  as shown. PDEF overexpression inhibits the YAP1 conserved gene signature. Dashed
  red lines indicate hypothetical links, while solid black lines indicate currently
  established pathways. The solid red line link was established for the first time
  in the present study.
