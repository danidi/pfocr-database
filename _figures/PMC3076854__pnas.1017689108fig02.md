caption: Global transcriptome analysis reveals CB1R-dependent, PHX-induced up-regulation
  of key cell-cycle proteins. Transcript levels of cell-cycle proteins involved in
  mitosis progression (A) or spindle separation (B) were determined using ultrahigh-throughput
  RNA sequencing and grouped on the basis of pathway analyses. Genes whose expression
  is increased by PHX in wild-type but not in CB1−/− mouse liver are highlighted in
  yellow and include Foxm1 and its targets Ccnb2, Cdk1, and Knsl1 (A) as well as Rad21
  and Pcna (B). Relative mRNA levels are displayed as vertical red bars, with the
  four treatment groups juxtaposed in the indicated order for easy visual analysis.
