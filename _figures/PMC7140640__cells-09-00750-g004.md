caption: The molecular pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR. During ER stress
  the three ER transducers (IRE1, PERK, and ATF6) tend to get activated and start
  the UPR mechanism to counteract the ER stress and to bring back the homeostasis.
  Failure to negate the ER stress will result in cell death. IRE1 undergoes oligomerization
  in response to unfolded proteins and the BiP gets dissociated from IRE1. IRE1 undergoes
  either mRNA degradation or mRNA processing with the help of XBP-1, which triggers
  the production of protein folding genes thereby mitigating ER stress. On the other
  hand, ATF6 gets into the secretory pathway inside the Golgi apparatus wherein the
  S1P and S2P cleave the ATF6. ATF6 fragments then translocate into the nucleus, which
  act as a transcription factor to generate UPR target genes. PERK first phosphorylates
  itself and also phosphorylates eIF2α thereby inactivating eIF2B, which further inhibits
  the translation of serine 51. This process leads to the translation of ATF4 producing
  ER chaperones.
