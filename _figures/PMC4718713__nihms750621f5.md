caption: (A) The PRC1 subunit, BMI1, acts as an activator of the WNT pathway by repressing
  the Dickkopf (DKK) family of WNT inhibitors. The Wnt/β-Catenin pathway regulates
  stem cell pluripotency and cell fate decisions during development. In the presence
  of the Wnt ligand, the co-receptor LRP5/6 forms a complex with Wnt-bound frizzled,
  activating disheveled (Dvl) by sequential phosphorylation, poly-ubiquitination,
  and polymerization, which displaces GSK-3β from APC/axin, causing the nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin and the subsequent recruitment of TCF DNA-binding factors as co-activators
  for transcription. BMI1 represses the expression of the DKK proteins. DKK1 repression
  leads to the upregulation of the WNT target, c-Myc, which leads to further transcriptional
  autoactivation of BMI1. (B) The binding of TNFα to the TNF receptor (TNFR), causes
  the recruitment of TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), receptor-interacting
  protein (RIP) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to the cell membrane.
  Then, the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ/NFkB essential
  modulator (NEMO), is recruited to the TNFR1 signaling complex, which leads to IKKβ
  phosphorylation and activation. This results in the nuclear translocation of NFκB
  and its subsequent transactivation. BMI1 stimulates IKKβ phosphorylation and the
  nuclear translocation of NFκB, which stimulates Myc. This, in turn, activates BMI1,
  leading to a positive feedback loop.
