caption: Schematic representation of the putative retrograde signalling pathway from
  the chromoplast to the nucleus for crocetin accumulation and chromoplast development.
  Different kinds of apocarotenoids are produced by CCDs in the chromoplast of saffron
  stigma in a developmental-dependent way. Many of these apocarotenoids could diffuse
  through the chromoplast membranes into the cytosol and act directly as signals for
  gene expression modulation or could be further modified by CCD1. The resulting apocarotenoids
  may act as the inducers of gene expression modulation of carotenogenic genes, CsCCD2
  and other gene targets related to chromoplast biogenesis and homeostasis during
  flower development in saffron
