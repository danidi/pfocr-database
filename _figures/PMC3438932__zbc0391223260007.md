caption: 'Model of the role of dimeric TIR platform for the inhibition and activation
  of MyD88 signaling pathway. Left, monomeric and dimeric MyD88 TIR domains inhibit
  TLR signaling by binding to cytoplasmic TIR dimer of activated TLRs, preventing
  binding of MyD88. Tethered TIR dimer induce MyD88 oligomerization, which triggers
  assembly of the Myddosome complex. Right, model of the assembly of Myddosome induced
  by TLR dimerization: sequential addition of MyD88 through interactions with TIR
  of TLRs and TIRs of MyD88 assembles the DD complex and triggers phosphorylation
  of IRAK kinases.'
