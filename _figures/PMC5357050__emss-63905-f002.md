caption: BH4 biosynthesis proceeds from GTP via 7,8-dyhydroneopterin triphosphate
  and 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin. The first and rate-limiting step in the
  pathway is GTPCH. The following steps are catalysed by the enzymes PTPS and SR.
  An alternative pathway for BH4 synthesis has been documented whereby 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin
  is converted into sepiapterin by an enzyme termed ‘sepiapterin synthase’. Exogenous
  sepiapterin can be reduced in all cells by SR to BH2, and further by DHFR to form
  BH4, the so-called ‘salvage pathway’. The principle oxidant species leading to BH4
  oxidation to BH2 is peroxynitrite. As a cofactor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases
  in the liver and neurons, but not as a cofactor for NOS, BH4 is converted into tetrahydrobiopterin-4a-carbinolamine,
  which is recycled to BH4 by the actions of PCD and DHPR.
