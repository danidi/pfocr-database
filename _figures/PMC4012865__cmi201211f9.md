caption: Model of activation of DCs by HKBA showing the stimulation of TLR2 and TLR9
  and cross-talk between their respective signal transduction pathways. Upon exposure
  to HKBA, TLR2 present at the surface of the cell membrane of DCs initiates several
  signal transduction pathways. P38 MAPK provides a stimulatory signal for TNF induction,
  endocytosis and phagolysosome fusion, with subsequent exposure of bacterial DNA
  and TLR9 activation. Simultaneously, a Ras/RasGRP1 pathway mediates ERK activation.
  This signaling pathway is essential for TNF induction; however, it also provides
  negative feedback for TLR9-induced IL-12. DC, dentritic cell; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; HKBA, heat-killed Brucella abortus; MAPK, mitogen-activating
  protein kinase; RasGRP1, Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing protein 1; TLR, Toll-like
  receptor; TNF, tumor-necrosis factor.
