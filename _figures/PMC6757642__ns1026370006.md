caption: 'NGF activation of c-Jun: role of the MEK/ERK cascade and Egr proteins. The
  schematic diagram illustrates the signaling pathways linking NGF receptor stimulation
  with c-Jun activation. According to this model, c-Jun activation is dependent on
  both activation of the MEK/ERK cascade and expression of Egr family members induced
  by NGF in PC12 cells, i.e., Egr1 and Egr4. Thus, c-Jun activation by NGF can be
  suppressed by selective inhibitors of either pathway, i.e., UO126 or ZnEgr constructs.
  An arrowconnecting MEK/ERK and Egr1 has been included, because MEK(DD) stimulates
  the ERE reporter. In addition, anarrow connecting NGF directly toEgr1 has been included,
  because previous studies indicate that NGF can induce Egr proteins in PC12 cells
  via a MEK-independent pathway (; ).'
