caption: Scheme depicting how Monarch-1 suppresses inflammatory signaling. Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) and tumor necrosis factor family receptors (TNFRs) play a critical
  in the inflammatory response. TLRs recruit the adaptor molecules, myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88) and Tollip, which, in turn, recruit the kinase, IL-1 receptor–associated
  kinase (IRAK-1), to induce the activation of canonical nuclear factor (NF)–κB. IRAK-1
  becomes hyperphosphorylated, facilitating its dissociation from the receptor complex
  to mediate additional signaling pathways. One of the genes induced by the canonical
  pathway is NF-κB2/p100, which functions in the noncanonical pathway. The noncanonical
  pathway is triggered after the activation of NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK). This results
  in processing of p100 to its active form, p52. This alternative pathway induces
  a distinct set of genes and also regulates the expression of genes induced by the
  canonical pathway. Monarch-1 does not affect initial activation of the canonical
  pathway. However, Monarch-1 suppresses the noncanonical pathway by associating with
  NIK and inducing its degradation via the proteasome. Monarch-1 also associates with
  IRAK-1 and suppresses the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated forms of the kinase;
  however, it is unclear whether or not this also involves proteasome degradation.
