caption: The sequential steps of HCV propagation in a hepatocyte are shown in Panel
  A. The virus forms complexes with lipoproteins and circulates in the blood. HCV
  entry factors include scavenger receptor B1 (SCARB1), CD81, claudin 1 (CLDN1), occludin,
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 (NPC1L1).
  Panel B shows the virus-encoded gene products displayed topologically on the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane, as well as the major viral and host targets that are the focus
  of agents in advanced clinical development. Other targets in the HCV life cycle,
  such as viral proteins p7 and NS4B (Panel B), and host targets, including HCV entry
  factors, lipid metabolism, and membrane signaling pathway involved in replication
  (Panel A), are also being targeted for HCV therapeutic development. Inhibitors against
  some of the entry factors have already been developed for other purposes and are
  currently being tested as treatment for HCV infection.– The symbols (+) and (−)
  refer to the positive and negative strand, respectively, of the viral genome. CypA
  denotes cyclophilin A, E envelope glycoprotein, GAG glycosaminoglycan, LDLR low-density
  lipoprotein receptor, NI nucleoside analogue inhibitor, NNI non-nucleoside analogue
  inhibitor, and NS nonstructural protein.
