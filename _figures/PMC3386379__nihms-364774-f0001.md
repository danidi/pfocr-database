caption: A mitochondriocentric signal-transducer-effector pathway to nonischemic cardiomyocyte
  necrosis. Catecholamines and the calcitropic hormone, parathyroid hormone (PTH),
  each raises Ca2+ entry leading to intracellular Ca2+ overloading with the ensuing
  increment in cytosolic [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial [Ca2+]m, specifically the subsarcolemmal
  (SSM) population of these organelles. In response to mitochondrial Ca2+ overloading
  and ATP depletion, there follows the induction of oxidative stress by these organelles
  and subsequent opening of their inner membrane permeability transition pore (mPTP)
  with solute entry, osmotic swelling and structural degeneration of these organelles.
  This programmed sequence of events leads to cardiomyocyte necrosis with a leakage
  of intracellular contents, including troponins. Tissue repair follows the loss of
  necrotic cardiomyocytes. This healing eventuates in a reparative fibrosis that preserves
  the structural integrity of the myocardium. Microscopic scarring represents a morphologic
  trail, with elevated serum troponins, the biochemical footprints of cardiomyocyte
  necrosis
