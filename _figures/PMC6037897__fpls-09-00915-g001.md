caption: Plasma membrane (PM) and ER are involved in the plant heat stress response.
  Heat stress alters the physical state of membranes and affects membrane proteins
  as well as the membrane structure; for example, membrane microdomains can be subtly
  changed, which induces the clustering of signaling proteins correspondingly to make
  adjustments. The PM-located RBOHD is embraced within and regulated by the special
  membrane region; the calcium-permeable channel CNGC6, which is activated by cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), primarily mediates the calcium influx; and lipid
  translocases ABC and ALA cope with structural lipid flipping and/or flopping, resulting
  in changes to the membrane stability. Membrane-associated PIPK, PLD, and PLC perceive
  changes in the states of membranes and trigger the lipid-signaling molecules PIP2,
  PA, and IP3, respectively, and when phosphorylated to IP6, IP3 can mediate the calcium
  release from the ER. The burst of cytosolic calcium can also activate the RBOHD,
  which induces a rapid increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and triggers the ROS/redox
  signaling pathway, including MAPK-HSFs and MBF1c-HSFA3-DREB2A, during the heat stress
  response (HSR). MAPK-HSFs can regulate the expression of CAT, conversely controlling
  the level of ROS; the phosphorylation of calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK)
  also activates RBOHD. Calcium binding to CaM3 evokes CBK3/PP7 and the transcription
  factors of the HSR, such as HSFs and WRKY39. The heat sensors involved in the ER-UPR
  are comprised of bZIP28 (spliced in Golgi) and IRE1 (splicing bZIP60 mRNA), and
  ER-UPR also requires chaperone BiP binding to unfold protein for correct folding.
  The FAD2 and FAD3 in the ER are important components in the control of membrane
  fluidity during the HSR.
