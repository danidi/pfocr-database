caption: Hypothetical model of CNP action in the SRG. CNP binds to and activates a
  CNP-selective receptor guanylyl cyclase at the basolateral membrane (designated
  NPR-B), resulting in cGMP elevation. Endogenous cGMP, but not membrane-permeable
  and nonhydrolyzable cGMP analogs, compete with cAMP for degradation by a type 3
  phosphodiesterase (PDE3A) situated in the apical membrane, resulting in a local
  rise of cAMP levels. Cyclic AMP in the apical compartment, through activation of
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), causes multisite phosphorylation (Pn) of the
  regulatory (R) domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  and opening of the CFTR chloride channel (pathway 1, solid lines). Activation of
  CFTR by CNP is dependent on basal cAMP production by adenylyl cyclase (AC), which
  is inhibited by somatostatin through a specific receptor coupled to the inhibitory
  G protein Gαi. The operation of 3 other potential cGMP signaling pathways (dotted
  lines), i.e., cGMP activation of the type II isoform of cGMP-dependent protein kinase
  (cGKII) anchored through myristoyl groups to the apical membrane (pathway 2), cGMP
  cross-activation of PKA (pathway 3), and direct allosteric activation of CFTR by
  cGMP (pathway 4), is virtually excluded by the experiments reported here, identifying
  pathway 1 as the predominant, if not sole signaling pathway operating in the SRG
  epithelial cells. We emphasize that the positioning of PDE3A in the apical membrane
  in close vicinity to CFTR is entirely hypothetical and based on analogy with a recent
  PDE3-CFTR signaling model in human airway epithelial cells ().
