caption: 'Connection between the one carbon cycle and the transsulfuration pathway
  (GSH synthesis). Upper panel The methyl group of methionine is activated by adenylation
  to form S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAMe) that acts as the universal methyl donor for
  any acceptor including DNA: a molecule of homocysteine is formed. Homocysteine can
  be either re-methylated from folates or betaine or enter the transsulfuration pathway
  for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). Lower panel Homocysteine is complexed with
  serine to form cystathionine and to feed the de-novo synthesis of GSH'
