caption: Effect of colonization with P. indica on the expression of genes within the
  phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. Red colored squares indicate genes upregulated
  in the comparison of control versus P. indica; blue colored squares indicate down-regulated
  genes in this comparison. Homologs in Arabidopsis of all upregulated and downregulated
  soybean genes were mapped to the Arabidopsis KEGG pathway for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis–.
  Enzyme Commission (EC) codes colored in green boxes represent enzymatic steps present
  in soybean. Steps involved in biosynthesis of monolignol precursors sinapyl alcohol,
  coniferal alcohol, and 5-hydroxy-coniferal alcohol are shaded in the orange box.
  The final steps of production of G and S lignin (shaded brown box) are performed
  by peroxidases located within the plant cell wall. Biosynthesis of the iron-scavenging
  coumarin scopoletin is shaded in the pink box.
