caption: Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Conjugated bile acids (Conj-BA)
  are actively transported from the canalicular side of the hepatocyte by the bile
  salt export pump (BSEP; ABC B11) along with phospholipids (PL; ABC 4) and cholesterol
  (C; ABC G5/G8). Conjugated bile acids are actively transported into ileocytes by
  the sodium-dependent intestinal bile acid transporter (IBAT). Inside the ileocyte,
  bile acids induce the synthesis of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF-15/19) but
  are also bound by the intestinal bile acid binding protein (I-BABP). They exit the
  ileocyte on the basolateral side via the heterodimeric organic solute transporter
  (Ost-α/β). Bile acids and FGF-15/19 are transported back to the liver via the portal
  blood. Conjugated bile acids are actively transported into the hepatocyte primarily
  by the Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). FGF-15/19 binds to and
  activates hepatic fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), which in turn activates
  the JNK signaling pathway. Activation of JNK downregulates the gene encoding cholesterol
  7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), inhibiting bile acid synthesis.
