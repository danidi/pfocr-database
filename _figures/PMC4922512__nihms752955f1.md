caption: 'The figure shows a simplified outline of some of the different pathways
  for utilizing carbohydrates or fatty acids for the generation of ATP. These catabolic
  pathways and the anabolic pathways that they feed are under extremely complex levels
  of control, which have been studied mainly in non-infectious organisms (). However,
  the unique metabolic strategies employed by infectious bacteria are becoming more
  appreciated as important aspects of bacterial pathogenesis (). *ATP generated by
  substrate level phosphorylation; **ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation; Solid
  lines: Metabolic Pathway; Dashed lines: Substrates that feed into catabolic pathways
  and products generated by bacteria as a result of metabolism or required for metabolism;
  Dotted lines: Main energy yielding metabolites generated from pathways.Blue letters
  indicate specific points of importance for the energy-yielding metabolism of select
  pathogens listed below (see  for summary):A. Pathogenic Streptococci (S. mutans,
  S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae); B. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; C. Brucella
  abortus; D. Mycobacterium tuberculosis; E. Clostridium difficile; F. Enterohemorrhagic
  Escherichia coli (EHEC); G. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; H. Listeria monocytogenes.'
