caption: 'An overview of potential drug targets in cAMP signalling pathways in trypanosomatids.
  Potential drug targets are highlighted as filled circles and colour coded as follows:
  pink, protein kinase A (PKA); red, phosphodiesterase (PDE); and dark blue, adenylyl
  cyclase (AC). (A) A cAMP signalling pathway in Leishmania mediates cellular adaptation
  and survival during hypoxia. In Leishmania major promastigotes, knockout of heme-containing
  AC (HemAC-Lm) under hypoxic conditions leads to increased cell death . It is unknown
  whether HemAC-Lm inhibition leads to cell death in mammalian-stage parasites, but
  it is possible that HemAC-Lm has a role in adaptation to changes in environmental
  oxygen in all life-cycle stages by catalysing the production of cAMP, which binds
  and activates PKA leading to multiple downstream effects. (B) cAMP signalling components
  regulate essential processes in Trypanosoma cruzi. Inhibition of PKA in epimastigotes
  induces cell death  and is potentially implicated in immune evasion in the mammalian
  host by its interaction with trans-sialidases in trypomastigotes . PKA localises
  to both the cytosol and plasma membrane in trypomastigotes. The contractile vacuole
  complex (CVC) is part of the membranous spongiome network, which is essential for
  osmoregulation in T. cruzi. Inhibition of TcrPDEC2, which localises to the spongiome,
  in epimastigotes leads to dysregulation of the hyposmotic stress response , but
  it is unknown whether TcrPDEC2 also regulates this process in mammalian-stage parasites.
  (C) PDEB1 and 2 localise to the paraflagellar rod (PFR) and, when simultaneously
  knocked down, cell death occurs in vitro and the parasites are avirulent in mice
  . ESAG4 subfamily members are flagellar membrane-localised ACs that are highly expressed
  in bloodstream-form parasites. When the subfamily is simultaneously knocked down,
  cytokinesis defects occur, leading to cell death and the parasites have attenuated
  virulence in a mouse model .'
