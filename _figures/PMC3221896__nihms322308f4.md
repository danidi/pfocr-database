caption: Monocytes and endothelial cells contribute to one pathway leading to oxidation
  of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by iNOS- or eNOS-promoted generation of NO that
  is converted into the reactive nitrogen radical •NO2 by myeloperoxidase (MPO)-catalyzed
  reaction with H2O2. Low levels of oxidatively truncated phospholipids, present in
  minimally oxidized (mox)LDL, are sufficient to promote adhesion of monocytes to
  the vascular endothelium that facilitates extravasation into the subendothelial
  space where they become macrophages. There a family of γ-oxygenated-α,β-unsaturated
  aldehydic and carboxylic oxidatively truncated phospholipids (oxPCCD36) – that protrude
  like whiskers from the outer shell of oxLDL – bind strongly with the scavenger receptor
  CD36, promoting endocytosis of oxLDL by the macrophages and leading to foam cell
  formation and atherogenesis. Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI. Reprinted
