caption: Salmonella central carbon metabolism. Shown are genes and enzymes of the
  central carbon metabolism covering glycolysis, PPP, KDPG/Entner–Doudoroff pathway,
  oxidative carboxylation, TCA cycle, and anaplerotic reactions. Boxes represent metabolites,
  arrows indicate enzyme reactions. Metabolites and enzymes are colored according
  to the color of their pathway name. Arrows are directed according flux direction
  under glucose metabolism but may vary under different conditions. Detailed information
  on importance of the illustrated pathways in intracellular infection is outlined
  in the text including behavior of an array of different enzyme mutations. 1,3pg,
