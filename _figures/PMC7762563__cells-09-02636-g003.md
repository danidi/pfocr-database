caption: Ang-TIE therapeutics against diabetic retinal diseases. The schema indicates
  possible Ang-TIE targeting drugs for diabetic retinal diseases and their signaling
  targets in ECs. Faricimab, a bispecific antibody that targets both Ang2 and VEGF-A,
  is in phase 3 clinical trials for diabetic retinal diseases, such as diabetic macular
  edema (DME). VE-PTP inhibitors, ARP-1536 and AKB-9778, which can activate the Ang1-TIE2
  pathway, are under clinical development for DME. In addition, VE-PTP inhibition
  by those drugs deactivate VEGFR2. In a phase 2a clinical trial, AKB-9778 with ranibizumab,
  a recombinant VEGF-A antibody, resulted in significant reduction in DME. A collagen
  IV-derived peptide, ATX107, is under clinical development. ATX107 uniquely converted
  Ang2 into a TIE2 agonist, and thereby activating TIE2 signaling in experimental
  models. ATX107 also inhibited VEGF signaling. In experimental models of diabetes,
  soluble Ang1 variant, COMP-Ang1, protected retinal vascular structure, blood retinal
  barrier integrity, and visual dysfunction.
