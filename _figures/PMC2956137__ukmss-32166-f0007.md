caption: 'Insults that induce apoptosis can be grouped into three major families:
  NaAsO2 induces Puma in a p53- and ER stress-independent manner that depends on TAp73.
  It may be possible that Scottin induces some ER stress downstream of TAp73 as well.
  Although NaAsO2 induces Bim and Noxa, we do not think they contribute to NaAsO2-induced
  apoptosis as both are elevated equally in both wildtype and Puma knockout neurons,
  yet Puma knockout is sufficient to completely protect against NaAsO2-induced apoptosis
  but knockout of either gene does not reduce apoptosis. DNA damage (and likely oxidative
  stress and okadaic acid) induce Puma in a strictly p53-dependent manner; in the
  absence of p53, neurons do not induce Puma and do not undergo apoptosis. ER stress-induced
  apoptosis is not p53-dependent. However, unlike NaAsO2, ER stress does not induce
  p73 though, like NaAsO2, it is Bim-independent.'
