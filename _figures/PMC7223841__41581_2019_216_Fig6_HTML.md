caption: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is required for distinct reactions
  in glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  that lead to the generation of ATP via the electron transport chain (ETC) in mitochondria.
  In healthy renal tubular epithelial cells, this ATP is utilized to provide the energy
  required for key functions, such as solute transport and maintenance of membrane
  integrity. Efficient FAO also prevents the potentially toxic accumulation of storage
  fats. NAD+ might also exert renoprotective effects via its interactions with sirtuins
  and PPARγ co-activator 1α (PGC1α). Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activates PGC1α via NAD+-dependent
  deacetylation and PGC1α in turn promotes NAD+ biosynthesis via the de novo pathway
  by co-ordinately upregulating the expression of the genes encoding enzymes in this
  pathway. PGC1α promotes mitochondrial quality control and ATP production via interrelated
  process that include mitochondrial biogenesis and the induction of mitophagy via
  transcription factor EB (TFEB). SIRT3 also utilizes NAD+ to directly promote healthy
  mitochondrial function and SIRT1 may limit stress signalling through the pro-apoptotic
  Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. In addition to its effects on mitochondria,
  PGC1α signalling can induce the production of vascular trophic molecules, such as
  VEGF. In tubular epithelial cells, a PGC1α-dependent product of FAO, β-hydroxybutyrate
  (β-OHB), may signal the production of vasodilator prostaglandins that can maintain
  renal blood flow during conditions such as shock that would otherwise promote renal
  ischaemia. Phosphorylation of NAD+ to NADP+ may potentiate defence against oxidant
  stress induced by inflammation, toxins, or ischaemia–reperfusion injury by promoting
  the reduction of glutathione (GSH) and through the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO•).
  Mitochondrial quality control may also limit the burden of free radicals emanating
  from injured mitochondria.
