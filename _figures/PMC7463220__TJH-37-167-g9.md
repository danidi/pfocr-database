caption: Schematic representation suggested for the plausible mechanisms of action
  of BKM120 in KG-1 cells. Via abrogation of the PI3K signaling pathway, BKM120 diminished
  the survival and proliferative capacity of the cells, possibly through escalation
  of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 and subsequent G2/M arrest. As
  presented, suppression of PI3K induced apoptotic cell death through upregulation
  of proapoptotic genes and downregulation of antiapoptotic genes, which may, at least
  in part, be overshadowed by the activation of c-Myc expression.
