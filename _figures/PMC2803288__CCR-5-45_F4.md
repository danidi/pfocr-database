caption: Schematic diagram depicting the pathway via which GC-A signaling inhibits
  cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophic agonists such as Ang II, norepinephrine
  and endothelin-1 stimulate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and activate phospholipase
  C (PLC). Subsequent production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) leads to release of
  Ca2+ from intracellular stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which raises
  cytosolic Ca2+ to a level sufficient to activate the calmodulin-regulated phosphatase
  calcineurin. Once activated, calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcription factor
  nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which facilitates its nuclear translocation.
  NFAT and GATA then act cooperatively to activate transcription of the hypertrophic
  gene program, including the ANP and BNP genes. We propose that endogenous ANP and
  BNP exert their antihypertrophic effects by stimulating GC-A/PKG-mediated regulator
  of G protein signaling subtype 4 (RGS4) phosphorylation/activation, which leads
  RGS4 to associate with Gαq, thereby increasing the GTPase activity of Gαq. This
  in turn inhibits calcineurin-NFAT signaling and suppresses hypertrophy-related gene
  transcription. Adopted from reference [].
