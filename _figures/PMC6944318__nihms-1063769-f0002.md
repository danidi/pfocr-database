caption: To support proliferation, cells take up more glucose and amino acids such
  as glutamine, which provide the carbon and nitrogen sources for catabolic processes
  and biosynthetic reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway (blue) supports nucleotide
  biosynthesis and regenerates NADPH, which provides reducing power to biosynthetic
  and redox pathways. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (green) produces UDP-GlcNAc,
  which is important for the glycosylation reactions that regulate protein folding
  and function. While the glycerol backbone of phospholipids is synthesized via the
  glycolytic precursor dihydroxacetone phosphate (DHAP), the fatty acyl chains can
  be synthesized via carbon engendered in the Krebs cycle (brown). The serine biosynthesis
  pathway is also important not only for serine and glycine synthesis, but for the
  formation of methyl donors such as methylene tetrahydrofolate and for NADPH generation
  (yellow).
