caption: The reaction steps of the Wnt pathway are numbered 1 to 19. Protein complexes
  are denoted by the names of their components, separated by a slash and enclosed
  in brackets. Phosphorylated components are marked by an asterisk. Single-headed
  solid arrows characterize reactions taking place only in the indicated direction.
  Double-headed arrows denote binding equilibria. Blue arrows mark reactions that
  have only been taken into account when studying the effect of high axin concentrations.
  Broken arrows represent activation of Dsh by the Wnt ligand (step 1), Dsh-mediated
  initiation of the release of GSK3β from the destruction complex (step 3), and APC-mediated
  degradation of axin (step 15). The broken arrows indicate that the components mediate
  but do not participate stoichiometrically in the reaction scheme. The irreversible
  reactions 2, 4, 5, 9–11, and 13 are unimolecular, and reactions 6, 7, 8, 16, and
  17 are reversible binding steps. The individual reactions and their role in the
  Wnt pathway are explained in the text.
