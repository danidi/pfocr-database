caption: Bile acid synthesis occurs by two pathways, the classic ‘neutral’ pathway
  and the alternative ‘acidic’ pathway. In the classic ‘neutral’ pathway, the rate-limiting
  step in bile acid formation is the conversion of cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol
  by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Multiple sequential steps that modify both the steroid
  nucleus and the side chain produce cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. The main
  enzymes in this process include cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid
  dehydrogenase (encoded by HSD3B7), sterol 12a-hydroxylase, Δ4-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase
  (encoded by AKR1D1 [previously known as SRD5B1]) and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
  A series of side-chain modifications then occurs to yield cholic and chenodeoxycholic
  acid. Alternatively, via the alternative ‘acidic’ pathway, cholesterol is converted
  to 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestanoic acid by sterol 27-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP27A1).
  This is followed by conversion to 3β, 7α-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid by oxysterol
  7α-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP7B).
