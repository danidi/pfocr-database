caption: Upon binding to epithelial SYG-2, SYG-1 localized in the HSN signals through
  WVE-1 to increase actin polymerization. In an analogous pathway, in the nerve ring,
  secreted UNC-6 from glial cells stimulates UNC-40 expressed in AIY, which then actives
  a cascade of CED-5, CED-10, and MIG-10. MIG-10 interacts with ABI-1, a member of
  the WAVE complex that directs cytoskeletal remodeling. In the case of the HSN pathway
  (blue proteins), actin polymerization facilitates the recruitment of SYD-1, SYD-2,
  and downstream active zone proteins to the dense projection (red) through the actin-binding
  protein, NAB-1. The glial/nerve ring pathway (green proteins) induces actin polymerization,
  which is required for synaptic vesicle localization; however, actin polymerization
  appears to be dispensable for the recruitment of SYD-1 and SYD-2 to the active zone
  in this case, suggesting an alternative mechanism. Black arrows represent signaling
  events; white arrows represent protein complex recruitment.
