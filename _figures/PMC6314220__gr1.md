caption: Schematic representation of activation pathway of TH-302 and the spatially
  resolved (SR)-PK/PD model. (A) Mechanism of TH-302 activation. 1-electron reduction
  of TH-302 generates a prodrug radical anion which further undergoes fragmentation
  to the DNA crosslinker Br-IPM and a benzylic radical (which generates ‘Trigger-H';
  Tr-H) under hypoxia. IPM is a more stable downstream product of Br-IPM that retains
  DNA crosslinking ability. In the presence of oxygen, the radical anion is rapidly
  back-oxidized to the parent prodrug, suppressing Br-IPM formation. In addition,
  under hypoxia the radical anion can be further reduced to the hydroxylamine (1),
  which can also fragment to Br-IPM. Hydration of the hydroxylamine generates the
  relatively stable hydroxylamine alcohol (2). The E.coli 2-electron nitroreductase
  NfsA bypasses formation of the radical anion and generates the hydroxylamine (1)
  even in the presence of O2. (B) The SR-PK/PD model employs Green's functions to
  calculate steady-state concentration gradients of O2, TH-302 and its metabolites
  in mapped microvascular networks. Blood flows are adjusted to simulate observed
  hypoxic fractions, and TH-302 inputs are defined by the measured plasma PK of TH-302
  in mice. Diffusion of TH-302 and metabolites in the extracellular compartment is
  determined by their diffusion coefficients (D), while transport across the plasma
  membrane is defined by the rate constants kin and kout. Metabolic activation of
  TH-302 (rate constant kmet), as a function of O2 concentration, is restricted to
  the intracellular compartment, whereas chemical reduction of TH-302 in extracellular
  compartment and extra- and intracellular formation of Br-IPM and IPM are defined
  by re and ri. These reaction-transport parameters determine the AUC of the prodrug
  and its metabolites, and thus cell killing probability, at each point of the tumor
  microenvironment.
