caption: 'Extrinsic coagulation cascade initiated by the tissue factor-coagulation
  factor VII pathway. TF-fVIIa complex formation on the plasma membrane triggers an
  extrinsic coagulation cascade in response to injury. The TF-fVIIa complex located
  on the cell surface initiates the coagulation cascade by activating factor X via
  two different (coagulation factor IX-dependent or -independent) routes. This leads
  to fibrin deposition via the formation of thrombin. Blood coagulation completes
  by clot formation with other factors, such as platelets and red blood cells. FVII:
  Coagulation factor VII (fVII); TF: Tissue factor.'
