caption: Proposed effect of VASP on insulin resistance and inflammatory signaling.
  HF diet (HFD; rich in saturated fats) results in activation of NF-κB pathways in
  the vasculature, which fosters insulin resistance, as shown by reduced p-Akt, p-eNOS,
  and ultimately decreased NO production. p-VASP (Ser239) inhibits fat-induced NF-κB
  activation, which in turn results in restoration of insulin signaling with increased
  p-Akt and p-eNOS levels and increased NO bioavailablity. Our data demonstrate that
  VASP, downstream of the NO/cGMP pathway, is an important mediator in modulating
  diet-induced vascular inflammation and insulin resistance and hence, may represent
  a novel target for the treatment of obesity-related vascular complications.
