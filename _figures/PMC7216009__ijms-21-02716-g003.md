caption: The signal transduction pathway is represented as a network diagram shown
  in SBGN format (Systems biology graphical notations). Proteins that are involved
  in the pathway are shown as green bars with names of the proteins. Complexes of
  the proteins are shown by combining several proteins in one node. Nodes on the diagram
  are connected by lines that represent reactions (binding, phosphorylation, and other
  types of signaling reactions). Relationship between the components of the neurotrophic
  signaling pathway with the F2RL1 (PAR2), EIF2AK3 (PERK), and IL15 genes. The proteins
  encoded by the genes of the master regulators PAR2, PERK, and IL15 are highlighted
  in blue. The components of the neurotrophic signaling pathway are highlighted in
  red. The blue border around the input points from neurotrophic signaling.
