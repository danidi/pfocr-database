caption: (A) Cellular model of NE reserve stem cell function in airway repair. Each
  NEB consists of ~20–30 neuroendocrine cells (white) that function as airway sensors,
  signaling directly to pulmonary sensory neurons (black) and to other lung and immune
  cells. Several NE cells in each NEB (red, yellow, cyan cells) also have the ability
  to sense epithelial damage and stem cell potential (NEstem cells). These stem cells
  are fully differentiated and normally quiescent, but following injury to neighboring
  epithelial cells (gray) each NEstem self-renews in the NEB niche and some disperse
  into the injured area (red). Almost all NEstem reestablish quiescence one week after
  injury, except a rare cell (typically just one per NEB) that deprograms to a transit
  amplifying (TA) state. TA cells proliferate extensively over the new 1–2 weeks and
  reprogram to mature bronchial fates, forming a large monoclonal patch of regenerated
  airway epithelium surrounding the NEB (cyan). (B) Molecular model of NEstem regulation.
  NEstem sense three injury-induced signals (S1–3). One is a mitogen (S1) from dying
  cells such as club cells injured by naphthalene. It is a transient signal received
  by NEstem throughout the NEB, leading to inactivation of Rb and p53 and activating
  (derepressing) NEstem self-renewal. The second signal is an injury-induced motogen
  (S2) that induces NE dispersal, perhaps involving pathways that control NE cell
  migration and clustering during NEB development. The third is a Notch ligand (S3)
  that initiates NE deprogramming. This is a late (one week after injury) and highly
  restricted signal that leads to loss of NE identity typically in just a single peripheral
  NE cell and transition to the TA state. The fourth signal (S4) is a Notch ligand(s)
  that is active very late in the repair process (two to three weeks after injury).
  It induces reprogramming of TA cells to mature bronchial fates (e.g., club) to regenerate
  the epithelium, perhaps using the same Notch pathway components that select bronchial
  fates in development. (C) Model for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) initiation. Loss-of-function
  mutations in the obligate tumor suppressors Rb and p53 in NEstem cells (red clone
  in schematic) triggers constitutive self-renewal, thus obviating NEstem dependence
  on S1. Loss of Rb/p53 also sensitize NEstem to the dispersal and the deprogramming
  and reprogramming signals, so that even low-grade injury (e.g., cigarette smoke
  exposure) may provide enough S2 for dispersal and early metastasis, a hallmark of
  SCLC. Low-grade injury may also provide enough S3 and S4 to induce NE deprogramming
  and reprogramming, explaining why many SCLC tumors acquire Notch receptor loss-of-function
  mutations that would prevent such reprogramming to less malignant cell fates.
