caption: Cancer cells express a2V on the surface and secrete a2NTD in the released
  microvesicles. a2NTD activates NF-κB pathway in neutrophils that drives the synthesis
  and secretion of increased levels of IL-8 by neutrophils. Secreted IL-8 acts in
  an autocrine manner by binding to CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 on neutrophil. These are associated
  with actin polymerization, increased Mac-1expression and activation as well as FAK
  and Src activation. Together a2NTD treatment leads to promoted neutrophil migration
  suggesting a2NTD as a potential neutrophil chemo-attractant in tumor site.
