caption: A, Organization of SNX27 into its three major protein binding domains. B.
  Structure of retromer and WASH complexes that are involved in endosomal trafficking.
  The retromer is composed of a cargo selection trimer (CST composed of Vps 35, 29
  and 26) and BAR dimers. The retromer is recruited to endosomes via PtdIns(3)P-binders
  such as the GTPase Rab7a, and sorting nexin-3 (SNX-3). CST interacts with the WASH
  complex via the C-tail of FAM21 that also binds to SNX27 and FKBP15 to mediate endosome
  to plasma membrane trafficking. C, The SNX27 interactome. PBM-containing cargo binds
  to the PDZ of SNX27; while the PX and FERM domains of SNX27 are involved in recruiting
  SNX27 to endosomes and to the WASH complex respectively. In addition, a domain in
  SNX27 between 66-76 binds to Vps26 of the retromer. Adapted from []. D. Domain organization
  of FKBP15. E. Schematic of GPCR trafficking in endosomes. Activation of membranous
  ß1-AR promotes their internalization into early endosomes (red arrows). The type-1
  PBM of the ß1-AR (blue) binds to the PDZ of SNX27 (green). SNX27 directs PBM containing
  cargoes into tubules that utilize actin/retromer/WASH complexes (termed ASRT) for
  budding out of early endosomes. This mode of trafficking is mediated by the PBM
  “barcode” and is sufficient to guide most GPCR out of early endosomes. However,
  tubulation and budding of WT ß1-AR out of endosomes required a second “barcode”,
  which was phospho-Ser312. This reversible “barcode” was imprinted by the ß1-adrenergic
  receptosome and is recognized by endosomal sorting proteins, such as FKBP15. Upon
  verifying its two barcodes, the ß1-AR is sorted from early endosomes into rab11
  containing recycling endosomes and then re-inserted into the plasma membrane (blue
  arrows). Inhibition of PKA or inactivation of either barcode leads to retention
  of these cargoes within the body of early endomes (orange rectangle), which eventually
  mature into late endosomes/lysosomes. ß1-AR constructs with recycling nonPDZ sequences
  (black cube) or with a Ser312 to aspartic acid mutation are sorted out of early
  endosomes in a retromer/WASH independent pathway (light green rectangle).
