caption: 'Potential chirality axes (A) and possible regulators of leftward polarity
  bias (B). (A) Schematic diagram of an unpolarized cell resting on a coverslip, showing
  three chirality axes. Axis 1 is the arrow drawn from the center of the nucleus through
  the centrosome, and axis 2 is the vertical axis, from coverslip to medium. Orthogonal
  to the first two axes, axis 3 is the predicted direction of polarity to be assumed
  by the cell after addition of uniform fMLP: the pseudopod will be on the left, and
  the uropod will be on the right. (B) The diagram presents postulated relations among
  regulatory molecules we speculate may be involved in executing the leftward polarity
  bias of dHL60 cells. Solid lines connecting elements in the pathway represent steps
  documented in regulation of polarity and centrosome orientation in astrocytes and
  neurons (–). Dotted arrows with question marks indicate speculative links between
  a proposed chiral template and possible target steps in the pathway.'
