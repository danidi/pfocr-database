caption: Systemic iron homeostasis. Trivalent iron is reduced by ferrireductases (DcytB)
  before its absorption through DMT1 in enterocytes. Once inside enterocytes iron
  binds with chaperones like PCBs. PCBs act like intracellular iron transporters that
  distribute this metal to ferritin depots and probably to FPN. FPN is the main exporter
  of iron out of cells. This action of FPN is helped by ferrioxidases (like Heph).
  After its export out of cells, iron is immediately bound to Tf. This complex circulates
  in plasma and finally binds with its target, which is TFR1. Systemic iron availability
  is controlled by hepcidin. Hepcidin is produced in hepatocytes in response to different
  stimuli. Iron-mediated pathways are the main factors that induce hepcidin expression.
  The most important pathways activate LSECs, which in turn produce BMP6. BMP6 acts
  in a paracrine manner through BMPR in hepatocytes. BMPR activates SMAD pathway,
  which induces hepcidin expression. Iron pathways induce hepcidin expression through
  membrane proteins, like TFR2 and HFE, as well. Inflammatory signals are also important
  upregulators of hepcidin by acting through JAK/STAT pathway. Negative control is
  realized through ERFE, which is produced from erythrocyte precursors. BMP6 bone
