caption: Apoptosis is executed in cells by two main pathways, the mitochondrial (intrinsic)
  and death receptor (extrinsic) pathways. The mitochondrial pathway is regulated
  by the Bcl-2 family proteins. Under apoptotic stress, the pro-apoptotic BH3-only
  proteins act by inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, thereby releasing the
  effector pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins from anti-apoptotic protein inhibition,
  and/or by directly activating Bax and Bak. Activated Bax and Bak then undergo conformational
  changes, which leads to their oligomerization and the subsequent mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP), followed by the release of apoptogenic factors
  such as cytochrome c to the cytosol. Cytochrome c then binds to Aapf1 and promotes
  generation of the caspase-activating platform apoptosome. This leads to caspas-9
  activation and the subsequent activation of the executer caspase-3/7, leading to
  apoptotic death. In the death receptor pathway, following ligand binding to cell
  membrane death receptors, the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is formed
  and caspase-8 is activated. Activated caspas-8 can promote cell death by directly
  activating caspase-3/7 or cleaving the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bid. The product
  of this cleavage, tBid, then converges to the mitochondrial pathway by activating
  Bax/Bak.
