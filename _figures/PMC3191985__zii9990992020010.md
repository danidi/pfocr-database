caption: Proposed model of MCP-1-mediated neutrophil recruitment to the lung during
  E. coli infection. E. coli induces MCP-1 through the MD-2 signaling pathway, which
  involves Toll-like receptors. MCP-1 in turn regulates neutrophil recruitment directly
  via chemotaxis and indirectly through neutrophil chemokines, such as KC, MIP-2,
  as well as the cytokine TNF-α.
