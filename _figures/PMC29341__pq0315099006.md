caption: Thrombin-induced platelet activation. Two pathways exist on the  platelet
  for activation by thrombin. The pathway described in this  article involves the
  initial cleavage of GP V from the GP Ib–IX–V  complex at low thrombin concentrations,
  resulting in a hyperresponsive  platelet. Occupancy of the binding site on GP Ibα
  by thrombin results  in a signaling response that leads to αΙΙbβ3 activation.  Additionally,
  thrombin can cleave the PARs on platelets, and this  cleavage will then also stimulate
  platelet aggregation.
