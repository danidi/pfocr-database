caption: 'Flow-mediated dilation involves the activation of extracellular structures,
  which stimulate the F-actin network and membrane-anchored complexes. Transmission
  of the signal to eNOS through activation of Akt and HSPs requires the presence of
  dystrophin and vimentin. Nevertheless their precise role remains to be elucidated.High
  flow-induced remodeling is made of a diameter increase involving a pathway shown
  with green arrows and of an arterial wall hypertrophy (red arrows). The increase
  in diameter requires the production of both NO and ROS followed by the activation
  of MMPs. Arterial wall hypertrophy results of the activation of RhoA and MAP kinases.CAV1:
  caveolin-1, eNOS: endothelial NO-synthase, MMPs: metalloproteases, FAK: focal adhesion
  kinase; HSPs: heat shock proteins; ECM: extracellular matrix; AT1/2R: angiotensin
  II type 1 or 2 receptor.'
