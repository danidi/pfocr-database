caption: The overlapping actions of metformin and rapamycin. Rapamycin acts by directly
  inhibiting mTOR and therefore translation regulation, which has a major influence
  of highly regulated processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy. Metformin
  acts indirectly on the mTOR pathway through inhibition of complex I and activation
  of AMPK signaling. Metformin also reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) via inhibitory
  action on complex I and NAD(P)H oxidase having an overall effect as a redox regulator.
  Downstream of metformin action, low level ROS can indirectly trigger signals for
  mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover of organelles and proteins via autophagy.
  Vice versa, maintenance of healthy mitochondrial networks involving autophagy and
  mitochondrial biogenesis further reduces build-up of damaging levels of ROS.
