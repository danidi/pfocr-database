caption: 'Proposed mechanism of CERS6-mediated resistance to chemotherapy via extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis. Left: FasL binds to Fas and recruits FADD to form DISC complex
  which activates caspase-8 to induce apoptosis upon drug treatment. Right: CERS6
  bound to Fas inhibits the formation of DISC complex and inhibits extrinsic apoptosis,
  and thus it inhibits downstream activation of apoptosis upon drug treatment, resulting
  in resistance'
