caption: The yellow ellipses represent fatty acid intermediates detected by fatty
  acid profiling. The blue rectangles represent enzymes that catalyze the reactions.
  Genes encoding the enzymes are listed in the neighboring blocks. Genes that were
  subjected to expression analysis are highlighted in red. The up-regulated and down-regulated
  transcriptional variations are marked by red and green arrows, respectively. Dashed
  arrows in the bypass pathways represent genes that were not identified in this study.
  ω-6 pathway is presented in the left dashed box, ω-3 pathway is present in the right
  dashed box and the bypass pathway is catalyzed by delta9 elongase and delta8 desaturase.
