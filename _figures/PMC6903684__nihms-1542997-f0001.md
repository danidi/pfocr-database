caption: 'A diagram of the TCA cycle showing its intermediates and energy sources.
  TCA is fed by the propionate pathway, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation (via acetyl-CoA)
  which all help to maintain TCA intermediates. The propionate pathway is characterized
  by production of propionyl-CoA and is involved in metabolism of cholesterol, valine,
  odd chain fatty acids, methionine, isoleucine and threonine (c-VOMIT). Mut is the
  last step in the propionate pathway and feeds succinyl-CoA into the TCA cycle. Here,
  the intermediates and enzymes of interest (boxed and capitalized) are listed. Two
  known “toxins”, 2-methylcitrate and 3-hydroxypropionate are also illustrated. Abbreviations:
  CS (citrate synthase), aconitase 2 (ACO2), isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3 (IDH2/3),
  2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc), succinate synthase (SS), succinyl-CoA
  synthetase (SCS), methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC),
  c-VOMIT (cholesterol, valine, odd chain fatty acids, methionine, isoleucine, threonine),
  succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarate hydratase (FH), malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2),
  2-methycitrate (2-MC), 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-OH PA)'
