caption: (a) Biochemical cycle of myosin, showing the conformation of the head domain
  that corresponds to each chemical state. M labels the point of attachment of the
  head to the thick filament and A labels the binding site on the thin filament. Because
  of the fast reactions, only the three states boxed in white are populated to a significant
  degree. Note that there are variations of this reaction scheme that do not substantially
  change the model; e.g., the binding rate could be limited by the rate at which M⋅ADP⋅Pi
  is created by hydrolysis of M⋅ATP. (b) Because of the linear elastic element in
  the myosin neck, the free energy of attached states varies quadratically with the
  displacement x of A relative to M (the elastic strain of A·M·ADP⋅Pi is taken to
  be zero at x = 0). The gray arrows indicate the typical reaction pathway of a myosin
  molecule when the thin filament is propelled by an ensemble of motor proteins.
