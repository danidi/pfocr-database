caption: Schematic representation of a potential mechanism of IFN-γ- and STAT3-dependent
  cell growth modulated by TSC2/mTOR signaling pathway. Top, in normal unstimulated
  cells, tumor suppressor TSC2 inhibits mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway and cell proliferation.
  Treatment with IFN-γ activates canonical STAT1 signaling, induces modest phosphorylation
  of STAT3, and attenuates cell proliferation. Bottom, loss of TSC2 function leads
  to the constitutive activation of mTOR/S6K1 and increased STAT3 activity, which
  are both required for abnormal cell proliferation. IFN-γ induces STAT1 activation
  and increases STAT3 phosphorylation. Re-expression of TSC2 or inhibition of mTOR
  activity inhibits IFN-γ-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation and synergizes with IFN-γ
  in inhibition of cell proliferation.
