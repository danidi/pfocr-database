caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of hepatocyte apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway
  is activated by death receptors. Fas or TRAIL (depicted here) bind to their cognate
  receptors, leading to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC),
  with caspase 8 activation, Bid cleavage, and subsequent mitochondrial permeabilization.
  Bim activation can also occur downstream of death receptor signaling, leading to
  Bax activation and mitochondrial permeabilization. The TNF-α signaling pathway also
  leads to Bid cleavage with lysosomal permeabilization, leading to release of lysosomal
  contents and mitochondrial permeabilization. The intrinsic pathway of cell death
  can be initiated by myriad intracellular stressors that can activate the ER stress
  pathway, lysosomal permeabilization, or JNK activation. These cascades lead to inhibition
  of the antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Bcl-2) and activation of the proapoptotic
  proteins (Bax, Bim, Bad, Bid). Mitochondrial permeabilization occurs eventually
  and is required for hepatocyte apoptosis.
