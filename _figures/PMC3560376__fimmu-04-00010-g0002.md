caption: Schematic representation of the TLR9-Notch ligand (dll4) on Mycobacterium-dependent
  granuloma formation. Myeloid DCs (mDCs) play an important role in inducing the differentiation
  of Th17 cells through the TLR9 effector pathway that upregulates the Notch ligand
  dll4. In vivo granuloma formation induced by BCG/Mycobacterium Ag demonstrates larger
  granuloma formation in TLR9-knockout mice (TLR9−/−) with decreased numbers of Th17
  cells (CCR6+) and mDCs in the lungs when compared with lung granulomas from WT mice.
  Further, TLR9−/− mice showed an increase in IL-10 with a concomitant decrease in
  Th17 cell-related cytokines (IL-17, IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and TNF-α) and a decrease
  in the levels of the chemokines CCL20 and CCL22, important for DC migration, compared
  with levels in WT mice. The decreased expression of dll4 and the perturbation of
  the indicated cytokine and chemokine expression levels led to the abrogation of
  the Th17 phenotype in the Anti-Dll4 Ab treated mice with the concomitant increase
  in granuloma size. Accompanying these phenomena, there was a decrease in Th17 cells
  and mDCs in the lungs of Anti-Dll4 Ab treated mice and an increase in lung macrophages.
