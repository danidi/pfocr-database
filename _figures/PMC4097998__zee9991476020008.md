caption: A GC-oocyte communication pathway postulated to promote oocyte viability
  in postpubertal ovaries after the first ovulation. According to this model, oocytes
  before puberty only express NTRK2.T1 receptors; they might, however, express KISS1R.
  BDNF and kisspeptin (Kp) production by GCs is increased by the preovulatory surge
  of gonadotropins; each ligand then binds to its respective receptor expressed in
  oocytes (NTKR2.T1 and KISS1R, respectively) to induce the formation of full-length
  catalytically active NTRK2 receptors (NTKR2.FL) in oocytes. Upon ligand-dependent
  activation NTRK2 receptors set in motion a PI3K-AKT-mediated survival pathway that
  maintains oocyte viability and ensures recurrent follicular development. In the
  absence of NTRK2.FL this does not occur, oocytes die and follicles disintegrate
  surrounded by an abnormal expanded interstitial tissue composed of steroidogenically
  active, luteal-like cells.
