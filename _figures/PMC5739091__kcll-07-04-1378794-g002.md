caption: Rag GTPase-independent amino acid signaling pathway upstream of mTORC1. (A)
  Current model of mTORC1 activation by glutamine independently of Rag GTPases. v-ATPase
  is required for mTORC1 activity. The cycling of GTP-bound and GDP-bound Arf1 facilitates
  mTORC1 lysosomal localization and activation by glutamine. Positive regulators of
  mTORC1 are indicated in green. (B) Current model of Gtr1-independent TORC1 activation
  by glutamine. Pib2, Vsp34, and Vsp15 are required for TORC1 activation. Positive
  regulators of mTORC1 and TORC1 are indicated in green.
