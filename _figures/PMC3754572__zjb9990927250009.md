caption: Pyruvate overflow pathway through branched-chain amino acid metabolism. The
  metabolism of carbohydrates leads to the generation of pyruvate, which results in
  the generation of lactic acid, the major acidic end product responsible for tooth
  demineralization and caries formation. Pyruvate can be rerouted to the synthesis
  of branched-chain amino acids by the action of the ilv biosynthetic pathway. CcpA
  aids in the activation of ilv when cells are exposed to an acidic environment. Branched-chain
  amino acids, in turn, are important molecules for genetic regulation via their role
  as coeffectors for CodY transcriptional regulation. As branched-chain amino acid
  synthesis increases, CodY-dependent repression of the ilv genes also increases,
  resulting in repression of these gene transcripts when bcAAs are in excess.
