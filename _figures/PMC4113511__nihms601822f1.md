caption: In the absence of Shh, Ptch 1 suppresses signaling by smoothened (Smoh).
  Binding of Shh to Ptch 1 relieves this inhibition. Activation of Smoh leads to the
  activation and translocation of transcription factors of the Gli family into the
  nucleus, with subsequent changes in gene expression.
