caption: Distinct ephrin-mediated reverse signaling in dendrites. Ephrin-A molecules
  are able to interact with TrkB receptors in neurons and promote synapse formation.
  Ephrin-B molecules transduce reverse signals to mediate both dendrite pruning and
  spinogenesis. Exuberant dendritic processes are pruned by ephrin-B reverse signal
  transduction through interacting with Grb4 via SH2 binding motif and syntenin via
  PDZ binding motif, respectively. Spine maturation and synapse formation, on the
  other hand, require the participation of Grb4/GIT1 pathway, Pick1/syntenin/GRIP
  PDZ binding interactions, and ERK1/2 cascade.
