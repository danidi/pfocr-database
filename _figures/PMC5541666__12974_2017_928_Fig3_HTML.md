caption: 'Systematic analysis of key factors in the mitochondria-associated innate
  immunity pathway, using acute starvation of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to
  reveal the transcriptional regulation of stress responses and their dependence on
  PINK1. Transcript levels were documented in control non-target knock-down (NT-KD)
  versus PINK1-knock-down (PINK1-KD) cells for the following inflammatory factors.
  a Summary scheme on the detection of pathogen DNA/RNA in the cytosol and the mitochondria-associated
  triggering of innate immunity, as altered during starvation by PINK1. Viral RNA
  (ssRNA or dsRNA) is recognized in the cytosol by helicase RIG-I and MDA5. This triggers
  the dimerization of MAVS in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) which recruits
  transactivators (such as TRADD, TRAF, IKK family) leading to nuclear translocation
  of phosphorylated IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB and promoting the transcription of IFN stimulated
  genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Effector molecules such as IFIT1,
  IFIT2, IFIT3, and RSAD2 (viperin) inhibit virus DNA/RNA replication. IFIT3 also
  functions as a scaffold to facilitate interaction between MAVS and TBK1 and represents
  a positive feedback of DDX58 (RIG-I) signaling through MAVS. Low ΔΨm or decreased
  ROS inhibit MAVS-mediated signaling. Mitochondria cooperate with the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to regulate lipid synthesis and antiviral signaling at the mitochondria-associated
  membranes (MAM), possibly by interactions of MAVS/MFN1 with TMEM173 (STING). MFN1
  leads to the redistribution of MAVS along mitochondria and a fusion of the mitochondrial
  network that promotes the interaction between MAVS and STING. Low energy induces
  the localization of PINK1 to the OMM and recruitment of PARKIN from the cytosol,
  which is the signal for dysfunctional mitochondria to be digested in the autophagosome.
