caption: The cytokine storm and stress can increase gut dysbiosis/permeability, further
  contributing to cytokine induced IDO and TDO, leading to kynurenine and kynurenic
  acid, which activate the AhR to increase CYP1B1 and regulate the NAS/Melatonin ratio.
  Other factors, including CYP2C19, mGluR5, P2Y1, and O‐demethylation can also regulate
  the NAS/melatonin ratio. The miRNAs, miR‐7, miR‐375, and miR‐451 are increased following
  many viral infections, thereby suppressing 14‐3‐3 and the stabilization of AANAT,
  leading to melatonergic pathway inhibition. The suppression of melatonin, including
  from an increase in the NAS/melatonin ratio, attenuates melatonin's induction of
  Bmal1 and therefore the circadian regulation of mitochondria. Bmal1 induces PDC,
  leading to an increase in OXPHOS, the TCA cycle and the acetyl‐CoA that is a necessary
  co‐substrate for AANAT and melatonergic pathway activation. The decrease in pineal
  and mitochondrial melatonin contributes to an increase in the replication and severity
  of many viral infections. The arrows indicate “stimulation”, with a crossed‐line
  indicating “inhibitory”
