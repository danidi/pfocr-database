caption: The biogenesis and function of microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are initially transcribed
  by RNA polymerase II or III as pri-miRNAs, which are processed into pre-miRNAs in
  the nucleus by Drosha-DGCR8. Precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) can also be generated
  via the mirtron pathway. The products of pri-miRNA cleavage, the pre-miRNAs, are
  exported to the cytoplasm through exportin-5 and then cleaved in a complex comprising
  Dicer and transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP) or adenosine deaminase
  acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). The functional strand of a mature miRNA is incorporated
  into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains GW182 and AGO proteins.
  As a part of this complex, the mature miRNA modulates gene expression by binding
  to partially complementary sequences in the 3'UTRs or 5'UTRs of target mRNAs, leading
  to mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, or transcriptional activation.
