caption: Co-incubation of macrophages with melanoma cells leads to increased ARG-1
  expression and, inversely, decreased iNOS expression. This is associated with increased
  expression of M2-related cytokines and, inversely, decreased expression of M1-related
  cytokines as well as TCD8+ response, leading to increased tumor growth. Whereas
  blocking TGF-β1 with an anti-TGF-β neutralizing antibody abolished macrophage polarization
  towards an M2 phenotype, antagonism of S1PR1 inhibited macrophage migration induced
  by S1P.
