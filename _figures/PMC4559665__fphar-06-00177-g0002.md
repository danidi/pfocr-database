caption: Feed-back and feed-forward control of cAMP by the ubiquitin-proteasome system
  (UPS). In the burst phase, ubiquitylation of cAMP-phosphodiesterases (PDEs) through
  the E3 ligase SCF complex contributes to modulate cAMP levels (). R subunits undergo
  to proteolysis by the praja2-UPS pathway. Loss of R subunits sustains PKA signaling
  (). Moreover, ubiquitylation of protein phosphatases (PPs) by cullin E3 ligases
  (CRL3s) further modulates phosphorylation-dependent downstream signaling (). During
  the desensitization phase, agonist-induced ubiquitylation of both receptor and b-arrestins
  promotes receptor endocytosis and degradation, attenuating downstream signaling
  (). Gαs subunits are ubiquitylated and degraded by the UPS (). During hypoxia, Siah2-mediated
  ubiquitylation and proteolysis of AKAP121 modulates mitochondrial activity ().
