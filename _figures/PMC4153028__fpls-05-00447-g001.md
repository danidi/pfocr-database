caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the synthesis of the amino acids of the Asp-family
  pathway and their catabolism by the TCA cycle. The mitochondrial enzymatic complex
  is highlighted by a black box. Abbreviations: 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; ASD, aspartic
  semialdehyde dehydrogenase; CGS, cystathionine gamma synthase; D2HGDH, 2-D-hydroxyglutarate
  dehydrogenase; DHDP, dihydrodipicolinate; DHDPS, dihydrodipicolinate synthase; IVDH,
  isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase; LKR/SDH, lysine ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine
  dehydrogenase; OPH, O- phospho_L_homoserine; TS, Thr synthase. Arrows with two crossed
  lines represent several enzymatic reactions.'
