caption: The frequency of the main somatic genetic defects in papillary, poorly differentiated,
  and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is shown, based on the largest published series
  studied by next−generation sequencing., Because anaplastic thyroid carcinomas are
  extensively infiltrated by tumor−associated macrophages, deep sequencing is required
  to make reliable mutation calls. The prevalence of driver mutations (BRAF, RAS,
  and RET) in the histologic types of the three tumors is shown. In patients with
  advanced disease, tumors may have more than one mutation, so the overall mutation
  burden exceeds 100%. The frequency of the main drivers (BRAF, RAS, and RET) sums
  to less than 100% because in some cases the drivers are not known or they are lower−frequency
  events and are not listed here (e.g., NF1, PTEN). TERT promoter mutations appear
  to be key transitional steps in the microevolution of tumors. In papillary thyroid
  carcinoma, the TERT mutations are infrequent (in 10% of tumors) and usually subclonal.
  By contrast, their prevalence is substantially higher in poorly differentiated and
  anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, in which they are uniformly clonal. Mutations in
  TP53 are infrequent in all histologic types of thyroid cancer with the exception
  of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, in which they occur in more than 70% of patients.
  Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas have mutations in genes encoding components of the
  PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway and of proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, whereas
  poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas have an intermediate frequency of these
  events (data not shown). Mutations of EIF1AX, a component of the translation preinitiation
  complex, are infrequent and are mutually exclusive with other driver mutations in
  papillary thyroid cancer. In poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers,
  they are markedly enriched and are strongly associated with RAS−mutated tumors.
