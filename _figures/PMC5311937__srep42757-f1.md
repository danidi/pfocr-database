caption: '(A) In the general model for metabolosome function (2, 3), the signature
  enzymes are involved in the formation of the aldehyde, which is subsequently oxidized
  to an acyl-CoA thioester by an acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (AldDH), or reduced
  to an alcohol by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The acyl-CoA is then further converted
  to an acyl-phosphate by a phosphotransacylase (PTA) and finally to the free carboxylic
  acid by a kinase (AcK), generating ATP. The NAD+ and CoA required for the AldDH
  reaction are regenerated within the BMC by the ADH and PTA, respectively. (B) Specific
  enzymes encapsulated in GRM3: The GRE-type 1,2-propanediol dehydratase and its activating
  enzyme (dark and light purple, respectively) represent the signature enzymes. Encapsulation
  peptides are depicted as small beige cylinders. The GRM gene cluster of Rps. palustris
  is shown below. Genes encoding for enzymes that are involved in the encapsulated
  metabolic pathway are annotated and colored: aldehyde dehydrogenase (PduP), phosphotransacylase
  (PduL). Genes encoding different types of shell proteins are colored in dark blue,
  light blue, and yellow. Ancillary genes encoding proteins and enzymes that are not
  directly involved in the GRM metabolic pathway are white.'
