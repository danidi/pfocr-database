caption: Schematic diagram of the roles of miR-21 and the PDCD4/c-Jun signalling pathway
  in renal cell carcinoma. The overexpression of miR-21 and the reduced PDCD4 expression,
  leading to the activation of c-Jun, further increased the levels of MMP2, MMP9,
  ANG-1 and VEGFA, which promoted tumour cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis.
  PDCD4, programmed cell death protein 4; miR, microRNA; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
