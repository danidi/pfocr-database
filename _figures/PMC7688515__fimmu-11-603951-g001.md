caption: Immunometabolic pathway during mycobacterial infection. Mtb intervene in
  host cell lipid metabolism for its own intracellular survival. During the metabolic
  reprogramming process, innate immune responses are induced to regulate the host
  defense system. For example, Mtb infection in macrophages restricts aerobic glycolysis
  and IL-1β production through upregulation of miR-21. Moreover, Mtb utilizes lipid
  synthesis and FAO process to obtain energy and building blocks for membrane synthesis.
  Inhibition of FAO leads to the enhancement of mitoROS, which promote xenophagy in
  macrophages infected with Mtb. However, there are also controversial results that
  FAO is promoted by PPAR-α, which mediates anti-mycobacterial immune defense through
  lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy activation, via TFEB. The elevation of oxLDL
  promotes the macrophage lysosomal dysfunction, which contributes to impaired control
  of intracellular Mtb and host defense. Simvastatin, an oral HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor,
  decreases plasma cholesterol levels and exhibits host protection against Mtb through
  autophagy induction in monocytes.
