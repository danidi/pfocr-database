caption: Proposed mechanism of action of PPARγ ligands and p38 MAPK on transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β1–induced β-catenin signaling in corneal fibroblasts. The left
  side of the panel illustrates a hypothetical resting state, where cytoplasmic levels
  of β-catenin are low because β-catenin exists primarily in its phosphorylated form.
  Phosphorylated (p) β-catenin is associated with a multiprotein complex that includes
  GSK3α/β, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), Axin, and casein kinase (CK) 1, and is
  readily degraded via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. TGF-β1 stimulation of TGF-β
  receptor I/II (TGFRI/TGFRII) complexes and/or stimulation of Wnt receptors, such
  as Frizzle (Fz) and lipoprotein receptor–related proteins (LRPs), both activate
  the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which appears to be a key regulator
  of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen 1 (COL1), and fibronectin (FN) synthesis.
  In the case of TGF-β1 stimulation, this appears to depend on phosphorylation of
  p38 MAPK, which induces phosphorylation of GSK3β, which prevents phosphorylation
  of β-catenin. This active (un-phosphorylated) β-catenin is able to travel into the
  nucleus and stimulate synthesis of profibrotic molecules (α-SMA, COL1, and FN).
  PPARγ ligands (red) inhibit TGF-β1–induced p38 MAPK activity, which blocks phosphorylation
  of GSK3β, decreasing levels of active (un-phosphorylated) β-catenin, and by consequence,
  blocking increased synthesis of α-SMA, COL1, and FN. cat, catenin.
