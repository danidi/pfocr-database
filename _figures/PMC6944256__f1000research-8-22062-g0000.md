caption: ( A) A typical phosphotransfer pathway, as is usually found in prokaryotes.
  The perception of a stimulus by extracytoplasmic domains of the histidine kinase
  (HK) regulates its activities. The HK autophosphorylates at a conserved histidine
  residue (H) using ATP bound to the catalytic ATPase domain (containing conserved
  motifs N, G1, F, and G2). The phosphoryl group (P) is transferred to a conserved
  aspartate residue (D) located within the cognate response regulator (RR). ( B) An
  example of a multi-step phosphorelay, as often occurs in eukaryotes. The HK is termed
  “hybrid” because an additional aspartate-containing domain is fused to the ATPase
  domain. The phosphorelay involves multiple phosphoryl transfer steps. The first
  is an intramolecular transfer between the conserved histidine (H) and a conserved
  aspartate residue (D) located within the C terminus of the sensor HK. Subsequently,
  the phosphoryl group is transferred to a histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein
  and finally to a cognate RR. Conserved domains of the two-component system (TCS)
  proteins are shown in green, gold, and blue. Variable sensor domains of the HK and
  effector domains (Ef) of the RR that adapt the systems to a wide range of input
  stimuli and output responses are shown in gray.
