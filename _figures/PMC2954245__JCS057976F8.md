caption: Molecular mechanisms of apical extrusion of Src cells. In Src cells that
  are surrounded by normal cells, activity of myosin-II and FAK is increased, leading
  to activation of the downstream MAPK pathway. Activity of myosin-II, FAK and MAPK
  is involved in apical extrusion of Src cells. In addition, E-cadherin-based cell-cell
  adhesions are basally relocalized in a myosin-II- and FAK-dependent manner. N, nucleus.
