caption: 'Working Model to explain the role of LODIS on the regulation of Fe acquisition
  genes. Once inside roots, Fe is translocated to leaves through the xylem, bound
  to citrate (provided by the FRD3 transporter). In shoots, some Fe (either as free
  ions or in chelated form) can enter the phloem through the OPT3 transporter, and
  moves back to roots bound to a chelating agent (forming LODIS). In roots, LODIS
  could negatively affect ethylene synthesis and signaling, and GSNOR expression and/or
  activity, which can lead to enhanced GSNO. Besides LODIS, which would act as a repressor
  of Fe responses, some other shoot signals, like sucrose and auxin, would act as
  activators of Fe responses through NO (). The possible relationship of ethylene,
  NO, GSH, GSNOR, and GSNO is depicted in more detail in Figure . In green are components
  whose expression, activity and/or content is known to increase under Fe deficiency
  while in red are components whose expression, activity, and/or content is known
  to increase under Fe sufficiency. chel, chelating agent; GSH, glutathione; GSNO,
