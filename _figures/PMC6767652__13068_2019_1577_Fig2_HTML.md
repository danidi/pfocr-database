caption: Cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis pathways described in literature. a ATP-citrate
  lyase (ACL) cleaves citrate into its constituent components oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA
  at the expense of one ATP. b Pyruvate-Acetaldehyde-Acetate (PAA) pathway that converts
  pyruvate into acetyl-CoA by action of PdcA, AldA and AcuA. This pathway is directly
  repressed at the transcriptional level by CreA. c Carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT)
  system that consists of mitochondrial and peroxisomal carnitine acetyltransferase
  AcuJ or cytosolic FacC that catalyzes the reversible reaction of acetyl-CoA into
  acetylcarnitine. Acetylcarnitine in turn can be transported to and from the mitochondrion
  by carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (AcuH) or by a yet unknown translocase from
  the peroxisome
