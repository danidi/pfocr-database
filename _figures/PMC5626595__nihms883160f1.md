caption: 'Upon recognition of viral RNA, RIG-I and MDA5 undergo a conformational change
  that triggers their interaction with the adaptor protein MAVS. This in turn induces
  a signaling cascade that results in IRF3 and NF-kB activation and type I IFN induction
  (IFN-I) (A). Secreted IFN-I then functions in an autocrine and paracrine fashion
  leading to the activation of an antiviral state (B). Flaviviruses are able to counteract
  the induction of type I IFN both in a passive and active fashion. The former functions
  by hiding flavivirus RNA from PRRs sensing, i.e. by sequestrating dsRNA replication
  intermediates at the RCs. The later takes place by several mechanisms, unique among
  different viruses: sfRNAs prevent USP15-mediated deubiquitination of TRIM25, and
  subsequent RIG-I activation; the NS3 protein of WNV competes with RIG-I for binding
  to the chaperone 14-3-3ε; the NS4A protein of DENV sequesters MAVS to block downstream
  signaling events; the structural E protein of WNV inhibits RIP-1 polyubiquitination
  and blocks the activation of NF-kB signaling. Moreover, DENV infection triggers
  the release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic mtDNA then binds to cGAS and
  activates downstream signaling. DENV is able to antagonize the DNA sensing pathway
  in two ways: the viral protease NS2B3 cleaves STING, and the NS2B protein promotes
  the degradation of cGAS by an autophagy-lysosome dependent mechanism. Additionally,
  several nonstructural proteins of both DENV (NS2B3, NS2B, NS2A, NS4A) and WNV (NS4B)
  have been shown to block the kinases IKKε and TBK-1, that are responsible for IRF3
  activation and translocation into the nucleus.'
