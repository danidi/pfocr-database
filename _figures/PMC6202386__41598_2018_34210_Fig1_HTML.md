caption: Biosynthetic pathway for protopanaxadiol (PPD) production in metabolically
  engineered S. cerevisiae. Exogenous plant genes, PgDS, PgPPDS, and AtCPR1, were
  introduced to construct the biosynthetic pathway for PPD synthesis. The native yeast
  pathways for farnesol (FOH) production by LPP1 and DPP1 were deleted with the overexpression
  of tHMG1 and ERG20 for enhancement of the precursor supply. Genetic targets identified
  for improvement of NADPH availability were manipulated to increase the production
  of PPD. Single arrows represent one-step enzymatic conversions, while triple arrows
  represent multiple reactions. Bold arrows represent overexpressed genes. Dashed
  arrows represent deleted reactions.
