caption: Cellular ganglioside metabolism and structure of GD2. (A). Cellular synthesis
  of the ganglioside GD2 starts with the synthesis of the lipid ceramide at the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). Transported to the Golgi apparatus (Golgi), it is converted by the
  glucosylceramide synthase (UGCG, 1) and subsequently luminal acting glycosyltransferases
  (2) into GD2 before it reaches the plasma membrane (PM) by vesicular transport from
  the trans Golgi network (TGN). Exposed to the outer leaflet of the PM, it may facilitate
  cell–cell contacts or modulate laterally the activity of plasma membrane proteins.
  Concentration of GD2 at the PM is further regulated by endocytic uptake of GD2,
  transport to early endosomes (EE), and stepwise lysosomal degradation into its sugar
  building blocks, free fatty acids, and sphingosine (3). The latter can be used again
  by the salvage pathway for production of ceramide at the ER. (B). Chemical structure
  of the ganglioside GD2 showing its lipophilic ceramide anchor, which is composed
  of a sphingoid base (blue) and a fatty acid (red), and the polar glycan head group.
  The latter is composed of a neutral core trisaccharide containing a terminal N-acetyl
  galactosamine (GalNAc) linked to a galactose (Gal), which is bound to the ceramide
  connected glucose (Glc). This trisaccharide is extended by two N-acetyl neuraminic
  acids (NeuNAc) attached to the galactosyl residue. (C). Combinatorial biosynthesis
  of gangliosides including GD2 (on green background) begins with the condensation
  of UDP-glucose and ceramide (Cer) to form glucosylceramide (GlcCer). This step is
  catalyzed by the glucosylceramide synthase (UGCG), which is inhibited by the small
  molecular compounds Eliglustat and Miglustat. By further glycosyl transferases (B4GALT5/6,
  ST3GAL5, ST8SIA1, and ST8SIA3/5) GlcCer is converted to lactosylceramide (LacCer)
  and the gangliosides GM3, GD3, and GT3, all of which are substrates for the GalNAc
  transferase B4GALNT1, leading to more complex structures GA2, GM2, GD2, and GT2.
  The latter may then be glycosylated by the galactosyl transferase B3GALT4 to produce
  GA1, GM1a, GD1b, and GT1c. GM1a, GD1b, and GT1c as well as GD1a (not included into
  scheme) are the main gangliosides of the brain. Lysosomal degradation of gangliosides
  is a stepwise process leading finally again to GlcCer, which is cleaved by lysosomal
  glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Deficiency of GBA causes the lysosmal storage disease
  Gaucher’s Disease. Substrate deprivation therapy with Eliglustat or Miglustat by
  inhibiting UGCG is one possibility to treat Gaucher’s Disease.
