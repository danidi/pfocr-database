caption: 'Exogenous and endogenous genotoxic agents (top) generate a variety of DNA
  damage, such as single and double strand breaks (SSBs, DSBs), insertions and deletions
  (indels). Lesions are detected and repaired by four major DNA repair pathways: base
  excision repair (BER, A), nucleotide excision repair (NER, B), mismatch repair (MMR,
  C) and recombinational repair (D). Mechanisms of BER, NER and recombinational repair
  are depicted. For each pathway, factors discussed in this review are in colors.A.
  Removal of uracil from DNA by BER. Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) removes the nitrogenous
  base and generates an abasic site (*). Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease finalizes
  the nucleotide removal and creates a nick in the sugar-phosphate backbone. Poly
  ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) senses the SSB and recruits DNA polymerase and
  ligase to fill in the gap.B. Removal of large bulky adducts by NER. Transcribing
  RNA polymerase II (Pol II) stalls at DNA lesions and triggers transcription-coupled
  NER (TCR). TCR is initiated by the recruitment of Cockayne syndrome proteins A and
  B (CSA, CSB) to the arrested polymerase. DNA damage on the non-transcribed regions
  of the genome is repaired by global genome NER (GGR) instead. DNA lesion is recognized
  by the repair complex comprising Xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC), RAD23B and Centrin
  2 (CETN2). Completion of TCR and GGR requires the recruitment of downstream NER
  factors (XPA, RPA, TFIIH, ERCC1-XPF, XPG). ERCC1-XPF and XPG endonucleases incise
  the damaged strand a few bases 5′ and 3′ to the DNA lesion, respectively. The gap
  is filled in by DNA polymerase and sealed by ligase.D. Removal of DSBs and inter-strand
  cross-links (ICL) by recombinational repair. 1. Repair of DSBs by non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ). DSB sites are marked by Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
  kinase-mediated phosphorylation of histone H2A variant X (γ-H2AX) (). Ku proteins
  direct the binding of the catalytic subunits of the DNA-dependent protein kinase
  (DNA-PKcs) to the exposed DNA ends. Autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs facilitates
  DNA-ends processing and resealing.2. Repair of ICLs by Fanconi Anemia (FA), homologous
  recombination (HR) and NER pathways (see review ()). During S-phase, converging
  replication forks stall at ICLs and are sensed by FANCM protein, which recruits
  downstream FA proteins (FA core) and initiates ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related)-CHK1
  checkpoint response. The FA core complex ubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI. This facilitates
  the recruitment of endonucleases (SLX4, XPF/ERCC1, MUS81/EME1) and resection of
  the lesion from one of the two cross-linked strands. Translesion DNA synthesis proceeds
  through the uncut strand, generating the template for the homologous recombination
  machinery (MRN, BRCA2, RAD51) to complete DNA replication across the nicked DNA
  strand. NER removes the remaining adducts.'
