caption: A model of FGFR4-mediated metabolic regulations. FGFR4 regulates bile acid
  synthesis by suppressing expression of Cyp7a1, the bile acid-producing enzyme in
  liver. In FGFR4 KO, increased basal bile acid synthesis triggered up-regulation
  of FGF21 in liver and FGF19/FGF15 in ileum. Adiponectin is also increased in the
  adipose tissue. The endocrine factors together contribute to the improvements in
  glucose response, insulin sensitivity, and body weight. The FGF19/FGF15 pathway
  is probably the main contributor to these metabolic changes as depicted by thicker
  lines.
