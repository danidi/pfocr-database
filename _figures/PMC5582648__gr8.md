caption: Schematic diagram of PKR signaling pathways that are activated by inflammatory
  stimulation. Phosphorylation of PKC by PKR activation induces the cytosolic complex
  (such as p47 and Rac1) to translocate to the membrane and associate with the integral
  membrane components, resulting in activation of NOX1 followed by accumulation of
  reactive oxidase species (superoxide) and down-regulation of antioxidant enzymes
  activity (SOD and catalase). Subsequently, the up-regulated oxidative stress triggers
  the ERK pathway which leads to enhanced inflammatory responses (increased COX-2
  and IL-8) via NF-κB. In addition, the activated ERK hinder the inhibition of PPAR-γ
  to MMP-13, allowing MMP-13-mediated ECM degradation/remodeling.
