caption: The IGF1R-IR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and its manipulation through diet. Elevations
  in blood glucose concentrations lead to secretion of insulin with subsequent elevation
  of free IGF1. Binding of insulin and IGF1 to their receptor tyrosine kinases induces
  autophosphorylation of the latter which leads to subsequent activation of PI3K by
  one of at least three different pathways []. Further downstream, PI3K signaling
  causes phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known
  as protein kinase B). Akt activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which
  itself induces aerobic glycolysis by up-regulating key glycolytic enzymes, in particular
  via its downstream effectors c-Myc and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α. mTOR is
  negatively affected through activation of AMPK, which can be achieved by dietary
  restriction []. In addition, a possible negative interaction between insulin and
  AMPK is discussed in vivo [].

  description: The IGF1R-IR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and its manipulation through diet.
    Elevations in blood glucose concentrations lead to secretion of insulin with subsequent
    elevation of free IGF1. Binding of insulin and IGF1 to their receptor tyrosine
    kinases induces autophosphorylation of the latter which leads to subsequent activation
    of PI3K by one of at least three different pathways []. Further downstream, PI3K
    signaling causes phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine kinase
    Akt (also known as protein kinase B). Akt activates mammalian target of rapamycin
    (mTOR), which itself induces aerobic glycolysis by up-regulating key glycolytic
    enzymes, in particular via its downstream effectors c-Myc and hypoxia inducible
    factor (HIF)-1α. mTOR is negatively affected through activation of AMPK, which
    can be achieved by dietary restriction []. In addition, a possible negative interaction
    between insulin and AMPK is discussed in vivo [].
