caption: (a) Metabolic pathway of nicotine in P. putida P-HSP was locally blocked
  (a, top). Enzymatic steps 1–5 are catalyzed by NicA2, nicotine oxido-reductase;
  Pnao, pseudooxynicotine amine oxidase; Sapd, DSP dehydrogenase; Spm, SP monoxygenase
  and HspB, respectively. The HSP monooxygenase activities of strain P. putida S16
  and P-HSP are shown in (a, bottom panels). The photographs (a, bottom panels) were
  taken in the lab by the first author Yu. (b) Construction and verification of engineered
  strain P-HSP.
