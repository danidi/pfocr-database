caption: Schematic representation of APP processing and role of its products in AD
  pathology. The proteolytic processing of the large, transmembrane, amyloid precursor
  protein (APP) occurs in two distinct amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways.
  The amyloidogenic pathway involves the sequential cleavage of APP by an aspartic
  proteinase, β-secretase, which releases a soluble ectodomain (sAPPβ) and the C-terminal
  fragment CTF99. This, in turn, is cleaved by another aspartic proteinase, γ-secretase,
  generating the transcriptional regulator APP intracellular domain (AICD), and releasing
  the 39–42 amino acid amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). Due to its very high ability to aggregation,
  Aβ forms dimers, trimers, and higher level oligomers which are toxic to cells and
  cause neuronal death. Formation of amyloid plaques from Aβ aggregates in complex
  with other proteins is a hallmark of AD but is considered as a scavenging process.
  In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP molecules are cleaved at the α-secretase site
  within the Aβ-domain releasing a soluble ectodomain sAPPα and the C-terminal fragment
  CTF83. Proteolytic cleavage of CTF83 by γ-secretase releases AICD and p3 fragment
  whose functions are still unknown. The AICD fragment produced in the amyloidogenic
  pathway binds to a stabilizing factor Fe65 and in a complex with other factors (the
  histone acetyl transferase, Tip60, and a Mediator complex subunit Med12) can act
  as transcription factor regulating expression of a variety of genes, including an
  Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin. This process was found to be specific to the neuronal
  APP695 isoform. AICD produced in the non-amyloidogenic pathway and from other APP
  isoforms (APP751 and APP770) is most likely to be degraded (e.g., by some intracellular
  proteases, e.g., insulin-degrading enzyme). Soluble APP ectodomains, sAPPα, and
  sAPPβ, have been shown to have neuroprotective properties.
