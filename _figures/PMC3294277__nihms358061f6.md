caption: Dual pathway for the activation of HSF1 by electrophiles. HSPs, specifically
  HSP90 and HSP72, are basally bound to HSF1. The primary pathway through which electrophiles
  promote activation of HSF1 involves the electrophilic adduction of nucleophilic
  residues in HSP90 and HSP72. This destabilizes the interaction of HSP72 and HSP90
  with HSF1. Free HSF1 becomes activated in a three-step process involving phosphorylation,
  trimerization, and nuclear translocation. The HSF1 homotrimer binds to specific
  heat shock elements (HSEs) to induce the expression of heat shock response genes,
  which include several HSP chaperones. A secondary pathway through which electrophiles
  may activate HSF1 is based on the hypothesis that protein electrophilic modifications
  increase superficial hydrophobicity, attracting HSPs and releasing HSF1.
