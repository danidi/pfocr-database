caption: Model for the roles of the RuvBL1-RuvBL2 complex in regulating the FA DNA
  repair pathway. The RuvBL1-RuvBL2 complex interacts with both PIKKs and the FA core
  complex to regulate their abundance (grey boxes). Interaction with the PIKKs is
  required for robust activation of the global DDR through regulation of ATM and ATR.
  RuvBL1-RuvBL2 binds to and controls the abundance of the FA core complex (independent
  of DNA damage), thereby mediating the ability of the FA core complex to monoubiquitinate
  the FANCI-FANCD2 heterodimer and to activate the FA DNA repair response to ICLs.
