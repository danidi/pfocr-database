caption: Proposed model for the I3C disruption of a cross-regulatory positive feedback
  loop involving expression of GATA3 and ERα by stimulating the degradation of ERα
  protein. In the absence of I3C, ERα and the GATA3 transcription factor maintain
  a cross-regulatory positive feedback loop that results in a high level of ERα expression.
  ERα stimulates GATA3 transcription by interacting with an enhancer region in the
  GATA3 gene, whereas GATA3 stimulates ERα promoter activity by interacting its corresponding
  binding sites in the ERα promoter. I3C disrupts this feedback loop by inducing the
  ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of ERα protein. The I3C-induced
  degradative pathway requires the Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and the I3C activation
  and nuclear localization of AhR. We propose that I3C-activated AhR tethers Rbx1
  to its ERα protein substrate for ubiquitination and subsequent destruction.
