number: Figure 5
caption: A. Venn diagram of up-regulated SAGE tags and corresponding IPA mapped IDs
  for the CIS and SCC datasets. (See  and  for description of up-regulated tags in
  the CIS and SCC datasets, respectively.) B. IPA pathway graphical representation
  for the CIS over BE_PC dataset (80 unique IDs displayed in green; 58 shared IDs
  displayed in gray), and the SCC over BE_PC dataset (112 unique IDs displayed in
  red; 58 shared IDs displayed in gray). Gene products are positioned according to
  subcellular localization. Only direct connections (i.e., direct physical contact
  between two molecules) among the individual gene products are shown for clarity
  of presentation; lines indicate protein-protein binding interactions, and arrows
  refer to “acts on” interactions such as proteolysis, expression, and protein-DNA/RNA
  interactions. Eleven genes were detected at levels 20-fold or greater in the CIS
  over BE_PC dataset relative to the invasive cancer dataset (indicated by dark green),
  and 10 genes were detected at levels 20-fold or greater in the SCC over BE_PC dataset
  relative to the CIS dataset (indicated by dark red).
