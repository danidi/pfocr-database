caption: ATP-requiring processes in the ECM. It is proposed that polyP in the ECM
  occurs as nano/microparticles that undergo hydrolytic cleavage via the ALP. In concert
  with the ADK, ATP (ADP, AMP) is synthesized that acts as a metabolic energy reservoir.
  In comparison, it is shown that ATP, exported from the cells, can act in the extracellular
  space as signal/ligand for purinergic receptors. During this reaction ATP is not
  used as metabolic fuel but activates purinergic receptor(s), P2X, P2Y, or adenosine
  receptors (AR). The ATP metabolizing systems in the ECM include the ECM kinases
  that control metabolic processes by phosphorylation of key molecules. ATP might
  also be required during peptidylprolyl cis–trans isomerase reactions. Surely, heat
  shock proteins (HSP), like clusterin, are also present in the ECM that are involved
  in the physiological folding of functional polymeric molecules. In addition, processes
  like sol to gel transitions during supramolecular polymer organization are critical
  organization principles in the ECM involving exergonic reactions. The transition
  processes during coacervation likewise follow an energy-favorable reaction pathway.
  Bone and cartilage formation in the extracellular space are prominent energy-requiring
  reactions. During bone mineralization Pi and ADP/ATP are generated by enzymatic
  hydrolysis of polyP via ALP. The released Pi is driving the transition of amorphous
  Ca-carbonate “bio-seeds”, initially formed during bone mineralization, to amorphous
  Ca-phosphate and the final deposition of hydroxyapatite.
