caption: The HA/CD44 signaling pathway leading to the malignant phenotype of cancer
  cells. HA binds to the CD44 receptor and promotes its association with NANOG and
  STAT3. NANOG binds to STAT3 and associates with the miR-21 promoter, resulting in
  miR-21 transcription, protein production and downregulation of PDCD4. Additionally,
  NANOG associated with CD44 translocates to the nucleus and, together with other
  transcriptional factors, activates genes related to self-renewal and the TIC phenotype.
  STAT3 associated with CD44, together with CyclinD1 and Survivin, activates genes
  associated with the survival of tumor cells.
