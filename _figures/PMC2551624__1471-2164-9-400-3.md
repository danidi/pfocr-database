caption: 'Putative gene function in ascorbate homeostasis and Al tolerance. Al tolerance-associated
  genes are represented by white numbers* in the dark blue boxes (numbers in black
  are other genes of the same type associated with Al stress). Genes associated with
  Al stress responses are in black boxes. Box 1) The normal process of cell wall loosening
  is promoted by the production of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) to break glycosidic linkages
  (sugar-sugar). The hydroxyl radicals are produced non-enzymatically by the Fenton
  chemistry in the presence of Cu2+, H2O2 and ascorbate which serves as electron donor
  (the three molecules are in grey boxes). In the apoplasm, ascorbate (ASC) is transformed
  to monodehydroascorbate (MDHA + e-) and a free electron is used to reduce the Cu2+
  to Cu+ (needed for the Fenton reaction). An ascorbate oxido-reductase (ASC ox-red),
  or other plasma membrane transporters may be involved in the regeneration of apoplasmic
  ASC. Cytoplasmic ASC and NADH are needed to maintain the level of ASC in both compartments.
  Al (red box) was shown to block a redox reaction (electron transfer) [] suggesting
  that it interferes either with the electron transfer from the cytoplasm to ASC (regeneration)

  ROS molecules that will cause oxidative stress and trigger a redox response and
  the induction of various genes. Box 2) A slower regeneration of ASC could lead to
  its degradation and to the accumulation of oxalate. The induction of oxalate oxidase
  can use this oxalate to maintain the production of H2O2 and support the Fenton reaction.
  If the apoplasmic ASC concentration decreases too much, H2O2 may not be used efficiently
  in the cell wall loosening process and will accumulate. This ROS can cause the oxidation
  of several targets including different cysteine-rich proteins associated with Al
  tolerance. GSTs associated with Al stress or tolerance can participate in the protection
  or repair of oxidized targets. Box 3) Mobilisation of phloem sugars and reduction

  gene regulation and stimulate alternative pathways to increase the availability
  of important metabolite precursors such as NADPH (in light grey) through the pentose-P
  pathway (G6P: Glucose-6 phosphate; G6PDH: glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase); and
  phosphate (F1,6BP, Fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase; PPi PFK: pyrophosphosphate dependent
  phosphofructokinase). Other alternative pathways are activated to maintain the Krebs
  cycle (PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase, AOX: alternative oxidase) and to stimulate malate
  production (PEPC: phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase; MDH: malate dehydrogenase).
  UDP-glucose can be used to generate ASC and NADH (arabinonolactone oxidase). Other
  genes such as ALMT1 or ABC transporters may be involved in Al chelation and transport
  to exclude Al. *: the numbers represent genes identified in this work; see Table
