caption: An extracellular soluble cue binds to a multi-protein complex that is comprised
  of transmembrane receptor proteins and associated Janus kinases. Upon ligand binding,
  the receptor changes conformation enabling the JAKs to phosphorylate STAT binding
  sites within the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. The STAT proteins then associate
  with the activated receptor complex and sub-sequently become phosphorylated by the
  JAKs, as indicated by the green dot. The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and
  migrate to the nucleus to initiate the transcription and translation of the corresponding
  STAT-responsive genes, which include cytokines that are released by the cell to
  help coordinate cellular response. STAT proteins become deactivated following dephosphorylation
  by a number of different phosphatases, including protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP),
  that are present within the cell.
