caption: Hypothesis for state dependent regulation of motoneuron activity through
  the C-Bouton signaling ensemble. (A) C-boutons increase motoneuron firing frequency
  along a widow of the α-MN activity spectrum. (Ai) With low or transient physiological
  drive, m2 activation is not likely to mediate an effect on AHP duration or firing
  rate. (Aii,iii) As excitatory drive increases, persistent m2 receptor activation
  inhibits local CaV channels through a Gi/Go coupled pathway, preventing both the
  SK channel activation and Kv2.1 dephosphorylation. Thus, outward K+ current is reduced
  and neuronal firing rate is increased (relative to Bii and Biii) as illustrated
  with spike train below. (Aiv) m2-mediated effects on CaV channels are negated by
  prolonged or repeated membrane depolarization () as may occur during extremely strong
  or pathologic excitatory drive. Here, Ca2+ influx through N-type calcium channels
  activates SK channels to generate AHP and to dephosphorylate Kv2.1 to increase outward
  K+ current and reduce firing frequency, as illustrated with spike train below. (Bi–iii)
  As excitatory drive increases without C-bouton activity, the N-type Ca2+ influx
  activates SK channels to generate AHP. Thus, the outward K+ current maintains a
  lower firing frequency than in corresponding images in A. Spike trains illustrated
  below. (Biv) As in (Aiv), during prolonged or pathologic excitatory drive, N-type
  Ca2+ influx results in both SK channel activation and Kv2.1 dephosphorylation, thereby
  increasing outward K+ current and homeostatically decreasing firing rate, illustrated
  with spike train below. All spike trains depicted in this figure are added for illustrative
  purposes only and do not represent electrophysiological recordings or computer simulations.
