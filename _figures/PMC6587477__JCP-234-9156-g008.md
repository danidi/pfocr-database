caption: 'The mechanism of moderate mechanical stress on chondrocytes. Moderate mechanical
  stress could change the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio and cause Ca2+ influx, which
  activates the AMPK pathway. The activation of AMPK could reduce the level of ROS,
  which inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF‐κB p65 and, possibly, decrease the
  content of MMP‐13. AMPK: AMP‐activated protein kinase; AMP: adenosine monophosphate;
  ATP: adenosine triphosphate; MMP‐13: matrix metalloproteinase‐13; NF‐κB: nuclear
  factor‐κB; ROS: reactive oxygen species [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
