caption: Proposed pathway for protection of RGCs from apoptosis by apoE-containing
  lipoproteins. Withdrawal of trophic additives from RGCs promotes apoptosis which
  can be prevented by glia-derived apoE-containing lipoproteins (LP). When LP bind
  to LRP1, phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) is activated and hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol
  bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). DAG
  activates protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) which, directly or indirectly, phosphorylates
  and inactivates the pro-apoptotic kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). In
  addition, withdrawal of trophic additives from RGCs induces cleavage/activation
  of calcineurin and activation of caspases, resulting in apoptosis within 24 h. Thus,
  withdrawal of trophic additives causes neuronal death via a GSK3β-dependent signaling
  pathway as well as via a calcineurin-dependent pathway, and both pathways are inhibited
  by LP.
