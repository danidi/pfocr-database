caption: VPA promotes the control of M. tuberculosis infection in macrophages. VPA
  reduces M. tuberculosis load in infected macrophages through the induction of autophagy
  and by increasing NO induced by IFN-γ. Green arrows indicate the processes, molecules,
  or mediators in the signaling pathway that are augmented and/or promoted by VPA.
  Red arrows indicate processes, molecules, or mediators in the signaling pathway
  that are inhibited by VPA.
