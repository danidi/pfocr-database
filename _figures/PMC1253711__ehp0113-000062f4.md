caption: . Proposed pathway for the oxidation of alkane to fatty acid by strain HXD-3.
  The added carboxyl groups are shown in bold type to help demonstrate the reaction
  mechanism. The mechanism for alkane degradation in strain HXD-3 begins with the
  addition of CO2 to the third carbon of the chain followed by the loss of the two
  terminal carbons. This results in formation of a fatty acid one carbon shorter than
  the original alkane. The first intermediate shown in this pathway is hypothetical
  ().
