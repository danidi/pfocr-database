caption: Proposed pathway by which Gln activates PPAR-γ in small bowel intestinal
  epithelial cells. PPAR-γ can act as a nuclear receptor for both linoleic acid and
  arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid can either be metabolized by the cyclooxygenase
  pathway to 15-PGJ2 or the lipoxygenase pathway. Gln stimulation resulted in a decrease
  in 15-PGJ2. Alternatively, arachidonic acid can be metabolized to 15-S-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (15-S-HPETE) and then 15-S-HETE. Linoleic acid can be metabolized to 13-S-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic
  acid (13-S-HPODE) and then to 13-S-HODE. 13-HODE dehydrogenase then converts 13-S-HODE
  into 13-OXO-ODE. The common link between 15-S-HETE and 13-OXO-ODE is glutathione
  (GSH), which is involved in the production of these metabolic by-products, and itself
  is a metabolite of Gln via glutamate. In response to Gln stimulation, 15-S-HETE
  and 13-OXO-ODE then enter the nucleus, bind to the ligand binding domain (LBD),
  and activate PPAR-γ. Once activated, PPAR-γ heterodimerizes with the retinoid X
  receptor (RXR), and then this complex binds to a specific DNA element, PPRE, in
  the promoter of target genes where it can activate transcription (). DBD, DNA binding
  domain.
