caption: A model of multiple pathways inducing the switch from mitosis to the endo-cycle.
  This transition is initiated by binding of Delta to Notch, which promotes intracellular
  cleavage of Notch and binding to Su(H) for transcription of downstream targets.
  Although expression of JNK components ceases after the switch to the endocycle,
  the persistent expression of Ttk69 implies that the presence of Ttk69 is required
  to facilitate the switch, whereas JNK signaling actively promotes mitosis through
  regulation of the cell cycle. Notch activation upregulates Hindsight expression,
  which then downregulates Cut expression in the presence of Polycomb group members
  Psc and Su(z)2, as well as Stg (whether Hnt downregulates Dap after Notch activation
  is unknown). Loss of Cut expression relieves repression of Fzr, which degrades mitotic
  cyclins and promotes the endocycle in the midst of String and Dacapo expression
  by Notch. Ago degrades Cyclin E in the mitotic and endocycle phases but is dispensable
  during mitosis; after downregulation of Dacapo by Notch, Ago is required to maintain
  CycE levels during the endocycle oscillations. In addition, an unknown sensing pathway
  (X) activates Tor expression to modulate the switch to the endocycle; activation
  of dAkt by the Insulin Receptor pathway also upregulates Tor to promote endoreplication
  and follicle-cell growth. Connections implied by research data but lacking direct
  evidence are denoted by dotted lines.
