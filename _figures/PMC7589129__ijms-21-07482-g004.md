caption: A summary of the Pseudomonas syringae factors manipulating jasmonic acid
  (JA) signaling. Different strains of P. syringae secrete virulence factors or effectors
  to gain control over the plant JA-signaling pathway. (a) P. syringae pv. tomato
  DC3000 secretes coronatine (COR), which is a mimic of the JA-Ile and perceived through
  the COI1–JAZ co-receptor complex. This COR–COI1–JAZ complex then directs JAZ proteins,
  such as JAZ2, JAZ5, and JAZ10, for degradation [,]. (b) P. syringae also releases
  type III effector HopX1, a cysteine protease that has been reported to interact
  with the ZIM domain of JAZ family members and degrade them []. (c) HopBB1 is another
  effector released by P. syringae and interacts with both TCP14 and JAZ3, the repressor
  components of JA signaling, and glues them together to facilitate their degradation
  in a COI1-dependent manner [] (i). HopZ1a interacts with the C-terminal Jas domain
  of JAZ proteins and directs their degradation in a COI1-dependent manner [] (ii).
  Together with RIN4, the AvrB effector activates the plasma membrane ATPase AHA1.
  This complex then causes an alteration in membrane potential and, through an unknown
  mechanism, increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ, ultimately leading to
  degradation of the JAZ proteins [] (iii). In all these cases, the degradation of
  JAZ proteins relieves the repression of transcription factors (TFs) and activation
  of JA signaling, as described in , and leads to enhanced pathogen virulence. AHA1,
