caption: Scheme of magnesium and calcium transporters and their interaction in the
  AD brain. TRPM6/TRPM7, and MagT1, located in the cell membrane, facilitate Mg2+
  influx, while SLC41A1 functions as a Na+/Mg2+ exchanger and mediates Mg2+ efflux.
  Meanwhile, cellular Ca2+ transport is mediated by VGCC, NMDAR and AMPAR, as well
  as P2X7R in the microglia. In the cytoplasm, activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway by Mg2+ is required for cell growth, proliferation and the inhibition of
  autophagy. An increase in Mg2+ levels down-regulates BACE1 expression, which decreases
  Aβ production from APP, whereas Ca2+ stabilizes γ-secretase to promote Aβ formation.
  It has also been reported that Mg2+ reduces tau hyper-phosphorylation by inhibiting
  GSK3β. More importantly, increased Mg2+ can block NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx in
  the post-synapse and P2X7R-mediated Ca2+ influx in microglia, thus alleviating the
  excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation caused by excessive Ca2+ influx in AD brain.
