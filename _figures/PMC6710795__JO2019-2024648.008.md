caption: Proposed model of dovitinib-mediated autophagy and apoptosis with regard
  to the SHP-1/p-STAT3 pathway in breast cells. In breast cancer cells, dovitinib
  inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and induced autophagy, in part, via releasing of beclin
  1 from Mcl-1. Dovitinib also involved in SHP-1 activation and induced apoptotic
  cell death by downregulating of p-STAT3/cyclin D1 axis and increasing cleaved PARP
  expression. Accordingly, the present study may provide information regarding the
  association of autophagy and apoptosis with dovitinib chemotherapy in breast cancer
  cells, and the regulation of SHP-1/p-STAT3 pathway may be a promising strategy for
  treating breast cancer cells in response to RTKs inhibitors-based drugs, such as
  dovitinib.
