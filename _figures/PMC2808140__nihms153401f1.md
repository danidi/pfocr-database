caption: There is a cross-talk between β-catenin and NF-κB pathways in Salmonella-epithelial
  interaction. AvrA inhibits the NF-κB pathways. AvrA protein acts as a deubiquintinase
  to stabilize β-catenin and IκBα, thus inhibiting NF-κB pathways and activating the
  β-catenin pathway. AvrA stabilizes intestinal epithelial cell tight Junctions (TJ).
  AvrA also possesses acetyltransferase activity toward MAPKK and inhibits c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase and NF-κB signaling pathways. The role of AvrA represents a highly refined
  bacterial strategy that helps the bacteria survive in the host, dampens the inflammatory
  response, and prevents the apoptotic elimination in cells that have perceived microbial
  compromise. AvrA may play a role in stabilizing TJs and balancing the opposing action
  of other bacterial effectors.
