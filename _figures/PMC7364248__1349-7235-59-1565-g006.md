caption: Effects of lead on the heme biosynthetic pathway and porphyria. Ferrochelatase
  and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase are inhibited by lead, causing an increase
  in the level of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin and overproduction of δ-aminolevulinic
  acid with a normal level of porphobilinogen. Porphyria occurs due to the defective
  biosynthesis of heme, an iron-porphyrin complex that is the oxygen-carrying moiety
  of hemoglobin. Different types of porphyrin accumulate due to inherited defects
  in this biosynthetic pathway. In each specific porphyria, the activity of specific
  enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway is defective, leading to the accumulation
  of pathway intermediates. Each of the eight enzymes (underlined) in the heme biosynthetic
  pathway is associated with a specific porphyria.
