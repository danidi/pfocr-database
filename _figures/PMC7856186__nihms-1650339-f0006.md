caption: 'A: Under normal conditions, mNGF is derived from proNGF by plasmin (3),
  itself derived form plasminogen by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (2). tPA activity
  is controlled by neuroserpin, its endogenous inhibitor (1). MMP-9 and, we now show,
  MMP-3 degrade mNGF (7); these are regulated by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases
  1 (TIMP1) (8). Under normal conditions sufficient mNGF dimerizes and binds p75/TrkA
  receptor complexes (4). The activated receptors are internalized and retrogradely
  transported to the cell body where they ultimately exert their trophic effect (6).
  B: In the context of AD pathology, increased neuroserpin/decreased tPA (1) lead
  to reductions in local plasmin concentrations, reducing the maturation of proNGF
  to mNGF (2). Decreased TIMP1 (3) and increased MMP-3/MMP-9 lead to the excessive
  degradation of mNGF (4). As a result, trophic support to BFCNs is compromised (5).
  mNGF = mature Nerve Growth Factor, proNGF = precursor to NGF, tPA = tissue plasminogen
  activator, BFCN = basal forebrain cholinergic neuron, MMP-3/9 = matrix metalloproteinase
  3/9, TIMP1 = tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1'
