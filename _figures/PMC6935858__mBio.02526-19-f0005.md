caption: Vomocytosis occurrence is characterized by distinct intracellular, physicochemical,
  and immunological factors. Rab GTPase recruitment to phagosomes, which affects phagosomal
  maturation and cathepsin activity, is relevant for the occurrence of vomocytosis.
  Moreover, the manipulation of the ERK5 signaling pathway, annexin A2, phagosomal
  pH, and Ca2+ fluxes is capable of promoting vomocytosis occurrence. Finally, the
  immunological state of the individual and macrophage phenotype can affect vomocytosis.
  The arrows point out if the presence of each factor promotes or inhibits vomocytic
  events.
