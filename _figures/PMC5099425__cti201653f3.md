caption: Hypothetical mechanisms of tolerance after liver transplantation. Several
  mechanisms have been reported to contribute to the induction and maintenance of
  tolerance after liver transplantation. 1. Na誰ve alloreactive CD8 T cell recruited
  to the liver allograft and activated in the setting of a high alloantigen load undergo
  rapid cell death mediated by both SE and death by neglect. 2. Most na誰ve alloreactive
  CD8 T cells activated by PLs in SLOs via the direct antigen presentation pathway
  undergo early apoptosis. 3. Alloreactive CD8 T cells recirculating to the liver
  from SLOs might be cleared by SE. 4. Effector T cells or pre-existing memory T cells
  might be subjected to chronic alloantigen stimulation leading to T-cell exhaustion
  or negative regulation by host Treg. Finally, the release of high amounts of soluble
  MHC molecules by the liver allograft (5) or the development of microchimerism (6)
  have been proposed to be critical to the silencing of alloreactive CD8 T cells and
  the maintenance of tolerance after liver transplantation.
