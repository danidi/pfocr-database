caption: 'To combat 1O2 stress the alternative sigma factor RpoE and subsequently
  RpoHII are activated in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. RpoHII induces expression of the
  depicted enzymes for pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), Entner–Doudoroff pathway (ED)
  and gluconeogenesis to generate the antioxidant NADPH and indirectly represses enzymes
  for the TCA cycle, which generates the prooxidant NADH. To favor this pathway shunt
  RpoHII also induces the sRNA SorY. SorY regulates TakP synthesis negatively to limit
  intermediate availability for the TCA cycle by decreasing malate influx into the
  cell. This assigns a so far unknown function to a sRNA in oxidative stress response.
