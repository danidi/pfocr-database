caption: Schematic representation of metabolic pathways in  a typical oil storing
  cell of a developing Arabidopsis embryo. The  selective focus presented here is
  on carbohydrate metabolism and fatty  acid biosynthesis. Only cytosolic and plastidic
  isoforms are  considered. Double-headed arrows indicate readily reversible reactions,  single
  headed arrows indicate typically irreversible reactions.  Cosubstrates such as water
  or nucleotides have been omitted.  Abbreviations are conventional, but can also
  be deduced from the enzyme  descriptions given in Table . Numbers correspond to
  individual  reactions and serve to identify the respective enzyme in Table . The  thickness
  of arrows provides a coarse indication of the number of ESTs  present in the seed
  EST data set for the respective reaction. The exact  numbers for each reaction can
  be found in Table .
