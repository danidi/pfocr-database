caption: Potential positive feedback mechanisms in breast cancer between estrogens,
  inflammatory cytokines, and PGE2. PTGES is an important enzyme that acts downstream
  of COX-2 in the PGE2 biosynthesis pathway. Our findings suggest the presence of
  a positive feedback loop between estrogens and PGE2, whereby estrogens up-regulate
  PTGES expression and PGE2 up-regulates aromatase expression. Our findings also suggest
  that proinflammatory cytokines can positively reinforce this feedback loop by enhancing
  both the production and action of estrogens via increasing aromatase expression
  and influence of the NFκB pathway on ER recruitment and activity at the PTGES gene,
  resulting in a synergistic up-regulation of PTGES expression. PGH2, Prostaglandin
  H2.
