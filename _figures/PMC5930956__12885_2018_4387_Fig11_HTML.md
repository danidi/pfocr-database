caption: Proposed model for the role of c-Cbl in tamoxifen resistance of HER2-overexpressing
  breast cancer cells. In HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, ER-c-Src-HER2 complex
  formation results in HER2 signaling pathway activation and tamoxifen resistance.
  c-Cbl reduces ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation by inhibiting lipid rafts and restores
  the sensitivity to tamoxifen
