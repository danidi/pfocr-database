caption: Schematic representation of hypothesized interactions between Smoothened
  and the CB1 receptor in the embryo. Left panel. During typical development, Sonic
  Hedgehog (Shh) alleviates the repression of Smoothened (Smo) by Patched (Ptch1)
  which allows Smo to translocate to the primary cilium. In the primary cilium, Smo,
  a G-protein coupled receptor, activates Shh pathway signaling, partly through its
  association with Gαi proteins. Gαi inhibits adenyl cyclase (AC) which, by inhibiting
  the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP), inhibits the accumulation of protein kinase A (PKA) and prevents the proteolytic
  processing of Gli transcription factors into their repressor forms (Gli R). By maintaining
  the Gli activator (Gli A) state, the inhibition of PKA facilitates the gene transcription
  necessary for normal cell proliferation and development. Right panel. Alcohol (EtOH)
  and cannabinoids converge onto the Shh pathway to alter typical development. A mechanism
  by which alcohol affects development is through its inhibition of Shh, which reduces
  the number of Smo molecules at the primary cilia, and thereby reduces the activation
  of Shh signaling cascades. Cannabinoids, on the other hand, have two mechanisms
  of action. First, cannabinoids directly inhibit Smo and prevent the signaling of
  Smo through Gαi proteins, as described above. Additionally, cannabinoids stimulate
  CB1 receptors that, in the primary cilia, form heterodimers with Smo. CB1-Smo heterodimers
  associate with Gαs proteins, in addition to Gαi proteins. When Gαs signaling is
  activated by CB1 receptor agonism, PKA is stimulated which increases Gli R and decreases
  Gli A. Co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids therefore, inhibits Shh and Smo-Gαi
  signaling, while simultaneously stimulating CB1-Gαs signaling, and ultimately causing
  a greater reduction in Shh pathway activation than does exposure to either drug
  alone.
