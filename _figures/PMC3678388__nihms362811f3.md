caption: ATR recruitment to some DNA base lesions proceeds through a mismatch repair-dependent
  mechanism.Mismatch repair proteins may contribute directly and indirectly to ATR
  recognition of some times of DNA damage. Direct interactions between the ATR-ATRIP
  complex and MUTSα and MUTLα proteins may promote activation of ATR independently
  of RPA and single-stranded DNA. Alternatively, mismatch repair-dependent DNA processing
  may promote the RPA-dependent canonical ATR signaling pathway.
