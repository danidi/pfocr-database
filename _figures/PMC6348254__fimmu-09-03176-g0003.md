caption: 'Simplified scheme of DC ontogeny. DC arise from HSC that give rise to MP
  and LP. MP are further differentiated into MDP that can differentiate into CDP and
  monocytes. CDP differentiate further into pDC or pre-cDC. LP can also give rise
  to pDC, although this ontogenic pathway is not completely elucidated. Once in the
  blood, pre-cDC give rise to two of the main DC subtypes: cDC1 and cDC2. Both pDC
  and cDC can migrate from the blood to lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. HSC, hematopoietic
  stem cell; MP, myeloid precursors; LP, lymphoid precursors; MDP, macrophage-DC precursors;
  CDP, common DC precursors; pre-cDC, pre-classical dendritic cells; pDC, plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells; cDCs, conventional dendritic cells; FLT3, Fms-Related Tyrosine
  Kinase 3.'
