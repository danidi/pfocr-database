caption: Activated cytotoxic lymphocytes (NK cells and CTL) express perforin and granzymes,
  and induce membranolysis of cells within the synovium (including synoviocytes and
  infiltrating myelomonocytic cells). Activation of the classical or alternate pathway
  of complement can induce the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), and
  complement-mediated membranolysis. In both cases, membranolysis induces calcium
  flux, with a spike in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations towards the millimolar
  range. This activates PAD4 enzymatic function, and generation of citrullinated autoantigens,
  which after uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells, can further feed
  the afferent arm of the immune response. It is proposed that the effector arm of
  this response induces more membranolysis, further feeding the cycle.
