caption: A. Sphingosine/ceramide metabolism. Enzymes mediating the illustrated transformations
  are listed on the left, names of the products on the right. This figure highlights
  the biosynthetic pathway leading to sphingosine phosphate production. Not shown
  are the pathways that produce sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids from ceramide
  and the degradative pathways that produce ceramide from sphingomyelin via sphingomyelinases,
  sphingosine from sphingosine-1-phosphate via sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatases,
  and the degradation of sphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase.
  B. Sphingosine kinase substrates are used for ceramide synthesis. Illustrated are
  the routes of ceramide synthesis from the de novo pathway (from the top) and the
  salvage pathway (from the bottom) and how sphingosine kinase can potentially divert
  substrates from these routes of ceramide synthesis.
