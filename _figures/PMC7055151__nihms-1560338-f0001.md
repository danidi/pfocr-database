caption: Many categories of factors are known to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT), the inhibition or removal of which might promote the reverse process of mesenchymal-epithelial
  transition (MET). Microenvironmental cells (for example, tumour-associated macrophages,
  hypoxic adipocytes and other inflammatory cells) produce EMT-promoting factors such
  as transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast
  growth factors (FGFs), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), tumour necrosis factor, IL-6
  (REF.) and leptin,. Through activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway,
  these cells invoke crosstalk with EMT-activating transcription factors,. Alterations
  of the metabolic microenvironment induced by rapid primary tumour growth might also
  induce EMT–, and hypoxia, through the action of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α),
  can directly drive the expression of EMT-activating transcription factors in various
  tumour types,,. Matrix stiffness has also been shown to stimulate EMT,,. Therapeutic
  agents have primarily been shown to promote EMT in association with drug resistance–,,,–,
  although some are associated with MET, and these cause significant improvements
  in disease-free survival and overall survival. Developmental pathways, which might
  be activated by genomic and/or epigenomic regulators, have also been implicated
  in epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP),. ECM, extracellular matrix.
