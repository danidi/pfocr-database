caption: A schematic showing a proposed mechanism of Gal-1 involvement in the HIF/mTOR
  signaling axis in renal cell carcinoma. (1) Increased HIF-1α because of the hypoxic
  tumor microenvironment (2) translocates to the nucleus and transcriptionally activates
  the LGALS1 gene. Gal-1 protein then, by a mechanism that has yet to be elucidated,
  (3) activates Akt by phosphorylating S473, which in turn phosphorylates mTOR at
  S2448 and p70S6 kinase to result in increased protein synthesis. This pathway can
  be blocked by the addition of (4) siRNA that is directed towards Gal-1. We also
  showed that the pathway can be affected by miRNA as (5) miR-22 can target both Gal-1
  and HIF-1α.
