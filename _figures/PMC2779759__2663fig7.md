caption: 'Schematic model illustrating how Jun proteins regulate the TIMP-3, TACE,
  and TNFα pathway: Jun proteins transcriptionally activate TIMP-3 expression, which
  is responsible for TACE inhibition. The absence of JunB and c-Jun leads to an increase
  in TACE activity, followed by increased levels of sTNFα, which signals through TNFR1,
  inducing more TNFα RNA and TNFα-dependent cytokines. This cascade causes skin inflammation
  leading to a psoriasis-like disease in adult mice and to skin inflammation and cachexia
  with perinatal death in newborns.'
