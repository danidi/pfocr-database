caption: 'Stem cell response to matrix stiffness by integin, cytoskeleton and signal
  transduction crosstalk. (A) Integrin binding and cytoskeletal organization of stem
  cells seeded on substrates with varying stiffness. Left: on soft matrix stem cells
  present small spreading area, poorly defined actin cytoskeleton, low levels of lamin-A
  and detachment of focal adhesion complexes, associated with the uptake of integrins.
  Middle: on topographical substrates with medium stiffness, cells develop enlongated
  focal adhesions, intermediate levels of lamin-A, and well-aligned stress fibers
  with a spindle-shaped morphology. Right: stem cells cultured on rigid matrices display
  a large spreading size, prominent stress fibers and enhanced focal adhesion assembly,
  as well as high levels of lamin-A. BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BMPR, bone morphogenetic
  protein receptor; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase. (B) Crosstalk between signal transduction
  pathways induced by matrix stiffness to modulate stem cell lineage specification.
  Left: blocking of BMP/Smad signaling by enhanced uptake of β1 integrin through caveolae/raft-dependent
  endocytosis on soft matrix drives mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) neurogenic differentiation;
  lamin-A inhibits adipogenic differentiation by suppressing the , sterol regulatory
  element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1) transcriptional pathway; blocking
  of integrin-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, which may activate AP-1 by stimulation of Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK), leads to keratinocyte differentiation of epidermal stem cells. Middle:
  on topographical substrates with medium stiffness, MSCs employ β3 integrin-RhoA-Rho
  associated kinase (ROCK)-myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathways to promote actin
  filament bundling and stress fiber contraction to create appropriate cytoskeletal
  tension, which further influences myogenic gene expression; medium stiffness acts
  through β1 integrin, causing a reduction of p190RhoGAP, which results in nuclear
  localization of GATA2 and TFII-1 in a RhoA-independent manner, ultimately leading
  to endothelial differentiation of cardiac stem cells; nuclear localization of GATA2
  inhibits Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling that drives osteogenesis on stiff
  matrices. Right: on stiff matrix the α2-integrin-ROCK-FAK-ERK1/2 axis is shown to
  increase RUNX2 activity, leading to osteoblast differentiation of MSCs; Ras pathway
  regulates phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/8, ERK1/2 and AKT during osteogenic
  differentiation; the retinoic acid (RA) pathway enhances lamin-A transcription,
  but feedback by lamin-A indirectly modulates nuclear localization of RA receptor
  gamma (RARG), which can be inhibited by RA and promotes RUNX2 activity on stiff
  substrates; lamin-A also co-regulates SRF and YAP1 to drive osteogenesis; SRF signaling
  in turn affects stress fiber contractility; increased intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration
  on rigid matrix may contribute to cytoskeleton tension through the activation of
  MLCK. Broken lines, unknown or putative signaling; solid lines, as in published.
  Arrows indicate activation, blocked lines inhibition.'
