caption: p68/p72-dependent miRNA processing pathways. The RNA helicases p68 and p72
  play a critical role in the posttranscriptional regulation of numerous miRNAs in
  response to cellular signals, including TGF-β stimulation, DNA damage, and estrogen
  stimulation. The downstream mediators of TGF-β stimulation and DNA damage, the Smads
  and p53, act to promote miRNA processing. Conversely, when bound to E2, ER-α reduces
  the processing of a subset of miRNAs. The bottom column indicates miRNAs known to
  be posttranscriptionally regulated by each pathway. For clarity, DGCR8 and other
  potential members of the Drosha processing complex are not shown.
