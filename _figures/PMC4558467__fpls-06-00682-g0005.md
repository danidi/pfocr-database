caption: Schematic representation of MAPK signaling cascade in yeast and plants. Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade is triggered in yeast in response to MG.
  A similar pathway is proposed to operate in rice as well in response to MG. The
  rice counterparts found to be induced by MG application have been shown along with
  their probe IDs. MG can modify expression of genes either by inducing the signal
  cascade through sensor proteins or it can directly affect the activity of transcription
  factor that goes and binds the promoter region at MG-responsive elements (MGRE)
  and regulate gene expression.
