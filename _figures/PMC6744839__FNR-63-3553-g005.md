caption: Proposed mechanisms of the pro-apoptotic effect on human GC AGS and BGC-823
  cells induced by pholidonone. Increasing expression of Ero1-Lα, PDI, and calnexin
  was observed, suggesting that malfolded proteins were accumulated in the ER after
  pholidonone administration, causing ER stress and provoking the unfolded protein
  response to activate the signaling cascade that triggers apoptosis (A); Pholidonone
  might trigger cell apoptosis through upregulating IRE1α and subsequently activating
  Caspase-3 signaling via JNK (B); Pholidonone might exert its pro-apoptotic effect
  through the activation of CHOP via PERK signaling pathway, which subsequently leads
  to the upregulation of Caspase-3, eventually triggering apoptosis (C).
