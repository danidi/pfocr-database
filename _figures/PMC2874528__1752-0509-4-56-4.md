caption: The non-mevalonate pathway. The non-mevalonate pathway produces isopentenyl
  diphosphate (IPP). It is an alternative pathway in bacteria and does not exist in
  the human host which uses the mevalonate pathway to produce IPP. The non-melavonate
  pathway was highly enriched with genes that were predicted to be essential. Reactions
  are given by their EC number and the gene symbol of the genes of the corresponding
  enzymes.
