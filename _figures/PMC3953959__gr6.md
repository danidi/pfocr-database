caption: Regulation of TFs activity by degradation modulated by H2O2. TF degradation
  via poliubiquitin(Ub)-proteasome pathway is an important regulatory mechanism in
  different signaling pathways (A). Proteasome, a multicatalytic protease oligomeric
  complex, degrades proteins that have been poly-ubiquitinated. Ubiquitin (Ub)-protein
  ligase (E3) enzymes transfer the activated Ub from an Ub-conjugating protein E2,
  first to a lysine residue of the substrate protein and the next Ub to lysine residues
  present in the last added ubiquitin, originating an Ub chain. NRF2 ubiquitination
  and degradation involves KEAP1 as the substrate adaptor subunit in the E3 holoenzyme
  (B). In the presence of H2O2 critical cysteine residues in KEAP1 are oxidized, changing
  KEAP1 conformation. This conformational change affects the interaction between NRF2
  and KEAP1 inhibiting NRF2 ubiquitination and degradation. In normal cells TP53 is
  maintained at low levels by interaction with the negative regulator MDM2 a p53 highly
  specific ubiquitin ligase. H2O2 mainly regulates MDM2 activity by activating the
  ATM and c-ABL kinases involved in MDM2 phosphorylation. MDM2 phosphorylation inhibits
  its ubiquitination activity and stabilizes TP53 (C). The MDM2 ubiquitin ligase substrate
  preference for TP53 is enhanced by MDMX. Phosphorylation of MDMX in different residues
  by c-ABL, AKT and CHK2 kinases inhibit TP53 degradation, while those catalyzed by
  the CK1α kinase stimulates TP53 degradation. All the referred kinases activities
  are regulated by H2O2. The association between the TF and the ubiquitination machinery
  can also be modulated by PTMs of the transcription factor (D). HIF-1α is tagged
  with ubiquitin for degradation after being hydroxylated by PHD in the presence of
  O2 (D). H2O2 inhibits PHD that leads to HIF-1α stabilization. Factors colored blue
  are inhibitors of TF-dependent gene expression; factors colored red are activators
  of TF-dependent gene expression. Dashed lines indicate activation/inhibition.
