caption: Cholesterol (ergosterol in fungi) synthesis requires more than 20 enzymes
  and is controlled by negative feedback. The biosynthetic pathway is outlined inside
  the box showing key intermediates and regulated enzymes. Upon sterol depletion,
  transcription of sterol synthesis enzymes is activated by sterol-regulated transcription
  factors, SREBP in mammals, Sre1 in S. pombe, and Upc2 and Ecm22 in S. cerevisiae.
  In sterol-rich conditions, the end product reduces biosynthesis by inhibiting transcription
  factor activity. In S. pombe, low oxygen additionally activates Sre1 and sterol
  enzymes. In mammalian cells, two enzymes, 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase (HMGR) and squalene monooxygenase (SM) are subject to sterol-dependent
  degradation. HMGR catalyzes the synthesis of mevalonate from HMG-CoA and is degraded
  by ERAD in response to 24,25-dihydrolanosterol and an isoprenoid derived from mevalonate.
  SM catalyzes the first oxygenation reaction of the pathway and is regulated by cholesterol-dependent
  proteasomal degradation.
