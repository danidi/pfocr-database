caption: The canonical NF-κB pathway is regulated both by K63 (Lys63)-linked and linear
  (Met1)-linked ubiquitin chains. RIPK1 is the central adaptor for assembly of the
  TNFR1 receptor-signaling complex and is a predominant target for ubiquitination
  by K63 and linear ubiquitin chains. Polyubiquitylated RIPK1 mediates recruitment
  of IKK complex that is also target for ubiquitination. The activated IKK complex
  phosphorylates inhibitor of κB (IκB) and targets IκB for ubiquitin–proteasome system
  (UPS)-mediated degradation. A20 and OTULIN negatively regulate NF-κB signaling,
  by cleaving K63 and linear UB chains from target molecules, RIPK1 and IKK. Decreased
  expression of mutant A20 or OTULIN proteins will lead to activation of the NF-κB
  pathway and increased expression of proinflammatory transcripts in immune cells.
  The NLRP3 inflammasome is also negatively regulated by A20 [,].TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1);
  TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD); the death domain-containing protein
  kinase receptor-interacting protein1 (RIPK1); NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing
  protein 3 (NLRP3).
