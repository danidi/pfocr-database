caption: 'RhoA/ROCKs closely participate in the development of multiple pathological
  changes in heart failure. ROCK1 and ROCK2 are cleaved by caspase-3 and granzyme
  B, respectively, resulting in active ROCK1 and ROCK2 kinase fragments, which facilitate
  cardiomyocyte apoptosis. ROCK2 promotes cardiac hypertrophy through 1) increasing
  the expression of SRF-targeted cardiac fetal genes; and 2) increasing the expression
  and activity of pro-hypertrophic gene FHOD3. ROCKs also promote cardiac fibrosis
  through activating MRTF/SRF pathway and YAP/TAZ-TEAD pathway in myofibroblasts.
  In addition, ROCKs promote pulmonary hypertension through enhancing vasocontraction
  and inhibiting nitric oxide production. SRF: serum response factor; FHOD3: formin
  homology 2 domain containing 3; MTRF: myocardin-related transcription factor; YAP:
  yes-associated protein; TAZ: transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif;
  TEAD: transcriptional enhancer factor TEF; RV: right ventricle.'
