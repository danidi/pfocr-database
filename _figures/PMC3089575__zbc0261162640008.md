caption: Proposed interconnection between PE synthesis and conversion (PL interconversion
  triad) during LD biosynthesis. PE represent conically shaped PL molecules and are
  required for initiation of membrane curvatures in LD sprouts from the outer ER monolayer
  during early adipogenesis. Compartmentalization of PE produced via the CDP-ethanolamine
  pathway (i.e. ER resident) results in unavailability of PE for further conversion
  by the enzyme PEMT during LD biosynthesis. Rather, PE is preferentially produced
  via PS at onset of differentiation (1, PE synthesis phase; upper panel). This PSS1-mediated
  reaction requires serine and ER resident PC as substrates. PS is then translocated
  to mitochondria, where it is decarboxylated by PSD, resulting in PE. This concerted
  action of PSS1/PSD shifts PE into the MAM/LD compartment, which allows subsequent
  methylation by PEMT (2, PE conversion phase; lower panel). The resulting serine-derived
  PC is finally a component of the LD monolayer. In the absence of PEMT from mouse
  adipose tissue, the PSS1 pathways is attenuated. CT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; EA, ethanolamine; ET, CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase;
  SS1, phosphatidylserine synthase-1.
