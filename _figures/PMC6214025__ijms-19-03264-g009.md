caption: Combined nano-therapy strategy of MSN containing DOX and AgNPs in cancerous
  cell. MSNs are loaded with DOX then coated with AgNPs. The obtained DOX/AgNPs/MSN
  is internalized into cancerous cell via endocytosis and then released to cytosol
  by endosomal pH through endosomal/lysosomal escape. Released AgNPs resulted in mitochondrial
  dysfunction by inducing ROS production in mitochondria. DOX released accelerate
  ROS production, followed by induce oxidative stress in cytosol via DOX semiquinone.
  DOX also is intercalated into DNA that results in DNA damaging by poisoning of topoisomerase
  II. Both of AgNPs and DOX finally induce cancer cell death through oxidative stress
  by increasing ROS and DNA damaging in nucleus. Black colored indicates direction
  of pathway and red color indicates blocking function.
