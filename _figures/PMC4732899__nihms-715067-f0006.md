caption: HDM and IL-17A activate p38 MAPK signaling in airway epithelial cells (AEC)
  to induce TNFα converting enzyme (TACE) or another member of the a disintegrin and
  metalloproteinases (ADAM) family to cleave EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG),
  on adjacent cells or on its own cell surface, that activate EGFR signaling, which
  drives the production of GM-CSF. GM-CSF contributes to allergic airway disease via
  the activation and priming of macrophages (Mϕ) to produce innate immune mediators
  and possibly through direct effects on the airway. Antigen presenting cells (APC)
  can process and present HDM antigens to activated T cells (Th1, Th2, Th17) that
  then release adaptive immune mediators and cytokines that contribute to the pathogenesis
  of allergic airway disease.
