caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) identified critical expression networks
  containing genes that are significantly correlated with the extent of necrosis in
  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma (GBM) samples from all subclasses (A
  and B). The STAT3 network was among the most closely associated with necrosis (A).
  The C/EBP gene network was also highly correlated with the extent of necrosis and
  demonstrates the central importance of IL-6. (B). Gene networks that were differentially
  expressed between mesenchymal GBMs with high (>15%) and low extent of necrosis (≤15%)
  included those that were centered around CEBP-β and were strongly associated with
  upregulated IL-8 signaling (C).
