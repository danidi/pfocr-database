caption: Biogen-Idec has developed mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to
  the NH2-terminal region, EGF-like domain or CFC motif of Cripto-1. The NH2 mAbs
  are binding antibodies, whereas the mAbs targeting the EGF-like or CFC domains are
  blocking antibodies. The binding B3.F6.1 antibody has been humanized and conjugated
  to the toxin DM4 for future use in cancer patients. The anti-CFC mAbs might potentially
  block interaction of Cripto-1 with GRP78. C3, C4 and C13 rat IgM monoclonal antibodies
  bind to the EGF-like domain of Cripto-1 and block tumor growth by induction of apoptosis
  and inhibition of Akt signaling pathway. The tetrametic tripeptide Cripto-1 Blocking
  peptide (CBP) blocks interaction of Cripto-1 with Alk4 and improves dopaminergic
  differentiation of ES cells in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease.
