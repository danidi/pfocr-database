caption: Model for APP trafficking in Aβ production. (A) For APP to be cleaved efficiently
  into Aβ in the TGN, newly synthesized APP (red) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  first traffics along the secretory pathway via the TGN to the plasma membrane. (B)
  APP is then internalized via endocytosis to reach early endosomes. (C) Next, the
  endocytic pool of APP (purple) is recycled to the TGN, in a retromer-dependent manner,
  where Aβ is produced. (D) The biosynthetic pool of APP (red) in the TGN can also
  traffic directly to endosomes in a process mediated by the AP-4 complex (C) and
  retrieved back to the TGN, in a retromer-dependent manner, for Aβ production.
