caption: Scheme illustrating the proposed mechanism by which ET-1 increases phenylephrine-induced
  contraction in hypertension and the effect of PPARγ activation. In segments from
  hypertensive rats, ET-1, acting on ETA receptors, increases NOX-1 mRNA levels and
  NADPH oxidase activity through NFκB and AP-1 activation in vascular smooth muscle
  cells. This enhanced ROS production induces COX-2 expression that together with
  augmented PGIS expression lead to PGI2-dependent activation of TP receptors that
  increases the contraction induced by phenylephrine; in addition, the increased oxidative
  stress reduces NO bioavailability, which also contributes to ET-induced effects
  on phenylephrine response. After pioglitazone treatment, there is a reduction of
  smooth muscle ETA levels and an increase of endothelial ETB. In these conditions,
  ET-1, acting on ETB, increases NO production; the reduction of oxidative stress
  due to attenuated NFκB and AP-1 activities induced by pioglitazone contributes to
  decrease COX-2 expression and to increase NO bioavailability; these mechanisms play
  a role in the reduction induced by ET-1 of the phenylephrine response observed after
  pioglitazone treatment.
