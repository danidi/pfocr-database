caption: Signaling pathways for inner ear proliferation and differentiation. This
  schematic diagram represents an overview of the known and presumed interactive pathways
  for proliferation and differentiation of the neurosensory cells in the inner ear.
  Signaling of the membrane-bound (brown) Notch receptors by binding to their ligands,
  Delta and Jagged, can be influenced by the extracellular (purple) Fringe and ADAM
  enzymes. Fringe inhibits (blocked line) the Notch binding of Jagged, while Adam
  cleaves the Notch receptor to potentate its activation (lined arrow). The cleavage
  of intercellular domain fragment of Notch is done by the cytoplasmic (dark blue)
  γ-secretase complex which then activates the nuclear protein (red) RBPSUH. Inactivated
  RBPSUH blocks transcription of the Hes genes whereas activation enhances transcription.
  Homodimers of HES proteins can bind to N-boxes to initiate differentiation (green)
  of glial precursors. N-box binding of HES homodimers is regulated further by a FOXG,
  RUNX and TLE promoter complex. Heterodimers between HES and E proteins bind and
  competitively block usage of E-box-binding sites. Activation of E-box promoter sequences
  is through the combined E-protein and the activator bHLH heterodimers and this permits
  neuronal differentiation. To do this, the activator bHLH proteins compete with HES
  proteins for the E-protein-binding partners. E proteins can also be inactivated
  from DNA binding through interaction with the inhibitor of DNA-binding (ID) proteins,
  which also suppress the cell cycle (blue) retinoblastoma isoforms. The pRB isoforms
  alone or in combination E2F proteins cause cell differentiation. Cell proliferation
  (green) is mediated through the proteins of cyclin CDK pathway that phosphorylate
  Rb to allow E2F proteins to initiate the S-phase entry. The cyclin CDK proteins
  can also inhibit differentiation via pRB phosphorylation, whereas cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitors (Cdkn) prevent proliferation. Expression of the CDKNs is blocked
  by the FOXG, RUNX and TLE complex, allowing differentiation of glia cells through
  enhanced action of HES homodimers on the N-Box. Modified after Refs ,,,.
