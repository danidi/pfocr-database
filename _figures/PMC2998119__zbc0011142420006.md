caption: Schematic illustration of the TLR/IL-1R-IRAK-NFκB connectivity and signaling
  in AD brain and in IL-1β+Aβ42 peptide-stressed HAG cells. IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 occupy
  important early control points in TLR/IL-1R-NF-κB signaling pathway (, , ). A membrane-spanning
  TIR transduces signals triggered by extracellular toxins, peptides, and inflammatory
  cytokines via MyD88, IRAK-1, and IRAK-2. These ultimately trigger NF-κB-mediated
  inflammatory gene expression, neuropathology, and an altered innate immune response.
  The TLR/IL-1R shown here is generic and may represent multiple types of the IL-1
  receptor sensor whose identities in the human brain are not well understood (, ,
  , ). The normally high abundance of IRAK-1 in control aging human brain and HAG
  cells () and the IRAK-1-NF-κB circuit (dotted lines) appears to be virtually shut
  down by an NF-κB-mediated up-regulation of miRNA-146a (a negative regulator of IRAK-1)
  and is associated with a shift to strong up-regulation of an NF-κB-activated IRAK-2.
  IRAK-2 transcription appears to be highly cell-specific as 10-fold differences in
  the same IRAK-2 immediate promoter construct between A549 and THP-1 cells have been
  noted (). The current data support previous observations that the IRAK-2-NF-κB signaling
  loop is strongly self-reinforcing. This may contribute to the sustained activation
  of NF-κB and its pathogenic consequences in the neurodegenerative process (, , ).
  Although MyD88, NEMO, IKKα/β, IRAK-4, TRAF6, and other adaptor proteins are known
  to contribute to homeostatic TIR-IRAK-NF-κB signaling, their interactive role in
  this pathogenic scheme is currently not known and warrants further study. We have
  found no change in MyD88, IRAK-4, IRAK-M, or TRAF6 abundance in either AD or stressed
  HAG cells (, A and B; data not shown), suggesting that IRAK-2 up-regulation alone
  may be of primary importance in pathogenic signaling. The combinatorial use of miRNA-146a/AM146a
  () along with selective NF-κB inhibitors (heavy horizontal black bars) may have
  significant potential as an effective multi-target therapeutic strategy against
  pathogenic IRAK-2-mediated inflammatory signaling that drives neurodegenerative
  processes.
