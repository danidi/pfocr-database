caption: 'Biogenesis of exosomes and their role in maintaining stemness: exosome formation
  follows the endocytic-exocytic pathway, which is initiated upon receiving extrinsic
  or intrinsic signals in a context-dependent manner, i.e., in response to either
  a disease signal or a reparative signal related to tissue injury. The regions of
  plasma membrane enriched in lipid-raft microdomains (red bars) are inveginated,
  resulting in the formation of early endosomes and their maturation into late endosomes
  (steps 1–3), with a series of changes occurring under the influence of multicomponent
  sorting machinery []. Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fuse with the plasma membrane
  and secrete exosomes outwardly; these exosomes may interact with resident cells
  and may facilitate stemness, i.e., self-renewal, clonal expansion, differentiation,
  and repair. MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells'
