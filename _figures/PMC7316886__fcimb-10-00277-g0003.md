caption: Dysregulated IFN responses in COPD airway epithelial cells. Type I and III
  IFNs bind to their respective receptors and stimulate the expression of ISGs as
  well amplify the expression of IFNs through activation of JAK-STAT pathway. RV interaction
  with TLR2 induces the expression of SIRT-1, which inhibits STAT activation to limit
  amplification of IFNs and the expression of ISGs and this arm is dysregulated in
  COPD. Shown in the figure is binding of IFN-β to its receptors, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.
  Interaction of IFN-λs with its receptors IFNLR1 and IL10R2 activates JAK-STAT signaling
  similar to IFN-β.
