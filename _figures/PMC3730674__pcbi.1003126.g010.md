caption: (A) The nitrogen assimilation pathway contains two alternate routes that
  convert α-ketoglutarate into the essential metabolite L-glutamine (red). (A1) The
  en(am)-2 mutant is viable, because α-ketoglutarate can be aminated to L-glutamate
  via am. (A2) The am mutant is viable, because α-ketoglutarate and L-glutamine can
  be converted to 2 L-glutamate via en(am)-2. (A3) The double mutant am:en(am)-2 is
  lethal when ammonium is the nitrogen source because both routes to L-glutamine are
  blocked, but (A4) can be rescued when the media is supplemented with L-glutamate
  (A4). (B) The only two routes for the synthesis of the essential metabolite L-proline
  are through arginine degradation and proline biosynthesis. (B1) The pro-3 mutant
  is blocked in proline biosynthesis, but can obtain L-proline through arginine degradation.
  (B2) The ota mutant is blocked in arginine degradation, but can obtain L-proline
  through proline biosynthesis. (B3) The double mutant pro-3:ota is blocked in both
  routes, but can be rescued when the nutrient media is supplemented with L-proline
  (B4). (C) There are only two biosynthetic routes to the essential metabolite uridine-5′-phosphate.
  (C1) The pyr-1 mutant can still obtain uridine-5′-phosphate from extracellular uracil,
  and the uc-5 mutant can obtain uridine-5′-phosphate from (S)-dihydroorotate (C2),
  but the pyr-1:uc-5 double mutant is blocked in both routes (C3). However, it can
  be rescued when the nutrient media is supplemented with uridine through its conversion
  to uridine-5′-phosphate in the pyrimidine salvage pathways (C4). Side compounds
  not shown.
