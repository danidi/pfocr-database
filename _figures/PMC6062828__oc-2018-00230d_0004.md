caption: Calcineurin–mitochondrial (CaN–mitochondrial) connection. (A) At abnormally
  high calcium (Ca2+) influx rates, such as during elevated glutamate signaling, calcineurin
  (CaN) becomes highly active and triggers the pathway of apoptosis by dephosphorylating
  the pro-apoptotic factor Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) which translocates
  to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and dimerizes with the anti-apoptotic
  factors B-cell lymphphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). The
  event spurs another pro-apoptotic factor, Bcl-2-associated-X (BAX), to transition
  to the OMM and catalyze the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (mPTP). The sustained high Ca2+ load continues to maintain the opening of the
  mPTP, leading to the release of cytochrome c and formation of the apoptosome, culminating
  in the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis. (B) CaN has also shown to be involved
  in triggering mitochondrial fission by dephosphorylating the dynamin-related protein
  1 (DRP1). DRP1 translocates to the OMM, forms puncta, and constricts the mitochondria
  with an oligomeric chain and splices the organelle similar to vesicular cleavage
  by dynamin. The fission of mitochondria is thought to come before the release of
  cytochrome c, leading to dysfunction and triggering apoptosis or necrosis based
  on the rate and severity of the event. Evidence has shown that mitochondrial fission
  is indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, and the spherical mitochondrial debris
  void of cytochrome c implicates the occurrence of cell death pathways.
