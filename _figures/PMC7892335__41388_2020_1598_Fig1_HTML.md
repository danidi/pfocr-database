caption: a The de-differentiation/lineage plasticity of androgen receptor (AR)-positive
  to AR-negative disease is likely dependent on the extent of AR inhibition (duration
  and/or type of inhibitors) and the existence of genetic and epigenetic adaption
  mechanisms (e.g., SOX2, TP53, RB1, N-MYC, EZH2), while resistance to androgen deprivation
  therapy (ADT) alone typically involves adaptation mechanisms in the AR pathway.
  b Prostate cancer growth and survival are dependent on testosterone (T). Testosterone
  converts locally to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which binds and activates the AR
  and causes translocation to the nucleus. Here, AR promotes the transcription of
  cell cycle genes that promote cancer cell proliferation. ADT initially leads to
  the regression of the tumor but cancer cells often become resistant, referred to
  as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). At this stage, cancer cells adapt
  to the lower availability of DHT by acquiring gain of function mutations and amplifications
  on the AR gene. Upon exposure to ARSi (e.g., enzalutamide, abiraterone), prostate
  cancer cells may more likely undergo de-differentiation into AR-negative prostate
  cancer, which is associated with extensive rewiring of transcription and chromatin
  structure. c Scheme of different signaling pathways that can lead to AR epigenetic
  silencing and protein loss in prostate cancer cells. AR-independent prostate cancer
  cells can re-express AR protein through exogenous stimuli (in green) that block
  AR repression. Once re-activated, AR can re-sensitize those cells to ARSi. Aza azacitidine,
  NGF nerve growth factor, TSA Trichostatin A.
