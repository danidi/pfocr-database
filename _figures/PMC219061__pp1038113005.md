caption: Free-energy changes (ΔG) associated with the conversion of F1,6BP to build
  up a H+ gradient in tonoplast vesicles or with conversion to pyruvate by the glycolytic
  pathway. After Glc or Fru phosphorylation, the F1,6BP formed can be diverted to
  PPisynthesis by PPi-PFP (ΔG1), and the PPi is hydrolyzed by H+-PPase to build up
  a proton gradient of 2 units of pH in the tonoplast vesicles (ΔG2). Alternatively,
  the F1,6BP is converted into triose-P by aldolase (ΔG3). The triose-P is converted
  by glycolytic enzymes to pyruvate (ΔG4). ΔG1 and ΔG2 were calculated as shown in  (condition
  A) using concentrations in the plant cell cytosol. The ΔG3 and ΔG4 were calculated
  from glycolytic reactions described by Kubota and Ashihara ().
