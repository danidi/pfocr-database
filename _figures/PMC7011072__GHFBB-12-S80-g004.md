caption: The crucial role of inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, and NOTCH signaling pathway
  in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); A) Regulation of epithelial cell death in the
  intestine by TNF-α; Increased TNF-α levels can trigger epithelial cell death in
  the intestine, which potentially leads to barrier defects and invasion of harmful
  pathogens. Together, this may trigger the intestinal inflammation. B) The NOTCH
  cascade consists of NOTCH and NOTCH ligands, as well as intracellular proteins transferring
  the NOTCH signal to nucleus of the cells
