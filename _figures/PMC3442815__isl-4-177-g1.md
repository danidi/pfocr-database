caption: Figure 1. Ceramide synthesis. The first step of de novo ceramide synthesis
  involves the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine by serine palmitoyltransferase.
  Other long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, commonly 14 to 26 carbons long can also be incorporated
  as a side-chain following sphinganine synthesis by 3-ketosphinganine reductase (not
  shown, see ) by the action of ceramide synthases 1–6. These synthases, also known
  as longevity assurance homologs (Lass) 1–6, have different chain length specificities
  in regard to their fatty acyl-CoA substrates. Following ceramide breakdown to its
  sphingosine backbone by neutral or acidic ceramidases (CDase) within different subcellular
  compartments, the sphingosine is transported out of the lysosome and can be reincorporated
  back into ceramide via ceramide synthase. This salvage pathway of ceramide synthesis
  utilizes the same ceramide synthases involved in the de novo pathway.
