caption: Proposed model for the integration of NFAT and NF-κB signalling pathwaysSwollen
  AF conidia are taken up by macrophages. The AF-containing phagosome rapidly acidifies,
  resulting in the activation of endosomal PRRs such as TLR9. TLR9 signalling drives
  BTK activation, which in turn activates phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) by phosphorylation.
  PLCγ activation initiates the calcium flux required for calcineurin-mediated NFAT
  translocation into the nucleus. Additionally, NF-κB translocation is activated from
  the cell surface and acts in synergy with NFAT for TNF-α production. TNF-α secretion
  results in neutrophil recruitment which is the cell type required for efficient
  fungal clearance.
