caption: MiR-21 silences the transcriptional regulator PPARα and many of the downstream
  enzymes in fatty acid metabolism that are also regulated by PPARα, including transporters
  and enzymes (shown in grey) of the β-oxidation metabolic pathway of fatty acids
  that occurs in peroxisomes and mitochondria. The consequence of miR-21 activity
  is to reduce metabolism of fatty acids. In addition, miR-21 increases reactive oxygen
  species and toxin formation/accumulation. First, by suppressing peroxisome formation
  and activity, the metabolism of H2O2 is retarded by miR-21, and second, miR-21 silences
  genes that inhibit ROS generation in mitochondria, including MPV17-like which exerts
  its inhibitory function by binding to the mitochondrial protease HrtA2. In this
  configuration HrtA2 is also anti-apoptotic.
