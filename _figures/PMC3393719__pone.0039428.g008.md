caption: '(A) pam16-I61N strain. Nuclear, mitochondrial, and peroxisome associated
  negative genetic interactions leading to a SSL phenotype are indicated in blue.
  These interactions demonstrate the importance of Pam16 in mitochondrial protein
  import, Rpd3L function in the nucleus, peroxisome biogenesis and energy metabolism.
  Defects in Pam16 result in rudimentary mitochondria and impaired fermentation and
  oxidative phosphorylation. The increase in C18αHP likely results from the Isc1 mediated
  breakdown of complex sphingolipids. The inability of pam16-I61N to induce peroxisomes
  results in decreased beta-oxidation of VLCFA. (B) pam16-I61N sur4Δ strain. Negative
  genetic interactions leading to a SSL phenotype are indicated in blue. Deletion
  of any one of five genes (red bold font) resulted in a block in the sphingolipid
  biosynthesis pathway (red bar) suppressing the fermentative growth defect of pam16-I61N.
  The pam16-I61N sur4Δ stain has morphologically restored mitochondria, increased
  numbers of inducible peroxisomes and wt levels of C18 alpha-hydroxy-phytoceramide.
  Metabolic intermediates and complex sphingolipids synthesized in the endoplasmic
  reticulum and Golgi are shown in bold font. Green arrows indicate changes up (increased)
  or down (reduced). Abbreviations: DHS: dihydrosphingosine; DHSP: dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate;
  PHS: phytosphingosine; PHSP: phytosphingosine-1-phosphate; VLCFA: very long chain
  fatty acid.'
