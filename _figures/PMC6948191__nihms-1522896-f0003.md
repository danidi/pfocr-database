caption: Radiation and genotoxic agents can lead to activation of the cGAS/STING pathway
  intrinsically in tumor cells as well as in dendritic cells. Altered cell cycle machinery
  in tumor cells allows progression through mitosis despite DNA damage, leading to
  the accumulation of cGAS positive nuclei. Epigenetic therapy with DNA methyltransferase
  inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can derepress endogenous
  retroviruses (ERVs) in a mechanism termed virus mimicry. Targeted therapies such
  as CDK4/6 inhibitors have also been shown to promote interferon signaling through
  this mechanism. Changes in RNA binding proteins can lead to unshielding of dsRNA,
  allowing RIG-I activation. Chemotherapy, such as adriamycin, can activate TLR3 signaling
  to promote anti-tumor immune responses. Oncolytic viruses have multi-faceted effects
  on innate immune signaling through activation of PRR and promotion of immunogenic
  cell death (ICD). Direct STING and TLR agonists are also being developed.
