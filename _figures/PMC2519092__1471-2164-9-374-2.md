caption: Cellular responses after six hours exposure to L. plantarum. After continuous
  injection of L. plantarum WCFS1 for six hours into the proximal duodenum, proteins
  involved in fatty acid metabolism, cell motility and immune responses were modulated.
  Genes encoding proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism are in the upper left
  area of the image, those involved in cell motility (may include genes expressed
  in immune cells) are in the central area, and genes involved in innate and adaptive
  immune response are in the upper right area. Note the modulated ERK/MAPK/MKP-1 signalling
  pathway that extends into the nucleus.
