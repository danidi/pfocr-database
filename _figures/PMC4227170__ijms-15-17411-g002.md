caption: CD147 plays an important role in a variety of cells and tissues regardless
  of health or disease. (A) T cell-mediated immune response; (1) The regulatory role
  of CD147; (2) The “negative” regulatory role of CD147 as shown by CD147 knockdown
  (KD), leading to increased T cell proliferation; (3) CD147 regulates the ABCG2-driven
  transport of methotrexate; (B) Regulating the expression, dimerization and drug
  transporter function of ABCG2; (4) CD147–ABCG2 complex on the lymphoma cell membrane;
  (5) CD147 and ABCG2 mediate multidrug resistance in breast cancer (BC); (6) EGFR
  promotes multidrug resistance; (7) CD147, CD44 and EGFR signaling pathways cooperate
  to regulate invasiveness; (8) The phospholipase A2- and 5-lipoxygenase-catalyzed
  pathway and CD147 stimulate fibroblast MMP-2 release; (C) Tumor cell-Mφ interactions
  promote angiogenesis; (9) CD147 enhances the monocytic secretion of MMP-9 and VEGF,
  while inhibition of its expression decreases the induction of these two pro-angiogenic
  proteins; (10) KSHV activation of CD147 induces P13K/Akt- and MAPK-dependent secretion
  of VEGF; (D) The effects of CD147 on trophoblastic function; (11) Under progesterone-rich
  conditions, CD147 regulates MMPs and PLGF during gestation; (E) Regulating the proliferation,
  anoikis, migration and metastasis of HCCs; (12) Caveolin-1 promotes HCC invasion
  by up-regulating the glycosylation of CD147; (13) CD147 mediates resistance to anoikis
  in HCC cells by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway; (14) The key role of GnT–IVa in
  the migration and metastasis of HCCs involves alteration of the antennary oligosaccharide
  structures on glycosylated CD147; (F) Regulating the metastasis and chemoresistance
  of PCa cells; (15) CD147 expression is mediated by the PI3K and MAPK pathways; (16)
  CD147 KD decreases MCT4 and multi-drug resistance protein-2(Mdrp2) expression and
  reduces the invasive potential and proliferation of PCa while enhancing docetaxel
  sensitivity; (17) CD147 KD down-regulates p-Akt and p-Erk, the main signal modulators
  associated with cell growth and survival; (G) Regulating the migration and metastasis
