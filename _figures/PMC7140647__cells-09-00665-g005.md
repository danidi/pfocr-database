caption: Model of different potential contributing players and their pathways activated
  in proposed antibody-dependent NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the thyroid gland
  of AITD patients. (1) The depletion of IgG core fucose was associated with TPOAb
  level and AITD status []. (2) The IgG N-glycan traits associated with AITD were
  also associated with a subpopulation of NK cells in our current study; for example,
  the depletion of IgG core fucose is associated positively with NK cells with the
  patterns of co-receptors CD335− or CD335− CD158b+ CD314+. (3) Previous studies showed
  that afucosylated antibodies had increased affinity for binding to CD16 (FcγRIIIa),
  cell receptors of NK cells, and to enhance ADCC [,,,] via (4) protein tyrosine kinase-dependent
  pathways, through crosstalk with (5) NKG2D receptor (CD314) [,]. (6) Two SNPs, rs3094228
  and rs1521, were associated with GD and TPOAb-positivity [,,] and fall in gene regulatory
  regions of the MIC-A and MIC-B genes and increase their expression in thyroid cells
  []. These two genes encode heavily glycosylated proteins that are ligands for the
  NKG2D type II receptor (CD314). (7) The KIR2DL (CD158b) receptor is known to regulate
  the cytotoxicity of NK cells by unknown pathways, whereas (8) the NCR1 (CD335) receptor
  can contribute to the increased potency of activated NK cells to mediate cell lysis
  by unknown pathway [,]. (9) The SNP, rs1521 associated with GD [], is also shown
  to reduce the expression of HLA-C gene, producing the ligand of CD158b, in thyroid
  cells [,,,]. (10) All together (the binding of NK cells with target cells through
  antibodies and their ligands), these lead to the activation of NK cells, which release
  cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes. This release mediates ADCC
  of target cells (3), which are thyrocytes in AITD. Also, (11) a positive association
  between the circulation abundance of Caspase-2 protein and AITD were found in this
  study that could be associated with the destruction of thyrocytes. (12) A positive
  correlation of circulating abundance of IL-1α with AITD was also found in the bloodstream
  that could be a marker of lymphocyte infiltration in the thyroid gland of individuals
  with AITD, and thus of inflammation [,].
