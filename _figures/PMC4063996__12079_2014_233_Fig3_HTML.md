caption: Neuregulin-ErbB4 signaling pathway. When NRG binds to ErbB4, two successive
  enzymatic cleavages occur. First TACE cleaves ErbB4 at the cell surfact (1), releasing
  the ectodomain. The second cleavage is carried out by gamma secretase (2) and releases
  the intracellular domain peptide called 4ICD. Next 4ICD binds to chaperone proteins
  (3) such as the YAP/14-3-3 complex that escort 4ICD into the nucleus where it binds
  to DNA (4) and regulates gene expression (5)
