caption: Schematic illustration of the targets of actions by spermidine in different
  pathways. The function of spermidine in anti-aging and resistance to stress is conserved
  in evolution. It acts through autophagy-independent pathway(s) as well as mTOR-independent
  autophagy pathway. By activating the autophagy, spermidine inhibits α-synuclein
  toxicity in two PD animal models, as demonstrated by Büttner et al.
