caption: Figure 7. Role of a novel pathway of acyl-CoA synthesis in human islets.
  Human islets are characterized by elevated succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase
  (SCOT) and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AAS), which form mitochondrial acetoacetate
  and permit the formation of cytosolic acyl-CoA respectively. This pathway may be
  more active in human compared with rodent β-cells due to lower pyruvate carboxylation
  as a result of lowered PC expression and activity (and thus greater pyruvate decarboxylation
  via PDC) compared with rodent islets. ACAT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; CIC, citrate isocitrate carrier; FAS, fatty
  acid synthase; MPC, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDC,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; SCOT, succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase.
