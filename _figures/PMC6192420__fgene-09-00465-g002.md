caption: Overview of the vitamin D metabolic pathway. Vitamin D3 is obtained from
  the diet or by photoconversion in the skin. It is converted to its active form,
  1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D3 or calcitriol, by two consecutive hydroxylation steps, first
  in the liver and then in the kidneys. Calcitriol travels to its target organs (bones,
  intestines, kidneys) bound to vitamin D binding protein (DBP). It mediates its biological
  effects by activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which in turn modulates the
  expression of several genes involved in calcium homeostasis. Genes identified in
  the whole-genome scan are highlighted in red.
