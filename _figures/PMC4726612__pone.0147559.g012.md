caption: This schematic diagram shows potential mechanisms of calcium role through
  CaMKK stimulation in chicken sperm. They all activate AMPK and CaMKI, which leads
  to metabolic improvements, leading themselves to the control of sperm functions.
  Solid arrows and blocked arrows illustrate more established relationships between
  stimuli, signals, improved metabolic status and control of avian sperm functions.
  Solid black arrows indicate Ca2+/CaMKKs/AMPK signaling pathway. Dashed black arrows
  indicate Ca2+/CaM/CaMKKs/CaMKI signaling pathway. Curved arrows (black) indicate
  AMPK phosphorylation, CaMKI phosphorylation; dashed grey arrows with a question
  mark are used for hypotheses.
