caption: Necroptosis and pyroptosis both lead to the loss of cell membrane integrity.
  Necroptosis can be initiated by extracellular ligands interacting with their cognate
  cell surface receptors (DRs, death receptors; TLR, Toll-like receptors) or by varied
  intracellular stress signals (physicochemical stress). One pathway involves activation
  of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which leads to mitochondrial malfunction. Intracellular stress
  can also activate PARP1, which can signal for mitochondrial dysfunction potentially
  involving RIPK1 (sometimes referred to as the parthanatos death pathway). The inflammasome
  (NLR/ASC) may signal directly for necroptosis induction or indirectly via caspase
  1 leading to pyroptosis, which also results in cell lysis but induces DNA degradation
  similar to apoptotic cell death. Caspase 11 can signal directly for a pyroptosis-like
  cell death or indirectly via NLR/ASC to activate caspase 1–dependent pyroptosis
  signaling. The cell may attempt to inhibit cell membrane lysis either by recruitment
  of lysosomal membranes to the cell surface to repair the cell membrane or by cross-linking
  annexin-1 on the cell surface and thus leading to formation of a stable apoptotic
  envelope. Necrotic cell death is inflammatory as it leads to spilling of the intracellular
  contents into the extracellular milieu. Mtb has been associated with both the induction
  of necrosis pathways and the inhibition of the inhibitory mechanisms. Programmed
  necrosis of Mtb-infected host cells leads to bacterial escape, whereas the associated
  inflammatory response recruits new host cells for extracellular Mtb to infect and
  replicate in, thus leading to dissemination of infection.
