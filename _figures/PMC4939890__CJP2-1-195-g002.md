caption: 'Schematic of pathophysiological mechanisms involved in bicuspid aortic valve
  (BAV). Dysregulation of NO signaling is suspected to play a role in the osteogenic
  transition of VICs through the Wnt pathway. Increased content of PGs and GAGs and
  disorganised tissue architecture could also promote lipid retention and increase
  the bioavailability of TGF‐β1. In addition, elevated mechanical strain promotes
  the production of BMP2‐4, collagen type III and cathepsins K, S, which participate
  in tissue remodelling in the BAV. TGF: transforming growth factor, BMP: bone morphogenetic
  protein, eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase, Lrp5: low‐density lipoprotein
  receptor‐related protein 5, Runx2: runt‐related transcription factor 2, NPP1: ecto‐nucleotide
  pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1, ALP: alkaline phosphatase, ROCK: Rho‐associated
  protein kinase, NICD: Notch1 intracellular domain, Hrt: Hairy‐related family of
  transcription factors.'
