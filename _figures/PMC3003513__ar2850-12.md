caption: 'Inhibitory effects of resveratrol and curcumin on IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation
  and apoptosis in primary human chondrocytes in vitro. IL-1β stimulates the IL-1β
  receptor, intiating an intracellular signal transduction cascade, which activates
  the cytoplasmic IκBα kinases (IKK)-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ. These kinases phosphoryle
  inactive IκBα. Phosphorylated IκBα is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome
  and active NF-κB is released. NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, where it activates
  proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic gene production. In chondrocytes, resveratrol
  and curcumin both inhibit the NF-κB signal transduction pathway but in different
  ways: resveratrol inhibits ubiquitination of phosphorylated IκBα, and blocks translocation
  of the activated NF-κB to the nucleus. In a similar fashion to resveratrol, curcumin
  also inhibits translocation of the activated NF-κB to the nucleus. However in contrast
  to resveratrol, curcumin does not have a degradation inhibiting effect on phosphorylated
  IκBα. Instead, curcumin inhibits IL-1β signalling at an earlier point by inhibition
  of IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ.'
