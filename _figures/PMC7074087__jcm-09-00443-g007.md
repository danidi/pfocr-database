caption: PC inhibitor attenuated glycolytic shift and metabolic reprogramming in pulmonary
  hypertension. In the sugen/hypoxic PAH model, phosphorylation of Akt upregulated
  cellular glucose uptake and glycolysis. This results in decreased oxidative phosphorylation,
  increased anaplerosis, and a reduction in glycogenesis. Increased anaplerosis and
  lactic acidosis feed-forward increased cellular proliferation and vascular remodeling
  in PAH. PC inhibitor treatment balanced cellular glucose influx, glycogen synthesis,
  and raised pentose phosphate pathway. As a result, glycolytic shift and improved
  oxidative phosphorylation returned back to control by inhibiting the key anaplerotic
  enzyme, PC, in PAH. Thus, proliferative pathological changes in PAH were found to
  be preserved with PC inhibitor treatment. PAH—pulmonary arterial hypertension, iPC–PC
  inhibitor, GSK3β–Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, G6PD–glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase,
  LDHA—lactate dehydrogenase—A, PC–pyruvate carboxylase, PDH—pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  OAA—oxaloacetate, TCA—tricarboxylic acid cycle, PAH—pulmonary arterial hypertension.
