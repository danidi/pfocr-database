caption: (A) DEGs between BU and EG, associated to the KEGG cell cycle pathway in
  the KEGG database. All except one gene are up-regulated. Up-regulated genes are
  boxed red, down-regulated genes are boxed green. Asterisks indicate genes for which
  DGE data was verified by relative Q-PCR (). (B) DEGs between EG and EL, associated
  to the KEGG cell cycle pathway in the KEGG database. All except one gene are down-regulated.
  Up-regulated genes are boxed red, down-regulated genes are boxed green. Asterisks
  indicate genes for which DGE data was verified by relative Q-PCR ().
