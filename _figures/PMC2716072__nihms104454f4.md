caption: mTOR signaling pathway. This pathway is stimulated by a number of extracellular
  stimuli, including nutrients, growth factors, stress and viral infection. Signaling
  generated by these stimuli is relayed to downstream effectors by the mTORC1 complex.
  The mTORC1 can be inhibited by rapamycin treatment. The upstream activators of the
  mTORC2 complex however are currently unknown and mTORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin
  treatment. Upon activation, the mTORC1 complex phosphorylates 4E-BPI and S6K resulting
  in their dissociation from the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, and initiation factor
  3(eIF3)respectively. This signals to impact downstream events including ribosome
  biogenesis, translation and cell growth. The effector molecules of mTOR pathway
  are targeted and modified by many viruses to preferentially translate their own
  mRNA as explained in the text. The Sm t-Ag of polyomaviruses also targets this pathway
  at different levels as indicated.
