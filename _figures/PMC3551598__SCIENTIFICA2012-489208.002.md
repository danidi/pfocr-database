number: Figure 2
caption: Comparison of GlcNAc synthesis pathways in fungi and bacteria. C. albicans
  and bacteria such as E. coli are thought to sense forms of GlcNAc (shown in red)
  that are not intermediates in the cellular hexosamine synthesis pathway. De novo
  synthesis pathways for GlcNAc are shown in black.
