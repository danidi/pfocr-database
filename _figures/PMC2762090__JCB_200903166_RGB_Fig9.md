caption: Model for synapse stabilizing effects of MAPK signaling. (A–C) Effects of
  stress on MAPK signaling. (A) In the absence of cellular stress this JNK-Fos pathway
  is at steady state (shown in black) and is not necessary for endogenous synapse
  stability. (B) Acute cellular stress (e.g., cytoskeletal disruption) induces activation
  (shown in red) of JNK and Fos, which enhances synapse stabilization. The elevation
  of Fos is transient. (C) In the presence of a persistent cellular stress, negative
  feedback via the phosphatase Puckered prevents reactivation of Fos and the neuron
  switches toward a state that favors disassembly or instability. (D–F) Experimental
  manipulations (shown in blue) that result in enhanced synapse stability in the presence
  of a persistent cellular stress. (D) Fos overexpression results in enhanced stability.
  (E) Loss of Puckered-dependent feedback inhibition promotes synapse stability, likely
  through enhanced Fos activity. (F) Loss of Highwire potentiates upstream MAPK signaling,
  acting through Fos to promote synapse stability.
