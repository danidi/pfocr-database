caption: This figure illustrates the known AJ and TJ proteins expressed by the human
  BNB in vitro, and their accessory or regulatory proteins and their membrane localization
  guided by knowledge of other restrictive barrier forming endothelial cells. There
  is immunocytochemistry evidence for ZO-1, ZO-2, claudin-5, occludin and VE-Cadherin
  expression at intercellular contact sites, without direct evidence for claudin-12
  and claudin-19. pHEndEC β-catenin expression has been demonstrated by PCR and western
  blot. GFRα1, the receptor for GDNF, complexed with RET, is expressed by pHEndECs,
  and mediates recovery of restrictive barrier characteristics at the human BNB in
  vitro following serum withdrawal, dependent on RET-tyrosine kinase mediated signaling.
  There is preliminary evidence that the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway acts downstream
  of RET, with the net effect being cytoskeletal reorganization of F-actin filaments,
  with relocation towards the cytoplasmic membrane and intercellular contact sites,
  providing the scaffold for more continuous AJ and TJ and fewer intercellular clefts.
  Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), acting via protein kinase A (PKA) has been
  shown to play a minor role in this process, independent of GDNF, with a mild additive
  effect observed when multiple mitogens are administered to induce pHEndEC recovery
  from diffuse endothelial injury. Schwann cells and pericytes are potential cellular
  sources for GDNF in peripheral nerves.
