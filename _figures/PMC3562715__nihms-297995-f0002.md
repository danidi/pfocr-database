caption: Oncogenic pathways in ABC-DLBCLThe stimulation of several surface receptors,
  including the B-cell receptor (BCR), CD40 or Toll-like receptors, triggers signaling
  cascades resulting in the activation of the NF-kB pathway. In ABC-DLBCL, NF-kB is
  constitutively activated and several genetic lesions that contribute to this activation
  have been identified.
