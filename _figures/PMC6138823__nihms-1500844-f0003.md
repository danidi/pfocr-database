caption: 'ApoA-I is mainly produced by hepatocytes and enterocytes. HDL synthesis
  begins with the interaction of ApoA-I with ABCA1 that mediates cholesterol efflux
  to produce nascent discoid HDL. Discoid HDL are converted into spherical HDL3 by
  LCAT. HDL3 are then enriched in cholesterol through their interaction with ABCG1
  in peripheral tissues to transform into mature HDL2. HDL2 are ligands for SR-BI
  that ensures cholesterol influx into hepatocytes or into steroidogenic tissues.
  Alternatively, cholesterol returns to the liver via the CETP pathway: CETP mediates
  the transfer of CE on Apo-B-containing lipoproteins that are captured by hepatocytes
  through LDLR (see ).'
