caption: The NDT80 transcriptional induction pathway. The sequential steps leading
  to the expression of the NDT80 promoter are shown. The shaded box represents distinct
  chromatin structures at the NDT80 promoter that may be generated as the indicated
  regulatory transitions take place. Although the NDT80 promoter contains 2 URS1s
  and 2 MSEs (one which is Sum1 repressible and Ndt80 inducible and a second that
  is exclusively Ndt80 inducible), only a single URS1 and the Sum1-repressible/Ndt80-inducible
  MSE are shown. Ime1 is present at early (URS1-containing) promoters as they are
  expressed and is therefore predicted to be present after step 1. However, the mechanism
  that tethers Ime1 to early promoters is unresolved, and for simplicity its presence
  at URS1 is not diagrammed. See the text for details.
