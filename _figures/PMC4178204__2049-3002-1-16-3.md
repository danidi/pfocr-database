caption: Under normal cell metabolism G6P entering the oxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) is converted to ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) and xylulose 5-phsophate
  (X5P). Both can be further metabolized through the non-oxidative pathway to ultimately
  form fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) that re-enters
  the glycolytic pathway to continue catabolism for ATP production. In cancer, reduced
  activity of M2-PK leads to an excess of F6P and G3P that can be shunted back into
  the non-oxidative pathway for anabolism. Mediated through transaldolase (TA) and
  the TPP-dependent enzyme TKT, F6P and G3P are converted to R5P for biosynthesis
  of nucleotides.
