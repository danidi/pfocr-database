caption: N-Glycan biosynthetic pathways in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),
  iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and human cardiomyocytes. The code numbers, symbolic
  representations, and linkages of N-glycans are defined in . The hypothetical pathway
  map is constructed based on the generally accepted N-glycan biosynthetic pathways
  []. ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4, ST6GAL1, MGAT3, and MGAT4 indicate glycosyltransferases presumed
  to be functional at those points.
