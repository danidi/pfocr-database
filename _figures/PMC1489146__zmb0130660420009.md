caption: Met activates FAK through both the Met-Src-FAK pathway (our previous studies)
  and the Met-FAK pathway (this study). The activated FAK functions as a signaling
  platform to potentiate HGF-elicited signals, thereby contributing to HGF-stimulated
  cell motility and cell invasion. Note that the ability of FAK to promote HGF-stimulated
  invasion relies largely on its direct interaction with Met (see Discussion for details).
  P, phosphorylation.
