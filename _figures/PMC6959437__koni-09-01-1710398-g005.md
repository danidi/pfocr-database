caption: Schematic for intracellular APM components. Antigen processing is an intracellular
  pathway whereby endogenous or foreign proteins are broken down into peptides by
  the proteasome, transported into the endoplasmic reticulin, loaded onto MHC class
  I, and transported to the cell surface for recognition by the adaptive immune system.
  Several proteases, transporters and chaperones are involved.

papertitle: ASTX660, an antagonist of cIAP1/2 and XIAP, increases antigen processing
  machinery and can enhance radiation-induced immunogenic cell death in preclinical
  models of head and neck cancer.
