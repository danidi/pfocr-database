caption: Molecular mechanism of crosstalk between the BR, auxin and GA signaling pathways
  which enables regulation of various physiological and developmental processes in
  rice and other monocots. Transcription factors are shown as ovals, other proteins
  are depicted as rectangles. Green arrows indicate stimulation, whereas red lines
  with the bullet points represent suppression. Detailed description is given in the
  text.
