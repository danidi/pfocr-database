caption: Metabolic cooperativity between oocytes and cumulus cells, and the role of
  oocyte-derived paracrine factors in promoting metabolism in cumulus cells. Oocytes
  are deficient in metabolizing glucose by glycolysis, synthesizing cholesterol from
  acetate and taking up alanine directly, as compared with cumulus cells. Oocytes
  obtain products of the glycolysis (e.g., pyruvate) and cholesterol biosynthesis
  (e.g., cholesterol) pathway, as well as alanine from cumulus cells. Oocytes, via
  secreting paracrine factors, promote these metabolic processes in cumulus cells
  by promoting the expression of transcripts encoding key enzymes in the corresponding
  pathways, as well as the expression Slc38a3 encoding an amino acid transporter for
  L-alanine. GDF9 and BMP15 are involved in promoting cholesterol biosynthesis in
  cumulus cells, while cooperation between BMP15 and FGFs are required for promoting
  glycolysis. Which oocyte-derived paracrine factor(s) participate in the induction
  of Slc38a3 expression, as well as L-alanine uptake by cumulus cells are unknown.
