caption: Schematic illustration of the CLA-regulated biological pathway during carcinogenic,
  adipose, diabetic, and cardiovascular diseases. CLA conjugated to nuclear receptors
  such as PPARs combines with a counterpart nuclear receptor named RXR to transcriptionally
  downregulate the target genes related to lipid metabolism including cellular differentiation
  of adipocytes, cancer cells, inflammatory cells, and pancreatic cells []. CLA, conjugated
  linoleic acid; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, peroxisome
  proliferator responsive element; RXR, retinoid X receptor. Figure adapted from Yang,
  B. et al. [].
