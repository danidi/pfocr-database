caption: Models for the effects of inactivation versus activation of the Rb pathway.
  (A) Loss of Rb leads to ectopic DNA synthesis, increased cell death, and incomplete
  differentiation. Unscheduled cell proliferation is often counteracted by apoptosis
  but in some cell types results in neoplastic transformation, that is, retinoblastoma
  in human and pituitary tumors in the mouse. Inhibition of proapoptotic pathways
  (e.g., inactivation of p53) cooperates with loss of Rb during cancer progression.
  Impaired differentiation in Rb-deficient mice may be an indirect effect due to the
  ectopic cell proliferation and apoptosis that perturb the differentiation program.
  Alternatively, Rb may be required for the onset of terminal differentiation via
  direct or indirect stimulation of differentiation factors (e.g., glucocorticoid
  receptor, C/EBP, MyoD, etc.). (B) As shown in this study, activation of Rb in the
  mammary gland results in suppression of cell proliferation, precocious differentiation,
  extended survival of the mammary epithelium, and mammary tumors. The precocious
  differentiation may reflect the ability of activate Rb to extend the survival of
  differentiated cells and/or to directly promote differentiation. We propose that
  inhibition of apoptosis by active Rb can lead to the accumulation of oncogenic alterations
  and neoplastic transformation in susceptible tissues such as the mammary epithelium.
