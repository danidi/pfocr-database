number: Fig. 1
caption: Schematic diagram and proposed model for the metabolic regulation and coordination
  of the leptin mediated reproductive and nutritional axes. Leptin, insulin and IGF-1
  are shown as the most critical circulatory factors that act on hypothalamic and
  other brain networks to regulate food intake and GnRH secretion. The pathway, rich
  in redundancies, depicts the various direct and indirect inputs that converge on
  GnRH neurons. The crosstalks of the reproductive and nutritional axes are represented
  by the projections of the AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons to the KNDy neurons and by the
  AgRP/NPY neurons onto GnRH neurons. The first order leptin responsive neurons in
  the PMV and other hypothalamic areas are denoted with a thick green arrow to highlight
  their essential reproductive function and the release of the NO neurotransmitter.
  Ligands and receptors are shown on each set of neurons and green/red arrows represent
  stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively. The postulated elusive leptin
  intermediate neurons are denoted with a question mark. Acronyms in the figure are
  found in the text.
