caption: Regulatory network of ABA homoeostasis. The pathways which have been already
  reported are shown with solid arrows, while those unclear pathways are depicted
  by dotted arrows. The blue arrows represent de novo ABA biosynthetic pathway, green
  lines represent ABA catabolic pathway, red arrows represent reversible glycosylation
  of ABA, and black arrows indicate the direction of ABA transporters. Plasma membrane-located
  ABA transporters are pictured by different colors (green for ABA influx transporters
  and purple for ABA efflux transporters). Putative ABA and ABA-GE transporters at
  plasma membrane and various subcellular organelles are labeled by question marks.
