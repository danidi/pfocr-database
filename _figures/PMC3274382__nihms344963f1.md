caption: Diverse roles for ISGs in the IFN antiviral pathway. Incoming viruses are
  sensed by pattern reecognition receptors (PRR), leading to activation of interferon
  regulatory factors (IRFs) and transcriptional induction of IFNs. Antiviral IFNs
  signal through the JAK/STAT pathway to induce ISG production. ISGs can also be directly
  induced by some IRFs in an IFN-independent pathway (thin blue arrow). Some ISGs
  function to block virus replication (thick red bars), while others have the ability
  to promote or enhance replication of certain viruses (green arrow). A subset of
  ISGs are themselves components of the IFN pathway or promote its signaling (red
  dotted arrows). IFN also induces several negative regulators which can target PRR,
  IRFs, or JAK/STAT to dampen the response (thin red bars).
