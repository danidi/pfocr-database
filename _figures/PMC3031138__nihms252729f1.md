caption: 'Based on published reports, MA-transporters are subject to regulation at
  the levels of transcription, translation and functional delivery. Presynaptic homo-
  and hetero- receptors can trigger specific signaling cascades and hence MA transporter
  regulation to maintain normal amine neurotransmission. At the gene level, transporter
  gene transcription can be regulated by many cellular signals and transcription factors.
  At the protein level, MA transporters may be organized as a complex in the plasma
  membrane motifs (lipid rafts versus non-lipid rafts) that can be regulated by several
  cellular mechanisms, such as phosphorylation, protein-protein interactions, and
  ubiquitination. Transporter activity can be regulated through trafficking dependent
  and/or independent mechanisms. Kinase/phosphatase mediated post translational modifications
  such as phosphorylation regulate transporter catalytic functions (amine influx/efflux),
  surface residency or both. At the plasma membrane level, lipid raft microdomains,
  in which MA transporters along with other signalosomes are located, may serve as
  morphological “conveyers” of signal transduction in the milieu of various incoming
  signals. Phosphorylated transporters may be subjected to trafficking dependent or
  independent regulatory mechanisms. Transporters may enter into a regulated endocytic
  pathway and, thus, internalized transporters may be subjected to degradation or
  recycling depending on the signals and cell system. Internalized transporters could
  be dephosphorylated by associated protein phosphatases allowing the return of nonphosphorylated
  transporters to the cell surface. MA transporters such as endogenous amines and
  psychostimulants (substrates or blockers) in concert with other regulatory cascades
  can modulate the retention time of MA transporters at the plasma membrane via activity
  dependent-transporter phosphorylation. Thus, disease linked human coding variants
  can influence activity dependent regulation, thereby, producing an abnormal phenotype.
