caption: 'Classical and non-classical pathways of androgen biosynthesis. Cholesterol
  is converted to C21 precursors (pregnenolone and progesterone) by the action of
  StAR and CYP11A. In the classical pathway (light gray arrows) C21 steroids are converted
  to the C19 adrenal androgens DHEA and androstenedione (AED) by the sequential hydroxylase
  and lyase activity of CYP17A1. The lyase activity of CYP17A1 (which requires the
  cytochrome b5 cofactor) favors production of DHEA rather than 17-OH pregnenolone
  (dotted arrows indicate low activity). DHEA (from intrinsic or circulating sources
  depending on the tissue) is subsequently acted on by HSD3B to form AED and HSD17B3
  (or AKR1C3) to form testosterone which is converted to 5α-DHT via SRD5A. In tissues
  with expression of CYP19A1, estrone and estradiol can be generated from AED and
  T, respectively. In the backdoor pathway (hatched arrows) the progesterone intermediates
  are acted on first by the activity of SRD5A and the reductive activity of AKR1C2
  prior to the lyase activity of CYP17A1. Androsterone is then acted on by HSD17B3
  (or AKR1C3) and must undergo an oxidative step mediated by RL-HSD (or others) to
  generate 5α-DHT. In a third pathway, termed the 5α-Androstanedione pathway (dark
  gray arrows) DHEA and AED are produced as in the classical pathway. However, instead
  of conversion of AED to T followed by the activity of SRD5A to produce 5α-DHT, the
  enzymatic sequence is reversed such that AED is converted first by SRD5A to 5α-Androstanedione
  and then by HSD17B3 (or AKR1C3) to 5α-DHT. Modified from Best Practice & Research
