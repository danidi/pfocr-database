caption: 'Highlighting the main factors controlling the physiology of 2-AG at post-synaptic
  sites of generation and release as well as pre-synaptic signalling by CB receptors
  in hippocampus. 2-AG is synthesised in the post-synaptic (excitatory) cell when
  DAG is metabolised by DGL. One of the pathways that DAG can be produced is linked
  to the rise of intracellular calcium concentration, which leads to the production
  of DAG through an as-yet-unknown pathway. The main source of intracellular calcium
  post-synaptically is considered to be due to depolarisation () induced entry through
  L-type VGCCs. A minor source of Ca is due to the leak flux from the ER. Ca exits
  the cytoplasm through PMCA and SERCA pumps. Once 2-AG is synthesised, it is released
  by a putative eCB membrane transporter and activates CB receptors, found pre-synaptically
  (on the inhibitory cell). This results in the splitting of the G protein heterotrimer
  into G and G subunits. The G subunit directly inhibits the N-type VGCCs on the pre-synaptic
  membrane, which puts them into a reluctant state, resulting in the inhibition of
  GABA neurotransmitter release. 2-AG is then returned into the cells by an as-yet-unknown
  eCB transporter where most of it is degraded by MGL. Post-synaptically, 2-AG undergoes
  oxidation by COX-2. Additional information is included in the text. 2-AG: 2-arachidonoylglycerol,
