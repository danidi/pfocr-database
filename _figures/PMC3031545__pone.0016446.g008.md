caption: PTP1B can regulate adipogenesis through insulin-dependent and insulin-independent
  pathways. Activation of cell surface receptors of insulin or IGF1 leads to phosphorylation
  of IRS proteins, activation of PI3K and MAPK pathway, and glucose uptake. Alterations
  in downstream signaling (summarized in Tseng et al. , ) lead to the initiation of
  transcriptional cascades that involve PPARγ, C/EBPs, and PGC1α and cause changes
  that are required for differentiation of brown adipocytes (expression of Glut4 and
  UCP1). PTP1B dephosphorylates IR and IRS1 in differentiated brown adipocytes and
  modulates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, PTP1B regulates LKB1/AMPK
  signaling pathway in differentiated brown adipocytes. Conceivably, PTP1B also could
  modulate other affector(s) of cellular signaling to regulate transcription factors
  and cofactor to influence differentiation. Effects of KO, D/A and K/R on adipose
  differentiation, IR and IRS1 tyrosyl phosphorylation, glucose uptake, and LKB1/AMPK
  signaling are summarized. Alterations in KO, D/A and K/R are indicated with the
  symbol (+) and compared with WT (set at ++). Arrows indicate activation and T-shaped
  lines indicate repression. A dashed line indicates that the connection has not been
  completely established.
