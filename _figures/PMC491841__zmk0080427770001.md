caption: 'Consensus model of the cell cycle control mechanism in budding yeast. (For
  a full justification of this diagram, with references to the original literature,
  see our Web site at http://mpf.biol.vt.edu.) The diagram should be read from bottom
  left toward top right. (In the diagram, Cln2 stands for Cln1 and 2, Clb5 for Clb5
  and 6, and Clb2 for Clb1 and 2; furthermore, the kinase partner of the cyclins,
  Cdc28, is not shown explicitly. There is an excess of Cdc28 and it combines rapidly
  with cyclins as soon as they are synthesized.) Newborn daughter cells must grow
  to a critical size to have enough Cln3 and Bck2 to activate the transcription factors
  MBF and SBF, which drive synthesis of two classes of cyclins, Cln2 and Clb5. Cln2
  is primarily responsible for bud emergence and Clb5 for initiating DNA synthesis.
  Clb5-dependent kinase activity is not immediately evident because the G1-phase cell
  is full of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI; namely, Sic1 and Cdc6). After
  the CKIs are phosphorylated by Cln2/Cdc28, they are rapidly degraded by SCF, releasing
  Clb5/Cdc28 to do its job. A fourth class of “mitotic cyclins,” denoted Clb2, are
  out of the picture in G1 because their transcription factor Mcm1 is inactive, their
  degradation pathway Cdh1/APC is active, and their stoichiometric inhibitors CKI
  are abundant. Cln2- and Clb5-dependent kinases remove CKI and inactivate Cdh1, allowing
  Clb2 to accumulate, after some delay, as it activates its own transcription factor,
  Mcm1. Clb2/Cdc28 turns off SBF and MBF. (Clb5/Cdc28 is probably the other down-regulator
  of MBF.) As Clb2/Cdc28 drives the cell into mitosis, it also sets the stage for
  exit from mitosis by stimulating the synthesis of Cdc20 and by phosphorylating components
  of the APC (see text for details). Meanwhile, Cdc20/APC is kept inactive by the
  Mad2-dependent checkpoint signal responsive to unattached chromosomes. When the
  replicated chromosomes are attached, active Cdc20/APC initiates mitotic exit. First,
  it degrades Pds1, releasing Esp1, a protease involved in sister chromatid separation.
  It also degrades Clb5 and partially Clb2, lowering their potency on Cdh1 inactivation.
  In this model, Cdc20/APC promotes degradation of a phosphatase (PPX) that has been
  keeping Net1 in its unphosphorylated form, which binds with Cdc14. As the attached
  chromosomes are properly aligned on the metaphase spindle, Tem1 is activated, which
  in turn activates Cdc15 (the endpoint of the “MEN” signal-transduction pathway in
  the model). When Net1 gets phosphorylated by Cdc15, it releases its hold on Cdc14.
  Cdc14 (a phosphatase) then does battle against the cyclin-dependent kinases: activating
  Cdh1, stabilizing CKIs, and activating Swi5 (the transcription factor for CKIs).
  In this manner, Cdc14 returns the cell to G1 phase (no cyclins, abundant CKIs, and
  active Cdh1).'
