caption: Hidden gems discovered in the regulation of natural genetic transformation
  in S. mutans. Competence can be triggered in chemically defined medium (CDM) by
  XIP or in rich medium (e.g., TSB) by CSP (aka MIP). Gems illustrated in red indicate
  novel pathways or elements. In CDM, ComS is exported by PptAB and another unknown
  element (Chang and Federle, ), after which the mature XIP is internalized the via
  Opp (Gardan et al., ), then binds to ComR to activates sigX and a comS positive
  feedback loop (Mashburn-Warren et al., ; Khan et al., ; Fontaine et al., ). A “hidden
  gem” was revealed here as XrpA, an internal peptide to sigX that hinders competence
  by inhibiting the ComR-XIP complex to bind the promoter region of sigX (Kaspar et
  al., , ). Following, SigX, the master regulator of competence, activates transcription
  of late transformation genes involved in the DNA uptake machinery and also other
  genes such as lytF (Dufour and Levesque, ; Fontaine et al., ). Two new gems were
  found here as SigX recognizes SigX boxes upstream of ComED (Reck et al., ; aka BlpRH)
  and in the central part of SMU.60, upstream of ComR (Khan et al., ), and thus proximally
  regulates comED and comR. Recently, new evidence indicates that ComS can play a
  role as both an intercellular and an intracellular signal (Underhill et al., ).
  In rich medium, ComC (aka MIP) is exported by ComAB (aka NlmTE; Hui and Morrison,
  ; Hui et al., ; Hale et al., ) into 21-CSP, which is then cleaved by SepM (Hossain
  and Biswas, ) into its most active form 18-CSP (Petersen et al., ). Once it reaches
  the threshold, the mature pheromone activates ComD, a histidine kinase (HK) transmembrane
  receptor, which phosphorylates and, thus, activates the response regulator ComE
  (similarly as in S. pneumonia; Håvarstein et al., ; Pestova et al., ). Such activation
  up-regulates the early genes comABCDE, creating a positive feedback loop, and activates
  a variety of bacteriocin genes (Kreth et al., ). SigX can also be induced in this
  pathway through unknown mechanisms.
