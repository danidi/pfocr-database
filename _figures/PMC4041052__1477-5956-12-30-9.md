caption: Potential mechanism of action of the EAH by reducing expression of proteins
  associated with LOX-1 signaling pathway. The red arrows indicate the modulation
  obtained in this study, for each marker, due to EAH treatment. Numbers 1, 2, 3,
  4 and 5 indicate the stages of the atherosclerosis process.
