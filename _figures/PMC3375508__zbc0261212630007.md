caption: Hypothetical model of Cl− homeostasis regulated by taurine and WNK-SPAK/OSR1
  signaling during perinatal periods. To control the excitatory/inhibitory balance
  mediated by GABA, [Cl−]i is regulated by activation of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling
  pathway via KCC2 inhibition and possibly NKCC1 activation (, , ). In immature neurons,
  taurine is taken up into cells through TauT and activates WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling
  (left). Red arrows and T-shaped bars indicate activation and inactivation, respectively.
  Later (possibly a while after birth), this activation pathway induced by taurine
  diminishes, resulting in release of KCC/NKCC activity (right), whereas SPAK/OSR1
  signaling recovers somewhat upon adulthood. Interestingly, in contrast to kinase
  signaling leading to KCC2 inhibition, other kinases are also known to facilitate
  KCC2 activity (see “Discussion”).
