caption: 'BH4 synthesis. BH4 is synthesized from GTP by a de novo pathway. The conversion
  of GTP to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate by GTPCH is the rate-limiting step of
  this pathway. The salvage pathway generates BH4 from its oxidized forms. The salvage
  pathway is also necessary to convert exogenous sepiapterin into BH4. GTPCH: GTP
  cyclohydrolase I; PTPS: 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase; SR: sepiapterin reductase;
  DHFR: dihydrofolate reductase.'
