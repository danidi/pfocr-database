caption: 'Role of Heat shock protein-27 (HSP27) and clusterin (CLU) in cancer cell
  survival. CLU increases cell survival through mechanisms involving inhibition of
  ER stress, suppressing Bax activation with mitochondrial sequestration of cytochrome
  C, and transcriptional induction of survival genes. Custirsen (OGX-011) acts at
  each of these points by decreasing clusterin expression. HSP27 inhibits apoptosis
  by integrating different signaling pathways, including extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis
  pathways, as well as growth factor pathways. It enhances androgen receptor signaling
  and insulin-like growth factor 1-induced Bad phosphorylation. HSP27 inhibits the
  extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. OGX-427 reduces HSP27 expression
  leading to appoptosis. APAF1: apoptotic protease-activating factor-1; ER: endoplasmic
  reticulum. With permission from Zielinski et al.'
