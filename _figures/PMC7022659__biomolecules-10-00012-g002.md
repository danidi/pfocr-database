caption: 'The figure sketches the current knowledge and the potential relationship
  between consumption of n-6 PUFAs- and SFAs-rich diets, production of pro-inflammatory
  eicosanoids mediators, derangement of microbial ecosystem and increased liability
  to neuropsychiatric diseases (NPDs). The prevalent ingestion of dietary n-6 PUFAs
  (and SFAs) is linked to the drastic alterations of microbiota diversity, inflamed
  microenvironment, overgrowth of harmful bacterial species (e.g., Enterobactericeae),
  metabolic endotoxemia (increased plasma endotoxins, such as LPS) and increased intestinal
  permeability. Besides the upregulation of cyclooxygenases- and lipoxygenases-dependent
  synthesis of eicosanoids, other mechanisms may contribute to dietary n-6 PUFAs/SFAs-induced
  dysbiosis, such as: 1) increased expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and induction
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and 2) decreased synthesis of “specialized pro-resolving
  mediators” (SPMs) including the resolvins (RVs) series E (RvE) and D (RvD). The
  overall picture of systemic metabolic endotoxemia triggers immune dysregulation
  and recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns via toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) and in particular TLR4-dependent synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12). In turn, reduced 5-HT synthesis, altered
  tryptophan metabolism and SCFAs balance contribute to dysfunctional microbiota-to-brain-communication.
  The reported deficits in plasma and brain EPA/DHA levels may further contribute
  to the disruption of DA and 5-HT function and, ultimately, to increased risk of
  depression, SCZ and.'
