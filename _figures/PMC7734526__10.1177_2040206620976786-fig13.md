caption: Intracellular activation pathway for nucleobase (NB) or nucleoside (N) analogues
  and nucleoside 5’-mono- (NMP), -di- (NDP), or -triphosphate (NTP) prodrugs. NB and
  N can traverse the cell membrane by passive or facilitated diffusion while nucleotides
  are held back due to their negative charges. Host phosphatases dephosphorylate NMPs,
  NDPs and NTPs. In the form of prodrugs, these nucleotides are protected from dephosphorylation
  and the charges are masked; therefore, the prodrugs can pass the cell membrane.
  Inside the cell, N or NB are metabolized by host enzymes via NMP and NDP to the
  antivirally active NTP form. Due to insufficient substrate properties of the analogues
  towards the host enzymes, one or more of these steps may be blocked. Prodrugs are
  activated intracellularly by ubiquitous host enzymes or chemical reactions and can
  thus overcome metabolic bottlenecks and deliver the active metabolite.
