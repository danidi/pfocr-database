caption: 'Currently known NAD+/NADH- and NADP+/NADPH-dependent peroxisomal enzymatic
  reactions, transport of NAD+/NADH, NADP+/NADPH, NMNH+, AMP, and 2′,5′-ADP, and role
  of shuttle systems. NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH may be imported into peroxisomes by
  specific transporters or co-imported with fully folded NAD(H)/NADP(H)-dependent
  enzymes. During peroxisomal beta-oxidation, D- and L-bifunctional proteins (DBP
  and LBP) catalyze the second (hydration) and third (dehydrogenation) step of beta
  oxidation. During the dehydrogenation, NAD+ is reduced to NADH. Subsequent reoxidation
  of NADH may be mediated by the three different dehydrogenases located inside peroxisomes:
  LDHB, which converts pyruvate into lactate; MDH1, which converts oxaloacetate into
  malate; GPD1, which converts DHAP into G3P. During beta-oxidation, the double bound(s)
  of mono-/polyunsaturated fatty acids are reduced by the peroxisomal enzyme 2,4-
  dienoyl-CoA reductase (DECR2). During the reduction, NADPH is oxidized to NADP+.
  NADPH is also oxidized by TER during convertion of phytenoyl-CoA into phytanoyl-CoA.
  NADP+ is reduced back to NADPH by IDH1, which converts isocitrate into 2-OG. The
  import and export of small metabolites [pyruvate, lactate, oxaloacetate, malate,
  DHAP, G3P, isocitrate, and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)] is probably mediated by the peroxisomal
  pore-forming proteins (PXMP2, Pex11α, Pex11β, and Pex11γ) that allow passage of
  molecules with a size below 600 Da. The role of another pore-forming protein BAK
  in the permeability of the peroxisomal membrane remains unclear. Monocarboxylate
  transporters MCT1 and MCT2 may be involved in the transport of lactate and pyruvate.
  The pyrophosphatase NUDT12 mediates NADH degradation (to NMNH and AMP) and NADPH
  degradation (to NMNH and 2’,5′-ADP). The products of NADH/NADPH degradation are
  subsequently exported from peroxisomes, probably by PMP34. Enzymatic reactions or
  molecules belonging to the same metabolic pathway are marked with background color
  and listed at the bottom.'
