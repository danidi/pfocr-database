caption: Processing of tumor antigens recognized by CD8+ T cells. CTL recognize peptides
  that are produced by the degradation of cellular proteins by the proteasome. Four
  types of proteasome exist, two of which are represented here (standard proteasome
  and immunoproteasome). Peptides resulting from proteasome degradation are then transported
  in the lumen of the ER by the TAP transporter. Peptides bearing an extended N-terminus
  can be further trimmed by additional proteases such as ERAP1 before being loaded
  on HLA class I molecules with the help of the peptide loading complex, which is
  composed of TAP, tapasin (Tpn), the oxidoreductase ERp57, and the chaperone calreticulin
  (CRT). Peptide/HLA complexes are then transferred to the cell surface through the
  secretory pathway.
