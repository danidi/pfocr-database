caption: During infection Lm- derived CDNs (c-di-AMP) are recognized by the host cell
  cytosolic pathway by binding to BTK-activated DDX41, which in turn recruits STING.
  TBK1 and p38 are subsequently recruited and phosphorylated, facilitating activation
  of IRF3-mediated transcription of Ifnb1. From the data presented here, C3a and C5a,
  via signaling on binding their respective receptors (C3aR and C5aR1), suppress IFN-β
  production at two different stages of this innate CDN-activated cytosolic surveillance
  pathway (shown in red) --- (1) by inhibiting BTK-mediated activation of DDX41 and
  (2) by reduction of DDX41 and STING protein expression.
