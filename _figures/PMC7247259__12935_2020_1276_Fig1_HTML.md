caption: Biogenesis, structure, release, and uptake of exosomes. a Exosome biogenesis
  starts with inward budding of the plasma membrane (endocytosis) and the formation
  of early endosomes. Subsequently, incorporation of cytosolic proteins, lipids, and
  nucleic acids into the endosomes leads to the formation of multivesicular bodies
  (MVBs). Finally, MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane through RabGTPases pathway and
  exosomes are released into the extracellular space. b Exosomes are enriched by multiple
  families of proteins, including tetraspannins (CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82), heat shock
  proteins (Hsc70, Hsp 90, Hsp70, Hsp60), membrane trafficking proteins (Rabs, Annexins),
  proteins involved in MVBs biogenesis (Alix, TSG101, Clathrin), metabolic enzymes
  (GAPDH, ATPase, PGK1), cytoskeletal proteins (actin, vimentin, cofilin, tublin,
  talin), lipid rafts, such as cholesterol, flotillins, ceramides, sphingolipids,
  DNA, RNA species (mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs) and tumor-specific markers. c Once exosomes
  are released into the extracellular space, they can interact with recipient cells
  via direct fusion, endocytosis or receptor-ligand interactions
