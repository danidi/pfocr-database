caption: Major Types of Signaling for Plants during Cold, Drought, and Salt Stress.Representative
  cascades, outputs, biological functions, and examples of mutants with phenotypes
  indicative of defects in the respective biological functions are shown. Type I signaling
  involves the generation of ROS scavenging enzymes and antioxidant compounds as well
  as osmolytes. The involvement of a MAPK pathway in the production of osmolytes in
  plants has not been demonstrated experimentally. Under osmotic stress, altered MAPK
  signaling may contribute to changed cell cycle regulation and growth retardation.
  Type II signaling involves the production of stress-responsive proteins mostly of
  undefined functions. Pathways within Type II signaling are shown in . Type III signaling
  involves the SOS pathway which is specific to ionic stress. Signaling events for
  homologs of SOS3 (SCaBP) and SO2 (PKS) are tentatively grouped with SOS3 and SOS2,
  yet these SCaBP-PKS pathways are not necessarily related to ion homeostasis. Connections
  between different types of signaling events are indicated with dashed lines. Arrows
  indicate the direction of signal flux. Primary sensors are shown to be localized
  in the membrane. Receptors for secondary signaling molecules (2ndSM) are not shown.
