caption: Role of Srs2 in the promotion of PRR. PCNA interacts with DNA polymerases
  to facilitate processive leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. DNA replication
  can stall when a DNA lesion is encountered, and exposure of excess single-stranded
  DNA may lead to Rad51-dependent salvage recombination events. Sumoylation of PCNA
  at K164 and K127 by Ubc9 and Siz1 recruits Srs2 helicase, which actively dismantles
  Rad51 filament on the single-stranded DNA and antagonizes HR. Replication fork stalling
  also triggers monoubiquitylation of PCNA in a manner that depends on Rad6 and Rad18.
  Monoubiquitylated PCNA recruits translesion DNA polymerases to bypass the DNA lesion
  through translesion synthesis pathway (TLS). The Ubc13-Mms2-Rad5 E2 and E3 ensemble
  can further polyubiquitylate PCNA, which activates template switching and error-free
  lesion bypass.
