caption: Schematic diagram of the effector signaling pathways activated during ischemia
  preconditioning. Multiple signaling pathways are activated by ischemia preconditioning
  (IPC) that target different pathological features of the ischemic brain, leading
  to neuroprotection. Ischemia exposure allows for the accumulation of HIF-1α and
  the transcriptional activation of hypoxia regulated genes such as erythropoietin,
  inducible nitric oxide synthase, glycolytic proteins, and vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF). Activation of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway acts
  as a negative regulator of many pro-apoptotic proteins such as GSK3(and BAD; thereby
  maintaining the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in a closed configuration.
  Epsilon PKC (ɛPKC) phosphorylation is associated with the opening of the mitochondrial
  ATP sensitive potassium channels (mtK+-ATP), which provides mitochondrial protection.
  Epsilon PKC activates the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK1/2 signaling pathway, leading to STAT3
  phosphorylation and nuclear translocation through receptor tyrosine kinase activation
  (RTK). In the nucleus, STAT3 enhances COX-2 expression, leading to neuroprotection.
  Recent research suggests that STATs may also play a role in mitochondrial bioenergetics,
  suggesting a possible role of mitochondrial localized STATs in IPC-mediated neuroprotection.
