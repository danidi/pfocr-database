caption: 'Schematic representation of the pathway of starch biosynthesis, its subcellular
  compartmentation, and distribution of flux control in photosynthetic leaves (A)
  and heterotrophic tissues (B). The reactions of the pathway of starch biosynthesis
  are catalyzed by the following enzymes: 1, phosphoglucoisomerase; 2, PGM; 3, AGPase;
  4, SS; 5, SBE; 6, starch-debranching enzyme; 7, inorganic pyrophosphatase; 8, Suc
  synthase; 9 UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase; 10, fructokinase; 11, ATP/ADP translocator;
  12, Glc-6-P/Pi translocator; 13, cytosolic AGPase; and 14, ADP-Glc/ADP translocator
  (steps 13 and 14 are highlighted to be specific for cereal endosperm). The false
  color symbols represent the relative flux control coefficients (C) of the constituent
  enzymes, defined as the relation between the fractional change in enzyme activity
  (Ei) and starch flux (J). Missing symbols represent reactions for which experimental
  data are missing. Data were taken from  and  for leaves and from  for growing potato
  tubers.'
