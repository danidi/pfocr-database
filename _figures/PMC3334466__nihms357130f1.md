caption: 'Duo/Cdc42 pathways. NMDA receptor activity drives calcium influx into the
  dendritic spine, which in turn activates CAMKII which can phosphorylate Duo. Activated
  Duo drives Rac-1 mediated phosphorylation of PAK1. Cdc42 activity also results in
  PAK1 phosphorylation in a Rac-1 independent pathway. Activated PAK1 has opposite
  effects on different downstream pathways: it inhibits MLCK in turn decreasing phosphorylation
  of MLC, but also activates LIMK which inhibits cofilin, an actin depolymerizing
  agent. CAMKII: Calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase II, Rac-1: Ras-related C3 botulinum
  toxin substrate 1, Cdc42: cell division cycle 42. PAK1: p-21 activated kinase 1,
  MLCK: myosin light chain kinase, MLC: regulatory myosin light chain. LIMK1: LIM
  domain kinase.'
