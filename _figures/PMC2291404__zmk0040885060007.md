caption: Model of NHERF1 inhibition of PTH-stimulated ERK1/2 activity. PTH binding
  PTH1R activates adenylyl cyclase and PKA. B-Raf phosphorylated by PKA binds to 14-3-3,
  thereby activating B-Raf. The activated B-Raf subsequently phosphorylates its substrate
  MEK1/2 and stimulates ERK1/2 activation. Akt phosphorylates B-Raf in its regulatory
  domain and decreases B-Raf activation. Higher concentration of PTH stimulates AKT
  activity, which negatively regulates ERK1/2 activity. The magnitude of PTH-stimulated
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation is determined by both PKA and AKT activation. In the presence
  of NHERF1, both B-Raf phosphorylation at position of Ser728 and the association
  of 14- 3-3 with B-Raf are inhibited. NHERF1 also increases the AKT activity and
  negatively regulates ERK1/2 activation, thereby inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
