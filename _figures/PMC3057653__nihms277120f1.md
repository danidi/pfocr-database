caption: Schematic diagram illustrating an overview of cellular injury and inflammatory-mediated
  steps in development of leiomyoma as compared with uterine scar formation caused
  by mechanical injury (i.e., myomectomy and cesarean delivery). Cellular/tissue injuries
  and generation of an inflammatory response, either at a small scale (microenvironment)
  or an extended area (myomectomy/cesarean delivery), results in individual and combined
  regulatory interactions among several proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators.
  These mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, eicosanoids, proteases,
  and extracellular matrix (ECM), activate and cause myoblasts and resident fibroblasts
  differentiation into myofibroblastic phenotype. In addition, possible participation
  of fibrocytes, which are derived from bone marrow and through circulation reside
  at the site of inflamed/injury, as well as transformation of vascular endothelial
  cell into mesenchymal cells, also exist to transform into myofibroblastic phenotype.
  Collectively, myofibroblasts are highly responsive to the action of various mediators,
  including cytokines and chemokines, and they produce and deposit various components
  of ECM that are essential for tissue repair process. Continuous inflammation, excess
  myofibroblastic transformation, and production of large quantity of ECM with concurrent
  reduced degradation represent a pathway that leads to development of either leiomyoma
  and/or scar tissue formation. EGF, endothelial growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth
  factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IGF, insulinlike
  growth factor; IL, interleukin; LT, leukotriene; MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein;
  MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; MMP, metalloproteinase; PAI, plasminogen activator
  inhibitor; PG, prostaglandin; RANTES, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed
  and secreted; TBX, thromboxane; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNF, tumor necrosis
  factor; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
