caption: An epistatic pathway and genetic model for replication slowing in fission
  yeast. (A) Three epistasis groups have been identified with respect to S-phase DNA
  damage checkpoint catalyzed slowing of replication. See text for details. (B) A
  model for checkpoint regulation of replication forks in response to DNA damage.
  See text for details.
