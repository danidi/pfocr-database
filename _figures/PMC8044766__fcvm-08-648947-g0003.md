caption: Canonical signaling of the fibrinolysis pathway. Fibrinolysis is characterized
  by the degradation of a fibrin clot into degradation products by plasmin. Plasmin
  is generated from plasminogen by uPA and tPA. Several serpins and other inhibitors
  provide a tight regulation of this cascade. Substantial promiscuity exists across
  multiple elements of the pathway, providing redundant controls against inappropriate
  activation. AIIt and uPAR are shown as representative canonical fibrinolytic receptors
  for brevity. AIIt, Annexin II tetramer; PAI-1,2,3, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1,
  2, 3; PN-1, Protease Nexin-1; TAFI, Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor;
  tPA, Tissue-type plasminogen activator; uPA, Urokinase-type plasminogen activator;
  uPAR, Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor.
