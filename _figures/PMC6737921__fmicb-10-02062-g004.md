caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for acetylaranotin and boydin derivatives.
  For each step, the genes involved as well as their putative function are depicted
  in pink and blue, respectively. The gene SAPIO_CDS6445, located outside of ETP1828
  gene cluster, corresponds to the best hit against gtmA/tmtA and ataS, the major
  bis-thiomethyltransferase genes responsible for catalyzing the S-methylation step
  leading to the inactivation of gliotoxin and acetylaranotin compounds, respectively
  (; ; ). The CDS10214 denotes an unclustered gene coding for a benzoate para-hydroxylase
  cytochrome P450 potentially responsible for the formation of the dihydrooxepin moiety
  that converts (i) a diacetate intermediate to aranotin via apoaranotin, (ii) boydin
  A to bisdethiobis-(methylthio)-deacetylaranotin via bisdethiobis(methylthio)-deacetylapoaranotin,
  and (iii) boydin B to boydin C. The superscript letters a and b indicate the natural
  products isolated from S. boydii by  and , respectively.
