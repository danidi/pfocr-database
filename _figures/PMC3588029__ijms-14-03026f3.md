caption: Regulation of PGC-1α—this schematic represents the relationship between nutrition,
  circadian clock and other regulatory factors involved in post-translational modification
  of PGC-1α and its consequent impact on metabolic genes and aging. Nutritional availability
  impacts the circadian clock - when energy is replete, TOR results in transcriptional
  regulation of PGC-1α through transcription factor YY1 (see text for details). The
  serine threonine kinase AKT (a key component of insulin signaling pathway) has an
  inhibitory effect (negative regulator) on PGC-1α. In energy deficient situations,
  AMPK has an inhibitory effect on TOR thus inducing PGC-1α and increased mitochondrial
  biogenesis. SIRT1 has a stimulatory deacetylation effect on PGC-1α under conditions
  of fasting and oxidative stress and helps accumulate it in the nucleus. Both TOR
  and AKT feed-back on the circadian clock and regulate it as a pacemaker. The nutrient
  sensitive kinase GSK3β targets PGC-1α for proteasomal mediated degradation and is
  a function of oxidative stress response. PGC-1α by its transcriptional activity
  plays an important role in the expression and activity of many metabolic genes which
  impact longevity.
