caption: '(a) GTPase signaling: Rho-family GTPases regulate the assembly of F-actin
  cytoskeleton that facilitates the closure of plasma membrane wounds. GTPase activity
  is controlled by regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and GTPase
  activating proteins (GAP), which allow GTPases to function in distinct spatial regions
  relative to the wound site. (b) Lipid patterning: The site of injury undergoes local
  modification of lipids after injury, due to local influx and efflux of specific
  lipids, delivery of new lipids by vesicle fusion, and de novo generation of lipids
  caused by the activation of calcium-dependent phospholipases or localized secretion
  of enzymes such as acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). This local change in lipid species
  provides a platform for downstream signaling events carried out by GTPases and protein
  kinases. (c) Potentiation of repair: Localized activation and recruitment of protein
  kinase C to DAG-rich membrane regions near the site of injury triggers a CREB-mediated
  gene transcription pathway that potentiates the repair response for repeat injuries.'
