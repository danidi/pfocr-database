caption: 'HSV-1 deregulates host miRNAs. A schematic representation of reported deregulated
  host miRNAs in HSV-1 infection and miRNAs with pro/antiviral functions. HSV-1 infects
  cells and triggers massive changes in host cell miRNAome. Many miRNAs have been
  found to be upregulated (arrow up within the nucleus) or downregulated (arrow down
  in the nucleus). These miRNAs regulate different host (blue boxes) or viral transcripts
  (light blue box) with functions in (a) regulation of apoptosis, (b) antiviral immunity,
  (c) inhibition of viral replication, and (d) miRNAs with targets not known depicted
  in separate boxes. During early infection (EI), miR-23a is downregulated, while
  later in the infection (LI) miR-23a is upregulated. The exact targets of miR-155
  and miR-146a have not been identified; however, they regulate host immune response
  (yellow boxes) by regulating T-cell differentiation and the arachidonic acid cascade
  (AA cascade) pathway, respectively. Upregulated miR-132 activates Ras by removing
  Ras-GAP, leading to corneal neovascularization (CV). Neuron-specific miR-138 regulates
