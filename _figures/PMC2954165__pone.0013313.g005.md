caption: Our work (green lines) indicates that HHR6/HRad18 can regulate FANCD2 monoubiquitination,
  a hallmark of the activation of the FA pathway (marked with light blue color); and
  FANCD2 can modulate the activity of polymerase eta, an effector of HHR6 pathway
  (highlighted with dark blue color). Upon DNA damage, FANCD2 may partly mediate the
  function of HHR6/hRad18 in HHR6 pathway/PRR; pol eta can as well mediate a part
  of FANCD2 function in maintaining chromosomal stability in the FA signaling. It
  waits for future studies to further define the integration of the FA and HHR6 pathways
  upon genotoxic stresses, such as whether and how the FA complex and hRad18 depend
  on each other in terms of regulation of FANCD2 monoubiquitination?
