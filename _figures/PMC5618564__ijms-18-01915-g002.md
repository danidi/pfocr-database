caption: FAK-deleted keratinocytes demonstrate alterations in key mechanotransduction
  and collagen signaling pathways. The top scoring Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)-constructed
  transcriptome network generated from genes significantly up-regulated (grey) and
  down-regulated (black) in FAK-deleted keratinocytes compared to WT cells were merged
  using IPA’s Ingenuity Knowledge Base, creating a super-network centered on the FAK-AKT-ERK
  axis. Direct relationships are indicated by solid lines, and dashed lines represent
  indirect relationships. Known relationships among molecules across the original
  two networks are represented in magenta. * denotes FAK (PTK2).
