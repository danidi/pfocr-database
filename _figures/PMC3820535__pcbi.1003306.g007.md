caption: 'Graphical representation of glucose system. Red shapes are Petri net places
  (signaling and metabolism), and small black squares on the arrows represent Petri
  net transitions (dashed lines correspond to enzymatic interactions). Green squares
  are Boolean network elements for regulatory components. Blue ovals are also Petri
  net places and correspond to interconnection elements. The Petri-to-Boolean arithmetic
  conditions are noted on/through red arrows (specific values are defined in the section
  of parametrizing the model). The Boolean-to-Petri connections are indicated with
  green arrows. The initial condition defined by vector , is set as follows: all Petri
  net places have 0 tokens except ADP, which has 10 tokens; all Boolean network elements
  are set to 0. See caption of  for more details about the representation.'
