caption: Schematic representation of the crosstalk between the NOTCH and AKT pathways
  at the molecular and cellular levels. (A) Scheme of the molecular pathways. NOTCH
  pathway activation inhibits PTEN expression leading to AKT activation, FOXO phosphorylation,
  and enhanced RBPJ-mediated transcription. We hypothesize that this regulatory loop
  links cytokine receptor signaling and RBPJ-mediated transcription. (B) Scheme of
  the megakaryocyte lineage development pathways. Our results support the hypothesis
  that megakaryocyte can develop from immature hematopoietic cells through a NOTCH-induced
  AKT-independent pathway. Megakaryocyte can also develop from committed myeloid progenitor
  through an AKT-dependent pathway that is activated by cytokine receptor activation
  (eg, MPL) and may also be stimulated by the NOTCH signaling.
