caption: '(A) GnRH signalling; (B) corticotropin releasing hormone signalling; (C)
  ERK/MAPK signalling. Red: up-regulated in GBS compared to control. The intensity
  of the node color indicated the degree of up-regulation. Genes in uncolored notes
  were not identified as differentially expressed in our experiment and were integrated
  into the computationally generated networks on the basis of the evidence stored
  in the IPA knowledge memory indicating a relevance to this pathway.'
