caption: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are synthesized endogenously via the
  Maillard reaction and several alternative pathways []. In the early steps of the
  Maillard reaction, an iminine intermediate (Schiff base) is formed by the reaction
  of a reducing sugar (e.g., glucose) with a protein-bound amine or free amino acid.
  The labile Schiff base can produce highly reactive dicarbonyls (e.g., methylglyoxal)
  or rearrange into stable Amadori products. In the advanced steps of the Maillard
  reaction, the Amadori products undergo complex rearrangements, cleavage and covalent
  binding reactions, which eventually give rise to the generation of AGEs, which are
  stable adducts and cross-links of proteins [,]. Highly reactive carbonyls can also
  be generated from glycolytic pathway intermediates, the polyol pathway, glucose
  autoxidation, ketones generated by the breakdown of amino acids and lipid peroxidation.
  Those carbonyl compounds initiate the process of advanced glycation directly, eventually
  leading to the synthesis of a wide range of fluorescent (e.g., pentosidine) and
  non-fluorescent AGEs (e.g., glucosepane), which can be found in human tissues including
  eye lenses [].
