caption: Summary of the defensive effects of PHC against rI/R-induced acute lung injury,
  and the potential pathogenesis. PHC greatly ameliorated rI/R-induced acute lung
  injury by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation. These effects of PHC were
  linked to its stimulation of the ARE/Nrf2/AMPK pathways and its inhibition of NF-κB
  and NLRP3 signaling. However, the mitigation of NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling by PHC
  appeared to be Nrf2-independent and Nrf2-dependent, respectively.
