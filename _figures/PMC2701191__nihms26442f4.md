caption: The interactions of TAB1 and CD2AP with the TGF-β3/TGF-β-receptor complex
  can activate both the p38 or the ERK signaling pathways, which, in turn, causes
  the disruption of both BTB and AJs (right panel). When the TGF-β3/TGF-β-receptor
  complex associates only with CD2AP, but not TAB1, this selectively activates only
  the ERK signaling pathway, resulting in AJ disruption without compromising the BTB
  (left panel). Without such selective interaction between the TGF-β3/receptor complex
  and any of the adaptors, both the BTB and anchoring junction remains intact (middle
  panel). Keys to the symbols in this figure can be found in .
