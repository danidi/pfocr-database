caption: Bile acids are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum, affect transcription factor
  FXR in the enterocyte and as a result FGF15 secretion which through the blood flow
  is able to suppress bile synthesis and lipid metabolism in the liver. On the other
  hand, reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver by the portal vein blood
  flow, where their hepatocyte uptake is regulated by the import genes (Ntcp and Oatps).
  Bile acids’ interaction with FXR effects SHP transcription, which in turn inhibits
  bile and lipid synthesis in the liver. In mice after VSG serum bile acid levels
  were elevated, expression of bile acid production genes was decreased as a consequence
  of the bile acid synthesis negative feedback regulation, and lipid metabolism genes
  were downregulated in the liver which resulted in the reduction of hepatic steatosis.
