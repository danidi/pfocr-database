caption: a | In conventional T cells, mTOR integrates the TCR and CD28 signals that
  are necessary to pass two checkpoints of T-cell activation. The transition from
  G0 to G1 phase of the cell cycle (checkpoint 1) requires activation of NFAT, MAPKs
  and NF-κB. The activity of NF-κB is controlled by the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway. mTOR
  works as part of the complexes TORC1 and TORC2, of which the former is susceptible
  to inhibition by rapamycin. The coordinated activity of NFAT, AP1 and NF-κB regulates
  multiple genes involved in cell-cycle progression and the expression of IL-2 and
  its high-affinity receptor. IL-2R signals through the PI3K–AKT-mediated activation
  of mTOR complexed with survivin and aurora B, which regulates G1- to S-phase progression
  (checkpoint 2). In addition, mTOR activity is involved in rapamycin-sensitive down-regulation
  of the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), which controls expression
  of lymphoid tissue-homing molecules to ensure that activated T cells can exit the
  lymph nodes. b | The ability of TReg cells to proliferate when stimulated in the
  presence of rapamycin seems to be connected to two effects. First, TReg cells do
  not down-regulate phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) expression after TCR engagement,
  which impedes the activation of the rapamycin-susceptible PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway.
  Second, FOXP3 drives expression of phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM)2, reinforced
  by IL-2- and TCR-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT)5, which compensates for AKT inactivity and promotes cell-cycle progression.
