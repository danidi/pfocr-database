caption: An example of autocrine and paracrine interactions between NPY neuron (blue)
  and POMC neuron (green) in the ARC and their downstream effector neuron (i.e., neuron
  in PVN; beige). NPY secreted by NPY neuron can trigger Gisignaling pathway to inhibit
  Ca2+ channel activity and activate GIRK current via its receptors (Y1R, Y2R, and
  Y5R) in both autocrine and paracrine manners, thereby inhibiting the release of
  neurotransmitters. While AgRP and α-MSH secreted by NPY neuron and POMC neuron,
  respectively, act as antagonist and agonist of MC3R. The activation of MC3R can
  reduce food intake via the feeding circuit in the hypothalamus.
