caption: 'The heme biosynthetic pathway and aspects of its regulation in hepatocytes.
  Key roles are played by 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1 (ALAS1), heme oxygenase
  1 (HMOX1), nuclear receptors (NRs) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) (also
  known as porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase). Heme itself downregulates several steps
  in the synthetic pathway, especially ALAS1, by downregulating transcription, upregulating
  mRNA breakdown, blocking uptake into mitochondria and increasing Lon peptidase 1
  breakdown of the mature mitochondrial enzyme. Heme upregulates HMOX1, mainly by
  increasing its transcription through binding to Bach1, a tonic repressor. HMBS is
  present in low amounts and becomes rate controlling when ALAS1 is induced. Fifty
  percent deficiency of HMBS, the defect in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), can
  lead to critical deficiency of heme and uncontrolled induction of ALAS1. Heme administered
  intravenously is taken up well by hepatocytes and can replete heme pools rapidly
  and correct the defects caused by HMBS and other synthetic enzyme deficiencies.
  More recent studies in cell culture models suggest that heme excess may exert additional
  effects on other enzymes in the synthetic pathway, as suggested by the + and − symbols
  in the figure (World J Gastroent 19 (10): 1593). However, whether such effects are
  clinically relevant remain uncertain.'
