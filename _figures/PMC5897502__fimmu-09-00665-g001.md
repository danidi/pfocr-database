caption: Antigen receptor signaling in naïve and anergic B cells. B cell antigen receptor
  (BCR) aggregation in naïve cells leads proximally to phosphorylation of CD79a and
  CD79b immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) tyrosines. This phosphorylation
  allows recruitment of the Src-family kinase Lyn to the receptor where it binds through
  its SH2 domain and its activity is derepressed. Lyn mediates activation of the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway via phosphorylation of CD19, and the PI(3,4,5)P3 product
  of this pathway sequesters BLNK, PLCγ, and BTK for function in signaling. Phosphorylation
  of both ITAM tyrosines leads to binding of SYK via its dual SH2 domains and to subsequent
  activation. Under conditions of chronic antigen stimulation (anergy), the ITAMs
  on CD79a are preferentially monophosphorylated, recruiting Lyn to the complex. Lyn,
  in its negative regulatory role, recruits the function of the inositol phosphatases,
  SHIP-1 and PTEN, as well as the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1. These regulatory phosphatases
  will then exert their inhibitory function on downstream effector molecules, abrogating
  stimulatory BCR signaling. Bias toward stimulation of inhibitory circuitry is reversed
  upon removal of the antigen receptor stimulus.
