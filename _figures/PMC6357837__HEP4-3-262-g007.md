caption: 'Working model of cholestasis in Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice fed the HFD. (A)
  When Pemt+/+ mice are fed the HFD, BAs are secreted from the hepatocyte into bile
  by BSEP and removed from the portal circulation by NTCP and OATP1. Hepatic PC is
  synthesized either by means of the choline pathway or the PEMT pathway (conversion
  from PE to PC) in the ER. Hepatic PC and TG are secreted into the circulation as
  VLDL, and PC is secreted into bile. MDR2 flips PC from the inner to the outer membrane
  of the canalicular membrane from where the PC is extracted into bile by the BAs.
  ATP8B1 flips PE from the outer to the inner canalicular membrane. The dotted box
  represents enlargement of the area of ER close to the canaliculus. ER domains that
  are close to the canalicular membrane are enriched with PEMT, thereby providing
  PC directly to the canalicular membrane for biliary secretion. In addition, PEMT
  might deplete PE from the canaliculus so that an appropriate PC:PE ratio is maintained.
  Moreover, PC is made in areas of the ER not close to the canaliculus through the
  choline pathway and might also provide PC for biliary secretion. (B) When Pemt–/–
  mice are fed the HFD, the amount of mRNAs encoding NTCP, OATP1, and BSEP is decreased
  (mechanism not known), leading to the accumulation of BAs in plasma and, likely,
  in the liver/hepatocytes. Moreover, the amount of MDR2 is decreased in an attempt
  to conserve hepatic PC. Thus, because PC is synthesized only by the choline pathway
  in Pemt–/– hepatocytes, a reduction in hepatic PC leads to impaired VLDL secretion
  and consequently hepatic steatosis. The lack of PEMT in the hepatocytes reduces
  the local supply of PC for the canalicular membrane, which cannot be compensated
  by PC synthesized in the bulk of the ER by the choline pathway. The deficiency of
  PC in the canalicular membrane would compromise integrity of the canalicular membrane
  and change in structure of the canaliculus. Arrows in red indicate differences compared
  to Pemt+/+ mice. (C) When Pemt–/– mice are fed the CSHFD, the increased supply of
  dietary choline is likely to increase PC synthesis by means of the choline pathway,
  thereby increasing the availability of PC at the canalicular membrane and restoring
  membrane integrity. Consequently, the amounts of mRNAs encoding BSEP, MDR2, NTCP,
  and OATP1 are increased so that hepatocellular and plasma BA concentrations are
  reduced. The increased amount of PC in the hepatocyte also enhances VLDL secretion
  and reduces hepatic steatosis. Arrows in green indicate differences compared to
  Pemt+/+ mice fed the HFD. Abbreviations: CPT, Choline phosphotransferase; CTα, phosphocholine
