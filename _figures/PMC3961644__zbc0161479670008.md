caption: Proposed model for the negative or positive regulation of chondrocyte maturation
  or apoptosis by Smpd3/nSMase2, respectively. BMP-2 promotes chondrogenesis by multiple
  pathways, including activation of Akt signaling and the subsequent induction of
  Has2. During chondrocyte maturation, up-regulated Runx2 induces Smpd3 in concert
  with BMP signaling. nSMase2 releases ceramide, which activates PP2A to dephosphorylate
  Akt. This blockade of the Akt pathway interferes not only with chondrocyte maturation
  but also with Has2-mediated production of HA.
