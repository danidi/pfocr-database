caption: General phenylpropanoid- and monolignol-specific pathways and metabolic map
  of the changes in phenolic metabolism in atr2 mutant stems. The main route toward
  lignin (i.e. the general phenylpropanoid- and monolignol-specific pathway) is marked
  with a gray background. Metabolites that accumulate in atr2 mutants are marked in
  red, and those that decrease in atr2 mutants are marked in blue. Metabolic routes
  that are active in stems of wild-type plants are given in black. Metabolic routes
  of which the metabolites are near or below the detection limit in wild-type plants
  but detected in atr2 mutants are given in gray. Metabolites that are below the detection
  limit in both wild-type and mutant plants are indicated with daggers. The three
  CYP450s are marked in orange. PAL, PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA LYASE; C4H, CINNAMATE 4-HYDROXYLASE;

  For each enzymatic step of the general phenylpropanoid- and monolignol-specific
  pathways, specific gene family members are given that largely contribute to lignification
  in the inflorescence stem (; ).
