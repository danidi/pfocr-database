caption: A proposed working model showing the involvement of DUSPs in pathways of
  proteostasis that contribute to neurodegeneration. A simplified version of proteostasis
  is represented under three central themes—protein biogenesis, protein quality control
  processes, and protein degradation. In this article, we highlight the role of DUSPs
  in protein quality control and breakdown, with respect to neurological disorders.
  Protein translation, folding, and transport occur largely within the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). An increased load of misfolded proteins in the ER evokes the ER
  stress response, and several DUSPs have been shown to participate in this pathway
  of proteostasis. Next, protein aggregates are the by-products of accumulated misfolded
  proteins and represent the hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases. DUSPs participate
  in phosphorylation-dependent modulation of protein aggregation mostly by regulating
  MAPK and related signaling pathways. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is
  often triggered in response to protein aggregates and results in oxidative stress.
  DUSPs participate in the oxidative stress response (OxR), and may have protective
  or aggravating roles, depending on the phosphatase. Further, DUSPs have a confirmed
  involvement in the heat shock response (HSR) pathway by either self-modulation or
  by direct interaction with the heat shock proteins/molecular chaperones. Heat shock
  proteins assist misfolded and aggregated proteins to refold and attain their native
  conformation. Proteins which fail to refold even after assistance from the heat
  shock response pathway, may then be degraded (indicated by dotted arrow). Finally,
  autophagy is the major degradation route for toxic-protein aggregates, and is known
  to be influenced by some DUSPs. When individual cells become overwhelmed by proteotoxic
  stress, they may enter apoptosis. The initiation of the apoptotic cascade is also
  known to be influenced by certain DUSPs.
