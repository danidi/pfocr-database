caption: The model-predicted essential pathway catalyzed by AldA. Glycolaldehyde is
  a by-product of the essential tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway in Escherichia
  coli. It is produced by dihydroneopterin aldolase, encoded by the gene folB. The
  aldA gene encodes glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase, which oxidizes glycolaldehyde to
  glycolate. In an ΔaldA knockout strain, the E. coli metabolic model predicts that
  glycolaldehyde will accumulate in the cell, leading to cell death (). Experimentally,
  however, ΔaldA mutants are viable.
