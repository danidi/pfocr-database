caption: Schematic diagram showing the putative TGF-β signaling pathways involved
  in EndoMT in pulmonary endothelial cells. Following ligand-initiated activation
  of the Smad-independent TGF-β pathway, there is phosphorylation of GSK-3β mediated
  by PKC-δ and the cAbl nonreceptor kinase. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at serine 9
  (ser9) causes its inhibition, which then allows Snail1 to enter the nucleus. Nuclear
  accumulation of Snail1 results in marked stimulation of Snail1 expression, which
  then leads to acquisition of the myofibroblast phenotype with stimulation of α-SMA.
  The inhibition of GSK-3 ser9 phosphorylation by specific inhibition of PKC-δ with
  rottlerin, or the specific inhibition of c-Abl activity with imatinib, allows GSK-3β
  to phosphorylate Snail1, targeting it for proteosomal degradation and thus, effectively
  abolishes the acquisition of the myofibroblastic phenotype and the fibrotic response.
