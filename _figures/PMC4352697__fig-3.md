caption: 'Neuropeptide–mast cell–myofibroblast contributions to post-traumatic elbow
  fibrosis. Traumatic injury to the elbow initiates connective tissue repair processes
  mediated by mast cell signaling and myofibroblast differentiation. In at-risk patients,
  this pathway escapes normal regulatory control; excessive SP secretion from terminal
  nerve endings in the joint and periarticular connective tissue results in persistent
  mast cell stimulation, propagating the inflammatory cascade of myofibroblast-mediated
  connective tissue fibrosis. Over time, excessive collagen deposition results in
  permanent motion loss and joint dysfunction. Modified with permission from Monument
  et al. ECM, extracellular matrix. Adapted from figures 1 and 4 in Michael James
