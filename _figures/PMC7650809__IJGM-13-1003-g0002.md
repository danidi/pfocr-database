caption: 'PD-1- PD-L1 pathway: (A) PD-1 is a checkpoint present on the surface of
  T cells. When PD-1 binds to its ligands, PD-L1/2 present on APC and cancer cells,
  this will result in the inhibition of T cell activity in favour of tumor survival.
  (B) Monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 or PDL-1/2 will lead to the activation of
  the immune response against the tumor cells.'
