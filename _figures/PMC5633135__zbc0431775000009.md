caption: Proposed functions of Gene 33 in DDR and apoptosis. Nuclear Gene 33 activates
  DDR via both EBD-dependent and EBD-independent pathways by directly activating c-Abl
  and promoting the interaction between ATM and histone H2AX, respectively. Both pathways
  are dependent on ATM. Activation of c-Abl by Gene 33 also induces apoptosis in a
  p73-dependent pathway. Gene 33 promotes apoptosis also by inhibiting EGFR and AKT-mediated
  pro-survival pathway. Both of these pathways are dependent the EBD motif of Gene
  33. C, cytoplasm; N, nucleus.
