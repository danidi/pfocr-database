caption: Model of CifEc inhibition of CRL activation cycle. Neddylated active CRL
  (left) ubiquitylates the substrate (sub) and substrate recognition module (SRM)
  leading to their degradation and generating inactive CRL (top). Deneddylation of
  CRL by the COP9 signalosome allows binding of CAND1 (right). SRM fixation induces
  CAND1 release and subsequent neddylation of cullin to generate an active CRL [,].
  Cif binding to and deamidation of NEDD8 impairs the action of COP9, blocking the
  activation cycle and locking the CRL in an inactive neddylated state.
