caption: 'The vasoactive mediators that contribute to the development of pulmonary
  vascular remodeling and PH can be broadly divided into two major categories: factors
  affecting vascular tone and factors influencing vessel wall thickening. ROS influence
  the generation of several of these factors. In PH, ROS decrease the expression and/or
  function of redox sensitive voltage gated K+ channels (Kv1.5, Kv2.1), leading to
  elevations in intracellular K+ and Ca2+ influx through the activation of voltage-gated
  L-type Ca2+ channels. In turn, Ca2+ induces SMC contraction through the calmodulin
  dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and the subsequent phosphorylation
  of the myosin light chain (MLC). ROS also promote the activation of the small GTPase,
  RhoA, and its downstream effector, Rho kinase, which increase the phosphorylation
  of MLC through the inhibition of MLC phosphatase. In addition, ROS promote pulmonary
  vessel constriction by enhancing the production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and thromboxane
  A2 (TXA2), while attenuating the levels of vasodilators, such as prostacyclin and
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-γ (PPAR-γ). The role of ROS in mediating
  pulmonary SMC proliferation and vessel thickening is more complex. Oxidative stress
  induces the expression of several growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β1
  (TGF-β1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor-2
  (FGF-2), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In addition, ROS also activate
  p38MAPK and ERK1/2, which promote proliferation. The MAPK signaling pathway is also
  activated by pp60Src, through ROS mediated activation. Further, ROS stimulate Akt1,
  which promotes SMC proliferation through the upregulation of PGC-1α. Together, the
  dysregulation of these constrictive and proliferative factors by ROS promotes the
  vascular remodeling seen in PH.'
