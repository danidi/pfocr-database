caption: Human (left) and yeast (right) metabolic pathways were deduced from the function
  of the proteins compiled in the MitoProteome Dataset [] and present in the yeast
  proteomics set [], respectively. In order to facilitate the comparison of both metabolic
  pathways, pathways shared by the two species are depicted in the middle region of
  the figure, pathways at the extremes of the dashed lines are exclusive for human
  (left) or yeast (right) mitochondria. Color codes indicate whether the pathway was
  likely present in the proto-mitochondrion (blue) or has a different origin (red).
  Only those pathways with two or more consecutive steps are depicted. Symbols are
  as in . All proteins are nuclear-encoded except for nad1–6 subunits of Complex I
  in human; the atp9 subunit of Complex V in yeast; and the Cob subunit in Complex
  III, cox1–3 subunits of Complex IV, and the atp6 and atp8 subunits from Complex
  V in both species.
