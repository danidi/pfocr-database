caption: Hypothetical model explaining the pathway through which mutated htt (mhtt)
  causes OMM permeabilization. Bax activation in HD may depend on the ‘activators'
  BH3-only proteins and the ‘sensitizers' that bind only to pro-survival proteins
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Mutated htt may interact with the Bcl-2 protein network at multiple
  levels by modulating Bcl-2 expression, inducing Bid accumulation and Bid cleavage,
  promoting BNip3 activation and increasing non-pBad levels. BimEL accumulation/activation
  may depend on htt control over BDNF expression or ER stress-induced UPR or both
  mechanisms
