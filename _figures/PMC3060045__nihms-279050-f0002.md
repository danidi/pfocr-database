caption: ErbB receptor signaling and regulation. (A) Receptor activation. Activation
  of ErbB receptors by ligand occurs through paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Ligands
  are membrane bound until processing by ADAM family metalloproteinases. Stimulation
  of ADAM metalloproteinase activity may come through activation of Frizzled by Wnt1
  or Wnt5a or through activation of G protein-coupled receptors by ligands such as
  thrombin, endothelin, and lysophosphatidic acid. Alternatively, G protein-coupled
  receptor activation activates the soluble tyrosine kinase Src, which can phosphorylate
  EGFR. Activation of growth hormone receptors activates Jak2, which is able to phosphorylating
  EGFR as well. (B) Signal transduction to nucleus. Activation of ErbB receptors leads
  to activation of Ras/MAPK. PI(3)K/Akt, PLCγ/PKC, and STAT pathways. Tyrosine phosphorylated
  ErbB receptors bind adaptors such as Shc and Grb2 leading to Sos recruitment and
  Ras/MAPK pathway activation. EGFR requires the docking protein Gab-1 for activation
  of the PI(3)K/Akt pathway. Other ErbB receptors do not require Gab-1. Receptors
  themselves may also translocate to the nucleus to influence gene transcription.
  EGFR has a defined nuclear localization signal and interacts with importin-β in
  its transit to the nucleus. The cytosolic s80/E4ICD, the product of proteolytic
  release of the intracellular tyrosine kinase, translocates to the nucleus and has
  been shown to directly influence gene transcription. (C) Regulation of ErbB2 by
  HSP90. HSP90 stabilizes ErbB2 at the cell membrane and prevents unregulated heterodimer
  formation with other ErbBs such as the ‘kinase dead’ ErbB3. HSP90 also prevents
  degradation of ErbB2. (D) Sequential proteolysis of ErbB4. Two-step proteolysis
  of ErbB4 in the extracellular juxtamembrane region by TACE/ADAM17 followed by cleavage
  in the transmembrane domain by presenilin/γ-secretase liberates the intracellular
  portion of ErbB4 (s80/E4ICD), which can act as a nuclear chaperone for molecules
  such as YAP-1 and STAT5A. The WW-domain containing protein WWOX sequesters s80/E4ICD
  in the cytosol. (E) Ligand binding and dimerization of EGFR stimulates receptor
  endocytosis involving EPS15, which is inhibited by Parkin. The E3-ubiquitin ligase
  Cbl binds to phosphorylated EGFR leading to ubiquitinylation (Ub) and lysosomal
  targeting. Both de-ubiquitinated, ligand-free EGFR and EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers preferentially
  recycle to the cell surface.
