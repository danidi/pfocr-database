caption: Schematic summary of the potential therapeutic targets. Recapitulation of
  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathological conditions in global or cell-specific
  knockouts in the humanised angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) mouse model will
  enable investigators to dissect the inflammatory immune cascades that are involved
  in disease pathology. As shown, the blockade of cell-specific receptors, T-helper
  (Th)1 and/or Th2 cytokines, complement activation, renin–angiotensin system pathway
  activity, administration of mesenchymal stem cells, and antithrombotic treatments
  could all be useful as therapeutic targets in COVID-19.
