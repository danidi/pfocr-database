caption: Methionine sulfoxide and methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) redox cycle.
  Methionine oxidation by RS generates methionine sulfoxide (MetSO), which can be
  further hyperoxidized to MetSO2. MSRs share similar catalytic mechanism involving
  the initial formation of PSOH or protein selenocysteine sulfenic acid (PSeOH) (MSRB1)
  on the catalytic cysteine or selenocysteine, with consequent methionine release
  (). In MSRA and MSRB1 the catalytic PSOH or PSeOH subsequently forms an intradisulfide
  bond with the resolving cysteine, which is ultimately reduced by TRX. In MSRA, a
  third cysteine mediates a thiol-exchange reaction to transfer the disulfide bond
  to the protein surface prior to its reduction by TRX (). In contrast, MSRB2 and
  MSRB3 have only one cysteine, which is reduced directly by TRX. Because MSRA reduces
  both free and protein-based Met-S-SO, its protective effects can be associated to
  enhanced GSH synthesis through the transsulfuration pathway (). In the transsulfuration
  pathway methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in an ATP-dependent
  reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Subsequently, S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) is generated via methyltransferase (MTF) activity. SAH is hydrolyzed by SAH
  hydrolase (SAHH) to adenosine and homocysteine. Homocysteine is conjugated with
  serine to provide cystathionine by the action of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS).
  Finally, cystathionine-γ-lyase (CTH, or γ-cystathionase) catalyses the conversion
  of cystathionine to cysteine.
