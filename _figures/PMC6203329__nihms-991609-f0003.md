caption: Multiple functions of p21 in the cellular response to oxidative stress and
  associated injury to the genome. The p21 protein inhibits cell cycle progression
  by inhibiting cyclin/CDK complexes and by interfering with other drivers of the
  cell cycle, including PCNA, pRb, c-MYC, E2F and cyclin B1, as well as downregulating
  genes required for mitosis. p21 also promotes DNA repair, including the HRR and
  NHEJ pathways that process DNA DSBs as well as the BER pathway that processes various
  types of base damage. p21 also promotes the cellular early response to oxidative
  stress by facilitating the activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant transcription factor.
  p21 is an important inhibitor of the apoptosis pathway of cell death through multiple
  mechanisms. Another key activity of p21 in the DDR relates to the implementation
  and maintenance of the prolonged senescence-like SIPS response which again involves
  multiple mechanisms. DNMT = DNA methyltransferase; CBP = CREB-binding protein; ASK-1
  = apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; WIP1 = wild-type p53-induced phosphatase
  1; CDK = cyclin-dependent kinase; PCNA = proliferating cell nuclear antigen; pRb
  = retinoblastoma protein; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK = c-jun N-terminal
  kinase; BCL-XL = B-cell lymphoma-extra large; HRR = homologous recombination repair;
  NHEJ = non-homologous end joining; BER = base excision repair; Nrf2 = nuclear factor
  erythroid 2-like 2.
