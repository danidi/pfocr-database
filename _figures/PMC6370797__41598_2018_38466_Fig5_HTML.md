caption: Speculated antioxidant related signaling pathways induced by APS in MEFs.
  (1) Because of the similarities in structure between APS and lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), we speculate that TLR4 is likely the primary receptor of APS and that the
  subsequent signals are transmitted via MyD88, IRAK1 and TRAF6. (2) The two intracellular
  signaling pathways induced by APS may be (I) the MAPK signaling pathway including
  p38, JNK and ERK, which can induce the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and (II) the classical
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
