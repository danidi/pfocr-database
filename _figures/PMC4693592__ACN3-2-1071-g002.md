caption: Monocytes from MS patients cluster independently from HV and display enhanced
  inflammatory pathways. Microarrays were used to compare MS patient monocytes to
  monocytes from HV. (A) A principal component analysis clearly distinguishes independent
  clustering of MS patient monocytes and HV. (B) Canonical pathways significantly
  upregulated in MS patient monocytes were determined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
  Several of these top pathways are important in proinflammatory functions of monocytes
  (IL‐17 signaling, bacterial recognition, TLR signaling, pathogenesis of MS) (see
  Supplementary References). All pathways achieved a threshold greater than 1% (straight
  orange line). Ratios for number of genes in the pathway enriched in the dataset
  compared to total number of known genes in the pathway are represented by the jagged
  orange line. Two‐way ANOVA under Benjamini‐Hochberg, False Discovery Rate, Matthew's
  Correlation Coefficient (BH FDR MCC) with Tukey's test. P < 0.05, n = 4/group. MS,
  multiple sclerosis; HV, healthy volunteers; ANOVA, analysis of variance.
