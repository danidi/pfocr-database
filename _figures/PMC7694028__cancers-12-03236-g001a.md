caption: 'Signal transduction in the EGF/EGFR–RAS–RAF–MEK–MAPK pathway. (A) Regulated
  signal transduction in RAS/BRAF wt cells. EGFR is activated by the binding of EGF,
  a specific ligand to become an active homodimer. Homodimerization stimulates the
  autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the EGFR domain, which initiates the
  downstream signal cascade via RAS–RAF–MEK–MAPK signal transduction. Activated RAS-induced
  dimerization of RAFs is necessary for phosphorylating downstream effectors, MEK
  and ERK (left). This signal transduction pathway comprises a negative feedback loop,
  i.e., elevated pERK in turn causes the de-phosphorylation of EGFR and thereby attenuates
  this signal (right). (B) The constitutive activation of the RAF–MEK–MAPK signal
  in BRAFV600E cells. BRAFV600E-mutated cells constitutively activate its downstream
  effectors as a monomer in the absence of upstream signals. Given this independence,
  the activation of the MAPK pathway is refractory to the pERK-mediated negative feedback
  regulation. This explains why RAF–MEK–MAPK signal transduction is constitutively
  active in BRAFV600E cells. (C) BRAF inhibition with ATP competitive RAF inhibitors
  in BRAFV600E. ATP-competitive inhibitors such as vemurafenib act on monomeric BRAF
  and suppress downstream signal transduction. These kind of kinase inhibitors can
  initially control the constitutive activation; however, because of the reduction
  of pERK, they attenuate the negative feedback. EGFR-mediated signal transduction
  will be reactivated before long in CRCs, as activated RAS induces RAF dimerization,
  between BRAF and CRAF, which is refractory to vemurafenib. Therefore, BRAF-mutated
  CRCs can easily overcome the monomer inhibition treatment. (D) The concept of the
  vertical blockade strategy: blocking both upstream and downstream of BRAF using
  anti-EGFR mAb and MEK inhibitor in EGFR signal axis, respectively, were developed
  to overcome the resistance mechanism. Theoretically, this vertical blockade can
  suppress the growth signaling if and only if the EGFR–RAS–MEK–MAPK pathway remains
  the prime pathway throughout treatment. (E) A possible signaling pathway providing
  resistance to the vertical blockade triplet therapy. The EGFR signal axis is not
  the only pathway for the proliferation of BRAF-mutated CRCs. Reactivation of other
  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as HER2 and MET, was pointed out in vitro.
  Moreover, the RAS–RAF–MEK–MAPK pathway is known to interact with the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  BRAF-mutated CRCs can therefore evade the vertical blockade with triplet therapy
  through these alternative means. EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor, EGF: epidermal
