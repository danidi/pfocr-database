caption: Decreased expression of TGFBR3 induces tumor-forming and migratory ability
  in ccRCC cells. Loss of TGFBR3 enhances the metastatic phenotype of ccRCC cells
  through distinct pathways. Tumor-forming ability is regulated by the TGF-β2-TGFBR3-ALDH
  pathway in the CIC population. Cell migration is regulated by TGFBR3 through lamellipodium
  formation and the FAK-PI3K signaling pathway in a TGF-β-TβRI-independent manner

  of renal cell carcinoma cells through TGF-β-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
