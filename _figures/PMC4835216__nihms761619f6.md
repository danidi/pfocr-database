caption: PTH stimulates Rankl and Cox2/PGE2 in osteoblast (OB) lineage cells. Rankl
  acts on osteoclast (OC) lineage cells to commit them to become osteoclasts and to
  stimulate more Cox2/PGE2. The combination of Rankl and PGE2 cause cells committed
  to become osteoclasts to secrete Saa3. In the presence of Saa3, PTH-stimulated cAMP
  production is abrogated, preventing subsequent PKA activation and β-catenin signaling.
  When PTH is unable to initiate this negative feedback pathway, either by absence
  of osteoclasts or Cox2, β-catenin is phosphorylated at Ser552 and Ser675 and can
  stimulate gene transcription associated with osteoblastic differentiation.
