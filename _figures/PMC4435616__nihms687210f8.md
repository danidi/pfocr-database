caption: Our proposed model for involvement of Tiam1-Rac1 signaling pathway in the
  activation of Nox2 and downstream stress kinase, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction
  and retinal capillary cell apoptosis, and the development of diabetic retinopathy.
  Based on our recently published evidence [] and the current findings, we propose
  a model to highlight the contributory roles of Nox2 in cellular dysfunction induced
  by hyperglycemia. Chronic exposure of cells to these conditions culminates in the
  generation of Rac1-Nox2-mediated ROS, which, in turn, leads to activation of stress
  kinases (p38 MAP kinase) and onset of mitochondrial dysregulation []. Alterations
  in mitochondrial function including leakage of proapoptotic factors (cytochrome-C)
  into the soluble compartment leads to activation of caspases, which is turn, catalyze
  the degradation and mislocalization of key structural proteins leading to metabolic
  dysfunction of the cell. Pharmacological evidence (NSC23766 and gp91 ds-tat peptide;
  ref. and current studies) strongly favors the concept that Tiam1-Rac1-Nox2 axis
  represents one of the areas for the development of novel therapeutics to impede
  metabolic defects under glucotoxic and diabetic conditions []. Our current observations
  also implicate that protein palmitoyltransferase might represent a potential target
  for halting glucotoxic effects on retinal endothelial cells and the onset of diabetic
  retinopathy.
