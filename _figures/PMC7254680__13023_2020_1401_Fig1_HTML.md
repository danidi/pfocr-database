caption: 'A scheme for the overall GPI-APs biosynthetic pathway, structural remodeling
  and transport. The whole biosynthetic steps can be divided into three parts: biosynthesis
  of GPI anchor, attachment of protein and GPI anchor, remodeling of GPI-APs. a) GPI
  anchor is synthesized in the ER from free PI through 11 steps [transfer of GlcNAc
  to PI, de-N-acetylation, acylation of the inositol ring, transfer of three mannoses,
  transfer of three ethanolamine phosphates, currently unknown: GlcN-PI flips from
  the cytoplasmic side to the luminal side, lipid structure changes from diacyl PI
  to a mixture of 1-alkyl, 2-acyl PI and diacyl PI in GlcN-(acyl) PI] which involves
  more than 17 genes, most of them are named PIG genes. The first two steps take place
  on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, whereas subsequent steps occur on the luminal
  side. b) The precursor proteins are synthesized independent of the GPI and processed
  by the GPI-transamidase complex encoded by five genes. c) Post-translational modification
  after attachment of protein and GPI anchor involving PGAP (post-GPI-attachment to
  proteins) genes, includes structural remodeling of the glycan and lipid portions
  of the GPI anchor, removing an acyl chain from the inositol and an EtN-P from Man-2.
  GPI-APs are then transported to the cell surface through the Golgi, where additional
  structural remodeling occurs, namely fatty acid'
