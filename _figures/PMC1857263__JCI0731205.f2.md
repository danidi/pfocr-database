caption: (A) The endogenous MHC class I presentation pathway leads to the activation
  of CD8+ T cells. Antigens expressed in the cells or introduced into the cytoplasm
  are degraded by the proteasome complex to generate short peptides that are translocated
  into the ER through special pores controlled by the transporter associated with
  antigen processing (TAP) proteins. In the lumen of the ER, the peptides associate
  with newly synthesized MHC class I molecules and the peptide–MHC class I complex
  is transported to the cell surface, where it is presented to CD8+ T cells expressing
  the cognate TCR (that is, the TCR that recognizes the particular peptide-MHC complex).
  Therefore, delivery into DCs of nucleic acid–encoded antigen, which needs to be
  translated in the cytoplasm, favors the generation of MHC class I–restricted CD8+
  T cell responses. TGN, trans-Golgi network. (B) The exogenous MHC class II presentation
  pathway leads to the activation of CD4+ T cells. Antigens captured by professional
  APCs such as macrophages and DCs are routed through the endosome, where they undergo
  partial proteolytic degradation to generate peptides that associate with nascent
  MHC class II molecules. The peptide–MHC class II complexes are transported to the
  cell surface and presented to cognate CD4+ T cells. Therefore, generation of CD4+
  T cell responses is favored by vaccination with whole protein–based antigens.
