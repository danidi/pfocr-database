caption: Given the success of B cell neutralization by depletion (rituximab) or maturation
  arrest (belimumab), several other exploratory drugs targeting CD20 (ofatumumab)
  or the BLyS signaling pathway (blisibimod, tabalumab) are in clinical trials for
  autoimmunity. Additionally, epratuzumab, which binds B cell-expressed CD22, negatively
  modulates B-cell receptor activation. Targeting the activation and migration of
  multiple inflammatory cell types similarly shows safety and promise in autoimmune
  disease. Daclizumab inhibits CD25 and thus affects cellular activation, and chemokine
  receptor antagonists to CCR1 and CCR5 affect migration of proinflammatory cells
  into target tissues.
