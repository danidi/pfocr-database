caption: SCH cells express proenkephalin A, which can be converted to active opioid
  peptides by the processing enzyme furin. Once in the portal plexus, opioid peptides
  activate the chemochine receptor CXCR7, which is expressed mainly in females, and
  promote glucocorticoid (GC) synthesis and anxiolytic behaviors. Adapted from []
