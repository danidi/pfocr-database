caption: Mechanisms of the SLIT/ROBO pathway as an oncogene in cancer. The SLIT2/ROBO1
  signal upregulates MMP-2 and MMP-9, thus promotes cell migration and invasion. SLIT2/ROBO1
  signal recruits a ubiquitin ligase Hakai for E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal
  degradation and thus promotes the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The monoclonal
  antibody R5, which can interrupt the SLIT2/ROBO1 pathway, causes significantly suppressed
  cell growth and proliferation. ROBO3 promotes cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis,
  which is associated with activated Wnt pathway components, β-catenin and GSK-3β,
  and other markers indicating the EMT, and miR-383 functions as a suppressor of ROBO3.
