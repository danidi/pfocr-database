caption: Systemic diagram of the mechanism of S1PR1/STAT3 signaling pathway. S1PR1
  regulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 through directly binding to STAT3. Then phosphorylated
  STAT3 transferred into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of downstream target
  genes, leading to proliferation promotion and apoptosis inhibition of ESCC cells

  description: Systemic diagram of the mechanism of S1PR1/STAT3 signaling pathway.
    S1PR1 regulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 through directly binding to STAT3.
    Then phosphorylated STAT3 transferred into the nucleus to regulate the transcription
    of downstream target genes, leading to proliferation promotion and apoptosis inhibition
    of ESCC cells
