caption: Parallel activin and TGFβ signaling in advanced colon cancer. TGFβ and activin
  both share SMAD4 signaling to upregulate p21. However, in colon cancer, there is
  ligand-specific SMAD4-independent signaling utilizing distinct mitogenic signaling.
  Moreover, activin dominantly induces downregulation of p21 via PI3K/Akt signaling
  over early SMAD4-dependent p21 upregulation in colon cancer (non-dominant pathway
  indicated in grey). Net nuclear p21 expression in colon cancer may be a functional
  surrogate of intact TGFβ/SMAD growth suppression and a negative possible predictor
  of growth enhancing response to TGFβ pathway inhibition. In contrast, colon cancers
  with loss of nuclear p21 may benefit from activin, TGFβ or combination inhibitory
  therapy. In summary, there is complex parallel signaling with feedback loops operative
  in colon cancer downstream of activin and TGFβ. In order to predict net functional
  effects of targeted pathway disruption on tumor behavior, it is crucial that the
  interplay of pathways is fully appreciated to minimize unwanted side effects
