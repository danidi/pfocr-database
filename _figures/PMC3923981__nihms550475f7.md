caption: MORC2 and ACLY interact in the cytosol of MCF-7 cells. This interaction results
  in an induction of ACLY phosphorylation, and therefore, its activation. Because
  of the higher activity of ACLY, increased levels of Acetyl-CoA are accumulated,
  and thus available for the activation of the next steps of the fatty acid synthesis
  pathway, such as the activation of ACC and FAS. This event results ultimately in
  an increase in fatty acid levels. It has been observed that adipogenic signals (i.e.
  the adipogenic cocktail stimulator of adipocyte differentiation) increases the expression
  of MORC2 in the cytosol of the cells.
