caption: In normal cells, MTAP cleaves MTA, a by-product of polyamine biosynthesis,
  into adenine and MTR-1-P. Adenine is converted to AMP by the ubiquitous enzyme APRT,
  with PRPP serving as donor of the phosphoribosyl group. MTR-1-P is converted by
  a series of steps to methionine. AMP is also produced in cells by de novo purine
  biosynthesis. In addition to APRT, other cellular phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTs),
  such as hypoxanthine-guanine phsophoribosyl transferase and orotate phosphoribosyltranferase,
  covert purines and pyrimidines to nucleotides.
