caption: Schematic illustration of the working hypothesis for LV-Wnt5a-RNAi. IL-1β
  upregulates the Wnt5a protein, and the Wnt5a protein activates the JNK signaling
  pathway, inducing the upregulation of MMPs. Ultimately, the MMPs result in COL2
  degradation, thus inducing osteoarthritis. The LV-Wnt5a-RNAi was designed in the
  present study, and is used to silence the Wnt5a mRNA with the purpose of preventing
  COL2 degradation. LV-Wnta-RNAi; lentivirus vector-mediated Wnt5a-specific siRNA;
  MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; COL2, collagen type II; JNK,
  jun amino-terminal kinases.
