caption: 'Our results suggested a model in which dMyc could restore Drosophila Imd
  immune homeostasis at the middle and late stage of E. coli infection. Left diagram:
  Drosophila Imd pathway is activated at the early stage of infection. Right diagram:
  Most of the bacteria have been eliminated at the middle stage of infection, next
  highly expressed antimicrobial peptides induce the up-regulated expression of dMyc.
  Then dMyc transfers into the nuclear to bind the upstream region of miR-277 to activate
  miR-277 transcription. Mature miR-277 further suppresses imd and Tab2 expression
  to down-regulate the Imd pathway immune response, and then assists cells restore
  immune homeostasis at the late stage of infection. Red word: up-regulation; Green
  word: down-regulation.'
