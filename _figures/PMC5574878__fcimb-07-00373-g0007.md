caption: Mechanisms of NADPH oxidase inhibition by bacterial pathogens in PMNs. Several
  bacterial pathogens employ mechanisms to interfere with the activation and/or localization
  of the NADPH complex of PMNs. These include strategies to prevent oxidative burst
  in the phagosomal compartment. Three pathogens, F. tularensis, A. phagocytophilum,
  and H. pylori, exclude one or both components of the cytb558 complex from the phagosomal
  membrane. Three pathogens, F. tularensis H. pylori, and C. burnetti, exclude or
  prevent p67phox/p40phox/p47phox from binding to the phagosomal membrane. A number
  of extracellular pathogens also employ mechanisms to inhibit oxidative burst. P.
  aeruginosa inhibits the oxidative burst of PMNs through the activities of two T3SS
  effectors, ExoS and ExoT. Both effectors inhibit activation of PI3K signaling pathways
  upstream of p67phox/p40phox/p47phox activation. The pathogenic Yersinia sp. inhibit
  respiratory burst in PMNs, though their activities have been largely modeled in
  other phagocytic cell types. Y. pseudotuberuclosis translocates the effector protein
  YopE through a T3SS to block activation of Rac in HL-60 cells. Y. pseudotuberculosis
  also translocates another T3SS effector protein, YopH, which interferes with oxidative
  burst in macrophages. The effects of YopH on oxidative burst have not been examined
  in PMNs; it dismantles the SLP-76/SKAP2 signal transduction pathway in these cells,
  suggesting that interference of this pathway in PMNs could prevent oxidative burst.
  Three pathogens, B. anthracis, B. pertussis, and Group A Streptococcus (GAS), also
  secrete toxins into PMNs that interfere with signaling pathways required for oxidative
  burst. Finally, strains of N. gonorrhoeae lacking opacity-associated proteins do
  not activate oxidative burst in PMNs, though the mechanism by which this occurs
  remains unclear. It is hypothesized that the failure of opacity-negative strains
  to engage CEACAM receptors could result in a failure to stimulate kinase signaling
  upstream of p47phox activation. Alternatively, it is possible that opacity-negative
  strains may actively block trafficking of NADPH oxidase components to membrane sites.
  Additionally, three other pathogens, L. monocytogenes, S. typhimurium, and V. parahaemolyticus,
  are capable of inhibiting the oxidative burst in cultured cells; however, their
  effects on neutrophils have not been examined in detail.
