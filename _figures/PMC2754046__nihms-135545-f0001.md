caption: Hypothetical schematic of a DAergic synapse. Presynaptic neuron contains
  DA precursors leading to vesicular DA fusing with the presynaptic membrane and being
  released into the synaptic cleft. DA then stimulates DAergic receptors on the postsynaptic
  cell. DA is inactivated by being sequestered back into the presynaptic neuron by
  the DA transporter (DAT). DA may also be metabolized extra-synaptically by catechol-O-methyl
  transferase (COMT). DA present in the cytosol is taken up by the vesicular transporter
  (VMAT) for degradation and repackaging. Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting
  enzyme in DA synthesis. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DβH) is responsible for the formation
  of norepinephrine (NE). Intracellular mechanisms associated with the cAMP-PKA-CREB
  pathway through DA D1-like and D2-like receptors are represented in the postsynaptic
  neuron. D1 stimulates through Gαs whereas D2 receptor activation inhibits cAMP levels
  via adenylate cyclase (AC) through Gαi G-proteins. cAMP enhances the dissociation
  of the regulatory subunit of proteins kinase A (PKA) from the catalytic subunit
  (Cα) causing activation. PKA-Cα may translocate to the nucleus where it phosphorylates
  cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) that leads to cAMP response element
  (CRE)-mediated gene expression. PKA-Cα may phosphorylate other receptors or channels
  as well. This kinase also phosphorylates dopamine-and cAMP-regulated-phosphoprotein
  32 kDa (DARPP-32) at position Thr34, that then leads to regulation of other intracellular
  proteins and effects on the neuron.
