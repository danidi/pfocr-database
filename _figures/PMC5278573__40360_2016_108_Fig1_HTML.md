caption: Heme synthesis pathway in animal cells. ALA is synthesized by the condensation
  of glycine and succinyl CoA via mitochondrial ALA synthase. The polymerization of
  8 molecules of ALA in several subsequent steps produces protoporphyrin IX (PpIX).
  Heme is synthesized by the insertion of a ferrous ion into PpIX, and incorporated
  into proteins to produce heme-proteins such as hemoglobin, cytochrome, and P450

  improves glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice via enhancing mitochondrial
  function.
