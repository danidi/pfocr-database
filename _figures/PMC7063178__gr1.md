caption: CST improves insulin sensitivity by suppressing ER stress. Black arrows indicate
  flow of the pathway, Red arrows indicate increase and Green arrows indicate decrease.
  In silico modelling will integrate these signaling features and predict an outcome.
  Here, ‘X’ indicates inhibition. (For interpretation of the references to colour
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
