caption: The scheme depicted in (A) corresponds to the model proposed in the accompanying
  paper by . It posits that under conditions of energy depletion, DG helps to localize
  MRLC (myosin regulatory light chain) and thus makes it available for phosphorylation
  by AMPK. The alternative model shown in (B) suggests that AMPK acts to localize
  DG, which in turn organizes perlecan in the extracellular matrix, which then sends
  a polarizing message back into the cell interior that may facilitate MRLC phosphorylation
  by AMPK. This model is similar in many respects to the relationship that has been
  observed between Rac1 signaling, extracellular matrix components and epithelial
  polarity ().
