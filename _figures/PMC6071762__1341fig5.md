caption: 'Apparent unidirectional fluxes of the LTP-mediated inter-organelle transport
  of lipids are indirectly coupled with metabolic reactions of lipids. A: CERT-mediated
  ceramide/DAG exchange between the ER and Golgi apparatus at MCSs. In this model,
  CERT binds to the ER VAP (via the FFAT motif) and Golgi PI4P (via the PH domain),
  extracts newly synthesized ceramide from the ER membrane depending on its START
  domain, carries the ceramide molecule to the Golgi apparatus at ER-Golgi MCSs, and
  releases ceramide at the Golgi membrane. On its return, the empty START domain extracts
  DAG produced during the synthesis of SM and carries the DAG molecule to the ER membrane.
  DAG may be converted to other anabolic metabolites, such as PC and triacylglycerol.
  PC serves as a precursor of SM; however, the mechanisms by which PC is transported
  from the ER to the Golgi apparatus currently remain unclear. DAG produced in the
  Golgi apparatus may be converted to PC by Golgi-distributed CPT (). Cer, ceramide;
  PAP, PA phosphatase; DGAT, DAG acyltransferase; TAG, triacylglycerol. B: OSBP-mediated
  sterol/PI4P exchange between the ER and Golgi apparatus. In this scenario (), OSBP
  bound to two organelles transfers a sterol from the ER to the Golgi apparatus depending
  on the ORD. In turn, PI4P is transferred from the Golgi apparatus to the ER, and,
  upon its arrival, PI4P is dephosphorylated to PI by the ER-resident PI4P-phosphatase,
  Sac1. After being transported to the Golgi apparatus, presumably by a PITP [Nir2
  may be at least partly responsible for the ER-to-Golgi transport of PI (, )], PI
  is converted to PI4P by a Golgi-localizing PI4K. During one cycle of sterol/PI4P
  exchange between the ER and Golgi membranes, one ATP molecule is consumed, which
  underlies the energetic basis to drive cholesterol transport against its concentration
  gradient. The type of PITP responsible for PI transport from the ER to the Golgi
  apparatus has not yet been identified. CDS, CDP-DAG synthase; PIS, PI synthase;
  PI4K, PI-4 kinase. C: Nir2-mediated PI/PA exchange between the ER and PM. In this
  scenario, Nir2 bound to two organelles transfers PI from the ER to the PM, depending
  on the PI-transfer domain (PITD). In turn, PA is transferred from the PM to the
  ER, and, upon its arrival, PA is reused for the synthesis of PI in the ER. After
  being transported to the PM, PI is further anabolized to PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. Yellow
  box, DAG-binding segment. D: ORP-mediated PS/PI4P exchange between the ER and PM.
  This scenario is analogous to that of the OSBP-mediated pathway. ORP5 has a TMD
  to reside in the ER and a PI(4,5)P2-preferential PH domain to bind to the PM.'
