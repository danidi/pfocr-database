caption: The apoptosis pathway. Apoptosis is activated by intrinsic and extrinsic
  pathways. In the intrinsic pathway, certain apoptotic stimuli alter the normal status
  of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (), which leads to permeabilization of the mitochondrial
  membrane. Under normal circumstances, the pro-survival proteins of the Bcl-2 family
  protect the mitochondrial membrane. Once cytochrome c (CytoC) is released into the
  cytosol, it binds to the apoptosome [], a complex of proteins made up of the apoptosis
  activating factor-1 (Apaf1) protein and the initiator caspase-9. A morphological
  change in the apoptosome results from cytochrome c binding, which causes caspase-9
  to become activated. Caspase-9 activates the effector caspase-3, leading to apoptosis
  []. Caspase-3 is known as the ‘executioner caspase’, because it activates or cleaves
  various protein targets, which is detrimental to the cell and results in death [].
  Activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 are normally inhibited by a family of proteins
  known as the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), and XIAP (X-linked IAP) is
  the most potent IAP []. In the extrinsic pathway, ligands such as Fas ligand (FasL)
  or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) bind to death receptors on the membrane of the
  host cell. Trimerization of the death receptors follows, forming what is known as
  the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which includes the Fas-associated death
  domain (FADD) adaptor protein, the Flice-like inhibitory protein (FLIP), and procaspase-8
  []. Caspase-8 is activated, which in turn directly activates caspase-3 []. In addition,
  caspase-8 activates the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, which stimulates the intrinsic
  pathway to enhance the apoptotic signal, because Bid activation eventually leads
  to cytochrome c release [].
