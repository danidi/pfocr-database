caption: Network analysis using Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software. This figure
  depicts the merged networks of proteins/molecules targeted for novel therapies in
  HNSCCs. These proteins/molecules form a complex network responsible for survival
  and proliferation of cancer cells. Therefore, targeting this complex network with
  single agents or monotherapy is often a failure as blocking a single pathway triggers
  alternate signaling cascades to activate downstream targets for survival. The bold
  lines show a direct association among different proteins/molecules while the dashed
  lines represent indirect regulation or association among these proteins. As shown,
  all members of Erb family are directly associated; hence dowregulating/blocking
  one of the members does not block downstream signaling via Ras/Raf/Mapk and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway completely. Also, as shown in figure, these pathways are also being regulated
  by Insulin, TGF-β and KDR (VEGFR), PDGFR and HIF1α.
