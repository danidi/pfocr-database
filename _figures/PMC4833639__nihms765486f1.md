caption: Many oncogenic mutations drive nutrient transporter gene expression [–].
  The post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms by which oncogenic mutations
  orchestrate enhanced nutrient uptake are not as well-studied, but could provide
  tractable drug targets. Nutrient transporters are internalized through both clathrin-dependent
  and clathrin-independent endocytosis pathways (CDE and CIE, respectively, )[]. Endocytic
  vesicles that enter through either pathway can be directed back to the membrane
  (fast-recycling), routed through the trans-Golgi network for ‘slow’ recycling, or
  sent to the lysosome for degradation. Endocytic coat proteins, their adaptors, and
  small GTPase ‘molecular switches’ such as Rab/Arf family members control the destiny
  of the cargos in these vesicles []. Decisions about nutrient transporter endocytosis,
  recycling, and lysosomal degradation are not static, but rather regulated by signal
  transduction pathways that respond to growth factors and environmental signals.
  Understanding how these trafficking decisions are made and de-regulated in cancer
  cells could expose new ways to target cancer metabolism by attacking the supply
  wagons. Below, we summarize for each class of surface nutrient transporter with
  a role in cancer anabolism what is known about the post-transcriptional regulation
  of their expression and, focusing on recent studies, potential strategies to limit
  their expression or activity.
