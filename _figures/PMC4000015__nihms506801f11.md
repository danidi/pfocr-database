caption: Modulation model of TRAK-extrinsic apoptosis by Pgp activity. (A) In the
  HeLa cellular system of tetracycline ON/OFF. The tetracycline-response-element (TRE)
  is located upstream of the minimal immediate early promoter of cytomegalovirus (PminCMV),
  which is silent in the absence of activation. In the absence of tetracycline, the
  tetracycline-trans-activator (tTA) binds the TRE and thereby activates transcription
  of MDR1 gene and its active product Pgp. In the presence of tetracycline, the (tTA)
  does not bind the TRE and thereby transcription of MDR1 is silenced. The Pgp-nonexpressing
  HeLa cells are sensitive to TRAIL-specific death. The Pgp-expressing cells are TRAIL-resistant
  but resensitized by Pgp-modulators, (B) the proposed model for the involvement of
  Pgp-activity inthe inhibition of TRAIL-dependent apoptosis. Based on the data of
  this study and the previous studies [,] that demonstrated co-localization of Pgp,
  TRAIL DR4 and DR5 receptors in the cell membrane lipid rafts micro-domains as well
  as co-immuno precipitation of both [] – we propose a model of cross-talk between
  Pgp and both DR4 and DR5 receptors of TRAIL. This cross talk involves Pgp transport
  activity, as TRAIL-dependent death is restored by Pgp-modulators.
