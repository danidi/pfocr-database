caption: 'A, Cellular arginine metabolism and putative role of arginase in the development
  of renal fibrosis. ARG1 is a cytosolic enzyme known to be expressed in the kidney
  (, ). It was originally identified in liver hepatocytes, where it catalyzes the
  hydrolysis of l-arginine to l-ornithine and urea in the final step of the urea cycle
  that allows ammonia detoxification (). Free arginine is derived from diet, protein
  turnover, or endogenous synthesis. Neo-synthesis from citrulline occurs via successive
  actions of Arginine succinate synthase (ASS) and Arginine succinate lyase (ASL).
  Cellular uptake of l-arginine is mediated by the Cationic amino acid Transporters
  CATs. Intracellular l-arginine can further be metabolized via two main distinct
  pathways: l-arginine is catabolyzed to l- citrulline and NO by NO synthases (NOS)
  (gray boxes) or alternatively to l-ornithine and urea by arginases (ARG) (light
  boxes). Evidence from literature shows that, in this context, arginase can be considered
  as a key regulator of pro- or antifibrotic pathways. First by substrate competition
  with nitric oxide (NO) synthases, arginases can regulate the production of NO known
  to have antifibrotic properties. Second, via ornithine production, arginase acts
  upstream from the mitochondrial ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) and can control
  proline formation essential for collagen synthesis in fibrosis. B, Proposed changes
  in the arginase pathway in obstructive nephropathy. The data suggest that obstructive
  nephropathy induces arginine transport and activation of the profibrotic arginase
  pathway via activation (red) of ARG2, increased expression of OAT, P5CR, and P5CS
  and decreased expression (green) of proDH, P5CD, and ODC leading to increased proline
  availability and collagen synthesis. Key to abbreviations: CAT, Cationic amino acid
