caption: An abridged general view of the CD146-ERM-actin and RhoA-PI4P5K-PIP2 signalling
  pathways is shown. In response to stimulatory factors, a CD146/moesin/RhoGDI1/PIP2
  complex is formed, which activates the RhoA-PI4P5K-PIP2 pathway. This activation
  induces PIP2 protein expression and strengthens the anchorage of CD146 to the cytoskeleton,
  which eventually leads to cell movement.
