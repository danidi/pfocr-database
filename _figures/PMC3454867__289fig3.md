caption: A schematic diagram of the yeast HOG pathway. The protein names separated
  by a thrash (/) are functionally redundant. Proteins that are specific to the Sln1
  branch are colored green, those that are specific to the Sho1 branch are colored
  blue, and those that are common are colored black. The black horizontal bar represents
  the plasma membrane. Arrows indicate activation, whereas the T-shaped bars represent
  inhibition.
