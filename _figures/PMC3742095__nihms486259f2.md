caption: 'The bioenergetics-EMT-cancer initiating cell axis in the pathogenesis of
  epithelium-originated carcinomas: a roadmap in the pursuit of targeted chemo-prevention.
  Convergence of EMT-driven acquisition of stem cell traits with bioenergetics stress-induced
  autophagy in pre-malignant phenotypes may yield cancer-initiating cells that efficiently
  couple invasive/metastatic spread to the bypass of metabolic stress- and oncogene-induced
  cellular senescence. Overgrowth in intraepithelial pre-malignant lesions with an
  increased autophagic activity may be taken as the expansion of hypoxia-adapted,
  EMT-enriched CSCs populations with increased metabolic demands and, presumably,
  of aggressive behaviour. Drugs such as chloroquine and metformin able to simultaneously
  modulate the RB tumour suppressor pathway, the EMT phenomenon and/or the autophagy
  machinery can deliver a multiple inhibitory effect to efficiently prevent invasive
  progression of pre-malignant lesions (C: chloroquine; M: metformin; RB: retinoblastoma).'
