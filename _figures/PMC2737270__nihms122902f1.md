caption: The autophagy pathway and machinery.A. Schematic illustration of events in
  autophagosome initiation, formation and maturation. Autophagy functions at basal
  levels in many cell types, but can be upregulated in response to stresses, such
  as nutrient deprivation and infection.B. Upstream signalling events converge on
  a class III PI3-K complex containing Beclin 1, as well as positive (UVRAG, Bif1,
  Ambra-1) and negative (Bcl-2/XL) regulators of initiation.C. The initiation complex
  is thought to generate PIP-3, which recruits additional Atg proteins involved in
  two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems that are required for autophagosome elongation
  and completion. Autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes containing hydrolytic enzymes
  that degrade the contents, which are recycled for use in protein synthesis or energy
  production.
