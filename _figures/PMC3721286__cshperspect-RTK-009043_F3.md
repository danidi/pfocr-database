caption: Simplified scheme presenting multiple feedback loops in the EGFR pathway.
  Upon EGFR ligation and activation, protein complexes nucleated by scaffolds are
  formed at the plasma membrane. Activated Ras induces activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK
  signaling cascade. Active ERK phosphorylates several upstream signaling regulators,
  including Raf and SOS, forming negative feedback loops. However, ERK also phosphorylates
  and inhibits RKIP, which is a negative regulator of Raf, thus creating positive
  feedback. Active ERK translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates several
  transcription factors, inducing transcription of several IEGs that are negative
  regulators of EGFR signaling. DUSPs are rapidly induced upon ERK activation, and
  some DUSPs also require phosphorylation by ERK to become fully active in order to
  dephosphorylate ERK. Another inducible inhibitor of EGFR, Mig-6, inhibits EGFR by
  blocking its kinase activity and mediating ubiquitin-independent degradation of
  EGFR. Several transcription factors induced by EGFR, such as MafF, inhibit transcription
  of genes that contain SRE in the promoter. Additional mechanism of negative regulation
  is mediated by ZFP36 that binds to the AU-rich 3′-UTR of mRNA molecules, such as
  c-fos mRNA and other IEG, targeting them for degradation. Dashed arrows represent
  indirect or unknown regulation; blue arrows represent mechanisms involving transports
  between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments.
