caption: Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto) resides in the apoplast of adjacent
  Arabidopsis cells . Besides other substances, the apoplast also contains various
  sugars, ions, and free hormones cytokinin and auxin (green and light blue chemical
  structures). Pto injects effectors via TTSS (Type III secretion system) into the
  plant cell . This causes higher auxin accumulation in the cytoplasm. Auxin also
  diffuses directly from the apoplast or is taken into the cytoplasm by AUX1 (auxin
  influx transporter) . Excess of auxin releases ARF (auxin response factor) from
  AUX/IAA (auxin repressor) and keeps auxin responses derepressed . Auxin crosstalk
  enhances synergistically the JA pathway (gray boxes) at the level of JA biosynthesis
  and downstream signaling to enhance PDF1.2 (marker for JA/ET pathway ). Auxin represses
  the SA pathway (white boxes) to cause susceptibility of Arabidopsis against the
  infection of Pto . During the course of infection, Pto decreases the level of cytokinin
  (green structures in apoplast) . Cytokinins are perceived by AHKs (Arabidopsis histidine
  kinase) and transduced by a two-component phosphorelay system (yellow boxes); the
  signal of phosphorylation is transduced from receptor to AHPs (Arabidopsis histidine
  phosphotransfer protein) in the cytoplasm . Subsequently, type-B ARRs (positive
  regulator of cytokinin response) are phosphorylated, and they in turn activate the
  expression of type-A ARRs (repressor of cytokinin signaling) . Cytokinin activates
  the SA pathway (white boxes) at the level of TGA3 via type-B ARR2 in an NPR1-dependent
  manner . In a negative feedback loop, type-A ARRs also inhibit cytokinin responses
  . Cytokinin also inhibits auxin transport by keeping PIN1 auxin efflux transporters
  arrested and thus causes imbalance in auxin flux and distribution inside the tissue
  . Auxin and cytokinin, besides mutual inhibition, contribute differentially to the
  SA-JA/ET backbone of plant defense against pathogens .
