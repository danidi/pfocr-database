caption: Currently suggested sorbicillinol biosynthesis pathway. The iterative PKS
  SorA combines three acetyl units, and the growing chain is modified by the ketoacyl
  reductase subunit, removing the keto-groups. The enoyl reductase subunit might be
  active in the second cycle, which inserts a single bond. The polyketide is handed
  over to the PKS SorB, which adds three more acetyl units and two methyl groups.
  SorB releases an aldehyde, which undergoes spontaneous cyclization, resulting in
  the formation of sorbicillin (1) or 2′,3′-dihydrosorbicillin (2), depending on whether
  the enoyl reductase subunit had been active in SorA or not. Finally, the FAD-dependent
  monooxygenase SorC transforms sorbicillin or 2′,3′-dihydrosorbicillin to sorbicillinol
  (3) or 2′,3′-dihydrosorbicillinol (4).
