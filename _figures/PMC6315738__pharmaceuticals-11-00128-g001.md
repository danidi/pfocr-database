caption: Intestinal uptake of non-heme iron and its regulation. Non-heme iron absorption
  occurs mainly in duodenal enterocytes. The first step in the transport of iron across
  the apical membrane of enterocytes is ferric (Fe3+) to ferrous (Fe2+) iron reduction,
  catalyzed by the membrane-associated ferrireductase duodenal cytochrome B (DcytB).
  Ferrous iron is subsequently transported into the enterocyte via the divalent metal
  transporter 1 (DMT1)-dependent pathway. After crossing the apical membrane, iron
  enters so called labile iron pool (LIP) in the cytosol and is subsequently used
  for cellular needs (e.g., for iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis in mitochondria), stored
  inside the cell in ferritin (Ft, which probably requires the chaperone PCBP1 (poly
  (rC) binding protein 1) to delivers iron to Ft), or exported into the circulation
  by the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) present on the basolateral membrane. Iron
  export from enterocytes also requires hephaestin (Heph), a multi-copper oxidase,
  which oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+, prior to iron binding by transferrin (Tf) in the blood.
  The expression of genes involved in iron absorption is regulated intracellularly
  at the level of transcription by hypoxia inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2α) and post-transcriptionally
  via iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2). Under iron-deficient conditions, stabilization
  of HIF2α protein leads to the transcriptional up-regulation of DcytB, Dmt1 and Fpn
  genes. In contrast, in iron replete enterocytes HIF2α undergoes accelerated proteosomal
  degradation resulting in the decrease of its transcriptional activity. At low intracellular
  iron concentrations, IRPs bind to specific iron regulatory elements (IREs) present
  in the 5′-UTR mRNAs encoding ferritin subunits (H- and L-Ft) or FPN mRNAs and block
  their translation. On the other hand, direct interactions between IRPs and several
  IRE motifs in the 3′-UTR DMT1 mRNA stabilize this transcript. The converse regulation
  of Ft subunits, FPN and DMT1 synthesis, being a consequence of the lack of binding
  of IRPs to IRE, occurs in enterocytes with high iron level. Importantly, the presence
  of IRE has also been identified in HIF2α mRNA. Binding of IRP1 (which under iron
  deficient conditions gains the ability to recognize IREs with high affinity) to
  the unique IRE in the 5′-UTR of HIF2α mRNA blocks its translation. Iron trafficking
  across the enterocyte is also controlled extracellularly by the systemic iron regulatory
  hormone hepcidin (Hepc). Hepcidin can bind to FPN, causing its internalization and
  degradation, hence decreasing iron export from enterocytes into the blood plasma.
