caption: 'Schematic outline of the intracellular signalization in the retinohypothalamic
  tract. Presynaptically, BDNF can increase glutamate and PACAP content of synaptic
  vesicles and facilitates their release. Postsynaptically, BDNF phosphorylates the
  NMDA receptor, increasing its number and the opening probability of the channel.
  BDNF furthermore enhances PACAP release. PAC1 receptor activation activates CREB
  via the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. NMDA receptor activation leads to ras activation
  directly and indirectly by increasing intracellular calcium. Ras in turn activates
  ERK that on one hand activates CREB, and on the other phosphorylates BMAL1. In addition,
  BMAL1 is regulated by the NAMPT-SIRT1, PGC-1α cycle. Peripheral signals may further
  influence these complex interactions. For example, BHB induces PGC-1α that in turn
  induces irisin expression. Irisin''s influence on BDNF expression and release is
  hypothetical in the SCN, however it was described in other brain areas. Hence, in
  the present article, we propose that peripheral signals (BHB, irisin etc.) liberated
  in response to non-photic environmental signals may modulate the permissive effect
  of BDNF. The link between irisin and BDNF in the SCN is hypothetical. BDNF: brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; PACAP: pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide;
  NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid; PAC1, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide
  type 1 receptor; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; cAMP, cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; ERK, extracellular signal–related kinase; BMAL1, brain and muscle
  ARNT-like protein 1; NAMPT, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; SIRT1, sirtuin
  1; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α; BHB, β-hydroxybutyrate;
  SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus.'
