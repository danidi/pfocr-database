caption: Metabolic pathway for NAD(P) biosynthesis in humans. NAD biosynthesis starting
  from four different sources of the pyridine ring, namely QA, Na, Nam and NamR, through
  four distinct ways. The de novo pathway (blue dotted line) allows NAD biosynthesis
  starting from QA derived from Trp and Na is processed to NAD through the Preiss–Handler
  pathway enzymes (green dotted line). Through a salvage pathway Nam and NamR can
  be transformed in NMN by NMPRTase and NamRKinase respectively. Finally, some of
  the cellular NAD can be converted into NADP by NAD kinase (EC 2.7.1.23). QAPRTase,
  quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.19); NaPRTase, nicotinic acid
  phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.11); NMPRTase, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (EC 2.4.2.12); NamRKinase, nicotinamide riboside kinase (EC 2.7.1.22); NMNAT nicotinamide
  mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.1); NADS, NAD synthetase (EC 6.3.5.1).
