caption: Production and release of extracellular mitochondrial DNA. Pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are
  released in the setting of infection or cellular injury, respectively. Both PAMPs
  and DAMPs can stimulate pattern recognition receptors, leading to increased production
  of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. This causes fragmentation of the mitochondrial
  genome and decreased mitochondrial membrane transition permeability, allowing mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) to enter the cytosol. mtDNA is a potent DAMP; it can stimulate inflammasomes
  or the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9)/nuclear factor-κB pathway, leading to the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6). Cytosolic
  mtDNA can also enter the extracellular environment via necroptosis, NETosis, or
  platelet activation, where it can propagate the initial inflammatory response through
  further recognition as a DAMP by immune and nonimmune cells expressing TLR-9. RBCs
  have been shown to scavenge extracellular mtDNA through binding to TLR-9. MTP =
  membrane transition permeability; NF-κB = nuclear factor-κB; NETosis = formation
  of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs); TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α.
