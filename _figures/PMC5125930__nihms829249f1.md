caption: The heme synthesis pathway of most bacteria begins with charged glutamyl-tRNAGlu
  to form the universal precursor ALA, and coproporphyrinogen III isformed through
  a series of conserved enzymatic steps. The classical pathway (blue) forms heme through
  the protoporphyrinogen IX intermediate; most organisms including Gram-negative bacteria
  and eukaryotes use this pathway. The noncanonical pathway (green), performed by
  most Gram-positive bacteria, produces heme through the coproporphyrin III intermediate.
  Shown for each step is the enzyme name followed by the common protein annotation
  in bold.
