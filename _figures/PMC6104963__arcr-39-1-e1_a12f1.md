caption: 'Mechanisms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Alcohol contributes to tissue
  injury directly and indirectly through mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation,
  acetaldehyde adduct formation, barrier integrity disruption, decreased anabolic
  signaling, enhanced catabolic processes (particularly through the ubiquitin proteasome
  pathway), profibrotic changes, mitochondrial dysfunction and injury, and cell membrane
  perturbations. Note: mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mTORC2, mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species. Source: Molina PE,

  and contribution to disease burden. Physiology. 2014;29(3)203–215.'
