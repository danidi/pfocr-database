caption: NaF can induce the renal inflammatory responses by increasing the NO and
  PGE2 contents, iNOS activities and mRNA expression levels as well as the COX-2,
  TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA and protein expression levels via the activation
  of NF-κB signaling pathway, and reducing the mRNA and protein expression levels
  of IL-4 and IL-10. The activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and reduction of anti-inflammatory
  mediator expression are the potential mechanisms of NaF-induced renal inflammatory
  responses.
