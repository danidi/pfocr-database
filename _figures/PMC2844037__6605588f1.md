caption: Current understanding of breast cancer progression mediated by ATX–LPA signalling
  axis. Autotaxin and LPA1–3 receptors are expressed in mammary glands and can exert
  multiple effects under physiological conditions. Lysophosphatidic acid is produce
  from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) by ATX and acts on the EDG-family LPA receptors,
  LPA1, LPA2 and LPA3. As an important pathway promoting cell survival, the ATX–LPA
  signalling axis may initiate tumourigenesis in breast by allow cells to be susceptible
  to other genetic mutations, leading to accumulation of several aberrant signalling
  pathways. Indeed, each of these components of the ATX–LPA signalling axis sufficiently
  induces tumourigenesis through upregulation of many signalling pathways, including
  PI3K, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin and ER. In addition, marked increase in the production
  of several cytokines by LPA further advance the disease progression by local inflammation
  and angiogenesis. The effects of LPA on cytokine production and blood vessel formation
  may contribute to the metastasis of breast tumours to other tissues such as bone.
