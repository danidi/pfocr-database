caption: Once Paclitaxel and Docetaxel cross both plasmatic and nuclear membranes,
  they stabilize the nuclear beta-tubulin by inhibiting the microtubules polymerization
  and the mitotic melt construction. Thus, the common mechanism of action of both
  drugs results in the cancer cell cycle arrest in G2/M phases with the consequent
  apoptosis. The persistence in cytoplasm of taxane molecules and their metabolites
  strongly affects efficacy and toxicity of therapies. In hepatocytes, these drugs
  are subjected to oxidation reactions by specific isoforms of the Cytochrome P450
  enzymes. In particular, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 have docetaxel as substrate while CYP3A4
  and CYP2C8 have paclitaxel. These reactions result in the synthesis of inactive
  metabolites that pass from the liver microsomal system into bile and then are excreted
  via fecal. The bioavailability of taxanes is also influenced by the functioning
  of ABCB1 adenosine-triphosphate binding cassettes (ABC), energy-dependent drug efflux
  pumps that regulate the drug clearance by influencing the balance between reabsorption
  from the hepatocellular system and intestinal excretion. CYP - Cytochrome P450;
  ABC - adenosine-triphosphate binding cassettes.
