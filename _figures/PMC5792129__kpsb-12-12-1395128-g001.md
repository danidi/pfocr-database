caption: A model of autophagy regulation upon stress exposure in plants. Autophagy
  is induced by different stress conditions through distinct pathways. Nutrient deficiency,
  salt and osmotic stress activate SnRK1, which negatively regulates the TOR complex.
  TOR inhibits autophagy through inhibition of ATG1 or other unknown downstream regulators.
  Osmotic stress can also induce autophagy through a SnRK1-independent pathway that
  inhibits the TOR complex. Oxidative stress induces autophagy through SnRK1 and ATG1,
  independently of TOR. ER stress induces autophagy through SnRK1 and IRE1b, and is
  TOR-independent. It is unclear whether SnRK1 and IRE1b regulate autophagy via two
  parallel pathways or within the same pathway, and their order of action is unknown.
  Arrows are color-coded according to the stress condition to which they apply. Solid
  arrows indicate pathways with experimental evidence, while dashed arrows indicate
  potential pathways that need future investigation.
