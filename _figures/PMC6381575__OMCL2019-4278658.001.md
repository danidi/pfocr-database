caption: 'Radiation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which drives
  epigenetic changes in fibroblast cells. ROS can be directly generated due to radiation
  exposure and through the damage of mitochondria. This leads to the activation of
  the TGF-β signaling pathway, which sustains an increase in ROS levels by increasing
  NOX4 expression, thereby setting up a vicious cycle of high oxidative stress, which
  drives epigenetic reprogramming of fibroblast cells to myofibroblasts. Further,
  damaged mitochondria have altered production of redox-sensitive epigenetic metabolites
  that serve as cofactors for chromatin-modifying proteins. NOXs: NADPH oxidases;
  NAD+: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; SAM: S-adenosylmethionine; α-KG: α-ketoglutarate;
  ECM: extracellular matrix.'
