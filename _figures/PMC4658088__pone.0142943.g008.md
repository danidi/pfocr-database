caption: Mdm20 (magenta) is required for actin (green) cable stabilization through
  the N-acetylation of Trpm (light blue), which is mediated by NaB activity and involved
  in vacuole inheritance through actin-Trpm fibers. However, the present data show
  that Mdm20 deficiency suppresses mTORC2 activity by reducing Rictor (orange) expression,
  which may be regulated during de novo protein synthesis by the Nat5 (blue)-independent
  pathway. Because mTORC2 activates PKCα (light purple) and regulates actin (green)
  organization and cellular motility, these data indicate that Mdm20 modulates actin
  remodeling and cellular motility through the mTORC2 pathway. Additionally, Mdm20
  regulates not only pAkt (pink), but also pFoxO1 (dark purple), through its effects
  on mTORC2 activity in response to serum starvation and insulin stimulation. Our
  findings show that Mdm20 acts as novel regulator of mTORC2 via its ability to regulate
  Rictor expression and is independent of NatB.
