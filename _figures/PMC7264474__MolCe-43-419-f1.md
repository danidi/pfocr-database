caption: (A) Ceramide is generated by a de novo synthetic pathway and further metabolized
  via a salvage pathway. Once synthesized, ceramide is converted to either glucosylceramide
  or sphingomyelin by adding glucose or phosphocholine, respectively. Ceramide is
  degraded via a catabolic pathway to sphingosine is phosphorylated by sphingosine
  kinase (SphK), which can be degraded by S1P lyase. (B) Ceramide is synthesized by
  adding fatty acyl CoA to the long chain bases (sphingosine or sphinganine) and further
  metabolized to ceramide 1-phosphate (by phosphorylation), sphingomyelin (by adding
  phosphocholine), glucosylceramide (by adding glucose), and complexed glycoceramide
  (by adding various sugars). Ceramide is also degraded to sphingosine, which can
  be phosphorylated to S1P. GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; GBA, glucocerebrosidase;
