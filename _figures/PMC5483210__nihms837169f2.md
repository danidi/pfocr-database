caption: It is known that epinephrine binding to βAR activates downstream signaling
  playing a role in cardiac contraction. However, it is well established that sustained
  sympathetic overdrive leads to deleterious cardiac dysfunction and is associated
  with βAR dysfunction. In addition, increasing evidence shows that sympathetic overdrive
  leads to generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα. Increased TNFα
  would bind to TNFR1 and R2 receptors that will non-canonically recruit GRK2 to βAR
  complex inhibiting βAR signaling. This inhibition of βAR signaling in other words
  represents βAR dysfunction, a phenotype observed in conditions of heart failure.
  Therefore, in this context it is important to note that sympathetic overdrive in
  addition to directly altering βAR function could have consequences that are mediated
  by altering TNFα and shows an additional pathway that regulate βAR function in various
  cell types.
