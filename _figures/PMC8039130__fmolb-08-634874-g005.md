caption: Butyrate enhanced the chemotherapeutical efficacy of 5-FU on HCT116 cells.
  (A) The apoptosis behaviors of HCT116 cells under various treating condition were
  measured using flow cytometry. In the first row (marked as “Con” on the left side),
  the apoptosis activities of HCT116 cells under four growth conditions were shown,
  which were treated with PBS vehicle (labeled as “Con” on the top side), 2 mM butyrate
  (labeled as “NaB”), 1.92 μM 5-FU (labeled as “5-FU”), or the combination of 2 mM
  butyrate and 1.92 μM 5-FU (labeled as “NaB+5FU”). In the second row, the apoptosis
  activities of HCT116 cells under various growth conditions as well as extra addition
  of 10.96 μM SC79 were displayed (marked as “SC79” on the left side). (B) A schematic
  view illustrating the combined effects of butyrate and 5-FU on the DNA synthesis
  and apoptosis of colon cancer cells.
