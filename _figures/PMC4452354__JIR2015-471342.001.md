caption: A schematic illustration of the transduction of signals from inflammatory
  bone diseases to brain-resident microglia through the leptomeninges and two different
  pathways for the IL-1β production activated by CGA and Aβ in microglia. In individuals
  with inflammatory bone diseases, IL-1β and TNF-α secreted by macrophages and periodontal
  bacterial components, including LPS, activate IL-1R/TNFR and TLRs localized on the
  surface of leptomeningeal cells to secrete IL-1β and TNF-α. IL-1β and TNF-α then
  stimulate both brain-resident microglia and neurons. After stimulation, the neuronal
  production and secretion of CGA and Aβ is increased. CGA and Aβ subsequently activate
  two different pathways for the IL-1β production in microglia, the NLRP3 inflammasome-CatB
  pathway via Aβ (open arrows), and the phagosome-CatB pathway via CGA (blue arrows).
  The NF-κB pathway activated during aging (red arrows) supports the production and
  secretion of IL-1β by Aβ. The leptomeningeal cell-neuron-microglia interactions
  form a vicious cycle of IL-1β production, culminating in the onset of cognitive
  impairment in AD.
