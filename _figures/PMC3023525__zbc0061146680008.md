caption: Model of the role of sFKN in microglial phagocytosis and neuroprotection.
  sFKN, which is secreted from neurons that are damaged by glutamate, promotes microglial
  phagocytosis of neuronal debris through the release of MFG-E8. sFKN also induces
  the expression of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1 in microglia via Nrf2 recruitment
  and activation of the JNK MAPK signaling pathway. The neuroprotective effects of
  sFKN are also mediated in part by activation of ERK MAPK, although the downstream
  signaling pathway has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, sFKN may be an intrinsic
  neuroprotectant for damaged yet surviving neurons.
