caption: (A) In the posterior midgut epithelium of Drosophila, damaged enterocytes
  (EC) secrete Upd cytokines upon the activation of stress signaling involving JNK
  and Yki. Upds activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway of intestinal stem cells (ISCs),
  inducing their proliferation and generating enteroblasts (EB), which go on to differentiate
  into ECs or enteroendocrine (EE) cells.(B) In imaginal discs, cell competition results
  in the induction of apoptosis in slow growing cells (‘unfit cells’, here exemplified
  by cells with a lower dose of myc). Faster growing (‘fit’) cells induce apoptosis
  in unfit cells in a p53 and JNK-dependent manner. Apoptotic cells, in turn, promote
  compensatory proliferation by inducing Dpp, Wg and Upds.(C) In the mouse epiblast,
  fit MYC over-expressing cells induce apoptosis and engulfment of unfit cells, which
  in turn promote the proliferation of fit cells through paracrine signals.(D) In
  the mouse embryo, activation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 can induce senescence.
  Senescent cells, through the SASP, fine-tune patterning and growth by supporting
  the survival and proliferation of neighboring fit cells.
