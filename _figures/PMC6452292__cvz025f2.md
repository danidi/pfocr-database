caption: The protective roles of IFN-γ and PD-L1 in the heart and the consequences
  of ICB. Normal myocardial cells in the healthy heart, including myocytes and EC,
  express only low levels of PD-L1 or Class II MHC (MHCII), but do express Class I
  MHC (MHCI). Given the high density of myocardial microvasculature, it is likely
  that effector T cells sporadically enter the uninflamed heart. If effector CD8+
  CTL specific for heart antigens enter the myocardium, they can be activated by myocardial
  cells expressing the relevant peptide-MHC I antigens, and the CTL can kill those
  cells, as well as secrete IFN-γ. Myocardial cells nearby will respond to IFN-γ by
  upregulating expression of PD-L1 and Class II MHC. If additional heart antigen-specific
  CTLs see antigen presented by these PD-L1 expressing cells, their activation will
  be suppressed by PD-1 signalling, and damage by the CTL will be limited. In cancer
  patients treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAbs, CTL activation in the heart
  may not be suppressed, and CTL-mediated damage will be enhanced. This is despite
  more IFN-γ production by the CTL and induced PD-L1 on the heart cells. Furthermore,
  because MHC II is up-regulated, CD4+ Th cells specific for heart antigens that may
  enter the now inflamed myocardium can also be activated and will not be suppressed
  by the mAb-blocked PD-1 pathway. Th cells will promote inflammation and macrophage
  activation which appears to contribute significantly to the immunopathology of ICB-associated
  myocarditis.
