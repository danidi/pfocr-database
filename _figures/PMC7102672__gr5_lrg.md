caption: 'The enriched DGEs in the PPAR signaling pathway There were three pairwise
  comparison groups (CG vs HS, CG vs HR and HS vs HR) in our study, and there were
  three kinds of DEGs from the different comparison groups. And it is hard to show
  the downregulated or upregulated information in one figure. For instance, the A
  gene was included in both the DEGs of CG vs HS group, and the CG vs HR group, and
  it was upregulated in the HS group when comparing with CG and HS, while downregulated
  in the HR group when comparing the CG and HR. Hence, we only show the group information
  of enriched DEGs with colors: Green, DGSs existing in only one pairwise comparison
  group; Red, DEGs existing in any two pairwise comparison groups; Yellow, DGSs existing
  in all three pairwise comparison groups. (For interpretation of the references to
  color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
