caption: VEGF gene expression is controlled by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α).
  In endothelial cells, synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2) and NO is one outcome of
  VEGFR activation. Reactive oxygen species can damage the promoter region of the
  VEGF gene and thus impair VEGF transcription. Activation of VEGFR2 induces NO production.
  NO and PGI2 promote endothelial cell survival. While it is known that VEGFR2 activation
  promotes NO production, the link between VEGFR2 activation and PGI2synthesis still
  needs to be established.
