caption: Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. (A) Under physiological/basal conditions, the Keap1-Cullin3
  complex promotes ubiquitin E3-ligase activity and proteasomal degradation of Nrf2.
  (B) Upon exposure to chemicals or ROS, reactive cysteine residues of Keap1 are modified
  leading to a disruption of the Keap1-Nrf2 complex and the release of Nrf2, which
  also allows de novo synthesized Nrf2 to accumulate in the cytoplasm. The phosphorylation
  of Ser-40 in the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 by PKCδ results in Nrf2 activation and translocation
  to the nucleus, where Nrf2-mediated transcriptional activity of ARE-responsive genes
  is initiated. GSK-3β phosphorylates the tyrosine kinase Fyn and induces its nuclear
  accumulation. Fyn phosphorylates Nrf2 at tyrosine-568, facilitating its nuclear
  export and degradation. (C) Loss-of-function mutations in Keap1 or Nrf2 lead to
  constitutive activation of Nrf2 by disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction. In the
  nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with sMaf proteins and regulates the expression of
  >200 oxidative stress-related genes. ARE, antioxidant response element; Fyn, proto-oncogene
  Src-family tyrosine kinase; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3; Keap1, kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1; sMaf, musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene; Nrf2,
  nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2; PKCδ, protein kinase C-δ; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species.
