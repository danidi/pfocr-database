caption: Model for butyrate-modulated transcription of C. jejuni genes via the BumSR
  TCS. BumR is hypothesized to be endogenously phosphorylated by other kinases or
  high-energy phosphodonors in the cytoplasm of C. jejuni. BumS is proposed to primarily
  function as a phosphatase to control the level of phosphorylation of BumR and its
  activity as a transcriptional regulator. BumR shows increased affinity for target
  promoter DNA in its phosphorylated form and can function as a repressor or activator
  depending on the promoter. Exogenous butyrate produced by the intestinal microbiota
  is either sensed directly by BumS after transport to the cytoplasm, sensed indirectly
  by its conversion to another metabolite that is sensed by BumS, or sensed indirectly
  by its influence on another pathway that alters the level of a factor directly sensed
  by BumS. In any case, increased levels of exogenous butyrate are expected to have
  a negative influence on BumS phosphatase activity, which results in increased phospho-BumR
  levels to influence transcriptional outcomes.
