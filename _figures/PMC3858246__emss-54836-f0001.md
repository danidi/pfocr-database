caption: 'Canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling and inhibitors. (A) WNT—off state: In
  the absence of WNT ligands, the destruction complex (containing Axin, APC, WTX,
  GSK3 and CKI) promotes N-terminal phosphorylation of β-catenin. This leads to ubiquitin-mediated
  proteasomal degradation of β-catenin and keeps intracellular levels low. Meanwhile,
  TCF/LEF type transcription factors recruit Groucho and histone deacetylases to repress
  WNT target genes. (B) WNT—on state: once WNT ligands bind to FZ/LRP6 co-receptors,
  the cytoplasmic tail of LRP6 is phosphorylated, the β-catenin destruction complex
  is inhibited through recruitment of its components to the FZ/LRP/DVL complex. Consequently,
  β-catenin accumulates intracellularly, translocates to the nucleus, and displaces
  Groucho from TCF/LEF. This interaction promotes the transcription of WNT target
  genes. Inhibitors of the WNT/β-catenin pathway (depicted in red) are shown and include:
  1) agents targeting WNTs: antibodies against WNTs; soluble WNT receptors; proteins
  acting like WNT inhibitory proteins (WIF) and secreted frizzled related proteins
  (SFRPs); 2) FZ receptor antibody; 3) LRP inhibitors, acting like the members of
  the Dickkopf (DKK) family; 4) compounds targeting the PDZ domain of Dishevelled
  (DVL), responsible of DVL/FZ interaction and signal transduction; 5) molecules which
  stabilize the Axin protein; 6) molecules that inhibit Porcupine (Porc), an enzyme
  essential for WNT lipidation and secretion; 7) β-catenin/TCF and β-catenin/CPB interaction
  antagonists'
