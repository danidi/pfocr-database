caption: 'Central carbon metabolic network is composed of photosynthesis in the chloroplast,
  transport reaction from the chloroplast to cytosol, glycolysis, carbohydrate synthesis,
  citric acid cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, lipids synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation,
  protein, DNA, RNA, chlorophyll and biomass synthesis. Photosynthesis is decomposed
  into two steps: the light step, which generates energy (ATP and NADPH) and oxygen
  using light and water and the dark step, which uses the generated energy to incorporate
  carbon dioxide. The end-product of photosynthesis is a 3 carbon sugar (here glyceraldehyde
  3-phoshate written GAP), exported to the cytosol. GAP is situated in the center
  of glycolysis, and splits it into two parts: upper glycolysis and lower glycolysis.
  Upper glycolysis generates glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), which is then either invested
  for carbohydrates synthesis or in the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH.
  Lower glycolysis generates phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is then invested either
  in lipids synthesis or in the citric acid cycle, which produces necessary intermediate
  metabolites for proteins, DNA, RNA, chlorophyll and biomass synthesis. Cofactors
  (FADH, NADH) generated by citric acid cycle are transformed into energy (ATP) thanks
  to oxidative phosphorylation.'
