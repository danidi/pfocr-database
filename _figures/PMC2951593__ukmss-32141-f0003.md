caption: Biological association networks of the significantly downregulated genes
  associated with the ontological “regulation of transcription” (A) and “MAPK signaling
  pathway” (B) classes. Each node in network maps is linked to an html page showing
  the protein annotation based on available public databases. Small square boxes connecting
  2 nodes are linked to an html page showing the type of effect (positive or negative)
  and the supporting Medline references.
