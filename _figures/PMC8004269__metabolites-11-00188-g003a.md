caption: 'Schematic representations of traced phospholipid biosynthetic pathways in
  this study. Selected PC and PE biosynthetic pathways relevant to this study were
  obtained from the literature and the KEGG Pathway Database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html;
  15 January 2021). The deuterated tracers (D4-ethanolamine, D3-methionine, and D9-choline)
  used to substitute their hydrogenated counterparts in cell culture media are circled
  and the pathways they participate in are detailed. D4-ethanolamine traces the CDP-ethanolamine
  pathway (A); D9-choline can be used to trace the CDP-choline pathway (B). Notably,
  the supplementation of D9-choline can also give rise to D3-methionine, via betaine
  aldehyde and betaine [,,], as shown in panel (B). D3-methionine traces the PEMT
  pathway and can produce D3, D6, and D9 PC and LPC species (C). EK: ethanolamine
