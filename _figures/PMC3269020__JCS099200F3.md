caption: Role of miRNAs in aging of mice. miR-34a, miR-93, miR-214, miR-669c and miR-709
  are upregulated in aged murine liver tissue. Moreover, miR-27a is increased in the
  liver of the long-lived Ames dwarf mouse compared with levels in wild-type mice.
  miR-1 is upregulated in a progeroid mouse model and targets IGF1 in the liver. In
  aging brain tissue, miR-22, miR-101a, miR-720 and miR-721 are upregulated. Furthermore,
  miR-470, miR-669b and miR-681 have increased levels in the brains of long-lived
  Ames dwarf mice and growth hormone receptor knockout mice, whereas miR-30e, miR-34a
  and miR-181a are decreased in long-lived calorie-restricted mice. Finally, miR-7,
  miR-468, miR-542 and miR-698 are increased in aging murine skeletal muscle, whereas
  miR-124a, miR-181a, miR-221, miR-382, miR-434 and miR-455 are decreased. The targets
  for some of these miRNAs have been identified and shown to have numerous functions
  during aging, such as hormonal signaling (IIS pathway), apoptosis (BCL2) and mitochondrial
  activity (electron transport chain components); see text for details.
