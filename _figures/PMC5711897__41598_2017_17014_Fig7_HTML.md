caption: 'Impact of key mutations on central carbon metabolism in C. glutamicum. (A)
  Overview of the metabolic context of identified key mutations, including glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Abbreviations:
  Glc: glucose, Frc: fructose, Gnt: gluconate, Rib: ribose, G6P: glucose 6-phosphate,
  F6P: fructose 6-phospahte, FBP: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, G3P: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
  DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate, PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate, Gnt-6P: gluconate 6-phosphate,
  Rib5P: ribose 5-phosphate, Ri5P: ribulose 5-phopshate, GlcEII: glucose-specific
  enzyme IIB component of the phosphotransferase system, CorA: Mg2+ transporter, GntP:
  gluconate permease, ABC: Rib-ATP: ATP dependent ABC-transporter. (B) Postulated
  impact of key mutations in pyk, fruK and corA. We hypothesize that mutations in
  pyk and fruK both contribute to an elevated glucose uptake by increasing the PEP
  pool (pyk mutations) or by an accumulation of hexose phosphates (fruK) relieving
  SugR repression. Finally, our data suggest that mutations in corA (Mg2+ import)
  are likely epistatic and may act synergistically to increase glycolytic flux by
  reducing intracellular Mg2+ levels.'
