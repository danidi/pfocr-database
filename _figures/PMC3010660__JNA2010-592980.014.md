caption: 'SOS response: As a result of massive DNA damage and failure of all possible
  repair mechanisms, RecA proteins is expressed, which activate the auto breakdown
  of LexA proteins, allowing the induction of all SOS responding genes. The pathway
  of SOS response is reversed when damages are repaired through the damage specific
  mechanisms. Here the inactivation of RecA protein allows the accumulation of LexA,
  which bind to SOS promoters and repress all SOS responding genes. SOS response is
  highly mutagenic due to involvement of DNA polymerase V/IV.'
