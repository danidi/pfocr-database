caption: 'Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed either by β-secretase into
  a nonamyloidogenic pathway or by β- and γ-secretases to produce β-amyloid peptide
  (βA). βA could decrease choline acetyltransferase (CAT, the acetylcholine synthesis
  enzyme) activity. It lowers the availability of the substrates for acetylcholine
  (ACh) synthesis by impairing high-affinity choline uptake and acetyl coenzyme A
  (acetyl CoA) production; therefore ACh release is also diminished. Choline deprivation
  could initiate the so-called “autocannibalism” process through which ACh neurons
  break down membrane phosphatidylcholine to increase choline availability. Autocannibalism
  could be partly responsible for neuronal loss in the basal nucleus of Meynert (BNM),
  medial septal nucleus (S), and nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (DB), and for
  the observed decrease in muscarinic M2 and nicotinic (N) receptor densities, which
  are mainly presynaptic. Muscarinic M, receptors are mainly postsynaptic and their
  density is not affected in Alzheimer''s disease. However, they are probably dysfunctional
  because of receptor-G protein uncoupling, with two consequences: (i) lowered M,
  signal transduction favors the amyloidogenic APP processing pathway, which further
  aggravates uncoupling; and (ii) through loss of inhibition of mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinase, which results in increased tau protein phosphorylation, and
  inhibition of phosphatase, which results in a lesser dephosporylation of tau, it
  favors the formation of paired helical filaments (PHF). .'
