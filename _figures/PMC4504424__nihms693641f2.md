caption: Pathway analysis of cytokines determined to be up-regulated in plasma collected
  from pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. The pathway map was generated by adding
  the cytokines increased in the plasma of untreated pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
  those cytokines that were found to be increased in chemotherapy-treated pancreatic
  adenocarcinoma versus chemonaive into a new pathway map in IPA and have IPA determine
  the relationships. S100A9 was then added to the map given the importance of S100A9
  in the myeloid chemotaxis pathway, and IPA was utilized to predict the relationships
  between the cytokines and S100A9. IL-6 is a central regulator of MDSC biology and
  pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software confirmed this finding.
  In addition, the protein S100A9, although not part of the BioPlex® analysis, appears
  to be important in signaling in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Dashed line
  arrows signify indirect relationships. Solid lines with arrows represent direct
  relationships. A solid line parallel to the arrow signifies inhibition. Proteins
  that regulate themselves have a solid line pointed to themselves (e.g., S100A9,
  IL-4, CCL5 (RANTES), IL-6). The proteins have different shapes based on their categorization
  in IPA. Cytokines have a Y shape. S100A9 and PDGF-BB are not placed in any one particular
  group which is why they have circular shapes
