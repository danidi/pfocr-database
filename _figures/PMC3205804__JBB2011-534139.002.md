caption: From a physiological point of view, exfoliated epithelial cells resulting
  from nutritional induction or mild stress are in anoikis by activating a survival
  mechanism partly using the molecular paths of macroautophagy. Macroautophagy, here
  referred to as autophagy has been described in amino-acid-free (a) as well as in
  glucose-free (b) situations. Autophagosome elongation is triggered by lipid modification
  of LC3 (by phosphatidylethanolamine, PE). The first pathway is linked to growth
  factors and nutrient-sensing pathways (a), and the second is related to energy-sensing
  pathway (b). Detachment of extracellular matrix induces both pathways and may activate
  also the integrated stress response through PERK and eIF2alpha, [] as such the situation
  of exfoliated cells is complex and needs more biochemical description to delineate
  stable molecular tags, useful in assay design, from the labile ones. The experimental
  starvation of primary or cancerous cells in culture consists in exposing cells to
  eagle minimum essential medium without serum for few hours. Under these conditions,
  amino-acid-free situations have been described [, ]. Phosphorylation involving Ulk1
  in AMPK regulation has been demonstrated []. Survivin has also been involved in
  the inhibition of the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II form (i.e., acting as an inhibitor
  of autophagosome formation—[]) but in cancer cells or stem cells. However, the role
  of survivin in the turnover of adult cells is still debated [, ]. The expression
  of survivin has been reported in gastric parietal cells both in adult rat and human
  []. Gastric exfoliated epithelial cells of preterm infants do express high amount
  of survivin suggesting a crucial role of this molecule in the survival of these
  cells [, ]. Glucose starvation occurs at birth [, ]. Along with cytokines and drugs,
  nutritional factors are now considered to be able to alter the balance between cellular
  survival and death [].
