caption: 'Graphical representation of selected gene transcripts up-regulated in response
  to growth at elevated [CO2]. The arrows and boxes indicate metabolic steps, pathways,
  or metabolite pools in central C and N metabolism. The colored dots indicate that
  a gene encoding an enzyme for that step or pathway is significantly up-regulated
  at elevated [CO2]. The color of the dot indicates the degree of up-regulation at
  elevated [CO2] relative to ambient [CO2] controls (E to A ratio): the darker the
  color, the greater the up-regulation (see insert). Each spot signifies an individual
  gene and is coded to the complete list of clones in .'
