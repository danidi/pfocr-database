caption: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is thought to arise from preinvasive
  PanIN lesions (top) that have sustained mutational activation of the Kras pathway.
  Our work and that of our colleagues,, indicate that acinar cells can serve as the
  source of mouse PanINs and PDAC. We have further shown that activation of the Notch
  pathway, which is observed in human PanINs and PDAC, dramatically accelerates the
  Kras-driven conversion of acinar cells to PanINs. Intraductal pupillary mucinous
  neoplasms (IMPNs, bottom) are thought to represent an alternative precursor lesion
  to PDAC. As discussed in the text, IPMNs may arise from centroacinar or ductal cells
  following activation of the PI-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Interestingly, while most
  IPMNs have activating KRAS mutations, similar to PanINs and PDAC, a subset also
  harbors activating PIK3CA mutation that do not occur in PDAC. PIK3CA mutant lesions
  are therefore unlikely to give rise to the invasive tumors that are most fatal to
  patients.
