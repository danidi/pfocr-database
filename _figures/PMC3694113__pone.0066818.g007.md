caption: Two different types of stimuli are able to activate the inflammasome, pathogen
  associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the one hand and damage associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs) on the other. A 2-hit-theory has been postulated, stating that
  for inflammasome activation two distinct signals are required. Only thereafter proIL-1β
  is cleaved by caspase-1, so that mature IL-1β can be secreted by macrophages and
  promote the inflammatory response.
