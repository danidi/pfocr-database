caption: Figure 1. Blocking B7-H4 in the tumor microenvironment with specific antibodies
  potentiates antitumor immune responses. T cells recognize antigens complexed with
  MHC class I (MHCI) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and
  some cancer cells, through the T-cell receptor (TCR). The binding of B7-H4 expressed
  by malignant cells, APCs and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to a putative ligand
  (B7-H4L*) on the surface of T cells significantly impairs the activation of the
  latter within the tumor microenvironment. The simultaneous blockade of B7-H4 on
  various cellular components of the tumor mass, as obtained with specific monoclonal
  antibodies, can revert T-cell inhibition and hence favor the elicitation of T cell-mediated
  antitumor responses.
