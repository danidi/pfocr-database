caption: Expression differences within the IIS/TOR pathway for the four comparison
  types. For genes in the IIS/TOR pathway, the expression difference are indicated
  by color, with color gradations from − 1 or less, to 1 or greater, using PathVisioRPC
  []. Each gene is broken into four boxes (left to right), with the expression differences
  for the four comparisons shown (see legend on left). The data in this figure was
  not filtered by a statistical cut-off. On the bottom, the change in expression for
  six genes downstream of IIS/TOR is shown, with the citation indicated above the
  gene (1) [] (2) [] and (3) []. Note that the expression differences are calculated
  as the difference between mean expression estimates, as ln-RPKM, and differences
  are equivalent to the ln-fold change
