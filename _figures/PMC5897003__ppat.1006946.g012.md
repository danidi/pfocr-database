caption: '(A) Proposed ancestral TRI cluster based on the distribution of TRI genes
  among fungi examined in the current study. (B) Proposed ancestral trichothecene
  biosynthetic pathway based on inferred gene content of the ancestral TRI cluster
  and knowledge of TRI gene functions. (C) The presence of two acetyl/acyl transferase
  genes in the proposed ancestral cluster raises the possibility of a branch at the
  end of the ancestral pathway that would result in the formation of two trichothecene
  analogs: 4-acetyl EPT and 4-butenoyl EPT.'
