caption: Schematic diagram for the SCGB3A2-induced inhibition of the TGFβ signaling
  pathway. SCGB3A2 inhibits collagen production through STAT1 phosphorylation and
  increases expression of SMAD7, which inhibits TGFβ-mediated SMAD2/3 activation.
  A newly synthesized molecule X mediates the SCGB3A2-induced STAT1 phosphorylation.
