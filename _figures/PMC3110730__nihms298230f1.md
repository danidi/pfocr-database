caption: Wnt signaling and regulation of β-catenin in tumorigenesis. In the presence
  of Wnt signaling, or after mutations of APC, axin, or β-catenin, the phosphorylation
  and degradation of β-catenin are blocked. This leads to the accumulation of β-catenin
  in the nucleus, where it binds to TCF4 and promotes transcriptional activation of
  target genes including c-Myc and cyclin D1. The transcriptional co-activator complex
  CREBBP/p300 interacts with β-catenin and synergistically activates β-catenin/TCF4
  transcriptional activation. In the absence of Wnt signaling, the cytoplasmic degradation
  complex of APC, GSK3β, CKI, and β-catenin forms leading to the phosphorylation of
  β-catenin, ultimately leading to its ubiquitination and its degradation in the proteasome.
  Somatic β-catenin mutations have been seen in pilomatricomas as well as other tumors
  associated with DM. Germline APC mutations result in Gardner syndrome. Germline
  CREBBP and p300 mutations result in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. We believe that the
  association between DM and pilomatricomas, as well as the other tumors that have
  been reported in these patients involves the upregulation of β-catenin via the Wnt
  signaling pathway, possibly via the actions of CUGBP or MBNL
