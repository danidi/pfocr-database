caption: General scheme of SpvB-mediated bacterial translocation during Salmonella
  infection. Salmonella effector SpvB released into the intestinal epithelial cell
  could lead to F-actin rearrangement and suppression of PKC signaling pathway, which
  contributes to the cellular redistribution of Claudin-1, Occludin and E-cadherin
  junctional proteins. This SpvB-mediated dysfunction of intestinal epithelial barrier
  integrity thereby facilitates bacterial translocation via the paracellular route
  to promote Salmonella systemic dissemination. AJ, adherens junction; AJC, apical
  junctional complex; IEC, intestinal epithelial cells; PKC, protein kinase C; SCV,
  Salmonella-containing vacuole; TJ, tight junction.
