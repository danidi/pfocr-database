caption: Original model (left panel) proposed for Tor1,2 regulation of Gln3 phosphorylation
  and localization (, ) as well as influence of methionine sulfoximine (Msx) on Tor
  pathway regulation (). A more recent version of the Tor regulatory pathway incorporating
  data from Jacinto et al. (), Loewith et al. () Re-inke et al. (), Rohde et al. ()
  Wang et al. (), and Yan et al. (). For the sake of simplicity neither model is exhaustive
  in detailing all of the known components and/or protein-protein interactions and
  protein modifications.
