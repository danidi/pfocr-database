caption: Model for TMPRSS2-ERG regulation of the IGF1R gene. Schematic representation
  of the activation of the IGF1R gene by oncogenic ERG. In prostate cancer cells expressing
  the chimera, androgens, acting via the androgen receptor (AR), promote transcription
  of the ERG oncogene. Androgen-stimulated ERG expression results from the fusion
  of ERG to the androgen sensitive TMPRSS2 promoter. Subsequently, ERG accumulates
  and transactivates the IGF1R promoter either directly or through complex protein-protein
  interactions with a series of DNA-binding proteins. Enhanced IGF1R gene expression
  leads to high levels of expression of the receptor at the cell surface, with ensuing
  activation by locally produced or circulating IGF1 and/or IGF2. IGF1R overexpression
  is a typical feature of most cancers and transformed cell lines
