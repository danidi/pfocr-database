caption: The metabolite profile of the carnitine metabolism pathway. The schematic
  diagram of the pathway. Yellow box indicates metabolite not measured in the metabolomic
  discovery, green box indicates metabolite measured but did not change in response
  to peptide treatment, blue box indicates metabolite that was down-regulated compared
  to control
