caption: Activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway mediates obesity-induced inflammation
  and metabolic disorders. Obesity reduces the expression levels of disulfide bond
  A oxidoreductase like protein (DsbA-L) in adipose tissue, leading to mitochondrial
  stress and subsequent mtDNA release into the cytosol. Aberrant localization of mtDNA
  in the cytosol activates the cGAS-cGAMPSTING pathway, leading to enhanced inflammatory
  gene expression and insulin resistance. Phosphorylated and activated TBK1 exerts
  a feedback inhibitory role by promoting STING ubiquitination and degradation or
  stimulating phosphorylation-dependent degradation of NF-kB–inducing kinase (NIK),
  thus attenuating cGAS-cGAMP STING–mediated inflammatory response [from Bai and Liu
  ()]. Figure created with Biorender.com.
