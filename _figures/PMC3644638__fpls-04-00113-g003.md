caption: Model of ethylene-, jasmonate-, and salicylate-dependent pathway illustrating
  major cross-talk signaling nodes and marker genes. (A) Changes in redox metabolites
  and gene expression in response to caterpillar herbivory. Illustrates caterpillar
  herbivory-dependent changes compared to control plants. Cellular GSSG, which is
  linked to the induction of JA-defenses, decrease transiently 35 min after caterpillar
  herbivory. Markers of the SA, ORA59, and AtMYC2 pathway, respectively AtPR1, AtHEL,
  and AtLOX2, are induced in response to herbivory. (B) Proposed model caterpillar
  labial saliva (LS) mediated suppression of jasmonate-dependent responses. Illustrates
  LS-associated changes between plants fed on by caterpillars with intact vs. impaired
  salivary secretions. Asterisks indicate LS-associated changes. Herbivory by caterpillars
  with impaired salivary secretions result in cellular oxidative stress (lower total
  and reduced cellular GSH levels) compared to controls. Induction of the AtPR1 and
  suppression of AtPDF1.2 and ERF1 are LS-dependent. Involvement of glutathione orTGA
  transcription factors are indicated in brackets underneath the marker gene.
