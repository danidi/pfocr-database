caption: Schematic diagram of the Shh signalling pathway1. Shh is released from cells,
  following processing to N-fragment; release requires Disp1.2. Shh binds avidly to
  several transmembrane proteins, including Gas1, Boc and Cdon; these proteins are
  thought to enhance presentation of Shh to the key receptor protein, Ptch1.3. Ptch1
  acts to inhibit Smo, by preventing translocation of Smo into the cilium.4. Upon
  binding of Shh, the inhibitory action of Ptch1 on Smo is repressed, allowing activation
  of Smo.5. Smo is phosphorylated by GRK2, and physically interacts with β-arrestin2,
  triggering internalisation in clathrin-coated pits.6. A complex is formed between
  activated Smo, β-arrestin2 and Kif3a; activated Smo relocates to the tip of the
  cilium.7. This causes relocation of the Gli proteins from cytoplasmic microtubule-associated
  punctae to the distal cilial tip.8. Formation of cilia and transport of proteins
  into (anterograde) and out of (retrograde) involves a number of IFT proteins, including
  Complex B, Complex A, kinesin motors and cytoplasmic dynein motors. Sufu interacts
  with full length Gli proteins, at the tip of the cilia.9. Full length Gli2 (and
  to a lesser extent Gli3) undergoes “activation” to become a transcriptional activator.
  The precise molecular details are poorly understood, but a key step is the dissociation
  of full length Gli proteins from Sufu, an event that is inhibited by PKA and stimulated
  by Kif3a. Other activation events include phosphorylation by ULK3, translocation
  into the nucleus and destabilization. Activation of Gli2 is potentiated by MIM/BEG4
  and inhibited by Sufu and by recruitment of SAP18 and the histone deacetylation
  machinery (HDAC).10. Gli3 (and to a lesser extent Gli2) undergoes cleavage to form
  a repressor; this involves sequential phosphorylation by PKA then GSK3β and CK1,
  binding of β-TrCP and proteolytic processing.11. Gli proteins can also be targeted
  for degradation; Spop promotes ubiquitination by Cullin E3 Ubiquitin ligase and
  degradation through the 26S-proteasome. Sufu stabilises Gli proteins by inhibiting
  Spop.12. A number of proteins are required for ciliogenesis (Mks1, Fuz, Intu, C2cd3,
  Rpgrip1l) and are required to form both Gli activator and repressor proteins. Arl13b
  and Tulp3 inhibit formation of Gli activator, but do not affect Gli repressor; Fkbp8
  also results in reduced Gli activator; Rab23 inhibits Gli activator and promotes
  Gli repressor formation.13. Transmembrane protein Hhip binds Shh ligand and represses
  pathway activity.
