caption: Cholesterol-dependent inflammatory response and cell death in the hepatocyte.
  Cholesterol and fatty acids are delivered to the hepatocyte from remnant particles
  or as free fatty acids after increased lipolysis in the adipose tissue. The increased
  flux of fatty acids through mitochondrial oxidation alongside cholesterol-induced
  mitochondrial dysfunction result in an increased burden of reactive oxygen intermediates.
  In particular in the presence of ω-6-polyunsaturated fatty acids, this leads to
  an increased production of lipid peroxidation products such as malondialdehyde or
  4-hydroxynonenal. Cholesterol may be excreted into the bile via ABCG5/8 or after
  conversion into bile acids via the bile salt export pump. Alternatively, it may
  react with fatty acids to inert cholesterol esters that are either exported together
  with triglycerides into VLDL or, if VLDL production reaches its limit, stored in
  lipid droplets. Excess cholesterol is converted into oxysterols, in particular in
  the presence of reactive oxygen species. Oxysterol may activate the liver X receptor
  that directly or indirectly triggers the synthesis of ABCG5/8 and enzymes involved
  in the fatty acid synthesis. The latter contributes further to the lipid burden
  of the hepatocyte. Oxysterols may also activate NFκB and thereby enhance, for example,
  the production of pro-IL-1β. At the same time, free cholesterol and cholesterol
  crystals formed in lipid droplets may cause ER stress and thereby activate the inflammasome,
  which converts pro-IL-1β into the secreted mature form. Oxysterols and cholesterol
  may trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Oxysterols in addition may inhibit
  Akt-dependent survival pathways. 4-HNE = 4-hydroxynonenal, ABCG = ATP-cassette transport
