caption: 'Involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in the development
  of neurodegenerative diseases. DAMPs or extrinsic/intrinsic factors activate microglia
  that lead to ROS production and proinflammatory cytokines release that in turn alter
  neuronal functions and induce cell death. This creates a vicious cycle that favors
  mtDNA and DAMP production, activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Selective NLRP3 inhibitors,
  antioxidants, specific inhibitors that block the necroptotic pathway, anti-TNFα,
  NSAIDs and plant derivatives can prevent this mechanism. DAMPs: damage-associated
  molecular patterns; NLRP3: NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3; NSAID: nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs; mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
