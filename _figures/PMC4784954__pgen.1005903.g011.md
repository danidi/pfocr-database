caption: Data from this study and the complementary work [] as well as previous reports
  concerning ripening control and information on tomato ARF2A and the ARF protein
  family was integrated and presented in a general scheme. ARF2A exerts its activity
  through the ethylene-dependent ripening pathway by impacting ripening regulators
  such as ones of the MADS-Box and AP2 protein families, genes associated with ethylene
  biosynthesis and signaling, carotenoid as well as other ripening metabolic pathways.
  The induction of ripening is likely indirect through an additional factor which
  functions as a ripening-repressor. ARF2A functions as a negative regulator, reducing
  the expression of the unknown ripening-repressor and thus activating the expression
  of several ‘master’ regulators and downstream ripening genes. It appears that ARF2A
  obtains signals from at least three hormone pathways, including ABA, auxin and ethylene
  while its activity impacts ABA, cytokinins and salicylic acid, at least at the level
  of hormone biosynthesis. The ASR1 protein likely interacts with ARF2A and together
  they fine tune the sensitivity of the fruit tissue to ethylene and to the capacity
  to ripen.
