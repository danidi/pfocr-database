caption: Illustrative Model of the Beneficial Role of HRE-MMP-9 in the Delayed Phase
  of tMCAOIllustrative model in the brain of NS/GFP (A), MMP-9 (B), SB (C), and SU
  (D) mice after ischemia. (A) Glial scar formed after tMCAO; few vessels and neurons
  were left in the peri-infarct area. (B) HRE-MMP-9 overexpression induced glial scar
  degradation; then, more EPCs migrated to the peri-infarct area. Both EPCs and MMP-9
  contribute to angiogenesis via the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway in the injury site,
  and neovascularization promoted neurogenesis and synaptogenesis after ischemic injury.
  (C) SB-3CT inhibited glial scar degradation induced by MMP-9; few vessels and neurons
  were found in the peri-infarct area. (D) VEGFR2 inhibitor (SU5416) prevented neovascularization
  after glial scar degradation; few vessels and neurons were found in the peri-infarct
  area. NS, normal saline; GFP, Lenti-HRE-GFP; MMP-9, Lenti-HRE-MMP-9; SB, Lenti-HRE-MMP9
  plus SB-3CT; SU, Lenti-HRE-MMP9 plus SU5416.
