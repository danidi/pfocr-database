caption: In epithelial cells, upon interaction with putative ligand(s) present on
  the cell surface of neighboring cells or in the extracellular matrix, CD43 activates
  the PI3K/AKT pathway that results in the inhibition of the Hippo pathway by a mechanism
  involving Merlin phosphorylation and degradation, thus favoring cell survival and
  proliferation. Depending of the cellular context, signaling from intracellular CD43
  located either on membrane vesicles or the nuclear membrane may also contribute
  to cellular transformation. Nonetheless, this might not be sufficient to overcome
  the anti-proliferative and death effects resulting from the activation of the ARF-p53
  pathway also induced by CD43 [24]. However, in transformed cells with an impaired
  p53 pathway resulting from oncogenic signals like those provided by the E6 oncoprotein
  from HPV16, CD43 signaling promotes cells proliferation and tumor formation.
