caption: 'Summary of fatty acid and glucose metabolism. Glucose is taken up by Glut-1
  and Glut-4 transporters and is converted by glycolysis to pyruvate which enters
  the mitochondria to be oxidized, producing acetyl coenzyme A (CoA). Fatty acids
  are liberated from lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and taken up by fatty
  acid translocase (CD36) and fatty acid binding protein (FABP). Long-chain fatty
  acyl-CoA synthetase (LCAS) converts the fatty acid to a CoA ester which is then
  taken up by the carnitine shuttle system to the mitochondria. The fatty acyl CoA
  undergoes β-oxidation, removing two carbons per turn of the cycle and generating
  acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA, generated by either pathway, enters the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle to generate reducing equivalents [reduced nicotinamide adenide dinucleotide
  (NADH)]. These pass electrons to the electron transport chain which creates an electrochemical
  proton gradient to drive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. ATP synthesis is
  coupled to the systems which create the ATP demand. FACS: Fatty acyl-CoA synthase;
  CPT: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase; CAT: Carnitine acyl transferase; AGE: Advanced
  glycosylation end-product; PDH: Pyruvate dehydrogenase; MCT: Monocarboxylate transporter;
