caption: Through a multiple-step process, growth factors stimulate AKT, which in turn
  phosphorylates and inhibits the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; comprising TSC1
  and TSC2). TSC acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase RAS
  homologue enriched in brain (RHEB), promoting hydrolysis of its bound GTP and thus
  inhibiting RHEB. Upon inhibition of TSC, GTP-bound RHEB levels increase and can
  potently activate mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), presumably at
  the lysosome. In addition to growth factors, mTORC1 can be regulated by stress,
  energy status and amino acids. Stress and energy status regulate mTORC1 through
  TSC. Moreover, AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is activated in response to a
  low energy status and phosphorylates RAPTOR (regulatory- associated protein of mTOR)
  and TSC2. This results in the inhibition of mTORC1. Amino acids regulate mTORC1
  in a TSC-independent pathway. Collectively multiple stimuli modulate mTORC1 to control
  cell growth and autophagy. DEPTOR, DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein;
  mLST8, mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8; PRAS40, 40 kDa Pro-rich AKT substrate.
