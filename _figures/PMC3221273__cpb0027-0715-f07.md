caption: Proposed model. A. In the cell without PC1 expression, the PI3K/Akt pathway
  is not active, and PC2 is retained in the ER. Extracellular signals that activate
  the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway induce production of IP3 to activate the IP3R.
  Activation of the IP3R releases Ca2+ from within the ER to cytosol. PC2, which is
  retained in the ER interacts with IP3R and facilitates the release of Ca2+. Enhancement
  of Ca2+ release by PC2-IP3R interaction eventually leads to Ca2+ depletion in the
  ER and activation of the store-operated Ca2+ influx (SOC). Blue arrow represents
  Ca2+ movement, and orange arrow represents activation of inhibition (arrow with
  flat head) of cellular activities. B. In the cell with PC1 expression, the PI3K/Akt
  pathway is activated. This signaling pathway leads to an increase of STIM1-IP3R
  complex, reduction of the PC2-IP3R interaction in the ER, and probably translocation
  of PC2 from the ER to the plasma membrane. PC2 interacts with PC1 at the plasma
  membrane to serve as a Ca2+ influx channel. Extracellular signals that activate
  the PLC pathway induce production of IP3 to activate the IP3R. Activation of the
  IP3R will stimulate Ca2+ release, however, reduction of the PC2-IP3R interaction
  and increased the association of STIM1-IP3R inhibit release of intracellular Ca2+
  that eventually keeps the Ca2+ level within the ER high, and therefore inactivate
  the SOC.
