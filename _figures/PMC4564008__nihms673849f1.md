caption: (A) In Drosophila, dPtc localized at the plasma membrane suppresses dSmo
  activity in the absence of Hh. An unknown E3 ligase (E3?) promotes internalization
  and degradation of dSmo. Sufu sequesters full-length Ci (CiFL) in the cytoplasm
  and protects CiFL from spurious Cul3-HIB-mediated degradation. CiFL is also targeted
  by Cul1-Slimb for partial degradation to the repressor form CiR leading to repression
  of pathway target genes. Nuclear export of the spliceosome factor Crn by an unknown
  substrate (S) allows functional Sufu mRNA to be translated. (B) Hh binding to dPtc
  releases its inhibition on dSmo. UBPY/USP8 reverses dSmo ubiquitination and promotes
  dSmo accumulation at the plasma membrane, although this can also occur in the absence
  of Hh. Activated dSmo recruits Smurf to the plasma membrane where Smurf mediates
  the internalization and degradation of dPtc. Cul1-Slimb-mediated CiR formation is
  inhibited, allowing for formation of the activator form CiA and activation of pathway
  target genes including hib. HIB functions in a negative feedback manner by promoting
  the degradation of CiFL. Cul3-HIB also targets the unknown substrate S for degradation,
  allowing Crn to accumulate in the nucleus where it inhibits formation of functional
  Sufu mRNA and leads to reduced Sufu protein synthesis. (C) In vertebrates, in the
  absence of Hh ligands, Ptch1 suppresses activation of vSmo, which is internalized
  and degraded by an unknown E3 ligase. Sufu protects full-length Gli2 and Gli3 (GliFL)
  from Cul3-Spop-mediated degradation. Sufu also promotes the partial degradation
  of GliFL to GliR by Cul1-βTrCP. (D) In the presence of Hh ligands, Ptch1 is internalized
  and degraded by Smurf1/2. An unknown deubiquitinase (DUB) decreases vSmo ubiquitination
  and degradation. Sufu is degraded in a Cul3-Spop-dependent manner, and GliR formation
  by Cul1-βTrCP is inhibited, allowing for GliA formation.

    Sufu protects full-length Gli2 and Gli3 (GliFL) from Cul3-Spop-mediated degradation.
    Sufu also promotes the partial degradation of GliFL to GliR by Cul1-βTrCP. (D)
    In the presence of Hh ligands, Ptch1 is internalized and degraded by Smurf1/2.
    An unknown deubiquitinase (DUB) decreases vSmo ubiquitination and degradation.
    Sufu is degraded in a Cul3-Spop-dependent manner, and GliR formation by Cul1-βTrCP
    is inhibited, allowing for GliA formation.
