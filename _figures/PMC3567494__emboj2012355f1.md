caption: Two phosphoinositide cycles regulate aspects of lysosome function. (A) Pathway
  of synthesis and consumption of PI3P, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 from PA via
  PI. The relative abundance of the various lipid species is shown, alongside the
  main enzymes responsible for their synthesis and consumption. (B) Stress responses
  of lysosomes following extracellular or intracellular challenge are regulated in
  part by PI3P and PI(3,5)P2, with the former involved in fusion with other organelles
  and the latter in regulation of ion channels (shown in green). A second phosphoinositide
  cycle dependent on PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 was uncovered in the paper by , which regulates
  traffic from the lysosomes either in the form of vesicles or tubules (shown in blue,
  PI(4)P favouring vesicular intermediates). Recent work by Yu and colleagues has
  also suggested that these lipids regulate lysosome reformation during enhanced flux,
  also thought to proceed via a tubular intermediate favouring PI(4,5)P2 (shown in
  blue).
