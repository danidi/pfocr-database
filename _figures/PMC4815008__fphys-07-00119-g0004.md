caption: Insulin resistance in the fetus from gestational diabetes mellitus. Gestational
  diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a disease coursing with fetal hyperinsulinemia and associated
  with metabolic alterations that result in reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide
  (NO) and altered expression of insulin receptors (IRs). These alterations, and perhaps
  hyperinsulinemia itself, may result in abnormal expression and activity of several
  molecules associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) [IRE-1α, JNK, PERK,
  and likely AMPK (AMPK?)], which could also lead to the activation of the unfolded
  protein response (UPR) pathway. ERS via this set of alterations could result in
  Insulin resistance in the fetus/newborn. Insulin resistance could alternatively
  be caused by Other mechanisms, including membrane transport of L-arginine, the substrate
  for NO synthesis, adenosine receptors (ARs) expression and/or activation, hypoxia
  or high extracellular concentration of D-glucose, and arginases (ARGs) activity,
  a metabolic pathway that consume L-arginine in endothelial cells. All these factors
  could result in increased inhibitor phosphorylation of IRS-1, perhaps involving
  the subtype A of IRs (IR-A) with a deficient signaling pathway mediated by p44/42mapk
  (MAPK) and protein kinase B/Akt. These phenomena lead to reduced synthesis and/or
  bioavailability of NO in the endothelial cells from the human placenta. Since insulin
  signaling is crucial maintaining a normal metabolism of lipids and angiogenesis
  and vasculogenesis in the human placenta from normal pregnancies, GDM-associated
  fetal insulin resistance could result in altered mother-to-fetus transplacental
  transfer due to altered expression and activity of cholesterol transporters, and
  metabolism of lipids leading to accumulation of fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid
  (DHA), or cholesterol. A generalized metabolic disturbance referred as Dyslipidaemia.
  The latter is also associated with increased expression of ERS markers, and could
  also be due to hyperinsulinemia (Hyperinsulinemia ?). Additionally, insulin resistance
  results in a lack of modulation of physiological Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis
  in pregnancy where and increase in vascular growth factors, hyperinsulinemia, IRs
  and ERS molecules, including AMPK activity, are potentially involved. All these
  phenomena, i.e., GDM, ERS, angiogenesis and dyslipidaemia, develop with altered
  expression and activity of common molecules due to the state of insulin resistance
  in the fetoplacental vasculature. The final result is an abnormal function of the
  fetal endothelium (Fetal endothelial dysfunction) that ends with Adverse fetal outcome
  characterized by increased risk of fetal/newborn atherosclerosis, macrosomia, neurological
  disorders, and insulin resistance.
