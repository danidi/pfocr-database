caption: Schematic representation of a glutamatergic synapse indicating major metabolic
  pathways identified in the postsynaptic proteome. Proteomic evidence suggests that
  the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3  as well as the entire glycolytic pathway
  (represented as a yellow circle) would be present at the postsynaptic site. Confirmation
  of this observation with alternative methodological approaches would be required
  to confidently locate the glycolytic pathway within the PSD. Polysomes, for protein
  synthesis, and the proteasome, for protein degradation, are shown to represent the
  enrichment in the PSD of pathways related to protein metabolism. Finally, the traffic
  of AMPA receptors in and out of the postsynaptic membrane is also shown, indicating
  the endocytic zones where clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AMPA receptors occurs
