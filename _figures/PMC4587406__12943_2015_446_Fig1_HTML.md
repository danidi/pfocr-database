caption: Dysregulation of dNTPs in cancer pathogenesis and its targeted therapy. Nucleotides
  are derived from multiple intracellular sources, including products of glycolysis,
  folate cycle, and scavenging of degraded components. The reduction of dihydrofolate
  to active tetrahydrofolate is inhibited by the chemotherapeutic methotrexate. Pyrimidine
  and purine bases are both reduced to deoxynucleosides (dN) by ribonucleotide reductase
  (RNR). This reaction is inhibited by the chemotherapeutic hydroxyurea. Other steps
  in this reaction are inhibited by numerous nucleoside analogs (“antimetabolite”
  compounds) including 5-fluorouracil. These drugs function by limiting the deoxynucleoside
  triphosphate (dNTP) pool available for DNA synthesis and triggering the S-phase
  checkpoint via the action of ATR and Chk1, resulting in cell cycle arrest by inhibiting
  the activation of cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). A potentially critical regulator
  of this pathway is SAMHD1, which hydrolyses dNTPs into products that are then recycled
  or degraded. By this action, SAMHD1 limits dNTP pool in G1 phase and prevents DNA
  replication. With loss of function or repression of SAMHD1 expression, the dNTP
  pool is not reduced which can result in DNA damage and inappropriate cell cycle
  progression. DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PPPs, triphosphate; ATR, ataxia-telangiectasia
