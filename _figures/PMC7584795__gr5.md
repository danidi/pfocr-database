caption: Proposed mechanism on how RBLE could act as a hepatoprotective agent in liver
  injury model·H2O2 is transformed into hydroxyl radical (HO*) through Fenton reaction
  with the presence of transition metal such as iron and copper. Under normal condition,
  H2O2 is neutralized by Glutathione Peroxidase (GPX) enzymes activity through oxidation
  of GSH into GSSG. It seemed that excessive H2O2 lead to down regulation of GPX gene
  expression. Hydroxyl radical activates NFkB that lead to TNF-α production. TNF/TNFR
  engagement induces production of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
  thus increasing extracellular H2O2. Meanwhile, TNF-α also induced JNK signaling
  pathways, resulting in increased mitochondrial ROS and lead to activation of Caspase
  9 and apoptosis executioner, Caspase3. On the other hand, high amount of HO* triggers
  mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), causing mitochondria to swell, and
  suppress ATP production. This pathway lead to unregulated cell death, necrosis;
  increase inflammation; and promote cell death. Lack of ATP also affects apoptosis
  pathway and switch it into necrosis instead. If this condition left untreated, liver
  injury could take place. Treatment with RBLE could neutralized HO* in cells and
  thus lowering necrosis, shifted the cells death pathway to apoptosis which induce
  lower inflammation response instead. Subsequently, RBLE treatment could increase
  the survival of hepatic cells.

  description: Proposed mechanism on how RBLE could act as a hepatoprotective agent
    in liver injury model·H2O2 is transformed into hydroxyl radical (HO*) through

    Under normal condition, H2O2 is neutralized by Glutathione Peroxidase (GPX) enzymes
    activity through oxidation of GSH into GSSG. It seemed that excessive H2O2 lead
    to down regulation of GPX gene expression. Hydroxyl radical activates NFkB that

    TNF-α also induced JNK signaling pathways, resulting in increased mitochondrial
    ROS and lead to activation of Caspase 9 and apoptosis executioner, Caspase3. On
    the other hand, high amount of HO* triggers mitochondrial permeability transition
    (MPT), causing mitochondria to swell, and suppress ATP production. This pathway
    lead to unregulated cell death, necrosis; increase inflammation; and promote cell
    death. Lack of ATP also affects apoptosis pathway and switch it into necrosis
    instead. If this condition left untreated, liver injury could take place. Treatment
    with RBLE could neutralized HO* in cells and thus lowering necrosis, shifted the
