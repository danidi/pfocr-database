caption: Tau phosphorylation procedures and related target site. Deposition of extracellular
  Aβ may lead to activation of GSK3 β pathway and calpain-mediated pathway includes
  generation of P25 from P35 that results in formation of P25 and CDK5 complex. However,
  the complex plays an important role in transforming tau to hyperphosphorylated tau.
  Develop specific GSK3β inhibitor, CD5K inhibitor and MT-stabilizing drugs may attenuate
  the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau that would benefit for AD.
