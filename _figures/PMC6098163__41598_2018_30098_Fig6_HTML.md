caption: Crosstalk between RAAS and FGF-23 pathways. A new schema of hemodynamic regulation
  suggests actions of Ang II to stimulate FGF-23 in bone (afferent limb), leading
  to additive renal effects with Ang II (efferent limb) to increase blood pressure
  and cardiomegaly. In this model, FGF-23 effects are mediated by activation of FGFR/α-Klotho
  complexes, whereas Ang II activates AT1 receptors in renal tubules to enhance sodium
  transport, and to suppress α-Klotho. The resulting positive sodium balance leads
  to increased blood pressure and the reduced levels of soluble Klotho (s-Kl) may
  enhance cardiotoxicity through s-Kl-dependent TRPC6 cardiac effects. In contrast,
  FGF-23 suppresses, whereas Ang II stimulates Ace2, making degradation of Ang II
  and formation of Ang 1–7 a possible point of differential control. FGF-23 also suppresses
  1,25(OH)2D synthesis, an effect predicted to increase renin production by the kidney.
  This novel feed-forward endocrine pathway may contribute to the association between
  elevated FGF-23 and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, Ang II upregulates
  FGF-23 and α-Klotho expression the heart and macrophages to possible reconstitute
  FGFR/α-Klotho signaling leading to paracrine effects of FGF-23 to induce cardiac
  hypertrophy and stimulate inflammation.
