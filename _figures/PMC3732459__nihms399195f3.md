caption: Type I and III IFNs bind to distinct, heterodimeric cell surface receptors,
  but then activate a similar intracellular signaling pathway involving recruitment
  and activation of the Janus kinases, JAK1 and TYK2, phosphorylation of STAT1 and
  STAT2, and the formation of the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex, IFN-stimulated
  gene factor-3 (ISGF3) comprising phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 and IRF9. ISGF3
  migrates into the nucleus and induces the transcription of hundreds of ISGs by binding
  to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in ISG promoters. HCV core and NS5A
  associate with STAT1, suppressing its phosphorylation and/or nuclear translocation.
  Core can also induce SOCS3 expression, which negatively regulates JAK. HCV-induced
  endoplasmic reticulum stress up-regulates expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A),
  which inhibits the transcriptional activity of STAT1 by suppressing protein arginine
  methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), thereby promoting STAT1 hypomethylation and STAT1 association
  with the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1). Up-regulation of ubiquitin-like
  specific protease 18 (USP18) in HCV infection also attenuates JAK-STAT signaling
  at the receptor level through direct binding to IFNAR2.
