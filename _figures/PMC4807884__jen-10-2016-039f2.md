caption: The molecular mechanisms that mediate neurodegeneration in SMA. SMA is characterized
  by degeneration of spinal motor neurons caused by low levels of SMN. SMN deficiency
  results in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the degeneration
  of neurons in SMA. Rho/ROCK pathway is activated in mice with intermediate SMA and
  mediates neurodegeneration by disruption of cytoskeleton stability. Inhibition of
  Rho/ROCK pathway with inhibitors Y-27632 and Fasudil results in the improvement
  of NMJ pathology and SMA phenotype. The JNK signaling pathway is activated in the
  spinal cords of SMA patients and SMAΔ7 mice. Two JNK signaling modules, ASK1/MKK4/JNK3
  and MEKK1/MKK7/JNK3, mediate in vivo phosphorylation of c-Jun that causes the degeneration
  and apoptosis of neurons. Genetic inhibition of the JNK pathway by Jnk3 knockout
  results in the neuroprotection and systemic amelioration of SMA in mice. Black boxes
  with question marks represent upstream targets, which mediate the effects of changes
  stemming from the low levels of SMN that remain to be identified. Solid up arrows
  (red box) show increase in phosphorylation and dotted down arrows (yellow box) show
  decrease in phosphorylation. Dotted line connectors represent possibilities that
  need to be confirmed with further studies.
