caption: The degradation of mRNAs is generally initiated by deadenylation via the
  CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex (as well as some contribution from other deadenylases).
  As seen in the center portion of the diagram, deadenylated mRNAs then generally
  undergo decapping by DCP2 to generate a 5’ monophosphate containing RNA. This decapped
  mRNA is then rapidly and processively degraded by the 5’-3’ exonuclease Xrn1. Xrn1-mediated
  mRNA decay can feedback in some fashion to the nucleus where it helps to buffer
  mRNA synthesis at the level of transcription to maintain cellular homeostasis. As
  seen on the right side of the diagram, deadenylated mRNAs can also be degraded by
  an alternative 3’-5’ exonucleolytic pathway mediated by the Dis3 enzyme associated
  with the RNA exosome or an independent exonuclease called Dis3L2. Finally (left
  side of the diagram), if an mRNA is subjected to endonucleolytic cleavage (e.g.
  by RNAi-mediated decay, RNAse L digestion, etc.), the newly formed and fully accessible
  5’ monophosphate and 3’ OH containing RNA fragments are rapidly degraded by the
  two exonucleolytic pathways as indicated.
