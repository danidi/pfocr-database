caption: A putative pheromone binds to its receptor (STE3) that is coupled to a heterotrimeric
  G-protein designated GPA1 (α-subunit), STE4 (β-subunit), and STE18 (γ-subunit).
  The putative pheromone binding to its receptor leads to G-protein activation and
  the dissociation of STE4 and STE18 from Gpa1. The released complex (STE4/STE18)
  activates STE20 that stimulates the MAPK module MKKK STE11, MKK STE7 and MAPK FUS3.
  The activated form of FUS3 may be translocated to the nucleus, where it activates
  STE12. STE12 induces putative transcriptional factors of the Pheromone Response
  Element that activates the SexM or SexP gene. Activation of STE 11 could also be
  achieved by an independent putative mechanism involving STE50 through the activation
  of STE20.
