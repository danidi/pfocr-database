caption: Proposed pathway of synthesis of phenazines (AB1, AB2a, AB2b, and AB3) as
  a result of LAC-mediated heteromolecular coupling reactions of aminomethoxycarboxylic
  acid (A) with three different isomers of aminonaphthalene (B1, B2, and B3). Acronyms
  of substrates and products have been bolded.
