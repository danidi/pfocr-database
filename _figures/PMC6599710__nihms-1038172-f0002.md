caption: 'HLA genes HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C encode the MHC class I proteins that present
  intracellular peptides on the cell surface to T cell receptors (TCRs) and require
  B2M for stabilization on the cell surface. IFN-γ, which can be released by activated
  T cells, binds IFNGR1/2 on tumors, which triggers JAK-STAT signaling that activates
  IFN response genes, including IRF1, which induces the transcription of other genes
  to increase the surface expression of PD-L1 and MHC molecules. Genomic mechanisms
  of checkpoint blockade response include upregulation of IFN-γ response gene expression,,
  loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), and germline HLA
  heterozygosity. Conversely, genomic pathways of resistance include B2M loss,–, somatic
  HLA loss of heterozygosity, reduced HLA gene expression, increased expression of
  MEX3B, IFNGR1/2 or IRF1copy-number loss, JAK1/2 inactivation,,, APLNR (apelin receptor)
  loss, and amplification of negative regulators of the IFN-γ pathway, including SOCS1
  (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1) and PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT4).
