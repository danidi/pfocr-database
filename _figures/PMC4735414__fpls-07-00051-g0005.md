caption: Schematic representation of primary metabolism of poplar roots at different
  forms of nitrogen. Gray charts represent significantly differentially expressed
  genes in the metabolic pathways. White charts represent the genes without significantly
  different expression in the metabolic pathways. The left and right columns represent
  the S1/S2 and S3/S2 at the transcriptional level, respectively. Up- and down-facing
  triangles represent an increase and decrease in transcripts. The digital in columns
  represent the number of change genes. It can be found that there was no significantly
  difference gene in nitrogen metabolic pathway.
