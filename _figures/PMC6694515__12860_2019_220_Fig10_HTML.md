caption: A model to describe the responses of the PINK1:Parkin pathway to mitochondrial
  stresses of differing magnitude and duration. a Model representing the changes in
  PINK1, Parkin, and phospho-ubiquitin chain levels at the mitochondria with changing
  ΔΨm. (1) In polarized, actively respiring mitochondria, PINK1 is rapidly imported,
  proteolytically cleaved, and degraded. (2) Phospho-ubiquitin chains are removed
  by mitochondria-associated USPs (and possibly phosphatases) in depolarized and repolarized
  mitochondria but the kinetics of this process are slow. (3) In partially depolarized
  mitochondria, small fluctuations in ΔΨm may generate short pulses of PINK1 activity.
  If these occur sufficiently frequently, ppUb chain density at the OMM may either
  be maintained or build due to their slow removal by USPs. b Diagrammatic representation
  of PINK1:Parkin pathway feedback loops. Parkin activation FFL – PINK1 activates
  Parkin directly through phosphorylation of the Parkin Ubl at Ser65 and indirectly
  by phosphorylating ubiquitin proteins at Ser65, which relieve autoinhibition of
  Parkin protein, constituting a coherent FFL. Phospho-polyubiquitin FFL - PINK1 activates
  Parkin directly through phosphorylation of the Parkin Ubl at Ser65, enabling Parkin
  to poly-ubiquitinate proteins on the OMM and these chains are phosphorylated by
  PINK1, forming a second coherent FFL. Parkin recruitment positive feedback loop
  – The ppUb chains produced by PINK1 and Parkin activity at the OMM serve as docking
  sites for the recruitment and activation of more Parkin. c Graphs to represent predicted
  changes in OMM-associated PINK1 (blue) and Parkin (green) levels in response to
  the indicated changes in ΔΨm (red)
