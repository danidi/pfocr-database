caption: 'Schematic representation of Ser biosynthesis in plants. The enzymes participating
  in each Ser biosynthetic pathway are listed separately. Photorespiratory pathway
  (glycolate pathway): GDC, Gly decarboxylase; SHMT, Ser hydroxymethyltransferase.
  Glycerate pathway: PGAP, 3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase; GDH, glycerate dehydrogenase;
  AH-AT, Ala-hydroxypyruvate aminotransferase. Phosphorylated pathway: PSAT, 3-phosphoserine
  aminotransferase; PSP, 3-phosphoserine phosphatase. Abbreviations used for metabolites
  are as follows: 3-PHP, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate; 3-PS, 3-phosphoserine; THF, tetrahydrofolate;
  5,10-CH2-THF, 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate. This figure is adapted from .'
