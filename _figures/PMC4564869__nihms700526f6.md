caption: The phosphoproteins identified in our study were annotated in the DNA damage
  response pathway constructed through manual literature curation and DAVID bioinformatics
  resource. The legends are included in the inset. The data show that phosphoproteins
  involved in DNA damage response pathways are also upregulated by deletion of OGT.
