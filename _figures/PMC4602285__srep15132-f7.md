caption: Positive feedback was noted between miR-19b and TNF-α. miR-19b was significantly
  downregulated following 24 h of TNF-α treatment. The down-regulation of miR-19b
  alleviated its inhibition of TNF, which is the target gene of miR-19b, resulting
  in increased TNF-α expression. miR-19b plays a significant role in the attenuation
  of TNF-α-induced HUVEC apoptosis via the Apaf1/caspase pathway, which functions
  independently of apoptosis.
