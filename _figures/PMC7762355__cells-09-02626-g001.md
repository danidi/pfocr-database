caption: The inflammatory regulation mechanism in a TREM1/2-TLR4-dependent manner
  in the liver. Upon the stimulation LPS, TLR4 is activated and produces cytokines
  via NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. TREM1 phosphorylates ITAM by activating Src
  and Syk kinases and regulates CARD9. The upstream signal passed to CARD9 augments
  inflammation via NF-κB and MAPK. The IRAK1 and TRAF6 in TLR4 signaling pathway also
  promote inflammation via CARD9 and NF-κB, respectively. TREM2 mainly alleviates
  the inflammation by binding to DAP12 with low affinity. Partial activation of DAP12
  reduces the phosphorylation Src and Syk kinases, inhibiting the inflammatory factor
  mediated by ERK/p38-MAPK/JNK pathway. TREM2 also makes A20 negatively regulate ubiquitination
  of TRAF6 and decreases inflammation mediated by NF-κB. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  TREM2, triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2; DAP12, DNAX-activation
  protein of 12 kDa; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; MD2, myeloid differential protein-2;
  IRAK, IL-1 receptor associated kinase; TRAF6, TNF receptor associated factor 6;
  ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; Syk, spleen tyrosine kinase;
  CARD9, cytosolic adaptor caspase recruitment domain family member 9; MyD88, myeloid
  differentiation factor 88; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway; ERK,
  extracellular regulated protein kinases pathway; P, phosphorylation; U, ubiquitination.
