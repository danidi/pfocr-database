caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway for TNL A (1) supported by the isolation of
  congeners or shunt metabolites 4–11, as indicated by the dashed arrows. A) The four
  core proteins, TnlT1–T4, construct the diterpenoid scaffold and elongate the side
  chain. Then, a series of oxidative reactions form the γ-butyrolactone moiety and
  hydroxylate the C-18 and C-12 positions before acylation of the chloroanthranilate
  moiety. Finally, the N- and O-methylations, catalyzed by TnlP5 and TnlM1, respectively,
  complete the biosynthesis, although their timing is still unknown. IPP: isopentenyl
  diphosphate, DMAPP: dimethylallyl diphosphate, GGPP: geranylgeranyl diphosphate.
  B) Biosynthesis of the chloroanthranilate moiety from l-tryptophan follows that
  of tryptophan degradation through the kynurenine pathway. Chemical transformations
  are colored red; for multiple transformations in one step, red and blue are used.'
