caption: a Direct and indirect intracellular effects of CCN proteins in chronic myeloid
  leukemia (CML). CCN1 expression is increased in CML cells, inhibiting apoptosis
  through enhanced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 via the NF-κB pathway,
  without involvement of AKT or ERK1/2. CCN3 expression is decreased in CML cells,
  decreasing its inhibitory effect of CCN3 on ERK and AKT phosphorylation, resulting
  in elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK and AKT. This leads to less apoptosis,
  presumably via the NF-κB pathway. In addition, decreased CCN3 levels result in less
  caspase 3 cleavage, thereby also reducing apoptosis. Furthermore, decreased CCN3
  levels lead to less inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling, resulting in higher levels of
  NOTCH. This results in decreased expression of p27, disrupting cell cycle regulation.
  b Direct and indirect intracellular effects of CCN proteins in acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL). The effects have been demonstrated for CCN1 in B- and T-ALL, for
  CCN2 in B-ALL and for CCN4 in T-ALL cells. In these cells, CCN1, CCN2 as well as
  CCN4 expression is increased, all inhibiting apoptosis through enhanced expression
  of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. Both CCN1 and CCN2 activate AKT, whereas CCN4
  activates AKT as well as ERK1/2. Involvement of the NF-κB pathway has been demonstrated
  for CCN1 and CCN4. In addition, increased CCN2 and CCN4 levels lead to decreased
  expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and BAX, respectively, both resulting
  in less apoptosis. Furthermore, increased CCN2 levels are associated with decreased
  p27 expression, thereby affecting cell cycle regulation
