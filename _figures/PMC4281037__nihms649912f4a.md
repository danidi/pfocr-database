caption: Despite the similarity between IL-17R and TLR/IL-1Rs, studies of IL-17 have
  revealed several differences in how IL-17R operates. For example, ACT1 is not a
  positive activator of signaling in any system outside the IL-17R family. ACT1 serves
  both as a signaling adaptor, to recruit tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated
  factor (TRAF) proteins to direct activation of several downstream signaling cascades,
  and as an E3 ligase to mediate ubiquitination of TRAF6. Recruitment and ubiquitination
  of TRAF6 leads to activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway and the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which include extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK), p38 and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK). Consequently, activation of these pathways
  by IL-17 is impaired in the absence of either ACT1 or TRAF6, , . Alternatively,
  ACT1 can recruit TRAF2 and TRAF5, which promote activation of an mRNA stability
  pathway via the SF2/ASF or HuR complexes, . Regulation of these alternative pathways
  occurs via inducible ACT1 phosphorylation, which is mediated by Ikki (Ikkε) and
  TBK1 (), . ACT1 function and stability is in turn regulated by the chaperone protein
  hsp90. Inhibition of hsp90 results in proteasomal degradation of ACT1, which in
  turn leads to defective IL-17 signaling. ACT1 appears to be required for most IL-17-dependent
  signaling events and the majority of phenotypes Act1−/− mice are similar to Il17ra−/−
  mice. Notably, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ACT1 has been associated
  with psoriasis. Thus, in the IL-17R family all known signaling emanates from ACT1,
  which leads to an activation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades.
