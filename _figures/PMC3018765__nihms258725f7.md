caption: TWEAK-dependent Fn14 signalling is likely to be the predominant mechanism
  inducing pathological effects in humans. This pathway could be blocked using various
  protein- or small molecule-based TWEAK- or Fn14-targeted drugs that prevent TWEAK
  binding to Fn14. Indeed, the first two therapeutic strategies listed under TWEAK-dependent
  Fn14 signalling have shown efficacy in several rodent models of human disease. Alternatively,
  one could use membrane-permeable drugs that prevent Fn14–TRAF (TNFR-associated factor)
  association or inhibit downstream signalling events, but in this case it may prove
  more difficult to achieve TWEAK–Fn14 axis specificity. It is also possible that
  in tissues where the Fn14 receptor is overexpressed and TWEAK levels are low, TWEAK-independent
  Fn14 signalling could contribute to certain disease pathologies. This pathway could
  be inhibited using an anti-Fn14 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks receptor multimerization
  or disassociates preformed multimers. Alternatively, Fn14-targeted toxins delivered
  as fusion proteins or chemical conjugates could be used to kill Fn14-overexpressing
  cells. One could also target Fn14–TRAF association or downstream signalling events
  as mentioned in the main text.
