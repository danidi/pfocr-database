caption: Anthranilate and PQS synthesis in P. aeruginosa. In P. aeruginosa, anthranilate
  is made via three separate enzymatic pathways. The kynurenine pathway degrades tryptophan
  into anthranilate via the KynABU enzymatic pathway, while anthranilate is synthesized
  from chorismate by two separate anthranilate synthases, PhnAB and TrpEG. Anthranilate
  can be used as a precursor for many compounds, including tryptophan and 4-quinolones.
