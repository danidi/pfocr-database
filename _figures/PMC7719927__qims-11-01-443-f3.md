caption: The MAPKs signaling pathway is affected by LIPUS through AT1 and caveolin-1
  to mediate inflammation. The phosphorylation of ERK is induced by LIUPS through
  AT 1, and this increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, the
  activation of caveolin-1 induced by LIPUS can suppress the expression of inflammatory
  kinases through MAPKs. LIPUS, low intensity pulsed ultrasound; AT 1, angiotensin
  type 1; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK ½, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase.
