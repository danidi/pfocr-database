caption: Wnts bind to their frizzled receptors (FZ) and coreceptors LRP in the membrane.
  This binding can be blocked by dickkopf (Dkk) or soluble frizzled related proteins
  (sFRP). Activation of FZ by wnt results in phosphorylation of disheveled (Dvl) which
  induces the disruption of the axin/APC/GSK-3b complex and recruitment of axin to
  the membrane. This complex, when active, phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its
  proteosomal degradation. However, following wnt stimulation, β-catenin is no longer
  degraded and can enter the nucleus where in combination with members of the LEF/TCF
  family can induce expression of its target genes such as cyclin D1. β-catenin also
  binds to the E-cadherin complex in the plasma membrane, a complex stabilized by
  calcium, where it may play a role in differentiation.
