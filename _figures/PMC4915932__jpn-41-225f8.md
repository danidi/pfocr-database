caption: Diagram summarizing the progranulin (PGRN) deficiency-related nuclear factor
  (NF)-κB activation and WNT5A expression; PGRN deficiency favours tumour necrosis
  factor (TNF)-α/NF-κB signalling that results in the increase of WNT5A expression
  and signalling. The WNT5A-induced stimulation of CDK6 activity is responsible for
  the enhanced proliferation of PGRN-deficient lymphoblasts and amplifies the NF-κB-mediated
  activation of WNT5A transcription through the p65 NF-κB subunit phosphorylation.
