caption: A schematic drawing illustrating that the occludin/ZO-1/FAK is a regulatory
  protein complex that mediates CdCl2-induced BTB disruption, which is likely used
  by the testis to restructure BTB at stages VIII–IX of the epithelial cycle to facilitate
  the passage of primary leptotene spermatocytes. Top panel, The BTB “closed” wherein
  the occludin/ZO-1/FAK protein complexes between apposing Sertoli cells at the site
  they interact with each other to confer the TJ barrier. Middle panel, After treatment
  of Sertoli cells with CdCl2, FAK alters the phosphorylation status of occludin (and/or
  ZO-1), causing the mislocalization of the complex from the cell-cell interface,
  likely via a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway, perhaps targeted to endosome-mediated
  intracellular degradation, destabilizing the BTB; thereby the BTB “opened” as shown
  in the lower panel. CdCl2 also induced disruption of actin filaments as reported
  herein.
