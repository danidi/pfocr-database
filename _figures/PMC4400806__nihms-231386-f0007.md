caption: (A) In response to ribosomal stress several ribosomal proteins, including
  L11 and L5, bind Mdm2 and inhibit its E3 ligase function, leading to stabilization
  and activation of p53.(B) Oncogenic c-Myc induces high expression of both p19Arf
  and ribosomal proteins. The RP-Mdm2-p53 and p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 represent two parallel
  signaling pathways in response to oncogenic c-Myc stimulation.
