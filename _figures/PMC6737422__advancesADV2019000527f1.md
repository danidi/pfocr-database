caption: Schematic of SCD-associated oxidative stress pathways and antioxidant systems.
  In the intravascular space, sickled RBCs undergo hemolysis, releasing hemoglobin
  (Hb) and heme. Hemoglobin reacts with (1) NO·, forming nitrate (NO3−), and (2) hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2), producing hydroxyl radical (−OH). Endothelial-bound xanthine oxidase
  (XO) generates superoxide (O2·−) and H2O2. Free heme binds to Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) producing reactive species through the activation of the NFκB pathway.
  SOD3 is found in the extracellular compartment and converts O2·− to H2O2. In the
  endothelial cell (EC) cytoplasm, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and NADPH
  oxidase 2 (Nox2), Nox4, and Nox5 produce O2·−, which is dismutated by SOD1. eNOS
  normally generates NO·, which is capable of reacting with O2·− to form peroxynitrite
  (ONOO−). In the mitochondrial matrix, electrons leaked from complexes I and III
  of the respiratory chain react with oxygen (O2), forming O2·−. SOD2 dismutates O2·−
  to H2O2, which is further broken down to water by catalase (CAT). SOD2 expression
  and activity is maintained at a precise balance. Overexpression of SOD2 decreases
  O2·− levels and increases H2O2 levels, which are then free to oxidize protein thiols.
  SOD2 underexpression or dysfunction increases O2·− levels, increasing nitration
  and oxidation of iron sulfur clusters and decreasing metabolism and adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) production.
