caption: CD163 in atherosclerosis. (A) Hb may be scavenged by CD163. Once released
  from erythrocytes, Hb binds to Hp to form complexes, resulting in exposure of a
  neo-epitope that is able to combine with CD163. Once this receptor-ligand complex
  is delivered to early endosomes through endocytosis, CD163 enters an alternative
  pathway by dissociating and is recycled to cell membrane, whereas Hb-Hp continues
  its metabolism within the lysosomes. Regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme, HO-1,
  Hb-Hp metabolism produces anti-inflammatory molecules, including biliverdin, Fe2+
  and CO. Conversely, HO-1 and CD163 production may be upregulated by IL-10, whose
  production is triggered by Hb-Hp-CD163 binding through activating the intracellular
  signaling pathway. (B) CD163-expressing macrophages recognize and internalize TWEAK,
  resulting in a decrease of sTWEAK. TWEAK, tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer
  of apoptosis; sTWEAK, soluble TWEAK; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; CD163, cluster of differentiation
  163; Hb, hemoglobin; Hp, haptoglobin; IL, interleukin; CO, carbon monoxide; Fe2+,
  Iron2+.
