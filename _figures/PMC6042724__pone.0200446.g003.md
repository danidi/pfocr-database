caption: Functional interaction networks obtained from human gene list (A) showing
  MRVI1 interaction with ITPR1, and from murine gene list (B) highlighting MRVI1 interaction
  with Prkg1. (C) MRVI1, ITPR1 and PRKG1 are indirectly associated with GUCY1A3 and
  NF1, as well as with other members of Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Colored lines
  indicate known interactions from curated databases (blue), experimentally determined
  interactions (magenta) and text mining (green). All genes not showing interactions
  were omitted.
