caption: 'Pathways for the penetration of CNTs into the cell. (a) Nonreceptor mediated
  endocytosis: (1) membrane that surrounds the drug loaded functionalized CNTs, (2)
  internalization of drug loaded CNTs, and (3) release of drug; (b) receptor mediated
  endocytosis: (4) membrane surrounds the CNT-receptor conjugate by forming endosomes
  followed by internalization, (5) release of drug, and (6, 7, 8) regeneration of
  receptor; (c) endocytosis independent pathway: (9) direct penetration of drug loaded
  functionalized CNT and (10) release of the drug.'
