caption: SMC contraction is modulated by two manners that are both involve Ca2+. One
  is through action potential induced by chemical signals or stretch stimuli, which
  promotes extracellular Ca2+ influx into intracellular cytosol. Most cytosolic Ca2+
  comes from extracellular sources, but a small part is released by the RYR. Another
  is G-protein coupled receptor-PLC-IP3 pathway triggered by chemical signals, which
  then activates IP3R in the SR membrane to release Ca2+ into the cytosol. The elevated
  level of Ca2+ combines with CaM to form Ca2+-CaM compounds, which then combine with
  and activate cytoplasmic myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). The activation of MLCK
  promotes the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) for SMC contraction.
