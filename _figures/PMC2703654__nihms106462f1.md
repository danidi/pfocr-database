caption: Dicer-like proteins (DCLs) are represented in association with known and
  unknown cognate double-stranded (ds)RNA-binding proteins (DRBs). Note the indirect
  implication of DCL1 in viRNA biogenesis from DNA viruses (e.g., Cauliflower mosaic
  virus) and the putative contribution of DCL3-dependent viRNAs to viral DNA/histone
  methylation. DCL4 is the primary Dicer to detect RNA viruses and is replaced by
  DCL2 if suppressed (for example by the VSR P38; see also ). AGO1 is presented as
  a major antiviral slicer, but other AGO paralogs are likely to be involved, potentially
  also mediating translational repression. All viRNAs are stabilized through HEN1-dependent
  2′-O-methylation. The figure shows how primary viRNAs (1st) are amplified into secondary
  viRNAs (2nd) in the RDR6-dependent pathway. A similar scheme is anticipated with
  the salicylic acid-induced RDR1 (not shown; ). Aberrant (ab) viral mRNAs lacking
  a cap or polyA tail (AAA) can enter RNA-dependent RNA polymerase pathways independently
  of 1st viRNA synthesis. A DCL4-dependent silencing signal (arbitrarily depicted
  as free 21 nucleotide viRNAs) moves through the plasmodesmata (P) to immunize neighboring
  cells. Movement may be enhanced through further rounds of amplification involving
  viral transcripts that enter immunized cells. VSRs and potential endogenous silencing
  suppressors (red) represent genetic rather than direct physical interactions with
  host silencing components.
