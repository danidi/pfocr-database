caption: 'Model showing role of O-GlcNAc modification in maintenance of stemness:
  In a stem cell niche, whether embryonic or within a tumor, low oxygen tension results
  in increased hypoxia and hypoxia mediated signaling. This leads to in increased
  glucose uptake and glycolysis. Some of the glucose is shunted through the hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway leading to production of UDP-GlcNAc, a substrate for O-GlcNAc
  transferase (OGT). Increased OGT activity affects transcriptional activity of Sox2,
  Oct4 and FoX-O proteins to maintain genomic stability, thereby maintaining self-renewal.
  Increased OGT activity also prevents differentiation to specific tissue types, further
  contributing to maintenance of stemness'
