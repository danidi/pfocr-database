caption: Summary diagram. Cartoon illustration of the pathways examined in this study.
  In the context of primary murine dermal fibroblasts, TGF-β/TGFβR-mediated signaling
  positively regulates α-SMA expression via p38MAPK instead of via Smad2/3 or ERK1/2.
  CD44 negatively regulates α-SMA expression by inhibiting actin polymerization, leading
  to more globular G-actin in the cytoplasm which binds and sequesters MRTF, preventing
  MRTF from entering the nucleus and binding to SRF. Activation of p38MAPK is required
  for up-regulation of α-SMA expression caused by either TGFβR signaling or knockdown
  of CD44.
