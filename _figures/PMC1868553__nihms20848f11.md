caption: Fab1 acts in concert with its activators Vac7 and Vac14 at vacuolar/endosomal
  membranes, where it converts PtdIns[]P generated by Vps34 to PtdIns[,]P2. This process
  is temporarily upregulated during conditions of hyperosmotic stress, in a manner
  that also requires the PtdIns[,]P2-specific phosphatase . The downstream effectors
  of PtdIns[,]P2 include Ent3 and Ent5, as well as Atg18 and function in the regulation
  of vacuole acidification, the MVB pathway and vacuole to MVB membrane retrieval.
