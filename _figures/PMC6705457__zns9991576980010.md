caption: A working model depicting the mechanism by which OSM confers neuroprotection
  against ischemic stroke. Under normal conditions, OSM binds to OSMRβ at the cell
  surface, which sustains JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway activation and, subsequently,
  neuronal survival. In response to I/R injury, however, the OSMRβ expression levels
  in neurons are reduced, leading to suppression of the JAK2/STAT3 prosurvival signaling
  pathway.
