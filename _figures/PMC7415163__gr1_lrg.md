caption: The complement activation pathways and narsoplimab mechanism of action. Narsoplimab,
  by blocking MASP-2, inhibits activation of the lectin pathway (LP). Part of the
  innate immune system, the LP is activated by microorganisms or injured cells. Microorganisms
  display carbohydrate-based pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and injured
  host cells display damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) on their surfaces.
  DAMPs are not displayed on healthy cells but become exposed with cell injury. Lectins,
  carrying MASP-2, bind to the PAMPs or DAMPs, localizing lectin pathway activation
  to the vicinity of the cell surface. Activated MASP-2 cleaves complement factor
  2 (C2) and C4, initiating a series of enzymatic steps that result in the production
  of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a and formation of C5b-9 (the membrane attack complex),
  and can also directly cleave C3 through the C4-bypass mechanism. The alternative
  pathway acts as an amplification loop, further enhancing lectin pathway-mediated
  complement activation. Unlike C3 or C5 inhibition, MASP-2 inhibition does not interfere
  with the classical pathway, preserving the adaptive immune response and the antigen-antibody
  complex-mediated lytic response needed to fight infection.MASP-2 also acts directly
  on the coagulation cascade and the contact system, cleaving prothrombin to thrombin
  and forming fibrin clots. Narsoplimab not only inhibits lectin pathway activation
  but also blocks microvascular injury-associated thrombus formation as well as MASP-2-mediated
  activation of kallikrein and factor XII.

  description: The complement activation pathways and narsoplimab mechanism of action.
    Narsoplimab, by blocking MASP-2, inhibits activation of the lectin pathway (LP).
    Part of the innate immune system, the LP is activated by microorganisms or injured
    cells. Microorganisms display carbohydrate-based pathogen-associated molecular
    patterns (PAMPs) and injured host cells display damage-associated molecular patterns
    (DAMPs) on their surfaces. DAMPs are not displayed on healthy cells but become
    exposed with cell injury. Lectins, carrying MASP-2, bind to the PAMPs or DAMPs,
    localizing lectin pathway activation to the vicinity of the cell surface. Activated
    MASP-2 cleaves complement factor 2 (C2) and C4, initiating a series of enzymatic
    steps that result in the production of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a and formation
    of C5b-9 (the membrane attack complex), and can also directly cleave C3 through
    the C4-bypass mechanism. The alternative pathway acts as an amplification loop,
    further enhancing lectin pathway-mediated complement activation. Unlike C3 or
