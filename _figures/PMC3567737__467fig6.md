caption: Model showing the role of mitochondrial function in the regulation of cAMP-PKA
  signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers downregulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway
  in Σ1278b cells. This leads to a defective filamentous response despite the wild-type
  level activity of the RTG and FG MAPK pathways. Downregulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway
  results in modulation of several cellular processes in addition to filamentation
  in respiratory-deficient mutants. Activation is shown by arrows and inhibition by
  T-bars.
