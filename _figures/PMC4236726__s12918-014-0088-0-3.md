caption: 'Redundant paths between the crosstalk of MAPK and focal adhesion pathways.
  (A) The sub-network of pathways that engage in crosstalk with either the MAPK pathway
  or the Focal Adhesion pathway are shown in yellow. Among them, pathways that are
  targeted by the drug sorafenib are red, pathways with the highest node degree (the
  first 8 hubs, see list in Figure A) are blue, and the immune system pathways (with
  highest node degree, see list in Figure A) are green. The 63 redundant 3-node circles
  included in this crosstalk highlight the complexity of targeting this crosstalk
  with an indirect approach, but on the other hand indicate its importance due to
  the many regulators, among them being the hubs, the immune system, and pathways
  targeted by sorafenib. (B) The redundant 3-node circles can be grouped based on
  their pathway categories (category shown in magenta), so a more compact meaningful
  representation of those circles can be written: instead of 63 pathway circles, we
  have 23 category circles. For example, 9 of the 3-node circles are from the Infectious
  Diseases category, and 6 others are from the Immune System category. (C) All pathway
  categories with degree above 1.'
