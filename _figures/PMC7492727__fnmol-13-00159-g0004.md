caption: Proposed pathological mechanisms of MuSK autoantibodies at the NMJ. (A) In
  MuSK-MG, autoantibodies of the IgG4 subclass bind to the ectodomain of MuSK preventing
  its interaction with LRP4 and therefore block down-stream signaling. The phosphorylation
  cascade is therefore inhibited causing the ultimate dispersal of AChR clusters.
  Loss of retrograde signaling mediated by LRP4 may also explain the absence of presynaptic
  adaptive increase of ACh vesicles observed in MuSK-MG animal models which are otherwise
  characteristic in AChR-MG. (B) Block of ColQ-MuSK binding by MuSK autoantibodies
  has been proposed to be a pathogenic mechanism that may lead to a loss of AChE from
  the ECM at the NMJ. (C) Divalent binding of commercial or cloned (monospecific)
  MuSK antibodies has been proposed to cause MuSK dimerization and activation, leading
  to ectopic, extra-synaptic AChR clusters. These would not participate in neuromuscular
  transmission as they would lack adjacent motoneuron terminals. For the formation
  of ectopic AChR clusters, AChR may also be recruited from synapses thus depleting
  the NMJ from AChR. (D) In vivo MuSK antibodies (IgG1–3) may recruit C1q and activate
  the classical complement pathway, causing complement-mediated damage at the NMJ.
  (E) MuSK antibodies could also cross-link MuSK and lead to increased internalization
  of MuSK, thus effectively depleting MuSK from the muscle membrane and cause a loss
  of agrin-LRP4-MuSK-DOK7 signal transduction.

  description: Proposed pathological mechanisms of MuSK autoantibodies at the NMJ.
    (A) In MuSK-MG, autoantibodies of the IgG4 subclass bind to the ectodomain of
    MuSK preventing its interaction with LRP4 and therefore block down-stream signaling.
    The phosphorylation cascade is therefore inhibited causing the ultimate dispersal

    the absence of presynaptic adaptive increase of ACh vesicles observed in MuSK-MG
    animal models which are otherwise characteristic in AChR-MG. (B) Block of ColQ-MuSK
    binding by MuSK autoantibodies has been proposed to be a pathogenic mechanism
