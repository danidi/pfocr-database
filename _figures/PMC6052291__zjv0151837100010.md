caption: Model depicting viral suppression by PERK-eIF2α pathway activation during
  TGEV infection. TGEV infection induces ER stress by activating all three UPR signaling
  pathways (ATF6, IRE1, and PERK). Phosphorylation of eIF2α by PERK activation attenuates
  global protein synthesis, which decreases the levels of cytoplasm IκBα and leads
  to reduced inhibition of IκBα on NF-κB, promoting IFN-α/β production. The stalled
  translation and IFN-α/β production negatively regulate TGEV replication. The arrows
  indicate activation, and the blunt-ended lines indicate inhibition.
