caption: 'The Hpo kinase cascade consists of four core proteins: Hpo, Sav, Wts, and
  Mats. Sav binds and regulates Hpo. Hpo phosphorylates and activates Wts. Hpo also
  phosphorylates Mats to enhance its ability to activate Wts. Wts phosphorylates Yki
  and restricts its nuclear localization. Yki forms a complex with Sd to activate
  Hpo target genes. Ex and Mer act in a partially redundant manner to regulate the
  Hpo kinase cascade. Fat is a candidate receptor and may regulate the Hpo pathway
  through Dachs and Ex. Ds is a candidate ligand for Fat. Fj modulates Ds/Fat interaction
  through phosphorylating Ds and Fat in the Golgi.'
