caption: Cross talk between induction of mitochondrial oxidative/nitrosative stress
  and autophagy. Oxidative insults, starvation, oxygen deprivation, and genotoxic
  stress inducers, among others, activate different upstream signaling pathways and
  signaling effectors such as DEPP, KAT5/c-PLA2, and the redox-sensitive kinase p66Shc
  that converge on mitochondria and trigger ROS and RNS production. Downstream signaling
  of mitochondrial stress-mediated autophagy induction occurs at different steps of
  the autophagy pathway. Transcriptional upregulation of Sqstm1, Becn1, and some Atg
  genes has been reported via oxidative stress-mediated phosphorylation of NF-κB and
  the induction of p38 MAPK and JNK. Autophagy induction has also been described by
  mTORC1 inhibition after ROS/RNS-mediated activation of ATM-AMPK, MAPK, and JNK1
  pathways. Under ROS/RNS accumulation, HMGB1 and JNK1 promote the disruption of the
  inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 in BECN1, facilitating BECN1 translocation to mitochondria.
  BECN1 translocation and PI3KC3 complex assembly are also triggered by H2O2-mediated
  phosphorylation of caveolin 1 (Cav1). Mitochondrial ROS-mediated activation of the
  lysosomal Ca2+ channel mucolipin-1 triggers a Ca2+-mediated signaling pathway that
  upregulates some Atg and lysosomal genes. Mitochondrial H2O2 promotes autophagosome
  synthesis by a transient oxidative inhibition of ATG4 activity (as described in
  detail in ). Meanwhile, under certain conditions, mitochondrial stress has likewise
  been reported as an autophagy suppressor. ROS and RSN, as autophagy inhibitor mediators,
  have been associated to the S-nitrosylation of JNK1 and Bcl-2, the aggregation of
  the mitochondrial membrane protein C19orf12 in cytosol, and the activation of the
  Ca2+ channel regulatory protein MID1.
