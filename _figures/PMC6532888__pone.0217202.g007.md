caption: Without Penicillium digitatum infection, fengycin induced the expression
  of key genes in ethylene (ET) signaling pathway. Iturin A could induce the ET key
  gene and chitinase (CHI) gene (jasmonic acid, JA/ET responsive gene) and the proteins;
  auxin-responsive protein IAA16-like and NAC domain-containing protein 21/22-like
  functioning in auxin signaling pathway. Surfactin also elicited the expression of
  CHI gene and a protein involves in auxin signaling pathway resulting in activation
  of induced systemic resistance (ISR) for plant resistance. In P. digitatum infected
  treatments, fengycin and surfactin showed ability to trigger CHI gene and lipoxygenase
  (LOX) genes, respectively. While iturin A stimulated the expression of ET key genes
  and CHI genes. Moreover, iturin A could attached to 12-oxophytodienoate reductase
  2 which is involved in the oxylipin biosynthetic process resulting in ISR activation
  via JA signaling pathway for plant resistance. (Arrows in green, responding to fengycin
  treatment; orange, responding to iturin A treatment; blue, responding to surfactin
  treatment; black, activating ISR pathway and plant defense).
