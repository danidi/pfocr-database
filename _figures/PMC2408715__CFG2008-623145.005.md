caption: Peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The pathway for the synthesis of peptidoglycan
  from UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is complete. Even though the D-amino acids such
  as D-glutamate and D-alanine are not likely to be synthesized by O. tsutsugamushi,
  the genes for incorporating them into glycan are present.
