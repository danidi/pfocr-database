caption: 'Mechanisms whereby brown and beige adipocytes take up and utilize glucose
  to influence whole body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. BAT and beige
  adipocytes are extremely active in taking up glucose, which may contribute significantly
  to systemic glucose disposal, at least during cold exposure. Left, insulin signaling
  to GLUT4: Insulin signaling through Akt to stimulate GLUT4 translocation to the
  plasma membrane operates as in WAT and BAT, but appears to contribute less to overall
  glucose uptake in BAT. Obesity does attenuate this pathway in BAT as it does in
  WAT. Middle, norepinephrine (NE) signaling to GLUT1: Upon stimulation of sympathetic
  innervation in BAT or WAT, brown and beige adipocytes activate a novel mTORC2-dependent
  pathway to cause GLUT1 trafficking to the plasma membrane. This significantly stimulates
  glucose uptake while also activating lipolysis and lipoprotein-based triglyceride
  hydrolysis to provide fatty acid substrates for uncoupled respiration through UCP1
  upregulation. Surprisingly, the mTORC1 complex was found to mediate the expression
  of UCP1. Right, glucose uptake for oxidation: Glucose uptake in BAT and beige adipocytes
  is both oxidized and converted to fatty acids by upregulated de novo lipogenesis
  enzymes during NE stimulation. The newly synthesized fatty acids are thought to
  be rapidly oxidized in chronic uncoupled respiration. The effects of obesity on
  GLUT1 translocation and glucose utilization in BAT are less well studied, but the
  limited data available indicate diminished glucose uptake in BAT in obesity. A key
  unanswered question is the degree to which altered brown and beige adipocyte metabolites
  affect the secretion of both beneficial and deleterious batokines that regulate
  systemic metabolism and the effects of obesity on such regulation.'
