caption: Changes in redox potentials and cellular function. A, the steady-state cytoplasmic
  redox potentials for the three major thiol-based buffers in differentiated cells
  are shown inside the box, whereas the extracellular redox potentials for the GSH/GSSG
  and cysteine/cystine redox couple are shown outside. Shifts in the reductive and
  oxidative directions are associated with proliferation and apoptosis, respectively.
  Trxred/Trxox, reduced/oxidized thioredoxin. B, the GSH/cysteine cycle connects intra-
  and extracellular GSH and cysteine pools. Cysteine and cystine can be transported
  via Na+-dependent and Na+-independent transporters. Although the mechanisms of cystine
  reduction are not fully understood, it is reduced in the intracellular milieu, e.g.
  by GSH or thioredoxin. Alternatively, cysteine can be produced from homocysteine,
  which is a product of the methionine cycle, via the transsulfuration pathway catalyzed
  by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and γ-cystathionase (CSE). Cysteine is incorporated
  into GSH via the actions of γ-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthetase
  (GS). The transmembrane GSH/cysteine cycle, shown in red, results in circulation
  of intracellular GSH to the outside, where it is cleaved by the actions of γ-GT
  and a dipeptidase (DP). X and X-CH3 represent a methyl group acceptor and a methylated
  acceptor, respectively.
