caption: We used an integrated system biology approach to interrogate the islet and
  RpWAT transcriptome ,  in order to understand the molecular events underlying the
  impact of paternal HFD consumption. Some of the main findings and key players are
  illustrated above. Of interest, there was an over-representation of olfactory receptor
  (Olr) genes in both islet and RpWAT transcriptome . There were 411 differentially
  expressed genes in common between RpWAT and islet, of which Olr belonging to the
  olfactory transduction pathway is the most significantly enriched (P = 0.0003) .
  Many of the differentially expressed molecules/enriched pathways or networks in
  both tissues belong to the MAPK/ERK pathway; one of the common molecular networks
  between islet and RpWAT tissues, i.e., Cell cycle also shares a common hub gene,
  Myc . Taken together, these findings indicate paternal HFD exposure affects common
  network topologies in islets and RpWAT, thus implicating crosstalk or developmental
  changes that persist between these two metabolically related tissues.
