caption: A. Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)
  and interact with downstream effector proteins to stimulate changes in the actin
  cytoskeleton. Stimulation of F-actin stress fibers depletes cellular G-actin and
  allows MKL to translocate into the nuclear and activate gene transcription with
  SRF. In order to identify inhibitors of this pathway we have utilized a selective
  SRE-luciferase reporter system which we can transfect into cells along with upstream
  activators Gα13 and LARG. This assay has shown to be independent of cell type and
  can be stimulated anywhere along the pathway. Interestingly we have found that ROCK
  inhibitors are only ∼50% efficacious at inhibiting MKL/SRF gene transcription likely
  due to parallel pathways leading to F-actin formation. B. Using this assay we have
  produced multiple inhibitors of the Rho/MKL/SRF pathway. CCG-1423 was identified
  from a screen of 2,000 compounds and multiple SAR developments have led to our current
  lead compound, CCG-203971.
