caption: Proposed model of TfR1 transcriptional modulation by inflammatory and  anti-inflammatory
  signals in macrophages. The induction of TfR1 expression  in LPS-IFNγ-treated macrophage
  cells is regulated by a signaling pathway  that successively involves NF-κB activation,
  HIF-1 induction, and TfR1  transcription. The order of these events is indicated
  by the fact that HIF-1  activation is prevented by the NF-κB inhibitor Bay 11-7082,
  whereas  chetomin, which inhibits HIF-1 transcriptional activity, is unable to block  NF-κB
  induction. Adenosine plays a dual role; on the one hand, adenosine  receptor activation
  by the A2A receptor agonist CGS21680 may  inhibit NF-κB activation by LPS/IFNγ and
  the cascade of events  described above, thus possibly blunting the iron sequestration
  response  typical of the inflammatory status. On the other hand, it may enhance
  TfR1  expression by activating HIF-1 directly through an A2A  receptor-activated
  and NF-κB-independent signaling cascade  () under situations of  hypoxia, etc.
