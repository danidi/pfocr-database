caption: 'A different and more recently identified pathway to skeletal muscle atrophy,
  involving ATF4, Gadd45a, and p21During fasting, immobilization, and aging, an ATF4
  heterodimer activates the Gadd45a and p21 genes within skeletal muscle fibers, leading
  to increased expression of Gadd45a and p21 proteins. Gadd45a is a small globular
  protein that specifically interacts with at least 67 skeletal muscle proteins, including
  11 protein kinases and 3 protein tyrosine phosphatases. To date, one Gadd45a-interacting
  protein has been studied in detail: the MAP kinase kinase kinase MEKK4, which is
  allosterically activated by Gadd45a binding. The Gadd45a/MEKK4 complex activates
  four MAP kinase kinases (MKK3, 4, 6, and 7), leading to activation of p38 MAP kinase;
  this signaling cascade promotes muscle atrophy via biochemical mechanisms that are
  not yet understood. p21 is a small, intrinsically disordered protein that promotes
  muscle atrophy by an unknown biochemical mechanism. One important downstream effect
  of p21 is repression of the spermine oxidase (Smox) gene, which encodes an enzyme
  that protects against muscle atrophy. Additional regulators of the Gadd45a gene
  include histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4; during muscle denervation) and perhaps Foxo
  transcription factors (during fasting); additional regulators of the p21 gene include
  p53 (during immobilization).'
