caption: Control of the HiNF-P/p220NPATpathway by p57KIP2. Histone H4 gene transcription
  is controlled by the HiNF-P/p220NPAT complex that is activated in parallel to the
  E2F/pRB pathway that controls transcription of genes involved in nucleotide metabolism
  and DNA synthesis. Both pathways are responsive to growth factor dependent induction
  of CDK2/cyclin E at the R-point, and thus sensitive to the levels of CDK inhibitors.
  The findings in this study suggest that while p57KIP2 is not a strong CDK inhibitor,
  it can effectively inhibit CDK phosphorylation of p220NPAT through direct protein/protein
  interactions. It is possible that p57KIP2 can be recruited to histone gene promoters
  through interaction with the HiNF-P/p220NPAT complex.
