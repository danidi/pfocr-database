caption: Working model of the role of IL-6/STAT3 pathway on hypoxia promoting HCC
  progression after TACE. Hypoxia secondary to TACE hyperactivated IL-6/STAT3 signaling
  on residue HCC cells. More p-STAT3 was trans-located into nucleus of HCC cells and
  bound with the promoter of IL-6 and HIF-1α respectively, which kept the sustained
  activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling and increased the expression of HIF-1α. Consequently,
  HIF-1α up-regulated SNAI1 expression, induced EMT, and then accelerated the growth
  and metastases of the residue HCC cells and attenuated the anti-HCC effect of DOX
  during TACE.
