caption: Tuning the depth of quiescence for cancer therapy. (A) Quiescence depth is
  controlled by the activation threshold of Rb-E2f bistable switch, which can be modulated
  by other cellular activities such as metabolic and stress responses. Examples of
  coarse and fine tuners of quiescence depth identified in the Rb-E2f pathway are
  shown in bold and regular fonts, respectively, to the right of the green and red
  arrows in the bottom graph. Myc, proto-oncogene c-Myc; Ccnd1, cyclin D1; Ccne1,
  cyclin E1; Cdk4,6, cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6; Cdk2, cyclin-dependent kinase
  2; p21, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; Rb, retinoblastoma protein family,
  including Rb1, Rbl1/p107, and Rbl2/p130; E2f, activator E2f transcription factors,
  including E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3a. E2f-OFF and E2f-ON, the OFF and ON states of the
  Rb-E2f bistable switch, respectively. (B) Dormant cancer cells, due to pro-proliferative
  mutations, presumably feature a shallower and less stable quiescent state than healthy
  cells, and thus will be awoken first and exposed to chemotherapy when quiescence
  depth is reduced.
