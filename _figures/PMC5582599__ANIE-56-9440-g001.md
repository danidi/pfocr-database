caption: Alkaloid network in R. serpentina from strictosidine. Vomilenine is the central
  intermediate for the metabolic pathway to ajmaline, raucaffrinoline, raucaffricine,
  and 21‐hydroxysarpagane glucoside. Two routes from vomilenine to ajmaline are proposed.
  Functionally characterized enzymes are noted in black. Broken arrows represent uncharacterized
  reactions. The enzyme from this study is shown in red. VH=vinorine hydroxylase,
  VR1=19,20‐vomilenine reductase, VR2=1,2‐vomilenine reductase, PR=perakine reductase.
