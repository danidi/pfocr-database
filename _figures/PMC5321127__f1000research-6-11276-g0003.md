caption: ( A) P450-mediated intermolecular oxidative phenol coupling reaction. ( B)
  Divergent reactions catalyzed by non-heme iron enzymes SnoK and SnoN in the nogalamycin
  biosynthetic pathway. ( C) Epoxy hydrolases catalyzed by AIp1U and Lom6 in kinamycin
  and lomaiviticin biosynthesis. ( D) LanV and its homologous CabV (Urdmred)-catalyzed
  ketoreductions. ( E) ARX21-mediated keto-reductions. ( F) Reactions catalyzed by
  RdmB and DnrK. NADPH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; SAM,
  S-adenosyl methionine.
