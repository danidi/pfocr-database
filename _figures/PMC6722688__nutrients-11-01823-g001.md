caption: A simplified diagram of the metabolic fate of maternal dietary choline and
  its delivery to the developing fetus. In the liver, choline can be used to make
  phosphatidylcholine (PC) through the cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline pathway
  (CDP-PC), or it can be oxidized to betaine and serve as a source of methyl groups
  for PC synthesis via the de novo phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT)
  pathway (PEMT-PC). Both pathways are upregulated during the third trimester of pregnancy,
  but PEMT-derived PC is preferentially partitioned to the developing fetus. CM, chylomicron;
  MET, methionine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; VLDL,
  very low-density lipoprotein.
