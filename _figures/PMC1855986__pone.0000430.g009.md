caption: After IR, both the CDKF;1 pathway and WEE1 are regulated leading to inactive
  CDKA;1. WEE1, in addition to halting the basal transcription while disrupting in
  particular HDT/RBR/E2F complexes might specifically drive appropriate transcription
  as in human cells ; both are mediated by ATM. In addition, CDKF;1 is possibly deregulated,
  resulting in CDKA;1 inactivation. This might be promoted by stabilizing KRP6 by
  kinases, such as the AtMHK. Only KRP6 was upregulated after IR, however other KRPs
  might be involved. KRP6 might interact with CYCD3s or CYCD2-CDKs. In irradiated
  atm, transcription control might be lost due to misegulation of WEE1 and RBR/HDT
  and division of stem cells (white arrows) is promoted by deregulation of stem cell-maintaining
  RBR pathway, in addition to PAS2 deregulation and CDKF;1 misregulation. A competition
  between KRP/CYC/CDK and other regulators in stem cells might also lead to the differentiation
  of stem cells (green arrows) through ATM-dependent and independent (ATR, others)
  regulation of pre-existing factors at the time of IR . After ectopic division due
  to checkpoint abrogation, atm stem cells accumulated high amounts of unrepaired
  DNA and/or small amounts of DNA lesions that require ATM-Artemis-related DNA repair
  functions resulting in meristem consumption similar to irradiated human ataxia telangiectasia-cells.
  Dashed arrows indicate unknown regulators or pathways. Other regulators shown in  were
  not shown and images are extracted from .
