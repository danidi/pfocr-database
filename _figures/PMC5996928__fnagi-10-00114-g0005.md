caption: 'Molecular signaling pathways involved in astrocyte reaction in AD. Cartoon
  illustrating the JAK/STAT3, MAPK, CN/NFAT and NFκB signaling cascades. JAK/STAT3
  pathway: the JAKs (JAK 1, 2, 3 and Tyk2) are tyrosine-kinases associated with the
  intracellular domain of cytokine receptors. The binding of a cytokine ligand to
  its receptor triggers a dimerization or oligomerization of the associated JAK and
  this leads to its transphosphorylation and activation. The activated JAK then phosphorylates
  key tyrosine residues in the cytokine receptor, which leads to the recruitment of
  STAT (STAT1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B or 6) and a single tyrosine phosphorylation at the
  Y of its C-terminus. Once phosphorylated, STAT forms homo or heterodimers and is
  imported to the nucleus, where it complexes with other transcription factors, notably
  NFkB, to bind its target genes. MAPK pathway: the p38 mitogen-activating protein
  kinase (p38 MAPK) is a family of serine-threonine kinases of which p38α is the most
  studied due to its ubiquitous expression at high levels. p38α phosphorylates multiple
  substrates including transcription factors, DNA and RNA binding proteins, other
  serine-threonine kinases (including GSK3β), and cell cycle and pro-apoptotic proteins.
  Calcineurin/NFAT pathway: the phosphatase function of CN is activated upon the binding
  of calcium and calmodulin to its regulatory subunit. Once activated, CN removes
  several phosphate residues from the N-terminus of the transcription factors NFATc
  (nuclear factor of activated T cells) proteins, named NFATc1 to 4, and exposes their
  nuclear localization motif, leading to their rapid entry into the nucleus. NFATc
  targets are largely genes encoding cytokines, growth factors and their receptors,
  and cell adhesion proteins, as well as many microRNAs. NFκB pathway: NFκB is a heterodimeric
  transcription factor composed of the subunits p65/RelA and p50, which belong to
  the Rel family of proteins. It is normally located in the cytoplasm in an inactive
  form due to its binding to the inhibitor IκB, which masks its nuclear localization
  signal located in the p65 subunit. Activation of IKK complex by certain extracellular
  signals can dissociate NFκB and IκB by promoting the phosphorylation of the IκB-α,
  which is a necessary step for IκB-α ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by
  the proteasome. Once free from IκB, NFκB can translocate to the nucleus and bind
  to the 10 base pair consensus-sequence GGGACTTTCC GGGRNNYYCC in the promoter of
  its target genes (NFκB response elements). Abbreviations: CN, calcineurin; COX,
