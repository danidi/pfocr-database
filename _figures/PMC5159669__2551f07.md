caption: Proposed models of two separable mTORC1 pathways. (A) Amino acid sensing
  in the presence of FLCN leads to activation of RagC/D, leading to recruitment of
  TFE3 to the Rag complex and subsequent phosphorylation by mTORC1. Phosphorylated
  TFE3 is bound by 14-3-3 and sequestered in the cytoplasm. In the absence of FLCN,
  TFE3 translocates to the nucleus and activates PGC-1β > PGC-1α and mitochondrial
  and brown/beige fat genes. (B) The canonical mTORC1–S6K pathway induced by amino
  acid or growth factor stimulation does not require FLCN, and this pathway is separable
  from TFE3 phosphorylation. Growth factors modulate mTORC1 activity via repression
  of TSC1/2, while β3 adrenergic signaling modulates mTORC1 activity via PKA-mediated
  phosphorylation of mTOR. The PKA–mTORC1 branch induces the classic thermogenic browning
  program and also leads to S6K phosphorylation but not cytoplasmic sequestration
  of TFE3.
