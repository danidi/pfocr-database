caption: 'Mitochondrial pathway targets of SIRT3. The metabolic pathways, protein
  complexes and individual proteins deacetylated by SIRT3 are highlighted by asterisks.
  In general, the deacetylation of these proteins results in increased protein/pathway
  activation. The exception is the deacetylation of cyclophilin D (Cyp D), as this
  modification inhibits this protein to attenuate susceptibility to increased mitochondrial
  permeability. Additional abbreviations: TCA – tricarboxylic acid; PDH – pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; I – IV – represent the complex of the election transfer chain; Fo
  and F1 are components of ATP synthase; ANT – adenine nucleotide translocase, UCP
  – uncoupling proteins, VDAC – voltage dependent anion channel.'
