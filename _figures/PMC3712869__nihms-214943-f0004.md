caption: Upon binding Shh, Ptc1 releases the inhibition of Smo. The effect of Shh
  on smooth muscle differentiation and patterning is mediated by Gli2, which, upon
  translocation into the nucleus, regulates downstream genes including BMP4. BMP4
  may inhibit cellular proliferation and is a prime candidate for mediating the effect
  of Shh on smooth muscle patterning during bladder development. Other signaling molecules,
  such as TGF-β and SRF, likely have a role in bladder smooth muscle differentiation
  and may interact with the Shh pathway. The mechanism through which Shh affects cellular
  proliferation in the bladder is uncertain but MPF has been shown to be a Shh-responsive
  complex that regulates mitosis in other systems.
