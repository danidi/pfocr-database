caption: Model of nuclear α1‐AR signaling in adult cardiac myocytes. The figure depicts
  α1‐ARs localized to the inner nuclear membrane (INM; ). Furthermore, α1‐ARs colocalize
  with Gαq, a phospholipase C isozyme (PLCβ1?), as well as PKCα, δ, and ε () only
  at the nucleus. Catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (NE), are actively transported
  into cardiac myocytes through organic cation transporter‐3 (OCT). NE binding to
  α1‐ARs leads to activation of PKC in the nucleus (), and nuclear localization is
  required for signaling (). Signals are transported out of the nucleus through the
  nuclear pore complex (NPC; inhibited by lepB; ). PKCδ induces phosphorylation of
  cTnI at the sarcomere to regulate contractility in adult cardiac myocytes (Figures  and
  ). In addition, nuclear α1‐AR signaling induces activation of ERK in caveolae at
  the plasma membrane to regulate survival signaling in adult cardiac myocytes. cTnI
  indicates cardiac troponin I; DAG, diacylglycerol; ER/SR, endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic
  reticulum; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen‐activated protein
  kinase kinase; NR, nucleoplasmic reticulum; PKC, protein kinase C; PTP, permeability
  transition pore; RYR, ryanodine receptor; α1‐ARs, α1‐adrenergic receptors.
