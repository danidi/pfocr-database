caption: A hypothetical cascade pathway of the suppression of tumor cell invasion
  and proliferation by AGPAT9. AGPAT9 could significantly inhibit the V-ATPase activity
  and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration, and in turn the activation of secreted
  MMP-2/MMP-9, which ultimately suppressed tumor's invasion. AGPAT9 inhibited breast
  cancer proliferation through, at least in part, suppressing the V-ATPase activity
  and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
