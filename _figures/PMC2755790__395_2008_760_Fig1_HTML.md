caption: 'Network analysis of differentially expressed proteins (red symbols) involved
  in arteriogenesis. We performed a literature scan (Pathway Studio) in order to retrieve
  an extract of regulatory and interaction pathways. Different ligands and receptors
  act in concert leading to an activation of a variety of transcription factors and
  signalling pathways via the central players calcium and NO. Bold arrows indicate
  a fluid shear stress activated new pathway, which resulted from the molecular investigation
  of the shunt model. (FSS fluid shear stress, MCP-1 monocyte chemo-attractant protein,
  Dll1 delta-like1, JAG1 jagged1, VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, FN1 fibronectin,
  Trpv4 transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4, NOS1 neuronal
  nitric oxide synthase, NOS2A inducible nitric oxide synthase, NOS3 endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase, ITGA5: αVβ3 Integrin, EFNB2 Ephrin B2, NO nitric oxide, KLF2 Krueppel-like
  factor2, SRF serum response factor, EGR1 early growth response1, RHOA ras homolog
  gene family, member A, CFL1 cofilin1, Abra actin binding Rho activator, Dream DRE
  antagonist modulator, TMSB4X thymosinβ4, Dstn destrin)'
