caption: Proteome Model-Proteins are synthesized by ribosomes and subsequently fold
  into their mature conformation. The degradation of folded or unfolded proteins begins
  immediately after synthesis, following first order rate kinetics. Most of these
  cellular proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway into oligopeptides.
  A fraction of these peptides escape further hydrolysis into amino acids when they
  are transported into the ER. This process provides the MHC class I antigen presentation
  pathway with a sampling of peptides from all cellular proteins, including mature
  folded proteins and defective ones (the proteome).DRiPs Model- Ribosomes, or the
  hypothetical error-prone immunoribosomes, synthesizes a cohort of functional and
  defective proteins. The defective proteins (DRiPs) are ubiquitinated and rapidly
  degraded by the proteasome. By an unknown mechanism (possibly preferential uptake
  into the ER and/or exclusion of peptides derived from mature proteins) the DRiP-derived
  peptides may be preferentially loaded on MHC class I molecules. Consequently, newly
  synthesized defective proteins constitute the dominant source of presented peptides,
  either at early time points (e.g. post viral infection) and/or at all time points
  [].
