caption: p-Akt is inhibited by Dok2, which also reqruits RasGAP. RasGAP inhibits p-Erk,
  resulting in inhibition of IL-8. Inhibition of p-rpS6 by CD200R is a result of the
  inhibition of both p-Akt and p-Erk, although CD200R-mediated p-rpS6 inhibition might
  also be the result of another yet unknown pathway. This figure was adapted from
  Van der Vlist et al. [].
