caption: 'Protection: The microbiota of the host activates the inflammasome by priming
  signal 1 for IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. The secretion of these cytokines induces
  migration of dendritic cells from the lung to the draining lymph node, where they
  prime T cells. The downstream effect of T-cell priming is protection of the host
  against influenza virus-induced pathology. Indirect promotion: In the case of MuLV,
  the microbiota of the host stimulate proliferation of lymphoid cells that are targeted
  by the virus. Direct promotion: Microbial ligands, such as LPS, are utilized by
  viruses to enhance their attachment to target cells (polio virus and reovirus) or
  to counteract the antivirus immune response by activating the TLR4 pathway, which
  leads to IL-10 production (MMTV).'
