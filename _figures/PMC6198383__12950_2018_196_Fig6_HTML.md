caption: Flowchart of the hypothesised intracellular pathway after LPS stimulation
  of MonoMac6 cells. Stimulation with LPS led to a rapid increase in the expression
  and secretion of IL-6. Since ZNF580 was elevated during this time, induction of
  IL-6 must be via other factors, e. g. NFκB. The early increase of ZNF580 could temporally
  limit the initial transient peak of IL-6 production. Since ZNF580 showed a biphasic
  response to LPS, its decrease later supports continued production of IL-6
