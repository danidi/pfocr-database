caption: A simplified version of the biochemical pathway controlling pigment biosynthesis
  in insects is shown with regulators controlling expression of individual pigment
  synthesis genes in at least one Drosophila species overlaid. Genes colored red are
  part of the pigment biosynthesis pathway; metabolites are colored gray; and gray
  arrows indicate chemical reactions during pigmentation synthesis. Genes colored
  in blue are part of the regulatory network that directly (solid arrows) or indirectly
  (broken arrows) modulate enzyme expression during pigmentation development in Drosophila.
  Pointed and blunt arrows indicate positive and negative regulatory interactions,
  respectively. The pigment biosynthesis pathway is conserved among all Drosophila,
  but the regulatory relationships shown often function in only a subset of Drosophila
  species (; ).
