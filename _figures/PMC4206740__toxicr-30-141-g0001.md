caption: 'Endothelium-derived relaxing factors of small resistance arteries in normotensive
  and hypertensive conditions. EC: endothelial cells, SMC: smooth muscle cells. (A)
  Small resistance arteries induce vasorelaxation via multiple vasorelaxing pathways
  including NOS, COX, and EDHF pathways in the normotensive condition. COX in endothelial
  cells produces PGI2. PGI2 can cross the membrane of endothelial cells, and binds
  IP receptor on the plasma membrane of smooth muscle cells, which induces the activation
  of the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase
  A (PKA) signal transduction pathway. Activated PKA phosphorylates target proteins,
  resulting in vasorelaxation. NOS3 produces NO in response to several stimuli such
  as shear stress, hypoxia, and vasoactive neurotransmitters. NO activates soluble
  guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in smooth muscle cells. Activated sGC catalyzes the conversion
  of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP directly
  and indirectly modulates numerous targets, including protein kinases such as protein
  kinase G (PKG), resulting in vasorelaxation. Intercellular K+ ion, EETs, hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2), and gap junctions, proposed candidates of EDHF, induce various
  K+ channels activation by complex mechanisms to facilitate hyperpolarization of
  the underlying smooth muscle cells, which results in vasorelaxation. (B) The NOS-dependent
  component becomes the primary EDRF pathway in small arteries in the hypertensive
  condition, in which NOS utilizes both NOS-derived NO/cGMP and NOS-dependent H2O2
  to promote vasorelaxation, while other EDRFs are diminished.'
