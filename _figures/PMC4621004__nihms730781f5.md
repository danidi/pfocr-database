caption: Strategies for targeting RAGE. Experimental evidence from animal models as
  well as associative evidence in human studies provides strong support for the role
  of this pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. Indeed, a
  number of therapeutic strategies targeting RAGE and its signaling pathways are in
  active therapeutic development. Examples of such strategies are shown in this figure,
  including sRAGE, the extracellular ligand binding domain of RAGE that sequesters
  RAGE ligands and blocks their activation of cell surface receptors (I); anti-RAGE
  antibodies (II); small molecules that block the binding of RAGE ligands to the receptor
  (III); RAGE peptide aptamers that block ligand binding to the various domains of
  RAGE (IV); nanocarriers delivering siRNAs to knockdown RAGE expression (V); and
  small molecules (or other forms of agents) that block the binding of the RAGE tail
  to the FH1 domain of mDia1 (VI).
