caption: A partial carbohydrate and starch metabolic pathway showing the 16 enzyme-catalyzed
  reaction classes for which polymorphisms in 25 candidate gene sequences and r locus
  were characterized. Enzyme classes where significant association between candidate
  gene polymorphism and CLD were identified are shown in shaded boxes. Enzyme Commission
  (EC) numbers are shown
