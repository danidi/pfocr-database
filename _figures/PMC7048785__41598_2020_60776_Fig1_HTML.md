caption: Simplified representation of the SG pathway. The largest arrows show the
  primary route of synthesis for the predominant SGs stevioside and Reb A. Steps of
  the pathway catalyzed by a UGT for which experimental evidence has been published
  are indicated by solid arrows. Steps of the pathway predicted to occur, but not
  experimentally demonstrated to be catalyzed by a specific UGT are indicated with
  dashed arrows. The UGT enzyme responsible, or proposed to be responsible, for a
  given reaction is indicated on the left of the arrow; steps where a non-glucose
  sugar is added are represented in blue type. The 76G1 enzyme that is the subject
  of this report is shown in red type, and steps shown to be associated with 76G1
  herein (by in vitro and/or in vivo evidence) are indicated with red arrows.
