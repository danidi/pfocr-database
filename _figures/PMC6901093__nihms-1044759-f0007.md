caption: Association of environmental chemicals with the metabolome. The 1037 m/z
  features associated with deployment to Balad () were examined for association with
  271 environmental chemicals (See Smith et al. in the present Supplement) (A), PAH
  (B) and cotinine () (C) using xMWAS (). A, Two major metabolic communities are identified;
  blue, environmental chemicals Ametryn and Dinotefuran association with 32 m/z features,
  which included the putative annotations the pesticide Sulfuramid, and the bacterial
  metabolite Janthitrem C; orange, metabolic community with anthelmintic agent metrifonate
  are shown, which was associated 119 m/z features which included the purine metabolites
  guanosine pentaphosphate and guanosyl-methylene triphosphate, the biopterin pathway
  metabolite dihydroneopterin 3-triphosphate, and the dipeptide arginyl-glutamine
  (r < 0.5 at p < 0.05). B, Two metabolic communities were associated with PAH’s.
  Blue, community includes two m/z features associated with benzo(ghi)perylene, one
  of which was annotated as the alkaloid neurine. Orange, includes twenty-four m/z
  features associated fluoranthene, and included the (protein breakdown product glutamyl-glutamine
  and (iso)leucyl-(iso)leucine), the lipids sphingosine and sphinganine, and the omega-3
  fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (r < 0.25 at p < 0.05). C, cotinine is associated
  with 19 m/z features and include Sulfuramid, Janthitrem C, metrifonate, and the
  alkaloid isococculidine r < 0.35 at p < 0.05).
