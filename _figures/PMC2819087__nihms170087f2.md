caption: Protein sorting as a key mechanism in Alzheimer’s cell biology. (A) Aβ (red
  bar) is liberated from its parent protein, APP (multicolor bar), in two enzymatic
  steps. In the first β-cleavage step, BACE (blue bar) splits full-length APP into
  an sAPPβ fragment (brown bar) and a C-terminal fragment (CTFβ, red/green bar). Then,
  in the γ-cleavage step, the γ-secretase (star) splits CTFβ into Aβ (red bar) and
  amyloid intracellular domain (AICD, green bar). β-cleavage is the committed step
  in APP processing and may be upregulated in LOAD. (B) Both APP (red bar) and BACE
  (blue bar) are type-I transmembrane proteins that are sorted through multiple membranous
  compartments of the cell. The sorting triangle that interconnects the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN), cell surface, and the endosome is critically important for APP and
  BACE sorting. As indicated, clathrin is the coat complex that regulates transport
  from the cell surface and the TGN to the endosome, whereas the retromer is the coat
  complex that regulates transport from the endosome back to the TGN. APP and BACE
  interact within the membranes of the endosomal system, initiating the amyloidogenic
  pathway. (Illustration adapted from Small and Gandy.) (In color in Annals online.)
