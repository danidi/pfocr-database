caption: Zn2+-dependent and pH-dependent regulation of ERp44 for efficient client
  retention in the early secretory pathway. Proposed working model of the Zn2+-dependent
  and pH-dependent ERp44 cycle operating for protein quality control in the ESP. In
  the ERGIC and cis-Golgi, ERp44 is in equilibrium between monomeric metal-free, monomeric
  Zn2+-bound, and Zn2+-mediated homodimeric conformations. Upon the arrival of a client
  like Ero1α, the equilibrium is shifted in favor of the monomeric state with the
  C-tail opened, favoring the exposure of the RDEL motif. Thus, the ERp44–client complex
  is promptly bound by KDELR and therewith transported back to the ER. The lower Zn2+
  concentration in the neutral ER likely promotes the dissociation of the ERp44–client
  complexes, allowing another ERp44 cycle through the ESP
