caption: Carbon fixation with the HPHB cycle is used for the biomass synthesis via
  the transfer of acetyl-CoA to the citrate cycle or gluconeogenesis, and the genes
  responsible for each step are marked with green words. Intermediates connected with
  colored lines represent different metabolic pathways.
