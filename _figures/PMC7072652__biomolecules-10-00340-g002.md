caption: 'Failure of major homeostatic mechanisms contributes to senescence onset.
  Failure of major homeostatic mechanisms (autophagy, proteostasis and DNA damage
  repair networks and mitochondrial respiratory metabolism) in MSC is caused by aging
  or conditions that accelerate tissue aging, such as the obesity-associated systemic
  low-grade inflammation that impact on mitochondrial function. (A) Homeostasis is
  tightly controlled by the balance between the insulin/IGF_mTOR signaling and Sirt1.
  In conditions of homeostasis normal mitochondrial function, biogenesis and autophagy
  (mitophagy) guarantee that ROS level is kept to the minimum required for intracellular
  signaling. Both genomic and mitochondrial DNA are preserved from oxidative damage.
  Proteostasis is guaranteed by the correct functioning of the unfolded protein response
  (UPR) and clearance via autophagy or the ubiquitin-proteasome system. (B) Deranged
  metabolic factors together with aging contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation
  of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and RNS (reactive nitrogen species) that increase
  the level of protein misfolding and aggregation, and impact on the integrity of
  both mitochondrial and genomic DNA. Accumulation of DNA damage cannot be efficiently
  corrected because mitochondrial dysfunction leads to failure of the energy supply
  required by the DNA damage response. Persistent DNA damage is responsible for chronic
  NF-κB activation and inflammation, leading to the “metabolic syndrome.” A positive
  feedback loop between metabolic syndrome and inflammation is even worsened by excessive
  ROS and RNS produced by the dysfunctional mitochondria. Persistent DNA damage is
  then responsible for p53 activation, with functional consequences for the cells
  that include cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis, according to an increasing
  degree. The “senescence pathway” depicted may be targeted for therapeutic intervention:
  the figure reports the major senotherapeutic classes acting at different functional
  levels as detailed in the text, although some molecules exert pleiotropic activities.'
