caption: Schematic illustration of Wnt1/β-catenin signaling as a key player in neuroprotection
  via DAergic neuron–astrocyte crosstalk and promoting neurogenesis via neuroprogenitor–astrocyte
  crosstalk. This is a simplified scheme linking reactive astrocytes and Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling to nigrostriatal injury and repair in the MPTP mouse model of PD. Astrocyte-derived
  Wnts, particularly Wnt1, control the integrity of DA neurons via blockade of GSK-3β-induced
  phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation of the neuronal pool of β-catenin. Activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can also promote neurogenesis from adult midbrain progenitors.
  Neurotoxic injury or increased oxidative load as a result of aging may antagonize
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling in DAergic neurons by upregulating active GSK-3β, leading
  to β-catenin degradation and increased DAergic neuron vulnerability. Neuronal injury
  also triggers reactive astrocyte expression of a panel of growth and neurotrophic
  factors, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective mechanisms, among which astrocyte Wnt1
  may function as a vital component of the self-protective machinery of DAergic neurons,
  shifting the balance towards the programming of cell survival/neurorescue on the
  on hand, and promoting neurogenesis on the other. From  with permission.
