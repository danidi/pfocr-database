caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed role of Foxg1 in CM development. Graded
  expression of Foxg1 in the retina is shown in grey with a strong grey shade in the
  nasal and a lighter one in the temporal component of a wild type (Foxg1+/+) where
  Foxg1 normally represses the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in the nasal CM (A).
  Specification of the temporal CM may require the Wnt/β-catenin and/or the Bmp signalling
  pathways. Foxd1, depicted in graded blue, may restrict expansion of temporal CM
  fates (A). The high-to-low gradient of expression of Sox2 and that of low-to-high
  of Pax6 from the central to the peripheral retina are shown in shades of red and
  purple respectively (A). The yellow shade depicts expression of the central retina
  markers Sfrp2 and Cyclin D1 examined in this study (A). The CM markers studied are
  represented in brown in both the wild type (A) and mutant (Foxg1−/−) (B). In the
  mutant, Wnt/β-catenin signalling is upregulated and the nasal retina is expanded
  abnormally (B). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
