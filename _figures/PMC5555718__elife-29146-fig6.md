caption: 'Histamine is initially synthesized by histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) in photoreceptor
  cells (PR). Upon light stimulation, PRs release histamine into the synaptic cleft.
  Released histamine is quickly taken up by an unknown histamine transporter into
  epithelial glial cells that express Ebony. In these glia, histamine is conjugated
  to β-alanine, which inactivates histamine and generates carcinine. Carcinine is
  released into the synaptic cleft and subsequently internalized, via CarT, by the
  PRs. After carcinine is hydrolyzed to histamine and β-alanine by Tan hydrolase in
  the PR, histamine is re-packaged into synaptic vesicles, whereas β-alanine is delivered
  to and subsequently internalized, via the BalaT transporter, by retinal pigment
  cells (PCs). PCs can store β-alanine or deliver β-alanine to the laminar glia cells
  through a gap junction network involving Inx1 and Inx3, which are expressed in PCs.
  In glial cells, β-alanine is conjugated to histamine, and the cycle repeats. Moreover,
  β-alanine can be synthesized by Black, which is an aspartate decarboxylase that
  is expressed together with Ebony in optic lobe glia.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29146.024'
