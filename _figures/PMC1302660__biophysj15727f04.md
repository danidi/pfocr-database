caption: Singular value decomposition of sample reaction networks. The SVD of these
  three reaction networks demonstrates how the SVD characterizes general properties
  of the solution cone, defining the phenotypic possibilities of the metabolic networks.
  In panel A, we have the simplest case—the linear chain of reactions has simply one
  extreme pathway, and consequently the first mode characterizes 100% of the extreme
  pathway matrix. This cone can be visualized as a simple vector, the “narrowest”
  possible case. In panel B, the system has four extreme pathways. Its first mode
  characterizes 47% of the total solution space. In panel C, the system has six extreme
  pathways. The first mode characterizes only 39% of the system. The first modes represent
  valid biochemical pathways in the network. The black and gray arrows in subsequent
  modes represent increased and decreased flux levels, respectively. The widths of
  all of the arrows in the representations of the modes are proportional to the flux
  through the corresponding reaction.
