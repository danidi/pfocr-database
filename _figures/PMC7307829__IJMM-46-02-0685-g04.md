caption: Analysis of TLK1 interactome and hypothetical pathway. (A) TLK1 network identified
  from network analysis identifies 1 subnetwork consists of 626 nodes and 1,831 edges.
  Nodes were then filtered based on enriched KEGG pathways P<0.01. (B) Hypothetical
  model of the TLK1 RAC2 CDC42 PAK2 regulation pathways in GBM. CDC42 is localized
  within the nucleus together with TLK1. CDC42, being a small Ras GTP binding protein,
  may bind to TLK1 and be a substrate for TLK1. Activated CDC42 in the nucleus binds
  or interacts with activated TLK1 protein kinase to emit signals to the other CDC42
  binding protein that is localized in the cytoplasm, to induce binding with activated
  RAC2. In other cases, activated CDC42 may bind to activate TLK1 and later be released
  into the cytoplasm to emit signal while binding with RAC2. In a homeostatic environment,
  CDC42 and RAC2 will bind to p21 protein, which becomes activated PAK2 and emits
  signals for other downstream molecules. PAK2 signals AKT1 for the regulation of
  survival pathways. PAK2 also regulates cell cycle activity with PLK1 and cyclin
  D1 for initiation of transcriptional machinery. TLK1, tousled like kinase 1; CDC42,
  cell division cycle 42; RAC2, Rac family small GTPase 2; PAK2, p21 (RAC1) activated
  kinase 2; AKT1, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1.
