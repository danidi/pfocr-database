caption: 'Schema of a B. azoricus gill bacteriocyte. (a) Dissected B. azoricus specimen
  showing gills and gill filaments. (b) Schema of single gill filament. (c) Schematic
  cross-section of a gill filament showing bacteriocytes. (d) A single bacteriocyte
  showing the central pathways of the symbionts. Symbionts (thiotroph: green, methanotroph:
  red) are located inside vacuoles (white) surrounded by the bacteriocyte cytosol
  (brown) with gases and substrates exchanged between vent fluids (blue) flushing
  the gills. An overview of the basic metabolic processes occurring in the symbionts
  is shown. AT: ammonium transporter, DH: dehydrogenase, DeNit: denitrification, FormAsn:
  formaldehyde assimilation, FormOx: formaldehyde oxidation to formate and CO2, HydOx:
  hydrogen oxidation, MetOx: methane oxidation by pMMO (particulate methane-monooxygenase
  enzyme complex) to methanol and then to formaldehyde (see  for details), NitAsn:
  nitrogen assimilation, NitRes: nitrate respiration (see  for details on nitrogen
  metabolism), NT: nitrate transporter, OxRes: Oxidative phosphorylation with oxygen
  as terminal electron acceptor, SOX: thiosulfate oxidation, SulfOx: sulfide oxidation
  via the rDSR-APS-Sat pathway (see ), TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle, TRAP: tripartite
  ATP-independent periplasmic transporter, T1SS: Type I secretion system, T2SS: Type
  II secretion system. *toxins are known to be secreted by the thiotrophs ().'
