caption: Placental ischemia is a central causative agent in the development of preeclampsia.
  In response to chronic hypoxia/ischemia, multiple pathogenic agents are released
  into the maternal circulation. Among the most prominent is the antiangiogenic protein
  soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), which decreases free VEGF in the maternal
  circulation. Also inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and agonistic antibodies to
  the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1-AA). Each of these factors has been shown experimentally
  to act through the activation of the endothelin-1 (ET-1) system, leading to maternal
  hypertension, and indicating that the ET-1 system might be a logical target for
  the management of hypertension in the preeclamptic patient.
