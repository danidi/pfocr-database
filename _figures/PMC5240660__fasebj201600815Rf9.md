caption: Evolutionary history of the PTH family in vertebrates. A) Analysis reveals
  4 PTH ohnologs (PTH1–4) that arose because of 2 rounds of 1R/2R WGD in early vertebrates
  and third round (3R) in teleosts (a/b paralogs). The absence of Pth4 in eutherian
  mammals is related to an ancestral gene loss that likely occurred when this clade
  diverged from metatherian mammals. B) This loss is concomitant with the recruitment
  of PTH1 from parathyroid glands in eutherians to provide an equivalent function
  to the Pth4 neuropeptide in bone mineral homeostasis, as it is represented by zebrafish
  and human diagrams, in which both PTH peptides provoke similar responses in phosphate
  and calcium homeostasis, acting in bone and regulating the expression of the same
  regulatory genes in homologous organs.
