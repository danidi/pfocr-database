caption: In vivo, multiple triggers exist to stimulate low levels of IFN signaling,
  thereby generating a cell- intrinsic IFN activation status during homeostasis. The
  microbiota of the organism acts as an endogenous IFN trigger, presumably through
  activation of TLRs 3 and 4 -both signal through TRIF to activate IRF3 for IFN induction.
  Intracellular Pattern Recognition pathways can also receive signals from self-derived
  DNA, RNA, and stress signals. Undigested DNA from lysosomes, mitochondrial DNA (mDNA)
  exposed during mitochondrial turnover, and damaged DNA from the nucleus can all
  activate the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway cGAS/STING to induce IFN via IRF3 activity.
  Under conditions of cellular stress, reactivation of endogenous retroelements can
  generate RNA species to activate the cytosolic RNA sensing pathway RIG- I/MAVS.
  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) from stressed mitochondria can furthermore trigger
  MAVS signaling in the absence of viral ligands. MAVS activation results in IRF3
  transcription of Ifn genes. IRF3 is thus a central player in the endogenous production
  of IFN during homeostasis.Post IFN production, the cytokine binds to dimeric IFNAR
  receptors on the cell surface in an autocrine or paracrine manner, activating transcription
  factors STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 to initiate transcription of ISGs. Constitutive IFN signaling
  thus generates a baseline IFN signature in the cell, referred to in the diagram
  as “Constitutive Isg-ome”, amongst which are components within the IFNAR signaling
  pathway including STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. Understanding which genes/proteins are
  present within the “Constitutive Isg-ome” will significantly aid our understanding
  of the mechanism behind rapid cellular responses to stress and infection.
