  of eEF-2K activity through an inhibitory phosphorylation (these sites include Ser-78,
  Ser-359, Ser-366 and Ser-396). Regulation through the mTOR pathway involves the
  phosphorylation of Ser-366 by p70 S6 kinase, and the phosphorylation of Ser-359
  and Ser-78 by at least two additional unknown kinases (–). It has been postulated
  that the Ser-78 phosphorylation acts to hinder the binding of CaM to eEF-2K ().
  The cdc2-cyclin B complex has been shown to modulate eEF-2K activity via Ser-359
  in a manner that is dependent on the cell cycle as well as amino acid availability,
  and is perhaps controlled by mTOR (). Regulation through the MAPK cascade occurs
  via the phosphorylation of Ser-366 by p90RSK1 in an ERK-dependent fashion (). In
  addition, the stress-activated protein kinases p38α and p38δ inhibit eEF2K via phosphorylation

  of Ser-398 by the energy-supply regulator AMPK is known to activate eEF-2K (). The
  cAMP-dependent PKA has also been shown to activate eEF-2K via a phosphorylation
  on Ser-500, and in the process imparts Ca2+-independent activity to the kinase (–);

  Thr-353, Ser-445, Ser-474 and Ser-500). Of the 5 autophosphorylation sites, only
  Thr-348 appears to be essential for activity against its substrate. Ser-500 is an
  autophosphorylation site and is also known to be phosphorylated by PKA, and could
  be the key residue responsible for autophosphorylation-induced Ca2+-independent
  (CaM-dependent – this work) activity (, ). The role of the phosphorylation at Ser-377
  by MAPKAP-K2 has not yet been determined ().'
