caption: Graphic illustration of the principal organization of the human inner hair
  cell receptor-neural junction. A basal lamina margins the neural pathway that coalesces
  with the organ of Corti. Action potentials are believed to be generated in the sub-receptor
  zone beneath the habenular canal. In rodents Nav1.6 is localized in a hemi-node
  consistent with the location of spike generation (Hossain et al., ). There are also
  low- and high-voltage activated potassium channels essential for adaptation and
  regulation of AP activity (Smith et al., ; Kim and Rutherford, ).
