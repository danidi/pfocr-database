caption: Illustration of key components involved in phosphorus starvation metabolic
  pathway in barley. Plant hormones and phosphorus transporters, acting as sensors
  and messengers, quickly responded to the changes of external phosphorus levels.
  The synthesis of strigolactones and cytokinin suppressed shoot branching and the
  Pi starvation response, respectively. Expression of phosphorus transporters were
  regulated by SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1, which also positively regulated the response of
  Pi deficiency through the MYB transcription factor PHL/PHR and SPX1. Phloem-mobile
  sucrose and ethylene could regulate the changes of root system architecture (RSA).
  In the cells of leaves, experiments were performed at physiological and molecular
  levels. Anthocyanin synthesis (①) was conducted after the shikimate pathway and
  Pi was released at the same time. Phospholipids (③) were degraded into Pi and replaced
  by glycolipids and sulfolipids. Molecules (②, ④, and ⑤) containing phosphorus were
  also degraded into Pi. In the root cells, organic acids (⑥ and ⑦) and enzymes including
  acid phosphates and RNase were produced and excreted into rhizospheres to solubilize
  compounds containing phosphorus. Phosphoenolpyruvate (⑧) was catalyzed into pyruvate
  and Pi by kinase. Pi and other metabolites were transported from roots to shoots
  through the xylem (green arrows), while sucrose and ethylene were conveyed from
  shoots to roots by the phloem in red arrows, which also indicate that transportation
  was conducted from roots to rhizospheres. Black arrows and red terminated lines
  represent positive regulation and suppressed expression, respectively. Key genes,
  transcription factors and Pi are marked in red font. The yellow and dark cyan boxes
  represent metabolites and responses of Pi deficiency, respectively. The red box
  shows the condition of the external environment. The dotted box represents the plant
  hormones. The words with green background express the tissues of plant and rhizosphere.
  Words with yellow background represent xylem and phloem. The yellow ovals show the
  cells in the roots and leaves. In the cell, the green oval represents the chloroplast.
  The purple oval represents the vacuole. The pink oval represents the mitochondria.
  The light cyan oval represents the endoplasmic reticulum. The yellow words with
  black background represent the organelles and cytoplast. The words with black font
  express metabolic intermediates and organic phosphorus except RPPP, shikimate pathway,
  glycolysis and the TCA cycle. SL, Strigolactone; CK, Cytokinins; Pi, Inorganic phosphorus;
