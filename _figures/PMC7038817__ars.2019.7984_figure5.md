caption: Cumulus cell defensive mechanisms against oxidative stress in the oocyte.
  The cumulus cells are connected between themselves and the oocyte through gap junctions
  present in the transzonal projections that permit the transfer of several molecules
  essential for oocyte survival. The cumulus cells capture glucose from the follicle
  microenvironment and process it through glycolysis, generating pyruvate that the
  oocyte will metabolize through the TAC+OXPHOS, producing biomolecules, energy (ATP),
  and ROS. ROS such as the anion superoxide (O2•−) can be detrimental. The cumulus
  also deviates glucose to the PPP, essential for amino acid production and NADPH
  recycling, a cofactor essential for antioxidant reactions. Essential defensive molecules
  such as GSH and NADPH are also supplied. Besides that, the cumulus is responsible
  for CAT production, an enzyme that metabolizes the reactive hydrogen peroxide and
  that is not expressed by the oocyte. The cumulus and oocyte also possess SOD, the
  enzyme responsible for metabolizing superoxide anion into peroxide, a less reactive
  form; GR promotes GSSG recycling back to the reduced form, GSH; and GPx metabolizes
  peroxide into water and O2, using GSH as an electron acceptor, and reduces lipid
  hydroperoxides. All these enzymes are involved in oxidative stress defense. SOD
  can be located at the cytoplasm as the copper and zinc variant (CuZnSOD), or in
  mitochondria as the manganese variant (MnSOD). Both cell types are capable of synthesizing
  melatonin, but the oocyte itself does not produce enough levels of antioxidant defenses,
  being dependent on the cumulus cells. CAT, catalase; CuZnSOD, copper/zinc superoxide
