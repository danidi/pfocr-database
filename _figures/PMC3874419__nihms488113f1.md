caption: Signaling cross-talk at the various levels of EGFR/HER2 signaling pathways.
  EGFR/HER2 signaling pathways cross-talk with other signaling pathways mainly at
  receptor, mediator and effector levels. The cross-talk at the receptor level includes
  other receptor tyrosine kinases, which have common downstream targets of EGFR/HER2,
  and affects their signaling pathway. The cross-talk at mediator level includes the
  activators of key downstream signaling, such as RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways.
  Multiple genetic alterations of these pathways affect the downstream effectors of
  EGFR/HER2 in a receptor-independent manner. The cross-talk at the effector level
  includes a variety of key molecules regulated by EGFR/HER2 signaling. These molecules
  directly regulate cell survival and growth, and their post-translational modifications
  are critical for cancer initiation, progression and drug sensitivity.
