caption: Metabolic pathways for synthesis of biodiesel. Microbes use sugars and other
  renewable feedstocks to produce a wide range of metabolites including ethanol, S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), and fatty acids. Fatty acid metabolism is used to produce long chain acyl-ACP
  thioesters where typically R = C15H31–C17H35. These acyl-chains which are natively
  incorporated into membrane lipids can be hydrolyzed by thioesterases (TE) to produce
  free fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs are the substrate of fatty acid O-methyltransferase
  (FAMT) which adds a methyl group from SAM to yield fatty acid methyl esters (FAME).
  Alternatively, FFA can be activated to acyl-CoA thioesters by acyl-CoA synthetases
  (ACoA Syn). These thioesters can be broken down for energy by the β-oxidation (β-ox)
  pathway that is often disrupted in engineered strains. Acyl-CoAs can be transesterified
  by wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (WS/DGAT) using ethanol
  to yield fatty acid ethyl-esters FAEE. The by-products (e.g. CoA and S-adenosyl-homocysteine)
  are recycled by additional pathways in the cell.
