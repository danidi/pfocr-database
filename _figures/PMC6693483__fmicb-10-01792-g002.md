caption: Basic schematic representation of the cAMP-PKA pathway (green) and three
  MAPK pathways in Candida albicans which are important for morphogenesis, adaptation
  to stress and survival. The cell integrity pathway (also known as PKC pathway) is
  depicted in orange, the HOG pathway is shown in blue and the CEK1 mediated pathway
  (also known as SVG pathway) is represented in purple. Pathways depicted here are
  an oversimplified version. A direct interaction between Msb2 and Cst20 () is for
  example not depicted here. For a more in depth overview see Refs. (; ; ; ; ; ).
  Notice also the arrow between Ste11 and Pbs2. In yeast the Sho1 branch plays a role
  in osmotic stress signaling to Hog1 (). However, in C. albicans this does not seem
  to be the case as Ssk2 is the only MAPKKK signaling to Hog1 (; ). Arrows in green
  depict physical interactions between two proteins that have already been demonstrated
  in C. albicans. Arrows in black are Protein-protein interactions not yet demonstrated
  in C. albicans. See text for more details.
