caption: The Nrf2 cytoprotective signaling pathway. This pathway regulates transcription
  of a variety of cellular defenses that bolster an organism’s response to stresses
  normally encountered during metabolism as well as protect against unexpected cellular
  insults from environmental toxins. Following its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic
  reticulum, Nrf2 may translocate directly into the nucleus (as indicated by the arrow)
  where it transactivates its target genes, thereby contributing to their constitutive
  expression. Steady state levels of Nrf2 are determined primarily through modulation
  of its continuous proteasomal degradation following ubiquitination by Cullin-3/Rbx1.
  Under homeostatic conditions Nrf2 is bound in the cytoplasm to Keap1 an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase substrate adaptor that targets Nrf2 for degradation. Under stressful conditions,
  conformational changes in Keap1 block the ubiquitylation of Nrf2, increasing both
  the half-life of Nrf2 and the size of the free Nrf2 pool, allowing more Nrf2 to
  translocate into the nucleus, bind to the ARE/EpRE and induce expression of a multitude
  of cytoprotective enzymes, including GSTs and NQO1 and those that increase GSH biosynthesis.
  Not surprisingly, depletion and deregulation of this pathway and or downstream components
  is implicated in diverse pathological conditions, many of which show increased incidence
  with age (e.g., diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration). We predict that this pathway
  is constitutively upregulated in longer-lived species.
