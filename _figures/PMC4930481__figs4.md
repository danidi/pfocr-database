caption: 'Schematic Representation of the Main Sinks for Biomass Precursor Metabolites
  in Central Carbon Metabolism, Related to 12 precursor metabolites in glycolysis,
  the PPP and the TCA cycle serve as metabolic branchpoints, in which flux branches
  out from central carbon metabolism to build the components of the cell’s biomass.
  We detail the percentage (by mass) contributed to the total of cellular carbon derived
  from each of these key metabolites (as calculated based on ). This serves as a basis
  for predicting the expected total labeled carbon fraction in the hemiautotrophic
  strain. In mutant E. coli lacking the phosphoglycerate mutase activity (gpmA, gpmM)
  central carbon metabolism is divided into two sub-networks disconnected in terms
  of carbon flow between them. Due to the cutoff, heterotrophic growth requires a
  minimum of two carbon sources: one feeding lower glycolysis and the TCA cycle (energy
  module, blue), while the other feeding upper glycolysis and the pentose phosphate
  pathway (CBB module, green). The relative percentage of the biomass emanating from
  precursor metabolites in the CBB module sums to approximately 30% of total biomass
  in the cell (or almost equivalently, carbon biomass), while the metabolites derived
  from the energy module contribute the remaining 70%. In evolved cells showing a
  hemiautotrophic phenotype, CO2 is the sole carbon input into the CBB module, hence
  about 30% of the cell’s carbon is expected to be supplied from RuBisCO-dependent
  assimilation of inorganic carbon.'
