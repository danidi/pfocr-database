caption: Proposed mechanism of IRE1-associated apoptosis and regulation of the same
  by P5. This figure illustrates the basic scheme of P5 control of IRE1 signaling,
  and also represents the key signaling events that are associated with constitutive
  IRE1 signaling in the presence of prolonged ER stress, or on depletion of P5. The
  mechanism of the P5/IRE1 interaction has been derived from the work of Eletto et
  al., published in 2014. All of the molecules have been labeled in the figure; the
  “P” represents phosphorylation of a given molecule within the pathway
