caption: The characteristics of cellular senescence. Cellular senescence is triggered
  by various stressors, such as irradiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), oncogene
  activation and telomere shortening. The senescent cells show increased expression
  of p16INK4a and/or p21WAF1/CIP1, senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  factors, DNA damage foci and senescence‐associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) formation.
  In addition, cell proliferation is inhibited and Lamin B1 expression is decreased.
  Senescent cell cycle arrest is induced by p16INK4a and/or by p21WAF1/CIP1
