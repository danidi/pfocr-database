caption: The core of the Frz system, such as chemotaxis pathways in enteric bacteria,
  consists of a receptor, FrzCD, a histidine kinase, FrzE, a CheW-like coupling protein
  FrzA and a dual response regulator protein, FrzZ (). MglA and MglB are downstream
  of the Frz pathway. The Frz pathway might act as a direct or indirect GEF of MglA
  and mediate the accumulation of GTP-bound MglA at the leading pole. MglB, acting
  as a GAP, inhibits MglA localization at the lagging pole by keeping the concentration
  of GTP-bound MglA very low at this site. The MglA GTPase activity is essential to
  establish the correct polar localization of RomR and PilT, but not AlgZ.  showed
  that in the absence of MglA, AglZ and FrzS are mislocalized (AglZ also signals directly
  to FrzCD). In the absence of MglA, activity cells still reverse, suggesting the
  presence of a yet unproved regulatory activity of the Frz pathway on MglA (dashed
  line) and the existence of an intrinsic reversal clock.
