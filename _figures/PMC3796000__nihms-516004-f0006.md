caption: '(A) Model; Top: A functionally conserved cassette of genes from Kib/Mer
  to Yki/Sd is re-wired for a context-specific purpose through changes in network-level
  feedback. Comparison of network-level feedback switch in Hippo pathway for growth
  vs. post-mitotic R8 fate. In growth control (left), at least four negative feedbacks
  onto Yki generate homeostatic regulation for Yki’s growth promoting function. In
  post-mitotic R8 fate specification, positive feedback onto Yki induces an all-or-nothing
  decision to become pR8 and express Rh5. Four tissue-specific transcription factors
  (red ovals), including the conserved Otd-Tj (OTX-NRL) module, are co-expressed only
  in R8 in the eye and generate the permissive context for a Wts-Yki-Melt regulatory
  circuit and Yki positive feedback. Gray ovals are Hippo growth pathway genes not
  involved in R8 subtype specification. Orange ovals are genes involved in both contexts.
  Yellow ovals are genes that create the R8 feedback mechanism, and are yellow in
  the growth pathway for comparison. Bottom: Effect of Hippo pathway regulatory interactions
  on network-level feedback onto Yki, in growth control (left; negative feedback)
  or post-mitotic neural differentiation (right, positive feedback).'
