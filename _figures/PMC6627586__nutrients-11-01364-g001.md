caption: Scheme of copper and silver distribution in a mammalian cell. Copper is taken
  up via copper transporter 1 (CTR1), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), or the
  putative transporter (all depicted as red circles). After being imported into the
  cell, the copper is transferred to chaperone antioxidant protein 1 (ATOX1), copper
  chaperone (CCS), and cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX17), which ferry it (black arrows)
  to both copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7A/B, blue) in the Golgi, to Cu, Zn-superoxide
  dismutase (SOD1, magenta) in the cytosol, and to cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX, green)
  in the mitochondria. Mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein (SLC25A3) transfers
  copper into the matrix. In the Golgi, ATP7A/B load Cu on newly synthesized cuproenzymes
  (orange circle), which transport it along the biosynthetic pathway (orange arrow).
  A significant increase in intracellular Cu induces the export of ATP7A/B (blue arrow)
  toward the post-Golgi compartments (TGN) and plasma membrane, where it drives the
  excretion of excessive Cu from the cell. Silver uses similar copper-transporting
  routes (solid black arrows). However, several copper-transporting pathways cannot
  be invaded by silver (dashed black arrows).
