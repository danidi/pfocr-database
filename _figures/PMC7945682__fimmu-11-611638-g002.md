caption: Summary of targets to generate Super-Treg. Foxp3 expression can be modulated
  at the epigenetic level. Demethylation of CpG dinucleotides at the FOXP3 locus by
  azacytidine or TET stabilizes FOXP3 expression, while remethylation at the upstream
  enhancer by IL-6 reduces FOXP3 expression (). Histone acetylation by HATs (p300,
  CBP) stabilizes FOXP3 expression by cooperating with key Treg transcription factors
  that act on the FOXP3 promoter, such as Runx1 and NFAT (). On the contrary, the
  histone HDAC SIRT-1 inhibits FOXP3 transcription and its deletion promotes Treg
  function (). Treg stability is also maintained in inflammatory environments by CBP
  and P300 interaction with the Foxp3 CNS2 region, through which CBP is able to regulate
  pCREB and P300 to regulate expression of GATA3 (, ). Histone deubiquitination by
  Usp22 and Atxn7l3 promotes FOXP3 expression, contrary to CHIP1 and DBC1. Chromatin
  remodeling by BRD9, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, positively
  regulates FOXP3 as BRD9 depletion reduces the binding of FOXP3 to its enhancers
  CNS2/CNS0, thereby reducing FOXP3 expression (). BRD9 also regulates a subset of
  FOXP3 target genes by promoting both FOXP3 binding at their regulatory element and
  increasing histone modifications. Knockdown of BRD9 thereby compromises FOXP3 expression
  and Treg function in vitro and in vivo (). Thus, BRD9 overexpression could be interesting
  in Treg. Transcription factor AHR can trigger the differentiation of Treg by the
  expression of FOXP3 when activated in response to dioxin, whereas carbazole induces
  Th17 cell development (). FOXP3 expression can also be regulated at the post translational
  level. Acetylation by p300 and CBP stabilizes FOXP3 protein, while deacetylation
  by CHIP1, DBC1, or HDAC7 induces degradation of the protein, which can be inhibited
  by HDAC inhibitors, Usp22 and Atxn7l3. Glycolysis can be privileged. HIF1α binds
  to the promoter of RORγt, resulting in expression of IL-17 which drives Th17 cell
  differentiation () and reducing Treg stability through the production of IFN‐γ ().
  HIF1α also increases glycolysis by upregulating GLUT1, and promotes FOXP3 ubiquitination.
  LKB1 and TCAIM () promoting glycolysis are promising candidates for consideration.
  CD39 participates in tolerance induction in kidney grafts () and the effector memory
  Treg subset mainly expressing CD39 is diminished in multiple sclerosis (). CD39
  and CD73 transform ATP in adenosine acting through A2AR, which is limited by ATP
  uptake by P2X7. Function and migration can be controlled. Antigen specificity of
  Tregs can be modified by inserting genes encoding for an ectopic TCR or a chimeric
  antigen receptor preferentially in the TRAC locus. The control of rogue Super-Treg
  could include potent immunosuppressive drug regimens but they require hours to days
  for elimination. Recently, the small molecule tyrosine inhibitor dasatinib was shown
  to be a fast and potent inhibitor of CAR signaling in Tconv and may also be applicable
  to Treg platforms (). Allogeneic Tregs present advantages regarding production but
  allogeneic MHC molecules have to be KO and counterbalanced by HLA-E and CD47 (“do
  not eat me” molecules). The expression of cytokines known to be responsible for
  Treg function such as IL-10, TGFβ, IL-34, IL-35, and FGL-2 can be upregulated. Treg-mediated
  toxicity can be controlled by insertion of suicide genes, such as a truncated version
  of the epidermal growth factor receptor recognized by the mAb cetuximab (), or the
  peptide RQR8 combining epitopes recognized by the mAb rituximab () or by dimerization
  of Casp9 by the small molecule rimiducid (). Tregs can be tracked using deuterium
  and NIS. Proliferation and survival can be promoted. Folic acid is suggested to
  upregulate the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-xL via folic acid receptor
  4 (FR4) in Treg (). Hence, increased expression of FR4 or enzymes of this pathway
  such as dihydrofolate reductase in Treg may preferentially preserve these cells.
  IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 signals are important for survival and proliferation of Tregs.
  To make Treg independent of exogenous IL-2, they could be armed with their own IL-2
  for self-supply. PD1 and CTLA-4 have both important roles for Treg function and
  survival and LRBA, in contrast to PIM, is important for CTLA-4 expression. Drug
  resistance could also be considered for promoting Treg survival.
