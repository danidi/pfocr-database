caption: Potential strategies of the different HCV proteins to antagonize IFN therapy.
  (A) IFN resistance through inhibition of RIG-I and TLR3 by the HCV NS3/4A protein.
  Viral RNA binding to RIG-I and TLR3 leads to the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB. Both
  transcription factors enter the nucleus and bind to target genes, resulting in the
  expression of antiviral defense proteins. The NS3/4A protein disrupts the activation
  of IRF3 and NF-κB by the inactivation of Cardif, which is an adaptor protein in
  the RIG-I antiviral pathway, and through inhibition of Trif, an adaptor molecule
  in the TLR3 signaling pathway. (B) Disruption of the IFN-mediated Jak/STAT pathway.
  IFN binding to its receptor triggers the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues
  through the Tyk2 and Jak1 kinases, which function as docking sites for STAT1 and
  STAT2. The subsequent phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 promotes the formation
  of heterodimers between STAT1 and STAT2 and the assembly of the trimeric ISGF3 complex.
  After translocation of the ISGF3 complex to the cell nucleus, it binds to the IFN-stimulated
  response element (ISRE) in ISG promoters, leading to the expression of IFN effector
  proteins. The HCV core protein induces the expression of SOCs, which block Jak/STAT
  signaling through the IFN-α/β receptor. The HCV NS5A protein induces the expression
  of IL-8, which blocks the assembly and function of the ISGF3 complex. The expression
  of the whole HCV polyprotein inhibits STAT1 function through elevated levels of
  PP2A, which is associated with an increased binding of STAT1 to PIAS and a reduced
  activation of ISGs. (C) IFN resistance through inhibition of PKR by the HCV E2 and
  HCV NS5A proteins. After IFN-α binding, autophosphorylation of PKR takes place,
  leading to the inhibition of the phosphorylation of eIF-2α, which is responsible
  for the initiation of translation of cellular and viral proteins by facilitating
  Met-tRNA binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. HCV E2 and HCV NS5A antagonize the
  effects of IFN-α by the inhibition of PKR.
