caption: The proposed model for regulation and function of ENA1 and NHA1 in C. neoformans.
  Under cation shock and high pH, ENA1 expression is controlled by diverse signaling
  proteins. ENA1 is positively and negatively regulated by Rim101 and Nrg1 proteins,
  respectively. However, it is unclear whether Rim101 controls expression of ENA1
  through the Nrg1 repressor protein. Hog1 appears to positively regulate ENA1 expression,
  partly through the Atf1 transcription factor. It is possible that Hog1 controls
  the Rim101 pathway directly or indirectly to regulate ENA1 expression. Upon Na+/K+
  shock, NHA1 expression is induced in a Hog1-dependent manner. Under osmotic shock,
  such as high sorbitol addition, NHA1 is induced in a Hog1-independent manner. Under
  K+ shock, Rim101 positively regulated mRNA levels of NHA1. However, it remains unclear
  whether the Ena1-dependent regulation of NHA1 is mediated via the Nrg1 repressor.
  In C. neoformans, Ena1 plays a major role in toxic ion (Li+ and Na+) and K+ homeostasis
  as well as high pH adaptation whereas CnNha1 is involved in K+ homeostasis and low
  pH adaptation. Furthermore, Ena1 and Nha1 play redundant roles in negatively regulating
  production of melanin and capsule.
