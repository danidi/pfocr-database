caption: 'Exposure to drugs of abuse results in epigenetic alterations throughout
  the brain reward circuitry. The major brain regions involved in mesolimbic reward
  pathway are depicted in the rodent brain: dopaminergic neurons (green) in the ventral
  tegmental area (VTA) project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex (PFC),
  amygdala (AMY) and hippocampus (HPC). The NAc also receives glutamatergic (red)
  innervation from the PFC, AMY and HPC. While the mechanisms of action are specific
  for each drug, most drugs of abuse increase dopaminergic signaling from VTA to other
  regions of the reward circuitry. Many studies investigating epigenetic mechanisms
  of addiction have focused on the NAc as it is a major region of integration for
  rewarding stimuli. Modified from []with permission.'
