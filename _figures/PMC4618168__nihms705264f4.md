caption: Following racemization and formation of (R) 2-keto-3-methylvalerate, branched
  chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase catalyzes formation of (R) 2-methylbutyryl CoA.
  Metabolism of this substrate using successive valine pathway enzymes yields 2-EHA,
  which is excreted in urine (see arrow). While evidence suggests 3-OH isobutyrate
  dehydrogenase may reversibly form the corresponding semialdehyde, this product is
  able to revert to 2-EHA. Unknown (see “?”) is whether any fraction of ethylmalonate
  semialdehyde is converted to butyryl CoA via methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase.
  * depicts a chiral center.
