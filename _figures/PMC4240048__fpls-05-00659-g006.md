caption: Model for injury-induced signaling in Trichoderma atroviride. Broken hyphae
  release ATP as a signal molecule. ATP is perceived by a putative G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR) activating the Tmk1 and Tmk3 MAPK pathways (highlighted by red arrows).
  Activation of the GPCR turns on the Cdc42 GTPase in coordination with an increase
  of Nox1-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Cdc42 may in turn activate
  the Ste20 MAPK pathway, leading to Tmk1 phosphorylation. In a parallel pathway increases
  in intracellular calcium and CamK kinases, regulate targets required for the damage
  response. Calcium influx may also lead to changes in membrane potential (Vm) and/or
  directly activate the Rac GTPase component of the NADPH oxidase (Nox1/NoxR) complex,
  generating . A superoxide dismutase (Sod) converts  into H2O2 that can diffuse into
  the cell, activating the Ste11 MAPK pathway, leading to Tmk3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation
  of Tmk1 and/or Tmk3 results in the activation of the developmental program that
  results in the formation conidia.
