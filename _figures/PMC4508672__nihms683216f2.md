caption: 'During infection, HSV-1 inhibits phosphorylation of RPA32 S4/S8 by degrading
  or inhibiting DNA-PKcs in an ICP0-dependent fashion [,,]. Although ATM, NBS1 and
  CHK2 are phosphorylated during infection, the HR pathway is inhibited due to ICP0-dependent
  degradation of RNF8 and RNF168 [,,,]. ATR/ATRIP phosphorylation of CHK1 S345 and
  RPA32 S33 is inhibited; however, FANCD2 is activated by ubiquitination during HSV-1
  infection [,,]. Asterisk (*) indicates proteins that are degraded by ICP0.DNA-PKcs:
  DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; HR: Homologous recombination.'
