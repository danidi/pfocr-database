caption: Renal diseases. (A) Networks display DEGs which is upregulated (red) and
  downregulated (green) genes involved in damage of kidney in T2DM based on the multiple
  corrections of the log P value. The deep orange arrow indicates the prediction of
  an increase of activation, yellow arrow indicates a decreased prediction of activation,
  and grey arrow could affect. IL6, ICAM1, GC, CFB, C4A/C4B, AGT, and TNF increase
  the prediction of kidney damage. (C), Causative and (CO), correlation relationships.
  (B) Network displays the role of acute inflammatory response pathway and cascade
  involving TNF and IL6 as an upstream regulator which affects the upstream transcription
  regulators; NFKB and NF-IL6 and kinases such as c-jun, and c-fos, which affects
  downstream targets related to damage of kidneys such as IL6, ICAM1, GC, CFB, C4A/C4B,
  AGT, and TNF which increase prediction of kidney damage.
