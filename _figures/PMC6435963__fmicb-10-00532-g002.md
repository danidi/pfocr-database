caption: Regulation of complement activation by RCAs or parasite-expressed proteins
  targeting different complement components at the different steps of complement activation.
  Proteins showed in the blue boxes are human complement regulatory proteins. Proteins
  showed in the red boxes are parasites-generated to inhibit complement activation.
  (A) At the initiation step, C1 inhibitor binds to the active enzymes C1r/s and MASP-2
  and dissociates them from C1q and MBL, respectively. Calreticulin, paramyosin, SMIPP-Ss,
  and N- and O-glycosylated molecules expressed by parasitic protozoa or helminths
  bind to C1q, MBL and ficolins to inhibit initiation of the classical and lectin
  pathway. (B) C3 convertase (C3bBb) undergoes an accelerated decay mediated by complement
  receptor 1 (CR1), decay accelerating factor (DAF), C4b-binding protein (C4BP) or
  factor H (FH). C3b is inactivated to iC3b by factor I (FI) with cofactor CR1, FH,
  C4BP or membrane cofactor protein (MCP). GP63 expressed by Leishmania binds to C3
  leading to proteolysis of the active component C3b to form the inactive iC3b, thus
  preventing the formation of C3-convertase. GP58/68 expressed by T. cruzi binds with
  FB and interferes the formation of C3 convertase to inhibit alternative pathway.
  (C) Under normal conditions, CD59, S-protein (vitronectin), and Clusterin (SP-40)
  prevent the formation of the MAC. Paramyosin generated by helminth like T. spiralis
  bind with C8 and C9 to inhibit the formation of MAC.
