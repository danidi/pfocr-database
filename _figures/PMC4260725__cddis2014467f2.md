caption: The major signaling pathway regulation and core machinery of autophagy. Various
  pathways regulate autophagy either positively or negatively. Most of these pathways,
  including AMPK and PKA, merge at mTORC1. PKA directly activates mTORC1, inactivating
  both AMPK and autophagy. AMPK negatively regulates mTORC1 in two ways, either directly
  or by activating the TSC2 protein. The mTORC1 substrate p70S6K is a positive regulator
  of autophagy. Another important upstream factor is Akt/PKB, a negative regulator
  of the TSC1/2 complex. The core machinery includes the processes of induction, phagophore
  assembly (membrane nucleation), sequestration, autophagosome formation, and autophagolysosome
  formation. The process of induction involves initiation of the UNC-51-like kinase
  complex members ULK 1/2, Atg13, Atg101, and FIP200. Activation of the PtdIns3K complex
  (Beclin-1, Vps34, and Vps15) is an essential step in phagophore assembly (membrane
  nucleation). The E1-like enzyme Atg7 activates both Atg12 and LC3-I, and the E2-like
  enzyme activates Atg10 (for Atg12) and Atg3 (for LC3-I). Atg12 is conjugated to
  Atg5 and the Atg12-Atg5 complex acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to catalyze the conjugation
  of LC3-I to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the process of sequestration.
  The subsequent autophagosome formation is dependent on the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex.
  After autophagosome completion, the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex dissociates from autophagosomes
  to allow Atg4 access to LC3-II-PE for deconjugation. When the autophagosome is completed,
  it fuses with lysosome to form an autophagolysosome in which the cytosolic macromolecules,
  proteins, and organelles will either be degraded by acid hydrolases in what is known
  as type II programmed cell death or involved in a survival mechanism to be released
  back into the cytosol with the help of permeases against cellular stress. Akt/PKB,
