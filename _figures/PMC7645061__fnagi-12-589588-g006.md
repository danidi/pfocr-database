caption: KEGG enrichment analysis of the quercetin target genes. (A) KEGG annotation
  of target genes. The number of genes enriched in each KEGG term is shown as the
  circle size, the p-value shown as different colors. (B) The important genes were
  mainly distributed in the PI3K–AKT signaling pathway. Arrows represent activation
  effect, T-arrows represent inhibition effect and segments show activation effect
  or inhibition effect. The red nodes are the intersection genes.
