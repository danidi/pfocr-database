caption: Antibody-mediated blockade of the PS signaling pathway in the tumor microenvironment.
  As described in the text, PS is highly dysregulated in the tumor microenvironment
  by the combined action of a oxidative stress and immature tumor vasculature, the
  secretion of PS-positive tumor exosomes, and the high apoptotic index of proliferating
  tumors. PS-targeting antibodies are thought to bind externalized PS and interfere
  with the inhibitory functions of PS in the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting
  PS binding to PS receptors and by Fcγ-mediated ADCC. The net effect is to activate
  immunogenic signals in the tumor microenvironment
