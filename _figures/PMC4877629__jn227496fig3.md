caption: Genetic networks generated from the differentially expressed genes from adipose
  tissues of mice fed a LF or a HF diet for 12 wk. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis–generated
  networks of genes associated with Itgax signaling in subcutaneous (A), mesenteric
  (B), and epididymal (C) adipose tissue are shown. The solid and dotted lines between
  genes represent a direct and indirect relation, respectively. The intensity of the
  node color indicates the expression level of genes, with red representing upregulation
  and green downregulation in the HF group relative to the LF group (n = 5 mice/group).

  description: Genetic networks generated from the differentially expressed genes
    from adipose tissues of mice fed a LF or a HF diet for 12 wk. The Ingenuity Pathway
    Analysis–generated networks of genes associated with Itgax signaling in subcutaneous
    (A), mesenteric (B), and epididymal (C) adipose tissue are shown. The solid and
    dotted lines between genes represent a direct and indirect relation, respectively.
    The intensity of the node color indicates the expression level of genes, with
    red representing upregulation and green downregulation in the HF group relative
    to the LF group (n = 5 mice/group). Asterisks (*) indicate the multiple identifiers
    in the dataset file map to a single change in the IPA Global Molecular Network.
