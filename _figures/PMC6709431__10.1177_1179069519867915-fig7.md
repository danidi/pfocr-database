caption: The molecular mechanism of ZPR1-dependent neurodegeneration. Graphical summary
  and the molecular mechanism of activation of the JNK signaling pathway in ZPR1-deficient
  neurons that mediates neurodegeneration. Patients with SMA express the low levels
  of ZPR1. Reduced levels of ZPR1 cause motor neuron degeneration and increase severity
  of disease in mice with SMA. SMA is characterized by degeneration of spinal motor
  neurons caused by chronic low levels of SMN. ZPR1 knockdown results in activation
  of the JNK signaling pathway MLK3 → MKK7 → JNK3 that mediates phosphorylation of
  c-Jun, release of Cytochrome C (Cyto C), and activation of caspase 3 (Casp3), which
  leads to axonal degeneration and caspase-mediated apoptotic death of neurons. Neuron-specific
  isoform JNK3 was identified to mediate degeneration of ZPR1-deficient neurons. Genetic
  inhibition of the JNK pathway by the Jnk3 gene knockout reduces/prevents degeneration
  of neurons. Pharmacologic inhibition of JNK using JNK inhibitor compound SP600125
  reduces degeneration of ZPR1-deficient neurons and provide neuroprotection. Solid
  arrows (upward) show increase in phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases.
  JNK indicates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SMA, spinal
  muscular atrophy; SMN, survival motor neuron.
