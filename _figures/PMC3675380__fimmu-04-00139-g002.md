caption: Model of synergy between TCR/CD28 and TNFR signalosomes for activation of
  the PI3K-Akt pathway in T cells. T cells are activated firstly by recognition of
  antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex when it is displayed by the major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The second
  co-stimulatory signal is delivered through CD28 by interaction with its ligands
  CD80 and/or CD86. These combined signals can activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K), which leads to conversion of PIP2 into PIP3 at the plasma membrane. The
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing proteins, Akt (protein kinase B) and
  phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), are recruited to the membrane PIP3,
  and then Akt is phosphorylated by PDK1 and by the mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 2 (mTORC2). This promotes translocation of Akt from membrane to cytosol,
  thereby allowing regulation of downstream pathways through phosphorylation of target
  molecules, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), forkhead box O (Foxo), and
  IκB kinase (IKK). Akt phosphorylates and inactivates two negative regulators of
  mTORC1, tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) and proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa
  (PRAS40), which results in activation of mTORC1. Akt contributes to NF-κB activation
  through phosphorylation of IKK and interaction with protein kinase C θ (PKCθ) or
  caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein
  1 (CARMA1). After recognition of trimeric TNF ligand superfamily (TNFSF) molecules
  on APCs, TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) molecules on T cells are trimerized and
  oligomerized and recruit trimeric TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) to their cytoplasmic
  TRAF-binding motifs. The TNFSF-TNFRSF complex then translocates into detergent-insoluble
  membrane lipid microdomains (DIM). The TNFRSF-TRAF superclusters recruit and allow
  the efficient accumulation of PI3K and Akt in concentrated depots in close proximity
  to the TCR/CD28 signalosome, which results in a quantitative contribution of TNFR
  signalosomes to enhancing and sustaining PI3K and Akt activation triggered by the
  TCR/CD28 signalosome. The TNFR signalosomes also can promote activation of NF-κB
  irrespective of TCR/CD28 signaling. Red lines show activating signals, blue lines
  show inhibitory signals.
