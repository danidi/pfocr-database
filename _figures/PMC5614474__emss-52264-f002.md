caption: 'Multiple and bidirectional connections between actin dynamics and endocytosis.
  A: endocytosis and recycling harness actin dynamics. Macropinocytosis, phagocytosis,
  and most forms of NCE are dependent on actin dynamics. The requirement for actin
  polymerization in CME in mammalian cells is less well established. However, recent
  evidence, mainly obtained using advanced live imaging, has shown that actin and
  actin regulatory proteins are invariably recruited along each of the various steps
  of CME and that they mediate key events in the transport and motility of endosomal
  vesicles. The initial curvature (a) of the PM is generated by the assembly of clathrin
  coats and additional endocytic proteins (not shown), such as F-BAR-containing membrane
  deforming proteins. As invagination proceeds (b), changes in curvature may be sensed
  by other BAR-domain-containing proteins that cooperate with the large GTPase dynamin
  (not shown) and actin polymerization regulatory factors to promote neck formation
  (c), which precedes vesicle scission (d). Proteins of the endocytic coat (not shown)
  may directly link the membrane to the actin network. Actin polymerization may generate
  the force necessary to promote pit invagination into the cell, until dynamin-mediated
  scission occurs. Alternatively, an actin shell that nucleates along the sides of
  invaginating membrane tubules may cause membrane reorganization, lipid domain repartition,
  and line tension, aiding dynamin-dependent scission. Actin is also involved in vesicle
  motility and trafficking inside the cells (d) and has recently been shown to influence
  cargo sorting (e). This is the case for β2ARs that generate endosomal, actin-coated,
  subdomains by recruiting actin regulatory factors through their PDZ-interacting
  motives. This provides a physical basis for sequence-dependent sorting of internalized
  membrane proteins from distinct domains within the same endosome, enabling separation
  and diversification between bulk [here, represented by TFR recycling (f)] and sequence-dependent
  (β2AR), actin-mediated recycling to the PM (e). Thus actin may be crucial not only
  for endosomal motility, but also for cargo-mediated regulation of receptor recycling.
  B: endocytosis and recycling control actin dynamics-based migration. Coordination
  between membrane traffic, cell substrate adhesion, and actin remodeling is required
  to generate and spatially confine the forces responsible for the formation of polarized
  cell protrusions, such as lamellipodia and circular dorsal ruffles (CDR). Two endocytic/signaling
  networks implicated in polarized migration are shown. In the first one (g–h), in
  response to stimulation of RTKs, such as HGF stimulation of the MET receptor, CME
  and RAB5 activation promote the internalization of RAC and its GEF, TIAM1, into
  early endosomes (g). Activated GTP-bound RAC is subsequently recycled through the
  ARF6 endosomal pathway (h) to confined PM regions, where actin polymerization supports
  the formation of CDR, a step that occurs prior to the extension of migratory protrusions.
  In the second network (n–o), the trafficking of integrins, through CME and raft-dependent
  NCE, enables sustained and polarized integrin signaling to lamellipodia as well
  as precise coordination of integrin activity with the changing dynamics of focal
  adhesions. Integrins, such as α5β1, are continuously internalized (i) and recycled
  to the PM, through RAB25-endosomes that are compartmentalized at the leading edge
  of cells for lamellipodial extension. Coordination of integrin adhesion and lipid
  raft endocytosis and recycling is also crucial to integrate RAC and integrin activation
  (j). Lipid rafts are endocytosed through caveolin-1 (CAV1)-containing caveolae (j).
  Lipid rafts are also binding sites for RAC (k). Integrin signaling blocks lipid
  raft internalization by promoting CAV1 phosphorylation and its retention in focal
  adhesions at the PM (l). Thus, when integrins are engaged by the ECM, RAC binding
  sites at the PM become available. On the contrary, cell detachment abrogates integrin
  activation and extinguishes RAC signaling at the PM, by enabling the relocalization
  and subsequent caveolae-mediated internalization of CAV1 and lipid rafts. Recycling
  of CAV1 (m), as well as of RAC (h) and integrins may be coordinated by ARF6. Mature,
  integrin-containing focal adhesions at the rear of the cells need to be disassembled
  to enable effective cell locomotion. This process involves dynamin and CME (n).
  Finally, internalized integrin, bound to ECM ligands such as fibronectin (FN), may
  be specifically directed to lysosomes for degradation, through a mechanism involving
  integrin ubiquitination and recognition by the ESCRT machinery (o). Cells expressing
  a ubiquitination-deficient α5β1-integrin mutant are impaired in cell migration,
  suggesting that FN-integrin complex turnover is essential for locomotion.'
