caption: Model of the photorespiration pathway with link to TCA cycle and glycolysis
  for the dysfunctional metabolic flux for PEX10-ΔZn1 mutants compared with WT plants.
  Identified significant reductions or accumulations are marked with red (reduced)
  or blue (accumulated) arrows. The localization of the measured metabolites is postulated
  because of the metabolic profiling performed without regard to compartmentalization
  of the cell.
