caption: Model for the mechanism of regulation of PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation and
  activation by LAT. CRP binding to GPVI triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the
  FcR γ-chain, allowing recruitment of Syk and its activation. Syk phosphorylates
  LAT and SLP-76 via independent pathways. LAT is proposed to recruit PLCγ2 to the
  membrane through its C-terminal SH2 domain (). LAT also associates with the p85
  subunit of PI 3-kinase, leading to the formation of PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which
  is also required for recruitment of PLCγ2 (). SLP-76 is proposed to recruit the
  Src kinase Fyn or Lyn to PLCγ2, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation. A separate
  pool of LAT is proposed to associate with SLP-76 via Grb2 and may be involved in
  the regulation of the Rho/Rac signalling pathways (). This pathway gives rise to
  a minor route of phosphorylation of SLP-76 but not PLCγ2. PH, pleckstrin homology
  domain; PIP3, PI-3,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, PI-4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate;
  DAG, diacylglycerol, PKC, protein kinase C.
