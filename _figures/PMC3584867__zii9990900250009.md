caption: Schematic representation of the multiple functions of PE. (Left) H. influenzae
  PE interacts with the host epithelium. The PE molecule mediates binding to the epithelial
  surface utilizing a hitherto unknown receptor. This interaction contributes to bacterial
  adhesion and induction of a proinflammatory response by the epithelial cells. PE
  binds to Ln, which contributes to adhesion of H. influenzae to the basement membrane
  and the host ECM. In addition to Ln, H. influenzae binds plasminogen by using PE.
  When plasminogen is bound to PE, it is converted into active plasmin by host urokinase
  plasminogen activator (uPA) or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Active plasmin
  may help in bacterial invasion and degradation of the ECM. (Right) PE inhibits the
  MAC at the surface of H. influenzae, which is accomplished by the binding of Vn.
  Vitronectin is a well-known complement regulator that inhibits the terminal complement
  pathway by interacting with the C5b-7 complex assembly and also inhibits C9 polymerization
  during formation of a lytic pore. PE is able to bind both Ln and Vn at the same
  time, and the two ligands do not interfere with each other; thus, adhesion and MAC
  inhibition can be carried out simultaneously.
