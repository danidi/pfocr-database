caption: 'Linear and cyclic ornithine synthesis pathways linked to the arginine metabolic
  pathway in plants. Arg biosynthesis is divided into two parts and nine discrete
  steps. In the first part of the pathway, Orn is synthesized from glutamate (Glu),
  and in the second part, Arg is synthesized from Orn. The first four steps are distinct
  from the Orn pathway, while the fifth and sixth steps, known as the cyclic and linear
  pathways, respectively, are also included in the Orn pathway but take different
  routes. The last three steps (second part) are known as the Arg pathway, which is
  illustrated in . NGS2: N-acetylglutamine synthase; NAGK: N-acetyl glutamate kinase;
  NAGPR: N-acetylglutamate-5-phosphate reductase; NAOAT: N-acetylornithine aminotransferase;
  NAOGAcT: N-acetylornithine-glutamate acetyltransferase; NAGK/PII (a plastid localized
  protein) double-headed arrow: regulatory interaction between the NAGK and PII proteins;
  NAOD: N-acetylornithine deacetylase.'
