caption: Upon ligand binding (parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related
  protein (PTHrP) are shown on the figure), the G protein coupled PTH/PTHrP receptor
  type 1 (PTHR1) activates the heterotrimeric Gs protein. The Gsα subunit triggers
  the activation of adenylyl cyclase, which leads to cAMP synthesis. cAMP then binds
  to the regulatory 1A subunits (R) of protein kinase A (PKA), the predominant effector
  of cAMP. Upon cAMP binding, the catalytic subunits (C) dissociate from the R subunits
  and phosphorylate numerous target proteins, including cAMP-responsive binding elements
  (CREB) and the phosphodiesterases (PDEs; such as PDE3A and PDE4D). CREB activates
  the transcription of cAMP-responsive genes. Intracellular cAMP is then deactivated
  by PDEs, including PDE4D and PDE3A. The main clinical features of pseudohypoparathyroidism
  (PHP) and related disorders are due to molecular defects within the PTH–PTHrP signalling
  pathway, with the exception, perhaps, of ectopic ossification. The diseases caused
  by alterations in the genes that encode the indicated proteins are shown in blue
  boxes. Differential diagnoses are shown in grey boxes. CRE, cAMP response element;
  HDAC4, histone deacetylase 4; G protein, trimer α, β and γ; HTNB, autosomal dominant
  hypertension and brachydactyly type E syndrome; PHP, pseudohypoparathyroidism; PHP1A,
  pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A; PHP1B, pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B; PHP1C,
  pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1C; POH, progressive osseous heteroplasia; PPHP, pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism;
