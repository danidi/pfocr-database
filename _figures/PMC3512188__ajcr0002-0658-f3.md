caption: The roles of miRNAs in DNA damage response. A. Direct regulation. Nearly
  all primary components of the DDR signaling pathway are subjected to miRNAs-mediated
  gene silencing during DNA damage, including sensors or mediators of damage, signal
  transducers and effectors. B. Indirect regulation. miRNAs exert their functions
  by fine-tuning the expression of critical components of the DNA damage response
  indirectly, such as p53, which was subjected to indirect regulation by miRNAs via
  down-regulation of upstream regulators of p53.
