caption: Influence of PM10 exposure on coagulation. a Investigation of whether the
  five validated miRNAs mediate the association between PM10 concentration (y-axis)
  and fibrinogen level (x-axis). β, coefficient of the independent variable when regressing
  the mediator on the independent variable; γ, coefficient of the mediator when regressing
  the dependent variable on both the independent variable and the mediator. An indirect
  effect (IE) represents the “mediated effect” through the five validated miRNAs.
  Estimates correspond to 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration. Results from regression
  models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and apparent temperature.
  b Coagulation cascade. For each gene reported in the pathway, the possible regulatory
  role of each miRNA is reported
