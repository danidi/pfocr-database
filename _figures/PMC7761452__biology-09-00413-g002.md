  description: Metazoan MOB proteins present extensive regulation between isotypes.
    The canonical Hippo pathway is activated by upstream signals resulting in MST1/2
    phosphorylation (which may be mediated by SAV1) and MOB1-LATS1/2 activation, causing
    YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and cytoplasm retention. The lack of YAP/TAZ transcriptional
    signaling results in a tumor suppressing effect. However, MOB proteins present
    several activities beyond canonical Hippo signaling. These include non-canonical
    Hippo signaling through different interactions with GCKII STE20 or NDR kinases,
    direct MOB stimulation by upstream signals and direct stimulation by MOBs of non-Hippo
    proteins. This intricate network results in direct and indirect MOB to MOB regulation.
    PLK1 regulates mitotic spindle orientation through NDR1 phosphorylation which
    results in NDR1 binding shifting from MOB1 to MOB2, favoring canonical Hippo activation
    []. NDR1/2 also regulate P21 and RABIN8 [,]. MOB3 is a MOB1 antagonist by inhibiting
    MST1 []. MOB4/Phocein-MST4, part of the STRIPAK complex, also antagonizes MOB1,
    by disrupting MOB1-MST1/1 binding []. MOB1 interacts in a HsMOB1-PPP6R1/2/3-ANKRD28
    complex which appears to inhibit MOB1 mediated Hippo activation and in a DOCK6/7/8-CRLF3-LRCH3/4
    complex, in a phosphorylation dependent manner [,]. Both PP6 phosphatase and DOCK6-8
    promote actin cytoskeleton polarization signaling via RAC1. The FERMT2-PRAJA2
    complex inhibits Hippo signaling by promoting MOB1 ubiquitin-proteasome degradation
    []. MOB1 is stimulated by GSK3β, a signaling hub involved in Wnt, mTOR, and Notch
    signaling []. MOB2 interacts with RAD50 stimulating the DNA damage response [].
    MOB2-SAV1 interaction was detected in G. gallus []. Notably, PP6, DOCK6, FERMT2
    and GSK3 are proteins involved in cell-cell junctions. Colored boxes represent

    Protein complexes are identified by an interrupted box with dashes and dots lines.
    Arrows represent activation while dashes represent inhibition. Lack of arrow or
