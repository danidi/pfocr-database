caption: 'Schematic of the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway. Paclitaxel is synthesized
  by the combination of the core taxane and the side chain. The core taxane structure
  is synthesized by the modification of the taxadiene, which is produced by the cyclization
  of GGPP. The solid arrows in the pink background mean the steps with known reactions
  and known enzymes. The solid arrows in the light blue background mean the steps
  with known reactions but unknown enzymes. The dotted arrows mean the steps with
  unknown reactions and known enzymes. FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate. TDC1, Taxadiene synthase; CYP725A2: taxane 13 alpha-hydroxylase;
  CYP725A1, taxane 10 beta-hydroxylase; TBT, taxoid 2a-O-benzoyl transferase; DBAT,
  10-deacetylbaccatin III 10-O-acetyltransferase; PAM, phenylalanine aminomutase.'
