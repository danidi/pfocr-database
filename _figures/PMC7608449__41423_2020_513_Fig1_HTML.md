caption: Ionizing radiation (IR) induces genomic and mitochondrial DNA damage and
  activates the apoptosis program in tumor cells. In the presence of a caspase inhibitor
  (emricasan), the activity of caspase 9 (Casp9), a key component of the mitochondrion-triggered
  intrinsic pathway, is suppressed, and tumor cells can sense fragmented DNA. Tumor
  cells are induced to produce type I interferon (IFN-I), which activates innate and
  adaptive immune cells. Tumor cells also react to IFN-I by upregulating PD-L1, a
  ligand for the immune checkpoint PD-1 that negatively controls immune responses
  and limits the action of tumor-antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Systemic
  administration of an anti-PD-L1 antibody, intratumor administration of emricasan
  and local radiotherapy synergize to induce an effective systemic antitumor response
  able to control primary and secondary tumor growth through a CD8 T-cell-dependent
  abscopal effect.
