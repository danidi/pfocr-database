caption: Proposed model for an IR-induced signaling pathway. Chromatin structure changes
  caused by DNA breakage or other mechanisms leads to intermolecular autophosphorylation
  of ATM dimers, resulting in release of phosphorylated and active ATM monomers. If
  DNA-strand breaks are present, several proteins, including NBS1 and BRCA1, are recruited
  to the sites of the breaks independent of the ATM activation process. After activation,
  monomeric ATM can phosphorylate nucleoplasmic substrates, like p53, and if NBS1
  and BRCA1 have localized to DNA breaks, activated ATM is recruited to the break.
  At the DNA break, activated ATM can phosphorylate substrates, including SMC1. The
  phosphorylation of SMC1 reduces chromosomal breakage and enhances cell survival.
