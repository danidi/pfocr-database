caption: Protein-protein interaction network of NFY and associated genes. Yellow,
  green and pink nodes are NFY genes, genes correlated with NFY and mevalonate pathway
  genes, and genes with known protein-protein interactions with NFY genes or NFY-correlated
  genes. Red round rectangles are ‘hub’ genes (please see the main text). The red
  circles are subnets 1 and 2; these are shown on a larger scale in  and , respectively.
