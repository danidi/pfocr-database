caption: 'Beneficial effects of immunobiotics on the antiviral innate immune response
  against rotavirus in bovine intestinal epithelial (BIE) cells. Rotavirus doublestranded
  genomic RNA activates toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid inducible gene-I
  (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5), which are pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed in IECs. Cellular signaling cascades mediated
  by interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) upregulate the expression of type
  I (IFN-α, IFN-β), and type III (IFNλ1, IFNλ2/3) IFN, which in turn induces the synthesis
  of IFN-stimulated genes with antiviral activities including: myxovirus resistance
  1 IFN-inducible protein (Mx1), MxA, ribonuclease L (RNaseL), 2′-5′-oligoadenylate
  synthetase (OAS), and protein kinase R (PKR). Antiviral PRRs also activate nuclear
  factor κB (NF-κB) pathway and induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines including: interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein
  1 (MCP-1/CCL2), and IFN gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10). Preventive treatment
  of BIE cells with immunobiotics increase the activation of IRF3, improve the production
  of the antiviral factors and differentially regulate the expression of inflammatory
  mediators.'
