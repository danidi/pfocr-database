caption: 'The mammalian N-end rule pathway.,,, N-terminal residues are indicated by
  single-letter abbreviations for amino acids. A yellow oval denotes the rest of a
  protein substrate. E3 ubiquitin ligases of the N-end rule pathway are called N-recognins.
  A: The Arg/N-end rule pathway. “Primary,” “secondary,” and “tertiary” denote mechanistically
  distinct subsets of destabilizing N-terminal residues. C* denotes oxidized N-terminal
  Cys, either Cys-sulfinate or Cys-sulfonate, produced in vivo by reactions that require
  nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen. Oxidized N-terminal Cys is arginylated by ATE1-encoded
  isoforms of arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase), which also arginylates
  N-terminal Asp (D) and Glu (E). N-terminal Asn (N) and Gln (Q) are deamidated by
  the NTAN1-encoded NtN-amidase and the NTAQ1-encoded NtQ-amidase, respectively. In
  addition to the binding sites that recognize primary destabilizing N-terminal residues,
  the UBR1, UBR2, UBR4 and UBR5 (EDD) N-recognins contain binding sites for substrates
  (denoted by a larger oval) that lack N-degrons and have internal (non-N-terminal)
  degradation signals., Polyubiquitylated Arg/N-end rule substrates are degraded to
  short peptides by the 26S proteasome. Hemin (Fe3+-heme) binds to R-transferase,
  inhibits its arginylation activity and accelerates its in vivo degradation.,, Hemin
  also binds to UBR-type N-recognins. Regulated degradation of specific proteins by
  the Arg/N-end rule pathway mediates the sensing of heme, NO, and oxygen; the elimination
  of misfolded proteins; the regulation of DNA repair; the fidelity of chromosome
  cohesion/segregation; the signaling by G proteins; the control of peptide import;
  the regulation of apoptosis, meiosis, viral infections, fat metabolism, cell migration,
  actin filaments, cardiovascular development, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis and memory;
  the functioning of adult organs, including the brain, muscle, testis and pancreas;
  and many functions in plants (Refs. –,,,,,,, and references therein). B: The Ac/N-end
  rule pathway. Although it is clear that this pathway is present in all or most eukaryotes,
  it has been characterized, thus far, only in yeast. This diagram illustrates the
  mammalian Ac/N-end rule pathway through an extrapolation from its S. cerevisiae
  version. Red arrow on the left indicates the removal of N-terminal Met by Met-aminopeptidases
  (MetAPs). This Met residue is retained if a residue at position 2 is nonpermissive
  (too large) for MetAPs. If the retained N-terminal Met or N-terminal Ala, Val, Ser,
  Thr, and Cys are followed by acetylation-permissive residues, the above N-terminal
  residues are Nt-acetylated by ribosome-associated Nt-acetylases. The resulting N-degrons
  are called Ac/N-degrons. The term “secondary” refers to the necessity of modification
  (Nt-acetylation) of a destabilizing N-terminal residue before a protein can be recognized
  by a cognate N-recognin. Although the second-position Gly or Pro residues can be
  made N-terminal by MetAPs, few proteins with N-terminal Gly or Pro are Nt-acetylated.
