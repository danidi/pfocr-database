caption: 'Proposed model for coordinated epigenetics regulation of ER isotype (ERα
  and ERβ) expression dynamics in breast cancer. A reciprocal expression profile of
  ERα verses ERβ on ductal and lobular epithelial cells establishes initial low ERα:
  ERβ expression. The resultant ERα: ERβ sustains an ER cistrome supportive of normal
  cellular growth and proliferation. The original ERα: ERβ is set by several layers
  of epigenetic control; ERα promoter demethylation, ERα promoter acetylation, miRNA
  homeostasis, and ERβ2 induced proteasome degradation of ERα []. Neoplastic transformation
  moves the ERα: ERβ from low to high score which, in turn, results in ER cistrome
  shift favorable for neoplastic grow and proliferation. ERα promoter methylation,
  loss of ERβ2 assisted ERα level control, ERα promoter deacetylation and miRNA expression
  profile shift together lead to ERα down-regulation as the cells undergo neoplastic
  transformation. Though ERβ down-regulation contributes profoundly to the ERα:ERβ
  score, the exact epigenetic regulations of ERβ expression decrease are yet to be
  studied. However, the cancer cells acquire more aggressive cancerous phenotypes
  like estrogen-independent growth as the tumor proceeds through a malignant transformation
  pathway.'
