caption: Model for the function of ccm2l in cardiovascular development. In our model,
  Ccm2l binds Ccm1 through Ccm1’s N-terminal region. When the two NPXY motifs in Ccm1
  are disrupted, the NPYF motif is sufficient to allow binding between Ccm1 and Ccm2l.
  This differs from the Ccm2–Ccm1 interaction, for which the NPXY motifs are required
  for full-strength binding. We hypothesize that although the NPXY/F motif requirements
  for the Ccm1–Ccm2l and Ccm1–Ccm2 interactions differ, the two complexes transduce
  partially overlapping signals. Thus, when Ccm2l is reduced, exogenously supplied
  Ccm2 can rescue heart morphology and blood circulation in a substantial proportion
  of embryos. The downstream signaling events common to the Ccm1–Ccm2 and Ccm1–Ccm2l
  interactions are essential for normal cardiovascular development, and in their absence
  the endocardium and inflow tract become dilated and blood circulation is compromised.
