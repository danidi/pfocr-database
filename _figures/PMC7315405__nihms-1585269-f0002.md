caption: 'A. Single strand annealing (SSA) converts homologous repeats (marked in
  green) to a single copy, by annealing complementary single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
  ends within each repeat. Replication protein A (RPA) must be displaced to expose
  complementary ssDNA for annealing. B. Alternative end joining (aEJ) rejoins DNA
  ends without use of classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) proteins. MH: microhomology.
  Frequent use of microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is typical but not a defining
  feature of aEJ. The figure depicts the action of DNA polymerase θ (Pol θ), an important
  aEJ mediator in mammalian cells. C. Microhomology-mediated template switching can
  arise when a free 3ʹ ssDNA end lacks an immediately available partner for recombination
  or rejoining. The persistent ssDNA end is thought to interact with ssDNA gaps in
  neighbouring DNA molecules, leading to the synthesis of a few hundred base pairs
  templated on the ectopic donor strand. Multiple rounds of microhomology-mediated
  or HR-mediated template switching can give rise to complex breakpoints in cancer
  and in developmental disorders.'
