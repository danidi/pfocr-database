caption: An aPKCζ–Aurora A–NDEL1 pathway is important for neurite outgrowth. (a) Aurora
  A localizes to the base of an extending neurite. (b) PKCζ phosphorylates Aurora
  A (AurA) on Thr 287, which facilitates Thr 288 autophosphorylation and activation.
  Activated Aurora A binds to TPX2. This, in turn, activates NDEL1 through Ser 251
  phosphorylation, to promote neuritogenesis. Activation is depicted by a spiked outline.
  The lighter arrows indicate as yet unknown feedback mechanisms and the potential
  for this signalling pathway to affect later stages of neuronal differentiation.
