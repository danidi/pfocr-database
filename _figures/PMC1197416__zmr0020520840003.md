caption: Sln1 branch of the HOG pathway. The Sln1 sensor kinase is autophosphorylated
  under conditions of low extracellular osmolarity. Sln1 phosphorylates the histidine
  phosphotransfer protein Ypd1, which phosphorylates both the Skn7 and Ssk1 response
  regulators. Phospho-Skn7 is the active form of this transcription factor, which
  binds to the SSRE of OCH1 and probably other cell wall-related genes. Phospho-Ssk1
  is the inactive form of this response regulator. Sln1 is inactivated in response
  to high extracellular osmolarity. This allows the dephosphorylated forms of Ypd1,
  Ssk1, and Skn7 to accumulate. Dephospho-Skn7 is inactive, whereas dephospho-Ssk1
  activates the Hog1 MAP kinase cascade, which stimulates several transcription factors
  to drive expression of genes to mount the HOG (High Osmoslarity Glycerol) response.
