caption: Metabolic enzymes are indicated by numbers 1 to 20. (1) Citrate synthase,
  Cit1. (2 and 3) Aconitase, Aco1, Aco2. (4 and 5) Isocitrate dehydrogenase, Idh1,
  Idh2. (6 and 7) α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, Kgd1, Kgd2. (8 and 9) Succinate-CoA
  ligase, Lsc1, Lsc2. (10, 11, and 12) Succinate dehydrogenase, Sdh2, Sdh3, Sdh4.
  (13 and 14) Fumarate hydratase, Fum11, Fum12. (15) Malate dehydrogenase, Mdh1-1.

  Color codes for the levels of cell growth rates (G, according to the data of YPD
  medium at 37°C,  and  Figs) and hyphal development (H, according to the data of
  YPD + serum medium at 37°C, ) are also indicated.
