caption: PHB biosynthetic pathway. First, ACAT transfers an acetyl group from one
  molecule of acetyl-CoA to the acetyl group of a second acetyl-CoA and produces acetoacetyl-CoA
  and CoASH. Second, AACR reduces the acetoacetyl group of acetoacetyl-CoA and produces
  (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA. Finally, PHAP polymerizes several (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl
  groups from (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA molecules and produces PHB and CoASH. Synthesized
  PHB is degraded by PHADP to form (R)-3-((R)-3-hydroxybutanoyloxy) butanoate
