caption: 'Proposed neuroprotective role of Withaferin A (WA) in the modulation of
  pathways implicated in neurological abnormalities and dysfunctions.Parkinson’s disease
  (PD): WA is a known inhibitor of the Cdc37/Hsp90 complex. Inhibition of Cdc37/Hsp90
  has resulted in a decrease of pathological protein LRRK2 in cellular models. WA
  exposure also increased the expression of p62 intracellularly, which could potentially
  be responsible for decreased levels of α-synuclein. WA also rescued low levels of
  dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) to improve motor deficits. Cerebral infarction
  (CI): In vitro WA treatment reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
  which mitigate VSMC migration and proliferation. In vivo the PI3K/Akt pathway was
  activated through induced CI, leading to a prevention of apoptosis. Reactive gliosis
  (RG): inhibition of both expression and polymerization of intermediate filaments
  (IFs) by WA led to a decrease in astrocyte reactivity and neuronal apoptosis. Amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (ALS): WA induced expression of Hsp25, which led to a decrease
  in mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and a decrease in neuronal apoptosis. Suppression
  of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) by WA is linked to clearance of transactive response
  DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurological
