caption: Chemokines and their receptors bias the G protein-coupled receptor kinase
  (GRK)-associated phosphorylation barcode. According to this bias, receptors adopt
  different conformational states that mask or unmask specific serine or threonine
  sites for GRK-dependent phosphorylation. (a) Different ligands may bind the same
  chemokine receptor, promoting the differential recruitment of GRKs that activate
  distinct signalling pathways. An example of this situation is illustrated by the
  trio CCL19/CCL21-CCR7 (green receptor), whereby, in dendritic cells (DCs), CCL19
  (orange oval) is promoting haptotaxis in a GRK3-dependant manner (orange form) (Signalling
  pathway 1), while CCL21 (pink oval) is promoting chemotaxis in a GRK6-dependant
  manner (pink form) (Signalling pathway 2). (b) A single chemokine may bind to several
  receptors, differentially recruiting GRKs that activate distinct downstream pathways.
  For instance, CXCL8 chemokine (green oval) binding to CXCR2 (orange form) is promoting
  the GRK6-dependant phosphorylation and activation of receptor downstream signalling
  pathways in the initial phase of cell migration (Signalling pathway 1). Its binding
  to CXCR1 (blue form) is promoting cell chemotaxis and GRK2-dependent phosphorylation
  and endocytosis of the receptor (Signalling pathway 2). (c) Chemokine receptors
  have the propensity to form oligomers to which the binding of the chemokine is anticipated
  to result in the activation of different signalling pathways (Signalling pathway
  3) than the ones resulting from the engagement of each receptor. For sake of simplicity,
  dimers are depicted.
