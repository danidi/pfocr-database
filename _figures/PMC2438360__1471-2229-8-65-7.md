caption: Pathways of biosynthesis of the aspartate family of amino acids, including
  sulphur assimilation, and the pathway of anthocyanin synthesis. The hypothetical
  connection between the methionin and anthocyanin synthesis is indicated in light
  green. Arrows in colour depict the effect of enhanced methionin synthesis. DHDPS,
  dihydrodipicolinate synthase; OPHS, O-phospho-homoserine; TS threonine synthase;
  CgS, cystathionine γ-synthase; CbL, cystathione β-lyase; MS, methionine synthase;
  MGL, methionine γ-lyase; SAM, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, SMM, S-methylmethionine;
  SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAHH, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase.
