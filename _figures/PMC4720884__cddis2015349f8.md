caption: Hypothetical model of the signaling pathway through which MIF is involved
  in ConA-induced autophagic cell death of hepatoma cells. ConA internalization stimulates
  the phosphorylation of STAT3, which can increase MIF mRNA and protein expression/secretion.
  Binding of secreted MIF to hepatoma induces BNIP3 expression, which further induces
  LC3 accumulation to initiate autophagy and cause hepatoma cell death
