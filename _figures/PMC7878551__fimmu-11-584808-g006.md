caption: Hypothetical model for Gram-negative bacteria induced major innate immune
  response in horseshoe crabs. Firstly, Prochelicerase C is induced by LPS and autocatalytically
  activated on the surface of the bacteria, whose active form Chelicerase C activates
  Prochelicerase B and then triggers hemolymph coagulation cascades via activating
  proclotting enzyme to clotting enzyme. On the other hand, the exocytosis occurs
  after binding of Chelicerase C with granules hemocyte and subsequent signaling via
  a G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, resulting in the release of various
  defense molecules, including antimicrobial peptides and coagulation factors. Simultaneously,
  the coagulin activates the Toll\NF-κB signaling cascade through interacting with
  tToll, which also leads to the release of antibacterial substances and other immune
  response.
