caption: Schematic representation of the Hippo pathway core components and their upstream
  regulators in mammals. The extracellular matrix (ECM), the cytoplasm, and the nucleus
  of cells are represented. Arrows indicate activation, while blunt lines indicate
  inhibition. Activation indicates an increase in protein levels or activity, while
  inhibition indicates a decrease in protein levels or activity. Red indicates eventual
  activation of nuclear Yes Associated Protein (YAP)/Trascriptional Coactivator with
  PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), while dark blue indicates eventual inhibition of nuclear
  YAP/TAZ. Light blue arrows indicate phosphorylation of proteins by kinases. Orange
  or light blue balls indicate phosphorylation sites of target proteins. The Hippo
  core kinase cassette is represented inside a black rectangle. Cell polarity and
  cell junction proteins activate Hippo pathway core kinases and inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear
  function. Conversely, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, mitogenic signals,
  inflammation, and mechanical stress coming from the ECM inhibit the Hippo pathway
  core kinases through mechanisms either dependent on or independent of the Rho GTPase
  signaling which in turn stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton core kinases thereby activating
  YAP/TAZ nuclear activity. Lipid biosynthesis and glycolysis activate nuclear YAP
  and TAZ. In the nucleus, YAP and TAZ interact with different transcription factors
  and the resulting transcriptional outcome is context-specific, depending on the
  incoming signals to which cells are exposed and the cell type subjected to such
  signals.
