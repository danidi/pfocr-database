caption: ALPS is a defined by defects in the Fas apoptotic pathway; however, individuals
  with causative mutations do not always manifest disease symptoms. Fas must be recruited
  into lipid rafts in order to stimulate apoptosis. We hypothesize that in ALPS the
  defects in the Fas pathway lead to decreased distribution of Fas receptor into lipid
  rafts, thereby activating the serine threonine kinase Akt. In support, Akt activity
  and distribution of Fas into lipid rafts are inversely correlated in some lymphocyte
  subsets.[] Constitutive activation of Akt stimulates the mTOR pathway, causing uncontrolled
  proliferation of the double negative T cells (DNTs) with consequent lymphadenopathy
  and splenomegaly. These DNTs also secrete IL-10, causing autoimmunity.High levels
  of IL-10 down-regulate TGF-β producing Tregs, a subset of T lymphocytes that can
  regulate immune tolerance.[,] We observe abnormally low Treg numbers in ALPS (unpublished).
  Moreover, low levels of TGF-β producing T-cells can cause an “ALPS-like” disease
  in mice.[] Thus, the Treg dysregulation may exacerbate the systemic autoimmunity.
  Accordingly, mTOR inhibitors, including sirolimus may alleviate ALPS through combined
  mechanisms indicated by stars. First, mTOR inhibitors can directly target the dysregulated
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis and reduce accumulation of abnormal DNTs. Second, mTOR
  inhibitors may block signaling through IL-10.[,] Finally, in contrast to most immunosuppressants,
  mTOR inhibitors can spare Tregs, and thereby help to reset the immune imbalance.
