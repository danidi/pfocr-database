caption: Potential mechanisms of effects of ATRA/As2O3 on APL cells. ATRA induces
  differentiation in two major pathways. First, ATRA disassociates corepressor from
  the PML-RARα/RXR complex and recruits CoA, leading to transcription of target genes.
  Secondly, ATRA regulates the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which may also lead to
  the transcription activation and finally the differentiation of APL cells. Besides,
  ATRA could modulate and degrade the PML-RARα oncoprotein as well. As2O3 exerts dose-dependent
  dual effects. Low dose (<0.5 μM) of As2O3 mediates differentiation of APL cells,
  which may cross-talk with PKA-cAMP-signaling pathway(s) and RAR/RXR signaling pathway(s)
  and may ultimately facilitate histone acetylation. On the other hand, a high dose
  of As2O3 initiates apoptosis by means of decreasing mitochondrial transmembrane
  potentials (Δψm), opening mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) and releasing
  cytochrome c and other pre-apoptotic factors. It is of note that As2O3 can trigger
  the modulation and/or degradation of PML-RARα oncoprotein under a wide range of
  dosage. →, stimulation; ┤, inhibition; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; ANT, adenosine
