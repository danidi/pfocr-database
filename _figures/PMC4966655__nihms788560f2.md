caption: Canonical NHEJ is operational throughout the cell cycle. It can protect DNA
  ends prior to ligation, but deletions and insertions can occur, especially if the
  ends are frayed. HR is a relatively precise pathway to repair DSBs, the defining
  step of which is strand invasion catalyzed by RAD51. RAD51 forms a nucleoprotein
  filament on single-stranded DNA formed by end resection. The 3′ invading end primes
  repair DNA synthesis from the homologous template, primarily the sister chromatid.
  End resection is also an intermediate step in alternative-NHEJ (alt-NHEJ) involving
  microhomology, i.e., a few bp of sequence identity between the DNA ends. For this
  reason, it is also termed microhomology-mediated endjoining (MMEJ). If single-stranded
  DNA forms containing longer stretches of complementarity, they can also anneal,
  in which case the pathway is termed single-strand annealing (SSA, not shown).
