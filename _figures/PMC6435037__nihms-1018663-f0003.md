caption: 'A: In individuals with a sensitized cGAS-STING pathway, the enhanced response
  to DNA viruses might predispose to autoimmunity, but the normal response to infection
  with picornavirus, an RNA virus, might not. Conversely, individuals with a sensitized
  MDA5 pathway may be triggered by picornavirus infection, not DNA virus infection.
  B: In individuals with a sensitized MDA5 pathway, an infection that causes systemic
  type I IFN production may increase the abundance of MDA5 within cells, leading to
  autoreactivity against endogenous ligands.'
