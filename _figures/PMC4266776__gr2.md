caption: 'Schematic representation of Akt activation. Intramolecular interactions
  between PH and KD domains maintain Akt in an inactive conformation. Biological activation
  of Akt occurs by its targeting at the membrane and the binding of PH domain with
  PIP3 phospholipids which disrupts PH-KD interactions, unmasking the threonine (T)
  residue and allowing its phosphorylation by PDK1. Activation of Akt is reinforced
  by the phosphorylation of a second serine residue present in the C-terminal regulatory
  domain by mTORC2. Mutations of residues in the PH domain (E117 and L150 in the SmAkt
  protein) disrupt interactions between PH and KD and lead to Akt activation. (PH:
  Pleckstrin Homology domain, KD: Kinase Domain, RD: Regulatory domain).'
