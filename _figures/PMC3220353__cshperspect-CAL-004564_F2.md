caption: Activity-dependent gene expression in neurons is regulated by distinct calcium
  signaling pathways. Distinct activity-dependent genomic responses may be explained
  by the differential activation of regulatory signaling cascades and transcription
  factors. (1) Ca2+ influx through L-type VDCCs and synaptically activated NMDARs
  binds to and activates CaM, leading to activation of the GTP-binding protein Ras
  and subsequent induction of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Ras binds and activates
  the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase Raf. Raf in turn phosphoyrlates
  and activates MEK, which phosphoyrlates and activates ERK 1 and 2. Following its
  translocation into the nucleus, ERK can phosphorylate intermediate kinases like
  RSK2, which in turn phosphorylate CREB. ERK may also phosphorylate and activate
  the TCF-family transcription factors, which upon forming a complex with SRF may
  initiate gene transcription downstream from SRF binding sites. (2) CaM activation
  by Ca2+ entering through NMDARs and VDCCs, but especially through L-type VDCCs,
  also stimulates the CaMK signal transduction cascade. Ca2+/CaM binds to and activates
  CaMKK. Next, CaMKK phosphorylates and activates cytoplasmic CaMKI, which can in
  turn translocate into the nucleus (; ). CaMKK also phosphorylates Ca2+/CaM-bound
  CaMKIV. CaMKIV and perhaps also CaMKI can phosphorylate the transcription factor
  CREB (). Stimulation of CREB-mediated transcription, however, requires the additional
  activation by CaMKIV of the CREB coactivator CBP. It follows that VDCC and NMDAR-mediated
  [Ca2+]i increases and subsequent activation of Ras/MAPK pathways are sufficient
  to induce TCF/SRF-dependent transcription. However, activation of CREB-dependent
  transcription necessitates the additional Ca2+-dependent stimulation of CaMKIV and
  CBP by nuclear Ca2+.
