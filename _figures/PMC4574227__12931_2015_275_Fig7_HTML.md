caption: Schematic figure illustrating the signaling pathway activation with high-tidal-volume
  mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced augmentation of mechanical
  stretch-mediated cytokine production and lung injury were attenuated with Src-deficient
  mice and pharmacological inhibition of Smad3 activity by SIS. MIP-2 = macrophage
  inflammatory protein-2; MMP-9 = matrix metalloproteinase-9; SIS3 = specific inhibitor
  of Smad3; Src+/− = Src-deficient mice; VILI = ventilator-induced lung injury
