caption: Scheme of putative secoridoids biosynthetic pathway. Genes differential expressed
  (DEGs) along the pathway in turning purple (TP) vs mature green (GM) drupes of ‘Carolea’
  populations growing at different meters above sea level (masl) are showed in the
  boxes. The grids on the left of each boxes indicate the expression pattern detected
  through transcriptomic analysis in the drupe of ‘Carolea’ populations growing at
  different meters above sea level (masl). In dashed box the relative expression levels
  of SLS1 genes in green mature (GM) and turning purple (TP) drupes of ‘Carolea’ populations
  growing at different meters above sea level (masl), estimated by qRT-PCR after normalization
  with the ELONGATOR FACTOR1 alpha (EF1) housekeeping gene. The results were reported
  as mean values (± standard deviation) of three replicates. Asterisks indicate significant
  pairwise differences using Student’s t-test (P ≤ 0.05)
