caption: Crosstalk between the adrenal steroidogenic regulatory network and the immune
  pathway. During the inflammatory response induced by LPS, the synthesis of glucocorticoids
  in adrenocortical cells is modulated by the immune pathway through cytokines. The
  SRN, in turn, feeds back upon the cytokines signaling pathways. The Spiga et al.
  mathematical model has therefore also integrated these cytokine effects on the steroidogenic
  response to LPS. Their model predicts sustained induction of adrenal glucocorticoid
  (A-CORT) and inhibition of pGR, transient induction of SF-1 and StAR transcription,
  transient inhibition of DAX-1 gene expression, and SF-1, StAR, and DAX-1 mRNA and
  protein dynamics that were then shown experimentally in LPS treated rats. From ().
