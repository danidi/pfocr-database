caption: Model of mir-71 function in AWC asymmetry. In the AWCOFF cell, high calcium
  level activates the calcium-regulated UNC-43/TIR-1/MAPK cascade, leading to srsx-3
  expression. In the AWCON cell, nsy-4 and nsy-5 promote the stability of mature mir-71
  through an unknown mechanism. The mature mir-71 miRNA targets the 3′UTR of tir-1
  mRNA for degradation, leading to the inhibition of the calcium signaling pathway
  and the subsequent induction of str-2 expression. Orange color represents factors
  that promote AWCON. Blue color represents factors that promote AWCOFF. Gray/white
  color represents inactive or less active factors. Dotted line represents factors
  being downregulated. PD, pentanedione; BU, butanone.
