caption: A model of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) microRNA- (miRNA)-mediated reactivation
  from latency. Reactivation from latency requires myeloid differentiation and attenuation
  of host cell signaling important for latency maintenance. HCMV miRNAs target multiple
  components of the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Mitogen activated protein
  kinase kinase (MEK)/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway
  to interfere with UL138 expression. HCMV UL138 promotes EGFR signaling, which is
  critical for latency maintenance []. EGFR signaling through Early growth response-1
  (EGR-1), in turn, promotes expression of HCMV UL138, creating a feed-forward loop
  []. Although miR-US22 is not expressed during latency, it may instead act to block
  EGFR signaling during the early steps of reactivation []. Furthermore, miR-US5-2
  also inhibits a component of the EGFR pathway and may contribute to HCMV reactivation
  []. HCMV proteins are shown in green and HCMV miRNAs are shown in red.
