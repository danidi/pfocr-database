caption: AAF-induced −1 frameshift pathway. The primer terminus when located opposite
  the lesion site is designated the lesion terminus (LT). The LT can isomerize via
  a slippage mechanism into the slipped intermediate, which has a paired primer terminus
  (post-LT). Elongation from the nonslipped and slipped intermediates lead to TLS0
  and TLS−1 products, respectively. (B) Diagram of the modified template, pUC-3G3.ss.
  A single AAF adduct is located with the recognition site of SmaI. The positions
  of PvuII and EcoRI restriction sites and lengths of the strands produced upon elongation
  of the labeled primer are indicated. L0, fragment elongated up the lesion site;
  nt, nucleotides.
