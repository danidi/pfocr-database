caption: Illustration of Parkinson's disease gene therapy strategies to date.(a) In
  a sagittal slice of the human brain, dopaminergic pathways are depicted projecting
  within various deep-brain basal ganglia structures particularly affected in Parkinson's
  disease (PD), such as the substantia nigra (SN) projecting to the striatum (STR).
  (b) In the first gene therapy (GT) clinical trial for PD, adeno-associated virus
  (AAV) carrying genes encoding for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a gamma-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA)-producing enzyme, were delivered to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), to
  neurons projecting to, and ostensibly inhibiting hyperactive putaminal (PUT) neurons
  of the striatum. (c,d) The majority of PD GT clinical trials to date, including
  those incorporating neurotrophic factors (NRTN, GDNF) and dopamine-producing enzymes
  (AADC, TH) have targeted the therapeutic vector to striatal neurons, relying on
  retrograde transport to the SN cell bodies to achieve maximal therapeutic response.
  Delivery of the therapeutic vector directly to cell bodies of the SN has been used
  as an alternative or complementary strategy to overcome the transport deficiences
  in this pathological brain tissue in an attempt enhance therapeutic response. (e)
  One of the two major STR/SN gene therapy approaches involves expression and secretion
  of neurotrophic factors glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or neurturin (NRTN)
  in SN neurons projecting to the striatum, and thereby attempting to repair the SN-STR
  dopamine pathway and restore its function. The other GT approach in this system
  relies on expression of enzymes aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) or tyrosine
  hydroxylase (TH), each of which is involved in the synthesis of dopamine from neurochemical
  substrates found in in striatum-projecting neurons.
