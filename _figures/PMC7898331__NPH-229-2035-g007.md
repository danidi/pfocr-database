caption: A simplified model for the role of COP1 in abscisic acid (ABA)‐regulated
  stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. The clade A PP2Cs act as negative regulators of
  stomatal closure mainly by inhibiting the activity of OST1. Recruitment of the clade
  A PP2Cs by the ABA‐PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor pathway leads to de‐repression of OST1
  and stomatal closure (right‐hand pathway in the model schematic depicted in the
  figure). COP1‐mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the clade A
  PP2Cs increases free OST1, leading to stomatal closure (left‐hand pathway). Abscisic
  acid can potentiate the effect of the COP1‐PP2Cs regulatory module. The ABA‐promoted
  degradation of ABI1 and AHG3 by COP1 is partly dependent on PYLs.
