caption: Integrin signaling in CLL. (A) Inside-out integrin signaling. Signaling through
  the BCR, dependent on Btk and PLC-γ2, activates the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin,
  causing a conformational change to the open, active form. This form has high affinity
  for ligand binding and induces cell migration and adhesion. (B) Outside-in integrin
  signaling. Ligand binding to an integrin induces signals that can lead to growth,
  differentiation, survival, or apoptosis.
