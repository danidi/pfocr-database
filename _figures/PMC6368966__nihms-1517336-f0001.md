caption: A, The potential structural changes in endothelial monolayer of pulmonary
  vessel during lung vascular injury, endothelial cell (EC) regeneration and vascular
  remodeling. Endothelial injury results in loss of smooth muscle cell (SMC)-EC contact
  in the intima of injured vessels. Activated Notch pathway in EC promotes endothelial
  regeneration in response to lung injury but hyperactive Notch may lead to hyperproliferation
  of EC/SMC and concentric pulmonary artery wall thickening. B, The proposed mechanisms
  of Notch-mediated SMC proliferation (upper part of the panel) and EC regeneration
  (lower part of the panel) by EC-SMC contact and BMPR2 signaling. The mechanism involved
  in EC regeneration is initiated by BMPR2-dependent production of collagen IV and
  subsequent activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and phosphorylation of the
  signaling molecule c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in EC. Targeting the phosphorylated
  JNK to caveolin 1 (Cav1) stabilizes presenilin 1 in γ-secretase complex and eventually
  activating Notch1. The N1ICD-associated gene expression results in EC proliferation
  and survival and leads to EC regeneration and endothelial repair. Re-established
  EC-SMC contact also activates Notch3 in SMC, especially in SMC with upregulated
  Notch3, and release N3ICD into the cytoplasm. N3ICD can go through the canonical
  pathway to stimulate gene expression involved in SMC proliferation and dedifferentiation
  and eventually results in pulmonary vascular remodeling. N3ICD may also functionally
  interact with Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, increases Ca2+ influx and subsequently
  causes SMC contraction and pulmonary vasoconstriction.
