caption: Pathogenesis of systemic erythematosus lupus. (1) Low-density granulocytes
  (LDGs) undergo apoptosis and release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autoantigens,
  thus stimulating formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as well as release
  of both antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA). Nucleic acids
  and AMPs form complexes capable of binding to high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)
  protein, which can be recognized by toll-like receptors in plasmacytoid dendritic
  cells (pDCs), which respond by synthesizing interferon alpha (IFN-α), thus promoting
  formation of NETs and IL-6. Both cytokines induce differentiation of autoantibody-secreting
  autoreactive B cells, leading to formation of immune complexes that activate the
  complement system and also are susceptible to be internalized by pDCs through type
  II Fcγ receptors (FcγRII)-mediated endocytosis. Endosomes associate to toll-like
  receptors (TLRs)-containing vesicles, which results in activation of pDCs and synthesis
  of IFN-α, further inducing NETs and tissular inflammation. In addition, necrotic
  cells-derived DNA–HMGB1 complexes activate B cells resulting in production of autoantibodies
  and formation of immune complexes that activate pDCs, leading to IFN-α synthesis
  and thus establishing a positive feedback. (2) Another pathway capable of inducing
  autoantibodies production is mediated by release of autoantigens from apoptotic
  cells that undergo secondary necrosis and generate secondary necrotic cells (SNECs);
  accumulation of such cells in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs facilitates
  presentation of autoantigens by follicular dendritic cells (fDCs) to autoreactive
  B cells and subsequent formation of immune complexes that lead to persistent inflammatory
  process that causes tissular injury in SEL patients.
