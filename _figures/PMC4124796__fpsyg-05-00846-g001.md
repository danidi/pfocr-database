caption: Signaling pathways of leptin and insulin in the CNS. (A) Leptin and insulin
  pathways converge on IRS/PI3K/Akt axis in arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Binding
  of insulin and leptin to their receptors leads to the phosphorylation of IRS2 which
  activates PI3K to facilitate the phosphorylation of Akt by PDK. Akt activation finally
  phosphorylates and excludes FoxO1 from nucleus to inactivate it. FoxO1 is known
  as a repressor of POMC expression, but as an activator of AgRP expression. Expression
  of POMC and AgRP is also regulated by JAK/STAT3 pathway. Once leptin binds to its
  receptor, STAT3 is phosphorylated by JAK and is dimerized. The active dimeric form
  of STAT3 translocates to the nucleus where it inhibits AgRP and activates POMC expression.

  3-OH kinase; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1; Akt, protein kinase B; FoxO1,
  forkhead transcription factor O1; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT3, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3; POMC, proopiomelanocortin; AgRP, agouti-related protein.
