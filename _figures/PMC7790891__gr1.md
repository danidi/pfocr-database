caption: The regulatory mechanisms of ginsenosides in HUVEC. (1) Compound K(CK) and
  ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) similarly regulate the expression of Bcl-2 by inhibiting the
  phosphorylation of p38 and JNK to regulate the role of mitochondria in anti-apoptosis
  induced by TNFα or by Ox-LDL. (2) Ginsenoside F1 improves the expression of A20
  by targeting A20 when induced by Ox-LDL, which inhibits the inflammatory factors
  secreted by the NF-κB pathway and cell adhesion molecules, suppresses the adhesion
  of monocytes to ECs, and inhibits the inflammatory response. (3) Ginsenoside Rg2
  could inhibit the inflammatory factors secreted by the NF-κB pathway and cell adhesion
  molecules when induced by LPS. (4) Rb1 can active the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway and then
  suppress the ROS-VCAM-1 pathway to protect from aggrevating AS. (5) Rb1 could activate
  the PI3K/Akt pathway by targeting GPER and then suppress the apoptosis and inflammation.
  (6) Rb1 can suppress the expression of miR-33a and then improve the expression of
  PEDF to alleviate the angiogenesis.
