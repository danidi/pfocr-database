caption: Proposed involvement of barrier dyfunction in the pathogenesis of non-infective
  chronic inflammatory diseases. (1) Under physiological circumstances, there is a
  tightly control of antigen trafficking from the gut lumen into the intestinal lamina
  propria (antigen sampling) that leads to mucosal tolerance, homeostasis and anergy
  mediated by the involvement of a variety immune cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
  (2) Following a variety of environmental stimuli, including gut microbiome imbalance
  (dysbiosis), paracellular permeability is increased secondary to the upregulation
  of specific pathways, including the zonulin pathway. (3) As a consequence of prolonged
  and uncontrolled antigen trafficking, innate immune response or immunoregulatory
  defects leads to the onset of inflammation with secondary production of pro-inflammatory
  cutokines, including TNF-aloha and IFN-gamma that, by themselves, are causing further
  increase in gut permeability by activating the myosin light chain kinake (MLCK)
  pathway. (4) This mechanism starts a vicious cycle of further increase in gut permeability
  and subsequent antigen trafficking that ultimately lead to break of tolerance and
  onset of chronci inflammatory diseases whose nature depends on the genetic host
  predisposition
