caption: Model of MDA5 filament formation and signal activation. MDA5 contains the
  2CARD, helicase domain and CTD. Upon dsRNA binding, helicase-CTD forms a ring-like
  structure, which cooperatively stacks along dsRNA to assemble into a filament. Filament
  formation brings together neighboring 2CARDs into proximity and induces oligomerization
  of 2CARD alongside the filament. The 2CARD oligomer then triggers monomer-to-filament
  transition of MAVS and activates the downstream IFN signaling pathway.
