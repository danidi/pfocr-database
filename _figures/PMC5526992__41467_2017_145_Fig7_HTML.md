caption: 'A proposed model for the contribution of JNK, JAK/STAT and Nrf2 pathways
  to cell competition. JNK signalling activation restricts the growth of loser cells.
  JAK/STAT signalling, activated by the Unpaired ligands secreted by the loser cells,
  plays a dual role: it promotes the proliferation of prospective loser tissue, as
  well as the overproliferation of winner cells during cell competition. Nrf2 pathway
  activation in losers also plays a dual role: it promotes prospective loser cell
  survival; however it also primes loser cells for their elimination by WT neighbours
  during cell competition'
