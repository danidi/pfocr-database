caption: 'Obesity, ER stress, miRNAs and endothelial function. Under ER stress, BIP
  will activate the three UPR sensor pathways that are initiated by PERK, ATF6, and
  IRE1. MicroRNAs involved in the UPR pathway and evidenced linkage to obesity and
  endothelial dysfunction are listed in this diagram. miR-30d, miR-181a, and miR-199a-5p
  have all been shown to directly target BIP. MiR-204, miR-23a, miR-27a and miR-24
  directly target and inhibit PERK signaling, which then causes ER-stress-induced
  cell death. ATF4, located downstream of PERK, is directly inhibited by miR-214 and
  miR-663. CHOP, which is regulated by ATF4, is suppressed by miR-211. IRE1α and its
  downstream signaling XBP1 make up the second arm of the UPR; the former is targeted
  by miR-1291, miR-23a, miR-27a and miR-24, while the latter is targeted by miR-214.
  Finally, in the third arm of UPR, miR-221, miR-145 and miR-494 directly target ATF6.
