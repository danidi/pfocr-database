caption: Inflammasome activation and cross-talk between endothelial cells (ECs) and
  macrophages (MØ) in atherogenesis. In monocytes/macrophages, the activation of NLRP
  inflammasome is initiated through the recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs by TLRs, CD36,
  or IL-1R, which activates NF-κB. NF-κB transactivates genes such as NLRP, pro-IL-1β,
  and SREBP in Signal 1 (i.e., the priming step of the inflammasome). Signal 2 (the
  activating step) stimulates the oligomerization of inflammasome components (e.g.,
  NLRP, ASC, and pro-caspase-1), thus resulting in the auto-cleavage and activation
  of caspase-1. Active caspase-1 in turn cleaves pro-IL-1β/pro-IL-18 to the biologically
  active form of IL-1β/IL-18. Activation of SREBP in monocytes/macrophages also induces
  genes involved in lipogenesis such as HMG-CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR) and LDLR, which
  may contribute to the formation of foam cell. In ECs, NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  is also initiated through the recognition of PAMPs/DAMPs by TLRs-MyD88, CD36, RAGE,
  and IL-1R signaling pathways. The activated NF-κB pathway can increase the transcription
  of pro-IL-1β and likely induces SREBP, which in turn stimulates Signal 1 through
  transactivating NLRP3 and NOX2 genes, the latter of which generates a high level
  of ROS. ROS production can activate NF-κB to escalate Signal 1 and also induce the
  oligomerization of the NLRP3 inflammasome by initiating Signal 2. The resulting
  secretion of IL-1β, and possibly IL-18 in ECs, promotes the expression of chemoattractant
  and adhesion molecules (e.g., MCP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin). The increased
  ROS resulting from SREBP2-NOX2 activation inhibits eNOS-derived NO, which can be
  an inflammasome inhibitor. Collectively, the activation of SREBP in ECs mediates
  the activation of innate immune response as well as the impaired NO bioavailability,
  thereby constituting endothelial dysfunction. These detrimental effects in ECs promote
  the recruitment and transmigration of monocytes. Reciprocally, the cytokines released
  by macrophages (e.g., IL-1β/18) aggravate the EC inflammasome. The depicted innate
  immune responses in macrophages and ECs provide a dynamic link between the “response-to-retention”
  and “response-to-injury” hypotheses. Dash lines are pathways remain to be experimentally
  validated.
