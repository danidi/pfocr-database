caption: Under basal conditions, high intracellular K + concentration is maintained
  by the activity of Na +/K +-ATPase, which actively imports K + ions into the cell
  and generates an electrical gradient that favors movement of cations into the cytoplasm.
  Together with leak K + channels, Na +/K +-ATPase contributes to the transmembrane
  potential, characterized by a slight excess of negative charges inside the cell.
  Under conditions of NLRP3 stimulation, this equilibrium is disturbed. ATP increases
  the open probability of P2X7R, a cation channel that allows for net exchange of
  intracellular K + ions for extracellular Na + or Ca 2+ ions. This produces a net
  K + efflux that acts as an NLRP3 activator. Activation of P2X7R is also accompanied
  by opening of pannexin-1 channels. During hypotonic stimulation, the regulatory
  volume decrease (RVD) response causes opening of K + and Cl - channels, driving
  an efflux of K + and Cl - ions to balance the intracellular and extracellular osmolarity
  values. To induce NLRP3 activation, this mechanism of K + ions depletion additionally
  requires an influx of Ca 2+ through TRP channels and activation of the kinase TAK1.
  NLRP3-activating K + ionophores produce a net K + efflux through different mechanisms.
  The peptide gramicidin can insert itself into plasma membranes, forming pores that
  are permeable to monovalent cations. This enables an exchange of intracellular K
  + for extracellular Na +. Valinomycin, a neutral ionophore, is a cell-permeant compound
  that can bind to K + ions, replacing the hydration shell of this cation. Consequently,
  K + ions shielded by valinomycin molecules can pass across the plasma membrane without
  a requirement for opening a K +-permeable pore. Nigericin is a carboxylic ionophore
  that can bind to H + or to K +. Both the H +- and K +-bound forms of nigericin are
  plasma membrane permeant. In this way, nigericin mediates K + transport from the
  compartment with higher K + concentration to the compartment with lower K + concentration,
  concomitantly leading to a transient acidification of cytosol. In further stages,
  the increased cytosolic [H +] can stimulate Na +/H + exchangers to extrude H + ions
  from the cytosol, which is accompanied by Na + influx . Lysosomal damage caused
  by particulate materials or by other factors requires K + efflux to induce NLRP3
  activation, but it is unknown which factors are involved in this K + depletion pathway.
