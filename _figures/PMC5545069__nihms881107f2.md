caption: Iron bound transferrin is endocytosed into the cell via CD71. Iron is then
  reduced by STEAP3 from the Fe+3 to Fe+2 state, which then is shuttled out of the
  endosome via DMT1. Holo-transferrin and CD71 are recycled back to the cell surface.
  Non-transferrin bound iron may also be reduced to Fe+2 by DCYTB and transported
  into the cell by DMT1. Intracellular redox active iron may then be used for metabolic
  processes, formation of iron-sulphur clusters, or shuttled into the mitochondria
  for heme synthesis. If intracellular iron is in excess, it can be stored (via the
  chaperone protein PCBP1) in the ferritin storage complex. When needed, iron can
  then be released from the ferritin complex through the process of ferritinophagy,
  mediated by NCOA4. Iron may also be exported from the cell by FPN1, following oxidation
  to Fe+3 by HEPH.
