caption: (A). Engagement of HVEM by membrane LIGHT during T-T cell interactions leads
  to the activation of the NFκB-RelA, AP-1, and Akt pathways that enhances cell proliferation,
  cytokine production, and survival of HVEM-expressing cells. Similarly, engagement
  of HVEM by BTLA in trans induces NF-κB activation and promotes T-cell survival.
  Alternative interactions of HVEM with BTLA, e.g. in cis configuration, also promotes
  T-cell survival by a mechanism that has not been fully elucidated. (B). Engagement
  of BTLA on T cells by HVEM expressed in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) induces
  ITIM phosphorylation on BTLA facilitating the recruitment of phosphatases SHP-1
  and SHP-2, which once activated, downregulates the TCR signaling pathway resulting
  in reduced cellular activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. Similarly,
  HVEM binding to CD160 expressed in T cells leads to reduced phosphorylation of the
  CD3ζ chain and intracellular proteins what result in decreased T-cell activation
  and proliferation. The mechanism by which CD160 engagement by HVEM attenuates T-cell
  responses remains unknown. In naive T cells, the HVEM and BTLA cis configuration
  negatively regulates NF-κB signaling pathway that may sustain the naive phenotype
  by blocking ligands in the surrounding microenvironment.
