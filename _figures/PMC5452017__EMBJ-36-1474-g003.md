caption: Under conditions of reduced glucose availability such as low carbohydrates/high‐fat
  diet, exercise, or fasting, the liver utilizes fatty acids mobilized from adipose
  tissue and ketogenic amino acids (i.e. leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, isoleucine,
  tryptophan, tyrosine, threonine) to produce acetoacetate (AcAc), 3‐β‐hydroxybutyrate
  (3HB), and acetone (Ac). Acetone is considered to have negligible metabolic significance
  and rapidly eliminated through urine and lungs. Ketone bodies cross the blood–brain
  barrier via monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Inside the cells, they may be directed
  toward anabolic or oxidative pathways depending on the developmental stage and cellular
  requirements. In the anabolic pathway taking place in the cytosol, acetoacetate
  is converted into acetoacetyl‐CoA (AcAc‐CoA) by acetoacetyl‐CoA synthase (AACS).
  AcAc‐CoA can be condensed with acetyl‐CoA to generate the precursor of sterols,
  3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐CoA (HMG‐CoA) by 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐CoA synthase
  1 (HMGCS1). The acetyl‐CoA produced from AcAc‐CoA by cytosolic β‐ketothiolase (cBKD),
  or from citrate by ATP‐citrate lyase (ACLY), can be transformed in malonyl‐CoA for
  fatty acid synthesis. Amino acid can be synthesized utilizing intermediates of the
  TCA cycle. Oxidation of ketones occurs in the mitochondria (Mit) where AcAc directly
  taken up or generated from 3HB by 3‐β‐hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH) is transformed
  into acetyl‐CoA via succinyl‐CoA‐3‐oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT), and mitochondrial
  β‐ketothiolase (mBKD). The complete oxidation of AcAc yields 23 molecules of ATP,
  while 3HB generates 26 molecules of ATP.
