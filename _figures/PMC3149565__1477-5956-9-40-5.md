caption: 'Integrated proteome data onto a simplified metabolic network. I: TCA cycle;
  II: Glycolysis;III: SAM degradation pathway. Pathways and corresponding enzymes
  were identified from Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases, and only major reactions in
  each pathway are shown. Protein names are provided in Additional file 5: Table S6.
  Up or down arrows show the up- or down-regulation of proteins in PR2 strain, respectively.
