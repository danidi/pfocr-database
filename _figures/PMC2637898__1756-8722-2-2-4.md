caption: 'VEGF signaling pathways. Binding specificity of various vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) family members and their receptors. The VEGF family consists
  of seven ligands derived from distinct genes (VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, and -E, placenta
  growth factor [PIGF] -1 and -2). VEGF family members have specific binding affinities
  to VEGF receptor (VEGFR) -1, VEGFR-2 and BEGFR-3 tyrosine kinase receptors as shown.
  In addition, neuropilin (NRP)-1 and NRP-2 are co-receptors for specific isoforms
  of VEGF family members and increase binding affinity of these ligands to their respective
  receptors. Used with permission from: Hicklin DJ, Ellis LM. Role of the vascular
  endothelial growth factor pathway in tumor growth and angiogenesis. J Clin Oncol
