caption: 'Intracellular carbon fluxes of riboflavin production with A. gossypii B2
  on rapeseed oil and complex medium, which were determined by four parallel 13C-labeled
  tracer studies using [13C2] glycine, [13C] formate, [13C5] glutamate, and [U13C] yeast
  extract. The carbon fluxes were normalized to the specific riboflavin production
  rate (8.7 ± 2.3 µmol g−1 h−1), which was set to 100%. Riboflavin was obtained at
  the end of the growth phase of riboflavin producing A. gossypii after 144 h. Data
  are derived from positional 13C enrichment obtained from 13C NMR measurements (Table ),
  corrected for natural labeling and dilution effects through unlabeled pre-culture
  medium. Note that the model is simplified and cannot distinguish between carbon
  flux through e.g. gluconeogenesis or lower PP pathway as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase.
  Reaction between OAA/MAL and PEP/PYR pool is a lumped flux. Only reactions necessary
  for riboflavin biosynthesis were considered and all reactions represent net fluxes.
  Note that some reactions as shown in Fig.  can be expressed as a single reaction,
  i.e. all decarboxylation reactions and in general all reactions with more than one
  educt or product can be expressed as a single flux. All fluxes from the medium into
  the cell are not fluxes based on concentrations, but solely derived from 13C labeling
  of riboflavin. Note that the conversion of citrate to isocitrate via aconitase most
  likely does not occur in the peroxisome []. 3PG, 3-phosphoplycerate; AcCoAP/M, peroxisomal/mitochondrial
