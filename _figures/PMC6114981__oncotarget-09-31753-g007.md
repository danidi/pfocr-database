caption: (A) FABP5-ERRα crosstalk is required for mitochondrial functions and cell
  proliferation in PCa cells. FABP5 activated mRNA expression of more than one metabolic
  gene via ERRα signaling in PCa cells. (B) FABP5 knockdown induced high energy stress
  (increase of AMP/ATP ratio) in PCa cells. AMPK was activated by increased AMP/ATP
  ratio. Moreover, autophagy, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were induced in PCa
  cells transfected with siRNA against FABP5 via the AMPK-FOXO3A signaling pathway.
  Thus, we considered that metabolic genes regulated by FABP5-ERRα played an essential
  role for energy homeostasis and viability in PCa cells. These results suggested
  that FABP5 may be a molecular target for the antitumorigenic treatments for PCa.
