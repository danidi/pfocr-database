caption: '(A) The GAL regulatory network. (B) The GAL or Leloir metabolic pathway.
  The colors show the amino acid identity of each component compared to their S. cerevisiae
  homologs (full data in ). Proteins with two homologs in S. uvarum are split into
  two parts: Gal1/Gal3 and Gal80/Gal80b (also known as Sbay_12.142 [] or 670.20 [])
  are two pairs of paralogs from a WGD event, while Gal2/Gal2b (also known as Sbay_10.165
  [] or 672.62 []) are paralogs from a recent tandem duplication event ().DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19027.00310.7554/eLife.19027.004Figure
