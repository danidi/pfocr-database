caption: The microbiota influences metabolic programmes within the gut. Signals derived
  from gram-negative flagellated bacteria resident within a healthy microbiome activate
  toll-like receptors on lamina propria CD11c+ dendritic cells and induce IL23 secretion.
  In response to increased IL23 levels, ILC3s signal to intestinal epithelial cells
  via IL22, which activates a STAT3 signaling pathway to repress rev-erbα expression,
  with subsequent de-repression of nfil3 transcription. Increased nfil3 expression
  drives circadian lipid homeostasis and development of ILCs and Th17 cells, promoting
  intestinal homeostasis. DC, dendritic cell. ILC, innate lymphoid cell, STAT, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription.
