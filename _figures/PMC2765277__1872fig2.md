caption: Elementary flux patterns in a condensed model of the TCA cycle and adjacent
  reactions. (A) Model of the entire network. The TCA cycle is chosen as a subsystem
  (dark reactions). (B–D) Elementary flux patterns of the system are indicated by
  thick black arrows. The associated pathway through the entire system is indicated
  by thick gray arrows. The thickness of the arrows corresponds to the relative flux
  through each reaction. (E) Alternative pathway through the entire system using the
  same reactions of the flux pattern depicted in C. While the pathway in C corresponds
  to the glyoxylate cycle that can be used for growth on fatty acids, E corresponds
  to the phosphoenolpyruvate-glyoxylate cycle used as a catabolic pathway during growth
  on low glucose concentrations (). A list of abbreviations can be found in Supplemental
  material S2.
