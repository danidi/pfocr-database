caption: According to the main pathway in the model, repetitive low frequency stimulation
  of the nerve results in activation of muscle-type nAChRs and a local increase in
  postsynaptic free Ca2+, due to entry of extracellular Ca2+ through nAChRs and/or
  voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. This Ca2+ then binds to calmodulin in the muscle
  cell, and the Ca2+–CaM complex has both direct and indirect actions on nNOS activity.
  Ca2+–CaM binds to nNOS, resulting in an acute increase in NO production, as well
  as stimulating the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which in turn dephosphorylates
  nNOS and increases its activity. The activation of calcineurin by Ca2+–CaM is long-lasting,
  maintaining nNOS activation and NO production long after cessation of the stimulus
  routine. The NO produced by these mechanisms diffuses to the nerve terminal to decrease
  the quantal release via an unknown sGC–cGMP-dependent mechanism. Alternatively,
  signalling between the muscle cell and the terminal may occur indirectly via the
  Schwann cell. Such a pathway is indicated by the dashed line and involves the activity-dependent
  production of an unknown muscle-derived messenger, which in turn activates NOS in
  the Schwann cell.
