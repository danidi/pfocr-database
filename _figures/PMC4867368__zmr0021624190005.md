caption: Comparison of the lipoate assembly and lipoic acid ligation pathways in E.
  coli. The top scheme shows the transfer of octanoate from ACP to the active site
  thiol of LipB, followed by the attack on the ε-amino group of the LD lysine residue
  on the LipB thioester to give octanoyl-LD. LipA then converts this intermediate
  to lipoate by the consumption of two molecules of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)
  and two sulfur atoms derived from the LipA auxiliary [Fe-S] cluster. Two molecules
  each of methionine (Met) and deoxyadenosine (DOA) are also produced. The bottom
  scheme shows the lipoate ligase reaction, as described in the legend to . Note that
  octanoate is also an LplA substrate.
