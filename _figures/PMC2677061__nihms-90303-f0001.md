caption: Both families of neurotrophic factors employ a two-receptor complex to produce
  specific growth factor effects. For the neurotrophin family, p75 can bind all four
  ligands, but maximal activity is obtained only the ligand binds both p75 and its
  specific trk receptor. Similarly, GFLs bind both a specific GPI-linked GFRα receptor
  and ret. But unlike the neurotrophin receptor complex, the GFRs are not thought
  to initiate any signaling independent of ret (whereas p75 can signal via the ceramide
  pathway).
