caption: (A) Serratia marcescens sequesters heme via the HasA hemophore. The HasB–ExbB–ExbD
  multiprotein complex is required for proton-motive force transport of diverse molecules
  through the outer membrane, where HasB is the S. marcescens TonB paralogue. Heme
  is eventually transported into the cytosol via a membrane-associated ABC protein
  and degraded by a heme degrader to liberate iron. (B) In Staphylococcus aureus,
  IsdB and IsdH are host hemoglobin receptors, IsdA and IsdC are heme transport proteins
  and the IsdDEF complex is responsible for ATP-dependent transmembrane heme transport.
  Imported cytosolic heme is degraded by IsdG or IsdI.(A) Adapted from [].(B) Adapted
  from [].
