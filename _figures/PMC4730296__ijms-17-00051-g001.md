caption: Outline of melatonin biosynthesis and function. Amphibians, reptiles, and
  fishes can detect light by photoreceptor cells of the retinae and pinealocytes of
  the pineal glands. (A) Photic detecting and transforming system includes the retina
  photoreceptor cells and the pinealocytes; (B) Melatonin synthesis pathway is summarized
  in the frame; (C) Melatonin performs its various biological functions in different
  tissues and at different growth/development phases through binding to its receptors.
  In mammals the photoreceptive role of the pineal gland is lost.
