caption: Regulation of prophase arrest and resumption of meiosis. (A) Regulation of
  prophase arrest. During the arrested state, a signaling pathway that is established
  in response to the interactions of the oocyte with its neighboring granulosa cells
  leads to the accumulation of cAMP in the oocyte. cAMP causes the phosphorylation
  of protein kinase A (PKA). Similarly to Chk1 and Chk2 during the G2 DNA damage checkpoint,
  PKA in prophase-arrested oocytes phosphorylates and activates Wee1 kinase and specifically
  the Wee1 isoform Wee1B. Furthermore, PKA phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc25B phosphatase.
  As a result, Cyclin B-CDK1 remains inactive and the oocyte arrested in meiotic prophase.
  (B) Resumption of meiosis. During the estrus cycle, the surge of the luteinizing
  hormone (LH) drives a signaling cascade that results in the decline of cAMP levels
  in the oocyte. This leads to PKA inactivation, ending the PKA-dependent phosphorylation
  of Wee1B and Cdc25B. Just as in M-phase entry in somatic cells, Wee1B becomes inactive
  and Cdc25B is activated in order to remove the inhibitory phosphates from CDK1.
  In response to Cyclin B-CDK1 activation, the oocyte enters the first meiotic M-phase.  activating
  phosphate.  inhibiting phosphate.
