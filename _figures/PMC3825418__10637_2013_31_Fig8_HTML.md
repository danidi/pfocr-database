caption: Proposed mechanism of action for Etoposide and LTUSI54. LTUSI54 appears to
  promote the MK2 dependent (p53 independent) pathway of cell cycle arrest over p53
  dependent mechanisms. As MK2 is phosphorylated, it phosphorylates HDM2, which destabilises
  p53, inhibiting the p53 mediated apoptosis pathways
