caption: Regulation of expression and role of ANGPTL4 in lipid metabolism. In WAT,
  fasting induces ANGPTL4 expression through the action of different molecules such
  as PPARs, HIF-1α, and GR. The protein stimulates TG degradation via LPL inhibition.
  In liver, PPAR isoforms and GR stimulate ANGPTL4 expression. In this district, ANGPTL4
  acts in part on hepatic LP and, in part, is released into the bloodstream, acting
  on LPL of peripheral tissues. In skeletal muscle, heart, and macrophages, FAs induce
  ANGPTL4 by PPARδ activation. Also in intestine, FAs stimulate ANGPTL4 expression
  via one of the PPARs. ANGPTL4 produced by enterocytes is thus released towards the
  lumen and inhibits pancreatic LP.
