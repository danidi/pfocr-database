caption: The putative Fog signaling pathway. In the absence of Fog, the Gα12/13 subunit,
  Concertina (Cta), along with its binding partners Gϒ and Gβ, are inactive and associated
  with the co-receptors Mist and Smog. Ric-8 chaperones Cta and regulates its subcellular
  localization. Upon Fog binding, Cta disassociates from Gϒ, and Gβ recruits RhoGEF2
  to the cell membrane where it catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the small
  GTPase Rho1. GTP-bound Rho1, now active, activates Rho Kinase (Rok), which phosphorylates
  the RLC of non-muscle myosin, leading to its activation and subsequent cellular
  contractility. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.
