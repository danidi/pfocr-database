caption: Mutations of GM-CSFRα disrupt alveolar macrophage functions and surfactant
  homeostasis. (top) (A) GM-CSF binds to GM-CSF receptor α (GM-CSFRα) to form a low-affinity
  complex, which then interacts with the β complex (two β chains constitutively bound
  to JAK2) to form the high-affinity hexameric receptor complex (B). Lateral movement
  and aggregation of two such complexes form the active dodecamer signaling receptor
  (not depicted), allowing cross-phosphorylation of the JAK2 molecules and the β subunit.
  Activated JAK2 phosphorylates the transcription factors STAT5, which then dimerizes
  and migrates to the nucleus where it induces the expression of the PU.1 transcription
  factor gene (C). This results in the expression of various PU.1-dependent genes
  and subsequent activation of multiple phagocytic functions, such as adhesion, phagocytosis,
  killing, signaling through TLR4, and the release of IL-12 and -18, which in turn
  induce release of IFN-γ by T and NK cells. This pathway also induces surfactant
  catabolism (D), although the mechanistic details of this pathway remain to be defined.
  (bottom) GM-CSF signaling is abrogated in phagocytes from patients with primary
  PAP who fail to express functional GM-CSFRα molecules (E). In these conditions,
  surfactant is still taken up by the alveolar macrophages, but is not properly catabolized,
  leading to progressive surfactant accumulation within the phagocyte (producing the
  typical foamy appearing alveolar macrophages) and in the alveolar space.
