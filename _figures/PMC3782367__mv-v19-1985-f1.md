caption: 'The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in the autosomal dominant
  retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) retina and proposed to be a target for modulating the
  rate of retinal degeneration. A: Activation of the UPR occurs in the adRP retina
  [,,]. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediators pancreatic ER kinase (PKR)-like
  ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription
  factor 6 (ATF6) are activated during ER stress. During normal cellular homeostasis,
  the immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (GRP78/BiP) is tightly bound to all
  three mediators. In the presence of unfolded proteins, BiP dissociates from the
  three mediators to assist in appropriate protein folding leading to activation of
  the PERK, ATF6 and IRE1 UPR arms. In addition to endoRNase activity, phosphorylated
  (p) IRE1 can activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) that is known to induce
  apoptosis through tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)
  and ASK1 (apoptotic signaling kinase 1) [,]. In mammals, recruitment of TRAF2 by
  pIRE1 allows it to signal to c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The IRE1–TRAF2 complex has
  also been linked to caspase-12 activation and cell death. Caspase-12 is activated
  [] in addition to the calpains and Ca2+-induced activation by caspase-7 that translocates
  to the ER during ER stress []. Activation of the UPR in the adRP retina is accompanied
  by upregulation of the TNFα and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) proteins
  [,]. B: CASP7-ablation in the T17M RHO retina leads to a decreased rate of retinal
  degeneration in T17M RHO mice. We found that ablation of CASP-7 in adRP retinas
  leads to a therapeutic effect detected by electroretinogram (ERG), optical coherence
  tomography (OCT), and histology []. The CASP-7 ablation also modulates UPR signaling.
  Reduction in BiP, ATF6, ATF4, Bim, Bik, Edem2, and eIF2α was detected, suggesting
  that UPR signaling is modulated in these mice. The second pathway modified by ablation
  of CASP-7 is the mammalian target of rapamycin/protein kinase B (mTOR/AKT) signaling
  resulting in downregulation of mTOR and increase of pAKT in T17M RHO CASP-7 mice.
  Finally, ablation of CASP-7 led to the diminishing of TRAF2-JNK-induced apoptosis.
  This reduction may have occurred through the inhibition of PARP1, which is known
  to be cleaved by CASP-7. The PARP1 inhibition in turn perhaps led to the downregulation
  of TNFα resulting in a decrease in TRAF2-pJNK signaling through PARP1-TNFα-tumor
  necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain-receptor-interacting serine/threonine
  protein kinase 1-(TADD-RIPK1)-ASK1-pc-JUN. C: Ablation of proapoptotic CHOP accelerated
  retinal degeneration in adRP mice through reprogramming the UPR. Detrimental effects
  from the ablation of proapoptotic CHOP were detected with ERG, OCT, and histology
  []. We found that ablation of CHOP leads to a greater than eightfold increase in
  peIF2α and 30% reduction in spliced Xbp1. These changes were accompanied by accumulation
  of the RHO protein in the cytoplasm of the photoreceptors []. Therefore, we concluded
  that ablation of CHOP in adRP photoreceptors may be linked to global inhibition
  of protein translation. An observed increase in the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)
  levels supported this hypothesis. D: Overexpression of GRP78/BiP in the adRP retina
  slowed the rate of retinal degeneration. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery of
  GRPP78/BiP to adRP photoreceptors led to an increase in ERG amplitudes during 3
  months []. Overexpression of BiP reprograms the UPR by reducing peIF2α (the PERK
  pathway) and pATF6-50 (the ATF6 pathway) leading to a decrease in proapoptotic CHOP.
  In addition, BiP binds to caspase-12, thus further preventing from induction of
  apoptosis. Finally, BiP forms a complex with Bcl-interacting killer (BIK) preventing
  the translocation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist
  killer (BAK) to the mitochondria. We thus concluded that preservation of photoreceptor
  function resulting from elevated levels of BiP is due to suppression of apoptosis
  rather than to promotion of rhodopsin folding.'
