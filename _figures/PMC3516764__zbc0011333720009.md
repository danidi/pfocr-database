caption: Model for the involvement of the RA in neuronal differentiation. RA promotes
  differentiation of stem cells into neural progenitor cells by activating the CRABP-II/RAR
  pathway. The alternative RA path, mediated by FABP5 and PPARβ/δ, can interfere with
  this step by inducing the expression of the RAR inhibitors Ajuba and Sirt1. This
  inhibition is avoided in early neurogenesis by an increase in the CRABP-II/FABP5
  ratio and in the expression level of RARβ, ensuring that RA signaling is directed
  toward RAR. In later stages of differentiation, The CRABP-II/FABP5 ratio decreases,
  enabling RA to activate PPARβ/δ. In turn, the FABP5/PPARβ/δ pathway induces the
  expression of PDK1, thereby promoting differentiation of progenitor cells into mature
  neurons.
