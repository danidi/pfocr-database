caption: Rice innate immunity signaling pathways [,,,]. Conserved microbial signatures
  are recognized by cell-surface host sensors (also called pattern recognition receptors)
  []. The XA21 sensor detects the sulfated Xoo peptide Ax21, which is secreted from
  bacterial cells. In the absence of infection, the XB24 ATPase physically associates
  with the XA21 JM domain, promotes autophosphorylation, and keeps XA21 in an inactive
  state []. Binding of sulfated Ax21 to the XA21 LRR domain induces dissociation of
  XA21 from XB24 and activates the XA21 non-RD kinase domain []. XA21 phosphorylates
  downstream target proteins that have not yet been identified, as well as XB3 [],
  which is hypothesized to activate a downstream MAPK cascade []. OsWRKY class IIA
  transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators that control the downstream defense
  responses []. Dephosphorylation of XA21 phosphorylated residue(s) by the PP2C phosphatase
  XB15 attenuates the XA21-mediated immune response []. Proper biogenesis and localization
  of XA21 requires the ER chaperones stromal-derived factor-2 (SDF2) and Bip3 [,].
  The LysM-containing, receptor-like protein CEBiP [], which binds to chitin, partners
  with OsCERK1 (a LysM RLK with an RD kinase domain), to transduce the innate immune
  response []. The chaperone complex of Hop/Sti1-Hsp90 facilitates the maturation
  and transport of OsCERK1 []. Bacterial flagellin triggers OsFLS2-mediated immunity
  and signals through a MAPK cascade. Diverse microbial efffectors are recognized
  by NBS-LRR and other proteins in the cytosol or the nucleus. NBS-LRR-mediated cytosolic
  signaling is hypothesized to be transduced through a MAPK cascade before nuclear
  localization []. The OsRac1 GTPase can regulate NBS-LRR-mediated innate immunity
  through the RAR1-SGT1-HSP90-HSP70 cytosolic complex in rice []. The OsRac1 pathway
  activates the MAPK6-mediated MAPK cascade [,]. Pathogen effectors can also directly
  enter the nucleus to bind to NBS-LRR proteins to activate defense responses through
  regulation of TFs.
