caption: 'Innate immune evasion of hepatitis C virus infection. Multiple strategies
  to disrupt both IFN induction and response pathways are responsible for chronic
  hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during viral infection. Notably, HCV NS3/4A protease
  cleaves the adaptor proteins MAVS and TRIF, contributing to the blockage of downstream
  signaling of PKR, RIG-I and TLR3, and prevention of IFN production. HCV E2 and NS5A
  proteins suppress the function of PKR by direct binding to this kinase. IFN-β and
  IFN-λ bind to their distinct receptors and induce the formation of IFN-stimulated
  gene factor-3 (ISGF3), comprising phosphorylated STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 through the
  common JAK/STAT pathway. HCV core and other viral proteins inhibit the activation
  of STAT signaling, and therefore repress the production of ISGs. The function of
  specific ISG protein is also suppressed by HCV proteins. Additionally, the unfavorable
  IFNL3 genotype (T/T or C/T) leads to less expression of IFN-λ, which attenuates
  the antiviral effect of IFN-λ on HCV infection. MT: Mitochondria; ER: Endoplasmic
  reticulum; ES: Endosome; PAMP: Pathogen-associated molecular pattern; IRES: Internal
  ribosomal entry site; TLR: Toll-like receptor; IFN: Interferon; MAVS: Mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling; ISGs: IFN-stimulated genes; TRIF: TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing
  interferon-β.'
