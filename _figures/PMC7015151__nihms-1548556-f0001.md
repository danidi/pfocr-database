caption: 'A. Diagram of mouse T-cell developmental stages in the mouse. Cells in early
  T-cell developmental stages are called “DN” for CD4, CD8 “double negative” (in later
  stages, the cells express either or both of these markers). The most primitive cells
  in any cohort of DN cells are Early T-cell Precursors (ETPs: Kit+ CD44+ CD25−),
  then DN2a (Kit++ CD44+ CD25+), DN2b (Kitint CD44+ CD25+), and DN3a (Kitlow CD44low
  CD25+ CD28−). If and only if TCR gene recombination happens successfully in DN3a
  cells so that a TCR protein can be expressed, the cells can differentiate further
  in the T cell pathway. Cells successfully expressing a TCRβ chain through a process
  dependent on Rag1, Rag2, Dntt, and auxiliary signaling molecules (CD3γ, δ, ε and
  others) proceed to CD4+ CD8+ (DP) stage, when both chains of the αβ TCR are first
  expressed, and then to other stages beyond the scope of this review.B. Simplified
  summary of expression patterns of regulatory genes and cytokine receptors through
  early T-cell developmental stages until full TCR expression. Approximate “on” and
  “off” states are depicted; more quantitative modulation occurs for some factors.C.
  Schematic contrasting the expression patterns of PU.1, Bcl11b, and E proteins relative
  to T-cell lineage commitment. Vertical axis approximates log scale values (~100
  fold range). “E proteins”: combination of E2A (stably expressed) with HEB (moderately
  increasing during T-cell specification). Expression patterns of TCF1 (Tcf7) and
  Runx1 are also shown.C. Venn diagrams showing the independent but intersecting effects
  of PU.1, Bcl11b, and E proteins (E2A and/or HEB) relative to each other as determined
  by genome-wide transcriptome analysis in acute stage-specific gene knockout experiments.
  Left panel, dark purple intersection: genes repressed by all three factors are enriched
  for innate lymphoid program genes. Data for PU.1, from [] Table S5, represent effects
  of acute PU.1 deletion in adult bone marrow-derived DN2a-DN2b cells. Data for Bcl11b,
  from [] Table S3, represent genes that are significantly differentially expressed
  in at least two of three Bcl11b gene knockout protocols used in adult intrathymic
  or adult bone marrow-derived DN2b-DN3 cells. Data for E proteins represent the effects
  of a double knockout of E2A and HEB (Tcf3 and Tcf12) using Il7r-Cre in fetal ETP
  cells from [](GSE95337). Note that fetal ETPs precociously express many genes that
  are only expressed in more advanced adult pro-T cells, as well as genes expressed
  in adult ETPs [,,].'
