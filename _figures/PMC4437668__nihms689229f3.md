caption: 'Adrenal-derived C19 steroids act as precursors for the production of more
  potent androgens in peripheral tissues, including hair follicles, genital skin and
  prostate. The classical pathway for bioactive androgen synthesis, as well as a proposed
  alternative pathway using 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione (11OHA) is shown. Abbreviations:
  A4, androstenedione; T, testosterone; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; 11OHT, 11β-hydroxytestosterone;11OHDHT,
  11β-hydroxyDHT; STS, sulfatase; HSD3B, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases; HSD17,
  17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases; SRD5A, 5α-reductase type A.'
