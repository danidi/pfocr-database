caption: 'A: In young subjects, neuronal FKBP1b exerts strong tonic inhibitory effects
  on two pathways, the Ca2+regulatory pathway and the mTOR signaling pathway. In the
  Ca2+regulatory pathway, FKBP1b inhibits cytosolic Ca2+ rises generated by extracellular
  influx via L-VGCCs (1) and intracellular release from RYRs (2), by inhibiting both
  channel types directly (3 & 4). In the mTOR pathway, FKBP inhibition of mTOR (5)
  helps maintain the balance between growth-stimulating and autophagy-suppressing
  effects of mTOR. B: With aging (mimicked by FKBP1b knockdown), a decline of FKBP1b
  expression/function leads to weakened inhibition of both pathways, and concomitant
  increases in both Ca2+ and mTOR signaling. Increased Ca2+signaling results in dampened
  neuronal excitability and function, whereas mTOR disinhibition leads to aberrant
  increases in growth signaling as well as decreased autophagy. C: Rapamycin in young
  subjects exerts opposite effects on FKBP inhibition in the two pathways, mimicking
  aging’s effect of weakened FKBP inhibition in the Ca2+pathway (B), but paradoxically
  augmenting FKBP inhibition of the mTOR pathway (C). (From )'
