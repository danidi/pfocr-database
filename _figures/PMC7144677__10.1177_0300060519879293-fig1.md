caption: Signaling within the developing limb bud relevant to etiologies of split-hand/foot
  malformation (SHFM) with possible associated hearing loss. The figure is oriented
  from proximal (left) to distal (right). Blue font denotes signaling thought to occur
  within the apical ectodermal ridge. (ΔNp63α is a transcriptional regulator protein.)
  Types of SHFM associated with hearing loss in this pathway are listed in red. See
  Kantaputra and Carlson (2018) for a thorough review.
