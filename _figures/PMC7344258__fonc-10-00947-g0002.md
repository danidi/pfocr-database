caption: Cysteine transport and catabolism ensures cell functioning- new cues on metabolism
  based therapies. In a cyst(e)ine rich tumor microenvironment, cancer cells express
  high levels of cyst(e)ine transporters and the catabolism of cysteine is activated
  by the action of cystathionine β-synthase (CBS); cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), or
  3-mercapto-pyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST), which works together with cysteine
  aminotransferase (CAT). De novo synthesis of cysteine (transsulfuration pathway—TSP)
  will be diminished and the syntheses of serine (serine synthesis pathway—SSP) and
  glycine will supply the one-carbon metabolism (folate and methionine cycles), in
  order to support the synthesis of nucleotides and methyl groups, respectively, needed
  for cell proliferation and epigenetic regulation. Serine-derived glycine together
  with cysteine and glutamate constitute the glutathione molecule, crucial for the
  maintenance of the redox state needed for cellular metabolic functioning. Glutamate
  itself can be cysteine-derived, since α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) results from cysteine
  degradation and is directly converted into glutamate. Cysteine as a source of pyruvate
  contributes for biomass production, through the TCA cycle and the syntheses of FA
  and AA. Cysteine-derived pyruvate can be a substrate to produce glucose through
  gluconeogenesis, making a bridge between cysteine and glucose-dependent pathways,
  as phosphate pentose pathway (PPP). Electron donors generated in the metabolic pathways
  and cysteine-derived H2S contributes to oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production.
  The inhibition of cysteine uptake and catabolism will affect the metabolic pathways
  dependent on cysteine. TSP will be activated but without the uptake of cysteine,
  the ability to maintain the glutathione levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  scavenging capacity will be decreased. The augment of the oxidative stress will
  induce DNA, membranes and mitochondria damages and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
  Ultimately cell injury and death will be triggered.
