caption: The mechanism of immune rejection caused by major histocompatibility complex
  (MHC) mismatch. The immune response post pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte
  (PSC-CM) transplanted is initiated by the mismatch of MHC class I and class II between
  the graft and the host T cells. If the graft is recognized as a foreign object,
  these T cells will initiate a series of reactions, including the classical CD4 pathway
  and secondary reaction, such as helper T cell (Th)1, Th2, Th17, cytotoxic T cells
  and regulate T cells-mediated cytokines. During the immune response, Treg also activate
  to prevent excessive activation immune cells to attack host cells. APC, antigen-presenting
  cell; CD4+, helper CD4+ T cells; CD8+, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells; FOXP3, forkhead box
  P3; G-CSF, granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hPSC-CM, human pluripotent stem
  cells derived cardiomyocyte; IFN-γ, interferon gamma; IL, interleukin; MHC, major
  histocompatibility complex; NK cell, natural killer T cell; TGF-β, transforming
  growth factor beta; Th, helper T cell; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; Treg, regulatory
  T cells.
