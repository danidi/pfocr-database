caption: Megakaryopoiesis is regulated at multiple stages via cytokines (blue). In
  the classical pathway, megakaryopoiesis begins with thrombopoietin signaling via
  it’s receptor c-mpl (red), which is expressed throughout every differentiation stage;
  from the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) through to platelets produced from the mature
  megakaryocyte (MK). Various lineage fate decisions lead to the upregulation of transcription
  factors and consequent surface receptor expression, which are currently used to
  define a committed, mature MK. Expression of GATA1/FOG1 and FLI-1 lead to expression
  of CD41 (orange), CD42b (grey) and GPIX (grey), respectively. The expression of
  RUNX1 and NFE2 are crucial in terminal maturation processes, including polyploidization
  (upregulation of MYH10, downregulation of MYH10 and Notch4) and cytoskeletal rearrangement
  (expression of Tubulin B1 (green)). In addition to TPO, other cytokines have been
  found to affect megakaryopoiesis, both in a TPO-dependent (IL-1β, IL-3, IL-6, YRSACT)
  and independent fashion (IL-1α, CCL5 IGF-1).
