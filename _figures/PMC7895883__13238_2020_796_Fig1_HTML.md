caption: Negative (blue) or positive (pink) regulation of TET2 in the inflammatory
  immune responses and related diseases. During the onset of innate immune response,
  CXXC5 recruits TET2 to maintain low 5mC level of CpG islands of Irf7 gene, which
  promotes IRF7 expression to activate type I IFN production for initiating anti-viral
  immune response. Besides, TET2 binds to the mRNA 3′-UTR of Socs3 and inhibits its
  5mC level, which promotes the degradation of Socs3 mRNA through ADAR1 and thereby
  facilitates infection-induced myelopoiesis. As to the resolution phase of inflammation,
  TET2, whose expression is promoted via IL-1R-MyD88 pathway, downregulates the expression
  of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β through recruiting HDACs for histone deacetylation
  in innate myeloid cells and macrophages respectively. Loss of TET2 in tumor-associated
  macrophages results in increased expression of inflammatory cytokines as well as
  decreased expression of ARG1. In addition, TET2 regulates the differentiation of
  regulatory T cells (Treg) and smooth muscle cells (SMC), thus acting as the repressor
  of type I diabetes and atherosclerosis
