caption: Linked series of state machine diagrams for the IL-1 stimulated NF-κB signalling
  pathway. The individual components have their own state machines, which are explicitly
  linked using UML join notations and embedded within a single large state machine
  that represents the cell. Here the cell has two states relating to dormant or active.
  Developed using [, , , , –].
