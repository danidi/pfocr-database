caption: Mechanism of PNS protects ER stress–induced cell death. TG inhibits Ca2+
  re-uptake from ER to cytosol through SERCA2 and thereby elevates intracellular concentration
  and mitochondrial calcium uptake. TG disturbs the calcium homeostasis and causes
  protein-folding dysfunction, and thus, the accumulated misfolded/unfolded proteins
  (e.g. BiP and CHOP) induce ER stress. Prolonged TG treatment initiates the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway by permeabilizing the mitochondrial membrane and thus releasing
  cytochrome c and AIF to cytosol, resulting in apoptosome formation and leading to
  activation of caspase-3. PNS pretreatment significantly reduced upregulation of
  BiP, CHOP, and Cleaved caspase-3 induced by TG. PNS reduced the elevation of cytosolic
  calcium transients, mitochondrial calcium uptake, as well as ER calcium release
  in response to either TG or histamine. PNS decreases the RyR2 expression, and PNS
  prevention of ER stress and associated apoptosis is mediated by RyR2 expression.
  These results suggest that by the intermediary through regulation of intracellular
  calcium homeostasis, especially suppression of ER calcium release mediated by RyR2
  and thus inhibition of the cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium overload, PNS therefore
  protected against ER stress–induced cell death. AIF, apoptosis inducing factor.
