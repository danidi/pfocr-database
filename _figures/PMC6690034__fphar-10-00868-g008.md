caption: Potential molecular mechanism involved in luteoloside treatment on NP cells.
  IL-1β stimulation promotes inflammation response, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix
  (ECM) degradation through activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. Luteoloside treatment
  attenuated IL-1β-induced apoptosis through Nrf2 activation and attenuated inflammation
  response and ECM degradation in NP cells via suppressing NF-κB activity by Nrf2/HO-1
  pathway.
