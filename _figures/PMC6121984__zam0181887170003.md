caption: Metabolic model of d-galacturonate catabolism in anaerobic chemostat enrichment
  cultures. Metabolic fluxes were calculated by mass balancing based on a simplified
  Wood-Ljungdahl pathway converting four H2 and two CO2 into one acetate () and d-galacturonate
  metabolism via an adapted Entner-Doudoroff pathway for galacturonate catabolism
  yielding two molecules of pyruvate (). Redox equivalents have been represented as
  [H] and could both be derived from H2 as well as NADH. Biomass (x)-specific production
  rates, given in millimoles gramx−1 hour−1, represent averages ± standard deviations
  of five sequential measurements during steady state from both biological duplicate
  bioreactors.
