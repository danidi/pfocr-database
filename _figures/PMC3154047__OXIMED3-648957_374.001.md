caption: Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Growth factors
  activate mTORC1 through both phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI 3-K)-Akt and Ras-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ER K) mediated pathways. Activation of Akt is dependent
  upon PI 3-K. Growth factors or cytokines, can stimulate the recruitment of PI 3-K
  to the plasma membrane. Following activation, PI 3-K phosphorylates membrane glycerophospholipid
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI (4,5)P2] resulting in the production of
  phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol- 3,4-disphosphate
  (PIP2). Akt is translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane through the
  binding to PIP2 and PIP3 through its PH domain. As a result of this sequence of
  events, Akt becomes available for phosphorylation by its upstream kinases, such
  as phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Activated Akt can phosphorylate tuberous
  sclerosis complex-2 (TSC2), resulting in the disruption of its interaction with
  TSC1, activation of Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) and subsequent activation
  of mTORC1. Akt can also directly phosphorylate proline rich Akt substrate 40 kDa
  (PRAS40) and reduce its binding to regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor)
  and release its suppression of mTORC1. In the ER K mediated mTORC1 activating pathway,
  ER K is activated upon Ras induced activation of mitogen activated kinase/ER K kinase
  (MEK) and then phosphorylation of TSC2 ensues. ER K also can activate the ribosomal
  S6 kinase (RSK), which phosphorylates Raptor resulting in the activation of mTORC1.
  Oxygen deprivation or hypoxia reduces cellular ATP level and stimulates AMP activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) which may induce the expression of transcriptional regulation
  of DNA damage response 1 (RE DD1), releasing TSC2 from the binding to protein 14-3-3
  and inhibiting mTORC1 activity. Similarly, cellular energy deficiency also activates
  AMPK, which phosphorylates TSC2 promoting its GTPase activating protein activity
  and turning Rheb-GTP into Rheb-GDP and subsequent inhibits mTORC1 activity. AMPK
  induced phosphorylation of Raptor on serine 722 and 792 also results in the inhibition
  of mTORC1 activity. Amino acids can induce relocalization of mTORC1 and activate
  Rag GTPase, which binds to Raptor and activates mTORC1. Upon activation, mTORC1
  phosphorylates its two major downstream targets p70 ribosome S6 kinase (p70S6K)
  and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1).
