caption: APP is synthesized in the ER and gets transported to the Golgi apparatus
  where it is packaged to vesicles (orange circles) for delivery to the cell surface
  (Step 1.). APP that does not get processed by the α-secretase in the secretary pathway
  is internalized into endosomes (Large blue circles), which are acidic compartments
  (Steps 2 and 3). BACE1 cleaves APP in the endosome to generate CTFβ, which is then
  processed to Aβ by γ-secretase within the endosome (Step 4). In neurons, a large
  fraction of the Aβ generated in this compartment is degraded by ECE and unknown
  proteases (Step 5). Aβ that escapes this pathway may be transported to the lysosome
  and degraded (Step 6). Alternatively, Aβ containing recycling vesicles (small blue
  circles) can be recycled to the cell surface either via the Golgi apparatus (Steps
  7 and 8)or directly from the endosome to the cell surface (Step 9). Aβ may be released
  from recycling vesicles to the UPS for degradation (Step 10) or get degraded at
  the cell surface by other known pathways such as NEP, IDE, MMP-9 or by other unidentified
  pathways. The Aβ that escapes degradation may be drained into the cerebrospinal
  fluid or cleared into the lymphatic or vascular circulation. Failure of all these
  redundant turnover mechanisms will lead to accumulation and aggregation of Aβ into
  SP and as CVAP.
