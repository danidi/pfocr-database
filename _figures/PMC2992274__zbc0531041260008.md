caption: Hypothetical model of morphine-induced reduction of TSP1 levels via TGFβ1
  and its impact on synapse formation. Acute morphine acts via MOR to activate EGFR
  in astrocytes. The transactivation of EGFR occurs upon MMP/ADAM-mediated release
  of EGF-like ligands from proteins either anchored to the plasma membrane or in the
  extracellular matrix (ECM). If TSP1, which contains EGF-like domains, is a substrate
  of the MMP/ADAM, it will be depleted. Upon chronic morphine treatment, phospho-ERK
  (pERK) formed by transactivation phosphorylates Ser residues of EGFR and that leads
  to its endocytosis that by ≥2 h is detectable. This down-regulation of EGFR diminishes
  TGFβ1-induced TSP1 de novo synthesis. The final outcome of the decreases in TSP1
  by limited proteolysis and inhibition of TSP1 synthesis via a different phospho-ERK
  pathway is a reduction of neurite outgrowth and synapse formation elicited by this
  gliotransmitter.
