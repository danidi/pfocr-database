caption: Model for signal transduction mechanisms regulating early, adhesion-independent,
  and late, adhesion-dependent neutrophil ROS generation. Trimeric G proteins coupled
  to fMLF receptor(s) (fMLF-R) dissociate in a β/γ heterodimer and a Gαi subunit upon
  ligand–receptor interaction. The β/γ heterodimer activates PI3Kγ that promotes formation
  of PIP3. The evidence that Ras activation and phosphorylation of the Ras downstream
  target ERK is virtually absent in PI3Kγ-deficient murine neutrophils (, ) suggests
  that activation of GEFs for Ras by PIP3 may result in activation of class IA PI3Ks.
  However, this scenario is complicated by the recent demonstration that G protein–coupled
  receptors impinge on PI3Kγ via a PLCβ/diacylglycerol/RasGRP4 pathway (blue arrows)
  that plays a key role in PI3K-dependent neutrophil responses (). Taken together,
  these findings point to the existence of a positive-feedback circuit of PI3K activation
  implicating Ras/PI3Kγ/Ras. Gαi, β-arrestin bound to the receptor–G protein complex
  or the G protein– coupled receptor directly, impinges on SFKs (, ). For the sake
  of simplicity, only the first possibility is highlighted in the drawing. Although
  mechanism of activation of SFKs by trimeric G protein–coupled receptors in neutrophils
  is still unknown, several reports pointed to a role of SFKs in signal transduction
  by this class of receptors (, , –). Activation of PI3Kγ and SFKs are both essential
  for the early activation of NADPH oxidase by fMLF, and either deficiency or inhibition
  of these kinases results in a marked or total suppression of ROS formation in murine
  or human neutrophils, respectively (, ). Because inhibitors of the class IA PI3K
  isoforms PI3Kα and PI3Kδ inhibit the early phase of ROS generation (), it is likely
  that a positive-feedback circuit triggered by PI3Kγ/Ras results in activation of
  class IA PI3Ks. Albeit, using selective inhibitors, we found that PI3Kβ plays a
  minor role in the early response to fMLF, this PI3K isoform has been implicated
  in the prolonged, late phase of ROS generation by neutrophils adhering to Aspergillus
  hyphae or immune complexes (, ). It is likely that class IA PI3Ks play a highly
  redundant role in regulation of this response. SFKs play a minor role in activation
  of class IA PI3Ks (broken arrow) in the early response to fMLF. In fact, inhibition
  of SFKs by PP2 in human, or deficiency of Hck, Fgr, and Lyn in murine, neutrophils
  only slightly inhibits, or has no effect on, phosphorylation of the PI3K downstream
  target AKT, respectively (). SFK inhibition () or deficiency () result in a total
  or marked reduction of ROS generation. One important target of SFKs is the Vav family
  of GEFs for Rac. Inhibition of SFKs by PP2 in human, or deficiency of Hck, Fgr,
  and Lyn in murine, neutrophils results in a total inhibition of Vav phosphorylation
  (). Following interaction with chemoattractants, TNF, or other cytokines, neutrophils
  generate ROS in a fashion characterized by lateness and β2 integrin dependency ().
  This response is totally independent of PI3Kγ (, ), and requires class IA PI3Ks
  and SFKs (, ). SFKs regulate class IA PI3Ks in the course of this response (, )
  and are essential for phosphorylation of Vav proteins ().
