caption: Cellular mechanisms regulating steady-state and (chronic) stress erythropoiesis.
  In steady-state erythropoiesis, erythroid proliferation, differentiation and survival
  is primarily dependent on EpoR/Jak2/Stat5 signaling and iron-dependent IRE/IRP modulation
  (A). In (chronic) stress erythropoiesis, the expansion of stress erythroid progenitors
  is regulated by several other mechanisms in addition to the EpoR/Jak2/Stat5 pathway.
  This includes BMP4 signaling through SMAD4 and SCF/c-kit signaling through Akt/Erk,
  which are both dependent on oxygenation, possibly via HIFs; pIgA1-mediated transferrin
  receptor 1 (TfR1) activation which stimulates Akt/Erk and potentiates EpoR/Stat5
  signaling; glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling via ZFP36L2; and the desert Hedgehog
  (Dhh) pathway, which inhibits the response. Moreover, there is a regulating role
  of the microenvironment through Notch2 signaling, which stimulates switching of
  early progenitors towards the erythroid lineage, as well as macrophage-associated
  regulation, which stimulate erythropoiesis through a currently unknown mechanism
  (B).
