caption: Regulation of enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by FXR. FXR regulates
  the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in the hepatocyte and enterocyte. After
  a meal, bile is released from the gallbladder into the duodenum. Bile acid re-uptake
  in the ileum is mediated by ASBT in the brush border membrane. In the enterocyte,
  FXR induces the expression of OSTα/β, which mediate bile acid transport from the
  enterocyte into the portal circulation to hepatocytes where they are taken up via
  NTCP. In the hepatocyte, FXR induces the expression of BSEP, which mediates bile
  acid excretion into bile. Negative feedback on the enterohepatic circulation of
  bile acid is mediated by SHP, which is induced by FXR and inhibits CYP7A1 and NTCP
  in the hepatocyte, and ASBT in the enterocyte. Alternatively, in the endocrine pathway,
  FXR in the enterocyte induces the expression and secretion of FGF15/19, which binds
  in the liver to the FGFR4/βKlotho receptor complex and in turn activates JNK and
  ERK signaling pathways. Activation of the JNK and ERK pathways results in repression
  of CYP7A1 and stabilization of SHP by inhibition of its proteasomal degradation,
  respectively.
