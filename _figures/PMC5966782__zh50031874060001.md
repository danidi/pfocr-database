caption: 'Glucose catabolism. Upon transport into the cell, glucose is subject to
  the following two major pathways for metabolism: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), in which G6P appears at the crossroads of these pathways. There are
  three rate-limiting steps, catalyzed by hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK),
  and pyruvate kinase (PK), which converts glucose into pyruvate. Glycolysis is a
  major pathway for glucose metabolism, in which pyruvate can be converted into lactate
  by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or be transported into mitochondria by mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier (MPC) to fuel ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation through
  the electron transport chain (ETC). The PPP divides into the oxidative and nonoxidative
  branches, which the oxidative branch generates reducing equivalents in the form
  of NAPDH, while the nonoxidative branch produces ribose-5-phosphate (R5P). The PPP
  can feed back glycolysis at the levels of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3PG) and fructose-6-phosphate
  (F6P) (solid arrows). The 3PG metabolite can be used for the de novo synthesis of
  serine and glycine, which provides the essential precursors for the synthesis of
  proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids (dashed arrows). 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; 3PHP,
