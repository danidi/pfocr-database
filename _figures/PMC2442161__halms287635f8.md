caption: Model of the molecular pathways and their potential interactions involved
  during the development of the pyloric sphincter. Schematic representations of avian
  stomach (left panel) and the molecular pathways involved (right panel). The avian
  stomach can be divided in proventriculus (glandular stomach) and gizzard (muscular
  stomach). The pyloric sphincter is a highly conserved structure found in all vertebrates
  and anatomically separates the gizzard and the duodenum. Shh from epithelium induces
  Bmp4 expression in the adjacent mesenchyme, except in the gizzard where Bapx1 prevents
  Bmp4 expression. In the small intestine, Bmp4 activates the BMP signaling pathway
  in the mesoderm and endoderm (unpublished data). In the pyloric sphincter, Bmp4
  is able to activate the expressions of Nkx2.5 and Sox9, which are both sufficient
  to induce pyloric epithelial phenotype through mesenchymal-epithelial signal modulation.
  Importantly, our data show that there is no cross-regulation between Sox9 and Nkx2.5
  at the transcriptional level. SOX9 is able to control Gremlin expression in the
  pyloric sphincter mesenchyme. Gremlin, a diffusible factor, could modulate endodermal
  BMP pathway activation, in order to induce specific pyloric epithelium differentiation.
