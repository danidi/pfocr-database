caption: Rationale of metabolic interactions between photorespiration and S assimilation
  in plant leaves. This simplified scheme shows why photorespiration could be beneficial
  to sulfur assimilation. Photorespiration drives the production of serine that is
  used to synthesize cysteine de novo. In addition, photorespiration involves C1 metabolism
  from which methyl-tetrahydrofolate (H4F) can be used to synthesize methionine de
  novo. OAS O-acetylserine, PEPC phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, PGA 3-phosphoglycerate,
  RuBP ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, SAM S-adenosyl methionine, SMM S-methylmethionine,
  TCAP tricarboxylic acid pathway (“Krebs cycle”). For simplicity, the SAM-SMM cycle
  that can reform methionine is not shown
