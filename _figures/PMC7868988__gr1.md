caption: 'Schematic overview of the main cellular pathways regulated by NNMT. Schematic
  illustration of the reactions catalyzed by NNMT and the chemical transactions taking
  place in the methionine cycle and in the NAD+ salvage pathway. NNMT directly links
  the methionine cycle with the cell''s methylation balance and NAD+ levels. In adipose
  tissue, in cancer cells and in hESCs, NNMT function is principally mediated by its
  methyltransferase activity (light blue boxes), while NNMT hepatic and endothelial
  functions are generally methyltransferase-independent (green boxes). Additionally,

  pathway. NNMT also regulates NAD + metabolism. Red arrows indicate the most representative
  variations associated with NNMT overexpression. The structural formulas of the major
  substrates are shown along with their abbreviated names (in bold). Enzymes catalyzing
  the reaction steps of the NAD+ salvage pathway and the methionine cycle are also
  indicated, and abbreviations of the enzymes and substrates not previously mentioned
  in the text are as follows: AHCY: S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, MS: Methionine
  synthase, MAT: methionine adenosyltransferase, NAMPT: nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase,
  NMNAT: nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase. PARPs and CD38 are other
  NAD+-consuming enzymes that compete with sirtuins for NAD+ availability. The major
  metabolic pathways that feed both the methionine and the NAD+ cycles are also illustrated.
