caption: (A) Schematic of the adult hermaphrodite distal germline. The distal end
  of the germline is capped by a somatic distal tip cell (DTC). Progenitor zone cells
  are shown in green; meiotic prophase cells are in red. Dashed line indicates the
  progenitor zone–meiotic prophase boundary, the operationally defined point of meiotic
  entry []. GLP-1 signaling maintains germline stem cell fate and GLP-1 mediated transcription
  occurs in the distal most ~5 cell diameters (cd) of the germline [,]. LST-1 and
  SYGL-1 protein are observed in the distal most 5 or 10 cell diameters, respectively
  []. (B) Genetic pathway controlling the stem cell fate vs meiotic development decision
  in the distal end of C. elegans germline. GLP-1 signaling acts, at least in part,
  through transcriptional targets lst-1 and sygl-1 to repress the GLD-1, GLD-2 and
  SCFPROM-1 meiotic entry pathways (reviewed in []). GLP-1(ICD), GLP-1 intracellular
  domain.
