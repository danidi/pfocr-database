caption: 'There are three basic pathways of ruminal methane production: (1) represents
  the CO2-H2 reduction pathway, (2) represents the synthesis pathway of short chain
  fatty acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, and butyric acid as substrates, and
  (3) represents the synthesis pathway with methyl compounds such as methanol and
  ethanol as substrates. Among these, route (1) is considered to be the primary route
  of methane production.'
