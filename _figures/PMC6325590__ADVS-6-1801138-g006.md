caption: Leptin signaling modulates appetite through primary cilia. The arcuate nucleus
  is composed of different types of ciliated neurons, including anorexigenic neurons
  expressing POMC and orexigenic neurons expressing AgRP. If leptin binds to its receptor
  in ciliated neurons, the transcription of POMC and AgRP is increased and decreased,
  respectively, through the JAK‐STAT3 pathway. αMSH, cleaved from POMC, also acts
  as the anorexigenic neuropeptide. MC4R, a common receptor for αMSH and AgRP, and
  ADCY3 are localized in ciliated PVN neurons expressing SIM1. αMSH and AgRP activate
  and inhibit MC4R, respectively. ADCY3 is bound to Gs in primary cilia. Inhibition
  of Gs in SIM1‐expressing neurons is sufficient to cause obesity.
