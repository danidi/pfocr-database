caption: Intestinal free ferric (Fe3+) iron is reduced to Fe2+ by DCTB and enters
  the cell through the divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (DMT1) and possibly other
  carriers. Dietary heme is directly absorbed and iron is released by heme oxygenase
  (HMOX). Iron exits the enterocyte through the iron export channel ferroportin (FPN).
  After oxidization by hephaestin (HEPH) iron binds to transferrin (Tf) in the bloodstream
  which binds to transferrin receptors (TfR)-1 and -2 on the surface of target cells.
  In most cells, after endocytosis of TfR1 and acidification of the endosome, iron
  is released, reduced by STEAP, and enters the cytosol through DMT1 where it is used
  (e.g. for heme or Fe-S-cluster synthesis in the mitochondrion) or if in excess,
  sequestered by ferritin. Ferritin secreted into the blood serves as a marker for
  tissue iron stores. In the liver, Tf binds TfR 2 and the protein HFE, and in concert
  with signaling via GPI-anchored protein hemojuvelin (HJV), bone morphogenic proteins
  (BMP) and the SMAD signal transduction pathway, production of hepcidin is signaled.
  Hepcidin induces internalization and degradation of FPN, thus completing a negative
  feedback regulatory loop.
