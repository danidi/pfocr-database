caption: Signaling pathways of autophagy. PI3K produces PIP3 after stimulation. PIP3
  forms a docking site containing proteins PDK1 and Akt. When Akt is activated, TSC2
  dissociates from TSC1, which improves GTP-Rheb activity and subsequently increases
  mTORC1 activity. Akt also activates mTORC1 by regulating PRAS40 activity. mTORC1
  inhibits ULK1/2 complex activation, causing a decrease in autophagosomes. AMPK regulates
  the TSC2/TSC1 complex, activating autophagy in contrast to Akt. AMPK also phosphorylates
  RAPTOR to inhibit mTORC1 activity. AMPK is involved in the regulation of class III
  PI3K complexes. It modifies VPS34 affinity and phosphorylates Beclin 1 to promote
  autophagosome formation. HIF-1 can mediate BNIP3/BNIP3L to promote the separation
  of Beclin 1 from Bcl-2, thus allowing Beclin 1 to participate in autophagosome formation.
  HIF-1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy through ROS activation. In contrast,
  PPAR-γ enhances Bcl-2 overexpression and inhibits autophagy occurrences. In addition,
  HIF-1 and ROS can also activate autophagy by regulating the expression of tumor
  protein p53. NF-κB activates autophagy by inhibiting mTOR activity and promoting
  Beclin 1 expression. UPR initiated by endoplasmic reticulum stress can mediate autophagy
  through the PERK/eIF2α and Ire1/TRAF2/JNK signaling pathways. ROS can also regulate
  autophagy through the ER stress-mediated PERK pathway. Furthermore, accumulated
  ROS can induce Nrf2 and FOXO3 expression, subsequently activating p62 and LC3/BNIP3,
  respectively. Atg4 is regulated by ROS to promote autophagosome formation.

  description: Signaling pathways of autophagy. PI3K produces PIP3 after stimulation.
    PIP3 forms a docking site containing proteins PDK1 and Akt. When Akt is activated,
    TSC2 dissociates from TSC1, which improves GTP-Rheb activity and subsequently
    increases mTORC1 activity. Akt also activates mTORC1 by regulating PRAS40 activity.
    mTORC1 inhibits ULK1/2 complex activation, causing a decrease in autophagosomes.
    AMPK regulates the TSC2/TSC1 complex, activating autophagy in contrast to Akt.
    AMPK also phosphorylates RAPTOR to inhibit mTORC1 activity. AMPK is involved in
