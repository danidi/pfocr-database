caption: Mechanisms underlying sex-associated function of epithelial STAT3 signaling
  in K-ras mutant lung cancer. Our findings suggest that there is a differential regulation
  of NF-κB activation in K-ras mutant STAT3-deficient lung epithelium within sex,
  and estrogen signaling plays a protective role in females by reducing the activation
  of NF-κB pathway and subsequent induction of an anti-tumor immune response. It also
  suggests that activation of NF-κB pathway in the lung of male mice drives the tumor-promoting
  effect of STAT3 deficiency probably by induction of IL-6 and CXCL1, and subsequent
  recruitment of neutrophils and induction of a pro-tumor immunosuppressive response
