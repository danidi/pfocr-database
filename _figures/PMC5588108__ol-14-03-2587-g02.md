caption: Schematic representation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In the absence
  of Shh, PTCH1 suppresses the activity of SMO. SuFu induces proteasomal degradation
  of the GLI (glioma-associated oncogene) transcription factors. The cleaved GLI factors,
  GLI-R (GLI repressor form), translocate to the nucleus where they suppress the expression
  of Hedgehog target genes. In this setting, the pathway is turned off. In the presence
  of Shh, PTCH1 suppression of SMO is relieved, which modulates SuFu activity. SuFu
  no longer associates with the GLI transcription factors, which translocate to the
  nucleus, activating Hedgehog target genes. These include pathway effectors (GLI1)
  and regulators (PTCH1 and HIP), and proteins involved in cell proliferation (PDGRF,
  cyclin D2, BMI1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site
  1) and c-MYC). Hedgehog pathway inhibitors referred to include GDC-0449 (vismodegib),
  LDE225 (erismodegib) and itraconazole, which directly inhibit SMO. Sonic hedgehog
  ligand, Shh; patched 1, PTCH1; SMO, smoothened; SuFu, suppressor of fused; HIP,
  Hedgehog interacting protein; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor.
