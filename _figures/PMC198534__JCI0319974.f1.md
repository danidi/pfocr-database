caption: Model for IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway. IL-6 binds to its soluble receptor,
  sIL-6r, which binds to the gp130 receptor, resulting in the activation of Janus
  kinase (JAK). This leads to activation of the MAPK pathway and activation of Stat3
  by tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation. Dimerized Stat3 is able to translocate into the
  nucleus and activate gene transcription. In the liver, this process promotes liver
  regeneration, the acute-phase response, and hepatoprotection against Fas and toxic
  damage. P, phosphate.
