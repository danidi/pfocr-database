caption: The two bacterial biosynthetic pathways to branched α-glucan (glycogen).
  (a) The well known GlgA-dependent pathway uses ADP-glucose (ADPG) as the building
  block for the polymerase (for example in E. coli). (b) The configuration of the
  pathway in M. tuberculosis, which lacks GlgA. The recently discovered GlgE pathway
  uses α-maltose-1-phosphate (M1P) as the building block for the polymerase. One route
  to this building block is via GlgM (GT4), a homologue of GlgA (GT5). G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  G1P, glucose-1-phosphate; UDPG, UDP-glucose; T6P, trehalose-6-phosphate. The figure
  is adapted from Koliwer-Brandl et al. (2016).
