caption: 'Schematic representation of heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthetic pathway.
  In the elongation stage, polymerization of the heparin/heparan sulfate chains is
  made by activities of polymerases (α-UDP-GlcNAc-glycosyltransferase and α-UDP-GlcA-glycosyltransferase)
  and thereafter by N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) combined with the sulfate
  donor PAPS (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate). This process starts on a tetrasacchaide
  primer attached to a serine residue in the protein core. In the modification stage,
  C5-Epi (epimerase), 2-OST, 6-OST, and 3-OST (2-, 6- and 3-O-sulfotransferases) catalyze
  respectively the conversion of GlcA into IdoA, 2-sulfation at the IdoA, 6-sulfation
  at the GlcNS, and 3-sulfation at the GlcNS6S units. Heparin/heparan sulfate bears
  the same machinery of biosynthesis, varying only at the extensions of the reactions:
  heparin is much more processed than heparan sulfate.'
