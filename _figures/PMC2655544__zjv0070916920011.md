caption: Schematic representation of the potential consequences of the presence of
  KSHV-induced ANG for the infected endothelial cell population. KSHV infection induces
  signal pathway activation leading to viral entry, nuclear delivery of the genome,
  and viral gene expression necessary for the activation of several growth factors,
  cytokines, and angiogenic factors (). ANG is one of the angiogenic factors, and
  the results presented here demonstrate that it could act either in an autocrine
  fashion on the same infected cell or in a paracrine fashion on neighboring infected
  or uninfected cells to elicit multiple responses, including 45S rRNA synthesis,
  antiapoptosis, cell proliferation, VEGF-C expression, and tube formation mediated
  both by ANG and VEGF. In addition, ANG also interacts with infected cell surface
  actin to activate uPA, which is responsible for the plasmin generation required
  for the dissolution of basement membrane, cell migration, and tube formation. Collectively,
  the data strongly indicate a critical role for ANG in KSHV infection of endothelial
  cells and that this effect could be influencing the angioproliferative nature of
  KS lesions.
