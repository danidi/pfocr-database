caption: Schematic represents regulatory molecules involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome
  degradation pathway of BCR-ABL protein. Both c-CBL and CHIP are E3 ligases of BCR-ABL,
  except that c-CBL mediates the degradation of mature BCR-ABL protein while CHIP
  mediates the immature BCR-ABL protein degradation. Newly synthesized BCR-ABL protein
  is chaperoned by Hsc70 for stabilization, this process is promoted by BAG1. However,
  BAG1 also can lead immature BCR-ABL protein into proteasome and promote CHIP-mediated
  BCR-ABL protein degradation via proteasome system. BCR-ABL protein is chaperoned
  by HSP90 for further maturation and function, MUC-1 and SHP-2 act as HSP90's co-chaperones
  to stabilize BCR-ABL protein. HSP90 inhibitors disrupt the interaction between HSP90
  and BCR-ABL protein or switch the BCR-ABL-associated chaperone complex from HSP90
  to HSP70, and all these inhibitors can promote c-CBL- and/or CHIP-mediated BCR-ABL
  protein proteasome degradation. Additionally, PP2A can activate SHP-1 to dephosphorylate
  BCR-ABL protein residues, which can make BCR-ABL protein be prone to proteasome-mediated
  degradation.
