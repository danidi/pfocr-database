caption: Schematic diagram depicting the likely cellular events through which melatonin
  recovers mitochondrial homeostasis via the AMPK/ER stress pathway under H2O2 exposure,
  resulting in BMSC survival. ER stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction plays an
  important role in BMSC oxidative stress injury. Melatonin treatment reduces BMSC
  damage and improves cell functions after H2O2 insult. Such cytoprotective effects
  seem to be largely due to the attenuation of ROS overproduction and the maintenance
  of mitochondrial homeostasis, which involves AMPK/ER stress signaling pathways,
  subsequently leading to the inhibition of cell apoptosis
