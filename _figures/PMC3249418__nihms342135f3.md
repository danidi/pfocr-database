caption: 'Migration of marginal zone precursor B cells regulated by type I interferon
  (IFN) and IL-17. This figure depicts our current view on the migration and migration
  arrest of CD86hi antigen-bearing marginal zone precursor B cells. Our results suggest
  that type I IFN produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the marginal
  zone (MZ) provides a signal to upregulate CD69. This downregulates S1P1 and the
  S1P chemotactic response to favor the CXCL13-induced follicular entry of marginal
  zone precursor B cells. A second action in the germinal center (GC) results from
  production of CXCL13 by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). CXCR5 is highly expressed
  on marginal zone precursors and CXCL13 from FDCs can attract these B cells into
  an active developing GC. A third action comes from IL-17 produced by T helper 17
  cells (TH17) that were in the GC region. IL-17 signals through the NF-κB pathway
  in B cells to upregulate RGS. This locks the marginal zone precursor B cells into
  their position in the GC FDC region to interact with effector CXCR5+ CD4 T cells.
  Thus, the formation of spontaneous GCs in the spleens of BXD2 mice is highly associated
  with localized imbalance of cytokines that are normally invoked during immune responses.
  Such coupled effects of cytokines on different cells at different anatomic locations
  within a lymphoid organ may result in responses that are not predicted by the analysis
  of the effects the isolated cytokines on stationary cells (Ag: antigen; FDC: follicular
  dendritic cells; MZ: marginal zone; pDC: plasmacytoid dendritic cells; Rgs: regulators
  of G-protein signaling; S1P: sphingosine-1- phosphate; TH-17: T helper 17 cells)'
