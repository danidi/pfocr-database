caption: Overview of the response to unfolded proteins in the intermembrane space
  (IMS) in mammals. ROS, produced by stressed mitochondria, activate protein kinase
  B (AKT), which consequently phosphorylates estrogen receptor α (ERα). Activated
  ERα then induces IMS protein quality control by increasing the activity of proteasome
  26S and inducing the transcription of IMS protease HTRA2 and mitochondrial regulator
  NRF1.
