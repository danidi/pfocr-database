caption: Contribution of Arid5a in IL-6 production and disease. The innate immune
  response is generated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are recognized
  by pathogen recognition receptors and lead to expression of proinflammatory mediators.
  For example, toll-like receptor 4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide and activates the
  IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. The IKK complex phosphorylates Regnase-1 and also promotes
  transcription of Il-6 and Arid5a. Regnase-1 binds to the Il-6 mRNA and degrades
  it. In the nucleus, Arid5a binds to genes encoding transcription factors, such as
  Ppar-γ2, to inhibit their expression. Furthermore, Arid5a is shuttled to the cytoplasm
  under inflammatory conditions where it interferes with the destabilizing effect
  of Regnase-1. Arid5a is involved in Il-6 mRNA stabilization, and the resulting increase
  in IL-6 production is associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases.
