caption: Potential mechanism involved in increasing luteoprotective PGE2 level and
  the PGE2:PGF2α ratio during the maternal recognition of pregnancy in the pig - involvement
  of estradiol-17β, PGE2 and endometrial PGE2 receptors (PTGER2) in PGE2 positive
  feedback loop in the porcine endometrium.The primary conceptus signal, E2 and another
  conceptus factor - PGE2 regulate the protein expression of endometrial PG synthesis
  pathway enzymes to favor production of luteoprotective PGE2. E2 up-regulates PTGS2
  and PGE synthase protein expression and down-regulates endometrial PGFS and CBR1
  protein concentrations increasing PGE2 secretion and the PGE2:PGF2α ratio. PGE2
  acts through endometrial PTGER2 receptor, activates cAMP signaling pathway and elevates
  the mRNA and protein expression of enzymes involved in PGE2synthesis (PTGS2 and
  mPGES-1) and its own secretion in the endometrium.
