caption: Pathways involved in the pathogenesis of dystrophic muscle. An absence of
  dystrophin leads to the compensatory up-regulation of actin cytoskeletal signaling
  and ILK pathway activation to reduce contraction-induced injury in skeletal muscle.
  In parallel, reduced mitochondrial function, along with disturbances in calcium
  homeostasis, exacerbate the disease phenotype.
