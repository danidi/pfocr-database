caption: S1P is synthesized intracellularly by sphingosine kinase –catalyzed phosphorylation
  of sphingosine. Note that dihydrophingosine is also a substrate for this enzyme
  which forms dihydro S1P. These dihydro derivatives lack the double bond between
  the C4 and C5 carbon atoms. S1P can be converted to sphingosine by dephosphorylation
  catalyzed by a selective S1P phosphatase or the broader specificity lipid phosphate
  phosphatases. S1P can also be degraded by S1P lyase to form hexadecenal and ethanolamine
  phosphate. The predominant pathway for the production of extracellular LPA is from
  lysophospholipids, most likely lysophosphatidylcholine by the lysophospholipase
  D activity of autotaxin. LPA is inactivated by dephosphorylation catalyzed by the
  broad specificity lipid phosphate phosphatases to form monoacylglycerol. LPA can
  also be made by phospholipase A2 catalysed hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid. Intracellularly,
  LPA can be made de novo by acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate for synthesis of di-
  and tri-glycerides and phospholipids.
