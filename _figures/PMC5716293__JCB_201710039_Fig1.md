caption: Schematic presentation of the regulation of metabolic signaling and lysosomal
  movement by the lysosome-associated Ragulator complex that consists of five LAMTOR
  subunits (LT1–5). (Top) In the absence of nutrients and growth factors, Ragulator
  activates the catabolic liver kinase B1 (LKB1)–AMPK signaling pathway via Axin scaffold
  protein and retains lysosomes in the perinuclear area by binding to the Lyspersin
  subunit of BORC, thereby inhibiting the Arl8/SKIP-mediated association of BORC and
  kinesin motors. (Bottom) In the presence of nutrients and growth factors, Axin and
  BORC dissociate from the Ragulator, which leads to the inactivation of AMPK and
  activation of BORC/Arl8/SKIP/Kinesin-mediated antegrade movement of lysosomes away
  from the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Subsequently, Ragulator is more efficient
  in promoting Rag GTPase-dependent mTORC1 activation and Mek1-dependent Erk1 activation.
  In nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 is further stimulated by amino acid sensed by
  the V-H+-ATPase and SLC38A9.
