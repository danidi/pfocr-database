caption: Mucociliary differentiation. During airway epithelial differentiation, multiciliated
  cell (MCC) and secretory cell fates are determined by Notch signaling, such that
  signal-sending cells assume the multiciliated fate and cells receptive of Notch
  signaling become secretory cells. Downstream of the Notch signaling event, nascent
  MCCs launch an MCC-specific gene expression program under the control of the EDM
  (EDF4/5, DP1, MCIDAS [multiciliate differentiation and DNA synthesis associated
  cell cycle protein]) transcriptional complex and several secondary transcription
  factors, including forkhead box J1 (FOXJ1) (inset). This turns on the expression
  of hundreds of structural and regulatory ciliary genes, and initiates the motile
  ciliogenesis pathway, which leads to the assembly of 200–300 cilia per MCC. Mature
  MCCs contain motile cilia decorated with membrane-tethered mucins. Secretory cells
  synthesize secretoglobins and mucins, and their transcriptional development program
  is reviewed by Whitsett (pp. S143–S148) ().
