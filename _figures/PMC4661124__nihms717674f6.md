caption: 1. Blood-borne vasodilatory agents (adenosine, nitric oxide, and others)
  can function through either membrane receptors (e.g., adenoside) or by diffusible
  (nitric oxide) mechanisms. 2. Intracellular second messengers including protein
  kinase A (PKA) can phosphorylate SUR2 and promote KATP channel opening. 3. It is
  not well understood how local brain ischemia/hypoxia, or local neuronal excitability,
  may also promote KATP channel opening in vivo. 4. The KATP channel promotes decreased
  intracellular Ca++, vasodilation, and increased local blood flow. 5. By contrast,
  other signals can promote vasoconstriction, including norepinephrine. 6. One pathway
  to promote smooth muscle contraction through KATP channel mechanism is the PKCe.
  7. Other brain-specific pathways including neuronal signaling may also lead to KATP
  channel closing. 8. The net effect of KATP channel closing is to increase intracellular
  Ca++, contract smooth muscle in the tunica media of arterioles, and decrease local
  blood flow. This figure incorporates information from recent reviews (,). Here we
  show cartoon depiction of the KATP channel in smooth muscle cells but it should
  be kept in mind that KATP channels have also been shown to affect endothelial cells,
  pericytes, and possibly perivascular astrocytes.
