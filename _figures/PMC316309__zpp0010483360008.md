caption: Proposed genetic pathway for the regulation of mucilage production during
  seed coat secretory cell differentiation. AP2 and a TTG1 complex with a bHLH protein
  (candidates include EGL3 and/or TT8) and a tissue-specific MYB transcription factor
  activate GL2 and TTG2. GL2 acts upstream of MUM4. In contrast, both TTG2 and MYB61
  appear to affect aspects of mucilage production independent from MUM4. For details,
  see text.
