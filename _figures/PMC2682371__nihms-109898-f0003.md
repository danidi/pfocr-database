caption: a | Inclusion of exon 26 in the intracellular domain of ErbB4 generates CYT-1,
  whereas its exclusion gives rise to CYT-2 (Refs ,). The extracellular juxtamembrane
  region of ErbB4 is encoded by either exon 16 or exon 15, to generate JMa or JMb,
  respectively. Different combinations of CYT-1, CYT-2, JMa and JMb thus create 4
  isoforms of ErbB4. Exon numbers are shown on the top of corresponding domain structures.
  b | CYT-1 contains the motif that binds to the p85 subunit of PI3K and thus activates
  this kinase. Thus, although both isoforms are coupled to the Raf–MEK–ERK pathway,
  CYT-1 but not CYT-2 activates PI3K and subsequently Akt, , . Both JMa and JMb can
  be activated by neuregulin 1 (NRG1) to initiate canonical signalling, but only JMa
  can be cleaved by tumour necrosis factor-α converting enzyme, ,  (indicated by the
  lightning arrow) to generate a soluble extracellular polypeptide, ecto-ErbB4 (which
  contains the NRG1 binding site), and a carboxy-terminal fragment (ErbB4-CTF). CRD,
  cysteine-rich domain; TK, tyrosine kinase domain; TM, transmembrane domain.
