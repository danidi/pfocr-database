caption: Regulation of the p53-MDM2-MDMX pathway by DUBs. p53 is ubiquitinated by
  MDM2, which is assisted by MDMX. MDM2 also mediates ubiquitination of MDMX and itself.
  In addition, ARF-BP1 ubiquitin ligase also mediates p53 ubiquitination. A number
  of DUBs have been shown to regulate this pathway (see text for details).
