caption: Cytokinin and auxin trigger specific components of their signalling pathways
  in the Azolla root tip. The figure shows the number of detected Arabidopsis thaliana
  cytokinin (left) and auxin (right) signalling pathway components expressed in 0.3 mm
  root tips of A. filiculoides, based on homology (e‐value < 10−7). Differential expression
  of each contig is represented by a circle (response to 0.5 μM trans‐zeatin, CK)
  and a rectangle (response to 0.1 μM IAA) which are coloured in a gradient that labels
  log2(fold change) from orange (1.2) to green (0) to blue (−1.8). Although many homologues
  for the canonical auxin signalling pathway were detected, no homologue of the SCFTIR1
  complex could be identified. Grey boxes with dotted lines encase potential isoforms.
  For all individual values, see Supporting Information Table S6. Aux, auxin.
