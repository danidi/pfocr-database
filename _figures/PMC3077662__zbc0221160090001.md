caption: Two possible models for GPI biosynthetic pathway. A, if inositol acylation
  by Gwt1p occurs on the luminal side of the ER, GlcN-PI would flip from the cytoplasmic
  face to the luminal face of the ER membrane. B, if Arv1p is a flippase, GlcN-(acyl)PI,
  rather than GlcN-PI, would flip, and in this case, Gwt1p should function on the
  cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane.
