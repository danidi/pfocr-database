caption: Radionuclides-based therapy pathway and killing of tumour cells through targeted
  alpha therapy using 177Lutetium-PSMA as an example. (A) The radionuclide (e.g.,
  177Lu-PSMA) is the radioactive isotope that releases energetic particle radiation
  such as α or β particles for therapeutic purpose. (B) The second part is a small
  peptide that is designed to bind to the cellular target of interest. The third part
  is a linker molecule that serves to connect the radionuclide with the leading peptide.
  In PRLT of PCa, 177Lutetium, a β particle-emitting radionuclide, is the most commonly
  radionuclide that is complexed to a PSMA ligand using a linker molecule. Following
  the intravenous administration of 177Lu-PSMA, the complex easily permeates into
  tumor foci with the smallness of the complex facilitating efficient penetration
  into the tumour core. (C) Following binding to the extra-cellular component of the
  PSMA receptor expressed on the tumor cell membrane, 177Lu-PSMA-receptor complex
  undergoes internalization into the tumor cell cytoplasm. (D) This allows radiation
  delivery to occur near the tumor nuclei making tumor cell killing more efficient.
  In addition to β particle emission, 177Lutetium also emits γ photons (for diagnostic
  purpose) that can be used for imaging using a single photon emission tomography
  (SPECT) imaging technique. The ability to perform imaging following the administration
  of 177Lu-PSMA for PRLT allows for the determination of the in vivo distribution
  of the therapy agent and the confirmation of the uptake of the treatment agent at
  the tumor sites. In addition, imaging the γ photons of 177Lutetium allows for the
  determination of the radiation dose delivered to the tumor foci (dosimetry).
