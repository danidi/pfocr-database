caption: The diagram illustrates catalytic steps of the thiamine biosynthesis pathway
  in P. falciparum, with 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine and 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole
  as start products and thiamine phosphate as the end product. The three enzymes predicted
  to be absent in rodent malaria parasites catalyze subsequent reactions in this pathway,
  suggesting that rodent malaria parasites are deficient in de novo synthesis of vitamin
  B1. Gene identifiers correspond to P. falciparum genes (bold) and their P. vivax
  and P. knowlesi orthologs (below). PFL1920c has a predicted but severely truncated
  ortholog in P. yoelii (PY04023). Figure based on pathway shown in the Malaria Parasite
  Metabolic Pathways (MPMP) database .
