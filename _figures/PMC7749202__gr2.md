caption: 'A schematic diagram of the ventricular tachycardia (VT) circuit (A, left
  side) and intracardiac electrograms during entrainment mapping from (B) the right
  ventricle (RV) apex, (C) left ventricle (LV) isthmus, (D) LV septum, and (E) LV
  apex. A: The VT circuit was confined to the scar and the pathway to the exit sites
  in the RV are traced by the black lines. B: Nearly concealed entrainment is seen
  with a short stimulus-QRS interval of 15 ms but a long postpacing interval (PPI)
  – tachycardia cycle length (TCL) of 240 ms. C: Concealed entrainment is seen with
  a long stimulus-QRS interval of 420 ms. The estimated PPI (calculated by the stimulus-QRS
  interval = electrograms-QRS interval law) is identical to the TCL. D: Manifest entrainment
  is seen with a long PPI-TCL of 280 ms. E: Manifest entrainment is seen with a long
  PPI-TCL of 280 ms. F: The radiofrequency energy application at site C immediately
  terminated the VT. ABL = ablation catheter; EGM = electrogram.'
