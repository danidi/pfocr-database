caption: A A heatmap showing the variation of violaxanthin, abscisic alcohol, and
  ABA across the 12 time points from endo- to ecodormancy in the flower buds of the
  extra-late Penta cultivar. Values represent the means of FC from three biological
  replicates. A dashed line marks the dormancy-release date. Asterisks show the metabolites
  whose variation meets the requirements for being considered significant. B A heatmap
  showing the variation of D-glucose, D-sorbitol, D-fructose-2-P, D-fructose-2,6-P2,
  and D-sorbitol-6-P across the eight time points from endo- to ecodormancy in the
  flower buds of the extra-early Desmayo Largueta cultivar. Values represent the means
  of FC from three biological replicates. Triangles mark the dormancy-release date.
  Asterisks show the metabolites whose variation meets the requirements for being
  considered significant
