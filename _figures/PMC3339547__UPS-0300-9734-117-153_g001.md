caption: The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. TGFβ ligands function as
  dimers and signal through type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors.
  Upon ligand binding, the receptors form heterotetrameric complexes allowing the
  type II receptors to phosphorylate and activate the type I receptors. Subsequently,
  receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads) are recruited to the type I receptors and phosphorylated.
  The activated R-Smads associate with the Co-Smad, Smad4, and this heteromeric complex
  translocates to the nucleus to participate in the transcriptional control of specific
  target genes (). TGFβ can also activate various non-Smad signaling pathways.
