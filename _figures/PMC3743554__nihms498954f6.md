caption: We show that factors secreted from activated macrophages from PON2-def mice
  are sufficient to modulate insulin signalling in hepatocytes by eliciting inhibitory
  serine phosphorylation (Ser-P) of IRS-1. Impaired insulin signalling in macrophages
  from PON2-def mice was associated with an increased production of ROS, NO, ONOO−
  and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (A). Despite a corresponding increase
  in intracellular ROS production in macrophages from PON2-def/apoE−/− mice, we observed
  a significant decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated
  with reduced serine phosphorylation and improved tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P)
  of hepatic IRS-1, relative to apoE −/− littermate controls. Evidence suggests the
  influence of decreased cellular ONOO− content on NF-κB pathway activation in macrophages
  from combined PON2-def/apoE−/− mice (B). IKK, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase; JNK, c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase.
