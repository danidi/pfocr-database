caption: Ezrin is known to promote cancer progression through various molecular mechanisms,
  as highlighted in the signaling insets. Ezrin facilitates cell migration and invasion
  through its roles in focal adhesion and invadopodia turnover and cytoskeletal remodeling
  at the primary tumor site to promote metastasis to lymph nodes; where it contributes
  to cytotoxic T cell suppression and immune evasion through a PKA-CSK-LCK signaling
  pathway associated with the T cell receptor; and to more distant organ sites such
  as the lung were it contributes to cell survival and drug resistance through effects
  on NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. These multifaceted roles for ezrin in
  cancer makes it an attractive therapeutic target, where its inhibition may suppress
  metastasis, promote anti-tumor immunity and enhance cytotoxic drug sensitivity.
