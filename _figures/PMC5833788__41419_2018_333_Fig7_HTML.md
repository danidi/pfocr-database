caption: NIT1 activates the TGFβ-Smad2/3 signalling pathway by interacting with SARA
  and SMAD3. In addition, the induction of TGFβ1 or overexpression of SMAD3 increases
  the expression levels of NIT1. We demonstrated that there is a positive feedback
  loop involving the regulation of CRC cell proliferation between NIT1 and activation
  of the TGFβ–Smad pathway. We also presented that NIT1 induces cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis, which also contribute to the growth inhibition of CRC
