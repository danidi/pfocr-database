caption: Mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in AD and PD with potential intervention
  of natural extractions. In the transcriptional NLRP3 inflammasome activation, Aβ
  recognized by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in microglia activates the myeloid differentiation
  primary response protein MyD88 (MYD88)-nuclear-factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, and α-synuclein
  recognized by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR4) and CD36 in microglia activates the Fyn
  kinase-mediated NF-κB pathway to elevate IL-1β and the NLRP3 expression. Along with
  the expression of NLRP3 following NF-κB translocation, lysosome leakage is induced
  by the phagocytosis of Aβ and α-syn resulted in the emission of cathepsin B, which
  in turn induces the NLRP3 inflammasome complex consisting of NLRP3, ASC and pro-casparase-1.
  The release of IL-1β promoted by active caspase-1 can cause a continuous inflammatory
  response that contributes to neurodegeneration in AD and PD. Meanwhile, current
  studies have shown that various natural extractions are able to prevent or treat
  in AD and PD through regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase 1/IL-1β axis.
  These natural extractions can inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia,
  thereby the secretion of IL-1β was suppressed. ACP, Antrodia comphorata; BSYZ, Bushen-Yizhi
