caption: Schematic representation depicting the influence of female sex hormones in
  the activation and subsequent function of regulatory B cells (Bregs). (A) Estradiol
  (E2), acting through estradiol receptor alpha (ERα), induces the proliferation as
  well as the production of IL-10 by regulatory B cells (Breg). In addition, E2 mediates
  the control of T cells’ activation by B cells throughout a mechanism involving PDL1/PD1
  pathway. (B) Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was proposed to induce proliferation
  of regulatory B cells. Besides, this hormone induces the production of IL-10 by
  B cells that in turn inhibit the production of TNFα by T cells. (C) Progesterone
  (P4) induces the production of the potent anti-inflammatory and Breg hallmark cytokine
  IL-10 by B cells.
