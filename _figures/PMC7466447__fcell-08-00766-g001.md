caption: Immunoregulatory functions of TEC in the TME. The gray boxes indicate TME-derived
  factors that inhibit/promote expression of mediators by TEC. (A) T cell extravasation
  into the TME starts with a multi-staged adhesion process and includes binding of
  integrins LFA1 and VLA4 on T cells to the respective ligands ICAM1 and VCAM1 on
  TEC (; ). TEC can actively downregulate gene expression of adhesion molecules (e.g.,
  ICAM1 and VCAM1) or chemostaxis themselves in order to control immune cell infiltration
  (; ). TME deriving cytokines (e.g., VEGF, ET1, EGFL7, and FGF2) inhibit TEC to upregulate
  expression of adhesion molecules and chemoattractants (e.g., CCL2, IL6, CXCL10,
  and CXCL7) (; ; ). Also, NO has been shown to inhibit adhesion molecule and cytokine
  (IL6, IL8; not shown) expression (). The intracellular cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway
  is known to enhance adhesion molecule and promote T cell infiltration (). The glycosylation
  of surface molecules (referred to as glycocalyx) modulates the adhesive properties
  of TEC and can either enhance or reduce immune cell migration (). (B) T cell activation
  starts at the TEC/TME interface. Binding of inhibitory immune checkpoints (e.g.,
  PD-1) on CD8+ cells with their ligands (e.g., PD-L1 and PD-L2) on TEC inhibits T
  cell activation and these ligands can be upregulated by TEC on proinflammatory TME
  derived factors (IFNγ and TNFα) (). STING (see above) acts T cell activating via
  IFNβ secretion (). The immunosuppressive cytosolic protein IDO1 promotes the metabolism
  of Tryp to Kyn. Kyn downstream metabolites promote Treg activation, whilst Tryp
  depletion promotes T cell apoptosis and inhibits T cell proliferation. TME derived
  type I IFN (alpha/beta) upregulate IDO1 expression by TEC (; ). (C) T cell apoptosis
  can be triggered by IDO1 depended depletion of Tryp (). Moreover, the molecule FasL
  expressed by TEC promotes CD8+ T cell apoptosis whilst sparing Treg (due to expression
  of FoxP3) and is FasL expression is upregulated in response to TME derived VEGF-A,
  IL-10 and PGE2 (). TEC, tumor endothelial cells; TME, tumor microenvironment; LFA1,

  yet they are lacking the co-stimulatory markers CD80 and CD86 required for naïve
  T cell activation, distinguishing them from professional APC (). Contrarily, CD4+
  T cells are not dependent on co-stimulation at may directly be activated by TEC
  (). TEC can actively downregulate HLA genes as immune evading strategy (), yet external
  TME-derived factors have not been specified yet.
