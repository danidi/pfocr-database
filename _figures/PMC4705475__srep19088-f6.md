caption: 'A biological network was created using the Pathway Studio 9.0 program to
  identify biological functions and disorders associated with potential candidate
  genes selected from pathogenic and likely pathogenic CNVs, and from CNVs of unknown
  significance. Out of 88 genes, 16 genes were found to be involved in direct interactions.
  3 different functional sub-networks were detected in this pathway analysis: components
  of the first sub-network related to nervous system functions are highlighted with
  a blue halo; Components of the second sub-network related to immune response are
  highlighted with a red halo; Components of the third sub-network related to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and DNA repair are highlighted with a green halo. Green arrows show
  possible direct interactions between genes.'
