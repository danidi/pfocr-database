caption: Lipid metabolism pathways in C. elegans. 16 lipid metabolism pathways are
  integrated into a lipid metabolism network. Genes were colored based on their data
  resources (see Figure ). Black arrows linked different substrates. Two continuous
  black arrows indicate that there are more than two reactions. The dashed green arrow
  was used to link different pathways. The Green circle surround linked the pathway
  name.
