caption: Proposed model of heme-induced stasis. Intravascular hemolysis in SCD leads
  to release of heme from methemoglobin S. Heme release can be blocked by haptoglobin
  or the liberated heme can be bound and removed by hemopexin. When plasma levels
  of haptoglobin and hemopexin are depleted, heme can activate TLR4 signaling at the
  EC membrane independently of LPS, but in manner similar to LPS + LPS binding protein
  that is dependent on cofactors CD14 and MyD88. TLR4 signaling, which can be inhibited
  by TAK-242, leads to the activation of NF-κB phospho-p65 and the transcription of
  NF-κB–responsive genes in ECs including VCAM-1, P-selectin, E-selectin, interleukin-1,
  interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tissue factor. TLR4 signaling also activates an
  acute stress sentinel pathway that involves PKC activation leading to the production
  of ROS by endothelial NOX and EC degranulation of WPB P-selectin and VWF to the
  cell surface. Rapid mobilization of P-selectin and VWF to the cell surface, triggers
  vaso-occlusion. Vaso-occlusion also requires the expression of NF-κB–responsive
  adhesion molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin that are chronically upregulated
  on the endothelium of transgenic sickle mice in steady state.
