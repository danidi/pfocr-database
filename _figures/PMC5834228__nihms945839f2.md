caption: Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and macroautophagy. At least two PD genes
  are thought to play roles in CMA and macroautophagy, shown here integrated into
  some of the other major vesicular transport systems in cells. α-Synuclein (red)
  is associated with several lipid structures, but particularly in vesicles coming
  from the plasma membrane. When bound to a complex of chaperones (mainly Hsc70) and
  co-chaperones, α-synuclein can be transported to the lysosome and translocated through
  a pore formed by dimerized LAMP2A and degraded. Recycling vesicles can fuse with
  endosomes that then mature, a process that includes switches of small GTPases from
  Rab5 to Rab7. Late endosomes fuse with autophagic vesicles to generate amphisomes,
  which then also target their contents to the lysosome. The endosomal system is also
  important in the sorting of proteins to the lysosome; here in blue the protease
  cathepsin D is shown maturing through the ER and Golgi via binding to mannose-6-phosphate
  that is recognized by the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR).
  A portion of CI-M6PR is recycled back to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) via the retromer
  complex (light blue). Two genes for PD, LRRK2 (shown as a dimeric protein in brown)
  and VPS35 are involved in different aspects of these mechanisms. LRRK2 can be found
  in several different vesicular structures from the TGN where it interacts with the
  PD risk factor protein Rab7L1, through several autophagic vesicles. Current data
  support the hypothesis that LRRK2 has a general inhibitory effect on autophagy.
  VPS35 is a direct component of the retromer and is reported to change interactions
  within the recycling aspect of this pathway. Although the diagram here presents
  the CMA and macroautophagy pathways as somewhat distinct, in practice they are likely
  to influence each other. For example, there is some evidence that mutant forms of
  α-synuclein and LRRK2 both inhibit CMA.
