caption: 'Effect of A. phagocytophilum infection on apoptosis pathways in ticks. Tissue-specific
  differences in response to infection are evident. In tick midguts, A. phagocytophilum
  inhibits apoptosis through up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. In tick salivary
  glands, down-regulation of porin results in the inhibition of the cytochrome c release,
  inhibiting the mitochondrially-induced intrinsic apoptosis pathway. This effect
  is balanced in part by the induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway through
  the inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FAS) proteins. Up-regulated in green, down-regulated
  in red. CASP: caspase; HK: hexokinase.'
