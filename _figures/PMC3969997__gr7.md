caption: The hypothetical signaling pathway in pathological angiogenesis regulated
  by interactions of activated VEGFR2 and EPOR. VEGFA activates VEGFR2, which then
  phosphorylates EPOR and forms an interaction with p-EPOR to exacerbate STAT3 activation
  and mediate pathological angiogenesis as seen in phase II ROP.

  Angiogenesis.
