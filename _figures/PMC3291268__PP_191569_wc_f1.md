caption: Chlamydomonas fermentative pathways under dark anoxic conditions. In wild-type
  cells (black arrows), the major fermentative products are formate, acetate, and
  ethanol, with CO2 and H2 emitted as minor products. The metabolic pathway that leads
  to the fermentative production of succinate is unveiled in the hydEF-1 mutant ()
  and is depicted in the figure in green. An increase in the production of lactate,
  which is almost undetectable in fermenting wild-type cells, has been observed in
  the pfl1 mutants (; ) and is highlighted in orange. ACK1, Acetate kinase isoform
  1; ACK2, acetate kinase isoform 2; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1, ADH2, or ADH3
  could perform this reaction; see text); ADH1, acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase;
  FDX, ferredoxin; FMR, fumarate reductase; FUM, fumarase; HYDA1 and HYDA2, two putative
  hydrogenases; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; MME4, malic
  enzyme; PAT1, phosphate acetyltransferase isoform 1; PAT2, phosphate acetyltransferase
  isoform 2; PDC3, pyruvate decarboxylase; PEPC, phosphenolpyruvate carboxylase; PFL1,
  pyruvate formate lyase; PFR1, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PYC, pyruvate
  carboxylase; PYK, pyruvate kinase. This figure was modified from .
