caption: A schematic of the effect of electro-acupuncture on the brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF)-tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) pathway in the spinal cord. After
  peripheral nerve injury, spinal microglia could transform from a quiescent state
  into an activated state, which activated the BDNF-TrkB signalling pathway and maintained
  the pathophysiological processes. Electro-acupuncture (EA) could relieve neuropathic
  pain by inhibiting the activation of spinal microglia and disrupting the BDNF-TrkB
  signalling pathway.
