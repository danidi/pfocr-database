caption: 'The Notch signaling pathway. Interaction between Notch and Delta or Jagged
  that exist on the surface of signal-sending cells triggers the cleavage of Notch
  protein by ADAM/TACE metalloproteases and γ-secretase to produce NICD. NICD moves
  to the nucleus to forms a heterotrimer with RBP-J and MAML to enhance transcription
  of target genes, such as HES1 and HES5. NICD: Notch intracellular domain, MAML:
  mastermind-like protein (co-activator), HES1: hairy and enhancer of split 1, HES5:
  hairy and enhancer of split 5.'
