caption: 'Isobutanol biosynthesis pathway in yeast S. cerevisiae. ALAC: 2-acetolactate;
  DIV: 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate; KIV: 2-ketoisovalerate. Glucose is converted to two
  molecules of pyruvate in glycolysis, generating two molecules of NADH. In the native
  pathway, after transport into mitochondria, two molecules of pyruvate are condensed
  to one molecule of 2-acetolactate (ALAC) by the Ilv2Ilv6 complex. Reduction and
  isomerization of ALAC to 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate (DIV) by Ilv5 requires redox cofactor
  NADPH. DIV is dehydrated to 2-ketoisovalerate (KIV) by Ilv3. KIV is either directly
  released into the cytosol or converted to valine in mitochondria by Bat1. After
  export into the cytosol, valine is degraded via the Ehrlich pathway to isobutanol,
  starting with a transamination to KIV by Bat2. KIV is decarboxylated to isobutyraldehyde
  by Pdc1, 5 and Aro10. Finally, isobutyraldehyde is reduced to isobutanol, generating
  one molecule of NAD(P)+. By transformation of the episomal 2µ-plasmid IsoV100, we
  overexpressed Ilv2, Ilv5 and Ilv3 in the cytosol. Simultaneous deletion of mitochondrial
  Ilv2 resulted in a cytosolic isobutanol pathway mixed with part of a mitochondrial
  pathway'
