caption: a FOXF2 can upregulate the levels of Gpr124, P-Smad 2/3, Pdgfrβ, ABCB1, SLCO2B1,
  and TNFRSF19 during the development of blood vessels in the brain, which maintains
  the integrity of the BBB. b FOXF2 could induce the expression of some lung-specific
  genes to ensure lung function, i.e. SPA, SPB, and SPC. c FOXF2 modestly stimulates
  the expression of fgf3 and dlx2b, which prevent defects in tooth buds. d FOXF2 decreases
  the levels of Foxf1, Pdgfα, Pdgfrα, myocardin, and Wnt5a while stimulating Bmp4
  expression, thus preventing excessive proliferation and metastasis of the gastrointestinal
  epithelium. e Hh and Gli tentatively stimulate FOXF2 expression in tongue development.
  f The Hh signal could indirectly stimulate FOXF2 expression, avoiding the occurrence
  of a cleft lip. g The Shh-FOXF2-Fgf18-Shh circuit controls the development of palate.
  At the same time, the levels of Ptch1 and Shox2 were attenuated in FOXF2 knockout
  mice. FOXF2 could indirectly stimulate Tgfβr3 expression and inhibit a Smad-independent
  TGF pathway namely, Traf6/Trak1/P38. h Activation of the TGF-β signalling pathway
  causes downregulation of FOXF2, which results in a cleft palate. FOXF2 tentatively
  stimulates Eya1 and Pax3 expression in developing cochlea. Protein names contain
  all uppercase letters for humans (e.g., ABCB1); all lowercase letters for zebrafish
  (e.g., fgf3); only the first letter capitalized for mice (e.g., Ptch1). ABCB1, ATP
  binding cassette subfamily B member 1; SLCO2B1, solute carrier organic anion transporter
  family member 2B1; TNFRSF19, TNF receptor superfamily member 19, dlx2b, distal-less
  homeobox 2b; Shox2, short stature homeobox 2; Ptch1, patched 1; and Pax3, paired
  box 3.
