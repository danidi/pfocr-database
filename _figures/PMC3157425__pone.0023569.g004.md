caption: p21 functional relationship with other differentially expressed genes involved
  in cell cycle progression detected in this work. A, Expression after 24 hours treatments
  with piroxicam. B, Expression after 24 hours treatments with piroxicam/cisplatin.
  For each gene the relationship and the expression (red up-regulated, green down-regulated)
  are shown. Arrows indicate the direction of the relationship.
