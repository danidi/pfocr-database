caption: Relevant metabolic pathways. (A) Our present understanding of thiamine biosynthesis
  is illustrated. Where known, the enzyme responsible for each step is indicated.
  Dotted arrows represent biochemical reactions that have not been characterized.
  (B) The biosynthetic pathways contributing to coenzyme A synthesis are illustrated.
  Where relevant and known, the enzyme catalyzing each reaction is indicated.
