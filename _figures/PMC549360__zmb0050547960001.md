caption: (A) Shared MAPK cascade components signal to three distinct endpoints. See
  the text for details. Shared components (Ste11MEKK, Ste7MEK, and Kss1MAPK) are shown
  in yellow. Nutrient limitation (starvation) is known to activate the invasive growth
  program, but whether this or some other signal is transmitted by the MAPK cascade
  is unknown. Whatever this signal is, it appears to be relayed by the Msb2 protein
  (). (B and C) Models for how the Ste5 scaffold protein may promote signaling specificity.
  The active, phosphorylated Ste11 and Ste7 isoforms are indicated by an asterisk.
  (B) By the selective recognition of mating components, Ste5 enhances signaling within
  the mating pathway. Also, Ste5 may sequester its bound components and prevent them
  from straying into other pathways. (C) Ste5 may act as a sequestering barrier to
  protect mating components, particularly Fus3MAPK, from Ste11MEKK or Ste7MEK activated
  by other pathways.
