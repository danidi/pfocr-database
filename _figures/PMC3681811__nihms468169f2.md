caption: 'Under physiological conditions, kynurenine pathway enzymes in the mammalian
  brain are preferentially, although not exclusively, localized in non-neuronal cells
  –. Metabolism of the pathway is driven by blood-derived tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine
  (KYN) or 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), or by locally formed metabolites. Of functional
  significance, the two branches of the pathway are physically segregated in the brain.
  Astrocytes, which harbor KATs but do not contain KMO and therefore cannot produce
  3-HK from KYN , –, account for kynurenic acid (KYNA) biosynthesis, which is regulated
  by intracellular metabolic events –. 3-HK and its major downstream metabolites are
  synthesized in microglial and other cells of monocytic origin , . Once synthesized
  within glial cells, quinolinic acid (QUIN) and KYNA are promptly released into the
  extracellular milieu to affect their pre- and postsynaptic (“pre” and “post”) neuronal
  targets. 3-HANA: 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid, α7nAChR: α7 nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor, TCA: Tricarboxylic acid.'
