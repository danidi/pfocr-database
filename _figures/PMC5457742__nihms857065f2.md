caption: Involvement of arginine in human physiology. Arginine is a dibasic, cationic
  amino acid and is considered as ‘conditionally essential’ amino acid. Arginine plays
  a crucial role in innate and adaptive immunity. For example, increased role of arginine
  in myeloid-derived suppressor cells results in the impairment of T-cell proliferation
  and function. Arginine has been identified as the sole physiological precursor for
  NO, a key performer in many cellular regulatory functions. Arginine also is a precursor
  of two important amino acids, proline and glutamate. One of the most important roles
  of arginine is its implication in the synthesis of polyamines through the diversion
  from NO synthesis pathway. Polyamines are known to promote tumor growth, invasion
  and metastasis. Arginine also has a vital role in the synthesis of nucleotides,
  creatine, agmatine and hormones such as insulin and prolactin.
