caption: Schematic representation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The phosphorylated
  Erythropoietin receptor (pEpoR) acts as input for the signaling cascade and induces
  phosphorylation of STAT5. Phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) then dimerizes (pSTAT52)
  and translocates to the nucleus (npSTAT52). There it can act as transcription factor
  and thereby induce protein synthesis. Furthermore, with some delay τ, the pSTAT5
  dimers dissociate to unphosphorylated STAT5 monomers and translocate back to the
  cytoplasm. (Figure adapted from ))
