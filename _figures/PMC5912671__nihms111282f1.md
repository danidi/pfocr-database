caption: 'The FA pathway is composed of at least 13 genes. Each of these genes, when
  biallelically mutated, causes FA. The encoded proteins can be subdivided within
  the FA pathway into three groups: proteins that make up the core complex, the FANCD2
  and FANCI proteins which compose the ID complex, and three downstream effector proteins:
  FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BRIP1/BACH1, and FANCN/PALB2. Following treatment with DNA crosslinking
  agents or during S phase of the cell cycle, FANCD2 and FANCI become monoubiquitylated.
  An intact core complex is required for these modifications which result in the translocation
  of the two proteins to chromatin within cells. Within chromatin, FANCD2 and FANCI
  colocalize with DNA repair proteins including the downstream effector FA proteins
  at sites of DNA damage in nuclear foci. FA proteins are in blue.'
