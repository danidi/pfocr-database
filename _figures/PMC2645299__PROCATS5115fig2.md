caption: An integrative model of differential recruitment of cellular calcium mobilization
  mechanisms. Acetylcholine acts on M2 and M3 subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic receptors
  on the ASM cells to elicit a calcium response. M3 subtype of receptor, which is
  coupled to Gαq protein, recruits phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) and generates inositol
  1,4,5-tris-phosphate (IP3). IP3 acts on IP3-receptor (IP3R) to increase its open
  probability to release Ca2+ from SR. Activation of the M2 subtype of receptor, which
  is coupled to Gαi protein, recruits CD38/cADPR signaling pathway. The β-NAD is transported
  out from the cytoplasm of the myocyte by connexin 43 hemichannel proteins (Cx43).
  cADPR generated by CD38 is transported back into the myocyte cytoplasm either through
  specialized nucleoside transporters (NT) or via the oligomerized CD38. ADPR, the
  predominant product of the CD38 enzymatic activity, acts on transient receptor potential
  (TRP) channels to elicit influx of divalent cations including Ca2+. Upon interaction
  of cADPR with RyR (direct or indirect), dissociation of FK506-binding protein 12.6
  (FKBP12.6) from RyR results in open probability of the ion channel and releases
  SR Ca2+. SR Ca2+-ATPase 2 (SERCA2) pumps the cytosolic Ca2+ back into SR to replenish
  the SR Ca2+ stores. The TRP channels also play major role in replenishing the SR
  Ca2+ store through store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). EC = extra cellular space;
  PM = plasma membrane.
