caption: Working model of regulatory mechanisms controlling cell death in response
  to mating pheromones. Low concentrations of α-factor (αF) activate regulatory pathways
  leading to cell wall degradation (CW deg.) and stimulation of the high-affinity
  Ca2+ influx system (Cch1, Mid1) but not the Fig1-dependent low-affinity Ca2+ influx
  system. The resulting rise in [Ca2+]c activates CN, which prevents ROS accumulation
  by either inhibiting ROS production by the mitochondrial respiratory chain or stimulating
  ROS dissipation. The diminished cell wall strength may lead to increased ROS accumulation
  and intermediate lifespan of cells were it not for the activation of the CWI signaling
  pathway, which increases biosynthesis of new cell wall material by increasing the
  activities of chitin and glucan synthases (CHS and GLS). Because CN and CWI signaling
  pathways operate in wild-type cells, low concentrations of α-factor fail to induce
  significant amounts of cell death. High concentrations of α-factor activate the
  above processes but also induce Fig1-dependent Ca2+ influx, early ROS accumulation,
  and rapid cell death in a fraction of the population. Glucosamine (GlcN) supplement
  and deficiencies of Fus1, Fus2, or Rvs161 block all these responses and additionally
  prevent activation of CWI signaling. Fig1 deficiency does not affect cell wall degradation
  or CWI signaling.
