number: Figure 6
caption: (a) The original proposed three enzyme biosynthetic pathway. (b) The full
  pathway including the ATP regeneration cycle after identifying the kinase progenitor
  for phosphorylation of dideoxyribose and recognizing inhibition of PPM by nucleotide
  substrates and products. (c) The two step didanosine biosynthetic pathway as a result
  of the discovered bypass activity of the engineered RK. Dashed arrows indicate expected
  degradation products.
