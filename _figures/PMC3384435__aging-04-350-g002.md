caption: (A) Calorie restriction. Deactivation of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway
  results in insulin sensitivity.(B) Knockout of S6K1 in mice abolishes feedback block
  of insulin signaling, resulting in insulin sensitivity [].(C) Decreased levels of
  growth hormone (GH). In mice, absence of GH or GH receptor leads to a remarkable
  extension of longevity []. GH receptor deficiency is associated with a reduction
  in pro-aging signaling, cancer, and diabetes in humans []. Growth hormone signaling
  accelerates aging in mammals []. Remarkably, growth stimulation promotes cellular
  aging, when cells cannot proliferate [, ]. Thus, the growth promoting pathways such
  as mTOR are involved in both organismal and cellular aging.(D) Acute treatment with
  rapamycin. Deactivation of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway abolishes a feedback
  block of insulin signaling, resulting in insulin sensitivity [].
