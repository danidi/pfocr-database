caption: Androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer. (a) Schematic representation
  of the AR gene, highlighting some major AR mutations and their exon localization.
  (b) Schematic representation of AR protein structure with indication of its functional
  domains. (c) AR-mediated signaling pathway. The androgen-receptor (AR) signaling
  pathway begins with the translocation of the testosterone to the cytoplasm, where
  it can be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and then promote the receptor dimerization
  and its further migration to the nucleus. A variety of signals, including PTEN-dependent
  downregulation, can also merge to AR stabilization and further activation (as indicated).
