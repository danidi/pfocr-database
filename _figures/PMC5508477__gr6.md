caption: Representative scheme of the mechanisms involved in the induction of cell
  cycle arrest and senescence.MPM cell lines are frequently deleted in CDKN2A/ARF
  gene, coding for both p16INK4a and p14ARF. (A) Palbociclib treatment, by inhibiting
  cyclin D1/CDK4/6 complexes, impeded Rb hyper-phosphorylation, preventing E2F release
  and the consequent induction of E2F induced genes, as myc. By binding to p21 promoter,
  myc inhibited p21 gene transcription and expression. Under palbociclib treatment
  this mechanism was lost and p21 accumulated, inducing cell cycle arrest and senescence.
  On the other hand, the loss of the MDM2-inhibitor p14ARF hindered the accumulation
  of p53. Moreover, the inhibition of CDK4/6 determined by palbociclib treatment,
  by increasing p-AKT level, induced the accumulation of p-MDM2 that, as a consequence,
  promoted p53 degradation.(B) The sequential combined treatment with palbociclib
  and PI3K inhibitors, by blocking the PI3K pathway, inhibited AKT and strongly down-regulated
  p-MDM2, thus allowing p53 accumulation and the induction of cellular senescence.
