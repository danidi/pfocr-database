caption: The effects of exercise on the signalling pathways associated with muscle
  growth and wasting in sarcopenia and cachexia. Muscle wasting is commonly induced
  by elevated inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which increase signalling
  of protein degradation via a number of key pathways—a key one mediated by the FoxO
  transcription factors, which activate the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and
  autophagy. In addition, sarcopenia and cachexia are also associated with lower levels
  of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which impairs protein synthesis by
  suppressing the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. This pathway can also be repressed by myostatin,
  which binds to its receptor activin A receptor type B (ActRIIB) to further stimulate
  atrogene transcription via SMAD2 or SMAD3. Exercise, however, stimulates a number
  of pathways that can increase protein synthesis whilst reducing degradation (as
  denoted by dashed lines), which attenuates muscle wasting and, in some circumstances,
  can lead to muscle growth. Exercise can exert potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative
  effects and also reduce myostatin signalling, which collectively represses the transcription
  of atrogenes and consequent protein degradation. Simultaneously, exercise also increases
  IGF-1 levels to induce protein synthesis, with the subsequent activation of mTOR
  concomitantly suppressing FoxO signalling. An important exercise-induced transcription
  factor is PGC-1α, and also its isoform PGC-1α4, with the former down-regulating
  proteolysis and the latter increasing synthesis via the IGF-1 pathway.
