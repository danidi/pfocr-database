caption: Activated endothelial cells modulate allogenic T lymphocyte activity. Allogenic
  endothelial cells expressing HLA class II molecules are capable of inducing the
  secretion of IL-2 and alloproliferation by CD4+ memory lymphocytes. The T helper
  cell production of IL-2 facilitates the differentiation of memory CD8+ T cells into
  cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), which can mediate rejection by targeting donor HLA
  class I molecules. Meanwhile, alloproliferation in CD4+ lymphocytes is associated
  with the selective expansion of pro-inflammatory Th17 (endothelial IL-6-dependent),
  anti-inflammatory Treg (endothelial ICAM-1 dependent) and pro-inflammatory Th1 subsets.
  Interestingly, donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) binding to HLA class II molecules
  alter endothelial cell immunogenicity. DSA binding can activate the Akt/PI3K-signaling
  pathway, consequently increasing endothelial IL-6 secretion and increasing the expansion
  of the pro-inflammatory Th17 subset. In addition, the amplification of the Treg
  population was decreased after DSA binding. Both the binding of DSA and the sub-lytic
  activation of the complement cascade can synergize to activate non-canonical NF-κB
  signaling in endothelial cells, ultimately resulting in an increased expansion of
  the Th1 subset and a greater secretion of IFNγ.

  description: Activated endothelial cells modulate allogenic T lymphocyte activity.
    Allogenic endothelial cells expressing HLA class II molecules are capable of inducing

    helper cell production of IL-2 facilitates the differentiation of memory CD8+ T
    cells into cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), which can mediate rejection by targeting
    donor HLA class I molecules. Meanwhile, alloproliferation in CD4+ lymphocytes
    is associated with the selective expansion of pro-inflammatory Th17 (endothelial

    Th1 subsets. Interestingly, donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) binding to HLA class
    II molecules alter endothelial cell immunogenicity. DSA binding can activate the
    Akt/PI3K-signaling pathway, consequently increasing endothelial IL-6 secretion
    and increasing the expansion of the pro-inflammatory Th17 subset. In addition,

    the binding of DSA and the sub-lytic activation of the complement cascade can
