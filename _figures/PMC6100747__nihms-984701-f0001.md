caption: Ischemic stroke initiates cell death mechanisms in brain cells following
  an acute depletion of blood flow, resulting in the formation of an infarct core.
  ATP production is decreased due to impaired glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.
  The reduced production of ATP results in Na+ influx due to failure of ATP-dependent
  Na+ pumps. At neuronal pre-synaptic terminals, the failure of ATP-pumps causes anoxic
  depolarization and opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels which allows influx of
  Ca2+, inducing uncontrolled glutamate release. Function of the ATP-dependent glutamate
  uptake transporter is also impaired, causing accumulation of glutamate at the synaptic
  cleft, which continues to activate Ca2+ channels on post-synaptic neurons and results
  in excitotoxicity. This acute increase in intracellular Ca2+, along with acidotic
  toxicity and increased Na+ influx, results in cell swelling a characteristic of
  the osmotic movement of water, which contributes to necrosis. High levels of intracellular
  Ca2+ triggers degradative enzymes and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  which degrade key membrane and cytoskeletal proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.
  This also contributes to necrosis as well as the release of DAMPS (damage associated
  molecular patterns) molecules from the infarct core region. In the region of the
  penumbra, where limited blood is supplied collaterally, the DAMPS released from
  the infarct core region may activate surface receptors on glial cells and neurons,
  initiating signaling cascades such as MAPK and NF-κB, resulting in a positive feedback
  cycle that further accumulates chemokines and cytokines produced through the inflammasome
  pathway. The inflammasome complex cleaves pro-caspase-1, making it the executioner
  of pyroptosis and converting interleukins 1β and 18 to their mature forms, which
  are then secreted to trigger paracrine and autocrine signaling. The increase in
  intracellular Ca2+ recruits the apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak to the mitochondrial
  outer membrane, thus compromising the mitochondrial membrane potential and mediating
  release of cytochrome-C (Cyt-C). Cyt-C forms an apoptosome complex in conjunction
  with other pro-apoptotic proteins to execute apoptosis by cleaving pro-caspase-9,
  which in turn cleaves pro-caspase-3 to cleaved caspase-3. Alternatively, activation
  of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) by TNF activates pro-caspase-8, impacting
  mitochondrial integrity by converting the pro-apoptotic protein Bid to its active
  truncated form. Then, in combination with cleaved caspase-1 from the inflammasome
  pathway, it initiates apoptosis via production of cleaved caspase-3, an executioner
  caspase of apoptosis.
