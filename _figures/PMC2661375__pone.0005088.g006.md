caption: Pathologic Aβ production can be mediated by (a) altered γ-secretase specificity
  resulting in increased Aβ42∶Aβ40 ratios leading to increased pathogenic plaque deposition
  (b) increased BACE1 activity which increases the levels of available APP substrate
  and therefore production of Aβ peptides (c) increased APP γ-secretase activity which
  results in increased Aβ production. In addition to pathogenic Aβ pathways, loss
  of Notch1 signaling due to decreased Notch1 γ-secretase activity may also lead to
  a neurodegenerative state (d). The data presented here implicates aging in pathways
  (a), (b), and (d) in the development of AD whereas (c) is an additional causative
  pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in females.
