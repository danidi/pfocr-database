caption: Our data support the proposed notion that HCV infection up-regulates the
  expression of Tim-3 and accumulation of Foxp3+ Tregs, inhibiting Foxp3− Teff responses
  and resulting in blunted antiviral T cell responses with decreased pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to viral persistence.
  Specifically, HCV-mediated Tim-3 inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of activated
  CD25+Foxp3− Teffs, leading to impaired protective Th1 responses as well as limited
  pathogenic injury. Meanwhile, as a negative feedback mechanism, Tim-3 is also up-regulated
  and tempers CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs, which accumulate during HCV infection and may further
  dampen antiviral T cell responses. Notably, Tim-3 pathway fine-tunes the development
  and function of Foxp3+ Tregs and blocking Tim-3 signaling may correct the imbalance
  of Foxp3+ Tregs/Foxp3− Teffs established during HCV infection. Therefore, the counter-regulatory
  effect of Tim-3 on Tregs should be taken into account when manipulating this inhibitory
  pathway as a novel strategy for immunotherapy against chronic viral infection, so
  as to balance the protective immune responses and avoid T cell-dependent injury.
