caption: The canonical and non-canonical autophagy pathways. Apoptotic cell debris
  is phagocytosed and directed to the LAP pathway of autophagy. When the contents
  of phagosomes escape into the cytoplasm, canonical autophagy is the preferred pathway.
  Both pathways share certain proteins (green), whereas some are canonical specific
  (pink) and some are specific to the LAP pathway (purple). LAP, LC3-associated phagocytosis;
  Tim4, T cell immunoglobulin- and mucin domain-containing molecule-4; ATG, autophagy-related;
  Nox2, NADPH oxidase; Fip200, FAK family-interacting protein of 200 kDa; Ulk1, uncoordinated
  (Unc)-51-like kinase 1; LC3, Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3.
