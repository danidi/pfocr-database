caption: The RHP pathway (highlighted in yellow) has metabolic links to methanogenesis,
  reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, pentose bisphosphate pathway, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis,
  and amino acid metabolism. Methanogenesis and reductive acetyl-CoA pathways share
  a metabolic intermediate, methylene-H4MPT that might be synthesized by Fae with
  released formaldehyde from the RHP pathway (dotted black line). The successive black
  arrows show multiple reaction steps. The RHP pathway (red lines and arrows) is superimposed
  on the Calvin–Benson cycle (green lines and arrows), and reaction steps from Ru5P
  to F6P are common in both cycles. Missing Calvin–Benson-cycle steps in M. hungatei
  are indicated by grey dashed lines and arrows. Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; RuBP,
