caption: Step model of thyroid carcinogenesis. This model is based on histological
  and clinical features as well as on the degree of tumor differentiation. The well-differentiated
  thyroid follicular cell may give rise to both benign and malignant tumors. Autonomously
  hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas are associated with activating mutations in the
  TSHR or Gαs genes (O’Sullivan et al., ; Parma et al., ). After gaining mutations
  in different oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, the differentiated thyroid follicle
  can also give rise to well-differentiated papillary or follicular carcinomas, poorly
  differentiated carcinoma, and anaplastic carcinoma. The figure represents a schematic
  model showing the molecular events involved. Modified from Nikiforov and Nikiforova
  ().
