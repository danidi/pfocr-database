caption: In the fully developed host, B cells provide lymphotoxin (LT), which is recognized
  by the macrophages that populate the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of the lymph node and
  causes them to adopt an SCS macrophage phenotype (CD11b+CD169+). These macrophages
  engulf particulate antigens, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and prevent
  their spread to the periphery,. The macrophages also produce protective type I interferons
  (IFNs). During lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) infection, active LT signalling
  is required to organize B cell follicles; the cell type sensing this LT signalling
  is currently uncharacterized, but might be the high endothelial venule (HEV) (not
  shown). The LT pathway is also essential for the production of type I IFNs from
  radio-resistant cells in the spleen that protect the host during viral infection,
  (not shown). In addition, dendritic cells (DCs) that produce type I IFN in response
  to LTβ receptor (LTβR) agonism and Toll like receptor (TLR) signalling promote CD8+
  T cell homeostasis in the spleen, (not shown).
