caption: Tyrosine degradation pathway comprises a 5-step enzymatic conversion from
  tyrosine to fumarate and acetoacetate. Tyrosine derives from the diet or hydroxylation
  of phenylalanine by phenylalanine hydroxylase and is converted to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  (HPP) by tyrosine aminotransferase, the first step in the tyrosine catabolism. Further,
  4-HPD catalyzes the formation of homogentisate (HGA) out of HPP, which is converted
  to maleylacetoacetate (MAA) by homogentisate dioxygenase. Excess of HGA can accumulate,
  auto-oxidize and polymerize to an ochronotic pigment, i.e. pyomelanin. The penultimate
  step comprises the conversion of MAA to fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) by maleylacetoacetate
  isomerase. Lastly, FAA will be broken down to fumarate and acetoacetate by the final
  enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). When FAH functionality is deficient,
  MAA and FAA can also be converted into succinylacetone which inhibits the porphobilinogen
  synthesis. 5 different TIMD are related to an inefficient or deficient enzyme in
  this pathway.
