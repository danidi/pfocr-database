caption: (A) Gas6 released by erythroblasts in response to Epo interacts with Gas6R
  on the cell surface, leading to signaling for cell survival and possible cell proliferation,
  maturation, and differentiation, and enhances EpoR signaling by activating PI3K
  and its effector Akt in these cells (autocrine effect). In addition, Gas6 favors
  adhesion of erythroblasts to fibronectin via VLA4/α4β1 integrin activation. (B)
  Gas6 acts as a bridging molecule between senescent rbc and Gas6Rs, driving engulfment
  of the bound senescent rbc. (C) Interaction of Gas6 and Gas6Rs downregulates the
  release of erythroid-inhibitory factors from macrophages in the erythroblastic island.
