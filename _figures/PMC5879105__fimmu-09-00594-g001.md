caption: Effect of TNFR2-targeting agents on the activity of Tregs. (A) (i) Transmembrane
  TNF, TNFR2 agonistic Ab, and TNF mutant preferentially bind to and stimulate TNFR2.
  (ii) Blockade of TNFR1 with antagonistic Ab diverts the stimulatory effect of TNF
  to TNFR2. All these agents have potential to activate Tregs, and promote the proliferative
  expansion, phenotypic stability, survival, and TNFR2 expression on Tregs. (B) (i)
  TNFR2 antagonistic Ab blocks TNF–TNFR2 interaction. (ii) Small molecule compounds
  with the capacity to inhibit TNFR2 signaling pathway, or downregulate TNFR2 surface
  expression, or suppress TNF biosynthesis. These agents may inhibit the activation
  and proliferation of Tregs, and reduce the phenotypic stability, survival, and surface
  TNFR2 expression on Tregs.
