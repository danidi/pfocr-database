caption: Regulation of mitochondrial protein quality control by cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome
  system (UPS). Individually damaged proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane
  (OMM), are selectively ubiquitinated by specific E3 ligases, extracted by the AAA
  ATPase Cdc48/VCP/p97 and then degraded by the proteasome by “MAD” pathway. Irreversible
  damage to the mitochondria leads to PINK1 stabilization at OMM and subsequent recruitment
  and activation of E3 ligase Parkin, which extensively ubiquitinates the OMM proteins.
  These ubiquitin chains serve as signals for engulfment of damaged mitochondria by
  autophagosomes, through the pathway of “ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy”. Impaired
  mitochondrial protein import and sorting pathways leads to the accumulation of mitochondrial
  precursor proteins in the cytosol, which triggers their clearance by the proteasome
  through pathways known as UPRam and mPOS.
