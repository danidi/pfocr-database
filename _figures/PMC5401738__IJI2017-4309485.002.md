caption: TNF-α activation of NF-κB pathway. Upon binding with the receptor, TNF-α
  permits activation of IKK complexes, which then phosphorylate IκB. Phosphorylated
  IκB is then targeted for degradation, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus
  to regulate tumorigenic activity and immune defense. IL-10 inhibits this response
  transcriptionally.
