caption: Molecular mechanism of NF-κB activation by serpin polymers. Newly synthesized
  serpin molecules enter the ER by co-translational translocation. Correctly folded
  molecules (native protein) are packaged into ER-to-Golgi transport vesicles for
  secretion (not shown), whereas folding intermediates and misfolded species are retained
  in the ER, where they can be targeted into the ERAD pathway. Some mutant serpins
  monomers (M) form homogenous ordered polymers (P) via partial RCL insertion intermediates
  (M*), which escape the ER quality control system and form inclusion bodies. These
  inclusion bodies are in effect “insoluble” to the cell and may no longer be seen
  by the canonical quality control systems. Accumulated polymers of mutant serpins
  can elicit the specific activation of the transcription factor NF-κB independently
  of the UPR by increasing cytosolic Ca2+.
