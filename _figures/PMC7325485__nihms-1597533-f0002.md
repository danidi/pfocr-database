caption: (a) The dominant control mechanism by which Nrf2 activity is regulated occurs
  through its association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase KEAP1 and subsequent ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation. Reactive oxygen species and alkylating compounds react
  with key thiol resides on KEAP1 and promote dissociation of Nrf2 from the KEAP1
  complex. Dissociation of Nrf2 from this complex can also be achieved by the expression
  of mutated form of KEAP1 as is common in numerous different cancer types and through
  the increased expression or availability of proteins that compete with Nrf2 for
  KEAP1 binding. Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus where it positively regulates the
  expression of genes required for resistance to oxidative stress, including drug
  metabolizing enzymes and transporters capable of detoxifying and effluxing anti-neoplastic
  agents, the combination of which gives rise to drug resistance. (b) Representative
  Nrf2 inhibitors previously reported.
