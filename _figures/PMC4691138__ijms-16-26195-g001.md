caption: Schematic presentation of proposed molecular epigenetic mechanism of sulforaphane’s
  action including interdependence between histone modification and DNA methylation.
  SFN, sulforaphane; HDACs, histone deacetylases; RARβ2, nuclear retinoic acid receptor
  β2; AP-1, activator protein 1 (transcription factor); p21, cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitor 1; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; DNMT1, DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase
  1; PTEN, phosphate and TENsin homologue; MAPK Signaling Pathway (also known as the
  Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway), the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway;—She,
  adaptor protein; Ras, GTPase (cellular signal transduction); Raf, kinase (activates
  MAP2K, which activates MAPK); MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Cyclin D2,
  member of the family of D-type cyclins; ERα, estrogen receptor alpha; hTERT human
  telomerase reverse transcriptase.
