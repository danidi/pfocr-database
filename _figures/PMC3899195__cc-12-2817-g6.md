caption: Figure 6. Schematic diagram summary of ZNF365 function. ZNF365 is necessary
  for HR DSB repair pathway. It binds to PARP1 and tethers MRE11 to the DNA end resection
  sites for timely resolution of stalled replication forks. Loss of ZNF365 results
  in incomplete replication and ensuing checkpoint response, leading to delayed mitotic
  progression and exit, cytokinesis failure, re-duplication of centrosomes, and increased
  aneuploidy.
