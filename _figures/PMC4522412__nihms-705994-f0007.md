caption: Schematic diagram of endogenous TRAIL function in multidrug-resistant cancer
  cells. In drug-resistant cells expressing P-glycoprotein (e.g., HeLa MDR-OFF (Pgp-ON)
  and KB-C1 cells), its intracellular environment allows a better response upon sTRAIL
  binding to death receptors and apoptotic signal transduction, compared to the environment
  when Pgp activity is lost. When Pgp is suppressed, as in HeLa MDR-Off cells treated
  with doxycycline (Pgp-OFF) or KB-C1 cells with Pgp knockdown, changes in the intracellular
  environment favor transactivation of p53, which induces TRAIL and DcR1 proteins.
  While the decoy receptor reduces sTRAIL-mediated apoptotic signal transduction,
  endogenous TRAIL in the cytoplasm seems to inhibit the extrinsic pathway signal
  transduction. These genes collectively reduce sTRAIL-mediated apoptosis once MDR
  cells lose Pgp expression or function.
