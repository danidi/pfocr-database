caption: (a) Viral vector, DNA, tumor lysate, autologous tumor cells, peptide vaccines,
  and viral-like particles deliver tumor-associated or viral antigens to dendritic
  cells (DCs). (b) These DCs activate and travel to lymphoid centers where they in
  turn activate T-cells and B-cells in a response to the tumor-associated antigen
  (TAA). A different set of cancer vaccines, called DC vaccines, utilize activated,
  autologous DCs, or tumor lysate, particle-loaded DCs. Prepared ex vivo and infused,
  these DCs then activate T- and B-cells. (c) Activated T-cells or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
  (CTLs) can also be utilized in vaccines. In preparation for vaccination, CTLs undergo
  extraction from the patient, priming against TAAs, and activation with cytokines
  ex vivo prior to infusion. These effector cells then migrate to tumor sites eliminating
  infected host cells. (d) T-cells, of all types, migrate to the site of neoplastic
  cells and are then subject to the tumor microenvironment. Here, CTLs or tumor infiltrating
  lymphocytes are acted upon host, neoplastic cells and regulatory T-cells. These
  signaling pathways are the target of check point inhibitors like Nivolumab (program
  cell death receptor-1 [PD-1] inhibitor) and Ipilimumab (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  molecule 4 [CTLA-4] inhibitor). PD-1 receptors are expressed on activated T-cells
  and other myeloid cells. Blocking of the interaction between PD-1 ligand and PD-1
  allows CTLs to avoid inhibition, continuing IL-2 production and proliferation. In
  a separate pathway, activation of the CTLA-4 receptor, present on regulatory and
  CTLs, CD80 on DCs, inhibits CTL proliferation. Ipilimumab blocks the CTLA-4 from
  being activated, preventing subsequent inhibition of an immune response.
