caption: Schematic representation of xylose utilization by C. sakazakii strain MOD1_Jor22.
  The proposed model for xylose utilization involves activation of the xylose regulon
  by the binding of D-xylose with XylR. It is thought that D-xylose enters the cell
  either through diffusion or transport via XylE or XylFGH. In addition, xylanase
  A (XynA) is secreted to the extracellular milieu through an unknown type 2 secretion
  component where it can digest xylan to β-xyloside which is then brought into the
  cell via a xyloside transporter (XynT, a putative β-xyloside transporter) where
  XynB (β-xylosidase) converts it to D-xylose. Though unconfirmed, α- xyloside is
  thought to be transported into the cell where XylS (α-xylosidase) converts to D-
  xylose. D-xylose then is converted to D-xylulose by XylA (xylose isomerase) and
  then converted to D-xylulose-5P by XylB (xylulokinase). This physiological pathway
  is identical to that of E. coli. Similar to that of E. coli, Cronobacter also have
  anaerobic metabolic pathway where D- xylose is converted to xylitol by oxidoreductase
  and then converted to D-xyloulose using NAD(P)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase.
  D-xylulose-5P is then shunted into pentose- phosphate pathway
