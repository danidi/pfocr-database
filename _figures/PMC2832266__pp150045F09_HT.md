caption: Metabolic model of primary metabolism under hypoxia in L. japonicus. When
  respiratory energy production is inhibited by decreased oxygen availability to a
  plant, drastic changes are observed in the steady-state levels of primary metabolites.
  Here, a model is described that agrees with the changes in metabolite levels and
  enzyme activities observed in L. japonicus during waterlogging. Pyruvate production
  is enhanced due to the activation of glycolysis (Pasteur effect). To keep glycolysis
  going, cytosolic NAD+ must be continuously regenerated from NADH via fermentation
  reactions that lead to the accumulation of lactate and ethanol. By producing pyruvate,
  ATP is formed. Accumulation of pyruvate should be prevented during hypoxia as this
  activates respiratory oxygen consumption (). Via AlaAT, the amount of pyruvate can
  be reduced. Moreover, this reaction produces 2-oxoglutarate, which can be used by
  OGDH and succinate CoA ligase to produce another ATP. Succinate will accumulate
  as the TCA cycle will be further blocked due to the oxygen limitation at the reaction
  catalyzed by SDH. The mitochondrial NAD+ that is required to oxidize 2-oxoglutarate
  can be recycled via the enzyme MDH, which obtains its substrate either via phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase (PEPC) or via AspAT. The latter enzyme is known to be activated upon
  anoxia and provides Glu as a substrate for AlaAT. All reactions leading to the production
  of pyruvate can be catalyzed by enzymes that are located within the mitochondrion.
  The model explains why Ala and succinate accumulate during anoxia in plants and
  provides a pathway that improves the ATP production during anoxia.
