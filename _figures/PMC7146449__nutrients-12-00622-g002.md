caption: Aging-associated increases in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The process
  of aging involves proinflammatory pathways, in which the formation of Th1-type cytokine
  interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is of the utmost relevance. IFN-γ stimulates several enzymes,
  including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO), which degrades tryptophan into kynurenine,
  an integral defense mechanism in the cell-mediated immune response. In addition
  to its role in innate immunity, the kynurenine pathway also plays a role in the
  regulation of the immune response by slowing down T-cell proliferation. Some tryptophan
  catabolites have been shown to be involved in the feedback inhibition of T-cell
  activation via regulatory T-cells, and thus immunosuppression. A supply of certain
  nutrients and bioactive compounds (such as antioxidants, n-3 PUFAs, or probiotics)
  can suppress (“−”) IDO activity and slow down Th1-type immune activation cascades.
  On the other hand, physical exercise stimulates the (“+”) induction of IDO, which
  is associated with an accelerated tryptophan breakdown and an increased kynurenine/tryptophan
  ratio []. Kynurenine metabolites can affect the brain and several other organs in
  peripheral tissues, where they induce local and systemic adaptations (see the main
  text for a description) []. Therefore, it is likely that kynurenine and its metabolites
  may contribute to the mediation of the health benefits of exercise and nutritional
  supplements.
