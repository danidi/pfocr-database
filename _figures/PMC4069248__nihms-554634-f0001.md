caption: Tumor suppressor p53 and its signaling pathway. In unstressed cells, p53
  protein is kept at a low level by different negative regulators, including E3 ubiquitin
  ligases MDM2, Cop1 and Pirh2. In response to a wild variety of stress signals, p53
  is activated and accumulated in cells. The activated p53 then binds to p53 responsive
  elements (p53 REs) in its target genes to transcriptionally regulate their expression,
  which in turn regulates various biological processes, including cell cycle arrest,
  DNA repair, apoptosis, senescence and metabolism.
