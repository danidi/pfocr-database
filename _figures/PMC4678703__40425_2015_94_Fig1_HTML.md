caption: Mechanisms of IDO pathway activity in immune tolerance. The enzyme IDO catalyzes
  the initial and rate-limiting step in the catabolism of tryptophan along the kynurenine
  pathway. Accordingly, IDO can provoke tryptophan shortage, which results in mTORC1
  inhibition and GCN2 activation, in turn leading to anergy of effector T cells. Tryptophan’s
  degradation leads to production of bioactive kynurenine pathway compounds, which
  activate the AHR, resulting in promotion of Treg differentiation. TC, tumor cell;
  DC, dendritic cell; MФ, macrophage; EC, endothelial cell; FB, fibroblast; IDO, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
