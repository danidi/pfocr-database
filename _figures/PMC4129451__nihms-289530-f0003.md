caption: 'ET binds to two prominent G-coupled receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB. ET receptor
  stimulation is followed by activation of a variety of different downstream cascades.
  For example, shown on the left, ETA induced activation of phosphatidyl inositol
  specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) leads to the formation of inositol triphosphate
  and diacylglcerol (DAG) from phosphatidylinositol. Inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate
  (IP3) which then diffuses to specific endoplasmic reticulum receptors and releases
  stored Ca2+ into the cytosol. This causes a rapid elevation in intracellular Ca2+
  which in turn causes cellular contraction. In addition, ETA stimulation also induces
  activation of phosphatidyl choline-specific phospholipase (PC-PLD) yielding phosphatidic
  acid (PA) (shown on the left), PA is dephosphorylated by PA phosphorylase to DAG
  and DAG is also metabolized to PA by DAG kinase. ET-1 also stimulates protein tyrosine
  kinases (PTK) (shown on the right) such as RAS, particularly in neoplastic cells.
  Activation of PTKs in this pathway results in induction of the RAF/MEK/MAPK pathway,
  subsequently stimulating transcription of protooncogenes such as c-FOS, c-MYC, c-JUN,
  which in turn activate cell growth and metastasis (from Khimji AK and Rockey DC.
