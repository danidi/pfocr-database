caption: Schematic diagram of five type microbial interaction mechanisms which were
  shown to improve Clostridium co-culture systems. (A) Use of complementary metabolic
  pathways. Rhodobacter sphaeroides converts the acetate and butyrate produced by
  C. butyricum into hydrogen (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by photo fermentation from starch
  (). (B) Removal of metabolic inhibitors. Yeast consume oxygen, creating an anaerobic
  environment in which C. phytofermentans produces ethanol from cellulose and obtaining
  high ethanol yield of 22 g/L with stable symbiotic relationship by controlling oxygen
  transport of approximately 8 μmol/L hour (). (C) Cofactor complementation. Thermoanaerobacter
  strains X514 with a complete vitamin B12 biosynthesis pathway significantly enhances
  ethanolic fermentation of cellulolytic Clostridium thermocellum (). (D) Interspecies
  hydrogen and electron transfer. G. metallireducens oxidizes acetate and butyrate
  to regenerate AH2QDS, significantly improving C. beijerinckii fermentation of hydrogen
  from xylose (). (E) Direct cell-to-cell material exchange. Direct cell-to-cell interactions
  and material exchange of acetone and acetoin between C. acetobutylicum ATCC824 and
  C. ljungdahlii ATCC55383 with direct electron transfer results in non-native metabolites
  production ().
