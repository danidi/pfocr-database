caption: 'Flux partitioning around the leucine metabolism at 8 mg l−1 phytosterols
  and three different levels of assimilable nitrogen.The distribution of fluxes around
  these metabolic routes was investigated using isotopic filiation experiments with
  13C‐labelled leucine. Portion of consumed leucine recovered in proteinogenic leucine:
  the labelled fraction (light colour) corresponds to the consumed leucine directly
  incorporated into proteins, while the unlabelled fraction (dark colour) represents
  the proteinogenic amino acids de novo synthetized from CCM precursors. Portion of
  consumed leucine converted into volatile compounds: the labelled fraction (light
  colour) corresponds to the fraction of volatile compounds synthetized using carbon
  from consumed leucine, while the unlabelled fraction (dark colour) represents the
  portion of volatile molecules synthetized from α‐ketoacids through the CCM. Flux
  partitioning involved in the use of leucine during fermentation: the fraction of
  consumed leucine catabolized through a certain pathway was assessed from the molar
  ratios between the amount of a proteinogenic amino acid or volatile compound labelled
  and the total amount of consumed amino acid. Isotopic enrichments (defined as the
  molar ratio between the quantity of labelled compound and the total quantity) are
  shown above each bar plot. The raw data and details of the calculations are provided
  in the Supplemental Material. Blue: SM70; orange: SM250; pink: SM425.'
