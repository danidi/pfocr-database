caption: (A) Organization of the thaxtomin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces
  scabies 87.22. The block arrows represent the genes within the cluster, and the
  direction of each arrow indicates the direction of transcription. Biosynthetic genes
  txtA, txtB, txtC, txtD and txtE are represented in black, the regulatory gene txtR
  is grey, and the MbtH窶人ike protein (MLP)窶親ncoding txtH gene is orange. (B) The proposed
  biosynthetic pathway of thaxtomin A in S. scabies 87.22.
