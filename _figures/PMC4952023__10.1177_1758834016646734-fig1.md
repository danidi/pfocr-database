caption: Schematic of an endothelial cell depicting VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3
  and the mechanisms of action of the antiangiogenic agents bevacizumab, aflibercept,
  ramucirumab and regorafenib. Bevacizumab and aflibercept bind to VEGF and interrupt
  the interaction with VEGF receptors. Regorafenib is a small-molecule multi-kinase
  inhibitor of which targets include VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3. TAS-102 consists of trifluridine
  that is incorporated into DNA, inducing DNA dysfunction, including DNA strand breakage.
  Cetuximab and panitumumab are anti-EGFR treatments that result in disruption of
  the MAP kinase pathway.EGFR, endothelial growth-factor receptor; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth-factor receptor; DNA,
  deoxyribonucleic acid; MAP, a protein kinase signaling pathway.
