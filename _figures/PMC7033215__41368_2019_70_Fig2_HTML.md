caption: 'Enrichment map of significant GO pathways created using Cytoscape. Two main
  pathway clusters were found: (1) Epithelial cell differentiation, keratin expression,
  and cell junction activity, and (2) Inflammatory response. A third cluster related
  to non-specific enzyme activation. Each node represents a significantly enriched
  pathway (FDR < 0.05). Red nodes represent positive enrichment in infraoccluded samples
  (i.e. increased expression in infraocclusion), while blue nodes represent negative
  enrichment in infraoccluded samples (i.e. decreased expression in infraocclusion).
  Size of node represents number of genes enriching the pathway. Edges represent pathway
  overlap (i.e. genes common to both pathways), and width of edges represents size
  of overlap (i.e. number of genes common to both pathways) (overlap coefficient > 0.25)'
