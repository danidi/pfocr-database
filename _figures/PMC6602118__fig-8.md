caption: Energy metabolism differences between astrocytes and neurons. Preferential
  channeling of glucose toward glycolysis in astrocytes and toward PPP in neurons
  is the result of multiple regulatory steps. The enzyme PFKFB3 is fully active in
  astrocytes and constantly degraded in neurons. This enzyme generates fructose-2,6-bisphosphate,
  which is a strong activator of PFK. Astrocytes express the pyruvate kinase PKM2,
  which upregulates the glycolytic flow toward pyruvate; in contrast, neurons express
  PKM1, which shunts glycolytic intermediates to other pathways, including nucleotide
  biosynthesis. Astrocytes express pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase PDK4, which phosphorylates
  PDH, causing inhibition of activity. The LDH isoforms are also differentially expressed
  in astrocytes and neurons and influence the direction of the reaction. Glucose is
  preferentially metabolized in neurons by the PPP, which generates reducing equivalents
  in the form of NADPH, which are essential for reduction of GSSG and cellular antioxidant
  defense. Glycolysis generates MG, which is detoxified by the GLO system that is
  highly expressed in astrocytes. Glycogen is a glucose storage molecule in astrocytes.
