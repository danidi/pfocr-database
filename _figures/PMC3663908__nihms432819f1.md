caption: The major signaling pathways leading to cellular apoptosis. The extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis (upper left corner) is engaged by plasma membrane associated
  death receptors belonging to the TNF-R (tumor necrosis factor receptor) superfamily
  (e.g., TNF-R1/2, CD95/FAS). Upon engagement of these receptors by their respective
  ligands (e.g., TNF-α, FASL), conformation changes within the trimerized receptor/ligand
  complexes recruits adaptor proteins (e.g., FADD) and caspase-8 (and/or caspase-10
  in human; represented in blue) to assemble a death inducing signaling complex, referred
  to as the DISC. Assembly of the DISC promotes caspase-8 activation; cleavage and
  activation of executioner caspases-3, -6 or -7 (represented in green), and cell
  death.[] The intrinsic pathway (also called mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis)
  responds to cellular stresses like DNA damage (through p53), viral infection, protein
  misfolding, and oxidative-stress. These signals converge to activate the pro-apoptotic
  proteins of the BCL-2 family. Pro-apoptotic effectors (e.g., BAX, in blue) are able
  to target mitochondria and induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP); in which numerous pro-apoptotic proteins of the intermembrane space (e.g.,
  cytochrome c, the second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases SMAC/DIABLO,
  and HtrA2/Omi) are released into the cytosol. Direct activator BH3-only proteins
  (e.g., BID and BIM, in yellow) and other signals (e.g., p53 or sphingolipids from
  the ER) facilitate the activation of BAX and BAK. Sensitizers/de-repressors (e.g.,
  BAD and Noxa, in green) interact with the anti-apoptotic members (e.g., BCL-2 and
  BCL-xL, in red) to lower the cell death threshold. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome
  c interacts with the adaptor protein apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF-1)
  to form the apoptosome, which triggers the recruitment and the activation of the
  caspase-9 (represented in purple). Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) inhibit caspase
  activation, and SMAC/DIABLO relieves this inhibition. Once initiator caspases (e.g.,
  caspases-8 and -9) are activated, they trigger downstream activation of effector
  caspases-3 and -7, which cleave numerous cellular substrates including the inhibitor
  to the caspase activated DNAse (iCAD). Additionally, granzyme B, which is released
  by cytotoxic T cells, can also directly trigger effector caspase activation to promote
  cell death. The extrinsic pathway can also engage the intrinsic pathway via caspase-8-mediated
  cleavage of BID (in yellow) to amplify pro-apoptotic signaling.
