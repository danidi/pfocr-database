caption: Study hypothesis. Platelet aggregation is mediated by multiple pathways.
  The two most important pathways are the cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent formation
  of thromboxane A2 (TxA2), which binds to thromboxane receptors, and the granule
  secretion of ADP, which binds to ADP receptors (e.g. P2Y12). Both pathways lead
  to GPIIb-IIIa receptor activation resulting in stable aggregate formation. During
  aspirin treatment, the TxA2 mediated pathway is blocked, whereas the ADP mediated
  pathway is largely unaffected. In the presence of P2Y12 receptor polymorphisms (H2
  haplotype and/or 34°C > T), which were recently associated with increased platelet
  aggregation, aspirin treatment may be ineffective due to predominance of the ADP
  mediated pathway
