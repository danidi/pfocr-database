caption: Genomic reconstruction of potential pathways for CoII transport and assimilation
  in G. sulfurreducens. The genes (A) and model (B) show transmembrane ECF importers
  (in blue) as well as two CDF proteins for transmembrane export and four RND systems
  for exporting periplasmic metal across the outer membrane (gold color). Panel (B)
  also shows generic outer membrane porins (in gray) for the simple diffusion of metal
  cations. The genome of G. sulfurreducens also encodes for Cbi (letter designation),
  Cob (full name) and other enzymes needed for the anaerobic synthesis of cobamide
  (pink arrows). The pathway starts with the incorporation by the cobaltochelatase
  CbiX of the metal into Factor II, which is synthesized from heme intermediates such
  as uroporphyrinogen-III. The genome encodes Cbi proteins that convert the CoII-Factor
  II into cob(II)yrinic acid diamide, except for CbiJ (in gray) whose role in the
  pathway is yet to be experimentally validated. Cob (full name) and Cbi (only letters)
  proteins and other enzymes complete the synthesis of a cobamide with a 5-OHBza lower
  ligand (formula in C).
