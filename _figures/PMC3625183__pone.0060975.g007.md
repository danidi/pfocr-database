caption: A. The accelerated Mev pathway in MDR+ cells leads to the constitutive activation
  of Ras/ERK1-2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase downstream signalling pathways which culminates
  into HIF-1α activation and plasma membrane Pgp expression. The higher amounts of
  plasma membrane-associated cholesterol in MDR+ cells also contribute to the functional
  Pgp activation. The higher efficiency to extrude Dox protects MDR+ cells from cytotoxicity
  and ICD epitomized by CRT exposure on the cell surface. B. By inhibiting the Mev
  pathway, ZA downregulates the Ras/ERK1-2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signalling pathways,
  and decreases the HIF-1α-induced transcription of Pgp. As a result, Dox accumulates
  inside MDR+ cells at sufficient amounts to induce cytotoxicity and promote CRT exposure,
  turning the phenotype of these cells from a chemoimmunoresistant phenotype into
  a chemoimmunosensitive phenotype.
