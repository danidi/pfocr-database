caption: '(A) Role of the Phactr4–PP1 complex in normal ENCCs. β1 integrin signaling
  can activate ROCK through multiple, although not completely understood, pathways.
  ROCK, in turn, activates nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) and LIMK, which promotes the
  phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of cofilin. Phactr4 interacts with PP1
  and activates its phosphatase activity. The enhanced PP1 activity has two consequences:
  PP1 directly dephosphorylates and activates cofilin, and PP1 antagonizes β1 integrin
  signaling (and thus ROCK activation) through unknown mechanisms. The reduced ROCK
  activity leads to reduced activation of NMII and decreased inactivation of cofilin.
  The reduced NMII activity dampens the contractility of ENCCs, and the increased
  cofilin activity enhances directional migration of ENCCs. The increased cofilin
  activity also liberates G-actin, which can bind Phactr4 and may thereby regulate
  the functional properties of the Phactr4–PP1 complex in a putative feedback loop.
  (B) Misregulation of PP1 in Phactr4humdy cells. Loss of the interaction between
  Phactr4 and PP1 in the Phactr4humdy mutant mice leads to decreased and misregulated
  PP1 activity. Consequently, cofilin is not inactivated and the β1 integrin signaling
  pathway is not blocked, resulting in the loss of directional migration and increased
  cell contractility. In both panels, solid red arrows indicate direct activation
  between proteins; solid black arrows indicate a shift in protein activity (active/inactive
  cofilin, PP1, and Phactr4) or state (F-actin/G-actin); dotted red arrows indicate
  an unknown, multistep activation process; dotted black arrows indicate a putative
  feedback loop; and white protein boxes represent active proteins, while gray boxes
  represent inactive proteins.'
