caption: Model of DAF-2/IGFR pathway regulation by DPY-21. In eak-7;akt-1 double mutant
  animals, activated DAF-16/FoxO promotes dauer arrest (left). In eak-7;akt-1 dpy-21
  triple mutant animals, increased expression of ist-1, pdk-1, akt-2, and ftt-2 contributes
  to suppression of dauer arrest by promoting the inhibition of DAF-16/FoxO (right).
