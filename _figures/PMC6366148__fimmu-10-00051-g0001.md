caption: The central role of T lymphocytes in acquired immunity. Acquired immune cells,
  notably lymphocytes, recognize pathogens specifically and respond to them, according
  to their nature. T helper lymphocytes secrete various cytokines which are able to
  activate different immune cells including acquired and innate cells. The various
  Th subsets rely on different signaling pathways, but all effector subsets upregulate
  glycolysis. Among differentiated Th cells, T regulatory cells are the only non-glycolytic
  cells; effector subsets use different signaling molecules, however, all are glycolytic.
