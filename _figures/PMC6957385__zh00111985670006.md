caption: Proposed stretch activation (SA) mechanisms for mammalian skeletal muscle
  fibers. The standard, accepted cross-bridge cycle pathway () is shown outlined in
  blue, while our proposed pathways for cross-bridges subjected to stretch and Pi
  are shown outlined in green for soleus (A) and purple for extensor digitorum longus
  (EDL) (B). The green-colored lever arm of myosin indicates a pre-power stroke state,
  while the red lever arm indicates a post-power stroke state. For both fiber types,
  the detachment of myosins (with ADP and Pi bound) from actin due to stretch and
  Pi binding is responsible for the phase 2 decrease in tension (see ). However, for
  soleus, the stretch and Pi reverse the myosin power stroke (green arrow), making
  this population of weakly bound myosins, along with the other myosins in this same
  state, primed to reattach and generate greater force than if stretch had not occurred.
  This reattachment is responsible for the phase 3 force regeneration and phase 3
  peak (stretch activation). Because we do not know whether Pi binds to myosin and
  then stretch alters the myosin conformation, or vice versa, we do not indicate any
  intermediaries in the green pathway. For EDL, the pathway differs from the soleus
  in that Pi and stretch do not reverse the power stroke (purple arrow pathway); instead,
  myosin detaches in response to stretch when in the presence of Pi. We do not mean
  to imply that the green pathway is exclusively available to soleus myosin and the
  purple only to EDL myosins. A small fraction of EDL myosins likely take the green
  pathway (shown in A), and this may explain why some SA occurs in EDL fibers, but
  their probability of using the purple pathway becomes higher with increasing Pi
  concentration ([Pi]).
