caption: Plant and mammalian strategies for miRNA-directed, PAMP-triggered immunity.
  (A) In Arabidopsis, sensing of bacterial flagellin by the cognate receptor FLS2
  induces transcription of miR-393a. This miRNA represses a key component of the auxin
  signalling pathway, which negatively regulates plant defence. Resistance is thus
  achieved, in this case, by inducing a repressor of a negative regulator of innate
  immunity. (B) In mouse macrophages, bacterial-derived LPS is sensed by TLR4 to promote
  rapid downregulation of let-7 MIRNA family members through as yet unidentified mechanisms
  (?). Downregulation of let-7 promotes enhanced accumulation of its targets, IL-6
  and IL-10, with the former displaying pro-inflammatory properties and the latter
  preventing systemic inflammation. This results in the mounting of a balanced innate
  immune response that proceeds, therefore, through concomitant repression of a repressor
  of a positive regulator of defence, and repression of a repressor of a negative
  regulator of defence.
