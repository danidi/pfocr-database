caption: Overview of the jasmonate (JA) pathway including the major molecular players
  involved in biosynthesis, signaling, and catabolism. Black, blue, and green fonts
  show the main metabolites, enzymes, and proteins, respectively, for each section
  of the pathway. Scheme made based on [,,]. For more details, see the text.
