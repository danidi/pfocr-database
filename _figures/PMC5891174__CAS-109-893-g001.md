caption: Poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor‐induced cell fate through double‐strand
  break (DSB) repair pathway choice. Single‐ended DSB (seDSB) is generated after PARP
  inhibitor‐induced DNA replication fork collapse during S phase. The DSB end protected
  by the p53‐binding protein 1/Rap1‐interacting factor 1 (53BP1‐RIF1) complex is repaired
  by error‐prone non‐homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway causing cell death. In
  contrast, the DSB end released by breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/C‐terminal‐binding
  protein interacting protein (BRCA1‐CtIP) interaction is resected, leading to the
  homologous recombination (HR) pathway, resulting in cell survival
