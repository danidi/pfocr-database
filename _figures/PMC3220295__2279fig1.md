caption: FADS2 codes for a desaturase that adds cis double bonds to the growing fatty
  acid chains in omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) long chain polyunsaturated fatty
  acid synthesis. Nomenclature refers to the number of carbons and double bonds (e.g.,
  20:5n-3 has 20 carbons and 5 double bonds, with n-3 describing distance of the double
  bonds from the terminal methyl carbon of the fatty acid). The end products of the
  biosynthetic pathway give rise to eicosanoids and docosanoids with opposing effects.
