caption: Both the in vitro and clinical studies indicated IP-10 is associated with
  mixed viral/bacterial infection in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia. In vitro,
  miR-200a-3p was synergistically induced following mixed IAV/SP infection of human
  MDMs and found to indirectly regulate CXCL10 (IP-10) expression by targeting the
  suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 gene (SOCS6), a well-known repressor of the JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway. In vivo, IP-10 was significantly elevated in the serum samples
  of pediatric patients with mixed viral/bacterial severe pneumonia compared to patients
  with single detection (P = 0.03) and non-severe pneumonia (P < 0.01).
