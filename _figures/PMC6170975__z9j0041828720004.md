caption: A sympathetic pathway in the inhibition of systemic inflammation. C1 neurons
  residing in the medulla oblongata have been implicated as another coordination center
  that initiates descending signals to reduce immune activation. It is important to
  note that the immunomodulatory circuitry of this motor pathway does not require
  the vagus nerve. NE, norepinephrine; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; β2AR, β2-adrenergic
  receptor; α7R, α7-receptor.
