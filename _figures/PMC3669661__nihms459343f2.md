caption: (a) PA can be generated by three major mechanisms – first by the de novo
  synthesis pathway that involves the acylation of G3P by GPAT and LPAAT (Blue). G3P
  is generated by the reduction of the glycolytic intermediate DHAP. The FAs that
  acylate G3P can be synthesized by FAS and then elongated and mono-desaturated in
  mammalian cells. However, dietary essential FAs are required in mammalian cells
  for the synthesis of poly-unsaturated FAs needed for the acylation of membrane phospholipids.
  The second pathway involves the phosphorylation of DG by DG kinases (Green). The
  DG required for this pathway must come from either deacylated triglyceride or PLC-generated
  DG derived primarily from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-trisphosphate. Thus, DG kinase
  can generate PA in response to growth factor induced PLC, or from stored lipids
  via triglyceride lipases. The third pathway involves the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine
  by PLD (Black). This pathway is not likely involved in the generation of PA for
  membrane biosynthesis since the PA is derived from a membrane phospholipid. The
  same is true for the PLC pathway that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol to generate
  DG. These pathways likely represent growth factor-dependent stimulation of PA production
  that occurs in the absence of membrane biosynthesis and is restricted to multicellular
  organisms. As indicated, PA is a substrate for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol
  (PI), phsophatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL). DG generated by PA phosphatase
  (PA P’tase) is the substrate for the synthesis phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Red). (b) PA is generated from the glycolytic
  intermediate DHAP. Glycolysis represents the conversion of the 6-carbon glucose
  to two molecules of the 3-carbon pyruvate. The last step is catalyzed by pyruvate
  kinase (PK), which in dividing cells involves an embryonic isoform known as PKM2,
  which has a slower catalytic rate () that can be made even slower by tyrosine phosphorylation
  (). The outcome of the reduced pyruvate kinase activity coupled with increased glucose
  uptake is the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates (). The elevated level of
  glycolytic intermediates is the conversion to molecules for anabolic synthesis of
  biological molecules that are needed to double the mass of a dividing cell. The
  most understood utilization of a glycolytic intermediate is the pentose phosphate
  shunt, which generates ribose that can be utilized in the synthesis of nucleic acids
  (Blue). The pentose phosphate shunt also leads to the generation of NADPH that can
  be utilized in anabolic reactions – especially FA synthesis. Amino acids, most notably
  serine, are generated from 3-phosphoglycerate (PHG) via the conversion to phosphopyruvate
  by PHG dehydrogenase and then to serine by phosphoserine amino transferase (Green).
  Glycerol-3-phosphate, the substrate for the acyltransferases that generate PA, is
  generated from DHAP by reduction to G3P by G3P dehydrogenase (Red). Of interest,
  the enzyme that converts DHAP to glyceraldhyde-3-phosphate, triose phosphate isomerase,
  is suppressed by phosphoenolpyruvate ().
