caption: 'Main molecular pathways activated for the production of inflammatory cytokines.
  Three main transcription factors control the production of inflammatory cytokines
  and subsequently cell survival and proliferation: (i) HIF-1α, activated in hypoxic
  tissues, regulates the transcription of multiple genes including numerous inflammatory
  cytokines and growth factors that promote cell survival, fibrosis, and neoangiogenesis
  [, ]; (ii) NF-κB induces the expression of many inflammation cytokines and growth
  factors, as well as HIF-1α mRNA; (iii) STAT1, like NF-κB, induces the expression
  of several inflammation cytokines. To a lesser degree, STAT3 also regulates cytokine
  transcription, notably of IL-6. STAT1 and STAT3 are activated by JAK kinases, essentially
  JAK1, but other kinases also activate STAT transcription factors (e.g., MET, the
  HGF receptor). In addition, cancer-associated mutations may affect the expression
  (TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations) or signaling (JAK2-V617F, CBL, or LNK mutations) of
  cytokines or cytokine receptors. Certain growth factors (TGF-β) and other molecules
  such as liposaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacteria, can also activate
  the NF-κB pathway and subsequently the HIF and JAK/STAT pathways. Red arrows represent
  pathways that directly lead to increased production of inflammatory cytokines.'
