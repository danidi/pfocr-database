caption: 'Regulation of TIA biosynthetic pathways by transcription factors in Catharanthus
  roseus. Various structural genes (marked in blue) in TIA biosynthetic pathway are
  regulated by different transcription factors (TFs). ORCAs are believed to be key
  regulators that directly bind to the promoters of structural genes involved in TIA
  biosynthesis. Several TFs such as WRKYs not only control the expression of structural
  genes but also regulate the expression of other TFs including MYC2, ORCAs, ZCTs,
  etc. Some TFs such as MYC2 could not directly regulate the expression of structural
  genes in biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, these TFs form a transcriptional regulatory
  network for TIA biosynthetic pathways. Among them, some TFs, such as BIS2, ZCT2
  and WRKY2 (marked in green), are negative regulators, whereas most TFs (marked in
  red) are positively regulate TIA biosynthesis. DXS, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate
