caption: Hippo pathway Phosphorylated MOB recruits LATS (together with SAV and MST1/2).
  LATS is then phosphorylated by hippo to generate activated LATS, which can then
  phosphorylate YAP/TAZ and promote their cytoplasmic localization by creating a binding
  site for 14-3-3 proteins. YAP/TAZ and TEAD, the heterodimer, can enhance cancer
