caption: Schematic of proposed role of HAPLN1 in myeloma. MM-BMSCs secrete HAPLN1.
  Secreted proteases produced by MM-BMSCs, MM cells, or possibly other cell types
  in the tumor microenvironment process HAPLN1 into PTR1/PTR2-containing fragments
  to induce an atypical NF-κB signaling pathway in myeloma plasma B-cells leading
  to bortezomib-resistant survival of MM cells. This pathway involves IKK activation
  and IκBα phosphorylation, but polyubiquitination of IκBα is hardly detected (denoted
  by a lighter and shorter ubiquitin chain). In contrast, TNFα activates the canonical
  NF-κB pathway that is sensitive to bortezomib inhibition, and both IκBα phosphorylation
  and polyubiquitination are readily detectable.
