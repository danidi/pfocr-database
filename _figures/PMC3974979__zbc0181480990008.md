caption: Working model of critical role for GDF-15 in NE-induced myocardial hypertrophy.
  GDF-15 synthesis and secretion could be stimulated by NE both in vivo and in vitro.
  Increased GDF-15 in turn inhibited NE-induced myocardial hypertrophy by inhibiting
  NE-induced transactivation of EGFR and the phosphorylation of downstream kinases
  Akt and ERK, which constructed a feedback manner.
