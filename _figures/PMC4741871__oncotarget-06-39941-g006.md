caption: 'Expression of PG pathway genes in vitro, in cells in culture, in vivo, in
  the tumors extracted from nude mice. Summary from the gene expression data obtained
  by qRT-PCR for each of the genes of the pathway analyzed, averages of three independent
  experiments in culture and for the tumors of 4 mice are shown. -: undetectable.
  *the mRNA levels of these genes were found induced in the EV cells derived tumors
  as compared to the levels of the EV cells in culture.'
