caption: Coexpression network analysis and model of cell wall synthesis in rice. The
  coexpression network connects TFs (triangles) to pathway gene targets (circles)
  through directed edges and TFs to each other through undirected edges. Positive
  and negative correlation edges are colored green and red, respectively. Nodes are
  labeled with the gene name/family and colored based on the direction of regulation
  in response to SHN expression (microarray data supplemented by qRT-PCR) with blue,
  yellow, and white for up-regulation, down-regulation, and no regulation, respectively.
  Genes tested for differential expression using qRT-PCR are denoted with thick orange
  borders. The outer rings of TFs are all positively coexpressed with each other;
  hence, all the green edges connecting them to each other have been removed for clarity.
  See Supplemental Table S1 for identifiers, names, and annotations of all the genes
  in the network. This network is provided in Supplemental File S1 and can be imported
  into Cytoscape.
