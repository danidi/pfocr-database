caption: 'All data showed in present manuscript are in color pattern: orange for protein
  expression in cytosol, except for GSK-3β that has activity level represented, and
  green for nuclear expression of transcription factors and mRNA. All hypothetical
  explanations are in grey and were not measured in this paper. The present work showed
  that age-related increase in neuroinflammation as indicated by NF-кB activation,
  increase in TNF-α and decrease of IL-10 levels, combined with a basal reduction
  in the pAKT increasing GSK-3β activity, what can be related to a decrease in DVL-2/β-CATENIN
  pathway in hippocampus in the presence of high levels of serum GCs, may predispose
  an effect of specific factor in the manifestation of age-related degenerative disorders.
  In fact, in response to the neuroinflammatory status and decrease of DVL-2 linked
  to β-CATENIN pathway in hippocampus, microglia should become activated and high
  levels of glutamate (GLU) is frequently associated with impaired handling of extracellular
  GLU by gliotic astrocyte [–].'
