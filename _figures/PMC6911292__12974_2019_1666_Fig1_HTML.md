caption: Effect of high salt on innate immunity. A high salt condition increases pro-inflammatory
  macrophages (M1) and activates inflammasomes that lead to the production of interleukin
  (IL)-1β. It also activates the MAPK pathway and increases the production of several
  chemokines and cytokines. High salt can also reduce the activity of alternative
  (cell repairing), non-inflammatory macrophages M2 (which produce regulatory cytokines
  such as IL-10) by dysregulating their AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
