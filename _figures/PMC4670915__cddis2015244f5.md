caption: Scheme of the metabolic effect in control and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells.
  Major metabolic transformations in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells compared with control
  cells are shown. The brighter colors indicate the increased expression and/or activity
  of the indicated protein. White nuanced indicate the total absence of protein expression
  found in the performed experiments. In cancer cells, a high rate of glycolysis is
  observed with highly increased glucose uptake even under normoxic conditions, while
  respiration remains almost unchanged (aerobic glycolysis). The major mediators of
  the metabolic shift toward increased glycolytic flux are, in our experiments, c-c-Myc,
  p53, Akt, PK and IDH. The less PK activity in cancer cells increases the concentrations
  of glycolytic intermediates. The survival signals lead to translocation of HK to
  the mitochondrial membrane through the Akt signaling pathway helped by c-Myc and
  p53. Mitochondria-bound HK confers an advantage to utilize ATP for phosphorylating
  glucose and, at the same time, mitochondrial HK negatively modulates Bid preventing
  the release of cytochrome c into cytosol and cell death. High IDH expression probably
  are involved in the early steps of initiating Warburg effect and help the cancer
  cells to maintain this metabolic state. After induction, in SH-SY5Y differentiated
  cells the shift in energy metabolism eventually leads to the oxidation of nutrients
  via oxidative phosphorylation. An increase in the PK activity, due mainly to the
  PKM1, continuously generates pyruvate, which is transported into mitochondria and
  further metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The almost nonexistent IDH2
  expression helps to maintain the citrate in this oxidative metabolic way. The disappearance
  of c-Myc and p53 with the lowest Akt expression and the increase in SIRT3 activity
  also induce the detachment of HK and increase the mitochondrial activity
