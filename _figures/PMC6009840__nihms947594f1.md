caption: Glycolysis can be inhibited using inhibitors for hexokinase (HK), the hypoxia-inducible
  factor α (HIF-α) such as PT2385, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A). Glycolysis can also
  be inhibited by activators of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), which inhibits
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Fatty acid oxidation can be inhibited using peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) antagonist (GW-6471). Also fatty acid synthesis
  can be inhibited using the fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor TVB-2640. In ccRCC,
  upregulation of tryptophan metabolism results in increased production of the immunosuppressive
  metabolites kynuernine and quinolinate. This pathway can be inhibited using the
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor epacadostat. Glutamine metabolism can
  be inhibited using the glutaminase (GLS) inhibitor CB-839. α–KG is α–ketoglutarate.
  Glutamine is also feeding glutathione (GSH) pathway. Inhibitors of glutathione peroxidase
  (GPX1) and inhibitors of NADPH such as KPT-9274 and FK866 will stop changing GSH
  to GSSG. This reaction is responsible for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  in the cell. Arginine is synthesized from citrulline in two steps of the urea cycle
  using the enzymes argininosuccinate synthase-1 (ASS1), and argininosuccinate lyase
  (ASL). As ASS1 levels are markedly decreased in all grades of ccRCC, the tumour
  cells are dependent on extracellular sources of arginine for their survival. Extracellular
  arginine can be depleted using the pegylated form of arginine deaminase enzyme (ADI-PEG20).
  ASL inhibitors can also be used for targeted therapy of ccRCC.
