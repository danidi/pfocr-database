caption: Schematic functional hierarchy of metabolic biomarkers of T-cell dysfunction
  in patients with SLE, depicting the proposed site of impact by NAC. MHP is caused
  by exposure to nitric oxide (NO). De novo synthesis of NO and maintenance of GSH
  in reduced form are both dependent on the production of NADPH by the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). MHP causes mTOR activation which in turn controls the expression
  of the transcription factor FoxP3.
