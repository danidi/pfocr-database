caption: 'GlyRα2 and GlyRα3 mediate inhibition using different inhibitory circuits.
  A–C, Schematic diagrams of the proposed roles of GlyRα2 and GlyRα3 in the WT mouse
  On and Off retinal pathways are shown. Each diagram illustrates a basic retina circuit
  that is consistent with the results presented. The diagrams in the top right corners
  illustrate the stimulus and the timing of its onset and offset. Within each circuit,
  the numbered boxes represent the current evoked at stimulus onset and offset. Nota
  bene: Currents are represented with transient time course for simplicity. The currents
  in the boxes do not reflect the temporal properties of the currents, as described
  in Results. A, GlyRα2 mediates crossover inhibition from the Off to the On pathway.
  At stimulus onset (white bar), the NF AC is driven by an OFF CBC (Box 1), which
  produces a small outward current (Box 2). The NF AC, using a crossover inhibitory
  mechanism, inverts the polarity of the current via GlyRα2 (blue), producing a current
  in the ON GC (Box 4) that enhances the current from its presynaptic ON CBC (Box
  3). At stimulus offset (gray bar), a similar mechanism transfers an inverted polarity
  current from the Off to the On pathway, which enhances poststimulus suppression.
  The spiking response of the GC is governed by the summation of the inputs (Box 5).
  B, GlyRα2 mediates crossover inhibition from the On to the Off pathway. Similar
  to the description in A, at stimulus onset (gray bar), the NF AC is driven by an
  ON CBC (Box 1), which produces a small outward current (Box 2). The NF AC, using
  a crossover inhibitory mechanism inverts the polarity of the current via GlyRα2
  (blue), producing a current in the OFF GC (Box 4) that enhances the current from
  its presynaptic OFF CBC (Box 3). At stimulus offset (white bar), a similar mechanism
  transfers an inverted polarity current from the Off to the On pathway, which enhances
  poststimulus suppression. The spiking response of the GC is governed by the summation
  of the inputs (Box 5). C, GlyRα3 mediates serial inhibition in the On pathway. At
  stimulus onset (white bar), ON CBCs depolarize (Boxes 1a and 1b represent currents
  in all CBCs). The ON CBC (far left) targets an ON AC producing an inward current
  (Box 2). Using GlyRα3 (green), this distal ON AC produces an outward current in
  the proximal ON AC (Box 4), which is summed with the inward current produced via
  input from its presynaptic ON CBC (Box 3). The proximal ON AC targets either the
  ON CBC (far right) at a GABA receptor (purple) or an ON GC at either a GABA receptor
  (purple) or a GlyRα1R (red). Because the proximal ON AC output is controlled by
  its ON AC inhibitory input, the outward current (Box 5) is small. Depending on the
  postsynaptic target of the proximal ON AC, the GCs total current (Box 6) reflects
  either the input from its presynaptic CBC (Box 1b) or from the inputs from its presynaptic
  CBC and ON AC (Box 5).'
