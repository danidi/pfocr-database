caption: The 21 genes most differentially expressed in response to CoVa knockdown
  in Drosophila S2 cells identifies metabolic pathways and mitochondrial retrograde
  signals. After knockdown of CoVa, energy substrate disposition is dominated by the
  acquisition of glucose from both extracellular sources, such as from trehalose,
  and from intracellular sources, such as glycogen. The glucose is then metabolized
  through glycolysis and results in increased lactate production and the direction
  of reducing equivalents away from the mitochondrion by downregulation of glutamate
  dehydrogenase. The cellular response to electron transport deficiency also leads
  to the induction of specific mitochondrial retrograde signals. These signals include
  experimentally validated targets, including the mitochondrial proteins Alr and CG30022,
  as well as evidence of a p53-response, also experimentally validated, through the
  upregulation of the genes CG17327 and CG2017. Hifα provides a biologically relevant
  mitochondrial retrograde signal, as it is known to continuously sense ambient oxygen
  tension, the primary electron acceptor of the oxidative function of the mitochondrion.
  In addition, it is known to control glycolytic and cytochrome gene expression. Other
  pathways identified in the transcriptional response to CoVa knockdown include the
  ecdysone response, circadian cycling, new protein synthesis, and the closing of
  nuclear pores by affecting the importin-alpha and importin-beta nuclear pore complex.
  For a discussion of the specific genes, see the Results and Discussion sections.
  Genes in red indicate an upregulated gene, and genes in green indicate a downregulated
  gene. Solid black lines indicate a metabolic pathway, solid blue lines indicate
  an experimentally validated mitochondrial retrograde signal, dashed blue lines indicate
  a suspected mitochondrial retrograde signal, and red lines indicate genes whose
  expression is known to be controlled by Hifα ().
