caption: Proposed model of how the non-apoptotic function of caspases allows survival
  and proliferation of colonic epithelial cells in H2O2-associated colitis during
  oxidative stress. (A) H2O2 leads to the induction of the receptor TRAIL-R1/DR4,
  which, in turn, activates the JNK pathway including p21WAF1, γ-H2AX and caspases.
  This results in S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. However, caspases are involved in
  ATM degradation, and this leads to γ-H2AX down-regulation. Caspase activity circumvents
  G1/S- and intra-S checkpoint control by override and progression of cells through
  the G1- and S-phase (survival). (B) Inhibition of caspase activity cause γ-H2AX
  up-regulation and accumulation of cells in G1, S, as well as in debris (apoptosis).
  (C) Inflammation-associated ROS cause activation of DNA-damage checkpoints. However,
  caspase activity causes reduced total γ-H2AX, which leads to undetected accumulation
  of DNA-damage and increased proliferation of altered HCEC.
