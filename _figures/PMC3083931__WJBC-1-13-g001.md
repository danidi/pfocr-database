caption: 'Canonical and noncanonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation pathways.
  The binding of a specific ligand to a receptor (i.e. tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
  binding to TNFR1) leads to the recruitment and activation of an IKK complex comprising
  IKKα, IKKβ catalytic subunits and the regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO. The IKK complex
  then phosphorylates IκBα leading to degradation by the proteasome and concomitant
  translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it activates target genes. The NF-κB
  negative regulators, A20, TAX1BP1, Itch and RNF11, form a complex and inhibit activation
  of NF-κB upstream of IKK in the canonical pathway. In the noncanonical pathway,
  NIK is activated downstream of select TNFR superfamily members, and phosphorylates
  IKKα that in turn phosphorylates p100 resulting in its ubiquitination, limited degradation
  by the proteasome and nuclear mobilization of RelB/p52 dimers. Ubc13: Ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme 13.'
