caption: 'Roles of abscisic acid (ABA) in modulating plant defence and hormone responses.
  I. SA pathway: ABA suppresses the salicylic acid (SA) pathway. Certain temperature‐sensitive
  R proteins [Toll/interleukin‐1 receptor‐nucleotide‐binding site‐leucine‐rich repeat
  (TIR‐NBS‐LRR)‐type] translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus at low temperatures.
  In ABA‐deficient mutants, such proteins lose their temperature sensitivity, localize
  in the nucleus and act against their specific pathogens (Mang et al., ). Pretreatment
  with ABA suppresses certain genes involved in SA biosynthesis and signalling (e.g.
  SID1 and NPR1), and thereby negates SA‐induced resistance against biotrophic pathogens
  (Yasuda et al., ). II. miRNA pathway: ABA affects microRNA (miRNA) biosynthesis
  at several levels. Certain mutants, such as hyl1 (HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1) and dcl1
  (DICER‐LIKE 1), are hypersensitive to ABA, whereas AGO1 homeostasis is regulated
  by ABA through miR168a. At the protein level, ABA stabilizes CBP20 and CBP80 (CAP‐BINDING
  PROTEINS 20 and 80), which are required for capping of the 5′ untranslated region
  (UTR) of synthesized miRNAs (Kim et al., ; Li et al., ). III. siRNA machinery: ABA
  indirectly affects the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway. The mutants dcl2,
  dcl3, dcl4 and sgs3 (SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3) are hypersensitive to ABA (Zhang
  et al., ).'
