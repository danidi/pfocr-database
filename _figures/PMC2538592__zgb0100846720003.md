caption: Mechanisms for age-associated up-regulation of PGE2 production and its interruption
  by vitamin E in Mφ. The binding of LPS to its receptor CD14 at the Mφ surface triggers
  its association with transmembrane protein TLR, mainly TLR2 and TLR4. MyD88, a cytoplasmic
  adaptor protein, responds to CD14/TLR stimulation by recruiting IL-1R-associated
  kinase (IRAK). Subsequent to activation of IRAK, TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)
  is phosphorylated and recruited to IRAK. Several tentative upstream kinases have
  been suggested to relay the signal to the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, including IKKα,
  IKKβ, and IKKγ/NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), downstream of TRAF6. IKK is a major
  kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of IκB. Phosphorylated IκB is ubiquitinated
  further and eventually degraded, leaving the NF-κB dimer free, and translocated
  to nucleus. In murine Mφ, IκB degradation is increased because of aging, which results
  in an increased translocation of the NF-κB dimer to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  NF-κB binds to the promoter region of the COX-2 gene and initiates the transcription.
  The resulting mRNA of COX-2 encodes the synthesis of the COX-2 enzyme. COX-2 catalyzes
  metabolism of AA to PGH2, which is isomerized further to PGE2. LPS-stimulated Mφ
  produce more ceramide in old than in young mice. Although only a LPS-induced activation
  pathway is illustrated here, age-associated up-regulation in COX-2 expression and
  transcription process is not stimulus-specific. Ceramide up-regulates COX-2 expression
  through NF-κB activation. The mechanism by which ceramide activates NF-κB degradation
  can only be speculated (shown as dotted lines) and remains to be determined. Vitamin
  E inhibits COX activity but has no effect on expression levels of protein and mRNA
  of COX-1 or COX-2. Vitamin E modulates this post-translational regulation, probably
  through its inhibitory effect on production of ONOO, a molecule shown to enhance
  COX activity but not affect COX enzyme expression. Mφ from old mice produce more
  NO than those from young mice. Vitamin E reduces NO production and might also do
  so to superoxide production and thus, ONOO synthesis. This has been reproduced with
