caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for tabtoxin. DapA dihydropicolineate synthase,
  DapB dihydropicolineate reductase, TblS putative β-lactam synthetase, TblC putative
  clavaminic acid synthase, TblD putative GNAT acyltransferase, TblE + TblF putative
  membrane protein, forming a functional pair with a D-Ala-D-Ala ligase, TabP zinc-dependent
  metallopeptidase. The figure has been adapted from Gross and Loper 2009 [].
