caption: (A) Gene ontology and interaction networks of proteins related to oxidative
  stress and antioxidant defense pathway in P. gingivalis LPS1690-induced HGFs secretome
  analysed by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software. Upregulated genes are shown in
  red color and down regulated ones are shown in green color. P. gingivalis LPS1690
  markedly induced the antioxidant defense molecules SOD2 (MnSOD), SOD3 and NOX5.
  (B) Gene ontology and interaction networks of proteins related to oxidative stress
  and antioxidant defense pathway in P. gingivalis LPS1435/1449-induced HGFs secretome
  analysed by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software. Upregulated genes are shown in
  red color and down regulated ones are shown in green color.
