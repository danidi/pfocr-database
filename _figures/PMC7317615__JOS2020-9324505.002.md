caption: Vitamin D metabolism. The production of vitamin D starts from 7-dehydrocholesterol,
  which is found in abundance in the skin. It can be formed from internal synthesis
  pathway of cholesterol formation from acetyl CoA. In the pathway, it is formed before
  cholesterol. It can also be obtained from diet such as milk. 7-Dehydrocholesterol
  is converted to previtamin D3 by breaking one of the rings using sunlight. Previtamin
  D3 isomerizes to form cholecalciferol (or vitamin D3), which is hydroxylated using
  CYP2R1 enzyme in the liver to form 25(OH)D3 (or calcidiol). Vitamin D3 can also
  be obtained from diet fortified with dairy products or fatty fish. Calcidiol can
  be converted to 24,25(OH)2D3 by P450cc24 and excreted. From the liver, calcidiol
  is bound to vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and transported to kidneys where it
  is converted to 1,25(OH)2D3 (or calcitriol) by the enzyme CYP27B1. Calcitriol is
  the active form of vitamin D. Its role will be described in . Excess calcitriol
  is converted to 1,24,25(OH)3D3 by CYP24A1 and excreted.
