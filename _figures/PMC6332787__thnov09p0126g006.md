caption: Illustration of the mechanisms underlying LPD nanoparticles-mediated combination
  immunotherapy with PD-L1 and CXCL12 trap for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
  Plasmids encoding PD-L1 and CXCL12 trap were encapsulated into nanoparticles. Local
  and transient delivery of the encapsulated plasmids reduced their systemic toxicity
  and allowed accumulation in perivascular cells. The CXCL12 capture protein secreted
  from perivascular cells promoted effective capture of CXCL12 chemokines, which not
  only directly reduced infiltration of immunosuppressive cells (such as MDSCs and
  Tregs) through the CXCL12 / CXCR4 axis, but also inhibited the expression of PD-L1
  by regulating the MAPK pathway. Reproduced with permission from , copyright 2017
