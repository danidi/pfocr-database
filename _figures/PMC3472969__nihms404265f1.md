caption: Genotypic-phenotypic model of estrogen metabolism and exposure (yellow box
  represents genotype component with phenotypic factors outside). In the center is
  the estrogen metabolism pathway used to generate the in silico genotype model. The
  pathway is initiated by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, which catalyze the oxidation of E2 to
  catechol estrogens 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2. The catechol estrogens are either methylated
  by COMT to methoxyestrogens (e.g., 4-MeOE2 as main fraction) or further oxidized
  by the CYPs to quinones, e.g., E2-3,4-Q, the main quinone that forms depurinating
  estrogen DNA adducts. Each of the three genes CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and COMT is genotyped
  for all subjects and the SNP genotype data used to derive the haplotype configuration
  for each subject. The model then uses the kinetic constants in a system of nonlinear
  differential equations to calculate the production of the main carcinogenic estrogen
  metabolite, 4-OHE2, for each haplotype configuration as well as the weighted average
  of all 4-OH-E2 production values, using the probabilities of haplotype configurations
  as weights. The genotype model is influenced by traditional risk factors, which
  are thought to affect hormone concentration (OC, HRT, BMI) and exposure time (age,
  ages at menarche and menopause, parity), as well as by family history of breast
  cancer and proliferative disease. The weight of each phenotypic factor on hormone
  concentration is determined by maximum likelihood estimation. Thus, the combined
  genotypic-phenotypic model allows the calculation of 4-OHE2 produced by each woman,
  expressed as 4-OHE2area under the curve metric (4-OHE2-AUC), for a personalized
  risk estimate of developing breast cancer.
