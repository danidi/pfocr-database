caption: 'In response to replication fork stalling, the ATR-ATRIP and 9.1.1 complexes
  are independently loaded at RPA-bound ssDNA regions to activate the replication
  checkpoint. Early after checkpoint activation, WRN is recruited to fork stalling
  sites through its interaction with RAD1, a subunit of the 9.1.1 complex. This stage
  corresponds to formation of WRN foci, which co-localise with RPA. After 9.1.1-dependent
  relocalisation in foci, WRN is phosphorylated by ATR in a manner that could be dependent
  on TopBP1. Phosphorylation of WRN by ATR is instrumental for preventing DSBs accumulation
  at stalled forks and and ensuring faithful recovery of replication forks. Degeneration
  of the stalled forks into breakage, such as in the absence of ATR phosphorylation
  of WRN, can cause the activation of an alternative pathway: in this case, ATM-dependent
  phosphorylation promotes de-localization of WRN from collapsed forks to prepare
  the way for RAD51-mediated replication recovery, which is also dependent on RAD51
  phosphorylation by CHK1.'
