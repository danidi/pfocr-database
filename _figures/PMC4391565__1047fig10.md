caption: H3K56 acetylation prevents genomic instability by affecting Ctf4 function.
  During S phase, in an unperturbed cell cycle (left), Asf1 functions cooperatively
  with Rtt109 to acetylate new histone H3 at lysine 56 (solid circles). The Rtt101–Mms1–Mms22
  complex binds and ubiquitylates new H3K56ac histones (shaded circles) and promotes
  an efficient progression of the replication fork and nucleosome assembly by favoring
  H3-H4 transfer from Asf1 to other histone chaperones. At the end of S-phase, Hst3
  and Hst4 deacetylases remove H3K56ac. How ubiquitylation is removed is still unknown.
  In response to DNA-damaging agents and in rrm3∆ cells (right), replication fork
  progression is affected, leading to checkpoint activation and subsequently to transcriptional
  repression of HST3 and HST4 and degradation of Hst3 and Hst4, allowing H3K56ac to
  persist. The unique chromatin environment created by H3K56ac accumulation behind
  the fork triggers a crucial interaction between Ctf4 and the Rtt101–Mms1–Mms22 complex
  through the N-terminal domain of Ctf4. This interaction modulates replisome structure
  by uncoupling MCM helicase and DNA polymerases and increases genome accessibility
  at replication defective forks, thus preserving genome integrity. It is currently
  unclear whether the interaction between Ctf4 and the Rtt101–Mms1–Mms22 complex is
  required to ubiquitylate Ctf4 itself and modulate its function or to recruit the
  Rtt101–Mms1–Mms22 complex to the site of DNA damage to ubiquitylate other replisome
  components. The function of the H3K56ac pathway is totally abolished in the absence
  of the N-terminal domain of Ctf4 required for its interaction with Mms22, positioning
  Ctf4 in the H3K56ac pathway.
