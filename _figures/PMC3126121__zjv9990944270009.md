caption: Model of events occurring during early innate immune recognition of rotavirus
  leading to IFN secretion. Numbers refer to steps in the pathway. Once inside the
  host cell (1), rotavirus particles synthesize nascent single-stranded RNA transcripts
  to direct the expression of viral proteins, including the IFN antagonist NSP1. Viral
  replication activates host proteins MDA-5 and RIG-I (2), leading to MAVS/IPS-1 recruitment
  and activation of IRF3 and NF-κB (3). These transcription factors induce expression
  of ISGs, including ISG54, ISG56, ISG15, and IRF7 (4 and 5). In addition, they also
  induce the expression of IFN-β itself (6). Rotavirus NSP1s from certain strains
  and in certain cells target IRF3 and/or the NF-κB regulatory factor β-TrCP for proteasomal
  degradation, inhibiting the interferon response. Rotavirus strains, such as UK,
  that trigger IFN secretion (7) lead to further induction and amplification of IFN
  secretion via a process that depends on PKR to promote IFN synthesis and/or secretion
  (8) at a posttranscriptional level. This function of PKR may be direct or indirect
  and is distinct from its role in preventing cellular translation. The model is based
  on our present study (indicated in red) as well as on several earlier reports (–,
  , , , , ).
