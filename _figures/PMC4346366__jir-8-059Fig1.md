caption: 'Consequences of tissue trauma on heme catabolism, reactive oxygen species,
  and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism.Notes: Top panel: following tissue trauma,
  release of free heme can serve as a signal for proinflammatory events. The oxidative
  degradation of heme by heme oxygenase removes free heme, and generates catabolites
  with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.– Iron released from heme by heme
  oxygenase catabolism can be stored by ferritin, preventing its participation in
  redox reactions. Middle panel: acute inflammation is associated with an increase
  in reactive oxygen species, which are regulated by cellular enzymes involved in
  redox reactions.,, Reactive oxygen species can have proinflammatory effects, and
  chronic inflammatory diseases are often associated with oxidative stress.,,, In
  some cases, reactive oxygen species can have anti-inflammatory effects., lower panel:
  in response to proinflammatory stimuli, phospholipase A2 mediates release of arachidonic
  acid from the cell membrane., an increase in inducible prostaglandin-endoperoxide
  synthase 2 also occurs.,– During the early inflammatory response, arachidonic acid
  is metabolized by prostaglandin synthases and lipoxygenases to generate eicosanoids
  and leukotrienes,,,– which is followed, at later times, by “lipid mediator class
  switching.” The latter is thought to serve as a switch from the production of proinflammatory
  lipid mediators to those involved in programmed resolution.,,–Abbreviations: GSH,
