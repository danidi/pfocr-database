caption: 'Schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism for promoting cellular uptake
  and overcoming MDR by Cur-pCB (poly(carboxybetaine)) -Dox in MCF-7/Adr cells. The
  nanosized feature of the zwitterionic antifouling micelles and endocytic pathway
  to bypass P-gp-mediated drug efflux led to high cellular uptake of the conjugated
  drugs that were released in the tumor cells of high GSH concentration. However,
  pCB-Dox and pCB-Cur can be delivered separately into different cells so that the
  drugs fail to play a synergistic role in inhibiting the MDR effect (a). By contrast,
  Cur-pCB-Dox codelivers Dox and Cur into the same tumor cells and results in synergistic
  effects of the two drugs (b). Merging images of cell uptake of pCB-Dox (left), pCB-Dox
