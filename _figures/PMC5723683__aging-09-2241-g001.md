caption: A schematic illustration presenting a model for the increased lifespan and
  healthspan of gcy-35(−);npr-1(−) animals. In the absence of gcy-35, the O2-sensing
  neurons AQR, PQR, and URX are not activated by O2. Our data suggest that GCY-31
  and GCY-33 activate a HIF-1-dependent signalling pathway in which neuropeptide and
  neurotransmitter induce defence responses against bacteria and UV damage in remote
  tissues. Therefore, although the worm is in a hyperoxic environment, it can benefit
  from defences activated by hypoxia signalling. The question mark represents our
  uncertainty about the tissues/cells in which HIF-1 activity is required.
