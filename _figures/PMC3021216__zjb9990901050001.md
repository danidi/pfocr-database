caption: 'Citrate metabolism in LAB. (A) Citrate fermentation pathway yielding acetoin.
  Enzymes: CL, citrate lyase; OAD, oxaloacetate decarboxylase; ALS, α-acetolactate
  synthase; ALD, α-acetolactate decarboxylase. The stoichiometry of the reactions
  was not taken into account. (B) Kinetic modes of the citrate transporter CitP. Left,
  exchange (fast) of external citrate (cit2−) and internal l-lactate (lac−); right,
  unidirectional uptake (slow) of citrate (cit2−) in symport with a H+. (C) l-Lactate
  shuttle mechanism. l-Lactate added to the outside of the cells allows CitP to operate
  in the fast cit2−/lac− exchange mode by reentering the cell in the permeable protonated
  state. The net result is the uptake of cit2− and a H+.'
