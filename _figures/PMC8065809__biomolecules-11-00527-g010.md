caption: A postulated model for the mechanism underlying IGF-Trap resistance in MDA-MB-231.
  The IGF-Trap inhibits IGF-IR signaling, decreasing ERK phosphorylation and cell
  cycle progression and inducing apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (Left). Our findings
  suggest that MDA-MB-231 cells that are continuously exposed to the IGF-Trap lose
  the sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effect of the Trap, due to increased autocrine
  FGFR1 signaling and ERK activation, mediated by increased FGFR1/FGF1 expression
  (Right). The increase in constitutive ERK phosphorylation may also contribute to
  increased mTORC1/S6K activation and protein synthesis in these cells, either directly
  or through crosstalk with the PI3K-AKT pathway []. Please note that postulated interactions
  are indicated by dotted arrows, while interactions elucidated by our data are indicated
  by solid arrows.
