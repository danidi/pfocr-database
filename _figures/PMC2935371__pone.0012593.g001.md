caption: Within the pathway, UDP-glucose/galatose pyrophosphorylase (UGGPase) is present
  in almost all apicomplexans with the exception for piroplasmids (e.g., Theileria
  and Babesia) [marked as Api(-Piro)], while trehalose-6P synthase and trehalose phosphatase
  (TPase) are fused as a bifunctional protein that is present in all apicomplexans
  with the exception for Plasmodium species [marked as Api(-Plasmo)]. Trehalase may
  only be present in the intestinal coccidia (Eimeria). For comparison, the mannitol
  cycle present only in the intestinal coccidia (represented by Eimeria tenella) is
  also illustrated.
