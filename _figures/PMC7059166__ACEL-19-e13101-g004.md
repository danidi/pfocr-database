caption: Cross talk dialogue between inflammatory and WβC‐signalling pathways in MPTP‐induced
  SVZ plasticity is lost with age. A simplified scheme summarizing MPTP‐induced neuroinflammation
  and SVZ plasticity in young and aged mice via modulation of WβC‐signalling (“Wnt
  on; Wnt off”) is shown. In young mice, during the degeneration phase, hyperactivated
  M1 microglia contributes to the impairment of SVZ neurogenesis at different levels.
  By increasing oxidative and nitrosative stress and in synergy with MPTP/MPP+ direct
  toxicity, microglial‐derived mediators (PHOX‐derived ROS, iNOS‐derived NO, and peroxynitrite)
  may act as molecular switch for cell signalling pathways critically involved in
  the physiological control of NSC homeostasis, with harmful consequences for astrocyte
  and NSC physiology, at least in part through GSK‐3β activation, followed by phosphorylation
  and consequent degradation of β‐catenin. In young mice, after the acute inflammatory
  and degenerative phase, a regulatory circuit linking microglial activation and proinflammatory
  cytokine to Nrf2‐ARE protective pathway in SVZ, provides an efficient self‐adaptive
  mechanism against inflammatory/neurotoxin‐induced oxidative stress, switching the
  M1 microglial harmful phenotype, thus mitigating inflammation with a return to pre‐MPTP
  conditions. By contrast, the aging process, in synergy with MPTP exposure, negatively
  impacts on astrocytic Nrf2‐driven Hmox1 response within the SVZ niche in vivo. Hence,
  this process, resulting from an age‐dependent dysregulation of astrocyte‐microglia
  interactions, contributes to the exacerbated oxidative and inflammatory SVZ status
  and the decline of astrocyte Wnt‐dependent regulation, finally leading to NSC neurogenic
  impairment and loss of SVZ plasticity The mutual role of astrocyte–microglial interactions
  in the plasticity of SVZ response to MPTP is exemplified by the astrocyte's ability
  to overcome microglial inhibitory effects, also via cross talk with Wnt/β‐catenin
  signalling. Pharmacological mitigation of inflammation and oxidative stress or GSK‐β
  antagonism upregulates β‐catenin and successfully rescues NSC proliferation and
  neuroblast formation, a process associated with striatal DAergic neuroprotection,
  with further positive modulation of SVZ proliferation via D2 receptor (D2R) activated
  mechanisms
