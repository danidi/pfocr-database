caption: Hypothetical scheme of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway in C. neoformans.
  Sphingolipid molecules are boldfaced, and enzymes are italicized. Question marks
  indicate enzymes or activities that have not been identified or observed. Hydroxyl
  groups in parentheses indicate that this group may be absent, creating the corresponding
  nonhydroxylated form. SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; SBK, sphingoid base kinase;
  P, phosphate; SBPP, sphingoid base phosphate phosphatase; SBPL, sphingoid base phosphate
  lyase; Cer, ceramide; Cdase, ceramidase; des, desaturase; Gcs1, glucosylceramide
  synthase; GCdase, glucosylceramidase; MIPC, mannosyl-inositol phosphorylceramide;
  M(IP)2C, mannosyl diinositol phosphate ceramide; M2IPC, dimannosyl-inositol phosphorylceramide.
