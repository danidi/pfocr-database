caption: 'Flowering time genes recently identified as targets of selection in crop
  species. The Arabidopsis flowering time pathway is represented as a simplified schematic
  based on Ballerini and Kramer () and references in Table ; photoperiod response
  occurs under long-day (LD) conditions. The gray inset shows a simplified schematic
  of the rice photoperiod response pathway and immediate downstream genes (Hd3a and
  RFT1, both Arabidopsis FT homologs), based on Tsuji et al. () and references in
  Table . Small red circles correspond to rice flowering time genes in Table , with
  known regulatory interactions among them indicated by arrows and lines; interactions
  are for short-day (SD) photoperiod unless long-day (LD) is indicated. Letters in
  red circles correspond to homologous genes from other crop species, as follows:
  (A) barley HvCEN, (B) barley Ppd-H1, (C) rapeseed BnFLC.A10, (D) wheat Vrn1, (E)
  wheat Vrn2, (F) lentil SN, (G) maize ZmCCT, (H) pea HR, (I) sorghum Ma1, (J) soybean
  E1, (K) sunflower HaFT1 and paralogs. Positions of letters indicate known homologies
  to Arabidopsis or rice genes.'
