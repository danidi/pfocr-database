caption: The inflammasome is activated through pattern recognition receptors that
  provide signal 1, inducing expression of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and inflammasome components.
  Danger-associated molecules provide signal 2, initiating inflammasome receptor oligomerization,
  which activates caspase-1 through the adaptor protein ASC. Active caspase-1 cleaves
  pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, releasing the mature, bio-active forms of IL-1β and IL-18.The
  inflammasome pathway is regulated by cytoskeleton-mediated mechanotransduction.
  Cell adhesion based mechanotransduction activates ASC by Pyk2 and FAK to enhance
  NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 activity, whereas cell adhesion can inhibit the pyrin inflammasome
  through activation of the GTPase RhoA via FAK. The NRLP3 inflammasome is also regulated
  by direct interactions with F-actin and the intermediate filament protein vimentin.
  Mechanical forces, including those exerted by changes in tissue stiffness and ECM,
  can thus be translated through cell adhesion sites to modulate inflammasome activity
  in multiple cells types.
