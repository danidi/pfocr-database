caption: Fucose metabolism in mammalian cells. Fucose (blue triangle) is activated
  to GDP-Fucose in two ways. One is by conversion of GDP-Mannose via a two enzyme
  pathway (GMD and FX). Knocking out this pathway forces cells to rely on the other
  pathway where fucose enters the cell through a putative plasma membrane transporter,
  is converted to Fuc-1-P, and then to GDP-Fuc in the cytosol. A Golgi transporter
  delivers the donor to Golgi fucosyl transferases for synthesis of various glycoconjugates.
