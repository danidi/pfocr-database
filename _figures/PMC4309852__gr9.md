caption: Model for mechanisms by which HNE up-regulates Cox-2. HNE stabilizes Cox-2
  mRNA through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, leading to the up-regulation of Cox-2
  . On the other hand, the present work suggests an alternative mechanism, by which
  HNE induces Cox-2 gene expression through down-regulation of p53 followed by the
  activation of Sp1.
