caption: Acetylation/deacetylation pathway in P. falciparum. A vast number of proteins
  in a cell can undergo acetylation. Histones are one of the best studied targets
  of epigenetic modifications including acetylation. Acetylated (black triangles)
  histone tails (specifically Lys residues) are usually a part of transcriptionally-permissive
  (eu)chromatin (see top green panel). On these histones DNA is usually less “tightly”
  wrapped enhancing the accessibility of the transcription machinery. Histones can
  also be ribosylated. Collected data suggests that in Plasmodium ADP-ribosylation
  can be performed by sirtuins following deacetylation (see bottom red panel). However
  it has been recently shown for TbSIR2rp1 that ADP-ribosylation can occur independently
  of, though at a much slower rate than the deacetylation reaction. In addition to
  NAD+-dependent sirtuins (middle panel – Effectors) P. falciparum genome contains
  other histone deacetylases which are listed (HDACs). The product of deacetylation
  by any of the HDACs is a non-acetylated histone residue. Global deacetylation usually
  leads to chromatin condensation yielding transcriptionally inactive (hetero)chromatin.
  Additional deacetylation products are nicotinamide and 2′-O-acetyl-ADP ribose in
  case of sirtuins and acetate for the remaining HDACs. Histone acetylases (HATs)
  complete the cycle by performing histone acetylation using acetyl-CoA as a co-substrate.
