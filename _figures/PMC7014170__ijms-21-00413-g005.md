caption: Schematic model illustrating the signaling pathway by which ANG reduces the
  inflammatory responses involving Myd88 and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in
  LPS induced EIU. A possible direct internalization of ANG and the subsequent downregulation
  of Myd88 and nuclear translocation of NF-κB result in the reduced mRNA expression
  of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, -6, and -8) and increased mRNA expression of
  anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and -10). Overall, the cascade underlying the
  effect of ANG results in suppression of inflammation.
