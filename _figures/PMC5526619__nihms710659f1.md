caption: a | Outline of the mitotic checkpoint. An unattached kinetochore is shown
  on the left with the inner complex in purple, MAD1 in grey and MAD2 in its open
  and closed forms in purple. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) is shown to inhibit
  the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which after attachment of the
  last kinetochore is activated and ubiquitylates securin and cyclin B1. More details
  of this pathway are described in the main text. b | The amplification of the unoccupied
  kinetochore signal is thought to depend on the conversion of MAD2 open complexes
  (MAD2(O)) to closed complexes (MAD2(C)) that bind to cell division cycle 20 (CDC20)
  and deliver it to the APC/C for ubiquitylation (Ub). The nature of the MCC is still
  debated, as indicated by question marks. A separate APC/C is shown to indicate its
  role in timing, independent of the kinetochore-derived signal. CDK1, cyclin-dependent
  kinase 1.
