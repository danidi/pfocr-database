caption: Metabolic pathway map showing fold changes of leaf metabolite concentrations
  of Plantago lanceolata subjected to different precipitation and temperature treatments.
  The map shows a part of the primary metabolism as well as the biosynthesis of iridoid
  glycosides. Only some major pathway intermediates are shown; dashed arrows indicate
  that intermediates were omitted. The names of the metabolites that were found in
  P. lanceolata leaves in this study are written in black, whereas others are given
  in grey. The heatmap stripes (mean log2-scaled fold changes compared with the common
  control group) were derived from the cluster heatmap (); the corresponding colour
  bar (log2 scale and original scale) and order of treatments (same order as derived
  by clustering, see ) are given in the keys at the top. Full names of metabolites
  are given in the lower key and in .
