caption: 'The role of lipids in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome. Lipid species are highly
  diverse and can either promote or inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Inflammasome
  priming, following the first hit, is promoted by both cholesterol crystals and the
  activity of fatty acid synthase (FASN) during fatty acid synthesis, whereas ω-3
  polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibit priming
  and inflammasome complex assembly via cell-surface receptors GPR120 and GPR40. Cholesterol
  crystals, oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), or saturated fatty acids (SFAs) can be internalized
  and form crystallized particles within lysosomes. Lipid crystallization can lead
  to lysosomal membrane rupture, which promotes NLRP3 activation in part by releasing
  cathepsins and enhancing mtROS production. The saturated fatty acid palmitate can
  also activate NLRP3 inflammasome by inactivating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  and autophagy, leading to increased mtROS, whereas the monounsaturated oleic acid
  can inhibit this process. Finally, the fatty acid oxidation pathway promotes inflammasome
  activation via NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)-dependent upregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1a (CPT1a), likely through mtROS as well. Green lines denote the promotion of NLRP3
  activity, whereas red lines denote the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activity.
