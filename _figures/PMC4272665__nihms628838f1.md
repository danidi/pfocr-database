caption: 'The complement system is activated through three distinct pathways: the
  classical pathway, the mannose binding lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway.
  Activation through the classical and mannose binding lectin pathways causes cleavage
  of the protein C4, and fixation of C4d (a fragment of C4) to nearby tissues. Activation
  through all pathways leads to cleavage of C3. The cleavage of C3 generates a soluble
  fragment (C3a) and a tissue bound fragment (C3b). Further proteolysis of C3b generates
  iC3b and finally C3d. Full activation of the complement system also generates C5a
  and C5b-9, important mediators of tissue inflammation and injury.'
