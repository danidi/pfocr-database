caption: 'Melatonin and its metabolites act as radioprotectors on epidermal keratinocytes
  and melanocytes. Local melatoninergic system in skin includes sequential transformation
  of tryptophan to serotonin and melatonin. NAS is both precursor and metabolite of
  melatonin. Through indolic pathways, melatonin is hydroxylated to 6(OH) M or metabolized
  to 5-MT. Through kynuric pathway, melatonin is transformed to AFMK. UVB is absorbed
  in the epidermis inducing oxidative stress and direct DNA damage. Melatonin and
  its metabolites inhibit oxidative stress and DNA damage induced by UVB (red arrow).
  In response to oxidative stress, NRF2 is released from Keap (Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein) and translocated to the nucleus. This process is stimulated by melatonin
  and its metabolites (blue arrow). NRF2 binds to ARE (anti-oxidant response element)
  and further activates detoxifying enzymes and proteins: melatonin and its metabolites
  also stimulate the production of anti-oxidants (blue arrow) which further reduces
  UVB-induced damage to melanocytes and keratinocytes (red arrow). UVB-induced DNA
  damage to the skin promotes p53 expression, which after phosphorylation accumulates
  in the nucleus and activates the DNA repair process. Melatonin and its metabolites
  stimulate phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 (blue arrow). Melatonin and its metabolites
  induce repair of DNA damaged by UVB by enhancing the NER core factors: complementation
  group C (XPC) and complementation group A (XPA)-DNA interactions (blue arrow). HO-1
  heme oxygenase 1, SOD superoxide dismutase, GP glutathione peroxidase, NQO2 quinone
  reductase 2, GR glutathione reductase, CAT catalase, GCS glutamylcysteine synthetase,
