caption: GO analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for commonly upregulated
  DEGs in ESRD patient-derived monocytes and ex vivo IS-stimulated monocytes. (A),
  STRING analysis (Ver. 11.0) showing the predicted protein–protein interaction (PPI)
  networks among 148 selected upregulated monocyte genes. The average node degree
  was 0.544 and the local clustering coefficient average was 0.191. The network nodes
  represent each protein, while edges represent pair-wise protein interactions, and
  line thickness indicates the strength of data support. Each node color represents
  a specific biomolecular pathway. Red circles indicated genes related to PPP. (B),
  ClueGO analysis of IS-related biological pathways in monocytes of ESRD patients.
  Functionally grouped network of enriched categories was visualized by Cytoscape
  Plugin using 148 upregulated DEGs in . Each node is a gene ontology (GO) biomolecular
  pathway and the edges show connectivity between nodes with regard to the functional
  linkage of biological processes. The node size represents the term enrichment significance.
  Color code represents the statistical significance, where darker colors indicate
  higher significance of the GO group. Blue rectangles indicate the pentose phosphate
  metabolism and AhR pathways, and red rectangles represent NADPH oxidase activity.
  (C), The node pie chart represents the molecular function of shared upregulated
  DEGs. Enrichment score (%) indicates the upregulated DEGs involved in enriched Go
  biological processes. * p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01 indicates the significant terms in
  the group.
