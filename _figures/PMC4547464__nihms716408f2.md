caption: Multiple pathways operate to suppress Th2-driven allergic inflammation in
  allergen tolerance. The relative contribution of induced Treg cells and Th3 cells
  remains unresolved. Colored lines denote afferent and efferent arms of the same
  pathway. Circles denote inhibitory pathways. See text for details.
