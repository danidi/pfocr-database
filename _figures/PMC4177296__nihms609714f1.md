caption: Enterobactin biosynthesis. A. The enterobactin biosynthesis pathway uses
  three NRPS enzymes. A molecule of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is activated by the standalone
  adenylation domain of EntE and loaded onto the aryl-carrier protein domain of EntB,
  while serine is similarly loaded by EntF adenylation domain to the integrated PCP.
  The EntF condensation domain then transfers the molecule of DHB to the serine, forming
  an amide. Three iterations of this synthesis allow the thioesterase domain to combine
  the DHB-Ser amides to form a cyclized enterobactin molecule. B. The two-step reaction
  catalyzed by the integrated adenylation domain of EntF is shown. The reaction is
  catalyzed by the adenylation domain (yellow) and results in the serine residue placed
  on the downstream carrier protein (CP) domain. C. The crystal structure of the chimeric
  EntE-B protein (PDB 3RG2) illustrated a domain-swapped dimeric architecture in which
  each molecule donates the aryl-carrier protein to the alternate adenylation domain.
  Asp522, at the start of the adenylation-PCP linker is shown with a yellow sphere,
  while Ser540 is shown in orange and red spheres for the residue within the same
  chain and the domain-swapped chain, respectively. The orange and red dashed lines
  then demonstrate the longer length that would be needed for the helical linker to
  reach to form an intramolecular interface between EntE and EntB. D. Sequence alignment
  of the adenylation-PCP linker region of several multi-domain NRPS proteins, as well
  as the chimeric EntE-B protein. The EntE sequence terminates at RASA and the EntB
  carrier protein begins at IPAS. The GRAS insertion was introduced after similarity
  with the linker of EntF (GRAP).
