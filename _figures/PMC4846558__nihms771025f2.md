caption: Amyloid-precursor protein (APP) can be proteolytically processed to form
  both amyloid and non-amyloidogenic peptides. The cleavage of APP by α-secretase
  forms non-amyloidogenic peptides. When APP is proteolytically processed by β-secretase,
  the amyloidogenic pathway is initiated. The subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase produces
  Aβ and amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) fragments. The various
  Aβ fragments can then aggregate to form insoluble extracellular plaques. Leptin
  can affect Aβ metabolism by targeting the (1) production, (2) clearance, (3) degradation,
  and (4) aggregation of Aβ. (1) Leptin can reduce Aβ production by decreasing β-secretase
  activity as well as by down-regulating the transcription of presenilin 1, one of
  the components of the γ-secretase complex. (2) Leptin can promote Aβ clearance by
  increasing LRP-1 mediated uptake of ApoE bound Aβ. (3) Leptin can help degrade Aβ
  by increasing insulin degrading enzyme, a key enzyme involved in the degradation
  of Aβ. (4) Leptin can decrease the formation of insoluble fibrillar Aβ structures
  by decreasing GM1 gangliosides.
