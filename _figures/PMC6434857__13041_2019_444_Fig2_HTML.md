caption: The possible therapeutic implications of resveratrol/metformin/exercise in
  cognition through osteocalcin signalling. Resveratrol, metformin and exercise have
  all been reported to have benefical effects on cognition improvements, which might
  have a link with their regulation on osteocalcin (OCN) from our point of view. Briefly,
  resveratrol on one hand can induce the expression of OCN, which has been found to
  improve age-related cognitive decline via the GRP158/Gad/IP3 pathway, in human bone
  marrow mesenchymal stem cells, murine MC3T3 and ST2 cell lines by decreasing nuclear
  translocation of the NF-κB; on the other hand, several common pathways of SIRT1
  activated by resveratrol on the regulation of OCN and cognition, such as improved
  insulin sensititvity, improved glucose metabolism, reduced oxidative stress and
  inflammation through the suppression of NF-κB, give rise to the possible link between
  resveratrol/SIRT1 and OCN. Metformin could attenuate bone loss and increase bone
  regeneration capability through increased expression of OCN, via a mechanism related
  to AMPK, and regulate behaviours through upregulation of BDNF, which is related
  to the beneficial actions of OCN in age-related memory loss. These findings suggest
  a putative link between metformin therapy and brain functions wherein OCN may act
  as a facilitator of the improved cognitive functions by metformin through improvement
  of neurotrophic signaling and energy metabolism, and through modulation of inflammatory
  reactions. An exercise-induced activation of the IL-6/OCN/gp130 axis that in turn
  improves energy homeostasis and thereby improves cognition could be another plausible
  explanation of why interventional strategies such as exercise can improve cognitive
  ability.
