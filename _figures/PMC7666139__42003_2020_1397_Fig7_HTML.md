caption: (a) Experimental evidence to date places PIRB in an antagonistic role towards
  several kinds of positive receptor signals, including those from B cell antigen
  receptor (BCR). Antagonism is achieved by the binding of SHP1 phosphatase to phosphorylated
  ITIMs, that in turn, prevent critical phosphorylations on BCR by kinases including
  Syk. The SHP1-PIRB relationship also antagonizes pathways associated with neuronal
  plasticity. (b) A similar representation of BCR and PIRB signaling that incorporates
  the HACS1 relationship presented in this study. If HACS1 can either displace or
  compete with SHP1 for binding PIRB, Syk may remain activated thereby enabling enhanced
  BCR signaling and neuronal plasticity. In its adaptor role, HACS1 can bring a different
  set of regulatory and signaling proteins to PIRB.
