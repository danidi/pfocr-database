caption: IL-10 promotes a STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory response characterized
  by reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of
  anti-inflammatory targets. Persistent activation of STAT signaling by IL-10 results
  in a pro-inflammatory response characterized by the up-regulation of STAT1-dependent
  CXCL9 target. In these conditions, RvD1 limits excessive overactivation of the STAT
  pathway while maintaining the IL-10-induced anti-inflammatory response via positive
  regulation of HO-1 through the p38 MAPK pathway. The p38 MAPK pathway also signals
  the actions of RvD1 on IL-1ra, a natural inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory actions
  of IL-1β.
