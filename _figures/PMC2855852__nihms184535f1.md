caption: During aging, gradual dysregulation of Ca2+, oxidative stress, and/or neuroinflammation
  lead to increased production of Aβ, increased activation of CN or both. In turn,
  aberrant CN activity leads to synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation, in part
  through increased stimulation of NFAT1. This chain of events leads to mild cognitive
  impairment (MCI). Note that cyclical interactions between neuroinflammatory processes
  (i.e. glial activation) and synaptic dysfunction) can maintain the CN/NFAT1 pathway
  in an activated state, which helps perpetuate deleterious neuronal and glial activities.
  NFAT1 also helps exacerbate amyloid toxicity through upregulation of BACE1 (see
  text). Eventually, these interactions progress to a degenerative state (i.e. Alzheimer’s
  disease) characterized by severe amyloidosis and severe Ca2+ dyshomeostasis leading
  to greater CN activity. CN triggers neuritic atrophy and cell death cascades through
  preferential activation of NFAT3.
