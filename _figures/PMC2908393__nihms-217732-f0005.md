caption: Aβ accumulation in the brain parenchyma leads to formation of Aβ oligomers
  and amyloid plaques, which are toxic to neurons, whereas its accumulation in the
  perivascular region leads to the formation of CAA, which disrupts vessel function
  and is associated with cerebral haemorrhage. Aβ has a relatively short half-life
  in the brain, ~4 h in older mice and ~6 h in humans. Major Aβ clearance pathways
  include receptor-mediated clearance by cells in brain parenchyma (by neurons and
  glia), along the interstitial fluid (ISF) drainage pathway, through the blood-brain
  barrier (BBB) and proteolytic degradation by endopeptidases. The comparative effects
  of apoE3 and apoE4 are indicated. In all major cellular Aβ clearance pathways, LRP1
  is involved and is likely to clear Aβ either directly or when Aβ binds to its chaperones
  that are also LRP1 ligands (e.g. apoE, α2M). LDLR function in Aβ clearance is likely
  to involve Aβ-apoE complexes. VLDLR also has a role in the clearance of Aβ-apoE
  complexes at the BBB.
