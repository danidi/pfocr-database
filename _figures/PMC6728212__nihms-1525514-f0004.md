caption: The massive influx of calcium in neurons leads to hyper-activation of deleterious
  signaling pathway, and thus excitotoxicity. Among the enzymes activated, calpain,
  a Ca2+ activated protease, cleaves CRMP2. TAT-CBD3 is proposed to prevent the increase
  in intracellular calcium concentration, preventing CRMP2 cleavage and enhancing
  NMDAR internalization and thus providing neuroprotection. Adapted from Brittain
  and colleagues [].
