caption: A common function of LRRK2 in genetic and sPD can be modeled on physiological
  signaling pathways important for neuronal survival. A generic apoptotic neuron (without
  dendrites for simplicity) and reactive glial cells are depicted and highlighted
  pathways are shown along with downstream effects of increased LRRK2 activity. Blue
  arrows indicate a gain-of-function pathway where increased LRRK2 kinase activity
  may drive dysfunction while green arrows highlight the molecular events of pharmacological
  LRRK2 inhibition. (A) LRRK2 has been linked to autophagosome maturation and impaired
  phagocytosis nominating these processes as possible culprits in the clearance of
  aggregated synuclein. (B) LRRK2 is activated in systems of induced inflammation
  while higher LRRK2 levels are seen in immune cells from idiopathic PD patients compared
  with healthy controls. Accumulation of extracellular synuclein can further induce
  an inflammatory response and this, in turn, can lead to LRRK2 activation. (C) LRRK2
  interacts with Rab29 and mediates TGN dynamics while Rab29 expression can drive
  LRRK2 activation. Active LRRK2 phosphorylates Rab GTPases with downstream effects
  on vesicular trafficking as well as impaired autophagy/lysosomal pathways (D) that
  can impair clearance of aggregated proteins. (E) Progressive increase in ROS with
  ageing can activate LRRK2 that in turn can affect mitochondrial function and impair
  mitochondrial clearance through mitophagy.
