caption: Functional pathway analysis of glycoproteins overexpressed in PC3-ML2. Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) was employed to functionally map the cell-surface glycoproteins
  overexpressed in PC3-ML2 cells. The network shows the biological functions (Fx)
  that have been associated with these glycoproteins in the context of disease. “Cell
  movement” and “invasion” are the top listed functions, as determined by the number
  of glycoproteins (highlighted in blue) associated with these activities. Individual
  proteins with known biochemical activities are highlighted with class-specific shapes
  (indicated in the legend).
