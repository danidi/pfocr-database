caption: HDL enhances NO production by eNOS in vascular endothelium. (a) HDL causes
  membrane-initiated signaling, which stimulates eNOS activity. The eNOS protein is
  localized in cholesterol-enriched (orange circles) plasma membrane caveolae as a
  result of the myristoylation and palmitoylation of the protein. Binding of HDL to
  SR-BI via apoAI causes rapid activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase src,
  leading to PI3K activation and downstream activation of Akt kinase and MAPK. Akt
  enhances eNOS activity by phosphorylation, and independent MAPK-mediated processes
  are additionally required. HDL also causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  (intracellular Ca2+ store shown in blue; Ca2+ channel shown in pink), which enhances
  binding of calmodulin (CM) to eNOS. HDL-induced signaling is mediated at least partially
  by the HDL-associated lysophospholipids SPC, S1P, and LSF acting through the G protein–coupled
  lysophospholipid receptor S1P3. HDL-associated estradiol (E2) may also activate
  signaling by binding to plasma membrane–associated estrogen receptors (ERs), which
  are also G protein coupled. It remains to be determined if signaling events are
  also directly mediated by SR-BI (, , , , ). (b) HDL regulates eNOS abundance and
  subcellular distribution. In addition to modulating the acute response, the activation
  of the PI3K–Akt kinase pathway and MAPK by HDL upregulates eNOS expression (open
  arrows). HDL also regulates the lipid environment in caveolae (dashed arrows). Oxidized
  LDL (OxLDL) can serve as a cholesterol acceptor (orange circles), thereby disrupting
  caveolae and eNOS function. However, in the presence of OxLDL, HDL maintains the
  total cholesterol content of caveolae by the provision of cholesterol ester (blue
  circles), resulting in preservation of the eNOS signaling module (–).
