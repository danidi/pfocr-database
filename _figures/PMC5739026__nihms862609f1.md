caption: Three main classes of regulatory small RNAs. (A) miRNAs are transcribed by
  RNA polymerase II (RNA pol) to yield a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcript, which
  is cleaved by Drosha to produce the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). These pre-miRNAs
  are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where they are further processed
  by Dcr-1 to generate an miRNA and miRNA* duplex. Once loaded into the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC), predominately Ago-1-associated RISC, the miRNA strand
  guides translational repression and/or mRNA degradation of target mRNAs. (B) The
  siRNA pathway is subdivided into an endogenous and exogenous pathway, depending
  on the origin of the dsRNA trigger. Endo-siRNAs are derived from the convergent
  transcription of overlapping genes and structural loci; exo-siRNAs are processed
  from the dsRNA byproducts of virus replication or other foreign genetic material.
  dsRNAs derived from these sources are cleaved by the RNase III enzyme, Dcr-2, generating
  siRNA duplexes. These duplexes are then incorporated into a RISC. After removal
  of the passenger strand from the activated RISC, the remaining guide strand directs
  Ago-2 to complementary RNAs in the cell, resulting in their degradation. (C) piRNAs
  are transcribed from genomic loci termed piRNA clusters. Cleavage of these ss transcripts
  by Zucchini (Zuc) generates an initial pool of primary piRNAs, which are loaded
  into Piwi. Secondary piRNAs are generated in a slicer-dependent amplification loop.
  Piwi- or Aub-bound piRNAs direct the cleavage of target strands, generating piRNAs
  that will be bound by Ago-3 and vice versa.
