caption: GPAT isoforms located in mitochondria (GPAT1) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  (GPAT3) catalyze the initial step in the synthesis of TAG. Acyl-CoA use for β-oxidation
  or TAG synthesis is regulated reciprocally by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1)
  and GPAT1. LPA, phosphatidic acid (PA), and DAG, TAG, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),
  phosphatidylcholine (PC), and fatty acid (FA) were used.
