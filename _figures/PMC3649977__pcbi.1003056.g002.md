caption: The activation of the membrane receptor by TRAIL binding promotes the assembly
  of the death-inducing signaling complexes (DISC), which recruit and activate initiator
  (pro-) caspases, including notably caspase-8 (C8) . The recruitment of initiator
  caspases is modulated by FLIP. Once activated, initiator caspases cleave and activate
  effector caspases such as caspase-3 (C3). This effect is reinforced by a feedback
  loop involving caspase-6 (C6). Effector caspases cleave essential structural proteins,
  inhibitors of DNase, and DNA repair proteins (PARP), eventually leading to cell
  death. The cellular effect of effector caspase activation is regulated by factors
  such as the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), which blocks the proteolytic
  activity of caspase-3 by binding tightly to its active site  and promotes its degradation
  via ubiquitination . In addition to the direct activation of effector caspases,
  initiator caspases also activate Bid and Bax . If not kept in check by inhibitors,
  most notably Bcl2, activated Bax directly contributes to the formation of pores
  in the mitochondria outer membrane, leading to MOMP . Following MOMP, critical apoptosis
  regulators, such as Smac and cytochrome c (CyC), translocate into the cytoplasm.
  Smac binds to and inactivates XIAP, thus relieving the inhibition of effector caspases
  by XIAP . Cytochrome c combines with Apaf-1 to form the apoptosome that in turn
  activates the initiator caspase-9 that activates effector caspases.
