number: Figure 3
caption: FAT10 is expressed in response to RNA virus infection and acts as a negative
  feedback regulator of RIG-I activation. 1. dsRNA is sensed by cytosolic RIG-I, which
  is activated and interacts with MAVS. 2. The generated MAVS filaments act as a platform
  for the recruitment of the E3 ligases TRAF3 and TRAF2/TRAF6. 3. TRAF3 is responsible
  for the activation of the TBK1/IKKε complex, which leads to the expression of type-I
  interferons. 4. The recruitment of TRAF2/TRAF6 activates the IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ complex,
  which in turn triggers the canonical NF-kB pathway. 5. Fat10 is one of the genes
  that are induced upon NF-kB stimulation, and its expression in turn inhibits RIG-I
  activation, facilitating viral replication and acting as a negative-feedback modulator
  of the anti-viral response.
