caption: 'GAS5 lncRNA regulates cellular stress responses through multiple mechanisms.
  (A) Various cellular stressors, including serum or nutrient deprivation as well
  as various drug treatments, result in the inhibition of translation and the accumulation
  of GAS5 transcripts, whereby GAS5 negatively regulates cell proliferation and survival.
  (B) The GAS5 RNA molecule comprises three separate regions that mediate the effect
  of GAS5 on cell growth through distinctive mechanisms. These regions are divided
  into 3 modules: a 5′ unstructured region, a highly structured core region, and a
  3′ terminal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding region. Functional analysis indicates
  that the 5′ module mediates the effect of GAS5 on basal cell survival and reducing
  the rate of cell cycle, whereas the core module is required for mediating the effects
  of mTOR inhibitors. (C) The mechanisms by which GAS5 regulate cell proliferation
  in GR-dependent (left) and GR-independent means (right) are shown. For the GR-dependent
  process, GAS5 functions as a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) decoy effectively
  sequestering GR from GRE elements in DNA and suppressing GR-dependent gene expression
  and cellular proliferation. For the GR-independent growth control, GAS5 can function
  as a miRNA sponge to regulate signaling pathways. Additionally, inhibition of the
  mTOR pathway downstream of PI3K/AKT signaling depends on GAS5.'
