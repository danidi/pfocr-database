caption: The deficiency of XPC induces the accumulation of the endogenous DNA damage,
  which activates the ERK pathway. The activated ERK pathway then enhances the expression
  of Snail, which further represses the expression of E-Cadherin. Decreased expression
  of E-Cadherin by XPC silencing leads to a promotion of lung cancer cell proliferation
  and metastasis.
