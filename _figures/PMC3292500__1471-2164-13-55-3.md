caption: The top scored pathway map affected by BaP "Apoptosis and survival_Endoplasmic
  reticulum stress response". Mouse homologs of genes differentially regulated by
  BaP in Oikopleura are indicated on the pathway map by thermometer like symbols (encircled
  for clarity). See Additional file  for detailed figure legend.
