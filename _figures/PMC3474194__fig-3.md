caption: OxLDL-induced cell death in human-monocyte-derived macrophages. Lipid hydroperoxides
  (LOOH) derived from OxLDL are transferred to macrophages, where they, presumably
  after metal ion catalyzed conversion into reactive aldehydes, promote the depletion
  of glutathione (GSH). Increased utilization of GSH as an electron donor for antioxidant
  enzymes, including glutathione peroxidases (GPx) and glutaredoxins (Grx), results
  in the accumulation of glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Increased GSSG formation combined
  with GSH depletion promote the collapse of the GSH/GSSG ratio, disrupting the cellular
  thiol redox system. In a second, mitogen activated kinase kinase of extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent
  pathway, OxLDL induces Nox4-derived H2O2 production. Both the depletion of GSH and
  Nox4-mediated ROS production are required for OxLDL-induced macrophage death, but
  by themselves are not sufficient to promote cell death. Peroxide-mediated oxidation
  of protein thiols (PSH) leads to the formation and accumulation of mixed disulfides
  between protein thiols and GSH (PSSG), presumably via protein sulfenates (PSOH)
  as intermediates. Sustained S-glutathionylation and subsequent inactivation of key
  macrophage proteins are likely to contribute to the toxic effect of OxLDL on macrophages.
