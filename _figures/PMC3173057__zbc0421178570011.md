caption: Schematic view of the proposed HSP60-TLR4 signaling in response to myocardial
  ischemia. In response to ischemic stress, myocardium releases the stress protein
  HSP60 locally and into the systemic circulation. The endogenously released HSP60
  acts on the cell surface TLR4 in paracrine and/or autocrine fashion. HSP60 activates
  myocardial IRAK-1 via TLR4-MyD88 signal pathway. HSP60 also induces CM apoptosis
  via FADD- and caspase-8-dependent mechanisms as both FADD-DN and z-IETD-fmk can
  block the HSP60-induced apoptosis. Finally, I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis and
  inflammation (cytokine expression) in vivo are partially dependent on HSP60-TLR4
  signaling. TLR4 deletion or anti-HSP60 antibody attenuates I/R-induced myocardial
  apoptosis and inflammation.
