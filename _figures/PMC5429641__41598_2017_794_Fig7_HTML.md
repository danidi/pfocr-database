caption: Proposed mechanism of neuroprotective action of MMP-9 in preventing Aβ-mediated
  impairment of the insulin survival pathway. Aβ oligomers generated during early
  stages of AD stimulate pro-apoptotic pathways, such as TNFR signaling, which activates
  JNK kinase, resulting in neuronal insulin resistance via IRS1-Ser636 phosphorylation
  and GSK-3β activation. MMP-9 protects, in part, by reducing Aβ amyloid peptide accumulation,
  thus blocking Aβ oligomeric-induced defects in insulin signaling. MMP-9 also provides
  an additional stimulus to insulin, by increasing BDNF levels. The latter binds to
  the TrkB receptor, inducing IRS1-Tyr465 phosphorylation and Akt activation, hence
  contributing to normal neuronal function.
