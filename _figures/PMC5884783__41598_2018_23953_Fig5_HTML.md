caption: A working hypothesis of the association between critical metabolites across
  the mammary gland for milk synthesis. Metabolites in the right part in white denote
  a quantitatively significant difference between the artery and vein within the three
  diets. Metabolites in the green box and brown box denote a significant correlation
  between mammary uptake and the clearance of metabolites and milk performance, respectively.
  The red line denotes the significantly positive correlation between these 2 items,
  while the blue line denotes the significantly negative correlation between these
  2 items. The metabolites in red indicate the highest positive correlation with the
  milk yield or feed intake; and those in blue indicate the highest negative correlation
  with the milk yield or feed intake. The black double-sided arrow indicates that
  the correlation with the metabolites was always the opposite between these 2 items.
