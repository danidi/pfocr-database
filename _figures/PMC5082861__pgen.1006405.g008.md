caption: The Ras1-cAMP-PKA signaling cascade is a known master regulator of C. albicans
  filamentous growth. The Rho1-Pkc1 cell wall integrity pathway is previously reported
  as a key modulator of cell wall integrity through activation of a MAPK cascade that
  terminates with Mkc1. Key proteins involved in both signaling cascades are depicted
  along with black arrows showing connections between these regulators. Our work identifies
  a novel role for Pkc1 in governing C. albicans morphogenesis by directly or indirectly
  regulating Cyr1 function (red dashed arrow) and through distinct effector(s) remain
  to be identified (red dashed arrow).
