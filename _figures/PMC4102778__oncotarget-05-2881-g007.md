caption: The Hh pathway normally inhibits the membrane spanning PTCH1 GPCR receptor
  which is indicated by a squiggly red line crossing the membrane 14 times. PTCH1
  normally inhibits SMO which is indicated by a purple squiggly line which crosses
  the membrane 7 times. SMO is then activated in the primary cilium and serves to
  inhibit SUFU which is indicated by a red octagon. SUFU normally inhibits the GLI1
  and GLI2 transcriptions factors which are indicated in blue diamonds. The Rab23
  GTPase may aid in the nuclear translocation of the transcription factors and is
  indicated by a purple oval. In contrast, GLI3 is activated by SUFU and may serve
  as a transcriptional repressor and is regulated by GSK-3. It is indicated in a black
  diamond. One of the genes that are regulated by GLI signaling is IGF2. Dysregulation
  of Hh signaling pathway occurs in certain cancers. Resistance to Hh pathway inhibitors
  may result from mutations in the pathways which lead to increased pathway expression
  and autocrine IGF2 expression. This figure is presented to give the reader an idea
  of the negative regulation of the Hh pathway by various components
