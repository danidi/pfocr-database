caption: 'Bile acid synthesis pathways. In the liver, cholesterol is catabolized to
  bile acids by two pathways involving ~17 enzymes. The classic bile acid synthesis
  pathway is initiated by CYP7A1 in the liver, and the alternative bile acid synthesis
  pathway is initiated by CYP27A1 in the liver, macrophages, and adrenal glands, and
  CYP46A1 in the brain. Key enzymes involved in steroid ring modification, peroxisomal
  β-oxidation, cleavage of the steroid side chain, and bile acid conjugation are shown.
  In humans, CA and CDCA are the primary bile acids synthesized in the liver. In mice,
  Cyp2c70 converts CDCA to α- and β-MCA. In the intestine, primary bile acids undergo
  biotransformation. Conjugated bile acids are deconjugated by gut bacteria BSH, then
  bacteria 7α-dehydroxylase converts CA and CDCA to DCA and LCA, respectively. In
  human intestine, a small amount of CDCA can be converted to UDCA by 7β-HSDH. In
  mice, Cyp2c70 can also convert UDCA to β-MCA. The location of the hydroxyl group
  in each of the primary and secondary bile acids are indicated. Abbreviations: 7β-HSDH,
