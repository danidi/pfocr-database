caption: Radiation-induced double strand breaks or gemcitabine-induced replication
  stress trigger the activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM and
  Rad3-related (ATR) kinases, respectively (). Active ATM/ATR phosphorylate and activate
  Chk1 and Chk2 (-) which phosphorylate Cdc25 phosphatases, leading to their inactivation
  through degradation (Cdc25A) or cytoplasmic sequestration (Cdc25C) (, ). In the
  absence of Cdc25 phosphatase activity, cyclin dependent kinases (Cdk1 and Cdk2)
  remain bound by inhibitory phosphorylations, resulting in arrest of the cell cycle
  at G1/S, intra-S, or G2/M. Treatment of cells with gemcitabine prior to radiation
  results in radiosensitization that can be attributed to a number of events (Box
  1), including dATP depletion and S-phase arrest. Inhibition of Chk1 sensitizes cells
  to gemcitabine and radiation by a number of potential mechanisms including abrogation
  of cell cycle arrest, premature mitotic entry, and inhibition of Rad 51 focus formation
  resulting in impaired homologous recombination repair (HRR).EGFR is phosphorylated
  in response to radiation or gemcitabine by an unknown mechanism(s) (). Radiation
  triggers translocation of EGFR into the nucleus (, ). This process coincides with
  transport of Ku70/80 and protein phosphatase 1 into the nucleus, resulting in increases
  in DNA-PK, repair of DNA-strand breaks (NHEJ; nonhomologous endjoining), and cell
  survival. Activation of EGFR in response to gemcitabine can also result in activation
  of the survival signal AKT (). Activating Ras mutations can result in activation
  of Ras-dependent pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, even in the presence of EGFR inhibitors.
  EGFR inhibitors prevent gemcitabine and/or radiation-mediated EGFR signaling and
  are thought to impair cell survival signals and DNA repair. EGFR inhibition blocks
  nuclear transport of EGFR and DNA-PK activity (, ). In some instances, phosphorylation
  of EGFR by gemcitabine promotes ubiquitination of the receptor leading to degradation
  along a proteosome/lysosome pathway (). EGFR degradation results in down-regulation
  of the survival signal pAKT, leading to apoptosis. Blocking EGFR degradation at
  various steps of this pathway reduces gemcitabine-mediated cytotoxicity. Whether
  an EGFR-activating insult leads to cell survival or cell death may ultimately be
  determined by the severity and duration of the stress. The colored arrows indicate
  the effects mediated by gemcitabine (red) versus radiation (blue). Dotted lines
  indicate less pronounced effects.
