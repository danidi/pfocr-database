caption: 'Hippo is regulated by multiple signals generated by the physical (matrix
  stiffness) and biochemical (LPA, S1P, thrombin) environment. Importantly, many of
  these signals are modulated by tension in the actinomyosin cytoskeleton. Modulation
  of cytoskeletal mechanics through G-protein coupled receptors and matrix biophysics
  can likewise inhibit YAP/TAZ directly at the nuclear translocation stage or through
  activation of Hippo components. Note: This schematic is simplified to clarify the
  major components in the mechanical regulation of YAP/TAZ signaling.'
