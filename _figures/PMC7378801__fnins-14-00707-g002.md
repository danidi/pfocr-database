caption: Many forms of spinocerebellar ataxia are attributed to mutations in intracellular
  calcium signaling, glutamate release or the PKC pathway, which form multiple positive
  feedback loops. Disruption of calcium and glutamate signaling is hypothesized to
  initiate Purkinje cell dysfunction, resulting in ataxia and eventual cell death.
  Diseases indicated in red are reported to have dysfunction of this component of
  the signaling pathway.
