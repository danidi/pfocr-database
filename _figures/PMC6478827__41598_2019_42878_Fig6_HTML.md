caption: Model of cell cycle regulation in GCs of small follicles. Arrested GCs of
  primordial follicles express the transcription factor SMAD3, which directly promotes
  expression of CCND2 and represses Myc. In this ‘poised’ state, CCND2 is bound by
  the inhibitory factor P27. In transitional GCs, P27 dissociates from CCND2 and SMAD3
  expression transiently increases, possibly via elevated TGFβ signalling, allowing
  maintenance of CCND2 expression for cell cycle progression. Increased SMAD3 promotes
  expression of factors such as Smad7, which act to inhibit SMAD3 in a self-regulatory
  manner. The eventual loss of SMAD3 leads to de-repression of Myc and activation
  of SMAD-independent TGFβ signalling involving mTOR to drive GC proliferation in
  growing follicles. Solid black line arrows indicate predominant signalling pathway.
  Coloured block arrows indicate moderate (unfilled arrows) or substantial (filled
  arrows) changes in expression relative to primordial stage. Note in growing follicles,
  although SMAD3 and CCND2 are reduced, they are still detectable and play an essential
  role in regulation of the GC cycle. PF, primordial; T, transitional; P, primary
  follicle.
