caption: Changes in metabolism involving the corticostriatal pathway lead to improved
  circuit specific changes. The left panel highlights some of the features of the
  corticostriatal circuit in sedentary animals when synaptic activity is low. Glucose
  serves as the primary energy substrate in neurons catabolized to pyruvate by glycolysis
  and shuttled into mitochondria to the TCA cycle and ETC for oxidative phosphorylation.
  Mitochondria (small checkered ovals) generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.
  Expression of regulatory factors such as HIF is attenuated under normoxia. The right
  panel highlights changes in the corticostriatal circuit with exercise. Neuronal
  activation leads to significant metabolic changes at the synapse including reduced
  glucose and depletion of oxygen. Activation of astrocytes leads to an increase in
  aerobic glycolysis elevating levels of lactate from glucose substrates. Lactate
  is transported to neurons via the astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) for conversion
  to pyruvate providing an alternative substrate source for mitochondria energetics.
  Astrocytes located near synapses may have a unique function in neuroplasticity in
  that they can detect increased activity through changes in potassium release, glutamate
  neurotransmission, increased oxidative stress through ROS, and depletion of oxygen
  and glucose. It has yet to be established how these mechanisms may or may not differ
  from those astrocytes metabolically associated with neuron cell bodies for example.
  Changes in blood flow are both acute due to dilation by nitric oxide and prostaglandins
  and chronic due to increased expression of factors such as HIF-1α dependent VEGF.
  Increased blood flow and peripheral effects of exercise elevate blood glucose and
  lactate levels that can be transported to astrocytes and neurons via transporters
  including MCTs and GluTs
