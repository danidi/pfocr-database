caption: These are mediated by Piwi-class Argonaute proteins (ovals), a | The Piwi-interacting
  (pi)RNA pathway operates in the Drosophila melanogaster and vertebrate germ line.
  A ‘ping-pong’ strategy amplifies piRNAs from complementary transcripts, in which
  the slicer activity of Piwi proteins (Piwi, Aubergine (AUB) and AGO3 in D. melanogaster)
  reciprocally define piRNA 5′ ends. The mechanism that defines the 3′ ends of piRNAs
  is not known. A conserved role of the piRNA pathway is to restrict transposon activity
  in the germ line; however, there might be other roles for abundant non-transposon-derived
  piRNAs that are found in mammals, b | Nematode 21U RNAs might be a functional analogue
  of piRNAs. These 21-nucleotide RNAs begin with U and are produced from genomic loci
  with a characteristic upstream motif (CTGTTTCA), and they are bound by the Piwi
  protein PRG-1. The details of 21U biogenesis and function are unclear, but 21Us
  are linked to spermatogenesis and control of Tc3 transposition. 2Ome, 2′-O-methyl
  group.
