caption: Schematic of the Insulin Signalling Pathway and insulin resistance. The insulin
  receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which undergoes dimerisation and autophosphorylation
  on insulin binding. The phosphorylated receptor recruits and phosphorylates the
  insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) on tyrosine residues, which then recruits dimeric
  PI3 kinase via SH2 domains on the p85 subunit. PI3 kinase catalyses the phosphorylation
  of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) at the plasma membrane to PIP3 (reversed
  by PTEN), which then recruits PIP3-dependent kinase (PDK) and Akt, allowing PDK
  to phosphorylate and activate Akt. Activated Akt phosphorylates and inactivates
  the Rab10 GAP, AS160, allowing sustained Rab10 activation which plays a critical
  role in trafficking of GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) to the plasma membrane and
  surface expression of GLUT4. High levels of free fatty acids lead to an accumulation
  of lipid-derived second messengers, e.g. diacylglycerol and ceramide, which can
  inhibit the pathway at several different stages.
