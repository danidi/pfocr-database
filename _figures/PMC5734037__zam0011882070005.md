caption: NMP degradative pathway by enzymes encoded in the nmpABCDEF gene cluster
  of Alicycliphilus sp. strain BQ1. Enzymatic activities proposed for the proteins
  encoded by the nmpA-nmpB, nmpC, and nmpF genes are indicated; the nmpD and nmpE
  genes encode a hypothetical protein and a putative PucR family transcriptional regulator,
  respectively. Based on protein sequence comparison, a demethylation reaction for
  the AAO encoded by the nmpC gene that transforms γ-N-methylaminobutyric acid into
  GABA and a putative GABA-AT activity required for GABA transformation to SSA are
  shown (dashed arrows). However, experimental data support the possibility that a
  deamination reaction directly transforming γ-N-methylaminobutyric acid into SSA
  is the most probable activity for NMPC (solid arrows).
