caption: As a thymidylate synthase inhibitor pemetrexed causes DNA damage and increases
  the levels of ZMP due to inhibition of AICAR. Sildenafil, as a PDE5 inhibitor, increases
  the levels of cGMP which activates PKG and subsequently leads to the generation
  of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide enhances the activation of ATM caused initially by
  DNA damage. ATM signals to activate the AMPK which is further allosterically activated
  by ZMP. Collectively this strong AMPK signal inactivates RAPTOR and TSC2 resulting
  in the inactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Downstream of mTOR is the kinase ULK-1;
  the drug combination via AMPK promotes ULK-1 S317 phosphorylation which activates
  the kinase; the drug combination via mTOR inactivation reduces ULK-1 S757 phosphorylation
  which also activates the kinase. Activated ULK-1 phosphorylates ATG13 which is the
  key gate-keeper step in permitting autophagosome formation. Sildenafil-induced PKG
  signaling also acts to reduce the activities of multiple chaperone proteins which
  is augmented by DNA damage induced ATM signaling. Reduced HSP90 and HSP70 function
  lowers the activities of STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2 and AKT that results in lower expression
  of ROS / RNS detoxifying enzymes such as TRX and SOD2. Reduced GRP78 function causes
  activation of PERK and subsequently eIF2α. Enhanced eIF2α signaling reduces the
  transcription of proteins with short half-lives such as c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL,
  and enhances expression of Beclin1, DR4 and DR5. Thus the convergent actions of
  reduced HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone activity and eIF2α signaling lead to a profound
  reduction in the protein levels of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL which facilitates
  death receptor signaling through CD95, DR4 and DR5 to activate the extrinsic apoptosis
  pathway. Enhanced Beclin1 expression converges with elevated ATG13 phosphorylation
  to produce high levels of autophagosome formation that, when fused with lysosomes
  and releasing proteases into the cytosol, converges with the extrinsic apoptosis
  pathway to cleave BID and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Tumor cell killing downstream
  of the mitochondrion was mediated by AIF and not caspases 3/7. The tumoricidal actions
  of AIF were facilitated by reduced HSP70 functionality as this chaperone can sequester
  AIF in the cytosol and prevent its translocation to the nucleus.
