caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanisms of intracellular actions of CTS
  showing CTS suppresses IL-1β induced proinflammatory gene induction by intercepting
  salient steps in the NF-κB signaling cascade to inhibit its transcriptional activity
  by: (i) suppressing IL-1β-induced TAK1 activation and thus phosphorylation and activation
  of IKK. The suppression of IKK activity results in the inhibition of phosphorylation
  and proteosomal degradation of IκBα and IkBβ, thus inhibiting nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB. (ii) During the initial 30 min, CTS up-regulates IκBα nuclear translocation
  to prevent NF-κB binding to the DNA and facilitates export of nuclear NF-κB, that
  may enter the nucleus due to rapid actions of IL-1β. (iii) CTS represses IL-1β-induced
  IκBα and IκBβ mRNA expression to the control levels and also prevents NF-κB DNA
  binding. Collectively, these actions of CTS inhibit proinflammatory gene induction
  and molecules involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling cascade. The red dots
  indicate steps within the NF-κB pathway that are inhibited by CTS. The green dots
  indicate molecular events within the NF-κB pathway that are augmented by CTS.'
