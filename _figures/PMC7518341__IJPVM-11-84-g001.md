caption: 'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) causes the production of angiotensin
  (1-7) Ang-(1-7) from angiotensin-2 (AngII). Ang (1-7) causes the production of Mas
  protein, which leads to the formation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
  as the main protein in neurogenesis, and inhibits occurrences of oxidative stress,
  inflammation and apoptosis and also cause modulation of the mood-related disorder.
  Ang (1-7) causes activation of AT2R, which is angiotensin receptor type-2. Activation
  of AT2R plays a critical role in the management of the normal function of brain
  vascular endothelial. According to some indirect evidence, it seems the infection
  by the COVID-19 virus can cause distributing ACE-2/Mas/BDNF signaling pathway and
  can have unknown neurological and mental sequels. eNOS: Endothelial-derived nitric
  oxide syntheses; NO: Nitric oxide; MDA: Malondialdehyde; SOD: Superoxide dismutase;
  GPx: Glutathione peroxidase; GR: Glutathione reductase; TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha;
