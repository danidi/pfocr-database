caption: Molecular events shown by associated predicates. The figure shows a hypothetical
  signal transduction pathway of an idealized cell. The signal is triggered at the
  outer membrane ligand-binding to receptor dimers. This signal is mediated (by various
  proteins) to the nucleus of the cell using various events (protein-protein interactions,
  phosphorylation etc.) and initiates transcription of a gene. The protein product
  (after splicing, translation and synthesis) of the gene inhibits receptor signaling.
  Thus, it regulates its own expression levels via a negative feedback loop. The direction
  of information flow is shown with arrows. Cell compartments, molecular entities
  and predicates describing various events are shown. The predicates analyzed in this
  work aim to cover events in gene expression, regulation and signaling processes.
