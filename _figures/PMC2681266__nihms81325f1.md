caption: 'NF-κB activation in cancer. NF-κB activation in cancer development is linked
  with chronic exposure to bacteria, certain viral products, chemical promoters, and
  carcinogens and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause repeated DNA damage.
  Induction also occurs in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy and ionizing radiation.
  A. Canonical NF-κB Pathway activation occurs in response these bacterial, viral,
  chemical or physical stimuli; by aberrant cytokine, integrin and growth factor ligand/receptor
  activation (e.g., TNFR, IL-1R, Integrin α6β4, EGFR, Her2/Neu and other serum factors);
  expression of activating fusion proteins following translocations (BCR-ABL, MALT1);
  or aberrant activation by intermediate kinases (e.g., PI3K, CK2, AKT). Intermediate
  kinases convey signals to the Inhibitor-κB complex formed by IKKα, β and γ, and
  IKKβ phosphorylates Inhibitor-κB, marking it for ubiquitiantion by E3 ligase βTrCP
  (SCF) and proteasome degradation. P105/RELA or cREL is processed to NF-κB1 (p50)/RELA
  or cREL heterodimers, which translocate to the nucleus, and bind promoters of genes
  regulating proliferation, apoptosis, migration inflammation, angiogenesis and innate
  immunity. B. Alternative or Non-canonical Pathway. The alternative pathway may be
  activated by other TNF family members via NIK, and involves IKKα/ IKKα homodimers,
  which activate NF-κB2/p100 for processing into p52/RELB heterodimers. The REL-B/p52
  heterodimer then translocates into the nucleus to bind the promoter of genes whose
  products are important for the malignant phenotype in some cancers and B cell development
  and adaptive immunity. Abbreviations: NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; IKK, Inhibitor-κB
  kinase; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase; IL-1R, Interleukin 1 Receptor; EGFR, Epidermal
  Growth Factor Receptor; TNFR, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase.'
