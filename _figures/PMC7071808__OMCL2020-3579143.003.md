caption: Radiation induced IGF-1 selective resistance. Insulin-like growth factor-1
  (IGF-1) is structurally similar to insulin. It can activate the IRS/PI3K/Akt pathway
  (PI3K dependent) and the Grb/Shc/MAPK pathway (PI3K independent) through IGF-R,
  IR, or the hybrid receptor. However, radiation can inhibit the anti-inflammatory
  and antioxidant stress of the IRS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway but not inhibit the
  inflammatory MAPK kinase pathway, which leads to the transformation of the IGF-1
  signal to the oxidation and inflammatory environment, which leads to selective resistance
  of IGF-1. ROS can also cause selective inhibition of IRS/PI3K/Akt pathway and even
  enhance the MAPK signaling pathway. IGF-1 selective resistance causes an imbalance
  between NO and ET-1 production, resulting in endothelial dysfunction, resulting
  in oxidative stress and inflammatory level and further leads to the occurrence and
  development of radiation-induced heart diseases.
