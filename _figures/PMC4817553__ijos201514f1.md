caption: The Hedgehog signalling pathway in Drosophila and vertebrates. (a) In Drosophila,
  Ptc inhibits Smo activity by suppressing the membrane stabilisation of Smo in the
  absence of Hh ligand. The Cos2, Ci, Fu and Sufu complex recruits kinases, such as
  PKA, CK1, Gsk3β, and promotes the cleavage of full-length Ci to become its repressor
  form (CiR) in a Slmb-dependent manner. Hh signalling transduction is blocked. (b)
  In Drosophila, Smo inhibition by Ptc is removed in the presence of Hh ligand. Smo
  is relocated to the plasma membrane and activated by several kinases, such as CK1,
  CK2, Gprk2 and PKA. The Fu-Cos2 complex is recruited to Smo and releases Ci. The
  released Ci is not cleaved and remains in its active form (CiA). CiA translocates
  into the nucleus and activates Hh downstream gene expression. (c) In vertebrates,
  Ptch1 is located in the cilium, whereas Smo is kept outside of cilium in the absence
  of Hh ligands. Gli is phosphorylated by kinases, such as PKA, CK1 and Gsk3β, which
  promote the processing of the repressor form (GliR) in a β-Trcp-dependent manner.
  Hh signalling is blocked. (d) In vertebrates, when Hh ligands bind to Ptch1, Smo
  inhibition is relieved. Ptch1 exits from the cilium, whereas Smo is translocated
  to cilium. The repressor form of the Gli (GliR), Sufu and Kif7 complex travels from
  the base of the cilium to the top via intraflagellar transport (IFT). Kif7 blocks
  the function of Sufu at the top of the cilium. Gli is not processed and ismaintained
  its active form (GliA). Activated Gli travels from the top of the cilium to the
  cytoplasm via IFT and translocates to the nucleus to transcript target genes thereby
  activating Hh signalling.

  description: The Hedgehog signalling pathway in Drosophila and vertebrates. (a)
    In Drosophila, Ptc inhibits Smo activity by suppressing the membrane stabilisation
