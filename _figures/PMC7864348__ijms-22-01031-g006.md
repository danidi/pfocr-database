caption: IWARS1 and IKARS1 cells established from wild-type and AR-deficient C57BL/6
  mice as useful tools for exploring collateral glucose-utilizing pathways. Our current
  investigation using these cell lines focuses on the mechanisms of glucosamine accumulation
  in the PNS under hyperglycemic conditions regardless of the presence or absence
  of AR, and its association with hexosamine pathway hyperactivity that may impair
  insulin signaling.
