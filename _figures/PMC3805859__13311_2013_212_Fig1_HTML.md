caption: Integration of microRNA and epigenetic regulation pathways. (A) MicroRNAs
  can regulate the expression of epigenetic modifier genes (such as EZH2 or MECP2)
  by post-transcriptional gene silencing. MicroRNAs are transcribed as long primary
  (pri-miRNA) transcripts and then sequentially processed to generate the mature miRNA
  species. The miRNA RNA induced silencing complex (miRISC, which includes AGO2, Dicer
  and TARBP2) loaded with a mature miRNA searches the cytoplasm for its cognate target
  (e.g. the EZH2 or MECP2 mRNA). Silencing of EZH2 or MECP2 expression leads to global
  alterations in the epigenome. (B) MicroRNA genes are frequently inactivated by epimutations
  in cancers. Therefore, epigenetic alterations can affect miRNA expression. Black
  lollipops indicate DNA methylation. (C) Endogenous miRNAs can induce transcriptional
  gene silencing of complementary target promoters. Pri-miRNAs are processed by the
  conventional miRNA processing pathway but the mature miRNA species is loaded into
  AGO1 instead of AGO2. AGO1 is the core component of the RNA Induced Transcriptional
  Silencing (RITS) complex which also includes HDAC1, SUV39H, EZH2 and DNMT3A. RITS
  is guided to a complementary promoter-associated RNA by its bound miRNA. Recruitment
  of RISC induces heterochromatin formation and promoter DNA methylation at the target
  promoter
