caption: 'Biosynthesis pathways of phospholipid components in archaea. Abbreviations
  for the archaeal mevalonate (MVA) pathway: AACT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HMGS,
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase;
  MVK, mevalonate kinase; IPK, isopentenyl phosphate kinase; IDI2, isopentenyl diphosphate
  isomerase type II. GHMP, galactokinase-homoserine kinase-mevalonate kinase-phosphomevalonate
  kinase; IPPS, isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (asterisks indicate enzymes shared
  with the eukaryotic MVA pathway). Abbreviations for the hypothetical archaeal fatty
  acid (FA) synthesis pathway: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase;
  KR-PhaB, beta-ketoacyl reductase; DH-MaoC/PhaJ, beta-hydroxyacyl dehydratase; ER,
  enoyl reductase; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. Abbreviations for the
  sn-glycerol-1-phosphate synthesis pathway: G1PDH, glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  DHQS, 3-dehydroquinate synthase; GDH, glycerol dehydrogenase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase.
  Abbreviations for the phospholipid assembly pathway: GGGPS, (S)-3-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl
  phosphate synthase; DGGGPS, (S)-2,3-di-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase;
  GGR, geranylgeranyl reductase; CDSA, CDP diglyceride synthetase. (#) points to the
  ability of GGRs to reduce isoprenoids at different steps in the biosynthesis pathway.
  Names between parentheses indicate the family or superfamily to which belong the
  archaeal enzymes postulated to carry out particular functions on the basis of phylogenomic
  analyses.'
