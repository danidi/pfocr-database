caption: NF-κB signaling pathway and cancer related mutations. Only canonical (classical)
  pathway is shown. Extracellular stimuli transmitted though receptor complexes activate
  IKK via phosphorylation. Consequently, IKK phosphorylates IκB, leading to its dissociation
  from inactive NF-κB complex and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Freed
  from IκB, active NF-κB dimer translocates into the nucleus and induces the transcription
  of various target genes involved in multiple cellular pathways. Cancer-relevant
  mutations, indicated in orange boxes, can occur in all steps of NF-κB signaling
  cascade.
