caption: Exercise increases both IGF-1 and neuregulin (NRG-1), activating the PI3K-AKT1
  pathway, which in turn inhibits the transcription factor C/EBPβ in the nucleus.
  Downregulation of C/EPBβ activates the expression of a physiological gene set that
  drives cardiac growth by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and proliferation, including
  upregulation of CITED4. CITED4 binds CBP/p300, either in the cytoplasm or nucleus,
  and also activates genes involved in cardiomyocyte growth and proliferation. Moreover,
  exercise leads to the differential expression of specific miRNAs, including some
  that are upregulated (e.g. miR-21 and miR-144) and others that are downregulated
  (e.g. miR-124 and potentially miR-29), that target and help regulate various components
  of IGF-1-PI3K-AKT1 signaling among other pathways. Lastly, exercise-induced release
  of catecholamines and activation of AKT1 concurrently mediate angiogenesis and other
  protective vascular remodeling via activation of eNOS.
