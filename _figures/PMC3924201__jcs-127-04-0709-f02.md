caption: Hippo pathway-mediated regulation of cell lineage and pluripotency by adhesion
  and epithelial polarization in the early mouse embryo. Compaction of the mouse embryo
  at the pre-implantation stage leads to the development of two different cell lineages,
  trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) (shown on the left). The TE is a polarized
  epithelium with E-cadherin (E-cad)-mediated adherens junctions (AJs), tight junctions
  (TJs) and apical–basolateral polarity (illustrated on the right); it differentiates
  into an extra-embryonic tissue, the placenta. The ICM contains adhesive cells that
  are non-polarized and form pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which give rise
  to the embryo proper. Recruitment of angiomotin (AMOT) to the E-cad–catenin complexes
  of inner cells stimulates Hippo pathway signaling and restricts the transcriptional
  activity of YAP through its exclusion from the nucleus, thereby allowing expression
  of the pluripotency gene Nanog. AMOT becomes restricted to the apical domain of
  the outer cells by the action of polarity protein complexes during epithelialization,
  which leads to a loss of Hippo pathway signaling, nuclear accumulation of YAP and
  transcriptional activation of TE-specific transcription factor Cdx2. β-cat, β-catenin;
  α-cat, α-catenin.
