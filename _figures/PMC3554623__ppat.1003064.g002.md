caption: Viral nucleic acids may be recognized in a host cell by membrane-bound Toll-like
  receptors (TLR3) or cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). When activated by nucleic-acid
  binding, RLRs recruit and activate the signaling adaptor molecule IPS-1, which recruits
  a signaling complex that activates latent cytoplasmic transcription factors such
  as interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). TLR3 activation
  stimulates the recruitment of the adaptor TRIF, which acts as a platform for a variety
  of signaling molecules that also phosphorylate IRF3 or NF-κB. When signaled, the
  C-terminus of IRF3 is phosphorylated, causing a conformational change that leads
  to dimerization and nuclear translocation. NF-κB is held inactive by inhibitor of
  NF-κB (IκB). Signals generated during viral infection cause phosphorylation of IκB,
  followed by ubiquitination (orange circles) and proteasomal degradation mediated
  by the SKP-CUL-F-box-β-TrCP (SCFβ-TrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. NF-κB subsequently
  translocates to the nucleus. IRF3 and NF-κB bind to the IFN-β promoter in a cooperative
  manner with c-Jun/ATF-2 forming an enhanceosome complex initiating the transcription
  of IFN-β mRNA. Additional transcription factors, including IRF7, are induced by
  IFN-β and can also bind to the IFN-β promoter to enhance the transcription of IFN-β
  and IFN-α genes. PI3K activity may be required for mediating TLR3 and RIG-I signaling
  by an unknown mechanism (dashed line). PKR responds to dsRNA binding by phosphorylating
  eIF2α, which ultimately inhibits translation initiation. PKR is also thought to
  promote the secretion of IFN-β by an unknown mechanism (dashed line). Rotavirus
  can antagonize innate signaling pathways through several avenues (shown in red),
  the primary one representing the NSP1-induced degradation of IRF3 and IRF7. Some
  NSP1 proteins are also known to induce the degradation of β-TrCP. Rotavirus NSP3
  can also impede antiviral responses by suppressing the translation of host mRNAs
  generated from IFN-stimulated genes. By sequestering viral RNAs within viroplasms,
  the virus can prevent their recognition by PKR, RIG-I, MDA-5, and other sensors
  that upregulate antiviral responses.
