caption: 'The unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. The three types of UPR signal
  transducers are PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. IRE1 has both kinase and endoribonuclease
  identity. When IRE1 is activated, a small intron of XBP1 is removed to form sXBP1,
  which involves the transcription of genes that restores ER folding ability. PERK
  phosphorylates eIF2a attenuating mRNA translation, but it specifically induces the
  transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, which will induce the occurrence of related
  reactions such as protein synthesis and apoptosis. ATF6 is translocated into the
  Golgi where it is cleaved to expose the transcriptionally active cytoplasmic domain
  of ATF6. The direct target of the cleaved ATF6 is the UPR proteins, such as chaperones.
  Also, ATF6 can also induce CHOP and XBP1 genes. PERK: protein kinase RNA-like ER
  kinase; IRE1: inositolrequiring enzyme 1; ATF6: activating transcription factor
  6; BIP: Immunoglobulin binding protein; eIF2a: eukaryotic initiation factor 2a;
  XBP1: X-box binding protein; S1P: protease site 1 protease; S2P: protease site 2
  protease; CHOP: transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein; mTOR: mammalian target
  of rapamycin; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase.'
