caption: 'AC activation: Extracellular cAMP stimulation of the CAR1/G protein complex
  mediates Ras activation, which leads to activation of PI3K and accumulation of PIP3.
  PIP3 recruits the PH domain proteins CRAC, Akt (et al.) to the membrane where they
  become functionally active. Activation of the Akt and membrane-bound PKBR1 kinases
  require phosphorylation by PDK1 and the TOR complex 2 (TORC2; TOR, Pia, RIP3, Lst8).
  CRAC and Akt/PKBR1 are both required to activate ACA at a distal site in the cell.
  TORC2 regulation by PI3K or of ACA is not known. Activated ACA synthesizes cAMP,
  which has both intracellular and extracellular functions. Secreted cAMP relays the
  original signal and directs chemotaxis. Intracellular cAMP activates PKA.cAMP Degradation:
  The extracellular and intracellular pools of cAMP are degraded by separate phosphodiesterase
  (PDE) pathways. Developing Dictyostelium secrete a PDE that clears the extracellular
  cAMP signal. Intracellular degradation is more complex. Active RegA is a primary
  intracellular cAMP PDE, subject to phosphorylation and inhibition by ERK2. In quiescent
  cells, ERK2 is inactive, RegA is active and intracellular cAMP levels are low; upon
  receptor stimulation, an ERK2 kinase is activated and an ERK2 PPase is inactivated.
  ERK2 becomes active, RegA is inhibited, and cAMP levels rise. It is inferred that
  activated PKA has a negative feedback role for the intracellular accumulation of
  cAMP, although the mechanism is not defined. PKA does alter the phosphorylation
  of ERK2. RegA has a putative PKA site, potentially making it a regulatory motif.Adaptation:
  The actions of the various PDEs are not sufficient to produce oscillations in cAMP;
  an inhibitory, adaptive response is also required. Many CAR1/G protein mediated
  responses to cAMP are only transiently active and adapt (de-activate) to a continuous
  cAMP stimulus. The Ras/PI3K pathway adapts in <30 sec., with ACA activity declining
  in <2 min. PTEN is able to degrade PIP3. While the activating pathway for ERK2 is
  also attenuated, the PPase response is non-adaptive and remains inactive if extracellular
  levels of cAMP persist. The adaptive/inhibitory pathways are not understood mechanistically.
  They are impacted by G protein signaling, and perhaps by receptor phosphorylation,
  and could potentially involve the cyclical activations/de-activations of Ras-GEFs
  and Ras-GAPs. Direct feedback inhibition of ACA is also postulated.Component descriptions
  are described in the text.'
