caption: Summary of the systemic involvement of choline-containing species and their
  potential relationship with inflammatory processes. Increased immune activity in
  the liver- and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in the colon on F. hepatica
  infection may lead to cell-internal lipid degradation to arachidonic acid, which
  is the substrate of many eicosanoic pro-inflammatory mediators. The spleen and the
  kidney, in which inflammatory activity is less extensive, respond to the infection
  with increased betaine, which shares the same pathway. AA, amino acids; CDP-Cho,
  CDP-choline; Cho, choline; GPC, glycerophosphocholine; HE, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid; Hp, hydroxyperoxy-eicosatetranoic acid; LA, lipoxin; LT, leukotrienes; PC,
  phosphatidylcholine; PG, prostaglandine; PhCho, phosphocholine; PL, phospholipase;
  SM, sphingomyelin; TX, thromboxane; ; increased relative metabolic levels; *pro-inflammatory
  effects.
