caption: 'Thiamine monophosphate (TMP) is biosynthesized de novo in the chloroplast
  by condensation of hydroxymethylpyrimidine-phosphate (HMP-P) and hydroxyethylthiazole-phosphate
  (HET-P), which are derived from 5-aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR), nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide (NAD+) and glycine as precursors, followed by dephosphorylation and
  pyrophosphorylation to thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in the cytosol. The pathway involves
  the enzyme action of THIC, THI1, TH1, TPK and TH2, although the latter enzyme appears
  to be predominantly in the mitochondrion. TDP is needed for central metabolic pathways
  in organelles: the TCA cycle and the Calvin cycle, as well as glycolysis in the
  cytoplasm (not shown). While TPCs (TPC1 and TPC2) import TDP at the mitochondrial
  membrane, it is not known how TDP is transported into the chloroplast or nonphotosynthetic
  plastids, although the promiscuous transporter NCS1 is thought to import HMP or
  TDP (represented by the gray arrow and by “?”). In the nucleus, expression of the
  THIC gene is regulated by the circadian clock through a CCA1 binding site in its
  promoter and by the level of free TDP through a riboswitch present in the 3′-UTR.
  The biosynthesis de novo pathway of TDP is active in green tissue about 5 days after
  germination (indicated by a green triangle), whereas TDP is supplied through the
  action of TPK on thiamine in germinating seeds (indicated by a brown triangle).
  The blue arrow represents negative feedback regulation of HMP-P production caused
  by the binding of TDP to the THIC riboswitch in the nucleus. The red arrows represent
  the necessity to transport TDP into the organelles.'
