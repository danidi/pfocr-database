caption: 'Depiction of the organization and regulation of the major steroid biosynthetic
  pathways in the small antral follicle of the ovary according to the 2-gonadotropin,
  2-cell model of ovarian steroidogenesis. LH stimulates androgen formation within
  theca cells via the steroidogenic pathway common to the gonads and adrenal glands.
  FSH regulates estradiol biosynthesis from androgen by granulosa cells. Long-loop
  negative feedback of estradiol on gonadotropin secretion does not readily suppress
  LH at physiologic levels of estradiol and stimulates LH under certain circumstances.
  Androgen formation in response to LH appears to be modulated by intraovarian feedback
  at the levels of 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, both of which are activities of
  cytochrome P450c17 that is expressed only in theca cells. The relative quantity
  of androstenedione formation via 17OHP (dotted arrow) in the intact follicle is
  probably small, as is the amount of progesterone formed from granulosa cell P450scc
  activity in response to FSH (data not shown). 17βHSD2 activity is minor in the ovary,
  and estradiol is primarily formed from androstenedione. Androgens and estradiol
  inhibit (minus signs) and inhibin, insulin, and IGF-1 (IGF) stimulate (plus signs)
  17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. Pertinent enzyme activities are italicized:
