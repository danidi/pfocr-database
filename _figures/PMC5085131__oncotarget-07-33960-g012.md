caption: cAMP is produced by various pools of soluble and membrane-bound adenylyl
  cyclases (sAC and AC). Blocking cAMP efflux with ICE (1) triggers several signaling
  endpoints that are related to the modulation of pro-apoptotic and cell survival
  pathways. Here, we detected phosphorylation of CREB/ATF-1 (2), mitochondrial depolarization
  (3), effector caspases 3 and 7 activation (4), and apoptosis (5) in the form of
  annexin-V binding and cell membrane damage. Blocking adenylyl cyclase activity using
  selective inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase (KH7) was sufficient to reduce effects
  of most potent compounds. Various molecular mechanisms are implicated in effects
  of cAMP on apoptosis induction. In AML cells pro-apoptotic protein Bim/BCL2L11 expression
  is up-regulated via CRE/CREB in a cAMP-dependent manner []. Induction of Bim represents
  a crucial event in the cAMP-induced apoptosis in murine T-cell lymphoma and human
  acute leukemia []. cAMP is also shown to inhibit MCL-1 protein transcription in
  human MM cells [] or human B-precursor cells []. Relocalization of the cytosolic
  sAC pool toward mitochondria leads to PKA activation and phosphorylation of the
  pro-apoptotic protein Bax that activates mitochondrial apoptotic pathway []. Also,
  cAMP is implicated in a regulation of NF-κB action [], which is a potential target
  in AML [].
