caption: APG treatment induces c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and subsequent c-Jun
  and p53 activation in NSCLC cells. The activation of p53 thus contributes to the
  upregulation of DR4 and DR5 levels. When NSCLC cells are treated with the combination
  of APG and TRAIL, TRAIL stimulates overexpressed DR4 and DR5, inducing the activation
  of caspase-8, which degrades Bid to t-Bid. Additionally, p53 accumulation accounts
  for the decrease in Bcl-2 level and also upregulates Bax level, contributing to
  Bax oligomerization. Furthermore, APG and TRAIL combined treatment inhibits AKT
  phosphorylation via the PI3K inhibition, which contributes to IκBα phosphorylation
  inhibition and degradation, suppresses the nuclear translocation of p65, and, in
  turn, decreases the expression of NF-κB target genes, such as c-FLIP, Bcl-2 and
  Bcl-xl. Thus, the increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio induces the depolarization of
  the mitochondrial membrane with the release of cytochrome c and the consequent activation
  of caspase-9 and caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Moreover, the
  combination of APG and TRAIL also suppresses the activation of ERK pathway. All
  of the above finally sensitize NSCLC cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
