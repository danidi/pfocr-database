caption: Nocardicin biosynthetic pathway. a Nocardicin biosynthesis is initiated through
  the activities of five modules spanning two proteins, NocA and NocB. The final steps
  in the release of the pro-nocardicin G pentapeptide are carried out by the bifunctional
  thioesterase domain (NocTE), which catalyzes both epimerization of the C-terminal
  Hpg residue and hydrolysis. b Whereas diphenylphosphonate analogs did not react
  with the catalytic nucleophile of the thioesterase domain, a fluorophosphonate tripeptide
  analog 4 inactivated the enzyme and was used in structural studies to characterize
  the active site
