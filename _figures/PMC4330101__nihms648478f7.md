caption: This sketch graph shows potential mechanisms of ketamine-induced changes
  of the neurogenesis of NSPCs, based on current studies. Ketamine inhibits PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway leading to the reduction of phosphorylated Akt proteins by unknown
  pathways. Reduction of phosphorylated Akt releases the inhibition on p27, a cell
  cycle inhibitor. Up-regulated p27 can inhibit its downstream factor, cdk2. Inhibited
  cdk2 can arrest cell cycle and inhibit the proliferation and promotes the differentiation
  of NSPCs. Dash arrows in the graph represents the effects of ketamine on NSPCs.
