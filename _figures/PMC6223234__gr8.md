caption: Maladaptive ER stress response in SELENON KO. The ER stress response is an
  ancient multi-dimensional signaling pathway initiated by ER stress and activated
  during muscle activity. Usually the ER stress response helps relieve cells from
  this stress so it serves as an important pro-survival pathway. However, high levels
  of ER stress persist if a “maladaptive ER stress response” fails to re-establish
  ER homeostasis and consequently cells are committed to dysfunction. Here we show
  that SELENON is part of an ER stress-dependent antioxidant response which, if it
  is missing, makes the CHOP/ERO1 branch of the ER stress response maladaptive quite
  likely by oxidizing and inhibiting SERCA2 in the highly active muscles.
