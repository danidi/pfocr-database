caption: 'Overview of cell signalling mediated by the tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs)
  Her2/Neu and estrogen receptors (ERs), two key components of breast cancer development.
  Their activation initiates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways, finally promoting
  cell growth, proliferation, survival, and other hallmarks of cancer. Although this
  is a review of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling, it is important to understand that the
  different pathways are connected by different points. In this figure, we have presented
  two examples: Ras, promoting PI3K activation, and how some AGC kinases (such as
  SGK-3) activated by mTORC2 also interact with the MAPK pathway. Additionally, GSK-3
  plays an important role as well in the regulation of these pathways, represented
  in the figure. GSK-3 is an example of how complex those interactions are, by the
  inhibition and activation of different molecules implicated in PI3K and MAPK pathways.'
