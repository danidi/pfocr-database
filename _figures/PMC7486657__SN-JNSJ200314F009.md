caption: Proposed role of the classical system A transporters in the serine shuttle.
  The synaptic turnover of D-serine depends on the serine shuttle. The SR substrate
  L-serine is synthesized from glucose through the Phgdh pathway in astrocytes (;
  ). L-Serine is subsequently exported from astrocytes by the Slc1a4 transporter and
  is required for the D-serine synthesis by the neuronal SR (). Release of the neuronal
  D-serine by Slc7a10 or other pathways activate synaptic NMDARs (, ; ). The system
  A transporters (Slc38a1 and Slc38a2) mediate D-serine reuptake along with the transport
  of glutamine (via the glutamine–glutamate cycle) into different types of neurons.
  L-Serine is also a substrate of system A. This working model predicts that higher
  export of glutamine from astrocytes through system N transporters will affect D-serine
  reuptake mechanisms and NMDAR activation. Templates for the figure were adapted
  from Servier Medical Art (https://smart.servier.com).
