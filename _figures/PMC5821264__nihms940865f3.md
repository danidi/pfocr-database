caption: 1. DJ-1 increases phosphorylated Akt, and activates the PI3k/Akt pathway,
  which contributes to oncogenesis and neuronal survival (; ; ; )2. Under hypoxic
  conditions, DJ-1 mediates the activation of HIF1 that regulates the expression of
  many genes needed for cells to adapt to hypoxic conditions. DJ-1 does this by increasing
  mTORC activity through PI3k/Akt pathway modulation, decreasing p53 activation, and
  increasing AMPK activation of mTORC (), as well as by inhibiting HIF-VHL interaction
  through direct binding with VHL ()3. There may be significant cross talk and feedback
  regulation between p53, DJ-1, and the Akt pathway. p53 may inhibit DJ-1 activation
  through phosphorylation () and may also decrease DJ-1 protein levels through a posttranscriptional
  route (). p53 negatively regulates the IGF-1/PI3k/Akt pathway by increasing the
  transcription of target genes such as IGF-BP3 or PTEN (), and is also conversely
  regulated by Akt, which activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, a trigger for p53
  degradation (). Oxidative stress may induce DJ-1-mediated phosphorylation/activation
  of p53 (), a process that may be mediated by active Akt (). Active p53 may then
  respond appropriately to stress by activating transcriptional programs (). In a
  negative feedback loop, p53 can also decrease DJ-1 levels and attenuate Akt activation,
  preventing abnormal cellular transformation ()4. PD pathogenic mutants (L166P, D146A)
  of DJ-1 lose the ability to inhibit GSK-3β through the regulation of the Akt pathway
  and may contribute to increased tau phosphorylation and PD pathogenesis ()5. By
  activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, DJ-1 may increase the activity of downstream transcription
  factor c-myc to modulate the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
  (hTERT), which is implicated in cellular differentiation and neoplastic transformation
  ()6. DJ-1 may play a role in modulating recruitment of Akt to the membrane in an
  ROS-dependent manner ()7. DJ-1 binds mRNAs of PI3K/Akt pathway (Akt1, IGF2) and
  may release them to be translated under oxidative stress ()8. DJ-1 may decrease
  ceramide-induced autophagy and cell death through its effects on the PI3k/ AKT pathway
  ()9. DJ-1 may bind PTEN directly in a manner dependent on the redox status of its
  Cys-106 residue (). And under nitrosative stress, DJ-1 may directly bind and inhibit
  PTEN activity via transnitrosylation[positive regulation is indicated by pointed
  arrows, and negative regulation is indicated by blunted arrows. Direct or known
  regulation is indicated by solid lines; indirect or unknown regulation is indicated
  by dotted lines]
