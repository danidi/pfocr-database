caption: Cno is a novel regulator of the Slit-Robo signaling pathway. Slit-Robo signaling
  pathway during CNS midline axon pathfinding. Cno acts in a complex with Robo, contributing
  to Robo subcellular distribution at growth cones, and also functionally interacts
  with downstream effectors of Robo, such as Abl, Ena, Sos, and Rac GTPases, which
  in turn directly contribute to actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. Continuous lines
  indicate physical interactions; arrows indicate genetic, functional interactions;
  dotted lines between proteins indicate the presence of the proteins in a complex.
  Question marks denote potential physical interactions. LamG, laminin G; TM, transmembrane;
  FN3, fibronectin type 3; CT, C-terminal.
