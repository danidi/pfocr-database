caption: ERα signaling, in response to estradiol, estriol and the ERα selective agonist
  PPT, acts in GM-CSF-stimulated myeloid progenitors to increase transcription of
  IRF4 and promote DC differentiation. DC that differentiated in the presence of these
  ER ligands showed an increased response to activating stimuli in that they displayed
  higher levels of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, activated T cells and
  produced greater amounts of inflammatory cytokines. The presence of the ER antagonist
  ICI 182,780 or the SERM tamoxifen and raloxifene inhibited DC differentiation and
  led to a DC population that was hyporesponsive to activating stimuli.
