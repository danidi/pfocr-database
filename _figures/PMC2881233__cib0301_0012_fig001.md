caption: The proposed role for two-pore channels in integrative Ca2+signaling. Flow
  chart shows pathways for NAADP, cADPR and IP3 production and their effects on intracellular
  Ca2+. The drawings at the bottom depict elementary Ca2+ signals generated by TPCs
  (left, lighter color and higher position for higher Ca2+ concentrations) and global
  Ca2+ signals generated by activating IP3Rs and/or RyRs (right). Red dashed lines
  indicate alternative pathways. The green pathway on the left shows an alternative
  consequence of TPC-mediated Ca2+ release. ARC, ADP-ribose cyclase, including CD38,
  PLC, phospholipase C, Ψ, membrane potential. ICa, Ca2+ current through plasma membrane.
