caption: Metabolites of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and protein O-Glycosylation
  (O-GlcNAc) modification. HBP branches off from glycolysis at fructose-6P. Thus,
  the amount of the end-product of HBP; UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) depends
  on the rate of glucose entering the cells, but also on the rate of glycolysis that
  process the majority of fructose-6P. Increased glucose uptake or a block in glycolysis
  (e.g. inhibition of GAPDH by ROS) will increase the flux through HBP. It has to
  be noted that lipid (acetylation), protein (transfer of the amino group from glutamine)
  and nucleotide (linkage of N-acetyl-glucosamine to UDP) homeostasis may also influence
  HBP apart from carbohydrate metabolism []. UDP-GlcNAc is a substrate for many complex
  biomolecules and post-translational modifications. In particular, protein O-GlcNAc.
  As O-GlcNAc is recognized to modify and influence hundreds if not thousands of proteins,
  piling evidence suggests that it may be a direct mediator and feed-back mechanism
  between metabolic challenges and cellular adaptation and regulatory functions, including
  cell proliferation.
