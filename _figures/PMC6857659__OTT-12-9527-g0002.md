caption: The synergistic effect of TGF-β pathway and immune checkpoint in inducing
  immune tolerance. Dysregulated TGF-β signaling pathway impaired multiple processes
  in anti-cancer immune response including antigen presentation, T cell infiltration,
  and tumor-killing activity. Hyperactive TGF-β signaling together with increased
  PD-1/PD-L1 signal axis undermine anti-cancer immune response.
