caption: Zoomed regions of the full TPS pathway model visualized with Cytoscape ().(A)
  The EGFR subnetwork (EGFR, GRB2, CBL, and all their direct neighbors) depicts the
  proteins that first react to EGF stimulation. A substantial portion (18 of 38 proteins)
  is known to be associated with EGFR signaling. Green and red edges depict activation
  and inhibition, respectively. Gray edges that terminate in a circle indicate that
  the interaction is used in the same direction in all possible pathway models, but
  the sign is ambiguous. Thin, undirected edges are used in different directions in
  different valid pathway models. Thick, rounded borders show which proteins are present
  in one or more reference EGFR pathways. Node annotations are detailed in (B).(B)
  Line graphs on each protein node show the temporal peptide phosphorylation changes
  relative to the pre-stimulation level on a log2 scale. Multiple lines indicate multiple
  observed phosphopeptides for that protein, where black lines denote statistically
  significant phosphorylation changes and gray lines indicate insignificant changes.
  Proteins without line graphs are connective Steiner nodes inferred by PCSF. Colored
  boxes summarize the TPS inferred activity state across peptides at each time point.
  Red indicates activation, blue inhibition, gray ambiguity, and white inactivity.(C)
  The subnetwork surrounding MAPK1 and MAPK3. TPS correctly determines that MAP2K1
  is the kinase that controls both MAPK1 and MAPK3, even though it is not observed
  in the mass spectrometry data.See also , , and  and .
