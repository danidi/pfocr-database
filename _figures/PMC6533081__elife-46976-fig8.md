caption: Diet-induced systemic ID results in heme deficiency, which activates HRI
  to phosphorylate its substrate eIF2α. The primary function of eIF2αP is to inhibit
  general protein synthesis in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria via decreased translation
  of ribosomal protein mRNAs from both cellular compartments. In the absence of HRI,
  continued protein synthesis results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in
  both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, leading to proteotoxicity and mitochonfrial
  dysfunction. Second, eIF2αP also enhances the translation of Atf4 mRNA via regulation
  by uORFs. Atf4 mRNA is the mRNA that shows the greatest differences in translation
  levels between Wt and Hri–/– EBs. The ATF4 protein induces the expression of three
  genetic pathways to activate mitochondrial UPR (UPRmt), reprogram mitochondrial
  metabolism and reduce oxidative stress, all of which enables adaptation to ID and
  erythroid differentiation. Strikingly, the expression of ATF4 target genes is most
  highly activated in ID and requires HRI. Thus, assessment of the global genome-wide
  gene expression of primary EBs in vivo reveals that HRI-ISR contributes most significantly
  to adaptation to ID. We have shown previously that HRI-ISR suppressed mTORC1 signaling,
  which is activated by elevated Epo levels in ID (). Here, we provide evidence that
  GRB10 that is induced by ATF4 may be one of the molecules involved in the repression
  of mTORC1 signaling.
