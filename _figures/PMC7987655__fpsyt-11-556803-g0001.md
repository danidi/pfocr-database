caption: 'Model NTSC pathway to GTS ()—implicates the full complement of known neurexins
  (NRXNs) and their trans-synaptic cell-adhesion ligand gene families through multiple
  means of enquiry: neuroligins (NLGNs); leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins
  (LRRTMs); cerebellin precursors (CBLNs), Glutamate ionotropic receptor delta type
  subunit (GRIDS) and the synapse associated proteins (SAPs/DLGs) (, , ) in addition
  to the ProSAP proteins that interact in the NTSC postsynaptic signaling pathway
  (, , –). Presynaptic NRXNs 1-3 form competitive trans-synaptic complexes with postsynaptic
  ligands NLGNs, LRRTMs and CBLN-GRID complexes in the formation and/or maintenance
  of neuronal circuitry within the brain. Vertical arrows indicate putative pathogenic
  dose effects. NRXN1 isoforms with (+) and without (–) the 30 amino-acid insert at
  splice site 4 (IS4) indicate competitive binding of NRXN1 between its ligands. NRXN4/CNTNAP2
  binds across the synapse with SAP97/DLG1 (, ). Comorbidities listed are those associated
  with the gene mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) in ASD and GTS (, , ,
  –). Zinc represents one environmental factor important for mitochondrial protein
  import/processing and function that is also known to affect SHANK3 function (, ).
  Moreover the Zinc transporter ZnT7 has been recurrently linked with GTS in GWAS
  ().'
