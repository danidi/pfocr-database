caption: Major metabolic pathways altered by virus infection are highlighted, glycolysis
  (Green), Fatty Acid Synthesis, FAS (Orange), Glutaminolysis (Purple), Pentose Phosphate
  Pathway, PPP (Dark Blue). Glucose enters the cell and is metabolized to glucose-6-phosphate
  (G-6-P) which can be shunted to the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) to support nucleotide
  synthesis, or to pyruvate. Pyruvate can be converted to lactate via glycolysis,
  which is secreted from the cell, or Acetyl-CoA (ACoA), which enters the TCA cycle.
  Citrate can be shunted out of the mitochondria to enter FAS. Glutamine enters the
  cell and is deaminated twice to form aKG and ammonia (NH3). αKG can then enter the
  TCA cycle. Major enzymes of carbon metabolism are in turquoise and discussed in
  main text.
