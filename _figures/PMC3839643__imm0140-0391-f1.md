caption: A mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) -centric view of nutrient sensing
  for the induction of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). The mTOR pathway in T cells integrates
  antigen receptor signalling through the T-cell receptor and co-stimulatory molecules
  such as CD28 and programmed death 1 (PD-1) with a range of nutrient-sensing and
  growth factor signals. The main nutrient sources that are sensed via mTOR are the
  essential amino acids, glucose and adenosine, while relevant growth factors include
  insulin and the interleukin-2 family of cytokines. The shingomyelin phosphate receptor
  (S1PR), which controls lymphocyte exit from the lymph nodes, also acts via this
  pathway. The availability of amino acids is detected via a unique pathway that involves
  the ragulator complex and the four Ras-like GTPases (RAGs A–D), activation of which
  are required before mTOR can form the TORC1 complex and respond to any of the other
  signals. When the T-cell receptor is stimulated and there are both sufficient nutrients
  and growth factors available, mTOR is activated, which in turn inhibits FOXP3 expression,
  so that the differentiation of effector T cells is promoted. When nutrient or growth
  factor availability is restricted, the resulting mTOR inhibition allows FOXP3 induction
  and the development of FOXP3+regulatory T cells. Although the exact mechanism linking
  mTOR inhibition to FOXP3 expression is not well defined, a number of different pathways
  have been implicated, as shown. These include direct effects on FOXP3 transcription
  dependent on hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a),
  the regulation of FOXP3 mRNA translation by phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein
  S6 (pS6), and indirect effects on the regulation of FOXP3 expression in response
  to cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)and interleukin-6 (IL-6)
  signalling through SMAD3 or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),
  respectively. Positive signalling is indicated by black arrows, while inhibitory
  signals are indicated by blocked red lines. Broken lines indicate where the details
  of signalling are still poorly defined or unclear. Approved drugs that are available
  to manipulate this system in vivo are shown in green.
