caption: Wnt5b integrates with Fak1a to mediate cell movements during gastrulation.
  Gastrulation cell migration is controlled by the Wnt5b pathway to activate calcium
  and Dsh/Daam1. Herein, we identified that Wnt5b can also integrate with FAK signalling,
  and both Wnt5b and Fak1a then activate small GTPase Rac1 and Cdc42 to mediate actin
  dynamics during gastrulation. Convergent is mainly mediated by Fak1a-mediated cell
  migration and extension is exerted by cell intercalation, which requires both Fak1a
  and Wnt5b.
