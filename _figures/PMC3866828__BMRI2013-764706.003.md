caption: 'HVJ-E-mediated apoptosis pathway in cancer cells. HVJ-E-mediated signal
  transduction in cancer cells. 1: RNA fragments derived from the HVJ genome are introduced
  into the cytoplasm by membrane fusion, and RIG-I recognizes these RNAs. 2: RIG-I
  conveys the signal to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor (MAVS). 3: MAVS
  activates IRF-7 and -3. 4: activated IRF-7 and -3 localize to the nucleus. 5, 9:
  IRF-7 and -3 induce the expression of TRAIL and Noxa. 6: expressed TRAILs are recognized
  by the TRAIL receptor, and TRAIL receptors activate caspase-8 (Casp-8). 7: activated
  Casp-8 activates Casp-3. 8: activated Casp-3 induces apoptosis. 10, 11: Noxa induces
  the secretion of cytochrome-C (Cyt-C) into the cytoplasm from the mitochondria.
  12: Cyt-C activates Casp-9. 13: Casp-9 activates Casp-3.'
