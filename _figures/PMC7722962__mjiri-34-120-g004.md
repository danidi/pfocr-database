caption: The main receptor of the Coronavirus is ACE2, which is the main factor of
  the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders (,
  ). The normal pathway has been shown in . As it is presented, ACE accelerates producing
  ANG II from ANG I. Then, ANG II effects are mediated by its receptor angiotensin
  receptor 1 (AT1R), which leads to activating vasoconstriction and cell proliferation.
  On the other hand, ACE2 (expressed in vascular endothelial cells of heart, kidneys,
  testis, and lung) () converts AG II to ANG 1-7 to mediate AT2R receptors for activating
  vasodilation and apoptosis, which can prevent the proliferation of fibroblasts in
  the lung (). One of the important pathways which influences related lung disorders,
  such as cardiovascular disorders, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary
  fibrosis, are the diseases related to RAS dysfunction (). Pulmonary fibrosis is
  reported as a considerable problem that occurs due to SARS-CoV-2, which is seen
  in the chest CT scan and is produced through the fibroblasts activated by ANG2 immune-reactivation
  of lung fibroblasts, macrophages and bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium (). These
  reactions are seen in the chest CT scan as multiple patchy consolidations and ground-glass
  opacities (GGO) (). All these pathologies are because of the involvement of RAS
  in SARS pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 is downregulated when it binds to its receptor
  (ACE2). The downregulation of ACE2 expression leads to ARDS through decreasing AT2R
  and preventing vasodilatation and fibroblast apoptosis ().  is representative of
  this cascade. Kuba et al believe that ACE2 can be applied as a novel drug for controlling
  ARDS (). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, there is a tentative suggestion that should
  be considered to treat ARDS in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Since the pathway of AT1R
  is amplified by SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan,
  telmisartan or valsartan, can reduce the intensity of invasion and mortality of
  SARS-CoV-2 infection (). Therefore, increasing ACE2 activity and redirecting the
  RAS pathway in the direction of the ATII R stimulation might be an effective potential
  therapy for ARDS related to SARS-CoV-2 (). Activation of angiotensin II receptors
  (AT2R) can be a mechanism that leads to vasodilation, apoptosis, and inhibition
  of fibroblast cell proliferation in the lung. Therefore, redirection of the RAS
  system to activate AT2R requires the use of the C21 molecule as the selective and
  specific agonist of ATII R.
