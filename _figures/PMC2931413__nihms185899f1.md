caption: Hermaphroditism in Caenorhabditis nematodes.(A) The Caenorhabditis hermaphrodite
  gonad. One of the two symmetrical gonad arms of an XX animal is depicted, based
  on a tracing of a C. briggsae young adult. Germline stem cells are concentrated
  at the distal tip, where they proliferate under the influence of the distal tip
  cell (DTC). As cells enter meiosis, they flow away from the DTC and down the bent
  tube of the gonad. The first to be born differentiate as XX spermatocytes (larger
  blue cells) and then sperm (smaller blue cells), but before spermatogenesis is complete
  large oocytes become apparent distal to them (pink). No intersexual cells are seen,
  and after the switch to oogenesis all remaining germ cells are oogonia or oocytes.
  (B) Genetic models for two convergently evolved hermaphrodites. The core sex determination
  pathway is conserved in C. elegans and C. briggsae, as are two germline genes, fog-1
  and fog-3, that act downstream of the terminal transcription factor encoded by tra-1.
  The orange trapezoid depicts the point of action of the germline factors that regulate
  XX spermatogenesis (i.e. a hypothetical sexual oscillator). FOG-2 acts with GLD-1
  to repress tra-2 activity, probably through translational inhibition. The gene she-1
  also acts genetically as a repressor of Cb-tra-2, although its mode of action is
  unknown. It is depicted as distinct from the putative C. briggsae oscillator (blue
  trapezoid) both because at low temperatures she-1 mutants are self-fertile and because
  other experiments suggest the C. briggsae oscillator probably acts on aspects of
  the pathway that lie downstream of the Cb-fem genes [,].
