caption: Figure 5.The biosynthetic pathway from campesterol to brassinolide showing
  known mutants in Arabidopsis that block the conversion of intermediates at the steps
  indicated, or prevent BR perception and/or signal transduction. The pathway on the
  left is termed Early C-6 Oxidation and that on the right, Late C-6 Oxidation. BR-6-Oxidase
  has been shown to convert 6-Deoxocastasterone and 6-Deoxotyphasterol to the corresponding
  6-oxo compounds in Arabidopsis, while the conversion of 3-Dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone
  and 6-Deoxoteasterone has been demonstrated so far in recombinant yeast cells only.
