caption: Phenotypic pathway of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).Hepatocyte damage causes
  an inflammatory reaction which leads to activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).
  Continuous liver injury causes perpetuation of activated HSCs in the liver, and
  they become myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts proliferate in response to various kinds
  of cytokines and produce extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs). Myofibroblasts undergo
  apoptosis or inactivation when the underlying causative etiologies are cleared.
