caption: 'Proposed mechanism of LPS-induced inhibition of moderate acute intermittent
  hypoxia-induced phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF). Moderate acute intermittent
  hypoxia (mAIH) induces serotonin (5-HT) release from serotonergic projections near
  spinal phrenic motor neurons. Serotonin activates phrenic 5-HT type 2 receptors,
  initiating a signaling cascade that phosphorylates ERK 1/2 MAPK and induces downstream
  BDNF protein synthesis. Newly synthesized BDNF signals through its high affinity
  receptor, TrKB, leading to increased excitatory respiratory drive onto phrenic motor
  neurons. Physiologically, enhanced excitatory drive is manifested as a long-lasting
  enhancement of phrenic motor output (i.e., pLTF). In our proposed model, systemic
  LPS leads to activation of inflammatory mechanisms within the central nervous system,
  phosphorylating (activating) p38 MAPK within phrenic motor neurons. Phospho-p38
  MAPK activates okadaic acid-sensitive serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP1/2A)
  that may act on 5-HT2 signaling at multiple sites. We propose that PP1/2A negatively
  regulates 5-HT2 signaling at the MEK and/or ERK 1/2 activation loop. Inhibition
  of PP1/2A activity with okadaic acid in LPS-treated rats permits 5-HT2-mediated
  MEK-ERK1/2 signaling, restoring mAIH-induced pLTF. Broken lines: undefined inhibitory
  feedback site at or below MEK level. Broken arrows: hypothesized pathway with unknown
  precise mechanism in the proposed model. Phosphorylation of the target molecule
  is marked by the letter P'
