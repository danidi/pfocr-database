caption: Irradiation induces TGF-β expression. Ligand binding to TGF-β activates type
  II TGF-β receptor serine/threonine kinases. TGF-β stimulation results in the induction
  of Smad proteins, which are transcription factors that also induce other transcription
  factors, including Slug, Snail, Scatter, lymphoid enhancing factor-1, and β-catenin.
  FoxM1 binds to and increases the promoter activity of the Snail1 gene. NRF2 binding
  to a Smad Binding Element (SBE) suppresses TGF-β target gene expression. TGF-β1
  also activates non-Smad-mediated signaling pathways, which are associated with occludin
  at tight junctions, to phosphorylate Par6. Phosphorylated Par6 recruits Smurf1,
  resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA, which is responsible for
  stress fiber formation and the maintenance of apical-basal polarity and junctional
  stability. Radiation activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway by increasing ROS generation.
  Activated ERK1/2 phosphorylates GSK3β, resulting in its inactivation and leading
  to the disassociation of GSK3β and Snail. Unbound Snail then migrates to the nucleus
  and represses E-cadherin, leading to a mesenchymal-like phenotypic change.
