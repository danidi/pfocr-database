caption: The complement cascade, shown here adapted from the IPA library, is the most
  significant pathway overrepresented by genes with age-dependent changes in expression
  in rTg4510 hippocampus. All gene expression changes in this pathway were increases
  in expression. The degree of shading in red corresponds to the amount of upregulation
  in rTg4510 hippocampus compared to tTA at 6.1 months of age, with the numbers indicating
  the fold-change.
