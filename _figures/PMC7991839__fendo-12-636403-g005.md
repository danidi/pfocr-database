caption: 'Mechanism of action of ghrelin in pituitary somatotrophs. After binding
  to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) and activating it, the signaling pathways
  involve stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) activity. This activation leads to
  the formation of inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (blue
  arrows). Both IP3 and DAG induce an increase in cytosolic calcium that allows GH
  release (yellow arrow), although activation of NOS/NO pathway is also required.
  In addition, the effect of ghrelin includes the activation of the transcription
  of the Na+ channel gene that leads to the expression of two isoforms of Na+: NAV1.1
  and NAV1.2.'
