caption: 'A Working Model of the PIF3-EIN3 Module Integrated Regulation of Chloroplast
  Development in Soil (Darkness) and out of Soil (Light).Left: Proposed model of the
  signaling pathway in which the EIN3-PIF3 module inhibits the transcription of LHC
  genes for PLB maintenance. The germinating seedlings under soil confront the darkness
  and mechanical pressure simultaneously. In the dark, phyB is in the inactive form
  in the cytoplasm. Darkness-stabilized PIF3 and mechanical pressure-elevated EIN3
  proteins accumulate in the nucleus. EIN3 and PIF3 directly interact with each other
  and interdependently bind the promoters of LHC genes, strongly repressing LHC gene
  expression. Right: Proposed model of the rapid establishment of chloroplast maturation
  when etiolated seedlings emerge from soil. The removal of mechanical stress largely
  decreases ethylene production and EIN3 accumulation, while light-activated phyB
  promotes both EIN3 and PIF3 protein degradations. Thus, the repression by EIN3-PIF3
  on the LHC genes is rapidly relieved to timely initiate the PLB-to-thylakoid membrane
  differentiation, achieving chloroplast maturation for photosynthesis.'
