caption: MST1 acts as a regulator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in Jurkat T cells.
  PI3K signaling blockade by GDC-0941 resulted in the abrogation of AKT kinase phosphorylation
  at S473 and significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of P70S6K and c-RAF kinase.
  This led to a paradoxical increase in the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 at S217/S221
  and ERK1/2 at T202/Y204 followed by the activation of MEK-ERK signaling. Active
  ERK1/2 signaling stimulated the proteolytic activation of MST1 which was insensitive
  to the experimentally determined concentration of the Z-DEVD-FMK inhibitor. At selected
  concentrations, Z-DEVD-FMK effectively blocked the activity of caspase-3, -7 and
  -9 but was insufficient to block the proteolytic activation of caspase-8, suggesting
  the potential activation of MST1 by caspase-8. On the other hand, the inhibition
  of MST1 levels by siRNA significantly reduced the proteolytic activation of caspase-3,
  -7 and -8, rendering MST1 a potential regulator of caspase-8 activity in Jurkat
  T cells. Moreover, activity of caspase-3/-7 potentiates the proteolytic activation
  of MST1, hence we presume the existence of a positive feed-back loop orchestrated
  by MST1 to amplify the apoptotic signal in Jurkat T cells. PLK1 and NEK2 were predicted
  as potential regulators of MST1 activity during PI3K signaling blockade. Cleavage
  of caspase-9 was not determined in this study.
