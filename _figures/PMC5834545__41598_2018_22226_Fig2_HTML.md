caption: Functions of phosphoinositides in the cell. Phosphoinositides are signalling
  lipids that are cell membrane identifiers. PI(4,5)P2 marks the plasma membrane,
  PI(3)P the early endosomes, PI(4)P the Golgi, PI(3,5)P2 the late endosomes, PI the
  ER; finally, PI(3,4,5)P3 is present in the basolateral part of the plasma membrane
  and absent from the apical part. Phosphoinositides are also second messengers, precursors
  to other signalling molecules and membrane protein docking sites and regulators.
