caption: Figure 2. EpCAM expression in normal and regenerating liver, mature hepatocytes,
  liver carcinomas and TICs thereof. During liver morphogenesis and regeneration upon
  injury or chronic inflammation, EpCAM expression correlates with a proliferative
  and low differentiation. Liver precursors (hepatoblasts) are characterized by EpCAMhigh
  and downregulate this EpCAM expression upon differentiation into mature hepatocytes
  (differentiationlow). This process is partly regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway,
  which also dictates EpCAM expression. For the case of malignant transformation,
  EpCAM remains highly expressed in liver TICs and show an intermediate phenotype
  in hepatocellular carcinomas (differentiationintermediate).
