caption: In diseased states, excessive fatty acids (FAs) activate signaling in surrounding
  cells to further increase lipolysis in adipocytes, forming a vicious, positive feedback
  loop. In obesity, adipocytes lose their ability to safely buffer FAs as TAGs, leading
  to the spillover of FAs which act upon macrophages through JNK signaling to release
  inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6. Both cytokines function on adipocytes to further
  increase lipolysis. TNFα decreases PLIN1 and G0S2, inhibitors of PNPLA2, and IL-6
  acts through JAK/STAT pathway to increase lipolysis. Under normal physiology, insulin
  functions to suppress lipolysis, however, in type 2 diabetes (T2D), the failure
  of insulin to suppress FA release from adipocytes (dashed line) results in excessive
  FA flux to the liver. FAs in the liver can form DAG and ceramides which act on PKC
  to decrease insulin sensitivity. Hepatic acetyl-CoA, generated from adipocyte FAs,
  allosterically upregulates pyruvate carboxylase (PC) to increase gluconeogenesis
  in the liver. Lastly, cancer cells secrete EVs and cytokine IL-1β increasing lipolysis
  of adipocytes in the tumor environment. Tumor-derived parathyroid-hormone-related
  protein (PTHrP) can promote the upregulation of lipolytic enzymes to promote cancer
  associated cachexia. Cancer cells use FAs generated from lipolysis as fuel to increase
  growth and invasiveness.
