caption: 'TLR4 signaling in obesity. TLR4 activation (i.e., after LPS stimulus) leads
  to signal transduction, which involves IKK-β–NF-κB classical pathway. After stimulation,
  MyD88 is recruited to TLR4 receptor to mediate downstream signaling, including IKK-β
  phosphorylation. Once activated, IKK-β phosphorylates IκB protein, which, in turn,
  release NF-κB complex. Besides this pathway, TLR4 signaling also results in PI3Kγ
  and JNK activation. Taken together, these signaling proteins play a fundamental
  role in inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance relationship. Note: dashed
  arrows indicate that other signaling intermediates are required.'
