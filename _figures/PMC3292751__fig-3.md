caption: Regulation of mammalian mitophagy. When mitochondria become damaged, they
  are characterized by reduced membrane potential, they release calcium and cytochrome
  C and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nonfunctional mitochondria are then
  removed by mitophagy to alleviate ROS and cytochrome C release into the cytosol
  and prevent apoptosis. There are several identified pathways to mitophagy activation.
  Nix is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that binds to LC3 to promote mitochondrial
  engulfment by autophagic membranes. Another pathway induced by mitochondrial depolarization
  occurs when full length PINK1 (FL-PINK1) is no longer proteolysed and accumulates
  on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Increased levels of membrane-associated PINK1
  recruit parkin to the mitochondria. Parkin ubiquitinates mitochondrial substrates,
  including VDAC and MFN. These ubiquitin modified substrates are recognized by the
  adaptor protein p62 and are trafficked to autophagosomes and eventually are degraded
  in lysosomes.
