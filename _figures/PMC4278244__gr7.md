caption: Model representing that Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling contributes to
  the association between pericytes and developing blood vessels via the Wnt5a-Fzd7-cdc42
  axis. The up-regulation of cdc42 on Wnt5a/Fzd7 signaling results in increased motility
  and polarity, which in turn results in healthy growth. A lack of Wnt5a/Fzd7 signaling
  results in less motility and polarity, which in turn leads to a loss or reduction
  of the interaction between endothelial cells (EC) and pericytes (Pc) and eventually
  a loss of arteries, leading to PAH.
