caption: Schematic illustration of the calcium signaling pathways that are modulated
  by the cannabinoid system. Activation CB1 receptors mobilizes the IP3pathway through
  a G protein-coupled process. Activation of IP3 receptors triggers calcium release
  from intracellular calcium stores, which in turn inhibits calcium influx mediated
  by activated NMDA receptor channels or by voltage-dependent calcium channels (data
  not shown). Depletion of intracellular calcium stores by SERCA pump inhibitor or
  blocking calcium release from intracellular calcium stores by IP3 receptor inhibitors
  prevents the cannabinoid from inhibiting the calcium influx related to the excitotoxicity
  of neurons and development of neuropathic pain. How the calcium release from intracellularly
  stores leads to the inhibition of NMDA receptors and/or voltage-dependent calcium
  channels remains to be determined.
