caption: Models of the regulation of prenylation and trafficking of PBR-containing
  small GTPases by SmgGDS splice variants. A, SmgGDS-607 may act directly or in cooperation
  with another protein (X) to stimulate GDP/GTP exchange and promote entry of nonprenylated
  GTPases into the prenylation pathway. A nonprenylated GTPase may remain bound to
  SmgGDS-607 until a signal allows it to undergo GDP/GTP exchange and be released
  to the PTase. Alternatively, a signal may stimulate binding of the nonprenylated
  GTPase to SmgGDS-607, where it is retained in the nonprenylated form until GDP/GTP
  exchange occurs. B, inability of a DN GTPase to bind GTP may inhibit its release
  from SmgGDS-607, thereby diminishing the interaction of the GTPase with the PTase.
  Overexpression of SmgGDS-607 will generate more complexes of SmgGDS-607 bound to
  nonprenylated DN GTPases, causing further retention of DN GTPases in the nonprenylated
  form. C–J, ability of SmgGDS-607 and SmgGDS-558 to selectively bind nonprenylated
  and prenylated small GTPases, respectively, suggests multiple roles for SmgGDS splice
  variants in the regulation of small GTPase prenylation and localization. Because
  prenylation is not reversible, SmgGDS-607 must intercept newly synthesized small
  GTPases before prenylation occurs. SmgGDS-607 may then store nonprenylated small
  GTPases in the cytoplasm as a reserve for rapid prenylation (C) or stimulate nonconventional
  signaling from cytosolic GTPases (D). SmgGDS-607 may also transfer nonprenylated
  small GTPases to the PTase (E). SmgGDS-558, which binds only prenylated small GTPases,
  may facilitate release of newly prenylated GTPases from the PTase (F) or transport
  GTPases to the ER (G). SmgGDS-558 may also transport fully processed GTPases from
  the ER to the PM (H) or extract these GTPases from the PM (I), potentially for transport
  to endomembranes where the small GTPases participate in different signaling pathways
  (J).
