number: Figure 1
caption: 'Arachidonic acid metabolism produces bioactive lipid signalling molecules
  known as eicosanoids: Upon cellular stimulation, phospholipase A2 induces the release
  of free fatty acids (FFAs), mostly arachidonic acid (AA), from the lipid bilayer
  of the nucleus. The released AA is metabolised by one of three different enzymatic
  pathways into the bioactive lipid signalling molecules, known as eicosanoids. 5-lipoxygenase
  (LO) metabolises AA to 5-HETE, LTB4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and
  LTE4), 12-LO metabolises AA to 12-HETE. Both isoforms of 15-LO metabolise AA to
  15-HETE and to a lesser extent 12-HETE. Cytochrome P450 metabolises AA to 19-/20-HETE
  but mostly epoxides. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and 2 metabolises AA to thromboxane
  A2 or a series of prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2, PGH2 and PGI2).'
