caption: Model of CISK-mediated inhibition of CXCR4 sorting and degradation. Upon
  CXCL12 activation, CXCR4 is internalized into clathrin-coated pits from the plasma
  membrane. Consequently, CXCR4 is ubiquitinated and transported into the endocytic
  pathway for degradation in lysosomes. As well as keeping CXCR4 ubiquitinated at
  the endosomes, AIP4 may also regulate the sorting machinery itself through ubiquitination.
  When high PI 3-kinase signalling is turned on by various growth factors during development
  or cancer progression, the degradation of CXCR4 is strongly inhibited. PI 3-kinase
  stimulation leads to the activation of PDK1 and CISK on endosomal membranes. We
  propose that CISK negatively regulates the function of endosomal AIP4 through phosphorylation
  and thereby prevents CXCR4 from being efficiently sorted to lysosomes (see text
  for further details).
