caption: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in cardiac metabolism. NAD+ is used
  in fuel metabolism within the heart. The predominant substrate for energy production
  in the cardiomyocyte is fatty acids. Through fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), NAD+
  is reduced to NADH. NADH is used and oxidized to NAD+ in oxidative phosphorylation
  to produce ATP. Within conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction and ischemia, the
  heart relies on carbohydrates and glycolysis for the generation of ATP. Glycolysis
  reduces NAD+ to NADH. Subsequently, pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate
  dehydrogenase to aid in the regeneration of the oxidized NAD+. Glucose 6-phosphate
  from the glycolytic pathway can be shunted to the pentose phosphate shuttle where
  the phosphorylated form of NAD+ (NADP+) is reduced to NADPH. Acetyl-CoA can be generated
  from pyruvate, ketone bodies, and amino acids to participate in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle. The generation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) from amino acids can
  also contribute in energy production within the TCA cycle. Metabolic reprogramming
  in failing hearts away from FAO and toward glycolytic and ketone body oxidation
  is predicted to decrease the NAD+-to-NADH ratio, having major implications in cellular
  processes. Furthermore, decreasing NAD+ content by downregulation of biosynthesis
  or upregulation of consumption may limit metabolic processes.
