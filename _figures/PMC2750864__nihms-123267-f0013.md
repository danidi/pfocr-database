caption: The mechanistic hypothesis described in  can also be used to explain the
  large difference in diastereoselectivity observed in reactions of cyclic alkenes
  as compared to acyclic internal alkenes. As shown in , intramolecular insertion
  of the cycloalkene into the Pd-O bond of palladium(aryl)(alkoxide) intermediate
  53 derived from cyclic olefin substrate 1 would afford 54. Complex 54 contains a
  single β-hydrogen atom with a syn-relationship to the metal (H6α). Although H6α
  could potentially undergo β-hydride elimination to afford 55, the Pd(Ar)(H) complex
  cannot be transferred to the opposite face of the alkene to afford 56 through a
  mechanism analogous to that described in ; there is no pathway that would lead to
  a σ-alkyl palladium complex similar to 42 that could undergo a C-C bond rotation
  as depicted above (, 42 → 42′). In principle, the alkene 57 could be displaced from
  the metal and then reassociate on the opposite alkene face to afford 56. However,
  the intermediate LnPd(Ar)(H) complex 58 would be likely to undergo unimolecular
  C-H bond-forming reductive elimination at a much faster rate than bimolecular alkene
  coordination and insertion into the Pd-H bond. Thus, the mechanism outlined above
  predicts, as observed, that cyclic alkenes should be transformed with high levels
  of diastereoselectivity. The origins of the diminished stereo- and regioselectivity
  observed in reactions of sterically hindered aryl bromides with acyclic internal
  alkenes is not entirely clear, but may arise from changes in the relative rates
  of C-C bond-forming reductive elimination vs. β-hydride elimination, or from shifts
  in the equilibria shown in .
