caption: xCT function and transcriptional regulation. The cystine/glutamate antiporter
  xCT exports intracellular glutamate and imports extracellular cystine. Exported
  glutamate is involved in tumor microenvironment shaping, promoting invasiveness
  and metastasization. The imported cystine is reduced to cysteine and used for the
  biosynthesis of GSH, which is responsible for cancer cell protection from reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) excess due to genomic instability, altered metabolism and external
  insults, such as chemotherapy. ROS induce the upregulation of xCT, which destabilizes
  the KEAP1-NRF2 complex; NRF2 translocation into the nucleus and its binding to the
  ARE sequence on the SLC7A11 gene promoter lead to xCT mRNA transcription and protein
  production. Amino acid depletion also induces xCT upregulation through ATF4, which
  binds to the Amino Acid Response Element (AARE) sequences on the SLC7A11 gene promoter.
  The mTORC2/AKT signaling axis is another relevant pathway in xCT post-translational
  modulation that, when activated, inhibits xCT through Ser26 phosphorylation. This
  figure was created with BioRender.com.
