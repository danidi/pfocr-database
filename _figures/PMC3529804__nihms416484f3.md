caption: Nicotinamide (NIC) can maintain poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) homeostasis,
  restore NAD+ and ATP levels, enhance T-cell immune function, and lead to the prevention
  of diabetic neuropathy. NIC can limit reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and
  oxidative stress during diabetes mellitus (DM) to assist with β-cell protection
  and also reduce HbA1C levels. NIC can function as a feedback mechanism to inhibit
  SIRT1 and activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to promote insulin sensitivity
  and maintain β-cell function. However, high concentrations of NIC may be detrimental
  to cell survival by limiting the activity of SIRT1 that is necessary for food intake
  regulation and cellular metabolism. Erythropoietin (EPO) can limit cognitive decline,
  promote neurite outgrowth, and increase cardiac function during DM that may function
  through the ability of EPO to modulate SIRT1 activity and foster cellular protection.
  EPO also directly or through Wnt1 increases mTOR activity to maintain β-cell survival
  and insulin sensitivity. Following Wnt1 activation, Wnt1 can promote vascular protection
  and reduce complications of DM, such as cardiac and brain ischemic injury. Wnt1
  also governs Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) that may assist
  with β-cell regeneration and proliferation.
