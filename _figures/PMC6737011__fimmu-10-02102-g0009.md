caption: Schematic representation of metabolism in WSSV-infected hemocytes showing
  the aerobic glycolysis, glutamine metabolism and lipogenesis pathways at the WSSV
  genome replication stage (12 hpi). This figure was compiled from data obtained in
  the present study and previous studies (–, ). Enzymes are shown in boxes where red
  indicates an upregulated enzyme and yellow indicates the enzyme was unchanged. Oxidative
  glutamine metabolism and reductive carboxylation are indicated by blue and red arrows,
  respectively. Green arrows represent aerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). WSSV-triggered lipogenesis, which is triggered at the late stage,
  is shown in purple. Round boxes and gray arrows indicate enzyme activity and signaling
  pathways. Pyr, pyruvate; CS, citrate synthase; FA, fatty acids. All other abbreviations
  are the same as for .
