caption: Working hypothesis of mesothelioma carcinogenesis. Asbestos causes necrotic
  HM death, leading to the release of HMGB1 into the extracellular space. HMGB1 elicits
  macrophage accumulation and triggers the inflammatory response and TNF-α secretion.
  TNF-α activates the NF-κB pathway, which increases survival of asbestos-damaged
  HM. This allows key genetic alterations to accumulate within HM that sustain asbestos-induced
  DNA damage that lead to the initiation of mesothelioma.
