caption: The MCSs at ER/PM junctions are tethered by E‐Syt1 and E‐Syt2 and Ist2/ANO,
  with E‐Syt1 affecting STIM1‐Orai1 complex localization and E‐Syt2 may control plasma
  membrane PI(4)P levels through the PI(4) phosphatase Sac‐1 to determine PI(4,5)P2
  levels of the PI(4,5)P2‐rich domain at the ER/PM junctions. The AC/PKA/cAMP signaling
  pathway is also present at the ER/PM junctions. The ER/PM junctions are dynamic
  and are likely formed or at least stabilized in response to cell stimulation, and
  the signaling proteins are recruited to the ER/PM junctions after their formation/stabilization.
  Prior to cell stimulation, STIM1 is in an inactive conformation and is not clustered
  at the ER/PM junctions. The STIM1 inhibitor SARAF is also at the ER and does not
  interact with STIM1. AC1, AC3, and AC8 may not be localized at the ER/PM junctions,
  but at a nearby domain and AC8 is not associated with Orai1. All proteins are at
  a PM PI(4,5)P2‐poor domain. In response to depletion of ER Ca2+, STIM1 clusters
  at the ER/PM junctions to expand and stabilize the junctions. STIM1 clusters first
  at a PI(4,5)P2‐poor domain and recruits Orai1 to this domain to activate Ca2+ influx.
  Subsequently, the STIM1‐Orai1 complexes translocate to the PI(4,5)P2‐rich domain
  where SARAF interacts with STIM1 to initiate the Ca2+‐dependent inhibition of Ca2+
  influx and prevent Ca2+ toxicity. Once at the PI(4,5)P2‐rich domain, STIM1 and Orai1
  interact with the Ca2+‐activated ACs to trigger generation of cAMP and activation
  of PKA. The ACs may also be recruited to the PI(4,5)P2‐rich domain after its stabilization
  by STIM1, and thus, translocation between PI(4,5)P2‐poor and PI(4,5)P2‐rich domains
  regulates both Ca2+ and cAMP signaling.
