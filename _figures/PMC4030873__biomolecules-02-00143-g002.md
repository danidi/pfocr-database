caption: 'Multiple functions and multiple localizations of mortalin. Mortalin is involved
  in mitochondrial, nuclear, plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum processes.
  The distribution of mortalin is highly dependent on cellular conditions. Mortalin
  interacts with the following proteins: 1. mitochondrial pre-proteins interact with
  mortalin and Hsp60 upon entering the mitochondrial matrix compartment; following
  these interactions, the mortalin/Hsp60 complex acts as a mitochondrial import motor.
  This coupling process allows proteins to refold, assemble, sort, and perform their
  corresponding functions; 2. mortalin interacts with VDAC1 and modulates its channel
  properties; 3. p66Shc localizes into the mitochondria and forms a complex with mortalin
  that modulates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis; 4. binding of mortalin to
  MVD1 (that inhibits p21(ras)-induced growth arrest) may represent another pathway
  to immortalization and may be a part of mechanisms of cell proliferation; 5. mortalin
  associates with the IL-1R (interleukin-1 receptor) protein leading to receptor internalization
  and downstream signaling cascades; 6. mortalin binds p53 thereby inactivating p53
  translocation to the nucleus and inhibiting its activity as an apoptosis inducer;
  and 7. mortalin promotes intracellular trafficking of FGF-1.'
