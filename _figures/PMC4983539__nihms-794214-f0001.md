caption: 'The RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I and MDA5 are activated by viral dsRNA in
  the cell cytoplasm. PP1α/ϒ dephosphorylates MDA5 at S88 to allow subsequent signaling.
  TRIM25 and RIPLET are E3 ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate RIG-I for its full
  activation. The 14-3-3ε protein mediates RIG-I translocation to the membrane to
  interact with MAVS. MAVS is the adaptor protein for both RIG-I and MDA5 and recruits
  downstream signaling molecules to mediate signaling to both IRF3/7 and NFκB. Several
  aspects of this signaling pathway are inhibited by viruses, as shown here. Abbreviations:
  Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), Dengue virus (DenV), enterovirus 68 (EV-D68), enterovirus
  71 (EV-D71), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), molluscum
  contagiosum virus (MCV), poliovirus (PV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
  virus (PRRSV), and West Nile virus (WNV).'
