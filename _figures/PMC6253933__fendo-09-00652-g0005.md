caption: The roles of SIRT7 in cancer. (A,B) SIRT7 acts as an oncogene. (A) The disruption
  of DNA methylation and p53 activates miR-125b and miR-125a-5p to inhibit the expression
  of SIRT7. Overexpression of SIRT7 upregulates the expression of CDK1/cyclin D1 while
  downregulates the level of p21 and Beclin1 as well as promotes rRNA and protein
  synthesis by interaction with rRNA transcription complex to promote cancer cell
  growth. In addition, overexpression of SIRT7 can also upregulate Bcl-2 and NF-κB
  to repress cancer cell apoptosis. (B) ETS-like transcription factor 4 (ELK4) targets
  SIRT7 to promoters of many tumor suppressor genes for H3K18 deacetylation and leads
  to cancer cell growth and metastasis eventually. SIRT7 induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  and activated the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway to promote cancer cell growth. SIRT7 also
  reduces miR-34a expression by deacetylating H3K18Ac to decrease cancer cell apoptosis
  and DNA damage. Besides, SIRT7 reduces expression of E-cadherin by interaction with
  SIRT1 to promote EMT transition. (C) SIRT7 acts as a tumor suppressor. SIRT7 inactivates
  TGF-β signaling and represses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. SIRT7 also negatively
  regulates HIF1 and HIF2 transcription. Moreover, SIRT7 deacetylates Mothers against
  decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) and promotes β-transducin repeat–containing protein
  1 (β-TrCP1)-dependent degradation to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.
