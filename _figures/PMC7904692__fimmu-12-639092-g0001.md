caption: Antiviral pathways in silkworm. (A) The siRNAi pathway is activated by viral
  dsRNA, which is cleaved into siRNAs by Dicer2. Ago2 is associated with one strand
  of siRNA to form RISC that can target and cleave the viral RNA to inhibit viral
  replication. (B) The NF-kB-mediated, Imd, and STING pathways. BmCPV induces the
  extracellular BmPGRP-S2 to active Imd and the downstream NF-kB ortholog Relish;
  BmNPV infection triggers the production of cGAMP to activate BmSTING for processing
  Relish. Activated Relish is translocated to the nucleus to initiate the transcription
  of AMP. Whether AMPs have antiviral function in silkworms needs further study. (C)
  The JAK/STAT pathway. The extracellular ligands bind to JAK associated receptors
  upon stimulation, leading to the activation of JAKs, and then cytosolic STATs are
  phosphorylated, forming the STAT dimers, which are translocated to the nucleus to
  regulate the expression of antiviral genes. (D) The PPO pathway is initiated by
  recognizing invading microbes, and then the extracellular cSP cascade is activated
  to convert the zymogen PPO to active PO. PO catalyzes the formation of melanin,
  resulting in melanization that kill the microbes. This pathway is negatively regulated
  by serpins, and baculovirus can induce serpins to suppress the melanization response
  of host insects for survival. (E) The PI3K/Akt pathway. Activated PI3K converts
  PIP2 into PIP3 to cause Akt phosphorylation (p-Akt). PTEN is a negative regulator
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway. BmNPV induces BmPGRP2-2 to suppress PTEN, resulting in
  increased p-Akt that inhibits cell apoptosis. Upregulated p-Akt also causes the
  inhibitory phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO, decreasing the expression
  of BmPEPCK-2 and resulting in reduced autophagy genes (ATGs) expression, thereby
  blocking host autophagy. The inhibited apoptosis and autophagy are beneficial for
  viral replication. The PI3K inhibitor AZD8835 can decrease the mortality of silkworms
  infected with BmNPV. (F) The ERK pathway. Upon viral infection, the extracellular
  ligands activate EGFR (a receptor tyrosine kinase) to promote ERK phosphorylation
  (p-ERK) through the activation of Ras to the Raf/MEK/ERK phosphorylation cascade.
  p-ERK can regulate the transcription of viral genes and inhibit apoptosis. The Spry
  protein is a negative regulator of EGFR/ERK pathway that inhibits Ras or Raf, and
  both DNA and RNA viruses can downregulate Spry to increase p-ERK to ensure viral
  reproduction. AG1478 is a specific inhibitor of EGFR and U0126 binds to MEK to prevent
  p-ERK. The EGER also participates in the activation of PI3K by BmNPV. These pathways
  are integrated and are responsive to one another, which are complex and merit further
  investigation.
