caption: 'New model for the activation of the Ask1-signaling pathway by H2O2. Trx1-oxidation
  model (Old model): Trx1 oxidation model. In resting cells, multimers of Ask1 are
  found associated with other factors (triangle) in a complex called the signalosome.
  In this complex, the association of Trx1 with Ask1 maintains the signalosome in
  an inactive form. Treatment with H2O2 leads to the oxidation of Trx1 and its release
  from the signalosome, allowing the binding of additional factors, including TRAF6,
  which leads to the phosphorylation/activation of Ask1. Ask1-oxidation model (Proposed
  model): Ask1 oxidation model. In addition to phosphorylation, treatment with H2O2
  induces the formation of disulfide bonds between Ask1 molecules (thick lines within
  the Ask1 molecules). Both phosphorylation and oxidation, which occur independently
  of each other, are required for competent signaling to MKK4/7, JNK, and apoptosis
  (not shown). Whereas phosphorylation is required and sufficient for Ask1 activation,
  oxidation is essential for the subsequent phosphorylation of MKK4/7 and JNK, likely
  by eliciting the recruitment of specific factors mediating MKK4/7 phosphorylation.
  In this model, Trx1 associates transiently with Ask1. It regulates negatively the
  pathway by reducing Ask1 multimers.'
