caption: 'Statins and bacterial infection: model illustrating the effects of statins
  on S. enterica serovar Typhimurium infection in vitro and in vivo. Control (top
  right) or statin-treated (bottom left) macrophages were infected with bacteria (green)
  for 13 h, stained for cholesterol (cyan) and TUNEL-positive nuclei (red), and used
  to create three-dimensional models. Nuclei (N) are indicated. Statin-dependent effects
  that may contribute to bacterial clearance are also indicated (TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor alpha; MHC II, major histocompatibility class II). In addition, proposed
  effects of statins on the vasculature are indicated (eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase; SMCs, smooth muscle cells; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; VCAM,
  vascular cell adhesion molecule).'
