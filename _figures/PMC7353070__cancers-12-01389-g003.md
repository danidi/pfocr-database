caption: Developmental stages of chimeric antigen receptors. The first double chain
  chimeric receptors were engineered to customize the variable T cell receptor (TCR)
  domain by using VH and VL chains of antibodies (orange and bright blue boxes) fused
  to the constant regions of the TCR α- and β-chains (green and blue boxes). They
  mimicked the TCR in appearance and functionality. Activation relies on association
  with intracellular CD3ζ (yellow boxes), CD3γ, CD3δ, and CD3ε chains (purple boxes).
  The first generation of CARs combined the antigen recognizing scFv directly with
  the CD3ζ-signalling domain in one construct overcoming expression difficulties by
  the tremendous construct length of double chain chimeric receptors. Cytotoxicity,
  proliferation, cytokine secretion, and persistence of CARs were increased in second
  and third generation CARs by the addition of further costimulatory domains (CS1
  and CS2) such as CD27, CD28, CD134, or 4-1BB. Introduction of T cell redirected
  for universal cytokine-mediated killing (TRUCKs) or fourth generation CARs increased
  the flexibility in CAR design for specific challenges even further, enabling local
  expression of cytokines such as IL-12, which are toxic in high concentrations. Fifth
  generation CARs, as fourth generation CARs, are based on second generation CARs.
  The individual antigen response is complemented by activation of intracellular domains
  of cytokines (dark blue box) e.g., IL-2Rβ, which induced signal transduction in
  the STAT3/5 pathway. Another group of artificial antigen receptors, gaining increased
  interest in recent years, are synNotch receptors. These receptors use the cleavage
  process after Delta-Notch binding and enable an unlimited variety of responses (green
  box) after target recognition such as cell fate determination with transcription
  factors and expression of selected cytokines or therapeutic antibodies. In this
  way, they bring the potential of immune cells as “living drugs” a big step forward.
