caption: 'The Notch signalling pathway: Activation of Notch by its ligand leads to
  the cleavage of the intracellular domain and its following translocation to the
  nucleus. Once in the nucleus, this domain will activate CSL (transcription factor).
  The CSL co-repressor complex (CoR) is replaced by the co-activator complex (CoA),
  initiating transcription of Notch target gene.'
