caption: '(a) Overview of the used initial GSMs. (b) Instances of identical metabolites
  with different MnXRef identifiers. (c) Non-identical metabolites that perform identical
  functions in the network context. (d) Alternative modeling of polymers. (e) Nested
  and encompassing reactions. (f) Alternative usage of redox pairs. (g) Alternative
  reactions with consequences for redox metabolism. (h) Partially overlapping reactions
  differing in phosphate products. (i) Lumped vs. non-lumped representation of a pathway.
  (j) Invalid transport reaction (IR08663). (k) Alternative transport reactions for
  putrescine. (l) Alternative transport reactions for glycine. (m) Invalid boundary
  reaction (R841). Circles represent chemical species, arrows chemical reactions,
  and grey boxes different compartments. Red nodes indicate instances of identical
  species within the network context whose alternative names are separated by horizontal
  lines. Rectangular boxes contain the original reaction names, rounded rectangles
  their corresponding GPRs, where ''&'' represents a logical AND, and ''|'' a logical
  OR. Edges with filled circles represent reversible reactions. Stoichiometric coefficients
  unequal to one are indicated at their respective arrows. The shown reactions originate
  from GSMs of four different organisms: B. subtilis (d), as represented in iYO844
  [] (blue) and iBSu1103 [] (orange); M. tuberculosis (m), as represented in iNJ661
  [] (blue) and GSMN_TB [] (orange);P. putida (b,c,e,f,h,I,j,k), as represented in
  iJN746 [] (blue) and iJP962 [] (orange); and S. cerevisiae (g,l), as represented
  in iIN800 [] (blue) and iMM904 [,] (orange) and iND750 [] (pink).'
