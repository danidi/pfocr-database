caption: (A) among other client proteins stabilized by HSP90 chaperone, STK33 is implicated
  in tumor growth and angiogenesis. (B) degradation of STK33 following pharmacologic
  inhibition of HSP90 negatively impacts on HIF-1α accumulation and VEGF secretion
  in hypoxic tumors. Consequently, tumor growth and tumor-driven vascularization are
  significantly suppressed. (C) ectopic STK33 partially restores HIF-1α accumulation
  and VEGF release in hypoxic cancer cells subjected to pharmacologic HSP90 inhibition.
  (D) high expression of STK33 is associated (at least in some tumor entities) with
  augmented PKD2 phosphorylation, another HSP90 client kinase involved in tumor blood
  vessel formation. Thus, HSP90 chaperone may promote vascularization of tumors by
  coordinating (at least) two client proteins aiming at a fast & robust activation
  of HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway.
