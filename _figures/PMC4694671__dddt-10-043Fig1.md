caption: 'Schematic diagram representing MEK inhibitor-sensitive reactivation of MAPK
  signaling following BRAF inhibitor resistance.Notes: Mutations and dysregulation
  of factors within the MAPK pathway that contribute to BRAF inhibitor resistance
  include: increased activity of RTKs either through higher levels of ligand stimulation
  or an RTK mutation providing constitutive activity; loss of NF1 inhibitory function;
  single point-mutations or increased levels of RAS; copy-number gain, or alternative
  splicing of BRAF, or increased CRAF; activation of MEK kinase independent of RAF
  by MLKs; and loss of ERK-dependent negative feedback. Dashed lines represent loss
  of effective inhibition. Faded NF1 represents complete loss of expression.Abbreviations:
  NF1, neurofibromin-1; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; MLK, mixed lineage kinases;
  ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.'
