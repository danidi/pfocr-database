caption: 'Conservation between the Drosophila and the mammalian JAK/STAT pathway and
  their commonalities in inducing systemic and localized immune response and tissue
  growth. Activation of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway by the Upd (Upd, Upd2 and
  Upd3) cytokines has critical roles in many developmental processes, as well as in
  immune responses. The JAK/STAT pathways in mammals can be activated by different
  ligands (e.g., IL-6 and IFNs) that induce distinct signaling cascades. IL-6 binding
  to its receptor induces innate immunity and tissue growth and maintenance, similarly
  to the activation of the Drosophila JAK/STAT signaling by the Upds. JAK/STAT activation
  by IFNs promotes antiviral activities. Rectangles of the same colors indicate the
  homology between the components of Drosophila and mammalian JAK/STAT pathway components.
  Components in italics i.e., the Eye Transformer (ET), PIAS, PIAS3, SOCS36E and SOCS3
  are negative regulators acting at the point of the pathway where they are placed.
