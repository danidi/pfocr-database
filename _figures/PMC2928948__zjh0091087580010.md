caption: 'Model of anti-GBM antibody-induced recruitment of platelets and neutrophils.
  Diagram of hypothesized mechanism by which platelets and neutrophils are recruited
  to the glomerulus in response to anti-GBM antibody. A: Following deposition of anti-GBM
  antibody, platelets adhere to the glomerular capillary in a GPVI-dependent fashion.
  This leads to activation of platelet αIIbβ3 integrin. Fibrinogen is also deposited
  in the glomerular microvasculature in a partially ICAM-1-dependent fashion. Platelet
  adhesion is then stabilized via an αIIbβ3-dependent interaction, using fibrinogen
  as one potential ligand. Platelets are further activated by an apyrase sensitive
  mechanism, presumably ADP, resulting in platelet P-selectin up-regulation. B: Neutrophils
  subsequently adhere in glomerular capillaries via interaction with platelet P-selectin,
  and additionally via β2 integrin-dependent adhesion, potentially with ICAM-1. Additional
  platelets accumulate in the glomerular microvasculature via interaction with adherent
  neutrophils.'
