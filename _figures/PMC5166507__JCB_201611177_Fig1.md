caption: Model for the cycling of ULK1 protein levels, which modulates the oscillatory
  mode of the autophagy response during prolonged starvation. Upon autophagy induction,
  ULK1 is activated and undergoes autophosphorylation, which triggers autophagosome
  formation. The activated ULK1 is then ubiquitinated by NEDD4L and targeted to the
  proteasome for degradation. ULK1 mRNA is gradually increased during starvation.
  Release of nutrients from autolysosomes after the degradation of sequestrated materials
  activates mTOR, which promotes de novo ULK1 protein synthesis. The newly synthesized
  ULK1 is inhibited by mTOR phosphorylation. Reactivation of mTOR also promotes lysosome
  regeneration from autolysosomes to maintain the lysosome pool for the next round
  of autophagy. Steps in the autophagy pathway are enclosed within the dashed oval.
