caption: Pathogenesis and treatment of organ failure by HGF. Reciprocal balance between
  HGF and TGF-β is involved in determining the prognosis of chronic organ diseases,
  such as liver cirrhosis, renal sclerosis and lung fibrosis. In the early stages
  of chronic disorders, HGF production is enhanced to suppress TGF-β1 production.
  When HGF dominates the balance, regenerative and anti-fibrotic events occur as a
  compensatory response. By contrast, TGF-β production is up-regulated during the
  advanced stages to prohibit HGF production. Under TGF-β-dominant conditions, a loss
  in regenerative power leads to a rapid progression of organ fibrosis and dysfunction.
  To reverse the pathogenic balance, HGF supplementation should be considered as a
  new strategy for the attenuation of fibrosis (and gliosis), a common pathway leading
  to end-stage organ failure in liver, kidney, lung, heart and possibly the nervous
  system as well.
