caption: A. The pro- and anti-angiogenic function of Pancreatic Stelate (PS) cells.
  Immunocytes can release cytokines and growth factors that promote neo angiogenesis
  as well as activate PS cells. Upon activation by stress, ROS, cytokines and/or growth
  factors PS cells can secrete periostin to mediate endothelial cell adhesion and
  migration as well as secrete MMPs. MMPs can both promote neo angiogenesis through
  basal membrane destruction (MMP-2, MMP-9) or inhibit neo angiogenesis by triggering
  production of endostatin (MMP-12). Pancreatic cancer cells can also promote neo
  angiogenesis by stimulating PS cells to secrete VEGF or inhibit neo angiogenesis
  by increasing endostatin secretion. B. Relationship between insulin resistance and
  pancreatic cancer development and survival. Insulin resistance can lead to increased
  insulin and glucose in the blood. When the level of IGF-1 is low in the tumor microenviroment,
  IGFRs and IRs that can be overexpressed on cancer cells are free for insulin to
  bind and stimulate cancer cell growth. Furthermore, downstream signaling of the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can sustain cellular survival through the synthesis of anti-apoptotic
  proteins. Under hypoxic conditions, insulin can mediate VEGF secretion from pancreatic
  cancer cells via expression of HIF-1α. Elevated levels of blood glucose may also
  stimulate VEGF.AKT (protein kinase B); HIF-1 α (hypoxia inducible factor-1α); IGFR
  (insulin-like growth factor receptor); IR (insulin receptor) IRS (insulin receptor
  substrate); MMP (matrix metalloprotease); mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) PI3K
  (Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases) ROS (reactive oxygen species) VEGF (vascular endothelial
  growth factor).
