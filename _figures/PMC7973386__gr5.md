caption: The polyol pathway becomes highly active during hyperglycemia, leading to
  the massive production of NADH [,]. Consumption of NAD+ by PARPs results in NAD+
  decline. During diabetes, accumulation of NADH and depletion of NAD+ leads to an
  increase in redox imbalance, which causes oxidative stress, decreased SIRT activity,
  decreased ATP production, and increased cell death.
