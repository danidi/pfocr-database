caption: a(A) Methylation occurs at C6′ of 16 by radical-mediated methyl transfer.
  (B) Methylation occurs at C6′ via SN2-type chemistry involving a ketyl radical anion
  intermediate 17/18 as the nucleophile. (C) Same as mechanism B, except the product
  radical 19 is quenched by reclaiming a hydrogen atom from 5′-dAdo (13) to regenerate
  SAM (1).
