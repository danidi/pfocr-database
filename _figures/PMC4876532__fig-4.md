caption: The Hippo pathway regulates tissue repair by cell division or endoreplication.
  The Hippo signal transduction pathway regulates the cotranscriptional activator
  Yorkie (Yki) to control tissue repair by cell division or endoreplication depending
  on the cell's differentiated state. In stem cells, Yki induces expression of the
  S phase cyclin E stimulating cells to divide. In differentiated cell types, this
  same signaling pathway appears to induce endoreplication by stimulating cells to
  grow instead of dividing. This model suggests that there are intrinsic differences
  between an undifferentiated and differentiated cell that trigger different repair
  outcomes using the same core Hippo signaling components.
