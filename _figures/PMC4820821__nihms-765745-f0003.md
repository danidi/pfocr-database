caption: 'Hedgehog pathway expression in the adrenal gland. β-Galactosidase activity
  staining of reporter mice shows that, in the adrenal gland, Gli1 and Ptch are expressed
  primarily in the capsule, whereas the predominant ligand, Shh, is found in the subcapsular
  region of the cortex. In the absence of Shh, Ptch inhibits Smo. Upon Shh binding,
  Smo is released from Ptch inhibition and activates nuclear translocation of Gli
  transcription factors. Abbreviations: Gli, Glioma-associated oncogene; Ptch, Patched;
  Shh, Sonic hedgehog; Smo, Smoothened.'
