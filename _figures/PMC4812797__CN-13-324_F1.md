caption: 'Glutamate-mediated effects on the cGMP-NO system leading to monoamine release
  that in turn can be targeted by pharmacological means, eg. PDE5 and NOS inhibitors,
  as well as known antidepressants. However this pathway can also lead to oxidative
  stress if excessive glutamate-mediated NO synthesis combines with O2- from aerobic
  metabolism. Also depicted is the effect of inflammatory mediators that promote iNOS-mediated
  NO synthesis thereby promoting the formation of cell-damaging reactive oxygen and
  nitrogen species. These pro-oxidative mechanisms can be abrogated by endogenous
  antioxidant systems such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione that act
  as a sink to quench excessive NO and/or O2-. Abbreviations: calmodulin (Calm); cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP); endoplasmic reticulum (ER); glutamate (Glu); glutathione
  peroxidase (glut peroxidase); guanosine triphosphate (GTP); inducible nitric oxide
  synthase (iNOS); l-arginine (L-arg); neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS); nitric
  oxide (NO); NMDA receptor (NMDAR); phosphodiesterase (PDE); superoxide dismutase
  (SOD); superoxide (O2-); hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).'
