  reductase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; DMID, 7, 2′-dihydroxy, 4′-methoxyisoflavanol dehydratase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase; F3′5′H,
  flavonoid 3′5′ hydroxylase; FS1/FS2, flavone synthase; I2′H, isoflavone 2′-hydroxylase;
  IFR, isoflavone reductase; IFS, isoflavone synthase; IOMT, isoflavone O-methyltransferase;
  LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; OMT, O-methyltransferase;
  RT, rhamnosyl transferase; UFGT, UDPG flavonoid glucosyl transferase; VR, vestitone
  reductase. The names of the major classes of flavonoid endproducts are boxed. Some
  of the known functions of the compounds in each class are indicated in italics.
  Genes annotated in significantly enriched KEGG pathway in differentially expressed
  genes are highlighted in blue. Individual T0 (left) and T1 (right) are indicated
  in 2-box strings. Heat maps were drawn using ratio of RPKM (upper bract/lower leaf)
  values. Red indicates high RPKM value, green indicates low RPKM value. Adapted from
