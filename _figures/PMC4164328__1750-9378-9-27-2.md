caption: Intracellular pathway associated with GHR activation in hepatocytes. GH exerts
  its effect by binding to the extracellular domain of the GHR, where one molecule
  of GH binds two GHRs increasing the affinity of both receptors for two molecules
  of JAK2, which phosphorylate the GHR. GHR activation, in turn, triggers the activation
  of several signal transduction pathways, including STAT and PI3K through IRS. IRS
  and PI3K can activate nuclear transcription factors, including c-FOS and c-JUN,
  to induce cell proliferation and differentiation but also can increase glucose transport.
  GH-induced JAK2 activation phosphorilates STAT5 which translocates into the nucleus
  where binds to response elements in the regulatory regions of target genes including
  IGF1 and EGFR. The activation of adaptor protein SHC leads to the activation of
  MAPK involved in cell proliferation and growth.
