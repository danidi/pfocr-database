caption: 'Glycolysis. (A) Outline of glycolysis showing relationship with both the
  pentose phosphate pathway and fructose, including the Hers pathway (dotted lines
  indicate where multiple steps are not shown). (B) Summary showing how the pentose
  phosphate pathway might, in principle, bypass a block in glycolysis at GPI by producing
  fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which enter glycolysis at steps
  3 and 6 respectively. However, this is likely to be inefficient. (C) Summary showing
  how fructose can act as a substrate for glycolysis and bypass a block in glycolysis
  at GPI, either if it is phosphorylated to fructose 6-phosphate, which enters glycolysis
  at step 3, or if its phosphorylated to fructose 1-phosphate, which enters the Hers
  pathway and produces glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which enters glycolysis at step
  6. Seminal fluid is rich in fructose so fructose-fuelled glycolysis may explain
  how GPI1 null spermatozoa are able to function. If appropriate substrates for the
  TCA cycle are available, energy may also be produced in some cell types without
  involvement of glycolysis. The full enzyme names at each step in glycolysis are:
  (1) HK, hexokinase; (2) GPI, glucose phosphate isomerase; (3) PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  (4) ALDO, aldolase; (5) TPI, triosephosphate isomerase; (6) GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; (7) PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; (8) PGM, phosphoglycerate
  mutase; (9) ENO, enolase; (10) PK, pyruvate kinase. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
  is also shown. Other abbreviations: 1,3-bisPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 2-PG, 2-phosphoglycerate;
  3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fructose-1-P (or F1P),
  fructose-1-phosphate; Fructose-1,6 bisP (or F1,6bisP), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate;
  Fructose-6-P (or F6P), fructose 6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Glucose-6-P
  (or G6P), glucose 6-phosphate; HP, Hers pathway; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PPP,
  pentose phosphate pathway.'
