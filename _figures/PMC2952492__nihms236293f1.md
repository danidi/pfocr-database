caption: Regulation of neo-vascularization by SDF-1. The chemokine SDF-1 is produced
  by hypoxic conditions, vascular injury or tumors, and is released in the circulation.
  SDF-1 signaling induces a complex remodeling of the BM microenvironment involving
  proteases, Kit-ligand (KitL) and NO production, leading to mobilization of CXCR4+
  angiogenic cells. Ultimately, SDF-1 expression in the neo-angiogenic niche recruits
  CXCR4+ cells and mediates their proper retention, differentiation and pro-angiogenic
  activities in coordination with other angiogenic factors such as VEGF-A.
