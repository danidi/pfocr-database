caption: 'Primary cortical neuronal cultures were infected with Ad-GFP (50 MOI) prior
  to treatment with tBHQ. At this MOI the adenovirus selectively infected astrocytes
  allowing for FAC sorting to be performed on the cultures. Post-sort analysis of
  the isolated cell populations showed < 0.01% contamination on the neuronal GFP-negative
  pool with astrocytes and < 5% contamination of the astrocyte GFP-positive pool with
  neurons. RNA was isolated from the sorted pools and analyzed by microarray analysis
  (Kraft et al, 2004). A hypothetical diagram of some of the pathways changed with
  tBHQ treatment in the astrocytes (GFP-positive) and the neurons (GFP-negative) based
  upon microarray analysis is shown above. The protective cellular shield reflects
  genes that are consistently changed with activation of Nrf2 to combat oxidative
  stress and toxicants. The majority of these genes change in the astrocyte. Other
  genes involved in energy metabolism were also changed. Solid arrowheads indicate
  pathways with one or more enzymes upregulated by tBHQ treatment (eg. More than five
  enzymes converting glucose to pyruvate are increased by tBHQ in the astrocyte population).
  Hollow arrowheads on solid lines indicate known interactions that are not changed
  by tBHQ. Arrows with stippled lines indicate a proposed interaction between neurons
  and glia that is not yet proven. Files containing all of the microarray data are
  available for download at http://www.pharmacy.wisc.edu/facstaff/sciences/JohnsonGroup/microdata.cfm.
