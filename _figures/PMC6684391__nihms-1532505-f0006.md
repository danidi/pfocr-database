caption: The proposed interaction induced by azithromycin (AZM) is depicted. Azithromycin
  inhibits IFNγ-induced STAT-1 activation as well as inhibiting LPS mediated NF-κB
  activation. The nuclear translocation of p65 that results in pro-inflammatory gene
  transcription is inhibited by azithromycin. This is due, in part, to sustained IκBα
  levels at higher azithromycin concentrations, likely stemming from decreased kinase
  activity of IKKβ. Because p65 nuclear translocation is inhibited at time zero and
  at low azithromycin concentrations, additional mechanisms are likely at work. Increased
  total IKKβ is in part caused by a loss of negative feedback which otherwise shuts
  down the inflammatory signal by decreasing IKKβ production through decreased IKKβ
  gene expression. Accumulated IKKβ protein cross-inhibits the STAT-1 signaling pathway
  by decreasing STAT-1 phosphorylation thereby decreasing the associated pro-inflammatory
  gene transcription and increasing the expression of the M2-associated proteins including
  arginase-1.
