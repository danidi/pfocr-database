caption: A simplified scheme of the intracellular signalling pathways which control
  DC maturation and antigen presentation functions is indicated in the figure. On
  top, the DC plasma membrane containing a series of receptors which will recognise
  a wide variety of ligands. Some of these receptors are shown on top, such as Fas,
  immunoglobulin receptors (FcR), CD40, lectin receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR)
  and interferons (IFN). The binding of the corresponding ligands to their receptors
  will activate critical signalling pathways, as indicated below the membrane in the
  figure. Their involvement in several aspects of immune regulation is briefly indicated
  in the figure below each pathway.
