caption: Model outlining the LDCV/nuclear signaling pathway in which PAM and Uhmk1
  participate. Under basal conditions, the Uhmk1 site in the CD of PAM (Ser949) is
  phosphorylated, expediting PAM entry into LDCVs; late stages in the endocytic trafficking
  of PAM require both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at this site (,). The
  endoproteolytic cleavage that releases sf-CD is diminished in PAM with a phosphomimetic
  mutation at Ser949. In addition, Uhmk1 phosphorylation at this site reduces PAM-CD
  accumulation in the nucleus. Nuclear PAM-CD, acting through pathways that remain
  to be described, alters the expression of a limited subset of genes, including Aqp1,
  which is known to affect LDCV metabolism. In the nucleus, Uhmk1, which interacts
  with nuclear binding sites, can phosphorylate PAM-CD, leading to nuclear exit and
  rapid proteasomal degradation. PAM-1 with the phosphomimetic Asp949 mutation fails
  to traverse the endocytic compartment normally, fails to alter cytoskeletal organization
  or regulated secretion, and fails to generate sf-CD efficiently. Uhmk1 opposes many
  of the regulatory effects of PAM on LDCV metabolism; the factors that control Uhmk1
  localization are unknown. P, Phosphorylation; SG, secretory granule.
