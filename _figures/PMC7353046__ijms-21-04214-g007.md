caption: Adams–Oliver Syndrome and Notch signaling. Adams–Oliver Syndrome (AOS) is
  a rare inherited disorder characterized by aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp,
  terminal transverse limb defects, vascular anomalies, pulmonary and portal hypertension,
  and retinal hypervascularization. 71% of identified mutations in AOS cases have
  been identified in genes directly correlated to Notch signaling, therefore suggesting
  the crucial role of this pathway in the onset of AOS. Mutations have been registered
  in Notch1, DLL4, RBP-Jκ and EOGT genes, encoding, respectively, for Notch1, Delta-like
  4 ligand (DLL4), Recombination Signal Binding Protein for Immunoglobulin Kappa J
  Region (RBP-Jκ) and EGF domain-specific O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase
  (EOGT). The identified genetic variants impact the maturation of receptors, receptor-ligand
  binding and interaction, and ultimately the transcription of target genes. As a
  consequence, these mutations cause a disruption of Notch signaling, therefore negatively
  impacting proliferation and differentiation of epidermal cells. The remaining 29%
  of AOS cases carry causative variants in ARHGAP31, encoding for the Rho GTPase-activating
  protein 31 (ARHGAP31), and DOCK6, encoding for guanine nucleotide exchange factor
  (GEF), which are not directly associated with Notch signaling. The products of these
  genes are regulatory proteins implied in the formation of actin cytoskeleton and
  are consequently involved in cell morphology, cell migration, survival and division;
  therefore, variants in these genes are thought to negatively regulate these fundamental
  processes. Pointed arrows (→) define the induction of the indicated process or associated
  function, while the truncated arrow (T) designates the inhibition of the described
  process. The dotted line (---) indicates a proposed association that still needs
  to be clarified.
