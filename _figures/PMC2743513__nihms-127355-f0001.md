caption: 'Tumor-mediated mechanisms, either intrinsic or acquired by primary or established
  metastatic tumors, allow for evasion of anti-VEGF pathway inhibition. These include:
  1) tumoral upregulation of compensatory proangiogenic factors, 2) following initial
  tumor shrinkage, therapy-induced hypoxia mediates adaptation/evasion and tumor regrowth
  via rebound revascularization, vessel co-option, EMT, hypoxia, 3) Increased invasiveness,
  4) Increased intravasive potential. Host-mediated mechanisms, either direct (in
  response to drug action) or indirect (in response to cues from the tumor), could
  include 5) BMDC mobilization, 6) microenvironment / stromal cell activation, 7)
  EC dysfunction/inflammation/ thrombosis, 8) Pericyte dysfunction. Steps 5-7 could
  similarly lead to upregulation of compensatory proangiogenic molecules. Taken together,
  antiangiogenic therapy may increase tumor extravasive ability (9) and facilitate/accelerate
  disease in microscopic tumors. Legend: (EC) endothelial cell, (BM) basement membrane,
  (BMDC) bone marrow-derived cell, compensatory proangiogenic molecules (CAMs), (TAFs)
  tumor-associated fibroblasts.*illustration note — we welcome suggestions for additional
  material and/or figure improvement to increase clarity. Ideally we would like to
  have the colors of the tumor and host-mediated color squares (or other suggested
  shape) fuse together.'
