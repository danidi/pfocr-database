caption: A window into RiPP biosynthesis. (A) Schematic RiPP biosynthetic pathway.
  Representative RiPP biosynthetic gene cluster where each gene encodes a biosynthetic
  enzyme color-coded by the modification it catalyzes. Dotted circles represent amino
  acids within the leader peptide. Full circles represent amino acids within the core
  region. (B) Chemical structures of select RiPP subfamily members. Structural features
  defining a particular RiPP subfamily are shown in blue. Additional PTMs are shown
  in red.
