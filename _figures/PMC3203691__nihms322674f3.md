caption: Endothelial cell, astrocytes and microglia are a prominent source of CXCL10
  and CXCL9. 1) Through T cells sequestration [-, ]. CXCL10 could attract activated
  T cells and mediate Th1-type response, characterized by the sequestration of monocytes
  and T cells (mainly CD8+) in cerebral microvessels. Granule exocytosis and Fas/Fas
  ligand activation pathways are two distinct mechanisms involved in the death of
  brain endothelial cells by CD8+ lymphocytes. 2)Through NK cell sequestration [-],
  NK cells mediate direct cytotoxic activity or reconstitution of capacity of T cells
  to migrate in response to CXCL10 to the CNS. 3) Through upregulation of ICAM-1 on
  brain microvascular endothelial cells [], LTα and IFN-γ are required for P.berghei
  ANKA(PbA)-induced endothelial ICAM-1 up regulation, increased in cytoadherence of
  sequestration of parasitized RBC (pRBC) to the endothelium of cerebral vessels,
  resulting in hypoxia, hemorrhage and pathology representing another potential mechanism
  of CM pathogenesis.
