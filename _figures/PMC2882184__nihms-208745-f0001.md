caption: Pathway analysis using all altered genes and proteins. The network shown
  represents the most statistically probable pathways and elements when analyzed from
  receptor activation to signaling. One canonical pathway, β-catenin, activated through
  ITGB3 is shown by the broad line. This would ultimately result in altered expression
  of c-myc, which is a central transcription factor involved with a high percentage
  of the altered genes and proteins. Genes and proteins that were identified and are
  in the network are highlighted by large circles. Under expression is represented
  by black circles (i.e. collagen III) and over expression by white circles (ITGB3).
  Interactions between elements are defined by the interconnecting lines, for example
  phosphorylation between GSK3 beta and beta-catenin.
