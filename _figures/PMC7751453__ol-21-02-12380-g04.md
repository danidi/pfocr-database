caption: Schematic representation of the pathway modulated by miR-21 in Thp-1 cells
  progressing through the cell cycle. miR-21-5p targets BCL11B, which might modulate
  the cell cycle effectors Chk1 and MDM2. BCL11B binds to the human MDM2-P2 promoter
  and inhibits MDM2 expression. MDM2 inhibits the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and
  Rb, which promotes cell arrest in the G1 phase. Besides, BCL11B promotes the activation
  of the cell cycle checkpoint kinase Chk1, which leads to arrest of the cell cycle
  at the S phase by Cdc25A phosphorylation. miR, microRNA; BCL11B, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia
  11B; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; Chk1, checkpoint kinase 1; MDM2, murine doubleminute
  2.
