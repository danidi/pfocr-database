caption: Control of Food Intake by the Hypothalamic Leptin-Melanocortin PathwayThe
  hypothalamus receives and integrates neural, metabolic, and hormonal signals to
  regulate energy homeostasis. In particular, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin
  and the melanocortin pathway have a critical role in the control of food intake.AgRP,
  Agouti-related protein; Arc, arcuate nucleus; MC4R, melanocortin 4 receptor; POMC,
  pro-opiomelanocortin; PVN, paraventricular nucleus.
