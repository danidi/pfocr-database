caption: 'Organization of the bolagladin biosynthetic gene cluster (bolA‐T) and proposed
  pathway for bolagladin biosynthesis. The precise timing of O‐methylation of the
  citrate‐derived starter unit for fatty acid biosynthesis remains to be established,
  but it is postulated to be an early step. Abbreviations are as follows: A, adenylation
  domain; TE, thioesterase domain; CI, chain initiating condensation domain; LCL,
  chain elongating condensation domain utilizing two l‐configured aminoacyl thioesters;
  CE, bifunctional epimerization–condensation domain; FAS, fatty acid synthase. Acyl
  carrier proteins (ACPs) and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains are shown as
  black circles.'
