caption: Major Anti-tumorigenic pharmacological properties of thymoquinone. TQ is
  a multi-targeting anticancer molecule. It prevents the formation of carcinogenic
  metabolites from pro-carcinogens by inhibiting CYP enzymes. By virtue of its free
  radical scavenging properties, TQ can inhibit ROS-mediated DNA damage induction
  and genetic instability and thereby prevent tumorigenesis. TQ also exhibits anti-proliferative
  and anti-survival effects by interfering in the MAPK/ERK pathway. In addition, TQ
  is found to modulate the activity of various transcription factors like NF-κB and
  STAT3. IKKs activates NF-κB by inducing the phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation
  of NF-κB inhibitor IκBa. The resulting free NF-κB (e.g., heterodimer of p65 and
  p50 subunits) then translocates to the nucleus and activate the transcription of
  various target genes that encodes numerous inflammatory mediators, pro-angiogenic
  factors, anti-apoptotic proteins. By targeting IKKs and thus inhibiting NF-κB activation,
  TQ shows anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic effects. Persistent
  STAT3 activity is a common feature in various malignancies. Overactive STAT3 leads
  to the dysregulation of immune response in tumor microenvironment by interfering
  in the proliferation and activation of various immune cells (e.g., NK cells, Neutrophils),
  maturation of DC, activation of tumor-antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and differentiation
  of plasma cells. TQ has shown inhibitory effect on both the constitutive and ligand-induced
  activation of these transcription factors by disrupting their upstream signaling
  pathways, and thereby might reverse immune suppression and potentiate the efficacy
  of immunotherapeutic agents. ROS, Reactive oxygen species; MAPK, Mitogen-activated
