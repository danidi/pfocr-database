caption: Ang II activates the Notch1/Snail signaling, which is responsible for the
  pathogenesis of proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy. Schematic drawing summarizes
  the molecular pathway by which Ang II, after binding with angiotensin type 1 receptor
  (AT1R), induces increased activation of Notch1. The active Notch1 (ICN1) via the
  downstream target gene, HES1, increases the expression of Snail and its translocation
  into the nucleus, leading to nephrin down-regulation. This series of events is responsible
  for the molecular podocyte lesions and loss of the glomerular permeability in diabetes.
