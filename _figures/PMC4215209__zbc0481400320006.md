caption: A working model of the biosynthetic pathway of LM and LAM as deduced from
  these and earlier studies. The key intermediate, M10–11-pLM, is shown in the center
  and lead to wild-type LM and LAM and to the polymers produced by the different constructs
  studied herein. The non-reducing terminal is shown as fully branched, but it is
  most likely that some of the branches at the non-reducing termini are occasionally
  missing.
