caption: Proposed metabolic pathway and labeling of sulfur compounds, 2,3-pentanedione,
  and degradation intermediates produced by G. candidum and B. linens. Identified
  intermediates and end products are enclosed in boxes. Dashed lines indicate that
  both chemical and enzymatic reactions are involved. Gc, G. candidum; Bl, B. linens;
  ATase, aminotransferase; Red, reduction step; Ox., oxidation step; CoA, coenzyme
  A; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate.
