caption: 'Summary of the effects of the MC1R agonists α-MSH and ACTH and the antagonists
  ASIP and HBD3 on functional MC1R, and the impact of loss of function of MC1R on
  these effects. Activation of the MC1R, expressed on the cell membrane of melanocytes
  by either agonist, α-MSH or ACTH activates the cAMP pathway, leading to increased
  eumelanin synthesis, which quenches reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduces the
  generation of DNA damage upon UV exposure. Activation of the cAMP pathway also enhances
  the DNA repair and antioxidant capacities of melanocytes. The cumulative outcome
  of these effects is maintenance of genomic stability of melanocytes. Treatment of
  melanocytes with either ASIP or HBD3 antagonizes the effects of α-MSH, and are therefore
  expected to reduce genomic stability. Expression of loss-of-function-MC1R disrupts
  the signaling of the agonist-bound receptor, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of
  eumelanin, allowing only the synthesis of pheomelanin, which increases the generation
  of ROS and NOS, and allows for increased UV-induced DNA damage. Additionally, lack
  of signaling of the α-MSH-bound MC1R via the cAMP pathway inhibits the activation
  of antioxidant and DNA repair pathways, leading to reduced genomic stability of
  UV-irradiated melanocytes, and increased risk for malignant transformation to melanoma.
