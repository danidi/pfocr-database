caption: (A) Summary sketch.(B) (i) Gene circuit model adapted from Dingal et al.
  (), with (ii) governing equations. Squares = genes, circles = protein. LMNA and
  myosin-II protein (l and m) are weak regulators of the Serum Response Factor (SRF)
  pathway. LMNA upregulates its own transcription (via RARγ). LMNA and collagen-I
  protein turnover with x and z sensitivity of degradation to myosin tension. Myosin-II
  protein turnover depends on matrix elasticity E which scales with collagen-I ().
