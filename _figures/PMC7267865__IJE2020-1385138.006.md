caption: Brain pathways mediating ghrelin's effects on food motivation. The main pathway
  involved in food motivation is the midbrain DA projection from the VTA to the NAcc.
  Ghrelin appears to activate this pathway directly at the level of the VTA, which
  in turn gives a potential mechanism for ghrelin to promote food intake even when
  homeostatic hypothalamic centers such as the ARC or lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)
  indicate a state of satiety. Ghrelin also affects food motivation indirectly by
  activating an afferent pathway. At the level of the VTA, opioid signaling (but not
  NPY signaling) is required for ghrelin's effects on food motivation.
