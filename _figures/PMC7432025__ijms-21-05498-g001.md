caption: Acinetobacter baumannii uses different mechanisms to evade the innate immune
  response. ① Hepta-acylation of lipid A in lipooligosaccharide (LOS) fortifies the
  outer membrane (OM) and protects A. baumannii from cationic antimicrobial peptides
  (AMPs), colistin, and lysozyme. ② Highly hydrophilic and negatively charged capsular
  polysaccharides (CPS) hinder interactions with negatively charged surfaces of neutrophils
  and macrophages; the capsule is also a barrier which protects against complement-mediated
  killing, lysozyme degradation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ③ Outer membrane
  protein A (OmpA) interacts with factor H (FH), thereby inhibiting the complement-mediated
  killing; OmpA induces ROS production and the death of dendritic cells (DCs). ④ CipA
  forms a complex with plasminogen/plasmin, which degrades the complement component
  C3b; CipA and ⑤ the protein killing factor (PKF) serine protease inhibit the alternative
  complement pathway. ⑥ The type II secretion system (T2SS) contributes to serum resistance,
  and it probably participates in CipA and PKF serine protease secretion. ⑦ Surface-exposed
  phospholipids are potential activators of the alternative complement pathway. The
  Mla system prevents the accumulation of phospholipids in the outer leaflet of the
  OM. ⑧ Phenylacetate, a derivative of phenylalanine and neutrophil attractant, is
  removed from the bacterial cell by conversion to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and succinyl-CoA.
  ⑨ Enhanced catalase activity enables A. baumannii to survive in macrophages in the
  presence of ROS. ⑩ A. baumannii can spread during infection using neutrophils and
  macrophages.
