caption: Model for TGF-β1-induced PAI-1 expression. TGF-β1 activates two distinct
  signaling pathways to initiate PAI-1 transcription. Rho/ROCK are required to maintain
  SMAD phosphorylation and ERK activation (through to be defined mechanisms) while
  the pp60c-src-activated EGFR (at the Y845 site) signals to MEK-ERK initiating ERK/USF
  interactions resulting in USF phosphorylation and a subtype (USF-1 → USF-2) switch
  (e.g., []) at the PAI-1 PE1/PE2 E box sites. Collectively, these promoter-level
  events stimulate high level PAI-1 expression in response to TGF-βR occupancy. The
  actual mechanism underlying EGFR activation in response to TGF-β1 may involve direct
  recruitment of src kinases to the EGFR or the processing/release of a membrane-anchored
  EGFR ligand (e.g., HB-EGF). Events associated with TGF-β1 stimulation of the RhoA/ROCK
  pathway are similarly unclear. Rho/ROCK may regulate the activity and/or function
  of the SMAD phosphatase PPM1A impacting, thereby, the duration of SMAD-dependent
  transcription of target genes such as PAI-1. (modified from []).
