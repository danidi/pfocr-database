caption: S-phase signaling pathways inferred with different heuristics. The membrane-bound
  proteins are depicted at the top, the TFs are at the bottom and the inferred proteins
  in the middle. Proteins that occur in the KEGG pathway but not inferred by any heuristic
  are depicted in gray. The varying core proteins are indicated through gray boxes,
  which provide their bow tie score. All recall and precision values are provided
  in Table 1.
