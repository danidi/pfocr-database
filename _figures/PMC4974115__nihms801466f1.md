caption: When complement encounters a foreign cell, the recognition molecules C1q,
  mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins, and collectin-11 sense antibody clusters
  or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate associated serine
  proteases (C1r, C1s or MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs)) that cleave C4 and
  C2 to form the C3 convertase (C4b2b) of the classical pathway (CP) and lectin pathway
  (LP) on the triggering cell. In addition, tick-over or surface interactions of C3
  with certain cell surfaces leads to C3 hydrolysis and generation of initial alternative
  pathway (AP) C3 convertases. All C3 convertases cleave C3 into the anaphylatoxin
  C3a and C3b, the latter of which is deposited on activating surfaces (opsonization).
  Factor B (FB) binds to C3b and gets activated by Factor D (FD) to form the final
  AP convertases (C3bBb), which activate more C3 to C3b and fuel an amplification
  loop. Increasing densities of C3b deposition favour the generation of C5 convertases,
  which activate C5 to release the anaphylatoxin C5a and C5b, which, after tiered
  interactions with C6–C9 and membrane insertion, in turn forms membrane attack complexes
  (MACs), which leads to lysis, damage, or activation of target cells. The released
  anaphylatoxins act as immune mediators and, particularly in the case of C5a, attract
  and prime immune cells. Interaction of the C3b opsonin and its degradation products
  iC3b and C3dg with complement receptors (CRs) mediates cell adhesion (via CR1 (also
  known as CD35)) and/or phagocytic uptake (via CR3, CR4, and CRIg). Concurrently,
  iC3b and C3dg modulate adaptive immune responses by binding to CR2 on the B cell
  co receptor, thereby lowering the threshold of B cell stimulation. Properdin (FP)
  stabilizes the C3 and C5 convertases and increases complement-mediated opsonization
  and effector generation. On healthy cells, complement activation is tightly controlled.
  C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), MAP1 and sMAP regulate the activity of recognition
  complexes, whereas soluble C4b-binding protein (C4BP) and factor H (FH) — which
  recognize self-surface patterns such as heparin and sialic acid, and bind to host
  cells — or membrane-bound regulators of complement activation (RCA) proteins (CD35,
  CD46 and CD55) control convertase activity by accelerating convertase decay and/or
  act as cofactors for the factor I (FI)-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b. Finally,
  CD59, clusterin (clu) and vitronectin (vtn) prevent formation of MAC. ‘Silent’ removal
  of damaged and apoptotic cells, debris, and immune complexes is achieved through
  the sensing of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), either directly by
  complement recognition complexes or mediated by modulators such as pentraxins (for
  example, PTX3). Controlled activation of complement occurs with limited deposition
  of opsonins that facilitate phagocytic clearance. In addition to C3b/iC3b/C3dg,
  C1q also contributes to clearance by binding to C1q receptors (gC1qR and cC1qR).
  CA, cofactor activity; CRIg, CR of the immunoglobulin superfamily; DAA, decay acceleration
  activity; FcγR, Fcγ receptor.
