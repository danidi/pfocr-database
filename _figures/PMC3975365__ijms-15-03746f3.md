caption: 'The so-called PI3-K/Akt/mTOR survival pathway. The complex signaling cascades
  initiated by the near-apical PI3-K are usually referred to as the PI3-K/Akt/mTOR
  survival pathway. Shown here is a highly simplified diagram of the non-controversial
  interactions that have been described in the literature, with particular emphasis
  on the potential therapeutic targets within this signaling complex, PI3-K, mTOR,
  Akt and DNA-PK, while the pro-apoptic molecules that can be blocked by activation
  of the PI3-K/Akt/mTOR pathway are highlighted in green. Of interest are two particular
  aspects: (1) The complexity of interactions which—depending on cellular context,
  outside influences and time points investigated—can lead, in extreme cases, to diametrically
  opposite outcomes. For the sake of clarity the interaction and crosstalk with other
  equally complex signaling cascades, most notably MAP kinase signaling [], is not
  shown; (2) While cellular survival is indisputably a key aspect regulated by PI3-K,
  other cellular aspects of equal interest to cancer research are also affected by
  PI3-K signaling, such as motility, metabolism, cell cycle progression and DNA damage
  repair (underscored). Considering both of these points it becomes apparent that
  effective modulation of this cascade in order to enhance therapeutic efficacy cannot
  be simply reduced to a strong, prolonged inhibition of the most apical proteins.'
