caption: 'Silencing of a root-expressed type III polyketide synthase reduces tropane
  and pyrrolidine alkaloid levels. a The tropane and pyrrolidine alkaloid biosynthetic
  pathway in the Solanaceae starting from putrescine (1). Experimentally validated
  enzymes are shown in blue, AbPYKS is noted in red, and unknown reactions are noted
  with question marks. Enzyme abbreviations are as follows: PMT; putrescine methyltransferase,
  MPO; methylputrescine oxidase, TRI; tropinone reductase I, TRII; tropinone reductase
  II; CYP80F1; littorine mutase, H6H; hyoscyamine-6-hydroxylase. b Abundance of tropane
  and pyrrolidine alkaloids together with selected precursors in TRV2 empty vector
  control lines (cyan bars) and TRV2:ab1322 (AbPYKS) VIGS lines (green bars). Data
  are presented as the mean n = 24 biological replicates for TRV2 empty vector control
  lines and n = 23 for TRV2:ab1322 (AbPYKS) VIGS lines. Asterisks denote significant
  differences (***p < 0.001) as determined by Student’s t test. This experiment was
  replicated twice. For each box plot, the lower and upper bounds of the box indicate
  the first and third quartiles, the line indicates the median value, and the whiskers
  extend to the minimum and maximum data points. Source Data are provided as a Source
