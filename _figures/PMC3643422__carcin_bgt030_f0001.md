caption: 'Illustration showing the overall sex hormone metabolic pathway and subpathways.
  Genes (in italics) involved in androgen synthesis (light gray background), estrogen
  synthesis (or androgen to estrogen conversion, medium gray background) and estrogen
  removal (dark gray background) are indicated (Figure adapted from Li et al. () and
  Yang et al. ()). Androgen synthesis genes: cytochrome P450 (CYP), family 11, subfamily
  A, polypeptide 1 (CYP11A), CYP17A1, hydroxysteroid (3-beta) dehydrogenase 1 (HSD3B1),
  HSD3B2, CYP21A2 and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR). Estrogen synthesis
  gene: Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1), AKR1C2, AKR1C3, AKR1C4, CYP11B1,
  androgen receptor (AR), CYP11B2, CYP19A1, hydroxysteroid (11-beta) dehydrogenase
  1 (HSD11B1), HSD3B1, HSD3B2, progesterone receptor (PGR), steroid 5-alpha-reductase
  (SRD5A1), SRD5A2, DHEA sulfotransferase (SULT2A1), hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase
  (SULT2B1), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 family (UGTA1), UGT1A10, UGT1A3, UGT1A4,
  UGT1A5, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT2A1, UGT2A3, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B10,
  UGT2B11, UGT2B17, UGT2B28, CYP1B1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7 and SHBG. Estrogen removal
  genes: CYP1B1, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7,
  estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), ESR2, glutathione S-transferase p1 (GSTP1), HSD17B1,
  HSD17B2, HSD17B3, HSD17B4, SHBG, SULT1A1, SULT1A2, estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1),
  UGT1A1, UGT1A10, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A5, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
  2 family A1 (UGT2A1), UGT2A3, UGT2B10, UGT2B11, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7. Steroid sulfatase
  isozyme S (STS), N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1), NAT2 and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone
  1 (NQO1) genes are not shown because these genes were not included in our analyses.
  The most significant SNP from each of the six significant genes associated with
  ESCC risk in this study is also highlighted in parentheses beside the gene. For
  additional information on assignment of the remaining tag SNPs to their relevant
  gene and subpathway, see Supplementary Table 6, available at Carcinogenesis Online.'
