caption: A. Dicer is the key miRNA-producing enzyme and affects innate signaling pathways
  via its role in miRNA production.B. Dicer can process virus-derived RNA and feed
  it into the RNAi pathway, resulting in direct interference of viral transcripts
  or viral genomes. Dicer is known to cleave dsRNA and Dicer-cleavage products have
  been found in cells infected with various viruses.C. Dicer functions as part of
  larger viral-RNA bound detection complex along with the RLRs. These proteins all
  have helicase domains that bind to dsRNA. By forming a complex with RLRs, Dicer
  may enhance their antiviral effects.RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; LGP2, laboratory
  of genetics and physiology-2; IFN, interferon.
