caption: '(A) A combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to decreased
  prefrontal glutamate signaling and depression symptoms (left). Rapid-acting antidepressant
  treatments, such as ketamine, are proposed to reverse this decrease in prefrontal
  glutamate signaling, leading to rapid and sustained relief of symptoms (right).
  (B) Schematic diagram of the mediodorsal thalamus to prefrontal cortex neural pathway.
  Activation of this pathway by metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGlu2/3) negative
  allosteric modulator (NAM) treatment is proposed to lead to a reversal of passive
  coping and anhedonic behaviors in mice, indicative of antidepressant-like responses.
  (C) Schematic diagram of the synaptic mechanisms targeted by mGlu2- and mGlu3-specific
  NAMs. Presynaptic mGlu2 acts as an inhibitory autoreceptor to restrain vesicular
  glutamate release. mGlu2-specific NAMs enhance presynaptic glutamate release by
  attenuating this inhibitory feedback mechanism. mGlu3 located postsynaptically mediates
  long-term depression through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
  (AMPA) receptor down-regulation. mGlu3-specific NAMs enhance glutamatergic signaling
  by attenuating this form of postsynaptic plasticity. mGlu3 is also found on astrocytes,
  and their activation enhances synaptic glutamate reuptake – however an interaction
  between astrocytic mGlu3 and mGlu3-specific NAMs is not tested for in the current
  study.Abbreviations: BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor; EAAT1/2, excitatory
  amino acid transporter 1 and 2; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NMDA,
