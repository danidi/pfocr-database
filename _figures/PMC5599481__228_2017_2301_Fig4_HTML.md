caption: Overview of arachidonic acid cascade associated with inflammatory pain response.
  Arachidonic acid is released from cellular membranes by cytosolic phospholipase
  A 2(PLA 2). The free arachidonic acid can further be converted to eicosanoids by
  three different pathways involving lipoxygenases (LO), cyclooxygenases (COX), and
  the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase pathway (not shown), respectively. COX enzymes
  catalyse the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2, which is reduced
  to prostaglandin H 2(PGH 2). By specific prostaglandin (PG) and thromboxane (TXA
  2) synthases, PGH2 is subsequently converted to different prostaglandins and thromboxane
  A 2. Different LO enzymes convert the arachidonic acid to biologically active metabolites
  such as leukotrienes and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs). In the leukotriene
  pathway, arachidonic acid is converted to 5-HPETE, which is further metabolised
  to the unstable leukotriene A 4(LTA 4). LTA 4 is converted to LTB 2 or the cysteinyl-containing
  LTC 4, LTD 4, and LTE 4. Adapted from []
