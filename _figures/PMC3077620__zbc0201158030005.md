caption: The mTORC2-mediated Akt HM site phosphorylation directs the active Akt for
  Lys-48 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Newly synthesized Akt is
  phosphorylated by mTORC2 at Thr-450 in the TM, which constitutes the total Akt pool.
  In response to growth factor stimulation (IGF-1), Akt translocates to the plasma
  membrane where it is activated by phosphorylation at the A-loop (Thr-308) and hydrophobic
  motif (Ser-473) by PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively. Akt is subsequently inactivated
  by phosphatases or is targeted for polyubiquitination and degradation via the proteasomal
  pathway.
