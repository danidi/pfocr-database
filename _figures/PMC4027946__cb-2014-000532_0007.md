caption: 'A model for steady-state pSer, pThr, and pTyr levels in WT vs ΔserB E. coli
  strains. A WT cell (left) contains low levels of phosphothreonine (pT), and the
  serine biosynthetic pathway (SerA, SerC, SerB) catabolizes phosphoserine (pS). Low
  phosphate conditions (middle) induces the PHO regulon and phosphate uptake machinery.
  In the absence of SerB, pS accumulates and extracellular pS, phosphothreonine (pT);
  phosphotyrosine (pY) can elevate intracellular pT/pY levels. In this study, we show
  that pY is imported by additional unknown transport pathways and various media conditions
  can support intracellular pS/pT/pY levels on par with standard amino acids (20 aa,
  represented by circle size). High phosphate minimal media (right) suppresses PHO
  regulon phosphatase activities and, in the absence of SerB, can result in pS levels
  10-fold higher than the standard 20 aa. Abbreviations: d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  (pG); 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (pHP); serine (S); threonine (T); inorganic phosphate
  (Pi); Organophosphate transporter (phnD,phnE1,phnC).'
