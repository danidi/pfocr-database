caption: 'Mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to CD38 antibodies. CD38-targeting
  antibodies have Fc-dependent immune effector mechanisms: complement-dependent cytoxicity
  (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity (ADCC). NK cells play an important role in CD38 antibody-mediated ADCC,
  but the possible additional role of other effector cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils,
  eosinophils, and γδ T-cells, is currently unknown. Daratumumab and isatuximab also
  have immunomodulatory effects via the eradication of CD38-positive regulatory T-cells,
  regulatory B-cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which is associated with
  CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell expansion, and probably a better host-anti-tumor immune response.
  In addition, CD38 inhibition on T-cells by anti-CD38 antibodies may also contribute
  to improved anti-tumor activity by increasing NAD+ levels in T-cells. It is currently
  unknown whether MOR202 has immunomodulatory effects. In addition, isatuximab also
  directly induces MM cell death by both the classical caspase-dependent apoptotic
  pathway and lysosomal cell death pathway. Determinants and mechanisms of primary
  or acquired resistance to these individual modes of action are indicated (in purple),
  as well as strategies of how to improve these mechanisms of action in order to improve
  sensitivity and prevent development of resistance (indicated in red). In case the
  indicated agents have been tested or are being tested in a clinical trial, we added
  between brackets the CD38 antibody in the combination regimen (D, daratumumab; I,
  isatuximab; M, MOR202). General mechanisms of resistance include the presence of
  high-risk cytogenetic abnormailities and development of anti-drug antibodies. Of
  note, most data with respect to mechanisms of resistance to CD38 antibodies is derived
  from studies, which evaluated daratumumab. Additional studies are required for isatuximab
  and MOR202.'
