caption: A hypothetical model of the role of aP2 in macrophages is depicted. In the
  presence of aP2 (left panel), the availability of fatty acids (FA) or other bioactive
  lipid mediators is restricted, hence fatty acids are unable to interact with targets
  such as PPARγ and components of the IKK-NF-κB pathway. As such, aP2 may act to control
  signaling through these pathways. In the absence of aP2 (right panel), increased
  availability of FA inhibits the NF-κB pathway, resulting in the blockade of inflammatory
  responses, and enhances PPARγ activity, resulting in accelerated cholesterol trafficking.
  Although the identity of the key aP2 ligands and the specific mechanisms of action
  remain to be determined, this model suggests that aP2 may coordinately control macrophage
  signaling pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and
  atherosclerosis.
