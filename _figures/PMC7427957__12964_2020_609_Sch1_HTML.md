caption: Overview of the Pro-Apoptotic Effects of Zyflamend in Pancreatic Cancer Cells.
  Zyflamend treatment induced ER stress, autophagy, MAP kinases and apoptosis in pancreatic
  β-TC6 Cells. Previous studies have shown that activation of AMPK in pancreatic cancer
  cells by chemotherapeutic agens induces apoptosis and autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR
  signaling pathway (dotted lines) []. Similarly, activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway
  [] by stressors and chemotherapeutic agents can lead to apoptotic cell death of
  pancreatic cancer cells. Our study shows that treatment with pan-caspase inhibitor
  Z-VAD.fmk prevented the cleavage of caspase 3 but had no effects on AMPK, autophagy,
  or ER stress. Zyflamend treatment activated AMPK; however, treatment with AMPK inhibitor
  CC did not result in changes to ER stress, apoptosis, autophagy, or JNK signaling
  pathways. Autophagy inhibition with 3-MA inhibited autophagy and apoptosis only.
  Zyflamend activated both the IRE-1 and PERK branches of the ER stress mediated UPR
  and resulted in the subsequent upregulation of the downstream JNK signaling pathway.
  ER stress inhibition with 4-PBA resulted in decreased JNK activation, autophagy,
  and apoptosis. While inhibition of JNK with SP600125 significantly reduced the the
  level of both, apoptosis and autophagy
