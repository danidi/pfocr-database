caption: Targeting feed-forward signaling of TGFβ/NOX4/DHFR/eNOS uncoupling/TGFβ axis
  with anti-TGFβ and folic acid attenuates formation of aortic aneurysms. Our data
  for the first time establish a novel feed-forward mechanism of TGFβ/NOX4/DHFR/eNOS
  uncoupling/TGFβ axis in the development of TAA in MFS mice, targeting of which with
  anti-TGFβ or FA diet (via DHFR/H4B/eNOS recoupling/NO pathway) abrogates aneurysm
  formation in MFS mice. Notably, FA diet downregulated TGFβ and NOX4 protein expression,
  further disrupting the feed-forward loop to attenuate aneurysm formation. Correction
  of fibrillin is additionally beneficial in preserving GTPCHI protein abundance to
  maintain eNOS coupling activity.
