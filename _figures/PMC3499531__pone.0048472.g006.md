caption: 'A graphical representation for two KEGG pathways: (A) B cell receptor signaling
  pathway and (B) natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Because the original
  KEGG graph is much larger, we only present the center genes and genes neighboring
  these central nodes. If mapped, genes representing nodes were either highlighted
  with light green or light blue colors. Genes highlighted with light blue contain
  SNPs.'
