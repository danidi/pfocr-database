caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathways regulating epithelial immune
  response in nematode epidermal (a) and intestinal (b) cells, adapted from Tan and
  Shapira . The scheme is based on C. elegans immune response. GPA-12, NSY-1, cnc-2,
  lys-2, lys-7, nlp-29, and spp-1 are displayed in grey as transcripts corresponding
  to L. oneistus orthologs have not been identified yet. The p38 MAPK pathway (black
  receptors, letters, and arrows) regulates the expression of nlp-29, an antimicrobial
  peptide (AMP) encoding gene in the epithelial cell. A second AMP, encoded by cnc-2,
  is regulated by neuronally expressed dbl-1 that actives the epidermal cell TGF-β
  pathway (blue letters). The G-protein-coupled receptors that engage epithelial Goα
  signaling to modulate epidermal cell immune response is not known. b In the intestinal
  epithelial cell, the IIS pathway (red letters, receptors and arrows) is regulated
  primarily by the insulin-like ligand released by the neuron. IIS activity regulates
  DAF-16 subcellular localization. A separate G-protein signaling pathway (black receptors,
  letters and arrows) modulates the activity of the p38 MAPK module through phospholipases
  such as EGL-8, which determines the level of diacylglycerol, and protein kinase
  D (DFK-2). The G-protein-coupled receptors that engage epithelial Goα and neuronal
  Goα and Gqα signaling to modulate intestinal cell immune response are not known.
