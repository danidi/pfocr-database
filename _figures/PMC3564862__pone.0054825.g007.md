caption: 'Note that several reaction pairs (Rxn 1 vs. Rxn 10; Rxn 3 vs. Rxn 9; Rxn
  6 vs. Rxn 8; Rxn 49 vs. Rxn 50; and Rxn 44 vs. Rxn 45) form futile cycles. Thick
  black lines indicate active (or dominant) reactions whereas gray lines represent
  inactive (i.e. flux = 0) reactions. Dashed lines depict reactions not shown in detail.
  Positive flux values for reversible reactions which are in the gluconeogenic pathway
  in the figure indicate that gluconeogenesis is active. Fluxes of irreversible reactions
  should be equal or greater than zero. Directions of reactions are given in . Flux
  units are µmol/g liver/h. A: Sham+Fed group; B: Sham+Fasted group; C: Burn+Fed group;
  D: Burn+Fasted group.'
