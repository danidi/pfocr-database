caption: A diagram showing the signaling pathways involving HIPK/Daxx/JNK for steroidogenic
  gene expression and for apoptosis. The upper rectangle shows steroidogenic gene
  activation in Y1 cells, and the lower panel indicates the apoptosis pathway in Hep3B
  cells. The solid arrows indicate direct effects, and dotted arrows indicate indirect
  effects involving several steps.
