caption: '(a) Proposed model for Notch and BCR-ABL cross-talk in CML. Both BCR-ABL
  and Notch activate the PI3K/AKT-mTOR pathway that may trigger the survival and proliferation
  signals to CML cells. Blocking BCR-ABL kinase activity may not be sufficient to
  induce apoptosis as this may switch to survival signals to the PI3K pathway activated
  by Notch in CML cells. In this model, IM may be upregulating Notch by modulating
  Wnt component GSK3β and/or Dishevelled. IM-induced activation of GSK3β or inhibition
  of Dishevelled stabilises ICN in the cytoplasm, which in turn activates the PI3K/AKT-mTOR
  signalling by upregulation of Hes1 which abolish the inhibitory effect of PTEN on
  PI3K pathway. (b) Cooperative model of activated Notch and BCR-ABL signalling in
  chronic phase CML. Both Notch and BCR-ABL are activated in chronic phase CML and
  may activate survival signalling pathways to inhibit apoptosis in CD34+ CML cells.
  In vitro inhibition of Notch by GSI-induced BCR-ABL activity to keep the same level
  of survival signals is required for CML cell. Treatment with IM leads to activation
  of Notch signalling to maintain the same level of survival signals needed by CML
  cells to inhibit apoptosis. The net effect is maintenance of balanced levels of
  survival signals that protect CD34+ CML cells from apoptosis in the chronic phase
  of CML (GSI: γ-secretase inhibitor, IM: imatinib mesylate).'
