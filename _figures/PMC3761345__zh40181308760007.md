caption: Regulation of cardiac myofilament contractility by pharmacological modulation
  of the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R). ANG II stimulates G protein- and β-arrestin-2-mediated
  signaling at the AT1R, including Ca2+ release via the G protein pathway, alterations
  in Tm phosphorylation, and relative β- and α-MHC expression. The net effect of these
  signals after chronic ANG II stimulation is cardiac hypetrophy, increased Ca2+ sensitivity,
  increased maximum tension, and decreased Ca2+ cooperativity of cardiac myofilaments.
  Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as Los, antagonize both G protein and
  β-arrestin pathways, blocking the cardiac hypertrophy and changes in myofilament
  contractility caused by ANG II. β-Arrestin-biased ligands, such as TRV, block ANG
  II-mediated cardiac hypertrophy but preserve or enhance the inotropic effects of
  altered myofilament phosphorylation. Orange shading indicates effects that may be
  adverse, whereas green shading indicates effects that may be beneficial in the setting
  of cardiovascular disease. GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinases.
