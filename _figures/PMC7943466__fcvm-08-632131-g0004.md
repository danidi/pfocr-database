caption: The general mechanism of MP formation, its mode of action, and the proposed
  possible impacts of diets on MPs that could be linked with CSVD. (A) Active translocase
  transporting phosphatidylserine (PS) from outside to inside layer through adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP)–dependent manner. (B) Modifiable cardiocerebrovascular risk factors
  (with emphasis on dietary patterns in this review) are known to induce cellular
  activation or other cellular stressors (e.g., increased cytokines and from peripheral
  and GIT dysbiosis). (C) The activation causes an increase in intracellular cytosolic
  calcium release by stressed rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and acquired from
  extracellular space. Hence, activates enzymes calpain and gelsolin that cleave cell
  membrane cytoskeleton. (D) The cleaved cytoskeleton causes inactivation of translocase
  and hence induces phospholipid “flip-flopping.” (E) Externalization of PS produces
  MPs that bring their parent surface molecules and protein antigens. (F) MP productions
  can trigger series of microthrombotic cascades that could be linked to the mechanism
  postulates on CVSD risk predisposition/prevention that could be modulated by dietary
  pattern. For example, leukocyte-derived MPs (LDMPs) expressed P-selectin glycoprotein
  ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and platelet P-selectin on their surfaces and hence aided the
  aggregation of TF-bearing leukocytes at the site of vascular or microvascular injury.
  Besides, LDMPs were also able to inhibit macrophages activation and releasing transforming
  growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). Monocyte-derived MPs (MDMPs) are known to influence the
  activity of macrophages and monocytes by enhancing the expression of peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) protein. However, MDMPs also upregulated
  superoxide anion production on endothelial cells (ECs) and activation of nuclear
  factor κβ (NF-κβ) in monocytes that enhance microthrombosis. Most of the MPs, especially
  platelet-derived MPs (PDMPs) serve as precursor for microthrombus formation by providing
  catalytic surface for the prothrombinase enzyme complex (i.e., involving factors
  IXa/Va/VIII/Xa). PDMPs elicit the de novo expression and production of inflammatory
  molecule or agent such as cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and prostacyclin (PG12) that enable
  the monocytes-MPs-ECs aggregations through intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1)
  to further elevate the basement membrane (BM) degradation and formation of microclot.
  Once PDMPs had a close contact with neutrophil, it can bind and increase neutrophil
  aggregations and elevate neutrophil phagocytic activity. This is followed by an
  activation of ECs or GIT dysbiosis, as they released endothelial-derived MPs (EDMPs)
  and bacterial or microbiota-derived MPs that express proteases proteins such as
  MMP-9 and MMP-2 to enable the invasion toward vasculature through disruption of
  BM. Disrupted BM enables cellular or molecules transmigration or infiltration; for
  example, MPs bridging through BBB, may undergo reuptake by microglia from cerebral
  parenchyma. Alongside proinvasive MMP-9, EDMPs bring ultralarge von Willebrand factor
  (ULvWF) monomers that upregulate the platelet aggregations to ECs and hence activate
  the ECs and endothelium dysfunction. Moreover, activated protein C induced the synthesis
  and release of ECs–protein C receptor (EPCR)–derived MPs that bring functional and
  actively bound protein C to aid the inhibition of factor Va and factor VIIIa in
  the common pathway of coagulation cascade leading to thrombogenesis.
