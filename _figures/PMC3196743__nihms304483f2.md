caption: Preadipocyte differentiation requires the coordinated action of multiple
  transcription factors induced by hormones or their synthetic analogs. Pathways that
  are dispensable in vivo are represented by dashed lines. IBMX activates the cAMP
  signaling cascade resulting in induction of C/EBPβ expression in vitro. C/EBPδ expression
  is induced by dexamethasone in vitro and mediated through glucocorticoid receptor
  (GR). C/EBPβ forms homo/heterodimers with C/EBPδ and binds to the C/EBP regulatory
  region of C/EBPα and PPARγ, activating both transcription factors. C/EBPα, in a
  positive feedback loop, can further induce PPARγ. Furthermore, C/EBPβ activates
  the KLF5 promoter, which in turn activates the PPARγ promoter, in conjunction with
  C/EBPδ. SREBP1c, a transcription factor acting downstream of C/EBPβ, activates PPARγ
  upon insulin stimulation, possibly through endogenous PPARγ ligand production. Some
  evidence suggests that fetal bovine serum (FBS) stimulates the STAT5/GR pathway,
  which induces PPARγ expression, although its role in vivo is yet to be explored.
  Early B cell factor (EBF1) regulates C/EBPβ expression. Recently, ZFP423 was identified
  as a potent inducer of PPARγ2 and adipogenesis.
