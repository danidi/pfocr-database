caption: Schematics of frontal lobes and lateral ventricles in the anterior regions
  of the adult cerebrum. Genetic alterations in SVZ neural precursors in the RAS/ERK
  pathway induce a NEUROG2-ASCL1 switch that induces gliomagenesis (). The inability
  of IDH1R132H mutation to transform nestin-expressing NSCs, the high frequency of
  IDH1R132H mutation in oligodendroglioma (shown to originate from white matter OPCs),
  and the association of these tumors to the frontal cortex suggest that expression
  of IDH1R132H mutation in white matter (WM) progenitors inhibits differentiation
  and drive formation of proneural gliomas (, ). Similarly, childhood GBMs displaying
  G34R/V mutation in the H3F3A gene express high levels of FOXG1 and MYC, but low/no
  levels of the OPC-related gene OLIG2, implicating a NSC origin. Misexpression (activation/upregulation
  (*) or (loss) of important cancer genes is shown in black.
