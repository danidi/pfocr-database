caption: The contribution of TGF-β signaling to regulation of BCL-2 family members
  is included alongside known apoptosis pathways functional in germinal centres. The
  three separate apoptosis pathways converge to regulate death of human centroblasts.
  FAS signaling activates the extrinsic caspase-8/caspase-3 cascade while TGF-β signaling
  via its receptor complex represses the prosurvival factor BCL-XL and induces BIK
  to activate the intrinsic pathway. Fas and TGF-β signaling contribute to the default
  apoptotic state of ‘death by neglect’ while B cell receptor signaling also activates
  the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in cells lacking environmental survival cues.
  Loss of TGF-β signaling through inhibition of TGF-β receptor signaling by SB-431542
  would reduce the amount of caspase-3 activation and raise the threshold for apoptosis
  induction. The model highlights the requirement for maintenance of cFLIP and BCL-XL
  levels for cells to survive during germinal centre reactions.
