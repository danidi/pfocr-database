caption: (A,B) Relative abundances of the genes involved in (A) the HP/HB cycle (modified
  from Qin et al., ) and (B) the Calvin cycle between the sediment and seawater metagenomes
  of the Yap Trench. The pie chart of each gene indicates its relative proportion
  between the three sediment (yellow) and the three seawater (blue) metagenomes. (1),
  acetyl-CoA-propionyl-CoA carboxylase; (2), malonyl-CoA reductase (NADPH); (3), 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
  synthetase (ADP-forming); (4), 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase; (5), methylmalonyl-CoA
  epimerase; (6), methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; (7), 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming);
  (8), 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase; (9), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  (10), propanoyl-CoA C-acyltransferase. rbc, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase; pgk,
  phosphoglycerate kinase; gap, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; aldo/fba,
  fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; fbp/glp, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; tkt, transketolase;
  glpX-SEBP, sedoheptulose-bisphosphatase; rpi, ribose 5-phosphate isomerase; prk,
  phosphoribulokinase. The abundance of each gene is listed in Table . (C) Gene abundances
  involved in the microbial nitrogen cycle in the six metagenomes of the Yap Trench.
  nif, nitrogenase; gln, glutamine synthetase; ald, alanine dehydrogenase; ure, urease;
  A_amo, archaeal ammonia monooxygenase; B_amo, bacterial ammonia monooxygenase; hao,
  hydroxylamine oxidoreductase; nxr, nitrite oxidoreductase; nap, periplasmic nitrate
  reductase; nar, nitrate reductase; nir, nitrite reductase; nor, nitric oxide reductase;
  nos, nitrous oxide reductase; hdh, hydrazine dehydrogenase; hzs, hydrazine synthase;
  nrf, nitrite reductase. (D) The relative gene abundances between the sediment and
  seawater metagenomes as depicted by the width of solid lines. The yellow line indicates
  abundance higher in sediments, the blue line indicates higher in seawater, and the
  black line indicates no difference. The dashed line indicates little to no support
  for a pathway. The numbers/abbreviations in red indicate statistical significant
  between the three sediment and the three seawater metagenomes (P < 0.05).
