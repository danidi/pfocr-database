caption: ERRs are key transcriptional factors that regulate cellular energy metabolism.
  Through the control of vast transcriptional networks, the ERRs are master regulators
  of energy metabolism in the cell. Their target genes include several glucose transporters
  (SLC2A1, SLC2A2, SLC2A4, and SLC2A12, also known as GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT4, and GLUT12,
  respectively), most genes in the glycolysis pathway, and several genes that encode
  different LDH isoforms, which indicate the ERRs are key components in cellular glucose
  metabolism. By regulating the levels of key gatekeepers (such as PDK4), they also
  control the switch between glucose and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) by the mitochondria.
  ERRs are also essential for mitochondrial activity by targeting most genes in the
  TCA cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Recent results indicate that they
  also play a role in other metabolic functions of the cell, including amino acid
  and nucleotide synthesis and metabolism, which remain to be fully elucidated. Several
  examples of the regulated genes are provided for each function, which are based
  on microarray and ChIP-sequencing analysis in human cell lines and mouse models.
