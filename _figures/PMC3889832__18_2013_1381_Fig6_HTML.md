caption: Previous and revised model of the PARP pathway as a component of necroptosis.
  a In the previously established model, the PARP pathway represents an integral component
  of necroptosis. In this model, binding of TNF to TNF-R1 induces activation of RIP1/RIP3,
  and subsequently triggers a panel of effector mechanisms such as glycogenolysis,
  glutaminolysis, formation of ROS, lipid peroxidation, formation of ceramide, and
  mitochondrial dysfunction. As a central element, the overactivation of PARP-1 causes
  depletion of NAD+/ATP, activation of JNK, calpains and cathepsins, mitochondrio-nuclear
  translocation of AIF, chromatinolysis, and finally, necroptosis. b In the revised
  model suggested in this study, the PARP pathway is activated, e.g., in response
  to DNA damage and mediates programmed necrosis independently from TNF-induced necroptosis.
  Although RIP1 and RIP3 participate in both pathways, they fulfill nonredundant,
  independent functions and do not interconnect the two pathways
