caption: Cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) signaling-mediated immunity in type III CRISPR-Cas
  systems. (A) Domain organization of Cas10 and Csm6. Cas10 contains an N-terminal
  histidine-aspartate (HD) domain and two Palm domains (Palm1 and Palm2), and the
  GGDD motif is inserted into Palm2 domain. Csm6 contains an N-terminal CRISPR-associated
  Rossman fold (CARF) domain and a C-terminal higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding
  (HEPN) domain. (B) Model for cOA signaling pathway of type III systems. The Palm
  domains of Cas10 subunit are activated and convert ATP into cOA molecules, when
  the target RNA is recognized by the CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided effector complex.
  The synthesized cOA allosterically activates Csm6 by binding the CARF domain, which
  subsequently degrades RNA non-specifically, resulting in host cell dormancy or cell
  death. On the other hand, cOA nucleases including ring nuclease and membrane-associated
  DHH-DHHA1 family nuclease can degrade cOA molecules to switch off cOA signaling,
  thereby acting as off-switch for the systems.
