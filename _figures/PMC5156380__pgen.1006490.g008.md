number: Fig 8
caption: Diagram shows the N-assimilation pathway and enzyme subcellular localizations
  with the general pattern of expression of genes indicated. Compartments are labeled,
  and the chloroplast is shown with four membranes. NRT = nitrate transporter, NR
  = nitrate reductase, NOD = nitric oxide dioxygenase, FNT = formate-nitrite transporter,
  Fd-NIR = ferredoxin-dependent nitrite reductase, NIR = NADH-dependent nitrite reductase,
  GS(II/III) = glutamine synthetase, GOGAT = glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase,
  NMO = nitronate monooxygenase. See  for PIDs and normalized transcript abundance.
