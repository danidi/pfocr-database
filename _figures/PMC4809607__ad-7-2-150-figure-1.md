caption: Autophagy serves as an essential neuroprotective pathway in response to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and oxidative stress. In neurodegenerative diseases, AD, PD, and stroke,
  mitochondrial dysfunction accumulates due to aging, genetic abnormalities, environmental
  damage (such as pesticides), or neuroinflammation (which induces excessive production
  of nitric oxide, among others), resulting in decreased oxidative phosphorylation,
  and accumulation of mtDNA damage. There are also increases in protein damage, including
  protein oxidation and formation of HNE-protein adducts. Whether absolute levels
  of ROS are directly correlated with aging process is debatable. Emerging evidence
  indicated that transient or moderate ROS elevation may trigger response in ER stress
  and mitochondrial unfolded protein response pathways, as well as adaptations mediated
  by HIF, NRF2 and other transcription factor-regulated mechanisms (such as Apaf1
  and Caspase-9 dependent mitochondria to nuclear signaling). Therefore, a systemic
  decrease of ROS is unlikely to be the best approach to delay aging and age related
  neurodegeneration. Clearance of damaged proteins and organelles are dependent on
  the autophagy process, which involve double membrane vesicles encircling these damaged
  intracellular materials and sending them to be degraded. It has been hypothesized
  that dysfunction of autophagy promotes neurodegeneration and enhancement of autophagy
  may be neuroprotective.
