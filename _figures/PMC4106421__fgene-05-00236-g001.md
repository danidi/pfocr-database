caption: Schematic presentation of the spermatogenesis stages across the wall of a
  seminiferous tubule and the interrelations with ATM and ARF. (A) Spermatogonia are
  found in close proximity to the basement membrane of a seminiferous tubule. A subpopulation
  of spermatogonia exhibits stem cell ability and self-renews via mitotic divisions.
  ATM kinase is essential for their stemness (symbolized by a semicircular shape).
  Some of the spermatogonia eventually differentiate into primary spermatocytes. The
  latter, undergo meiosis to give rise to secondary spermatocytes which in turn, form
  spermatids (connected via cytoplasmic bridges). Spermatids engage a series of cytodifferentiative
  programs and sperm is finally formed. ARF expression in spermatogonia is required
  in order to prevent the occurrence of DNA damage in meiotic primary spermatocytes
  (at the stage of pachytene) through participating in a feed-forward program. (B)
  In the absence of ARF, genomic integrity in primary spermatocytes is threatened
  and the production of mature sperm released in the lumen is compromised. (C) Upon
  ATM deficiency, spermatogonia loose their genomic integrity and ARF undergoes upregulation.
  Consequently, an ARF-mediated p53/p21WAF1/Cip1 growth restrictive pathway counteracts
  spermatogonial stemness. Due to the fact that ATM deficiency hampers normal spermatocytic
  meiotic progression (at prophase I), sperm production is compromised (, ; ). The
  different subtypes of spermatogonial cells, Sertoli cells that support spermatogonia,
  stages and phases of meiosis, the different stages of spermatid differentiation
  as well as ploidy of cells are not shown here for reasons of simplicity (Colored
  lines depict ATM and/or ARF effects on spermatogenesis. Dashed colored lines denote
  weak effect or weak activation. Red lines represent adverse effect, while green
  ones correspond to physiologic functions).
