caption: Depicted are the five classes of p53-targeting therapeutics, i.e., genetherapeutic
  agents to delivery p53 via adenoviral transduction into p53-deficient cancer cells;
  anti-sense oligonucleotides targeting Mdm2; small molecules targeting wild-type
  p53 (i.e., compounds that liberate p53 from a inhibitory p53:Mdm24 complexes); small
  molecules targeting mutant p53 to restore its native conformation, and transactivational
  activity; and vaccination approaches (i.e., p53-SLP, a mixture of overlapping p53
  peptides representing amino acids 70 to 248 used in conjunction with montanide,
  a water in oil emulsions as adjuvant; INGN-225, a vaccine utilizing p53-peptide
  transfected dendritic cells; and ALT-801, an interleukin-2-T cell receptor fusion
  protein directed against MHC-presented p53 peptides). RITA, reactivation of p53
  and induction of tumor cell apoptosis; PRIMA, p53 reactivation and induction of
  massive apoptosis-1; MIRA-3, mutant p53 reactivation and induction of rapid apoptosis;
  STIMA, SH group targeting and induction of massive apoptosis; RETRA, reactivation
  of transcriptional reporter activity.
