caption: As shown in , activation of the β2AR induces bronchorelaxation (i.e. a beneficial
  effect) via its activation of the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway. In this Figure,
  parallel deleterious effects are highlighted whereby the activation of β2ARs are
  controlled by βarrestins. As shown in the left hand side pathway in this figure,
  following exposure to β2 agonists, β2ARs are phosphorylated by G Protein Coupled
  Receptor Kinases (GRKs) and rapidly desensitized meaning that regardless of continued
  β2 agonist presence, cAMP production is diminished. GRK regulates β2AR activity
  in part by uncoupling the β2AR from the Gα subunit of the G protein but also by
  promoting the binding of βarrestin molecules to the β2AR. βarrestin physically blocks
  further β2AR and Gα subunit interaction and hence further prevents the beneficial,
  pro-relaxant signalling pathway shown in  and also, in shortened form, on the right
  hand side of this diagram. However, the GRK- and βarrestin-mediated effects on cAMP
  signalling are not the only deleterious effects. βarrestin acts as a scaffold protein
  bringing together other molecules and initiating signalling via pathways not involving
  G-proteins for example the MAPK pathway.
