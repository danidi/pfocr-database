caption: 'Homocysteine metabolism is at the intersection of two main pathways: remethylation
  and trans-sulfuration. When the methionine level is low, homocysteine is remethylated
  into methionine; a process which requires vitamin B12 and folic acid as cofactors.
  Methionine then forms S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), which serves as the major methyl
  group donor in the cell. After demethylation, SAM generates S-adenosyl-homocysteine
  (SAH) and eventually is0 hydrolyzed back to homocysteine for a new cycle. When methionine
  levels are high, homocysteine, through the trans-sulfuration pathway, condenses
  with serine to form cystathionine, and subsequently cysteine in an irreversible
  reaction.'
