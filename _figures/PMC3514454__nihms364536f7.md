caption: High levels of Hcy induce ER stress to activate ATF6. Hcy also hydrolyzes
  to SAH, which decreases the methylation status of SP1 and ATF6 binding motifs on
  the sEH promoter, which facilitates both ATF6 and SP1 binding to the sEH promoter,
  and augments sEH expression. In turn, sEH upregulation hydrolyzes EETs and reduces
  the protective effect of EETs, which increases the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1
  and activates ECs.
