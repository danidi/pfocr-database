caption: A) To initiate mitotic entry, Cdc5 promotes expression of mitotic cyclin
  Clb2 and inactivates Swe1 kinase. Swe1 phosphorylates Cdk1 and prevents Cdk1 from
  interacting with Clb2. At G2/M, Swe1 gets phosphorylated by Cdc5. Hsl1/7 are required
  for efficient phosphorylation of Swe1 by Cdc5. This phosphorylation of Swe1 targets
  it for degradation. Mih1 dephosphorylates Cdk1 and allows Cdk1 to bind Clb2 and
  trigger entry into mitosis.B) In metaphase, Cdc5 phosphorylates cohesin kleisin
  subunit Scc1. This phosphorylation is antagonized by PP2ACdc55, which is down-regulated
  by Esp1 once the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) () has been satisfied. Esp1 cleaves
  phosphorylated Scc1, allowing sister chromatid separation.C) Mitotic exit in budding
  yeast is driven by Cdc14 phosphatase, which antagonizes Cdk1 activity. Prior to
  anaphase, Cdc14 is sequestered in the nucleolus, spatially separated from its nuclear
  and cytoplasmic substrates, by anchoring protein Net1/Cfi1. In early anaphase, phosphorylation
  of Net1/Cfi1 by Cdk1 and Cdc5 triggers the release of Cdc14 to the nucleus (FEAR).
  FEAR is also controlled by other components including Esp1, Slk19, and Spo12. The
  second mitotic exit pathway, the MEN, is triggered in the cytoplasm by the Tem1
  GTPase, which is negatively regulated by the Bfa1/Bub2 GAP and positively regulated
  by the Lte1 GEF. When Cdc14 is released from the nucleus by FEAR, it triggers the
  release of Cdc5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, Cdc5 activates
  the MEN by phosphorylating the Bfa1/Bub2 and Cdc15. MEN promotes the release of
  Cdc14 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, further driving mitotic exit.D) Cdc5 controls
  multiple aspects of cytokinesis. Cdc5 phosphorylates Rho1 GEFs Tus1 and Rom2, which
  promotes contractile actin ring (CAR) assembly. Cdc5 promotes the recruitment of
  F-BAR protein Hof1 to the bud neck to trigger CAR contraction. Cdc5 also promotes
  cell separation by inhibiting Cdc42 and regulates the cell size at the bud neck
  by preventing Sec4 from interacting with its effector protein Sec15.
