caption: 'Model of lncRNA regulation in sea buckthorn fruit. This pathway begins with
  the general phenylpropanoid metabolism, and subsequent steps are catalyzed by a
  series of structural enzymes, leading to the biosynthesis of flavonols and anthocyanins.
  The expression of the late biosynthetic genes (LBGs) requires the transcriptional
  activation activity of the R2R3-MYB/bHLH/WDR (MBW) complex. LncRNAs target FLS and
  CHS: functions in trans regulation. LncRNAs target F3H and F3′H: functions in cis
  regulation. CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavanone 3′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase.'
