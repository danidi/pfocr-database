caption: The summary and schematic diagram of this study. a STRING network analysis
  of GBE1 with CD8, PD-L1, CCL5, CXCL10, TMEM173, and IFNα/β pathway in the database.
  b Graphical abstract of this study. GBE1 blockade induces IFN-I production via STING
  signaling pathway, accompanied by upregulation of PD-L1 in LUAD cells, which further
  enhances the secretions of CCL5 and CXCL10 to recruit CD8+ T lymphocytes in the
  tumor microenvironment. Hence, suggesting that GBE1 may be a promising target to
  facilitate tumor rejection through cancer immunotherapy in LUAD
