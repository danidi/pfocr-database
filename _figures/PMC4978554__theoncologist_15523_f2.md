caption: 'PD-1 pathway inhibition. Tumor cells may activate an antitumor immune response
  by presenting tumor antigens in conjunction with MHC molecules to naïve T cells
  in the tumor microenvironment expressing the appropriate TCR (A). However, activated
  tumor-infiltrating T cells can express PD-1, and binding of PD-1 to its ligands,
  PD-L1 and PD-L2, on tumor cells can inhibit antitumor immune responses (B). PD-1/PD-L1
  blockade may remove this inhibitory signal and stimulate antitumor immunity (C).Abbreviations:
  MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1, programmed death-1; PD-L1, programmed
  death ligand-1; TCR, T-cell receptor.'
