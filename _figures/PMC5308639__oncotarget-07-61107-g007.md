caption: IL-6 binds to its receptor which then forms a complex with GP130. This leads
  to activation of JAK kinase, which in turn activates STAT3 and AKT (via the PI3K
  pathway). Phosphorylation of STAT3 leads to translocation of this molecule to the
  nucleus where it serves as a transcription factor and induces expression of E3 ubiquitin
  ligase MDM2. Similarly, IL-6-induced phosphorylation of AKT in HCT-116 (but not
  HT-1080) cells leads to increased expression of MDM2 levels. Furthermore, p-AKT
  induces the translocation of cytosolic MDM2 molecules to the nucleus. A primary
  target of MDM2 is p53; ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53 at the MMP-14
  promoter allows for transcription factor Sp1 to bind to the MMP-14 gene and increase
  its expression.
