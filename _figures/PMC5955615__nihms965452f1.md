caption: Inhibition of the dysregulated NF-kB/YY1/Snail loop. This figure represents
  the hyperactivated NF-κB pathway and downstream overexpression of YY1 and Snail
  that lead to the EMT phenotype. Treatment of cancer cells with various inhibitors
  of YY1 results in the reversal of the EMT phenotype.
