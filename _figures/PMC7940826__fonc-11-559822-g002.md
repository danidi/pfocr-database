caption: HIF interaction and degradation pathway in normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
  The level of HIF-α is maintained by the recognition of the von-Hippel Lindau tumor
  suppressor (pVHL) to the hydroxylated HIF-α subunit for ubiquitylation and subsequently
  proteasomal degradation under normoxic. Under low oxygen level, untargeted HIF-α
  subunits accumulate and translocate to the nucleus. Once inside, dimerization of
  HIF-α with HIF-1β and its co-activators p300/CBP activate the target genes transcription
  ().
