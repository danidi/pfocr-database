caption: In the normal state blood glucose levels are maintained in homeostasis through
  the actions of insulin, which stimulates glucose uptake and glycogen storage thereby
  keeping the system balanced. Changes in blood glucose levels (such as increases
  upon eating) stimulate commensurate changes in insulin release which drive either
  increased glucose uptake (when insulin levels are high) or gluconeogenesis (when
  insulin levels are low). When PI3K inhibitors are used they perturb insulin signaling
  in cells, thereby pushing the systemic balance to favor glucose release. This causes
  blood glucose levels to acutely increase, which in turn signals to the pancreas
  to release a bolus of insulin. As indicated by the cartoon these high insulin levels
  have the potential to reactivate insulin signaling both in metabolic tissues, which
  is critical in order for the system to come back to homeostasis, as well as in tumors,
  where insulin has the potential to reactivate PI3K signaling thereby undercutting
  the efficacy of the PI3K inhibitors.
