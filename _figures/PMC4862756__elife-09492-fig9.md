caption: 'Evolution can replace components in an essential pathway by proceeding through
  a hybrid intermediate. Once established, the hybrid network can evolve dramatically
  and lose previously essential regulators, while sometimes retaining the original
  network topology. We hypothesize that SBF may have hijacked the cell cycle of a
  fungal ancestor by binding cis-regulatory DNA sites of E2F and activating expression
  of G1/S genes, thus promoting cell cycle entry. Cell cycle hijacking in a fungal
  ancestor was followed by evolution of Whi5 to inhibit SBF and Whi5 was subsequently
  entrained to upstream cell cycle control through phospho-regulation by old or new
  cyclin-CDKs to create a hybrid network with parallel pathways. The hybrid network
  likely provided redundant control of the G1/S regulatory network, which could explain
  the eventual loss of E2F and its replacement by the SBF pathway in more derived
  fungi (Dikarya). Interestingly, zoosporic fungi such as Chytrids have hybrid networks
  and are transitional species because they exhibit animal-like features of the opisthokont
  ancestor (centrioles, flagella) and fungal-like features (cell wall, hyphal growth).
  We hypothesize that E2F and SBF also bind and regulate a subset of animal-specific
  and fungal-specific G1/S genes, which could help explain the preservation of the
  hybrid network in Chytrids. Ancestral SBF expanded to create an entire family of
  transcription factors (APSES) that regulate fungal-specific traits such as sporulation,
  differentiation, morphogenesis, and virulence.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09492.032'
