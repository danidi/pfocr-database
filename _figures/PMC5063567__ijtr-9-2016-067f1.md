caption: 'A schematic representation of the key enzymes and metabolites in the kynurenine
  pathway.Notes: The essential amino acid Trp is consumed via the diet and undergoes
  catabolism in the digestive tract. Besides its important role in protein synthesis
  and in serotonin production, Trp is catabolized in various body systems including
  in the colon by Lactobacilli, and in immune-privileged sites by multiple enzymes,
  to produce various metabolites. IDO1, IDO2, and TDO are the first rate-limiting
  enzymes involved in Trp catabolism and produce downstream metabolites collectively
  referred to as the kynurenines. Since the overproduction of Kyn and its ligation
  to AhR induce immunosuppressive cells, Kyn is an important therapeutic target. Serotonin,
  quinolinic acid, and kynurenic acid are Trp metabolites with important roles in
  normal brain function and in mood disorders. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is
  an important cellular cofactor produced during Trp catabolism.Abbreviations: AhR,
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor; GCN2, general control nonderepressible 2; IDO, indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase; KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; Teff, effector T cell; Treg,
  regulatory T cell; TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; Trp, tryptophan.'
