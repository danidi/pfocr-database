caption: The canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis and the mechanisms of miRNA controlled
  posttranscriptional gene regulation. The miRNA coding sequences are transcribed
  by RNA polymerase II to pri-miRNAs in the nucleus, which are then processed by the
  Drosha-DGCR8 complex to pre-miRNAs. Exportin 5 transports pre-miRNAs into cytoplasm,
  where pre-miRNAs are further processed by the Dicer-TRBP complex to double-stranded
  miRNAs. The miRNA duplexes are subsequently unwound, and the single-stranded mature
  miRNAs are loaded into argonaute 2-containing miRISCs. As discussed in the main
  text, some miRNAs may be generated through a number of different noncanonical pathways.
  By pairing to the MREs that usually occur within the 3′UTRs of target mRNAs, miRNAs
  mediate translational repression or mRNA degradation, which both may lead to lower
  levels of protein expression.
