caption: Hypothesis of insulin signaling pathways associated with the regulation of
  CIDEA and CIDEC expression in human adipocytes. The regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC
  expression by insulin is mediated by PI3K signaling. However, the insulin signaling
  pathway involved in the regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC diverges into different pathways
  downstream of PI3K. Akt1/2 mediates insulin-induced downregulation of CIDEA, whereas
  JNK2 mediates insulin-induced upregulation of CIDEC. The insulin regulation of CIDEA
  and CIDEC via different signaling pathways would contribute separately to insulin-induced
  anti-apoptosis and lipid droplet formation in human adipocytes.
