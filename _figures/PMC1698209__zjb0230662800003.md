caption: Model-based evaluation of experimentally essential genes involved in cofactor
  biosynthesis. The map shows the metabolic pathways involved in vitamin and cofactor
  metabolism, where biosynthesis proceeds in the downward direction and the end products
  are indicated below each pathway. Red and blue arrows are used to indicate reactions
  associated with experimentally identified essential genes in glycerol minimal medium
  and rich medium (), respectively. Gray lines indicate cases in which the gene(s)
  associated with the corresponding reaction was experimentally nonessential. Only
  the experimentally essential genes are listed next to the corresponding reactions.
  “&” indicates that the genes form a complex. For pathways containing essential genes,
  a “No Gene” designation is placed next to reactions that lack a corresponding gene
  assignment. Gene names listed in black indicate discrepancies between the model
  predictions and experimental data (i.e., the model predicts a nonlethal phenotype
  for growth on glycerol minimal medium but the gene deletion is lethal experimentally),
  and genes in gray indicate agreement (both model and data predict essentiality).
  Genes in black next to gray reactions (coaA, coaE, aldA, and pabC) indicate that
  the model predicts that a gene deletion is essential whereas the corresponding mutant
  strain is viable. Note that unlabeled gray reactions also represent agreement of
  the model prediction and experimental data, as both find the associated gene(s)
  to be nonessential.
