caption: 'Schematic summary of HIF-1 signaling in hypoxia and diabetes. Under normoxia,
  glucose is metabolized to pyruvate and then the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts
  pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle, and NADH and FADH2 are generated.
  Electrons derived from NADH and FADH2 are utilized by the electron transport chain
  to generate ATP. Under hypoxia, HIF-1 activates glycolytic genes as a critical step
  of metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1 induces anaerobic glycolysis by mediating
  the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), which inhibits pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) and induces conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Under diabetes,
  metabolic stress is induced by: an increased ratio of NADH/NAD+ due to an increased
  flux of glucose through the polyol pathway resulting in pseudohypoxia; increased
  expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which induces
  fatty acid utilization and oxidation; increased fatty acid oxidation leading to
  the production of acetyl-CoA; increased production of advanced glycation end products
  (AGE), which leads to the irreversible modification of proteins; induction of the
  carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP); and increased ROS production.
  The production of ROS is induced by oxidative stress due to the increased ratio
  of NADH/NAD+, and by AGE via signaling through its receptor (RAGE). ROS, ChREBP,
  and pseudohypoxia induce transcription of Hif1a mRNA. However, in the diabetic environment,
  HIF-1 signaling is negatively affected via modification of its coactivator p300,
  and by HIF-1α protein modifications.'
