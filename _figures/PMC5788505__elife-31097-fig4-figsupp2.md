caption: (A) Genomic context of L-gulonate, D-glucuronate, and L-galactonate utilization
  genes and regulons in 45 bacteria from the Pasteurellales lineage. The L-gulonate
  catabolic pathway from H. influenzae Rd KW20 was projected onto the pathogenic gammaproteobacteria,
  using the subsystems approach in the SEED genomic platform (). Analysis of the adjacent
  metabolic pathways for use of hexuronates (D-glucuronate, D-galacturonate) and another
  6-carbon aldonic acid (L-galactonate) revealed that the signature enzymes for the
  L-gulonate and the D-glucuronate (GlcA) pathways are the L-gulonate dehydrogenase;
  the GulD and the GlcA isomerases; and UxaC, respectively. Predicted sugar utilization
  phenotypes are given in parentheses. Among 21 analyzed strains of H. influenzae,
  17 strains possess the uronate catabolic genes. Genes with the same functional roles
  are marked in matching colors. Pairwise similarity between orthologs in different
  H. influenzae strains is highlighted by light green (>95% protein identity), yellow
  (>50%), and pink (<50%). Tripartite TRAP transporters are shown by magenta arrows.
  Experimentally defined specificities of TRAP SBPs are indicated for gulP/uxuP/lgoP

  in red and their locus tags are given below. Transcriptional regulators are shown
  by black arrows. Predicted DNA-binding sites of GulR and UxuR regulators are shown
  by black pins, and their common DNA motif is shown as a logo. For reconstruction
  of UxaR and GulR regulons, we used an established comparative genomics approach,
  based on identification of candidate regulator-binding sites using RegPredict tool
  (). LGul pathway gene organization is conserved in 8 out of 21 hr. influenza strains
  into a single genetic locus containing two divergently transcribed operons, gulD-gulPQM-kdgK-uxuB-kdgA
  and gulR-uxuA, that are controlled by candidate GulR-binding sites in their common
  promoter region. Glucuronide hydrolases from different families are shown by white
