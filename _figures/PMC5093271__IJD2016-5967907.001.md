caption: 'Relationship between the metabolism of xylitol and glycolysis in humans.
  The scheme describes the metabolism of dietary xylitol in broad outline only. The
  body receives energy from glycolysis (the thick horizontal arrow). The first intermediate
  of glycolysis is glucose 6-phosphate which forms an important link between glycolysis
  and another metabolic pathway, called the pentose phosphate shunt, or pentose phosphate
  cycle (curved arrow). The thinner black arrow represents the glucuronate-xylulose
  cycle of Touster. The differences in the thickness of the arrows reflect the relative
  portion of these three pathways in the overall metabolism. Although the significance
  of the Touster cycle is minor from the energetic point of view, it is nevertheless
  absolutely necessary for body functions. Pyruvic acid which may be regarded as the
  end product of glycolysis can be further metabolized in two ways: reduction to lactic
  acid under conditions of limited oxygen supply, or becoming a part of coenzyme A
  when the oxygen supply is sufficient. The scheme shows how xylitol can contribute
  to the overall energy metabolism of the body. The original scheme of Bässler []
  was modified and completed by the present author.'
