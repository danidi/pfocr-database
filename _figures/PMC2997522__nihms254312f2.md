caption: Novel therapeutic strategies against aggressive and recurrent epithelial
  cancers by molecular targeting distinct signaling pathways and multidrug resistance-associated
  molecules involved in aggressive behavior and resistance phenotype of tumorigenic
  and migrating cancer stem/progenitor cells. The anti-carcinogenic effects induced
  by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against CD133 or CD44 stem cell-like marker
  or Wingless (Wnt) ligand of Wnt/β-catenin tumorigenic pathway are shown. Moreover,
  the cytotoxic effects induced by diverse pharmacological agents such as the selective
  inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity “gefitinib or erlotinib”,
  smoothened (SMO) hedgehog signaling element “cyclopamine or IPI-269609”, CXC chemokine
  receptor 4 (CXCR4) “AMD3100” on cancer stem/progenitor cell behavior are indicated.
  Particularly, the anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, anti-metastatic and/or apoptotic
  effects induced by these pharmacological agents in cancer stem/progenitor cells
  through down-regulation of expression levels of numerous gene products are indicated.
  In addition, the potent inhibitory effect mediated by a mAb or specific inhibitor
  of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporter on drug efflux and aldehyde
  dehydrogenase (ALDH) “diethylaminobenzaldehyde, DEAB” on drug metabolism concomitant
  with intracellular drug accumulation and decreased drug resistance is also illustrated.
