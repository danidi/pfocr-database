caption: Fig. 1. Possible models for the role of plasmin in the development of Alzheimer’s
  disease. In unaffected individuals (left), plasmin influences the balance of α and
  β pathway activity by stimulating the α pathway () and degrading Aβ. Aβ, in turn,
  induces the plasmin system in a feedback mechanism (; ; ). In individuals with Alzheimer’s
  disease (right), reduced plasmin in neuronal rafts shifts the proteolytic balance
  towards the β pathway, leading to increased Aβ production and plaque formation (Model
  1) (). Alternatively, Aβ deposition may trigger inflammation, which induces inhibitors
  of the plasmin system, downregulating degradation and clearance of Aβ (Model 2)
  ().
