caption: A working model for the redox-mediated regulation of crhR expression. The
  model incorporates known elements from mustard chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. crhR
  expression is dynamically established by a complex interaction between redox-regulated
  transcription and mRNA stability. Reduction of electron carriers between QA in PSII
  and QO in cyt b6f in the thylakoid membrane can either be accomplished naturally
  by light harvesting or by the metabolism of exogenously supplied Glc. Data presented
  here implicate interaction of plastoquinol with cyt b6f as the environmental sensor
  that rapidly activates crhR expression at the transcriptional level, potentially
  by signaling through the signal transduction pathway known to initiate photosystem
  state transitions. Reduced plastoquinone has been reported to regulate directly
  the transcription of two chloroplast-encoded genes whose protein products are required
  to maintain photosynthetic electron flow. Accumulation of crhR mRNA is also regulated
  by a redox-regulated, but Glc metabolism-independent, mechanism. Redox regulation
  of transcription and mRNA stability provides a mechanism by which the cells could
  rapidly respond to alterations in redox conditions. The specificity of the redox
  regulation of crhR expression raises the intriguing possibility that CrhR-catalyzed
  RNA unwinding may be required for the efficient translation of its own and possibly
  other redox-regulated mRNAs.

  description: A working model for the redox-mediated regulation of crhR expression.
    The model incorporates known elements from mustard chloroplasts and cyanobacteria.
    crhR expression is dynamically established by a complex interaction between redox-regulated
    transcription and mRNA stability. Reduction of electron carriers between QA in
    PSII and QO in cyt b6f in the thylakoid membrane can either be accomplished naturally

    Redox regulation of transcription and mRNA stability provides a mechanism by which
    the cells could rapidly respond to alterations in redox conditions. The specificity
