caption: DHA, NPD1, and βAPP-derived Aβ peptide signaling circuits in homeostatic
  aging and in AD. DHA and NPD1 act as PLA2- and 15-LOX-mediated neuroprotectants
  in the βAPP-sAPPα-Aβ peptide signaling pathway. Free DHA is liberated from membrane-bound
  stores via the action of a highly regulated membrane-associated PLA2 that may be
  subsequently converted into a potent neurotrophic NPD1 through an enzyme-mediated
  lipoxygenation via 15-LOX-1 or 15-LOX-like activities. NPD1 has been shown to convey
  multiple neuroprotective effects including induction of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins,
  inhibition in the expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and suppression of
  inflammatory gene expression. Various ROS are more abundant in AD than in control
  brain, suggesting a possible role for oxidation-related decrease in protein function
  in processes such as depletion of the cellular redox balance, loss of specific protein
  function, interference with the cell cycle, and abnormal clearance of proteins and
  neurodegeneration leading ultimately to neuronal death. Nonenzymatic oxidation of
  free DHA results in the formation of neuroprostanes, a class of peroxidized lipids
  that further support oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and apoptosis. Nonenzymatic
  reactions may be quenched by specific antioxidants and free radical scavengers,
  indicating that the redox state of brain cells has bearing on neurotrophic or oxidative-neurotoxic
  pathways for DHA. Enriched within neuronal plasma and endoplasmic membranes, the
  integral βAPP gives rise to sAPPα via an α-secretase/ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)
  10-mediated pathway that is nonamyloidogenic and neurotrophic and whose synthesis
  is supported by free DHA and NPD1 (upper pathways). The βAPP membrane-integral sorting
  receptor sortilin-1 (SORL1), when proximal to βAPP, has direct effects on βAPP trafficking,
  and decreased abundance of SORL1, or βAPP-SORL1 dissociation, is coupled to activation
  of the amyloidogenic pathway from βAPP and the increased generation and secretion
  of Aβ peptides (lower pathways) (–). SORL-1 further interacts with the type E apolipoprotein
  (ApoE), a major biolipid and cholesterol transporter in the brain, and the interaction
  of βAPP and ApoE within cholesterol-enriched lipid raft membrane domains, especially
  in the absence of SORL-1, gives rise to an increased generation of Aβ peptides via
  stimulation of β-amyloid cleavage enzyme (BACE) and presenilin 1 (PS1). The tandem
  actions of BACE and PS1 are sometimes referred to as the β-γ-secretase signaling
  pathway, an integral component of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, and known to contribute
  to Aβ peptide accumulation, neuropathology, and neurodegeneration. Aβ peptides bind
  directly to ApoE and cholesterol, and both Aβ peptides and βAPP oxidize ApoE-cholesterol
  to form the proapoptotic neurotoxic oxysterol 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-HC) or 24S
  hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC) via the action of CYP46A1 (–). 24S-HC, highly enriched
  in the human CNS, is membrane permeable and is associated with amyloidogenesis and
  AD pathology (). The actions of DHA or NPD1 on CYP46A1 and oxidation of cholesterol
  to 7β-HC or 24S-HC are not well understood. Current and emerging pharmaceutical
  strategies aim at the modulation of secretase activities through the actions of
  SALA to favor the more neurotrophic βAPP-cleavage signaling pathways (upper pathways)
  over the neurotoxic, amyloidogenic BACE-PS1 β-γ-secretase pathways (lower pathways;
  50). The therapeutic use of statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase
  inhibitors, that lower serum cholesterol has also been shown to reduce Aβ peptide
  abundance in in vitro models of AD using human brain cell primary cultures and in
  some clinical trials, and large phase III studies are currently in progress (–).
  The interactions of DHA and NPD1 with SALA drugs or statins are not well understood;
  however, early clinical trials using DHA and antioxidants together as enhancers
  of cognition in aged patients showed synergistic beneficial effects (,,).
