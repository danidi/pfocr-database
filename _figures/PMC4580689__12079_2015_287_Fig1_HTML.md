caption: General NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activation. Following a stimulus to the
  macrophage cell, the inflammasome complex transfers into an active state. The adaptor
  ASC is then phosphorylated by the inflammatory kinases Syk and Jnk, leading to the
  activation of pro-caspase 1. Activated pro-caspase 1 leads to the activation of
  IL-1beta and IL-18, both of which cause downstream inflammation after being detected
  by other cells. This is a key major process in the general innate immune response
  pathway
