caption: Tubular basis of the salt paradox in the early diabetic kidney. (A) In classical
  physiology, renal function and total body NaCl are linked by several parallel feedback
  loops. Paths from dietary NaCl to GFR and renal blood flow (RBF) are highlighted
  (black arrows). Each highlighted path contains only “+” signs or an even number
  of “−” signs, indicating a positive influence of dietary NaCl on GFR and RBF. Interfering
  with these processes can alter the strength of this influence, but cannot make it
  paradoxical. (B) Incorporating tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) provides a pathway
  whereby dietary NaCl can inversely impact GFR and RBF via a primary change in proximal
  (i.e., upstream to macula densa) reabsorption (note the odd number of “−” signs
  along the dotted path). Thus, GFR and RBF are subject to competing influences in
  response to changes in dietary NaCl. The NaCl paradox arises when TGF prevails.
