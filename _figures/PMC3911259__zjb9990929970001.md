caption: 'Anaerobic metabolic pathway of phenylalanine to benzoyl-CoA in A. aromaticum
  and proposed aor operon. Enzymes, corresponding genes, and notes: Pat, phenylalanine
  aminotransferase (ebA596); Pdc, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (ebA6545); AOR, phenylacetaldehyde:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase (ebA5005; 49% identity with AOR from Pyrococcus furiosus []), and
  PDH, phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ebA4954); Fd, ferredoxin (ebA5004), and ferredoxin:NADH
  oxidoreductase (ebA5007), which may recycle ferredoxin to its oxidized state, are
  encoded in a common operon with AOR (connected by broken lines); PadJ, phenylacetate-CoA
  ligase (ebA5402); PadBCD, phenylacetyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase (ebA5393, ebA5395,
  ebA5396); PadEFGHI, phenylglyoxylate:acceptor oxidoreductase (ebA5397, ebB191, ebA5399
  to ebA5401). A newly identified gene (ebA5008) coding for a MoaD-like protein involved
  in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is present at the 3′ flank of ebA5007. Gene
  ebA5010, coding for a hypothetical protein (hyp.), was reannotated as a shortened
  version with a different translation start site.'
