caption: Hypothetical model of differential phosphorylation of YBX1 on Ser-176 and
  Ser-165 and their role in NF-κB activation. A, prediction of the phosphorylation
  site by CKI on YBX1 at Ser-176 using the Human Protein Reference Database. B, top
  panel, Western blot showing that CKI protein was successfully knocked down with
  a pool of shCKI constructs in 293 stable cells containing FLAG-WT-YBX1 (cell line
  from A). Bottom panel, co-immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment and Western blot showing
  that, using the above cells, FLAG-tagged WT-YBX1 was pulled down with anti-FLAG
  beads and then probed with anti-phospho-serine antibody. shCKI cells showed dramatically
  reduced serine phosphorylation on FLAG-WT-YBX1 upon IL-1β treatment compared with
  control cells. IB, immunoblot. C, hypothetical model showing that, in the presence
  of stimuli of the NF-κB pathway such as IL-1β, IκB kinase phosphorylates IκBα, causing
  degradation of IκB. The free p65/p50 heterodimer then migrates to the nucleus to
  bind to κB-binding sites on the promoters of specific genes, leading to their activation.
  While this is occurring, IL-1β can also stimulate YBX1 by activating CKI, which
  then leads to phosphorylation of YBX1 on Ser-176, and by activating CKII, which
  can promote phosphorylation of YBX1 on Ser-165 (). These two different phosphorylation
  events either regulate some common pool of NF-κB-inducible genes or independently
  regulates quite distinct subgroups of NF-κB-inducible genes, leading to plasticity
  of NF-κB-driven biological functions.
