caption: Nitric Oxide (NO) produced by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) stimulates soluble
  guanylate cyclase (sGC) to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which
  activates protein kinase G (PKG). Inorganic nitrate/nitrite, sGC stimulators and
  phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitors target this pathway. The natriuretic peptides
  ANP and BNP attach to the natriuretic peptide receptors A/B (NPRA/NPRB). This stimulates
  receptor guanylate cyclase (rGC) to produce cGMP, which again activates PKG. Neprilysin
  inhibitors such as sacubitril and PDE9 inhibitors act through this pathway.
