caption: 'Simplified schematic of Notch signaling.Notes: In mammalian cells, Notch
  receptors are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During their transit
  from the ER to the trans-Golgi apparatus, Notch receptors are glycosylated and,
  in the trans-Golgi, cleaved by a furin convertase at site S1. This results in the
  generation of heterodimeric receptors, which are presented on the plasma membrane,
  with NotchEC fully exposed to the extracellular space. A neighboring, signaling
  cell expresses Notch ligands. Upon receptor–ligand interaction, NotchEC is removed
  along with the ligand via a trans-endocytosis event in the signaling cell. The removal
  of the inhibitory NotchEC renders Notch™ (composed by a short extracellular stump,
  a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal, intracellular portion known as NotchIC)
  susceptible to cleavage operated by ADAM 10 or 17 (or both) at site S2 within the
  “extracellular stump” of Notch™. S2-cleaved Notch is rapidly cleaved within its
  transmembrane domain by a γ-secretase complex, either on the plasma membrane or
  within endocytic vesicles at S3. This latter event releases NotchIC, which translocates
  into the nucleus, associates with CBF-1, and transforms the composition of CBF-1-associated
  co-factors to yield a transcriptional activator complex in place of a transcriptional
  repressor complex on a number of promoters. Only a subset of Notch-regulated genes
  is presented here. This is the so-called canonical Notch signaling pathway. Recently,
  Notch has been described to activate a number of cellular signaling pathway independently
  from its association to CBF-1 and transcription regulation with only a subset presented
  here. This has been dubbed “non-canonical” Notch signaling, which can take place
  even independently of γ-secretase cleavage of Notch™. Both canonical and non-canonical
  Notch signaling have been linked to carcinogenesis.Abbreviations: ADAM, A-disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; mTOR, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; MamL, Mastermind-like.'
