caption: The regulation of nitric oxide after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Schematic demonstrating
  the production of NO from its precursors and its significance in SAH. Solid arrows
  depict positive regulatory steps. Dotted, gray arrows depict negative regulatory
  steps. (a) NO stimulation down the cGMP-mediated signaling pathway is critical for
  vasodilation and maintenance of cerebral blood flow. All NO donor strategies outlined
  in the text are intended to stimulate this final common pathway. (b) The three forms
  of nitric oxide synthases play critical roles in the pathogenesis of SAH and vasospasm.
  iNOS and eNOS activity are upregulated after SAH. Primate models suggest that nNOS
  levels decrease after SAH and may precipitate the development of vasospasm, potentially
  due to Hb-mediated oxidative damage. (c) Classical evidence suggests that NO is
  scavenged by the Hb that is released into the CSF after SAH-induced vascular injury,
  as a potential mechanism underlying vasospastic collapse. Hb also may trigger the
  production of the protein ADMA, an endogenous inhibitor of NOS that is hypothesized
  to play a major role in vasospasm. (d) NO is metabolized into nitrite (NO2) and
  nitrate (NO3), which serve as indirect measurements of NO in clinical and animal
  models. New evidence suggest that nitrite can be metabolized back into NO by hemoglobin
  in its deoxygenated form, leading to promising investigations regarding nitrite
  donors for treatment of SAH. (e) Recent investigations, based to a large extent
  on animal models, focus on the potential role of eNOS uncoupling in the pathogenesis
  of vasospasm. eNOS uncoupling occurs after SAH, through a mechanism that may stem
  from binding by ADMA, micronutrient deficiency, presence of superoxide, or lack
  of the substrate arginine. The eNOS-catalyzed formation of peroxynitrite from NO
  and reactive oxygen species may contribute to the development of delayed neurologic
  damage after SAH.
