caption: Proposed schematic representation of how CX3CL1 induces microvascular barrier
  disruption in the spine. The vertebral spongy bone is rich in CX3CL1. CX3CL1 induces
  activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway in VMECs, which further
  induces the F-actin formation and ZO-1 disruption in ECs and subsequent microvascular
  barrier disruption, resulting in exacerbation of tumor cells TEM in the spine.
