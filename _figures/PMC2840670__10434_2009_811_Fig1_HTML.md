caption: K-ras mutation governs the effects of inhibition of epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) on the Ras/Raf/Mek signaling pathway. a The ligands epidermal growth
  factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-α activate EGFR signaling leading
  to phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain. K-Ras adopts a guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP) bound conformation and through a series of phosphorelays activates ERK. Activation
  of ERK leads to transcription of genes associated with cell proliferation, survival,
  and metastasis. b Inhibition of EGFR by the EGFR-I panitumumab or cetuximab leads
  to K-ras becoming guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound, which inhibits downstream signaling.
  c When K-ras is mutated, it adopts a constitutively GTP bound conformation leading
  to activation of the Ras/Raf/Mek pathway in the presence of inhibition of EGFR.
