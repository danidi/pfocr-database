caption: Diagram showing the fundamental steps and P450 enzymes involved in vitamin
  D biosynthesis and degradation pathway. Cholecalciferol (D3) is converted via two
  steps to make the potent active ligand for vitamin D receptor (VDR). CYP24A1 participates
  in degradation (at two possible steps), the CYP24A1 gene being activated when Ca2+
  levels are sufficient and thus less VDR action is needed.
