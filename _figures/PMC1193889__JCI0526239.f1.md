caption: Paracrine actions of PTHrP in bone. Osteoblast progenitors in bone and bone
  marrow produce PTHrP that acts through PTHR1 on committed preosteoblasts to enhance
  their differentiation to mature, matrix-producing osteoblasts. The second major
  effect related to stimulation of bone formation is the action of PTHrP on both mature
  osteoblasts and osteocytes to reduce apoptosis. For PTHrP to generate an anabolic
  response, it needs to be presented to its targets transiently (–). The effect of
  PTHrP on the bone resorption pathway is depicted, with PTHrP acting through PTHR1
  on cells of the osteoblast lineage, which respond with increased production of RANKL.
  This requires more prolonged stimulation by PTHrP (, ), and the location of these
  responsive cells is such that RANKL can interact with its receptor, RANK, on hemopoietic
  precursors to promote increased osteoclast formation and activity. In each of its
  local actions the potential exists for other biological activities of PTHrP to be
  exerted on its target cells.
