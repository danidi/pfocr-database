caption: Analysis of the interconnection between AKAP12 and the merged networks of
  related joint diseases and functions. The 434 differentially expressed genes identified
  in normal and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) osteoblasts were analyzed by the IPA to
  be categorized into 25 networks. Diseases and functions related to joint destruction
  in RA microenvironment, including inflammation of joint, chemotaxis, damage of connective
  tissue, migration of connective tissue cells, proliferation of osteoblasts, and
  neovascularization were selected to identify related genes. AKAP12, one of the genes
  involved in chemotaxis, was connected to HGF and ARRB1, molecules involved in damage
  of connective tissue and neovascularization. In addition, the overlay canonical
  pathway analysis indicated AKAP12, MAP3K1, VASP, PTK2B, TGFB2, ITPR3, and NFATC1
  (marked in light blue) to be involved in the protein kinase A signaling, and participated
  in various indicated networks.
