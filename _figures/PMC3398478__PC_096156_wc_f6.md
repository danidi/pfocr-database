caption: The Pathogenicity Pathway from M. oryzae.Following sensing of host signals,
  the pathogenicity pathway is activated. Components mediating early steps of signal
  transduction converge toward a protein complex comprising Mst50 and MAPK signaling
  components. Following activation by Ste7, the Kss1 MAPK stimulates differentiation
  of appressoria and controls formation of turgor pressure. Nuclear localization of
  Kss1 is consistent with the fact that TFs accomplish MAPK function. Study of Mst12
  indicates that IRM and infectious growth are separated processes, both required
  for full pathogenicity. Mst12 is not involved in appressorium formation but functions
  downstream of Kss1 to control penetration peg formation and proliferation inside
  host tissues. Sfl1 is another MAPK substrate regulating expression of stress-related
  genes. In light of this study, previous MAPK names are depicted in parentheses.
  This figure has been adapted from . AP, appressorium; CO, conidia; CU, cuticule;
  IH, infection hyphae; N, nucleus; PC, plant cell; PP, penetration peg.
