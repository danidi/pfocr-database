caption: Construction of T. gondii G10E-CS vaccine and potential immune mechanism
  involved in vaccination with G10E-CS in vivo. In this study, dominant B cell, CD8+
  and CD4+ T cell epitopes from GRA10 protein of T. gondii were selected by bioinformatics
  and immunological analysis. Then the G10E-CS microsphere vaccine formed by three
  dominant epitopes and linked by sequence GS was loaded onto chitosan microspheres
  by emulsion cross-linking method. When BALB/c mice were immunized with G10E-CS,
  the G10E peptides released from the microspheres induced specific humoral and cellular
  response. At the same time, chitosan as an attractive adjuvant could induce activation
  of dendritic cells (DCs) via cGAS-STING signaling pathway and then promote T helper
  1 (Th1) cellular immune responses.
