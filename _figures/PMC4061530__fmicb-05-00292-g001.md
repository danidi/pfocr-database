caption: 'Schematic representation of the ribonuclease activity of IRE1 and RNaseL
  showing cross-talk between the paths catalysed by the enzymes. The figure shows
  activation of RNase activity following dimerization triggered by either accumulation
  of unfolded proteins in the ER-lumen or synthesis of 2–5A by the enzyme OAS, respectively,
  for IRE1 and RNaseL. The cleavage of Xbp1u by IRE1 releases an intron thus generating
  Xbp1s. The IRE1 targets in RIDD pathway or all RNaseL substrates are shown to undergo
  degradative cleavage. The cleavage products generated through degradation of the
  respective substrate is shown to potentially interact with RIG-I thereby leading
  to Interferon secretion and trans-activation of Oas genes through Interferon signaling.
  Abbreviations: RIG-I = retinoic acid inducible gene-I, Ifnb = interferon beta gene
  loci, IFN = interferons, ISG = interferon-sensitive genes, 2–5A = 2′–5′ oligoadenylates.'
