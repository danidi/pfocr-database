caption: WAVE2 complex regulates fetal liver HSC mobilization into the bone marrow
  by modulating c-Abl signaling. Loss of Hem1 leads to degradation of WAVE2 complex
  without affecting actin polymerization in fetal liver HSCs. Lodgment of fetal liver
  HSCs into the bone marrow is impaired under Hem1 mutation, which is related to inhibiting
  c-Abl signaling pathway activation with decreasing phosphorylated CrkL (pCrkL).
