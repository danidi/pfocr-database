caption: The figure shows a model for the life cycle of hepadnaviruses, as described
  in the text. Envelope proteins are shown in yellow, DNA containing capsids in blue
  and RNA containing capsids in red. Upon infection mediated by the entry receptor,
  NTCP, virus nucleocapsids are transported to the nucleus, where rcDNA is converted
  to cccDNA. cccDNA does not undergo semiconservative DNA synthesis (). Early in infection,
  when envelope protein concentrations are low, newly made nucleocapsids, with their
  enclosed viral DNA, are transported to the nucleus to amplify cccDNA copy number
  to up to 50 per hepatocyte (). At the same time, envelope proteins enter the ER
  and assemble into subviral particles (SVP) or transfer to MVBs where virion assembly
  is believed to occur. When sufficient envelope is present, nucleocapsids are directed
  to their secretory pathway and cccDNA amplification ceases. Mature virions might
  exit cells through exosomes (for details and references see the text). Virus with
  dsl DNA can also infect hepatocytes. cccDNA is formed from dsl DNA by non-homologous
  recombination, resulting in a loss of sequences and, generally, rendering this cccDNA
  unable to support virus replication (). Dsl DNA may also integrate into host DNA
  via non-homologous recombination; this pathway does not appear to have a role in
  the virus life cycle. The figure does not show “empty” HBV virions produced by infected
  hepatocytes because the pathway for their assembly and secretion is not yet known
  (}.
