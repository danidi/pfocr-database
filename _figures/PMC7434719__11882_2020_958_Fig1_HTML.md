caption: Diagrammatic presentation of conserved domains of MUC2, MUC6, MUC5AC, and
  MUC5B. The secondary structures of mucins vary greatly in length, number, domain,
  and VNTR (variable number tandem repeat) domain. MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC5B all have
  a common structure as MUC2 protein, namely, the WxxW repeating region, which is
  a repeating region found in MUC2 and MUC5AC. But the function of this region is
  unknown and the repetitive sequence can be present in up to 32 copies. The region
  has a highly conserved WxxW sequence motif and at least six well-conserved cysteine
  residues. SOG2 protein super family participates in RAM signaling pathway within
  the scope of MUC5AC protein WxxW repeating region. And there are PHA03255 super
  family and PHA03247 super family within the scope of MUC5AC protein WxxW repeating
  region. The PHA03247 super family is in the Herpes-BLLF1 domain in MUC6. (VWD, von
  Willebrand factor (vWF) type D domain; WxxW, WxxW repeating region; C8, This domain
  contains 8 conserved cysteine residues; TIL, trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine rich
  domain; VWC, von Willebrand factor type C domain; Cy-Knot, cystine-knot domain;
  CT, C-terminal cystine knot-like domain (CTCK))
