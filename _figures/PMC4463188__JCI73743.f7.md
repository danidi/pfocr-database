caption: (A) Schematic model of the regulation of SUMO-dependent ER-α transcription
  by MEL-18. The loss of MEL-18 enhances SUMO activation via direct binding between
  the SUMO E2 enzyme UBC9 and its substrate. Moreover, MEL-18 depletion inhibits the
  deSUMOylation activity of SENP1 by enhancing the BMI-1/RING1B E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex–mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of SENP1. Via these two pathways,
  MEL-18 inhibits the SUMOylation of p53; alternatively, MEL-18 modulates SP1 SUMOylation
  via the SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation pathway. Increasing p53 and SP1 SUMOylation
  via MEL-18 silencing inhibits their recruitment to the ER-α promoter and downregulates
  ER-α expression. (B) Proposed model for the regulation of the balance between hormone
  dependence and independence by the polycomb protein MEL-18 in human breast cancer.
  In luminal breast cancer, MEL-18 contributes to the maintenance of the expression
  of the hormone receptors ER-α and PR but not HER2 by inhibiting the SUMOylation
  of ER-α transcription factors and by enhancing ER-α–dependent transcriptional activity,
  respectively. However, when MEL-18 expression is lost during breast cancer progression,
  the tumor develops hormone independence and resistance to antihormonal therapy,
  phenotypes of hormone receptor–negative breast cancers, including TNBC, which is
  characterized by the loss of ER-α and PR expression and the lack of HER2 amplification.
  Therefore, MEL-18 acts as a modulator of hormone receptor expression and a critical
  determinant of hormone dependence and independence in human breast cancer. SU, SUMOylation;
  TFs, transcription factors.
