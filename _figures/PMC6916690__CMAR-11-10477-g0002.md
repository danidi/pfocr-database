caption: 'Signaling pathways and cross talk, regulated by E-cadherin. E-cad/β-catenin/Wnt
  pathway :βcatenin plays a central role as an adaptor protein linking E-cadherin
  to the actin cytoskeleton in cell‐cell adhesion. It also remains a key component
  in the Wnt signaling. Under physiological conditions, cytoplasmic β-catenin remains
  in an inactive state by being bound to the APC/GSK3β/Axin/CK1 degradation complex
  and undergoes phosphorylation for ubiquitination. Wnt signaling inhibits this degradative
  process by phosphorylating and inhibiting the GSK3β complex. This raises the critical
  threshold of β-catenin in the cytoplasm required to translocate into the nucleus.
  Under permissive conditions which amplify aberrant Wnt signaling such as paracrine
  factors from tumor environment, cytokines from stromal cells and TNF-α from macrophages,
  β-catenin translocates into the nucleus and binds to TCF-4/LEF-1 proteins to induce
  Wnt target genes such as c-Myc, cyclins, MMP. This leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation
  and growth.– In the absence of E-cadherin, un-sequestered β-catenin released from
  the membrane-bound cadherin-catenin complex leads to excess cytoplasmic β-catenin.
  It has been demonstrated that β-catenin uses the same binding interface to engage
  TCF and E-cadherin ligands and cadherins have a superior binding affinity. There
  is a suggestion that as E-cad protein is lost there is excess un-sequestered cytoplasmic
  β-catenin that escapes degradation and enters the nucleus to bind to TCF and activate
  Wnt pathway. In addition to activating downstream Wnt associated genes, it is also
  demonstrated nuclear translocation of β-catenin represses PTEN expression. PTEN
  is a tumor suppressor and a critical regulator of AKT/MTOR pathway. Thus, the carefully
  balanced Wnt/β-catenin/E-cad functioning is tipped in favor of uncontrolled cell
  proliferation promoting oncogenesis – (). E-cad/EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK: Another function
  of E-cadherin is through its co-localization with EGFR at cell-cell contact and
  inhibiting EGFR pathways. Mutation of E-cadherin is associated with ligand-dependent
  activation of EGFR and downstream effectors through RAS/RAF/MEK pathways and also
  other pro-tumorigenic pathways such as FAK/c-Src and PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway thus
  contributing to enhanced cell proliferation and motility. In addition, E-cad loss
  is associated with increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus
  as described earlier. This translocation of β-catenin represses PTEN expression.
  PTEN is a tumor suppressor and a critical regulator of AKT/MTOR pathway, , – ().
  E-cad/P-120/Rho/MAPK pathway: The Rho family of GTPases belongs to the RAS superfamily.
  They act as binary molecular switches and regulate many aspects of intracellular
  cytoskeleton dynamics, motility and cell polarity, cell proliferation. Normally,
  when E-cad protein is lost the cells undergo apoptosis through a process called
  anoikis, a form of programmed cell death occurring after cellular detachment and
  loss of cell architecture and polarity. Functional analysis of activated RhoA mutations
  suggests that activated RhoA inhibits anoikis. Other mechanism of RhoA activation
  occurs indirectly through adhesion-dependent interaction with the p120 protein.
  Besides having a physiological role in adherens junction as described above, p120
  protein () binds E-cadherin and stabilizes adherens junctions and suppresses both
  RhoA and NF-ĸB pathways. However, upon E-cadherin silencing, this negative regulation
  of RhoA is lost and p120 promotes cell growth by activating and modulating RhoGTPase
  and thus activating RAS/RAC/MAPK activity and also through Rho mediated activation
  of inflammatory NF-ĸB pathways (BCL, IL-6, TNF). Although H. pylori is associated
  with intestinal type of gastric carcinoma; it may be a confounding factor in diffuse
  gastric cancer. It is demonstrated that Cag A (cytotoxic-associated gene A), secreted
  by H. pylori may cause epigenetic silencing of the E-cad gene, thus activate Rho
  through GRB/SHP-2 and downstream RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, , –, – (). E-cad/snail, slug,
  twist and Zeb-1pathway :E-cadherin also play an important developmental role in
  EMT transition by suppression of transcription factors: snail, slug, twist and Zeb-1.
  These factors are implicated in the differentiation of epithelial cell into mesenchymal
  cells (EMT). Loss of E-cadherin protein promotes epithelial to mesenchymal cell
  (EMT) transition and thus loss of cell polarity and activation of motility. Snail,
  Twist and Zeb-1, previously known to cause E-cadherin repression, were among the
  transcription factors up-regulated following E-cadherin loss. This loss of cellular
  architecture leads to a migratory, mesenchymal phenotype important in metastatic
  disease. Cells lose cytokeratin and E-cad markers and gain other mesenchymal markers
  such as vimentin and N-cadherin. Loss of E-cad protein could be due to germline
  mutation as observed in HDGC or due to overexpression of transcription repressor
  (snail/slug/twist/zeb) factors by advanced carcinomas which downregulates E-cad
  expression. This phenomenon is also called transcriptional silencing. This leads
  to invasion and metastases,,, ().'
