caption: Scheme summarizing the protective effect of isoliquiritigenin (ISL) on lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying mechanisms. ISL treatment
  significantly alleviated LPS-induced ALI via the restriction of oxidative and inflammatory
  injury, which was associated with activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Nrf2/antioxidant
  response element signaling and inhibition of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)
  and NF-κB pathways. Nevertheless, the inhibition of NLRP3 and NF-κB pathways by
  ISL could be Nrf2-dependent or Nrf2-independent, respectively.
