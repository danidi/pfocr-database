caption: HOCl sensing affects biofilm formation and chemotaxis in pathogenic bacteria.
  (Upper panel) Sublethal concentrations of HOCl turn planktonic P. aeruginosa into
  sessile biofilms. Upon exposure to HOCl, transcription of the P. aeruginosa PA3177
  gene encoding a diguanylate cyclase is induced via an as-yet-unknown regulatory
  pathway. This results in elevated c-di-GMP levels (black arrow) and subsequent induction
  of exopolysaccharide Pel and Psl production (dotted arrow). The increased hydrophobicity
  triggers the surface attachment and ultimately results in the switch from planktonic
  growth to nonmotile biofilm formation. (Lower panel) Cytosolic transducer-like protein
  D (TlpD) serves as a redox sensor in H. pylori to translate changes in HOCl concentrations.
  In the absence of HOCl, TlpD’s conserved cysteine in the chemoreceptor zinc-binding
  (CZB) domain is reduced and coordinates a Zn2+ ion. In its reduced state, TlpD induces
  the autophosphorylation of chemotaxis phosphorelation system CheA/CheY. CheY-Pi
  directly interacts with the flagellar rotor (labeled yellow), resulting in a temporary
  reversal of flagellar rotation (as indicated by arrows). In the presence of HOCl,
  the conserved cysteine is oxidized, Zn2+ is released, and the signaling is reversibly
  inactivated, resulting in a smooth swimming behavior (chemoattraction).
