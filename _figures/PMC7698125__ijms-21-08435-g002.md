caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs).In addition
  to AA, LOX pathway (purple) and CYP pathway (red) can metabolize the omega-3 PUFAs
  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) into various SPMs, which
  act as endogenous immunoresolvents upon stimulation. Lipoxins (LxA4 and LxB4) are
  formed from AA, E-series of resolvins (RvE1, RvE2, and RvE3) are formed from EPA,
  and D-series of resolvins (RvD1, RvD2, RvD3, RvD4, RvD5, and RvD6), protectins (PD1
  and PDX), and maresins (MaR1 and MaR2) are formed from DHA. HpEPE: hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic
  acid; HpDHA: hydroperoxydocosahexaenoic acid.'
