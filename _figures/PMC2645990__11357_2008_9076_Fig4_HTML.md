caption: Schematic representation of activation of α-secretase as a target for the
  therapy of Alzheimer’s disease. The scheme is based on Fig.  from the excellent
  review by Fahrenholz () on this topic. Activation of non-amyloidogenic amyloid precursor
  protein (APP)-processing by α-secretases prevents the generation of neurotoxic Aβ
  proteins. The non-amyloidogenic pathway can be enhanced by several compounds and
  pathways, including the direct interaction of the enzyme NRDc with α-secretase (Hiraoka
  et al. ). In addition, inhibition of amyloidogenic APP-processing and clearance
  of fibrils are also indicated as potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions
  (Skovronsky et al. ). In addition, Aβ peptides can be eliminated by degrading enzymes,
  like neprilysin or insulin-degrading enzyme (reviewed in Fahrenholz ()
