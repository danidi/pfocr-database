caption: 'To aid correlation with disease genes, subunits have been labelled according
  to their gene name. The commonly used protein names are in parenthesis as follows:
  three copies of the ATP5F1A (α-subunit) and ATP5F1B (β-subunit) are assembled with
  the aid of the chaperones ATPAF1 and ATPAF2 with later binding of the subunits ATP5F1C1
  (γ-subunit), ATP5F1D (δ-subunit) and ATP5F1E (ε-subunit). The membrane ring composed
  of ATP5MC1 (c-subunits; also encoded by ATP5MC2 and ATP5MC2) subunits is assembled
  and joins the pre-complex V prior to the addition of the subunits ATP5PB (b-subunit),
  ATP5PD (d-subunit), ATP5PF (F6-subunit) and ATP5PO (OSCP). The assembly pathway
  is followed by integration of ATP5ME (e-subunit), ATP5MF (f-subunit) and ATP5MG
  (g-subunit) and then by the mtDNA-encoded ATP6 (subunit 6) and ATP8 (subunit 8).
  The last subunits ATP5MPL (MP68) and ATP5MD (DAPIT) are added to complete the assembly
  of complex V. IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; Matrix, mitochondrial matrix.'
