caption: IL-33 signalling pathways. IL-33 mediates its function by binding to a receptor
  complex comprising ST2 and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP) leading to
  the recruitment of the myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MYD88)
  complex. Although the mechanism is unclear, the complex is thought to activate at
  least two independent pathways involving the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway as well as the phospholipase D (PLD)-sphingosine kinase (SPHK) pathway,
  ultimately leading to activation of MAP kinases and NFκB. SIGIRR acts as a negative
  regulator for signalling, and soluble ST can bind directly to IL-33 thus acting
  as a decoy receptor. Although biologically active IL-33 is generated passively by
  necrotic cells, caspase cleavage during apoptosis leads to inactivation.
