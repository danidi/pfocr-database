caption: Signalling pathways associated with myocardial hypertrophy. A simplified
  overview of our current understanding of the intracellular signalling pathways leading
  to myocardial hypertrophy. Although the molecular events coupling membrane receptors
  to nuclear events have not been fully documented, three principal arms (with interpathway
  crosstalk) are described, each converging onto a common pathway (mitogen activated
  protein kinase cascade) which ultimately leads to the nucleus. Considerable work
  remains to be done to fully characterise the pathways before any potential therapeutic
  targets can be identified.
