caption: Overlaid networks predicted by the PLS method and generated by IPA pathway
  designer. A. Depicted is an overlaid miRNA-mediated network consisting of the top
  network 1 from Figure 3A on the left side of this network (green-colored miRNAs)
  and 27 miRNAs labeled with ML on the right that were significantly associated with
  the pink-colored mRNAs that were predicted by PLS. B. Depicted is an overlaid miRNA-mediated
  network consisting of the top network 2 from the Figure 3B on the left side of this
  network (green-colored miRNAs) and 12 miRNAs labeled with ML on the right that were
  significantly associated with the pink-colored mRNAsthat were predicted by PLS.
