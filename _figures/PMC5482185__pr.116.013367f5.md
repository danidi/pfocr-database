caption: Diverse cellular functions of arrestin scaffolds. By associating with different
  cargos in different subcellular locations, visual/β-arrestins regulate multiple
  signaling networks. In quiescent cells, free cytosolic and microtubule-bound arrestins
  dampen basal pathway activity by sequestering signaling pathway intermediates away
  from their site of activation/action. Free arrestins can buffer cytosolic Ca2+–CaM
  concentration, suppress NFκB signaling by sequestering IκB kinases, and tonically
  inhibit β-catenin signaling by promoting GSK3β-dependent β-catenin phosphorylation
  and degradation. They also keep proapoptotic JNK kinases away from their nuclear
  substrates, whereas, in the case of β-arrestin2, they promote activation of cytosolic
  JNK. Microtubule-bound arrestins sequester inactive ERK1/2 away from the plasma
  membrane, dampening basal pathway activity, while directing Mdm2 toward cytoskeletal
  substrates. In some settings, this has the effect of increasing proapoptotic p53
  signaling by preventing p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Microtubule-bound arrestins
  also regulate cell adhesion by binding to regulators of focal adhesions such as
  Src, ERK1/2, and JNK. Once recruited to plasma membrane-bound GPCRs, arrestins promote
  GPCR desensitization, support clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and accelerate second-messenger
  degradation by recruiting cAMP phosphodiesterases and diacylglycerol kinase. At
  the membrane they also stimulate cell proliferation by promoting Src-dependent transactivation
  of EGF receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and promote cell survival by activating
  AKT. Through their interactions with numerous regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics,
  arrestin stimulate membrane ruffling, cell migration, and chemotaxis. Several β-arrestin
  cargos, e.g., ERK1/2, continue to signal from endosomal GPCR–arrestin signalsome
  complexes, where they regulate aspects of GPCR trafficking and recycling and preferentially
  phosphorylate cytosolic ERK substrates, leading to increased protein translation.
  β-Arrestins also stimulate canonical Wnt signaling by engaging Dsh and inhibiting
  GSK3β to stabilize β-catenin, and promote hedgehog signaling by internalizing and
  targeting smoothened to primary cilia. Within the nucleus, β-arrestin1 interacts
  with a number of transcription factors to either increase or tonically inhibit transcription.
