caption: 'Schematic diagram of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway showing key regulatory
  steps. The bottleneck in the pathway is the first committed step in the synthesis
  phytoene from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and is catalyzed by the light responsive
  enzyme, phytoene synthase (PSY). The branch point in the pathway involves the isomerisation
  of tetra-cis-lycopene to all-trans-lycopene by the carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO),
  which is regulated by a histone methyltransferase, SET DOMAIN GROUP8 (SDG8). Lycopene
  undergoes further modifications by εLCY (epsilon cyclase) and β-LCY (beta-cyclase)
  to produce α- and β-carotene, respectively, which serve as substrates for the production
  of lutein, phytohormones (abscisic acid and strigolactones) and an unknown signaling
  compound mediated by BYPASS (BPS). ccr: carotenoid and chloroplast regulation, lut2:
  lutein deficient mutant, CCD: CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE.'
