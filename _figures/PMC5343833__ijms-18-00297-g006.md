caption: Involvement of TGF-β/Smad pathway in AA-induced fibrogenesis. TGF-β is overexpressed
  in AAN contributing to fibrogenesis. Downstream, Smad3 has emerged as a key factor
  tightly linked to matrix accumulation and deletion of Smad3 protects against several
  kidney disease. Smad7 negatively regulate Smad3 and KO mice for Smad7 intoxicated
  with AA presented enhanced progression of renal injury.
