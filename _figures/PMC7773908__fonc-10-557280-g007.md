caption: Schematic representation of the positive crosstalk between epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) pathway in cervical
  cancer cells. In our hypothesized model, EGFR activation induces gene expression
  of the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2) enzyme, a member of the
  PAF biosynthesis pathway. EGFR can also induce the expression of PAF receptor (PAFR),
  which, then, can be activated by the PAF produced by LPCAT2 in EGFR-expressing cancer
  cells, in an autocrine fashion, or surrounding cells in a paracrine mechanism. PAFR
  can induce EGFR transactivation through the cleavage and release of EGF-like ligands
  from the plasma membrane, promoting MAPK activation and cell migration. The bidirectional
  interaction between the EGFR and the LPCAT-PAF-PAFR axis reveals the presence of
  a positive feedback loop. Still, the activation of both EGFR and PAFR leads to the
  expression of the inflammatory enzyme COX-2. COX-2 produces prostanoids, such as
  prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), using arachidonic acid released after the enzymatic action
  of cPLA2, the same enzyme that initiates the PAF biosynthesis pathway. Studies have
  shown that PGE2, like PAF, has an important pro-inflammatory and pro-tumoral effect,
  being able to transactivate EGFR. Genes upregulated by EGFR are indicated by blue
  arrows. Therefore, EGFR rises as a central pillar of the signaling pathways mediated
  by GPCRs, inducing a more aggressive phenotype in cervical cancer cells.
