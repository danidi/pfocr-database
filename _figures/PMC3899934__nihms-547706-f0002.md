caption: Activation of FXR increases hepatic expression of SR-BI, ABCG5/ABCG8, BSEP
  and Mdr2, and inhibits hepatic expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1. Thus, activation
  of FXR increases hepatic uptake of HDL-derived cholesteryl esters (CEs) and free
  cholesterol (FC). CEs are further hydrolyzed to form FC. FC is subsequently secreted
  to the bile by ABCG5/G8 or converted to bile acids (BA) by CYP7A1/CYP8B1 for secretion
  to the bile via BSEP. FXR is also reported to inhibit PCSK9 expression, thus increasing
  LDLR expression. Mdr2/MDR3 is a phospholipid transporter. The net result of FXR
  activation is reduced plasma HDL-C and LDL-C levels, and increased reverse cholesterol
  transport. Activation of FXR lowers plasma triglyceride (TG) levels likely through
  increasing hepatic expression of ApoC-II and repressing hepatic expression of ApoC-III
  and ANGTPL-3. The mechanism by which activation of FXR lowers hepatic TG levels
  remains controversial; the reported FXR-SHP-SREBP-1c pathway is not supported by
  other studies. FXR-induced or -repressed genes are indicated in red and blue, respectively.
  PL, phospholipids. BA, bile acids. ANGTPL3, angiopoietin-like protein 3.
