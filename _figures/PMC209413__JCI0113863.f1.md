caption: Schematic representation of the TGF-&bgr;/Smad pathway and its interrelationship
  with mediators of inflammatory signals. Ligation of TGF-&bgr; to the constitutively
  active receptor type II (R-II) causes recruitment and phosphorylation (P) of receptor
  type I (R-I) and formation of a receptor complex. The activated receptor I phosphorylates
  receptor-regulated Smad2 and -3, which then form a complex with the common mediator
  Smad4. The Smad2/3-Smad4 complex translocates into the nucleus together with DNA-binding
  cofactors and binds to enhancers specific for TGF-&bgr; target genes. The inhibitory
  Smad7 antagonizes TGF-&bgr; signaling by interfering with the binding of Smad2 and
  -3 with the activated receptor complex. IFN-&ggr; inhibits the TGF-&bgr;/Smad signaling
  pathway by upregulating the expression of Smad7. TNF-&agr; inhibits the pathway
  by inducing AP-1 components (c-Jun and JunB) that directly interfere with the interaction
  of the Smad2/3-Smad4 complex with DNA. Activation of NF-&kgr;B by a variety of inflammatory
  stimuli may also regulate the TGF-&bgr;/Smad pathway, but whether this involves
  activation or inhibition of Smad7 is still unclear. The NOD2 mutation, recently
  described in some CD patients, is depicted to suggest how it could hypothetically
  diminish the anti-inflammatory action of TFG-&bgr; by impairing NF-&kgr;B activity.
