caption: 'Links among COVID-19, cytokine storms, and HF. After SARS-CoV-2 infection,
  alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages release PAMPs and DAMPs, which
  activate the secretion of CCL-2, CCL-3, and CCL-5 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines
  IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN to activate and recruit pro-inflammatory cells, including
  T cells, B cells, and macrophages, to the location of the lesion. Upon exposure
  to a low dose of SARS-CoV-2, the infection is controlled by limited inflammation,
  while upon high-dose exposure, T-cell and B-cell exhaustions occur due to the limited
  inflammation induced by the elevated viral load. Increased IFN levels restrain virus
  replication, while the SARS-CoV-2 N protein antagonizes signaling through type I
  IFNs via limiting STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation. The persistence of stimulation
  by SARS-CoV-2 triggers the cytokine storm to secrete large amounts of cytokines
  that promote the progression of HF. (1) IL-6 induces diastolic dysfunction via positive
  inotropic effects mediated by the JAK-STAT3 pathway in cardiomyocytes. (2) IL-1β
  and TNF-α exert a negative inotropic effect by changing intracellular calcium homeostasis
  in cardiomyocytes to cause systolic dysfunction. (3) IL-1β and TNF-α upregulate
  AT1R on cardiac fibroblasts and then promote collagen deposition and fibrosis mediated
  by Ang II. (4) LOX-like 2 expression increases in cardiac fibroblasts via elevated
  TGF-β induced by TNF-α to promote collagen deposition and cardiac fibrosis. (4)
  Pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger intravascular oxidative stress in dysfunctional
  endothelial cells to stimulate the production of PAI-1 and then inhibit fibrinolysis,
  allowing microvascular thrombi to form. Abbreviations: AT1R, angiotensin type 1
  receptors; CCL, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 19;
  DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; JAK-STAT3,
  Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway; LOX, lysyl
  oxidase; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PAI-1, plasminogen activator
  inhibitor type 1; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; TGF,
