caption: The DE proteins caused by JA treatment and COI1 mutation during AAL toxin
  induced PCD were used to construct the model, and the impairment of COI1 induced
  protein changes were presented with the contrary change patterns. The identified
  proteins were assigned to different organelles or groups according to their subcellular
  localization and molecular functions. Up-regulated proteins are highlighted red
  and down-regulated proteins are colored green. Arrows and bars represent positive
  and negative regulation respectively. Red solid lines indicate that the pathways
  are up-regulated or promoted by JA during TA response, green solid lines with bars
  or arrows indicate that the pathways are down-regulated by JA during TA response,
  black solid lines with arrows links the proteins within the same pathway. TA induce
  PCD by inhibiting the synthesis of ceramide and inducing the overproduction of ROS,
  COI1-dependent JA pathway may promote this PCD progress by influencing the ROS production
  and scavenging, other hormone signaling pathways or some possible PCD regulators
  such as caspase-like proteins, autophagy and DNA repair related proteins. AAO, L-ascorbic
  acid oxidase; ABI1, ABA insensitive1; ACO1, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase
  homolog 1-like; AHA, plasma membrane H+-ATPase; AOS, allene oxide synthase; ATG11,
  autophagy related protein 11; CHS, chalcone synthase; CPI, cysteine protease inhibitor;
  Cyt, Cytochrome; DAP-AT, probable n-succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase-like;
  DDB, DNA damage binding proteins; DDR, DNA damage response; DRA, DNA repair ATPase-related
  family protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Golgi,
