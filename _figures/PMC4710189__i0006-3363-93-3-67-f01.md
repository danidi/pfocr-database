caption: ATM-mediated DNA DSB repair pathway. DNA damage is sensed by the MRN complex
  (sensor of DSBs, consists of MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1) and 53BP1 (sensor of changes
  in chromatin structure), which consequently activate ATM (red arrows). MDC1 binds
  to γH2AX via BRCA1 and is involved in the retention of the MRN complex to chromatin,
  accumulation of ATM, and mediation of the interaction between ATM and γH2AX. ATM
  phosphorylates γH2AX and activates downstream pathways leading to either DNA repair
  (activation of DNA strand resection, which leads to HR), or cell cycle arrest (via
  CHK2 and inhibition of CDC2, only G2/M highlighted as applicable to oocyte) and/or
  apoptosis (via c-abl and TAp63α). DNA strand resection is necessary to invade in
  the homologous DNA strand. The resulting single-strand (ss) DNA is coated with RPA,
  which in turn activates ATR and leads to cell cycle arrest (via CHK1). In germ cells,
  RPA is eventually replaced by Rad51and DMC1 (the latter is germ cell specific) through
  a BRCA2-mediated process, which results in the initiation of HR. Hence the declining
  function of key DNA repair proteins, such as BRCA1, Rad51, MRE11, and ATM, would
  lead to impaired DNA repair function, which would then shift the pathways from cell
  survival mode to cell death for the genomic protection of the species. DSB sensor
  proteins are in blue, effectors are in green, and transducers are in red. Molecules
  also involved in meiotic recombination are denoted with an asterisk (*). (Reproduced
