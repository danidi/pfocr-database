caption: Potential roles of iron in the development of colorectal cancer. Luminal
  iron may cause DNA damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  via the Fenton reaction. Haem may also stimulate the production of N-nitroso compounds
  (NOC) in the colon which are mutagenic. (I) In the initiation phase of tumorigenesis,
  DNA damage leads to mutations in key genes regulating cell proliferation and survival
  such as APC or β-catenin of the Wnt pathway; (II) In the promotion phase, the increase
  in cell proliferation and survival due to the deleterious effects of NOC and ROS
  leads to further genetic instability and an accumulation of more mutations. Iron
  is an important nutrient required for proliferation during this phase. Iron also
  increases intestinal inflammation and the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-6
  released from inflammatory cells increase cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis
  via the activation of NFκB; (III) In the progression phase, tumour cells gain independence
  from survival signals and progress towards a malignant phenotype. Iron has been
  shown to activate NFκB increasing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase
  (COX)-2 expression in macrophages. Activated macrophages produce more ROS, increase
  infiltration through degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and promote angiogenesis
  by release of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1, -6 and -8 as well
  as TNFα, ultimately leading to tissue invasion and metastasis.
