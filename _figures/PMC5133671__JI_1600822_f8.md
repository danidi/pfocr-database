caption: A simplified model for how AhR mediates the RANK/c-Fos signaling axis of
  osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. (A) The expression of AhR in bone
  marrow–derived osteoclasts was upregulated by RANKL at an earlier stage than the
  expression of signature osteoclast genes. (B) Osteoclast differentiation via the
  AhR signaling pathway was also regulated in a RANKL/c-Fos–dependent manner. Additionally,
  ligand activation of AhR by the smoke toxin BaP exacerbated osteoclast differentiation
  in a receptor-dependent manner. AhR-dependent regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis
  in osteoclasts was also observed. (C) AhR−/− mice exhibited impaired bone healing
  with delayed endochondral ossification. Taken together, the present results suggest
  that the RANKL/AhR/c-Fos signaling axis plays a critical role in osteoclastogenesis,
  thereby identifying the potential of targeting AhR to treat pathological, inflammatory,
  or metabolic disorders.
