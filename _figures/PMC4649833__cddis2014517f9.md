caption: Diagram illustrates the proposed molecular signaling of JWA that reverses
  cisplatin resistance via the CK2—XRCC1 pathway in human gastric cancer. (a) XRCC1
  expression was upregulated by cisplatin. (b) Overexpressed XRCC1 was phosphorylated
  by CK2. (c) JWA inhibited the expression of CK2. (d) Ubiquitination of XRCC1 was
  enhanced by the inhibition of CK2
