caption: A schematic model showing the effects of duodenal ghrelin on hepatic glucose
  fluxes and insulin signals. Ghrelin binds to its receptor, GHS-R1a, on the duodenum
  and inhibits mucosal AMPK. This signal is delivered to the NTS by vagus afferent
  nerve and activates the neurons in hindbrain region and NMDA receptors. Finally,
  the signal is relayed from the NTS to the liver via the efferent branch of the vagal
  nerve to increase HGP and inhibit insulin signal
