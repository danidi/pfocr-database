caption: The activation of GHS-R1a can be blocked by a number of compounds that act
  as antagonists in the presence of ghrelin. One such molecule is JMV2959, a commonly
  used compound that blocks ghrelin induced GHS-R1a signaling. This compound, however,
  acts as a partial agonist in the absence of ghrelin and can activate Gαq signaling
  through GHS-R1a. At the same time, JMV2959-induced activation prevents GHS-R1a internalization
  provoked by the activation of the β-arrestin pathway, potentially preventing GHS-R1a
  desensitization.
