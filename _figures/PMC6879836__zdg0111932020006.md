caption: A schematic of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Keap1
  signaling pathway and some of the potential mechanisms by which exercise training
  (ExT) impacts Nrf2, antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress, and sympathetic nerve
  activity. ARE, antioxidant response element; NQO-1, NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase
  1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RVLM, rostral ventrolateral medulla.
