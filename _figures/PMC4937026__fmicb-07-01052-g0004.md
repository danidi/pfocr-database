caption: Activation of STAT3 in KSHV-infected endothelial cells. KSHV binding/entry
  into endothelial cells rapidly phosphorylates STAT3 at Y705 through Janus kinases.
  STAT3 can also be phosphorylated at S727 by the activities of viral Kaposin B through
  cellular MK2. Simultaneously, phosphorylation of cellular KAP1 by MK2 releases STAT3
  from KAP1-mediated repression. Additionally, ROS, the alternate complement pathway
  and KSHV gene products such as vGPCR, vIL6 and miRNAs can also mediate phosphorylation
  of STAT3 at Y705.
