caption: 'At the presence of PCP, NMDAR is blocked, which leads to an observed reduction
  of NRG1 expression. This reduction in NRG1 expression could be a positive feed-back
  effect from NMDAR to presynaptic NRG1 (an unknown mechanism), or could be a reduction
  in NRG1 production from the nucleus of the post-synaptic pyramidal neurons (further
  studies are required to confirm this). The reduction of NRG1 then leads to reduction
  of NRG1-ErbB4 signalling, leading to a further reduction of NMDAR function, possibly
  via the Fyn pathway. The hypofunction of NMDAR and reduced NRG1 could then leads
  to reduced BDNF expression, and down-regulation of the downstream Akt-GSK phosphorylations.
  This finally leads to a reduction in synaptic protein productions , including synaptophysin
  and PSD95, also contributing to the reduction of neurite outgrowth as observed in
  the present study. Fyn: Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase; NR2: NMDA receptor
  subunit 2; SYN: synaptophysin.'
