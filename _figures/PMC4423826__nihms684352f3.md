caption: 'Insulin resistance associated with obesity, especially central, occurs due
  to pre-receptor, receptor and/or post-receptor impairments, mainly secondary to
  elevated FFA, hyperinsulinemia and increased cytokines. Insulin access to the interstitial
  space (pre-receptor impairment) may be induced by the excess of FFA and their metabolites
  as well by endothelial dysfunction secondary to increased circulating insulin. Hyperinsulinemia,
  secondary to the decrease of FFA-induced insulin clearance and the increase of insulin
  secretion, causes downregulation of insulin receptors (receptor impairment). In
  addition, insulin receptor downstream signaling (post-receptor impairment) is inhibited
  by FFA and cytokines. Increased intracellular FFA also contribute to excessive production
  of ATP, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, production of reactive oxidative
  species, endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid storage and accumulation of non-oxidative
  toxic derivatives (dyacylgycerol and ceramide). The aforementioned factors also
  activate inflammation pathways. Independently of the upstream or downstream level
  of the insulin receptor impairment, insulin resistance occurs by the inhibition
  of the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 or 2) and the subsequent
  inhibition of PI3K pathway, responsible for metabolic effects. Consequently to this
  inhibition occurs 1) decrease in the activation of GLUT-4 which impairs glucose
  uptake; 2) increase of glucose production by the liver (either by inhibiting glucogenesis
  and/or promoting glycogenolysis) and 3) increase of de novo lipogenesis, storage
  of lipid (lipid droplets) and toxic derivatives. On the other hand, the insulin
  receptor substrate, Shc, is spared from inhibition by FFA or cytokines and is stimulated
  by hyperinsulinemia. Consequently, MAPK pathway (mitogenic) is activated leading
  to anti-apoptotic and proliferation effects, culminating with tissue growth. Metabolic
  and non-metabolic consequences of IR and ectopic accumulation of fat are: hyperglycemia,
  hypertriglyceridemia, acanthosis nigricans, neoplasias, steatosis, cell growth or
  apoptosis or cell dysfunction.FFA: free fatty acids; IRS: insulin receptor substrates;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; DAG: dyacylgycerol;
  ROS: reactive oxidative species; ERS: endoplasmic reticulum stress, AN: acanthosis
  nigricans.'
