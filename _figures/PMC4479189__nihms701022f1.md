caption: O-GlcNAc cycling is a nutrient-dependent modification capable of generating
  a graded signaling output to a multitude of simultaneous targets. Directly supplied
  by the breakdown of food, 2 to 3% of glucose entering cells is driven to the Hexosamine
  Biosynthetic Pathway to generate UDP-GlcNAc using other nutrient derived precursors.
  The breakdown of foods to produce metabolites is represented by the stylized bubbles.
  O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) uses the varying levels of UDP-GlcNAc to O-GlcNAcylate
  serine or threonine residue of diverse intracellular proteins (nuclear, cytoplasmic
  or mitochondrial). The O-GlcNAcase (OGA) hydrolyzes the GlcNAc moiety and creates
  a dynamic posttranslational protein modification. This, in turn, impacts canonic
  phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades, alters protein stability, and may
  cause direct enzyme activation. Thus, levels of food-derived metabolites are integrated,
  amplified and transduced by the Hexosamine signaling pathway.
