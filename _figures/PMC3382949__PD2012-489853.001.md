caption: Role of A2A receptors on modifications in the activity of the striatal efferent
  pathways. Under physiological conditions (a), striatal neurons receive dopaminergic
  inputs from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Endogenous dopamine (DA) activates
  the neurons belonging to the so-called direct pathway (in green), which send GABAergic
  projections to the substantia nigra pars reticulata/globus pallidus pars interna
  (SNr/GPi) and express D1 stimulatory dopamine receptors, together with the neuropeptide
  dynorphin (dyn). At the same time, dopamine also depresses the neurons belonging
  to the so-called indirect pathway (in red) which send GABAergic projections to the
  SNr/GPi via globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) and
  express D2 inhibitory dopamine receptors and the neuropeptide enkephalin (enk).
  Adenosine A2A receptors stimulate the indirect pathway where they are selectively
  expressed, and their activation negatively modulates the function of D2 receptors.
  A balanced level of activity of the direct and indirect pathways is at the basis
  of the correct processing of motor information and movement execution. In Parkinson's
  disease (b), the degeneration of the neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop
  in the dopaminergic input to the striatum. This results in a reduced activation
  of the direct pathway and in a disinhibition of the indirect pathway, which is associated
  with the elevation of A2A receptor transmission. Such unbalanced activity of the
  striatal output pathways is at the basis of the motor impairment observed in Parkinson's
  disease (b). Administration of L-DOPA restores the compromised dopaminergic tone
  since it stimulates the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect one (not shown).
  However, chronic treatment with L-DOPA (c) leads to the overactivation of the direct
  pathway, which together with the increase of A2A receptor activity [, , ] and enhanced
  indirect pathway transmission is at the basis of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and loss
  of efficacy. The addition of an A2A antagonist to L-DOPA (d) although not counteracting
  the overactivity of the direct pathway (dyskinesia) stabilizes the activity of the
  indirect pathway, resulting in motor stimulation, potentially without a worsening
  of dyskinesia.
