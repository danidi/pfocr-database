caption: In response to a decrease in the activity of D2-MSNs, the amount of bridging
  collaterals is decreased (left) from the basal level (center). We hypothesize that
  the bridging collaterals innervate a distinct neuronal population from prototypic
  neurons that receive input from D2-MSNs in the GPe. These regulator neurons may
  be boosting the function of the indirect pathway (possibly by activating D2-MSNs,
  inhibiting GPe prototypic neurons, or inhibiting D1-MSNs). A decrease in inhibition
  produced by the bridiging collaterals may therefore result in increased behavioral
  inhibition. In contrast, an increase in bridging collaterals (right) may lead to
  greater suppressions on the regulator neurons, which results in increased action
  initiations. For the simplicity of the diagram, the subthalamic nucleus that receive
  input from the GPe is omitted.
