caption: The metabolic pathway for production of glycolate from xylose in glycolaldehyde
  oxidation pathway and glyoxylate reduction pathway. Enzymes associated with the
  reactions were showed and the over expressions of which were marked in bold. d-xylose
  was converted to d-xylonate by xylose dehydrogenase (xdh) and xylonolactonase (xylC)
  from C. crescentus. All other genes were from the native E. coli BL21(DE3)
