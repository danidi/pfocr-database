caption: Celecoxib and curcumol cooperatively induce apoptosis through caspase-dependent
  pathway and cell cycle arrest. In NSCLC cells, combined treatment with celecoxib
  and curcumol at a low dosage inhibits AKT phosphorylation via the PI3K inhibition,
  which contributes to inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, suppresses
  the nuclear translocation of p65, and, in turn, decreases the expression of NF-κB
  target genes, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Thus, the increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio
  induces the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane with the release of cytochrome
  c and the consequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis
  of NSCLC cells. Inhibition of NF-κB also results in aberrant expression of cell
  cycle regulators, such as cyclin D1, cyclin E, cdk2 and p21, which leads to cell
  cycle G1 arrest and finally promotes cell apoptosis. In addition, the suppression
  of NF-κB leads to decreased expression of MMP-9 and phospho-FAK, thereby inhibiting
  tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, the combination of celecoxib and curcumol
  also suppresses the activation of MAPK pathway. All of the above may account for
  the synergistic effects of celecoxib and curcumol on NSCLC cells.
