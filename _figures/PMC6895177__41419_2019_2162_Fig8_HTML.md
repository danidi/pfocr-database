caption: Chronic pathological stimuli such as hypoxia induce excessive ER stress,
  which, in turn, hyperactivates UPR and impairs autophagy. Hyperactivated UPR enhances
  TXNIP and subsequently triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Activated NLRP3 inflammasome
  increases the production of active caspase-1, which, in turn, cleaves pro-IL-18/pro-IL-1β
  and pro-GSDMD into matured IL-18/IL-1β and N-terminal fragments of GSDMD, respectively.
  N-terminal fragments of GSDMD are translocated to the plasma membrane and form pores,
  which leads to pyroptosis and subsequent release of cell contents including DAMP,
  contributing to sterile inflammation. On the other hand, impaired autophagy may
  trigger pyroptosis, leading to sterile inflammation.
