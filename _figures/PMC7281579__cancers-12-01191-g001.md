caption: Increased glucose metabolism facilitates endometrial cancer phenotypes. Genetic
  abnormalities, such as loss of the tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homologue
  (PTEN), and mutations in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family members, are
  common in EC. Chronic exposure to high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) facilitate
  tumor growth by providing a carbon source for diverse metabolic pathways. Genetic
  abnormalities common in EC converge on signaling pathways that fuel anabolic growth,
  particularly the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. This pathway regulates the activity and
  expression of proteins that control glucose uptake, glycolysis, and de novo lipogenesis.
  Glucose transporters (GLUTs 1, 3, 6 and 8), enzymes that regulate glycolysis [hexokinase
  2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)] and de novo
  lipogenesis [ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl CoA carboxylases (ACCs), fatty acid
  synthase (FASN)] are all elevated in EC. Glucose can also be metabolized via the
  Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) which facilitates nucleotide biosynthesis, as well
  as antioxidant defense through the generation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) which is an electron donor for the production of reduced glutathione
  (GSH). GSH is utilized by glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), which is upregulated
  in EC and promotes antioxidant defense. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) is
  upregulated in EC and is a proton-coupled symporter that transports lactate inside
  and outside the cell. Protons transported outside the cell can contribute to a lower
  extracellular pH. Glucose can also be metabolized through the hexosamine pathway
  which generates uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). UDP-GlcNAc
  can be used for the common post-translational modification, O-Linked β-N-acetylglucosamine
  (O-GlcNAc). The expression of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and Meningioma-Expressed
  Antigen 5 (MGEA5) are increased in EC, suggesting that protein O-GlcNAcylation reactions
  may also contribute to EC. Glucose can also bind non-enzymatically with amino groups
  on proteins to form precursors of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Hyperglycemia
  results in the chronic accumulation of AGEs which when bound to the Receptor for
  AGE (RAGE) increase inflammatory signaling (by promoting NF-κB activation) and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) that can damage cellular proteins, DNA, and lipids. RAGE expression
  is elevated in EC. EC cells cultured in high glucose conditions have lower phosphorylation
  of 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), increased expression
  of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, estrogen receptor ɑ (ERɑ), vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) and Janus kinases JAK1/2, and decreased expression of forkhead box class
  O1 (FOXO1). Many of these markers are reversed when EC cells are exposed to supraphysiological
  concentrations of the anti-diabetic agent, metformin. Mutations in the exonuclease
  domain of the DNA polymerase POLE confer a favorable prognosis in EC and are linked
  to higher expression of glycolytic enzymes, including phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI).
  Glucose can also be metabolized by cells in the tumor microenvironment, including
  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), stromal cells, and bacteria. These cells can
  also utilize or are affected by lactate produced by EC cells. These other cell types
  may promote EC initiation and/or progression and resistance to therapy.
