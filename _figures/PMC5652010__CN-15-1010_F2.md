caption: Schematic representations of melatonin-dependent regulation of βAPP processing
  secretases and its possible underlying mechanisms. The proteolytic processing of
  βAPP by the non-amyloidogenic pathway precludes Aβ formation. Cleavage by α-secretase
  (ADAM 10) releases sAPPα and C83 which further undergoes cleavage by γ-secretase
  to generate P3 and AICD fragments; thereby preventing the generation and release
  of Aβ peptides. In amyloidogenic pathway, βAPP is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE1)
  releasing sAPPβ and C99 which is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase to produce
  Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 peptides. Stimulation of the melatonin receptors located at
  the plasma membrane induce ERK phosphorylation probably via three distinct signaling
  pathways (Gq/PLC/PKC, Gi/PI3K/PDK1/PKC or Gs/cAMP/PKA) thus triggering the activation
  of transcription factors CREB, Oct-1, and HIF-1 which further increase ADAM10 promoter
  transactivation and mRNA levels consequently granting more α-secretase activity
  and sAPPα production fomenting neuroprotection. In the amyloidogenic pathway, melatonin
  in a receptor-dependent manner attenuates BACE1 and PS1 protein expression and transcriptional
  levels and decreases levels of C99 which is further cleaved by γ-secretase to generate
  Aβ peptide. BACE1 promoter region has multiple transcription factor binding sites
  like for NF-κB. Melatonin inhibits NF-κB activation which could possibly regulate
  melatonin induced decrease in BACE1 and C99 expression. Thus melatonin-dependent
  transcriptional activation of α-secretases and down regulation of BACE1 and PSI
  levels strongly indicates the beneficial role of melatonin in AD pathology thereby
  precluding Aβ production. Aβ, beta-amyloid; ADAM10, α-secretase; BACE1, β-secretase;
