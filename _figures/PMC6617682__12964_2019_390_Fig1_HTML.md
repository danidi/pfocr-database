caption: 'The mechanism of exosomal miRNAs loading. In the nucleus, Pol-II enzyme
  transcribes primary miRNAs (pri-miRNA) from miRNA-related genes. DGCR8 and Drosha
  structure catalyzes pri-RNAs into pre-miRNAs form, which is transferred toward cytoplasm
  employing exportin-5 protein. At the cytoplasmic level, the pre-miRNAs are trimmed
  into double-stranded miRNAs through the Dicer complex action. Then Helices, a splicing
  enzyme, generates mature miRNAs which harbors single-stranded. In the final step,
  MVBs (exosomes) capture mature miRNAs via four possible mechanisms including: 3′
  miRNA sequence-dependent pathway, nSMase2-dependent pathway, the miRNAISC-based
  pathway, and sumoylated hnRNPs-related pathway. Other biological materials are sorted
  into exosomes through endocytosis, Golgi apparatus, different protein complexes,
  and ESCRT machinery randomly or/and preferentially. Of note, after exosome maturation,
  MVB could back fuse with the PM in which decorate the mother cell PM with specific
  receptors (I). Another fate is that MVB combine to the PM and exports its cargoes
  to the ECM (pathway II). Scientists believe that MVB may select degradation pathway
  where it combine with lysosomes (pathway III) and its content is degraded. Different
  proteins such as Rab-GTPase and SNAREs contribute in intracellular MVB trafficking
  and fusion. Three possible mechanisms were proposed by which exosomes can alter
  target cell function, I: endocytotic pathway; II: ligand-receptor interaction; III:
  direct fusion'
