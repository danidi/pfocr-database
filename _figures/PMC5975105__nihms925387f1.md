caption: Schematic overview of miRNAs associated with the regulation of cellular cholesterol
  homeostasis. Intracellular cholesterol metabolism can be regulated through 3 different
  ways including cholesterol de novo synthesis, cholesterol transport and esterification.
  miRNAs repress the cholesterol biosynthesis by directly targeting the rate-limiting
  enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), or indirectly targeting
  the important regulators in biosynthesis pathway including sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein-2 (SREBP-2) and insulin induced gene (INSIG). Intracellular cholesterol
  transport is hampered by miRNAs targeting cholesterol transporters Neimann–Pick
  C1 (NPC1) and oxysterol-binding protein-like 6/9 (OSBPL6/9). miR-9 controls cholesterol
  esterification and lipid droplet formation by directly targeting acylcoenzyme A-cholesterol
  acyltransferase (ACAT). The indicated miRNAs also regulate the expression of mRNAs
  associated with cholesterol uptake and export including the low-density lipoprotein
  receptor (LDLR) and ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) respectively.
