caption: (A). Under normal homeostatic conditions, the ATF6, IRE1 and PERK proteins
  are bound to BiP/Grp78 at the ER membrane. An unfolded protein response (UPR) releases
  these ER-stress transducers from BiP. Released ATF6 translocates to the nucleus
  to augment XBP-1 gene expression. Parallel activation of IRE1 enables splicing of
  XBP-1 mRNA, which encodes a transcription factor that stimulates several stress
  inducible genes. Released PERK activates eIF2α, which then inhibits translation
  of cap-dependent proteins to further protect cells from UPR progression. Thus, cross-talks
  between these ER-stress transducers act via parallel pathways to facilitate cell
  survival and restore cellular homeostasis following a mild and transient ER-stress.
  However, under prolonged or severe ER-stress, the cap-independent translation of
  ATF4 continues. Nuclear ATF4 levels deregulate cellular homeostasis by enhancing
  the expression of ER-stress death sensors, CHOP and TRIB3. (B). TRIB3 acts as the
  ‘molecular switch’ that dictates cell survival or cell death decisions following
  ER-stress. Low levels of TRIB3 functions via a negative feedback-loop to suppress
  ATF4 and CHOP expression, thus enabling cell survival (left panel). However, high
  levels of TRIB3 down-regulates the AKT survival pathway, but does not suppress ATF4
  and CHOP which continues to produce uncontrolled levels of TRIB3. This imbalance
  subverts the UPR and ER-stress responses from a survival mode towards apoptosis
  (right panel).
