caption: DSBs generated by extrinsic and intrinsic factors are recognized by the sensor
  proteins Ku70/Ku80, WRN, MRN, and PARP1 to mediate repair. DSBs are repaired via
  classical/canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ), alternative (alt)-NHEJ,
  and homologous recombination (HR) pathways. WRN promotes Ku-dependent c-NHEJ with
  its catalytic activities and strongly inhibits alt-NHEJ with its non-catalytic activities.
  WRN suppresses the recruitment and downstream functions of MRE11 and CtIP to inhibit
  alt-NHEJ. During S/G 2 phases of the cell cycle, WRN promotes HR. Accurate repair
  of DSBs is required for genome stability without loss of genetic information.
