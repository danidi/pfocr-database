caption: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase signaling. The ectopic expression of ALK fusion
  proteins leads to the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase, and concomitant
  activation of multiple signaling pathways. ALK, via a direct binding of IRS1, Shc,
  and Src on specific tyrosine residues, is a strong activator of the Ras/Mek/Erk-1/2
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway that provides key mitogenic
  signaling. Ras/Erk pathways, via multiple AP-1 transcription factors, up regulates
  the CD30 expression. Mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/ERK signaling pathway
  results in phosphorylation of mTOR which in turn leads to the phosphorylation of
  several critical targets (p70S6K and S6rp, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eiF4E)–binding
  protein-1 (4E-BP1). Activation of mTOR is also achieved through the synergist activation
  of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway as result of the activation
  of Akt1/2 molecules. In the case of PLC-γ, this protein is directly activated by
  ALK (Y664) and capable of triggering pro-mitogenic stimuli generating diacylglycerol
  and IP3, which leads to the activation of PKC, and mobilization of calcium stores
  from the endoplasmic reticulum as well. As for many other cells, activated Akt1/2
  enhance ALCL cell survival by blocking the function of pro-apoptotic proteins, such
  as BAD and indirectly regulate key cell cycle regulators (BIM-1, p27, and cyclinD2)
  via FOXO3A. Negative regulation of p-GSK3β leads to the up-regulation of Mcl-1 and
  CDC25A which confers the advantage of growth and protection from apoptosis. Stat3
  regulated molecules are essential and required for the maintenance of the ALK-mediated
  neoplastic phenotype of ALCL cells. ALK fusion proteins can directly phosphorylate
  STAT3, alternatively JAK2/3 can also synergize. Negative regulators of this pathway
  may impose their action by dephosphorylating ALK itself and/or receptor-associated
  kinases (Src and JAK). Notably, methylation of the promoter region of SHP1 has been
  reported in ALK+ ALCL cells, resulting in the down-regulation of its expression
  and thus an overall enhancement of STAT3 signaling. Activation of STAT3 is associated
  with a specific signature (∼1500 genes), which includes several transcription factors
  (i.e., CEBP/β), cell cycle (i.e., Cyclin D, c-myc etc.), survival/apoptosis molecules
  (Bcl-A2, Bcl-XL, Survivin, MCL-1) and cell adhesion, and mobility proteins.
