caption: Model of the role of sphingolipid metabolism in fetomaternal tolerance. A,
  sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. × indicates genetic disruption of sphingosine
  kinase genes. B and C, schematic diagrams depicting cross-sections of implantation
  sites on day 7 of normal pregnancy (B) or Sphk-deficient pregnancy (C) in mice.
  B, during normal pregnancy, sphingolipid signaling pathway is highly activated,
  and Sphk is abundantly expressed at the fetomaternal interface to protect the semiallogeneic
  fetus from assault by the maternal immune system. C, with the loss of Sphk activity
  during pregnancy, the innate arm of maternal immune system recognizes the fetus
  as a potential target for immunological attack, resulting in pregnancy loss.
