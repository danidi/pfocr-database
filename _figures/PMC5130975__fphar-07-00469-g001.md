caption: A schematic diagraph indicating the targets on which plant products/herbs
  act during the pathogenesis of CVDs. Plant products/herbs demonstrate protective
  effect in CVDs by attenuating damage in cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells (ECs),
  vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages/monocytes (M&Ms). In VSMCs,
  plant products/herbs show the beneficial effect by inhibiting expression or activity
  of contractile and structural proteins, modulating expression of ECM proteins/glycoproteins,
  regulating calcium levels, attenuating proliferation and migrations, alleviating
  inflammation, and improving mitochondrial function. In ECs, plant products/herbs
  show the beneficial effect by inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis,
  activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase(NOS)-NO signaling pathway, induction
  of angiogenesis and suppression of endothelial permeability. In cardiomyocytes,
  plant products/herbs show the beneficial effect by inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy,
  oxidative stress and apoptosis, opening KATP channels and increasing atrial natriuretic
  peptide (ANP) secretion. In macrophages and monocytes, plant products/herbs show
  the beneficial effect by inhibition of inducible NOS-NO signaling pathway, activation
  of estrogen receptor and nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
  alpha (PPARα). A myriad of molecular, and cellular pathways are favorably modulated
  by plant products/plants or their extracts.
