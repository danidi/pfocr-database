caption: Senescence prevention by HO‐1 activation. (a) Mitochondrial dysfunction,
  characterized by a decrease in basal respiration and an increase in mROS production,
  is observed at nonsenescent passage in COPD lung fibroblasts. At the same time,
  defective mitophagy is also present (increase in mitochondria mass and decrease
  in Parkin), which ensures the maintenance of malfunctional mitochondria. To compensate
  for this effect, fibroblasts increase mitochondria biogenesis. (b) At the onset
  of senescence state, mitochondria dysfunction is exacerbated as evidenced by a further
  decrease in basal and maximal respiration, ATP turnover, and increased mROS production.
  However, mitochondria biogenesis compensatory pathway is lost. All of this contributes
  to the induction of senescence in senescent lung fibroblasts. (c) The induction
  of HO‐1 by hemin exerts a protective effect on mitochondria function (improvement
  of all parameters) and increases mitophagy (decrease in mitochondria mass and increase
  in PINK‐1). Thus, HO‐1 prevents the induction of senescence in COPD fibroblasts
  by protecting against mitochondria dysfunction
