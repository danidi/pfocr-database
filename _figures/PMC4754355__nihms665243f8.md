caption: Proposed mechanism by which activation of BDNF receptor TrkB using 7,8-dihydroxyflavone
  (7,8-DHF), a small-molecule TrkB agonist, improves brain plasticity and mental health
  following traumatic brain injury (TBI). 7,8-DHF is a member of the flavonoid family
  that crosses the blood–brain barrier and activates the TrkB receptor similar to
  the BDNF. The treatment with 7,8-DHF restores the TBI induced disruption of TrkB
  signaling, which plays a pivotal action on mitochondrial biogenesis through metabolic
  activators such as PGC-1α. PGC-1α improves mitochondrial function by activating
  mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription, and mitochondrial proliferation through
  mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). The mtDNA transcription leads to the
  synthesis of mitochondrial proteins including cytochrome c oxidase (COII), which
  is a key player for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria.
  ATP and NAD are small molecules involved in all energy transactions in cells, and
  can be sensed by regulatory proteins, such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) respectively, which both have the capacity to activate PGC-1α.
  The alteration in AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling pathway plays a critical role to regulate
  mitochondrial energy system, and is important for maintaining cognitive function
  and synaptic plasticity via CREB. Regulation of synaptic function by 7,8-DHF can
  also be mediated by syntaxin-3 and GAP-43. Overall, the diagram illustrates a mechanism
  by which the interplay between energy management and plasticity regulates neuronal
  function under homeostatic and injured conditions.
