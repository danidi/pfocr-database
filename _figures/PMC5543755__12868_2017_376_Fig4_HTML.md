caption: Merged mouse and rat network (mapped to human proteins) and overlapping Reactome
  pathways. Genes are colored according to their Reactome pathway memberships (DLG4
  is part of both ‘Interactions of neurexins and neuroligins at synapses’ and ‘Activation
  of Ca2+-permeable Kainate receptors’ pathways). The most prevalent Reactome pathways
  are shown. The network includes 13 (equal to 22%) of the proteins from the ‘Interactions
  of neurexins and neuroligins at synapses’ pathway, 6 (equal to 60%) of the proteins
  from the ‘Activation of Ca2+-permeable Kainate receptors’ pathway, 8 (equal to 50%)
  of the proteins from the ‘mTOR signaling’ pathway, and 7 (equal to 7%) of the proteins
  from the ‘Cargo recognition for clathrin-mediated endocytosis’ pathway. Reactome
  pathway annotations were filtered to include only reviewed human proteins from UniProt
  and protein-pathway associations with the evidence code “traceable author statement”
  (TAS)
