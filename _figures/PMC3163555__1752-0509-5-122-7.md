caption: Retrosynthetic map for the production of paclitaxel (taxol) in yeast. Compounds
  in gray are endogenous to the chassis organism (S. cerevisiae); enzymatic reactions
  are represented as circles; 10-deactyl-2-debenzoylbaccatin III appears as a branching
  compound; the target compound is at the bottom of the plot.
