caption: Examples of genes (in red) within the HIF pathway in which positive selection
  has been identified in high-altitude populations. Activation of the HIF response
  involves prolyl hydroxylases (PHD), which, in the presence of oxygen, hydroxylates
  HIFα thus targeting it for destruction by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Under
  hypoxic conditions, HIFα persists to combine with the constitutively present HIFβ,
  and this dimer acts as a transcription factor, influencing the expression of over
  100 genes, which possess hypoxia response elements in their promoter regions, and
  play a role in the cellular and systemic response to hypoxia. The HIF response involves
  increasing oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues (through effects on angiogenesis,
  vascular tone, and erythropoiesis) as well as modifying cell metabolism, proliferation,
  and survival pathways. High-altitude positive selection has been demonstrated in
  all parts of this pathway, but none of the alleles affected have been demonstrated
  in more than one population. Data summarized from []. HIF hypoxia-inducible factor,
  HRE hypoxia response elements, PHD prolyl hydroxylase
