caption: Network analysis and hypothetical model construction. a A pluripotency regulatory
  network of floating hHFMSCsOCT4. Red dots indicate genes that are upregulated, blue
  dots are downregulated genes, and undifferentially expressed genes are shown in
  gray. The size of the dot is proportional to the absolute value of the log2-fold
  change value. b Hypothetical model in which OCT4-reprogrammed hHFMSCs modulate pluripotency
  and hematopoietic capacity by regulating morphology and adhesion via the TJ pathway.
  The red box represents genes upregulated genes in cells, and green one represents
  downregulated genes. Circles with different shades of color represent changes in
  cell adhesion, and light to dark represent low to high
