caption: 'Proposed Steps in the TMC biosynthetic pathway. Abbreviations: KS – ketosynthase,
  AT – acyltransferase, ACP – acyl carrier protein, DH – dehydratase, KR – ketoreductase,
  ER – enoylreductase, TE – thioesterase. Domains predicted to be inactive are marked
  with an “X”. Domains that are active but not utilized are indicated with an “*”.
  The ordering of post-PKS tailoring reactions is unknown.'
