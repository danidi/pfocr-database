caption: A number of studies suggest that an increase in microbial BSH activity results
  in a reduction in stimulation of intestinal FXR. (A) Conjugated bile acids (C-BA)
  are rapidly absorbed in the terminal ileum but BSH activity reduces the amounts
  of C-BA locally leading to decreased entry of bile acids (BA) into the cell and
  reduced engagement of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Reduced FXR potentiates the capacity
  for LXR to become activated and studies show that liver orphan receptor (LXR) activation
  stimulates the Transintestinal Cholesterol Excretion (TICE) pathway in the gut leading
  to net cholesterol excretion. (B) Reduced engagement of FXR in the ileum reduces
  fibroblast growth factor 15 (in mice) or 19 (in humans) (FGF15/19) preventing feedback
  inhibition of Cyp7A1 and increasing de novo synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol
  thereby reducing systemic cholesterol levels. (C) Increased excretion of bile acids
  reduces hepatic signaling to FXR which results in increased potential for activation
  of LXR and elevated expression of Abcg5/8 allowing for excretion of cholesterol
  into the bile.
