caption: Distribution of Actinidia ESTs in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Previously
  published sequences in GenBank belonging to the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway []
  were used to identify genes in the Actinidia EST database using BLAST searches.
  Enzyme names are followed in brackets by the number of ESTs in different families
  of genes encoding these enzymes. See text for abbreviations.
