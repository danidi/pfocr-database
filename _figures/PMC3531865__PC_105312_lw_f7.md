caption: 'Model: Suppression of the Arabidopsis Immune Response by .Unknown elicitors
  from  ( and/or T3Es) activate  signaling and indole glucosinolate metabolism.  signaling
  and  signaling are antagonistic, with  activating COI1 to suppress  accumulation.  also
  suppresses indole glucosinolate metabolism upstream of  accumulation.  signaling
  promotes indole glucosinolate metabolism, perhaps by suppressing  accumulation,
  and also promotes callose deposition independent of COI1 through an unknown pathway.  suppresses
  defense in a COI1-independent manner through an unknown pathway.'
