caption: (A) In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by β-secretase (β-sec,
  BACE), leading to a secreted ectodomain, sAPPβ and a membrane bound fragment, C99.
  C99 is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase (γ-sec), generating the APP intracellular
  domain (AICD) and Aβ, prone to aggregation. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, α-secretase
  (α-sec, ADAMs) cleaves APP to generate the secreted sAPPα and membrane bound C83
  fragment. Then C83 is cleaved by γ-secretase, yielding the P3 fragment and the AICD.(B)
  Upon ligand binding, Notch is cleaved by ADAM, releasing the extracellular domain,
  leaving a membrane-tethered “stub”. This stub is the substrate of γ-secretase, which
  releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane, allowing it to
  translocate to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator.(C–E) Sequential
  processing of DCC. (C) DCC is cleaved by metalloprotease that leads to “shedding”
  of the ectodomain segment, generating a membrane-tethered DCC stub. Following γ-secretase
  cleavage, DCC-ICD is released from the membrane. (D) Inhibition of metalloprotease
  cleavage increases the level of full-length DCC receptor on the membrane. (E) Blocking
  γ-secretase activity leads to the accumulation of DCC stubs, which form a heterogeneous
  receptor complex with full-length DCC and are able to signal Netrin attraction.(F)
  Synaptic activity induces sequential processing of EphA4 by metalloprotease and
  γ-secretase. The protease-generated EphA4 intracellular domain (EICD) can enhance
  the formation of dendritic spines by activating the Rac signaling pathway.(G) EphB
  stimulates a metalloprotease cleavage of Ephrin-B2, producing a carboxy-terminal
  fragment that is further processed by γ-secretase to produce Ephrin-B2/CTF2. This
  fragment can activate Src-family kinases, contributing to reverse signaling. Likewise,
  EphB2 receptor is also sequentially processed by metalloprotease and γ-secretase.(H)
  Following cleavage of Robo by Kuz, Robo “stub” is eliminated by γ-secretase in cancer
  cells. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether γ-secretase cleavage of Robo also occurs
  in neurons, because Robo stubs have never been detected in PS1 mutants (Bai and
  Pfaff, unpublished observations).
