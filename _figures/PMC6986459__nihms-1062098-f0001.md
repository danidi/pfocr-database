caption: Landscape of USP7 targets and modes of action.(a) The USP7–MDM2–p53 axis.
  Under unstressed conditions, USP7 stabilizes MDM2, resulting in p53 turnover [,].
  Upon cell stress, guanosine monophosphate synthetase (GMPS) and TRIM21 dissociate
  in the cytoplasm, resulting in GMPS translocation to the nucleus [], where it disrupts
  the interaction between USP7 and MDM2. GMPS displaces MDM2 in the USP7–MDM2–P53
  complex and allosterically activates USP7. This activation both upregulates USP7’s
  deubiquitinase activity and prompts USP7 to ‘switch’ from deubiquitinating MDM2
  to deubiquitinating, and thus stabilizing, p53 [].(b) USP7 regulates transcription
  factors. When reversing polyubiquitination, USP7 confers stability. USP7 binds to
  the androgen receptor (AR), and upon stimulation with androgens, allows AR to bind
  DNA in prostate cancer []. USP7 also deubiquitinates NOTCH1, stabilizing it and
  activating the NOTCH pathway. Similarly, USP7 stabilizes many other transcription
  factors including N-myc in neuroblastoma [], c-Myc in neural stem cell fate specification
  [], FoxP3 to maintain T-regulatory cell function [], β-catenin for Wnt activation
  in colorectal cancer [], and NF-κB [] and its modulator NEK2 []. Separately, USP7’s
  reversal of monoubiquitination controls the activity of transcription factors through
  nuclear exclusion, notably for FOXO4 [] and PTEN [].
