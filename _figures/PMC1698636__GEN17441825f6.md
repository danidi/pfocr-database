caption: Model for the role of the Cdc34/SCF complex in the maintenance of cell wall
  integrity. Depicted is our model for the role of the Cdc34/SCF complex in the regulation
  of cell wall integrity. In this model, the Cdc34/SCF complex regulates Rho1 function,
  thereby affecting several pathways, including the Slt2 signaling pathway as well
  as 1,3-β-glucan synthesis. This would result in transcriptional variation of genes
  required for cell wall biogenesis and organization. Several potential Cdc34/SCF
  targets exist, which could include Rho1 or negative regulators of Rho1 such as the
  Rho1-GAPs.
