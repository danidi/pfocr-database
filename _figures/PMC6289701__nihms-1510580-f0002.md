caption: Illustration of the Pol I and Pol III epigenetic and transcriptional regulators
  functioning downstream of mTORC1. A comprehensive model describing how Pol I and
  Pol III dependent rDNA transcription, as well as Pol II transcription of RP and
  Ribi genes, is coordinated in response to mTORC1 signaling remains to be developed.
  Note that only those ribosomal transcriptional and epigenetic regulators acting
  downstream of mTORC1 and that are outlined in the text are presented here.
