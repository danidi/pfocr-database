caption: Role of SUMOylation in the regulation of Tax oncoprotein of the human T-cell
  lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV1) virus. Upon As2O3 and INFα treatment, Tax is recruited
  to PML NBs. It is then poly-SUMOylated, recognized by RNF4, poly-ubiquitylated,
  and degraded by the proteasome. Another involvement of SUMOylation in the regulation
  of Tax was shown upon DNA damage, where its RNF4-dependant ubiquitylation triggers
  its cytosolic translocation. This leads to the activation of the NFκB pathway, probably
  thanks to its ability to bind to and activate NEMO and the IKK complex.
