caption: A novel mechanism linking ROS/Src/caveolin-mediated activation of the EGFR-ERK
  signaling pathway to chronic Ang II exposure-induced EMT in cultured renal tubular
  epithelial cells. Our studies utilizing the renal proximal tubular epithelial cells
  expressing functioning AT1 receptors suggest that binding of Ang II to the seven-transmembrane
  G-protein-coupled AT1 receptor activates metalloproteinase (Mpase)-dependent release
  of soluble HB-EGF, a natural EGFR ligand that binds and transactivates EGFR, as
  we have recently documented (), resulting in acute signaling leading to ERK activation;
  such ligand-activated ERK signaling diminishes within 1 h (, , and C). The transient
  nature of this EGFR-ERK signaling is presumably due to the quick endocytosis of
  the ligand (HB-EGF)-activated EGFR through clathrin-coated pits, followed by degradation
  through the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (, ). Meanwhile, Ang II activation of AT1
  receptors also leads to transactivation of EGFR through ROS-dependent Src kinase
  activation, which phosphorylates both caveolin-1 (Cav) at Y14 and EGFR at Y845,
  thus inducing association of EGFR with Cav and the adaptor proteins SHC and GRB2,
  resulting in prolonged EGFR-ERK signaling. In the case of chronic Ang II exposure,
  such prolonged signaling activity persists in the epithelial cells, leading to alterations
  in gene expression and consequently eliciting a phenotypic change to EMT.
