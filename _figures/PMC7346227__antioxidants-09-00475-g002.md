caption: Primary cilia control Hedgehog pathway output. (a) In the OFF mode, Hh ligands
  are absent and their receptor PTCH1 accumulates inside cilia, keeping SMO outside.
  GPR161, a constitutively active Gs protein-coupled receptor, promotes ciliary production
  of cAMP, which activates protein kinase A (PKA) at the ciliary base. PKA then phosphorylates
  GLI2 and GLI3, the transcription factors mediating Hh pathway output. Both factors
  interact with their repressor SUFU, with which they travel to and from the ciliary
  tip. Such travel is required for PKA-dependent regulation of GLI2 and GLI3. Phosphorylation
  by PKA primes GLI2 and GLI3 for phosphorylation by casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). For GLI3, this leads to ubiquitination by the Cul1-βTrCP
  (cullin1-β-transducin repeats-containing protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent
  proteasome-dependent partial proteolytic cleavage to release SUFU and form GLI3R,
  a transcriptional repressor. GLI2 can also be processed into GLI2R, but this is
  inefficient because GLI2, unlike GLI3, lacks a processing-determinant domain (PDD).
  Thus, most phosphorylated GLI2 remains SUFU-bound and inactive. When cilia are absent
  or dysfunctional, unstimulated cells cannot form GLI3R, and thus its target genes
  are derepressed. This is the molecular mechanism underlying certain manifestations
  of ciliopathies, like polydactyly. (b) In the ON mode, Hh ligands like SHH bind
  PTCH1, removing it from cilia and enabling ciliary accumulation and activation of
  SMO. This leads to GPR161 ciliary exit, which stops cAMP synthesis and prevents
  PKA activation. In the absence of PKA phosphorylation, GLI3 is fully degraded by
  the proteasome via Cul3-SPOP (Cullin3-Speckle-type POZ protein)-dependent ubiquitination,
  whereas GLI2 is no longer prevented from ridding itself of SUFU at the ciliary tip
  and turning into the GLI2A transcriptional activator. Both GLI2 and GLI3 strongly
  accumulate at the ciliary tip under these conditions. In the nucleus, lack of GLI3R
  and presence of GLI2A leads to activation of Hh target genes such as PTCH1 and GLI1,
  which exert negative and positive pathway feedback, respectively. Other Hh target
  genes are cell type-specific, such as SHH and FOXJ1, which are induced in the floor
  plate of the embryonic neural tube by notochord-derived SHH ligand [,].
