caption: Model for signaling events involved in PKCϵ-mediated survival in LNCaP cells.
  PKCϵ is implicated both in the modulation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic
  cascades in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. PKCδ and PKCϵ have opposite effects on
  TNFα release and the subsequent activation of TNFα receptor signaling. Additionally,
  PKCϵ operates downstream of this death receptor by regulating JNK activation. PKCϵ
  also modulates the apoptotic intrinsic cascade through phosphorylation (and inactivation)
  of proapoptotic Bad.
