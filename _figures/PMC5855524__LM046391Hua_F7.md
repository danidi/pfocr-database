caption: A hypothesized schematic model of synaptic mechanisms underlying mate recognition
  and selective gating of the pregnancy-blocking signals in the mouse AOB. See Discussion
  for details. (α2) α2-adrenergic receptor, (AP) action potential, (EPSC) excitatory
  postsynaptic current, (G) G protein, (GC) granule cell, (Glu) glutamate, (MC) mitral
  cell, (NA) noradrenaline, (NMDAR) NMDA receptor, (VGCC) voltage-gated calcium channel.
  The signaling pathway that inhibits Glu release is marked by an encircled “–.”
