caption: Working model of N transport and metabolism in the symbiosis between plant
  roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. N moves (black arrows) from the soil into
  the fungal ERM, through a series of metabolic conversion reactions into Arg, which
  is transported into the IRM within the root (host) and there is broken down; N is
  transferred to and assimilated by the host as ammonia. Red circles refer to the
  sites of action of the genes identified and analyzed in this study. Blue arrows
  indicate mechanisms hypothesized to regulate gene expression by N metabolites involved
  in the pathway.
