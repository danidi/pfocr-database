caption: 'Phosphorylation of DLP1 and their effects on mitochondrial morphology and
  mitochondrial and cellular functions in cardiomyocytes: (A) DLP1 phosphorylation
  at S616 and S637 and their potential upstream signaling under AR stimulation. The
  upstream AR subtype(s) of each enzyme is(are) also shown. Dotted lines indicate
  the pathways reported in non-cardiac cells, but not yet tested in CMs. PP2A, Protein
  phosphatase 2; CaN, calcineurin. (B) Schematic diagram of DLP1 phosphorylation at
  S616 and S637 by AR signaling and their effects on mitochondrial morphology as well
  as mitochondrial and cellular functions in CMs. Dotted lines indicate the pathways
  reported in non-cardiac cells. If the functional effect of the signaling pathway
  has not yet been tested in CMs, question mark “?” is shown. The effects of CaN,
  CaMKII, and PKD are extracted from the following publications [,,].'
