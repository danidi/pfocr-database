caption: Proposed evolutionary model for Archaea and Bacteria differentiation. The
  existence of a cenancestor (LUCA) embordered by a mixed membrane is one of the main
  theories of organism’s evolution. This primordial organism would be characterized
  by the presence of heterogeneous enzymes involved in the synthesis of archaeal and
  bacterial lipids. Enzyme separation occurred by environmental pressures leading
  to the differentiation of bacteria with a phospholipid biosynthetic pathway () and
  archaea with ether-lipid biosynthesis. DH, dehydrogenase; MVA, mevalonate pathway;
  aMVA, alternate mevalonate pathway; FAS, fatty acid synthesis pathway; PT, prenyltransferases;
  AT, acyltransferases; ‘a’ used as prefix for PT and AT, ancestral; CDP-AD, CDP-alcohol
  phosphatidyltransferase family of enzymes.
