caption: Role of CRPs in AIBD. Complement activation is one of the pivotal steps in
  BP development. mCD46 and CD55, two important CRPs, could inhibit autoantibody-mediated
  complement activation. Additionally, CD55 is down-regulated by TNF-α and IFN-γ though
  ERK1/2 signaling pathway in BP lesions.
