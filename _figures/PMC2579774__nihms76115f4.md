caption: 'Proteins from infected microglia co-cultured with astrocytes, separated
  by DIGE and identified by LC/MS/MS () were analyzed by dynamic pathway modeling.
  The pathways showed significant correlations with networks associated with cell
  death and DNA replication, recombination and repair. Line types show the interactions
  between proteins: Lines with arrows stand for direct acting and lines without arrows
  represent protein binding only. Solid lines show direct interactions, while broken
  lines indicate indirect interactions. Shapes and colors represent functional classification
  nodes. Functions are indicated by shapes: diamonds for enzymes, squares for cytokines,
  rectangles for ligand-dependant nuclear factors, triangles for kinases, ovals for
  transcription regulators, trapezoids for transporters, and circles for miscellaneous
  interactions. Nodes of red color represent microglial proteins, which are up-regulated
  upon HIV-1 infection, while green nodes represent down-regulated proteins. Nodes
  without color represent proteins not input by user, but interpreted by the database
  as high probable interactions within the network. The abbreviations for the up-
  and down-regulated proteins are: (Red) CKB, creatine kinase B; GLUL: glutamine synthetase;
  GM2A, GM2 ganglioside activator protein; HSPA9, HSP70 protein (heat shock 70 kDa
  protein 9); LDHB, L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain; NAP1L1, nucleosome assembly protein
  1-like 1; PPP4R2, protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 2; PRDX6, peroxiredoxin
  6; TKT, transketolase. (Green) CNBP, cellular nucleic-acid binding protein; ENO1,
  enolase-alpha; FTL1, ferritin light chain 1; PKM2, pyruvate kinase isozyme M2; RPLP2,
  60S acidic ribosomal protein P2.'
