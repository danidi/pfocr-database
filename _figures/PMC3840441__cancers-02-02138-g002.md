caption: 'Glucose and glutamine metabolism in pancreatic tumors: hypothesis. Metabolic
  stress occurring in pancreatic tumor cells submitted to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation
  participate to selection of cancer cells harboring oncogenic mutations and activation
  of HIF-1α. The intimate connection between oncogenes and HIF-1α allows increased
  uptake of glucose and glutamine. Glucose will be processed through glycolysis to
  provide precursors for nucleic acids (through the pentose phosphate pathway), to
  produce pyruvate and ATP. Depending on oxygen availability in tumor cells, pyruvate
  gives either precursors for lipid and amino acid synthesis and ATP through the TCA
  cycle (oxidative phosphorylation) or gives lactate and alanine secreted by the tumor.
  Liver uptakes this pool of lactate and alanine to produce glucose used by the tumor
  (gluconeogenesis). Cancer cells surrounding blood vessels can also use lactate secreted
  by hypoxic cells as the principal substrate for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  (tumor symbiosis). Glutamine metabolism through the TCA cycle participates in lipid
  and amino acid synthesis, produces some of the pyruvate pool and ATP, giving secreted
  NH3 (ammonia) used by muscles to build up glutamine pools used by the tumor. Proteolysis
  occurring in muscles to produce glutamine is ATP consuming, occurs to the detriment
  of muscle mass and is responsible for cachexia.'
