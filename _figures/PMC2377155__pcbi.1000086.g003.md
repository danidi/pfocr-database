number: Figure 3
caption: A representative integrated module in S. cerevisiae, the high osmolarity
  glycerol (HOG) pathway, is illustrated. Signaling reactions appear in the upper
  left of the figure, metabolic reactions in the upper right, and regulatory reactions
  in the bottom. The components and reactions within these networks are based on published
  literature on the S. cerevisiae HOG pathway. Detailed components and reactions are
  presented in .
