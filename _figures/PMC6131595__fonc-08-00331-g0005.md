caption: Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. Lactate transport is crucial in
  the crossed-regulation of metabolism between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
  and cancer cells. In the fibroblasts close to carcinoma cells, ROS, HIF-1α, and
  NF-κB induce glycolysis, downregulating CAV1 and upregulating MCT4, which results
  in increased lactate secretion in CAFs. Conversely, TIGAR overexpression in carcinoma
  cells alters their metabolic state, increasing the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  Lactate released from CAFs is taken by cancer cells via MCT1 and converted to pyruvate,
  which can enter the TCA cycle. These cancer cells have high mitochondrial OXPHOS
  and low glycolysis, which is associated with high proliferation and low apoptosis
  rates, resulting in increased tumor growth.
