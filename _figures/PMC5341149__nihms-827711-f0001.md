caption: An example of a tree (dmax = 3) generated using the regulatory interactions
  derived from pathway databases for a sample gene PPP3CA. Node types are denoted
  as Genes (ovals), Protein complexes (rectangles), gene families (pentagon), abstract
  concepts (hexagon). The edges are colored according to their regulatory function
  with protein activation (red), transcriptional regulation (blue), component of protein
  complex (black) and gene family member (grey). The root node's epigenetic and sCNA
  measurements (rounded rectangles), considered as additional regulatory parents,
  are connected by green arrows. The nodes chosen as regulators are marked () along
  with their depths.
