caption: The severe hypoxia often found at the center of a stroma-surrounded tumor.
  Gene mutations in the tumor cells have caused constitutive accumulation of HIF-1α,
  even under normoxia. The deregulated HIF-1α triggers secretion of Hsp90α via exosomal
  protein trafficking pathway. The secreted Hsp90α binds, via F-5 epitope, to cell
  surface LRP-1 receptor and promotes motility and invasion of tumor cells in an autocrine
  fashion. While current clinical trials focus on intracellular Hsp90α, we propose
  that drugs that target the F-5 region of secreted Hsp90α are more effective and
  safer in treatment of cancer patients (Modified with permission from ).
