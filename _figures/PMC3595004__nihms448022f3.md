caption: 'Schematic representation of the diverse regulatory systems that modulate
  T6S expression and activation in assorted bacteria. Only those regulatory pathways
  emphasized in this review are depicted. Pathways are labeled A–E corresponding to
  the order of their presentation in the text. (A) Fur represses T6S transcription
  in the presence of iron. (B) bEBPs function in conjunction with σ54 to activate
  T6S transcription. (C) The TPP posttranslationally activates T6S in response to
  surface association. Self- and nonself-derived bacterial signals modulate T6S (D)
  posttranscriptionally through the Gac/Rsm pathway or (E) transcriptionally via quorum
  sensing. At right is a target bacterium undergoing intoxication by Tse1–3 effectors
  (e1–3). Abbreviations: TPP, threonine phosphorylation pathway; bEBP, bacterial enhancer
  binding protein; T6S, type VI secretion.'
