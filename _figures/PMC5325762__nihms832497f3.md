caption: ATM is activated in response to DSBs and repairs damaged DNA through homologous
  recombination (HR). DSBs breaks are sensed by the MRN (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) complex,
  which recruits and activates ATM through direct interaction with NBS1. Activated
  ATM in turn phosphorylates numerous downstream targets (p), including H2AX (γ),
  in turn providing a docking site for the binding of MDC1. MDC1 recruits the ubiquitin
  ligases RNF8/RNF168, which ubiquitylate (u) H2A/H2AX and promotes the recruitment
  of other DNA repair factors, including 53BP1 and BRCA1. ATM signaling to Chk2, p53
  and the p38/MK2 kinase complex facilitates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, or
  apoptosis of the damage is too extensive.
