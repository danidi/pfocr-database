caption: HIF-mediated gene expression in metabolic reprogramming. (A) Metabolic reprogramming
  during embryogenesis results in a shift in bioenergetic metabolism (ATP demand away
  from mitochondria OXPHOS to a dependence on glucose utilization through glycolysis
  pathways). These reprogramming changes are driven by physical isolation from atmospheric
  O2 and the resultant activation of heterodimeric O2-sensing bHLH-PAS nuclear transcription
  factors belonging to the family of HIFs. During conditions of normoxia, O2 is able
  to bind to the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), which then hydroxylates HIF-1α at
  two positions, allowing the binding of von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein
  (VHL) and activation of ubiquitin-mediated HIF-1α protein degradation. This action
  prevents HIF-mediated gene expression by removing the transcription factor from
  the cytosol. Under conditions of hypoxia, HIF-1α is allowed to accumulate and it
  is translocated to the nucleus where it combines with its heterodimerization partner,
  HIF-1β/ARNT, and binds to the HRE (5′-ACGTG-3′) to induce the expression of hundreds
  of genes. (B) The metabolic reprogramming that occurs in developing cells and tissues
  in response to moderate/severe hypoxia allows the developing conceptus to thrive
  in normally hostile conditions. Induced expression of HIF target genes (shown in
  orange/red fonts) shows that the transition to glycolysis dominated bioenergetics
  along with several other beneficial consequences. With metabolic reprogramming comes
  increases in glucose uptake/transport, upregulation of all 10 enzymes in the glycolysis
  pathway, increased pentose phosphate pathway activity and NADPH synthesis, inhibition
  of TCA cycle and mitochondrial ETC function, altered transcriptional controls, and
  the modulation of many other pathways, including hexosamine biosynthesis, phospholipid
  biosynthesis, nucleotide synthesis, and one-carbon metabolism. This representation
  of HIF-upregulated genes in metabolic reprogramming is not complete and should not
  be viewed as a comprehensive list [Figure based, in part, from Dengler et al. ()].
