caption: The physiological effect of IRP2 deficiency in vivo. IRP2 is the predominant
  IRP protein in erythroblasts and neurons. According to intracellular iron status,
  IRP2 protein levels are regulated by the FBXL5-dependent proteasomal degradation
  pathway. By binding to the IREs in target transcripts of iron metabolism genes,
  IRP2 increases the expression of iron importers TfR1 and DMT1, and decreases the
  expression of the iron storage protein, ferritin, the iron exporter FPN1, and some
  iron utilization-related genes including ACO2 and eALAS, as well as other potential
  target genes, to maintain optimal intracellular iron levels. In erythroblasts, IRP2
  deficiency decreases the expression of TfR1, resulting in insufficient import of
  iron by the Tf/TfR1 cycle to support heme biosynthesis, and derepresses eALAS expression,
  leading to protoporphyrin IX accumulation and microcytic hypochromic anemia. In
  neurons, IRP2 deficiency decreases the expression of the iron importer TfR1 and
  increases the expression of the ferritin. The accumulation of iron by ferritin depletes
  biologically available iron from the cytosol and leads to functional iron deficiency,
  mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal degradation.
