caption: Schematic of what could have been the beginnings of biochemistry. Main steps
  of core intermediary metabolism starting from CO2 and H2, showing key intermediates
  in the acetyl CoA pathway, reverse incomplete Krebs cycle, reductive amination,
  gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The precursors for nucleotide
  synthesis are boxed in red. Reactions shown in blue have been partially or completely
  achieved under prebiotic conditions. R denotes biological cofactors such as tetrahydrofolate;
  prebiotic equivalents could include mineral surfaces. Acetyl phosphate can phosphorylate
  ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation in bacteria and archaea, and under prebiotic
  conditions. Ribose phosphate is the precursor for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate,
  used in all nucleotide synthesis. Importantly, CO2 and H2 equivalents are required
  at multiple steps
