caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify the forty-five BAFF-
  and/or APRIL-related genes represented on the microarray. BAFF and APRIL (yellow
  marked genes) were found to interact with many genes that are involved in regulating
  apoptosis, transcription, the immune response and signal transduction. Among these
  genes, the T helper 1 (Th1)-related genes, such as IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-27 and TNF (namely,
  TNF-α), were identified to interact with BAFF and/or APRIL. These genes are presented
  by their common abbreviated names. According to their direct (solid lines) or indirect
  (dashed lines) action, these genes can establish contacts with BAFF and/or APRIL.
  Lines ending in black arrows indicate an activation pathway, and those ending in
  white arrows represent a translocation process. Lines joining two genes indicate
  binding.
