caption: '(i) ROS is a major by-product of aerobic metabolism and plays a dual role
  in cancer cell life-cycle: below a certain threshold, increasing amounts of ROS
  promotes cell proliferation through pathways of extracellular-signal-regulated kinases
  (ERKs) and cell survival factors such as Akt. However, ROS leads to cell apoptosis
  when its concentration is over the toxic threshold. Additionally, ROS may play a
  function in up-regulating HIF-1 expression, which in turn results in increasing
  the production of angiogenesis factor VEGF. (ii) GSH (glutathione) is the most abundant
  antioxidant produced by cancer cells to protect themselves from oxidative stress;
  it can remove ROS (mostly ) with the help of enzyme . (iii) Large amount of hydrogen
  ions are produced as a consequence of glucose metabolism, and are pumped out by
  abnormally expressed proton transporters. There is evidence indicating that acidic
  extracellular environment induces VEGF production through the ERK/MAPK signaling
  pathway.'
