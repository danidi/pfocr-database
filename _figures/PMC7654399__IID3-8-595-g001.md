caption: 'MIR17HG targets in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune
  disease featured by increased production of autoantibodies that are specific for
  self‐antigens, resulting in a wide range of clinical presentations. A, The miR‐17‐92
  host gene family enclose a cluster of six microRNAs (miR‐17, miR‐18a, miR‐19a, miR‐20a,
  miR‐19b‐1, and miR‐92a‐1). Functional enrichment pathway analysis using Diana lab
  tools (http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php) revealed that
  these miRNAs could target at least 18 genes in the SLE pathway (KEGG ID: hsa05322,
  P = 1.179199e−43). B, The miR‐17‐92 cluster‐targeted genes (red‐colored boxes) code
  for the different histone family members (ie, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), which are implicated
  in autoantigen clearance and tolerance mechanism and the major histocompatibility
  complex class II (MHCII), which is implicated in antigen presentation mediated by
  MHCII. All the previous stages of antigen processing and autoantibodies generation
  lead to tissue injury and end‐organ damage, (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html).
