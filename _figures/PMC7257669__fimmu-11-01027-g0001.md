caption: 'Metabolic abnormalities is the underlying mechanism of Th17/Treg imbalance
  in SLE patients. Th17 and Treg cells have a distinct metabolic pattern: pentose
  phosphate pathway, glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and glutaminolysis are preferentially
  increased in Th17 cells, while fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation
  are active in Treg cells. However, metabolic abnormalities of T cells in SLE patients,
  including enhanced glycolysis, active lipid synthesis, increased glutaminolysis,
  and high mTOR activation, are all conducive to Th17 differentiation and function.
  For this reason, we speculated that abnormal T cell metabolism was the mechanism
  underlying Th17/Treg imbalance in SLE patients. The intervention of metabolic pathways
  to reprogram T cell metabolic patterns in SLE patients, reduce their overactivated
  glycolysis and lipid synthesis levels, and promote the oxidation of fatty acids,
  is expected to reverse the Treg/Th17 imbalance in patients and restore their normal
  immune function.'
