caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed proteins: network
  interaction for brain (a and b) and cerebellar (c) proteins. Diagrams show focus
  genes (the identified proteins found differentially expressed) that are depicted
  in green (downregulated) or red (upregulated). Solid and dashed connecting lines
  indicate the presence of direct and indirect interactions, respectively. Modulatory
  roles of proteins and/or endogenous chemicals on the expression of other proteins
  are indicated by arrows'
