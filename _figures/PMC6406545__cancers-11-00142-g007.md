caption: Schematic model of the network of gene expression co-regulation by stress
  during tumoral progression. During tumor progression, the stress zone encompasses
  the growing tumor, but also its microenvironment. The neo vessels and more particularly
  the Tip cells, present at the extremity and which guide the neo vessels towards
  the tumor, are located in this unfavorable microenvironment. Hypoxia, nutrient starvation
  and acidosis will irremediably induce the accumulation of unfolded protein in the
  reticulum of cells located in this area, leading to ER stress and UPR activation.
  Thus, in addition to transcriptional regulations, the activation of the PERK pathway
  will induce the co-regulation of an UPR dependent gene network containing IRES elements,
  revealing a translational regulon in which the synthesis of a cohort of angiogenic
  related genes is activated in response to ER stress. The fine-tuning of gene expression
  allows an efficient control of angiogenesis, which is a highly regulated process.
