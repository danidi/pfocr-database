caption: 'Proposed vitamin B6pathway in E. coli and S. meliloti. Abbreviations: GcolAD,
  glycolaldehyde; Gly, glycine; Pyr, pyruvate; GcerADP, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  GcerAD, d-glyceraldehyde. The 4PHT-1, 4PHT-2, DXP-1, DXP-2, and final pathways are
  pathways that result in the synthesis of 4PHT from E4P (E. coli), the synthesis
  of 4PHT from glycolaldehyde and glycine via 4HT (S. meliloti), the synthesis of
  DXP from pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (E. coli), the synthesis of DXP
  from pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde via DX (S. meliloti), and the synthesis of PNP
  from 4PHT and DXP, respectively; these pathways are indicated by the areas enclosed
  by the dashed lines.'
