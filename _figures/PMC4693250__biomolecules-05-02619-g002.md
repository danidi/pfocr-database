caption: A proposed model for Parkin-dependent and-independent mitophagy and mitochondrial
  spheroid formation in alcohol-induced mitochondrial damage and liver injury. In
  ethanol-exposed hepatocytes, ethanol is metabolized by hepatic enzymes that lead
  to an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio and subsequent mitochondrial damage. Ethanol induces
  Parkin translocation from cytosol to a depolarized mitochondrion, which is likely
  mediated by stabilization of the mitochondrial protein kinase PINK1 on the depolarized
  mitochondrion. Parkin then ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins,
  which further recruits autophagy receptor proteins such as p62 to the damaged mitochondrion
  and triggers selective mitophagy. Meanwhile, ethanol also activates HIF and FoxO3a
  transcription factors resulting in increased expression of the two atypical BH-3
  domain containing proteins BNIP3 and NIX, which might also serve as selective mitophagy
  receptors by directly interacting with the autophagy protein LC3 to recruit autophagosomes
  to damaged mitochondria independent of Parkin. In the absence of the nuclear receptor
  FXR, ethanol also induces formation of mitochondrial spheroids, which may also serve
  as an alternative mitochondrial quality control pathway to protect against alcohol-induced
  liver injury. In general, mitophagy protects against alcohol-induced liver injury
  and steatosis by removing damaged mitochondria and improving adaptive capacity of
  mitochondria to stress. Modulating Parkin-dependent and-independent mitophagy may
  be a promising avenue for preventing and treating ALD.
