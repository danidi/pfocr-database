caption: 'Sex-differential regulatory network. a Example of SNP–DMP–Gene groups. There
  are 12 SNP–DMP–Gene groups in this region on Chromosome 14: 24,895,387–24,912,111,
  involving two SNPs, five DMPs and three genes. The diagram shows the location of
  them while the cartoon diagram shows their relationship. The gray line represents
  meQTLs with FDR < 0.05. The blue lines represent negative correlation and red lines
  represent positive correlations. b Example of sex-differential PPI subnetworks.
  Every node represents a gene. The color of nodes represents differential methylation
  levels in corresponding promoters (Yellow: hypermethylated in the female; Blue:
  hypomethylated in female). The edges were built based on the protein-protein interaction
  in Pathway Common. The width of the edge is the estimation of effect sizes. Stars
  represent the candidate genes (Green: ASD candidate genes, Red: SCZ candidate genes,
  Purple: both ASD and SCZ candidate genes)'
