caption: Cancer cells are characterized by the “Warburg effect” wherein the cells
  use greatly increased levels of glucose (indicated by the black arrows throughout
  the diagram). One consequence of increased glucose utilization by cancer cells is
  increased production of UDP-GlcNAc, which promotes cancer progression by several
  complementary glycan-based mechanisms including (1) O-GlcNAc protein modification,
  (2) production of mucin-type O-glycans such as those that decorate MUC1, (3) activation
  of GlcNAc transferases 4 and 5, which produce highly-branched N-glycans linked to
  cancer including through promotion of EGFR signaling, and (4) sialic acid biosynthesis
  via ManNAc production. In all of these cases, lower glucose uptake found naturally
  in normal cells or induced by nutrient deprivation in cancer cells is expected to
  reduce UDP-GlcNAc levels and attenuate these cancer-promoting mechanisms (as indicated
  schematically by the smaller blue arrows). Supplementation of nutrient-deprived
  cells with sialic acids (e.g., either Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc, bottom) leads to several
  plausible outcomes that can counteract the effects of nutrient deprivation and maintain
  the production of cancer-promoting glycans (indicated with the green arrows) including
  (A) direct incorporation into cellular glycans, (B) catabolism to ManNAc, which
  can be re-used for sialic acid production (not shown) or conversion to GlcNAc. In
  turn, GlcNAc can (C) be salvaged by the HBP and used to replenish cellular supplies
  of UDP-GlcNAc or (D) be routed into a pathway that creates fructose-6-phosphate
  that can be used for energy production. Specific endpoints investigated in this
  report are highlighted in yellow.
