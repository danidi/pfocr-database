caption: A simplified scheme of the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 inside the host cell
  (with organ injury in COVID-19). (1) SARS-CoV-2 requires activation by the serine
  protease TMPRSS2 for optimal cell entry and the viral Spike glycoprotein of the
  virion binds to the cellular receptor ACE2 and enters target cells through an endosomal
  pathway. (2) Following the entry of the virus into the host cell, the viral RNA
  is released into cytoplasm. (3) After release of the viral genome the viral polymerase
  protein is translated from the genomic RNA. (4) Replication occurs and new ssRNA(+)
  are synthesized. (5) In transcription, a nested set of sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs)
  is produced (6) Viral structural proteins (S, E, and M) are translated from the
  RNA inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, N in citoplasm and move to the endoplasmic
  reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. (7) The viral proteins formed in ER migrate
  to the Golgi apparatus and are assembled with the nucleocapsid. (8) Formation of
  mature virion. Finally, (9) the virions are released via the constitutive exocytic
  pathway out of the cell. In the SARS-CoV-2 infection multi-organ are injured in
  COVID-19 patients. S, spike protein; E, envelope protein; M, membrane protein; N,
  nucleocapsid protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. This figure was created using Servier
