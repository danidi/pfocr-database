caption: 'Cancer cells use glucose-derived metabolites for biosynthesis to support
  uncontrolled cell proliferation. Intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate enter
  the pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate is converted to lactate. Cancer stem
  cells are quiescent by contrast and use glucose-derived pyruvate for mitochondrial
  metabolism. The reason behind this metabolic shift is unclear. We propose that it
  is used for the synthesis of bioactive signalling molecules. TCA: Tricarboxylic
  acid cycle.'
