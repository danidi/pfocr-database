caption: 'Model for the regulation of BMI1 on androgen receptor independently of PRC1.
  Besides its PRC1-dependent role (canonical pathway) as a transcriptional repressor,
  BMI1 also has a PRC1-independent role (noncanonical pathway) as a transcriptional
  activator: BMI1 stabilizes AR and activates AR-signaling pathway via competitively
  inhibiting MDM2-induced ubiquitination and degradation of AR in PCa'
