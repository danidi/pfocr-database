caption: Yeast vacuoles as an example of an acidocalcisome-like organelle. The polyphosphate
  polymerase VTC transfers inorganic phosphate (Pi) into vacuoles by converting it
  into polyphosphate (polyP) and translocating it across the membrane. Here, the lumenal
  polyphosphatases can convert polyP back into Pi, which can be re-exported into the
  cytosol through Pho91. Apart from polyP, yeast vacuoles actively accumulate many
  other compounds that are typical of acidocalcisomes, such as Ca2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and
  basic amino acids. Examples of the involved transporters are shown in the illustration.
