caption: 'Proposed signaling pathway of the purinergic receptor: regulation of cardiac
  autonomic activity. Activation of the G protein–coupled P2 purinergic receptor leads
  to dissociation of α and βγ subunits. α activates Fyn, whereas βγ stimulates PI3Kγ.
  Tec is then transphosphorylated by Fyn. This leads to phosphorylation and membrane
  translocation of PLCγ. PIP3, the product of PI3K, facilitates the anchor of both
  Tec and PLCγ. The latter is fully activated, generating IP3, which regulates the
  autonomic activity of the cardiomyocyte.'
