caption: Metabolic pathways that distinguish alloreactive and syngeneic T cells. T
  cells isolated from allogeneic recipients have a unique metabolic profile including
  a greater increase in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (,
  , ). While various carbon sources contribute to this increased oxidative metabolism,
  including glucose (, ) and fatty acids (), the relative contribution of each substrate
  remains to be determined. Glutaminolysis and the PPP are also preferentially upregulated
  in alloreactive T cells, as is activation of the AMPK and mTOR pathways (, , ).
  Because T cell metabolism is a dynamic process, this figure represents known or
  suspected metabolic activity in donor T cells on day 7 post-transplant. The relative
  contribution of each pathway is likely to change over time as discussed in the text.
