caption: Schematic diagram depicting the KRT19-mediated regulation of NUMB expression,
  NOTCH signaling pathway and cancer/cancer stem-like cells (CSLC) properties in KRT19-overexpressing
  breast cancer cells. (a) KRT19 directly interacts with the β-catenin-RAC1 complex
  and stabilizes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. This
  increases the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, enhancing NUMB expression in the
  process, which downregulates NOTCH signaling, its target genes, and consequently,
  cell proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and sphere formation.
  Patient-derived CD133high/CXCR4high/ALDH1high KU-CSLCs, which showed significantly
  reduced KRT19 expression, (b) displayed highly enhanced CSLC properties.
