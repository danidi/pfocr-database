caption: Model proposing how inflammasome components coordinate autophagy and pyroptosis
  as macrophage responses to infection. The following working model interprets cellular
  microbiology data presented here in the context of the current NLR literature cited
  in Discussion. (A) In resting macrophages, NLRC4 is complexed with autophagy component
  Beclin-1/Atg6, inhibiting autophagy. (B) In response to low levels of contamination,
  flagellin-bound NAIP5 recruits NLRC4 to a complex with pro-caspase-1 protein, derepressing
  autophagy, a cytoprotective disposal pathway. (C) When the capacity of autophagy
  to eliminate cytosolic contaminants is exceeded, an increase in the number and/or
  stability of inflammasome complexes activates sufficient caspase-1 to orchestrate
  pyroptosis, a programmed cell death that eliminates the pathogen’s protected niche
  while initiating an inflammatory response.
