caption: Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 signaling pathways involved
  in tumorigenesis and cardiac survival. (A) In breast cancer cells, HER dimer formation
  results in cross-phosphorylation of the dimer tyrosine kinase domain and leads to
  the initiation of mitogenic cell signaling pathways, including activation of the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  pathways []. While the HER2 to HER3 heterodimer is considered the most potent HER
  dimer with respect to strength of interaction, ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation,
  and downstream signaling, other dimer pairs do show weak mitogenic activity [].
  Blocking HER2 signaling with trastuzumab [] or HER2 dimerization with pertuzumab
  [] prevents activation of the signaling pathways that mediate cell proliferation
  and survival. (B) In cardiac myocytes, activation of cardiac stress pathways results
  in release of neuregulin that stimulates the formation of HER2:HER4 and HER4:HER4
  dimers. These activate downstream signaling pathways, resulting in the promotion
  of cardiomyocyte growth and cardiac repair mechanisms [–]. However, under conditions
  of HER2 inhibition, the homeostatic cardioprotection afforded by the activation
  of these downstream pathways may be attenuated, resulting in vulnerability to cardiac
  stress. (C) Anthracycline exposure exerts direct cytotoxicity against cardiac myocytes,
  resulting in the cardiotoxic effects of these agents. Activation of the stress pathway
  described in panel B may afford some protection from the cytotoxic effects of anthracycline
  exposure. However, it is possible that HER2 inhibition in the presence of anthracycline
  stress may further attenuate the innate cardioprotective mechanisms by preventing
  the induction of HER2:HER4-mediated stimulation of cardiomyocyte growth and cardiac
  repair mechanisms, thus limiting the capacity for cardiac repair. Therefore, inhibition
  of HER2 dimerization in association with anthracycline therapy can exacerbate anthracycline-induced
  cardiac damage [, ].
