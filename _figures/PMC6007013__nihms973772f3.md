caption: Proposed model shows a possible role of cdk5 in Rohon-Beard neuron differentiation.
  Cdk5 stabilizes p27Kip by phosphorylating it in mammalian cells. On the other hand,
  in Xenopus, p27Kip has been shown to stabilize Ngn1 protein leading to neuronal
  differentiation. Ngn1 is known to induce NeuroD. This model is presented with an
  established pathway, in which inhibition of Notch signaling is known to promote
  RB neuron generation via upregulation of Ngn1 and subsequently, neuroD
