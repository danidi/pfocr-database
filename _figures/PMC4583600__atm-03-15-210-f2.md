caption: Cell biology functions and pathways of the genes involved in melanoma susceptibility.
  In red all proteins encoded by known high risk melanoma susceptibility genes. (A)
  CDKN2A encodes two different proteins p16INK4a and p14ARF. p16INK4a is an inhibitor
  of the cyclinD1/CDK4 complex and induces the arrest of the cell cycle. When p16INK4a
  can perform its function correctly, if a cell is damaged it can induce senescence.
  However when CDKN2A is mutated, the cyclinD1/CDK4 complex is not inhibited and phosphorylated
  pRb, releasing E2F transcription factor that can induce a cell cycle progression.
  If a cell is damaged the release of E2F can favor an aberrant proliferation that
  can lead to tumor development. In the same way, when CDK4 is mutated, p16INK4a cannot
  interact with it and cannot inhibit the release of E2F. p14ARF in front of a damaged
  cell induces apoptosis through the p53 pathway. If p14ARF is mutated, MDM2 can promote
  p53 ubiquitination and p53 is degraded in the proteasome. Thus when a cell is damaged,
  the lack of activation of p53 can allow that cell to avoid apoptosis (). (B) BAP1
  is involved mainly in epigenetic and gene transcription regulation interacting with
  multiple partners (). When BAP1 is mutated it cannot properly do its activity and
  this can lead to a dysregulation of gene transcription that can alter the proliferation
  controls. BAP1 has a tumor suppressor role, thus when a cell is damaged, mutant
  BAP1 cells can start proliferating in an aberrant way that can lead to the development
  of a tumor. (C) Telomeres form a protective structure at the ends of the chromosome
  (T-loop) that is covered by the shelterin complex (TERF2IP, TERF1, TERF2, TINF2,
  ACD and POT1). This complex also mediates the interaction between telomeres and
  the telomerase (TERT). Shelterin binds to the telomere through TERF1 and TERF2.
  POT1 binding to the single-stranded DNA overhang prevents access of telomerase to
  telomeres. When POT1 is unbound, the telomerase is able to extend telomeres. Furthermore
  when the telomeres are unprotected by the shelterin complex senescence and apoptosis
  can be induced. Mutations in genes lead to telomere dysregulation and can be involved
  in the development of a tumor when the cells are damaged (-,-). CDKN2A, cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor 2A; CDK4, cyclin-dependent kinase 4; BAP1, Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)
  associated protein 1; POT1, protection of telomeres 1.
