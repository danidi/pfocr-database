caption: (A) In mammalian cells, iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1/2) are activated
  in response to iron deficiency. Under iron-replete conditions, IRP1 contains an
  iron-sulfur cluster and functions as a cytosolic aconitase, and IRP2 is degraded
  by the proteosome. In low iron, IRP1 is activated by losing its iron-sulfur cluster
  and IRP2 protein is stabilized. IRP1/2 then bind to the iron response elements (IREs)
  in the 3’ and 5’ untranslated regions (UTR) of target mRNA. Binding to the 3’UTR
  stabilizes target mRNA of transferrin receptor (TfR1) responsible for iron uptake.
  Binding to the 5’UTR halts translation of the target mRNA, suppressing proteins
  involved in iron export (ferroportin, Fpn1) and storage (ferritin). Overall, IRP1/2
  restore cellular iron balance by increasing iron import, mobilizing stored iron,
  and reducing iron export.(B) In iron-deficient yeast, Aft1/2 transcription factors
  translocate from cytosol into the nucleus and activate transcription of the iron
  regulon, which encodes genes required for iron uptake and release from intracellular
  stores, thus effectively increasing intracellular iron content.
