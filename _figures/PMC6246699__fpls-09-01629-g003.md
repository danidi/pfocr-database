caption: 'Superpathway for citrulline biosynthesis and link to the urea cycle. (A)
  Gene expression levels in roots (R) and nodules (N) were quantified by RT-qPCR for
  D. glomerata and C. thyrsiflorus and are relative to those of the housekeeping gene
  EF-1α. Median and IQR of three biological replicates are shown. Significant differences
  between R and N are indicated by p-values based on student’s t-test with FDR multi
  comparisons correction. Y-axis is given in log10 scale. (B) Gene expression levels
  are given in the context of the pathway, calculated as the log2[FC] relative to
  those of EF-1α estimated from the mean TPM of five (D. glomerata, long arrows) and
  three (C. thyrsiflorus, short arrows with values written in bold italics) independent
  RNA preparations. Explanatory heatmap is provided. Enzymes catalyzing these steps
  include: ASN1, asparagine synthase; P5CS, glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  and glutamate-5-kinase (double function); CPS, ammonia-dependent carbamoyl phosphate
  synthetase; ASSY, argininosuccinate synthase; ARLY, argininosuccinate lyase; ARGH1,
  arginase; and OAT, ornithine aminotransferase. DUR3, high affinity plasma membrane
  urea transporter.'
