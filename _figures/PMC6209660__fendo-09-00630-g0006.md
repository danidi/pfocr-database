caption: The potential mechanism of sodium butyrate on STZ-induced type 1 diabetes.
  STZ, specifically destroys pancreatic β-cells. The damaged β-cells passively release
  HMGB1 (). At the same time, the islets are infiltrated by inflammatory cells such
  as DCs, macrophages and T cells. Naïve CD4+ T cells are differentiated into effector
  Th1 and/or Th17 cells based on their cytokine microenvironment. In addition, the
  released extracellular HMGB1 targets DCs or macrophage via the corresponding surface
  receptor(s), induces a signaling cascade and activates NF-κB pathway (), therefore
  leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 ().
  the unbalanced Th1/Th2/Th17 and proinflammatory cytokines further accelerate the
  islets inflammation and β-cells destruction and lead to the onset of type 1 diabetes.
  Sodium butyrate, as a direct HMGB1 antagonist, could down-regulate the expression
  of HMGB1 and mediate the balance of Th1/Th2/Th17 paradigm, thus attenuating type
  1 diabetes.
