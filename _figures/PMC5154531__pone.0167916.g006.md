caption: In wild-type (WT) chondrocytes, NPR3 binds CNP thereby promoting its internalization
  and degradation, and reducing its availability to bind to NPR2 to stimulate the
  MAPK signaling pathway, whose activation inhibits termination of hypertrophic chondrocytes
  (HC) and bone formation. In KYLB mice who have a homozygous Tyr209Asn NPR3 mutation,
  NPR3 is abnormally glycosylated and retained in the ER. The absence of NPR3, and
  its loss as a decoy receptor for CNP, results in a greater availability of CNP to
  bind to NPR2, leading to increased MAPK signaling and enhanced survival of hypertrophic
  chondrocytes, resulting in the lengthening of bones.
