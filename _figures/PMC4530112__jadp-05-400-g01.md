caption: MAPK pathway and mechanism of vemurafenib. (A) When extracellular growth
  factor binds to membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase, MAPK signaling pathway
  is activated to promote cell proliferation and survival. (B) V600E kinase is constitutively
  active, sustaining MAPK signaling and perpetuating cell growth in the absence of
  growth factor. (C) Vemurafenib inhibits V600E kinase, inducing apoptosis.
