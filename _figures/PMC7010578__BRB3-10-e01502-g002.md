caption: 'Cross talk between pathways related to major depressive disorder (MDD).
  The circular nodes represent pathways significantly enriched in the genes in associated
  with MDD, and each edge represents the cross talk between the two connected pathways,
  with the width corresponding to strength of the cross talk (i.e., the average of
  the Jaccard Coefficient and the Overlap Coefficient). The nodes labeled with numbers
  represent the following pathways: 1, “vascular smooth muscle contraction”; 2, “dilated
  cardiomyopathy”; 3, “estrogen signaling pathway”; 4, “gap junction”; 5, “inflammatory
  mediator regulation of TRP channels”; 6, “long‐term potentiation”; 7, “longevity
  regulated pathway‐multiple species”; 8, “Rap1 signaling pathway”; 9, “neuroactive
  ligand–receptor interaction”; 10, “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”; 11, “taste transduction”;
  12, “insulin resistance”; 13, “apoptosis”; 14, “AGE‐RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic
  complications”; and 15, “prolactin signaling pathway”'
