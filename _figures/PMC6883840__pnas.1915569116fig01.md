caption: The pathway for synthesis of PLP in E. coli. PLP can also be synthesized
  from pyridoxine by a salvage pathway. Enzymes involved in the canonical synthesis
  pathway and the salvage pathway are highlighted in red. The reaction catalyzed by
  PdxB is boxed. The points at which 3 SPs facilitated by overexpression of individual
  enzymes feed into the pathway are indicated by colored arrows. The sequence of reactions
  in SP1 is shown in . The sequences of reactions in SP2 and SP3 are not known. Overexpression
  of PdxA may facilitate an SP or just pull material through SP1 and/or SP2.
