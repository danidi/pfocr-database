caption: Crosstalk between hepatocytes, hepatic nonparenchymal cells, and ncRNA during
  the pathology of NAFLD. (1) Hepatic steatosis. Obesity and LPS from the intestine
  promote the release of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 from KCs and adipocytes,
  which interact with ligands on the hepatocyte membrane. TNF-α activates SREBP-1c
  via the JAK/STAT3/SOCS-3 pathway, which activates FASN and ACC to promote hepatic
  TG accumulation. IL-6 upregulates IL-6 and SOCS-3 by NIK/NF-κB. The FFAs released
  from the FFA pool in the adipocytes directly activate PPARγ, which upregulates SREBP-1c
  to promote TG accumulation through other pathways. IR causes liver overload of glucose
  and insulin, and glucose activates ChREBP, which not only activates FASN and ACC
  but also activates SREBP-1c. Eventually, TG overload in hepatocytes causes hepatic
  steatosis. (2) NASH. Deregulation of adipocytes causes an increase in leptin levels,
  but adiponectin levels decrease. Decreased adiponectin causes a decrease in the
  release of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 from KCs, thereby promoting inflammation.
  TG overload causes excessive mitochondrial β-oxidation, which produces large amounts
  of ROS, which causes OS, causing KCs to release large amounts of proinflammatory
  factors (TNF-α, IL-6, and TGF-β) and FasL. Upon recognition of TNF-α and FasL with
  ligands on the hepatocyte membrane, they induce the formation of a death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC), which induces hepatocyte apoptosis via the caspase pathway.
  Leptin can promote the release of TGF-β by KCs. After binding of TGF-β to ligand
  recognition on HSCs, liver fibrosis is promoted through the SMAD/Col-1 pathway.
  Lipids can induce NK and NKT release of apoptotic factors IFN-γ, FasL, and TNF-α.
  Activated NKT activates DCs, which produce IL-12 that stimulates NKT and ultimately
  aggravates inflammation and apoptosis. microRNA-373 (miR-373) reduces inflammation
  by inhibiting the AKT-mTOR-S6K signaling pathway, which inhibits IL-6 production;
  miR-7a upregulates YY1, which induces the expression of PPARγ by inhibiting the
  expression of CHOP-10, leading to the accumulation of FFAs and triglyceride, and
  finally causing NASH; MiR-130a-3p promotes the apoptosis of HSCs and inhibits the
  production of collagen by inhibiting the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway, thereby improving
  the pathological process of the liver; miR-26a improves NAFLD by partially reducing
  IL-6 expression; MiR-146a-5p inhibits the activity and proliferation of HSCs by
  downregulating Wnt1 and Wnt5a, and the amount of Col-1 is decreased, thereby inhibiting
  the occurrence of fibrosis in the progression of NAFLD; lncRNA SRA aggravates hepatic
  steatosis by reducing mitochondrial β-oxidation. lncRNA MALAT1 upregulates its target
  C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), promoting the development of inflammation
  and fibrosis in NASH; and lncRNA NONRATT013819.2 promotes fibrosis by upregulating
  the expression of lysyl oxidase (Lox).

  description: Crosstalk between hepatocytes, hepatic nonparenchymal cells, and ncRNA
    during the pathology of NAFLD. (1) Hepatic steatosis. Obesity and LPS from the

    KCs and adipocytes, which interact with ligands on the hepatocyte membrane. TNF-α
    activates SREBP-1c via the JAK/STAT3/SOCS-3 pathway, which activates FASN and

    The FFAs released from the FFA pool in the adipocytes directly activate PPARγ,

    IR causes liver overload of glucose and insulin, and glucose activates ChREBP,
    which not only activates FASN and ACC but also activates SREBP-1c. Eventually,
    TG overload in hepatocytes causes hepatic steatosis. (2) NASH. Deregulation of

    Decreased adiponectin causes a decrease in the release of the anti-inflammatory
