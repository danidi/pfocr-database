caption: Conceptual Circuit Model for How External Warming Induces and Links Sleep
  and Body CoolingSkin warming activates a pathway that runs through the spinal cord
  and is relayed by glutamatergic neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus [, ,
  ]. This activates the Nos1-positive glutamatergic neurons in MnPO-MPO whose output
  drives GABAergic neurons in both MPO and GABAergic neurons in the lateral preoptic
  (LPO) areas []. Others have demonstrated that activating glutamatergic cells in
  MnPO-MPO induces hypothermia [, ] and that GABAergic neurons in the MnPO-MPO area
  do not regulate body temperature [, ]. We suggest the MPO GABA neurons inhibit monoaminergic
  arousal pathways, such as the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, resulting
  in sleep; by contrast, the LPO GABA neurons inhibit both heat-promoting glutamatergic
  and GABAergic neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DM), resulting in body cooling
  [].
