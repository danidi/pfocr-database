caption: Hypothesized molecular pathophysiology of WS. Under situations of stress,
  such as hyperglycaemia and elevated free fatty acids levels, unfolded and misfolded
  proteins accumulate []. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane proteins sense
  the stress and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) []. The UPR may culminate
  in either an adaptive response which decreases the workload on the ER or a maladaptive
  response (as occurs in chronic hyperglycaemia or WS) which culminates in cellular
  apoptosis []. Ⓐ In healthy cells, the transmembrane protein (WFS1) complexes with
  activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6) and directs ATF-6 to ubiquitin-mediated
  proteasome degradation []. This serves to negatively regulate the UPR []. In WFS1
  deficient cells ATF-6 is no longer under negative inhibition and is permitted to
  constitutively activate genes that promote cellular apoptosis and decrease insulin
  gene expression []. Ⓑ ER calcium channels, such as the ryanodine receptor (RyR),
  but most importantly the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R), permit efflux of
  calcium from the ER to the cytosol [, ]. It is believed that increased cytoplasmic
  calcium levels activate the calcium-dependent protease, calpain-2, which promotes
  cellular apoptosis [, ]. Potential therapeutic targets include molecules which inhibit
  calcium efflux from the ER, such as dantrolene, via inhibition of the RyR [], and
  rapamycin and pioglitazone, via inhibition of IP3R []. In neuronal WS models, cytosolic
  calcium appears to be increased under resting conditions and reduced under stimulated
  conditions []. This disruption in cytoplasmic calcium homeostasis also dysregulates
  mitochondrial dynamics which leads to lower ATP levels []. This is thought to hinder
  neuronal development and survival []. Ⓒ Under periods of ER stress, pancreatic ER
  kinase (PERK), a transmembrane ER protein, becomes activated and through the action
  of protein kinase A (PKA) and cyclic-AMP (cAMP) results in the phosphorylation of
  translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) (not shown) []. This in turn results in
  increased production of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) which increases
  the expression of genes for ER stress recovery [, , ]. Furthermore, phosphorylated
  eIF2α leads to decreased overall protein synthesis and therefore to reduction in
  the ER protein load (not shown) []. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation,
  acting downstream of PERK, decreases the phosphorylation of eIF2α via the PKA/cAMP
  pathway, in order to ameliorate the decrease in protein synthesis that would otherwise
  occur (not shown) [, ]. This mechanism of action of GLP-1R activity facilitates
  a faster resumption of protein synthesis following ER stress (not shown) [, ].
