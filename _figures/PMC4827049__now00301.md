caption: (A) T cells within the tumor microenvironment and tumor draining lymph nodes
  encounter immune checkpoint inhibition through interactions with tumor cells, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Depicted is the
  expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells and myeloid-lineage
  suppressor cells engaging the PD-1 receptor on T cells leading to immune suppression.
  T cells expressing the inhibitory receptor, CTLA-4, also encounter their regulatory
  ligands expressed on myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment and lymph nodes.
  (B) The delivery of miR-138 to T cells inhibits expression of the PD-1 receptor,
  thus rendering the T cell resistant to inhibition by PD-L1 on the surface of tumor
  cells, MDSCs, or TAMs. The miR-138 mediated downregulation of the PD-1 receptor
  may allow for effective maintenance of antitumor immunity in the treated host. MiR-138
  delivery was shown to also downregulate expression of CTLA-4 and FoxP3 (not shown),
  leading to the stimulation of effective antitumor immunity in the GL261 glioma model.
