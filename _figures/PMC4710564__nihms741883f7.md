caption: IL-4 activates the signaling pathway mediated by the transcription factor,
  STAT6, promoting the transcription of genes involved in B-cell Ab class switching
  to IgE such as εGLT, IL-4R and CD23. However, RvD1 suppresses εGLT transcription
  by stabilizing the expression of Bcl-6 in B cells. Bcl-6 is a transcription repressor
  that antagonizes the activity of STAT6 only in a limited subset of genes, with stronger
  activity on εGLT promoter region compared to IL-4R or CD23. Therefore, RvD1 decreases
  B-cell Ab class switch to IgE by specifically suppressing the transcription of εGLT.
