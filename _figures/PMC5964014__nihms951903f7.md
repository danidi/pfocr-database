caption: After mechanical optic nerve injury (ONC) distinct injury signaling pathways
  appear to control somal (proximal to the site of injury) and axonal (distal to the
  site of injury) degeneration. Proximal to the site of injury a MAPK pathway that
  includes DLK/LZK and JNK2/3 activation activates the transcription factor JUN. JUN
  activation, presumably through altering the transcription of injured RGCs, leads
  to BAX activation and somal apoptosis. Also, an ER stress pathway and other factors
  have been shown to regulate RGC death after axonal injury. Axonal degeneration distal
  to the site of axonal injury is less well defined. After ONC injury, SARM1 deficiency
  lessons axonal degeneration; thus, the presence of SARM1 facilitates axonal degeneration
  presumably by consuming NAD+. The MAPK pathway, particularly the MAP2Ks (MKK4 and
  MKK7) and DLK have also been implicated in axonal degeneration. It is unclear (gray
  arrows) how important these molecules are for axonal degeneration in RGCs and whether
  they are upstream or downstream of SARM1 dependent events. “?” represents a presumed
  step(s) in the pathway that involve an unknown molecule(s).
