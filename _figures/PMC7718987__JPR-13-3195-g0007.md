caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism of action of TPN in analgesia.
  Black arrows depict promotion. Red T-bar represents inhibition. Intraplantar injection
  of CFA can activate the AKT signaling pathway in DRG neurons, promoting the expression
  of pro-inflammatory genes, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Intravenous TPN could
  inhibit Akt phosphorylation and downstream gene expression, thereby relieving pain.
  The illustration was created with BioRender (BioRender.com).
