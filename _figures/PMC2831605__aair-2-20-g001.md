caption: The proposed regulatory pathway of BRP-39 in allergic inflammation and tissue
  remodeling. Macrophages and epithelial cells are the primary cells expressing BRP-39
  in the lung after allergen sensitization and challenge. BRP-39 increases the dendritic
  cell numbers in the lung and further activates and leads to enhanced Th2 polarization.
  BRP-39 also increases Th2 cells by reduction of T cell apoptosis or increase of
  cell survival. TGF-β or other growth factors produced by Th2 cytokine stimulation
  leads to airway or alveolar remodeling. BRP-39 and Th2 cytokines such as IL-13 or
  IL-4 further contribute to the production of BRP-39 via regulation of cell death
  responses or alternative macrophage activation.
