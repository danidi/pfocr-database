caption: Schematic presentation indicating distinct mitochondrial stress mediated
  IFN-I production and its distinct contribution to disease progression in chronic
  patients with genotype C infections between rt269L and rt269I. In contrast to rt269L,
  rt269I infection in genotype C induced mitochondrial ROS production, which led to
  an increased release of oxidized DNA into the cytosols of the infected hepatocytes.
  Sensing the oxidized DNA exposed to cytosol via the cGAS-STING pathway could lead
  to IFN-I production. Enhanced INF-I production in rt269I could exert several biological
  activities. First, it can lead to the increased inhibition of HBV replication via
  the inhibition of capsid formation by HO-1 production. Second, IFN-I mediated enhanced
  expression of APOBEC3G and iNOS can lead to HBeAg negative infection and liver disease
  progression via frequent generation of preC mutations at 1896 (G to A). Thus, rt269L
  can contribute to HBeAg negative infection and disease progression in chronic patients
  infected with genotype C via mitochondrial stress mediated enhanced INF-I production.
