caption: TGF-β drives glucose flow through HBP promoting aberrant glycosylation during
  EMT. TGF-β increases glucose uptake with no changes in ATP levels, pyruvate, lactate,
  and glycogen production. During EMT we showed a decrease of protein levels and/or
  catalytic activity of G6PDH and PFK, key enzymes of the PPP, and glycolytic pathways.
  However, we showed an increase of GFAT protein levels and activity combined with
  increased UDP-GlcNAc levels, indicating that excess Glc is shunted to HBP. The activation
  of HBP induces an aberrant cell surface glycosylation and O-GlcNAcylation. We showed
  an increase of OGT and the O-GlcNAc levels with no changes of OGA levels during
  EMT. Blue, decreased protein levels; red, increased product levels and/or catalytic
  activity; violet, increased protein levels and decreased catalytic activity; orange,
  unchanged products; pink, experimentally verified; green, probable pathway taken
  by Glc.
