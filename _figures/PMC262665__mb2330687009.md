caption: Model of p38 MAP kinase regulation of G1 progression. Upon appropriate stimuli,
  the p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates several substrates involved in either activation
  of the cell cycle (cyclin D1) or inhibition of the cell cycle (p21CIP and HBP1).
  Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 results in proteosome-mediated degradation and decreased
  protein levels (). By contrast, phosphorylation of p21CIP () and HBP1 (this work)
  result in protection from proteosome-mediated degradation and increased protein
  levels. These observations suggest that the p38 MAP kinase may control a network
  of G1regulatory proteins that regulate G1 progression through regulation of their
  stability.
