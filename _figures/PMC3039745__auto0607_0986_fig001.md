caption: TRAF6 and A20 control K63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin 1 to trigger autophagy.
  Exposure of macrophages to LPS activates TLR4 at the plasma membrane. The engaged
  TLR4 recruits TRIF and MyD88 leading to enhanced TRAF6 E3 ligase activity. One target
  of TRAF6 is lysine 117 in Beclin 1. The K63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin 1 facilitates
  the oligomerization of Beclin 1 and the activation of PI 3KC3. This helps trigger
  the formation of autophagosomes. The engagement of TLR4 also triggers a signaling
  pathway that leads to the translocation of NFκB to the nucleus. A20 is a direct
  NFκB target gene and its expression is induced. The expression of A20 limits TLR4-induced
  autophagy by deubiquitinating TRAF6 and Beclin 1. Lysine 117 in Beclin 1 is strategically
  located in the binding site for Bcl-2. The interaction of Bcl-2 with Beclin 1 limits
  the induction of autophagy triggered by TLRs.
