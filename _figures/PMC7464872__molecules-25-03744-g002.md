caption: Proposed biosynthesis mechanisms for Compounds 1 and 2 by P. aeruginosa UWI-1.
  Indole is proposed to originate from tryptophan degradation via an unclassified
  carbon–carbon lyase. The oxidative polymerization of homogentisate (HGA) to HGA
  melanin serves as the catalyst for the formation of compounds 1 and 2. Compound
  1 is putatively formed via condensation of two molecules of indole and one molecule
  of indole-3-carboxaldehyde. Indole-3-carboxaldehyde is an intermediate product in
  the IAA synthesis pathway found in Pseudomonads. Compound 2 is putatively formed
  by the condensation of two molecules of indole and one molecule of benzaldehyde.
  Benzaldehyde is proposed to be derived as a product of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
  metabolism by naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase. The location of each gene involved in
  the biosynthesis is given in parentheses and is based on the genome of P. aeruginosa
  UWI-1 available from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) project number PRJEB32405
