caption: Schematic representation of Cdt-cell surface association, internalization,
  and intracellular activity. Details of these processes are described in the text.
  Briefly, Cdt holotoxin binds cholesterol rich membrane rafts. Several different
  pathways have been implicated for the internalization of the CdtB and CdtC subunits;
  it is possible that the operative pathway may be Cdt sub type specific or host cell
  specific. Once internalized CdtB traffics to the Golgi, ER, and ultimately to the
  nucleus and/or cytoplasm. Internalized CdtB exerts toxicity either through its ability
  to act as a DNase and/or lipid phosphatase converting PI3,4,5,P3 to PI, 4,5P2 leading
  to PI-3K signaling blockade. Phosphoinositide pools, particularly PIP3, are likely
  plasma membrane associated, perhaps in the context of membrane rafts or a component
  of the endosomal substrate pool as indicated by the light blue circles on endosomes
  which represent PI3,4,5P3. Orange-yellow circles represent cholesterol.
