caption: Mutations in the cardinal genes for gliomagenesis including IDH and RTK pathway
  components are the central force to drive metabolic reprogramming in gliomas. By
  promoting cancer metabolisms, glioma cells avidly take up extracellular nutrients
  such as glucose and acetate and metabolize them into intermediary metabolites which
  in turn tailor the genetic signaling by shifting epigenetics as well as post-translationally
  modifying oncogenic proteins in the cytosol.Ac, acetyl-group; Me, methyl-group;
  K, lysine residues.
