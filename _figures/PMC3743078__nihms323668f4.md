caption: A) Diagram indicating the locations of the vertebrate tight junction (TJ)
  or its equivalent in Drosophila and other invertebrates (septate junction - SJ)
  relative the adherens junction (AJ). Key homophylic adhesion factors are also depicted
  (Claudins for the TJ and Cadherins for the AJ) as well as transport of cadherins
  and Notch ligands such as Delta to the AJ via the late recycling endosome (LRE).
  B) A more detailed diagram of the primary components of the AJ and TJ in VEC, which
  are not always restricted to distinct domains as in epithelial cells e.g., as depicted
  in panel A) but are intermingled in some VEC (reviewed in []). The TJ contains three
  adhesion molecules, Claudins (e.g., Claudin-5 in VEC), Occludin, and JAMs, which
  are linked via Claudins to the scaffolding protein ZO-1 and circumferential Actin
  cables. The AJ includes cadherins (e.g., the type-II VE-Cad in vascular endothelial
  cells) which bind linking proteins of the Armadillo family (β-catenin, Plakoglobin,
  p120) and α-catenin, as well as supportive adhesion factors (e.g., Nectin in vertebrate
  cells and Echinoid in Drosophila cells) and signaling components such as Delta-like4
  (Dll4) and Notch1/Notch 4, the VEGF-Receptor2 (not shown in this figure, but see
  ). α-catenin (α-cat) can either bind to VE-CAD via an interaction with β-catenin
  (β-cat) or can form dimers that bind to and stabilize actin cables, but it cannot
  bind to both actin and cadherins at the same time. β-catenin that is not bound to
  cadherins can migrate to the nucleus where is acts as a transcriptional mediator
  of the WNT pathway. High levels of clustered cadherin expression at the AJ sequester
  nearly all available β-catenin, thus prevent it from participating in transcriptional
  regulation. Decreased barrier function, however, can result in a release of β-catenin
  that is then can translocate to the nucleus. Also shown is the adaptor protein Afadin
  6 (Af6), known as Canoe (Cno) in Drosophila, which links Nectin or Echinoid molecules
  respectively to ZO1 and the actin cytoskeleton. In addition to circumferential actin
  cables that stabilize apical junctions, actin is also organized in perpendicular
  stress fibers (actin stress fibers) that may participate in membrane trafficking
  of cargo to the cell surface (see ).
