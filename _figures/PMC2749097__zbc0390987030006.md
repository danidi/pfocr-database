caption: Model of protein lipoylation in yeast. The mitochondrial FAS II pathway produces
  octanoic acid, the precursor for lipoic acid synthesis. Lip2, Lip3, Lip5, Gcv3,
  and Lpd1 may function in a lipoylation complex. We previously reported that FAS
  II and tRNA processing intersect (), and we hypothesize that this intersection exists
  as a point of regulation for mitochondrial gene expression. A product of FAS II
  is required for assembly or activity of mitochondrial RNase P, which processes the
  5′ leader sequences of tRNAs. Because RNase P activity is required for the maturation
  of its own mitochondrially encoded RNA subunit, a positive feedback loop exists
  for RNase P maturation and activity in response to the FAS II pathway. Pyruvate
  dehydrogenase, which requires lipoic acid for its function, produces acetyl-CoA,
  which is fed into the FAS II pathway. The dashed arrows represent the requirement
  of lipoic acid for PDH, α-KDH, and GC enzymatic activity. The dotted arrow represents
  the requirement of a product of the FAS II pathway for RNase P activity or assembly.
