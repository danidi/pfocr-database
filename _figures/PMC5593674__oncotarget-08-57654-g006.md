caption: Schematic illustration of molecules expressed in tumor cells (left part)
  and T lymphocytes (right part) involved in the immune checkpoint inhibitory pathway
  and of the targeted drugs (the PD-1 mAbs Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, the CTLA-4
  mAb Ipilimumab). The insert table shows the major trials targeting this pathway.
