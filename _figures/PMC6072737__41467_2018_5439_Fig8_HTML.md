caption: Hypothesized mechanisms by which JNK activation with exercise leads to muscle
  hypertrophy. Canonical myostatin signaling (depicted with black arrows) results
  in reduced myofiber size via receptor-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2 on its C-terminus
  (Ser465/467). Myostatin-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation induces dimerization with
  co-SMAD4 and translocation of the SMAD complex to the nucleus where DNA binding
  and transcription are initiated. Our data demonstrate that resistance exercise induces
  JNK activation and phosphorylation of SMAD2 in its linker region via a non-canonical
  pathway (depicted with red arrows). Phosphorylation of SMAD2 at specific linker
  region resides (Ser245/250/255) has an inhibitory effect on myostatin activity by
  preventing the nuclear translocation of SMAD2. Inhibition of myostatin via this
  novel JNK/SMAD pathway allows for exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy
