caption: Model of the molecular and hormonal pathway for root hair development. Hormones
  stimulating root hair growth are shown in green, those repressing are shown in red.
  Root tip is at the left side in the schematic longitudinal section through a single
  epidermal cell layer with consecutive root hair developmental phases. ARF5/7/19,
