caption: (A) p53-dependent pathway. DNA damage activates ATR/ATM and CHK1/CHK2 kinases
  leading to p53 phosphorylation. p53 undergoes p300 dependent acetylation which transactivates
  specific p53 target genes resulting in either cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or
  apoptosis. (B) FA pathway. The FA pathway is activated during the S-phase of the
  cell cycle upon DNA replication fork stalling at ICLs. ATR/CHK1 is activated and
  in turn activates FA core complex, which promotes the monoubiquitylation of the
  FANCI-FANCD2 heterodimer. The ubiquitylated FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer at ICLs recruits
  DNA repair proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair, translesion synthesis
  and homologous recombination to stabilize the fork and repair ICLs.
