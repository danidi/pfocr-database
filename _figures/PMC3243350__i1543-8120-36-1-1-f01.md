caption: Biosynthetic pathway of oxylipins in Arabidopsis. It is postulated that signals
  (such as elicitors) interact with a membrane receptor causing the eventual production
  of 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid. Production of 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid is believed
  to occur with the release of linolenic acid via either a phospholipase or lipase
  followed by oxidation by lipoxygenase (LOX), but a preliminary oxidation of linolenic
  acid while still esterified to a phospholipid and subsequent release by a lipase
  cannot be ruled out. 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid can then be catabolized by hydroperoxy
  lyase (HL) eventually forming volatile aldehydes and traumatic acid or via peroxygenase
  pathway to cutin monomers. Jasmonic acid arises from 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid
  via an allene oxide synthase (AOS) and allene oxide cyclase (AOC) dependent pathway
  with 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) as an intermediate. Jasmonic acid then acts
  to modulate gene expression otr can be further catabolized.
