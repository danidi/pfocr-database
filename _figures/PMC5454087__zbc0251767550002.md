caption: RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. The three human RIG-I-like receptors
  RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 detect foreign cytosolic double-stranded (ds) RNA, as for
  example released from entering RNA viruses, and induce an immune response to fight
  off the infection. In the absence of RNA ligands, signaling by RIG-I and MDA5 is
  prevented by shielding 2CARD from cytosolic interaction partners. 1, upon RNA detection
  both RIG-I and MDA5 release their 2CARD signaling module. RIG-I preferentially binds
  to nonmethylated dsRNA ends containing 5′-tri- or -diphosphates and further needs
  ATP to eject 2CARD. MDA5, in contrast, cooperatively binds to long dsRNA and forms
  filaments that are probably stabilized or seeded by LGP2. 2, each four released
  2CARD modules of RIG-I or MDA5 subsequently assemble into tetramers and are stabilized
  by polyubiquitination or ubiquitin binding. 3, RLR 2CARD tetramerization, in turn,
  triggers the oligomerization of the RLR adapter protein MAVS. MAVS is distributed
  on the outer mitochondrial membrane but polymerizes into long filaments if seeded
  by 2CARD protomers. 4, this brings together many interaction sites of downstream
  factors within the MAVS unstructured region and activates a signaling cascade that
  leads to the expression of type I interferons or other cytokines and sets the cell
  into an antiviral state.
