caption: Main targets of (p)ppGpp in Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria. The regulatory
  nucleotides (p)ppGpp alter cellular metabolism in response to stress by directly
  binding to a variety of enzymes. For transcription in Gammaproteobacteria, (p)ppGpp
  binds directly to RNAP together with the DksA coeffector to modulate promoter selection
  (, , ). Repression or activation of target genes is dependent on discriminator sequences
  encoded in the promoter region (). Furthermore, (p)ppGpp promotes alternative σ
  factor usage (). In Firmicutes, (p)ppGpp is unable to bind to RNAP (, ). In this
  case, transcription is indirectly regulated through depletion of GTP. Low intracellular
  levels of GTP and BCAA alleviate repression of the global transcriptional regulator
  CodY, leading to activation of amino acid biosynthesis, nutrient transport, and
  virulence genes (, , ). In addition, GTP depletion represses transcription of genes,
  such as rRNA (rrn) operons, requiring GTP as their initiating nucleotide (+1G).
  For GTP biosynthesis in Gammaproteobacteria, (p)ppGpp lowers GTP production by inhibiting
  IMP dehydrogenase (GuaB), the first enzyme in the de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis
  pathway (), as well as hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HprT) and xanthine-guanine
  phosphoribosyltransferase (Gpt). In Firmicutes, (p)ppGpp rapidly depletes GTP levels
  through inhibition of GuaB, HprT, and guanylate kinase (Gmk), halting both de novo
  and salvage pathways (). For translation in Gammaproteobacteria, (p)ppGpp directly
  alters translation initiation and elongation by inactivating initiation factor 2
  (IF-2) and elongation factor G (EF-G) (, ). Moreover, ribosomal maturation and mRNA
  translation/stability are affected by inhibition of small GTPases and interaction
  with the Csr system, respectively (, , ). In Firmicutes, (p)ppGpp directly inhibits
  protein translation through inactivation of small GTPases and IF-2 (, ). For DNA
  replication, (p)ppGpp-specific inhibition of DNA primase is observed in both bacterial
  groups, whereas replication is blocked at the initiation step in Gammaproteobacteria
  and at the elongation step in Firmicutes ().
