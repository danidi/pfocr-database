caption: 'Role of dietary flavonoids in epilepsy via modulation of CREB-BDNF Pathway.
  Epileptic seizures result in enhanced neuronal discharges and alterations in neurotransmitter
  release which results in excitotoxicity that ultimately leads to various cognitive
  and behavioural impairments. Flavonoids interact with receptors like GABA, NMDA,
  Ion channels, TrkB etc and cause the upregulation of CREB-BDNF pathway. Enhanced
  BDNF shows reversal of neuronal damage and behavioural impairments caused by seizures
  and also BDNF potentiates the synthesis of NPY that further leads to the suppression
  of seizures. BDNF: Brain derived neurotrophic factor; CREB: cAMP response element
  binding protein and NPY: Neuropeptide Y. (A higher resolution / colour version of
  this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).'
