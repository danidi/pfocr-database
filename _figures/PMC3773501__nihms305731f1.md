caption: This figure provides an overview of the major signaling pathways of NOD2.
  The central and perhaps dominant pathway is the RICK-dependent pathway that involves
  activation of RICK followed by downstream activation of TAK1; this then leads to
  activation of MAP kinases and NF-kB. As indicated in the text, interaction of NOD2
  with CARD 9 or Bid may determine which downstream components are activated. On the
  right side of the figure a RICK-independent NOD2 signaling pathway initiated by
  viral ssRNA is depicted; this involves binding of ssRNA to NOD2 followed by interaction
  with MAVS, an adaptor protein associated with mitochondria. This leads to activation
  of IRF3 and induction of type I interferon. On the left side of the figure interaction
  of NOD2 with the autophagy proteins in depicted. Such interaction can take the form
  of RICK-independent interaction with ATG16L1 and trafficking of the latter to the
  cell membrane, or RICK-dependent (and therefore NF-kB-dependent activation of autophagy
  proteins. Through this pathway NOD2 can affect bacterial handling and elimination
  or antigen presentation.
