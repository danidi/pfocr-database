caption: Role of glutathionylation in the Fas/FasL pathway. In C10 epithelial cells,
  pro-caspase-8 is activated when c-FLIP dissociates from Fas, resulting in the formation
  of DISC and the activation of pro-caspase-3 (pro-casp-3). Caspase-3 (Casp-3) is
  capable of degrading Grx, which can increase the number of glutathionylated Fas
  proteins. Fas-SSG is more readily recruited into lipid rafts, facilitating and propagating
  this apoptotic signal leading to enhanced Grx degradation and apoptosis, as described
  in (). It is important to note that an alternative role of Grx in promoting apoptosis
  was reported (); namely, in response to TNFα stimulation of endothelial cells, Grx
  is activated and catalyzes deglutathionylation of pro-caspase-3, thereby enabling
  proteolytic cleavage and release of the active caspase 3. Pro-caspase-3-SSG, which
  may be formed from pro-caspase-3-SNO, is unable to be cleaved, preventing Grx degradation
  and Fas deglutathionylation, thereby preventing apoptosis.
