caption: (A) In the simplified pathway representation, heterogeneous nodes and edges
  correspond to genes, proteins, small molecules, and their regulatory and catalytic
  relationships. Nodes do not interact directly but participate in reaction events
  designated by white squares. (B) In the network representation, all nodes correspond
  to the same type of biological entity (gene products). Edges derived from curated
  pathways are shown as bold arrows. Additional gene-gene interactions derived from
  gene co-expression and physical protein interactions are shown as light lines.
