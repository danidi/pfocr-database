caption: 'Hypothetical model of the compartmentalization of biosynthetic pathways
  involved in penicillin and cephalosporin C formation. The fungal β-lactam antibiotics
  derive from three amino acids (l-α-aminoadipic acid (l-α-AAA), l-cysteine, and l-valine,
  which are condensed via the function of ACV synthetase) into the tripeptide δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine
  (ACV) in the cytosol. Subsequently the bicyclic ring structure IPN is formed via
  oxidative ring closure from the linear ACV tripeptide by cytosolic IPN synthase.
  IPN is subsequently transported into the peroxisome by the CefP transporter. The
  penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis pathways diverge at this stage. Penicillin
  biosynthesis occurs in peroxisomes where the hydrophilic l-α-AAA side chain of IPN
  is exchanged for a hydrophobic acyl group of a side chain precursor by acyl coenzyme
  A (CoA):isopenicillin N acyltransferase (IAT). In the natural environment penicillin
  DF, F and K, containing hexenoic acid, ∆3-hexenoic acid and octenoic acid as a side
  chain, respectively, are produced. Penicillin G and V are synthesized upon supplementation
  of cultivation media with PAA or POA, respectively. Activation of the side chain
  precursor in the peroxisomal matrix requires phenylacetyl coenzyme A ligase (PCL)
  (Koetsier et al. ; Meijer et al. ). In A. chrysogenum, two enzymes are employed
  in the subsequent step of the cephalosporin biosynthesis pathway, IPN–CoA synthetase,
  IPN–CoA epimerase. These enzymes are the components of the IPN epimerase system
  and catalyse the isomerization of the l-α-AAA side chain of IPN to the d-enantiomer
  to produce penicillin N. Bioinformatic analysis of genes encoding two components
  of the IPN epimerase system, cefD1 and cefD2, revealed that both proteins contain
  putative peroxisomal targeting signals (Martin et al.). In P. chrysogenum the putative
  homologous proteins of the IPN epimerase system were found in the peroxisomal matrix
  supporting the hypothesis that this step of cephalosporin biosynthesis may occur
  in peroxisomes (Kiel et al. ). Moreover, recent studies have revealed the presence
  of two peroxisomal membrane proteins: CefP and CefM, implied for the translocation
  of the penicillin N intermediate. The completion of cephalosporin biosynthesis occurs
  in the cytosol, where bifunctional enzyme with expandase and hydroxylase activities
  converts penicillin N into deacetoxycephalosporin C and subsequently into deacetylcephalosporin
  C (DAC). The thiazolidine ring of penicillin is exchanged by the six-membered dihydrothiazine
  ring forming the cephem nucleus. In the final step, which is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA:DAC
  acetyltransferase (DAT), DAC is converted into cephalosporin C'
