caption: Possible relationship between basal ganglia circuit (left side) and micturition
  circuit (right side; modified from Sakakibara et al. []). DA, dopamine; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric
  acid; SNc, substantia nigra pars compacta; GPi, globus pallidus internus; SNr, substantia
  nigra pars reticulate; STN, subthalamic nucleus; GPe, globus pallidus externus;
  VTA, ventral tegmental area; PMC, pontine micturition centre; Glu, glutamate; black
  line, inhibitory neurons; white line, excitatory neurons; hatched line, neurons
  of undetermined property. The micturition reflex (right-side pathway) is under the
  influences of dopamine (DA; both inhibitory in D1 and facilitatory in D2) and gamma-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA; inhibitory). The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neuronal firing
  and the released striatal dopamine seem to activate the dopamine D1-GABAergic direct
  pathway, which not only inhibits the basal ganglia output nuclei (e.g., the globus
  pallidus internus (GPi), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)), but also may inhibit
  the micturition reflex via GABAergic collateral to the micturition circuit. High-frequency
  stimulation (leading to inhibition) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) also results
  in bladder inhibition. See text.
