caption: Myosin II accumulation and contractility are governed by a mechanosensitive
  control system. The flow diagram summarizes our view of how myosin II accumulates
  at the cleavage furrow and generates cortical tension and contractility, which together
  drive furrow ingression (; ). Cortical tension contributes in a complex manner,
  providing resistance early in furrow ingression and then assistance later in furrow
  ingression. The racE-14-3-3-myosin II pathway contributes to cell mechanics along
  the global/polar cortex (). The gray box encapsulates a cooperative module that
  includes myosin II and cortexillin I (; ; ). The IQGAP1 and 2 proteins antagonize
  each other to modulate the cooperativity module. IQGAP2 further links back to the
  spindle signaling proteins, including kinesin 6 and INCENP proteins (). Myosin II
  assembly is also modulated by myosin II heavy chain kinases (MHCKs), which maintain
  a free pool of myosin monomer (M0) so that myosin II can assemble where and when
  it is needed (; ). RMD1 also is required for myosin II accumulation at the cleavage
  furrow cortex. However, mechanical stress bypasses the RMD1 requirement.
