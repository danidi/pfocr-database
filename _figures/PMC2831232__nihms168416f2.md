caption: Hypothetical model of NKT cells in immune-mediated pregnancy loss. NKT cells
  are activated directly by bacterial cell wall glycolipids, or they can be activated
  indirectly via LPS or CpG-stimulated APCs. Therefore, a hypothetical model may be
  constructed which integrates both of these pathways in immune-mediated pregnancy
  loss. A) Exogenous pathway. Pathogen-derived cell wall glycolipids are endocytosed
  by an APC and loaded onto CD1d. B) Endogenous pathway. Pathogen-derived TLR ligands
  such as LPS trigger TLR4 signaling on an APC (DC and/or macrophage) which induces
  loading of endogenous CD1d agonist ligands onto CD1d. Activation of NKT cells through
  TCR recognition of CD1d and agonist ligand leads to cytokine production and upregulation
  of CD40L (CD154). Cross-linking of CD40 expressed on the APC by CD40L in turn leads
  to APC activation and results in secretion of IL-12, which induces NK cell. IL-12
  production leads to NK cell activation and subsequent production of IFN-γ and TNF.

  description: Hypothetical model of NKT cells in immune-mediated pregnancy loss.
    NKT cells are activated directly by bacterial cell wall glycolipids, or they can
    be activated indirectly via LPS or CpG-stimulated APCs. Therefore, a hypothetical
    model may be constructed which integrates both of these pathways in immune-mediated
    pregnancy loss. A) Exogenous pathway. Pathogen-derived cell wall glycolipids are
    endocytosed by an APC and loaded onto CD1d. B) Endogenous pathway. Pathogen-derived
    TLR ligands such as LPS trigger TLR4 signaling on an APC (DC and/or macrophage)
    which induces loading of endogenous CD1d agonist ligands onto CD1d. Activation
    of NKT cells through TCR recognition of CD1d and agonist ligand leads to cytokine
    production and upregulation of CD40L (CD154). Cross-linking of CD40 expressed
    on the APC by CD40L in turn leads to APC activation and results in secretion of
    IL-12, which induces NK cell. IL-12 production leads to NK cell activation and
    subsequent production of IFN-γ and TNF.
