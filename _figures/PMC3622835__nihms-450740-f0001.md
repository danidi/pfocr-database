caption: A. Simplified schematic representation of the ubiquitin-proteasome (UPS)
  and autophagy/lysosomal protein degradation systems. Attachment of ubiquitin to
  a substrate, and lipidation of LC3 for autophagosome formation are achieved by enzymatic
  cascades that involve E1-, E2- and E3-enzymes. Substrate poly-ubiquitination can
  be regulated through control of E3-ligase activity (see also ). Poly-ubiquitinated
  substrates are subsequently degraded through the 26S proteasome complex in the UPS
  pathway, or through the p62/Nbr1 mediated selective autophagy pathway. Whole organelles
  undergo encapsulation in autophagosomes in a process known as macro-autophagy.B.
  Regulation of Cullin E3-ligase activity. Activation of cullin E3-ligases is achieved
  through the TIP120A/B mediated assembly of cullins with co-factors Rbx1, Skp1 and
  a substrate specific linker protein. Posttranslational modification and subsequent
  activation of cullins by Nedd8 (N8, neddylation) is achieved through an enzymatic
  process involving APP-BP-1/UBA3, UBC12 and DCN1/SCCRO (defective in cullin neddylation).
  Deactivation of CRL is achieved by deneddylation through the COP9 signalosome (CSN),
  whereby CSN5/JAB-1 exhibits the isopeptidase activity that cleaves nedd8 from the
  cullin protein. Other CSN subunits have either structural and/or regulatory functions.
