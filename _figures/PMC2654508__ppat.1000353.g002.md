caption: (A) Wild-type strain in the absence of β-lactams. During regular bacterial
  growth, the peptidoglycan degradation products, MurNac-peptides [N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-
  N-acetylmuramyl-tri (or tetra) peptides], are generated in the periplasm through
  the activity of PBP4 and several other enzymes. These products are then internalized
  through the permease AmpG, and processed in the cytoplasm by the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase
  NagZ and the N-acetyl-anhydromuramyl-L-alanine amidase AmpD. P. aeruginosa has two
  additional AmpD proteins, AmpDh2 that it is apparently located in the outer membrane
  and AmpDh3 that is still of unknown location. The generated tripeptides are then
  incorporated to the murein biosynthesis pathway to yield the UDP-MurNac-pentapeptides
  that will be exported to the periplasm and incorporated to the peptidoglycan, to
  complete the recycling process. In the absence of β-lactam antibiotics, these UDP-MurNac-pentapeptides
  interact with AmpR, which functions as a negative regulator of ampC expression.
  (B) Growth of wild-type strain in the presence AmpC inducer β-lactams. During growth
  in the presence of certain β-lactams (AmpC inducers), such as cefoxitin or imipenem,
  AmpC is produced at high levels, conferring natural (intrinsic) resistance to the
  antibiotic, provided it is a good substrate for the enzyme (as occurs for cefoxitin
  but not for imipenem). The exact mechanism responsible for the induction of the
  expression of AmpC in the presence of these antibiotics is still not fully understood.
  One of the components of the induction process is apparently the saturation of AmpD,
  due to the enhanced generation of its substrate (MurNac-tripeptides). The accumulated
  MurNAc-tripeptides are thought to displace the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides from AmpR,
  converting it into an activator of ampC transcription. Our results, and other previous
  indirect evidences, suggest that the inhibition of PBP4 by these β-lactam antibiotics
  (known to be the most potent PBP4 inhibitors) plays a major role in the ampC induction
  process, and determines the activation of the CreBC (BlrAB) two-component regulator.
  The exact function of the signal transducer AmpE, located in the inner membrane,
  still needs to be elucidated, but apparently interacts with both AmpD and PBP4.
  (C) Growth of the AmpD and/or PBP4 mutants in the presence of AmpC non-inducer β-lactams
  (most antipseudomonal cephalosporins and penicillins, such as ceftazidime or piperacillin,
  respectively). The inactivation of PBP4 or AmpD produces a very similar constitutive
  ampC overexpression. Both mechanisms ultimately relay in the activation of AmpR,
  which changes its activity from negative to positive regulator of ampC expression.
  Independently of the mechanism, AmpC overexpression itself is shown to confer only
  moderate (low-level) acquired resistance to non-inducer β-lactams. Additionally,
  the inactivation of PBP4 specifically activates the CreBC (BlrAB) system, which
  drives, in conjunction with the AmpC overexpression, the high-level β-lactam resistance
  response.
