caption: Dendritic cells being one of the major IL-1β producers in pulmonary H. capsulatum
  infection, the pathogen is recognized preferentially by Dectin-2 and less so by
  Dectin-1 in dendritic cells. The recognition triggers Syk-JNK signaling pathway
  that leads to IL-1β production. Syk-JNK signaling provides signal 1 to induce pro-IL-1β
  synthesis as well as signal 2 to activate cathepsin B release. While K+ efflux also
  functions as signal 2, it is independent of either receptor. Signal 1 and 2 together
  promote NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation for IL-1β release.
