caption: 'β-AR signaling in cardiomyocytes under physiological condition (A), during
  heart failure (B), and during cardiac aging (C). Physiological conditions (A): GRK2
  phosphorylates β-ARs in cardiomyocytes and regulates contractility via AC-PKA pathway
  activation. Heart failure (B): Increased circulating CAs led to hyper-stimulation
  of β-ARs and GRK2 upregulation in cardiomyocytes, resulting in desensitization/downregulation
  of β-ARs, ultimately leading to reduction of contractility. Aging heart (C): Aging
  is characterized by increased circulating CAs with desensitization/downregulation
  of cardiomyocyte β-ARs (GRK2 is unchanged and the mechanism of β-AR dysfunction
  is still unknown) and decreased contractility. AC activity is reduced leading to
  decreased levels of cAMP. CAs, catecholamines; β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; G-protein
  subunits: Gα (Gαs or Gαi), Gβ, Gγ; GRK2, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2; AC,
  adenylyl cyclase; ATP, adenosine tri-phosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate;
  PKA, protein kinase A. A blue arrow is used when a stimulatory mechanism is involved
  while a red bar-headed line is used for an inhibitory mechanism. Thicker arrow means
  upregulation while thinner arrow means downregulation.'
