caption: The structure and biosynthetic pathway of folates in plants. (A) Chemical
  structure of tetrahydrofolate (H4folate). Folates are tripartite molecules consisting
  of pteridine (blue), pABA (red), and glutamate moieties (violet). One-carbon units
  at various levels of oxidation (methyl, methylene, formyl) are attached to the N5
  and/or N10 position. Plant folates have γ-linked polyglutamyl tails of up to approximately
  six residues attached to the γ-carboxyl group of the first glutamate residue. (B)
  The plant folate biosynthesis pathway. The pteridine pathway leading to hydroxymethyldihydropterin
  (HMDHP) is shown in blue, the pathway leading to p-aminobenzoate is shown in red,
  and the remaining steps localized in the mitochondria are in black. ADC, aminodeoxychorismate;
  DHN, dihydroneopterin; -P, monophosphate; -PP, pyrophosphate; -PPP, triphosphate;
  DHM, dihydromonapterin.
