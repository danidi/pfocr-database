caption: Integration of both positive and negative costimulatory signals during and
  after initial T cell activation will determine the fate and intensity of the alloimmune
  response. The complexity of the costimulatory network is exemplified by the potential
  effects of B7-1 targeting (such as accomplished by CTLA-4-Ig) – while blockade of
  B7-1 decreases positive costimulatory signaling through CD28 (A), it may affect
  two inhibitory signaling pathways, preventing B7-1 engagement of CTLA-4 (B) and
  PD-L1 (C). Dashed line represent the still controversial issue of reverse signaling
  through PD-L1 or PD-L2.
