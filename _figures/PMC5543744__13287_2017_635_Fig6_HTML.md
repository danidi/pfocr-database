caption: 'Proposed mechanism of hypoxic-conditioned secretome effects on liver regeneration.
  Liver regeneration is essentially achieved by the combination of two distinct factors:
  cell proliferation (increase in the number of hepatocytes) and hypertrophy (increase
  in the size of hepatocytes). Cell proliferation is mediated by the IL-6/STAT3 pathway,
  and hypertrophy is mediated by the PI3K/PDK/Akt pathway. We provide two independent
  mechanisms by which hypoxic-conditioned secretome improves liver regeneration. First,
  hypoxic-preconditioned secretome promotes liver cell proliferation by persistent
  and uninhibited expression of STAT3 in the liver which is caused by decreased expression
  of SOCS3. Second, hypoxic-preconditioned secretome promotes liver cell hypertrophy
  by upregulating Akt expression which is activated by higher expression of SIRT1.

  3-kinase, STAT3 signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, SIRT1 sirtuin
