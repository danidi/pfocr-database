caption: 'Cross-talks between tumor and immune cells determining chemo-immune-resistance.
  Chemotherapy and immune cells, e.g., T-helper 17 (Th17) cells producing IL-17 and
  M2-polarized macrophages producing colony stimulating factor-1, activate the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway in tumor cells, leading to the up-regulation of the Bcl-2 proteins that
  promote chemoresistance by reducing apoptosis. Moreover, in response to chemotherapy,
  resistant tumors activate the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK axis that: (i) up-regulates P-glycoprotein
  (Pgp), a drug efflux transporter and an inhibitor of the calreticulin (CRT)-triggered
  phagocytosis by dendritic cells (DCs), avoiding the establishment of a durable adaptive
  immune response mediated by CD8+ T-cells; (ii) promotes the secretion of kynurenine
  that expands the immune-suppressive T-regulatory (Treg) cells; (iii) up-regulates
  the immune-checkpoint ligand programmed death-1 ligand (PD-1L) that expands PD-1
  rich/anergic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells; (iv) down-regulates the surface protein NKG2D,
  preventing the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. Chemo-immune-resistance
  is sustained by either chemotherapy or immune cell-induced mechanisms, all converging
  on an increased ERK activation. Green arrows: decreased pathways (thin arrows) and
  events (thick arrows); red arrow: increased pathways (thin arrows) and events (thick
  arrows).'
