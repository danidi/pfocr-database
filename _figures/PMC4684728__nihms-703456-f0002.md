caption: Molecular crosstalk between the biological systems in schizophrenia. Mesolimbic
  dopaminergic projections (yellow) between the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and striatum
  (Str.) are significantly increased. The dopaminergic mesocortical pathway is also
  affected. Multiple glutamatergic (pink) pathways are affected. GABAergic (blue)
  pathways are also affected. Glucocorticoids released from the adrenal glands affect
  numerous brain targets including the cortex, hippocampus (Hip.), hypothalamus (Hyp)
  and pituitary gland. Molecular substrates of adipose tissue and the gut interact
  with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis via the hypothalamus. Th, thalamus;
  WM, white matter; CRH, corticotropin releasing hormone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic
  hormone.
