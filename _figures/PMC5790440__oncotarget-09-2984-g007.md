caption: Upon recognition of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, IRE1α is activated
  via oligomerization. Its kinase domain (KD) contributes to the activation of its
  RNase domain (RD) resulting in splicing of XBP1u to yield XBP1s. Moreover, the IRE1α
  KD mediates activation of the JNK pathway with JNK, in turn, controlling the activity
  of the IRE1α RD. The targets of the pharmacological inhibitors used in this study
  are indicated.
