caption: 'The amount of ions translocated by the Rnf complex and the Na+ F1FO ATP
  synthase are not exactly known. For sake of clarity, a Na+/e− stochiometry of 1∶1
  is assumed (based on a ΔGO′ value of −37 kJ/mol; E0′ Fd2−/Fdox = −500 mV; E0′ NADH+H+/NAD+ = −320
  mV; and ΔuNa+ (electrochemical Na+ potential across the cytoplasmic membrane) = −320
  mV). For the ATP synthase, a Na+/ATP stoichiometry of 4 is assumed. The redox potentials
  (E0′) are: CO2/formate = −430 mV, methenyl-THF/methylene-THF = −300 mV, methylene-THF/methyl-THF = −200
  mV, CO2/CO = −520 mV.'
