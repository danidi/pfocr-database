caption: A scheme of the putative signalling pathway through which empagliflozin target
  cardiac stromal cell senescence induced by hyperglycaemia and hyperosmotic, based
  on findings from the in vitro part of the present study. In the plasma membrane,
  hyperglycaemia induces hyperosmotic stress, and together, these metabolic and biophysical
  stressors impair the ability of cardiac stromal cells to respond to insulin. This
  causes the perturbation of the pro‐survival PI3K/Akt and pro‐inflammatory p38 pathways
  with insulin preserving its signalling capacity through the mitogenic and pro‐inflammatory
  arm, leading to the development and progression of a pro‐senescent phenotype. Empagliflozin
  is able to revert CSC senescence by targeting the insulin signalling pathway
