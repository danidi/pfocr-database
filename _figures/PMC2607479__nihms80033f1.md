caption: Both SIRT1 and AMPK are activated by CR, starvation, exercise, and RSV. SRT1720
  is a small molecule that specifically activates SIRT1, while AMPK is specifically
  activated by metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs). SIRT1 activation increases
  mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation through deacetylation and activation
  of PGC1-α. It is still not known yet whether PGC1-α induced expression of GLUT4
  also requires SIRT1. Activated SIRT1 also blocks myogenesis, via MyoD and PCAF deacetylation.AMPK
  activation increases fatty acid oxidation acutely by direct phosphorylation of the
  enzymes ACC and MCAD, and chronically by phosphorylation and activation of PGC1-α,
  that is also required for AMPK mediated increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. AMPK
  controls glucose uptake by increased translocation of GLUT4 to the membrane and
  by increasing GLUT4 expression through PGC1-α activation. AMPK may also activate
  PGC1-α indirectly through SIRT1 activation via increase of Nampt expression, as
  described in the pathway that blocks myogenesis. AMPK activation induces also glycolysis.
