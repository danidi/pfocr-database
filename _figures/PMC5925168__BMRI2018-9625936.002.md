caption: Schematic illustration of pruritic signaling pathways. According to different
  responses to histamine, two signal pathways of itching are covered, namely, histamine-dependent
  (histaminergic) signaling pathway and histamine-independent (nonhistaminergic) signaling
  pathway. In the histaminergic pathway, histamine promotes PLCβ3 and PLC activation
  by binding to their specific receptors, particularly H1 receptor and H4 receptor.
  These further induce the activation of downstream target TRPV1. Then, itch signals
  are transferred to the central nervous system via CMi, which finally lead to itchy
  sensation. On the other side, many pruritogens exist in the nonhistaminergic pathway,
  such as cowhage, CQ, BAM8-22, SLIGRL, and β-Alanine. Cowhage initially stimulates
  PAR2, which in turn sensitize PLC. Then the downstream targets including TRPV1 and
  TRPA1 are activated. Ultimately, itch signals are transferred to the central nervous
  system via CMHs and itch sensation is produced. At the same time, Mrgprs are linked
  and activated by CQ, SLIGRL, BAM8-22, and β-Alanine, further coupled to Gβγ or PLC
  or other; then they promote TRPA1/ TRPV1 activation and Mrgpr-positive neurons detect
  itch signals; via afferent fibers (CMHs), these signals are sent to the spinal cord
  and are regulated by GRP-GRPR and BNP-NPRA systems; finally itching sensation is
  present. PLCβ3, phospholipase Cβ3; TRPV1, transient receptor potential cation channel
  V1; TRPA1, transient receptor potential cation channel A1; CMi, mechanically insensitive
  C-fibers; PAR2, protease-activated receptor; CMHs, mechanically sensitive C-type
  fibers; BAM8-22, bovine adrenal medulla 8-22 peptide; Mrgprs, Mas-related G protein-coupled
  receptors; GRP, gastrin-releasing peptide; GRPR, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor;
  BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; NPRA, natriuretic peptide receptor A.
