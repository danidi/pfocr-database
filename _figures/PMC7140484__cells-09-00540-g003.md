caption: Schematic model of the network of gene expression co-regulation by IRES elements
  in stress conditions during tumoural progression. During tumour progression, the
  stress zone encompasses the growing tumour, but also its microenvironment. Both
  the tumour and the neo vessels, more particularly the Tip cells located at their
  extremity, which guide the neo vessels towards the tumour, are located in this unfavourable
  microenvironment. Hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and acidosis will irremediably induce
  the accumulation of unfolded protein in the reticulum of cells located in this area,
  leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and UPR activation. Thus, in addition to
  transcriptional regulations, the activation of the PERK pathway will induce the
  co-regulation an UPR-dependent gene network containing IRES elements, revealing
  a translational regulon in which the synthesis of a cohort of angiogenic master
  regulator genes including VEGF-A,C,D, FGF-2, DLL4, and HIF1 is activated in response
  to ER stress. The fine-tuning of gene expression allows for efficient angiogenesis,
  which is a highly regulated process.
