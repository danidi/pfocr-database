caption: 'The pervasive and modifiable role of iron on the development of AD. The
  most widely accepted theories of AD causation implicate four significant changes:
  (1) Aβ accumulation, (2) tau hyperphosphorylation and development of neurofibrillary
  pathology, (3) oxidative stress and free radical damage in vulnerable neurons, and
  (4) expression of cell cycle proteins in post-mitotic neurons. Age-related increase
  in stored iron is at the apex of a pathophysiological cascade that could promote
  these critical changes by increasing the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
  two common medical conditions associated with increased risk for AD, and by expanding
  the pool of redox active iron (LIP) in brain cells. Insulin resistance syndrome
  and T2DM could increase Aβ accumulation because hyperinsulinemia modifies Aβ metabolism
  and glycation reactions alter Aβ aggregation [,]. Cardiovascular disease causing
  cerebral hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia could be a cause of mitochondrial damage
  and dysfunction that results in increased generation of reactive oxygen species
  including hydrogen peroxide [,]. Increased redox active iron due to increased iron
  availability and impaired iron storage/detoxification could exacerbate Fenton reaction-mediated
  oxidative stress and free radical damage to essential cell components. Moreover,
  mitochondria are both a source of reactive oxygen species and a target of reactive
  oxygen-mediated oxidative stress, so a vicious circle could develop leading to increased
  mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Iron-mediated oxidative stress, perhaps in
  association with cell signaling disturbances, could promote increased phosphorylation
  of microtubule-associated protein tau and expression of cell cycle proteins in post-mitotic
  neurons [–]. The figure also depicts a novel pathway by which iron could potentially
  regulate Aβ accumulation. Expression of furin, a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
  that stimulates α-secretase activity, is decreased in AD brain, and brain from Tg2576
  AD-transgenic mice []. Silvestri and Camaschella [] proposed that iron-mediated
  decrease of furin protein and α-secretase activity in AD brain, and iron-mediated
  increase in APP expression [], could favor the accumulation of Aβ. The figure does
  not presume to be an exhaustive review of how AD-related pathology develops, and
  indeed, does not depict other potentially important developments such as neuroinflammation.
  Our intent is to highlight potential linkage between increased body iron stores
  and some potentially important pathophysiological changes in AD that would possibly
  respond to iron reduction by calibrated phlebotomy.'
