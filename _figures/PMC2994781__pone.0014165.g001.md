caption: The HPPK module first uses ATP to convert 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8–dihydropterin
  (DHP) to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8–dihydropterin-pyrophosphate (DHPPP) with the release
  of AMP, and the DHPS module then combines DHPPP with p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA)
  to generate dihydropteroate (DHPteroate) with the release of pyrophosphate. The
  pterin-ring atoms are labeled on the DHP substrate.
