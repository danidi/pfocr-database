caption: Following a depolarizing insult, mitochondrial import is inhibited, allowing
  for the accumulation of full-length PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM).
  This triggers translocation of cytosolic Parkin to the mitochondrial outer membrane
  through an unknown mechanism (blue line). Upon translocation, Parkin begins to ubiquitinate
  substrates on the OMM, including VDAC1, Miro, and mitofusins (Mfn), which are subsequently
  targeted for proteasomal degradation. Degradation of Miro also blocks the assembly
  of the Miro-Milton-Kinesin (KIF5) complex for anterograde transport. These events
  are then followed by targeting of the depolarized mitochondrion for mitophagy. Information
  summarized from references detailed in text.
