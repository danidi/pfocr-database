caption: PI3K/Akt contribution to the regulation of alternative splicing and viruses
  utilizing the pathway for splicing regulation. After PI3K-mediated phosphorylation,
  Akt indirectly—through SRPK1/2—or directly phosphorylates SR proteins resulting
  in their translocation into the nucleus where they bind to corresponding pre-mRNAs.
  hnRNP proteins can also be targeted by Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Measles virus
  (MV) interferes with PI3K activity, leading to altered SR protein phosphorylation
  and subsequently to the alternative splicing of a constitutively active isoform
  of the PIP3 phosphatase SHIP, namely SIP110, which results in the down regulation
  of Akt activity (this route is marked with blue arrows). The adenovirus E4-ORF1
  protein and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) control SR protein activity in support
  of viral replication either through modulating PP2A or SRPK1 activity. Human immunodeficiency
  virus (HIV-1) seems to depend on PI3K activity for accurate splicing of its own
  mRNA.
