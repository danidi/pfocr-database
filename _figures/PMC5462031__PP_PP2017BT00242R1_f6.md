caption: Exploration of chorismate and isochorismate metabolism. The so-called shikimate
  pathway, with the input carbon precursors (erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate)
  and the links toward erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate metabolisms (purple
  hexagons). The six outputs from chorismate and isochorismate (salicylate, phylloquinone,
  vitamin B9, and the three aromatic amino acids) are represented at the bottom. The
  transformation of erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate into chorismate
  has been characterized extensively, and all the catalytic conversions (arrows) are
  thus represented in black. In contrast, the connections between shikimate and shikimate/l-quinate
  metabolism in the cytosol are only poorly described, as represented by the pale
  gray color of the arrows. Shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase in the cytosol
  uses shikimate (or l-quinate) as a substrate; therefore, shikimate and/or l-quinate
  must be exported from the chloroplast. This export step has yet to be characterized
  at the molecular level, and the nature of the molecule exported (shikimate, 3-dehydroshimikate,
  or quinate) is currently unclear. This uncertainty is indicated by the gray color
  of the symbols.
