caption: G10’s modified pathway diagram for the alfalfa lignin system. These molecular
  pathway diagrams display sequences of chemical transformations within a cell (or
  across cell-boundaries) which give rise to a particular biological function (in
  this case lignin production, represented as H, G and S). The biochemical elements
  and their interactions can be translated directly into a mathematical model by which
  nodes represent the concentrations of the chemical representations and arrows the
  rates of reaction. G10 assembled an original “wild-type” diagram based on known
  results provided to him by his collaborators. Various elements were added to the
  original by him, such as the arrows connecting p-coumaryl CoA to phenylalanine,
  and cinnamic acid to the environment, the latter signifying a loss from the system.
  Models built based on the original diagram were mathematically incapable of producing
  accurate behavior when inputs were perturbed out of equilibrium suggesting to him
  that some regulatory mechanisms controlling extra flux had not been factored into
  the current biological picture. He identified additional interactions which would
  resolve the extra-flux, in particular those arrows connecting p-coumaryl CoA to
  phenylalanine, and cinnamic acid to the environment
