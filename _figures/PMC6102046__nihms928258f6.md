caption: Under non-ER stress conditions, grp78 binds to PERK and CNPY2, and thus maintains
  these proteins in an inactive state. In the presence of ER stress, accumulation
  of misfolded proteins or alterations in ER homeostasis causes grp78 to dissociate
  from both PERK and CNPY2 to perform its chaperone function for misfolded proteins.
  grp78 dissociation, along with CNPY2 binding to PERK, and perhaps other yet unidentified
  events collectively initiate the UPR. The activated PERK pathway increases CHOP
  expression, which in turn transcriptionally upregulates CNPY2 expression.
