caption: 'Pathways are based on published work by various research groups. The enzymes
  for the n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid pathway are the same for n-6 long-chain
  polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Enzymatic pathways for n-3 very-long-chain
  polyunsaturated fatty acid (VLCPUFA) synthesis are better characterized than those
  for n-6 VLCPUFAs, and we have made the assumption that the same n-3 enzymes would
  be utilized in n-6 VLCPUFA synthesis.EFA: Essential fatty acid.Reproduced with permission
