caption: 'Flavonoid biosynthesis pathway of plants modified from [] with an emphasis
  on A. thaliana seeds. Black arrows highlight the core pathway and substances in
  A. thaliana discussed in this review. The respective enzymatic steps from the different
  levels of the pathway are extracted on the right. Examples for different products
  of OMTs (O-METHYLTRANSFERASEs) are given (isorhamnetin, peonidin, petunidin, malvidin).
  Note that not all steps occur in A. thaliana and other substances can also occur
  in A. thaliana: e.g., pelargonidin. See [] for details. The dashed arrow indicates
  that several proteins and enzymes are required for proanthocyanidin synthesis, deposition
  and/or further conversion to condensed tannins including transport processes (for
  a review on flavonoid transport and a few recent findings, see [,]). R2R3-MYELOBLASTOSIS-basic
  HELIX-LOOP-HELIX-WD40 repeat (MBW(AtTTG1)) complexes predominantly regulate late
  biosynthetic genes encoding for the core pathway enzymes. Dashed line: the assumed
  “border” between early and late biosynthetic genes and products in A. thaliana [,,].
  Boxed enzymes are under differential developmental regulation of MBW(AtTTG1) complexes.
  See  for details. Reduced levels of isorhamnetin in seeds of ttg1-1, but not transparent
  testa (tt)2 and tt8 mutants, indicate that the border might need some adjustment
  or that additional AtTTG1-dependent regulation occurs []. CHS: CHALCONE SYNTHASE,
