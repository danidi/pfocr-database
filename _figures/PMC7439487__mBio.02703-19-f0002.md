caption: Simulated PL synthesis and experimental data identify PlsB as a site of PL
  synthesis control during steady-state growth. (A) Reactions simulated in the model.
  For simplicity, only reactions occurring late in the saturated fatty acid pathway
  are included, and branching of the PL pathway into PE and PG is not included. Each
  reaction is modeled as an irreversible one- or two-substrate Michaelis-Menten reaction.
  ACC is competitively inhibited by C16:0-ACP and C18:0-ACP. Reactions catalyzed by
  FabI/FabZ and LpxA/LpxC are considered in the model as single reactions (represented
  in the diagram by “FabZ” and “LpxC,” respectively). (B) Response of PE and LPS fluxes
  to varying Vmax of pathway enzymes and acetyl-CoA concentrations. Variations (4-fold)
  in Vmax of all other reactions tested did not change PE or LPS flux (not shown).
  (C) Simulated changes in metabolite concentrations in response to variations in
  PlsB and ACC Vmax and acetyl-CoA (line plots) overlaid on experimentally measured
  concentrations (scatterplots; data are from ). Line plots are offset to prevent
  overlap. Differential equations and parameters of the simulation are provided in  and
  .
