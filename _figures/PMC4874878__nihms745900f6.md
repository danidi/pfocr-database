caption: Altogether, our findings are summarized in . The results suggest copper accumulation
  caused by inactivation of Atp7b is associated with inhibition of nuclear receptor
  signaling, especially, but not exclusively, the LXR/RXR heterodimer. We propose
  that the combined effects of reduced LXR/RXR activity in hepatocytes, stellate cells,
  and Kupffer cells all contribute to the pathogenesis of WD. Activation of this pathway
  with an endogenous agonist improved liver inflammation, histology, and liver function
  but did not alter hepatic copper.
