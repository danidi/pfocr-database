caption: Left panel, GlyRSWT is a multifunctional protein with both intracellular
  and extracellular distributions. VEGF/Nrp1 signaling is an essential pathway for
  survival and function of motor neurons. (Note that VEGF may also act synergistically
  with other trophic factors, and/or maintains motor-function indirectly by acting
  on Nrp1 receptors on non-motor neurons.) Right panel, CMT2D mutations alter the
  conformation of GlyRS, enabling GlyRSCMT2D to bind Nrp1. This aberrant interaction
  antagonizes the binding of VEGF to Nrp1, contributing to motor defects in CMT2D.
  Our results do not exclude the possibility that GlyRSCMT2D may also interact with
  other extracellular and/or intracellular targets, related to CMT2D pathology.
