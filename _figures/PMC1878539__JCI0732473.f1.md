caption: Vascular injury may activate the coagulation cascade (only the extrinsic
  cascade is shown) by allowing plasma factor VII to interact with its extravascular
  cofactor TF. The TF:VIIa complex activates factor X, and Xa converts prothrombin
  to thrombin with the help of cofactor factor Va. Thrombin not only triggers thrombosis
  by cleaving fibrinogen and activating platelets through PARs (PAR4 in mice, PAR1
  and PAR4 in humans), but also activates mural cells and leukocytes through PAR1.
  Partial loss (by haploinsufficiency of TFPI, or HCII in the current study by Aihara
  et al.; ref. ) or interruption (by APC resistance induced by the presence of factor
  V Leiden) of natural inhibitor function is associated with enhanced pathologic remodeling
  in animal models; AT appears to be an exception. Conversely, recombinant anticoagulant
  therapy (e.g., use of VIIai, TFPI, TM, or hirudin) reduces remodeling, as does loss
  or inhibition of the thrombin receptor PAR1. This suggests that thrombin contributes
  to pathologic remodeling and may imply a direct pathway from TF exposure to vascular
  injury through PAR1 signaling (red) (), although other effectors of thrombin or
  upstream coagulation factors may also contribute to this process. VIIai, active
  site-inhibited VIIa.
