caption: 'Shh ligand interacts with its antagonizing receptor Ptch1, which activates
  the effector protein, Smo, leading to nuclear translocation of the Gli family of
  transcriptional factors: Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. While Gli1 and Gli2 act primarily
  as transcriptional activators, Gli3 blocks subsequent transcription of Shh pathway
  target genes (Gli1, Ptch1, etc.), acting as an essential negative regulator of Shh
  signaling transduction. Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that Nestin
  mediates Shh pathway associated tumorigenesis by abolishing the inhibitory functions
  of Gli3 on Shh signaling [].'
