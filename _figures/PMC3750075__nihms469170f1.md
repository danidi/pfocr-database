caption: ACK1/TNK2, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK), represents a paradigm of
  tyrosine kinase signaling that appears to be addictive in cancer cells []. Although
  it is ubiquitously expressed, its multi-domain structure and its ability to interact
  with a number of transmembrane RTKs suggests that cell type specific activation
  of ACK1 is dependent on RTKs that are predominantly operational in a particular
  cell type [; ; ; ; ; ; ] (). For example, while ACK1 is activated by EGF stimulation
  in some prostate (LAPC4), ovarian (A2780-CP), lung (H292) and pancreatic (Panc-1)
  cancer cell lines, other cancer derived lines such as the breast cancer cell line
  (MCF7) and the pancreatic cancer cell line (CD18) are reliant on insulin stimulation
  for ACK1 activation [; ; ; ; ; ]. ACK1 signaling acquires further importance due
  to its ability to be activated in the same cell by multiple ligands. For example,
  it is activated by both insulin and heregulin ligands in the breast cancer cell
  line, MCF7 []. This observation becomes particularly significant in cancers that
  develop resistance to inhibition of a singular RTK pathway and have activated alternate
  RTK regulated pathways for their survival.
