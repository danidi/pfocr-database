caption: 'Possible molecular mechanisms by which α-TOS overcomes the resistance of
  erbB2-expressing cells to apoptosis and sensitizes them to hrTRAIL-induced apoptosis.
  Expression of erbB2 leads to the activation of the central survival protein, Akt.
  The kinase then activates a variety of substrates, including NFκB, which causes
  increased expression of the caspase inhibitor, FLIP, and IAPs, which inhibit both
  death receptor-mediated (extrinsic) or mitochondria-dependent (intrinsic) apoptosis.
  We propose that α-TOS suppresses the activation of NFκB by a mechanism that may
  include the inhibition of erbB2, PI3K, or Akt activation. This inhibition results
  in the decreased expression of FLIP and IAPs and in the initiation of apoptotic
  signaling by α-TOS and the sensitization of cells to hrTRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
  C3, C8, and C9: caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9, respectively.'
