caption: 'Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. Wnts are secreted glycoproteins that bind
  to their cognate receptors, Frizzleds. Frizzleds belong to a family of heptahelical,
  G-protein-coupled receptors that bind specific Wnts and transduce the signal to
  downstream signalling pathways. Under basal conditions, cellular -catenin is phosphorylated
  by a Serine/Threonine kinase, Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) in a complex along
  with Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and other elements. The phosphorylated
  -catenin is constantly subjected to a proteasome-mediated degradation. Wnt-activated
  Frizzled (with its co-receptor low-density lipoprotein-related receptor protein-6
  (LRP6)) activate the downstream signalling components including G-proteins, Go and
  Gq, and a phosphoprotein, Dishevelled. Dishevelleds, by an unclear mechanism, lead
  to reduced GSK3 kinase activity. Suppression of GSK3 activity leads to elevation
  of cytosolic and nuclear -catenin levels. Elevated nuclear -catenin levels activates
  the lymphoid-enhancer factor/T-cell factor (Lef/Tcf)-sensitive transcription, turning
  on the genes that are necessary for development. Note: for complete list of proteins
  involved in Wnt signalling, refer to the Wnt home page (http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html).'
