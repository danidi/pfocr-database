caption: 'The schematic depicts the PKR pathway that is initiated following virus
  infection. Expression of PKR is activated by the interferon signaling pathway that
  is initiated upon viral infection. PKR activation (phosphorylation) is induced in
  response to dsRNA that is produced in virally infected cells. Active PKR phosphorylates
  eIF2α and thereby inhibits protein synthesis and blocks the production of viral
  proteins. PKR also activates the transcription factor NF-κB and induces an antiviral
  immune response. In order to counteract this pathway, γ34.5 retargets protein phosphatase-1α
  to induce dephosphorylation of eIF2α. US11 (if present with immediate-early gene
  kinetics) is able to inhibit PKR by a different mechanism, and the multifunctional
  ICP0 protein is also thought to play a role in inactivation of the interferon and
  PKR pathways. Activation of the Ras signaling pathway inhibits PKR activity and
  complements for the lack of γ34.5 (this example illustrates Ras activation after
  binding of EGF to its receptor).HSV: Herpes simplex virus; NF: Nuclear factor; PKR:
  RNA-dependent protein kinase.'
