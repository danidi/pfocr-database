caption: Schematic illustration of Notch signaling pathway. Binding of the extracellular
  part of Notch receptor to ligands of the Delta and Jagged families induces proteolytic
  cleavage of Notch, releasing the intracellular part of the protein (NICD). NICD
  is then translocated to the nucleus and binds to the nuclear transcription factor
  RBP-Jκ inducing its conversion from a repressor into an activator to stimulate the
  transcription of Notch target genes.
