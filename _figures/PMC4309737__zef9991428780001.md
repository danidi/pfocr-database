caption: Hormonal regulation of preantral follicle growth. Selective primordial follicles
  develop to the primary stage under the control of AKT and mTOR signaling (initial
  recruitment), whereas most primordial follicles remain arrested by dormancy factors.
  Once initiated to growth, primordial follicles develop through primary and secondary
  stages before acquiring an antral cavity. Although most early antral follicles undergo
  atresia, select antral follicles supported by cyclic changes in pituitary FSH and
  LH reach the preovulatory stage, capable of releasing mature oocytes after ovulation
  for fertilization (cyclic recruitment) (). In addition to the well-studied role
  of FSH on antral follicle growth (above the dashed line), FSH also regulates preantral
  follicle growth, together with a large number of oocyte- and granulosa cell-derived
  paracrine factors (below the dashed line). Furthermore, development of preantral
  and antral follicle is restrained by the inhibitory Hippo signaling pathway.
