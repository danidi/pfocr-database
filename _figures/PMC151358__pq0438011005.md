caption: A JNK-dependent apoptosis signaling pathway. (A) Schematic illustration of
  MAPK phosphorylation of BimL and BimEL. Two groups of MAPK sites were identified.
  Three Ser-Pro sites are phosphorylated by the ERK group of MAPK within the BimEL-specific
  insert region. In addition, three JNK phosphorylation sites are located within the
  common region of BimL and BimEL that is absent from BimS. Phosphorylation of Bim
  on Thr-56 causes dissociation from DLC1. (B) Schematic illustration of a JNK-dependent
  apoptosis signaling pathway. This signaling pathway is initiated by the phosphorylation
  of Bim and Bmf by JNK. In some cells, JNK may also contribute to Bim expression.
  The phosphorylation by JNK is proposed to cause the release of Bim and Bmf from
  dynein and myosin V motor complexes. The activated Bim and Bmf may directly activate
  Bax and Bak or may indirectly activate Bax and Bak by binding antiapoptotic Bcl2
  family proteins (e.g., Bcl2 and Bcl-Xl). These mechanisms can lead to the engagement
  of the Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Smac, second mitochondria-derived
  activator of caspase; HtrA2, second homology of the bacterial HtrA endoprotease;
  AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; and EndoG, endonuclease G.
