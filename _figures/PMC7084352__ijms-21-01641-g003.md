caption: 'Alterations in expression of L-arginine/NO pathway enzymes in inflamed and
  quiescent tissue from patients with Crohn’s disease as compared to normal small
  bowel tissue derived from patients with ulcerative colitis. Changes observed in
  inflamed small bowel are marked by red arrows and changes observed in quiescent
  small bowel by blue arrows. Pathway players analyzed in the current study are written
  in black: metabolites in straight font and enzymes in italics. Inhibition is marked
  as T-arrows (as a dashed line if the effect is weak). PRMT, arginine N-methyltransferase;
  PM, plasma membrane; CATs, cationic amino acid transporters; DDAH, dimethylarginine
  dimethylaminohydrolase; DMA, dimethylamine; ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; SDMA,
  symmetric dimethylarginine; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; ARG, arginase;
  ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; protein-CH3, methylated proteins.'
