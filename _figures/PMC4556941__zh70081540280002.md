caption: 'Key mechanisms regulating vascular smooth muscle tone. Signaling events
  that promote vasoconstriction are indicated in red, and those that promote vasodilation
  are indicated in blue. The phosphophorylation (P) of myosin is a critical step in
  contraction of vascular smooth muscle. Vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and
  norepinephrine promote increased cystolic calcium concentration (Ca2+); this in
  turn activates myosin kinase leading to myosin-actin interactions leading to vasoconstriction
  of the vessel. SNP associations are observed in the genes indicated in the red text
  (AGT, angiotensinogen; ADRB1, beta 1 adrenergic receptor). Vasodilators such as
  atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and nitric oxide via cyclic guanosine monophosphate
  (cGMP) activate myosin phosphatase, which leads to dephosphorylation of myosin and
  relaxation. Further SNP associations have been found in this pathway, also indicated
  in red text [endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS); ANP; guanylate cyclase α-
  and β-subunits (GUCYA and GUCY B, respectively)]. Genetic associations are also
  observed in the natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) gene that, via a separate
  pathway, leads to vasodilation in vascular smooth muscle. Other abbreviations: AT1-R,
  angiotensin 1 receptor; CNP, c type natriuretic peptide; ANP-R, atrial natriuretic
  peptide receptor. Figure is adapted from Ref. .'
