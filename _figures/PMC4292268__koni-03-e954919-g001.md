caption: Tumor-associated antigen specific T cells are a promising immunotherapeutic
  target in hepatocellular carcinoma. (A) Tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific
  CD8+ T cells are present in the natural T-cell repertoire. However, they show a
  severe functional impairment. Several immunosuppressive mechanisms contribute to
  this T-cell failure, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibitory receptors.
  Indeed, Tregs are enriched in liver and tumor tissue. Furthermore, the inhibitory
  receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is expressed heterogeneously on TAA-specifically
  expanded CD8+ T cells . (B) Depletion of Tregs prior to antigen-specific expansion
  in vitro induces an increased proliferation of TAA-specific CD8+ T cells but does
  not restore effector function. The mechanisms contributing to the impaired effector
  function are not fully understood. However, blockage of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway results
  in a restored IFNγ production in single cases. (C) The aim of an efficient immunotherapeutic
  approach is to induce proliferation and effector function in TAA-specific CD8+ T
  cells. Thus, it is crucial to address several immune suppressive mechanisms in future
  trials in order to unlock the immune system's full antitumoral potential.
