caption: (A) Inactivation of ErbB signaling by monoclonal antibodies. Binding of antibody
  to EGFR may cause receptor internalization and degradation (i). An ErbB-specific
  antibody may sterically block receptor dimerization (ii). The use of two anti-ErbB
  antibodies may produce a synergistic effect to inhibit ErbB-mediated signaling and
  transformation in a more complete manner (iii). (B) The ErbB-specific TKIs target
  the ATP-binding site of the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor and directly
  inhibit ErbB receptor kinase activity. These small molecules can be used either
  as a single agent (i) or in combination (ii). The pan-specific ErbB-targeted TKI
  can simultaneously target multiple ErbB receptors (iii). (C) Mechanisms of resistance
  to ErbB-targeted therapy. ErbB-targeted therapeutics cause downregulation of the
  MAPK, mTOR, and PI3K signaling pathways (dashed lines indicate reduction of signaling).
  Resistance may arise in tumor cells through allelic and adaptive changes, leading
  to activation of PI3K through other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In this issue
  of the JCI, Guix et al. () demonstrate that downregulation of IGFBP-3 and -4, negative
  regulators of IGF-IR signaling, causes activation of IGF-IR and the PI3K-Akt pathway
  and contributes to the resistance of human squamous carcinoma cells to the EGFR
  inhibitor gefitinib. The heterotetramer of IGF-IR has been simplified in this schematic
  representation.
