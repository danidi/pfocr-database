caption: Role of mucins in CSCs. (A) Mucin 1 is overexpressed in human pluripotent
  stem cells and CSCs. Mucin 1 is hypoglycosylated in a CSC population. (B) Mucin
  4 expression increases CSC population and provides drug resistance by Her2-mediated
  signaling. (C) Mucin 16 expressing cells identified as CSCs and Mucin 16 expression
  shown to regulate stem cell transcription factors LMOA2 and NANOG through the JAK/STAT
  pathway.
