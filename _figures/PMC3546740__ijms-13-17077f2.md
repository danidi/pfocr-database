caption: 'Simplified schematic overview of the biosynthesis of the main secondary
  metabolites stored and/or secreted by tomato glandular trichome cells. Major pathway
  names are shown in red, key enzymes or enzyme complexes in purple, and stored and/or
  secreted compounds in blue. Metabolic routes are projected onto their subcellular
  location, however final modification reactions (e.g., glycosylations, acylations,
  methylations, hydroxylations), which can take place at various organelles, are not
  shown for clarity. Abbreviations used: 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; ACP, acyl carrier
  protein; BCKD, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (multi-enzyme complex); C4H,
  cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; CoA, coenzyme A; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; DTS,
  diterpene synthase; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FAS,
  fatty acid synthesis, FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  GGPP, geranylgeranyldiphosphate; GPP, geranyldiphosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  Leu, leucine; the non-mevalonate pathway, also known as the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4-phosphate (MEP) or 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway; MTS, monoterpene
  synthase; MVA pathway, mevalonate pathway; NPP, neryldiphosphate; PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Phe, phenylalanine; STS, sesquiterpene
  synthase; Val, valine. Solid black arrows indicate established biochemical reactions.
  Dashed black arrows indicate hypothetical reactions. A single arrow does not necessarily
  represent a single enzymatic conversion.'
