caption: 'Overview of the Notch signaling pathway.(a) Schematic depiction of mammalian
  Notch receptors and DSL ligands. Notch receptors are large single-pass Type I membrane
  proteins. The extracellular domain has 29-36 epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats,
  followed by the conserved Lin12-Notch repeats (LNR: light green) and a heterodimerization
  domain (HD). The LNR and HD domains constitute the Negative regulatory region (NRR).
  The single transmembrane domain (TMD: pink) is followed by the RBPjκ association
  module (RAM) domain (purple), nuclear localization sequences (NLSs: blue), 7 ankyrin
  repeats (ANK) (light blue), and a transactivation domain containing a C-terminal
  proline/glutamic acid/serine threonine-rich motifs (PEST: gray). The major Notch
  ligands are also Type I membrane proteins that have an N-terminal Delta/Serrate/LAG-2
  (DSL: light pink) domain and multiple EGF motifs (light blue). The ligands can be
  further classified based on the presence or absence of the Cysteine-rich (CR; purple)
  and of the Delta and OSM-11-like protein (DOS; lavender) domains.(b) Canonical Notch
  signaling pathway. Notch receptors are expressed at the plasma membrane as intramolecular
  heterodimers, held together by non-covalent interactions within the heterodimerization
  domain (HD). The receptors are activated by binding to ligands presented by a neighboring
  signal-sending cell. Ligand endocytosis is thought to generate the force needed
  to unfold the NRR (and perhaps dissociate the HD) to expose S2 to ADAM cleavage.
  Ectodomain shedding generates the membrane-anchored intermediate NEXT (Notch extracellular
  truncation), which is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase progressively within the
  TMD to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and the Nβ peptides. γ-secretase
  cleavage of Notch can occur at the cell surface or in an endosomal compartment.
  Once released, NICD translocates to the nucleus, associates with DNA-binding protein
  CSL and the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind to activate transcription. Some
  Notch ligands also go through sequential cleavages by ADAM proteases and γ-secretase.
  ADAM-mediated shedding of ligand ectodomains has been shown to modulate the strength
  and timing of Notch pathway activity. The role of the γ-secretase cleavage of ligands
  and released ligand intracellular domain fragments is still unclear.(c) TMD region
  of mouse Notch1, showing cleavage sites and products. Notch is cleaved by an ADAM
  protease at the S2 site. After ectodomain shedding, γ-secretase cleaves the Notch
  TMD, starting at the S3 site. Multiple scissile bonds can be cleaved to release
  different NICD molecules with varying N-terminal residues. Only NICD-V (blue) is
  resistant to N-end rule degradation and is likely the major biologically functional
  species. TMD proteolysis then proceeds toward S4 until the Nβ peptides can be released.'
