caption: Gestational diabetes is associated with reduced adenosine transport through
  the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) leading to an increase
  (vertical arrows) of extracellular concentrations of this nucleoside. Adenosine
  then activates the A2a subtype of the adenosine receptors in the plasma membrane
  of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Following the stimulation of
  A2a purinoceptors by adenosine, protein kinase C (PKC) and the 44 kDa and 42 kDa
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (p42/44mapk) are activated stimulating (+)l-arginine
  transport through the human cationic amino acid transporter-1 (hCAT-1) and the activity
  of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) which becomes phosphorylated (∼P) at
  Ser1177. The increase in eNOS activity leads to increased l-arginine conversion
  to l-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO) which then activates hCAT-1 to contribute
  to the stimulatory effect of adenosine on l-arginine transport. NO, PKC and p42/44mapk
  reduce (−) adenosine transport mediated by hENT1. The inhibitory effect of gestational
  diabetes on adenosine transport is also associated with reduced gene transcription
  for hENT1, but increased gene transcription for hCAT-1 and eNOS. Since well-characterized
  antibodies against hENT1 and hCAT-1 are not widely available, question marks indicate
  the possibility that hCAT-1 and/or hENT1 protein levels were also changed in gestational
  diabetes.
