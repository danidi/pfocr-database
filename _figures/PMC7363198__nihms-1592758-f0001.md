caption: 'Alterations in genes (red symbols) thought to contribute to acquired resistance
  by turning the MAPK pathway back-on after prolonged selection with BRAF inhibitors.
  These alterations include transcriptional upregulation of multiple receptor tyrosine
  kinases, transcriptional/mutational upregulation of KRAS or NRAS, BRAFV600 mutant
  amplification or alternative splicing, and MEK1/2 mutations that result in so-called
  RAF-regulated MEK mutants. These genomic or non-genomic alterations converge on
  and augment two protein/protein interactions (shown as double-headed green arrows):
  “back-to-back” BRAF/BRAF (BRAF/CRAF) or “face-to-face” BRAF/MEK (CRAF/MEK) interactions.
  Adaptive resistance occurs early during the course of treatment and can result from
  relief of negative feedback, resulting in rebound levels of signals, including RTK-mediated
  RAS/RAF activation. The RTK implicated in adaptive vemurafenib resistance in colon
  cancer is thought to be EGFR, although multiple receptor tyrosine kinases can be
  upregulated simultaneously and redundantly activate the MAPK and/or PI3K-AKT pathways.'
