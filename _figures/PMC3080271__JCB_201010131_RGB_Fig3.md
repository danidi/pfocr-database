caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic influences on stem cell aging. Age-related changes
  in the systemic milieu, for example, an increased level of inflammatory cytokines
  or Wnt pathway activators in the circulation, can lead to changes of signaling cascades
  and molecular changes within cells. For stem cells, the effects of extrinsic influences
  may also be transmitted indirectly via detrimental changes in the niche. Meanwhile,
  intrinsic changes, such as changes in mitochondrial activity or metabolic rate,
  can also occur during cellular aging. The extrinsic and intrinsic influences converge
  at intracellular molecular effectors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
  can cause either reversible changes (such as protein oxidation) or irreversible
  changes (such as DNA mutations) to macromolecules in the cell. The combinatorial
  effects of genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic changes lead to a decline in cellular
  function, which in turn contributes to tissue dysfunction and organismal aging.
  Because dysfunctional stem cells give rise to abnormal differentiated cells in the
  tissue, stem cell aging exacerbates the extrinsic influences of aging, thereby also
  contributing to the aging process of the tissue and organism.
