caption: (A) Activation of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling may increase the increase
  the transcription of E2F6 which may subsequently increase the expression of c-KIT
  through miR-193a mediated ceRNA mechanism. On the other hand, in addition to transcriptional
  repressor, E2F6 may lead to epigenetic silencing of the miR-193a promoter resulting
  in the up-regulation of c-KIT. The description for each number in the pathway is
  listed in . (B) The biochemical interaction for this proposed miR-193a regulatory
  network. Model variables names for molecule species are also given.
