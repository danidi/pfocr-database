caption: Mechanisms involved in the interactions between autophagy and inhibitory
  cytokines. (a) IL-10 contributes to activation of the JAK-STAT3 and PI3K-Akt-mTORC1
  pathways and thus inhibits autophagy. (b) TGF-β induces autophagy through multiple
  mechanisms, including intervention in the TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK signaling pathway and
  regulation of PED/PEA-15, ROS, and PP2A/FoxO1. However, TGF-β can also inhibit the
  BECN1 promotor and thus reduce autophagy. Autophagy limits TGF-β production through
  lysosomal degradation and may negatively regulate TGF-β signaling through p62 degradation.
  (c) IL-27 activates mTOR and Mcl-1 and negatively regulates autophagy. (d) IL-37
  inhibits mTOR and may have potential negative effects on autophagy.
