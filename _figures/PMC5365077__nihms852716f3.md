caption: Model of mechanically-induced changes in chondrocyte energy metabolism. As
  a source of energy, glucose metabolism begins with glycolysis. Glycolysis can route
  energy to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to make 5-membered sugars including
  nucleic acids. In the presence of oxygen, the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle can
  increase the yield of ATP compared with glycolysis alone. Glucose is also be used
  to make amino acid precursors for protein synthesis. In both cartilage explants
  and 3D cultured chondrocytes, physiological loading (blue) appears to stimulate
  the TCA cycle, while high-magnitude injurious loading (red) increases oxidative
  stress [, , ]. Studies have used small molecule inhibitors, including rotenone,
  oligomycin, and N-acetylcystein (NAC) to modulate metabolic and oxidative processes.
