caption: 'Effects of chemotherapy on coagulation activation. Chemotherapy may cause
  incongruous activation of hemostasis through various mechanisms: direct endothelial
  cell toxicity and apoptosis; vascular cell activation, resulting in tissue factor
  (TF) exposure; production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); unbalance of factors
  involved in the control of the coagulation cascade, with an impairment of the protein
  C (PC)/protein S (PS) anticoagulant pathway; activation of the monocyte/macrophage
  system and platelets. aPC: activated Protein C; (O2•−): superoxide anion; (OH•):
  radical hydroxyl radical; (NO•): nitric oxide; TF: tissue factor.'
