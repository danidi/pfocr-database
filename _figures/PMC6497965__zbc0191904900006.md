caption: A proposed signaling cascade for phosphorylated PCNA-promoted EMT. Phosphorylated
  PCNA causes abnormal DNA replication and replication stress because of its role
  in mediating error-prone DNA synthesis, which activates the ATM DNA damage response
  pathway, leading to G2/M cell cycle arrest. The activated ATM then triggers a cascade
  of signaling reactions that mediates the phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3β, and Snail
  in favor of EMT. Blue and red arrows represent down-regulation and up-regulation,
  respectively.
