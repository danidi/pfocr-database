caption: Representation of the betalain biosynthetic pathway in red beet. l-DOPA is
  formed from tyrosine by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP76AD1 or CYP76AD6. l-DOPA
  is then converted to cyclo-DOPA (cDOPA) or to betalamic acid, via enzymatic reactions
  involving CYP76AD1 or DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DOD), respectively. Betalamic acid next
  conjugates spontaneously with amino acids to form yellow betaxanthins, or with cDOPA
  to form betanidin, the aglycone precursor for red-violet betacyanins. Expression
  of the pX11 vector results mainly in production of betacyanins, while pX13 expression
  leads to formation of betaxanthins only, and pX12 expression directs flux toward
  the synthesis of both classes of pigments.
