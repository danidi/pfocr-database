caption: Pathways of Pol δ holoenzyme assembly and disassembly in vivo revealed by
  SMT. (i) Pol δ and PCNA actively probe genome for target replication sites; (ii)
  stable genome binding by Pol δ and PCNA can occur sequentially or simultaneously,
  resulting in holoenzyme assembly; (iii) DNA synthesis by the assembled holoenzyme;
  and (iv) genome release by Pol δ and PCNA can occur sequentially or simultaneously.
  Bold arrows indicate the predominant assembly/disassembly pathway utilized, where
  PCNA loading precedes Pol δ binding followed by Pol δ dissociation preceding PCNA
  release. Alternate pathways are indicated by lighter images; percentage of alternate
  pathway usage (reported in ) is indicated.
