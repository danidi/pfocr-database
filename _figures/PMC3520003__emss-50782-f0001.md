caption: Simplified summary of the role of ATGL in macrophages.FFAs which are taken
  up by macrophages are incorporated into TGs (and cholesteryl esters). LD-associated
  ATGL, most likely together with its activator CGI-58, hydrolyzes TGs to generate
  DGs and FFAs. Activated FAs are utilized as energy substrate and PPAR signaling
  molecules. In the absence of ATGL, TGs accumulate within macrophages, resulting
  in TG-rich foam cells. Reduced FFA concentrations, due to defective TG hydrolysis,
  lead to decreased PPAR signaling, reduced ATP levels and impaired phagocytosis.
  Increased ROS production inhibits SHP-2, leading to sustained phosphorylation and
  activation of FAK, defective small Rho GTPase activation, and reduced migration
  capacity of macrophages. In addition, ATGL deficiency results in endoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+ depletion and a concomitant increase in cytosolic Ca2 +, which induces the
  unfolded protein response. Increased ceramide C16:0 concentrations cause dysfunctional
  mitochondria and activate the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Impaired phagocytosis,
  reduced numbers of WBCs, decreased migration and inflammation and activation of
  programmed cell death lead to reduced early atherosclerosis. Data are summarized
