caption: 'General scheme for non-polar and polar lipid biosynthesis (based on Ref.
  [–]). Glycerol phosphate pathway for synthesis of triacylglycerols. Two subsequent
  acylation steps of glycerol phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT)
  and 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) lead to phosphatidic acid
  (PA). A lipin family enzyme then converts PA into diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG can
  enter the Kennedy pathway for phosphatidylcholine or after the addition of a third
  acyl chain can be converted to triacylglycerol (TAG) through the action of diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase (DGAT). The Kennedy pathway of PC. After phosphorylation of choline
  catalysed by choline kinase (CK) CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) catalyses
  activation of phosphocholine with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This activated form
  is transferred to DAG and PC is formed. This reaction is catalysed by cholinephosphotransferase
  (CPT). The remodeling Lands cycle for PC. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) hydrolyses the
  acyl chain from the sn-2 position of a PC and generates a lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC). Subsequently lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) catalyses reacylation
  of LPC with a second fatty acid (in the form of fatty acyl-CoA). Other abbreviations:
  ATP-adenosine triphosphate; ADP-adenosine diphosphate; CDP-cytidine diphosphate;
  CMP-cytidine monophosphate; PP-diphosphate; CoA-coenzyme A'
