caption: ISG15 regulates IFN-γ immunity against pathogen infection. Pathogen infection
  triggers the release of IFN-α/β and in turn upregulates ISG15 expression in the
  cells, including granulocytes, which are the major source for the secretion of free
  ISG15 into extracellular compartment. Subsequent induction of IFN-γ production mainly
  from NK cells by free ISG15 plays an essential role in IFN-γ immunity against the
  pathogen infection. Potential feedback between IFN-γ production and IFN-α/β signal
  pathway is unclear. M, macrophage; T, T cell; B, B cell; NK, natural killer cell;
  APC, antigen presenting cell.
