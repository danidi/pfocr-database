caption: An example of PSCP files in which multiple microarray datasets were analyzed
  simultaneously. The PSCP file for "Cholesterol Synthesis" pathway analyzed for the
  data from 11 different microarray datasets or CRI files representing a time course
  experiment (see  for description of material and data preparation). Pooled hepatic
  mRNA were isolated from female wild type mice sacrificed at different time points
  during fetal and post-natal development indicated. The time point at 9 day before
  birth was used as the reference level of mRNA. "Day-5" and "Day-3" indicates 5 days
  or 3 day prior to birth, respectively.
