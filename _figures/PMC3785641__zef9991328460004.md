caption: Osteocyte regulation of bone remodeling. Osteocytes express RANKL and macrophage-colony
  stimulating factor (M-CSF) to promote, and OPG and NO to inhibit, osteoclast formation
  and activity. Osteocytes also regulate bone formation via the secretion of modulators
  of the Wnt signaling pathway. PGE2, NO, and ATP act to activate Wnt signaling, whereas
  sclerostin, DKK1, and SFRP1 all inhibit Wnt signaling and subsequent osteoblast
  activity. Maintenance of this balance between resorption and formation by the osteocyte
  is essential for bone homeostasis.
