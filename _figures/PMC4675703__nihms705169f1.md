caption: (A) The complement response as a driver of clinical conditions. On a diseased
  cell surface, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and/or (auto)antibodies
  may trigger complement activation via binding of pattern recognition receptors of
  the classical (CP) and lectin pathways (LP) or through probing via the tick-over
  mechanisms of the alternative pathway (AP). The formation of convertases leads to
  the cleavage of C3 and deposition of C3b, which forms additional convertases and
  amplifies the response via the AP. C3b deposition also enables the formation of
  C5 convertases, thereby leading to the generation of membrane attack complexes (MAC)
  and the inflammatory effector C5a, which can exacerbate tissue damage and fuel an
  additional complement response. This process is counteracted by regulators of complement
  activation (RCA) that act on the C3 convertase and mediate the degradation of C3b
  by factor I (FI), generating opsonin fragments with distinct biological activities.
  (B) A molecular view of C3 activation and its regulation. Initial deposition of
  C3b by any route allows the binding of factor B (FB) and formation of the AP C3
  convertase after cleavage by factor D (FD). C3 likely binds to the assembled convertase
  through a dimerization site, thereby enabling the removal of C3a and the generation
  of additional C3b that can participate in convertase formation. Binding of RCAs
  to C3bBb leads to accelerated decay of the convertase by competitive removal of
  Bb and provides a platform for the binding of FI to mediate the cleavage of C3b
  to iC3b and C3dg. (C) The various concepts to therapeutically control activation
  of C3. Whereas antibodies against C3b or FB prevent the formation of the pro-convertase
  (1, 2), mAb- or small molecule-based inhibitors of FD block the conversion to the
  active convertase (3, 4). C3 inhibitors of the compstatin family protect native
  C3 by preventing its binding to and cleavage by C3 convertases (5). C3 may also
  be depleted via cleavage by cobra venom factor or anti-C3 proteases (6, 7). The
  breakdown of the convertase and C3b can be therapeutically enhanced by adding recombinant
  FI (8) or by providing purified, recombinant and/or engineered RCA (9). Surfaces
  may also be coated by entities that recruit factor H (FH) from the circulation (10)
  or by tethered RCA constructs (11). In panels B and C, the structural figures have
  been prepared using the crystal structures of C3 (PDB 2A73) (), C3a (PDB 4HW5) (),
  C3b (PDB 2I07) (), C3d (PDB 1C3D) (), FB (PDB 2OK5) (), FI (PDB 2XRC) (), C3bBD
  (PDB 2XWB) (), C3b2Bb2SCIN2 (PDB 2WIN) (), and C3b/FH1-4 (PDB 2WII) (). The complex
  between C3b, FH1-4, and FI was prepared according to published instructions ().
  The hypothetical structure of full-length FH in panel C was composed from multiple
  copies of FH1-4 derived from the C3b/FH1-4 complex.
