caption: '(A) The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.  Conjugation of ubiquitin to the target
  protein: 1)  activation of ubiquitin by E1. 2) Transfer of the activated ubiquitin  moiety
  to a member of the E2 family of enzymes. 3) Formation of a  binary complex between
  E3 and the protein substrate. 4) Formation of a  ternary E2-E3-protein substrate
  complex. 5) Transfer of the activated  ubiquitin moiety from E2 to E3. 6) Synthesis
  of protein  substrate-anchored polyubiquitin chain. 7) Recycling of E2 and E3.  Degradation
  of the polyubiquitin-conjugated substrate by the  proteasome: 8) Transfer of the
  protein substrate-ubiquitin adduct  to the symmetrical 19S-20S-19S proteasome. 9)
  Transfer of the protein  substrate-ubiquitin adduct to the putative asymmetrical
  19S-20S-PA28  proteasome. 10) Generation of large peptides by the symmetrical  19S-20S-19S
  proteasome. 11) “Trimming” of the large peptides into  precise antigenic epitopes
  in a two-step mechanism by the asymmetrical  19S-20S-PA28 or the symmetrical PA28-20S-PA28
  proteasomes. 12)  Generation of free amino acids by the symmetrical or asymmetrical  PA28-containing
  proteasomes. 13) Recycling of ubiquitin by ubiquitin  C-terminal hydrolases (isopeptidases).
  Ub-R denotes ubiquitin chain  receptor (binding) subunit of the 19S complex. (B)
  The  (αβ)3 structure of the PA28 complex.'
