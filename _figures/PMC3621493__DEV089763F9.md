caption: Model for Lis1 function in hair cell planar polarity. (A) During mouse embryonic
  development, Lis1 regulates the organization of centriolar microtubules and their
  interactions with the nearby cell cortex. These interactions allow cortical translocation
  of microtubule-associated Tiam1, leading to local activation of Rac-PAK signaling.
  In turn, localized Rac-PAK activity serves as a polarity cue to position the basal
  body. The core PCP pathway spatially orients the cortical domain of Rac-PAK signaling.
  (B) In postnatal hair cells, Lis1 regulates both pericentriolar matrix organization
  and cortical dynein, which together allow generation of the pulling force on centriolar
  microtubules that is necessary to maintain centrosome positioning. The core PCP
  pathway may coordinate with cortical proteins to spatially regulate dynein activity.
