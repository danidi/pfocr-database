caption: (A) ILG suppresses TNF-α-induced MCP-1 mRNA expression and secretion in adipocytes,
  coincident with inhibition of NF-κB activation. In addition, ILG restores inhibition
  of Akt phosphorylation under insulin receptor signaling in TNF-α-stimulated adipocytes.
  ILG also suppresses palmitic acid-induced TNF-α mRNA and secretion in macrophages,
  with decreasing the level of phosphorylated MAPK (Jnk) expression. It remains unclear
  whether NF-κB is involved in palmitic acid-induced TNF-α mRNA and secretion in macrophages.
  (B) Lipid A- or TDM-induced expression of fibrosis-related genes such as TIMP-1
  is potently suppressed by a NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 relative to a MAP kinase
  inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that NF-κB may play a key role in the induction of
  those expressions. ILG inhibits TLR4- or Mincle-stimulated expression of fibrosis-related
  genes in macrophages, presumably through inhibition of NF-κB pathway.
