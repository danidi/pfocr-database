caption: BAFF, APRIL, and their receptors; BAFF binds with high affinity to both BAFF-R
  and TACI but with weak affinity to BCMA; APRIL conversely binds TACI and BCMA but
  does not bind BAFF-R. BAFF-R ligation primarily results in the activation of the
  nonclassincal NF-κB2 pathway, whereas TACI or BCMA ligation initiates the classical
  NF-κB1 pathway. These downstream signaling cascades promote cell survival and growth.
