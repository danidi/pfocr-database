caption: The death receptor signaling in SIVA. Death receptors (DR) signal is present
  also in alert cells of the major organs and vasculature in SIRS-associated vasculitis
  (SIVA) including sepsis. TNF-R1, Fas (CD95), DR4 (TRAIL receptor 1), and DR5 (TRAIL
  receptor 2) have a death signal in alert cells via adaptor molecules of TRADD and
  FADD. On the other side, TNF-R1 produces the anti-apoptotic factors such as FLIP
  and BclX via activation of NF-κB through RIP1-TRAF pathway. When NF-κB activity
  decreases and AP-1 activity increases, DR family and FADD tend to proceed apoptosis
  in alert cells in vascular endothelium. TNF-R1 tumor necrosis factor receptor 1,
  TRADD TNF receptor-associated death domain protein, RIP1 receptor-interacting protein
  1, IKK inhibitory-κB kinase, TRAF tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor,
  FADD Fas-associated death domain protein, NF-κB nuclear factor-κB, FLIP FLICE inhibitory
  protein
