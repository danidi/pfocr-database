caption: Model of a proposed functional role for PKC βII in colon carcinogenesis.
  PKC βII is proposed to function in the Wnt signaling pathway in the colonic epithelium.
  (A) During embryogenesis, Wnt signals through Dsh to PKC βII, which phosphorylates
  GSK-3β to inhibit its activity. β-catenin levels rise, leading to Tcf-dependent
  activation of transcription of growth-related genes. (B) In the adult colonocyte,
  Wnt is not present, GSK-3β activity is constitutively high, and APC binds β-catenin
  and targets it for degradation. (C) In transgenic PKC βII mice, PKC βII levels and
  activity are elevated. PKC βII can induce phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β.
  β-catenin levels rise and Tcf-dependent transcription of growth-related genes is
  induced, leading to increased proliferation. Similarly, AOM treatment leads to increased
  expression of PKC βII stimulating this proliferative pathway during colon carcinogenesis.
  Biochemical evidence suggests that PKC βII can be activated by various lipid components
  of a cancer-promotive diet, including free fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and
  bacterially-derived DAG. Direct stimulation of PKC βII by these factors leads to
  Wnt-independent activation of the APC/β-catenin signaling pathway, hyperproliferation,
  and enhanced susceptibility to colon carcinogenesis.
