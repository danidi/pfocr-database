caption: Opposing actions of extracellular versus intracellular Hsp70 on NF-κB pathway
  activation. Extracellular Hsp70 contributes to the inflammatory response through
  acting as a ligand for TLR4 via which it results in activation of the NF-κB pathway
  (1). Intracellular Hsp70 blocks NF-κB activation and p50/p65 nuclear translocation
  through inhibition of IKK mediated IκB phosphorylation. Hsp70 heat shock protein
  70, TLR4 Toll-like receptor 4, NF-κB nuclear factor kappaB, IKK IκB kinase
