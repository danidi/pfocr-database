caption: 'Overview of the DSB repair mechanisms. DSBs are repair by one of two major
  pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). Classical
  NHEJ (C-NHEJ) directly re-ligates the two ends together while HR utilizes homologous
  template and is active in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when a sister chromatid
  is available. RPA initially binds to the 3′ ssDNA overhangs produced by end resection
  and is then replaced by Rad51 in a reaction requiring the Rad52 or BRCA2 mediator
  protein. The Rad51-ssDNA complex promotes the homology search and strand invasion,
  pairing the invading 3′ end with one strand of the donor duplex to template DNA
  synthesis. Resected intermediates can also be channeled to the MH-mediated end joining
  (MMEJ) pathway.'
