caption: Effects of PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway dysregulation in prostate tumor cells. The
  noncanonical activation of AKT via IL‐6 signaling, ROS accumulation, and ER stress
  response in prostate cancer tumor cells is illustrated. Increased PI3K/PTEN/AKT
  pathway activation leads to prostate tumor cell survival (i.e., increased angiogenesis/lipid
  biosynthesis and decreased apoptosis) and the recruitment of myeloid cells. Binding
  of IL‐6 to its receptor activates JAK, which leads to the phosphorylation of PI3K
  and, ultimately, to AKT signaling. Accumulation of ROS can also indirectly mediate
  AKT phosphorylation by down‐regulating PTEN, which leads to unregulated PI3K activity.
  Finally, the ER stress response may also increase AKT signaling via the dissociation
  of HSPA5 from the ER sensors (PERK, IRE‐1α, and ATF6), although the precise mechanism(s)
  by which this occurs are currently unclear. In addition, XBP1s, generated by IRE‐1α
  RNase activity, increases lipid biosynthesis (saturated FA), which may also activate
  ER stress and maintain AKT signaling. HSPA5, heat shock protein family A member
  5; IL‐6R, IL‐6 receptor; IL6ST, IL‐6 signal transducer.
