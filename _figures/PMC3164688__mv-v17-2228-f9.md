caption: 'Overview of the proposed mechanism by which microR-29b indirectly regulates
  the expression of PKR associated protein X (RAX) in the retinal neurons of the rat.
  According to our hypothesis, the upregulation of miR-29b in retinal neurons of diabetic
  rats may result in down-regulation of RAX which decreases the activated PKR level
  with subsequent reduction of the activity of the pro-apoptotic PKR signaling pathway.
  Abbreviations: Sp1 represents transcription factor Specificity protein 1; miR-29b
  represents microRNA-29b; RAX represents PKR associated protein X; PKR represents
  RNA-dependent protein kinase.'
