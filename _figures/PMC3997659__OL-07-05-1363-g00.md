caption: Role of Ub and SUMO modification of PCNA. PCNA may be modified by monoubiquitination,
  Lys-63-linked polyUb chains or SUMO at the same lysine 164 residue. PCNA monoubiquitination
  catalyzed by Rad6 and Rad18 directly activates TLS polymerases (such as pol η, Rev1
  and pol ζ), which enable error-free or error-prone damage bypass, whereas Ubc13/Mms2
  and Rad5 are required to extend the modification by a Lys-63-linked polyUb chain.
  PCNA polyubiquitination may occur if TLS fails, which subsequently results in a
  recombination-related error-free DNA damage tolerance pathway. Sumoylation of PCNA
  occurs in the S phase and attracts the antirecombinogenic helicase, Srs2, to inhibit
  unwanted recombination during DNA synthesis, however, ubiquitination of PCNA specifically
  occurs in cells with DNA damage or stalled replication. SUMO, small ubiquitin-related
  modifier; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; pol, polymerase; TLS, translesion
  synthesis; UBC, ubiquitin-conjugating; DSB, double-strand break; Ub, ubiquitin;
  HR, homologous recombination.
