caption: Neural architecture of explicit, rule-based category learning. Solid lines
  indicate excitatory input; dashed lines indicate inhibitory input. Generation of
  rules depends upon dopamine (DA) activity within the ventral cortico-striatal circuit,
  including nucleus accumbens (NAc), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior cingulate
  cortex (ACC). Active maintenance of the rule in use depends upon recurrent excitation
  of the fronto-thalamic loop that represents that rule. Positive feedback supports
  rule maintenance through a phasic DA bursts to caudate, which increases excitation
  of the “Go” pathway and inhibition of the “NoGo” pathway and enables disinhibition
  of the relevant fronto-thalamic loop. Negative feedback triggers a phasic dip in
  DA availability in caudate, resulting in enhanced inhibitory output from GPi. This
  destabilizes the relevant rule representation in WM and increases the likelihood
  of a shift. Release of norepinephrine from the locus ceruleus may also govern shifting
  activity. Selection of the new rule depends upon the relative pattern of activation
  within ACC, which biases the relative patterns of activation of rule representations
  in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Unexpected negative or positive feedback triggers a
  phasic dip or burst, respectively, in DA release from the ventral tegmental area.
  These phasic changes alter activation in NA and ACC and these error-driven changes
  in ACC activation regulate activation of relevant rule representations in PFC.
