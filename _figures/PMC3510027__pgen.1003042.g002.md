caption: (A) IPA network of the HD suppressor genes that could be directly connected
  to each other without intervening nodes. This network was constructed using data
  from all Ingenuity model organisms. Huntingtin (HTT) was manually added to this
  network, and its connections colored red. Functions of nodes are indicated with
  icons. “Direct Relationship” (solid lines) indicates direct physical contact between
  two molecules, e.g. binding or phosphorylation. “Indirect Relationship” (dotted
  lines) indicates a functional interaction that does not require physical contact
  between the two molecules, e.g. signaling events. See also .
