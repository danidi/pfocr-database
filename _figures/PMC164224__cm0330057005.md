caption: Neuronal cell death pathways may be divided into necrotic pathways, caspase-independent
  apoptotic pathway, and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Bacterial and host oxidants
  cause damage to cell membranes via lipid peroxidation, leading to loss of membrane
  integrity and depolarization and finally necrotic cell death. Oxidants also cause
  DNA damage, resulting in the energy-consuming activation of the poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase (PARP). When DNA repair is futile because of the magnitude of the damage,
  massive energy depletion will cause necrotic cell death. Oxidants, high concentrations
  of excitatory amino acids (EAA), and bacterial toxins such as the pneumolysin of
  S. pneumoniae or the hemolysin of S. agalactiae all cause increased cytosolic free
  calcium levels. This may result in PARP activation and contribute to necrotic death
  but primarily causes damage to the mitochondrial outermembranes with PARP-dependent
  release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Free cytosolic apoptosis-inducing factor
  will move into the nucleus and cause chromatin condensation and apoptotic cell death.
  Release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α in response to the invading bacterial
  pathogens will result in activation of caspases. This results in activation of the
  apoptotic pathway and will also inhibit necrosis through inactivation of PARP. Release
  of cytochrome c from mitochondria following mitochondrial damage in response to
  increased cytosolic free calcium levels also causes activation of caspases and apoptotic
  death. As indicated in the figure, several crossroads exist between the different
  death pathways. In many cases, both necrotic and apoptotic cell death may be revealed
  on histologic examination.
