caption: 'Different colors rectangular frames represent different metabolic pathways.
  The gene with an asterisk indicats the gene produced mutation. The gene without
  asterisk indicats the gene is native gene. The novel metabolic pathways for accumulating
  precursor products is illustrated with the following pathways, labeled MEp I (LEU2-ILV2*-ILV5*),
  MepII (ILV2*-ILV5*-ILV3), MepIII (BAT2*), MepIV (LEU4-LEU1*), MepV (LEU1*-LEU2)
  and MepVI(BAT2*-LEU4-LEU1*), Metabolic pathway I, Ia, Ib including LEU2, ILV2*,
  ILV5*; Metabolic pathway II, IIa, IIb including ILV2*, ILV5*, ILV3; Metabolic pathway
  III including BAT2*; Metabolic pathway IV, IVa including LEU4, LEU1*; Metabolic
  pathway V, Va including LEU1*, LEU2; Metabolic pathway VI, VIa, VIb including BAT2*,
  LEU4, LEU1*. Another metabolic pathway responsible for the decarboxylation reduction
  reaction, and MepDRVII (kivd-ADH6*) Metabolic pathway VIIincluding kivd, ADH6*.
  LEU2: 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, ILV1: L-serine/L-threonine ammonia-lyase,
  ILV2*: mutant acetolactate synthase, ILV5*: mutant ketol-acid reductoisomerase,
  ILV3: dihydroxy-acid dehydratase, BAT2*: branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase,
  LEU4: 2-isopropylmalate synthase, LEU1*: mutant 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, kivd:
  alpha-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase, ADH6*: mutant alcohol dehydrogenase 6.'
