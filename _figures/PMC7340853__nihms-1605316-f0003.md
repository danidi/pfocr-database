caption: a | Some autoimmune conditions show a pronounced complement involvement.
  In autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AHIA) and cold agglutinin disease (CAD), recognition
  of red blood cells (RBCs) by autoantibodies (AAbs) activates the classical pathway
  (CP). Upon opsonization, formation of C3 and C5 convertases causes intravascular
  haemolysis (IVH). Clusters of erroneously glycosylated IgA can trigger the lectin
  pathway in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), whereas CP activation by anti-acetylcholine receptor
  (AChR) antibodies contributes to some forms of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).
  Finally, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) may trigger the CP to generate
  C5a, which stimulates neutrophils and exacerbates the development of ANCA-associated
  vasculitis (ANCAV). All these conditions may contribute to localized tissue injury
  and inflammatory complications. Current trials focus on preventing lectin pathway
  initiation in IgAN (using anti-mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease
  2 (MASP2)), controlling CP activation and complement amplification in AIHA and CAD
  (using anti-C1s monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or C3 inhibitors of the compstatin
  family) or C5aR1-mediated signalling in ANCAV (using C5aR1 antagonists). The anti-C5
  mAb eculizumab is approved for the treatment of gMG. b | In paroxysmal nocturnal
  haemoglobinuria (PNH), the lack of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored complement
  regulators on clonal populations of RBC predisposes to complement-mediated IVH.
  Whereas C5-targeted therapies effectively prevent IVH, they do not stop ongoing
  opsonization. This may potentially enable extravascular haemolysis (EVH), an unwanted
  effect that is expected to not occur with C3-targeted or convertase-targeted entities.
  Currently, compstatin analogues and small molecule Factor B (FB) and Factor D (FD)
  inhibitors are being evaluated for this purpose. c | Both C3 glomerulopathy (C3G)
  and atypical haemolytic syndrome (aHUS) are rare complement-mediated kidney disorders
  with diverse causes that are typically based on complement dysregulation. In C3G,
  the stabilization of soluble C3 convertases by C3 nephritic factor (C3Nef) often
  leads to C3 consumption with massive deposition of C3 fragments. Therapeutic options
  under consideration focus on preventing C3 convertase formation (FD inhibitors)
  or convertase-mediated C3 cleavage (compstatin and FB inhibitors). In aHUS, complement
  activation is initiated by certain hits; dysregulation by polymorphic surface regulators,
  the prevention of Factor H (FH) surface recognition by autoantibodies or the presence
  of gain-of-function components leads to activation of C5 with formation of C5a and
  membrane-attack complex (MAC) that cause tissue damage, inflammation and thrombotic
  microangiopathy (TMA), which by itself (for example, by release of haem from RBC)
  can act as a secondary hit for aHUS progression. Alongside the approved eculizumab,
  other C5-targeted entities and C5aR1 antagonists are evaluated for the treatment
  of aHUS. CR, complement receptor; PRR, pattern recognition receptor.
