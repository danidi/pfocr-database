caption: The Notch pathway has multiple roles during follicle assembly and growth,
  steroidogenesis, and ovarian vascular development. (A) Bidirectional communication
  between germ cells and somatic support cells is critical for follicle assembly.
  In the mammalian ovary, this process appears to be regulated in large part by the
  modulation of Jag1, and possibly Jag2, transcription in germ cells, which is regulated
  by NOBOX, STAT3, TRKB, and steroid hormone action. Upregulation of Notch ligand
  expression in oocytes facilitates interactions with adjacent pregranulosa cells
  expressing Notch receptor that is supported by growth factors (i.e., GDF9 and BMP15)
  from the oocyte. Notch signaling between germ cells and somatic pregranulosa cells
  promotes follicle assembly and has non-cell autonomous roles on oocyte development
  including the regulation of meiosis and oocyte activation. (B) Notch signaling supports
  follicular growth and maturation by regulating granulosa cell differentiation, proliferation,
  and survival. Formation of zona pellucida in oocytes may impede productive Notch
  signaling between oocytes and granulosa cells; thus, within multi-laminar follicles,
  continued trans-activing interactions between Notch receptors and ligands likely
  occur between juxtaposed granulosa cells. The expression of Notch receptors and
  ligands in these granulosa cells, therefore, must facilitate both bidirectional
  inductive signaling yet overcome cis-inhibition due to receptor ligand co-expression.
  Functionally, continued Notch signaling in growing follicles promotes Foxl2 expression,
  activin action, and has non-cell autonomous effects of oocyte growth and maturation.
  (C) Steroid production in luteal cells is modulated by Notch signaling through transcriptional
  regulation of enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis. Bidirectional inductive
  signaling and cis-inhibitory mechanisms likely coordinate these processes. Notch
  signaling also functions of prevent luteolysis by regulating the expression of the
  anti-apoptotic factor BCL-xL and the pro-survival factor p-AKT. (D) Notch signaling,
  mediated predominately through the actions of Notch1, 3, and 4, regulates bFGF-induced
  VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and the differentiation and activity of endothelial tips
  cells that express DLL4. These events modulate neovascularization and vascular density
  to support follicle growth and progesterone (P4) production. (A–C) The schematic
  representations of cells used in these figures were spatially separated for clarity.
