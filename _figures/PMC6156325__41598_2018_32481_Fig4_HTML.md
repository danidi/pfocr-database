caption: BH4 modulates the nitrosation of key proteins in the Ubiquitin-Proteasome
  system. (A) Qiagen ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA) uncovers ‘protein ubiquitination’
  and (B) the ‘26S Proteasome’ as the top pathway demonstrated to be altered in a
  BH4- and NO-dependent manner, with specific targets highlighted in Blue. (C) Specific
  NO targets (E2N, E2D3 and E2E1) within the E2 conjugating enzymes are illustrated
  in schematic form. (D) IPA analysis also suggests that BH4-dependent modification
  by NO is important to the function of the proteasome multi-catalytic complex (the
  20S core and 19S regulatory particle), and all modified subunits are depicted in
  the schematic.
