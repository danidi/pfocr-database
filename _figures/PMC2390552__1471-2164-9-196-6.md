caption: 'Analysis of Nodal signaling processes in ERK1MO and ERK2MO gene expression
  profiles. The Nodal signaling pathways has been overlaid with gene-expression colour
  criterion and ratios of gene-expression from the program GenMAPP: yellow = up-regulated
  by ERK1MO (ratio > 1), blue = down-regulated by ERK1MO (ratio <1), red = up-regulated
  by ERK2MO (ratio > 1), green = down-regulated by ERK2MO (ratio <1), gray = gene
  is not present on the Agilent zebrafish 22k microarrays or in the GenMAPP database,
  white = not significantly changed. The genes that were affected in their expression
  in both ERK1 and ERK2 morphants show multicolored gene-boxes with the expression
  ratios for both conditions depicted on the right of the gene; the ration for ERK1
  knockdown at the top and ERK2 knockdown below. At the right side of the figure a
  list of responsive target-genes is listed for the Nodal signaling pathway. The bottom
  right of the figure shows a small representation of the predicted Nodal signaling
  activity (dark gray) in the wild type embryos, based on the potential range of signals
  and the expression patterns and range of antagonists adopted from Schier and Talbot
  (2005), late blastula stage, lateral view, dorsal to right and animal pole to top.'
