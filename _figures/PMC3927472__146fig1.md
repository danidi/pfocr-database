caption: Pathways to primary BA. The major adult pathway is the neutral pathway initiated
  by CYP7A1-mediated 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol. There is a minor pathway to
  CDCA termed the acidic pathway initiated by CYP27A1-mediated 27-hydroxylation of
  cholesterol followed by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylation. Synthesis of CDCA through both
  pathways is blocked in CTX with accumulation of ketosterol BA precursors, such as
  7αC4 (from which most 5α-cholestanol is derived). Highlighted in dark gray are the
  disease markers routinely used to test for CTX; 5α-cholestanol in blood (, ), and
  bile alcohols (primarily pentol) in urine (–), and in light gray, ketosterol BA
  precursors, quantification of which we describe here provides an improved blood
  test for CTX.
