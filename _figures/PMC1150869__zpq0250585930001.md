caption: Complex inositol signaling pathways in mice. Two proposed pathways for IP
  synthesis in mammals require the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and conversion
  of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PI(4,5)P2, to I(1,4,5)P3. Pathway I has
  been shown to exist in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis, Drosophila melanogaster,
  and Rattus norvegicus in which I(1,4,5)P3 is converted by Ipk2 (wide black arrows)
  in two steps to I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 by means of I(1,4,5,6)P4 or I(1,3,4,5)P4 intermediates.
  Ipk2 also participates in several other reactions as shown. The 2-kinase activity
  of Ipk1 (wide white arrows) converts IP5 to IP6 and is capable of generating branches
  of I(1,2,4,5,6)P5 or I(1,2,3,4,6)P5. An inositol pyrophosphate synthase (crosshatched
  arrow) is able to generate inositol pyrophosphate PP-IP4 or PP-IP5 species. Pathway
  II is initiated by an IP3 3-kinase (gray arrow) that generates I(1,3,4,5)P4 as its
  sole product, which is then converted to I(1,3,4)P3 by an IP 5-phosphatase (thin
  arrow) and I(1,3,4,6)P4 by means of a I(1,3,4)P3 5/6 kinase (stippled arrows). Ipk2
  then acts as a 5-kinase to convert I(1,3,4,6)P4 to IP5, which is a substrate for
  Ipk1. In both pathways, Ipk2 and Ipk1 function in sequential steps.
