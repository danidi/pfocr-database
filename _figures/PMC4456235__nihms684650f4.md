caption: Overview of myonuclear positioning. (a) In multinucleated myofibers (green),
  microtubules (black dotted lines) originate at the nuclear periphery (minus (−)
  ends) and extend outwards (plus (+) ends). Following myoblast fusion, Kinesin (pink)
  and Ensconsin (Ens, gray triangle) work together to separate adjacent myonuclei
  (white) by crosslinking microtubules and sliding them past one another. Kinesin
  forces also extend the leading edge of moving nuclei (white teardrop) while Dynein
  activity (dark blue) at the rear of the nucleus allows forward motion to complete
  a translocation step. Activation of the JNK signaling pathway (red, curved black
  arrows) phosphorylates (yellow) Sunday Driver (Syd, light blue rod), which facilitates
  Kinesin-dependent relocation of Dynein to the cell periphery. Rapsynoid (Raps, purple)
  anchors Dynein to the cell cortex, and cortical Dynein activity pulls microtubules
  and the attached nuclei closer to the muscle end. During these movements, CLIP-190
  (orange) is necessary to support the integrity of the microtubule network by ensuring
  proper contact with the cell cortex. Straight thin black arrows denote the direction
  of motor protein activity. Large silver arrows highlight the direction of net force
  exerted on nuclei. (b) Within the perinuclear space (PS) of the nuclear envelope,
  SUN proteins (light green) in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) interact with KASH
  proteins (black, brown) in the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) to link the nucleoskeleton
  (light blue, Lamin) and the cytoskeleton (red, Actin) to anchor nuclei in place.
  It has also been proposed that SUN and KASH proteins may directly link the nucleus
  to the motor proteins, Kinesin (pink) and Dynein (blue).
