caption: Knockdown of IL6 in human endothelial cells affects the gene expression of
  proteins known to be involved in IL6-mediated signaling. Knockdown of IL6 was performed
  using siRNA-mediated gene silencing followed by RNA sequencing in cultured human
  vascular endothelial cells. The impact of IL6 knockdown on genes known to be central
  in IL6 signaling (IL6 core genes) was investigated. Green symbols indicate downregulated
  genes, and red/pink symbols indicate upregulated genes. Pathway and coloring were
  generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.
