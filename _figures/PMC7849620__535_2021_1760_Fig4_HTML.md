caption: The mechanisms of abnormal coagulation and hepatic ischemia/hypoxia reperfusion
  injury in COVID-19-associated liver injury. a Abnormal coagulation has been significantly
  associated with poor prognosis for patients with severe COVID-19 with hepatic dysfunction.
  Monocytes are recruited to endothelial cells and express tissue factors (TFs) in
  response to proinflammatory stimuli, and then, activate an extrinsic coagulation
  pathway, leading to fibrin deposition and blood clotting. Neutrophils are recruited
  early to sites of infection and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which
  trigger a cascade of inflammatory reactions and the activation pathway of contact
  coagulation, binding and activating platelets to amplify blood clotting. b Hepatic
  ischemia/hypoxia reperfusion injury involves a biphasic process of ischemia-induced
  cell injury and reperfusion-induced inflammatory response. Ischemic injury, a localized
  process of cellular metabolic disturbances, leads to initial hepatocyte cell death.
  Reperfusion injury, which follows ischemic injury, results not only from metabolic
  disturbances but also from a profound inflammatory immune response that involves
  both direct and indirect cytotoxic mechanisms
