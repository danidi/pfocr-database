caption: The stress-activated p38 MAPK pathway contributes to tumor resistance against
  targeted therapies and chemotherapies in cancers. (a) Overexpression of the human
  epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein has been observed in cancers,
  like breast, and has been associated with the aberrant activation of growth and
  survival pathways, like AKT signaling and ERK signaling. The HER2-targeted antibody
  trastuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 and inhibits HER2 dimerization
  and HER2-mediated signaling events, consequently mitigating tumorigenesis. Ectopic
  activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) breast cancers
  can confer resistance to trastuzumab by promoting cell growth and survival independent
  of HER2 activity []. To date, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between
  HER2 signaling and p38 MAPK remain unknown. (b) Resistance to chemotherapies, like
  cisplatin and dacarbazine, have also been associated with p38 MAPK activity in melanoma
  cells. Chemotherapy-induced cellular stress activates the p38 MAPK pathway, and
  this results in the activation of cellular repair mechanisms that promote tumor
  cell growth and survival. Activation of p38 MAPK is further sustained by the immune
  checkpoint molecule, CD276/B7-H3, which inhibits the p38 MAPK-negative regulator
  dual specificity protein phosphatase 10 (DUSP10) []. To date, the mechanistic relationship
  between CD276/B7-H3 activity and DUSP10 inhibition remains unknown.
