caption: The NF-κB activation pathway is regulated by S-nitrosylation. S-nitrosylation
  of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB causes the inhibition of its binding to DNA.
  Upstream inhibition of the IκB-kinase (IKK) complex's kinase activity is induced
  by S-nitrosylation of the IKKβ subunit, abrogating NF-κB activation. S-nitrosylation
  of CD40 inhibits binding and activation by CD40L. MyD88 S-nitrosylation disrupts
  binding to its upstream partner toll/interleukin-1 receptor adaptor protein (TIRAP),
  which might serve to delay the development of the immune response. On the other
  hand, S-nitrosylation of Src may activate NF-κB (To see this illustration in color,
  the reader is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertpub.com/ars).
