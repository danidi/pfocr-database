caption: The model shows amino acid and IGF stimulation of transcription leading to
  the activation of the myogenic program in Atlantic salmon. It should be noted that
  we have not measured protein levels, protein activity or protein phosphorylation,
  so unconfirmed target proteins are indicated by a question mark. Amino acids stimulate
  IGFBP-5.1, IGFBP-5.2, IGF-I and II expression, which, when translated and secreted
  from the cell, are able to stimulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway leading to a positive
  feedback loop resulting in the synergistically enhanced expression of IGF-I, IGFBP-5.2
  and IGFBP-4. When amino acids are absent, endocrine and paracrine production of
  IGF-I and II stimulate IGFBP-6, which could serve as a mechanism to sequester available
  IGFs and thereby inhibit any positive feedback loops.
