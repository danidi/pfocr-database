caption: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors prevent Aβ accumulation-induced apoptosis and
  synaptic injury in neurons by ameliorating the LDLR downregulation induced by OGD
  damage in microglia, suppressing microglia activity by blocking the pIκBα/pNF-κB
  signaling pathway and decreasing downstream inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α,
  IL-1β, and COX2 and upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
