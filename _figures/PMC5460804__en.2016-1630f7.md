caption: A schematic drawing that illustrates the likely signaling pathway by which
  laminin α2 at the basement membrane regulates Sertoli cell BTB dynamics in the seminiferous
  epithelium of rat testes. Based on the findings reported herein, it is likely that
  an 80-kDa fragment is released from laminin α2 chain in the basement membrane, mediated
  by MMP-9 earlier reported in the rat testis (). Once released, this fragment is
  being transported across the seminiferous epithelium. When the level of this 80-kDa
  laminin fragment is reduced—such as following its knockdown by RNAi as reported
  herein or mediated by its intrinsic downregulation mediated by miRNAs (e.g., endogenouosly
  produced siRNA) or its reduced spatiotemporal expression during the epithelial cycle—rpS6
  is also activated through an induction of p-rpS6, which, in turn, downregulates
  p-Akt1/2. The activation of this mTORC1/rpS6/Akt1/2 signaling pathway induces BTB
  remodeling, causing a gradual disassembly of the “old” BTB above the preleoptotene
  spermatocytes connected in clones. Both TJ and basal ES proteins at the “old” BTB
  undergo endocytosis, transcytosis and recycling as earlier reported () to facilitate
  the assembly of the “new” BTB behind the preleptotene spermatocytes. This thus facilitates
  remodeling of the BTB at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle to support the transport
  of preleptotene spermatocytes across the immunological barrier, illustrating the
  physiological significance of laminin α2 chain in this series of cellular event.
