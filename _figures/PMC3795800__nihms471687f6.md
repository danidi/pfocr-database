caption: Model of HMGB1/RAGE interaction and regulation of metabolism. HMGB1 is released
  following stress/necrosis in cells as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule
  in the tumor microenvironment, promoting inflammation. HMGB1 binds cell membrane
  RAGE or uptake into cells by a caveolin-dependent endocytosis pathway, promoting
  phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), which in turn induces phosphorylation of RAGE.
  Phosphorylation of RAGE at Ser377 is required for its mitochondria-targeted accumulation.
  There it promotes phosphorylation of complex I, which is the first step in the ATP
  biosynthetic pathway. As shown in the summary, the HMGB1–RAGE pathway stimulates
  bioenergetics by enhancing ATP production in a p-ERK1/2-dependent process to sustain
  the increased metabolic needs and growth of tumor cells.
