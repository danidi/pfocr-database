caption: Possible therapeutic interventions on molecular mechanism inducing necrotizing
  enterocolitis. (1) TLR4 induces proinflammatory cytokine via the NFκB pathway. (2)
  Proinflammatory cytokine promotes epithelial injury. (3) NFκB signal increases expression
  of TLR4. (4) TLR signal may be induced directly by bacterial products (i.e., LPS),
  HMGB1, and via NFκB by PAF activated receptor (PAF-R). (5) TRL4 is autoregulated
  by hsp70 proteins. (6) PPAR, blocking NFκB pathway, is a potent inhibitor of TRL4
  signal. (7) Nitric oxide (NO), produced by NO-synthetase, protects epithelium from
  injury. Evidenced in black-block we have reported molecules that may have potential
  therapeutic role in necrotizing enterocolitis, interfering with TRL4 signaling (i.e.,
  inhibition of HMGB1 by 2-P-glycyrrhizate; induction of PPAR by probiotics, fatty
  acids, and EGF; PAF hydrolysis by PAF-acetylhydrolase; induction of Hsp70 by Celastrol;
  blocking proinflammatory cytokine by monoclonal antibodies), or maintaining epithelial
  barrier integrity (i.e., fatty acids, EGF, zinc, and glutamine) or protecting against
  epithelial injury (i.e., NO, probiotics). Please note that this is a simplified
  cartoon; thus reported molecules may play many other functions at mucosal and systemic
  level that may interfere with the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (see
  the text). Direct effects of TLR4 on epithelium are reported in .
