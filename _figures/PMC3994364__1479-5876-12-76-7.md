caption: Proposed mechanism of diet-induced fibrosis in transplanted kidneys. In normocholesterolemic
  condition, transplantation leads to an increase in TGFβ levels resulting in an increase
  in vimentin positive tubules and collagen production which are both involved in
  fibrosis development. Data from this study indicate that the increase in plasma
  OxLDL levels induced by high-fat diet leads to LOX-1 pathway activation by ligand
  fixation and promotes an increase in LOX-1 protein content via either Ox-LDL alone
  or TGFβ stimulation in artery endothelial cells, which in turn over-activates the
  TGFβ signaling pathway. This activation acts in synergy with transplantation to
  increase fibrosis development.
