caption: Schematic diagram of Suc pathway in N2-fixing Anabaena filament cells. Suc
  enzyme localization in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 illuminated filaments based on this
  study and . Photosynthetic C fixation through the Calvin cycle (CC) occurs in the
  vegetative cells and could lead to Suc and glycogen biosynthesis. Heterocysts act
  as an important sink for carbohydrates from vegetative cells and as a source of
  fixed N (). In heterocysts, which could also synthesize glycogen and Suc, the reductants
  for N2 and O2 reduction are generated by the activity of the oxidative pentose-P
  cycle (OPPC), the NADPH heterocyst-specific ferrodoxin, and respiratory electron
  transport (RET), as well as the ATP synthesis by cyclic phosphorylation (PSI). Suc
  enzymes are indicated as (1) SuS; (2) A/N-Inv; (3A) SPS-A; (3B) SPS-B; and (4) SPP.
