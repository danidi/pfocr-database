caption: The Notch signaling pathway and its roles in cancer metastasis. The Notch
  receptors are activated by the Delta-like and Jagged families of ligands expressed
  on adjacent cells. Upon γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis, NICD proteins translocate
  to the nucleus and bind to the DNA binding protein CSL, taking the place of the
  corepressors (CoRs). NICD forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL and coactivators
  (CoAs), leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes. The activation
  of Notch signaling in tumor microenvironment could promote epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), the anoikis-resistance of tumor cells and maintain the homeostasis
  of angiogenesis, the morphology of vasculatures and the self-renewal of cancer stem
  cells (CSCs). Reprinted from Hu et al. [] with permission from Springer.
