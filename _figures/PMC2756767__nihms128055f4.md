caption: 'Choline is an essential nutrient and is transported into the cell by choline
  transporters. Choline transporter-like protein is the major choline transporter
  in human cancer cells. Phosphatidylcholine is the major membrane phospholipid. Choline
  kinase, which phosphorylates choline into phosphocholine, acts as a regulatory enzyme
  for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Overexpression and increased activity of choline
  transporters and choline kinase has been demonstrated in malignant cells, resulting
  in increased levels of phosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine.CDP: Cytidine 5-diphosphocholine;
  CDP-choline: Citicholine; CMP: Cytidine mono-phosphocholine; CTP: Cytidine choline
  transferase; PPi: Pyrophosphate.Adapted from [].'
