caption: Pathway of acetyl-CoA and glycerol generating enzymes up-regulated by acute
  leptin deficiency. (A) Acute leptin deficiency induced the pathway of genes (blue
  ovals) necessary to synthesize cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA and glycerol from simple sugar
  precursors. Fold change for each gene on day 1 following leptin withdrawal is shown
  below each enzyme name for leptin-FF (Left) and leptin-NC (Right) mice with the
  associated P value immediately below each fold-change value. Potential sources of
  carbon for acetate or glycerol synthesis are in blue text. BP, bisphosphate; CoA,
  CoA; DH, dehydrognease; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G, glucose; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; M, mannose; P, phosphate; PFK, phosphofructokinase; TPI, triose phosphate
  isomerase. (B) Average expression level for the genes in the cluster is shown in
  graphical format. Leptin-FF (green circles) and leptin-NC (red triangles) groups
  showed approximately equivalent induction relative to PBS controls (blue squares)
  following leptin withdrawal. Levels remained elevated for 4 days following cessation
  of exogenous leptin treatment.
