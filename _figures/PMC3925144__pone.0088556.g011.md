caption: Based on our data, autophagy is essential for PCa cells NED and serves a
  cytoprotective role in NE differentiated PCa cells. IL-6 induces autophagy-dependent
  NED through activation AMPK/mTOR pathway and down-modulation of REST. Activation
  of AMPK inhibits mTOR, a key inhibitor of autophagy, which in-turn activates autophagy
  pathway. Down-modulation of REST level relieves gene silencer REST-mediated transcriptional
  repression as part of a relay mechanism found in IL-6 induced autophagy.
