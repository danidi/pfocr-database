caption: Proposed model for the regulation of the UPR signaling pathways in the EBV
  lytic cycle. There are two possibilities to explain activation of the ATF6-mediated
  pathway, but not the PERK- and IRE1-mediated pathways in the viral lytic cycle.
  In regard to the first possibility (Model 1), the BMLF1 protein is the only viral
  factor responsible for the regulation of UPR signaling cascades (e.g., ATF6 activation
  and GRP78 upregulation). The sustained high-level GRP78 expression may subsequently
  help to maintain PERK and IRE1 in their inactive states. As for the second possibility
  (Model 2), besides BMLF1, some as-yet-unidentified viral proteins may be required
  to modulate UPR signaling pathways (e.g., inhibition of the PERK- or IRE1-mediated
  signaling) to favor the viral lytic cycle. Solid black lines with arrows, well-known
  pathways; green lines with arrows, the findings of this study; dashed lines, possible
  pathways proposed.
