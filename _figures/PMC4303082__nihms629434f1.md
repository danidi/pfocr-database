caption: (A) In normal cells, mTOR binds to IKK, leading to sequestration of IKK from
  binding to and activation by TAK1. As a result, NF-κB activation and binding to
  FANCD2 promoter is suppressed, which causes de-repression of FANCD2 gene expression.
  (B) In cancer cells, mTOR binding to IKK induces IKK binding to and activation by
  TAK1. IKK activation leads to NF-κB activation and binding to FANCD2 promoter, which
  in turn promotes FANCD2 gene expression.
