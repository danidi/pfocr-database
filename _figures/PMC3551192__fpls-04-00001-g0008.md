caption: 'Model illustrating potential early effects of cold stress on phospholipid
  metabolism and de novo synthesis in Arabidopsis. The main route to rapid cold-induced
  PtdOH formation is suggested to be based on the phosphorylation of PLC-generated
  DAG from PtdInsP (reactions 1/3). The activity of PECT, which produces the precursor
  of the polar head of PtdEtn, CDP-Etn, is proposed to be down regulated by low ambient
  temperature (2). This would lead to reduced PtdEtn formation, and potentially, to
  DAG accumulation, which might cause PtdOH to accumulate as a result from phosphorylation
  of DAG by a DGK (3), or due to product inhibition of PAP by DAG (4). The major pathway
  of PtdCho synthesis depends on methylation of EtnP to ChoP by PEAMT, which could
  be inhibited by PtdOH (5). Note that the model only highlights immediate effects
  of cold temperature; longer exposure to cold induces a myriad of metabolic changes
  which impact lipid biosynthesis in different ways. Abbreviations: Acyl-CoA, acyl-coenzyme
  A; CDS, CDP-DAG synthase; EK, ethanolamine kinase; EPT, CDP-ethanolamine phosphotransferase;
  GPAT, glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase;
  lyso-PtdOH, lysophosphatidic acid.'
