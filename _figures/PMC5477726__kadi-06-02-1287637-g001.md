caption: BMP4 signaling pathways. The BMP4 signal is transduced by 2 type of serine-threonine
  kinase receptors, BMPR1A or BMPR1B (type I) and BMPR2 (type II). Upon BMP4 binding,
  Type II receptor phosphorylates Type I receptor, which in turn leads to phosphorylation
  of members of the SMAD protein family such as SMAD1, 5, and 8. SMAD1/5/8 can form
  a complex with SMAD4 to translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
  This pathway is termed the canonical SMAD-dependent pathway, which is also regulated
  by inhibitory SMAD6 and 7 which can interfere with SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, SMAD1/5/8-SMAD4
  complex formation and shuttling into the nucleus. Furthermore, BMP4 can signal via
  non-canonical SMAD-independent pathways, which include MAPKs such as p38, ERK and
  JNK. Both, canonical and non-canonical pathways can be blocked by BMP4 inhibitors
  such as NOGGIN (NOG) and GREMLIN (GREM).
