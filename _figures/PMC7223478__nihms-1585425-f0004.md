caption: 'Several major mechanisms that have been implicated in vascular aging. The
  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) produces angiotensin II (Ang II) from
  angiotensinogen (AGT) via enzymatic actions of renin and angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE). In addition to activating the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), Ang II
  can stimulate production of aldosterone (Aldo), which acts via the mineralocorticoid
  receptor (MR). Both Aldo and Ang II promote oxidative stress by activating a Nox2
  containing NADPH oxidase which produces superoxide anion. Superoxide reacts readily
  with NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−), with inhibitory effects on mitochondrial
  SOD (SOD2) and prostaglandin I2 synthase (PGIS) due to effects on tyrosine residues.
  Superoxide can also be converted to H2O2 by SOD, and H2O2 can be converted to hydroxyl
  radical (OH·) in the presence of Fe2+. Via the AT1R, Ang II can activate NF-κB promoting
  inflammatory signaling, stimulate mitochondria to produce superoxide, or increase
  activity of Rho kinase (ROCK) via effects on RhoGEF. In addition to increasing vascular
  tone directly (not shown), ROCK inhibits production of NO by eNOS. ROCK is also
  activated by the endothelin-1 (ET1) pathway, where prepro-ET1 is produced from the
  ET1 gene (EDH1) and formed by endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) from big-ET1. ET1
  can then activate ET1 receptors (ETAR or ETBR, the latter of which can activate
  RhoGEF in vascular muscle). Activity of eNOS can be inhibited by ADMA (asymmetric
  dimethylarginine) or ADMA can be degraded by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase
  (DDAH). For clarity, the boxes on the right summarize related pleiotropic effects
  of three key molecules in this context: NO, PPARγ, and Ang II.'
