caption: 'Overexpression of E2F-2 abolishes the PPP-mediated inhibition of terminal
  differentiation in Gata1S310A erythroid cells ex vivo. (A) Quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR)
  studies: Primary erythroid cultures of cells derived from the bone marrow of Gata1
  and Gata1S310A mice were expanded; transduced with various shRNAs, as indicated
  (sh-X), on day 2; selected by puromycin treatment on day 5; and transferred to differentiation
  medium on day 6. Total mRNA was isolated after 3 d of differentiation, and qRT–PCR
  was performed. (B) Ter119 (X-axis) and CD71 (Y-axis) FACS analysis of the living
  cell population as described in A. Numbers show the percentage of cells within a
  particular region. (C) Schematic model of the coordination of cell proliferation
  and maturation during erythropoiesis: The sequestration of E2F-2 by GATA-1/pRb slows
  progression through the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, allowing the differentiation
  program to start (). Phosphorylation of GATA-1 by AKT increases its affinity for
  FOG-1, leading to the dissociation of GATA-1 from the pRb/E2F complex. Consequently,
  changes to the nuclear concentration of GATA-1/FOG-1 modulate erythroid gene transcription
  and result in the release of E2F-2 after pRb phosphorylation and the promotion of
  cell division. Our data suggest that the GATA-1S310A mutation impairs the capacity
  of FOG-1 to dissociate the GATA-1S310A/pRb/E2F-2 complex, thus promoting E2F-2 sequestration
  and inhibiting cell proliferation. The IGF-1R pathway counteracts E2F-2 sequestration
  by stimulating E2F-2 expression. Numbers 1–7 correspond to references as follows:
