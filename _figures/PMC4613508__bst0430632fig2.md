caption: (A) Model for Trx1-dependence of Nrf2 activity. At left, under unstressed
  conditions both the GSH and the Trx1 systems are constitutively active in cells
  and reduce oxidants; however the Trx1 system, in addition to providing reducing
  power to combat oxidative stress, maintains the active state of Keap1 and thereby
  the inactive state of Nrf2. At right, following an oxidative siege on the cells,
  highly nucleophilic Sec and Cys residues in the active sites of Trx1 system enzymes
  sensitively respond to the electrophilic challenge and catalyse oxidative inactivation
  of Keap1. This activates Nrf2, inducing a cytoprotective response. Whereas Nrf2
  will further activate the Trx1 system, the flow of reducing power might preferentially
  go to the reactive electrophiles constituting the challenge and only reduce the
  relatively less reactive oxidized Cys residues on Keap1 after the challenge subsides.
  (B) Nrf2 induces disulfide reductase systems in liver. Oxidative stress is proposed
  to induce Nrf2 via a mechanism that involves the Trx1 system and Keap1 (red). In
  addition to inducing drug metabolism pathways and realigning energy metabolism pathways,
  Nrf2 induces production of NADPH (e.g., by inducing the pentose phosphate pathway
  and malic enzyme), the Trx1 system (e.g., by inducing the genes encoding Trx1 and
  TrxR1) and the GSH system (e.g., by inducing the genes encoding GR and the GSH biosynthesis
  pathway). It remains unclear whether Nrf2 participates in regulating the methionine-dependent
  disulfide reductase system (e.g., by regulating genes involved in amino acid transport
  and metabolism, dashed line). See text for details.
