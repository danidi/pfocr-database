caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed model involved in the cAMP regulation
  of BDNF-induced collapse. Activation of TrkB receptors by BDNF induces multiple
  intracellular signaling cascades including a Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels,
  and the Ca2+pathway mediates the collapsing effect (double lineswith arrows). Although
  the unknown protein X is involved in the main Ca2+-signaling pathway for collapse,
  its activity can be modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by cAMP-dependent
  activity (single lines witharrows). PKA phosphorylates and inactivates (−) X, whereas
  phosphotase(s) dephosphorylate(s) and activate(s) (+) X. An equilibrium between
  the active and inactive X is likely reached in the cell. Experimental manipulation
  of PKA activity by (Rp)-cAMP or (Sp)-cAMP (dashed lines with arrows) can change
  the equilibrium and thus regulate the collapsing effect of BDNF. Activation of PKA
  by (Sp)-cAMP causes more X to become inactive, leading to the blockade of the collapsing
  effect; inhibition of the resting level of PKA activity by (Rp)-cAMP results in
  more active X, leading to the potentiation of the collapsing effect induced by the
  low concentrations of BDNF. Alternatively, the cAMP-mediated regulation can be upstream
  of Ca2+. In this case, the protein X mediates BDNF-induced Ca2+ influx required
  for growth cone collapse (dotted double lines witharrows), and its activity can
  be regulated by cAMP-dependent activity in a similar way.
