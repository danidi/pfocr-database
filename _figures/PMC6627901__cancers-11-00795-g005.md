caption: Model for the oncogenic activation of the EGFR signaling pathway and response
  to therapeutic EGFR-blockade in basal HNSCC. Our results suggest that basal HNSCC
  cell proliferation and survival are activated by an oncogenic positive feedback
  loop that is fueled by the expression of EGFR ligands, including epiregulin, and
  the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway. Pharmacologic blockade of EGFR with
  monoclonal antibodies or TKIs results in down-regulation of ligand gene expression
  and diminution of the activity of the EGFR signaling pathway, leading to a decrease
  in cell viability.
