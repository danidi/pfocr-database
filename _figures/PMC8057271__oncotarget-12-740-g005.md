caption: (A) Correlation-based network analysis showed statistically significant,
  positive correlations between RABL6A and p53, MDM2, and YAP. In addition, a statistically
  significant positive correlation was identified between TAZ and MDM2. (B) Model
  diagram depicting the relationship between the five biomarkers integrating the network
  analysis and previously identified functions of the proteins, with RABL6A serving
  as a potential link between YAP and TAZ and integrator of the p53-MDM2 axis.
