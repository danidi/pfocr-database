caption: Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) expression and function
  by multiple inputs. Across diverse cell types, HIF-1 is regulated at the protein
  level by oxygen-dependent mechanisms (panel 1). HIF subunits are readily transcribed.
  However, in the presence of oxygen, proline residues of the HIF-1α subunit are hydroxylated
  by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes (which are inactive under hypoxic conditions).
  Modified HIF-1 molecules then interact with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)/E3 ligase
  complex, become polyubiquitinated, and are then degraded by the 26S proteasome.
  Additionally, hydroxylation of residue N803 can disrupt interaction with transcription
  cofactors. In immune cells, and particularly T cells, HIF-1 expression can be transcriptionally
  upregulated even in the presence of oxygen in response to stimuli triggering Toll-like
  receptor (TLR), T cell receptor (TCR), costimulation signaling pathways leading
  to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation (panel 2).
