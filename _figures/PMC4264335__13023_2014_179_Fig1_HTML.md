caption: Metabolic pathway involved in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX; modified
  from Chales and Bjorkhem [  ,  ] ). Due to a mutation in the CYP27A1 gene, cholesterol
  cannot be converted into bile acids, but is instead converted into cholestanol and
  bile alcohol. Providing chenodeoxycholic acid exogenously has a negative feedback
  effect that reduces synthesis of bile acid, thus preventing accumulation of cholestanol.
