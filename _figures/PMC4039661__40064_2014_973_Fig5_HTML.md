caption: Saturated FFA mediated impairment in skeletal muscle and its reversal by
  nSMase inhibition. Sphingomyelin can be converted into ceramide by nSMases. Palmitate
  mediated up-regulation of nSMases can expedite this process of ceramide generation.
  Increased ceramide can lead to an inhibition on insulin signaling pathway thereby
  reducing glucose oxidation. In this condition PGC1α levels are reduced with a concomitant
  decrease in muscle oxidative capacity. Because of impaired oxidative function and
  palmitate overload, fat storage in form of TG is increased. Palmitate overload mediated
  increased ceramide levels elevate cellular oxidative stress, ER stress and inflammation
  which can severely affect cell survival. Elevated stress and inflammation can directly
  inhibit insulin signaling and can impair oxidative capacity (represented as dashed
  arrows). Palmitate mediated impact on cellular responses is represented by a thick
  up or down arrow placed just after particular cellular response. Inhibition of nSMase
  under this background reverses palmitate mediated impact on cellular response.
