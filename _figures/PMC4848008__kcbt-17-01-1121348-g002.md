caption: The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and FAK cooperation with NANOG and p53
  in the CSC phenotype. In the absence of Hh, the PTCH1 and PTCH2 receptors inhibit
  the activity of the SMO transmembrane protein. When Hh binds to PTCH1/2, the inhibition
  of SMO is released. Activated GLI1 is transported to the nucleus, where it binds
  to the NANOG promoter. NANOG is also regulated positively by FAK (which forms a
  negative feedback loop) and negatively by p53 (which forms a positive feedback loop).
