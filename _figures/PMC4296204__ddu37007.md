caption: The schematic presentation shows Shh-Ptc1-Gli1 signaling pathway in normal
  (Left) condition and disease (right) conditions. In general, Shh binds Ptc, which
  activates and promotes the effecter Gli1. Gli1 enters the nucleus and binds to Ptc
  promoter and proliferative genes. Excessive Aβ in AD brains promotes and activates
  GSK-3β, which inhibits Gli1 and, in turn, decreased the transcription of Ptc and
  proliferative genes.
