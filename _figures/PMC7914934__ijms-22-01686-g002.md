caption: 'Molecular interaction Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®) network associated
  with connective tissue development and function, organ morphology, reproductive
  system development, and function assembled from the E2-regulated uterine proteins
  TGM2, elongation factor 2 (EEF2), selenium binding protein 1 (SELBP1), and lumican
  (LUM) in the rat. The shapes (see legend in the blue box) represent molecular classes
  of the regulated proteins. In the network, red and green colors denote upregulation
  and downregulation in response to E2 treatment, respectively. The intensity of the
  color indicates the relative magnitude of fold change in protein expression pattern
  based on spectral counts. Solid and dashed lines represent direct and indirect interactions,
  respectively. Abbreviations: ABLIM1, actin binding LIM protein 1; ABCC9, adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette subfamily C member 9; ACTC1, actin alpha cardiac
  muscle 1; BLK, proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase; CDCA7, cell division
  cycle associated 7; CDK18, cyclin dependent kinase 18; CNBP, CCHC-type zinc finger
  nucleic acid binding protein; COPE, COPI coat complex epsilon; ESR1, estrogen receptor
  1; F7, coagulation factor 7; FARSB, phenylalanyl–tRNA synthetase subunit beta; GDP,
  guanosine diphosphate; GM2A, ganglioside activator; GRM5, glutamate metabotropic
  receptor 5; HSPB2, heat shock protein family B (small) member 2; KCNQ5, potassium
  voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 5; MCM4, minichromosome maintenance complex
  component 4; mir, microRNA; MYO9A, myosin IXa; NDRG1, N-myc downstream regulated
