caption: Induction of oxidative pathway response during alcohol metabolism. Upon exposure
  to alcohol, the cellular alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (ADH) is activated in the
  cytosol, which metabolizes to produce acetaldehyde. During long term exposure or
  chronic alcohol consumption, an enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytochrome
  P450 IIE1 (CYP2E1), becomes activated and alcohol gets metabolized to acetaldehyde.
  The derived acetaldehyde enters into the mitochondria and is further metabolized
  into acetate mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). Thereby, it results in
  the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to neurotoxicity and
  damage.
