caption: 'Model of the synaptic vesicle (SV) cycle and select proteins involved in
  distinct steps of SV recycling. (A) SVs are formed by budding from synaptic endosomes,
  entering a reserve pool (RP) after filling with neurotransmitter (gray lumen). At
  the dense projection (DP), SVs approach the plasma membrane (PM; black line) and
  become docked and primed, forming the readily releasable pool (RRP). After fusion,
  ultrafast endocytosis retrieves the SV membrane and proteins, forming clear-core
  large vesicles (LVs), following membrane severing by dynamin (red arcs). The LVs
  fuse with or transform into synaptic endosomes. Several proteins studied either
  previously (black dots: UNC-57/endophilin A, green open circles: UNC-26/synaptojanin,
  red arcs: DYN-1/dynamin; Kittelmann et al., ), or as part of this work (black mesh:
  CHC-1/clathrin heavy chain, gray dots: ERP-1/endophilin B), affect different steps
  of the recycling pathway, acting either at the PM or at the synaptic endosome. Roles/sites
  of action of clathrin and endophilin-related protein (ERP-1; blue text) are not
  firmly established as yet in C. elegans. (B) Summary of mutant phenotypes as observed
  at the ultrastructural level, following photostimulation of cholinergic neurons
  (Kittelmann et al., ): in wild type, LVs form transiently. In the unc-26 mutant,
  less LVs form, but they do form and are persistent, as they cannot be efficiently
  broken down. In the dyn-1 mutant, LVs are formed but cannot be pinched off the PM,
  and smaller vesicles emerge from these structures (possibly new SVs) that can also
  not be pinched off. LVs that were formed nonetheless are accumulating and cannot
  be processed to SVs efficiently.'
