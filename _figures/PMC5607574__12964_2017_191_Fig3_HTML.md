caption: Multiple kinases-phosphatases mediated progressive Smo phosphorylations interpret
  morphogenic Hh signals in signal-receiving cells. In response to Hh concentration
  gradient, Drosophila Smo exhibits graded phosphorylation status, which correspondingly
  activates the expressions of a series of target genes, such as dpp and ptc, responding
  to low-to-intermediate threshold, or high threshold Hh signals, respectively. The
  transcription effector Ci is switched from a repressor form CiR to an activator
  form CiA, triggering the expression of Hh target genes. During these progressive
  Smo phosphorylations, PKA and CK1 sequentially phosphorylate Smo, which promotes
  Smo accumulation on plasma membrane and facilitates Smo further phosphorylations
  by Gprk2 and Gish, two kinases preferring the distribution near plasma membrane,
  to achieve maximal activation of Smo. It has been known that PP1 and PP2A respectively
  counteract with PKA and CK1 to modulate Smo phosphorylation status. However, the
  phosphatase against Gprk2 or Gish has not been identified yet

  description: Multiple kinases-phosphatases mediated progressive Smo phosphorylations
    interpret morphogenic Hh signals in signal-receiving cells. In response to Hh
    concentration gradient, Drosophila Smo exhibits graded phosphorylation status,
    which correspondingly activates the expressions of a series of target genes, such
    as dpp and ptc, responding to low-to-intermediate threshold, or high threshold
    Hh signals, respectively. The transcription effector Ci is switched from a repressor
    form CiR to an activator form CiA, triggering the expression of Hh target genes.
    During these progressive Smo phosphorylations, PKA and CK1 sequentially phosphorylate
    Smo, which promotes Smo accumulation on plasma membrane and facilitates Smo further
    phosphorylations by Gprk2 and Gish, two kinases preferring the distribution near
    plasma membrane, to achieve maximal activation of Smo. It has been known that
    PP1 and PP2A respectively counteract with PKA and CK1 to modulate Smo phosphorylation
    status. However, the phosphatase against Gprk2 or Gish has not been identified
