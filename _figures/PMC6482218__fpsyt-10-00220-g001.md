  levels with NR3C1 during age-related stress (), FKBP5 during the development of

  has been associated with parental-nutrition-induced stress (, ). NR3C2 and NR3C1
  interact to control gene expression during stress (, ). Nuclear NR3C1 (glucocorticoid
  receptor) seems to be a convergence point for FKBP5 (, ), NR3C2 (, ), MEST (, ),
  and IGF2 () action in stress. TSC22D3 is an established glucocorticoid signaling
  responsive gene that is regulated by NR3C1 (, ) and an NR3C2 target (). BDNF is
  upregulated by IGF2 () in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model, inhibited by NR3C1

  rats (). FKBP5 elevation is associated with BDNF suppression and improved anxiety,
