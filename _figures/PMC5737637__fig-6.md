caption: Metabolic sources of NADP(H) and the cytosolic/mitochondrial NADPH shuttle.
  In the cytosol, NADPH is primarily produced by G6PD and 6PGD in the pentose phosphate
  pathway. ME1 also contributes to cytosolic NADPH production. Mitochondrial NADPH
  is generated by NADP+-dependent IDH2, GLUD, NNT, and ME3. The cytosolic and mitochondrial
  NADPH is exchanged through the isocitrate-α-KG shuttle, where cytosolic IDH1 and
  mitochondrial IDH2 catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and α-KG in conjunction
  with the interconversion of NADP+ and NADPH. The citrate carrier protein (encoded
  by SLC25A1 gene) and the α-KG/malate antiporter (encoded by SLC25A11 gene) mediate
  the transport of isocitrate and α-KG between cytosol and mitochondria, respectively.
  6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; NNT, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase;
