caption: The Notch signalling pathway. Notch binds to one of its ligands and then
  results in two sequential proteolytic cleavages of the receptor. The latter involves
  the release of the intracellular part of Notch receptor, which is NICD. It transfers
  into the nucleus and then associates with RBP-J and the Mam to activate specific
  transcription. Notch pathway participates in the transcriptional regulation of multiple
  genes
