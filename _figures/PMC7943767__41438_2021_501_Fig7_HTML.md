caption: In (A), the enzyme subfamilies (larger font) and the H. undatus orthologous
  genes (smaller font) are shown. The up arrows show increased gene expressions from
  white pulp to red pulp development stages; the down arrows mean decreased expressions.
  The red arrows indicate significant expression changes (adjusted P value <0.05 and
  expression log2 (fold change) >1 or <−1), while black arrows do not. The colored
  genes are genes that are co-localized in Chr3 of H. undatus. In (B), the colors
  of genes and curved lines (depicting orthologous gene relationships) match the colors
  of genes in (A). The TPM (transcripts per kilobase million reads) values are also
  indicated for these co-localized genes on Chr3. The detailed expression values can
  be found in Supplementary Table
