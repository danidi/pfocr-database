caption: (A) Acute Myelogenous Leukemia cells (AML) in the bone marrow microenvironment
  demonstrate marked ER-stress and high expression of bone morphogenic proteins. Under
  conditions of ER-stress, AML cells shed copious extracellular vesicles (EVs) that
  transmit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) to
  recipient bone marrow cells. This activates the Unfolded Protein Response Pathway
  (UPR) and leads to adaptive changes among stromal components in the leukemic microenvironment
  to enforce a chemo-protective niche (B) BMP (orange) expression is upregulated in
  AML cells (Molm-14mGFP, modified to express a myristoylated GFP tag), explanted
  from xenograft animals, and is compartmentalized into intracytoplasmic membranes
  (mGFP) along with CD63 (magenta) which are indicative of pre-exosomal multivesicular
  bodies. Central slice from 3D-Airyscan Z-stack, scale bar = 5 μm. (C) EVs isolated
  from ER-stressed Molm-14 cells co-stain with anti-BMP2 and EV-marker CD63. Airyscan
  super resolution technique, scale bar = 500 nm.
