caption: Model of platelet polyphosphates in the pathogenesis of HIT. (1) PF4 released
  from activated platelets binds to cell surface (1a) and forms complexes with heparin
  on the cell surface (1a) or in solution (1b). Cell surface complexes do not form
  when platelets are preincubated with chondroitinase ABC (1c). Binding of KKO to
  PF4/heparin or PF4/CS activates platelets through FcRγIIA (2). Polyphosphates (pentagon
  shapes) and PF4, which are found primarily in separate granules within resting platelets,
  are released (3) and can form antigenic complexes within the cell (4) and on the
  cell surface (5). PF4/polyP complexes are stabilized by KKO (6), which enhances
  and perpetuates platelet activation. This pathway is inoperative when platelets
  are preincubated with CIP (7). Dissociation of the C5bC6 pathway by polyP is blocked
  by PF4 (8), permitting HIT antibodies to generate C5b-9 membrane attack complexes
  (MAC) (9) that may further promote platelet activation. Alternatively, complexes
  of polyP, PF4, and HIT antibody might form in solution and bind directly to platelet
  FcRγIIA (not pictured). When platelets are exposed to exogenous PF4/heparin, as
  occurs early in patients with HIT, the polyP-mediated pathway augments the platelet
  response. When platelets are primed by thrombin, and presumably by other agonists,
  PF4 comes from within the cell. As plasma levels of heparin fall and thrombin is
  generated, the polyP pathway may make increasing contributions to exacerbating or
  sustaining HIT.
