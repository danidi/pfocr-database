caption: Hypothesized hyperinsulinemia-induced cancerogenetic mechanisms. Insulin
  and insulin-like growth factor 1 are closely related hormones that control different
  aspects of growth and metabolism in many organisms. At physiological levels, insulin
  and IGF-1 fully activate their cognate receptors and IGF-1 can also activate IR/IGF1R
  hybrid receptors. At supraphysiological levels they can also bind and activate each
  other’s’ receptor in cell culture models, although with reduced affinity. Activated
  IR/IGF1R receptors phosphorylate target proteins such as Insulin Receptor Substrate
  (IRSs) proteins on selective tyrosine residues (Tyr) that serve as docking sites
  for downstream effector molecules. Phosphorylated IRS1 activates the metabolic PI3K/Akt
  pathway. Activated Akt regulates glucose metabolism and induces the mitogenic (ERK/MAPK)
  pathway involved in carcinogenic mechanism. Serine (Ser)/Threonine phosphorylation
  of the IRS proteins is a key negative-feedback control mechanism that uncouples
  the IRS proteins from their upstream and downstream effectors and terminates signal
  transduction in response to insulin, under physiological conditions. Analogous mechanisms
  are involved in the molecular pathophysiology of insulin resistance by activating
  serine/threonine IRS kinases (such as the p70S6K) that phosphorylate the IRS proteins
  and inhibit their function. Hyperinsulinemia is responsible of receptors hyperactivation
  inducing IR, IGF1R, and ERK over-expression. HER2 signal activation is known to
  have a pivotal role in esophageal cancerogenesis and disease progression. Hyperinsulinemia
  is able to induce also HER2 overexpression. HER2 is the preferential dimerization
  partner of other members of the ErbB family and other growth factor receptors. A
  cross-talk between HER2 and IGF1R signaling pathway has been proven in breast cancer
  through an heterodimerization mechanism. An analogous mechanism is proposed also
  in this context, in which hyperinsulinemia-induced IGF1R overexpression might enhance
  the possibility to form HER2/IGF1R heterodimers, promoting mitogenic pathway activation
  and, in turn, cancer.
