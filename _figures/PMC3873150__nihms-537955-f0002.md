caption: '(A) PLC/IP3-mediated Ca2+ release signaling pathway in astrocytes. Following
  upstimulation of GPCRs, IP3 is liberated following the activation of PLC astrocytes.
  Astrocytes then release Ca2+ from internal stores through the opening of IP3R ion
  channels. (B) The astrocytic process together with pre- and post-synaptic regions
  of neurons constitutes a synapse – that is, a tripartite synapse. The local microdomains
  of astrocytic processes can be excited by neuronal activity through glutamate or
  other neurotransmitters released from the synaptic cleft by activating GPCRs. Ca2+
  release from internal stores can mediate glutamate or other chemical transmitter
  release, a process called ‘gliotransmission’, which signals back to the neuron by
  activating neuronal receptors through the tripartite synapse.DAG: Diacyl glycerol;
