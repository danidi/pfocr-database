caption: ACBD3-mediated signaling pathway and cellular regulation. Following release
  after Golgi fragmentation, ACBD3 interacts with several other signaling molecules.
  ACBD3 then regulates diverse cellular processes, including steroidogenesis, iron
  homeostasis, apoptosis, and neurogenesis. ACBD3 serves as an intermediate, and may
  be involved in the signaling protein complex related to steroidogenesis and NMDA
  receptor-mediated iron homeostasis. ACBD3 holds a Golgi 160 fragment and numb protein
  within the cytoplasm. ACBD3 then regulates cell apoptosis and neurogenesis. Mt,
  mitochondria; TSPO, translocator protein, 18 kDa; PRKAT1A, protein kinase, cAMP-dependent,
  regulatory, type I, alpha (tissue specific extinguisher 1); cAMP, cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; DMT1, divalent metal transporter 1; Dexras1, a 30 kDa brain-enriched
  member of the Ras family of small monomeric G proteins; SNO, S-nitrosothiol; Golgin-160
  fragment, caspase cleavaged fragment of the golgin family of Golgi-localized proteins;
  Numb, numb homolog (Drosophila).
