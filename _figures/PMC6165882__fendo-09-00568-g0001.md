caption: Stress-related reduction in vaginal Lactobacillus dominance (dysbiosis) and
  dysregulated immune response. Exposure to psychosocial stress induces the release
  of cortisol and norepinephrine via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and SAM axes
  respectively. Cortisol inhibits the estrogen-related vaginal epithelial maturation
  and glycogen accumulation. Levels of vaginal free glycogen and Lactobacilli are
  reduced leading to decreased lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis
  and pH. Consequently, a dysbiotic environment conducive for the proliferation of
  bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobic bacteria such as Gardnerella, Prevotella,
  Mobiluncus, Atopobium, Megasphera, and sexually transmitted infections such Neisseria
  gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis, human immunodeficiency virus is created. Cortisol
  also affects immune response by altering the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signal transduction
  pathway, which regulates inflammatory gene expression. These effects are exacerbated
  by the concurrent release of norepinephrine, which binds to vaginal epithelial cells
  and potentiates the pro-inflammatory response via a reduction in the release of
  antimicrobial proteins including mucins, immunoglobulins (secretory Ig A and IgG),
  β-defensins, secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated
  lipocalin (NGAL). The overall effect is a dysbiotic vaginal ecosystem with a sub-optimal
  immune response, which encourages upper genital tract infection with deleterious
  gynecological and obstetric sequelae.
