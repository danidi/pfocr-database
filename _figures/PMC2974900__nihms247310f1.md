caption: SUMO modification cycle. Before attachment to proteins, SUMO proteins [pink]
  must be cleaved into their mature forms by SENPs (Sentrin-specific Proteases; [purple]),
  which remove 4, 11, and 2 amino acids from the C-terminal ends of SUMO-1, SUMO-2,
  and SUMO-3, respectively. The processed SUMO proteins are then activated by conjugation
  to the E1 heterodimer SAE1–SAE2 [light blue], after which the SUMO is transferred
  to the E2 enzyme Ubc9 [gold]. Finally, SUMO is ligated to substrate proteins by
  an isopeptide bond between the terminal glycine on SUMO and the ε-amino group of
  a lysine in the substrate [green]. The efficiency of the ligation reaction is aided
  by SUMO ligase E3 proteins (E3; [orange]) which directly interact with both target
  proteins and the E2 enzyme, thereby acting as bridging factors to increase the efficiency
  of this reaction. SUMO polypeptides are removed from target proteins by the action
  of SENPs, which recovers the SUMO proteins for attachment to other proteins in another
  cycle of the sumoylation pathway.
