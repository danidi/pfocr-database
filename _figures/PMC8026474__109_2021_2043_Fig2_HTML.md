caption: Simplified overview of PRR signalling pathways in gastrointestinal epithelial
  cells. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including TLRs, NLRs or newly discovered
  sensors such as ALPK1 recognize the microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs).
  Upon PRR activation in epithelial cells, downstream signalling cascades induce expression
  of different cytokines and chemokines via inflammatory pathways, such as the NF-κB
  pathway. TLR1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 recognize lipoproteins, double-stranded (ds-) RNA,
  lipopolysaccharides (LPS), flagellin and dsDNA, respectively. ALPK1 recognizes the
  LPS metabolite ADP-heptose and its stimulation leads to phosphorylation of TIFA
  proteins, mediating the formation of TIFAsomes as a response to gram-negative bacteria.
  Ligands bind to a receptor which leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins (e.g.
  Myd88, TRAF6 and RIP2). These adaptors drive the phosphorylation of the IκB which
  leads to its ubiquitination and degradation. NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 can then
  enter the nucleus to facilitate the expression of target genes which are proinflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-8 in humans and its analogue Cxcl2 in mice. Inflammasomes,
  which are cytoplasmic complexes composed of NLR proteins, recognize additional molecular
  patterns, microbial metabolites or nucleic acids. They activate caspase-1, which
  cleaves and thereby activates proinflammatory cytokines like pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18,
  driving the downstream inflammatory pathways. In turn, proinflammatory cytokines
  will recruit professional immune cells of the innate and adaptive immune system,
  which are equipped to resolve the infection (reviewed in [–]).
