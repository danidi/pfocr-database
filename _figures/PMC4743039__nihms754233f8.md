caption: Levels of PDZ-RhoGEF, an activator of the RhoA small GTPase, decrease in
  the cytoplasm and increase in the nucleus of NAc MSNs 24 hr after the last chronic
  cocaine dose. This is associated with increased levels of active RhoA in the nucleus,
  which promotes the formation of F-actin. These actions, in turn, activate the serum
  response factor (SRF) transcription factor by controlling the localization of the
  SRF co-activator MAL. MAL is unable to interact with SRF when bound to G-actin,
  but 24-hr post-cocaine MAL shifts away from G-actin and toward F-actin due to higher
  RhoA activity, with a resulting increase in MAL-SRF-dependent transcription. This
  PDZ-RhoGEF-RhoA-actin-MAL-SRF signaling cascade drives Rap1b expression in synaptoneurosomes,
  where it activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Activation of this pathway drives
  the formation of thin, immature spines 24-hr post-cocaine. Conversely, the activity
  of this signaling pathway is reversed 3–4 weeks after cocaine administration and
  results in the formation of mature, mushroom spines.
