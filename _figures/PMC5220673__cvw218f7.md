caption: TSP1–CD47 signaling limits pulmonary cMyc to upregulate ET-1/ETA and promote
  PH. Hypoxia-mediated induction of TSP1 in the pulmonary vasculature activates endothelial
  CD47 to suppress cMyc allowing upregulation of ET-1/ETA. ET-1 then targets the pulmonary
  arterial vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) compartment to promote vascular remodeling
  and cell hypertrophy, decreased vasodilation and increased vasoconstriction. Conversely,
  treatment with a CD47 antibody, that blocks TSP1 activation of CD47, limits ET-1-mediated
  VSMC hypertrophy and improves PA sensitivity to NO pathway activators.
