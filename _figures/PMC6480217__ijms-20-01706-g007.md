number: Figure 7
caption: Hypothetical scheme of CA action in mammalian cells. CA activates the Nrf2
  pathway only at a low dose (≤20 μM) but activates both Nrf2 and ATF4 pathways at
  a high-dose (≥50 μM). Induced Nrf2 and ATF4 independently and cooperatively up-regulate
  CA-inducible gene expression (arrows pointing up) to exhibit physiological effects,
  such as stress response (bold white arrow). The arrows indicate activation and T-arrows
  show inhibition.
