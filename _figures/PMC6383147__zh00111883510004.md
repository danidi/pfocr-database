caption: Positive feedback linking oxidative stress with enhanced p62 expression,
  Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1) autophagic degradation, and stimulation
  of antioxidant enzyme expression. Prior to oxidant exposure, KEAP1 and nuclear factor
  erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) associate to form a complex that ultimately leads
  to proteasome-mediated degradation following Nrf2 ubiquitination. However, under
  conditions of oxidative stress, reactive cysteines, functioning as redox sensors
  within KEAP1, become oxidized, destabilizing the binding of KEAP1 with Nrf2. Additionally,
  phosphorylation of the autophagy receptor p62 at serine residues S407 and S403 by
  specific kinases within the autophagy pathway causes an increase in affinity of
  p62 to ubiquitin associated with various polyubiquitinated (Ub) substrates, including
  macromolecules that have become damaged as a result of oxidation. Subsequent phosphorylation
  of ubiquitin-bound p62 by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1)
  at S349 increases its affinity for KEAP1, facilitating release of Nrf2 from the
  KEAP1-Nrf2 complex and increased transcription of multiple Nrf2-regulated target
  genes within the nucleus. KEAP1, along with polyubiquitinated macromolecules, then
  undergoes autophagic degradation (). OX, oxidation; P, phosphorylation; sMaf, small
  musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma; ARE, antioxidant response element; ULK1, uncoordinated
  51-like kinase-1; CK2, creatine kinase 2; TBK1, serine/threonine-protein kinase
