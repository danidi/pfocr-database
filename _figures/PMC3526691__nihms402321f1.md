caption: The role of 12- and 15-LO in adipose tissue in the obese state. Excess consumption
  of energy demands an increased nutrient storage capacity of adipocytes in white
  adipose tissue (WAT). As a result, adipocytes become hypertrophic and stressed,
  leading to dysfunction marked by ensuing inflammation. Expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, lipocalin-2 (LCN2), renin angiotensin system (RAS) markers, and ER stress
  markers by these stressed adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of the
  WAT leads to chronic leukocyte-type 12-LO (12/15-LO) activation in the adipocyte
  and SVF and subsequent generation of pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites, such as
  12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE. 12/15-LO activity promotes further amplification of pro-inflammatory
  pathways, in particular the interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway. This inflamed fat promotes
  the recruitment of macrophages and other inflammatory cells into the fat bed, further
  propagating the inflammatory autocrine cascade. In addition, WAT exerts paracrine
  and endocrine pro-inflammatory effects through secreted cytokines on various organ
  systems, including the pancreas, liver, and vasculature, leading to metabolic decline.
