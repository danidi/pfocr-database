caption: DSBs are repaired by one of three pathways, c-NHEJ (left panel) HR (middle
  panel) or a-NHEJ (right panel). c-NHEJ occurs with rapid kinetics throughout the
  cell cycle, and is initiated when DSBs are recognized and bound by the Ku 70/86
  heterodimer. The MRN complex may co-localize to the same break (potentially through
  interaction with Ku70). Ku recruits DNA-PKcs forming the DNA-PK holoenzyme. Artemis,
  which is less abundant than DNA-PKcs, is complexed with DNA-PKcs. Upon recruitment
  to a DSB by Ku, the nuclease activity of Artemis is activated by trans autophosphorylation
  at the ABCDE cluster within DNA-PKcs. ABCDE phosphorylations promote end processing
  whereas PQR phosphorylations (also in trans) limit end processing. This provides
  tight regulation of end access to various processing factors, including Artemis,
  PNKP, and X family polymerases. If c-NHEJ fails, the HR and a-NHEJ pathways can
  gain access to the break; this would be facilitated by the presence of the MRN complex.
  In this case, DNA-PK might be inactivated by phosphorylation at the J, K or T sites
  as well as other, not yet identified, sites. J, K and T phosphorylations have been
  shown to inhibit c-NHEJ and promote HR. It is not known whether J, K or T phosphorylations
  occur in cis or trans, but clearly DNA-PKcs autophosphorylates some sites in cis
  (K.M. unpublished data). Ligation is carried out by the XLF/XRCC4/LigIV complex.
  Filament formation by XRCC4 and XLF may also contribute to synapsis. Further autophosphorylation
  of DNA-PKcs induces kinase inactivation (N, J, K, and T sites) and finally dissociation
  (sites responsible for dissociation are not known, although phosphorylation of ABCDE
  may contribute to complex dissociation). Although assembly and action or the c-NHEJ
  pathway is presented sequentially, it is also possible that c-NHEJ factors are simultaneously
  recruited to the site of a DSB through interaction with Ku and/or DNA-PKcs. Such
  a supercomplex would likely require the presence of Ku to be maintained, and as
  a result may cause Ku to be “stuck” on the DNA following repair. Proteolysis could
  provide a mechanism for subsequent removal of Ku. If c-NHEJ fails or if the DSB
  is first recognized by PARP, MRN is recruited to the DSB. During the S and G2 phases
  of the cell cycle, MRN along with CtIP and BRCA1 perform initial, short range DNA
  end resection which promotes HR (adapted from []). HR proceeds with slower kinetics
  than c-NHEJ. More extensive end resection is carried out by EXO1 in collaboration
  with the BLM helicase. The exposed 3’ overhangs are then rapidly coated with RPA,
  which is ultimately replaced by Rad51 through the assistance of “mediator” proteins
  such as BRCA2 and/or the Rad51 paralogs. The Rad51 filament invades a homologous
  segment of DNA while simultaneously displacing the complementary strand forming
  a D-loop. Following D-loop formation several sub-pathways of HR can occur including
  formation of Holiday junctions or SDSA. Limited DNA end resection by MRN and CtIP
  can result in a-NHEJ (adapted from []), which can occur throughout the cell cycle
  and may involve ligation by the XRCC1/DNA ligase III complex; a-NHEJ also proceeds
  with slower kinetics than c-NHEJ.
