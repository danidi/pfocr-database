caption: 'Metabolic rewiring induced by hypoxia. (A) In normoxic tumor areas, glucose
  taken up by glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and transformed by glycolysis into pyruvate
  is mainly oxidized into Acetyl-Coenzyme A (AcCoA) by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH),
  fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain to produce
  ATP. By contrast, lactic fermentation is low. Fatty acid (FAs) oxidation (FAO) prevails
  over FA and triglyceride (TG) synthesis, further producing AcCoA entering the TCA
  cycle. The oxidative metabolism of glutamine (Gln) is a third anaplerotic pathway
  of TCA cycle. (B) Hypoxia enhances glucose uptake via GLUT1 and metabolism into
  lactate, thanks to the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α-dependent upregulation
  of glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  1 that inhibits PDH. In this way, cancer cells produce huge amounts of lactate,
  exported by the hypoxia-sensitive gene mono-carboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and
  H+, buffered by other HIF-1α-targeted genes, such as carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX
  and XII. Part of lactate can enter the mitochondria via MCT, and is transformed
  into pyruvate by mitochondrial LDH, fueling TCA cycle. Notwithstanding such anaplerosis,
  TCA and electron transport chain (ETC) are reduced in hypoxic tumors that aberrantly
  reduce O2 into reactive oxygen species (ROS). Amino acids (AAs) uptake is increased
  thanks to the upregulation of xCT and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), also
  induced by HIF-1α. The catabolism of Gln and glutamate (Glu), however, not only
  fuels TCA cycle, since it is mainly used to synthesize glutathione (GSH) or produce
  α-ketoglutarate (αKG) that is reduced into citrate and NADPH via the reductive glutamine
  metabolism, providing carbons for FA and triglycerides (TGs) synthesis. Dotted arrows:
  down-modulated metabolic pathways; solid arrows: up-regulated metabolic pathways.'
