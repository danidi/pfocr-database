caption: Pathway for the biosynthesis of mycobacterial arabinogalactan. The sequence
  of reactions is based on identification of GL-1 through GL-5 and the lipid-linked
  arabinogalactan polymer in cell-free systems containing mycobacterial membranes
  and cell wall fractions (-, ). GlcNAc-1-P transferase WecA (Rv1302) is proposed
  to be responsible for step 1 (); the rhamnosyl transferase WbbL (Rv3265) catalyzes
  step 2 (). Subsequent reaction 3 and/or 4 is proposed in this study and previously
  () to be catalyzed by Rv3782. Step 6 represents a series of galactofuranosyl additions
  catalyzed by Rv3808c. Several arabinosyl transferases involved in reactions under
  step 7 have been described, such as the Emb proteins (), AftA (), and AftB ().
