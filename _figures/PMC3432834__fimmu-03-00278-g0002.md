caption: The two NF-κB activation pathways induced by RANK, CD40, and Ltβ R signaling.
  Either RANK, CD40, or LtβR signaling is capable of activating the non-classical
  NF-κB pathway. In the steady state, the protein complex consisting of TRAF2, TRAF3,
  and cIAP1/2 binds to and poly-ubiquitinates NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK). The poly-ubiquitinated
  NIK is immediately degraded by the 26S-proteasome machinery. The engagement of the
  receptors with their ligands recruits the TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1/2 complex, leading
  to the release of NIK from the complex. The stabilized NIK activates the IKK α complex
  by phosphorylation, which in turn phosphorylates p100, thus sequestering RelB in
  the cytoplasm. Subsequently, p100 is poly-ubiquitinated and converted to p52 by
  partial degradation, an event that leads to the nuclear translocation of the active
  RelB/p52 complex. The RANKL-RANK and CD40L-CD40 interaction recruits TRAF6 to their
  cytoplasmic tails. TRAF6 activates the downstream serine/threonine kinase, typically
  TGF-β activating kinase 1 (TAK1), and activated TAK1 causes the activation of the
  IKK complex, which consists of IKK α, IKK β, and NEMO. Thereafter, the activated
  IKK complex phosphorylates IkB α, thereby inducing the degradation of IkB α to lead
  to the nuclear translocation of the RelA complex. The TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation
  might induce the expression of RelB. Although LtβR also can activate the classical
  pathway, there is no supporting evidence to date that the LtβR-mediated classical
  pathway regulates mTEC development. Such protein modifications as phosphorylation
  and ubiquitination are omitted in this figure for simplicity.

  description: The two NF-κB activation pathways induced by RANK, CD40, and Ltβ R
    signaling. Either RANK, CD40, or LtβR signaling is capable of activating the non-classical
