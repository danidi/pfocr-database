caption: A, in a non-catabolic state, stimulation with growth factors, such as insulin-like
  growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and hormones, such as insulin, leads to the activation
  of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling cascade. Phosphorylation
  of Forkhead box O (FOXO) 1 or 3 by Akt1 leads to their exclusion from the nucleus,
  and a reduction in the expression of key genes involved in protein degradation,
  namely muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1), and regulation
  of carbohydrate oxidation (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)). B, during LPS-induced
  endotoxaemia, Akt1 is in a predominantly dephosphorylated/inactive state, possibly
  due to elevated cytokine levels, such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). This
  enables FOXO factors to up-regulate MAFbx and MuRF1 expression, promoting ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway (UPP)-mediated protein degradation, as well as PDK4, causing inhibition
  of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), down-regulation of carbohydrate oxidation,
  and potentially inducing insulin resistance.
