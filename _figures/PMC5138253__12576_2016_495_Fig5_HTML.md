caption: Different roles of Gq- and Gs-coupled GPCRs expressed by AgRP neurons in
  food intake. Gq-coupled GPCRs (e.g., ghrelin receptors) stimulate the calcium signaling
  pathway, resulting in an acute feeding response caused by NPY and GABA release.
  By contrast, Gs-coupled GPCRs (e.g., PACAP receptors) stimulate the cAMP signaling
  pathway, resulting in long-lasting feeding caused by AgRP release
