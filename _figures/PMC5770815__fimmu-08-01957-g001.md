caption: Kynurenic acid (KYNA) synthesis along the kynurenine pathway and its mode
  of action. The catabolism of TRP by the enzymes TDO or IDO represents the rate-limiting
  step in KYNA synthesis. The intermediate metabolite kynurenine can be further processed
  through three distinct pathways to form KYNA, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and anthranilic
  acid. KYNA is formed by the irreversible transamination of KYN either via kynurenine
  aminotransferases (KAT I–IV) or through the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  KYNA is a non-competitive antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors (GLUT-R)
  as well as of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) expressed on neuronal
  cells. Apart from neuromodulatory properties, KYNA is an agonist of the broadly
  expressed G-protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).
  Furthermore, KYNA functions as an ROS scavenger. Black arrows mark enzymatic reactions
  and dashed arrows include more than one catalytic reaction step. FOR, formamidase;
  IDO, indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase; TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; TPH, tryptophan
  hydroxylase; KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KMO, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase;

  acid receptor; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; KAR, kainate receptor.
