caption: 'Changes in proteins or metabolites of lipid metabolism pathway affect the
  life cycle of HBV: potential targets for HBV suppression. Firstly, inhibition of
  FAS activity decreased fatty acid (FA) synthesis and then suppressed HBV production
  and secretion (; ; ). An increasing level of different FA would induce a different
  effect on HBV, such as promotion of HBV replication and expression by palmitate
  or stearate (), while suppression of HBV by arachidonic acid (). As cholesterol
  is the necessary component of HBV particle, inhibition of HMGCR or SQLE decreased
  cholesterol biosynthesis and suppressed HBV production (; ). Increased HBV replication
  could be induced through LXR activation by oxysterols or FXR activation by bile
  acid (; ; ). And inhibition of ApoE decreased HBV infection, production, or secretion
  (). Besides, decreasing PC synthesis inhibited HBV replication (; ), and inhibition
  of RXR increased HBV infection (). Red or green boxes indicated increased or decreased
  levels of lipid and lipid metabolism-related proteins, respectively. (Apo, apolipoprotein;
  FA, fatty acid; FAS, Fatty acid synthetase; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; HBV, hepatitis
  B virus; HMGCR, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; LXR, liver X receptor;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine; RXR, retinoid X receptor; SQLE, Squalene monooxygenase).'
