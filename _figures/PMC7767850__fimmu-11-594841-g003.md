caption: PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway hijacking in oncology. Immune checkpoints are exploited
  by solid tumors to evade or suppress the immune system. The PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibition
  axis, within the tumor microenvironment, will allow many PD-L1 tumor cells to escape
  the immune system through multiple mechanisms. One of these is the decrease of effector
  functions of cytotoxic TLs, directed against the tumor antigen by inducing their
  functional depletion (exhaustion), reducing their cytokines (IL-2) production ability,
  their high proliferation capacity, their cytotoxic activity and consequently the
  resistance to tumor cell lysis. The second step is the functional alterations in
  the production of TNFα, IFNγ, β−chemokines, and degranulation. In the most terminal
  stages of depletion, these cells may enter apoptosis, probably as a consequence
  of over-stimulation. PD-L1 role is also to maintain and induce tumor-associated
  regulatory T-cells (induced Tregs), by promoting their switching from naive CD4+
  TLs. Infiltration of their microenvironment by activated TLs producing pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IFNγ enhances PD-L1 upregulation in tumor cells. This feedback
  loop is thought to be a mechanism of adaptive immune resistance by the tumor. APC,
