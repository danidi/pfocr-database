caption: The balance in signalling through either ALK-1 or ALK-5 regulates leptin
  expression in MSC. TGFβ1 was shown to signal by the ALK-5-Smad2/3 pathway and/or
  the ALK-1-Smad1/5 pathway []. When TGFβ1 binds to TGFβRII, it induces the activation
  of both ALK-1 and ALK-5 pathways, with a predominance of the inhibitory ALK-5-Smad-2
  route. However, the inhibition of ALK-5 favors the activator ALK-1 route, leading
  to increased leptin expression. In the presence of prednisolone, TGFβRII expression
  is up-regulated, but the ALK-5-p-Smad2 pathway is down-regulated and the ALK-1-Smad1/5
  pathway is favored, thereby leading to amplified leptin expression.
