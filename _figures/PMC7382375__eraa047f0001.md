caption: Calcium–CPK–NLP in nitrate signalling. Nitrate triggers a gradually rising
  calcium transient in the cytosol and nucleus. The involvement of phospholipase C
  (PLC)–inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the external or internal sources responsible
  for nitrate-triggered calcium increase are unclear. Increased calcium activates
  calcium-sensor protein kinases (CPKs), including CPK10, CPK30, and CPK32, which
  then phosphorylate NLP7 or other NLPs and transcription factors (TFs). This calcium–CPK–NLP
  signalling cooperates with the unknown nitrate-responsive signal (grey dotted arrow)
  to control gene expression in the primary nitrate response (PNR) as well as the
  NLP7-specific target genes mediating cell cycle and auxin regulation. Dashed arrows
  represent proposed connections. ABA, Abscisic acid; CHO, carbohydrate; NRT, Nitrate
  transporter; OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway.
