caption: Protein misfolding can occur as a result of genetic mutations or oxidative
  damage (1). Once formed, misfolded proteins may be refolded by chaperones (2) or
  tagged with Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains (3) for degradation by the proteasome
  (4). When the chaperone and proteasome systems fail or are overwhelmed, misfolded
  proteins form oligomers and aggregates (5) that can cause cytotoxicity. Recent evidence
  indicates that, under conditions of proteasomal impairment, PD-linked E3 ligase
  parkin co-operates with the E2 enzyme Ubc13/Uev1a to mediate Lys63-linked polyubiquitination
  of misfolded proteins (6). The Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains promote binding
  to HDAC6 (7) and thereby link the misfolded proteins to the dynein motor complex
  for retrograde transport towards the MTOC to form the aggresome (8). Lys63-linked
  polyubiquitination may also promote binding to p62 and thereby facilitate the recruitment
  of autophagic membrane to the aggresome for the formation of an autophagosome (9).
  Subsequent fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome allows the degradation
  of misfolded and aggregated proteins by lysosomal hydrolases (10).
