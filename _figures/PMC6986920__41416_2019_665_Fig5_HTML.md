caption: Model of effect of metformin on lipid metabolism on breast cancer cells.
  Triglyceride is synthesised from fatty acid derived from carbon sources including
  glucose and glutamine and also exogenous fatty acid, requiring modification by elongases
  and desaturases prior to storage in lipid droplets. Metformin inhibits complex 1
  disrupting electron transfer required to catalyse the final dehydrogenation step
  of fatty acid oxidation resulting in the accumulation of triglyceride in lipid droplets.
  AMPK is known to be an activator of fatty acid oxidation and metformin’s predominant
  effects on lipid metabolism in breast cancer cells are via an AMPK-independent pathway
  and secondary to its more direct mitochondrial effect on Complex 1. FA fatty acid,
  TG triglyceride, TCA Cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle.
