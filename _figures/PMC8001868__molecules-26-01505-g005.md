caption: Summary of some of the effects of allicin on eukaryotic cells. Selected proteins
  are directly S-thioallylated and their biochemical function is thus altered (in
  most cases inhibition). This manifests itself in a general oxidative stress response,
  changes in metabolism and the cytoskeleton, an altered immune response and an influence
  on polyamine metabolism. A direct influence on cell membrane integrity can also
  be observed. At the same time, cells also respond to allicin exposure, for example
  through redox-sensitive transcription factors whose activity can be stimulated by
  allicin. Typical factors are the Nrf2-Keap1 system in mammals or the Yap1 transcription
  factor in yeast. These lead to the activation of protective mechanisms against oxidative
  stress. Various defense mechanisms are subsequently activated, with GSH synthesis
  being of particular importance. Associated with this is the Pentose Phosphate Pathway,
  in heterotrophic organisms the most important source of NADPH, the electron donor
  for glutathione reductase (Glr, GR). However, the expression of anti-apoptotic genes
  is also significant for protection against allicin, as is the phytohormone jasmonic
  acid in plants. Thioredoxins, especially Trx2, also seem to play a subordinate role,
  and their contribution is not as marked as that of the glutathione system. At =
  Arabidopsis thaliana, Cc = Chara corallina, Hs = Homo sapiens, Rd = Rhoeo discolor,
  Sc = Saccharomyces cerevisiae [,,,,,,,].
