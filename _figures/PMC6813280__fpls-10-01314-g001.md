caption: Schematic model of plant innate immune defense process against Sclerotinia
  sclerotiorum infection. In the model, plant defense process can be split into (I)
  recognition, (II) signal-transduction, and (III) defense response. (I) Plant recognition
  of MAMPs (or PAMPs) and DAMPs are detected by PRRs in apoplast. The SCFE1–RLP30/SOBIR1/BAK1
  recognition, a classical PAMP–PRR recognition mode, is shown. PRRs of other MAMPs
  and the recognition of OGs, typical DAMPs, by WAK1 remain to be identified. Additionally,
  potential effectors secreted by S. sclerotiorum may recognized by potential NBS-LRRs
  R protein in cytoplasm. (II) The signal-transduction is performed by the MAP kinase
  cascade or MAPK-independent pathways. In response to S. sclerotiorum infection,
  the MAPK-independent pathways, such as calcium (Ca) signaling pathway, are also
  involved. In the Ca signaling pathway, firstly the NC may be activated by unknown
  PAMP(s) to produce cAMP and cGMP. Subsequently, the two cyclic nucleotides activate
  Ca2+ channels such as CNGCs, resulting in a Ca2+ elevation in the cytoplasm. Then
  the signal of the cytosolic Ca2+ elevation is transduced by Ca2+ sensor proteins,
  such as CaMs, CDPKs as well as CRKs. Further, CDPKs phosphorylate and activate RBOHD/F,
  resulting in ROS accumulation. However, substrates of CRKs are not yet identified
  under the pathogen infection. Importantly, many signal molecules, including SA,
  JA, ET, auxin, ABA, NO as well as ROS, play key roles in the signal-transduction.
  (III) These signals direct various nuclear proteins including transcription factors,
  transcription activators as well as protein kinases, such as WRKY33, CAMTA3 and
  CCaMK, to activate specific defense responses, including pathogenesis-related proteins,
  ROS production, detoxification, oxidative protection, callose deposition camalexin
  production and other specialized secondary metabolites. Partition of the defense
  process is generally according to the ref. (), and the model is expounded in the
