caption: Figure 3. Transcriptional repression resulting from alteration of chromatin
  structure. Methylated DNA binds to a protein complex consisting of a methyl binding
  protein (MBP), which has a methyl-binding domain and a transcriptional repression
  domain, a corepressor molecule (CR), and a histone deacetylase (HDAC). After binding
  of this complex to the methylated DNA, the histones around which the DNA is wrapped
  become deacetylated, resulting in a compression and compaction of the chromatin
  structure. This makes the DNA inaccessible, and thus functional transcription is
  no longer possible.
