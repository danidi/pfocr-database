caption: '(a) In neural progenitors, agonist binding to cannabinoid receptors couples
  to the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway via Gi proteins. Trans-activated (by phosphorylation)
  receptor tyrosine kinases (Trks) might produce signal amplification by also using
  mTORC1 as a molecular effector. Akt can elicit cell growth and survival effects
  (thus being mitogenic) either by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)
  and activating β-catenin or by activating mTORC1, which leads to p27 inhibition
  and Pax6 phosphorylation and expressional up-regulation.(b) In glioma cells, cannabinoids
  trigger ER stress by engaging (at least) two mechanisms: cannabinoid receptors stimulate
  de novo synthesis of ceramide in the ER via Gi-dependent and perhaps also Gi-independent
  mechanisms,; and TRPV1 receptors on the ER, which mediate Ca2+ release from this
  organelle to the cytoplasm and, conceivably, deplete ER Ca2+ stores. Ceramide accumulation
  and Ca2+ depletion in the ER converge at the phosphorylation (that is, inhibition)
  of eIF2α and the induction of ATF-4, which, in turn, triggers cell death by two
  signaling cascades: up-regulation of TRIB-3 expression, leading to the inhibition
  of the AKT-mTORC1 axis; and up-regulation of ATF-3 expression.'
