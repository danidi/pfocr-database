caption: 'Role of ATM in cellular responses. ATM kinase activity increases immediately
  after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). ATM mediates the early stages of the
  rapid induction of several signaling pathways, which include regulation of the cell-cycle
  checkpoint controls, activation of the DNA-DSB (double-strand break) repair pathway,
  activation of stress responses, and maintenance of telomeres. ‘P’ with black solid
  arrows indicates reported phosphorylation events; dashed arrows represent possible
  signaling steps and do not imply direct interaction between proteins; ‘C’ indicates
  sequestering in cytoplasm; ‘R’ indicates repair complexes; and ‘T’ indicates a role
  for the protein in telomere metabolism. ATM influences telomere function through
  direct interaction with TRF1. In addition, c-Abl phosphorylates hTERT and negatively
  regulates telomerase activity. The other downstream effector of ATM in telomere
  metabolism is 14-3-3σ. Abbreviations: AP-1: Apetala1 transcription factor; BRCA1:
