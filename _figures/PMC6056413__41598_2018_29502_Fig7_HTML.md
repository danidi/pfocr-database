caption: Schematic diagram showing proposed pathway through which cyclic mechanical
  loading regulates primary cilia expression to control tendon matrix turnover. Mechanical
  loading disrupts primary cilia expression via TGFβR and HDAC6 activation. This in
  turn may modulate cilia signalling, including suppression of TGFβ signalling as
  part of a negative feedback mechanism regulating tendon matrix turnover in response
  to mechanical loading.

    This in turn may modulate cilia signalling, including suppression of TGFβ signalling
