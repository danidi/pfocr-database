caption: A summary of the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway regulating xCT expression and system
  xc− activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In the current investigation, NRF2 upregulates
  xCT transcription, as well as mRNA and protein levels, in human MCF-7 breast cancer
  cells. Under basal conditions, KEAP1 facilitates the ubiquitination (UB) and proteasomal
  breakdown of NRF2, while in response to oxidative stress (ROS), NRF2 dissociates
  from KEAP1, enabling NRF2 to translocate to the nucleus. Nuclear NRF2 binds to the
  antioxidant response element (ARE) in the xCT promoter, activating transcription.
  xCT protein is then transported to the membrane, where it couples to 4F2hc, which
  together comprise system xc−. The antiporter functions to export glutamate (GLU)
  and import cystine. Cystine is then reduced to cysteine, which is utilized in the
  production of glutathione (GSH), thereby protecting MCF-7 cells from oxidative stress.
