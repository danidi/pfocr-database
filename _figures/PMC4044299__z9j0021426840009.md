caption: TG2 reprograms the inflammatory signaling circuitry. Inflammatory cytokines
  produced by infiltrating immune cells induce TG2 expression in cancer cells and
  host cells (tumor-associated fibroblasts). Due to low Ca2+ and high GTP levels,
  intracellular TG2 is predominantly present as a cryptic enzyme and serves as a scaffold
  protein. For example, it interacts with IκBα and results in its degradation via
  a proteasome-independent pathway. This results in increased activation of NF-κB.
  Activated NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and induces expression of multiple genes.
  TG2 is also a target gene for NF-κB, which results in an auto-induction loop between
  NF-κB and TG2. NF-κB regulates genes involved in promoting drug resistance and metastasis.
  TG2 expression in fibroblasts induces the synthesis of ECM proteins (e.g., collagens,
  fibronectin). Extracellular TG2, in turn, crosslinks these and other proteins and
  stabilizes the ECM. Low turnover of TG2-modified ECM, coupled with enhanced synthesis
  of ECM component proteins, results in fibrosis and desmoplastic response, which
  further promote aggressive phenotype in cancer cells.
