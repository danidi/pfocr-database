caption: 'Simplified overview of the compartments, the main pathways and the metabolites
  in most Chromista; calvin cycle, fatty acid synthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle,
  polyunsaturated FA pathway, β-oxidation and lipid synthesis shown in black arrows.
  Involved enzymes are shown in red: ACCase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACS, Acyl-CoA
  synthetase, ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; ATP:CL, ATP-citrat lyase;
  ENR, enoyl-ACP reductase; FAT, fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase; HD, 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  dehydratase; KAR, 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; KAS, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase; LACS,
  long chain acyl CoA synthetase; MAT, malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase; ME, malic enzyme;
  PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; TAG, triacylglyceride;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid. Different MEs possess different localizations (plastidial,
  mitochondrial). For simplicity, ME is placed in the cytosol. Modified after [,,].'
