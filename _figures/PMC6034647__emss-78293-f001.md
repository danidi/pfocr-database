caption: TRPC3 is a key player in the mGluR1 signaling pathway, which is vital for
  Purkinje cell function. Glutamate released from granule cell terminals binds to
  the mGluR1 receptor at the Purkinje cell postsynaptic site, which activates phospholipase
  C/D via Gα protein to produce inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
  Prodynorphin (PDYN) expression is inversely correlated with the expression of mGluR1
  (dotted line). The GluD2 receptor is associated with a mGluR1-TRPC3-PKCγ signaling
  complex and might regulate mGluR1-mediated synaptic transmission in cerebellar neurons.
  IP3 subsequently binds to its receptor IP3R1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
  resulting in Ca2+ release from this intracellular store. Protein kinase C γ (PKCγ)
  is activated by DAG and Ca2+. mGluR1-dependent synaptic depolarization is dependent
  on TRPC3. TRPC3 can be regulated by DAG, interaction with IP3R1, and inhibitory
  phosphorylation by PKCγ (dashed lines). Activation of TRPC3 results in Ca2+ influx.
  TRPC3 is also permeable for Na+ ions and might activate voltage-gated calcium channels
  including Cav2.1 through changes in membrane potential (ΔVm, dashed line). Loss
  of any component in the depicted signaling cascade results in cerebellar ataxia
  in human and/or mouse. Names of mutant ataxic mice and human genetic ataxias associated
  with mutations in genes encoding signaling molecules are indicated in light blue.
  Gene names that differ from the protein names are shown in parentheses. Knockout
  mice deficient in the genes encoding mGluR1, Gαq and PLCβ4 also display cerebellar
  ataxia. Please see [] for a more detailed review.
