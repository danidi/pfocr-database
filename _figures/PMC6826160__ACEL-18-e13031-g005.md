caption: ROS‐dependent priming and activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway.
  In active mitochondria, cardiolipin (CL) anchors cytochrome c (Cyt C) in the inner
  mitochondrial membrane (IMM) between complexes III and IV of the ETC. The structure
  of inner mitochondrial membrane cristae junctions is maintained by OPA1 oligomers.
  Anti‐apoptotic Bcl‐2 family proteins (Bcl‐2, Bcl‐xL) dominate over pro‐apoptotic
  Bcl‐2 family proteins (Bak, Bax) preventing outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) permeabilization
  and the induction of apoptosis. VDAC2 binding also inhibits Bak activation. Toxins
  such as MPTP and Rotenone (and possibly genetic mutations; Parkin, PINK‐1) induce
  significant mitochondrial oxidative stress, which triggers cristae remodeling via
  OPA1 oligomer dissociation, and catalyzes the disconnection of Cyt C from CL following
  oxidation of CL. Oxidized CL relocates to the OMM, where it binds cytoplasmic truncated
  (t)‐BID, and Cyt C accumulates in the intermembrane space (IMS). This does not trigger
  the intrinsic cell death pathway, but is thought to prime mitochondria for the release
  of Cyt C and other pro‐apoptotic factors (Smac, AIF; not shown) upon compounding
  cellular stress signals. Additional oxidative stress impairs Bcl‐2/Bcl‐xL and VDAC2
  and activates p53/JNK and Bax/Bak, causing translocation of Bax/Bak to the OMM with
  the help of outer membrane CL‐BID complexes. This triggers OMM permeabilization
  and the release of Cyt C, Smac, and AIF. In the cytoplasm (Cyto), Cyt C binds to
  Apaf‐1 and procaspase‐9, which together activate executioner caspases that trigger
  apoptosis
