caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of PQS, HHQ, HQNO and DHQ in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
  AQs are derived from a condensation reaction between anthranilate and β-keto fatty
  acids. Anthranilate is derived from either the PhnAB/TrpEG or the KynABU metabolic
  pathways using either chorismate or tryptophan as precursors, respectively. Anthranilate
  is first activated with coenzyme A (CoA) by PqsA. Anthranilate-CoA and an activated
  β-ketodecanoate are condensed, possibly via the PqsBCD enzymes to HHQ, releasing
  CO2 and H2O. The monooxygenase PqsH converts HHQ to PQS. HQNO is derived from the
  same starting products as HHQ, but utilizes the additional monooxygenase PqsL. HHQ
  is not a precursor for HQNO. DHQ, which technically is not an AQ, is produced by
  PqsD independent of PqsB and PqsC.
