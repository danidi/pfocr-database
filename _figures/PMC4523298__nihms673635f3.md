caption: Conserved and differential networks for the proteins in the PI3K-AKT kinase
  pathway between breast and ovarian cancer cell lines computed using a Bayesian FDR
  set to 0.10. In the conserved network (top panel), the red (green) lines between
  the proteins indicate a negative (positive) correlation between the proteins. In
  the differential network (bottom row), the blue lines between the proteins indicate
  a relationship that was significant in the ovarian cancer cell lines but not in
  the breast cancer cell lines; the orange lines between the proteins indicate a relationship
  in the breast cancer cell lines but not in the ovarian cancer cell lines. The thickness
  of the edges corresponds to the strength of the associations, with stronger associations
  having greater thickness.
