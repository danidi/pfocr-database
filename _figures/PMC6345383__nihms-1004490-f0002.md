caption: PDA cells have a remarkable ability to adapt to nutrient fluctuations and
  targeted therapies. For example, PDA cells can rapidly adapt to GLS inhibition (GLSi)
  through multiple mechanisms of metabolic rewiring. Blocking the conversion of glutamine
  to glutamate perturbs redox balance in PDA cells by disrupting the initial steps
  of the non-canonical glutamine pathway that generates NADPH. One means by which
  PDA overcomes GLSi is by upregulating cellular reactions that generate glutamate
  bypassing the need for GLS activity (lower red box). Scavenging by macropinocytosis
  (blue membrane protrusion) and recycling by autophagy (dark blue forming phagophore)
  of macromolecules through the lysosome (dark blue circle, red dots) can also generate
  glutamate to fuel PDA metabolism downstream of GLS. Another means of adaptation
  is by directly upregulating metabolic reactions that restore reducing potential
  of the cell (upper red box). The plasticity of PDA metabolism allows for adaption
  at multiple levels making the cells exceptionally resistant to microenvironmental
  or therapeutic induced changes in nutrients.
