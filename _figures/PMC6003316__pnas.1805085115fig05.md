caption: Genes of gossypol pathway enzymes and their expressions. Genes of the enzymes
  catalyzing the defined steps in MVA and gossypol pathways and their homologs are
  shown. The expressions are indicated by heatmap, estimated using Cuffdiff by computing
  the FPKM value (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads sequenced)
  for each transcript. Genes encoding the identified enzymes or showing an expression
  pattern correlated to gossypol biosynthesis are on the TOP. Dashed arrows indicate
  unidentified reaction(s). 0Ov, 0-dpa ovule; 25Ov, 25-dpa ovule; 0Sd, 0-h postgermination
  seed; 5Sd, 5-h postgermination seed; ACAT, acyl CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase;
  Ca, calyx; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; FPS, FPP synthase; HMGR, HMG-CoA reductase;
  HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) synthase; IPP, isopentenyl
  diphosphate; IPPI, IPP isomerase; Lf, leaf; MVK, mevalonate kinase; MVP, phosphomevalonate
  kinase; Pe, petal; Pi, pistil; PMD, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; Rt, root;

  are indicated by their accession numbers and also shown in the genome atlas (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S19).
