caption: Schematic diagram illustrating a role of PI3K, Rho, and ROCK pathways in
  hypoxia-induced ATP release and ATP-mediated angiogenic effects in VVEC. Activation
  of PI3K/Rho/ROCK pathway in response to hypoxia results in regulated ATP release
  from VVEC. In turn, extracellular ATP triggers/initiates P2 receptor-dependent activation
  of PI3K/Rho/ROCK pathway, leading to angiogenic responses in VVEC such as proliferation,
  migration, and tube formation.
