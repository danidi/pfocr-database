caption: Modeling the calcium-mediated pro-apoptotic action of less toxic natural
  products. A. Less toxic natural products target a constrained helix 8 containing
  GPCR leading to the activation of a G protein. The Gαq/11 as well as the Gβ1 and
  Gβ2 subunits of the heterotrimeric G protein are released and activate PLC which
  results in the cleavage of PIP2 into InsP3 and DAG. InsP3 binds to the InsP3R, a
  Ca2+-channel in the ER membrane, leading to release of ER calcium into the cytoplasm.
  B. The rise in [Ca2+]i leads to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, by
  uptake of Ca2+ into the mitochondria, opening the mPTP and releasing SMAC/DIABLO
  and cytochrome c from the mitochondria and binding to XIAP and APAF1, respectively
  as part of the apoptosome. This leads to the activation of caspase 9 which in turn
  activates caspase 3 resulting in DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. Activation of
  calpains, Ca2+ activated endoproteases, leads to cleavage of calcium pumps (e.g.
  PMCA1), cytostructural proteins (e.g. fodrin) and nuclear substrates, resulting
  in the breakdown of cellular architecture and apoptosis. A lowering of ER calcium
  levels results in the unfolded protein response (UPR) due to the negative effect
  on Ca2+-dependent molecular chaperones such as GRP78. This is followed by activation
  of the signaling protein PERK which phosphorylates eIF2α and leads to the shutoff
  of mRNA translation except for certain transcripts like ATF4. This transcription
  factor activates the promotor of DDIT-3 (CHOP). DDIT-3 regulates additional genes
  leading to apoptosis. The increase in cytoplasmic calcium also leads to the activation
  of p53 and multiple pro-apoptotic gene products in different cellular compartments.
  Apoptosis is further enhanced by crosstalk between the aforementioned pathways.
