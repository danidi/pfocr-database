caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified ERK as the Top network signaling Hub
  where the shaded shapes indicate the candidate genes from the present study. RANGAP1
  is found in the ERK pathway. Dotted line indicates an indirect cellular interaction
  and solid lines indicate a physical interaction between genes. Genes are identified
  with their HUGO symbol. Dotted line indicates an indirect cellular interaction and
  solid lines indicate a physical interaction (acts on or inhibits) between genes.
  Different shapes (diamond, circle or rectangles) of the nodes represent functional
  classification of the genes.
