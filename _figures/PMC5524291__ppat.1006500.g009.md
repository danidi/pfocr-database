caption: EBNA3C interacts with Bcl6 protein and enhances its degradation through the
  ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Furthermore, EBNA3C also inhibits Bcl6 promoter transcription
  activity by recruiting IRF4. Finally, the EBNA3C-mediated Bcl6 downregulation contributes
  to cellular proliferation through regulation of its downstream signaling pathway
  (Bcl2 and CCND1), thus promoting oncogenic transformation in EBV infected cells.
