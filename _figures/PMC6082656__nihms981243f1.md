caption: (A) Tetrapyrroles are synthesized in the plastid from glutamyl-tRNA precursors.
  At a key branch point, PP IX is converted either into haem by the Fe chelatases
  or into Mg PP IX by the Mg chelatase complex (composed of ChlH = GUN5, ChlI, ChlD,
  and GUN4), which is then dedicated to chlorophyll biosynthesis. FC2-synthesized
  haem remains in the chloroplast, where it associates with pETC proteins. FC1 synthesizes
  haem for the rest of the cell. Nuclear genes that encode photosynthesis-associated
  proteins (PhANGs) are positively regulated by FC1-generated haem and/or negatively
  regulated by Mg PP IX accumulation. (B) GUN1 integrates diverse signals to control
  nuclear gene expression. Severe disruption of chloroplast function, such as inhibition
  of plastid translation or oxidative stress caused by inhibition of carotenoid biosynthesis,
  triggers a retrograde signalling pathway from the chloroplast to the nucleus that
  requires GUN1. GUN1 promotes the activity of ABI4, a transcription factor that repress
  PhANG expression, and represses transcription of GLK1/2, transcription factors that
  promote photomorphogenesis by antagonizing PIF transcription factors.
