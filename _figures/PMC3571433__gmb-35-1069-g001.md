caption: 'General view of the small RNA pathways in plants. Cis/Trans-Acting small
  interfering RNAs (TAS) Pathway: A TAS gene is transcribed by RNA Pol II into a TAS
  precursor, later this precursor is recognized by a complementary siRNA and sliced
  by Argonaute (AGO) proteins into small RNA which serves as a template for RNA Dependent
  RNA Polymerases (RDR) to make dsRNAs. This siRNA duplex originated by Dicer-Like
  directs cleavage of the TAS precursor in cis, or another target mRNAs in trans.
  MicroRNA Pathway: A MIR gene, usually located in intergenic or intronic region,
  is transcribed by RNA Pol II into a precursor RNA named pri-microRNA, which is stabilized
  and cleaved by a protein complex composed by Dicer-like proteins (DCL) and Hyponastic
  Leaves (HYL) into a pre-microRNA which is further processed by the same complex
  plus Serrate (SE) into a mature microRNA. The HUA Enhancer (HEN) methylates the
  resulting mature microRNA form in the 2’-hydroxy termini of both strands. This methylated
  mature form is exported to cytoplasm through HASTY protein (HST). Once in the cytoplasm,
  AGO proteins recognize one strand of the mature microRNA and direct it to the target
  gene. Later, the AGO can induce the slicing of mRNA target or repress the translation
  complex. The other microRNA strand is directed to the Exosome and degraded by Small
  RNA Degrading Nuclease (SDN). Natural Acting Small RNAs (NAT) Pathway: Overlapping
  genes can be transcribed by RNA Pol II, resulting in a NAT precursor complementary
  to an siRNA, which serves as a template to the RDR proteins. The DCL protein cleaves
  this double-stranded precursor into dsRNAs, which are exported to the cytosol by
  HST protein. The NAT-siRNAs loaded into AGO complexes induce mRNA degradation in
  the same way as for microRNA pathway.'
