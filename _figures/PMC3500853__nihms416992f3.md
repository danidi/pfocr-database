caption: Mechanisms of EphrinB reverse signaling. (A) EphrinB activation by EphB receptor
  leads to the recruitment of Src family kinases (SFKs) that phosphorylate EphrinB
  intracellular domain at tyrosine residues. The adaptor molecule Grb4, which contains
  a Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain, is recruited to the phosphorylated EphrinB and initiates
  a number of signaling events that regulate cytoskeleton dynamics and focal adhesions.
  The phosphorylated EphrinB can also recruit the Jak2/STAT3 complex; the phosphorylated
  STAT3 translocates to the nucleus regulating expression of target genes. (B) Activated
  EphrinB regulates the internalization of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 through PDZ-mediated
  binding of yet unknown protein(s). After VEGF binding, VEGFR is phosphorylated;
  signaling from activated VEGFR requires internalization, which is positively regulated
  by EphrinB signaling. (C) RGS3 is a PDZ-containing protein that constitutively binds
  to EphrinB and links signaling from the G-protein-coupled receptor CXCR4 to EphrinB.
  CXCR4 signaling in response to the ligand SDF1 is induced by the dissociation of
  Gβγ and GTP-Gα subunits. PDZ-RGS3 can inhibit CXCR4 signaling by enhancing the GTPase
  activity of the Gα subunit, resulting in the reformation of the inactive heterodimeric
  CXCR4 receptor. (D) The scaffold protein Dishevelled binds EphrinB through its DEP
  domain and mediates signaling via the Rho small GTPase pathway. (E) The scaffold
  protein Par6 associates with EphrinB resulting in the loss of tight junctions. PAR6
  forms a complex with activated apical protein kinase C (aPKC) and Cdc42-GTP; the
  complex localizes to the apical cell junctions where it regulates tight junctions.
  EphrinB1 can compete with Cdc42 for binding to Par6 and thus reduce tight junctions.
  (F) Cross-regulation between EphrinB phosphorylation- and PDZ-dependent signaling
  pathways. The phosphatase PTB-BL, recruited through its PDZ domain to EphrinB cytoplasmic
  domain, inactivates Src and dephosphorylates EphrinB.
