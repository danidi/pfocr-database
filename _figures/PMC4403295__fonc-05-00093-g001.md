caption: The UPR signaling pathway. Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized
  by the rER and translocated into the ER lumen. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α
  and causes general translational attenuation. The PERK-eIF2α pathway selectively
  induces expression of the transcription factor ATF4. Activated IRE1α undergoes dimerization
  and oligomerization, splices an intron from the XBP1 mRNA and produces the transcription
  factor XBP1s. IRE1α can also induce mRNA degradation. Activated ATF6 translocates
  to the Golgi and is sequentially cleaved by the Golgi-resident site-1 and site-2
  proteases, thereby releasing cleaved ATF6.
