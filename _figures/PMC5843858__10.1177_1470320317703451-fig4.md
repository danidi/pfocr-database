caption: 'Diagram showing the possible mechanism involved in the difference between
  the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) I/D polymorphisms affecting the generation
  of kinin peptide agonists for B2R and B1R in the downstream variation signaling
  effects. (a) Schematic representation of II/ID genotypes that presented lower ACE
  concentration, which leads to a decrease of bradykinin degradation and consequently
  an increase of downstream signaling effects via B2 and B1 receptors. (b) Molecular
  signaling pathway via B2 and B1 receptor affected by the higher concentration of
  ACE in DD subjects, which increase the bradykinin degradation consequently reducing
  the downstream signaling. The pathways highlighted in black in each genotype are
  supposed to be the more active. BK-(1-5), FFA: fat-free acid; CPN: soluble plasma
  carboxypeptidase N; CPM: membrane-bound carboxypeptidase M; IR: insulin receptor;
  B2R: bradykinin B2 receptor; B1R: bradykinin B1 receptor; P: phosphate; IRS1: insulin
  receptor substrate 1; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT: protein kinase B; mTOR:
  mechanistic target of rapamycin; GLUT4: MAP kinase: mitogen activated protein kinases;
