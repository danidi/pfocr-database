caption: Schematic representation of the differentially expressed genes and how they
  are induced upon injection by (A) pristane or (B) phytol. The molecular pathway
  that is shared between the arthritis resistant DA.Ncf1E3 rat strain and the arthritis
  treatment achieved with phytol is the Ifn-β-dependent pathway, which results in
  the upregulation of Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Oas1 and Mx2. The inflammatory arthritis
  that is induced by an injection with pristane is characterized by increased expression
  of the Ifnγ-connected signature genes Ass, Cxcl9 and Mmp12, which potentially could
  be used as molecular markers for an initiating inflammatory response. As this pathway
  is also induced by pristane in the DA.Ncf1E3 strain this upregulation per se does
  not cause arthritis. Most important in this mechanism is how administration of phytol
  induces arthritis protection via the Ifn-β-regulated pathway in the arthritis-susceptible
  DA rats.
