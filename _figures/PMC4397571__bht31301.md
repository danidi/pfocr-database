caption: Schematic depicting 2 proposed mechanisms of interaction between attentional
  control systems and reading processing. Following presentation of a visual word
  stimulus (i.e., plaid) and basic perceptual processing, activation automatically
  proceeds along 2 processing routes. The phonological route is shown on top (/p l
  e d/) and the lexical route is depicted on the bottom (plaid). Following route processing,
  a single response is selected and prepared for articulation (? /pled/ or /plæd/
  ?), a step that has been labeled “phoneme recognition” (see , Fig. , for an updated
  dual route schematic). Finally, an overt response is articulated. Pathway control
  refers to the proposed site of early interaction between an attentional control
  system(s) and reading processing, reflecting the biasing of processing along one
  of 2 routes, depending on task demands and stimulus features. Response checking
  refers to a later interaction between an attentional control system(s) and reading
  processing, to ensure the appropriate response is selected from potentially competing
  alternatives.
