caption: Schematic model of mammalian heme homeostasis. Presumptive heme pathways
  that are currently unknown are marked with a ? .(A) In eukaryotic cells, heme is
  synthesized via a multi-step pathway that is spatially separated between the cytosol
  and mitochondria. The export of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from the mitochondria
  is unknown. ALA is converted to CPgenIII via four enzymatic reactions and CPgenIII
  is imported into the mitochondria by the outer membrane (OM) transporter, presumably
  ABCB6 or OGC. CPgenIII is converted to protoporphyrinogen (PPgenIX) and PPIX on
  the intermembrane space (IMS) side of the inner membrane (IM). The final step of
  heme synthesis occurs by the enzymatic chelation of ferrous iron (Fe+2) into PPIX
  catalyzed by ferrochelatase (FECH) located on the matrix side of the IM. Mitoferrin
  (Mfrn) / Mrs 3/4 is predicted to import Fe+2 into the mitochondria.(B) The nascent
  heme moiety is somehow transported through two mitochondrial membranes and incorporated
  into a multitude of hemoproteins, presumably by hemochaperones, in different cellular
  compartments. Recent studies have identified HCP-1 as the heme importer, primarily
  in intestinal cells, while FLVCR and BCRP is predicted to export heme in erythrocytes.
