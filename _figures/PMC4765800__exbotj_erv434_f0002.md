caption: Satellite metabolic pathway of potato–Phytophthora interaction showing the
  RR metabolites and their catalysing enzymes involved in their biosynthesis detected
  in resistant potato inoculated with P. infestans or mock-solution. Metabolites and
  genes detected in this study are marked in red. Detailed interactions are presented
  in Fig. 7. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)
