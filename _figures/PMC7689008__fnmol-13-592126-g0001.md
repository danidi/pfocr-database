caption: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) regulate protein synthesis machinery. CAMs
  such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), down syndrome cell adhesion molecule
  (DSCAM), DSCAM-Like-1 (DSCAML1), and L1 are cleaved by proteases, releasing fragments
  containing their intracellular domains, which are transported into the nucleus (1).
  In the nucleus, the CAM-derived fragments regulate the transcription of genes involved
  in neuronal differentiation and synapse formation by binding to transcription factors.
  Several CAMs, including NCAM, L1, and N-cadherin, activate the MAPK pathway, which
  results in the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as cyclic AMP response-element
  binding protein (CREB), thereby regulating transcription (2). NCAM activates the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by clustering and activating fibroblast
  growth factor receptor (FGFR) at the cell surface (2) and by activating an Src family
  kinase Fyn in lipid rafts (3). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway,
  which controls the rate of translation, can be either activated or inhibited by
  CAMs. Homophilic binding of NB3 inhibits the mTOR pathway via PTPσ, whereas neuroligin-3
  inhibits the mTOR pathway in cultured neurons and decreases the rate of protein
  translation by stabilizing the mTOR repressor PTEN (4). Adhesion molecule on glia
  (AMOG) increases cell size, when expressed in human glioma cells, and activates
  mTOR in these cells by promoting Akt phosphorylation independently of PI3K (5).
  The trafficking of newly synthesized proteins via TGN-derived organelles is regulated
  by NCAM, which binds to these organelles via spectrin, and traps them at contact
  sites between neurons, thus directing newly synthesized proteins to nascent synapses
  (6). The activation of Src kinase by CD44 stabilizes the structure of the Golgi
  apparatus by regulating the polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton (7). See the
  text for further details and references.

  description: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) regulate protein synthesis machinery.
    CAMs such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), down syndrome cell adhesion
    molecule (DSCAM), DSCAM-Like-1 (DSCAML1), and L1 are cleaved by proteases, releasing
    fragments containing their intracellular domains, which are transported into the
    nucleus (1). In the nucleus, the CAM-derived fragments regulate the transcription
    of genes involved in neuronal differentiation and synapse formation by binding
    to transcription factors. Several CAMs, including NCAM, L1, and N-cadherin, activate
    the MAPK pathway, which results in the phosphorylation of transcription factors
    such as cyclic AMP response-element binding protein (CREB), thereby regulating
    transcription (2). NCAM activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
    pathway by clustering and activating fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
    at the cell surface (2) and by activating an Src family kinase Fyn in lipid rafts
    (3). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which controls the rate

    of NB3 inhibits the mTOR pathway via PTPσ, whereas neuroligin-3 inhibits the mTOR
