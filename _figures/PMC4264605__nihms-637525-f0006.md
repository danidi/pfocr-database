caption: Mechanism by which NRIF3/DD1 and DIF-1 regulate apoptosis of breast cancer
  cells. The figure depicts a model that is consistent with our findings that DIF-1
  is a transcriptional repressor that can bind DNA whose activity is reversed by NRIF3/DD1
  and that preincubation with α-amanitin blocks DD1-mediated apoptosis of breast cancer
  cells. Our findings suggest that one or more proapoptotic genes bind to and are
  repressed by DIF-1 in breast cancer cells. Expression of NRIF3/DD1 binds DIF-1 and
  mediates a conformational change that reverses its ability to act as a repressor.
  We do not know whether the NRIF3/DIF-1 complex remains bound to the proapoptotic
  gene(s) or whether the binding of NRIF3/DD1 to DIF-1 results in a dissociation of
  DIF-1 from the proapoptotic gene. By either mechanism, reversal of repression of
  one or more proapoptotic genes leads to gene expression and the initiation of apoptosis.
