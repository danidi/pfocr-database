caption: Schematic diagram of a pyruvate/isocitrate cycle implicated in control of
  GSIS. The cycle is initiated by anaplerotic conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate
  by PC. This leads to accumulation of the TCA cycle intermediates citrate and isocitrate
  and their export from the mitochondria to the cytosol by the CIC. Citrate is then
  converted to isocitrate by cytosolic aconitase, and isocitrate is converted to α-ketoglutarate
  by the cytosolic NADP-dependent ICDc. α-Ketoglutarate can then serve either as a
  direct signal for insulin secretion, for example, by serving as a substrate for
  α-ketoglutarate hydroxylases, or be recycled to pyruvate by one of several mitochondrial
  or cytosolic pathways that remain to be defined (dashed lines). Another byproduct
  of the pyruvate/isocitrate cycle with potential as an insulin secretagogue is cytosolic
  NAPDH, possibly acting through Kv channels or the glutathione/glutaredoxin system.
  This pathway was elucidated by integration of flux analysis by 13C NMR, targeted
  metabolic profiling by GC-MS and MS-MS, and evaluation of the effects of knockdown
  of key genes in the pathway, including CIC and ICDc.
