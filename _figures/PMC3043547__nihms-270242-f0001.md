caption: TNF-α is shown as a representative inducer of the canonical pathway. In this
  pathway, TNF receptor 1 recruits and activates IKK to form a signaling complex through
  TNF receptor associated death domain (TRADD), RIP, and TRAF2. IKK then phosphorylates
  IκB, which leads to IκB ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Subsequently,
  the NF-κB complex (p65/p50) migrates to the nucleus and activates gene transcription.
  In the non-canonical pathway (represented by CD40L), NIK-mediated IKKα activation
  triggers the processing of p100 to create p52. Then the NF-κB complex (p52/RelB)
  moves to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. In the atypical pathway such
  as that activated by UV, IKK-independent mechanisms are involved in IκB phosphorylation.
