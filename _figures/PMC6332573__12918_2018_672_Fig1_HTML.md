caption: The cellular events of N signaling pathway. The steps are (1) N and Dl proteins
  are transcribed, translated and transported to the cell membrane; (2) Dl undergoes
  an endocytic processing step to become the ligand for N; (3) the Dl ligand and N
  receptor interact resulting in a cleavage and endocytosis of a N fragment; (4) A
  second cleavage releases a N product that is translocated to the nucleus

  of complexity in the determination of developmental patterning.
