caption: Schematic diagram of JNK signaling in the tubular epithelial cell response
  to damage. Many insults to the tubular epithelial cell, such as oxidative stress
  and nephrotoxins, as well as cytokines and growth factors can result in activation
  of the JNK pathway. JNK signaling in tubular epithelial cells can result in tubular
  cell damage and consequent tubulointerstitial damage via three pathways. (1) JNK
  activation can directly induce apoptosis and necrosis via mitochondrial dependent
  mechanisms. (2) JNK phosphorylates a number of transcription factors (e.g., c-Jun,
  SMAD3, ATF2) resulting in tubular production of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic
  molecules that promote recruitment and activation of macrophages and myofibroblasts.
  (3) JNK activation is implicated TGF-β induced de-differentiation of tubular cells
  toward a partial mesenchymal phenotype with production of pro-fibrotic factors.
  This switch toward a pro-fibrotic mesenchymal phenotype can also be induced by JNK-dependent
  arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle when tubular cells are undergoing a repair
  response.
