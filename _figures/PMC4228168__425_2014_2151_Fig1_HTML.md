caption: 'Roles of coronatine and type III effectors in modulating defense-related
  hormone signaling. (1) Roles of coronatine. Coronatine (COR) is composed of two
  moieties: coronafacic acid (CFA) and coronamic acid (CMA) (Bender et al. ). Once
  COR moves into the plant cell (presumably through diffusion), it activates JA-signaling
  through mimicking JA-amino acid conjugates such as (+)-7-JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile)
  shown in the model. COR is able to interact with SCFCOI1 receptor complex with modestly
  higher affinity than JA-Ile (Sheard et al. ; Katsir et al. ; Fonseca et al. ). Like
  JA-Ile, COR serves as ‘molecular glue’ between the receptor complex SCFCOI1 and
  the negative regulator JAZ protein (Sheard et al. ), and triggers the degradation
  of JAZ through 26S proteosomal-mediated pathway (Chini et al. ; Thines et al. ).
  Upon JAZ degradation, positive regulator TFs (e.g. MYC2, bHLH, and MYBs) are released
  from suppression, and activate JA-responsive genes (Wasternack and Hause ). MYC2
  also regulates several NAC TFs that suppress SA accumulation through regulating
  SA-biosynthesis gene ICS1 and SA modifying gene BSMT1. These NAC TFs were also found
  to be required for stomatal reopening induced by COR (Zheng et al. ). In return,
  SA-activated, cytosolic NPR1 monomers suppress the JA-signaling pathway. COR’s ability
  to contribute to chlorotic disease symptoms is also mediated through COI1 (Mecey
  et al. ). COR is able to suppress callose deposition through inhibiting an ET-dependent
  indole glucosinolate pathway where the role of COI1 is unknown (Geng et al. ; Millet
  et al. ). Perhaps the CMA moiety of COR mimics the ET precursor ACC, and interferes
  with ET production. Additionaly, COR perturbs auxin and ABA signaling which could
  potentially offset the restriction of bacterial growth caused by flg22-induced suppression
  of auxin signaling (Navarro et al. ) or ABA-induced stomatal closure (Melotto et
  al. ), respectively. Whether COI1 is engaged in auxin and/or ABA perturbation is
  unknown. 2) Roles of type III effectors. AvrB or COR, cooperatively with other T3Es
  and dependent on COI1, induce expression of an ET responsive factor—RAP2.6 (He et
  al. ). HopZ1a acetylates JAZ proteins, causing them to become destabilized dependent
  on COI1, and restores virulence to a cor- mutant of Pto DC3000 (Jiang et al. ).
  HopX1 directly destabilizes JAZ proteins without a requirement for COI1, likely
  via its cysteine protease activity, and restores virulence to a cor- mutant of Pto
  DC3000. HopX1 shares additional activities with COR, including reopening of stomata,
  causing plant cells to lose chlorophyll, and induction of chlorosis in susceptible
  plants (Gimenez-Ibanez et al. ). HopM1 affects SA-dependent secretory pathway through
  interacting with and degrading an ARF-GEF family protein involved in vesicle trafficking
  called AtMIN7 (Nomura et al. ). HopM1 is also functionally redundant with COR in
  suppressing an SA-independent defense sector of which the mechanism is unknown (Geng
  et al. ). Solid lines indicate established interactions. Question marks indicate
  unknown mechanisms. Hormone/coronatine/effector-specifc functions are color coded:
  bold orange lines coronatine-related functions, yellow lines JA-related functions,
  green lines SA-related functions, blue lines ET-related functions, black lines T3Es-related
  functions. Hormones are color coded, and indicated by solid circles. Type III effectors
  are color coded, and indicated by solid stars. Structural similarities between compounds
  are indicated by same color shading of the respective chemical structures'
