caption: Schematic overview of the Nrf2 pathway. In homeostatic conditions, transcription
  factor Nrf2 is bound to its repressor Keap1 and thus subjected to ubiquitin-dependent
  degradation in proteasomes. On the other hand, in stress conditions, Nrf2 released
  from Keap1 is translocated into nucleus where it forms heterodimers with small Maf
  proteins and activates cytoprotective genes through antioxidant response element
  (ARE).
