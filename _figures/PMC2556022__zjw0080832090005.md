caption: Proposed interaction of biochemical modules as a response to cold/heat. A
  cold-induced increase in ATGRP7 and a down-regulation at moderate heat correlates
  with the increase/decrease of the metabolite markers proline and glutamine (see
  also supplemental Tables S1 and S2), whereas the raffinose and galactinol of RFO
  show increase in both temperature treatments, 4 째C and 32 째C. This effect is also
  observed in the starch-deficient mutant thereby indicating that starch deficiency
  and resulting changes in starch mobilization and raffinose/galactinol synthesis
  are not necessarily linked in response to temperature stress and ATGPP7 as long
  as the sucrose synthesis pathway is functioning. However, these observations have
  to be investigated in further detail, also according to a recent discussion on plant
  temperature stress and metabolic effects by Guy et al. (). A clear correlation of
  sucrose with RFO is not observed. Here, other methods like conditional correlation
  analysis are planned in future. In summary, the parallel investigation of the starch-deficient
  mutant and the corresponding WT and the identification of correlative metabolite-protein
  biomarkers uncover the separation of starch storage/mobilization and other metabolic
  processes such as the raffinose/galactinol pathway, proline/glutamine pathways,
  and cold temperature compensation mechanisms driven by circadian output genes like
  the RNA-binding protein At2g21660 (ATGRP7).
