caption: The cartoon picture represents the mechanisms of inhibition of in-vitro metastatic
  potential after single and combined treatment. The downward or upward arrows with
  three different colours beside the protein represent down-regulation or up-regulation
  respectively of that protein for only PARP-1 inhibition (red), only 12C ion exposure
  (green) and combined treatment (blue). Phosphorylation of each protein is denoted
  by P within oval shape attached with the respective protein. The down arrow of different
  colours beside P denotes reduction of phosphorylation of the respective proteins
  after different treatments

papertitle: Reduction of metastatic potential by inhibiting EGFR/Akt/p38/ERK signaling
  pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition after carbon ion exposure is potentiated
  by PARP-1 inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer.
