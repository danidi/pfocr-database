caption: Thyroid hormone action is modulated by the deiodinases. T3 generated via
  D2-mediated deiodination acts via non-genomic mechanisms or the canonical nuclear
  thyroid hormone receptor pathway to regulate TSH and TRH secretion as well as cell
  development and metabolism. D3 terminates the thyroid hormone signaling pathway
  by inactivating T3 molecules into inactive substrates rT3 and/or T2.
