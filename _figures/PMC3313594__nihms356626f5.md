caption: Acute inflammatory pain is characterized by an increase in production of
  inflammatory mediators and decrease in circulating levels of TGF-β1, which leads
  to decreased expression of ALK5 (1a,1b). In turn, this leads to a decrease in signaling
  through the ALK5 receptor and decreased phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (2).
  The decreased expression of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 results in a lower level of translocation
  of these Smad isoforms to the nucleus and a corresponding downregulation of TGF-β/ALK5-
  mediated signaling (3). Our data also show decreased expression of the ALK1 receptor
  but this may be a compensatory response of the endothelium to maintain balance between
  ALK1- and ALK5-mediated signaling events. Interestingly, expression of p-Smad1/5/8
  does not change, suggesting that the TGF-β/ALK1 pathway may predominate at the BBB
  during acute inflammatory pain. Overall, this causes dysregulation of the tight
  junction complex that is demarcated by altered expression of claudin-3, claudin-5,
  occludin and ZO-1 (4a). Additionally, functional expression of Oatp1a4 is increased
  (4b), leading to enhanced brain uptake of Oatp substrate drugs. The result of this
  signaling mechanism is an increase in blood–brain permeability and influx transport
  that is characterized by enhanced CNS drug delivery via the paracellular route or
  by Oatp1a4-mediated transport.
