caption: Summary of the hypothesis. (A) The relationship between the methionine cycle
  of methylation and the transulfuration pathway which converts HCY to cysteine. In
  brain, glial cells are a primary source of released GSH, which is hydrolyzed to
  cysteine in the extracellular space. (Raps et al., ; Hirrlinger et al., ) The intracellular
  availability of cysteine is rate-limiting for GSH synthesis, and the GSH/GSSG-based
  redox status is regulated through a combination of cysteine uptake and transsulfuration
  of HCY. Redox status regulates the SAM/SAH level via its influence on methionine
  synthase. More than 200 methylation reactions are dependent on SAM levels; Key steps
  in mRNA processing are regulated via SAM-dependent methylation. Levels of intracellular
  methionine affect protein synthesis, since it is the required amino acid for initiation
  of translation. (B) An example of a methyltransferase being regulated by redox status
  which affects neuronal plasticity. PRMT is a SAM-dependent methyltransferase which
  methylates the RGG domain of FMRP (a RNABP). FMRP is involved in regulation of about
  400 different mRNA transcripts, including NLGN3 (neuroligin-3), PSD-95 (post synaptic
  density protein-95) and the AMPA-type glutamate receptor. Thus redox status, acting
  via methylation reactions, can control synaptic strength between neurons, thereby
  providing a potential molecular mechanism for Hebbian learning and memory formation.
