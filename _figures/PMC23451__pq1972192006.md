caption: Model of p15/16, cyclin D:Cdk4/6, pRb, E2F pathway. Cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes
  associate with pRbs pocket domain and then proceed to hypo-phosphorylate pRb in
  early G1, and likely throughout the entire cell cycle. Hypo-phosphorylated pRb is
  active and binds to transcription factors, such as E2Fs. The initial hyper-phosphorylating
  inactivator of pRb is likely cyclin E:Cdk2 complexes expressed and activated at
  a position congruent with the passage through the late G1 restriction point. Hyper-phosphorylation
  of pRb results in the dissociation of E2Fs and subsequent activation of E2F-specific
  promoters, such as genes required for DNA synthesis. The presence of unphosphorylated
  pRb in TGF-β-treated wild-type cells and the apparent requirement of cyclin E:cdk
  complexes for prior hypo-phosphorylated pRb as an in vivo substrate () suggests
  that TGF-β signaling drives the cell further into a G0-like state.
