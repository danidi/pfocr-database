caption: 'i.  A detailed overview of tissue factor (TF) dependent (extrinsic) and
  contact activation (intrinsic) coagulation pathway- The coagulation process is an
  intricate process regulated through a series of clotting factors. In TF dependent
  (extrinsic) cascade, the endothelial cells release TF which convert factor VII to
  factor VIIa and subsequently factor VIIa convert factor X into active form of factor
  Xa. On the other hand, the contact activation (intrinsic) coagulation pathway initiates
  with the activation of a zymogen factor XII–XIIa via the participation of kinin–kallikrein
  system in response to endothelial damage. The factor XIIa acts as a catalyst to
  convert factor XI to factor XIa. Further, factor XIa then goes on to convert factor
  IX to factor IXa. Finally, factor IXa turns inactive factor X into active factor
  Xa. Both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway converges at one point which is factor
  Xa and so known as common pathway. The activated factor Xa cleaves prothrombin into
  thrombin by the involvement of factor V. Further, thrombin transforms fibrinogen
  into fibrin by factor XIIIa which in turn form fibrin mesh to stabilize the platelet
  plug. *Antithrombin (AT) prevents coagulation by inhibiting thrombin and factor
  XIIIa. *Plasmin also hinders the formation of stabilized fibrin clot by activating
  the process of fibrinolysis. *The activated protein C (APC) and activated protein
  S (APS) anticoagulant system also act to prevent coagulation, especially by inactivating
  factors V and VIII. ii. Proposed schematic diagram showing underlying mechanism
  of SARS-CoV-2 mediated apoptosis which can modulate coagulation cascade- a SARS-CoV-2
  enters via ACE-2 receptor of endothelial cells and might induce apoptotic stimuli
  by ORF3a SARS-CoV-encoded accessory protein ORF3a. b In endothelial cells, anionic
  phosphatidylserine (PS) is generally sequestered in the cytoplasmic inner leaflet
  of the plasma membrane by ‘flippase’ while external apoptotic response stimulates
  the translocation/exposure of PS from inner to the outer leaflet through lipid transporter
  via ‘scramblase’. c and d Interestingly, translocation of PS to the outer leaflet
  will activate TF (extrinsic) dependent coagulation pathway through conversion of
  inactive factor (FVII) to active form (VIIa) as well as also promote contact activation
  (intrinsic) coagulation pathway via the activation of various zymogen factors (FXII,
  FXI, FIX) to its active forms (XIIa, XIa, IXa) which finally converge at common
  pathway via activation of FX to Xa, prothrombin to thrombin, fibrinogen to fibrin
  and eventually stabilized fibrin clots and thrombus. The dashed arrow ( ) designates
  mechanistic pathway undergo through numerous steps and soild arrow ( ) shows common
  transformations from one active factor to another factor. Green arrow ( ) describes
