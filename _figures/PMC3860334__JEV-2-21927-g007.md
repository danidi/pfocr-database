caption: The different vesicle transport pathways and the functions of Rab GTPases
  identified from the hUCBMSC MVs. Rab proteins found in MVstim were related to deeper
  endosomal route (blue), whereas MVcrtl contained Rab proteins from the rapid loop
  located near the plasma membrane (red). RAB1, which is localized at the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), mediates ER–Golgi trafficking together with RAB2, which might also
  regulate Golgi–ER trafficking. The Golgi-localized RAB6 and RAB34 mediate intra-Golgi
  trafficking. RAB8 mediates constitutive biosynthetic trafficking from the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN) to the plasma membrane. RAB3, and RAB37 regulate the secretory pathway.
  RAB32 is involved in the biogenesis of melanosomes and other lysosome-related organelles
  (LRO) as well as the formation of lipid droplets from the early endosome (EE). RAB18
  controls the formation of lipid droplets from the ER. RAB5 mediates endocytosis
  and endosome fusion of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). RAB11 and RAB35 mediate
  slow endocytic recycling through recycling endosomes, (RE). RAB15 is involved in
  the trafficking from early endosomes (EE) to recycling endosomes. The late endosome-associated
  RAB7 mediates the maturation of late endosomes (LE) and their fusion with lysosomes.
