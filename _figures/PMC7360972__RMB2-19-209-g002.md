caption: Regulation of Cdx2 expression by cell‐cell contacts via Yap nuclear translocation.
  In inner blastomeres, Hippo signaling pathway is activated by cell‐cell interactions
  and prevents the translocation of Yap by phosphorylation. In outer blastomeres,
  Hippo signaling becomes inactive, and Yap is translocated to the nucleus and forms
  a complex with Tead4. The Tead4‐Yap complex induces the expression of Cdx2 and other
  TE genes.
