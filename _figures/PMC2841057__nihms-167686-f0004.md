caption: Aldosterone is synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland in
  response to angiotensin II (Ang II), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), potassium, and
  lipid soluble factor(s) produced in fat tissue ()., The classical genomic pathway
  of aldosterone action involves binding to cytosolic MRs and subsequent translocation
  to the nucleus, gene transcription, and translation of effector proteins involved
  in regulating sodium and potassium balance across renal tubular epithelial cells.,
  Aldosterone also exerts rapid, non-genomic effects that mediate maladaptive tissue
  remodeling throughout the cardiovascular and central nervous system, further perpetuating
  the CMS, insulin resistance, and the hypertensive state. The non-genomic pathways
  of aldosterone are independent of renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and volume
  expansion and utilize rapid activation of the tyrosine kinase signaling and subsequent
  downstream activation of extracellular receptor kinase (ERK1/2), Rho kinase, and
  protein kinase (PKC) in association with increased cytosolic calcium and generation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS).,– The consequences of activating these pathways
  are increased NADPH oxidase activation/ROS generation, mitochondrial electron transport
  uncoupling, and downstream activation of redox-sensitive serine kinases (–).,,,
  As MRs are expressed in numerous tissues, elevated circulating aldosterone levels
  signaling via nongenomic as well as genomic mechanisms result in a number of maladaptive
  tissuespecific effects ().
