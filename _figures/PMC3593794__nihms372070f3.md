caption: 'PAFAH1B1 (platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1 regulatory subnuit
  1, formerly known as LIS1)-binding partners. The binding of PAFAH1B1 (LIS1) to the
  cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin complex is evolutionarily conserved from fungi to mammals.
  Nuclear distribution proteins such as NDE1, NDEL1 and NUDC interact directly with
  PAFAH1B1. PAFAH1B1 itself is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and is localized
  at tubulin/MT-rich subcellular compartments in cells like centrosomes. Other MAPs,
  such as DCX and MTAP1B, are also PAFAH1B1-binding partners. PAFAH1B1 was also identified
  as a non-catalytic subunit of PAFAH and PAFAH1B1 associates with PAFAH catalytic
  subunits such as PAFAH1B2 (PAFAH alpha 2) and PAFAH1B3 (PAFAH alpha 1). When PAFAH1B1
  binds to CLIP1 (CLIP170), a MT plus end protein, it forms a complex with IQGAP1
  and CDC42/RAC1. Through this interaction, PAFAH1B1 participates in F-actin dynamics
  in growth cones during neuronal migration. Interestingly, PAFAH1B1 also binds to
  DAB1, an actin-regulatory protein acting in RELN signaling pathway. PAFAH1B1 has
  dual roles in distinct regulatory pathways of MT and actin cytoskeletons. (Blue
  proteins: MT regulators, red proteins: actin regulators, green proteins: Unclear
  detailed function in MT/actin regulation)'
