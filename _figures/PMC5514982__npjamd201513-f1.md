caption: Caloric restriction, exercise and AdipoR pathway activate AMPK–SIRT1 and
  PPAR pathways, which may increase longevity in humans. Genetic studies using yeasts,
  worms and flies suggest that AMPK and SIRT1 pathways are implicated at the molecular
  level as signaling pathways that contribute to longevity through caloric restriction.
  SIRT1 deacetylates and activates transcription factor Foxo1 thus reducing stress
  responses, whereas AMPK prolongs lifespan by suppressing serine/threonine kinase
  mTOR, which regulates protein synthesis and cell cycle. In humans as well, adiponectin/AdipoR
  signaling is shown to activate the AMPK–SIRT1 pathway as well as to positively regulate
  the PPAR pathway thus alleviating oxidative stress in organs. Increased activation
  of adiponectin and AdipoRs pathways like exercise may have beneficial effects on
  healthy longevity and obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
  diseases (CVD) and cancers.
