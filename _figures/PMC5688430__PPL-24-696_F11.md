caption: A) Combined use of potato α-glucan phosphorylase (αGP) and glycogen branching
  enzyme (GBE) from Deinococcus geothermalis for the generation of hyperbranched polysaccharides
  on silicon wafer []. (a) Oxidized Si wafer; (b) aminosilanized wafer; (c) maltoheptaose
  functionalised surface; (d) enzyme-catalysed growth of linear chain by αGP; (e)
  catalytic action of GBE; (f) resulting hyperbranched polysaccharide after the combined
  biocatalysis. B) Metabolic pathways associated with α-glucan and glycogen metabolism
  in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [, ]. The genes involved in the GlgE pathway are underlined.
  The pathway is negatively regulated by the serine/threonine kinase, PknB. The pathway
  has been exploited for generation of branched glycans using a combination of the
  GlgE and GlgB enzymes.
