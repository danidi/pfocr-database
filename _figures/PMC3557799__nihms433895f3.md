caption: Aside from the interaction of TMDs with Get3, we have no molecular information
  on modes of binding between proteins in this pathway. Schematic representations
  should therefore be interpreted as binding events between the pictured proteins
  rather than specific regions thereof. Potential nucleotide binding/hydrolysis steps
  are indicated; a detailed description of the possible ways in which the nucleotide
  cycle couples to TA-protein insertion into membranes can be found in the body of
  the text.
