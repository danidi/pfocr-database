caption: Interacting partners and posttranslational modification of Orai1 and STIM1.
  (A) Schematic of Orai1. Orai1 has four transmembrane segments (TM1-TM4). It has
  two extracellular domains and the second extracellular domain between TM3 and TM4
  contains the asparagine (N223) residue involved in glycosylation (indicated in blue).
  The TM1 lines the pore and the residues in TM1 involved in Ca2+ selectivity and
  gating are depicted. The TM3 does not line the pore, but affects ion selectivity
  by possible interaction with TM1. Subunits of Orai1 form CRAC channels, but the
  molecular stoichiometry of CRAC channels is still in question. Schematic depicts
  a dimeric form for convenience of drawing. Orai1 contains three intracellular domains
  including the N terminus (N-CC), intracellular loop (IC-LOOP), and C-terminal coiled-coil
  domain (C-CC) that are important for protein interactions and channel activation/inactivation.
  Known molecular interactors of Orai1 in these intracellular domains are summarized.
  The N terminus of Orai1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC). (B) Schematic
  of STIM1. STIM1 contains Ca2+-binding EF hands and a sterile α motif (SAM) domain
  in the ER-luminal region, a single transmembrane segment, and a long cytoplasmic
  region. The cytoplasmic region has three coiled-coil domains, serine/proline-rich
  domain, and a polybasic segment at the C terminus. Proteins associating with each
  of these domains are indicated. The fragment of STIM1 (340-450) involved in Orai1
  interaction/gating is indicated. Golli proteins interact with the cytoplasmic region
  of STIM1, but the detailed interaction domain is not determined (dotted line). Residues
  phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclin-dependent
  kinase (CDK1) are indicated.
