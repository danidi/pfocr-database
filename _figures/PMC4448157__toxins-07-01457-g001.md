caption: Ceramide 1-phosphate production by sphingomyelinase activities. C1P can be
  generated directly by the action of SMase D acting on SM. This pathway may not exist
  in mammalian cells. C1P can be indirectly synthesized by the action of C-type sphingomyelinase
  activities, which generate ceramide, in combination with ceramide kinase (CerK)
  activity. This is a major pathway for C1P formation in mammalian cells. C1P can
  also be synthesized from ceramide produced by de novo synthesis, which is another
  major pathway for synthesis of C1P in mammalian cells. SMase, sphingomyelinase;
  SphK, sphingosine kinase; CerS, ceramide synthase.
