caption: HIF-1α and HIF-2α have different functions in the cartilage. In the articular
  chondrocytes in the synovial joint, HIF-1α promotes homeostatic pathways, and HIF-2α
  promotes degradative pathways that foster osteoarthritis. The articular cartilage
  resides in hypoxic, avascular conditions within the synovial joint (left). Chondrocytes,
  cells of the articular cartilage, are affected by various forms of stress (biomechanical,
  inflammatory and aging), as well as the loss of synovial fluid boundary lubricants
  and the increase of certain factors released from subchondral bone and synovium.
  Four studies published in Nature Medicine have provided details for the emerging
  chondrocyte-centered osteoarthritis model depicted here–. Within the normal, unstressed
  chrondocyte (HIF-1α pathway), the hypoxic response transcription factor HIF-1α supports
  normal cartilage extracellular matrix synthesis and chondrocyte differentiation
  and promotes autophagy—all central activities in articular cartilage homeostasis.
  These effects of HIF-1α are antagonized by the closely related HIF-2α (HIF-2α pathway).
  HIF-2α promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy, a terminal differentiation state characterized
  by a unique gene expression program, including type X collagen and the type II collagen–degrading
  protease MMP-13. This switch to hypertrophy seems to be a relatively early signal
  to ignite and drive osteoarthritis in stressed cartilage. The preferential heterodimerization
  of HIF-2α with ARNTL creates the most potent set of partners for inducing chondrocyte
  hypertrophy. HIF-2α promotes hypertrophy, and complementary mechanisms (via IHH
  and RUNX2) stimulate increased expression of the major matrix-degrading protease
  ADAMTS5. The transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-4 (acting in part
  by inducing MMP-3 expression) stimulates activation of ADAMTS5 in hypertrophic chondrocytes.
  Inhibitors of ADAMTS5 and MMP-13 are already in clinical development. The model
  depicted here opens the door to additional, compelling strategies for potential
  disease modification in human osteoarthritis, such as suppressing the activity of
  HIF-2α, inhibiting the development of articular chondrocyte hypertrophy or targeting
  syndecan-4.
