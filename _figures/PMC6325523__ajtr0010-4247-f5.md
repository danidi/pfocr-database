caption: Schematic showing the role of H2S in endometriosis. Endometrial stromal cells
  (ESCs) from ectopic tissue of patients with endometriosis express high levels of
  cystathionine β-synthetase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), which catalyze
  cysteine into H2S. Endogenous or exogenous H2S activates the NF-κB signaling pathway,
  then enhances the survival and proliferation of ESCs, and finally promotes the progression
  of endometriosis. These effects can be reversed by aminooxyacetate (AOAA) and D,
  L-propargylglycine (PAG), inhibitors of CBS and CSE, respectively.
