caption: 'Model for Sulf regulation of Wnt signaling. The model of Ai et al. [] proposes
  that Wnt ligands are sequestered away from signal transduction receptors (Frizzled’s)
  because of an association with HSPGs on the cell surface or ECM. The removal of
  6-O-S (denoted in the solid color with the other S modifications denoted in white)
  from heparan sulfate chains by the action of the Sulf weaken the association of
  the Wnt ligand with the HSPG, which permits engagement of the Frizzled receptor.
  This initiates a chain of cytoplasmic events which leads to the accumulation of
  β-catenin in the nucleus of the cell and culminates in the activation of a set of
  “Wnt target genes” (“canonical Wnt signaling pathway”). The Sulfs, on the hand,
  can negatively regulate other signaling pathways. For example, the Sulfs inhibit
  FGF-2 mediated signaling by apparently disrupting ternary signaling complexes, consisting
  of FGF-2, an HSPG, and the FGF-2 receptor, FGFR1 []. A diagram depicting the negative
  the effect of a Sulf on FGF-2 signaling is provided in []. The Sulf is shown in
  forms: bound to the plasma membrane and as a soluble secreted protein.'
