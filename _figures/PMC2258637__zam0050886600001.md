caption: Proposed pathway for metabolism of glycolate and glyoxylate by Moorella sp.
  strain HUC22-1, showing a scheme proposed by Friedrich and Schink slightly modified
  from reference  with permission from Blackwell Publishing. 1, malyl-CoA lyase (EC
  4.1.3.24); 2, malyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.9); 3, malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40);
  4, pyruvate synthase (EC 1.2.7.1). Fdox, oxidized ferredoxin; Fdred, reduced ferredoxin;
  X, unidentified electron acceptor.
