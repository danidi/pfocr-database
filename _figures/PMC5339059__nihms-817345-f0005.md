caption: Major and minor metabolic routes of ginsenoside Rb1 (; ). Compound K, a major
  metabolite of ginsenoside Rb1, can be further biotransformed to protopanaxadiol
  (PPD) or possibly other compounds. Ginsenoside Rh2, including both 20S- and 20R-
  stereoisomeric forms, was detected in feces samples as a minor metabolite via another
  metabolic pathway from ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg3.
