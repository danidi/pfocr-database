caption: Identity checks in β-cell involving IRS-1 and KATP triggering pathway. Based
  on the model suggested by Swisa et al. (, , ), the scheme summarizes possible existence
  of H2O2-mediated self-checking of the β-cell identity by its proper GSIS function
  under which cytosolic H2O2 formation is probably elevated. The elevated H2O2 substantiates
  redox signaling, which by yet unknown means provides benefits to β-cell “well-being.”
  The “wrong” or “incorrect” signal is obtained if the impaired GSIS or other β-cell
  functions stop such a redox signaling. These benefits may be obtained in parallel
  by a putative autocrine insulin, autocrine IGF, and paracrine and endocrine GLP-1
  (GIP) signaling. Insulin and IGF signaling meets at the IRS signaling promoting
  transcription and translation of Pax6, a master factor, which further stimulates
  the expression of the β-cell identity genes (Pdx, MafA, Nkx6.1), which consequently
  maintain proper function of β-cell, especially intact expression of preproinsulin
  gene and proteins of insulin granules. GIP, gastric inhibitory polypeptide; GLP-1,
  glucagon-like peptide 1; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor
  substrate; Pdx, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox.
