caption: Apoptosis in mammalian cells is mediated through the intrinsic and extrinsic
  pathways. The intrinsic pathway is predominantly regulated by the Bcl-2 family and
  mitochondria. The extrinsic pathway is engaged upon binding of proapoptotic ligands,
  such as TRAILor Fas to their respective death receptors on the cell surface. Apoptosis
  initiation is regulated by transcription as well as the cross-talk of two apoptotic
  pathways via Bid. Apoptosis is activated by anticancer agents, such as radiation,
  chemotherapy, kinase inhibitors, BH3 or Smac mimetics, and chemopreventive agents
  acting on both pathways and various players, to trigger a caspase activation cascade.
  Inhibition of apoptosis or certain caspases such as caspase-8 can lead to increased
  autophagy or necrosis, providing additional targets for drug development. Antiapoptotic
  proteins are colored in green while proapoptotic proteins are colored in red. Cyto
  c, cytochrome c.
