caption: We propose that leaky mdx muscle fibers are able to maintain near normal
  creatine concentrations by synthesizing creatine de novo through up-regulation of
  both GAMT and AGAT. Our data shows that creatine levels are similar in the serum
  and muscle homogenates of both mdx and control mice. The up-regulation of GAMT and
  AGAT for de novo synthesis of creatine would allow for discrete mdx metabolic adaptations
  to offset leaky membranes and excess loss of intracellular creatine. Limiting energy
  failure in muscle cells, mdx mice may be divergent in a unique metabolic adaptation
  compared to muscles from boys with DMD. Further studies including human analysis
  are warranted.
