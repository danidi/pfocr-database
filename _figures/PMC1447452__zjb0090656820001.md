caption: Organization of the hyu genes (A) and predicted salvage and dissimilation
  pathway of 5-substituted benzyl and indolylmethyl hydantoins (B) in M. liquefaciens
  AJ 3912. (A) The genes and their transcriptional orientation are symbolized by arrows.
  Encoded proteins are the hydantoin transporter (hyuP), hydantoin racemase (hyuA),
  hydantoinase (hyuH), and N-carbamoylase (hyuC). (B) The predicted functions of proteins
  encoded by hyu genes and their roles in the dissimilation pathway of 5-substituted
  hydantoins in M. liquefaciens AJ 3912 are illustrated. The metabolic pathways may
  accept a wide range of 5-substituents, but the specificities of the transporter
  for benzyl and indolyl groups are illustrated, leading to the synthesis of l-phenylalanine
  and l-tryptophan.
