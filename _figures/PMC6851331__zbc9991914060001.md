caption: Producing natural products in plants through synthetic biology and primary
  metabolic pathway engineering. A, Tremendous chemical diversity has evolved in different
  plant lineages (left). The underlying specialized metabolic pathways can be identified
  and reconstructed in a heterologous host, or chassis, through synthetic biology
  (green, right) for efficient production of target compounds (e.g. nutraceuticals,
  pharmaceuticals, and bio-based materials). Additionally, the upstream primary metabolic
  pathways can be engineered in the host to optimize the supply of a specific precursor(s)
  (blue, right). B, Besides microbial hosts, plants can provide alternative chassis
  to produce natural plant products in sustainable and potentially efficient manners,
  if their pros and cons (table) are carefully evaluated and addressed. See Appendix
  S1 for image credits.
