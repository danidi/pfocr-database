caption: 'Intracellular carbon flux distributions with corresponding standard deviations
  of the central metabolism of the wild type C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (in bold) and
  mutant strains C. glutamicum Δpgi, C. glutamicum ΔpurA ΔguaB2 and C. glutamicum
  ΔpurA ΔguaB2 purF K348QΔpgi (displayed in that order from top to bottom). Net fluxes
  are given as molar percentage of the mean specific glucose uptake rates (4.67 mmol
  g-1 h-1 for C. glutamicum ATCC 13032; 4.18 mmol g-1 h-1 for C. glutamicum Δpgi;
  4.24 mmol g-1 h-1 for C. glutamicum ΔpurA ΔguaB2; 1.92 mmol g-1 h-1 for C. glutamicum
  ΔpurA ΔguaB2 purFK348QΔpgi), which were set to 100%. Anabolic fluxes leading towards
  biomass formation were not displayed for the benefit of lucidity. Anabolic demands
  for auxtrophic mutant strains C. glutamicum ΔpurA ΔguaB2 and C. glutamicum ΔpurA
  ΔguaB2 purFK348QΔpgi were corrected for the supplementation of adenine and guanine.
