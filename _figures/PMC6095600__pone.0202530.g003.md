caption: 'Upstream regulators of up- and down-regulated orthologous genes were determined
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The experimentally observed gene expression tendencies
  are shown by the bottom line of nodes of the graphs (red increased, green decreased
  expression), while the networks above these genes displays the predicted regulatory
  networks might be responsible for the detected transcription effect. Orange color
  in the regulatory network indicates positive and blue color indicates negative regulatory
  effects. Marks on the graph edges shows the type of functional interactions (E:
  expression, LO: localization, A: activation, TR: translocation, T: transcription,
  RB: regulation of binding, PD: protein-DNA binding, P: phosphorylation) and the
  number of the supporting evidences in Ingenuity Knowledge Base.'
