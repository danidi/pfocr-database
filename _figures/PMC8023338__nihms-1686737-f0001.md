caption: Damage to the blood–brain barrier (BBB) might enable neuropathic antibodies
  in the serum of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to enter the central
  nervous system (CNS); however, several other interfaces could also serve as sites
  of leukocyte and pathogenic antibody transfer into the CNS. a | The arachnoid epithelium
  serves as the meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid
  space and the blood in cerebral veins. Meningitis (both aseptic and infectious)
  can cause inflammation in the subarachnoid space, potentially leading to a breach
  of this barrier that enables circulating pathogenic antibodies, leukocytes and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines to enter into the CSF. b | The glymphatic pathway is a perivascular pseudolymphatic
  system that provides a conduit for interstitial fluid in the brain parenchyma. Brain
  antigens (such as microtubule-associated protein 2) might be recognized by indwelling
  antigen-presenting cells in the perivascular space, which can migrate to the cervical
  lymph nodes and initiate an adaptive response. c | Breach of the BBB has been observed
  under several circumstances, including infection (simulated by lipopolysaccharide
  administration), stress (simulated by adrenaline infusion), the mechanical and inflammatory
  sequelae of vascular occlusion and antibody-mediated endothelial cell activation.
  d | The fenestrated capillary plexus within the choroid plexus enables ready access
  of antibodies and leukocytes to the choroidal plexus stroma (a previously characterized
  site of immunosurveillance) and potentially into the CSF. AQP4, aquaporin 4.
