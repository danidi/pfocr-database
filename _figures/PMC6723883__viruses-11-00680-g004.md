caption: (A) model of CFHR1-3 participation in Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV) infection
  response. In white is the patient’s complement pathway response to ANDV infection.
  In grey is the proposed effect caused by the CFHR genes’ deletion. (B) model of
  SIRPB1 in ANDV infection response. In white is the neutrophil response to ANDV infection.
  In grey is the proposed effect caused by SIRPB1 deletion.
