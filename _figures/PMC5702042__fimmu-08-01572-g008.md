caption: Suggested model of activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by Fonsecaea pedrosoi
  hyphae in macrophages. F. pedrosoi hyphae induce macrophage priming by a canonical
  Syk-NF-kB signaling pathway coupled to dectin-1, dectin-2, and dectin-3 recognition
  of the fungus. This leads to NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18 production. Then, the
  NLRP3-inflammasome is activated as a result of potassium efflux, phagolysosome acidification,
  cathepsin B release, and ROS production, which subsequently leads to IL-1β and IL-18
  processing and secretion by caspase-1 and caspase-8 dependent cleavage.
