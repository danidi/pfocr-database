caption: Modulation of PGE2 by pathogenic bacteria. PGE2synthesis is initiated by
  the release of AA from the lipid cell membrane by the enzyme cPLA2. Either COX-1
  (constitutively expressed) or COX-2 (inducible) can utilize AA as a substrate to
  produce the precursor PGH2. PGH2 is converted to biologically active PGE2 by means
  of the enzyme PGE2 synthase. PGE2 can then readily signal through one of four EP,
  denoted EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. Various pathogens influence PGE2 production and
  signaling along different steps of this pathway. Green arrows indicate activation
  of COX-2 or PGES, while red lines indicate inhibition of COX-2 or PGES by select
  pathogens. Blue lines indicate a potential role for EP signaling in pathogen survival.
