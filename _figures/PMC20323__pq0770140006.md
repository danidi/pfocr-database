caption: Outline of TOR/FRAP pathways. Extracellular signals pass through the Tor
  and FRAP proteins, suppressing quiescence or meiosis and promoting cell cycle progression.
  The pathway can also be activated with cell-permeable RNA ligands that inhibit protein
  synthesis, a process reminiscent of the activation of the Mec1p-mediated pathway
  by cell-permeable DNA ligands or by inhibitors of DNA synthesis ().
