caption: (A) Binding of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) with TNF receptor activates
  the receptor, which recruits TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD). TRADD
  can recruit several binding partners, including shown in . Receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP)
  are involved in different downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB activation,
  apoptosis, and necroptosis. TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF 2) binds to its cytoplasmic
  death domain. TRADD has several protein-binding partners and participates in different
  signaling pathways, including NF-κB, apoptosis, necrosis, and mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinase activation. The N-terminal domain of TRADD interacts with the
  C-terminal domain of TRAF2 and recruits TRAF2 to TNFR1 for activation of the NF-κB
  pathway. E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1/cIAP2 polyubiquitinate (Ub–Ub) RIP1 that promotes
  the recruitment of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK) complex and
  TAK1, for NF-κB activation. In the absence of cIAP1 or deubiquitination of RIPK1
  by cylindromatosis (CYLD), a K63-specific deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) mediates
  the deubiquitination of RIP1 to facilitate the formation of complex II (IIa and
  Iib), which is dissociated from the receptor when TNFR is internalized. cFLIP, RIP1,
  FADD, and caspase-8 form cytosolic complex IIa to activate the caspase cascade and
  induce apoptosis. Active caspase 8 also cleaves and inactivates RIPK1 and RIPK2.
  When a caspase-8 activity is compromised by cFLIPs, vFLIP, or zVAD fmk, RIPK1 interacts
  with RIPK3 in a “necrosome” complex. RIP3 upon activation phosphorylates MLKL, and
  this promotes oligomerization of MLKL, resulting in its insertion in the plasma
  membrane to execute necroptosis. (B) Molecular interactions between necroptosis
  and autophagy show the involvement of cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1β converting
  enzyme) inhibitory protein (cFLIP), caspase-8, and Atg3. cFLIPs promotes necrosome
  assembly and subsequent necroptosis by inhibiting caspase-8; cFLIPL prevents its
  assembly by activation of caspase 8 that cleave RIP1 in the complex. cFLIPL can
  suppress autophagy by preventing Atg3 from converting LC3 to LC3-II.
