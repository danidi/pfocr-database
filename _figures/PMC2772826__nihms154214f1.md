caption: Activation of caspase 3 and caspase-dependent apoptosis are caused by the
  initiator caspases, caspase 8 and caspase 9, as part of the extrinsic and intrinsic
  apoptotic signalling pathways, or by granzyme B. In the extrinsic pathway, death
  ligands, including Fas Ligand (FasL), bind and activate their cognate receptors
  (Fas). Activated receptors, an adaptor molecule, such as Fas-associated death domain
  protein (FADD), and pro-caspase 8 then form a death-inducing signalling complex
  (DISC) in which caspase 8 is activated. Caspase 8 can activate caspase 3 and can
  cleave the BH3-only protein BCL-2 interacting domain death agonist (BID), forming
  truncated BID (tBID), which can activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In the
  intrinsic apoptotic pathway, pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members
  BCL-2 associated × protein (BAX) and BCL-2 antagonist killer 1 (BAK1) form pores
  in the mitochondrial membrane. Pro-apoptotic mitochondrial factors, including DIABLO
  (direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein-binding protein with low pI; also known as
  SMAC) and cytochrome c, are released and contribute to apoptosis by activating caspase
  9 or inhibiting cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Granzyme B can
  directly cleave and activate pro-caspase 3. Granzyme B can also cleave BID, resulting
  in granzyme tBID, which can activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. cFLIP (cellular
  FLIP/caspase 8 inhibitor protein) can block the activation of caspase 8. Bcl-xL,
  BCL-extra large.
