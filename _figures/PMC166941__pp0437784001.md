caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of the Asp-derived amino acids in plants. Met synthesis
  comprises two biosynthetic domains: the reductive sulfur assimilation (leading to
  Cys biosynthesis) and one branch of the Asp amino acid family biosynthetic pathway.
  Dashed lines represent parts of the pathway in which detailed descriptions of the
  enzymatic steps have been omitted. Pathways are shown along with their subcellular
  compartmentation. CbL, Cystathionine β-lyase; MS, Met synthase; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomo-Cys.'
