caption: A Model for the Differential Regulation of Signal Pathway Genes and Defensive
  Genes in Leaves of Tomato Plants in Response to Wounding and Systemin.In this model,
  JA activates the signal pathway genes (early genes) in the vascular bundles, whereas
  H2O2, produced by cell wall–derived oligogalacturonides released by PG is a second
  messenger that activates defense genes (late genes) in mesophyll cells. DPI, diphenyl
  iodinium chloride; PG, polygalacturonase; PIs, proteinase inhibitors; PM, plasma
  membrane; PPO, polyphenol oxidase; R, receptor.
