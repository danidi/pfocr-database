caption: An illustration of two pathways for GABA synthesis from glutamine. The bold
  arrow illustrates the predominant pathway where the carbon skeleton of glutamine
  is metabolized via the TCA cycle prior to synthesis of GABA. The thin arrow illustrates
  the direct synthesis of GABA from glutamine without involvement of the TCA cycle.
  Note that AAT is present in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. αKG,
  α-ketoglutarate; PAG, phosphate-activated glutaminase; ATT, aspartate aminotransferase;
  GAD, glutamate decarboxylase.
