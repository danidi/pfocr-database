caption: At GABAergic NMJs (left), binding of axon-derived MADD-4S, neurexin NRX-1,
  or both, to neuroligin NLG-1 on muscle triggers postsynaptic clustering of GABAARs
  in a PDZ binding motif-dependent manner (solid arrows). MADD-4S or MADD-4L binding
  to UNC-40/DCC on muscle also stabilizes GABAARs through an unknown signaling pathway
  (dashed arrows). At cholinergic NMJs (right), MADD-4L is required for the proper
  synaptic localization of N-AChRs and of an L-AChR-LEV9-LEV10 complex (solid arrows).
  There may be additional interactions between MADD-4 and presynaptic NLG-1 (gray
  arrows) and roles for NRX-1 if it is also expressed at cholinergic presynaptic sites.
