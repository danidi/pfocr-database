caption: Signaling pathway in sea urchin sperm. (A) The guanylate cyclase (GC) serves
  as the receptor for the chemoattractant resact. Resact binding activates the GC,
  resulting in cGMP synthesis. cGMP activates the K+-selective cyclic nucleotide-gated
  channel (CNGK). Opening of CNGK hyperpolarizes the cell and activates a hyperpolarization-activated
  and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel and a sperm-specific voltage-dependent
  Na+/H+ exchanger (sNHE). Opening of HCN channels restores the resting potential,
  whereas activation of sNHE increases the intracellular pH. Both events activate
  the principal Ca2+ channel CatSper, leading to a Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+ levels are
  restored by Ca2+ extrusion through a Na+/Ca2+/K+ exchanger (NCKX) and a Ca2+ ATPase
  PMCA, whereas cGMP is hydrolyzed by a phosphodiesterase (PDE). On resact binding,
  sea urchin sperm not only synthesize cGMP, but also cAMP, probably through activation
  of the soluble adenylate cyclase (SACY), which, at least in mouse sperm, forms a
  complex with sNHE. One known target for cAMP is the HCN channel, whose voltage-dependent
  opening is modulated by cAMP. (B) Schematic distribution of GC receptors and CNGK
  channel on the flagellum. The GC (gray) and CNGK (green) densities are drawn to
  scale (ratio GC dimer/CNGK is 10:1). The cGMP gradient is depicted in shades of
  magenta.
