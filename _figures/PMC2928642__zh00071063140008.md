caption: Model for the PA-mediated activation of mTORC1 signaling. PA is hydrolyzed
  by phospholipase A (PLA), and resulting LPA activates the endothelial differentiation
  gene (EDG-2) receptor. Activation of the EDG-2 receptor results in upregulated signaling
  through the MEK-ERK pathway via 2 distinct mechanisms. One mechanism involves a
  G protein-mediated increase in PLD activity, leading to hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) to choline and PA. PA then binds to Raf, allowing for activation of the ERK
  cascade. The second mechanism involves G proteins acting through Ras to activate
  the MEK-ERK pathway. Subsequently, ERK acts to inhibit tuberous sclerosis complex
  (TSC1/2), thereby increasing GTP loading on Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb)
  and, thus, upregulating mTORC1 activation. mTORC1 then phosphorylates downstream
  targets, such as S6K1 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1),
  ultimately leading to increased mRNA translation. Leucine also activates mTORC1,
  although the mechanism involved in the effect is not understood.
