caption: β-Cells require exquisite regulation of protein synthesis by eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2 α-subunit (eIF2α) phosphorylation. Our studies have shown that protein
  kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activation initiates a cascade of
  events that include eIF2α phosphorylation, increased ATF4 mRNA translation and transcriptional
  activation of CHOP. Increased CHOP expression is associated with oxidative stress.
  However, we have also shown that a defect in eIF2α phosphorylation results in increased
  protein synthesis that also leads to oxidative stress. We propose that increased
  CHOP expression induces expression of GADD34 to direct protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated
  dephosphorylation of eIF2α, thereby increasing protein synthesis. If protein misfolding
  is not resolved, the increased cargo would further increase misfolded protein accumulation,
  leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The heavy black arrows depict the signalling
  pathway that occurs upon eIF2α phosphorylation.
