caption: Differential regulation and effects of glycolysis induction in GM-DCs upon
  stimulation over time. Resting GM-DCs (top) display a basal metabolism with active
  AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and fatty acids, glutamine, glycogen, and glucose
  being fully oxidized to generate energy by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Upon
  early stimulation after 6–9 h, GM-DCs are activated and exhibit transiently enhanced
  OXPHOS/mitochondrial membrane potential and an increased glycolytic metabolism mainly
  using glucose from intracellular glycogen stores. The induction of glycolysis is
  predominantly driven by a TBK1-IKKε/AKT/HK-II axis and largely devoted to fatty
  acid synthesis (FAS). Moreover, enhanced early glycolytic activity of GM-DCs is
  vital for their migration and upregulation of co-stimulatory/inhibitory molecules
  as well as cytokines. At later time points about 18–48 h after robust stimulation,
  a mTOR/HIF1α/iNOS axis is activated in GM-DCs, leading to enforced glycolysis via
  upregulation of glucose importers such as GLUT1 and inhibition of OXPHOS via nitric
  oxide (NO). This fostered glycolytic activity appears crucial for the interaction
  of GM-DCs with T cells. Nevertheless, the sustained inhibition of OXPHOS by NO and
  reliance on glycolysis for energy generation can reduce the ability of GM-DCs to
  stimulate T cells in the long term. Glucose deprivation or mTOR inhibition can preserve
  metabolic flexibility and functional OXPHOS in GM-DCs, sustaining their activity
  at least during 72–96 h and extending their life span. AKT, protein kinase B; CCR7,

  description: Differential regulation and effects of glycolysis induction in GM-DCs
    upon stimulation over time. Resting GM-DCs (top) display a basal metabolism with
