caption: The human pathway of assembly of lipoyl moieties on its cognate proteins.
  LIPT2 utilizes octanoyl-ACP synthesized by the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis
  system to modify GCSH. The reaction proceeds via a LIPT2 acyl enzyme intermediate
  as shown. The octanoyl-GCSH is then converted to lipoyl-GCSH by LIAS catalyzed sulfur
  insertion. LIPT1 then transfers the lipoyl moiety from GCSH to form an acyl enzyme
  intermediate. This in turn is attacked by a specific lysine reside of the lipoyl
  domain (LD) of the N-termini of the E2 subunits of the dehydrogenases or GCSH to
  give the active modified enzymes.
