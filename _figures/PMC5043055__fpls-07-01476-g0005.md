caption: 'Pathways leading to lignin and heteroxylan in maize pericarp at stage R3.
  Enzymes and intermediate compounds are depicted. The thickness of the arrows represents
  the expression level of the genes known or proposed to carry out the activity in
  maize pericarp, while a cross means no expression. Dashed lines represent the proposed
  pathway but with no experimental evidence or unknown enzymes. PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase; TAL, tyrosine ammonia lyase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCoAOMT,
  caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase; CAD cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; C3H,
  p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase;
  CSE, Caffeoyl shikimate esterase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; PER: peroxidase;
  Lacc, laccase; XT, xylosyl transferase; XAT, xylan arabinosyltransferase; XAX, xylan
  xylosyltransferase; GUX, glucuronyltransferase; Tase, transferase; FT, feruloyltransferase;
  FA, ferulate; diFA, diferulate.'
