caption: Signaling of normal root growth may involve GALT2/GALT5-dependent glycosylation
  of SOS5 and glycosylated SOS5 binding FEI1/FEI2, possibly inducing dimer formation
  and activation of the kinase domain as well as allowing for the binding of FEI1/FEI2
  to ACC synthase. Such binding will inhibit the production of ACC, a potential signaling
  molecule and ethylene precursor, which directly or indirectly inhibits cellulose
  synthase/cellulose biosynthesis independent of ethylene. In contrast, when GALT2/GALT5-dependent
  SOS5 glycosylation is inhibited or SOS5 is mutated or FEI1/FEI2 is mutated, ACC
  synthase can no longer bind to FEI. Consequently, unbound ACC synthase produces
  ACC, which inhibits cellulose synthesis as well as leads to the production of ethylene.
