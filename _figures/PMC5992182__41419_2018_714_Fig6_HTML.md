caption: A novel signaling pathway ERK-Snail1-CYLD-RIPK1-NF-κB contributes to resistance
  of melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitors. In brief, aberrant activation of ERK1/2 in
  melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors downregulates the transcription of CYLD
  via Snail1, which is a transcription repressor of CYLD. Consequentially, suppression
  of CYLD sustains cIAP-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP1, thus leading to
  activation of NF-κB and subsequent protection of melanoma cells from BRAF inhibitor-induced
  killing
