caption: DNA damage and maintenance. Genomic lesions produced by various DNA damaging
  agents trigger several specific repair machinery to conserve the genomic integrity.
  In case of severe damage and/or failure of repair mechanisms, cells undergo apoptosis
  or induce a complex series of phenotypic changes, that is, SOS response. Sometimes
  the potentiality of lesions in the genome is mitigated by a phenomenon known as
  damage tolerance, during which DNA lesions are recognized by certain repair machinery,
  allowing the cells to undergo normal replication and gene expression. The cellular
  response to DNA damage may activate cell-cycle checkpoint by means of a network
  of signaling pathway that gives the cell extra time to repair the genomic lesions
  or may induce cell suicide response/programmed cell death (PCD).
