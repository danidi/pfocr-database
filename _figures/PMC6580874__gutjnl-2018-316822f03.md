caption: Simplified schematic of the PI3K pathway, which highlights the common targets
  for small molecule inhibitors. Briefly, signalling from growth factors activates
  RTKs and recruits PI3K and other scaffold proteins to the cell membrane, where PIP2
  is converted to PIP3. This recruits phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and
  Akt to the membrane and leads to downstream signalling through the kinase activities
  of Akt. (1) Single-strand break repair is regulated primarily by PARP and inhibition
  of PARP can lead to genomic instability. (2) Double-stranded break repair is primarily
  regulated by a complex with BRCA2, which is lost in familial pancreatic cancer and
  some PDAC cases and can lead to genomic instability. Genomically unstable tumours
  require the PI3K pathway to maintain survival pathways and PI3K pathway inhibition
  may be an emerging option for patients with BRCA2 mutations or in combination with
  PARP inhibitors. More exhaustive pathway maps can be found in refs . P13K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases.
