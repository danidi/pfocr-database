caption: The three critical network reactions are highlighted in red. Although there
  were over forty reactions in the ROS production pathway, most were associated with
  the TLR-induced activation of various phox proteins by the protein kinases PDK1
  and PKCz. However, because PDK1 and PKCz work in parallel, none of these reactions
  could control the flux through the entire pathway, and therefore were not critical
  network reactions. On the other hand, the three critical network reactions Vav1-Rac1/GDP
  binding, Rac1 phosphorylation, and gp91-p22 binding, produced the two other components
  that comprised the final phox protein complex, and were therefore critical to the
  overall output ROS production. Note also that these critical network reactions were
  localized to the ROS production pathway and did not interfere with other cellular
  processes. Thus, they represent ideal targets for mediation of TLR-induced ROS production.
