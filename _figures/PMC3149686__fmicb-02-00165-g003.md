caption: Acetate assimilation pathways. Three acetate assimilation pathways, the (oxidative)
  glyoxylate cycle (A), the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate synthase (B) and the ethylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway (C), are shown. All of the acetate assimilation pathways may directly or
  indirectly synthesize oxaloacetate. The CO2 assimilation steps in the pathway/cycle
  are shown in bold and colored red. Different ethylmalonyl-CoA pathways have been
  reported in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 [(C), left] and Rhodobacter sphaeroides
  [(C), right].
