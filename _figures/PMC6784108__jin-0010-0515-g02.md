caption: PolyI:C enhances IgA production in the NALT via the TLR3-TICAM1 pathway.
  After the intranasal administration of an HA vaccine and polyI:C, CD103+ DCs incorporate
  polyI:C and are activated through the TLR3-TICAM1 pathway. CD103+ DCs express BAFF
  and APRIL to activate B cells. PolyI:C also induces Th2-type cytokines, including
  IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, in a TLR3-dependent manner. Furthermore, polyI:C enhances
  the formation of germinal centers and the expression of the Aicda gene, coding AID
  protein. Th2-type cytokines and TGF-β signaling promote IgA class switching in the
  NALT. The secretory IgA produced is secreted to the nasal mucosa through the polymeric
  immunoglobulin receptor expressed on epithelial cells in the NALT. AID, activation-induced
  cytidine deaminase; BAFF, B-cell-activating factor; DC, dendritic cell; HA, hemagglutinin;
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; TLR, toll-like receptor.
