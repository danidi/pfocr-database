caption: 'Contribution of the Rho–ROCK signaling pathway and BMPER to high glucose-induced
  ALP activation in HCASMCs. There are at least two independent pathways in high glucose-induced
  ALP activation in HCASMCs: the Rho–ROCK signaling pathway and the BMPER-dependent
  pathway.'

papertitle: Involvement of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and bone morphogenetic
  protein-binding endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER) in high glucose-increased
  alkaline phosphatase expression and activity in human coronary artery smooth muscle
  cells.
