caption: Molecular networks involved in the photoperiodic control of growth cessation
  and bud set in poplar. Long days (LDs) promote the expression of FT via CO. The
  downstream target of FT is LAP1, which in turn controls AIL1. AIL1 regulates the
  expression of core cell regulatory genes, e.g. D-type cyclins, that are involved
  in the control of cell division. These D-cyclins promote the division of meristematic
  cells in the apex, which results in active apical growth. The perception of SDs
  inhibits FT expression and, thus, the rest of the signalling pathway, which leads
  to growth cessation and dormancy establishment. SDs also induce the expression of
  FDL1 and ABI3. Both of these proteins are able to interact physically with each
  other and regulate the expression of genes involved in bud maturation and adaptive
  responses for cold tolerance (see text for details).
