caption: The divergent macrophage activation pathway. Macrophage activation and differentiation
  from monocyte in the wounded tissue depends on chemokine and growth factors availability.
  Two macrophage activation pathways might be distinguished, classical activation
  (M1) depending on interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and
  alternative activation pathway (M2). Alternative activation is divided into two
  separate macrophage populations, IL-4 and IL-13 derived wound-healing macrophage
  population and TGF-β derived regulatory macrophage population. Despite monocyte
  origin, different activation pathway results in production and secretion of different
  chemokines and proteins into wounded tissue.
