caption: Role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating glucocorticoid effects on
  memory consolidation. Glucocorticoids, released during emotionally arousing situations,
  bind to a membrane-bound GR, and activate the intracellular cAMP/PKA signaling cascade.
  This triggers the release of endocannabinoids, particularly anandamide (AEA). Anandamide
  then activates CB1 receptors on GABAergic interneurons and thereby inhibits GABA
  release. This subsequently disinhibits norepinephrine (NE) release and increases
  the excitability of pyramidal neurons within the basolateral amygdala. This overall
  increases the sensitivity of basolateral amygdala neurons to the effects of norepinephrine
  and results in an increased activation of the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate)
  / PKA (protein kinase A) pathway and phosphorylation of the transcription factor
  CREB (cAMP response-element binding) protein. These stress hormone effects in the
  basolateral amygdala are required for enhancement of memory for emotionally arousing
  experiences by influencing information storage processes in other brain regions.
