caption: HO-1 upregulates EET and PGC1α to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and integrity,
  which inhibits FAS and adiposity. Additionally, HO-1 has been shown to translocate
  to the nucleus and upregulate transcription factors to reduce insulin resistance
  and adiposity and increase metabolic function, although the exact mechanisms of
  this pathway have yet to be fully elucidated. HO-1 also promotes cardioprotective
  properties, shows improved kidney function and attenuates NAFLD and obesity.
