caption: Recent use of unbiased pathway models () have revealed an important multidimensional
  character to nutritional metabolomics. Differences in plasma metabolite profiles
  in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and normal glucose tolerance were
  associated with transporters functioning in mitochondrial/cytoplasmic balance of
  NAD+ and NADH (SLC25A13), and with cell membrane transporters involved in amino
  acid transport (System A and System L) and osmotic regulation (SLC6A12). In this
  schematic representation based upon the KEGG human metabolic pathway map, the plasma
  metabolome (bottom) is linked to KEGG biochemical pathways in the cytoplasm (middle)
  through System A, System L and SLC6A12, and a subset of metabolites in the cytoplasm
  is linked to the mitochondrial matrix though the glutamate-aspartate transporter
  (SCL25A13). Based upon findings of Deo et al (). Some metabolites are not labeled
  due to lack of space.
