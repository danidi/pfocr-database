caption: 'Computational pipeline to predict tissue function using tissue‐level gene
  expression data.Cartoon outlining the update of the C. elegans metabolic network
  model. GPR, gene‐protein‐reaction association.Conceptual overview of integration
  of iCEL1314 with four categories of genes: highly, moderately, lowly, and rarely
  expressed. The predicted flux state in a tissue is a flux distribution that trails
  reactions associated with highly expressed genes in that tissue, while avoiding
  those associated with lowly expressed and rarely expressed genes. Circles and arrows
  indicate metabolites and reactions, respectively. Black arrows show flux, with thicker
  arrows indicating higher flux. Boxes depict enzymes encoded by genes that have expression
  levels indicated by color. Dashed arrows indicate reactions with no flux in the
  preliminary flux distribution stage according to Fig B but are then detected as
  latent reactions and are forced to carry flux when possible (see text for details).To
  derive tissue‐relevant metabolic network functions, a gene expression dataset obtained
  with single‐cell RNA‐seq of L2 animals was used (Cao et al, ). Single‐cell data
  were combined by the authors to provide high‐quality gene expression data for the
  seven tissues shown.Distribution of metabolic genes in iCEL1314 in different expression
  categories in each individual tissue and in all tissues combined, with colors as
  in (B). For the combination of data, the union set of highly expressed genes and
  the intersection set of rarely and lowly expressed genes are illustrated with corresponding
  colors. One gene which was lowly expressed in some tissues and rarely expressed
  in others is not shown in the combined data.'
