caption: An illustration of the IL-6-involved in cross-talk between intestinal bacteria
  and immune cells in both physiological and pathological conditions. IL-6 has close
  interactions with ENS within both enteric neurons and enteric nervous glia. The
  trans-presentation signaling pathway between DCs and naïve T cells is also showed
  here, suggesting a pivotal role of T cells in IL-6 mediated inflammatory process.
