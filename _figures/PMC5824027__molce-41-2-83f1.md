caption: The core inhibitory kinase module of the Hippo pathway is composed of MST1/2,
  MAP4K, and LATS1/2. The transcriptional module is composed of YAP/TAZ and TEAD.
  (A) When the Hippo pathway is ‘off’, YAP/TAZ are dephosphorylated, accumulated,
  and they translocate into the nucleus to bind the transcription factors, TEAD1–TEAD4,
  which enable target gene transcription involved in cell proliferation. (B) When
  the Hippo pathway is turned ‘on’, LATS1/2 directly phosphorylate YAP/TAZ, which
  inhibit nuclear import of YAP/TAZ via 14-3-3-mediated cytoplasmic retention, and
  ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal and autolysosomal degradation. TEAD transcriptional
  activity is suppressed by VGLL4. LATS indicates large tumor suppressor; MST, mammalian
  STE20-like protein kinase; YAP, Yes-associated protein; TAZ, transcriptional co-activator
  with PDZ-binding motif; TEAD, TEA domain family members; VGLL4, transcription cofactor
  vestigial-like protein 4.
