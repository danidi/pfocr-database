caption: Schematic figure showing unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress pathway and its proposed role in skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness
  in ALS. In skeletal muscle of ALS-Tg mice, the G93A*SOD1 mutation leads to oxidative
  stress and protein misfolding. This leads to an age-dependent activation of ER stress
  sensors protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring
  kinase 1-alpha (IRE1α). Normally, these ER stress sensors physically interact with
  the ER chaperone immunoglobulin binding protein (Grp78/BiP) which suppresses their
  activation but accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins activates Grp78/BiP,
  including an upregulation of Grp78/BiP and PDI protein expression. Prolonged and
  severe ER stress can trigger apoptosis by ER stress-specific cell death signals,
  including C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-12, leading to muscle atrophy.
