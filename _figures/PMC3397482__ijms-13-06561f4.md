caption: Cytoscape is an open-source bioinformatics software platform for visualizing
  molecular interaction networks and integrating these networks with other state data.
  Cytoscape was used to model the interaction networks for VEGF-A (also called vascular
  permeability factor (VPF). The software found 56 interaction networks at a pathway
  level, and one of these interaction networks, the HIF-2-α network, is shown with
  40 nodes and 114 edges. The importance of this figure is to provide the reader understanding
  of the level of complexity to which we refer when we speak of interactions at the
  gene or protein level illustrating this by VEGF-A pathway. Each node represents
  a molecule that interacts with HIF-2-α; in this case 40 molecules interact with
  this important marker in different malignancies, through 114 edges.
