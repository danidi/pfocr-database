caption: Regulation of myostatin activity and muscle growth. Myostatin is negatively
  regulated by various naturally-occurring binding proteins. When not bound to these
  inhibitory proteins, myostatin signals by binding initially to the two activin type
  II receptors, ACVR2 and ACVR2B, which then leads to binding and activation of the
  type I receptors, ALK4 and/or ALK5. Signaling through this pathway results in inhibition
  of muscle growth. Ligand “X” refers to the as yet unidentified TGF-ß related ligand
  or ligands that cooperate with myostatin to limit muscle growth. Components shown
  in red act to block muscle growth, and components shown in green act to promote
  muscle growth. As described in the text, ligand “X” can be blocked by either follistatin
  or FSTL-3, but whether ligand “X” can also be inhibited by other regulatory components
  is not known.
