caption: Association of the activity of metagene 19 with two distinct image phenotypes.
  (a) Low activity of metagene 19 is associated with low activity of LRIG1 (green
  arrow), and high activity of the EGF–EGF receptor (EGFR; red arrow) pathway results
  in cell proliferation through activating KRAS and PIK3CA. (b) High activity of metagene
  19 results in high activity of LRIG1 (red arrow) with inhibition of the EGF–EGF
  receptor pathway (green arrow), but results in higher occurrence of EGF receptor
  mutations, which severs the link between LRIG1 and EGF receptor.
