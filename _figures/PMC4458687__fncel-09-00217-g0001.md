caption: Schematic diagram of Axin domains, molecular interactions and Cdk5-dependent
  phosphorylation site. Axin possesses functional domains including the Regulators
  of G protein signaling (RGS which interacts with adenomatosis polyposis coli, APC)
  and DIX domains. Axin contains domains for interacting with other proteins such
  as MEKK1 (MID), GSK3β (GID), and β-catenin (CID). A small molecule, XAV939, stabilizes
  Axin by inhibiting the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzyme tankyrase which stimulates Axin
  degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It is worth noting that the
  Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation site (Thr485) is located close to the nuclear export
  signal (NES) of Axin (amino acids 413–423).
