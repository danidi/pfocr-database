caption: 13C-labeling patterns from metabolism of (A) [1-13C]glucose in neurons and
  astrocytes and (B) [1,2-13C]acetate in astrocytes. Black circles are 13C atoms,
  striped circles show the 13C-label obtained from metabolism via the PC pathway in
  astrocytes, white circles are 12C atoms. α-KG, α-ketogluratate; glu, glutamate;
  gln, glutamine (in astrocytes); PC, pyruvate carboxylase (in astrocytes only); PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; OAA, oxaloacetate; acetyl CoA, acetyl Coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
