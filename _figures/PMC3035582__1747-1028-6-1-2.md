caption: Skp2 and Skp2B in normal and cancer cells. (A) In normal cells, the Rb and
  p53 pathway prevents abnormal cell growth. The actions of p27, p300 and prohibitin
  assist Rb and p53 in their tumor suppressor functions. (B) In cancer cells, where
  the Skp2 and Skp2B locus are amplified, the functions of p27, p300 and prohibitin
  are lost and as a result, the Rb and p53 pathways are disrupted allowing cell growth.
