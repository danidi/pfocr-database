caption: The known input signals are indicated at the top of each pathway (at the
  level of the plasma membrane) and the key identified components of the pathways
  are shown below as ovals. The position of Rak1 in U. maydis is shown as influencing
  ribosomes and the transcription factor Rop1 (). A speculative position for Rak1
  at the level of G protein signaling is also shown for U. maydis and indicated with
  a question mark based on the findings in C. neoformans (). In addition, Rim101 and
  Urbs1 are positioned as potential downstream targets of the protein kinase A catalytic
  subunit Adr1. Solid arrows indicate the flow of signals through the pathways with
  dotted arrows representing the influence on downstream target phenotypes. The representations
  of the signaling pathways are based on previous reviews and the recent findings
  (; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ; ; ). Details on additional signaling components can be found
  in these reviews.
