caption: Stabilization of HIF-1 promotes longevity by a mechanism distinct from both
  insulin-like signaling and dietary restriction (DR). HIF-1 also negatively impacts
  longevity by repressing nuclear localization and activation of DAF-16, in a temperature-dependent
  manner. HIF-1 also interacts with TOR/Raptor and the DR pathway, but in a complex
  manner dependent on additional experimental variables that are currently unknown
  (represented by dashed lines).
