caption: Model of DSB-free recombination-dependent replication.A. Restart of replication
  forks that have lost replication competence (1) requires recombination proteins.
  Several helicases and translocases can mediate fork reversal (2) allowing DNA-end
  resection to generate ssDNA on which Rad51 is loaded (3). The Rad51 filament then
  promotes strand invasion into the reformed parental DNA duplex to generate a D-loop
  intermediate (4) from which DNA synthesis is primed, restoring a functional but
  non-canonical fork (5). Alternatively, fork-restart may be initiated by resection
  of the lagging strand (2′) and the backtracking of the fork, generating an extruded
  leading strand onto which Rad51 is loaded (3′). In fission yeast, Rad51-mediated
  restarted forks are associated with a semi-conservative DNA synthesis during which
  both strands are synthetized by the DNA polymerase delta.B. Protection of stalled
  replication forks. Upon fork stalling (1), transient uncoupling allows RAD51 to
  bind to the ssDNA at the fork junction. This can occur independently of the BRCA2
  loader (2). RAD51 promotes fork-reversal (3), possibly in a coordinated manner with
  additional helicases and translocases (i.e. SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, HTLF). BRCA2-dependent
  loading of RAD51 onto the fourth arm of the reversed fork protects the double-stranded
  DNA end from nucleolytic attack (4) by multiple exo- and endonucleases and helicases
  (i.e. DNA2, MRE11, CtIP, EXO1, WRN). Likely, RAD51-mediated fork reversal and protection
  maintain the integrity of the fork and allow appropriate merger with a converging
  forks (5). Whether limited end-resection is required for RAD51-mediated fork reversal
  and protection is unknown. The fate of the replisome at the reversed fork is also
  unknown.C. Repair of post-replicative gaps. When replicative DNA polymerases encounter
  a DNA lesion (1), transient and controlled uncoupling can occur, resulting in the
  formation of a ssDNA gap at the fork junction (2) which is subsequently coated by
  Rad51. DNA synthesis is resumed via repriming downstream the DNA lesion, leaving
  an internal ssDNA gap behind the moving fork (3). The ssDNA gap is enlarged by the
  DNA-end resection machinery facilitating further Rad51 loading by recombination
  mediators (4). The repair of the ssDNA gap is finalized in G2 phase (5).
