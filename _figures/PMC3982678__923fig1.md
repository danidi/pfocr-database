caption: Toll and IMD signaling in Drosophila immune activation. The Drosophila immune
  response begins with detection of microbial molecules, proceeds through NF-κB signaling
  via two pathways, Toll and IMD, and results in defensive responses including plasmatocyte
  activation, antimicrobial peptide production, and melanization. This schematic highlights
  the players relevant to  but omits several intermediate steps and protein names
  for simplicity. Dorsal (Dl), Dif, and Relish are three fly homologs of NF-κB. Dl
  and Dif are activated by the Toll pathway, while Relish is activated by the IMD
  pathway. Each NF-κB is normally kept inactive by the IκB Cactus protein in the cytosol.
  Upon detection of microbial molecules, the Toll ligand is cleaved from its pro-form
  and binds to the Toll receptor. Toll receptor activation leads to degradation of
  Cactus and allows Dl/Dif to move into the nucleus to act as a transcription factor
  for the Drosomycin antimicrobial peptide. Alternatively, the receptor for the IMD
  pathway can detect microbial molecules and initiate signaling through the IMD adaptor
  protein. IMD signaling also results in Cactus degradation and permits Relish-mediated
  Diptericin antimicrobial peptide production. Dl activation can be modified by SUMOylation.
  The Ubc9 conjugation enzyme attaches SUMO to Dl, while  show that SUMO is removed
  from Dl by the cooperation of the Ulp1 SUMO protease and the β-arrestin Krz. The
  mechanism through which the Dl SUMOylation cycle affects immune response is currently
  under investigation.
