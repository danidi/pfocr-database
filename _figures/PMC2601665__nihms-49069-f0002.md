caption: The Hh-Gli pathway and the Gli code in tissue patterning and stem-cell lineages.
  (a) Representation of the Gli code acting downstream of Hh-Smo signaling. On inhibition
  of Ptch1 function by the Hh ligands, the repression of Smo by Ptch1 is ended. Smo
  then orchestrates changes in the Gli code by stabilizing and activating full-length
  Gli proteins (GliA) and blocking the action of inhibitors and the production of
  Gli repressors (GliR), mostly Gli3 in this case. Positive modulators enhance the
  nuclear localization and the activation of full-length Gli proteins. In the absence
  of Hh ligands, Ptch1 inhibits Smo and negative modulators sequester full-length
  Gli proteins in the cytoplasm and target them for cleavage to produce C-terminal
  truncations (which act as constitutive nuclear repressors) or for complete degradation
  by the proteasome. Examples of positive and negative modulators are given here and
  in the text. Note that reception of the Hh signal and the orchestration of the Gli
  code are proposed to occur in the primary cilium [,]. (b) Model of a Hh gradient
  in a developmental field (top) that grows and becomes patterned through the action
  of inverse gradients of Gli activators (green) and repressors (red). Different combinations
  of the Gli code are proposed to activate overlapping sets of targets that result
  in distinct fates and proliferation/survival rates and thus sizes of tissues and
  organs. (c) Model of a stem-cell lineage with the activation of stem cells from
  quiescent cells in the niche by an upsurge of Hh signals. This leads to self-renewal
  and the production of derived precursors and differentiated cells. The temporal
  gradient of Hh is interpreted by varying levels of activators and repressors of
  Gli proteins, leading to a changing Gli code.
