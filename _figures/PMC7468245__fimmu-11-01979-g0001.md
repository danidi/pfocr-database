caption: 'Potential Immune Pathogenesis of SARS-Cov-2. (A) Replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2:
  Spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
  a cell-surface protein. The virion releases its RNA. Some RNA is translated into
  proteins by the host cell''s machinery. Proteins and RNA are assembled into a new
  virion in the Golgi and released. (B) The innate and adaptive immune responses to
  Coronavirus (CoV) infection. (I). Initiation of immune response via PAMPs/DAMPS.
  The host innate immune system detects CoV infections by using pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs) to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and
  Damage (Danger)-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs). (II) Activation of T-cells
  and B-cells via cytokines and activation of the complement system. CoV infection
  leads to macrophages activation and release of inflammatory cytokines. This in turn
  activates T and B cells and promotes differentiation. Multiple different T cell
  subsets (i.e., Th1 and Th17) are involved, releasing cytokines for immune response
  amplification. (III) Activation of Neutrophils (NET formation) Neutrophils, attracted
  by chemokines/cytokines swarm to the site of infection. Subsequently activated neutrophils
  undergo degranulation and NET formation releasing intracellular DAMPs, DNA, histones,
  neutrophil elastase that activate the PRRs of surrounding immune and non-immune
  cells to induce cytokine secretion. Neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps
  (NETs) drive necroinflammation in COVID-19. The extracellular DNA released by NETs
  activates platelets and aggregated NETs provide a scaffold for binding of erythrocytes
  and activated platelets that promote thrombus formation. (IV) Dendritic Cell mediated
  activation of T-cells. DCs present viral antigens to T-cells inducing activation.
  (V) Cytokine and C5a led to influx of immune cells. Secrete chemokines, cytokines
  and complement C5a attract immune cells. (C) Effects of CoV-mediated complement
  activation. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to activate the lectin (MBL) complement pathway.
  Antibodies (early stage IgM or at a later stage IgG) to the virus can activate the
  classic complement pathway. Both pathways converge at C3. C3 can be converted into
  C3a and C3b. C3b mediates pathogen opsonization and activates the conversion of
  C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b mediates the formation of the membrane attack complex,
  which leads to cell lysis. C3a and C5a promote immune cell recruitment to the site
  of infection.'
