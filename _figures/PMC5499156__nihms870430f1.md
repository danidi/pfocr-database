caption: Schematic representation of proteins that interact directly or indirectly
  with mGlu1/5 receptors and mediate receptor signalling. The COOH terminal intracellular
  domain of group-I mGlu receptors interacts with Norbin, Calmodulin (CaM), Siah-1A,
  Calcineurin inhibitor protein (CAIN), Tamalin, and long (Long H) and short isoforms
  (H1a) of Homer proteins. Homer proteins interact through their amino-terminal domain
  with IP3 receptors, Shank, PIKE-L, drebrin, and the transient receptor potential
  channel (TRPC). Homer interactions with other proteins such as ryanodine receptors,
  oligophrenin 1, dynamin III, Rho small GTPases are not depicted here. The association
  Homer-IP3R couples IP3R to mGlu1/5 receptors and mediates intracellular Ca2+signalling.
  Long H proteins regulate the TRPC channel function by mediating the formation of
  the TRPC/Homer/IP3R complex. The mGlu5 receptor-dependent activation of PI3K pathway
  is mediated by the association between Long H and PIKE-L. Shank-Homer interactions
  associate mGlu1/5 receptors to NMDA receptors through PSD95 and GKAP, and anchor
  mGlu/NMDA complex to the actin cytoskeleton through Cortactin and Drebrin. mGlu5/Homer
  binding is regulated by Preso1 (see text for details). Long H proteins bind the
  diacylglycerol lipase-alpha (DGLα) that converts DAG into 2-AG. The short Homer
  1a (H1a), acting as a dominant negative modulator, competitively binds the target
  proteins of Long H such as mGlu1/5, PIKE-L, Shank, TRPC, IP3R. mGlu5 receptors also
  associate with eEF2K either directly or indirectly through Homer proteins. Activation
  of mGlu5 receptors exerts a tight control on protein synthesis through mechanisms
  involving mTOR and ERK pathways, and regulation of eEF2K activity (see text).

  description: Schematic representation of proteins that interact directly or indirectly

    potential channel (TRPC). Homer interactions with other proteins such as ryanodine

    The association Homer-IP3R couples IP3R to mGlu1/5 receptors and mediates intracellular

    interactions associate mGlu1/5 receptors to NMDA receptors through PSD95 and GKAP,

    mGlu5/Homer binding is regulated by Preso1 (see text for details). Long H proteins

    Activation of mGlu5 receptors exerts a tight control on protein synthesis through
