caption: Bitter taste receptor T2R38 innate immune signaling pathway in sinonasal
  ciliated epithelial cells. Gram-negative bacteria secrete acyl-homoserine lactone
  quorum sensing molecules (AHL) as a form of microbial communication. These bitter
  compounds bind to the bitter taste receptor T2R38, expressed in sinonasal ciliated
  epithelial cells, which activates a biochemical cascade and leads to a calcium (Ca2+)
  signal that mediates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) dependent nitric oxide (NO) production.
  NO upregulates ciliary beating, enhances mucociliary clearance of trapped pathogens,
  and directly kills bacteria after diffusing into the airway surface liquid.
