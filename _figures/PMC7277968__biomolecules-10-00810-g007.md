caption: Schematic representation of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway and
  intravascular remodeling of lipoprotein particles during the postprandial phase.
  Large arrows indicate steps of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway that are
  enhanced (red arrow), reduced (blue arrow) or unchanged (green arrow) in normolipidemic
  male subjects exhibiting an undesirable postprandial TG response (GHigh) compared
  to those displaying a desirable postprandial TG response (GLow).
