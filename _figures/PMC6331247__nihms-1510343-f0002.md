caption: 'Potential pathway for the relationship between MS4A6A SNPs, blood gene expression
  and Alzheimer’s disease phenotype. The relationship between MS4A6A IGAP SNP rs983392,
  blood gene expression, and Alzheimer’s disease phenotype are complex and possibly
  multifactorial. The rs983392 SNP constitutes an eQTL for MS4A6A, and also a proxy
  for a nonsynonymous exonic MS4A6A SNP rs7232. It is possible that the nonsynonymous
  SNP rs7232 is not, or is only partially responsible, for the eQTL phenomena, which
  may indicate parallel gene regulatory mechanism(s).Key: SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism,
  IGAP, International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project, eQTL, expression quantitative
