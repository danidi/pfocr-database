caption: EGFR are endocytosed into cells to form signaling endosomes (SE) and early
  endosomes (EE) regulated by RAB5, and then are transported from early to late endosomes
  (LE) regulated by transition from RAB5 to RAB7. a At this time, ESCRT machinery
  sorts the ubiquitylated EGFR into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are destined
  to lysosomes for degradation by the fusion of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) with
  lysosomes regulated by RAB7. b However, high RAB31, guarding on the late endosomes,
  encounters active EGFR and can be activated via tyrosine phosphorylation by EGFR,
  and then active RAB31 engages FLOTs in lipid rafts to drive EGFR entry into MVEs
  to form ILVs. Meanwhile, RAB31 recruits TBC1D2B to inactivate RAB7 preventing the
  fusion of MVEs with lysosomes, thereby enabling that the sequestered EGFR ILVs are
  secreted as exosomes. c Representative image of MVE membrane budding to form ILVs
  driven by the active RAB31 in NCI-H1975 cells. The white triangles indicate the
  budding moments of MVE membrane. Immunofluorescence of endogenous RAB31 (green)
  and CD63 (red) in NCI-H1975 cells. Scale bar, 5 μm.
