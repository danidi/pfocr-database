caption: Schematic representation of TRAF3-mediated positive and negative regulation
  of IFN signaling. Sensing of dsRNA and Lys63 ubiquitination of RIG-I by TRIM25 leads
  to a conformational change that allows the CARD domain to interact with downstream
  adaptor MAVS. MAVS in turn dimerizes and recruits TRAF3 to the C-terminal 455-PEENEY-460
  consensus site, a process requiring Lys63-polyubquitination of TRAF3. The MAVS-TRAF3
  interaction leads to the recruitment and activation of downstream kinases TBK1/IKKε
  to phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7 in the cytoplasm. IRF3 and IRF7 will dimerize, translocate
  into the nucleus where they will bind specific ISGs and induce type I IFN. K63-linked
  polyubiquitination at Lys500 of MAVS recruits IKKε to the C-terminus of MAVS. The
  recruitment of IKKε to the mitochondria will release TRAF3 from the mitochondria
  and initiate the signal to shutdown the IFN response by either activating or recruiting
  DUBA to remove the Lys63-polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3. De-ubiquitinated TRAF3 is
  then targeted to the proteasome by Lys48 ubiquitination mediated by the action of
  TRIAD3A and thus shutting down any further activation of the IFN pathway.
