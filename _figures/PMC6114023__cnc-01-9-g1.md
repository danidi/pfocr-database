caption: Inflammatory events, such as those induced by traumatic brain injury, activate
  signaling cascades (including NF-κB and JNK) that phosphorylate and inactivate insulin
  receptor substrate proteins. Inactivation of insulin receptor substrate proteins,
  in turn, prevents insulin receptor signaling. One prominent downstream target of
  insulin signaling is AKT, a neuroprotective kinase that also influences neuronal
  energy metabolism. Insulin resistance following traumatic brain injury therefore
  deprives the nervous system of this protective pathway, rendering the individual
  vulnerable to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits.
