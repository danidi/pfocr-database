caption: Melanogenesis. Network of interaction among the molecules related to Melanogenes
  using STRING (http://string.embl.de/) obtained from different methods, including
  joint and separate analysis based on FA+LDA (combination of factor analysis and
  linear discriminant analysis) and HC+SAM (combination of hierarchical clustering
  and SAM). (a) Joint approach (FA+LDA) and (b)Separate approach (FA+LDA) are from
  the joint and separate analyses based on FA+LDA methods, respectively. The loss
  of connectivity due to the lack of molecules CTNNB1 and GSK3B in the separate analysis
  corresponds to a loss of information related to the Wnt signaling pathway which
  is of utmost relevance in melanocyte differentiation and melanoma onset. (c) Joint
  approach (HC+SAM) and (d) Separate approach (HC+SAM) illustrate the results from
  the joint and separate analyses based on HC+SAM methods, respectively. Similarly
  to the FA+LDA methods, joint analysis shows better performance than the separate
  analysis since the latter is not able to identify the key factor TYR for melanogenesis.
  Overall, regarding melanogenesis, FA+LDA methods outperforms HC+SAM, and the joint
  analysis is more informative than the separate analysis. Joint analysis based on
  FA+LDA only is able to uncover the emergent melanogenesis process in melanoma.
