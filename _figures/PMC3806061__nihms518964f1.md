caption: Diagrammatic representation of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. In the
  absence of Hh ligand (A), PATCHED protein (PTCH) prevents smoothened (Smo) from
  accessing the cilium. The zinc finger protein Gli undergoes proteosomal cleavage
  and is converted to its repressor form (GliR). Gli R migrates to the nucleus and
  silences Hh target genes. In the presence of Hh ligand (B), Hh binds to PTCH and
  inactivates it via endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. This process allows Smo
  to associate with the cilium, and Smo facilitates the activation of Gli. Activated
  Gli (GliA) migrates to the nucleus and stimulates Hh target gene transcription.
  Inhibitors of the Hh signaling pathway have been indicated (blue boxes) and may
  act primarily on Hh, Smo, or Gli. Of these, Smo antagonists are being evaluated
  currently in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.
