caption: Lipid mobilization and photorespiration processes in the soybean cotyledon
  cell during functional transition. During the first stages of seedling development,
  when lipid mobilization is essential, lipase (1) catalyses the release of fatty
  acids (FA) from triacylglycerol (TAG) within the lipid bodies. The fatty acids produced
  are activated to acyl-CoA esters and enter the glyoxysome where the acyl-CoA molecules
  are broken down to acetyl-CoA via the β-oxidation spiral. The acetyl-CoA then serves
  as a substrate for the subsequent reactions of the glyoxylate cycle which is an
  adapted form of the respiratory tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Succinate is produced,
  transformed to malate in the mitochondrion and exported to the cytoplasm. Then,
  it is converted to carbohydrate which is translocated and used in the growing parts
  of the plant. Glyoxysomes and peroxisomes co-exist during the functional transition
  and eventually peroxisomes become abundant while glyoxysomes decrease in number.
  During the photorespiratory phase the phosphoglycolate produced in the chloroplast
  through the Calvin cycle is mobilized to the peroxisome in the form of glycolate
  where is oxidized to glyoxylate in a reaction that yields hydrogen peroxide. Glycine
  is finally synthesized and transferred to the mitochondrion, converted to serine
  and returned to the chloroplast in the form of glycerate after several metabolic
  reactions within the peroxisome. Peroxisomes are commonly large and abundant in
  photosynthetic tissues. 1 – Lipase; 2 – Malate dehydrogenase (MDH); 3 – Citrate
  synthase (CS); 4 – Aconitate hydratase (AH); 5 – Isocitrate lyase (ICL); 6 – Malate
  synthase (MS); A – Ribulose-bisphosphate caroboxylase (Rubisco); B – Glycolate oxidase;
  C – glutamate semialdehyde aminotransferase; D – Catalase; E – phosphoglycerate
  kinase.
