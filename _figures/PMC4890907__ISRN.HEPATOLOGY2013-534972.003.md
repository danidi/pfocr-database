caption: The effects of RA on the insulin-regulated Srebp-1c and Pck1 expression levels,
  the protein levels of SREBP-1c, the expression levels of Raldh1 and Fas, and the
  fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis in insulin-sensitive (a) and insulin-resistant
  (b) hepatocytes. Please see the text in this paper for description. Up arrows next
  to the text indicate induction. The intensified weight of the lines indicates the
  induction of that part of the pathway.
