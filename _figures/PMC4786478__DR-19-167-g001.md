caption: Arsenate (As5+) is reduced by As5+ reductase with glutathione (GSH) to yield
  arsenite (As3+) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG). As3+ is converted to pentavalent
  monomethylarsonic acid (MMA5+), a reaction catalyzed by arsenic-3-methyltransferase
  (AS3MT), with Sadenosylmethione (SAM) serving as the methyl donor; in the process,
  SAM is hydrolyzed to Sadenosyl homocysteine (SAH). After the reduction of MMA5+
  to MMA3+, a second methylation step result in the synthesis of dimethylarsinic acid
  (DMA5+), and then it is reduced to DMA3+.
