caption: (A) Representation of normal BRAF pathway. The sequence of the cascade RAF-BRAF-MEK-ERK
  starting from the activation of Thyrosin kinase receptor, regulates normal cell
  differentiation and proliferation. (B) When BRAFV600E mutation occurs it will increase
  the activation of MEK and ERK which induce a more higher cancer cell proliferation.
  (C) The treatment which a given BRAF-inhibitor will reduce the increased activation
  of MEK (and consequently of ERK) by BRAFV600E mutation reducing also tumor cell
  proliferation.
