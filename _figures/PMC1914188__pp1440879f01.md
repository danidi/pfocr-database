caption: Caffeine biosynthetic pathway in C. canephora ‘robusta’. The first (1), third
  (3), and fourth (4) steps are N-methylations and the second (2) step is cleavage
  of Rib. Water is depicted as the proton acceptor for nitrogens accepting the reactive
  methyl group from SAM to produce an oxonium ion (H3O+). Italic letters highlight
  the atom undergoing methylation and the transferred groups are highlighted in bold.
