caption: 'Notch pathway promotes drug resistance by regulating cancer cell survival,
  glycolytic switch and cancer stem cells. (A) Notch pathway can be triggered by the
  interaction of 4 receptors (Notch1-4) and 2 different classes of ligands, named
  Jagged (Jagged1-2) and Delta-like family (Dll1-3-4) (, ,). The following domains
  can be distinguished in Notch receptors: signal peptide (SP); epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like
  repeats; Negative Regulatory Region (NRR), composed by Lin-Notch repeats (LNR) and
  heterodimerization domain (HD); transmembrane domain (TM); RBJK associated module
  (RAM); ankyrin repeats (ANK); transactivation domain (TAD); proline(P),glutamic
  acid(E),serine(S) and threonine (T) domain (PEST). Jagged and Dll ligands are composed
  by: signal peptide (SP); Notch ligand N-terminal domain (MNNL); Delta/Serrate/LAG-2
  domain (DSL); epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like repeats; cysteine rich region (CR);
  transmembrane domain (TM); Lysin residues; (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1)–ligand motif (PDZL)
  (,). (B) Canonical Notch signaling: Notch activation is triggered by ligand engagement
  which enables two consecutive proteolytic cleavages performed by the ADAM metalloproteinase
  and the γ-secretase complex, that allow ICN to translocate into the nucleus where
  it binds the RBJK/CSL complex and activates the transcription of Notch target genes
  such as the HES (), and HEY () family of genes, c-Myc () and other genes involved
  in proliferation, survival, differentiation and stemness. (C) Notch role in cancer
  cell drug resistance. Notch activation in cancer cell can occur through: (1) homotypic
  interaction with nearby cancer cells or (2) heterotypic interaction with BM cells
  (i.e., BMSC). (3) Notch ligands localized on the surface of BMSCs activate Notch
  signaling in tumor cells resulting in increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins
  including c-IAP2, Bcl-2, NF-κB and decreased expression of PARP and active Caspase3
  (, ; ) with the subsequent development of chemoresistance mechanisms in different
  tumors as CLL (), B-ALL () and AML (). Moreover, BMSC-derived Notch ligands may
  stimulate the expression of p21Cip1/WAF1 and CYP1A1 and downregulate pro-apoptotic
  NOXA in cancer cells via Notch signaling regulating the development of drug resistance
  in MM cells (, ; ,). (4) On the other hand, also cancer cells may activate Notch
  signaling in BM cells such as BMSCs, that in turn secrete the following pro-tumoral
  soluble factors: (5) SDF1α promotes and upregulates Bcl-2, Survivin and MRP1/ABCC1
  in MM (); (6) IL6 () is reported to upregulate anti-apoptotic and pro-survival proteins
  in tumor cells including Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, and Survivin (; ; ); (7) IGF1 and
  VEGF can contribute to induce drug resistance in hematological and solid tumors
  (; ; ; ; ; ; ). Notch pathway may influence tumor cell drug sensitivity also promoting
  the glycolytic switch by enhancing the expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic
  enzymes in cancer cells. (8) In D. melanogaster Notch signaling was found to regulate
  GLUT1, HexA and IMPL3 and (9) suppress TCA cycle via the upregulation of Hairy gene
  (). (10) In breast cancer Notch signaling induces PI3K/AKT activation that leads
  to the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes such as ALDOA, PDK2, HK2, and GLUT1 ().
  Notably, BM adipocytes enhance the expression of two acknowledged Notch downstream
  effectors, i.e., HK2 and GLUT1, in prostate cancer cells (). (11) In CLL, Notch
  pathway activation induces c-Myc upregulation and the subsequent increased expression
  of LDHA, GLUT1, HK2, PFKM, and ENO1 (). Finally, wherever possible, for each Notch
  downstream effector involved in cancer cell glycolytic switch, it is reported the
  recognized outcome in drug and radiation resistance (; ; ; ; ). (D) Notch in cancer
  stem cells: (1) Notch signaling promotes cancer cell EMT, which is closely associated
  to stemness. For instance, Notch1 and Notch4 expression in prostate cancer cells
  promotes EMT via NF-κB activation. EMT also enables cancer cell dissemination throughout
  the body including BM (; ; ). (2) At BM level, Notch pathway activation in CSCs
  can be mediated by homotypic or heterotypic interactions and positively regulates
  tumor cell self-renewal, resulting in the amplification of the CSC population characterized
  by intrinsic high pharmacological resistance. (3) In OS cell, Notch activation boosts
  the expression of ALDH (), a CSC marker also associated with drug resistance due
  to its detoxifying activity (). (4) miR-26a inhibits self-renewal by down-regulating
  Jagged1/Notch signaling (). (5) In CLL, Notch activation results in resistance to
  Imatinib mediated by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling (). (6) In BM microenvironment, tumor-derived
  IL-6 promotes an autocrine upregulation of Notch3, that in turn supports CSC survival
  and self-renewal (). (7) Moreover, IL-6 triggers STAT3 signaling in BMSCs improving
  the secretion of extracellular vesicles carrying the onco-miR221; this, in turn,
  increases Notch3 expression in CSCs and hormonal therapy resistance in bone metastasis
  of luminal breast cancer (). (8) In NSCLC, activating mutations of Notch1 correlate
  with CSCs and poor prognosis in patients (). (9) In NSCLC, hypoxia-induced Notch1
  activation promotes CSC self-renewal via pSTAT3 and HES1 and cis-platinum resistance
  through the positive regulation of pAKT and Survivin ().'
