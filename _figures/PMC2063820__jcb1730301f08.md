caption: Model of E2-induced criss-cross transactivation of EGFR through activation
  of the SphK1–S1P signaling pathway. E2, acting on its own receptors (GPR30 and/or
  mER), induces the activation of SphK1 release of S1P and the consequent activation
  of the S1P receptor Edg-3, leading to the EGFR transactivation.
