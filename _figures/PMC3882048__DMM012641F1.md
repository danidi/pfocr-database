caption: Schematic representation of the galactose metabolic pathway in yeast and
  humans. GALK and GAL1 encode galactokinase in humans and yeast, respectively. GALT/GAL7
  and GALE/GAL10 encode the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase and the UDP-galactose
  4 epimerase, respectively. PGM indicates the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. The arrows
  indicate the flux in the direction of catabolism.
