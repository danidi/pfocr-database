caption: 'Protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway. (A) Simplified
  scheme of protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum showing genes/proteins
  differentially expressed/represented and biological processes affected in response
  to A. phagocytophilum infection of tick cells. Differences refer to infected versus
  uninfected tick cells. Discontinuous arrows indicate the presence of other enzymes
  in the pathway. Abbreviations: eIF2a, translation initiation factor 2, alpha subunit;
  ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  Bap31, B-cell receptor-associated protein; sHSF, heat shock protein; Hsp70, heat
  shock protein 70; Hsp90, heat shock protein 90; DUB, ataxin. (B) Some of the genes
  differentially expressed in response to A. phagocytophilum infection of tick cells
  directly correlated with the metabolomics results for certain amino acids. Gene
