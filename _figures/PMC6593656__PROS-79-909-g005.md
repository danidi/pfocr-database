caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanism underlying BEC proliferation
  in BPH. Activation of the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway in CD8+ T cells decreased NF‐κB
  phosphorylation and CCL5 secretion, resulting in the inhibition of CCL5/STAT5/CCND1
  signaling in BECs and decrease of their proliferation in low androgen conditions. BEC,
  BPH epithelial cell; BPH, benign prostatic hyperplasia; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate;
  NF‐κB, nuclear factor‐κB; PDE5, phosphodiesterase type 5; PDE5‐I, PDE5 inhibitors;
  PKG, protein kinase G; STAT5, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5
