caption: Schematic describing the effects and proposed response on TLR4 signaling
  pathway and inflammatory cytokines resulting from resveratrol treatment and HFD.
  HFD stimulated serum leptin level and decreased with resveratrol treatment. Leptin
  may upregulate CD14 via the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway and activate CD14-dependent
  TLR4 pathway to induce an inflammatory response (a, dashed line). A positive feedback
  loop may exist between IL-1β and TLR4 pathway (b, dashed line), and resveratrol-mediated
  direct (c, dashed line) or indirect (d, dashed line) inhibition of TLR4 expression
  in cartilage could block the IL-1β-TLR4 pathway feedback loop.
