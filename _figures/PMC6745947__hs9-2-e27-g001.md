caption: Model of hepcidin regulation by iron and erythropoiesis. In hepatocytes,
  2 signaling pathways additively contribute to hepcidin expression. The core component
  of the pathway is composed of BMP type I (I) and II (II) receptors. The complex
  on the right responds to BMP6, is activated by increased liver iron concentration
  (?), and is active also in the absence of hemochromatosis proteins such as HJV,
  TFR2, and HFE. The complex on the left is activated by BMP2 and functionally dependent
  upon HJV, TFR2, and HFE. It is involved in the maintenance of basal hepcidin levels
  and through TFR2, whose membrane levels are stabilized by diferric (holo)-TF, it
  responds to changes in circulating iron (holo-TF). How TFR2 activates hepcidin is
  still unknown (?). BMP2 and BMP6 are predominantly produced by liver sinusoidal
  endothelial cells, indicating the relevance of liver cell crosstalk in hepcidin
  regulation. The BMP-SMAD pathway is inhibited by the serine protease TMPRSS6 through
  HJV cleavage. Erythropoietin (EPO), increased in hypoxia, stimulates proliferation
  and differentiation of erythroid precursors that release a soluble protein, erythroferrone
  (ERFE) in the circulation. ERFE inhibits hepcidin through an unknown mechanism (?)
  to sustain hemoglobin synthesis, a process that requires large amounts of iron.
