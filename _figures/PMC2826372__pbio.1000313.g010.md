caption: Previously sequenced insect genomes (fly, mosquitoes, honeybee, red flour
  beetle) have indicated that the immune signaling pathways, including IMD and Toll
  pathways shown here, are conserved across insects. In Drosophila, response to many
  Gram-negative bacteria and some Gram-positive bacteria and fungi relies on the IMD
  pathway. In aphids, missing IMD pathway genes (dashed lines) include those involved
  in recognition (PGRPs) and signaling (IMD, dFADD, Dredd, REL). Genes encoding antimicrobial
  peptides common in other insects, including defensins and cecropins, are also missing.
  In contrast, we found putative homologs for all genes central to the Toll signaling
  pathway, which is key to response to bacteria, fungi, and other microbes in Drosophila.
