caption: 'The protein abundance changes in the network of phenylpropanoid metabolism.
  S1, S2, S3 indicates the developmental stages of sporogonium, early microsporocyte
  and meiosis during microsporogenesis according to the length of floral bud, respectively.
  Enriched Pathways involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism were denoted as Ko group
  with color boxes: ko00020 (Citrate cycle), ko00130 (Ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone
  biosynthesis), ko00195 (Photosynthesis), ko00360 (Phenylalanine metabolism), ko00400
  (Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis), ko00940 (Phenylpropanoid
  biosynthesis), ko00941 (Flavonoid biosynthesis), ko00945 (Stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid
  and gingerol biosynthesis). Abundance changes of hit DEPs in the pathways were showed
  with red (up-regulated) and green (down-regulated) heat map when compared between
  MT and WT in each stage. Numbers 1–7 refer to the product generated from each relevant
  pathway'

papertitle: Seedless mutant ‘Wuzi Ougan’ (Citrus suavissima Hort. ex Tanaka ‘seedless’)
  and the wild type were compared by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics and integratedly
  analyzed with transcriptome to improve understanding of male sterility.
