caption: Targeted Inhibition of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)/c-Met Signaling in
  Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). Secreted by local tumor associated
  fibroblasts (TAFs), pro-HGF is cleaved by membrane bound matriptase, enabling the
  heterodimer ligand to bind both the alpha and beta chain of the c-Met receptor.
  Upon binding, c-Met undergoes autophosphorylation and recruits adaptor molecules
  growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1)
  which further recruit oncogenic proteins SH2 containing protein tyrosine phosphatase
  (SHP2), signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3), Ras/Raf, and
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), initiating signaling cascades promoting proliferation,
  migration, invasion, and metastasis. Inhibition of the pathway can be achieved through
  several strategies including anti-HGF monoclonal antibodies such as ficlatuzumab,
  the competitive HGF antagonist NK4, c-Met specific antibodies including onartuzumab,
  and c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as crizotinib. Italicized agents
  are in clinical development for HNSCC.
