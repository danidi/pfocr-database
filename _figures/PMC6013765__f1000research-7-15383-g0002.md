caption: (Left) FGF8a dimerizes its receptor weakly, thus transducing a transient
  signal that can only weakly induce En2 and Spry1 expression, while totally failing
  to induce expression of Gbx2, the Otx2 suppressor. In the absence of Gbx2, the expression
  of Otx2 remains high. Under these conditions, proliferation of midbrain is encouraged.
  (Center) Immunoblots previously published in Huang et al.  (2017) showing a dose-dependent
  activation of the MAPK pathway (ERK1/2) by FGF8a, FGF8b, and FGF8b F32A in the BaF3
  cell line. By introducing the F32A mutation or reducing the FGF8b concentration,
  the MAPK activation appears similar to FGF8a. Data are representative of three independent
  experiments. (Right) FGF8b dimerizes its receptor strongly, thus producing a robust
  and persistent signal that strongly induces En2, Spry1, and Gbx2 expression, which
  suppresses Otx2 expression. Under these settings, midbrain differentiates to cerebellum.
  Thus, quantitative differences in the stability of FGF-induced FGFR dimers translate
  into differences in the magnitude/duration of the intracellular signal, which in
  turn modify the transcriptional landscape and ultimately define the developmental
  response. Stronger receptor dimerization strength and higher signaling intensity
  are indicated by darker coloring. FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast
  growth factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
