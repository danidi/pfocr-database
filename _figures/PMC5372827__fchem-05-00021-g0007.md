caption: Scheme reflecting the role of folate metabolism in redox homeostasis in plants.
  The folate pathway possibly contributes to production of NADPH that is used to detoxify
  ROS. Additionally, 5-CH3-THF takes part in the conversion of Hcy into Met, thereby
  preventing ROS production. Green areas represent pathways contributing to NADPH
  production, blue areas show pathways consuming NADPH, biosynthetic processes and
  ROS removal. THF, tetrahydrofolate; 5-CH3-THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH2-THF,
  5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; 10-CHO-THF, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate.
