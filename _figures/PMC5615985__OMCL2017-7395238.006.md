caption: 'Role of the LGM2605 in preventing asbestos-induced inflammation, oxidative/nitrosative
  cell damage, cell injury, and cell death proposed mechanism of asbestos-induced
  inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress and the protective effect of LGM2605.
  Asbestos exposure leads to the production of ROS (such as H2O2, .OH) that activates
  an inflammatory cascade, of which the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved. NLRP3 activation
  leads to the release of cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. These cytokines drive inflammation-induced
  cell death. Under these conditions, the damage-associated molecular pattern protein
  HMGB1 is either released by dead cells or passively secreted from inflamed cells.
  HMGB1 release can also lead to a feed forward cycle of IL-1β and IL-18 induction
  and activation. Importantly, asbestos-induced inflammation is largely driven by
  HMGB1 and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Frustrated phagocytosis of asbestos fibers may
  lead to cell necrosis and the subsequent release of HMGB1, which promotes the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Asbestos-induced ROS generation exacerbates this signaling
  cascade and further promotes malignant transformation. Combined, HMGB1 and NLRP3
  inflammasome activation, induces a proinflammatory signaling cascade that ultimately
  leads to IL-1β and TNFα secretion and NF-κB activation. LGM2605 exhibits a pluripotent
  role in preventing ROS/RNS generation and inflammation following asbestos exposure
  through several mechanisms: (1) LGM2605 directly scavenges free radicals (ROS, such
  as H2O2, .OH) and mitigates asbestos-induced ROS/RNS generation, (2) LGM2605 inhibits
  the proinflammatory NF-κB pathway presumably via reduced levels of ROS (either due
  to direct scavenging or due to increased antioxidant enzyme expression) or via direct
  inhibition of the transcription factor. LGM2605 decreased the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome
  (protein), HMGB1 (protein and mRNA), and the levels of iNOS (protein and mRNA),
  and (3) LGM2605 activates Nrf2 and induces the expression of cellular antioxidant
  and detoxification enzymes.'
