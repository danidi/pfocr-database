caption: 'A putative metabolic map described the pathway including the floral scent
  metabolic pathway and lignin pathway during the degradation of anthocyanins in B.
  acuminata petals. The diagram shows the different pathways. The diagram summarizes
  the results of qRT-PCR, MALDI-TOF/TOF and GC-TOF-MS analyses. The dashed black arrows
  represent several consecutive enzymatic steps. The color of the box indicates the
  method by which they were identified. The red arrow represents up or down and the
  symbol with * in the picture is expressed as an important substance identified in
  the petals. Enzymes: SAMT, salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase; COMT, catechol
  O-methyl transferase; CCoA-OMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyl; OMT, Anthocyanin-O-methyl
  transferase. Genes: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3′5′H, flavonoid
  3′5′-hydroxylase.'
