caption: A. Schematic of BMP9 signaling in EC. BMP9, acting through Alk1/ActRII/BMPRII,
  targets ID1 and ID3, which then up regulate the EphrinB2 promoter, presumably indirectly.
  Smad1/5/8 downstream of Alk1 may regulate the EphrinB2 promoter directly as it contains
  numerous BMP response elements (see ). Notch signaling also up-regulates EphrinB2,
  through a 5’ RBPj binding site. Alk1 signaling down-regulates VEGFR2 mRNA, and this
  may be through direct binding of ID1/ID3 to the E-boxes in the VEGFR2 promoter region
  or by its induction of HESR1. EphrinB2 and VEGFR2 may interact at the cell surface
  to further modulate VEGF signaling. B. Alk1 balances EphrinB2 and VEGFR2 expression.
  Loss of Alk1 in EC results in decreased EphrinB2 expression but increased VEGFR2
  expression. Loss of Alk1, and increased VEGFR2 expression, correlates with enhanced
  sprouting.
