caption: This illustration represents the electron transport system as it generates
  ATP and utilizes oxygen. ATP synthesis and H+ movements regulate the mitochondrial
  membrane potential, which in turn modulates the rate of respiration. In the classical
  rendition of this pathway, we note the cytochrome oxidase (Complex IV) exerts important
  control of this process because nitric oxide enhances the Km for oxygen [,,]. In
  the hypoxia scenario, calcium sequestration in mitochondria will be compromised
  allowing it to, at first stimulate the Krebs Cycle as well as nitric oxide synthase
  (NOS) to produce NO, allowing for more efficient oxygen utilization. Simultaneously,
  these same end products may enhance ROS from the Coenzyme Q complex, which in turn
  will inhibit the electron transport system []. In this inhibitory phenomenon, we
  surmise peroxynitrite is involved as a ROS member, suggesting it originates as a
  “sink” for the constitutive NOS released NO. Nitrite presence (upper right) in cells
  is then metabolized to form NO, under hypoxic situations, acting as a reservoir
  to continue to allow for the oxidation of NADPH. Thus, nitric oxide, an old evolutionary
  messenger, is present in the mitochondria as a critical regulatory messenger.
