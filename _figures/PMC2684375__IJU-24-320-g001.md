caption: Factors involved in the regulation of corporal smooth muscle tone. Agonists
  such as Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P), endothelin-1 (ET-1), C-type natriuretic
  peptide (CNP) Angiotensin-II (Agt-II) bind to their respective membrane receptor
  on corporal endothelial and smooth muscle cells and activate downstream signaling
  pathways most commonly through the mechanism using cyclic guanine monophosphate
  (cGMP) secondary messenger. Peptide agonists are degraded by neutral endopeptidase
  (NEP). However, in the presence of sialorphin (or the human homologues which act
  as NEP inhibitors), these agonists potentially have a prolonged effect, activating
  downstream mechanisms that result in smooth muscle relaxation. Among these downstream
  activators is Nitric Oxide (NO) synthesized from L-arginine (L-arg) by nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS) which is predominantly expressed in the endothelial cells. Nitric
  oxide diffuses into the corporal smooth muscle cells where it activates guanylate
  cyclase (GC) contributing to the intracellular pool of cGMP. One of the downstream
  effects of cGMP is the activation of Maxi-K channels though protein kinases (PK).
  Efflux of potassium from the cells causes hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle
  cell membrane, inhibiting influx of Ca2+ through calcium channels. Lowered intracellular
  calcium causes inactivation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), thereby promoting
  smooth muscle relaxation. Activation of the RhoA-GTP pathway inhibits relaxation
  and results in calcium sensitization. Some markers of endothelial cells, discussed
  in more detail below, are secreted into the plasma. These include S-1-P, ET-1 and
  assymetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). GTP = guanosine triphosphate; PKA = protein
  kinase A; PKC = protein kinase C; PKG = protein kinase G; MLC20 = myosin light chain
