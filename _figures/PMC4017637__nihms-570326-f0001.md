caption: (a) The three enzyme metabolic pathway for inosine used as a model to construct
  a didanosine pathway. (b) Comparison of the forward and retro-evolution strategies
  of pathway construction. Enzymes evolved in the forward direction proceed in the
  order of biosynthesis (ribokinase, RK; phosphopentomutase, PPM; then purine nucleoside
  phosphorylase, PNP), requiring individual screening assays for each enzymatic step
  (gray boxes). Retro-evolution requires one screening assay for terminal enzyme activity
  (orange boxes) for evolution of each enzyme in the reverse order of biosynthesis
  (PNP, PPM then RK) in increasingly tandem assays.
