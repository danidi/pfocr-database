caption: 'Apoptosis mediated by genipin through interference with myeloid cell leukemia-1
  (Mcl-1) synthesis in gastric cancer cell lines: (a) Cytokine receptors without intrinsic
  protein kinase domain amplify extracellular signals through signal transduction
  via Janus Kinase (JAK) family (JAK1 to JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2). After receptor
  activation, JAK2 phosphorylates the tyrosine residue of transcription factor Signal
  Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), which enables its binding to
  the promoter of target genes related to survival and apoptosis. Subsequently, Mcl-1
  is synthesized; (b) Genipin absorption by tumor cells induces mitochondrial dysfunction
  due to decreased Mcl-1 expression through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Δψm, mitochondrial
  membrane potential; JAK2, Janus Kinase 2; Mcl-1, myeloid cell leukemia-1; STA3,
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 [].'
