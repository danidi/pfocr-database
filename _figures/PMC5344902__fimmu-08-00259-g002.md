caption: 'Type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Type I IFNs bind to the heterodimeric
  transmembrane IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of the two subunits: IFNAR1
  and IFNAR2. The c-termini of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are associated with the tyrosine
  kinase 2 (TYK2) and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), respectively, and activation of the receptor
  transduces the phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 by tyrosine phosphorylation. This
  initiates a signaling cascade composed of proteins of the signal transducer and
  activator of transcription (STAT) family. The STAT1 and STAT2 proteins are activated
  upon JAK1 phosphorylation, dimerize and together with IRF9, form the ISG factor
  3 (ISGF3) complex. This complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated
  response elements (ISREs) in interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) promoters to initiate
  gene transcription. Signaling through IFNAR can also occur independent of IRF9 recruitment
  through STAT1 homodimers that can bind to IFN-γ-activated sites (GAS) in ISG promoters.
  Both pathways initiate transcription that promotes the induction of a range of pro-inflammatory
  mediators and enhance the antiviral state. The JAK–TYK signaling pathway can also
  promote signaling pathways independent of STAT signaling. One such pathway includes
  MAPKs, which are important for signals regulating important cellular functions such
  as gene transcription, post-transcription, apoptosis, and cell-cycle progression.
  Specifically, the p38 signaling cascade after IFN-stimulation drives transcription
  of genes that are important for inducing the antiviral effects of type I IFNs and
  are regulated by ISREs and GAS. Further to MAPK, the type I IFN receptor signaling
  can also activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. The phosphorylation
  of PI3K causes the activation of the RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1)/cAMP
  responsive-element-binding protein that can bind smad binding elements (SBE). This
  signaling pathway is believed to be important for transcription of genes controlling
  cellular survival and inflammatory (, –).'
