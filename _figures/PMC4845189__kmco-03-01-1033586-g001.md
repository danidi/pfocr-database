caption: Cholesterol uptake and metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells. The excessive
  demand for cholesterol by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells is mainly
  met through activation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)-dependent uptake,
  which prevails over the de novo synthesis pathway. First, cholesterol-rich LDLs
  are internalized via Ldlr-mediated uptake and reach the endocytic circuits, from
  where the receptor is recycled to the cell surface. LDLs are hydrolyzed and the
  resultant free cholesterol (FC) is either stored in lipid droplets after being esterified
  (i.e., cholesteryl esters or CE), transferred into plasma membranes where it resides
  in lipid rafts, or accumulated in mitochondria and/or endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  membranes. Moreover, cholesterol may be converted into oxysterols or used as a precursor
  for steroid hormone synthesis. Secondly, glucose and glutamine that are taken up
  by PDAC cells are metabolized into acetyl-CoA, which generates precursors for cholesterol
  synthesis through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme
  A reductase (Hmgcr) constitutes the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, which,
  in addition to ultimately leading to cholesterol formation, promotes isoprenoid
  production.
