caption: Regulation of signal transduction by SUMO. (A) Regulation of the Ras/MAPK
  pathway by SUMO. Upon ligand binding, a receptor tyrosine kinase dimerizes leading
  to auto-phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of the receptor activates
  a set of proteins that results in the phosphorylation of the downstream kinase MAPK.
  MAPK translocates into the cell nucleus to activate various transcription factors.
  This pathway is regulated by SUMO at multiple points. For example, in mammals SUMOylation
  of the adaptor protein GRB2 increases its affinity for the guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor SOS, and in Drosophila SUMOylation of PP2A may stimulate the removal of an
  inhibitory phosphate group from Raf. (B) Regulation of the Drosophila JNK pathway
  by Hipk and SUMOylation. When extracellular signals are sensed, a phosphorylation
  cascade results in phosphorylation of JNK proteins and their translocation into
  the nucleus to activate apoptotic genes through phosphorylation of transcription
  factors such as Jun. This process is enhanced by cytoplasmic Hipk; SUMOylation of
  Hipk results in its sequestration in the nucleus, thus reducing apoptosis. (C) Regulation
  of Drosophila Hedgehog signaling by SUMO. In the absence of Hedgehog signaling (left),
  the SUMO deconjugase Ulp1 binds Smo and removes SUMO from Smo preventing it from
  accumulating in a SUMOylated form. Smo protein is then subject to poly-ubiquitylation
  (Ub), which targets it to the proteasome for degradation. In the presence of Hedgehog
  signaling (right), Ulp1 dissociates from Smo, which therefore accumulates in a SUMOylated
  form. This leads to the recruitment of UBPY (also known as Usp8) through an interaction
  between its SIM and SUMO. UBPY is a deubiquitylase and therefore prevents accumulation
  of ubiquitylated Smo, thus preventing Smo degradation and allowing its accumulation
  on the cell surface.
