caption: 'Overview of mitochondrial energetics. A graphical overview of the mitochondrial
  energy transduction pathway. Electrons are transferred from complex carbon changes
  (sugars, proteins, fats) to carrier molecules (NAD+ and FAD+), which feed the electrons
  in the electron transport system (ETS) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
  The ETS transfers electrons across several protein complexes down a redox potential
  to oxygen. Consequently, the fall in redox potential powers the proton pumping capabilities
  of complexes I, III, and IV, which establish the proton motive force (mitochondrial
  membrane potential). The proton motive force is then used by the ATP synthase to
  drive phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP and establish the cellular energy charge
  (ATP/ADP), which powers all cellular work. Abbreviations: CoQ = ubiquinone/co-enzyme
  Q; TCA = tricarboxylic acid; ETFQOR = electron transferring flavoprotein-ubiquinone
  oxidoreducatase; Cyt C = cytochrome c. This figure was created with Biorender.com.'
