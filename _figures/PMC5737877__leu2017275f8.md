caption: Proposed model for the regulation of BATF3 by S1P signalling in HRS cells.
  S1P levels are regulated by SPHK1, which is upregulated in HRS cells and catalyses
  S1P production, and SGPP1, which is downregulated in HRS cells and degrades S1P.
  S1P acts on the S1P receptor, S1PR1 and in the absence of S1PR2 this drives the
  PI3-K/Akt signalling pathway leading to increased BATF3 expression and downstream
  aberrant transcription. S1PR1 expression is increased by BATF3 leading to a feedforward
  loop to sustain S1P signalling and constitutive BATF3 transcription.
