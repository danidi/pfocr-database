caption: Differential production of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor-activator of
  NF-κB ligand (RANKL) by B cell subsets results in higher RANKL/OPG ratio, which
  contributes to HIV-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. Osteoclasts are generated
  in a process known as osteoclastogenesis, which is driven by the key osteoclastogenic
  cytokine RANKL. Osteoclasts originate from cells of the myeloid lineage, which in
  the presence of M-CSF and RANKL differentiate into receptor-activator of NF-κB (RANK)-expressing
  pre-osteoclasts, which proliferate and fuse to form giant multinucleated osteoclasts
  capable of resorbing bone. HIV infection leads to the depletion of resting memory
  B cells and expansion of activated B cell subsets including activated memory and
  tissue-like memory B cells. Resting memory B cells produce the highest amounts of
  OPG and tissue-like memory B cells conversely the lowest amounts of OPG and the
  highest amounts of RANKL (). HIV-induced B cell subset changes therefore translate
  into higher RANKL/OPG ratios, which contribute to increased osteoclastogenesis and
  bone loss in HIV-infected patients.
