caption: The role of LMP1 in promoting survival in PTLD. LMP1 is a transmembrane protein
  consisting of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, six transmembrane-spanning
  domains and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. LMP1 shares no significant overall
  homologies with any known cellular protein. The transmembrane domains of LMP1 have
  the intrinsic feature to oligomerize spontaneously within the plasma membrane. This
  autoaggregation of LMP1 molecules mimics the crosslinking of receptors of the TNF-R
  family induced by a ligand (e.g. TNF-R1 by TNF□□□CD40 by CD40L). As a result, LMP1
  is constitutively active independent of the binding of a ligand. Three subdomains
  in the cytoplasmic C-terminus of LMP1 (CTAR 1, 2, 3) serve as platforms for the
  binding of signalling molecules and for induction of signal transduction cascades.
  Both CTAR1 and CTAR2 participate in the induction of the anti-apoptotic transcription
  factor NF-kB. CTAR1 provides a docking site for TNF-R-associated factors (TRAFs).
  CTAR1 signalling induces the non-canonical NF-kB pathway via the NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK) and the Inhibitory-kB Kinase (IKK) □. CTAR2 does not bind TRAFs directly
  but triggers the classical NF-kB pathway through direct interaction with the TNF-R-associated
  death domain protein (TRADD). TRADD, in the contest of TNF-R1 complex, normally
  signals cell death, whereas, in the context of LMP1, signals cell growth. Also the
  mitogenic c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) / activator protein 1 (AP1) pathway is
  activated by LMP1. AP1 is a dimer of JUN/JUN or JUN/FOS proto-oncoproteins. AP1
  is solely triggered at CTAR2. The JAK3/STAT signalling cascade, known to be involved
  in the control of cell proliferation, is triggered by the CTAR3 domain which is
  located between CTAR1 and CTAR2. It has been demonstrated that the p38 MAPK pathway
  is also induced by LMP1. p38 MAPK mediates cytokine induction by LMP1.
