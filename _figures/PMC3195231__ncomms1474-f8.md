caption: (1) PilA binds the extracellular matrix component collagen, which then engages
  α2β1 integrins on brain endothelium. (2) This leads to FAK activation and subsequent
  intracellular signalling. (3) Signalling pathway involving PI3K results in actin
  rearrangement and bacterial uptake. (4) A parallel signalling pathway involving
  MEK1/2 and Erk1/2 activation leads to IL-8 secretion. (5) This further results in
  functional neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. (6) Increased neutrophilic infiltrate
  damages the BBB resulting in increased BBB permeability, which likely facilitates
  further bacterial passage from the blood stream to the CNS.
