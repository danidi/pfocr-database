caption: Major metabolic pathway of flavonoids from Herba Epimedii on larval zebrafish.
  BI was the common metabolite shared by icariin, EA, EB, SA, and SB, via one or two
  steps of deglycosylation. EC was transformed into SC. But it is hard for BI and
  SC to cleave the rhamnose residue. Green arrow and wavy line mean easy deglycosylation,
  and red arrow and wavy line mean relatively hard deglycosylation process.
