caption: 'The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and O-GlcNAcylation are shown. The hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP) whose key limiting enzyme is GFAT (glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate
  amido transferase) uses 2–3% of the extracellular glucose to produce UDP-GlcNAc
  (uridine-di-phospho-N-acetyl-glucosamine), the substrate that provides the GlcNAc
  residue for the O-GlcNAcylation processes. This dynamic and reversible post-translational
  modification of nuclear and cytosolic proteins controls the target proteins fate
  according to glucose and nutrients availability: it is therefore considered as a
  nutritional sensor. A single residue of GlcNAc is transferred to a serine or a threonine
  residue of the protein by the unique O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase
  (OGA) hydrolyzes the residue. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  GlcNH26P, glucosamine-6-phosphate; GlcNAc6P: N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate; GlcNAc1P:
  N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate.'
