caption: 'Immune escape through PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in B-cell malignancies. As opposed
  to solid cancers, the malignant B lymphoma cell is also an immune cell, and its
  tumor microenvironment contains highly variable numbers of immune cells. B-cell
  malignancies arise in lymphoid tissues, and more precisely germinal center of lymph
  nodes (). Molecular dissection of the malignant B-cell allows to understand the
  progressive behavior of different B-cell lymphoma subtypes. Among genetic alterations
  contributing to immune escape is the 9p24.1 copy gain or amplification, described
  many times in inflammatory lymphomas such as HL or Primary Mediastinal B Lymphoma
  (), and correlated with overexpression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on the surface of malignant
  cells (). Two other mechanisms responsible for the malignant B lymphocyte inability
  to present tumor antigen to the CD8+ or CD4+ TLs are, respectively, loss of function
  of the gene encoding the β2-microglobulin (MHC I complex dysfunction) (, ) and the
  dysfunction of CIITA (encoding MHC II) (). PD-L1 is highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating
  macrophages and the surface of tumor cells and APCs in the tumor microenvironment
  (). In a HL model, PD-L1+ macrophages were frequently in contact with PD-1 CD4+
  TLs, suggesting that macrophages drive CD4+ TL dysfunction via PD-1/PD-L1 interactions,
  and/or by preventing direct access to Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells (). Tumor cells
  upregulate PD-L1 to dampen cytotoxic TL attack. This upregulation is a consequence
  of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by tumor infiltrating immune cells: IFNγ
  is produced by CD4+ and CD8+ TLs and acts as a potent PD-L1 upregulator (). In a
  CLL model, Beyer et al. observed a significantly increased expression of TGF-β and
  IL-10 in Tregs from patients. Both cytokines play an important role for the CD8+
  TL inhibitory function of these cells (). For example, in FL, malignant cells guide
  differentiation of CD4+ TLs, skewing the population within the tumor towards Tregs.
