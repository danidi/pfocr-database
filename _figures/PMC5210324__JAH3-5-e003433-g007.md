caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed signaling mechanism involved in irisin‐mediated
  vasorelaxation and lowering blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat
  (SHR). During exercise, the skeletal muscles release irisin into the circulation,
  which acts on arterial endothelial cells to increase AMP/ATP levels and NO release
  by activation of AMPK and Akt. The upregulation of NO ameliorates endothelial dysfunction
  and, ultimately, decreases blood pressure. Akt indicates protein kinase B; AMPK,
  AMP‐activated protein kinase; NO, nitric oxide; p, phospho.
