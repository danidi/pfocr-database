caption: 'Signaling and regulation of PRR-induced autophagy. 1. PAMP agonists stimulate
  TLRs (TLR4 and TLR7/TLR8 are depicted) leading to signaling through adaptors (TRAM–TRIF
  or MAL–MyD88) and downstream kinases (not shown – see text). 2. One molecular mechanism
  linking TLR signaling and autophagy induction is the association of Beclin 1 (a
  key regulator of autophagy) and MyD88-containing protein complexes, affecting Bcl-2–Beclin
  1 interactions: when Bcl-2 is in a complex with Beclin-1 this inhibits autophagy;
  when Bcl-2 dissociates from Beclin 1 (as shown to be the case downstream of TLR4
  signaling), Beclin-1 (along with other Atg factors and type III PI3K hVPS34, not
  shown) is free to initiate autophagy. 3. Autophagy can act as a topological inversion
  device delivering PAMP molecules to endosomal TLRs. Note that the topological inversion
  occurs by sequestration of cytosolic PAMPs (e.g. from a replicating virus) into
  the autophagosome, in which they now are in organellar lumen, which puts them topologically
  on the same side of the membrane as the receptor domain of endosomal TLRs. 4. PGRP-LE,
  a Drosophila PRR, reacts to bacterial PAMPs and induces autophagy as an innate immunity
  output protecting the fly from infection in vivo. 5. Inhibitory action of PAMP through
  NF-κB on autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by NF-κB has been earlier described
  in the context of TNF-α signaling. A balance between activating/amplifying pathways
  1,2, and 3, and inhibitory signaling through pathway 5 may determine the net outcome
  in terms of induction or inhibition of autophagy. These relationships have not been
  explored, but need to be delineated. 6–8, immunological outputs of PAMP–PRR–autophagy
  cascade: 6. Autophagy induced by PAMPs may result in direct elimination of offending
  microbes. 7. Autophagy assists cytosolic antigen delivery to MHC II processing and
  loading compartments, akin to the delivery of cytosolic PAMPs to the lumenal domains
  of endosomal TLRs. It is not known whether PRR-induced autophagy assists endogenous
  antigen MHC II presentation, but this can be predicted from the depicted circuitry.
  8. Autophagy may inhibit IL-1β activation or secretion; it is not known whether
  autophagy acts on inflammasome, an apparatus that processes inactive pro-IL-1β and
  secretes it as active IL-1β, normally activated by PAMPs or danger-associated molecular
  patterns (DAPMs) – body’s own molecules also known as ‘alarmins’ capable of inducing
  inflammation and defenses. 9. When individual PAMP–PRR pairs do not activate autophagy,
  it is possible that a combinatorial engagement of multiple PRRs may be needed to
  activate autophagy (as shown for TLR2/6 plus Dectin). Green arrows and boxes, positive
  regulatory pathways and molecules; Red arrows and letters, negative regulatory pathways;
