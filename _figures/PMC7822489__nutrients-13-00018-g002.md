caption: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) regulation by caloric intake. High caloric
  intake increases FGF23, while caloric restriction decreases FGF23. The mechanisms
  of FGF23 regulation by caloric intake include a direct effect on bone, mediated
  through the mTOR signalling pathway, and indirect mechanisms, mainly through renal
  α-klotho regulation. Other indirect mechanisms that may influence FGF23 comprise
  the inflammatory/anti-inflammatory action of high vs. low caloric intake.
