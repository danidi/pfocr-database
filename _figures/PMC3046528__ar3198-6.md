caption: Mechanisms of monosodium urate (MSU)-mediated inflammation and the roles
  of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Nlrp3. MSU signals activate Nlrp3 inflammasome.
  Syk plays important roles in both pro-IL1β synthesis and Nlrp3 activation in response
  to MSU. Pro-IL1β synthesis occurs through the Syk-Card9 pathway. However, Nlpr3
  activation is regulated through a Syk-dependent, mostly Card9-independent mechanism.
  Card9, caspase recruitment domain 9; IL1β, interleukin-1-beta; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa-B;
  Nlrp3, NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3; SH2, Src homology 2.
