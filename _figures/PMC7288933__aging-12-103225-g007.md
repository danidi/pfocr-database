caption: A summary diagram is shown. In the brain both glial and DA neurons are involved
  with iron dysfunction during the development of PD. Specifically, both increased
  levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation (main features of ferroptosis) were happened
  in the MPTP-induced monkey model, while which could be reversed by low dosage of
  CQ treatment. So ferroptosis dysfunction probably be involved in the pathogenesis
  of PD. Meanwhile, the protection effect of CQ was depending on the activation of
  the AKT/mTOR survival pathway and the prevention of p53-medicated cell death.
