caption: 'The suggested model on key paths and determinants of resistance of P. janthinellum
  strain GXCR to Cu. Indicated here are the key, but not all, paths and determinants
  for Cu delivery and signaling for tolerance to Cu, which were concluded by this
  study. The high Cu resistance follows the paths: (1) protein degradation, which
  produces nonenzymatic antioxidant of amino acids; (2) high expression of Atx1; (3)
  Cu delivery and distribution between multiple subunits of the mitochondrial CCO
  and/or between the innermembrane space and the innermembrane; (4) transport of SRPR-recognized
  NSPs to ER by the cargo proteins under Ras signaling; (5) pathways of carnitine,
  glycine betaine and choline that buffer free CoA and Acyl-CoA pool in the peroxisome;
  and (6) more active AS exerted mainly by PMSs rather than SFs positioned on the
  spliceosome pathway. The potential subcellular localization of the involved components
  were assumed by referring to the literature. All the components are given an icon.
  The blue solid circles indicate Cu ion. The dashed black arrows represent the potential
  Cu signaling routes or some unknown Cu-extruding channels. The blue solid single
  arrows represent potential routes and destination of Cu delivery. The blue solid
  double arrows indicate Cu transport in and out of the organelles. The black solid
  arrow indicate the mRNA transport out of the nucleus. The thick solid red arrows
  indicate the metabolic events and/or the paths under high Cu. The explosive icons
  indicate the excessive ROS generated under high Cu. AS, alternative splicing; CaM,
