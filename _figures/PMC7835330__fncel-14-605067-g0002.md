caption: Schematic diagram showing melatonin/dopamine-mediated circadian clock pathway
  in the fish retina. Previous work has shown that a circadian clock in the retina
  increases melatonin synthesis and release during the night, which inhibits the release
  of dopamine from dopaminergic amacrine cells sufficiently so that D4Rs on photoreceptor
  cells are not activated. In contrast, the retinal clock decreases melatonin in the
  day, which enhances dopamine release, resulting in volume diffusion of dopamine
  throughout the retina and activation of D4Rs on rods and cones. This decreases intracellular
  cAMP and PKA activity levels in photoreceptors, which lowers the conductance of
  rod-cone gap junctions so that rod input to cones and cHCs is reduced.
