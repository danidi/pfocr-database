caption: 'Canonical wingless/int-1signaling pathway. Three complexes are involved
  in the dynamic activating event: (1) the cell-surface receptor complex; (2) the
  destruction complex in the cytoplasm; and (3) the CTNNB1/TCF/LEF transcriptional
  complex in the nucleus. In a normal steady state, there are two pools for CTNNB1
  in cells. One is known to interact with CDH1 at the cell-cell junction. The second
  is present in the destruction complex in cytoplasm, which is assembled by the scaffold
  proteins AXIN, APC, GSK3β, and CSNK1A1. CSNK1A1 and GSK3β phosphorylate CTNNB1 in
  the AXIN complex. Phosphorylated CTNNB1 is subsequently recognized and ubiquitinated
  by BTRC. In the absence of nuclear CTNNB1 translocated from the cytoplasm, TCF/LEF
  proteins bind to DNA and act as transcriptional repressors by binding to TLE1 proteins.
  These in turn interact with histone deacetylases whose activities lead to the transcriptional
  silence of chromatin. The binding of Wnts to FZDs, which form the cell-surface receptor
  complex, promotes the binding of scaffold proteins such as DVL to the FZD intracellular
  domains. This subsequently induces the aggregation and phosphorylation of LRP6 and
  the translocation of AXIN. Phosphorylated LRP6 also recruits AXIN to LRP6 on the
  plasma membrane. This allows AXIN to be inactivated, which then inhibits CTNNB1
  phosphorylation. This in turn allows CTNNB1 to escape degradation, accumulate in
  the cytoplasm, and translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, CTNNB1 interacts
  primarily with members of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and triggers
  the activation of multiple intracellular signaling cascades. This results in the
  regulation of various cellular functions. CTNNB1: Catenin beta 1; TCF/LEF: T-cell-specific
  transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor; CDH1: Cell adhesion molecule
  cadherin 1; APC: Adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK3β: GSK3B, glycogen synthase kinase
  3 beta; CSNK1A1: Casein kinase 1 alpha 1; FZD: Frizzled class receptor; BTRC: Beta-transducin
  repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase.'
