caption: Pathways for C18 PUFA conversion to C20–22 PUFA synthesis. The pathway illustrates
  the conversion of the essential fatty acid ALA (18:3, ω 3) to the end product DHA
  (22:6, ω 3). The enzymes involved in this pathway include two fatty acid desaturases
  (FADS1 and FADS2), two fatty acid elongases (Elovl2 and Elovl5), and peroxisomal
  β -oxidation (p- β Ox). Nonesterified fatty acids are converted to fatty acyl-CoAs
  by fatty acyl CoA synthetases; the fatty acids progress through the pathway as fatty
  acyl CoAs. Humans and rodents ingesting essential fatty acid-sufficient diets accumulate
  DHA in blood and tissues. Sources of dietary ω 3 PUFA [ALA, SDA (18:4, ω 3), EPA
  (20:5, ω 3), and DHA] include plants, fish, yeast, and algae. Details of the pathway
  are presented in the text.
