caption: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) as a novel diagnostic and prognostic metabolites
  of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). The BCAAs are essential amino acids that are
  not synthesized in our body. Thus, they need to be obtained from food or produced
  by gut microbiota. At the level of peripheral tissues, mainly in muscle and adipose
  tissue, in the mitochondria BCAAs are catabolized. The first step is a transamination
  reaction performed by the mitochondrial isoform of branched-chain amino acid transaminase
  (BCTm). Then, they are oxidized by the multienzyme mitochondrial branched-chain-ketoacid
  dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), that transforms the BCCAs into its relative ketoacids,
  energy substrates for the synthesis of sugars, proteins, and lipids. An alteration
  into the catabolic pathway determines an accumulation of BCCAs in the circulation,
  inducing the activation of the network of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase
  B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signal pathways.
