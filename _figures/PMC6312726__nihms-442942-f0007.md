caption: Model for the limitation of the ERK1/2 signal by PRMT5. Growth factors or
  mutated RAS activate CRAF and thereby the MAPK signaling pathway. PRMT5 promotes
  CRAF degradation and limits its catalytic activity, reducing the activation of downstream
  kinases, such as MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. In contrast, PRMT5 does not affect downstream
  signals in cells with BRAFV600E, which are independent of RAS. Decreasing PRMT5
  activity (pharmacologically or by its knockdown) increases the stability of activated
  CRAF, increasing the amplitude of the ERK1/2 signal and the integrated signal strength
  and consequently affecting the evoked biological response.
