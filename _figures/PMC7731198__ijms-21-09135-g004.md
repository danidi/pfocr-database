caption: Novel mechanism of lysostaphin resistance in ST72 isolate and its associated
  metabolic pathway. After screening all the possible genes and mutation(s) known
  for lysostaphin resistance, no existing mechanisms (genes, mutations) of lysostaphin
  resistance was found to be functioned in ST72. (A) The schematic diagram shows the
  fundamental reason of lysostaphin resistance in staphylococcal cells due to the
  modification of glycine residues of pentaglycine bridge to serine; (B) Serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) is an indispensable enzyme for the one-carbon metabolism of serine/glycine
  interconversion and is linked to folate/methionine cycle. Therefore, glyA/shmT gene
  was hypothesized to be involved in lysostaphin resistance. (C) The metabolic pathway
  showing the interdependence of folate/methionine cycle and the key role of shmT
  serine/glycine homeostasis. One-carbon metabolism is responsible for the transfer
  of methyl group to various substrate and cofactors in folate, methionine cycle,
  and transsulfuration pathways. Various enzymes are denoted in green font while the
  substrates are depicted in regular font. The abbreviation used in the pathway wherein
  enzymes are DHPS (Dihydropteroate synthase); DHFS (Dihydrofolate synthase); DHFR
  (Dihydrofolate reductase); SHMT (Serine hydroxymethyltransferase); GcvPHT (glycine
  cleavage system); MTHFR (Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase); MS (Methionine synthase);
  MAT (Methionine adenosyltransferase); MTases (Methyl transferases); AHCY (S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase), and CBS (Cystathionine beta-synthase) and substrates are THF (Tetrahydrofolate);
  5, 10 CH2-THF (5, 10 methylene tetrahydrofolate); 5-CH2-THF (5-methylene tetrahydrofolate);
  Met (Methionine); SAM (S-adenosyl methionine); SAH (S-adenosyl homocysteine), and
  HCY (Homocysteine). One-carbon metabolism is important in cellular homeostasis by
  maintaining cellular seine/glycine through folate cycle, methionine cycle (protein
  synthesis), DNA synthesis and repair, redox balance, and various methylation reactions.
