caption: Proposed model of the gibberellin/DELLA pathway in plant–insect interactions.
  Caterpillar labial salivary secretions delay or suppress induced plant defences.
  The underlying mechanism involves cross-talk between plant signalling pathways.
  DELLA proteins are involved in the labial saliva-dependent suppression of the jasmonate
  burst. In response to caterpillar herbivory, DELLA proteins suppress laccase-like
  multicopper oxidase activity and positively regulate glucosinolate biosynthesis.
  Arrows indicate positive effects, bar-headed lines represent inhibitory effects,
  and dashed lines indicate putative interactions. GA, gibberellin; JA, jasmonates;
  JAZ, jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins; NPR1, nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related protein
  1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SA, salicylic acid. (This figure is available in
  colour at JXB online.)
