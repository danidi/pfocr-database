caption: UVB stimulates the production of PAF and ox-GPCs via reactive oxygen species,
  which then act upon the keratinocyte PAF-R resulting in MVP formation and release.
  This model denotes that this process of UVB-MVP production could be potentially
  inhibited by antioxidants, PAF-R antagonists, as well as by agents that could possibly
  interrupt the MVP formation in response to PAF-R activation (e.g., MAPK inhibitors).
