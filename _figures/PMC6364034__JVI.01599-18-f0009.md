caption: Working model illustrating that KSHV hijacks the citrulline-NO cycle to promote
  KSHV-induced cell proliferation and cellular transformation. Multiple KSHV miRNAs
  upregulate ASS1 expression to maintain intracellular NO levels and STAT3 activation,
  which is essential for KSHV-induced cell proliferation and cellular transformation.
