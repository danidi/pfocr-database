caption: The crosstalk between perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and the blood vessel
  modulates vascular function. PVAT releases vasoactive molecules. H2S is synthesized
  in PVAT and induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hyperpolarization. Leptin
  activates eNOS and stimulates H2S production, which lead to endothelium-dependent
  vasodilatation. H2S released from endothelium and PVAT functions as an endothelium-derived
  hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and activates endothelial K+ channels. The resulting
  hyperpolarization of endothelial cells can be transmitted to VSMC. NO and H2O2 released
  from PVAT can elicit vasodilatation by activating soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC).
  Adiponectin produced by PVAT stimulates NO production in PVAT and in endothelial
  cells and induces VSMC hyperpolarization. Ang 1–7 acts on endothelial cells and
  stimulates endothelial NO production. Vasodilating prostaglandins released from
  PVAT can act on VSMC and stimulate vasorelaxation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  produced from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases in PVAT
  can cause contractile response in VSMC via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway. Other potential PVAT-derived contracting
  factors have been suggested, including chemerin, calpastatin, and norepinephrine.
  Antioxidant enzymes SOD and catalase in PVAT can detoxify ROS to produce H2O2, which
  can stimulate vasodilation. Cytokines released from PVAT, including TNF-α, MCP-1
  and TGF-β can lead to VSMC proliferation. MAPK/ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; Ang, angiotensin; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase;
