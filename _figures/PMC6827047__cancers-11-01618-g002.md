caption: 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor efficiency based on mutational
  status—cause of resistance and weak spots. Treatment resistance is a reoccurring
  problem in the case of MAPK pathway inhibitors. The post-treatment acquirement or
  selection of tumor cells with new mutations renders the treatment useless. In the
  case of KRAS, BRAF, and MEK inhibitors, mutations in any of these two components
  can determine therapeutic resistance and relapse. Targeting ERK can become a true
  Achilles heel in treating cancers with MAPK signaling alterations, as ERK inhibitors
  target specifically downstream of the signaling cascade, with no regard of the mutational
  status of the upstream components (e.g., KRAS and BRAF) (KRAS: Kirsten rat sarcoma
  viral oncogene homolog; BRAF: B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase; ERK:extracellular
  regulated MAP kinase).'
