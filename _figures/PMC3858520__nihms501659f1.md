caption: a) The classic view of opioid reward suggests that opioids bind to neuronal
  opioid receptors resulting in the eventual activation of the cortico-mesolimbic-dopamine
  reward pathway and the presentation of associated reward behaviors. In this model,
  glia, such as astrocytes and microglia, are not accounted for, beyond their homeostatic
  roles.b) The recent appreciation of non-neuronal actions of opioids and opioid-induced
  proinflammatory glial activation necessitates additions to the solely neuronal hypotheses
  of opioid reward. The wealth of information of neuronal signaling and adaptations
  that occurs following opioid exposure and neuronal opioid receptor activation can
  now be complimented by the parallel TLR4-dependent activation of central immune
  signaling, and alteration of neuronal excitability due to a collection of opioid-TLR4
  dependent glial adaptations. Collectively, the neuronal opioid receptor-dependent
  and complementary opioid-TLR4 dependent mechanisms produce a heightened opioid reward
  signal and ensuing presentation of altered behavior.
