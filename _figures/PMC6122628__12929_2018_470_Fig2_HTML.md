caption: HUWE1-mediated proliferation/differentiation. a HUWE1 is regulated by WNT
  and ubiquitinates Dvl via K63-linkage, which subsequently inhibits multimerization
  of Dvls, contributing to the negative feedback loop in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  b HUWE1 is able to enhance tumor proliferation by K63-ubiquitinating c-Myc, which
  facilitates the recruitment of CBP/p300, therefore enhancing the transactivation
  activity of c-Myc. HUWE1 sustains normal ovarian epithelial cell transformation
  and tumor growth by ubiquitinating histone H1.3. Ubiquitinated H1.3 is subsequently
  degraded, releasing H1.3 from the imprinting control region (ICR) of the distal
  promoter region of an oncogenic non-coding RNA, H19. HUWE1 also mediates K48-linked
  polyubiquitination of N-myc and facilitates its degradation. Loss of N-myc can arrest
  proliferation via cell cycle and begin differentiation in neural stem/progenitor
  cells. Loss of N-myc by HUWE1 can also disrupt the neural stem cell activity through
  the DLL3-Notch pathway in the mouse cortex. In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
  loss of HUWE1 increases N-myc-dependent proliferation and thus HUWE1 is a key regulator
  in the maintenance and lymphoid commitment of HSCs. c HUWE1 regulates SHH-type medulloblastoma
  (MB) via ubiquitinating and controlling Atoh1 protein turnover. Atoh1, a crucial
  basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor for granule neuron progenitors (GNPs),
  inhibits neuronal differentiation and enhances MB formation
