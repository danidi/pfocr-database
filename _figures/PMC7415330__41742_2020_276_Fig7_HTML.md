caption: 'Schematic representation of a simplified narrative scenario model of uncontrolled
  dysregulated DAMP-promoted pathways in light of the exposome and AOP concepts. The
  figure illustrates the sequelae of key events proposed to leading to fibrotic disorders
  (organ fibrosis), reflecting the adverse outcome. The stress/injury → DAMP-promoted
  dysregulated pathways leading to immune diseases start with the sequelae of events
  (MIE → KE3→n) as described for the controlled pathway (Fig. ). However, instead
  of proceeding to homeostatic events, the DAMP-induced pathways now provoke “pathogenic”
  KEs key events resulting in an AO in terms of fibrotic disorders. The triggering
  “aberrant” event is the fifth KE that refers to (uncontrolled) chronic inflammation
  as characterized by the failure of an inflammation-resolution response (= “nonresolving
  inflammation”), proceeding to fibrogenic responses (fibrogenesis). The adverse outcome
  refers to complete organ fibrosis associated with typical organ-specific clinical
  symptoms. AO adverse outcome, DAMPs damage-associated molecular patterns, ECM extracellular
