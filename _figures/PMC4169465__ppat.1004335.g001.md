caption: 'Plasma Tf-iron is taken up by the Tf/TfR pathway, and NTBI by the metal
  transporters DMT1, Zip8, or Zip14 on the apical plasma membrane of capillary endothelial
  cells and transported across the basolateral membrane to brain interstitial fluid
  and CSF by the coupled action of Fpn and the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (Cp) secreted
  by astrocytes. Cp oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+ that binds CSF Tf or circulates as NTBI.
  Astrocytes lack TfR and utilize NTBI that requires reduction to Fe2+ by FR proteins
  dcytb, steap3, or PrPC before uptake by metal transporters. Microglia store iron
  released from phagocytosed cells and excess NTBI in the extracellular milieu in
  ferritin. Neurons take up Tf-iron by the Tf/TfR pathway, and NTBI through metal
  transporters as in astrocytes. Oligodendrocytes synthesize and utilize Tf-iron and
  also take up ferritin iron by the Tim-2 receptor. Internalized iron contributes
  to the cytosolic labile iron pool for metabolic purposes and excess is oxidized
  and stored in ferritin. Most cells express Fpn, and export excess Fe2+ through the
  coupled action of Fpn and Cp. Cp: ceruloplasmin; DMT1: divalent metal transporter
  1; F: ferritin; Fpn: ferroportin; FR: ferrireductase; NTBI: non-transferrin bound
  iron; Tf: transferrin; TfR: transferrin receptor.'
