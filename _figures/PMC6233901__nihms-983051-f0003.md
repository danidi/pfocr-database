caption: Comparison of the type II FAS and PKS pathways. Both the FAS and the PKS
  pathways begin with utilizing AcpS and FabD to generate its own malonyl-ACP. They
  start to diverge when entering the elongation cycle, in which the aromatic PKS pathway
  (red) only requires KS-CLF to produce polyketides while the polyene PKS pathway
  (blue) and FAS pathway (green) involve a NADPH-dependent ketoreductase (KR, or FabG
  in FAS) to reduce the β-carbonyl and a dehydratase (DH, or FabA and FabZ in FAS)
  to dehydrate the β–hydroxyacyl. The enoyl intermediate of the FAS pathway can subsequently
  be either reduced by the NADH-dependent FabI (dark green) or isomerized to its cis
  form by FabA (light green) before being further elongated by a ketoacylsynthase
  (FabF or FabB ). The latter pathway (light green) leads to the formation of unsaturated
  fatty acids.
