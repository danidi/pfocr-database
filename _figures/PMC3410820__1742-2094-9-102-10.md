caption: Proposed pathways involved in the neuroprotective effects of telmisartan.
  The pro-inflammatory effects of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in neurons are the consequence
  of binding to its IL-1R1 receptor, which in turn increases NADPH oxidase activation,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun
  activation, and IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) gene expression. This results in enhanced
  expression of COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Telmisartan abrogates these pro-inflammatory
  effects of IL-1β by mechanisms involving inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation
  and the JNK/c-Jun pathway.
