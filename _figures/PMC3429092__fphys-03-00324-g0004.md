caption: Model for TRPC5-mediated feedback of Ca2+ and NO signaling in endothelial
  cells and attenuation of Ca2+ entry through TRPC6 by NO in smooth muscle cells.
  Stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (such as the ATP-activated P2Y
  receptor) induces Ca2+ influx and activation of eNOS as a consequence of binding
  of Ca2+-CaM and release of eNOS from caveolin-1. TRPC5 undergoes eNOS-dependent
  S-nitrosylation after GPCR stimulation, resulting in amplified Ca2+ entry and secondary
  activation of eNOS to amplify production of NO. NO diffuses out of endothelial cells
  into adjacent smooth muscle cells and stimulates the guanylate cyclase, which leads
  to the activation of PKG in smooth muscle cells. In the most prevailing hypothesis,
  the magnitude of continuous Ca2+ influx through VDCC, which critically determines
  the contractile status of vascular smooth muscle cells, decreases and increases
  by membrane hyperpolarization and depolarization, respectively. TRPC6 likely functions
  as a depolarization (Δψ)-inducing channel or a direct Ca2+-entry pathway, activated
  in response to receptor stimulation. The NO/cGMP/PKG pathway suppresses TRPC6 and
  VDCC activity to induce relaxation of smooth muscle.
