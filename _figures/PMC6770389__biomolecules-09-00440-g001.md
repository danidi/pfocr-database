caption: 'The infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) induced the changes
  of glucose metabolism in the cellular transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomics
  of Chinese perch brain cell line (CPB) cells at its replication cycle. Changes in
  the levels of enzymes of genes (rhombus), proteins (ellipses), and metabolites (rectangles)
  relative to control controls are color-coded to represent upregulation (red) or
  downregulation (green). Colorless boxes indicate that no difference was detected.
  Transcriptome date were collected from three groups of parallel samples of CPB cells
  using RNA-Seq. Proteomics date were collected from three groups of parallel samples
  of CPB cells using iTRAQ proteomics. Metabolomics data were collected from six groups
  of parallel samples of CPB cells using LC-MS. Numeric values for the transcriptomic
  and proteomic data are given in Hu et al. [] and Wu et al. []. Abbreviations: Glucose
  (Glu), Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), Fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
  (F1,6BP), Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P); 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), 2-phosphoglycerate
  (2-PG), Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), Pyruvate, Acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA), Glutamine (Gln),
