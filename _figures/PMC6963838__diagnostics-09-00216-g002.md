caption: Canonical miRNA genesis and processing pathway. The miRNA gene is transcribed
  in the nucleus from intronic, intergenic, or polycistronic loci by RNA polymerase
  II or III and forms a transcript that is called primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). pri-miRNA
  hairpins are double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures cleaved by Drosha, an RNAse
  III-type enzyme, and Pasha, also known as DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene
  8 (DGCR8), to form a 70–100 nucleotide long precursor (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNA hairpin
  is transported to cytoplasm by the exportin-5 and RanGTP cofactor and then processed
  by the Dicer complex, another RNase III enzyme, into a miRNA:miRNA duplex. The unwinding
  of the duplex forms the 18–23 nt mature miRNA. One strand of the duplex binds to
  Ago and forms RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Once loaded, the RISC can target
  and induce mRNA negative expression by cleavage, translational inhibition or destabilization
  and degradation.
