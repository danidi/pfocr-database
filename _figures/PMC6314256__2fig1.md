caption: Roles and regulation of PAH1-encoded PA phosphatase in lipid synthesis. The
  expression of the PAH1 gene that encodes the PA phosphatase protein Pah1 is regulated
  throughout growth by nutrient status. Pah1 in the cytosol is phosphorylated by multiple
  protein kinases during vegetative growth when the synthesis of phospholipids occurs
  at the expense of TAG. As cells progress into stasis, the phosphorylated Pah1 (pink
  circles) translocates to the ER membrane through its dephosphorylation by the Pah1
  phosphatase, which is composed of Nem1 (catalytic subunit) and Spo7 (regulatory
  subunit). Dephosphorylated Pah1 that is associated with the ER membrane catalyzes
  the conversion of PA to DAG, which is then acylated to form TAG that is stored in
  lipid droplets (LD). Dephosphorylated Pah1 or PKC-phosphorylated Pah1 that is not
  phosphorylated at the seven target sites for Pho85-Pho80 protein kinase is degraded
  by the proteasome (dashed line arrows). PA is also utilized for the synthesis of
  membrane phospholipids via the CDP-DAG pathway, and it has signaling functions (green).
  When the CDP-DAG pathway for phospholipid synthesis is blocked, phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) may be synthesized from the DAG derived from
  the PA phosphatase reaction if cells are supplemented with choline (Cho) or ethanolamine
  (Etn) via the Kennedy pathway. PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine.
