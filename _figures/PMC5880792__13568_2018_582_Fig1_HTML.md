caption: Schematic drawing of the flow of phosphoryl groups through the Sln1 pathway
  of S. cerevisiae in the wild-type version and with a LOV-histidine kinase fusion
  protein replacing the Sln1 kinase. The left-hand panel shows the flow of phosphoryl
  groups under wall-stress conditions (maximal activity of native Sln1) and in the
  dark (maximal activity of the C1, fusion protein). The right-hand panel shows the
  absence of flow of the phosphoryl groups in the presence of osmotic stress (for
  the native Sln1) and upon illumination (for the C1 fusion protein). The C1 fusion
  protein is most active in the dark. This leads to phosphorylation of the Ssk1 and
  Skn7 response regulators via transfer of the phosphoryl group through the Ypd1 phospho-transfer
  protein. Phosphorylation of Ssk1 renders it inactive in its role in the HOG1 pathway.
  Phosphorylation of Skn7 leads to activation of Skn7-dependent genes, such as the
  mannosyl-transferase, OCH1. Osmotic stress and illumination lead to reduction in
  the kinase activity of Sln1 and the C1 fusion protein, respectively, and therefore
  accumulation of the kinase domain of Sln1 in the dephosphorylated form. This causes
  de-phosphorylation of the Ssk1 response regulator, which can interact with and activate
  Ssk2 and the Ssk22 kinases of the HOG pathway. Phosphorylation of HOG1 leads to
  its translocation into nucleus and activation of the genes responsible for osmotic-stress
  regulation (Fassler and West ; Gao and Stock )
