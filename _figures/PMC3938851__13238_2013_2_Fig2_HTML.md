caption: Manipulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway can promote lifespan extension
  and healthy aging. As a central energy sensor, the mTORC1 signaling pathway is regulated
  by various upstream signals such as nutrients, growth factor signaling, and caloric
  restriction (CR), leading to altered Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial
  function and autophagic activity, which play critical roles in aging
