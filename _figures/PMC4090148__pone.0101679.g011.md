caption: This model is based on our (12) and others previous published work and current
  data presented in this article. RASSF1C activates the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway (12), which
  controls a wide variety of genes that promote cell division and proliferation. Over-expression
  of RASSF1C up-regulates Piwil1 gene expression (12). Treatment of H1299 lung cancer
  cells with the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor CI1040 resulted in down-regulation of
  Piwil1 mRNA levels (12). PIWIL1 is widely over-expressed in tumors compared to normal
  tissue, and it may have important functions in cancer initiation, maintenance, or
  progression (increased epigenetic gene modification, proliferation and cell migration,
  and reduced apoptosis). PIWI-like proteins have been shown to interact with PIWI-interacting
  RNAs (piRNAs) to form complexes that regulate transcriptional and translational
  repression leading to inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of cell division and
  proliferation, and down-regulation of cyclin inhibitors and tumor suppressors (18).
  Over-expression of PIWIL1 down-regulates IGFBP-5 (18), which is an interacting partner
  and inhibitor of RASSF1C (19). Thus, co-expression of RASSF1C and IGFBP-5 abrogates
  the up-regulation of PIWIL1 expression in response to increased RASSF1C, suggesting
  that IGFBP-5 could block RASSF1C actions through the ERK1/2 pathway resulting in
  reduced PIWIL1 expression and function. Also, RASSF1C mRNA expression is regulated
  by AMP and ATM kinases. Various key components of the proposed RASSF1C pathway will
  be tested to validate this model.
