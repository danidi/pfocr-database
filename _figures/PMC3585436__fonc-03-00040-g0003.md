caption: p110δ PI3K pathway in B cells. Engagement of BCRs by antigen induces the
  phosphorylation of ITAMs in the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-α and Ig-β by Lyn leading
  to recruitment and activation of Syk via ITAMs and to initiation of downstream signaling
  cascade. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the co-receptor CD19 and BCAP recruits p110δ
  PI3K through SH2 interactions leading to production of PI(3,4,5)P3 which recruits
  PH-domain containing proteins such as Akt, Btk, and PLCγ2. Akt controls the activity
  of multiple signaling molecules and pathways such as the mTORC1, GSK-3, and the
  NF-kB pathway. Btk phosphorylates and activates PLCγ2 which then catalyzes the hydrolysis
  of PI(4,5)P2 yielding I(3,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). I(3,4,5)P3 initiates
  Ca2+ mobilization and DAG induces the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms.
  The p110δ PI3K also functions downstream of the cytokine receptors BAFFR and IL6R,
  which are activated by BAFF and IL-6, respectively, derived from lymphoid stromal
  cells, and downstream of the IL4R which is activated by IL-4 derived from T cells.
  Chemokine receptors (CXCR5) and co-stimulatory receptors (CD40, TLRs) also induce
  the activation of p110δ PI3K in B cells.
