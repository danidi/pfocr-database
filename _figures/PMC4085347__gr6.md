caption: Schematic presentation of MRN complex recruitment towards radiation induced
  DNA damage foci. The MRN complex initiates a cascade of phosphorylation events,
  which activate DNA damage response (DDR) protein kinases for cell cycle arrest during
  repair. Ionizing radiation induced foci (RIF) on DNA generated due to the phosphorylation
  of conserved histone H2A variant, H2AX at serine 139 residue []. The phosphorylated
  form ?-H2AX covered the large region of chromatin including the damaged site per
  DNA within the few minutes and reached at peak in 30 min of IR exposure []. The
  C-terminal of NBS1 101 amino acid sequences are the strongly interacting sites for
  Mre11 as well as are the sites for attachment of ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM),
  an another DNA repair protein []. The MRN mediated DNA end processing also generates
  small ssDNA oligomers due to the endonuclease activity of Mre11 subunit []. Under
  normal conditions, ATM dimer composition (inactive form) exits within the cytoplasm
  whereas DDR initiate autophosphorylation at ser-1981 residue of ATM. In reverse,
  ATM phosphorylated the MR bound NBS1 subunit at ser-343 residue. The phosphorylation
  events form an active MRN–ATM complex. The MRN–ATM complex binds to the RIF to stimulate
  the downstream DDR pathway. At the same time, several other protein kinases also
  are recruited towards RIF i.e. mediator of DNA damage CHK1 (MDC1), binding protein1
  (53BP1) which directly link up with the ?H2AX foci. The phosphorylated ATM is attached
  with FHA domain of MDC1 protein that primarily holds the ?-H2AX with its other domain
  BRCT. The activated ATM phosphorylated the cell cycle checkpoint 2 (Chk2) at Ther-68
  residue. The phosphorylated Chk2 mediated cdc25C phosphorylation at ser-216 residue
  inhibited the cdk1 activity and thus arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase.
  ATM-Chk2 association also phosphorylate ser-20 residue of p53, thereby activating
  the apoptosis of severely injured unrepaired DNA. ATM mediated direct phosphorylation
  of p53–p21 complex at multiple sites helps in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest at
  the G1 phase.
