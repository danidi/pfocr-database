caption: NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in relation to gene transcription.
  DNA is typically inaccessible to transcription complexes as it is tightly wound
  around histone proteins. Once acetylated (usually by an acetylase enzyme that attaches
  an acetyl group to a lysine residue on the histone protein), the DNA becomes physically
  available for transcription, as noted in the figure by the larger gaps between the
  histones. NAD+-dependent HDAC enzymes (Sirt1 shown here) effectively reverse this
  process by catalytically removing acetyl groups from lysine residues, thereby tightening
  the DNA/histone complexes. These enzymes require NAD+ and an acetylated lysine as
  cofactors for activation. Therefore, the presence of NAD+ promotes enzyme activity,
  while the presence of the cleavage product of the deacetylation reaction, nicotinamide
  (NAM), inhibits it. In the case of protein activation, the NAD+-dependent HDAC acts
  by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues directly from the protein. This may
  activate or inhibit the protein, depending on the particular context (see ).
