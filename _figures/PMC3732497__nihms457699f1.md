caption: In systems implementing feedback control, the deviation of a measured output
  from a desired set-point is assessed. A control algorithm uses this value to compute
  a corrective action, which when input into the system, regulates its output to the
  desired set value. Natural and engineered biological systems make use of this type
  of homeostatic feedback control. (A) The yeast osmoregulation system demonstrates
  feedback control. Disturbances to extracellular osmolarity cause a change in turgor
  pressure from a steady-state value. Deviation from this value activates MAPK signaling
  and Hog1 nuclear import, which in turn activates Hog1-dependent synthesis of glycerol.
  Glycerol accumulation restores the turgor pressure to its pre-perturbation value.
  (B) The FAEE biosynthetic pathway has been engineered in E. coli to exhibit homeostatic
  feedback control. In this system, accumulation of fatty acyl-coA is sensed by fadR
  which adjusts the expression of enzymes, allowing for greater production of FAEE.
  Increased consumption of fatty acyl-coA during FAEE production reduces fatty acyl-coA
  levels, therefore enacting a negative feedback loop.
