caption: Therapeutic targeting of the CD47-SIRPα pathway can cause elimination of
  cancer cells through multiple mechanisms. First, inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα interaction
  with a blocking anti-CD47 antibody, a blocking anti-SIRPα antibody, or a recombinant
  SIRPα protein (depicted here as a bivalent Fc-fusion protein) leads to phagocytic
  uptake of tumor cells by macrophages. Second, an anti-CD47 antibody can eliminate
  tumor cells through traditional antibody Fc-dependent mechanisms including NK cell-mediated
  ADCC and CDC. Third, anti-CD47 antibody may directly stimulate apoptosis of tumor
  cells through a caspase-independent mechanism. Fourth, anti-CD47 antibody may enable
  phagocytic uptake of tumor cells by DCs and subsequent antigen presentation to CD4
  and CD8 T cells, thereby stimulating an anti-tumor adapative immune response. mAb=monoclonal
  antibody.
