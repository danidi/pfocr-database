caption: In the presence of oxygen or sterols, Sre1 is retained in the ER by the sterol
  sensor Scp1. Additionally, Sre1N produced from basal cycling is bound by Ofd1 and
  degraded. In the absence of oxygen or sterols, Sre1-Scp1 traffics to the Golgi where
  the Dsc E3 ligase complex, the rhomboid protease Rbd2, and Cdc48 are required for
  Sre1 cleavage and Sre1N release. Also under low oxygen, Ofd1 is inhibited by Nro1,
  releasing Sre1N to enter the nucleus and upregulate its own transcription as well
  as additional hypoxic responsive genes.
