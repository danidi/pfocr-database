caption: A working model of CUL4B-mediated FOXO3A degradation and cell apoptosis in
  lung cancer. The FOXO3a located in the nucleus promotes transcription of apoptosis-related
  genes such as Bim. CUL4B downregulates FOXO3 by promoting ERK phospho-activation
  (pERK) and subsequent phosphorylation of FOXO3A (p-FOXO3A), which is subject to
  degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the mechanism of
  CUL4B-mediated ERK activation still needs to be identified. It also remains possible
  that, as a key component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase machinery, the CUL4B complex
  may directly control FOXO3A stability.
