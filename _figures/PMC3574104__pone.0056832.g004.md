  . The CPTs of  in the two Bayesian networks do not have a same form, so they need
  to be extended. After extending the CPTs, the two Bayesian networks' structures
  and every corresponding CPTs' forms are completely the same(as shown in  and , the
  dashed edges represent bogus edges), and then the aggregation function can be applied
  to aggregate the conditional probabilities in corresponding positions of each corresponding
  CPTs. For example, . In the combined Bayesian network as shown in , we need to use
  variance to test 's two parent nodes, , , so  is a bogus parent. Then the CPT of  need
  to be simplified and the bogus edge  should be deleted. The consensus Bayesian network
  is shown in .
