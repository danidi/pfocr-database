caption: a | Under unstimulated conditions, newly synthesized NF-κB-inducing kinase
  (NIK) is rapidly bound by TNFR associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and targeted for ubiquitylation
  (Ub) by the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP)–TRAF2–TRAF3 E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex. The continuous degradation of NIK in the proteasome prevents NIK accumulation
  and non-canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation. b | Ligation of
  specific TNFR superfamily members by their ligands (TNF family members) stimulates
  the recruitment of TRAF2, TRAF3, cIAP1 and cIAP2 (shown as cIAP in the figure) to
  the receptor complex, in which activated cIAP mediates K48 ubiquitylation and proteasomal
  degradation of TRAF3, resulting in stabilization and accumulation of NIK and the
  induction of p100 processing, followed by the translocation of NF-κB p52–RELB heterodimers
  into the nucleus. Receptor-mediated non-canonical NF-κB activation is negatively
  regulated via TRAF3 deubiquitylation by OTUD7B and phosphorylation-dependent degradation
  of NIK is mediated by IκB kinase-α (IKKα) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)–. c |
  Complement membrane activation complex (MAC) activates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway
  via a TRAF-independent mechanism that involves the formation of an endosome-based
  signalling complex containing MAC, the kinase AKT and NIK, in which activated AKT
  mediates NIK stabilization. NLRP12, NACHT, LRR and PYD domain-containing protein
