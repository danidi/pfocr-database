caption: Overview of the CO2 fixation pathway and predicted enzymes for mannitol metabolism
  in E. huxleyi. Regular and bold italic indicate metabolites and enzymes or metabolic
  pathways, respectively. Metabolites in red were detected in the current study. Other
  metabolites except for pyruvate and mannose are hardly detected by GC-MS analysis.
  The proteins showing significant homology to known enzymes are listed close to the
  enzyme name. Protein IDs are taken from JGI Emiliania huxleyi CCMP1516 main genome
  assembly v1.0. Solid and dashed arrows show single and multiple reactions, respectively.
  The reactions colored by red, blue and purple are related to manntiol biosynthesis,
  catabolism and both pathways, respectively. Ru5P, riburose-5-phosphate; RuBP, riburose
  bisphosphate; 3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; DPG, 1,3-diphosphoglycerate; GAP, glyceraldehyd-3-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; F16BP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  Pyr, pyruvate; OAA, oxaloacetate; BCAA, branched chain amino acid; PYC, pyruvate
  carboxylase; PMI, phosphomannose isomerase; PMred, phosphomannose reductase; M1PDH,
  mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase; M1Pase, mannose-1-phosphatate; MDH, mannitol
  dehydrogenase; Hxk, hexokinase.
