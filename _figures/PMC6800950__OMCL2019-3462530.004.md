caption: 'SREBP pathway mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. ER stress activates
  the SREBP pathway to maintain lipid homeostasis. NLRP3 associates with SCAP-SREBP-2
  to form a ternary complex which translocates from the ER to the Golgi, where the
  complex is cleaved by S1P and S2P. The cleaved NLRP3 can be used for inflammasome
  assembly. SREBP-2, on the other hand, stimulates NOX2 and NLRP3 expression transcriptionally
  which in turn affects the inflammasome activation process. As an important ER stress
  factor, BiP overexpression affects ER lipid metabolism via significantly inhibiting
  SREBP-2 and downstream target gene expression. SREBP: sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein; NLRP3: nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family,
  pyrin domain-containing 3; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; SCAP: SREBP cleavage-activating
  protein; S1P: site 1 protease; S2P: site 2 protease; NOX2: NADPH oxidase 2; BiP:
  binding protein.'
