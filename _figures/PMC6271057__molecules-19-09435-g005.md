caption: GSK3β and phospho-GSK3β regulate milk synthesis and DCMEC proliferation via
  the mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway. GSK3β inhibits the mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway
  involved in milk protein and fat synthesis, as well as the proliferation of DCMECs.
  The direct inhibition of GSK3β by LiCl can down-regulate GSK3β expression and promote
  GSK3β phosphorylation to activate the mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway. GSK3β downregulates
  cyclin D1 and inhibits cell growth via the mTOR/S6K1 pathway. Upregulated expression
  of lipogenic genes including ACC, SCD, and FAS through activation of SREBP1 is required
  for efficient induction of lipogenesis by the mTOR/S6K1 pathway. Rapamycin represses
  the mTOR/S6K1 pathway involved in milk synthesis and cell proliferation and reverses
  the effect of p-GSK3β.
