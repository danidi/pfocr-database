caption: Schematic diagram for HIF-1α functions in cap-dependent translation of selective
  mRNAs, cell proliferation, and tumorsphere growth of cancer cells in low O2 environment.
  Hypoxia promotes the expression of eIF4E family members eIF4E1 and eIF4E2 in breast
  cancer cells. The expression of eIF4E3 is largely inhibited in cancer cells at both
  normoxia and hypoxia. HIF-1α binds HREs in the eIF4E1 promoter region and up-regulates
  eIF4E1 expression. Increased eIF4E1 facilitates formation of eIF4E-eIF4G complex,
  elevates translation of selective mRNAs important for cancer cell adaptation to
  hypoxia stresses, and subsequently promotes cancer cell proliferation and tumorsphere
  growth at low O2 conditions. Breast cancer cells acquire resistance to hypoxia by
  uncoupling the oxygen-responsive signaling pathway from mTOR function, eliminating
  suppression of protein synthesis mediated by hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs (, ) (in
  dashed frame). Black arrows or lines are from previous reports of other groups (,
  ); blue arrows or lines are from this study. p-4E-BPs, hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BPs;
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; RHEB, Ras homolog enriched in brain.
