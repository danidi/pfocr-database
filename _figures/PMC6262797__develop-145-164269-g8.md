caption: Regulation of cranial NC cell migration through the regulation of adhesion
  properties by Ric-8A and Gα13 signalling. Ric-8A/Gα13 regulates focal adhesion proteins,
  stabilizing the protrusions at the leading edge during migration. The scheme shows
  a representation of the Ric-8A/Gα13 pathway during cranial NC migration. First,
  Gα13 is activated by a G-protein-coupled receptor bound to its ligand. Once the
  signalling is activated, the Ric-8A GEF activity maintains the monomeric Gα protein
  in an active state and dissociated from the Gβγ dimer, thereby amplifying the signal.
  In addition, Ric-8A coordinates Gα13 translocation at the leading edge of the cell,
  where Gα13 interacts with the focal adhesion complex, and regulates focal adhesion
  formation and/or turnover through FAK and Src as part of a protein complex with
  integrin (see Discussion).
