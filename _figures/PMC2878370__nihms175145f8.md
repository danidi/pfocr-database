caption: Upon interacting with the ECM (fibronectin), MDA-9/syntenin physically interacts
  with c-Src in a highly cooperative manner, with the PDZ2 being the dominant motif
  then interacting with PDZ1 resulting in the assembly of MDA-9/syntenin into a multimeric
  complexes and consequently a more stable functional unit. These interactions also
  involve binding of the NH2 terminus of MDA-9/syntenin within the COOH-terminal two
  thirds of the molecule and enables "head to tail" association (). MDA-9/syntenin
  interactions with c-Src assemble c-Src/FAK signaling complexes at high density at
  the plasma membrane and leads to activation of the p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway that regulates
  expression of genes involved in cell motility and invasion and thus plays a decisive
  role in MDA-9/syntenin-mediated tumor progression and metastasis.
