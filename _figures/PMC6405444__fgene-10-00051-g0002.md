caption: Major pathways converging on uncontrolled growth in Drosophila epithelial
  cells. The signaling pathways outlined confer growth, migration and invasive capabilities
  to epithelial cells both in vertebrates and flies. Models that mimic the growth
  of epithelial cancer cells and their ability to undergo metastasis in Drosophila
  have been established by inducing the cooperation between oncogenes (RED) like the
  active form of Ras (RasV12) together with the loss of function of cell polarity
  genes (GREEN) (Brumby and Richardson, ; Pagliarini and Xu, ). Alteration of cell
  polarity with the downregulation of the SWH (Salvador-Hippo-Warts) pathway, together
  with RasV12, triggers downstream events, including activation of the MAPK signaling
  that stabilize Myc protein (Galletti et al., ) resulting in robust cellular growth.
  Activation of the JNK signaling, with the concomitant loss of cell polarity, induces
  metalloproteases (MMP-1) and confers to the epithelial cells the distinct characteristics
  of migration and invasion, hallmarks of tumor growth (Uhlirova et al., ; Igaki et
  al., ; Ma et al., ).
