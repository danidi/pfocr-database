caption: 'Glucose provides cells with a source of Ac-CoA for fatty acid synthesis
  (blue arrows), which is enhanced in tumors due to oncogene-driven expression of
  the lipogenic enzymes ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC) and
  fatty acid synthase (FAS). However, continuous citrate export introduces a deficit
  to the TCA cycle, and this must be replaced by an anaplerotic flux in order for
  fatty acid synthesis and cell growth to continue. Metabolism of glutamine (red arrows)
  provides a mitochondrial oxaloacetate pool for continued citrate synthesis. After
  citrate cleavage by ACL in the cytoplasm, the resulting oxaloacetate can be converted
  to malate and ultimately lactate by the low NAD+/NADH ratio created by rapid glycolysis.
  Glutamine may also be converted to lactate if mitochondrial malate is exported to
  the cytoplasm and decarboxylated by malic enzyme (ME). This pathway appears to be
  a major source of NADPH for fatty acid synthesis and other activities in tumor cells.
  Abbreviations: Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA; Mal-CoA, malonyl-CoA; MDH, malate dehydrogenase;
  LDH-A, lactate dehydrogenase-A; GLS, glutaminase; SREBP-1, sterol response element
  binding protein-1.'
