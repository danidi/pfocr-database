caption: 'Hydrolytic enzymes tested in this study participate in sphingolipid metabolism
  in the lysosome as indicated by their respective gene names (blue). Homozygous or
  compound heterozygous mutations in these genes are known to cause lysosomal storage
  disorders (LSD, red) due to a deficiency in enzymatic activity. A validated multiplex
  assay for screening the activity of these enzymes was developed in Genzyme and included
  the four enzymes involved in the sphingolipid pathway as outlined: acid sphingomyelinase
  (ASM), glucocerebrosidase (GCase), acid alpha galactosidase (GLA) and galactocerebrosidase
  (GALC). The figure also depicts beta-galactosidase (GLB1). An additional lysosomal
  hydrolase acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), deficient in Pompe disease, was included
  as part of the validated multiplex assay.'
