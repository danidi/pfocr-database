caption: (A) Each Drosophila ovariole contains a string of egg chambers formed in
  the germarium as 16-cell germline cysts are enveloped by follicle cells. One germline
  cell becomes the oocyte, while the others become nurse cells. Each egg chamber goes
  through fourteen developmental stages to form a mature oocyte, with vitellogenesis
  beginning at stage 8. (B) In the germarium, GSCs occupy a niche composed of somatic
  cap cells, terminal filament cells, and escort stem cells (not shown). Cystoblasts
  are GSC daughters that give rise to germline cysts. After the cysts are surrounded
  by somatic follicle cells, they leave the germarium as newly formed egg chambers.
  (C) Each cystoblast or cyst within the germarium corresponds to a single GSC division.
  Thus, the number of germline products from a given GSC serves as a direct measure
  of their division rate. (D) The insulin pathway, which is required for the ovarian
  response to diet, has known roles in cell growth and proliferation in Drosophila.
