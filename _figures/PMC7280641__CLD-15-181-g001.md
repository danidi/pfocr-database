caption: Molecular targets of potential SARS‐CoV‐2 treatments. The spike structural
  protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to the ACE2 receptor. Once inside the cell, viral proteins
  are synthesized and intracellular RNA is amplified via an RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase.
  ACE inhibitors and ARBs, as well as HCQ, umifenovir, and camostat, may reduce viral
  particle entry and uptake by endosomes. Remdesivir, a potent nucleotide analogue,
  is believed to act as an intracellular chain terminator. After exocytosis from the
  infected cell, the host immune response is activated and characterized by high levels
  of IL‐6, IL‐1, and tumor necrosis factor. Drugs such as tocilizumab that block the
  IL‐6 signaling pathway can dampen the overly exuberant host immune response. Convalescent
  plasma may work by binding to SARS‐CoV‐2 viral particles or helping clear infected
  cells.
