caption: Pre-B-cell-receptor signaling is regulated by a feed-back loop via Ikaros
  and Aiolos. The pre-B-cell-receptor (pre-BCR)-signaling cascade also involves FOXO
  transcription factors which may act as an interface between early B-cell development
  and FLT3-signaling that is frequently altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)[].
  FOXO-proteins are also regulated by downstream signaling of BCR-ABL1[]. Disruption
  of Ikaros function by either deletions or protein interactions may interrupt the
  inhibitory feed-back loop to the pre-BCR pathway and thereby enhance pre-BCR-signaling.
