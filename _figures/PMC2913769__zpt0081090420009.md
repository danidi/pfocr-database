caption: Proposed signaling pathways through which E2 reduces BCRP transport activity
  and protein expression in brain capillaries. Pathway A was characterized previously
  (). Pathway B is described in the present study. We speculate that the two pathways
  are linked in that transporter internalization must precede proteasomal degradation.
  It remains to be determined whether PTEN/PI3K/Akt/GSK3 signaling directs internalized
  BCRP to the proteasome or whether it stimulates ubiquitination and processing of
  the protein.
