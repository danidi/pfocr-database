caption: Glucose is phosphorylated into glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase (HK)
  and utilized further in glycolysis, shaded in blue, or channelled into the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). In the oxidative branch of the PPP, shaded in green, G6P
  is converted via three subsequent steps comprising glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PDH), 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6-PGL), and 6-phosphogluocnate dehydrogenase
  (6-PGDH), resulting in the production of ribulose 5-phosphate, reduced NADPH and
  CO2. In the non-oxidative branch, shaded in lilac, ribulose 5-phosphate is converted
  by ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase (RuPE) to xylulose 5-phosphate or by ribose-5-phosphate
  isomerase (RPI) to ribose 5-phosphate. These and other sugar phosphates can be utilized
  by transketolase (TKT) and transaldolase (TAL) in reactions shuffling two or three
  carbons, respectively. Adapted from [].
