caption: Model for the coordination of DNA replication and histone production in mammalian
  cells. Exposure of cells to replication stress induces histone mRNA decay via a
  currently poorly understood pathway (top right arrow). Replication stress results
  in stabilization of slowed or stalled replication forks via a pathway involving
  ATR and Chk1 (top left arrow). Replication restart from stalled replication forks
  occurs predominantly via a pathway involving homologous recombination. At some frequency,
  replication forks either encounter complex DNA damage or fail to be stabilized by
  the ATR–Chk1 pathway, which results in replication fork collapse, generating DNA
  double-strand breaks. These may be repaired either via ATM-dependent homologous
  recombination–induced replication restart or via NHEJ mediated by DNA-PK. Failure
  of ATR signaling (such as occurs in the presence of caffeine) will result in higher
  levels of fork collapse, generating an increased level of substrate for DNA-PK–mediated
  NHEJ. Coordinated regulation of histone mRNA decay by both ATR/ATM and DNA-PK during
  replication stress ensures that, irrespective of the extent to which each pathway
  operates in any given circumstance, the supply of histones will remain closely coupled
  to the demand required for the assembly of newly synthesized chromosomes. The RNA
  helicase UPF1 involved in histone mRNA decay () may act as an effector of ATR/DNA-PK
  signaling and induce histone mRNA decay. Upon relief from replication stress, histone
  mRNA stability is restored to normal levels presumably by a mechanism linked to
  the restart of replication forks and involving changes in UPF1 phosphorylation.
