caption: 'Schematic illustration of the formation of adenomyotic lesions due to the
  endometrial–myometrial interface disruption (EMID). Iatrogenic procedures causes
  disruption at the endometrial–myometrial interface (EMI), which leads to platelet
  aggregation and the induction of HIF-1α, effectively causing tissue hypoxia. Uterine
  hyperperistalsis may also induce EMI disruption (shown in dashed arrow). As a result,
  genes involved in estrogen production are upregulated, resulting in increased local
  production of estrogen and subsequent induction of both ERα and ERβ, which, in turn,
  leads to the induction of the OT/OTR signaling and increased uterine peristalsis.
  In addition, tissue hypoxia activates TGF-β1, VEGF, PDGF, COX-2, and SDF-1 signaling
  pathways, leading to increased angiogenesis, vascularature, and the recruitment
  of BMDSCs to the wounding site. The induction of COX-2 would also increase the production
  of PGH2 and TXA2, which also enhances uterine peristalsis. Moreover, the TGF-β1
  signaling pathway induces EMT, leading to the invasion of endometrial epithelial
  cells to the EMI and further down to the myometrium. Tissue injury also would activate
  the HPA axis, leading to the release of catecholamines and PGE2, which collectively
  result in impaired cell-mediated immunity and, as such, enhances the survival of
  displaced and dispersed endometrial cells within the myometrium. All these events
  ultimately lead to the formation of adenomyotic lesions in the myometrium. Abbreviations
