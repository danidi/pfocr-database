caption: Newly-synthesized proinsulin may achieve the native state (in green), and
  when it meets all ER quality control requirements, the native proinsulin is allowed
  anterograde transport through the Golgi complex to secretory granules, where insulin
  is made and stored for release in response to glucose challenge. Newly-synthesized
  proinsulin may misfold into forms bearing non-native intramolecular or intermolecular
  disulfide bonds. These forms are “off pathway” (in red) and it is currently unknown
  if they can be returned to proper folding. Additionally, similar to that seen for
  mutant pro-AVP (see ), misfolded proinsulin can recruit innocent bystander (wild-type)
  proinsulin into aberrant protein complexes. The misfolding of proinsulin in pancreatic
  ß-cells can be detected by ER stress sensor proteins (red dotted lines). The activities
  of all three ER sensors (IRE1, PERK and ATF6) contribute to a proper ER folding
  environment for proinsulin (blue dotted lines). When the misfolded proinsulin accumulates
  in the ER (as has been observed for MIDY mutants, and in early type 2 diabetes)
  some of the misfolded molecules are likely to be degraded via ERAD and ER-phagy,
  but excessive accumulation of misfolded proinsulin is likely to trigger ß-cell failure.
