caption: Gene network of T-ALL (early response) derived from GeneMANIA (a) and STRING
  (b) (NR3C1 interaction is highlighted). (a) A gene network from GeneMANIA shows
  the relationships for genes from the list (nodes) connected (with edges) according
  to the functional association networks from the databases. (b) The figure illustrates
  the protein interaction upon querying STRING protein network (evidence view) in
  Homo sapiens with 49 proteins. Additional information from other resources can be
  retrieved for each protein and interaction. Nodes represent proteins and different
  line colours denote the type of evidence for the interaction.
