caption: (A,B). Normal breast cancer cells can give rise to primary ER+ breast tumors
  that include clonal subpopulations that harbor genomic alterations. Some of these
  clones may harbor loss of components in the MutL complex (MLH1, PMS1, PMS2) involved
  in the mismatch repair pathway (MMR) or loss of CETN2, ERCC1, and NEIL2 which are
  critical components in directing nucleotide excision and base excision repair (NER,
  BER). Other clones may contain individual prognostic mutations such as MAP3K1 or
  PIK3CA mutations which are associated with favorable prognosis, or contain TP53,
  or increasingly rare mutations in NF1 (non-sense/frameshift mutations) and DDR1,
  all three of which have been associated with poor prognosis. It is still unclear
  how NF1 and DDR1 mutations impinge on treatment resistance. (C) During disease progression,
  acquired ESR1 alterations have been identified in endocrine-refractory, metastatic
  tumors. These include ESR1 point mutations, the most common of which cluster in
  the LBD of ESR1 (Y537S and D538G) and also include the generation of in-frame ESR1
  fusions. These alterations produce constitutively active mutant proteins that are
  able to drive endocrine therapy resistance. (D) Loss of single-strand DNA damage
  repair pathways leads to uncoupling of ER-dependent activation of CDK4/6 through
  ATM and CHK2, while ESR1 mutant proteins constitutively activate the CDK4/6/Rb/E2F
  axis which leads to de-regulation of the cell cycle at the G1-S checkpoint. CDK4/6
  inhibition with palbociclib suppresses endocrine therapy resistant proliferation
  driven by both loss of single strand break repair mechanisms and ESR1 alterations.
  Activation function 1, AF1; DNA-binding domain, DBD; ligand-binding domain, LBD;
  activation function 2, AF2.
