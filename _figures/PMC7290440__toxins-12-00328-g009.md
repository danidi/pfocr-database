caption: Schematic summary of the regulators of tetanus toxin (TeNT) synthesis of
  this study. Two two-component systems (TCSs) (RS13815 and RS10155) as well as CodY
  are positive regulators. They activate the transcription of tetR and tent, only
  CodY acts directly by interacting with the promoter of tent (Ptent). In addition,
  the TCS RS04785 increases the extracellular TeNT level without or only weakly affecting
  the total synthesis by interacting with Ptent. One TCS (RS07315) is a negative regulator
  that interacts with (Ptent) and (PtetR). The TCS RS05750 has a moderate negative
  effect by weakly and indirectly decreasing tent and tetR transcription. Inorganic
  phosphate (Pi) and carbonate are environmental factors that influence TeNT synthesis
  through the TCS pathway and/or through the general metabolism.
