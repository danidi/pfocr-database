caption: 'Orange data points and linear fits result from the overexpression experiment
  (i.e., NQ1389 grown in glucose minimal medium with different induction levels of
  LacZ expression), and blue data points and fits are the leaky LacY series (i.e.,
  the WT LacY strain NQ1312 and the Leaky LacY strain NQ1313 grown in glucose minimal
  medium with 200 μM 3MBA). The y-axis denotes relative protein levels, which were
  obtained by mass spectrometry with the same reference for the two series (see Methods).
  The x-axis is the growth rate (in units of h−1). The different trends of protein
  expression for the two series show the distinct nature of the two perturbations,
  demonstrating that these seemingly similar predictions for the acetate line (parallel
  shift to slow growth as shown in  and ) for the two perturbations, have distinct
  origins and exhibit distinctly different patterns of gene expression in accordance
  with model predictions derived in section C3 of . From the perspective of gene regulation,
  it is not obvious what causes the increased expression levels of glycolysis genes
  under energy dissipation; The transcription factor Cra in combination with the key
  central carbon intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) is recognized as the
  major regulator of glycolysis. FBP relieves the repression of glycolytic enzymes
  expression by Cra. The observed increase in the abundance of glycolytic enzymes
  under energy dissipation could be caused by a buildup of FBP, as energy stress limits
  protein polymerization. However, in this case, it is not clear what signaling pathway
  gives rise to the opposite responses of glycolytic enzymes to LacZ overexpression.
  Inset: Corresponding glucose uptake and acetate excretion rates for the two perturbations
  presented in the main figure. Glucose uptake and acetate excretion rates decreased
  proportional to growth rate for LacZ OE (as expected from the model ). On the other
  hand, there was a marked increase in acetate excretion with energy dissipation for
  a roughly constant glucose uptake rate, as correctly anticipated by the model [].
  Note that the protein abundance of Acs (main panel) shows that this increase in
  the acetate excretion rate was not caused by a drop in Acs. Instead, the observed
  increase of acetate excretion, together with the parallel increase in the expression
  level of glycolysis and TCA enzymes, points to the coordination of glycolytic and
  TCA fluxes in response to energy demand.'
