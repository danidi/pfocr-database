caption: Schematic representation of adipogenesis and fat deposition and their regulation
  at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level in the chicken adipocyte.
  Several regulatory factors, including hormones (green boxes), transcriptional factors
  (blue boxes), miRNAs (red boxes), and their target genes, controlling adipogenesis
  and fat deposition in chicken. 1—Adipogenesis (orange boxes) is the process of differentiation
  in which mesenchymal cells turn into mature adipocytes. 2—The fatty acids released
  from VLDL can penetrate adipocytes, which inside adipocytes resynthesized into TG
  and deposited. Accumulated fat in chicken adipose tissue consists of TG either from
  plasma VLDL (source 1) or from dietary fats (portomicrons) (source 2). 3—The presence
  of exogenous fatty acids (from VLDL or diet) is vital for regulating the expression
  of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). 4—The blue boxes revealed
  the sequence of transcriptional factors controlling adipogenesis; the early transcriptional
  regulators, including CCAAT/Enhancer binding-protein (C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ) express
  and stimulate the key transcription factors, including PPARγ and C/EBPα which at
  terminal differentiation stage, regulate the transcriptional regulation of a variety
  of adipocyte-associated genes, such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty-acid-binding
  proteins (FABP), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), and adiponectin, C1Q and
  collagen domain-containing (ADIPOQ). PPARγ and C/EBPα are the master regulators
  of adipogenesis that can crossregulate each other. Sterol response element-binding
  protein (SREBP1) is regulated by insulin and can regulate adipogenesis by inspiration
  the expression of PPARγ through adipogenesis. Kruppel-like transcription factor
  (KLF5) is activated by C/EBPβ/δ through the early stages of adipogenesis and then
  promotes the expression of PPARγ. KLF2 and GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) are the
  anti-adipogenic transcription factors, which lead to adipogenesis repression through
  inhibition of the expression of PPARγ. Zinc finger protein 423 (Zfp423) regulates
  preadipocyte cell determination through regulation of PPARγ expression. 5—The red
  boxes indicated various significantly expressed miRNAs with regulatory effects on
  adipogenesis. 6—Fat deposition in chicken is mediated and regulated by different
  signaling pathways (purple boxes), including the PPAR signaling pathway and the
  cell junction pathways (focal adhesions, tight junction, ECM-receptor interaction,
  regulation of actin cytoskeleton). The cell junction-related pathways may mediate
  the PPAR signaling pathway after activating PPARγ. Then PPARγ upregulates the expression
  of lipogenic-related genes, such as FABP3, LPL. The steroid biosynthesis pathway
  through regulating the expression of genes, such as 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase
  (DHCR24) and NAD(P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL), might play a dominant
  role in fat deposition in chicken (). Open arrows and diamond arrows represented
  the stimulating and inhibition effects, respectively.
