caption: Newly synthesized APP traffics through the secretory pathway to the plasma
  membrane, where it is primarily cleaved by the α-secretase in the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway, producing a minimally toxic peptide P3. When APP is internalized through
  the clathrin-mediated pathway, it is delivered to endosomes, where it is cleaved
  first by the β-secretase (BACE1), and then by the γ-secretase to generate highly
  toxic Aβ. Although most Aβ peptides are secreted to extracellular space, some Aβ
  peptides may aggregate in the late endosomes/lysosomes contributing to intraneuronal
  Aβ accumulation. The fast endocytosis of LRP1 enhances APP endocytosis and processing
  to Aβ, whereas the slow endocytosis of LRP1B and apoER2 contributes to retaining
  APP at the cell surface and promotes non-amyloidogenic processing. SorLA/LR11 likely
  shuttles APP to the Golgi compartments and reduces its processing by β-secretase
  in the early endosomes, thus decreasing Aβ production. ApoE4 promotes APP amyloidogenic
  processing in a manner that depends on LRP1 function. APP’s intracellular domain
  (AICD), a product of both non-amyloidgenic and amyloidgenic processing, interacts
  with FE65 and Tip60, and regulates gene transcription in the nucleus.
