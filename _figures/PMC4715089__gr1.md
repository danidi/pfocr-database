caption: TGF-β/Smads and crosstalk pathways in renal fibrosis and inflammation. After
  binding to TβRII, TGF-β1 activates the TβRI-kinase, which phosphorylates Smad2 and
  Smad3. The phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 then bind to Smad4 and form the Smad complex,
  which translocates into the nucleus and regulates the target gene transcription,
  including Smad7. Smad7 is an inhibitory Smad that functions to block Smad2/3 activation
  by degrading the TβRI and Smads and to inhibit NF-κB-driven inflammatory response
  by inducing IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB. Note that Ang II and AGEs can activate
  Smads independent of TGF-β1 via the ERK/p38/MAPK crosstalk pathway. Red arrow lines
  (symbols) indicate positive regulation and blue lines (symbols) indicate negative
  regulation. AGE, advanced glycation end-products; Ang II, angiotensin II; ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinases; IkBa, IκBα; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappaB;
