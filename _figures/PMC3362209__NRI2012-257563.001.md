caption: The role of RIP-1 in programmed necrosis. Following neonatal HI, members
  of the TNFR superfamily (also called death receptors, DR) are activated by their
  ligands (DR-L) (i.e., FasL, TNF-α). In the setting of energy sufficiency and upon
  TNFR activation, TNFR undergoes a conformational modification of its cytoplasmic
  portion allowing the interaction with receptor interacting protein (RIP)-1 with
  the death domain (DD), TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD), and TNFR-associated
  factor (TRAF)-2 and -5. They in turn recruit the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
  (cIAP) forming the complex I. cIAP inhibits caspase-3 activation and allows ubiquitylation
  of RIP-1. Next, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK)-1/TAK-1 binding
  protein (TAB)-2/TAB-3 form a complex that binds to ubiquitin residues on RIP-1 and
  activates nuclear factor-κB (NFκB). This may occur via a p38 mitogen-activated-protein-kinase-(p38-MAPK-)
  dependent pathway. Complex I may interact with NADPH oxidase (NOX 1) producing ROS,
  also possibly triggering programmed necrosis. Deubiquitylation of RIP-1 by the enzyme
  cylindromatosis (CYLD) favors the transformation of complex I to complex II binding
  to the internalized death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC, formed by FAS-associated
  protein with death domain (FADD) and procaspase-8 (Pro-C8)) and RIP-3 (Complex II).
  If energy is only partially insufficient, RIP-1 activates caspase-8 (C8) signaling
  for classical apoptosis via intrinsic (where truncated BID binds to the outer mitochondrial
  membrane allowing the release of cytochrome C (Cyt C) and triggering apoptosome
  formation) or extrinsic pathway resulting in caspase-3 activation. In this setting,
  caspase-8 cleaves RIP-1 and RIP-3 preserving signal for apoptosis; however, if energy
  failure evolves, caspase activity declines favoring (i) preservation of the RIP-1
  kinase activity, (ii) decrease in RIP-3/FADD constitutive interaction, and (iii)
  autophosphorylation between RIP-1 with RIP-3 at the RIP homotypic interaction motif
  (RHIM) forming the necrosome. Necrosome induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  via activation of NOX 1 at the cellular membrane or direct effects in the mitochondria.
  ROS cause DNA alkylation increasing activation of calpain-dependent poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1
  (PARP-1) which is normally required for DNA repair. Hyperactivation of PARP-1 induces
  ATP depletion and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from the mitochondria
  to the nucleus which in turn produces further DNA damage and PARP-1 activation.
  Necrosome formation is a potential intermediate step that follows PARP-1 activation
  potential intermediate steps that follow PARP-1 activation. There is some evidence
  that it produces ATP depletion via inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocase
  (ANT) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial dysfunction is likely at
  the core of the events resulting in programmed necrosis.
