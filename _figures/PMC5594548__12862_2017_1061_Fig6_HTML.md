caption: Endogenous RNA interference pathway genes detected in flatworms. The non-coding
  RNA (ncRNA) containing a dsRNA region is transcribed in the nucleus and processed
  in the cytoplasm by ERI complex. After binding, the ncRNA ERI-1 removes one of unpaired
  strands creating a hairpin structure suitable for priming the synthesis of long
  dsRNA by RRF-3. Dicer and DRH-3 then, cleave the long dsRNA, and ERGO-1 (homologous
  to Ago2 in D. melanogaster) loaded with siRNA triggers the target RNA degradation.
  Endogenous RNAi pathway factors with homologous genes detected in flatworms are
  indicated (“Flatworm Distribution Code” box). A ‘shape’ code was used to indicate
  predicted function of factors (“Protein Function Code” box)
