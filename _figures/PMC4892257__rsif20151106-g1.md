caption: 'Overview of the intracellular interplay between Notch signalling pathway
  and EMT circuit and Notch signalling tissue patterning outcomes. (a) Notch signalling
  is activated by the interaction of the transmembrane Notch receptor with the transmembrane
  ligand (Delta or Jagged) of a neighbouring cell. This trans-interaction cleaves
  Notch and causes the release of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the cytoplasm.
  NICD then enters the nucleus where it modulates the transcription of many target
  genes—it activates Notch, Jagged and Snail, and inhibits Delta. Glycosylation of
  Notch receptor by Fringe increases the affinity of Notch to bind to Delta and reduces
  that to Jagged. The EMT regulatory circuit consists of two mutual-inhibitory feedback
  circuits, each between an EMT-inhibiting microRNA (miR) and an EMT-inducing transcription
  factor (TF): miR-34/SNAIL and miR-200/ZEB. Both the microRNAs translationally inhibit
  proteins of the Notch pathway—miR-200 inhibits Jagged, and miR-34 inhibits both
  Notch and Delta. EMT-inducing signals (Iext) such as Wnt and TGFβ can induce EMT
  by activating Snail. (b) Notch-Delta signalling creates an intercellular toggle
  switch leading neighbouring cells to adopt alternate fates—Sender cell (low Notch
  (receptor), high Delta (ligand)) and Receiver cell (high Notch (receptor), low Delta
  (ligand)), giving rise to a checkerboard-like pattern (lateral inhibition). (c)
  Notch-Jagged signalling creates an intercellular double positive feedback loop leading
  neighbouring cells to adopt similar fates (high Notch (receptor), high Jagged (ligand)),
  thereby propagating or inducing the same fate across the tissue (lateral induction).'
