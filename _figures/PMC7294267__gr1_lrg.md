caption: Three mechanisms suggested for the effects of statins and ACEis/ARBs in preventing
  severe pulmonary disease in COVID-19. (1) Under normal conditions the Tie-2 receptor
  is continuously activated by Angiopoetin-1 (Angpt-1), which in turn activates Akt-kinase,
  leading to phosphorylation and hence inhibition of the transcription factor Foxo1.
  Unphosphorylated or active Foxo1 initiates the transcription of genes leading to
  increased inflammation, decreased endothelial barrier integrity, and hypercoagulability.
  Angpt-2 is a partial antagonist of the Tie-2 receptor, stimulating inflammation,
  endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulability. COVID-19 infection and ARDS are
  associated with increased Angpt-2 levels in blood, whereas statins simulate the
  Angpt-1 pathways. (2) The RAS system activates angiotensin-1 receptors (AT1R), stimulating
  inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial permeability. The Ang II-ACE2-Ang(1–7)-Mas
  receptor pathway counteracts the effects of this RAS system. COVID-19 enters the
  cell through ACE2 receptors, thereby decreasing these membrane-bound receptors,
  and relatively stimulating the RAS system. ACEis/ARBs inhibit the RAS system, while
  concomitantly increasing ACE-2 expression, which protects against ARDS. Statins
  also increase ACE-2 expression. (3) In ARDS, there is an increase in the activation
  of the MyD88-NFkB inflammatory pathway. Statins preserve MyD88 at normal levels
  and downregulate NFkB. Black lines = stimulating effects; red lines = inhibiting
  effects.
