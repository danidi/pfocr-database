caption: (Top pathway) JAK/STAT signaling specifies trachea by activating expression
  of early tracheal genes, including two transcription factors, Trh and Vvl. Trachea
  formation is limited to PS4 – 13 by early expression of Salm in more anterior and
  posterior parasegments. As with the SG, Dpp- and EGF-signaling provide dorsal and
  ventral limits on trachea specification. Wg functions within each segment to limit
  trachea formation to a subset of cells within each segment of the embryo. Trh maintains
  Upd expression in the trachea, where Upd is proposed function non-autonomously in
  the recruitment of additional cells within each segment to a tracheal fate. (Bottom
  pathway) Trh and Vvl continue to be expressed in the trachea to maintain and implement
  the decision to form trachea. Trh is required to not only maintain its own expression
  but is required for the expression of all tracheal genes. Vvl regulates only an
  estimated 25 – 30% of tracheal genes, including Rho and Btl, which function in tracheal
  invagination and migration. Among the early Trh targets is Kni, a transcription
  factor required to limit the domain of Salm, which in the trachea plays key roles
  in the types of tubes that form in the different tracheal branches.
