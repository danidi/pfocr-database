caption: 'Mechanism of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease
  2019 (COVID-19). ①Gut-lung axis: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
  (SARS-CoV-2) binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter the lung,
  resulting in the accumulation of angiotensin II (ANG II) and the decrease of angiotensin
  (1-7) (Ang1–7). ANG II combined with AT1R promotes cytokine release and increases
  CCR9+CD4+T cells. CCL25 promotes the recruitment of C-C chemokine receptor type
  9 (CCR9)+CD4+T cells into the small intestine. The changed flora then promotes the
  polarization of Th17 cells, and finally IL-17A causes the recruitment of neutrophils.
  Cytokines and bacteria also enter the lung through the bloodstream, further affecting
  the lung inflammation. ②Gut-liver axis: SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2 to enter the
  intestine, inhibits the absorption of the B0AT1/ACE2 transport pathway, and then
  affects the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to reduce the expression
  of antimicrobial peptides. The intestinal flora is transferred to the liver through
  the portal vein, where it binds to toll-like receptors, causing hepatitis. The liver
  also can transport metabolites to the intestine through the biliary tract.'
