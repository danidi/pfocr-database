caption: 'Schematic figure representing skeletal muscle dysfunction in type 1 diabetes
  mellitus and possible therapeutic approaches targeting skeletal muscle. (1) In T1DM,
  due to dyslipidemia and/or the reduced ability for muscle to uptake carbohydrates,
  an increased amount of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) are shuttled into the skeletal
  muscle. The majority of this excess fat is deposited in the form of intramyocellular
  lipid droplets (IMCLs) as there is a reduced ability to efficiently oxidize lipids
  due to impairments to oxidative capacity. An increased amount of metabolic stress
  and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production within the mitochondria is observed
  in T1DM and appears to be a causative factor; (2) T1DM also induces dysfunction
  with regard to the vasculature network. There is a thickening of the basement membrane
  and downregulation of angiogenesis resulting in a decreased capillary-to-fiber ratio.
  Impairments to microvasculature have also been linked with generation of macrovascular
  complications (e.g., atherosclerosis), a serious long-term diabetic complication;
  and (3) Insulin resistance results in disruptions to the insulin signalling pathway.
  Improper insulin signalling prevents excess glucose in the blood from being taken
  up by the muscle via decreased translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter. Our
  proposed treatments of exercise, myostatin inhibition, leptin and adiponectin target
  the specific pathways mentioned above in skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that if
  diabetic myopathy is attenuated it will allow muscle to contribute a greater amount
  towards reducing hyperglycemia. Since muscle is an important large metabolic organ,
  if skeletal muscle health was improved there would be resultant decreases in oxidative
  stress, improvements to glycemic control and a reduction in the need for exogenous
  insulin. T1DM: Type 1 diabetes mellitus; GLUT4: Glucose transporter type 4.'
