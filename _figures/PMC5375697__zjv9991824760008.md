caption: Proposed model of the role of BCA2 in the NF-κB pathway. (Left) BCA2 is induced
  in response to NF-κB. Upon activation, NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus to regulate
  the expression of NF-κB-responsive genes, such as BCA2, and the HIV-1 provirus.
  (Right) Once BCA2 is synthesized, it primarily localizes in the cytoplasm, where
  its upregulation provides negative regulatory feedback on NF-κB signaling by enhancing
  the SUMOylation of IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB. This posttranslational modification
  makes IκBα a more potent inhibitor, further sequestering NF-κB elements in the cytoplasm,
  thereby contributing to HIV-1 proviral repression.
