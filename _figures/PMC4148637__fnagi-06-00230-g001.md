caption: The relationship between PI3-K–Akt–mTOR signaling and autophagy in muscular
  dystrophy. The major anabolic pathway regulating protein synthesis in skeletal muscle
  is mTOR/TORC1 signaling. Upstream trigger (IGF-1, mechanical stress, etc.) activates
  mTOR signaling through a number of different intermediary proteins such as Akt and
  Rheb. Several anabolic stimulation increases the amount of activated Akt, which
  blocks the nuclear translocation of Foxo3 to enhance the expression of autophagy-related
  genes (Bnip, LC3, and Atg12) and atrogene (atrogin-1 and MuRF-1). In dystrophic
  muscle, higher Akt potently blocks the inhibition of Rheb by TSC-1/TSC-2, and hyperactivate
  mTORC1. Unnecessary activated mTORC1 would extremely enhance protein synthesis and
  blocks autophagy-dependent signaling. Therefore, muscular dystrophy exhibits apparent
  defect of autophagic process similar to sarcopenic muscle.
