caption: . Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin disruption and recovery processes
  in C57BL/6 and ICR mice. When lipopolysaccharide binds to a receptor (such as toll-like
  receptor 4), the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway or other inflammatory pathways
  are activated and release various cytokines. ZO-1 are mislocated with occludin by
  cytokines, and ZO-1 or occludin proteins are degraded by proteasomes, followed by
  a recovery activity via protein synthesis from the mRNAs. However, this process
  might be different in B6 (A) or ICR (B) mice. Considering the low permeability of
  Evans blue dye and the low expressions of ZO-1 and occludin mRNA and protein, there
  may be a protective or inhibitory factor suppressing the inflammation activity or
  degradation of ZO-1 or occludin proteins. This process difference is thought to
  be related to the more than 24 h required for the protein restoration process of
  the proteins in brain epithelial cells in B6 mice (A). In ICR mice (B), however,
  disruption and restore pathways are rather more common than those in B6 mice. The
  arrow streams indicating translation activity show the different time-dependent
  patterns in ZO-1 and occludin protein synthesis from mRNA in brain endothelial cells
  of ICR mice (C).
