caption: The domain structure of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIPK1) consists of
  an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain and a C-terminal death domain
  (DD). The N-terminal kinase domain is crucial for RIPK1-dependent apoptosis and
  necroptosis. The cleavage of RIPK1 at D324 by caspase-8 blocks the activation of
  RIPK1 by separating the kinase domain from the C-terminal DD, which is critical
  for mediating RIPK1 activation by dimerization. Autophosphorylation of Ser14/15
  and Ser166 of RIPK1 are biomarkers of its kinase activation. K115 in activated RIPK1
  is ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase pellino 1 (PELI1). The kinase TBK1 phosphorylates
  T189 RIPK1 to suppress its activation. The intermediate domain of RIPK1 is involved
  in regulating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling. RIPK1 can be ubiquitylated on
  multiple residues within this domain; one of these sites, Lys377, is a crucial residue
  that can be ubiquitylated by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as cellular inhibitor of
  apoptosis 1 (cIAP1) or cIAP2 and parkin. The Lys377 residue also serves as a binding
  hub for downstream signalling, including the NF-κB signalling pathway, by recruiting
  K63 ubiquitin binding proteins TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) or TAB3, which in turn
  promote the activation of transforming-growth-factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1).
  Activated TAK1 mediates multiple inhibitory phosphorylations of RIPK1 directly and
  indirectly by promoting the activation of IκB kinases (IKKs) and MAPK-activated
  protein kinase 2 (MK2). TBK1 mediates inhibitory phosphorylation of RIPK1 on T189
  to block its substrate recognition in autophosphorylation-mediated activation. The
  receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) within the intermediate
  domain of RIPK1 mediates homotypic binding with the RHIM of RIPK3 to promote downstream
  signalling in necroptosis and inflammation. The C-terminal DD of RIPK1 mediates
  heterodimerization with the death domains of TNFR1, TRADD and FADD, as well as homodimerization
  with itself to mediate the activation of N-terminal kinase domain. M1 ubiquitylation
  of RIPK1 by the linear ubiquitylation assembly complex (LUBAC) suppresses RIPK1
  activation by enabling the recruitment of multiple UBAN-containing ubiquitin-binding
  proteins, including NEMO, ABIN1 and OPTN, which promote the activation of IKKs (NEMO),
  recruit A20 (ABIN1) or regulate K48 ubiquitylation of RIPK1 (OPTN).
