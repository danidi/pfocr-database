caption: Schematic representation of intracellular pathways implicated in the regulation
  of cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response in human macrophages by IL-6.
  In lipid-loaded human macrophages secreting high amounts of IL-6, the autocrine
  action of IL-6 induces ABCA1 gene expression and enhances ABCA1-mediated efflux
  of cholesterol derived from ingestion of either modified lipoproteins () or apoptotic
  cells () through activation of the Jak-2/Stat3 pathway, thereby reducing foam cell
  formation and accumulation of cytotoxic free cholesterol, respectively. Moreover,
  IL-6 induces the expression of PPARδ, TG2, c-mer proto-oncogene-tyrosine kinase
  (MERTK), and THBS1 and enhances the clearance of apoptotic cells by human macrophages
  phagocytes (). Finally stimulation of human macrophages by IL-6 led to an attenuation
  of the proinflammatory response () by the increase of IL-4 and IL-10 secretion and
  the reduction of that of IL-1β. Elevation of secreted IL-10 amounts upon IL-6 stimulation
  may contribute to maintain Stat3 activation and then to abolish the repression operated
  by induction of SOCS3 expression. It is of note that the interaction of apoAI with
  ABCA1 was previously reported to activate the Jak-2/Stat3 pathway () and to participate
  to the establishment of the anti-inflammatory response in human macrophages (, ).
  Taken together, the autocrine action of IL-6 on lipid-laden human macrophages constitutes
  a survival response by protecting from lipid accumulation and by attenuating the
  proinflammatory response. FC, free cholesterol; EC, esterified cholesterol; AC,
  apoptotic cells.
