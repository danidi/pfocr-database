caption: 'Lignin pathway genes differentially expressed in stem tissues of two alfalfa
  genotypes. Pair-wise comparisons were made between stem tissues (ES, PES) of genotypes
  708 and 773. Columns in each heatmap from left to right: Log2(708ES/773ES), Log2(708PES/773PES),
  Log2(708PES/708ES), and Log2(773PES/773ES). The rows in each heatmap represent lignin
  gene sequences identified in MSGI 1.0. The Log2 expression ratio values were false
  color-coded using a scale of -3 to 3. The intensity of blue and red indicates the
  degree of up- and down-regulation of the corresponding lignin gene in the denominator
  in each column mentioned above. The red and blue color saturates at -3 and 3, respectively.
  See Methods for details. The heatmaps generated were inserted next to the corresponding
  lignin gene in the lignin biosynthetic pathway diagram downloaded from the KEGG
  pathway database http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/map/map00940.html. PAL, phenylalanine
