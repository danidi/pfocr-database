caption: 'The proposed schematic of possible mechanisms of metabolic regulation of
  tumor cells by dysfunctional adipocytes in obesity The major consequence of obesity
  is adipose tissue inflammation and associated increases in circulating levels of
  lipolysis-generated lipids and pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines. Through
  paracrine, autocrine, and endocrine effects, adipocyte-derived factors activate
  metabolic pathways in tumor cells and facilitating growth and survival. Pathways
  of interest include the following: phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling cascade,
  hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), increased glucose uptake and enhanced glycolysis,
  and the potentially oncogenic endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) pathway. The stimulation
  of PI3-K pathway leads to downstream activation of Akt and mTOR, enhancing the transcription
  of genes involved in growth, proliferation and survival. PI3-K signaling can also
  activate c-MYC and lead to the induction of glycolytic genes. A potential crosstalk
  between the glycolysis pathway and the HIF-1α signaling axis potentiates HIF activity,
  and exacerbates the glycolytic and hypoxic phenotypes. HIF-1α signaling leads to
  the expression of miRNA-210, which disrupts mitochondrial integrity, affecting cellular
  metabolism. Additionally, FFA have the ability to disrupt mitochondrial and ER membrane
  integrity and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. The interactions of
  the ER stress response protein, XBP-1, with HIF-1α drive the expression of HIF-
  and glycolysis-targeted genes. This adipocyte-driven dynamic network of events results
  in metabolic adaptation of tumor cells, implicating adiposity in tumor aggressiveness
  and chemoresistance to therapy. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase
