caption: The Kdo biosynthetic pathway, substrate analogues and inhibitors. (a) The
  Kdo biosynthetic pathway. The enzymes involved are (1) arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase
  (API), (2) Kdo-8-phosphate (Kdo-8-P) synthase, (3) Kdo-8-P phosphatase and (4) cytidine
  5′-monophosphate-Kdo synthetase. API catalyzes the reversible isomerization of d-ribulose
  5-phosphate (Ru5P) to d-arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) in the first step of Kdo biosynthesis.
  E. coli contains multiple paralogs of API genes including kdsD, kpsF and gutQ. The
  open-chain form and the ring form of A5P and Kdo-8-P are shown. PEP stands for phosphoenolpyruvate.
  The C1 and C2 atoms of A5P are marked with red asterisks. The C4 and C5 atoms of
  CMP-Kdo derived from C1 and C2 of A5P are also marked with red asterisks. (b) 5-Phospho-d-arabinonate
  (5PAA), a G6P substrate analog commonly used in enzyme mechanistic studies of PGI,
  is shown on the left. 4-Phospho-2,3-acetyl-d-erythrose hydroxamate (4PEH) was the
  most potent API inhibitor among the hydroxamate compounds tested in a study of F.
  tularensis KdsD (Yep et al., 2011).
