caption: Autocrine signaling by IGF-II regulates muscle differentiation. Illustrated
  is a model of skeletal muscle differentiation in which IGF-II, produced by differentiating
  myoblasts, activates the IGF-I receptor, the adapter molecules IRS 1 and 2, and
  the PI3K-Akt pathway to enhance transcriptional properties of MyoD via the coactivators,
  p300 and p300/CBP associated factor (P/CAF). Signaling by TGF-β to activate its
  receptor and Smad2 and Smad3 (indicated by the Smad3/Smad4 heterodimer) blocks induction
  of IGF-II gene expression and inhibits muscle differentiation. Unknown steps in
  both the autocrine amplification cascade and inhibitory pathways are depicted by
  question marks.
