caption: Metabolism involved in energy production in tumor cells and pathways involved
  in [1‐13C]pyruvate and [18F]FDG metabolism. Malignant cells often have high energy
  demands reflected in high uptake of glucose (Glc) by GLUT transporters and high
  conversion rates of pyruvate (Pyr) into lactate (Lac) by LDH (Warburg effect). Hyperpolarized
  (HP) [1‐13C]pyruvate can enter the cells via MCT transporters and is rapidly converted
  to HP [1‐13C]lactate, which is excreted (green pathway). Using radiolabeled [18F]FDG,
  a glucose analog, the uptake and subsequent phosphorylation of glucose can be estimated
  (red pathway)
