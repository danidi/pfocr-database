caption: A simplified version of C2-O-sLeX biosynthesis is shown. Core 1 O-glycans
  are synthesized by addition of β1,3 galactose to N-acetylgalactosamine. The core
  2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT1) enzyme catalyzes the addition of
  a β1,6 branch to a core 1 O-glycan to form a core 2 β1,6 branched O-glycan. The
  core 2 O-glycan structure is further modified by a series of enzymatic reactions
  (omitted for clarity) including modification by α2,3 sialyltransferase and α1,3
  fucosyltransferase (FucT-III) to form a sLeX terminus (dotted box). These modifications
  result in the synthesis of the sLeX-modified core 2 β1,6 O-glycan (C2-O-sLeX) structure.
