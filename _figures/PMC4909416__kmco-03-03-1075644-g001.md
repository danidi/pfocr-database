caption: The CDC20-APC/SOX2 pathway in human GSCs. (A) Cell division cycle 20–anaphase-promoting
  complex (CDC20-APC) regulates key functions of human glioblastoma stem-like cells
  (GSCs). (B) Depicted are mechanisms of CDC20-APC regulation of sex-determining region
  Y-box 2 (SOX2) that have been demonstrated to mediate GSC self-renewal and invasiveness.
