caption: In mice (left model), DCs lodged in the subepithelial dome of Peyer’s patches
  capture bacteria or antigen internalized by M cells or by epithelial cells (ECs)
  via receptor-mediated endocytosis. These DCs migrate to the interfollicular region
  (IFR) of Peyer’s patches, where they present antigen to CD4+ T cells. Antigen-activated
  CD4+ T cells elicit IgA class switching by stimulating IgM+IgD+ B cells through
  CD40L and TGF. A subset of Peyer’s patch DCs, TNF-α+iNOS+ DCs, enhance IgA class
  switching by upregulating the expression of the TGF-β receptor on B cells through
  nitric oxide (NO). In the presence of retinoic acid (RA), IgA+ B cells upregulate
  the expression of CCR9 and α4β7 and thereafter migrate to the lamina propria, where
  they differentiate into plasma cells that release dimeric IgA antibodies. This T
  cell-dependent pathway yields high-affinity, monoreactive IgA antibodies that preferentially
  target pathogens and toxins. IgA class switching can also take place in the lamina
  propria via a T independent mechanism that involves activation of B-1 cells and
  possibly other IgM+IgD+ B cell subsets by DCs, including TNF-α+iNOS+ DCs. These
  DCs release innate IgA class-switch-inducing factors, such as BAFF, APRIL, TGF-β,
  and NO, as well as IgA secretion-inducing factors, such as IL-6 and RA, after sensing
  bacteria through TLRs. NO amplifies IgA class switching by enhancing BAFF and APRIL
  production by DCs. This T cell-independent pathway preferentially yields low-affinity,
  polyreactive IgA antibodies to commensal bacteria.In humans (right model), CD4+
  T cells elicit IgA1 class switching by activating Peyer’s patch IgM+IgD+ B cells
  through CD40L and TGF-β. The resulting IgA1+ B cells migrate to the lamina propria
  through a mechanism presumably similar to that utilized by mouse IgA+ B cells. In
  the lamina propria, IgA1+ B cells sequentially switch to IgA2 in response to APRIL
  and IL-10 released by TLR-activated ECs. Also, DCs can release these cytokines in
  response to TSLP produced by ECs. In the lamina propria, additional IgM+IgD+ B cells
  can undergo direct class switching from IgM to IgA1 or IgA2 in response to BAFF
  or APRIL and IL-10. In general, IgA2 is more resistant to bacterial proteases than
  IgA1 and may therefore have a longer half-life in the lumen of the distal intestinal
  tract.
