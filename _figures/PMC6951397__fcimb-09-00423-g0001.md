caption: Brucella abortus infection modulates the activation of hepatic stellate cells
  (HSC). (1) HSC secrete monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-8
  (chemoattractant of monocytes and neutrophils, respectively) in response to B. abortus
  infection. (2) Resident macrophages or monocytes attracted to the site of infection
  could be infected by B. abortus and then modulate the expression of collagen and
  MMP-9 depending on the status of HSC (infected or not). In non-infected HSC, B.
  abortus-infected monocytes induce an inflammatory phenotype characterized by the
  increase in MMP-9 expression and the inhibition of collagen deposition. In contrast,
  B. abortus-infected monocytes induce the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP)-9 secretion and the increase in collagen deposition in infected HSC. (3) B.
  abortus infection of HSC induces HSC activation by inducing a fibrotic phenotype
  characterized by the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen deposition,
  and inhibition of MMP-9 through a mechanism that is dependent on the increase in
  transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1.
  (4) Fibrosis induction by B. abortus infection was dependent on the Type IV secretion
  system (T4SS) and its secreted effector BPE005 in a mechanism that depends on the
  cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. (5) Fibrosis induction
  is also dependent on autophagy pathway induction characterized by the increase in
  the expression of LC3II and Beclin-1 and the inhibition of p62 expression. (6) Then,
  B. abortus infection induces cell death by apoptosis of activated HSC in a mechanism
  that is dependent on a functional T4SS and caspase 3 cleavage.
