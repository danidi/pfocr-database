caption: 'The schematic represents the metabolic status of cancer stem cells (CSCs)
  in three broad categories based on the location. CSCs in a normoxic tumor: stemness
  has been associated with upregulation of glycolytic enzymes in those CSCs that rely
  on glucose pathway, as well as with dependence on mitochondrial pathway as evidenced
  by increased mitochondrial mass, membrane potential in CSCs and mitochondrial fatty
  acid oxidation (FAO) for generation of adenosine 5′-triphosphate and nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide. CSCs in tumor under hypoxia: hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)
  promotes upregulation and potentiated activity of several glycolytic proteins, such
  as transporters (GLUT1, GLUT3) and various isoforms of glycolytic enzymes. CSCs
  in the metastatic niche: CSCs induced by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, have
  augmented utilization of extracellular catabolites, such as pyruvate, lactate, glutamine,
  glutamate, alanine, or ketone bodies. In nutrient poor states, quiescent disseminated
  tumor cells rely on alternative energy sources such as autophagy. The CSC stem cell
  model of treatment proposes the prevention of recurrence if all CSCs are eliminated.'
