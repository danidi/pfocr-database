caption: A model showing how the cargo in exosomes can potentially change. MVBs are
  part of the endocytic pathway, and they undergo a maturation process that includes
  the sorting of membrane and cytosolic proteins by the ESCRT complex and HSC70 on
  the limiting membrane of MVBs. This results in the incorporation of cargo proteins
  into the lumen of nascent ILVs. Many of the MVBs are then trafficked in Rab5- and
  Rab7-dependent mechanisms to lysosomes, where they are degraded. However, some MVBs
  can also be routed to the plasma membrane by Rab27 and SYT7, and their contents
  (i.e. ILVs) released as exosomes. The content of exosomes generated by a cell can
  potentially change depending on which point during their maturation process the
  MVBs are trafficked to the plasma membrane, as depicted.
