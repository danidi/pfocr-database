caption: '(A) Complement activation is effectively contained on the surface of normal
  erythrocytes that express the GPI-linked regulators CD55 (DAF) and CD59. Opsonic
  C3b may be generated by spontaneous (tick-over) or bystander activation (e.g., due
  to an infection) but is readily degraded by the plasma enzyme factor I (FI) in concert
  with the complement regulators factor H (FH), CD55 and CR1 (CD35). Furthermore,
  CD59 prevents the assembly of the MAC and protects the erythrocyte from autologous
  complement-mediated lysis (intravascular hemolysis) (B) Lack of GPI-linked CD55
  and CD59 leads to the functional ‘dismantling’ of normal complement regulatory activity
  on the PNH erythrocyte surface, rendering the cell susceptible to autologous complement
  attack. Complement activation triggered by: spontaneous C3 hydrolysis (via tick-over
  mechanism); bystander activation; or specific (yet unknown) triggering mechanisms
  on PNH erythrocyte surfaces leads to C3b generation and surface opsonization that,
  in the absence of CD55, culminates in uncontrollable C3 fragment opsonization via
  amplification of the complement response through the alternative pathway and, eventually,
  in MAC-mediated intravascular hemolysis (i.e., due to the absence of CD59).'
