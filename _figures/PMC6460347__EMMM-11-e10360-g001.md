caption: (A) State of the art of cellular and molecular mechanisms taking place in
  HGPS‐VSMCs from animal models and patients (either primary or iPSC‐derived cells).
  Nuclear structural defects (1), accumulation of progerin (2), transcriptional changes
  due to chromatin remodeling (3), and increased DNA damage (4) are the “classical”
  hallmarks of progeric cells. In addition, activation of the NRF2 pathway and oxidative
  stress are associated with HGPS. (B) New molecular insights from the work published
  in this issue, demonstrating that the ER stress response and activation of the UPR
  play major roles in VSMC death and atherosclerosis in mice with VSMC‐restricted
  progerin expression. Administration of the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic
  acid (TUDCA) is sufficient to rescue cell homeostasis, reduce atherosclerosis progression,
  and improve lifespan.
