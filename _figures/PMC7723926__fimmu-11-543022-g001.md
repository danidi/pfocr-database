caption: Schematic depiction of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling cascade,
  and the interplay between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and inflammation.
  (A) Oligomerization of IRE1α in the presence of unfolded proteins promotes the endoribonuclease
  activity of IRE1α and unconventional splicing of XBP1 generating functional XBP1
  that regulates gene expression. IRE1α promotes RIDD-dependent mRNA decay and reduces
  protein overload in the ER lumen. (B) Activated PERK drives phosphorylation of eIF2α
  resulting in translational block. At this juncture, selective IRES dependent translation
  of ATF4 is promoted to induce chaperones and mitigate oxidative stress as well as
  apoptosis. (C) Dissociation of BiP from ATF6 leads to translocation of ATF6 from
  the ER membrane to Golgi promoting its cleavage by S1P and S2P generating functional
  ATF6 that regulates UPR genes. (D) In IRE1α pathway, the RNase domain is involved
  in Xbp1 splicing and RIDD mechanism upregulates the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β; the kinase domain activates JNK and IKK signaling
  pathway that results in apoptosis and inflammation respectively. Additionally, activation
  of proton-sensing OGR1 is responsible for ER-stress mediated response via IRE1α-JNK-XBP1s
  axis. The kinase activity of ATF6 leads to phosphorylation of AKT ensuing inflammation
  via NF-κB signaling. The cleaved p50ATF6α acts as a transcription factor and upregulates
  the expression of APR genes and ER co-chaperone p58IPK that in turn blocks the phosphorylation
  of eIF2α. PERK is one of the kinases that phosphorylate eIF2α at Ser 51, which enables
  selective translation of ATF4. ATF4 drives the expression of CHOP and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES. Induced expression of CHOP abrogates pro-survival
  signaling leading to cell death. Notably, the translational block decreases further
  translation of IκB ensuing inflammation due to increase in NF-κB. Nrf2, another
  notable target phosphorylated by PERK that is known to manifest antioxidant response.
