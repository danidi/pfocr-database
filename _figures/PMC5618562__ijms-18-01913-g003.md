number: Figure 3
caption: Interplay between melatonin, YAP/TAZ, and metabolic pathways. Melatonin (MLT)
  upregulates glucagon production and downregulates insulin production and signaling.
  Glucagon inhibits YAP/TAZ nuclear function through Gαs signaling. Conversely, insulin
  and GPCR signaling synergize to positively regulate nuclear YAP onto YAP/TEAD target
  genes. In addition, YAP/TAZ activate AKT and mTOR, which are part of the insulin
  signaling. In conclusion, melatonin may inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear function by inducing
  glucagon expression and decreasing insulin expression. On the other hand, YAP/TAZ
  positively regulate insulin signaling, and, vice versa, insulin signaling positively
  regulates YAP, suggesting an antagonism between melatonin function and nuclear YAP/TAZ
  function. Arrows indicate activation, while dashed and blunt lines indicate inhibition.
  The figure also shows the interaction between the insulin receptor scaffold 4 (IRS4)
  with insulin receptor, integrins, and MT1/2 receptors potentially linking these
  transmembrane proteins at the cell membrane. IR = Insulin Receptor, IRS1/2/4 = insulin
  receptor scaffold 1/2/4.
