caption: The mTORC1 signaling pathway is involved in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway
  via MiT/TFE transcriptional factors. Under normal nutrition conditions, the MiT/TFE
  members were phosphorylated by mTORC1, which were sequestered in the cytoplasm by
  14–3-3 proteins. Upon starvation, mTORC1 was inactivated, leading to the dephosphorylation
  of MiT/TFE transcription factors, which resulted in the dissociation of the binding
  with 14–3-3 proteins that subsequently freely translocate to the nucleus where their
  transcriptional activation occurs in the autophagy-lysosome pathway []
