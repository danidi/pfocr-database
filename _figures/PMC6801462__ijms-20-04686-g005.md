caption: Regulation of root xylem chloride (Cl−) translocation by the anion channels
  SLAH1 and SLAH3 according to environmental cues. Under favorable growing conditions
  (A), high transcriptional activity of both SLAH1 and SLAH3 genes determines the
  formation of heteromeric SLAH1/SLAH3 complexes in the xylem-pole pericycle. The
  SLAH1 channel does not transport anions itself, but modifies the kinetic properties
  of SLAH3, which increases its Cl− conductance by 7 times and mediates xylem translocation
  of both Cl− and nitrate (NO3−) anions. However, under abiotic stress conditions
  like water deficit or salinity (B), gene expression of AtSLAH1 is strongly inhibited
  by an abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent regulatory pathway. This favors the formation
  of SLAH3/SLAH3 homomers, which significantly reduces the Cl− conductance of SLAH3,
  decreasing xylem Cl− translocation but maintaining xylem NO3− translocation. The
  schematic representation describes the regulatory mechanism described by Cubero-Font
  et al. [].
