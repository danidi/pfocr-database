caption: Comparision between mammalian and invertebrate Toll/Toll-like receptor and
  IMD/TNF-α signaling. Upon activation of invertebrate Toll receptor and the homologous
  Toll-like receptor in vertebrates, a cascade is induced where the homologous transcription
  factors Nf-κB and Dif are activated in vertebrates and invertebrates, respectively.
  The IMD pathway is activated by binding of peptidoglycan (PGN) to peptidoglycan-recognition
  proteins (PGRPs) which results in recruitment and formation of an IMD, dFADD and
  DREDD complex and results in IMD cleavage and activation of TAB2/TAK1. This results
  in Relish phosphorylation and ultimately the production of AMPs (e.g. cecropin).
  In mammals, TNF-α is bound by the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1) which
  results in recruitment of RIPP, FADD, and caspase 8. NF-κB is released from its
  inhibitor protein (IκB) via phosphorylation by IKK complex which results in NF-κB
  translocation to the nucleus resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
