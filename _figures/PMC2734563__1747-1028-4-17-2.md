caption: Possible mechanisms of UbcH7 regulation of Chk1 levels sand S phase. Conditions
  under normal or high levels of UbcH7 depicted on the left; after UbcH7 depletion,
  on the right. Decreased protein levels or decreased signaling pathways are noted
  by gray or lighter shading. (A) UbcH7 directly targets Chk1 for ubiquitination and
  degradation. If UbcH7 is directly involved in Chk1 ubiquitination, depletion of
  UbcH7 (right side) would result in an increase in Chk1. (B) UbcH7 increases Chk1
  through a PTEN/Akt pathway. Depletion of UbcH7 (right) leads to decreased P-PTEN.
  Decreased activity through PTEN would increase Akt activity leading to increased
  P280-Chk1. The effect of UbcH7 on PTEN could be through inhibition of a phosphatase
  which affects the phosphorylation state of PTEN or through the inhibition of the
  E3 that targets PTEN for degradation. (C) UbcH7 activates Chk1 via alteration of
  Mcm7 levels. Decreased ubiquitination of Mcm7 through a UbcH7/E6-AP pathway (right)
  would lead to the imbalance of proteins in the Mcm2-7 complex. This in turn could
  lead to the activation of the S phase checkpoint and an increase in Chk1 levels.
  (D) UbcH7 depletion activates Chk1 through an increase in BRCA1/BARD1 function.
  The release of inhibition caused by UbcH7 (right) would lead to increased BRCA1/BARD1
  ubiquitination and activation of the S phase checkpoint.
