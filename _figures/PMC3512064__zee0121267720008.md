caption: Proposed model for TNF-α/PKC-mediated up-regulation of LEPRb protein level
  and cell surface expression. LEPRb in the biosynthetic pathway (blue) is sorted
  in the Golgi or trans-Golgi network (the blue oval labeled LEPRb), which directs
  LEPRb either to vesicles (the blue circle labeled LEPRb) destined to the plasma
  membrane (PM, light pink) or to a yet-to-be defined degradation compartment (purple
  hexagon). TNF-α/PKC activation increases the sorting of LEPRb toward the vesicles
  destined to the plasma membrane and decreases the sorting of LEPRb toward degradation
  compartment, resulting in concomitant increases in cellular protein level and cell
  surface expression of LEPRb. Endocytosis of LEPRb and trafficking of endocytic vesicles
  carrying LEPRb (the orange circle labeled LEPRb) to lysosomes (red and orange circles),
  which is regulated by endospanins (), are not affected by TNF-α/PKC signaling.
