caption: (A) Binding of TGF-β to its cognate receptor leads to phosphorylation and
  therefore activation of SMAD signaling. (1) Phosphorylated SMADs (SMAD2 and SMAD3)
  form a complex with co-mediator SMAD4 and translocates to the nucleus for active
  transcription of the target genes. (2) Many of the miRNAs are involved in the positive
  and negative regulation of TGF-β/SMAD signaling cascade. miRNA130a/301a/454 abrogate
  TGF-β/SMAD mediated signaling by blocking SMAD4 activation. (3) TGF-β/SMAD signaling
  is also involved in miRNA biogenesis e.g miR-21. (4) Certain other miRNAs like miR-155
  and miR-224 can also be influenced by TGF-β/SMAD mediated signaling cascade. (5)
  Pharmacological inhibition of SMAD4 protein by small molecule inhibitor SB-431542
  leads to modulation of miRNAs downstream of TGF-β/SMAD signaling. (B) In the presence
  of SHH ligand, the PTCH1-SMO association gets remitted, resulting in enhanced downstream
  transcriptional activation of GLI family of proteins leading to target gene expression.
  (1) Use of small molecule inhibitor, Vismodegib (GDC-0449) inhibits hedgehog signaling
  pathway thereby interfering with regulation of miR-200b and let-7c, that are critical
  regulators of EMT and drug resistance (2) Whereas indirect inhibition of SHH activation
  by synthetic miRNA (GLI-1-miR-3548) targets GLI family of transcription factors
  that resulted in inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell division and proliferation.
  (3) Cyclopamine also appears to interrupt SHH signaling through regulating miRNAs
  (let7, miR-34, miR-107, miR-125, miR-128, miR-130, miR-132 and miR-141) responsible
  for stem cell self -renewal process.
