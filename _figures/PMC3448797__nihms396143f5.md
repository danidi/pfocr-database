caption: Pathways involving ECM, MCM and HCM. Reactions shown in red represent the
  ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for acetyl-CoA assimilation while those in black represent
  reactions within this pathway that lead to glyoxylate regeneration that supports
  the serine cycle. The pathway for degradation of MBTE is shown in blue.
