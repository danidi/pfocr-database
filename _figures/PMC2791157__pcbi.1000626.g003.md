caption: 'ATRA is able to diffuse freely across the cell membrane. A pair of cellular
  retinoic acid binding proteins act as cell surface receptors for retinoids however
  these have been shown to be dispensable in retinoic-acid signaling . ATRA binds
  to a family of nuclear hormone receptors called retinoic-acid receptors (RARs).
  There are three subtypes of the RAR family, these are encoded by different genes
  and denoted RAR-α, RAR-β, RAR-γ. Collins et al  demonstrated that in HL-60 cells,
  ATRA induced granulocytic differentiation by binding RAR-α directly. RAR-α binds
  to specific cis-acting DNA sites, known as retinoic-acid response elements (RAREs).
  These RAREs are located in the promoter sequences of specific genes that are targets
  of RAR-α. In order to bind DNA efficiently, RARs must however form heterodimers
  with a second family of nuclear hormone receptors, the retinoid X receptors (RXRs),
  of which there are three subtypes: RXR-α, RXR-β, RXR-γ. Both RXRs and RARs function
  as ligand-dependent transcription factors. One of the RAR-target genes whose expression
  is upregulated is the cell cycle protein p21 . p21 inhibits the cyclin dependent
  kinase complex Cyclin E and CDK2. In this way, ATRA induces cell cycle arrest at
  the G1 to S phase transition checkpoint.'
