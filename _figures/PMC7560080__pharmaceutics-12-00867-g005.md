caption: 'NLRP3 inflammasome activation via mitochondrial stress. After TLR4 recognition
  of a ligand, two main pathways are activated: the NF-κB pathway in an early phase,
  via MyD88 (not shown), and the IRF1, via TRIF. IRF1 triggers the transcription of
  CMPK2, a rate-limiting enzyme that supplies deoxyribonucleotides for mtDNA synthesis.
  CMPK2 translocates to the mitochondria, where it is involved in mtDNA synthesis.
  Upon mitochondrial stress, mitochondria produce ROS, which promote mtDNA oxidation.
  Ox-mtDNA is then broken into small fragments that are released into the cytosol,
  where they potentiate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to more conversion
  of pro-IL-1β in IL-1β. Simultaneously, cardiolipin moves from the inner mitochondrial
  membrane to the outer surface where it binds to the LRR domain (not shown) and activates
  the NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Created with BioRender.com.'
