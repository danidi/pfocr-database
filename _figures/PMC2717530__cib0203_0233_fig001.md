caption: Inter-relationship between ER and cell wall stress response in yeast. Cell
  wall and ER stress both activate cell wall and unfolded protein (UPR) genes through
  the cell wall integrity MAP kinase pathway and UPR pathways. Pathways with dashed
  lines involve intermediate steps with unclear mechanisms.
