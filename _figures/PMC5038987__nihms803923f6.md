caption: The proposed mechanism of the priming phase of complement-induced liver regeneration.
  Complement activation induced by liver injury or PHx increases the concentration
  of the complement effector proteins, C3a and C5a, which bind to the nearby Kupffer
  cells to release TNFα. TNFα then binds to the receptors on hepatocytes to initiate
  the MAPK pathway and its downstream immediate-early genes such as c-fos and SOCS3.
  This leads to activation of acute phase proteins such as SAA that can replace the
  lipoprotein of HDL to form acute-phase HDL. Acute-phase HDL promotes lower cholesterol
  efflux than native HDL, which causes hepatocytes to respond by activating LXR through
  oxysterols to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis for stable cholesterol levels. TNFα
  can also inhibit insulin signaling, potentially through the MAPK pathway, which
  then reduces the expression of HMGCR, a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis.
  The reduced cholesterol biosynthesis allows hepatocytes to use their cellular resources
  to meet other metabolic demands required for upcoming prolonged proliferation of
  liver regeneration.
