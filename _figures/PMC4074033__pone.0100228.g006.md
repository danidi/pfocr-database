caption: Nocodazole treatment reduces the level of phosphorylated Cdc2. The viral
  nuclear antigen LANA binds directly to Chk2, which may result in the phosphorylation
  of Cdc25c and sequester it in the cytoplasm. Thus, it may be unable to regulate
  the phosphorylation of nuclear Cdc2 resulting the activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 and
  progression through the G2/M phase, releasing the nocodozole induced block.
