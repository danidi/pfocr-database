caption: Role of Ras pathway proteins in exo-some biogenesis, cargo selection and
  release. Summary diagram showing different components of the Ras pathway and their
  roles in exosome biology. Exosomes are small vesicular structures that have a lipid
  bilayer. The bilayer is embedded with several macro and micromolecules including
  MHC class II, tetraspanins, immunoglobulins, receptors. These bilayered vesicles
  carry several types of cargoes such as mRNA, DNA, microRNAs etc. Ras, MAPK, CDC42,
  GTPases and their effectors such as p21 activated kinases have also been detected
  in exosomes. EGFR and EGFR-p are recognized for their role in exosome biogenesis
  and are also detected in intact exosomes. Ras and its downstream pathway proteins
  such as Rho, Rac and CDC42 GTPases, and their effectors are also known to promote
  exosome biogenesis, mediate cargo selection and induce exo-some release. Small GTPases
  have also been documented in stabilizing the phospholipases present in the exosome
  bilayer (shaded triangle). ERKs have been reported to play a role in facilitating
  exosome uptake.
