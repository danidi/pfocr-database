caption: In normoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α is hydroxylated by prolyl
  hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD), which uses oxygen and α-KG as substrates. Hydroxylated
  HIF-1α is recognized by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which facilitates HIF-1α ubiquitination,
  and such modification subjects HIF-1α to proteasomal degradation. Upregulation of
  HIF-1 signaling has been observed in many cancers caused by aberrant activation
  of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway leading to an increase of HIF-1α translation. The inhibition
  of PHD by decrease of α-KG, increase of competitive inhibitors, and inactivation
  of enzyme activity mediated by reactive oxidative species (ROS) or NO have been
  observed. In addition, loss-of-function mutation of VHL also contributes to HIF-1α
  stabilization. HIF-1α associates with HIF-1β and binds to the hypoxia response element
  (HRE) of promoters resulting in transcription of target genes, including those involved
  in glycolysis regulation. Herein, HIF-1α stabilization contributes to tumor glycolytic
  phenotype.
