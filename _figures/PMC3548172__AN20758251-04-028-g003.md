caption: Cooperation of esBAF and PRC2 during pluripotency maintenance. esBAF and
  PRC2 can act both synergically and antagonistically. esBAF antagonizes PRC2 when
  regulating the target genes of the LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway, thus preparing the
  chromatin structure for activation by the phosphorylated STAT3 form (green arrow).
  Meanwhile, esBAF acts together with PRC2 to repress transcription of HOX genes (red
  lines with stoppers). However, expression of pluripotency genes can be activated
  or repressed by esBAF (blue arrow) []
