caption: A) Uridine diphospho-β-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is synthesized from
  glucose by hexose biosynthetic pathway (HBP), and acts as a source of monosaccharide
  N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The enzymes and the biosynthetic pathways involved
  in the process are depicted. Covalent attachment of GlcNAc to nuclear and cytosolic
  proteins is referred to as O-GlcNAcylation, which is catalyzed by a single enzyme,
  O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and the removal catalyzed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA). B) In
  Alzheimer’s disease brain, TAU phosphorylation has been found to be inversely related
  to tau O-GlcNAcylation. However, in Neuro2A cells, overexpression of OGA enhanced
  autophagy, decreased mutant HUNTINGTIN, and attenuated toxicity. Overexpression
  of OGT attenuated autophagy, and exacerbated mutant HUNTINGTIN accumulation and
  toxicity.
