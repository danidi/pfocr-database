caption: The role of p21 pathway on apoptosis and senescence after acute lung injury.
  A, In control mice, lung injury and mechanical stretch cause DNA damage and changes
  in the nuclear envelope, activating the cell senescence program. The amount of apoptotic
  cells depends on the equilibrium between the activation of proapoptotic responses
  triggered by injury itself and the antiapoptotic effects of the senescence inducer
  Cdkn1a (p21). B, In mice lacking Cdkn1a, absence of this antiapoptotic factor leads
  to an increase in apotosis and a more severe lung injury. C, Treatment with Lopinavir/ritonavir
  blocks the Lamin-A mediated chromatin remodeling, triggering a senescence-like response
  that increases p21 expression, thus decreasing apoptosis and lung damage.
