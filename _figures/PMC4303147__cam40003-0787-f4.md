caption: Dominant negative LMP1 inhibits proliferation of CAEBV T cells. (A) An illustration
  of the LMP1 signal pathway. LMP1 molecules form an oligomer that is required for
  its signaling activity (the oligomer is designated as a dimer for simplification).
  (B) DN-LMP1 has point mutations that modify the PXQXT motif in the TES1 domain to
  AXAXT and the YYD in the tail of TES2 to IID, resulting in the dysregulated signaling
  activity. (C) The growth rates of Jurkat and SNT16 cells were assessed after transient
  transfection with empty vector (Vec) or DN-LMP1 (DN). Experiments were performed
  in triplicate and data are presented as means with standard errors. Western blotting
  results for the expression of LMP1, phospho-AKT (pAKT), AKT, and actin are shown
  underneath the growth bars.
