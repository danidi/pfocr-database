caption: The branched tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway of plants. The names of the
  precursors and end products of the branched tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway are
  indicated with gray. Enzyme catalyzed reactions are indicated with gray arrows.
  The feedback inhibition of glutamyl tRNA reductase by heme is indicated with a gray
  T bar. The names of proteins, such as regulatory proteins and enzymes, are indicated
  with black. The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway was adapted from  and . Genes
  encoding enzymes or enzyme subunits are indicated with blue. Mutants discussed in
  the text are indicated with red. gun5, cch, and chlh are mutant alleles of ChlH/GUN5.
  chld is a mutant allele of ChlD. cs, ch-42, and chli1 are mutant alleles of ChlI1.
  chli2 is a mutant allele of ChlI2.
