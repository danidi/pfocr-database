caption: Type I Interferon signaling pathway. Activation—IFNα or IFNβ binding to the
  IFNAR receptor complex, a heterodimer consisting of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, induces cross-phosphorylation
  of the proteins Tyk2 and Jak1, which are associated with IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, respectively.
  Subsequently, STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated and associate with IRF9 to form
  a transcriptional complex that translocates into the nucleus and interacts with
  interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) to induce transcription of interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs) including isg15, mx1, usp18 and ifit1. Inhibition—Interferon signaling
  is restrained or inhibited by USP18, which associates with IFNAR2 and competes for
  binding with Jak1, thus blocking the association between IFNAR and Jak1 and preventing
  phosphorylation and the downstream cascades. Dysregulation—In the mouse USP18 KO
  and in human patients with deficient USP18, the interferon signaling pathway is
  dysregulated at several levels. INFAR complex formation and activation is unrestrained
  in the absence of signal, and hypersensitized to inflammatory events that produce
  low levels of IFNs. This results in persistent phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2
  and elevated ISG expression. ISG15 accumulates as a consequence of increased transcription
  and is not cleaved from ISGylated proteins. Consequently, microglia are activated
  and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines to induce CNS inflammation. Clinical outcomes
  of this observed in humans and mice are hydrocephalus, microcephaly, white matter
  microgliopathy, and early death
