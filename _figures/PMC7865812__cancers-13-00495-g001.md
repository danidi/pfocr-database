caption: Contribution of transcription factors (TFs) to disease progression. Multiple
  transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers contribute to disease progression.
  Some are pleiotropic and affect multiple key biological pathways (multi-colored).
  Others (although affecting several systems in a global way) predominantly affect
  single key developmental and biochemical pathways such as growth (purple array)
  and lineage determination or differentiation (green array). Moreover, pleiotropic
  TFs may be predominantly active at an early stage in disease evolution, whilst single
  pathway TFs are most prominent later in disease progression. This is exemplified
  by the phenomenon that localized prostate cancer (PCa) does not display a high proliferative
  index or huge fluctuations in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level prior to
  treatment (a marker of a transformed, differentiated prostate). As such, TFs are
  ever-present throughout disease evolution and collaborate to promote tumor differentiation,
  growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. The purple array includes tumour
  protein 53 (TP53), E2 factor (E2F) and retinoblastoma protein (RB1). The green array
  includes the twist family BHLH transcription factor 1 (TWIST1), achaete-scute family
  BHLH transcription factor 1 (ASCL1), N-Myc and the sex determining region Y-box
  2 (SOX) TF family. Individual TFs include the androgen receptor (AR), enhancer of
  zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), forkhead box A1 (FOXA1),
  Myc and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1alpha). Created with BioRender.com.

  description: Contribution of transcription factors (TFs) to disease progression.
    Multiple transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers contribute to disease
    progression. Some are pleiotropic and affect multiple key biological pathways
    (multi-colored). Others (although affecting several systems in a global way) predominantly
    affect single key developmental and biochemical pathways such as growth (purple
    array) and lineage determination or differentiation (green array). Moreover, pleiotropic
    TFs may be predominantly active at an early stage in disease evolution, whilst
    single pathway TFs are most prominent later in disease progression. This is exemplified
    by the phenomenon that localized prostate cancer (PCa) does not display a high
    proliferative index or huge fluctuations in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
    level prior to treatment (a marker of a transformed, differentiated prostate).
    As such, TFs are ever-present throughout disease evolution and collaborate to
    promote tumor differentiation, growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.
    The purple array includes tumour protein 53 (TP53), E2 factor (E2F) and retinoblastoma
    protein (RB1). The green array includes the twist family BHLH transcription factor
    1 (TWIST1), achaete-scute family BHLH transcription factor 1 (ASCL1), N-Myc and
