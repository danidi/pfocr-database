caption: (A) A simplified interaction schema between EV-derived miRNAs and changes
  in gene expression in osteosarcoma cells (B) Metabolic pathways involved in osteosarcoma
  metastasis highlighting the lactate importer MCT1 (SLC16A1) and oxidative phosphorylation
  pathways (ATP5B). (C) Cell migration pathway in osteosarcoma associated with exposure
  to EV miRNAs emphasizing the interaction between the focal adhesion (PTK2) and oxidative
  stress pathways (NFE2L2).
