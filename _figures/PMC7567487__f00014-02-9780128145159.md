caption: Mammarenavirus life cycle. Mammarenavirus enter cells via receptor-mediated
  endocytosis (RME). There are some differences on the specific steps of the pathway
  used by different mammarenaviruses to reach the late endosome where the acidic environment
  triggers a pH-dependent fusion event between viral and cell membranes that releases
  the vRNP into the cytoplasm of the infected cells where viral RNA replication and
  gene transcription take place. Correct processing of GPC by the cellular signal
  peptidase and S1P protease is required for the formation of infectious progeny.
  The matrix Z protein plays critical roles mediating interactions between the vRNP
  and surface GP complex required for the formation of infectious progeny. Z is also
  the main driving force of mammarenavirus budding.
