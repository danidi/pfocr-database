caption: 'Diagram of folate and one-carbon metabolism in mammalian organisms. Intracellular
  one-carbon transfer reactions are essential for nucleotide (thymidylate and purine)
  synthesis and methylation of numerous compounds, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and
  phospholipids. These one-carbon transfer reactions are mainly supported by folate,
  a B vitamin that serves as a one-carbon carrier/donor. This diagram depicts absorption,
  transport, and metabolism of folate around the intracellular one-carbon metabolism
  as well as enzymes/proteins and other nutritional factors involved.– Folates in
  food, mostly polyglutamates, are hydrolyzed to monoglutamates by GGH in the gut
  and are absorbed across the intestinal mucosa with folic acid from fortified foods
  and supplements mostly by a saturable pH-dependent process, via reduced folate carrier
  (encoded by SLC19A1), and by passive diffusion at high concentrations. Once absorbed
  into the portal circulation, folates are taken up by the liver, where they are metabolized
  to polyglutamates by FPGS and retained or released into blood or bile as 5-methylTHF.
  Folate released in bile is reabsorbed in the small intestine. About two thirds of
  5-methylTHF, the predominant form of folate in circulation, is bound to low-affinity
  proteins, mostly albumin: low levels of high-affinity folate binders are also found
  in blood. Blood 5-methylTHF is transported into the cell by carrier-mediated or
  receptor-mediated mechanisms. Reduced folate carrier has a higher affinity for reduced
  folate than oxidized folic acid and accounts for the transport of most folate and
  methotrexate. Membrane-bound folate receptors, including folate receptor 1 encoded
  by FOLR1, with high affinity for folic acid are expressed in epithelial tissues,
  and its expression is elevated in malignant epithelial tumors. The predominant cytoplasmic
  folate, 5-methylTHF, donates its one-carbon moiety to methylate homocysteine to
  methionine, yielding THF. THF is a much preferred substrate to FPGS that lengthens
  the glutamate chain of the monoglutamate folate so folates can be retained in the
  cell. This polyglutamylation also enables folates to be used by one-carbon metabolizing
  enzymes that have much higher affinities for polyglutamates than monoglutamates.
  In deficiency of vitamin B12, which is a coenzyme for methionine synthase (MTR)
  that converts 5-methylTHF to THF, or with insufficient transcobalamins (TCN1, TCN2)
  for vitamin B12 absorption, deficiency of functional folate (THF) occurs despite
  sufficient folate in circulation (“methyl-trap”). MTR loses its activity when its
  vitamin B12–derived coenzyme, cobalamin, gets oxidized: MTRR reactivates MTR using
  the methyl supply from SAM. Homocysteine can be remethylated via an alternative
  mechanism of BHMT using betaine, supplied from dietary choline, in kidney and liver.
  Methionine, from homocysteine and also supplied from diet, is converted to SAM,
  a universal donor of one-carbon unit to numerous methylation reactions via MTs in
  part for DNA methylation. Resulting SAH is hydrolyzed to homocysteine, which then
  gets remethylated or catabolyzed via the transsulfuration pathway initiated by CBS.
  The active coenzyme THF obtains one-carbon moiety from amino acid serine via SHMT1
  catalysis, yielding 5,10-methyleneTHF, which is an important common substrate to
  methylation pathway described (remethylation of homocysteine to methionine) via
  MTHFR or to nucleic acid synthesis pathways via TYMS (uridylate to thymidylate conversion;
  pyrimidine synthesis) or MTHFD1/FTHFD (purine synthesis). DHF, the remnant of TYMS
  reaction on THF, is also supplied from folic acid that is reported to be found in
  blood in higher proportion than usual when a large dose is consumed from fortified
  foods or supplements. 5,10-MethenylTHF can be interconverted with 5-formylTHF (also
  known as folinic acid or leucovorin; thought to be the storage form of folate) via
  SHMT1/MTHFS. Although less understood, mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism is proposed
  to be in equilibrium with cytoplasmic metabolism and contains glycine cleavage system.
