caption: Schematic representation of the Fas pathway used in the mechanistic model.
  Molecules in blue are directly involved in Fas signalling; molecules in red are
  inhibitors of the pathway; intermediate reaction complexes are in black. The triggering
  molecule, FasL, is shaded in green. The output molecule is shaded in blue. Two green
  coloured reaction arrows represent transport type reactions. Numbers on the arrow
  indicate the corresponding reactions in electronic supplementary material.
