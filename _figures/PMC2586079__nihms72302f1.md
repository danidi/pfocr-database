caption: 'Complement has three initiating mechanisms known as the classical, lectin,
  and alternative pathways. The triggers for these pathways include: immune complexes,
  apoptotic bodies, mitochondrial membranes, mitochondrial cardiolipin, C-reactive
  protein, endothelial neoepitopes in ischemic tissue (classical pathway), carbohydrates
  on pathogens (lectin pathway) and “tickover, ”, polysaccharides, endotoxin, IgA
  immune complexes, C3 nephritic factor, absence or interference with regulatory proteins
  (alternative pathway) . Biological functions of the complement system are achieved
  through the production of activation fragments (e.g. C3a, C5a, C5b-9). The classical,
  lectin and alternative complement pathways converge to generate enzymes called C3
  convertases which cleave C3 into C3b and C3a. C3b is a major effector molecule of
  the complement system. C3b binds to the surface of foreign cells and opsonizes the
  cells for phagocytosis. Through a series of reactions the membrane attack complex
  (MAC) is formed. This complex can insert into membranes and has the potential to
  damage cells. Factors B, D and Properdin initiate activation of C3 directly through
  the alternative pathway initiation complex or through the amplification loop when
  C3b is formed. The Bb activation product is derived from factor B and serves as
  a protease that is able to cleave additional C3 molecules. In the absence of Bb
  generation, no alternative pathway activation is possible. The production of C3b,
  triggered from engagement of the classical or lectin pathways is augmented through
  the alternative pathway amplification loop that is essential to generate pathogenic
  pro-inflammatory mediators in vivo .'
