caption: Labeling patterns from [3-13C]glucose resulting from the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), glycolysis, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. The circles
  symbolize the carbon backbone of the molecules. Dark grey circles mark the position
  of the label resulting from the PPP. Filled circles indicate that all the molecules
  are labeled in the position indicated. Half-filled circles indicate that 50% of
  the molecules formed are labeled in that position. Grey crosses mark the position
  of the label resulting from glycolysis. Panel A displays glycolysis (right) and
  the PPP (left). Panel B displays labeling from acetyl CoA derived from either PPP
  or glycolysis in TCA cycle metabolites and glutamate and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA).
  Small circles indicate the molecules that are formed from the second turn of the
  TCA cycle. For simplicity, glyco-phosphates are not included, and only condensation
  of oxaloacetate with unlabeled acetyl CoA is shown for the second turn. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
  G-3-P, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate.
