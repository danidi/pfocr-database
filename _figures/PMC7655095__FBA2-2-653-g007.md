caption: Model for the Gb3‐cSrc correlated mutant p53 signaling pathways. Increased
  ceramide (Cer) glycosylation by GCS in cancer cells exposed to anticancer drugs
  in turn increases Gb3‐cSrc association in GEMs and downstream expression of missense
  p53 mutant protein via the cSrc/β‐catenin signaling pathway and deleterious alteration
  of pre‐mRNA splicing, thus promoting cancer drug resistance. Conversely, inhibition
  of GCS with PDMP or Genz‐161, silencing Gb3 synthase with siGb3S, or impeding Gb3‐cSrc
  interaction with STxB upregulates wild‐type p53 expression and sensitizes cancer
  cells to anticancer drugs. Gb3 is associated with cSrc in GEMs, possibly owing in
  part to palmitoylation of Src proteins
