caption: The mevalonate biosynthetic pathway in which farnesol is formed. The initial
  steps up to the synthesis of farnesyl-PP and farnesol are identical in insects and
  vertebrates. Later steps are different. Because Ecdysozoa ( = arthropods and nematodes)
  do not have the gene coding for squalene synthase, they cannot synthesize squalene
  and cholesterol by themselves. They acquire cholesterol from the food, as a vitamin,
  or by metabolization of some (ecdy)steroids. Insects can make esters of farnesol,
  the Juvenile Hormones (JHs), that are more potent than farnesol itself in specific
  bioassays for JH. Vertebrates do not make JHs, but some plants do. Adapted from  and
