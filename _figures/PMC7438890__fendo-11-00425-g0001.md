caption: The effect of local RAS on normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, as well as
  plasticity and systemic circulation, are shown (). Ang I, Ang II, Ac-SDKP, and Ang
  1-7 are secreted in different tissues and transferred to the BM through circulation.
  SP is secreted from the nerve end protruding into the BM. ACE converts Ang II from
  Ang I and reduces bioactive SP, Ac-SDKP and Ang 1-7 (). Mas, with the Ang 1-7 receptor,
  is detected in the BM. Peptides in RAS can stimulate hematopoietic cells (). Furthermore,
  local BM RAS has a function in the development, formation, proliferation, and differentiation
  of hematopoietic progenitors. Angiotensin peptides and steroid hormones were symbolized
  in gray. Lymphoid cells cannot differentiate throughout the normal B-cell pathway
  (). Therefore, the leader B-cell gene undergoes epigenetic initiation and enrichment
  of a precursor B-cell gene programme. As a result, cell cycle progression and cell
  proliferation are observed in mutant cells. This leads to the enlargement of a lymphoblast
  population and the development of leading B cell leukemia (, , , , , ). HSPC, Hematopoietic
