caption: Pulsatile release of GH may activate Stat5 to induce male-specific Cyp7b1
  expression and the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway. In Tgr5−/− mice, high
  levels of non-pulsatile GH secretion (GH resistance) may inhibit Cyp7b1 and Cyp27a1
  to reduce CDCA and MCA synthesized by the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway
  and increase CA synthesis. In fasted Tgr5−/− mice, GH resistance activates Stat5
  signaling to decrease Cd36 expression and uptake of free fatty acids into hepatocytes.
  Free fatty acids induce Pgc-1α, which increases fatty acid oxidation, but increase
  of Pgc-1α in Tgr5−/− mice dampens fasting-induced Fgf21 production. Lower Fgf21
  levels stimulate hepatic Stat5 activation and reduce hepatic steatosis. This Cd36-Fgf21-Stat5
  regulatory loop may regulate lipid metabolism during fasting and feeding cycles.
