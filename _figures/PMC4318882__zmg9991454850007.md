caption: The murine parturition pathway. The high levels of progesterone needed to
  maintain uterine quiescence during pregnancy are the result of a high rate of de
  novo synthesis and silencing of Ark1c18, a gene coding for 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (20α-HSD), the enzyme that inactivates progesterone by converting it to 20α-hydroxyprogesterone.
  The silencing of Ark1c18 requires activation of the prolactin receptor (PrlR) and
  is mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (Stat5b). Towards
  the end of pregnancy, uterine derived PGF2α engages the luteal FPR and activates
  Gq/11 to generate Gαq/11. The latter mediate the induction of luteal Akr1c18 that
  ultimately causes a drop in progesterone and precipitates parturition. The contribution
  made by this article is highlighted by the green rectangle. Nr4a1, a transcription
  factor that is proposed to mediate the enhanced expression of Ark1c18, is shown
  in gray, because redundant (but as yet undefined) pathways appear to mediate this
  induction (see text).
