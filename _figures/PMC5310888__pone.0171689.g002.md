caption: First, gene-level analysis was performed by comparing SS with control. The
  p-values from multiple studies were combined to compute a single p-value per gene.
  The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing (FDR). 200 genes with low p-value
  (p < 0.001) and large fold change (2 or greater) were considered significantly differentially
  expressed (up-regulated) in SS. The 200 up-regulated genes were subjected to Over-Representation
  Analysis (ORA). Additional analyses [Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Signaling
  Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA)] were carried out on the genome-wide expression data.
  A single pathway (hsa04380—Osteoclast Differentiation) was returned as the common
  result of the three analyses. Up-regulated gene expression of Osteoclast differentiation
  pathway in SS was validated in two independent cohorts.
