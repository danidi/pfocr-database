caption: GSK-3 as a convergence point in hypertrophic signaling. Inhibition of GSK-3
  appears to be a key element in both adaptive and maladaptive hypertrophy. Growth
  factors, acting via Akt; neurohormonal mediators, acting via both Akt and PKCs (particularly
  PKCα); β-adrenergic agonists, acting via PKA; and biomechanical stress, acting via
  several mechanisms, possibly involving the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) or an ILK-associated
  protein, all lead to the inactivation of GSK-3. Therefore, GSK-3 appears to serve
  as a convergence point, integrating inputs from many prohypertrophic signals. Inhibition
  of GSK-3 releases a number of transcription factors from tonic inhibition, and also
  releases eIF2B, allowing activation of the protein synthetic machinery. Thus GSK-3
  affects both key components of the response, reprogramming of gene expression and
  activation of protein synthesis. Additional negative regulators of GSK-3 not shown
  include the serum and glucocorticoid–induced kinase (SGK) and, possibly, the ERK
  pathway target p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1).
