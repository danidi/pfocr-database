caption: Coordinating muscle-specific gene expression with cell cycle exit. (A) In
  proliferating cells, muscle-specific gene expression is prevented by phosphorylation
  of MyoD by CDK2-cyclin E, as well as inhibition of the collaborating MEF2 transcription
  factor by CDK4/6-cyclin D. In addition the scaffolding protein KAP1 is bound to
  MyoD-E12 and MEF2 transcription factors, which results in the recruitment of co-repressor
  complexes that also methylate and inhibit MyoD and MEF2. The presence of PcG complexes
  further inhibits transcription of muscle specific genes. Reduction of growth factors
  allows differentiation, in part through downregulation of the inhibitory phosphorylations.
  Simultaneously, differentiation signals induce p38 MAPK activation. Activation of
  p38 results in phosphorylation of BAF60c bound to MyoD, which triggers the assembly
  of a functional SWI/SNF complex onto the preassembled MyoD/BAF60c pioneer complex.
  Recruitment of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler contributes to the replacement of
  PcG complexes and results in the formation of an open and active chromatin state.
  In addition, p38 MAPK phosphorylates MEK2, which induces recruitment of an MLL2-menin
  HMT transcriptional activator. As a third mechanism, activation of the p38 MAPK
  pathway leads to phosphorylation of KAP1, thereby triggering release of co-repressors
  and recruitment of co-activators at target gene promoters. See text for further
  information and references.
