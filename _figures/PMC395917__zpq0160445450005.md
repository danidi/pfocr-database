caption: Schematic representation of BMP4 and LIF signaling in pluripotency. Upon
  dimeric BMP4 binding to the receptor complex, type II BMP receptor (RII) phosphorylates
  and activates type IA receptor (ALK3). Activated ALK3 causes the inactivation (dephosphorylation)
  of p38 and ERK MAPKs by unknown mechanisms. This inactivation relieves the negative
  effects of MAPKs on pluripotency (the proper levels of Oct4 and Nanog expression),
  as confirmed further by using MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059. As a result
  of the activation of ALK3, transcription of Xiap is up-regulated either by means
  of the inhibition of p38/ERK or activation of SMAD1/5/8 pathway. XIAP protein in
  the cytoplasm interacts with ALK3 and TAB1 to result in the activation of TAK1 by
  ALK3, consequently, a recovery of p38 activity. In the absence of ALK3, ALK1, or
  ALK2 proteins act as BMP4 type I receptor to maintain the pluripotency of ES cells.
  XIAP does not cause the loss of pluripotency in the absence of ALK3, presumably
  because of its inability to interact with ALK1 or ALK2. Lastly, the synergistic
  effect of BMP4 and LIF is likely attributed to the ability of BMP4 to antagonize
  the stimulation of ERK by LIF, inhibit p38 MAPK activity, and up-regulate Id genes
  and to the ability of LIF to activate JAK-STAT pathway. Solid lines indicate a direct
  effect.
