caption: Simplified scheme of the double-edged role of Akt in tumor development. Moderate
  or unsustained levels of Akt activity inhibit apoptosis and promote cell growth
  and angiogenesis through various downstream effectors. Inhibition of caspase-9 and
  the Bcl-2 protein Bad, or activation of MDM2 and NF-κB prevent apoptosis. In addition,
  stimulation of amino acid and glucose transporters (Glut), or inhibition of GSK3
  and tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (TSC2), along with the modulation of other not-indicated
  enzymes, exert growth-promoting effects by activating the mTOR pathway and oxidative
  metabolism. Akt can stimulate angiogenesis by activating endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase (eNOS) and HIF, which stimulate the expression of endothelial mitogens
  such as VEGF. Hyperactivation of Akt, in contrast, triggers senescence and apoptotic
  cell death, thereby preventing tumor progression. These effects involve increased
  ROS production as well as inhibition of FoxO transcription factors and the subsequent
  down-regulation of antioxidant enzymes, including sestrin-3, MnSOD, and catalase.
  Pro-oxidant conditions can activate p53, resulting either in senescence by induction
  of the Cdk inhibitor p21 or in apoptosis by activation of BH3-only proteins. In
  addition, the atypical nuclear expression of Akt can induce apoptosis by triggering
  unscheduled activation of the cell cycle-regulatory kinase Cdk2, either by direct
  phosphorylation or by induction of p27 degradation. Several interfering pathways
  and downstream effectors of Akt are omitted for clarity.

  description: Simplified scheme of the double-edged role of Akt in tumor development.
    Moderate or unsustained levels of Akt activity inhibit apoptosis and promote cell
    growth and angiogenesis through various downstream effectors. Inhibition of caspase-9
    and the Bcl-2 protein Bad, or activation of MDM2 and NF-κB prevent apoptosis.
    In addition, stimulation of amino acid and glucose transporters (Glut), or inhibition
    of GSK3 and tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (TSC2), along with the modulation of
    other not-indicated enzymes, exert growth-promoting effects by activating the

    endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and HIF, which stimulate the expression
    of endothelial mitogens such as VEGF. Hyperactivation of Akt, in contrast, triggers
