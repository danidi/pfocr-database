caption: '. : mechanisms of “early-phase” and “late-phase” immunity. Parasite development
  after traversal of the midgut epithelium is subjected to two “phases” of the mosquito
  innate immune response. An “early-phase” limits the ookinete survival before or
  at the transition to oocyst differentiation. As ookinetes traverse the midgut epithelium
  they undergo nitration (red dots) and in this way are “marked” for immune recognition
  by complement-like proteins circulating in the mosquito haemolymph [including thioester
  protein 1 (TEP1)]. Following recognition, TEP1 binds to the ookinete surface to
  initiate lysis or melanisation that result in parasite killing. A second, “late-phase”
  immune response limits oocyst survival and involves the production of nitric oxide
  (NO) by the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway leading
  to parasite killing. While increased levels of NO have been implicated in this process,
  it is unclear to what extent the midgut, fat body and possibly haemocytes may contribute
  to the “late-phase” response. This figure was adapted from  and . APL1: Anopheles
  Plasmodium-responsive leucine-rich repeat protein 1; BL: basal lamina; LRIM1: leucine-rich
