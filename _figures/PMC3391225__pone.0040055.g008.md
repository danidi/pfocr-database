caption: FAE induced conformational change in Bax through intracellular generation
  of ROS and triggered mitochondria mediated apoptosis involving loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential. The release of mitochondrial Cytochrome c, which functions as
  an electron carrier in the respiratory chain, translocated to the cytosol, where
  it participated in the activation of Caspase 9 and 7, leading to apoptotic events
  in the cells. FAE also induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, and photosensitization,
  but the exact mechanism by which this is brought about has to be investigated.
