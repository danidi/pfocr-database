caption: Autophagy in neutrophil biology and disease. Autophagy has a central key
  role in neutrophil biology by (A) promoting intracellular elimination of pathogens
  (xenophagy), (B) accelerating phagocytosis (LAP), (C) interplaying with ROS, (D)
  regulating degranulation, (E) facilitating the resolution of inflammation via NETotic
  cell death, and (F) leading to externalization of various NET-bound bioactive proteins
  (depicted as red spherical spots). The enhancement of autophagic machinery (e.g.,
  IVIG, clarithromycin) increases the antimicrobial capacity of neutrophils. On the
  contrary, blocking autophagy pathway at initial (e.g., IFNλ1, LMWH) or late steps
  (e.g., HCQ) could be beneficial for neutrophil-driven inflammatory or thrombotic
  diseases. REDD1/mTOR pathway is a main regulator of autophagy in neutrophils. DAMPS,
  damage-associated molecular patterns; PAMPS, pathogen-associated molecular patterns;
  P, phosphorylation; PolyP, inorganic polyphosphate; REDD1, regulated in development
  and DNA damage responses 1; LAP, LC3-associated phagocytosis; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; LMWH, low molecular weight heparin; IVIG, intravenous
  immunoglobulin; Symbol “?” denotes the possible target of the anti-autophagic action.
