caption: 'Proposed signaling pathways in the development of hepatic portal hypertension.
  RhoA/Rho-kinase: GGPP “lipidizes” RhoA to form membrane-bound RhoA and to activate
  Rho-kinase. AT1R stimulates JAK2 to phosphorylate and then activate Rho-kinase.
  Activated Rho-kinase phosphorylates the myosin targeting subunit 1, which inactivates
  myosin phosphatase. The inactivation of myosin phosphatase increases the phosphorylation
  of myosin light chain and promotes vasoconstriction. CPI-17 combines with myosin
  light chain phosphatase to inhibit the activation of the enzymes and promote the
  contraction of smooth muscle cells. The activation of Rho-kinase could downregulate
  the expression of eNOS and reduce its activity. The coupling of AT1R to Gaq/11 and
  Ga12/13 promotes Rho-kinase activation, which is involved in extracellular matrix
  production. JAK2/STAT3: Cytokines activate the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Enhanced JAK2/STAT3
  signaling upregulates TGF-β and iNOS expression and accelerates intestinal inflammation,
  which aggravates endothelial dysfunction and angiogenesis. IL-6 binds to its receptor,
  activates JAK2, phosphorylates it, and then causes the phosphorylation of STAT3
  in cells, thereby activating HSC and promoting hypoxia inducible factor expression.
  These events can upregulate the activation of IL-6 and reactivate the STAT3 pathway,
  which forms a loop, constantly activating HSC, causing vessel contraction, and ultimately
  increasing portal pressure. AT1R: Angiotensin-type II receptor 1; CPI-17: C-protein
