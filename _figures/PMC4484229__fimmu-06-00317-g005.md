caption: Serum C1 competes with Wnt for Fz receptor binding, resulting in Wnt canonical
  pathway activation. Wnt binds to Fz receptor and LRP5/6 which causes β-catenin destruction
  complex (APC, PP2A, GSK3, and CK1α) by recruiting the Axin component of destruction
  complex to the cytoplasmic tail of the Wnt co-receptor LRP. This results in stabilization
  and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which eventually gets translocated
  into the nucleus to act as a transcriptional co-activator of the TCF/LEF family
  and the Wnt canonical pathway is activated, which has been shown to induce aging.
  C1q concentration in the serum increases with age. C1q competes with 200-fold higher
  binding affinity with Wnt for Fz receptor and stimulates C1s-dependent cleavage
  of the ectodomain of LRP6. The C1q binding to Fz receptor also blocks the β-catenin
  destruction complex (APC, PP2A, GSK3, and CK1α) and results in stabilization of
  β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which is then translocated into the nucleus. Subsequently,
  canonical Wnt signaling is activated.
