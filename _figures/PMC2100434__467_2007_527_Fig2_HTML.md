caption: Growth hormone-mediated JAK/STAT signal transduction. GH activates several
  signaling pathways via JAK2, including the JAK/STAT pathway [, ]. Binding of GH
  to its receptor (GHR) activates JAK2, which then self-phosphorylates. This is followed
  by phosphorylation of the GHR and, subsequently, STAT 1a, STAT 3, STAT 5a, and STAT 5b,
  members of a larger family of cytoplasmic transcription factors. These phosphorylated
  STATs form dimers that enter the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA sequences
  and activate their target genes, IGF-1 and some suppressors of cytokine signaling
  (SOCS). Deletion of STAT5 expression leads to retarded body growth, and STAT5b is
  required for GH-mediated IGF-1 gene expression. In renal failure phosphorylation
  of JAK2 and the downstream signaling molecules STAT5, STAT3, and STAT1 is impaired,
  as are the nuclear levels of phosphorylated STAT proteins. This important cause
  of uremic GH resistance may result, in part, from up-regulation of SOCS2 and SOCS3
  expression with suppressed GH signaling and also from increased protein tyrosine
  phosphatase activity, with enhanced dephosphorylation and deactivation of the signaling
  proteins. Reprinted from [] with permission
