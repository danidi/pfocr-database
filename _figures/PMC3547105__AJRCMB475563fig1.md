caption: 'The autotaxin-LPA-LPA1pathway. Generation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)
  by autotaxin, and LPA signaling through LPA1; both are required for bleomycin-induced
  pulmonary fibrosis in mice, and both have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in humans. The majority of LPA in vivo appears to
  be produced by conversion of phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophospholipids
  such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) through the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
  family members, followed by the conversion of these lysophospholipids to LPA through
  the lysophospholipase D activity of autotaxin. Once generated by autotaxin, LPA
  signals through specific cell surface G protein–coupled receptors: five high-affinity
  LPA receptors have been definitively established and designated LPA1 to LPA5; a
  lower-affinity receptor is likely to join the LPA receptor family as LPA6. LPA signaling
  specifically through LPA1 has pro-fibrotic effects on epithelial cells, endothelial
  cells, and fibroblasts, promoting epithelial cell apoptosis, inducing vascular leak,
  and directing fibroblast recruitment, proliferation, and persistence. LPA–LPA2signaling
  may also have pro-fibrotic effects, inducing activation of latent TGF-β by lung
  epithelial cells, although LPA signaling through LPA2 on leukocytes may serve to
  prevent excess innate immune activation after tissue injury.'
