caption: NF-κB activation pathways. In the canonical pathway, stimulation of receptors
  such as TNFR1 activates the IκK complex, which comprises IκKα/β and γ (NEMO) and
  results in phosphorylation of IκBα. Subsequently, ubiquitin-dependent degradation
  of IκBα releases NF-κB dimers that translocate to the nucleus and modulate target
  gene expression. The alternate pathway is triggered by surface receptors such as
  B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFFR), which stimulates a cascade involving
  NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IκK-α. In this response, proteosomal processing
  of p100 leads to formation of p52-containing dimers that modulate the genes regulating
  lymphoid development and B-cell maturation. The atypical response comprises a number
  of pathways that are induced by genotoxic stressors such as DNA double-strand breaks
  (DSBs) and replication stress (RS). In response to DSBs, ATM interacts with sumoylated
  nuclear NEMO, resulting in sequential phosphorylation and mono-ubiquitination of
  NEMO. Subsequently, cytoplasmic translocation of ATM/NEMO leads to stimulation of
  IκK activity. RS activates ATR, which induces Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of both
  p50 and p65 and leads to promoter-specific modulation of NF-κB target genes that
  act to promote cytotoxicity.
