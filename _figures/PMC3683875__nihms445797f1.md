caption: Nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. In global genome repair (GGR) the
  XPC and XPE(DDB2) gene products recognize the DNA damage such as cyclobutane pyrimidine
  dimers (CPDs) or 6–4 photoproducts (6–4 PP) and initiate the NER cascade. In transcription
  coupled repair (TCR) in actively transcribed genes, the stalled RNA polymerase II
  in concert with CSA(ERCC8) and CSB(ERCC6) gene products initiate the NER cascade.
  XPB(ERCC3) and XPD(ERCC2) gene products are components of the 10 subunit multiprotein
  complex TFIIH (transcription factor II H), and demarcate the damage due to their
  helicase activity. These helicases along with the XPA and XPG(ERCC5) gene products
  and replication protein A (RPA) unwind the DNA surrounding the lesion. The TTD-A(GTF2H5)
  gene product is also part of the TFIIH complex. XPF(ERCC4) and XPG(ERCC5) gene products
  are endonucleases that cut the damage containing DNA strand removing the lesion
  along with a fragment of about 30 nucleotides. The resulting gap is filled using
  polymerases and ligases and the complementary DNA strand as a template. Mutations
  in the genes in rectangles have been associated with clinical disease. TagSNPs in
  XPC, XPE(DDB2), XPD(ERCC2) and XPG(ERCC5) genes (Skulls) are associated with increased
  risk of death from melanoma (See paper by Li et al in this issue). PCNA – proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen; RF-C replication factor C. (Figure modified from ()).
