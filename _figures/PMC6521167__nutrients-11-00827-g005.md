caption: The role of autophagy on biliary epithelium differentiation and homeostasis.
  Autophagy is involved in the maintenance and functions of progenitory cells in the
  liver (HPC). It negatively correlates with biliary tree formation, it decreases
  in the early stages of HPC development while it increases in the late stages. HPC
  differentiation to cholangiocyte is controlled by the Notch signaling pathway. In
  cholangiocytes, the under nutrient-rich condition or absence of rapamycin, mTOR
  blocks autophagy resulting in an increased Notch-STAT3 cascade signaling pathway
  and promoting cellular differentiation. On the contrary, autophagy induction via
  rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) or nutrient deprivation attenuates the Notch signaling
  pathway resulting in a reduced biliary differentiation.
