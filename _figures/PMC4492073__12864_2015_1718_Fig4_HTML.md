caption: Expression of transcripts conferring flower color in Medicago sativa ssp.
  sativa (B47) and Medicago sativa ssp. falcata (F56). Expression patterns comparing
  B47 and F56 are presented as heat map blocks. a Anthocyanin biosynthesis. Early
  in the pathway, transcripts are up-regulated 2-fold in B47 compared to F56 (blue
  blocks). This results in increased delphinidin, the anthocyanin that confers blue
  coloration to flowers. b Carotenoid biosynthesis. Transcripts involved in the conversions
  of trans-lycopene to δ-carotene and β-cryptoxinthin to zeantin, are up regulated
  17- and 6-fold, respectively, in F56 (yellow blocks). The increased carotene synthesis
  is responsible for the orange and yellow flower color, characteristic of F56
