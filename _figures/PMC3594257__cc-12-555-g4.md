caption: 'Figure 4. Network analysis of EVOO secoiridoids-regulated genes in human
  breast cancer cells. Left: Gene networks were constructed using ingenuity pathway
  analysis (Ingenuity® Systems). Data sets containing identifiers of genes with >
  2.0-fold up- or downregulatory changes were uploaded into the application. These
  “focus genes” were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information
  contained in the ingenuity pathway knowledge base. Networks of these “focus genes”
  (nodes) are algorithmically generated based on the principle that highly connected
  gene networks are most biologically meaningful. All edges are supported by at least
  one reference from the literature stored in the ingenuity pathway knowledge base
  (the IPA interaction database is manually curated by scientists and updated quarterly).
  Briefly, the user-input or “‘focus genes” gene list is compared with the “global
  molecular network” (GMN) database, which consists of thousands of genes and interactions.
  The focus genes are sorted based on highest to lowest connectivity within the GMN;
  networks of approximately 35 genes are then constructed beginning with the most
  highly connected focus gene. IPA assigns a p-value for a network of size n and an
  input focus gene list of size f by calculating the probability of identifying f
  or more focus genes in a randomly selected set of n genes from the GMN. The intensity
  of the node color indicates the degree of expression (green scale for downregulated
  nodes; red scale for upregulated nodes). The score indicates the likelihood that
  the genes in a network are found together by random chance. Using a 99% confidence
  interval, scores of ≥ 3 are significant. Nodes are displayed using various shapes
  that represent the functional class of the gene product (diamonds, enzymes; ovals,
  transcription factors; triangles, kinases; circles, others). A solid line indicates
  a direct interaction; a dashed line indicates an indirect interaction. A line without
  an arrowhead indicates binding, and a plus sign indicates that other networks contain
  this gene product. Figure shows up- and downregulated networks with the two highest
  IPA score (a composite measure that indicates statistical significance that molecules
  depicted in the network are interconnected). Right: Representative western blot
  analyses of SIRT1, total AMPK, and phosphorylated AMPK (fosfo-AMPKαThr172) in EVOO
  untreated- (control) and secoiridoids-treated JIMT1 breast cancer cells.'
