caption: Proposed model for signal transduction pathways regulating development and
  growth in P. marneffei. GasA signaling at 25°C involves a cAMP-PKA pathway in the
  regulation of asexual development and the expression of the core regulatory factors
  BrlA and AbaA. GasA has no apparent role during yeast cell morphogenesis at 37°C.
  Therefore, we hypothesize the presence of a brlA repressor (black box) as well as
  an abaA activator (white box) which are independent of GasA signaling at this temperature.
