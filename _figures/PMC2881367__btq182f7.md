caption: CircleMap display of the ErbB2 pathway. For each node, ER status, IPAs, expression
  data and copy-number data are displayed as concentric circles, from innermost to
  outermost, respectively. The apoptosis node and the ErbB2/ErbB3/neuregulin 2 complex
  node have circles only for ER status and for IPAs, as there are no direct observations
  of these entities. Each patient's data is displayed along one angle from the circle
  center to edge.
