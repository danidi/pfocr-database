  a dormancy signature (NR2F1high/NR2F1 targetshigh) either dormancy maintaining therapy
  could be applied or therapies that eliminate these cells could be used (lower part

  convert these residual tumor cells back to dormancy. This combination might also

  dormancy biomarkers and to examine the long-lasting treatment efficacy over years.

  design of treatments that allow terminal differentiation of residual tumor cells
  would entirely prevent the reawakening of DTCs and induce an extended long-term
  remission phase (2).
