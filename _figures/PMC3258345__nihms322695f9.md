caption: The relationship between high glucose, oxidative stress and impaired RAR/RXR
  signaling are proposed. Retinoic acid, through activation of RAR/RXR-mediated signaling,
  inhibits intracellular oxidative stress and the JNK pathway, protecting cardiomyocytes
  from HG-induced apoptosis. High glucose promotes oxidative stress, which leads to
  activation of the JNK pathway and degradation of RAR/RXR, resulting in repression
  of RAR/RXR signaling. Impaired RAR/RXR signaling further potentiates intracellular
  oxidative stress and activation of JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling.
