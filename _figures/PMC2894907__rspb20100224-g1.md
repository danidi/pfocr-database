caption: 'Comparison of photosynthetic pathways. Transverse sections showing the different
  anatomies characteristic of the pathways and schematic descriptions of the route
  taken by carbon during photosynthesis. The path taken by a carbon molecule during
  fixation is given at the top: C6H12O6 (glucose) is used as a proxy for more complex
  carbohydrates; RuBP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; conc.,
  concentrated. Sections are modified from illustrations in ; , and an unaccessioned
  anatomical slide from the botany collections of the National Museum of Natural History.
  Light grey shading shows gas spaces and the icons show the different locations of
  carbon storage, fixation, and transport via the C3 and C4 cycles in each metabolic
  pathway.'
