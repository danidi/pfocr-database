caption: The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through the RIP1-RIP3 signaling
  pathway. The activation of RIP1-RIP3 damages the mitochondria by activating the
  DRP1. This results in excessive production of ROS and subsequent trigger activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. RIP3 also destructs lysosomal membrane stability, leading
  to hydrolase release (such as cathepsin-B) and activation of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory
  factors.
