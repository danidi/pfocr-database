caption: A schematic model of the viral inhibition by the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP pathway
  during PPV infection. PPV strain TJ infection induces ER stress and apoptosis. ER
  stress induction was associated with PPV infection and mainly mediated by the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP
  pathway, but not the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways. PPV-induced ER stress accelerates apoptotic
  cell death and suppresses PPV replication.
