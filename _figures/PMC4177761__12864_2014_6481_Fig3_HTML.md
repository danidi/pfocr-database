caption: Purine biosynthetic pathway associated with the LCA. In red are all the steps
  associated with the LCA. In white is the semienzymatic pathway associated with an
  early stage of cell development, previously proposed by Becerra et al.[]. The proposed
  ancestral histidine biosynthesis that feeds AICAR is displayed in a box with bars.
  The substrates with prebiotic origins are shown in blue circles. Ribonucleotides
  that may have occurred in the LCA are in purple circles. The thiamine (vitamin B1)
  metabolism is in gray. In dashed lines, is indicated the AICAR in backflow as a
  seed substrate to AIR.
