caption: The pathologic role of TCR, BCR and TH17-induced MALT-1 in demyelination
  and the inhibition of this signaling pathway by A20. As depicted in Figure , downstream
  of CBM, IKK complex is activated by MALT-1 that in turn, plays an essential role
  in the development of EAE-mediated Demyelination. MALT1, in other hand, cleaves
  the NF-κB inhibitory proteins A20 and CYLD as well as the NF-κB subunit RelB in
  antigen receptor-stimulated T cells and during EAE, suggesting a contribution of
  MALT1 proteolytic activity in T cell activation and EAE development. A20, negatively
  regulates TCR and BCR signaling to NF-κB by cleaving MALT-1 ubiquitin chains and
  therefore contributes to balance TCR/BCR-induced IKK/NF-KB signaling. Activated
  A20 might play an important role in protecting neural cells against autoimmune mediated
  demyelination.
