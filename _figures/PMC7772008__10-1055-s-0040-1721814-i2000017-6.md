caption: 'Schematic illustration of the pathways leads to cancer due to chronic alcohol
  intake. Alcohol inhibits various enzymes and folate as described, alters the ratios
  of SAM/SAH and NADH/NAD + , increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and
  lipopolysaccharides (LPS), all of these leading to cancer via: (1) DNA hypomethylation.
  (2) Increased histone acetylation. (3) Upregulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  pathway. (4) Chromosomal damage. DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; dUMP, deoxyuridine
  monophosphate; GSH, glutathione; Hcy, homocysteine; 8OHdG, 8-hydroxy-2''-deoxyguanosine;
  MS, methionine synthase; MAT, methionine adenosyl transferase; NAD + , nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; NADH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  SAM, S-adenosyl-methionine; SIRT1, Sirtuin 1.'
