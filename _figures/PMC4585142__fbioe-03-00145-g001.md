  lpdA, aceE, and aceF, coding for PYR dehydrogenase subunits; gltA, citrate synthase;
  pck, PEP carboxykinase; ppc PEP carboxylase; ppsA, PEP synthetase. SA pathway intermediates
  and genes: DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate; DHQ, 3-dehydroquinate;
  DHS, 3-dehydroshikimate; SA, shikimic acid; S3, SHK-3-phosphate; EPSP, 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate
