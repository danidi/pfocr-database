caption: Wild-type p53 is expressed at low levels and inactive in most cells. However,
  p53 is stabilized and activated in response to DNA damage, aberrant oncogene signaling,
  and other stresses that could potentially drive a normal cell towards tumorigenesis.
  P53 that is stabilized and activated in response to these stresses can promote survival,
  senescence, or apoptosis. Factors that can determine the choice of response to p53
  are listed.
