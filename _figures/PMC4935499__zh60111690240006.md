caption: 'Model depicting a role for the insulin/FoxO signaling pathway in diapause
  regulation of the mosquito Culex pipiens. A: in response to the long daylengths
  of early summer, insulin signaling leads to juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and
  ovarian development and the concurrent suppression of the transcription factor Foxo.
  B: in response to short daylengths of autumn, insulin signaling is shut down, allowing
  the activation of FoxO, which, in turn, is hypothesized to generate many features
  of the diapause phenotype. [Based on results discussed in Refs.  and ].'
