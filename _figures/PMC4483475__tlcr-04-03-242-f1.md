caption: 'Met is stabilised by loss of Tyr-1003. (A) Activation of wild-type Met is
  coupled with its internalisation and ubiquitylation by CBL allowing efficient sorting
  to the multivesicular body (MVB), and subsequent degradation by the lysosome; (B)
  following exon 14 skipping however, the juxtamembrane domain, including Tyr-1003
  is deleted. This prevents recruitment of CBL and thus Met ubiquitylation; as a consequence
  Met is not sorted to the MVB, instead being recycled back to the cell surface. Abbreviations:
  HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; p, phosphate; Ub, ubiquitin.'
