caption: 'Raf activation by Ras. Raf consists of a catalytic domain which has 2 lobes
  (C- and N-lobes), a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and Ras-binding domain (RBD). The
  CRD connects to the catalytic domain via a flexible hinge region. In resting cells
  (bottom of figure), Raf monomers are autoinhibited by their CRD domain which interacts
  with the catalytic domain. Interaction with membrane-anchored GTP-bound Ras relieves
  the autoinhibition. RBD at the N-terminal of Raf interacts with Ras, swinging the
  CRD away, and exposing the Raf dimerization surface. Raf dimerizes by a side-to-side
  interaction, creating an asymmetric active dimer. Raf''s CRD interacts with the
  membrane, stabilizing the complex. This architecture effectively creates a Raf-linked
  Ras dimer. However, in addition, it is currently believed that Ras also forms direct
  dimers. While dimerization and clustering provide co-localization and leads to cooperativity,
  here our major tenet is that they drive specificity and that this is the major reason
  that they evolved. Clustering can help thwart pathway redundancy of Ras isoforms.
  The protein databank (PDB) codes for the structures shown here are: 1UWH (Raf dimer),
  2L05 (RBD), and 3GFT (Ras).'
