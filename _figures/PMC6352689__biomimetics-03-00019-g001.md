caption: 'Endocytic pathways. Endocytosis via membranous vesicles encompasses several
  mechanisms where the plasmalemma internalizes objects (phagocytosis) and extracellular
  fluid (pinocytosis) in intracellular vesicles. Some vesicles concentrate receptors
  that mediate uptake of specific ligands via receptor-mediated endocytosis (marked
  by *), while others (e.g., macropinocytosis) largely internalize fluid and solutes
  by non-specific means. Pinocytosis is subdivided in macro- and micropinocytosis
  depending on the size of the vesicles that form and the latter can be mediated by
  classical (clathrin- and caveolae-mediated pathways) or non-classical (clathrin
  and caveolae independent) routes, all of which can be classified as per their dynamin
  dependence (marked by #). Apart from the trafficking destinations shown, some markers
  (e.g., platelet–endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) and intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) associated with the cell adhesion molecule (CAM)-mediated
  pathway) may shuttle back and forth between the cell surface and a subplasmalemma
  vesicular compartment whose membrane is continuous with the plasmalemma. Adapted
