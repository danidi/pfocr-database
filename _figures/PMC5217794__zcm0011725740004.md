caption: CBM immunology. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) are at the front line of
  defense and may respond differently to conidia or meristematic cells. (A) After
  recognition of conidia, engulfment and destruction occur, followed by inhibition
  of costimulatory molecules. Conidial antigens may be presented to T cells, which
  activates B cells to produce antibodies against CBM pathogens. (B) If muriform cells
  are present, although there is no phagocytosis by LCs, naive T cells may be activated
  and proliferate, amplifying the immune response. (C) Recognition of conidia by dendritic
  cells (DCs) can be made by the C-type lectin dectin-2 or Mincle. However, the dectin-2
  pathway leads to T-cell activation with proliferation of Th1 and Th17 cells, while
  Mincle signaling inhibits the same process, in a clear demonstration of PRR antagonism
  of the immune response following recognition of CBM fungi by DCs.
