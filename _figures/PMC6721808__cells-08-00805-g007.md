caption: 'Simplified model of fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Fatty acid synthesis (FAS)
  starts after acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA by ACC. Malonyl-CoA is then
  further processed by FAS. On the right hand side, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) of
  acyl-CoA begins after fatty acids are transported into the cell by CD36 and converted
  to acyl-CoA. The translocation of acyl-CoA into the mitochondria is facilitated
  by CPT1/2. Avocatin B accumulates in mitochondria to inhibit FAO. While proliferating
  cells show elevated FAS for the generation of membranes, HSCs/LSCs upregulate FAO
  to maintain quiescence controlled by PML-PPARδ-FAO axis. PDH3, which is downregulated
  in AML, promotes FAO by decreasing ACC2 activity. LKB1-AMPK pathway inhibits ACC
  proteins and promotes FAO. Dotted lines indicate target genes of PPARδ. Abbreviations:
  ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated kinase;
  CoA, Coenzyme A; CD, cluster of differentiation; CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase;
  FA, fatty acid; FABP, fatty acid binding protein; FADH2, flavin adenine dinucleotide;
  FAO, fatty acid oxidation; FASN, fatty acid synthase; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell;
  LSC, leukemic stem cell; LKB1, liver kinase B1; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;
  PDH3, Prolyl hydroxylase 3; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; PPARδ, Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. Circled numbers refer to metabolic response determinants
  in AML that are discussed in the Conclusion section.'
