caption: Schematic pathway of IL-8-mediated NAADP formation by CD38 in LAK cells.
  Ligation of IL-8 receptor (IL8R) stimulates phospholipase Cβ2 (PLC-β2) via Gi, resulting
  in production of IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 binds to the receptor releasing Ca2+
  from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. IP3-mediated increase of intracellular
  Ca2+ levels results in elevation of cGMP levels via guanylyl cyclase (GC), thus
  activating protein kinase G (PKG) (). Phosphorylated nonmuscle myosin IIA (MHCIIA)
  by protein kinase G is recruited in the CD38-Lck complex, inducing the internalization
  of CD38 and cADPR production (). The cADPR produced by CD38 in the endocytic vesicles
  is transported via the promiscuous nucleoside/cADPR transporters, as previously
  described (), or by the internalized CD38 itself, as previously proposed (). cADPR-mediated
  Ca2+ release induces NAADP production by Rap1 activation via cAMP/Epac/PKA, resulting
  in release of Ca2+ from lysosome-related acidic organelles. NAADP-mediated Ca2+
  release regulates the Ca2+ influx through TRPM2 channel in LAK cells, resulting
  in cell migration of LAK cells.
