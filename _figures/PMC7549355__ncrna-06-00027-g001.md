caption: Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and examples of long non-coding
  RNA (lncRNA) involvement. After transcription and translation under normoxic conditions
  hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1/2α is hydroxylated by proline hydroxylases (PHD)
  which subsequently enables binding of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein and results
  in VHL-mediated ubiquitination and degradation through the proteasome pathway. In
  hypoxia, PHDs are inhibited and HIF-1/2α accumulate and are activated by dimerization
  with the constitutively expressed HIF-1β leading to transcription of HIF target
  gene. lncRNAs are involved in HIF regulation in several ways. For instance, they
  may regulate HIF transcription and translation, act as microRNA sponges, directly
  bind to PHDs and VHL or facilitate binding between HIF and transcriptional cofactors.
