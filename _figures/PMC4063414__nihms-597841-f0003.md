caption: Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) controls the levels of allosteric regulators
  3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate. Low PGAM1 activity causes a buildup 3-phosphoglcyerate
  (3-PG) which slows pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux inhibits 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase (PGD). High PGAM1 activity causes an increase in the levels of 2-phosphoglycerate
  (2-PG), which allosterically activates PHGDH, the first enzyme in serine/glycine
  synthesis. Inhibiting PGAM1 increases 3-PG and decreases 2-PG, decreasing flux through
  both the serine/glycine pathway and PPP.
