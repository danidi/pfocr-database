caption: A putative model of cooperation between PAR1 and PAFR in melanoma metastasis.
  Constitutive PAR1 activation in melanoma cells causes PAFR expression, possibly
  through transcriptional activation, and PAF production, presumably through activation
  of PLA2. The PAF-PAFR signaling mediates PAR1-induced MUC18 expression via CREB
  phosphorylation. PAF can induce phosphorylation of CREB via activation of p38 MAPK
  and protein kinase A (PKA) (). The binding of CREB to the promoter of MUC18 is accompanied
  by CREB-dependent Sp1 recruitment, resulting in the activation of MUC18 expression.
  MUC18 induces the adhesion of melanoma cells to endothelial cells and cooperates
  with other possible downstream targets of the PAR1-PAFR pathway to induce endothelial
  wall disruption, the transendothelial migration of melanoma cells, and the accumulation
  of melanoma cells in the lung.
