number: Figure 1
caption: 'The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. PD-L2 (green) is expressed in antigen-presenting
  cells. PD-L1 (blue) is also expressed in tumor cells and in several immune cells
  (myeloid cells, TReg, endothelial cells). PD-L1 and PD-L2 inhibit T cells and NK
  cells (minus sign). IFNγ mediates the up-regulation of tumor PD-L1. Abbreviations:
  APC = antigen-presenting cell; MDSC = Myeloid-derived suppressor cell; NK cell =
  Natural Killer cell; TReg = Regulatory T cell; CAF = Cancer associated Fibroblast;
  Endoth cell = Endothelial cell; PD-1 = Programmed cell death-1; PD-L1/2 = Programmed
  cell death 1 ligand 1/2; TCR = T Cell Receptor; MHC = Major Histocompatibility Complex.'
