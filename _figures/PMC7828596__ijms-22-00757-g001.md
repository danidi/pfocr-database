caption: The canonical aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. AhR ligands from different
  sources can cross the plasma membrane and bind to AhR. This allows the translocation
  of the ligand–receptor complex to the nucleus. In the nucleus, AhR heterodimerizes
  with its partner ARNT (AhR Nuclear Translocator, also called HIF-1β). The heterodimer
  binds specific DNA regions located in the promoter of target genes, named dioxin
  response elements (DRE). AhR-ARNT induces the transcription of target genes, including
  members of the Cyp1a and Cyp1b families, by the recruitment of various coactivators,
  such as CBP/p300 (cAMP response element-binding protein) and SRC-1 (steroid receptor
  coactivator 1). AhRR further suppresses AhR transcriptional activity. Then, after
  being exported out of the nucleus, AhR is rapidly degraded in the cytoplasmic compartment
  by the proteasome.
