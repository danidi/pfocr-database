caption: In normal mitochondria, the pace of electron (e−) flow through the respiratory
  chain complexes (I–IV) is finely regulated by the activity of complex IV (COX),
  which in turn is modulated by phosphorylation of its subunits (P, COX phospho-residues)
  by mitochondrial PKA. This regulation responds to the CO2 produced by the Krebs
  cycle through mitochondrial sAC. Electron flow is linked to ROS production (e.g.
  superoxide, O2.) and ATP synthesis, which in turn may affect the cellular AMP/ATP
  ratio. These, and other putative factors (indicated by ?), have signalling functions
  on the regulation of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as
  PGC1α and NRF1. In COX deficient mitochondria with decreased electron flow, Krebs
  cycle activity is dampened and CO2 production reduced, resulting in hypophosphorylation
  of COX, increased ROS production and increased signalling for compensatory mitochondrial
  biogenesis through the PGC1α–NRF1 axis. Over-expression of mt-sAC in COX deficient
  cells increases COX phosphorylation by the sAC–cAMP–PKA pathway, thereby increasing
  electron flow and normalizing the signalling for OXPHOS biogenesis.
