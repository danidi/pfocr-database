caption: 'The pathway is regulated by a feed-forward manner by oxysterols. Cholesterol
  transport into mitochondria, where CYP27A1 generates oxysterols, is mediated by
  StarD1 which is induced by the LXR activation. The intercellular oxysterol levels
  are also controlled by CYP7B1. Insulin signaling pathway is primarily involved in
  the regulation of CYP7B1. Insulin resistance significantly suppressed CYP7B1 expression.
  In brain, GH-Stat5 signaling may activate TGR5 to up-regulate expression of CYP7B1.
  The cold exposure significantly increases Cyp7b1 mRNA and protein expression in
  mice. In the intestine, conjugated bile acid can be deconjugated by BSH. CDCA (TCDCA)
  is further bio-transformed (7α-dehydroxylated) to secondary LCA (TLCA). In the cold-mediated
  Cyp7b1 induction, increased fecal taurine excretion was also observed. Taurine can
  provide pathobionts in the gut with its’ terminal electron acceptor (SO3 group),
  allowing for growth and expansion of deltaproteobacteria, Biophila wadsworthia in
  the gut. In BAT, secondary bile acids activate TGR5 to increase thermogenesis. In
  the intestinal L cells, secondary bile acids also activate TGR5 to increase cAMP
  and stimulate GLP-1 secretion. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion from β cells to
  improve insulin sensitivity which in turn enhance the Cyp7b1 induction. In NASH
  fibrosis, increased CYP7B1 expression has been reported,– suggesting that this mechanism
  is working for protecting against hepatotoxicity. Although Cyp7b1 is not a direct
  FXR target gene, induction of FXR-MAFG pathway may account for the repression of
  Cyp7b1 expression indirectly. Abbreviations: BAT, brown adipose tissue; BSH, bile
  salt hydrolase; CYP27A1, sterol 27-hydroxylase; CYP7B1, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase;
