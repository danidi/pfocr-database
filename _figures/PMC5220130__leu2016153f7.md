caption: Schematic representation of the BCR signaling pathway demonstrating the ibrutinib
  sensitivity of BTK C481 variants and their impact on downstream signaling. Stimulation
  of the BCR induces phosphorylation of BTK tyrosine 551 through SFKs, and of tyrosine
  223 via autophosphorylation. Activated BTK also phosphorylates its downstream substrate,
  PLCγ2, which in turn promotes the production of the signaling mediators that ultimately
  promote survival, proliferation and homing. Phosphorylations are denoted with an
  encircled P; those with white background depict phosphorylations independent of
  BTK catalysis, whereas those with yellow background mark those induced by BTK. BTK
  C481 variants show differential catalytic activity. When C481 is substituted by
  R, F, W or Y the resulting proteins become catalytically inactive, as demonstrated
  by severely compromised phosphorylation of both Y551 and Y223. C481S and T variants
  are substantially phosphorylated at both tyrosines, and they potently phosphorylate
  PLCγ2. The effect of ibrutinib is depicted according to the inhibitory concentration
  required (0.5 μM and ⩾4 μm) for an effect on BTK pY223 and with the activity on
  PLCγ2 pY753 being considered similar. Overall, 0.4 μm is the concentration detected
  in patients, whereas the catalytic activity of C481S and T is only inhibited by
  ⩾4 μm of ibrutinib. The G variant is weakly phosphorylated at Y223 and Y551, and
  barely phosphorylates PLCγ2. The effect of ibrutinib on C481G was not analyzed,
  as its catalytic activity was considered insufficient.
