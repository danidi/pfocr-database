caption: 'The Trx1/p21Ras-ERK1/2 MAP kinases/PEA-15/Txnip compartmentalized signaling
  pathway is stimulated by nitrosative/oxidative stress and is associated with tumor
  development. (A) The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling axis is activated under nitrosative
  oxidative stress. Under these conditions expression of Akt is up regulated and expression
  of Txnip is down-regulated. Trx1 and the ERK1/2 MAP kinases migrate to the nuclear
  compartment. (B) Nuclear translocation of Trx1 and the ERK1/2 MAP kinases is prevented
  in three situations: (1) Cells pre-incubated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059; (2)
  Cells over-expressing the cytoplasmic anchor of ERK1/2 MAP kinases – PEA-15; (3)
  Cells over-expressing Txnip.'
