caption: 'We have previously elucidated a positive feedback loop for the biosynthesis
  and action of TxA2, i.e. the COX-2/TxA2 pathway (Ref.). Briefly, in the inflammatory
  microenvironment of RA joints, lymphocytes and inflammatory cells like macrophages
  and neutrophils are recruited and produce many pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
  as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 etc. By stimulation with these cytokines, the crucial
  molecules of COX-2 pathway, such as PGE2 and TxA2, were produced by those inflammatory
  cells and RA FLS. Through autocrine or paracrine signaling, TxA2 is able to specifically
  bind with its signature receptor TP, thereby activating several intracellular signals,
  MAPKs and PI3K/PKB pathways for instance. The transcription factor CREB and NF-κB
  can be subsequently activated, and thus inducing the expression of COX-2, TxAS,
  ACTN1, VEGF and other inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, a positive auto-regulatory
  feedback loop for the synthesis and action of TxA2 in inflammatory sites is formed
  and contributes to synovitis, a key role in pathogenesis of RA. It is thus suggested
  that the pharmacological approaches targeting COX-2/TxA2 pathway hold the potential
  as a novel add-on therapy in the treatments of RA. Both NSAIDs (including COXIBs)
  and DMARDs are typically prescribed medications for treatments of patients with
  RA. TxA2 is believed to be the non-target of NSAIDs and DMARDs. Importantly, the
  limitations and adverse effects of those drugs may be, at least in part, due to
  lack of the effects on the COX-2/TxA2 pathway. GL and GA are the major active components
  of licorice. Following oral administration in humans, GL is metabolized into GA
  in the gastrointestinal tract and GA can be totally absorbed. Fortunately, GL and
  GA have been reported to target the COX-2/TxA2 pathway. Therefore, GL or GA could
  be used as an adjunctive agent in RA treatments not only to enhance the therapeutic
  effects of NSAIDs/DMARDs but also to reduce the adverse effects associated with
  NSAIDs/DMARDs. Abbreviations: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; RA FLS,
  rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes; COX, cyclooxygenase; TxA2, thromboxane
  A2; TP, thromboxane A2 receptor; PGH2, prostaglandin H2; PGE2, prostaglandin E2;
