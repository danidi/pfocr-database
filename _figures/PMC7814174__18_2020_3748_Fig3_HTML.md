caption: GDF15 and FGF21 as mitokines in the diurnal regulation of energy balance.
  Mitochondrial dysfunction induces GDF15 and FGF21 that act as endocrine mediators
  of mitohormesis by affecting central appetite regulation and energy balance. There
  is evidence that FGF21 acts directly in the brain and modulates SCN output, although
  the exact neuronal targets and pathway are not yet known. Central actions of FGF21
  include behavioral changes such as an altered food preference as well as effects
  on thermogenesis and energy expenditure possibly through an increased SNS output
  and activation of the HPT axis. FGF21 also has direct effects on BAT, WAT, liver
  and heart. For GDF15 effects on energy and substrate metabolism are thought to be
  mainly centrally regulated, possibly also by increasing SNS output. GFRAL, the only
  known specific GDF15 receptor was only identified in neurons of the AP and NTS region
  in the hindbrain. Supraphysiological levels of GDF15 induce anorexia, probably induced
  by a visceral malaise state leading to food aversion. Direct peripheral effects
  of GDF15 are also discussed but still controversial. In mice, circulating levels
  of FGF21 and GDF15 as mitokines both show similar diurnal fluctuations with increased
  levels in the resting phase (daytime) resulting in a GDF15 driven, daytime restricted
  anorexia. BAT brown adipose tissue, GFRAL glial-derived neurotrophic factor receptor
  alpha-like, HPT hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis, ISR integrated stress response,
  SNS sympathetic nervous system, WAT white adipose tissue, for other abbreviations
