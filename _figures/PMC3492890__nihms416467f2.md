caption: Glucose enters glycolysis (orange panel) and is metabolized to lactate. The
  expression and activity of glycolytic regulating enzymes are controlled by mTOR
  and PI3K signaling pathways (crosstalk). Reprogramming factors c-MYC and LIN28 promote
  glucose metabolism and c-MYC also suppresses respiration (crosstalk). Alternatively,
  pyruvate can be converted into two molecules of acetyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle.
  Acetyl-CoA can traffic to the nucleus as a substrate for acetyltransferase enzymes
  (crosstalk). TCA cycle intermediates can be siphoned into amino acid or lipid biosynthesis
  pathways, or can participate in the control of gene expression. For example, α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) is a cofactor for Jumonji-domain containing histone demethylases (crosstalk).
  Methionine adenosyltransferase, an enzyme in amino acid biosynthesis, also converts
  methionine and ATP into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for DNA methyltransferases and
  other transmethylation reactions (crosstalk). The NAD+/NADH ratio reflects cellular
  redox state and regulates deacetylase enzymes, such as the Sirtuins (crosstalk).
  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are required for lineage-specific differentiation
  and are regulated by the p38 MAPK stress signaling pathway (crosstalk). Lipid biosynthesis
  supports membrane formation but also provides signaling molecules including arachidonic
  acid (AA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) (crosstalk). Altogether, metabolites, the
  redox environment, and metabolism-regulated signaling cascades communicate with
  the nucleus (grey panel) to directly impact chromatin structure and gene expression
  programs that may control PSC self-renewal, differentiation, and reprogramming.
  (Blue buttons indicate nucleus and signaling control of metabolic pathways; orange
  buttons indicate metabolic pathways that influence gene expression changes within
  the nucleus.)
