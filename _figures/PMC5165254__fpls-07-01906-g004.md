caption: Major flowering pathway genes of maize (Zea mays). Positive and negative
  regulatory connections are indicated by arrows and lines with T-ends, respectively.
  White, black, and gray arrows or T-ends indicate regulatory connections occurring
  primarily under long days, short days, or independently of day length, respectively.
  Gene name abbreviations are explained in Supplementary Table .
