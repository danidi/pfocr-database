caption: Colored nodes represent differentially regulated genes () while genes in
  uncolored nodes were not identified as differentially expressed and were integrated
  into the computationally generated network indicating a relevance to it (). T-cell
  receptor signalling gene relationships were overlaid to the network. Solid interconnecting
  lines represent genes directly connected and dotted lines signify the indirect connection
  between genes and cellular functions. Top functions of the genes were related to
  T-cell receptor signalling, immune response and cellular assembly and death, identified
  around the MALT1 gene (in red). Node shapes represent different biological molecules.
