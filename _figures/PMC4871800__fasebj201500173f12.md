caption: Schematic of proposed model of CCN1 and TGF-β1 interactions in profibrotic
  signaling. Our studies indicate that endogenous CCN1 is required for constitutive
  and TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 activation and profibrogenic gene expression. TGF-β1 induces
  CCN1 expression via a SMAD3-dependent pathway, supporting a positive feedback loop.
  Abrogation of CCN1 during the active fibrogenic phase of lung injury repair protects
  from fibrosis in an in vivo model of lung fibrosis. The precise mechanism by which
  CCN1 cooperates with TGF-β receptors and/or integrins to activate SMAD3 requires
  further investigation.
