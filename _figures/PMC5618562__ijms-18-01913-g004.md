caption: Interplay between melatonin signaling, cell contact-cell polarity complexes,
  mechanotransduction, and YAP/TAZ. Melatonin signaling inhibits RhoA/ROCK and increases
  the expression of cell surface adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin. This suggests
  that it may inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear function, which in turn is promoted by RhoA/ROCK
  and inhibited by cell adhesion molecules. P120 catenin has been co-purified with
  MT1/MT2 receptors. When localized at the plasma membrane, it stabilizes E-cadherin
  at the adherens junction (AJ) while inhibiting RhoA–ROCK, thus inhibiting nuclear
  YAP/TAZ (Y/T). MT1/2 also co-purified with MUPP1 scaffold protein, which interacts
  with ZO-1 at tight junctions (TJ). Moreover, several studies showed that ZO-1 binds
  Gα proteins. This suggests a possible interaction with TAZ, which has been demonstrated
  to be sequestered at the plasma membrane through its interaction with ZO-1 at tight
  junctions. Moreover, YAP/TAZ may be sequestered at the plasma membrane by the 14-3-3
  protein, which has been co-purified with MT1 and MT2. MT1/2 have also been co-purified
  with filaminA, involved in mechanotransdution, suggesting a link between melatonin
  receptor signaling and mechanotransduction, which has been demonstrated to regulate
  YAP/TAZ function and to be in turn controlled by YAP/TAZ. Finally, YAP has been
  co-purified with NOS1AP (nitric oxide synthase1 adaptor protein) in the complex
  formed with the scribble polarity proteins in proximity to cell–cell contacts. As
  NOS (nitric oxid syntase) has been co-purified with MT1/MT2, this again may suggest
  a possible indirect interaction of YAP with MT1/MT2 at the plasma membrane. In general,
  YAP/TAZ sequestration at the plasma membrane prevents their nuclear pro-proliferative
  function. Arrows indicate activation, while dashed and blunt lines indicate inhibition.
