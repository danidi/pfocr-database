caption: Regulation of miRNA expression in response to maternal disease and stress.
  HSP60, SRF, HDAC4 and CCND2 have been associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy,
  apoptosis and regulation of cardiomyocyte endowment [] and are targets of miR-1
  and miR-133a in the heart, that are dysregulated by maternal hypertension [,]. miR-629a
  regulates TRIM33 expression that in turn regulates the TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway
  which has been associated with cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy and apoptosis []. miR-142
  mediates a number of target genes including IL-6 [], a potent myokine. The Fos/AP-1
  pathway is a key component of cardiac inflammation and is a predicted target of
  miR-146a []. Placenta produced miR-517a has been associated with low birth fetuses
  and targets PRKG1 which has been associated with thoracic aortic disease [,]. miR-24
  is a modulator of cell cycle, targeting E2F2 []. miR-29 targets TGFβ expression
  and has been associated with increased cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction
  []. miR-208 and miR-499 has been shown to regulate MYH7 a contractile subunit in
  the heart, and is associated with heart failure [,]. miR-16 targets ADRA1A and is
  associated with hypertensive heart disease []. GATA4 expression has been shown regulate
  miR-144 expression and modulate the response to ischemia/reperfusion cardiomyocyte
