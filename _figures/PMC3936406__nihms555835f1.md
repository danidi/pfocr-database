caption: Potential molecular signaling pathways mediated by MET receptor tyrosine
  kinase in neurons. The activation of the MET signaling pathway is initiated by hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) binding, which induces MET dimerization and transphosphorylation
  of two critical tyrosine residues (Tyr1234 and Tyr1235) in the tyrosine kinase domain
  to activate the intrinsic kinase activity of MET. The ensuing phosphorylation of
  two additional tyrosine residuals (Tyr1349 and Tyr1356) in the multisubstrate docking
  sites recruits downstream adaptor proteins including Grb2, Gab1, and SHC to activate
  cascades of downstream pathways that involve major signal transducers such as PLCγ,
  AKT, MAPK/Erk1/2, STAT3, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and Rho family of small GTPases
  (Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42). Note that PI3 kinase can be directly activated by binding
  either to the multisubstrate docking site or downstream to Gab1 activation. Although
  most of these signaling events are established in nonneuronal cells, it is possible
  that these molecular pathways cooperate in developing neurons to mediate the outcome
  of neuronal survival, morphogenesis and proliferation, projection and motility,
  and activity-dependent gene transcription. Indeed, there has been some experimental
  evidence that MET signaling in neurons activates PI3K–AKT pathway and MAP kinase
  pathway (indicated by shaded boxes). MET has been shown to directly interact with
  other membrane-bound proteins in neurons, such as AXL, CD44, and plexins (which
  bind to semaphorins). The extent to which these membrane protein interactions and
  the intracellular signaling pathways in mediating the functional developmental outcomes
  in neurons has yet to be ascertained.
