caption: Putative regulatory pattern of PoSet1 and PoSet2 on cellulolytic enzyme gene
  expression. PoSet1 is the sole histone methyltransferase responsible for H3K4me1
  and H3K4me2 in P. oxalicum. PoSet1 was preferentially located in the core promoter
  of target genes via the interactions with other COMPASS subunits (i.e., Swd1, Swd2,
  Swd3, Bre2, Sdc1, Spp1, and Sgh1), Pol II and general transcription factors, such
  as TFIID. The methylation of H3K4 is an active marker for the transcription initiation
  of cellulolytic enzyme genes. PoSet2 is a H3K36 methyltransferase that coordinates
  transcriptional elongation at the coding regions. The methylation of H3K36 is a
  repression marker of the transcription of cellulolytic enzyme genes. The repressive
  Rpd3S complex was recruited by methylated H3K36 and promoting histone tail deacetylation
  []. PoSet2 antagonized the PoSet1–H3K4me3 pathway by negatively regulating the expression
  of COMPASS subunits. The balance of H3K36 and H3K4 methylation is required for the
  normal transcription of cellulolytic enzyme genes
