caption: 'The lipid regulatory pathway based on the nutritional sensing mechanisms.
  The original pathway, published by Watts in 2009 , was expanded to include the findings
  uncovered by this study (shown in green). Note that only the Δ9 desaturase fat-5
  (not fat-6 or fat-7) was investigated. Abbreviations: TGF-β, transforming growth
  factor-β; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-Binding protein; NHR, nuclear hormone
  receptor.'
