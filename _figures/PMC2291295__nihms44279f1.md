caption: The extrinsic pathway is stimulated by UVB or binding of Fas ligand, tumor
  necrosis factor, or other cytokines to death receptors that results in activation
  of caspase-8. The intrinsic pathway is also stimulated by UVB, as well as various
  cytotoxic drugs, and is linked to DNA damage responses. It involves mitochondrial
  depolarization and release of multiple proapoptotic factors. In addition, UVB results
  in formation of DNA photo-products and initiation of DNA damage responses. Mitochondrial
  content release may directly result from these stimuli or may occur indirectly as
  part of the DNA damage response. Cytochrome c promotes activation of caspase-9,
  Smac inhibits inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) caspase inhibitors, and apoptosis-inducing
  factor (AIF) translocates to the nucleus and mediates caspase-independent apoptosis.
  The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are potentially linked by Bid, which is cleaved
  by caspase-8, and the activated fragment (tBid) causes mitochondrial content release.
  Activation of upstream caspases (caspase-8 or -9) leads to activation of downstream
  caspases (caspase-3 or -7), resulting in cleavage of intracellular substrates, cellular
  condensation, and nuclear fragmentation. Apoptotic inhibitors include caspase inhibitors
  (FLIP, IAP proteins) and the Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL that prevent
  mitochondrial membrane permeability.
