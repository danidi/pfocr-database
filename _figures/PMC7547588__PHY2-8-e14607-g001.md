caption: 'Overview of possible mechanisms leading to insulin resistance. Impaired
  mitochondrial functioning is a suggested mechanism through which insulin resistance
  develops. Several factors have been implicated in the development of mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Some of the most reported factors include: (a) an increased production
  of reactive oxidative species (ROS). ROSs are necessary by‐products of mitochondrial
  energy metabolism; however, if their production is not adequately coupled by intracellular
  antioxidants, then oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can occur. (b)
  Impaired glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation may result from metabolic inflexibility,
  which is commonly described as an inability to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability.
  Ultimately, these events may lead to both the development of ROS and ectopic lipid
  accumulation, resulting in mitochondrial damage and removal through mitophagy pathways.
  Further investigation on the genes involved in mitophagy (i.e., Bnip3, Nix, Fundc1)
  may allow the discovery of pathways that explain the correlation between mitochondrial
  dysfunction and insulin resistance in adipose, hepatic, and skeletal muscle tissue.
  (c) Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress is also involved in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity can induce ER stress, which may trigger
  an adaptive signaling pathway, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). If
  ER stress fails to be relieved by this UPR, then this can lead to the provocation
  of both mitochondrial dependent and independent cell death pathways. Together, the
  ability of the mitochondria to respond to metabolic disruptions is essential for
  healthy cellular bioenergetics, and interference with this process may prompt unregulated
  mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, thus contributing to insulin resistance.
