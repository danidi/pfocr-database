caption: Functional networks of differentially methylated genes in mucinous type epithelial
  ovarian cancer (MuOC). (a) Genetic interactions network of MuOC pathogenesis. The
  functional network constructed by the gene coexpression between the differential
  methylated genes (DMGs) and interactors. (b) The first subnetwork included a low
  DMGs (nuclear receptor coactivator 2, NCoA‐2) and its' interactors, which related
  to the thyroid hormone signaling pathway. (c) The second and largest subnetwork
  comprised the predominant proteasome subunit beta (PSMB)‐type family module, including
  PSMB 8, PSMB 2, PSMB 9 and PSMB 10. The proteasome module and interactors were related
  to both antigen presentation of exogenous antigen via major histocompatibility complex
  (MHC) class I and to the noncanonical nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer
  of activated B cells (NIK/NF‐κB) signaling pathway. (d) The third subnetwork included
  three DMGs (CACYBP, HIST1H4I and LMO3) and their interactors were related to histone
  H2A acetylation, positive regulation of chromosome and spliceosome complex assembly.
  The r value was calculated as a Pearson correlation coefficient of the transcriptomics
  data (GSE6008) with p < 0.05.
