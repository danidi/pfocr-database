caption: The NAD+ salvage pathway and its control by the circadian clock. The biosynthesis
  of NAD+ follows a circadian pattern, which is caused by the circadian expression
  of NAMPT, a rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+biosynthetic salvage pathway. The Nampt
  gene contains E-boxes in its promoter, leading to direct transcriptional control
  by the dimer CLOCK:BMAL1. The fluctuating levels of NAD+ modulate the activity of
  SIRT1 which in turn regulates the transcriptional activity of CLOCK:BMAL1 on their
  targets genes. During the aging the levels of NAD+ decreases and might alter the
  circadian rhythms of clock-controlled genes (CCGs)
