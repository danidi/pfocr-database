caption: Progression of amyloidogenesis in parahippocampal region and hippocampal
  formation of mediotemporal lobe. The energy-demanding regions of the brain, most
  notably the entorhinal cortex (EC) of the parahippocampal region, resort to aerobic
  glycolysis as an alternate means of generating ATP. As a result, the NAD+ pool is
  reduced and the NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 becomes hypoactive. As Sirt1 has
  been recently demonstrated to increase α-secretase production (through RARβ deacetylation
  and subsequent ADAM10 transcription), the amyloidogenic phenotype becomes upregulated.
  That is, the reduced processing of AβPP through α-secretase (due to the reduction
  in α-secretase synthesis) is complemented by an increase in AβPP processing by β-
  and γ-secretases to yield Aβ peptides. An eventual accumulation Aβ into senile plaques
  occurs along the network of innervation as the degeneration spreads cortico-cortically.*DG
