caption: An increase in serotonin bioavailability (due to food intake or pharmacological
  compounds such as sibutramine and fenfluramine) or direct agonism of 5HT2CRs and
  5HT1BRs modulates firing of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)/cocaine and amphetamine
  regulated transcript (CART) and agouti related protein (AgRP)/neuropeptide Y (NPY)
  neurones within the arcuate nucleus of the of the hypothalamus (ARC). Anorectic
  POMC neurones expressing 5HT2CR depolarize on receptor activation and release α-melanocyte-stimulating
  hormone (α-MSH), which in turn activates second-order melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)
  expressing neurones, principally within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
  (PVH; ). Concomitant activation of 5HT1BRs expressed on orexigenic AgRP/NPY neurones
  within the ARC causes membrane hyperpolarization and subsequent inhibition of neuropeptide
  release. Inhibitory 5HT1BR activation also attenuates inhibitory postsynaptic currents
  onto POMC/CART neurones further potentiating anorexigenesis. Subsequent downstream
  neuroendocrine signalling promotes satiety and the cessation of food intake.
