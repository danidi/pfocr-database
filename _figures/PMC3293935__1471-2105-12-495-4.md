number: Figure 4
caption: Known apoptotic targets of P53. Known apoptotic genes from the KEGG pathway
  database and the literature for P53. Genes in light green are annotated in KEGG.
  Orange dots indicate direct targets recovered by MotifMap. DDIT4 and PHLDA3 are
  examples of additional direct targets identified by MotifMap with FDR < 0.05 which
  have been reported in the literature but are not present in KEGG.
