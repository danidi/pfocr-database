caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis
  of Crohn’s disease. Damage to the mucosa allows penetration of gut contents including
  bacteria (brown ovals) into the bowel wall. The outcome depends upon the subsequent
  inflammatory response. A vigorous response leads to the secretion of high levels
  of IL-8 and TNF-α attracting large numbers of neutrophils, which phagocytose and
  digest the bacteria and foreign material. A weak inflammatory response predisposes
  to Crohn’s lesions because the foreign material is taken up by macrophages to form
  granulomata and foci of chronic inflammation. A naturally weak response can be boosted
  in the small bowel by MDP signaling through the CARD15 pathway of macrophages to
  induce them to produce IL-8. In the large bowel a similar role might be performed
  by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). The predisposition to Crohn’s disease is greatly
  increased by a combination of a low innate inflammatory response coupled to failure
  of one of the compensatory mechanisms
