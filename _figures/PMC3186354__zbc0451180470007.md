caption: Schematic representation of the proposed pathways used by Vpr to promote
  neuronal degeneration. Vpr could disturb calcium balance by affecting L- or P/Q-type
  calcium channels through a signaling pathway, yet to be identified that could lead
  to miRNAs deregulation and eventually neuronal dysfunction. Vpr can also be taken
  up by neurons and can affect miRNAs level directly which leads to neuronal dysfunction.
  Our results point to the ability to induce both pathways.
