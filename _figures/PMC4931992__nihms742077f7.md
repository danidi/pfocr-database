caption: Model of regulatory loop between Shh, IRS1, YAP, and YB1. Shh pathway leads
  to YB-1 upregulation. YB-1 controls IGF2 expression. IGF2 activates IRS1, which
  is stabilized by Shh, and in turn stabilizes YAP (, ). YAP regulates IGF2 expression
  downstream of Shh and could be an upstream regulator of YB-1.

papertitle: YB-1 is elevated in medulloblastoma and drives proliferation in Sonic
  hedgehog - dependent cerebellar granule neuron progenitor cells and medulloblastoma
  cells.
