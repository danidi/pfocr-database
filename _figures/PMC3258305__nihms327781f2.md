caption: Most cells acquire iron by transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated endocytosis
  of diferric transferrin (Tf) followed by the internalization of Tf-TfR complexes,
  eventuating in an acidified compartment whose pH promotes the release of iron from
  Tf. The iron is reduced by Steap3 and then released from Tf and then endosome through
  DMT1. The immediate fate of this released iron is unknown up to the point where
  it is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by Mfrn1 or Mfrn2. In
  mitochondria, iron is assembled into heme and iron sulfur clusters (Fe/S). Some
  of the heme is exported though an unknown mechanism for use by ER, peroxisomal,
  cytosolic, or nuclear hemoproteins. A not yet characterized intermediate (or possibly
  Fe/S cluster product) of the Fe/S biogenesis pathway (X) is exported through ABCB7
  for the formation of extramitochondrial Fe/S cluster proteins. Iron outside of any
  subcellular compartment is comprised by the labile iron pool (“LIP”). Excess iron
  is stored in the ubiquitous iron storage protein, ferritin. Some cells may also
  export iron, also presumably from the LIP, by ferroportin (FPN).
