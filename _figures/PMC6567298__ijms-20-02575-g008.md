caption: Possible reactions of dopamine quinone (DAQ) and DAC with proteins, BSA (2
  eq. containing 0.6 eq. of thiol) and βLG (2 eq. containing 1.2 eq. of thiol). DAQ
  reacts with thiol proteins to form Catechol-protein (Pathway 1), which are oxidized
  to Melanochrome-1. Some portions of DAQ escape from reaction with proteins and are
  converted to DAC (Pathway 2). DAC is able to react with thiol proteins to form melanochrome-2.
  Melanochrome-1 and -2 are isomers differing in the position of conjugation with
  proteins. Some portions of DAC escape from reaction with proteins and are converted
  to DHI-melanin (Pathway 3).
