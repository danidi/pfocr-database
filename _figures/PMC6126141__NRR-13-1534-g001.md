caption: Implications of histone methylation in Schwann cells upon peripheral nerve
  injury and development.(A) The Schwann cell enhancer (SCE) element of the Pou3f1
  gene (also referred to as Oct6) and the myelinating Schwann cell element (MSE) of
  Egr2 (better known as Krox20) is tri-methylated at lysine (K) 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3)
  in adult Schwann cells. (A’) One day post nerve lesion (dpl) histone demethylase
  complex 2 (HDAC2) recruits the transcription factor Sox10 and the histone demethylases
  (HDM) Kdm3a and Kdm4c to the Pou3f1 SCE element, resulting in H3K9me3 demethylation,
  enhancer activation and increased Pou3f1 expression. The same complex also activates
  Egr2 expression via the MSE enhancer 12 dpl. (B) H3K37me3 silences promoter regions
  of the p19Arf gene in adult Schwann cells (B’). Following nerve injury or oncogenic
  challenges, H3K27me3 is removed by the HDM Kdm6b, leading to increased p19Arf gene
  expression and activation of Schwann cell senescence via the ARF and Rb pathway,
  thereby preventing uncontrolled Schwann cell proliferation. (C) Similarly, H3K27-tri-methylation
  in promoter and gene regions blocks transcription in adult Schwann cells of many
  genes, which are exclusively expressed in repair Schwann cells or upon Schwann cell
  development (e.g., Shh or Gdnf). The di- and tri-methyaltion of H3K27 is mediated
  by the multi-subunit histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex Prc2, consisting of
  RbAP48, Suz12, Ezh2 and Eed subunits. Simultaneously, many promoters display activating
  H3K4me3 histone marks. H3K4me3 might be restricted to promoter regions by the HDM
  Rbp2, which is able to interact with Prc2. (C’) In injured nerves H3K27-tri-methylation
  is lost in injury-associated gene promoters and the H3K4me3 expands. A comparable
  situation can be introduced via experimental gene knock out of the Eed subunit of
  the Prc2 HMT complex (dashed box). (D) In many G2/M-cell-cycle associated genes
  H3K36-di-methylation increases throughout the gene body towards the 3’-end. The
  same distribution is reported for H3K36me3 in different cell types. Here, H3K36me3
  recruits HDACs, which convey a repressive, closed chromatin state, to prevent spurious
  initiation of transcription from cryptic promoters. (D’) In Miz1ΔPOZ mice increased
  expression of the HDM Kdm8 results in demethylation of H3K36me2 and elevated expression
  of G2/M-associated genes. During postnatal development of control Schwann cells
  Kdm8 is progressively repressed (probably through Miz1), indicating that H3K36-di-methylation
  contributes to the silencing of G2/M-genes and the exit of Schwann cells from the
  cell cycle, possibly through the recruitment of Hdacs.
