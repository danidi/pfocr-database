caption: The molecular components of the protein degradation pathways of Paxillus
  involutus. Organic nitrogen (N) in soil solution is degraded by the combined action
  of endo- (polyporopepsin, CnAP1, A01 unassigned peptidases, fungalysin, scytalidoilsin
  and grifolisin) and exo-peptidases (aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases) into peptides,
  amino acids and ammonium (see text for details). Peptides and oligopeptides assimilation
  is facilitated by Peptide transporter family (PTR) and Oligopeptide transporter
  family (OPT), amino acids are transported by Yeast amino acid transporter (YAT)
  and L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) while ammonium is internalized using Amt
  transporters. Intracellular peptidases further degrade oligopeptides and peptides
  while amino acids and ammonium are incorporated into the amino acid metabolic pathway.
  Intercellular transfer of urea and polyamine are facilitated by DHA1 (Drug:H+ antiporter)
  and PiDur3 (P. involutus degradation of urea transporter). Vacuolar peptidases are
  active on proteins transported through amino acid/choline transporter (ACT) and
  amino acid/auxin porter (AAAP).
