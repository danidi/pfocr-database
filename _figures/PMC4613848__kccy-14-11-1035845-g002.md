caption: RASSF1A regulation of the Hippo pathway in response to DNA damage. Double
  strand breaks leading to ATM activation or stalled replication forks that trigger
  ATR activity result in phosphorylation of RASSF1A at S131. Phosphorylated RASSF1A
  forms dimers that bind to MST2 abrogating inhibitory interaction with RAF1. Activated
  MST2 binds and phosphorylates LATS1 offering the necessary conformational change
  for CDK2 interaction that lead to decreased pBRCA2-S3291. LATS1 phosphorylation
  also stimulates its kinase activity toward YAP1 leading to decreased association
  with the TEAD transcription factors that promote cell growth and increased association
  with p73 inducing apoptosis, potentially in synergy with c-ABL tyrosine kinase.
