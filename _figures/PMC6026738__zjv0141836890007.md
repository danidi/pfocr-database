caption: Hypothesis model. After HSV-1 infection, CXCR5 is upregulated and CCR7 is
  downregulated soon after priming of naive CD4+ T cells by viral antigens. CD4+ CXCR5+
  PD-1hi Tfh-like cells will move to the border of T and B cell zone along CXCL13
  recruitment gradients. CXCL13 is secreted by follicular dendritic cells; this is
  regulated by LT-expressing B cells via the LT-LTβR pathway (). After entering the
  follicle, Tfh-like cells further differentiate into mature Tfh cells, thus facilitating
  follicular B cells for the GC response, including class switching and somatic hypermutation,
  to generate high-affinity antibodies (). When staying around the T-B border, Tfh-like
  cells have high plasticity and may gain Th1 features due to the upregulation of
  IFN-γ from Th1 or Th1-like cells. LT is highly expressed on Th1 cells. By interaction
  with LTβR-expressing cells, LT derived from T cells will limit the release of IFN-γ
  and sustain Tfh-like cells for their further migration and differentiation, thus
  leading to a balanced helper T cell response. Upregulation of IFN-γ by the LTβR-Ig
  blockade impairs the sustainability of Tfh-like cells, thus leading to an impaired
  humoral immune response.
