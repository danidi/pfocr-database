caption: 'Both signal 1 and signal 2 are required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires at least two signals: signal 1, also
  known as the priming signal, is mediated by microbial ligands recognized by TLRs
  or cytokines such as TNF-α. Signal 1 activates the NF-κB pathway, leading to upregulation
  of pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 protein levels. The signal 2 is mediated by numerous PAMP
  or DAMP stimulation, and promotes the assembly of ASC and pro-caspase-1, leading
  to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. Under noninfectious conditions,
  extracellular ATP and K+ efflux leads to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via
  the P2X7 receptor and pannexin-1. Various endogenous and exogenous particulates,
  including MSU crystals, CPPD crystals, cholesterol crystals, amyloid β, silica crystals,
  asbestos, and alum, promote lysosomal damage and release cathepsin B into the cytosol,
  leading to the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Particulate matters (uric acid, silica,
  and alum) are also able to trigger inflammasome assembly through multiple purinergic
  receptor signaling. Additionally, calcium influx through TRPM2 activates NLRP3 inflammasome
  through mitochondrial ROS. Dissociated TXNIP, which is triggered by intracellular
  ROS, also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine
