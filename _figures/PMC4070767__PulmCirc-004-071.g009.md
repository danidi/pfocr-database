caption: 'Model for the effects of hydrocortisone on phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) in
  fetal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (FPASMCs) from lambs with persistent
  pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Exposure to hyperoxia leads to increased
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in increased nuclear factor
  κ B (NFκB) activity with subsequent induction of PDE5 activity. Hydrocortisone disrupts
  this pathway by increasing extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) expression,
  leading to attenuation of ROS signaling and normalization of PDE5 activity. IκB:
  NFκB inhibitory protein.'
