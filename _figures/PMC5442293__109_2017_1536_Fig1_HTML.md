caption: Role of WIP1 phosphatase in termination of DNA damage response. Exposed ssDNA
  caused by stalled replication forks or resected DSBs activates ATR/CHK1 pathway
  that targets CDC25 family of phosphatases, prevents activation of CDKs, and triggers
  cell cycle arrest. DSBs induced by ionizing radiation or chemotherapy activate ATM
  that orchestrates DNA repair by phosphorylating histone H2AX at chromatin and activates
  the cell cycle checkpoint. This is achieved by phosphorylation of p53 and Mdm2 that
  allows stabilization of p53 and triggers expression of CDKN1/p21. In addition, p53
  stimulates expression of its negative regulators Mdm2 and WIP1. After accumulating
  sufficient protein levels, WIP1 inactivates p53 pathway and dephosphorylates other
  targets jointly contributing to termination of the DDR (negatively and positively
  regulated WIP1 substrates shown in blue and yellow, respectively). Persistent genotoxic
  stress can continuously activate p53 leading to senescence. Very high activation
  of p53 pathway leads to expression of PUMA and NOXA and leads to cell death
