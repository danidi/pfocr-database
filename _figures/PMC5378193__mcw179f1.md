caption: Effect of  vs.  on plant resistance to pathogen infection. Growth on  nutrition
  leads to increased levels of NO, SA, PR gene expression, induction of the polyamine
  pathway, a decrease in apoplastic sugars and amino acids, and an overall increase
  in plant resistance in a concentration-dependent manner. Growth on  nutrition leads
  to increased levels of apoplastic sugars and amino acids, reduced levels of SA and
  PR gene expression, induction of GABA biosynthesis and reduced plant defence response.
