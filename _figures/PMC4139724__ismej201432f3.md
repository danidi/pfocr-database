caption: Functional features of gingivitis-associated microbiota. (a) Procrustes analysis
  of 16S rRNA gene sequences (PCA) against COGs. Each point represented a plaque microbiota
  and was colored according to the clinical status. The arrow end of each line connected
  to the 16S rRNA data for the sample, whereas the other end connected to the functional
  annotation. The fit of each Procrustes transformation over the first four dimensions
  was reported as the P-value by 10 000 Monte Carlo label permutations. (b) Functional
  distinctions between healthy and gingivitis microbiota. PCA showed that disease
  state significantly affected the microbial functional structure. The effects of
  disease state on the microbial functions appeared to be well separated by the first
  axis. (c) The 33 gingivitis-enriched orthologous groups that encode components of
  the flagellar biosynthesis pathway. The schematic was adapted from KEGG, with gene
  names of the corresponding KO (KEGG Ortholog) highlighted in red.
