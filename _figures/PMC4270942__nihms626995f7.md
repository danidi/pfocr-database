caption: 'Effects of E alone or in combination with IIH are presented in schematic
  diagrams of glycolytic (7.A), Krebs cycle (7.B), oxidative phosphorylation (7.C),
  and malonyl Co-A (7.D) pathways, where rate-limiting pathway enzymes investigated
  are depicted in dark grey boxes. E stimulates (+) PFKL and PDH expression in A2
  neurons, and moreover, allows further increase (++) of the former profile during
  IIH (Fig. 7.A); similarly, whole cDVC tissue exhibited up-regulated PDH subunit
  proteins in OVX+E, with or without IIH. These results support the notion that E
  may promote provision of glycolysis-derived acetyl Co-A for mitochondrial oxidation.
  As shown in Panel 7.B, Krebs cycle rate-limiting enzymes IDH2 and ODGH were enhanced
  in A2 neurons by E alone or E + IIH, respectively, while Complex II protein was
  stimulated under both conditions; collectively, these data imply estrogenic stimulation
  of cycle products. These findings are corroborated by evidence for Complex II subunit
  profile up-regulation in cDVC tissue. The respiratory chain (Fig. 7.C) utilizes
  electrons shuttled from the Krebs cycle by NADH and FADH2 to generate ATP. Our results
  show that A2 (ATP synthase subunit) and cDVC tissue (complexes II – IV) proteins
  were stimulated by E alone or in combination with IIH. The malonyl CoA pathway (Fig.
  7.D) functions in fatty acid synthesis. E inhibits (−) FAS and ACC enzyme profiles
  and inhibits or stimulates upstream kinase (CaMMKβ) and phosphatase proteins, respectively,
  that increase or decrease activity of the energy sensor AMPK, implying estrogen
  inhibition of fatty acid production and stabilization of cell energy balance under
  normo- and hypoglycemic conditions. Abbreviations: PFKL, phosphofrucktokinase; PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; IDH2, isocitrate dehydrogenase; ODGH, alpha-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase; Complex II, succinate dehydrogenase; pAMPK, phosphorylated adenosine
  monophosphate protein kinase; PP2A, protein phosphatase; CaMMKβ, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase; ACC, acetyl CoA carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase.'
