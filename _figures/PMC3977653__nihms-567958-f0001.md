caption: 'Recent studies characterize a two-step mechanism for the processing of double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) at the 5′ ends to expose the 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs.
  Depending upon the cell-cycle phase and the type of DNA lesion, a DSB is processed
  by either the nonhomologous end joining pathway or the homologous recombination
  pathway. The names of the human homologs of the yeast proteins depicted are indicated
  in magenta. Following a DSB, the MRX/MRN complex is loaded onto the DNA ends at
  the break site. If cells are in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, nonhomologous end
  joining is used to repair the break. If the cells are in S/G2 phases, phosphorylation
  of Sae2/CtIP by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) favors homologous recombination-mediated
  repair. During the first step of the homologous recombination repair pathway, the
  initial resection of the DSB is promoted by MRX/MRN and Sae2/CtIP, resulting in
  50–100 nucleotide ssDNA 3′ overhangs. In the second step, these fragments can serve
  as templates for long-range DNA end resection. This processive reaction can occur
  by two independent mechanisms: one that utilizes Sgs1/BLM and Dna2 (left) and the
  other using Exo1/hEXO1 (right). Following resection, the exposed ssDNA is coated
  by replication protein A (RPA), which recruits the Rad52 epistasis group of proteins
  (Rad52, Rad55, Rad57, Rad59, Rad54, Rdh54) to enable Rad51 filament formation. The
  DNA ends can be repaired using different mechanisms, such as single-strand annealing,
  break-induced replication, or gene conversion. DSB repair using the homologous chromosome
  is depicted here. After the search for homology, a joint DNA structure is formed.
  The resulting double Holliday junctions are then resolved and the lost bases are
  restored at the break site. The resolution of the junctions by the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1/BLM-TOP3α-RMI1
  (BLAP75) complex depicted here leads to a non-crossover product of DSB repair by
  homologous recombination.'
