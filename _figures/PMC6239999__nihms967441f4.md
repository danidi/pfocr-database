caption: As described in the text and , mucolipin-1 plays an integral role in the
  mTORC1/TFEB nutrient response pathway – with the reported consequences of mucolipin-1's
  absence reviewed here. As described in the text, loss of mucolipin-1 removes the
  primary calcium source required to activate the phosphatase calcineurin, thus impairing
  TFEB dephosphorylation and its nuclear translocation (1-3). This may contribute
  to the mucolipin-1-deficient cell failing to properly respond to low nutrient availability
  via TFEB-mediated activation of the lysosomal network. (; ; ). A full review of
  the role of TFEB in regulating the lysosomal network has been recently presented
  elsewhere ().
