caption: The arsenic metabolic pathway. Arsenate is reduced to arsenite in a reaction
  thought to be dependent on glutathione (GSH) or other endogenous reductants. Arsenite
  then undergoes an oxidative methylation, with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the
  methyl donor, forming monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).
  MMAV is reduced to MMAIII before a subsequent oxidative methylation step yielding
  dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) and SAH. Little is known about the in vivo reduction
  of DMAV to DMAIII. Enzymes capable of catalyzing the illustrated reactions include
  arsenic-3-methyltransferase (AS3MT, formerly known as Cyt19) (), arsenite methyltransferase
  and methylarsonite methyltransferase (), and MMAV reductase (also known as GST omega)
  (). GSSG, glutathione disulfide; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; TR, thioredoxin;
  Trx, thioredoxin reductase.
