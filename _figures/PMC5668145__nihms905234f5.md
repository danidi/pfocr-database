caption: 'Steady-state levels of TCA intermediates in control and KO livers and tumors
  and the expression of key enzymes in the glutaminolysis pathway. (A) All results
  are from those shown in  and are expressed relative to those of control liver. Red:
  intermediates that were present at a higher level; green: intermediates that were
  present at a lower level; grey: intermediates that were not measured (succinyl-CoA
  and oxaloacetate); black: intermediates that did not change significantly. (B) Immunoblots
  of representative liver and tumor samples from control and KO mice showing expression
  of glutamate dehydrogenase 1/2 (GLDH) and glutaminase 2 (GLS2). GAPDH served as
  a loading control. (C) Citrate synthase activity measured in control and pKO livers
  and tumors. Error bars indicate the mean +/- SEM. Ctrl = control, pKO = pan-knockout,
  rKO = restricted KO, L = liver, T = tumor.'
