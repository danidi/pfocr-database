caption: Molecular mechanism governing ANGPTL4-mediated TG hydrolysis. LPL monomer
  is linked to nANGPTL4 protein fraction, thus shifting the balance between LPL dimers
  and monomers towards the latter. As a consequence, LPL is inhibited and this causes
  the alteration of TG clearance from the plasma and uptake decrease of FFA into the
  peripheral tissues. The intervention of ANGPTL4 on LPL causes also the reduction
  of LPL affinity for GPIHBP1 protein.
