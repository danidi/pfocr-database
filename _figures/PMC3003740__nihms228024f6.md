caption: Potential tumor-suppressive functions of p16. In the canonical pathway, p16
  mediates cell cycle arrest as part of the DNA damage response pathway, allowing
  time for DNA repair enzymes to correct potentially oncogenic mutations or avoiding
  transformation by inducing senescence. Loss of p16 leads to increased ROS levels
  (direct or indirect effect, indicated by dashed/solid line) and oxidative DNA damage,
  which in p16-deficient cells with impaired capacity for cell cycle arrest and senescence,
  may result in increased accumulation of mutations promoting oncogenesis. Melanocytes
  are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress (), perhaps explaining why loss
  of p16 predisposes to melanoma rather than other cancers.
