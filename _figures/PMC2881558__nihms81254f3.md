caption: Model of neuronal ischemic preconditioning. Based on our observations that
  preconditioning elicits caspase cleavage and ROS generation, which are required
  for expression of protection and that this protection requires new protein synthesis,
  we propose the following pathway mediates protection. We hypothesize that the initial
  energetic stress put on cells generates ROS and activation of mitochondrial KATP
  channels. These events likely contribute to limited cytochrome c redistribution
  and caspase 3 activation. Cleaved caspases are likely held in check by preexisting
  proteins such as HSC 70. When these proteins are depleted, this results in the activation
  of a positive feedback cycle leading to increased production of HSPs and other neuroprotective
  proteins. Signal transduction cascades such as protein kinases of the MAPK family
  and PKC family as well as others, are likely critical components of this protective
  pathway. The upregulation of HSP 70 is able to block normally lethal exposure to
  subsequent injuries. Many of the kinases, proteases, chaperones and transcription
  factors in this pathway could be exploited for development of neurotherapeutics
  to recapitulate endogenous neuroprotection.
