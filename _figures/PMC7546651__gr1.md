caption: Overview of the modeling strategies in the metabolic engineering research.
  (A) Data from different sources are used to construct (B) the metabolic pathways
  that produces the substance of interest. (C) An appropriate computational modeling
  approach is used to simulate the pathway response to a given perturbation in silico.
  The simulation results are analyzed to identity key regulatory steps, such as bottlenecks,
  which will then be tested using data from different conditions (e.g. gene knockouts
  or different growth conditions) (figure adapted from ). (D) Finally, the model predictions
  are experimentally validated.
