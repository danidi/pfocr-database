caption: Schematic showing the proposed mechanism of action and regulation of HNRNPK/miR-7.
  Upon insulin signaling or LXR activation, induced SREBP1c can form a transcriptional
  complex with Sp1 and NFY and binds to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter
  region of HNRNPK, leading to its transcriptional activation. miR-7-1, encoded in
  intron 16 of the human HNRNPK gene, is cotranscribed with the host gene and targets
  a number of insulin signaling and LXR pathway components, regulating its own expression
  in a negative-feedback loop. By affecting both LXR and insulin signaling genes,
  altered levels of miR-7 during states of metabolic dysregulation could ameliorate
  neuroprotective actions of insulin and LXR in the brain, thus representing a possible
  molecular link between insulin resistance and AD at the posttranscriptional level.
