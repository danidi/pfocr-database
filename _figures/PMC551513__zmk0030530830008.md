caption: Suggested model for the cAMP-mediated inhibition of DNA replication. In S
  phase cells, elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP induces the expression of
  p21Cip1 protein. This leads to inhibition of Cdk2-cyclin kinase activity. Abrogation
  of Cdk2-cyclin kinase activity in turn leads to expression of hypophosphorylated,
  active form of Rb (pRb), which leads to disruption of PCNA association with chromatin,
  and thus inhibition of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, data presented here argue for
  an additional, Rb-independent pathway through which p21Cip1, possibly via inhibition
  of Cdk2-cyclin kinase, can regulate PCNA activity and DNA replication. Pre-Rc, prereplication
  complex.
