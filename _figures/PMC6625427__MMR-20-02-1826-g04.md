caption: Proposed model for NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway involved in inflammatory
  pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis. Stimulated PBMCs orchestrate activation
  of NLRP3 inflammasome due to the upregulation of the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1,
  and their downstream mediators, leading to atherosclerotic progression. NLRP3, nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein
  3; PBMCs, peripheral blood monocytes; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD.
