caption: Reconstruction of Br1 and Br3 cell counter-regulatory mechanisms during induction
  of tolerance to allergen stimulation. IL-10 produced by Br1 cells mediates counter-regulatory
  effects through the IL-10/IL-27/IL-21 pathway. TGF-β produced by Br3 cells also
  induced apoptosis of both Br1 and Br3 cells. Moreover, activation-mediated apoptosis
  plays a role in counter-regulation of immune responses.
