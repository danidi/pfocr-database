  neurons are the sensory class with the most presynaptic contacts on ELs.(C) The
  vbd-A08e3-RP2 pathway is bilaterally symmetric at the level of arbor morphology,
  synapse number, and synapse location. Top: the A3 left vbd has two zones of pre-synaptic
  contacts with A08e3, which forms synapses with the ventral-most region of the RP2
  motor neuron dendritic arbor. Bottom: the A3 right vbd-A08e3-RP2 pathway has the
  similar location and number of synaptic contacts. Posterior view; dorsal up, midline,
  dashed line.(D–E) Examples of synapse morphology in the TEM reconstruction for vbd-A08e3
  (left) and A08e3-RP2 (right). Note the pre-synaptic vesicle accumulation and electron
  density at the synapse. Synapses were identified as in ().(F) Stimulation of ELs
  with Chrimson activates dorsal motor neurons. 488 nm laser illuminated the neuropil,
  which simultaneously activated Chrimson in ELs (red) and allowed for visualization
  of GCaMP6m fluorescence in CQ2-labeled dorsal motor neurons (green). Each line shows
  GCaMP6m signal in a different isolated brain preparation. Horizontal lines show
  baseline fluorescence. Response is significantly different between EL activation
  and controls, p<0.05, Chi-Square. The top, middle, and bottom datasets are: (top)
  the indicated genotype + ATR (n =11); (middle) the indicated genotype without ATR
