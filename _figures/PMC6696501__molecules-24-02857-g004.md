caption: 'Effects of H2S on oxidative stress in diabetes kidney disease. H2S is found
  to reduce high glucose-induced oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2 antioxidant
  pathway and two downstream targets of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1, as well as enhancing
  the SOD and glutathione peroxidase activities in diabetes kidney disease. Nrf2,
  nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; NQO1, NADPH:
  quinone oxidoreductase-1; SOD, superoxide dismutase.'
