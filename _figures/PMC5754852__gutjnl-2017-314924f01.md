caption: Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response
  to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the
  clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic
  failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent
  referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside
  evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice
  of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that
  should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence
  of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD.
  For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas
  of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat
  testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme
  elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for
  users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction
  due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral. ALP, alkaline phosphatase;
  ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ARLD, alcohol-related liver disease; AST, aspartate
  aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index; FBC, full blood count; GGT, γ-glutamyltransferase;
  INR, international normalised ratio; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NAFLD, non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus; USS, ultrasound scan.
