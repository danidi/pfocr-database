caption: a (i) Extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) for the compound with the mass 319.08 Da
  in reaction mixtures containing malonyl-CoA as substrate and chalcone synthase-like
  (CHS-L9) (STO07G228250), chalcone synthase (CHS) (STO03G058250), or heat-denatured
  CHS-L9. (ii) EIC for the mass 335.13 Da in reaction mixtures containing 13C3-malonyl-CoA
  containing CHS-L9 or heat-denatured CHS-L9 enzyme. Dots in the structure represent
  13C-labeled carbons. b (i) EIC for the mass 301.07 Da in reaction mixtures containing
  malonyl-CoA as substrate containing CHS-L9, CHS, or heat-denatured CHS-L9. The inset
  shows a zoomed region of the EIC chromatogram. (ii) EIC for the mass 317.12 Da in
  reaction mixtures containing 13C3-malonyl-CoA containing CHS-L9 or heat-denatured
  CHS-L9 enzyme. c PKS-mediated biosynthetic pathway of anthraquinones. Two pathway
  intermediates, atrochrysone carboxylic acid and endocrocin anthrone, were produced
  in the CHS-L9-catalyzed reaction mixture.
