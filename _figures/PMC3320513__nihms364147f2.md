caption: 'The arrows indicate the direction of the coagulation cascade (from activation
  to fibrin clot formation). The lines passing through AT show the points in the pathway
  inhibited by heparin, low and ultralow MW heparins through their interactions with
  AT. The thinner line passing through AT indicates the low level of thrombin inhibition
  by low MW heparins. AT: Anti-thrombin III; LMWH: Low MW heparin; ULMWH: Ultralow
  MW heparin.'
