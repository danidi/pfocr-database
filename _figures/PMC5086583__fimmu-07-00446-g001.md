caption: Immune effector cells induce tumor cell death through apoptosis and necrotic-like
  cell lysis. Death ligands (FasL, TRAIL) presented by immune effector cell interact
  with their corresponding death receptors (DRs) on the surface of the tumor cell
  and activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Ligand binding induces DR activation
  leading to the recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD and pro-caspase-8. Pro-caspase-8
  is converted to its active form (active-C8), and it cleaves the effector caspase-3,
  -6, and -7 to their active forms, thus engaging the executioner caspase cascade.
  Active-C8 can also trigger the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the conversion
  of the BH3-only protein Bid to its active form, tBid. tBid, in turn, induces the
  formation of Bax/Bak megachannels in the outer mitochondrial membrane-releasing
  cytochrome c (Cyt c) into the cytosol. In conjunction with Apaf-1, pro-caspase-9
  and Cyt c assembles into the apoptosome, where pro-caspase-9 becomes activated (active-C9)
  and released. Active-C9 assists active-C8 in the induction of the executioner caspase
  cascade. Activation of the DRs may also induce necrosis-like cell death through
  DR-mediated assembly of the necrosome complex consisting of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL.
  In the necrosome, MLKL gets phosphorylated by RIPK1/RIPK3 leading to its oligomerization
  and translocation into the plasma membrane where it triggers Ca2+ and Na+ influx
  driving cell lysis. Recognition of the tumor cell may also trigger the secretion
  of perforin and granzymes from lytic granules toward the target cell. Secreted perforin
  forms pores in the target cell causing direct cell lysis and enabling the entry
  of the serine proteases granzyme A and B (GA and GB) into the target cell. GB can
  induce apoptosis by activating caspases through cleavage. GB can also cleave Bid
  to tBid, thus engaging the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. GA can induce cell death
  in a caspase-independent manner by inducing DNA fragmentation and blocking DNA repair.
