caption: Receptor complexes sharing gp130 as a signal transducer. IL-6, when bound
  to either a membrane-anchored or soluble form of its receptor (IL-6R or sIL-6R),
  induces the formation of gp130/gp130 homodimer. Heterodimer of LIFR and gp130 is
  induced by the CNTF-CNTFR complex, CNTF-sCNTFR complex, LIF, OSM or CT-1. OSM also
  induces another heterodimer composed of OSM-specific receptor (OSMR) and 130. The
  IL-11-IL-11R and IL-11-sIL-11R complex is considered to induce gp130/gp130 homodimer.
