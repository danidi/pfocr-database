caption: The proposed model of Rad53- and Chk1-dependent DNA damage response pathways
  in C. neoformans. C. neoformans has evolutionarily conserved and distinct DNA damage
  response pathways to counteract deleterious effects caused by DNA damage stresses.
  In response to exogenous or endogenous DNA damage, Mec1 and Tel1 kinases cooperatively
  phosphorylate Rad53 kinase. The activated Rad53 induces the expression of its downstream
  genes involved in DNA damage repair system, including Chk1 kinase, by inducing the
  expression of Bdr1 transcription factor. Chk1, which is another kinase downstream
  of PI3K, is mainly induced by the Mec1-Rad53 signaling pathway in response to DNA
  damage stress. Rad53 and Chk1 play both redundant and discrete roles in DNA damage
  response and adaptation, oxidative stress response, melanin production, antifungal
  drug susceptibility, phagosome maturation, and virulence in C. neoformans.
