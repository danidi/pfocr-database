caption: Proposed framework for recruitment of T cells into the gut mucosa by activated
  CD40L+ platelets. CD40L+ platelets and soluble CD40L bind to CD40+ endothelial cells
  (HIMEC) that start producing chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-8. On contact with
  HIMEC, activated platelets release massive amounts of RANTES (regulated on activation
  normal T expressed and secreted) stored in their granules which is retained on the
  surface and HIMEC and mediates binding of T cell to the microvascular cells through
  the receptors CCR1, 3, and 5. In addition, CD40L+ platelets bind to HIMEC where
  they induce upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular
  adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, both of which contribute to recruitment of additional
  T cells.
