caption: 'Cartoon representing the overview of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the
  potential activity of ruxolitinib. The left part of the picture reports the most
  common pathogenetic events happening along SARS-Cov2 infection in 85/90% of patients:
  after virus invasion, antigen presentation, and establishment of an adaptive immune
  response, lungs reach the viral clearance with low or no symptoms. The right part
  of the figure reports instead the worse scenario where an exacerbation of the inflammatory
  response characterized by increased neutrophils and Th17 activation lead to ferritin
  overload, alveolar damage with fibrosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation
  (DIC) which could potentially kill the patient. These events mainly depend on an
  uncontrolled activation of the JAK-STAT pathway (trough canonical and non-canonical
  signaling) which finally leads to uncoordinated production and release of inflammatory
  cytokines (CRS) within the alveolar microenvironment. By targeting the JAK-STAT
  pathway, ruxolitinib could disrupt this “vicious circle” and restore the correct
  alveolar functionality.'
