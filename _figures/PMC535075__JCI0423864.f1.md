caption: Acid-sensing pathway in renal proximal tubular cells. A drop in extracellular
  fluid pH induces a corresponding decrease in intracellular pH that induces activation
  of Pyk2, through an unidentified mechanism, by phosphorylation on tyrosine 402.
  Phosphorylated Pyk2 binds to the SH2 domain of c-Src, phosphorylating and activating
  it, producing subsequent activation of the MAPK and JNK signaling pathways and an
  increase in transcription of NHE3, the sodium-hydrogen exchanger of the proximal
  tubule brush border.
