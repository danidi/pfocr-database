caption: A Simplified interaction map between the LOXL4 protein with the OS pathway
  by both protein-protein interaction analysis and literature mining. The red solid
  lines specify a direct physical interaction between the LOXL4 protein and the indicated
  proteins. The green arrow lines indicate transcriptional activation by the OS pathway.
  The green dashed arrow-lines signify the impact on OS pathway via effect on the
  phosphorylation state, activity or the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Nrf1/2
  proteins. T headed purple line indicates the direct interaction of SirT1 with SUV39H1
  with a repression effect. The red circles designate the genes that expressed higher
  in H-bc than 5637 cells, while the blue circles indicate the genes in a reverse
  state of expression (based on the RNA-seq data, not shown in this paper).
