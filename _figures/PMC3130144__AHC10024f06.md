caption: Schematic diagram of molecular mechanism of autophagy with synthesis of cathepsin
  D. Autophagy comprises an initiating stage from Tor to a complex formation that
  includes Atg1 in the endoplasmic reticulum; a vesicle nucleation stage with a complex
  including Atg6/beclin-1; vesicle elongation and autophagosome formation stage with
  membrane-bound LC3 and engulfing target organella; and an auto(phago)lysosome formation
  stage with activation of lysosome enzymes including cathepsin D. On the other hand,
  cathepsin D is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, develops by adding
  glyocoproteins to itself in the Golgi apparatus and is stored in the lysosomes when
  the ATP-dependent H+ pump adds acidity to the lysosome content to activate cathepsin
  D. Some autolysosomes become endosomes when there is a connection to innate and
  adaptive immunity, and autolysosomes finally become residual bodies. The pharmacological
  functional analysis of autophagy is made possible by the inhibition of PI3K sending
  signals to Tor (the PI3K-Tor pathway) and of the ATP-dependent H+ pump adding acicidity
  to the lysosomal and autolysosomal contents (the activation of cathepsin D). Each
  or combined failures in the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome, in the degradation
  of content in the autolysosome, and in the activation of cathepsin D by ATP-dependent
  H+ pump induce autophagic cell death (ACD) with enlarged autophagosomes and autolysosomes.
