caption: The metabolic network was reconstructed by KEGG Automatic Annotation Server
  (KAAS) method. Enzymes identified in Natrinema sp. J7-2 are shown in a red font,
  and their gene numbers are given in parentheses. The semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff
  (ED) pathway is indicated with red arrows.
