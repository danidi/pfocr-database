caption: There are two major pathways of apoptosis, i.e, the death receptor pathway
  which is mediated by activation of death receptors and the Bcl-2 regulated mitochondrial
  pathway which is mediated by noxious stimuli that ultimately lead to mitochondrial
  injury. Ligation of death receptors recruits the adaptor protein FADD (Fas associated
  death domain) via its death domain. FADD in turn recruits caspase-8 which ultimately
  activates caspase-3, the key ‘executioner’ caspase. c-FLIP can either inhibit or
  potentiate binding of FADD and caspase-8 depending upon its concentration. In the
  intrinsic pathway, pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins are activated by noxious stimuli which
  interact with and inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Thus, Bax and Bax are
  free to induce mitochondrial permeabilization with release of cytochrome-C which
  ultimately results in activation of caspase-9 (via the apoptosome). Caspase-9 then
  activates caspase-3. SMAC/DIABLO is also released following mitochondrial permeabilization
  and acts to block the action of IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis protein) which inhibit
  caspase activation. Note that there is potential cross-talk between the 2 pathways
  which is mediated by tBid that is produced by caspase-8 mediated Bid cleavage. tBid
  acts to inhibit Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and to activate Bax and Bak. There is debate about
  whether pro-apoptotic BH3 molecules Bim, PUMA, etc. can act directly on Bax and
  Bak (indicated by the question mark) to induce mitochondrial permeability or whether
  they only act on Bcl-2/Bcl-xL.
