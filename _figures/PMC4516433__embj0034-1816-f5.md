caption: Proposed model for CP gateway dysfunction for leukocyte trafficking following
  cerebroventricular nitric oxide elevationSchematic illustration of the intracellular
  cascade of events at the CP compartment, following stimulation with TNFα, in physiology,
  and under pathological conditions of chronic exposure to nitric oxide. (1) In the
  steady state, the CP senses CSF-borne danger/pro-inflammatory signals, derived from
  the brain parenchyma. TNFα, as a particular example of those signals, is sensed
  by the CP via the TNFα receptor (TNF-R). (2) Upon TNFα stimulation, TNF-R signaling
  cascade is funneled, through the NFκB pathway, into translocation of the p65 subunit
  to the nucleus, which initiates a cellular response involving the upregulation of
  IFNγ-R on the CP epithelium, leukocyte trafficking determinant expression, and disruption
  of the epithelial tight junctions. (3) IFNγ, secreted by CP stromal Th1 cells, acts
  in synergy with the NFκB signaling pathway, in inducing the expression of specific
  leukocyte trafficking molecules such as ICAM-1, CCL2, and CXCL10. Together, these
  events support CP-mediated leukocyte entry to the CNS. (4) Under neuroinflammatory
  conditions, which involve cerebroventricular elevation of nitric oxide levels and
  its accumulation at the CP, nitrosative modifications of the NFκB complex prevent
  its nuclear translocation following TNFα stimulation.
