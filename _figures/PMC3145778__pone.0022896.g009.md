caption: TGF-β1 stimulates caveolin-1Y14 phosphorylation in a reactive oxygen species-FAK/c-Src
  dependent manner removing repressive influences on EGFR signaling (in red) leading
  to EGFR transactivation (also by c-Src), thereby, initiating signaling events leading
  to the MEK-ERK pathway activation necessary for PAI-1 induction. Src kinase phosphorylation
  of caveolin-1Y14 also stimulates Rho-GTP loading and ROCK (an established downstream
  target of Rho) activation is necessary for PAI-1 induction. pCaveolin-1Y14-Rho-ROCK
  mediated signaling leads to inhibition of PTEN-PPM1A interactions resulting in a
  reduction of nuclear PPM1A phosphatase (black pathway), thereby, maintaining the
  pSMAD2/3 levels (highlighted in blue) required for PAI-1 induction by TGF-β1 (see
  text). PAI-1 is elevated in atherosclerotic plaques frequently colocalizing with
  α-smooth muscle actin-expressing cells, presumably VSMCs (insert).
