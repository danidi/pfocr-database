caption: Proposed carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in R. marinus, based on (), with
  added information obtained in this study. The molecular structures and abbreviated
  enzyme names are shown, phytoene synthase (CrtB), 1’,2’-hydratase (CruF), phytoene
  desaturase (CrtI), glycosyltransferase (CruC), acyltransferase (CruD), lycopene
  cyclase (CrtY) and carotene ketolase (CrtO).
