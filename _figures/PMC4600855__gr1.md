caption: S-nitrosylation in TRAIL/DR4 and FaL/Fas signaling pathways. NO affects several
  proteins in death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathways. Among them, the TRAIL-receptor
  DR4 and Fas have been shown to be S-nitrosylated in their cytoplasmic domain thereby
  increasing their activity to trigger apoptosis of target cells. The Ying Yang 1,
  inhibitor of Fas, is also shown to be S-nitrosylated upon NO donnor treatment. This
  S-nitrosylation inhibits its activity toward Fas and permits dowstream apoptotic
  signal transduction. NO inhibits caspase 3 or 9. More recently, the S-nitrosylation
  of cFLIP, an inhibitor of Fas and DR4 signaling pathway has been shown to inhibit
  its degradation by the proteasome, thereby making it a more potent inhibitor of
  Fas and DR4 signaling. S-nitrosylated cFLIP will bind to RIP1 and subsequently activate
  the NF-KB signaling pathway leading to cell proliferation and survival.
