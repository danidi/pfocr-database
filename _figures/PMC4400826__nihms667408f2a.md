caption: Oncogenic Kras (KRAS*) can create metabolic alterations in pancreatic tumor
  cells. (A). Activation of the of the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade leads to increased MYC
  levels which promotes increased expression of various enzymes involved in glucose
  metabolism (representative enzymes that are increased are indicated). This promotes
  increased glycolysis as well as increased flux of glucose derived carbon through
  anabolic pathways such as the non-oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) to produce ribose for DNA/RNA biosynthesis and the hexosamine biosynthesis
  pathway (HBP) to produce glycosylation precursors. Kras regulated pathways are depicted
  in red and representative enzymes upregulated by oncogenic Kras are indicated for
  each pathway. The oxidative PPP (in purple) which can produce NADPH is not regulated
  by Kras. OAA (oxaloacetate); Asp (aspartate) (B). Kras causes a shift in glutamine
  metabolism in pancreatic cancers, through an unknown downstream program, repressing
  GLUD1 and increasing GOT1 expression. This pathway is a major source of cytosolic
  NADPH in Kras mutant pancreatic cancer cells and is critical for redox balance.
  Both mitochondrial (the structure depicted is a mitochondria) and cytosolic enzymes
  are involved in this pathway.
