caption: S1P is proposed to promote cell contractility through S1P2 activation of
  calcium-independent and calcium-dependent signaling pathways. In the calcium-dependent
  signaling pathway, MLCK is activated to phosphorylate MRLC. In the calcium-independent
  signaling pathway, ROCK is activated to phosphorylate MRLC and inactivate myosin
  light chain phosphatase. Activated MRLC bind to the neck domain of NMMII and activate
  actomyosin contractility. Actomyosin contractility is believed to cause Dupuytren’s
  disease. S1P stimulates fibroblast contractility through S1P2 receptor mediated
  calcium-dependent and -independent pathways.
