caption: Methionine sets up a hierarchical metabolic response leading to anabolism.
  (A) Grouping of the methionine-induced genes, focusing on amino acid and nucleotide
  metabolism. The schematic shows the methionine-responsive genes in various amino
  acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways, along with their fold changes in gene
  expression (indicated by the color bar). The substrates/cofactors produced by the
  PPP-GDH-PLP node (see ) for the individual steps in these pathways is also mapped
  on to the schematic. Note that all gene products induced by methionine in these
  pathways use PPP intermediates, NADPH, PLP and/or glutamine/glutamate (indicated
  within gray ovals) in their biochemical reactions. (B) A bird’s-eye view description
  of the amino acid biosynthesis steps regulated by methionine, with metabolically
  expensive or inexpensive steps indicated. Each bead (or filled circle) represents
  a step in the pathway (prepared according to the individual amino acid pathways
  shown at https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/; details in Supplemental Figures 4 and
  5). A step is considered expensive (red) when it is either the entry point or the
  exit point or if it involves ATP utilization or reduction. All the rest of the steps
  are considered inexpensive (gray). Methionine-induced steps are shown with a yellow
  fill at the centre of the circle for the given step. p = 7.4e-5 (Fisher’s exact
  test) for methionine-dependent induction of genes encoding the critical, rate-limiting,
  or costly steps in amino acid biosynthesis (not significant for the inexpensive
  steps). (C) A proposed hierarchical organization of the methionine-mediated anabolic
  remodeling. Methionine induces expression of genes in the PPP-GDH-PLP node, which
  provides precursors for the key steps in the biosynthesis of all other amino acids
  and nucleotides, and these steps are also directly induced by methionine.
