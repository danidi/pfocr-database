caption: 'Summary of the effects of different diets on whole body metabolism. a High-fructose
  diet intake interferes glycolytic pathway by bypassing the rate-controlling step,
  the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Phosphofructokinase
  acts as a negative regulator for glucose metabolism and allows fructose to enter
  the glycolytic pathway continuously to produce pyruvate, lactate, glycerol and acyl-glycerol.
  b When plenty of glucose is available during high dietary carbohydrate, glucose
  utilizing pathways are initiated: breakdown of glucose by glycolysis, conversion
  of glucose into glycogen via glycogenesis, and production of insulin which acts
  on adipose tissue to promote fatty acids synthesis. c Consumption of high-sucrose
  diet: sucrose separates into fructose and glucose molecules and enters their specific
  mechanisms as stated earlier. d Fats undergo lipolysis, glycerol and fatty acids
  are released into the blood. However, fatty acids released during lipolysis are
  re-esterified to form triglyceride. Overproduction of triglyceride through excessive
  intake of various nutrients is likely to cause accumulation of triglyceride in the
  liver, which will further lead to hepatic insulin resistance (reduced insulin sensitivity)'
