caption: 'The role of methylglyoxal and methylglyoxal pathway in cell response to
  oxidative stress. The possible role of MGO and MGO pathway in cell response to OxS
  are schematically represented. OxS is shown to cause the elevation of MGO level
  as a result of OxS-induced S-glutathionylation and inhibition of GAPDH. In the presence
  of non-limiting amounts of cGSH, MGO can feed the MGO pathway, leading to increased
  SLG and D-LAC formation which can both facilitate the res-toration of the normal
  redox state. The possible role of MGO as a signaling molecule, through protein modification
  and gene expression modulation, is also represented. SLG can feed the mGSH pool
  via mGLO2 reaction, thus contributing to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS)
  scavenging. D-LAC oxidation, catalyzed by the mitochondrial flavoprotein D-lactate
  de-hydrogenase (D-LDH), can sustain mitochondrial ATP production, bypassing the
  ROS-producing complex I (CI) of the respiratory chain. D-LAC can also cause the
  efflux of malate (MAL) from mitochondria, thus contributing to NADPH synthesis and
  ROS detoxification in the cytosol. The role of OxS-induced S-glutathionylation,
  to which GLO2 and SLG can contribute, in the inhibition of certain cytosolic and
  mitochondrial enzymes, and protection of protein cysteine residues (CYS) from irreversible
  deactivation, is also highlighted. The white-filled arrows indicate the enhance-ment/decrease
  of metabolite levels caused by, or in response to OxS. Grey writings and arrows
  in-dicate decreased metabolite levels/reactions due to OxS-activated S-glutathionylations.
