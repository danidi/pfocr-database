caption: Graphical summary of MITF action as a potent antioxidant in RPE cells through
  regulating NRF2-dependant antioxidant signaling to protect the neural retina against
  oxidative stress-induced degeneration. MITF directly binds to the NRF2 promoter
  to stimulate its transcription. Meanwhile, MITF up-regulates p62 to promote the
  nuclear translocation of NRF2, which actives the antioxidant signaling in RPE cells
  and protects the neural retina against oxidative damage (left). MITF dysfunction
  will impair the NRF2-dependent antioxidant signaling and exacerbates retinal degeneration
  under oxidative stress (right).
