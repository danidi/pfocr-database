caption: (A) Treg destabilizing signals. During immune-mediated inflammation, activated
  DCs secrete IL-6 and ligate the TCR on Tregs. In the same milieu, activated effector
  T cells produce IFNγ. Through various intermediate pathways, these upstream signals
  result in activation of PI3K; phosphorylation of Akt on the activating S473 and
  T308 sites; and activation of mTOR (mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes). mTOR activation
  also feeds back to activate Akt, so the pathway functions as a loop. Activated Akt
  phosphorylates and inactivates the transcription factors FoxO3a and FoxO1, contributing
  to down-regulation of a suite of Treg-associated genes, and inhibition of the Treg
  suppressor phenotype. The IL-6-receptor, via induction of miR-17, also inhibits
  the transcription factor Eos, which is a binding partner for Foxp3, further destabilizing
  the suppressive phenotype. (B) Dominant stabilizing signals. In the tumor microenvironment,
  tolerogenic DCs and other APCs may express IDO (e.g., in response to local IFNγ,
  or induced by apoptotic cells). IDO degrades local tryptophan, activating the amino-acid
  sensitive kinase GCN2, which can inhibit mTOR. Low tryptophan and other metabolic
  deficiency states (e.g., low glucose) in the tumor microenvironment may also depress
  mTOR signaling. Surface receptors such as neuropilin-1 and PD-1 activate the PTEN
  phosphatase, which inhibits PI3K activity. In the absence of PI3K and mTORC2 activity,
  Akt is not phosphorylated and activated. Without Akt activity, FoxO1 and FoxO3a
  are allowed to remain active, and the Tregs are not destabilized. The FoxO1/FoxO3a
  axis also appears to feed back and up-regulate PD-1 and PTEN expression, thereby
  creating a self-reinforcing loop the stabilizes the suppressive Treg phenotype.
