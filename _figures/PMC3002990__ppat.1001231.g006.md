caption: Detection of PAMPs by cell surface receptors triggers the onset of the NF-κB
  signaling cascade, leading to a chain of events involving protein modifications
  and degradations; ultimately, activated p65/p50 NF-κBs enter the nucleus to transcribe
  various inflammatory genes, including IL-8. EPEC/EHEC utilizes two distinct T3SS-dependent
  non-LEE effectors to subdue this response. This is accomplished by the coordinated
  targeting of upstream and downstream components of the NF-κB pathway by NleE and
  NleC, respectively. NleE, by an unknown mechanism, retards the activation of IKK,
  thus retaining p65/p50 in a complex with IκB. NleC digests activated p65 and to
  a lesser extent the IκB-bound p65, to decrease the amount of NF-κB available to
  enter the nucleus, hence reducing the overall host response to the infection.
