caption: Possible mechanism of drug resistance related to miR-326 in pediatric acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) leukemic cells. Smo gene targeted by miR-326 may regulate
  the stemness-related target genes of Hh pathway. It may contribute to leukemic cells
  survival and, subsequently, overexpression of the drug resistance gene, ABCA3, followed
  by efflux of the prescribed chemotherapy drugs. In addition, it is likely that miR-326
  completes its role in drug resistance through the regulation of ABCA2 transporter.
  Black arrow, stimulation; red blunt-ended arrow, direct inhibition; dashed arrow,
  unconfirmed indirect effect; hh, protein ligand; pALL, pediatric acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia.
