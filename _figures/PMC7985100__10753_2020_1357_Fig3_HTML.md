caption: Effects of signaling pathways and gene regulation on NLRP3 inflammasome.
  The regulatory effects of different signaling pathways on NLRP3 inflammasome in
  diseases associated with bone loss and vascular calcification were evaluated. JAK
  positively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome through the PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT pathways.
  The Wnt pathway exhibits a different regulatory pathway for NLRP3 inflammasome,
  which may differ from the effect of β-catenin on NLRP3 inflammasome. MAPK is a common
  upstream pathway node of NF-kB and several studies have established that MAPK has
  a similar regulatory effect to the classic NF-kB/NLRP3 inflammatory response pathway.
  Numerous studies have established that Nrf2 can indirectly inhibit the MAPK signaling
  pathway, thus inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators. RIPK1 undergoes
  polyubiquitination under TNF stimulation. Subsequently, RIPK1 and RIPK3 are phosphorylated
  to form a necrosome complex and promote necroptosis by stimulating NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a multifunctional protein involved in the
  maintenance of homeostasis and is isolated from thioredoxin (TRX) in response to
  ROS, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. TREM is a glycoprotein molecule on the plasma
  membrane, which works together with the TLR of monocyte-macrophages to activate
  NLRP3 inflammasome and enhance pro-inflammatory effect. Previous studies have established
  that PKR is activated by binding to dsRNA derived from viruses. DICER, a member
  of the RNase III family, specifically recognizes and cleaves dsRNA. Activated PKR
  induces immune response through phosphorylation of eIF2α.
