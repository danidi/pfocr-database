caption: Proposed mechanisms by which proline metabolism mediates redox homeostasis
  and energy production via NADP+/NADPH. (1) NADP+ produced by proline biosynthesis
  may stimulate the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), thereby supporting energy production
  and the biosynthesis of key molecules such as nucleotides. NADPH is utilized for
  reductive biosynthesis pathways and is critical for glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin
  (Trx) antioxidant systems. (2) In plant chloroplasts, NADP+ produced from proline
  biosynthesis may replenish depleted NADP+ pools caused by inhibition of the Calvin
  cycle during stress. Maintaining adequate levels of NADP+ for electrons transfer
  to the ETC would help minimize ROS generation during stress. Dashed line indicates
  inhibition. GR, glutathione reductase; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; GSSG, oxidized
  glutathione; GSH, reduced glutathione; TrxR, thioredoxin reductase; Trx-(SH)2, reduced
  thioredoxin; Trx-S2, oxidized thioredoxin; NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form; Glucose-6-P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
