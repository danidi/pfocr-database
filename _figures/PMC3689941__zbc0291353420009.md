caption: STAT3 pathway switching is induced by EMT during breast cancer progression.
  Early-stage BCs utilize SRC-dependent EGFR signaling to drive STAT3 activation and
  primary tumor growth. Although EGFR is capable of activating STAT3 downstream of
  FN engagement, the growth factor-stimulated pathway appears to be the prominent
  mode in pre-EMT cells. Late-stage BCs that have acquired EMT phenotypes utilize
  β1 integrin receptors to engage the ECM containing aberrant levels of FN thereby
  activating a FAK/PYK2:JAK2:STAT3 signaling cascade. This pathway may be clinically
  relevant at the metastatic tumor site and likely contributes to the resistance of
  BC to EGFR targeted therapies. Targets for pharmacological and immunological inhibitors
  used in this study are also highlighted.
