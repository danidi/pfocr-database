caption: The mechanism of pCaM activating PI3Kα. Given here is a schematic illustration
  of PI3Kα activation by pCaMs with extended and collapsed conformations. pCaM with
  the populated extended conformation targets the nSH2 domain, releasing its autoinhibition.
  Extended pCaM extracts K-Ras4B from membranes and undergoes a conformational change
  into collapsed conformation. The collapsed state is the favored conformation for
  cSH2, allosterically activating PI3Kα. Upon the activation by pCaM, PI3K binds to
  membranes and catalyzes the PIP2 to PIP3, to which Akt binds to execute the proliferation
  pathway. K-Ras4B binds phospholipids selectively. The inner plasma membrane leaflet
  is enriched with anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol.
  K-Ras4B activation level in cancer cells has been linked to phosphatidylserine ().
