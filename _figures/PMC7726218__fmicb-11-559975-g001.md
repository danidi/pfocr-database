caption: Diagram of the cAMP/PKA nutrient signaling pathway and two downstream effectors
  (ergosterol synthesis and trehalose accumulation) in C. albicans. Glucose metabolism
  in the mitochondria and cytosol depends on total NAD, which is constantly monitored
  by the cAMP/PKA pathway (left box). The major events in glycolysis that also require
  the NAD coenzyme are shown to highlight the possible affected steps for cAMP reduction
  observed in mitochondrial CI mutants such as ndh51Δ. We assume that Ras1-Tpk2 (in
  bold) activation harmonizes mitochondrial NAD metabolism and also actuates Pde1
  to avoid an overactive cAMP/PKA response. The cAMP/PKA proteins are presented in
  green, and feedback control proteins are marked in red. MDL represents MDL-12330,
  which inhibits adenylyl cyclase for cAMP synthesis; BuC represents bucladesine,
  a cell membrane-soluble cAMP analog. Ergosterol content undergoes a change under
  either of BuC or MDL.
