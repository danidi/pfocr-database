caption: Hemoglobin production and redox homeostasis in erythrocytes. (A) NF-E2p45
  participates in the transcriptional activation of α- and β-hemoglobin, as well as
  heme-synthetic enzymes, such as porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), uroporphyrinogen
  III synthase (UROS), and ferrochelatase (FECH), in erythroblasts. After enucleation,
  erythrocytes combat oxidative stress inducined by hemoglobin autoxidation through
  a mechanism that is not regulated by gene transcription. (B) Glucose metabolism
  supplies NADH, which is utilized for methemoglobin reduction. Superoxide anions
  () are eliminated by superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which converts these ions into
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or are converted into oxygen through heme degradation.
  Ferric iron reacts with  by Haber-Weiss reaction to generate highly reactive hydroxyl
  radical (HO•) and oxygen molecule. H2O2 is further reduced to water by the consumption
  of NADPH by glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRX2); NADPH is produced
  by the pentose phosphate pathway. FPN1 exports cellular labile iron to prevent ROS
  production.
