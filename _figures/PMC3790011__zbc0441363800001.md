caption: Mobilization of TAG for phospholipid synthesis. The figure shows an abbreviated
  pathway for the mobilization of TAG for phospholipid synthesis when fatty acid synthesis
  is blocked with cerulenin. The metabolism of PA and DAG, as catalyzed by Dgk1p DAG
  kinase and Pah1p PA phosphatase, is highlighted by gray shading. FA, fatty acid;
  Gro-3-P, glycerol 3-phosphate; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; CL,
  cardiolipin; Cho, choline; Etn, ethanolamine.
