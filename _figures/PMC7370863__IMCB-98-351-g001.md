caption: 'Vγ9/Vδ2 T‐cell response to microbial antigens and self‐phosphoantigens—the
  little things that give it away. BTN2A1 binds directly to the Vγ9 chain of the γδ
  TCR, possibly as homodimer, while also interacting closely with BTN3A1, which may
  additionally form homodimers and/or associate with BTN3A2 or BTN3A3. Whether these
  contacts occur simultaneously, or involve sequential interactions at another time,
  another place remains to be resolved as indicated by the question marks in the figure.
  In particular, the role of BTN2A2 is unclear at present. Phosphoantigens may reach
  the B30.2 domain of BTN3A1 via various pathways: intracellularly upon changes in
  the metabolic flux through the mevalonate pathway, for example, after zoledronate
  treatment, or upon release from pathogens in the cytosol or in phagocytic vesicles.
  Exogenous HMB‐PP and IPP may be shuttled directly into the cytosol, or be taken
  up by pinocytosis or endocytosis. Phosphoantigen binding to BTN3A1 may take place
  in the cell surface membrane or, far away so close, in a putative loading compartment
  inside the cell, and may be aided by other BTN3 isoforms and cofactors. Of note,
  baseline responses to BTN2A1 in the absence of phosphoantigens are still detectable,
  and the precise ligand specificity of the CDR3 regions of the Vγ9/Vδ2 TCR remains
  unknown. BTN2A1, butyrophilin 2A1; HMB‐PP, (E)‐4‐hydroxy‐3‐methyl‐but‐2‐enyl pyrophosphate;
  Ig, immunoglobulin; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; TCR, T‐cell receptor.'
