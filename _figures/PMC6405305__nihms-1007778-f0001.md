caption: TGFβ mediated EMT drives the transcription factors SNAIL1 and TWIST to induce
  the first layer of the core regulatory network. ZEB1 is then induced by SNAIL1 and
  TWIST, which jointly leads to loss of E-cadherin expression, increased expression
  of N-cadherin (mesenchymal marker), and an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs), which promote invasiveness and metastasis. MicroRNAs act to repress these
  transcription factors for preventing EMT, which are themselves repressed by SNAIL1
  and ZEB1. The MAP Kinase pathway, mediated by tyrosine receptor kinases (TRK), interacts
  with the core network to indirectly increase SNAIL1 expression. This pathway also
  participates in a feedback loop with BACH1 and RKIP. Circles represent proteins
  and transcription factors. MicroRNAs are indicated by stem-loops. Connecting edges
  between intermediates indicate co-facilitation of an interaction while dashed interactions
  are composed of multiple sequential interactions. The MAPK pathway is designated
  by the dashed box in the cytoplasm.
