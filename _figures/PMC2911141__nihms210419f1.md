caption: Arsenic signaling. Arsenate [As(V)] may enter the cell through phosphate
  anti-transporters located at the cell membrane, which normally transport phosphate
  into the cell and hydroxide out of the cell. Arsenite [As(III)] may enter the cell
  via cell diffusion or through aquaporin transporters (AQP9) located the cell membrane.
  There is evidence that AQP9 may transport arsenite out of the cell. At physiological
  pH arsenate is reduced to arsenite, which may undergo a Fenton reaction and produce
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may interact with NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)
  which would then cause Nrf2 to disassociate from the Keap1-Cul3 complex and translocate
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to a small MAF protein and to the antioxidant
  response element (ARE) located at the promoter region of phase II and antioxidant
  genes, resulting in the transcription of anti-oxidant enzymes such as NQO1, GST,
  and HO-1. Arsenite activates the G-protein-coupled receptor, S1P1. Activation of
  the S1P1 receptor has been shown to activate the Ras-Raf pathway leading to cell
  proliferation and survival
