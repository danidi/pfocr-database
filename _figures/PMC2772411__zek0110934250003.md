caption: Proposed cellular response mechanism for S. cerevisiae to withstand extracellular
  low-pH conditions. Low-pH extracellular conditions activate the CWI pathway via
  the cell stress sensor Mid2. The activated signal transduction cascade leads to
  stimulation of the MAPK module. A potential lateral cross talk event with Rgd1 is
  suggested. There is also potentially an alternative mechanism by which the signal
  is mediated from the Mid2 sensor to Slt2/Mpk1, which is PKC pathway independent.
  Broken lines indicate potential signal transduction events.
