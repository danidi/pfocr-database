caption: Subcellular compartmentalization of the Fe-S cluster and Moco assembly processes.
  Iron and sulfur from cysteine are assembled on IscU in a process that requires electrons
  provided by ferredoxins (Fdx1, Fdx2, which are themselves Fe-S proteins). Chaperones
  and Grx5 are required for transfer of the Fe-S cluster to further scaffold proteins.
  The Drosophila homologs were identified by Blast searches, proposed names for the
  gene products (in white boxes) were based on the corresponding nomenclature in humans,
  current Flybase annotations are shown in blue font. Our own results (Marelja, )
  confirm that the Drosophila genes CG12264 and CG3717 are the homologs of the human
  genes NFS1 and ISD11, respectively. Multiple Fe-S enzymes are present in mitochondria,
  cytosol, and nucleus, but so far none have been reported in the secretory pathway.
  All known components of the CIA pathway are conserved in Drosophila, but the first
  steps of CIA remain to be elucidated. Moco biosynthesis initiates in the mitochondria
  with the Fe-S protein Mocs1 and continues in the cytosol with Mocs2, Mocs3, and
  Cinnamon producing Moco used in Suox. Maroon-like sulfurates Moco for Xdh and Aox.
  Mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 (yellow box)
  provide sulfide to Fe-S cluster and Moco biosynthesis, respectively.
