caption: GlcNAc metabolic pathways in Candida albicans. Catabolic proteins are indicated
  in red and anabolic proteins are indicated in green. Arrows indicate the direction
  of the biochemical activity. GlcNAc is transported into the cell by Ngt1 and then
  phosphorylated by Hxk1. It can then be converted into fructose-6-PO4 and metabolized.
  Alternatively, GlcNAc-6-PO4 can enter the anabolic pathway and be converted into
  UDP-GlcNAc, a key building block of cell wall chitin, GPI-anchors on proteins, and
  N-glycosylation of proteins. Note that cells only synthesize GlcNAc-6-PO4 so the
  presence of non-phosphorylated GlcNAc can act as a unique signal for the presence
  of exogenous GlcNAc.
