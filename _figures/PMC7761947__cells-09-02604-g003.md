caption: Signaling mechanisms for TRPM2 and TRPM8 activation. (a) NAD+ and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), including H2O2, accumulate during inflammation and tissue
  damage may trigger TRPM2. NAD+ may be converted to ADPR and cADPR. ROS can also
  cross the plasma membrane and mobilize ADPR from mitochondria and both ROS and cADPR
  can synergize with ADPR to activate TRPM2. Additionally, ADPR is generated from
  NAD+ via poly-ADPR during ROS-induced damage through the activation of PARP (poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase)-ADPR-dependent mechanisms in inflammatory cells. Free cytosolic ADPR
  can act on the NUDT9-H of TRPM2 channels, enabling Ca2+ influx across the plasma
  membrane and/or release of intracellular Ca2+, raising the Ca2+ concentration in
  the cytosol. On the other hand, ROS induces cytokine production (pro-inflammatory
  response), which may alter intracellular calcium levels. A Ca2+ increase will activate
  different physiological processes including gene expression through Ca2+-dependent
  signaling pathways such as apoptosis, cell migration and cytoskeleton remodeling.
  Moreover, TRPM2 may detect increased temperatures to prevent overheating, limiting
  the fever response. (b) Cold temperature, menthol or icilin can stimulate the activity
  of the TRPM8 ion channels. Upon activation, the TRPM8 channel changes conformation
  and permits extracellular Ca2+ to flow through it across membranes. This results
  in the activation of Ca2+-sensitive PLC and the hydrolysis of PIP2, which produces
  inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) that causes the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular
  stores and generates diacylglycerol (DAG). The elevated Ca2+ level or DAG can activate
  protein kinase C (PKC), which, in turn, activates RAF in the ERK pathway. Therefore,
  transcriptional activation of genes stimulates cellular proliferation, survival
  and invasion, which contribute to cancer growth and metastasis. Created with BioRender.com.
