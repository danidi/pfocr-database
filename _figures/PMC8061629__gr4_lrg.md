caption: Proposed model of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein induced adventitial fibroblast
  inflammation, thrombosis, and diabetes progression. SARS-CoV-2 that has entered
  the vasculature can localize to the endothelium via gC1qR or transmigrate into the
  sub-endothelial space where viral structural proteins (Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane
  and/or Envelope Proteins) can interact with adventitial fibroblast gC1qR. The interaction
  of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins with fibroblast gC1qR may activate internal signal
  transduction pathways (such as the MAPK pathway), which can lead to the enhanced
  expression or activation of GLUT-4, RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products),
  tissue factor, ICAM-1, and gC1qR's high molecular weight kininogen (HK) binding
  site. As each of these receptors interact with their specific ligands, vascular
  responses such as hypoglycemia, chronic inflammation, edema, coagulation, and thrombosis
  may be observed or promoted leading to vascular dysfunction. Further, each of these
  receptors and their heightened responses have been implicated in vascular disease
  progression. Importantly, these vascular disease responses have been shown to be
  heightened during COVID-19 progression, thus this figure proposes a possible mechanism
  to link SARS-CoV-2 infection and vascular disease progression.
