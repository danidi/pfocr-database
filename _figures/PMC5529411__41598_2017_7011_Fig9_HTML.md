caption: 'Schematic presentation of the proposed model: Role of protein farnesylation
  in burn-induced metabolic derangements. Our data indicate that protein farnesylation
  causes and/or exacerbates activation of the HIF-1α pathway and mTORC1, mitochondrial
  dysfunction, and ER stress, all of which contribute in concert to burn-induced muscle
  metabolic derangements, including insulin resistance and increases in lactate production
  and protein breakdown. Farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitor (FTI) prevents burn-induced
  metabolic derangements by inhibiting or mitigating the impact of burn injury on
  HIF-1α, mTORC1, mitochondria, and ER stress in mouse skeletal muscle.'
