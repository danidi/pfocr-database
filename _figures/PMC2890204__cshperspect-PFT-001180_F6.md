caption: Existence of two branches in the p53 pathway allows pharmacological dissection
  of different p53 activities. By selective blocking of the mitochondrial branch of
  the pathway (by PFTμ) can protect from lethal hematopoietic radiation syndrome without
  affecting transactivation-mediated functions of p53 (growth arrest at cell cycle
  checkpoints, DNA repair, etc.), thus preserving tissue protective functions of p53.
