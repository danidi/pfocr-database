caption: MDM2-p53 signaling pathway; negative feedback loop between p53 and the MDM2
  protein in cell cycle regulation. (A) In the absence of stress, MDM2 protein binds
  to p53, keeping it at a low level via ubiquitination. (B) Under stress, p53 is rapidly
  stabilized by the breaking of the MDM2/p53 complex, preventing p53 degradation.
  (C) Any MDM2 gene mutation inhibits p53 stabilization under stress, making normal
  cells more susceptible to oncogenesis.
