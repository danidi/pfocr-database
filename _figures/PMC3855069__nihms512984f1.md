caption: A)Putoczki et al. study demonstrates the dominant importance of IL-11-gp130
  signaling in models of CAC, CRC and GC. When models with the wild type gp130 are
  used, both IL-6 and IL-11 are required for tumor development. When models with the
  gp130Y757F mutant are used (indicated with a ‘red star’), the tumorigenesis is solely
  dependent on IL-11. IL-11-gp130 signaling is required for enhanced cell proliferation
  and resistance to apoptosis.B)Although STAT3 pathway is important to mediate effects
  of IL-11 signaling, gp130 is known to also regulate the mTORC1 pathway and the Ras/ERK
  pathway. The contribution of the mTORC1 pathway in GC and in CAC has been previously
  demonstrated, IL-6 and IL-11 mostly activate an overlapping set of genes in cancer,
  with only a few of them being more specific for IL-6 or for IL-11.
