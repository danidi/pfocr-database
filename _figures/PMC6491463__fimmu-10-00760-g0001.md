caption: 'A schematic representation of the purinome in the MM environment under bone
  marrow niche metabolic reprogramming. Unlike normal cells, tumor cells (i.e., MM)
  utilize glycolysis instead of OXPHOS for metabolic reprogramming: most of the resulting
  pyruvate is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) to lactic acid simultaneously
  producing protons (H+). The efflux of lactic acid and H+ induces lactic acidosis
  generating an acidic TME (pH < 6.5). Cytoplasmic ATP, cAMP, and NAD+ actively secreted
  across nucleotide transporters (e.g., ABC transporter, Pannexin/Connexin channels,
  MRP4) or passively after cell lysis, are metabolized in the hypoxic acidic BM niche
  to ADO. The purinome (e.g., complex network of nucleotidic substrates, ectonucleotidases,
  signaling by-products, and purinergic receptors) operating in the BM niche exploit
  the classical pathway (CD39/CD73) for ATP substrate and the (CD38/CD203a/CD73) pathway
  for NAD+, flanked by an alternative (PDE/CD73) pathway that converts cAMP to AMP
  for generating the immunosuppressive ADO. Generated ADO binds to P1 purinergic ADO
  receptors (ADOR) and activates adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the formation of
  the intracellular second messenger cAMP. Eventually, ADO can also be inactivated
  at the cell surface by an ADA/CD26 complex that converts it into inosine (INO) or
  internalized by nucleoside transporters. The extracellular ATP breakdown follows
  under physiological conditions the classical ATP/ADP/AMP/ADO adenosinergic pathway.
  However, the presence of high ATP concentration in the TME lead AMP to be converted
  by AMP deaminase (AMPD) into inosine monophosphate (IMP), which in turn is dephosphorylated
  by 5′-NT/CD73 into INO.'
