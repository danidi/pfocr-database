caption: Model for the regulation of gene expression by the Wg pathway. See text for
  details. TF indicates a transcription factor that requires Wingless signaling for
  access to its binding site (TFBS). BTM indicates components of the basal transcriptional
  machinery.
pmcid: PMC317146
papertitle: Osa-containing Brahma chromatin remodeling complexes are required for
  the repression of Wingless target genes.
