caption: This scheme depicts pathways related to reported perturbations in cytosolic
  and mitochondrial NADH accumulation, disrupted citric acid cycle (CAC), fatty acid
  β-oxidation, and amino acid metabolism, with a specific emphasis on those linked
  to α-hydroxybutyrate formation. Metabolites whose levels increased are indicated
  in red and with an upward arrow; those whose levels decreased are indicated in green
  and with a downward arrow. Metabolites whose levels did not change significantly
  are indicated in black with a sideways arrow. Those metabolites that were not measured
  are indicated in black (with no arrow). See also  for an overview of analytes measured
  in the study and  for raw data and p values.
