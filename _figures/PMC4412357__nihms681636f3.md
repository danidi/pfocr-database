caption: A proposed model for explaining the role of PGRN in the musculoskeletal system.
  PGRN plays a chondroprotective role in the metabolic cascade of cartilage degradation,
  promotes chondrocyte proliferation, via binding to TNFR2 receptor binding which
  acts as a downstream mediator of BMP-2 signaling and triggers osteoblastogenesis
  and bone regeneration. In cartilage, PGRN exhibits a particular affinity for the
  TNFR2 receptor, binds via the F-A-C domain and activates ERK 1/2 signaling stimulating
  chondrocyte function and proliferation. TNFR 1 binding to PGRN’s F-A-C domain prevents
  the activation of the NF-KB pathway by TNFα assisting in the chondro-protective
  process, thus, inhibiting the degradation of COMP by ADAMTS-7. The positive biofeedback
  loop between TNFa and ADAMTS 7 is indicated in the figure, and PGRN directly tampers
  with this biofeedback mechanism. In bone metabolism, TNFR2 receptors are of particular
  importance, where PGRN/TNFR interaction may mediate BMP-2 induction of de-novo osteogenesis.
