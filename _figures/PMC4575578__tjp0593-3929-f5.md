caption: 'Model: contractile activation of venous smooth muscle alters engagement
  of the cell–matrix adhesion via cortical actin switch and ERK activation is facilitated
  by SrcA, diagrammatic view of unstimulated cell showing that the non-muscle cortical
  actin cytoskeleton containing the FAs is disengaged from a population of the contractile
  filaments. B, agonist (PE) activation promotes cortical non-muscle actin polymerization
  which increases the engagement (the ‘actin switch’) of the non-muscle cortical cytoskeleton
  with the contractile filaments. Conversely, CytoD inhibits agonist-induced cortical
  actin polymerization and connections to the contractile filaments. Agonist activation
  also activates Src, facilitating downstream signalling to ERK and caldesmon (CaD)
  phosphorylation, which enhances agonist-induced contractility and tissue stiffness
  due to crossbridge attachment. This pathway is inhibited by the Src inhibitor PP2.
