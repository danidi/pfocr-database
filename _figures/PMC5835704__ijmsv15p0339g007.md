caption: Illustration of CLDN3 signaling in cells. CLDN3 is a tetraspanin transmembrane
  protein with both the N- and C-terminal domains oriented toward the cytoplasm. The
  two extracellular loop (EL) domains are shown across the cell membrane. CLDN3 combines
  with the PDZ-binding motif of ZO-1/ZO-2 through the “COOH-YV” sequence. CLDN3 is
  linked via the scaffolding ZO-1 to proteins of the cytoskeleton such as actin. ZO-1
  could connect with ZO-2 through other PDZ-binding motifs.
