caption: Cellular actions of E2 in POMC neurons. Schematic overview of the E2-mediated
  modulation of Gαi,o-coupled (μ-opioid and GABAB) receptors via a membrane-associated
  receptor (mER) in hypothalamic POMC neurons. E2 binds to a mER that is Gαq-coupled
  to activate phospholipase C (PLC) and catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane-bound
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). Calcium is released from intracellular stores (endoplasmic
  reticulum) by IP3, and DAG activates PKCδ. Through phosphorylation, adenylyl cyclase
  VII (AC VII) activity is up-regulated by PKC. The generation of cAMP activates protein
  kinase A (PKA), which can uncouple μ-opioid (μ) and GABAB receptors from their signaling
  pathway through phosphorylation of a downstream effector molecule (eg, G protein-coupled,
  inwardly rectifying K+, GIRK, channels). PKA can also potentially phosphorylate
  other channels (eg, canonical transient receptor potential [TRPC] channels) to alter
  their function (data not shown). In addition, the membrane-initiated E2 signaling
  through PKA can phosphorylate cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB), which
  can alter gene transcription through its interaction with the cAMP response element
  (CRE). Therefore, the rapid membrane-initiated signaling can alter gene expression
  in an ERE-independent fashion.
