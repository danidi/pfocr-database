caption: An oversimplified cell-cycling scenario is shown that envisions the TSPyV
  LT-antigen involvement in regulation of pRB pathway activity. In a normal physiological
  condition, hypophosphorylated pRB is complexed with transcription factor E2F during
  early G1 (rest) phase of the cell cycle. When pRB is hyperphosphorylated at specific
  residues by Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) coupled to Cyclin-D1, E2F is released
  that activates expression of growth stimulatory genes needed for the cells to enter
  the S (DNA synthesis) phase. pRB phosphorylation is under tight regulation of p16ink4a
  and p21waf. Hypothetically, through its conserved LXCXE motif TSPyV LT-antigen interacts
  with pRB/E2F complex to dissociate these proteins via pRB hyperphosphorylation,
  resulting into S phase entry and subsequent increased expression of p16ink4a and
  p21waf as a negative cell cycling feedback (red arrows).
