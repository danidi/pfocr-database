caption: DSB repair pathways and SUMO. (A) HR repairs DSBs using genetic information
  that is retrieved from sister chromatid . When a DSB occurs in one of two sister
  chromatids, the ends of the DSB are recognized by Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex
  in yeast (or Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex in mammals). To facilitate strand invasion
  into homologous sequences, the ends of the DSB are resected, which results in the
  formation of 3′ single stranded DNA overhangs. The 3′ ssDNA overhangs nucleate the
  formation of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament, which has the ability to invade the
  homologous DNA duplex. The resolution of the joint molecule completes this error-free
  repair event. The Smc5/Smc6 complex, which binds a SUMO E3 ligase Mms21, is required
  for sister chromatid exchange in both yeast  and man . (B) When DNA replication
  forks encounter a damaged base (shown as a circle), it often leads to the collapse
  of replication forks, resulting in a one-end DSB. This collapsed replication fork
  can be repaired by template switch mediated by strand invasion. The template switch
  pathway is regulated by polyubiquitylation of sliding clamp PCNA at K164 by Rad5
  (ubiquitin E2 conjugase) and Ubc13/Mms2 (E3 ligase) . Resolution of joint molecule
  requires Smc5/Sm6 and Mms21 SUMO E3 ligase . Alternatively, break induced replication
  (BIR) can be initiated by replication fork collapse or sudden shortening of telomeres.
  BIR involves the invasion of the broken end into the donor duplex, followed by DNA
  synthesis from the site of strand invasion to the end of the chromosome. (C) Sumoylation
  of PCNA mediated by E3 ligase Siz1 was observed during an unperturbed replication
  and was shown to recruit the anti-recombinogenic helicase Srs2 , , thereby suppressing
  inapproprate recombination between newly synthesized sister chromatids.
