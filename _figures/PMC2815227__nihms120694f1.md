caption: In addition to the GnRH receptor, RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from cultured
  GT1-7 neurons revealed the expression of mRNA for 5-HT2 Gq-coupled receptors, Gs-coupled
  5- HT4 and 5-HT-7 receptors and 5-HT1A Gi-coupled receptors. In electrophysiological
  studies, activation of 5-HT2 receptors in hypothalamic GnRH neurons with the specific
  receptor agonist significantly increased the frequency of AP firing. This was associated
  with membrane depolarization, increased [Ca2+]i, and transient stimulation of GnRH
  secretion. The spontaneous electrical activity of hypothalamic GnRH neurons also
  increased during treatment with a 5-HT4 receptor agonist. The increase in spontaneous
  AP firing was associated with increased bursting activity and the appearance of
  lower-amplitude broad APs. Selective activation of 5-HT4 receptors in GT1-7 neurons
  increased cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner, and caused a robust and sustained
  increase in GnRH secretion during perifusion studies. In contrast, treatment of
  identified hypothalamic GnRH neurons with a 5-HT1A receptor agonist caused pronounced
  inhibition of spontaneous AP firing. In GT1-7 neurons, treatment with the selective
  5-HT1A receptor agonist activated the Gi-mediated AC/cAMP-inhibitory signaling pathway.
  This response was prevented by PTX, consistent with coupling to an inhibitory Gi
  protein. The resulting decrease in cAMP production was associated with marked inhibition
  of pulsatile GnRH release. VSCC, voltage-sensitive calcium channels; ACI, calcium-dependent
  adenylyl cyclase type I; CNG, cyclic nucleotide gated channels; GIRK, G protein-activated
  inwardly rectifying potassium channels. Green and red lines indicate stimulatory
  and inhibitory actions, respectively.
