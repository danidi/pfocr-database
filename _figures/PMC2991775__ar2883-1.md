caption: Pathways leading to the type I interferon production. Among the family of
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR3, TLR4, TLR7/8 and TLR9 are known to induce production
  of type I interferons in various cells. Surface TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS) from bacterial cell walls and trasmit the signal downstream via MyD88-dependent
  or MyD88-independent pathways resulting in phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear
  translocation of IRF5 and IRF3, and activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathways. Intracellular TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9 residing in the endosomes
  are activated by viral double-stranded (ds)RNA, single-stranded RNA and unmethylated
  dsDNA, respectively. TLR3 signals via adaptor TRIF and activates IRF3, NF-κB and
  MAPK pathways. TLR7/8 and TLR9 transmit the signal via the adaptor molecule MyD88.
  The intracellular form of osteopontin 1 (SPP1) binds to MyD88 upon ligation of TLR9
  with unmethylated CpG oligonucleotides and promotes induction of IFNα genes in mouse
  plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). TLR7 and TLR9 are the only receptors expressed
  in pDCs, while other cells contain other TLRs as well. Detection of nucleic acids
  by TLRs in intracellular endosomes prevents immune responses to the host self-DNA.
  Normally, nucleic acids released by dying necrotic or apoptotic cells undergoing
  rapid degradation by nucleases, DNaseI and DNaseIII (TREX1), while bacterial or
  viral nucleic acids are protected by the cell wall or viral capsid and could be
  detected by TLRs only after penetrating the cell. Breach of tolerance to self-DNA
  and activation of pDCs could happen if self-DNA remains undegraded due to defective
  function of the nucleases and meet endosomal TLR9. Cationic antimicrobial peptide
  LL37 and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) released by damaged or infected
  cells, mainly keratinocytes and neutrophils, bind DNA making it resistant to degradation
  and facilitate endocytosis of DNA through the lipid rafts and receptor for advanced
  glycation end-products (RAGE), delivering it to TLR9. DNA/DNA-protein aggregates
  could be recognized by anti-DNA/anti-RNA-binding proteins (anti-RNP) antibodies
  produced by the autoreactive B cells. Binding of these immune complexes to the low-affinity
  Fcγ receptors II leads to their internalization and translocation to the endosomes
  containing TLR9. Viral DNAs residing in the cytoplasm could be detected by two cytoplasmic
  DNA sensors, DNA-dependent activator of interferon regulatory factors (DAI) and
  absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), which trigger induction of type I interferon genes
  through TBK1-mediated and IRF3-mediated signalling. AIM2 also activates caspases
  1 and 3 by recruiting adaptor ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CARD) and forming an inflammasome that promotes release of IL-1β and IL-18. Two
  RNA helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) and melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5 (MDA-5), detect viral RNAs in the cytoplasm. Activated RIG-1 and MDA-5 interact
  with adaptor protein MAVS anchored by its C-terminal domain to a mitochondrion.
  This interaction triggers signalling through TRAF3 and TRAF6 adaptors and results
  in activation of IRF3, IRF7 and NF-κB pathway. Autophagosomes can engulf the replicating
  viral RNAs and, after fusion with endosomes, present it to the TLR7/8. Viral RNAs
  can induce a common antiviral defence mechanism aimed at blocking viral replication
  through total inhibition of cellular transcription and translation. Thus, dsRNAs
  activate 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) producing 2',5'-oligoadenylates, which
  in turn activate the latent nuclease RNase L, resulting in the degradation of all
  cytoplasmic RNAs. Another pathway targets protein synthesis machinery by protein
  kinase dsRNA-dependent serine-threonine kinase (PKR), which inactivates the alpha
  subunit of initiation factor eIF2, resulting in rapid inhibition of protein translation.
  The latter two pathways may induce apoptosis of the infected cell. Yellow stars,
  genes with strong evidence for association with autoimmune diseases; black stars,
  genes with inconsistent association. ISG, interferon stimulated genes; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase.
