caption: Estrogen promotes actin polymerization in CA1 dendritic spines. (A) Latrunculin
  (500nM) effectively blocked both E2-induced increases in synaptic transmission in
  the control pathway (white circle) and theta burst-induced LTP in the experimental
  pathway (dark circle). Following a 1hr washout period, fEPSP responses to E2 was
  restored. (B) Infusions of latrunculin blocked, in a reversible manner, the increase
  in baseline synaptic responses produced by the selective ERβ agonist, WAY200070
  (WAY; 100nM). Inset, representative traces collected during treatments with latrunculin,
  WAY, and both. Scale 1mV/5ms. (C) Top two panels compare phalloidin labeling in
  CA1 stratum radiatum in slices treated with 1nM E2 or vehicle (Scale bar = 5µm).
  E2 treatment increases spine-like profiles (arrows) relative to vehicle. Bottom
  two panels illustrate the effect of latrunculin (500nM) alone and in combination
  with E2-induced baseline phalloidin labeling. (D) The group mean (±SEM) number of
  phalloidin-labeled spines in area CA1b was significantly greater in slices treated
  with E2 compared to vehicle controls (*p < 0.001), and that latrunculin blocks E2-induced
  increases in phalloidin labeling. (E) Cumulative frequency distribution of phalloidin-labeling
  intensities in CA1b in control versus E2-treated slices; E2 caused a significant
  rightward shift in the distribution curve relative to controls (*p < 0.001). This
  effect was blocked by latrunculin. Modified from [].
