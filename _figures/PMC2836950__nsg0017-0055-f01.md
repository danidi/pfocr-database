caption: 'The G12/13-mediated signaling pathway interacts with diverse proteins at
  various levels. Upon ligand binding, GPCRs catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP
  on Gα 13 subunits resulting in activation of the Gα subunit and release of Gβγ.
  Both Gα-GTP and free Gβγ interact with diverse downstream effectors. LARG is an
  effector for Gα13, which is a GEF for the monomeric GTPase RhoA. Upon binding of
  Gα13-GTP to LARG, the DH/PH domains activate RhoA by facilitating the exchange of
  GDP for GTP. LARG, in turn, stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα13 through
  its N-terminal RH domain. Gα-GDP dissociates from effectors and reassociates with
  Gβγ to terminate the signal. Thus, regulation of the G protein cycle of activation
  and deactivation profoundly affects the cellular response. The amplitude and duration
  of the signal response are determined by the amount of GTPbound Gα subunit. A dotted
  line indicates evidence for direct activation of LARG without activated Gα13. Domains:
  RH = RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) homology; DH = Dbl homology; PH = pleckstrin
  homology; PDZ = PSD-95/SA90-Discs-large-ZO-1. See the text for details.'
