caption: A schematic pathway for O-antigen synthesis in S. enterica group B1. Step
  1, transfer by initial transferase WbaP of galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-P) to Und-P
  to give Und-PP-linked Gal, followed by glycosyltransferases WbaN, WbaU, and WbaV
  that build the remainder of the O unit sequentially; step 2, Wzx translocation of
  the O unit across the membrane; step 3, polymerization at the reducing end of a
  growing Und-PP-linked O-unit polymer by Wzy, in effect extending the chain length
  by one for each cycle, with a modal chain length distribution for O antigen achieved
  by interaction between Wzy and Wzz; step 4, ligation catalyzed by WaaL, the reaction
  that incorporates O antigen into LPS.
