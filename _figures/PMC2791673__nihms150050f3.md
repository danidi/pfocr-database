caption: Orally ingested alcohol increase intestinal permeability leading to increased
  levels of LPS in the portal vein. In the liver, LPS binds to TLR4 on Kupffer cells
  to activate NF-κB, and NADPH oxidase, through a MyD88-independent pathway. Release
  of cytokine by Kupffer cells promotes hepatocyte injury through the recruitment
  of neutrophils through direct effects on hepatocytes.
