caption: Distal components of the dorso-ventral, Toll, and Imd signaling  pathways.
  (A) The distal part of the embryonic  dorso-ventral patterning pathway, showing
  the end of the proteolytic  cascade that leads to the cleavage of Spaetzle and intracellular  signaling.
  (B) Established elements of the distal part  of the Toll pathway, where a serpin,
  nec, regulated a  proteolytic cascade leading to the cleavage of Spaetzle. This
  pathway  reuses many of the components seen in embryonic dorso-ventral  patterning,
  and it is induced by infection with Gram-positive bacteria  and fungi. (C) Established
  elements of the Imd pathway,  which is induced by Gram-negative bacteria. At present,
  none of  components in the extracellular cascades are known for this pathway.
