caption: Labeling experiments shed critical light and it appears that at one point
  in the catalytic cycle the chiral ligand might dissociate from the Cu centre to
  cause lowering of e.e. a, Labeling experiments reveal that e.e. variations have
  different origins, depending on the nature of the aryl olefin involved. b, The most
  efficient catalytic cycle entails transition structure vii to afford ix with high
  enantioselectivity. However, a competitive pathway consistent with the experimental
  data involves dislodging the bis-phosphine ligand (iv →×→ xi) and formation of an
  achiral complex (xii) resulting in lower SN2’ selectivity and formation of rac-ix
  (via xiv or xv). c, Spectroscopic analysis (A–C, with L3c) reveals that there is
  considerable amount of free chiral ligand except at the Cu-alkyl stage of the catalytic
  cycle and at certain points competitive addition by an achiral Cu–B(pin) species
  can lead to lower SN2’ and enantioselectivity. Reducing the concentration of the
  alkene thus leads to higher e.e. See the , for details. pin, pinacolato; P, diaryl-phosphine
  ligand; P2, bis-phosphine ligand; R, PO(OEt)2 or CO2Ph; bis-phos., unbound bis-phosphine.
