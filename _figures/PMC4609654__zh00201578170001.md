caption: Schematic representation of the Wnt signaling pathway with selected inhibitors.
  Wnt ligands are palmitoylated by the acyltransferase porcupine in the endoplasmic
  reticulum and transported to the Golgi complex. The transmembrane protein Wntless
  facilitates the subsequent transfer of Wnt ligands to the plasma membrane for secretion.
  β-Catenin, the key effector of Wnt signaling, will be constantly degraded by the
  destruction complex in the absence of Wnt. Casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β (GSK3β) in the complex phosphorylate β-catenin, which is then recognized
  by the E3-ligase β-TrCP for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Upon Wnt
  ligand engagement of the Frizzled and low-density lipoprotein-related protein (LRP)
  receptors, the destruction complex will be inhibited, and the free cytosolic β-catenin
  will be translocated to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, β-catenin binds to the
  T cell factor (TCF) transcription factor together with other coactivators such as
  cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300 to regulate
  Wnt target gene transcription. The membrane-bound E3 ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 are Wnt
  negative feedback targets that will suppress Wnt signaling by removing Frizzled
  receptors from the cell surface and neutralizing the Wnt agonist R-spondin/leucine-rich
  repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor (LGR) complex formation. Mutations
  in different Wnt signaling components (represented with red arrows) are frequently
  observed in colorectal cancers and have been found to cause pathway deregulation
  and tumorigenesis. Inhibitors targeting Wnt signaling at different cellular levels
  of the cascade are summarized in green boxes. LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor;
  IWP, inhibitor of Wnt production; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; TNK, tankyrase;
  DVL, Dishevelled.
