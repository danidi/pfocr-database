caption: Metabolic origins of tocopherol biosynthetic precursors. Model representing
  the biosynthetic pathways, cellular compartments, and membrane transport proteins
  involved in the biosynthesis and transport of tocopherol precursors. Several studies
  suggest that the cytoplasmic MVA pathway might supply prenyl biosynthetic precursors
  such as farnesyl pyrophosphate for the synthesis of plastidic isoprenoids including
  carotenoids, plastoquinol-9, chlorophylls, and tocopherols. Compound names in red
  with an asterisk indicate that the corresponding radiolabeled molecule has been
  detected following feeding with radiolabeled mevalonate (cytoplasmic MVA pathway).
  Compound names topped with three red stars and one black star indicate that three
  quarters of the prenyl side chain of the molecule was radiolabeled following radiolabeled
  MVA feeding, while one quarter remained unlabeled. Biosynthetic enzymes in blue
  indicate that they have been demonstrated to be involved in tocopherol metabolism
  and that their subcellular localization was confirmed. In contrast, enzyme names
  in black have not been demonstrated involved in tocochromanol metabolism yet. Genetic
  and biochemical evidence in Arabidopsis and soybean show that HGA synthesis is localized
  in the cytoplasm. This implies the existence of membrane transport proteins exporting
  tyrosine and potentially HPP from plastids to the cytoplasm, and of transporter(s)
  importing HGA back into plastids. None of the transporters symbolized by gray boxes
  have been identified yet. CoA, coenzyme A; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; E4P,
