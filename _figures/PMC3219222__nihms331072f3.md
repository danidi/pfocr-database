caption: ApoB-48 and apoB-100 flux during constant feeding. Flux (numbers above arrows,
  in mg/kg/day) indicates the amount of apoB through each metabolic pathway. The percentages
  in parentheses indicate the proportions of apoB from the originating compartment
  going through a particular pathway. Because of the nonsteady state of the fluxes
  and pool sizes, the values given are averages over the 9 h study.
