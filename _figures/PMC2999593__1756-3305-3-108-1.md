caption: 'Heme Biosynthetic Pathway. Initiation of heme biosynthesis begins in the
  mitochondria with the condensation of succinyl coenzyme A (CoA) and glycine, catalyzed
  by ALA synthetase (ALA-S), form δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Conserved biosynthetic
  protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) pathway: ALA is catalyzed by ALA dehydratase (ALA-D) in
  the cytoplasm to form porphobilinogen (PBG). Four molecules of PBG are combined
  by PBG deaminase (PBG-D) to form into the cyclic tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane
  (HMB) and converted to Uroporphyrinogen III (Uro''gen III) by Uroporphyrinogen III
  synthase (URO-S). Uro''gen III is converted by Uro''gen III decarboxylase (URO-D)
  to coproorphyrinogen III (Copro''gen III), with the removal of CO2. Subsequent conversion
  of Copro''gen III to Protoporphyrinogen IX (Proto''gen IX) and finally protoporphyrin
  IX (PPIX) occurs in the mitochondria. This is catalyzed by the actions of Coproporphyrinogen
  III Oxidase (CPO) and Protophyrinogen IX Oxidase (PPO) respectively. Finally, ferrous
  iron (Fe2+) is inserted into the cyclic macrocycle through the action of ferrochelatase
  (FC) in the mitochondria.'
