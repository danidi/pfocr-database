caption: Schematic illustration of type I interferon (IFN) gene induction by IFN regulatory
  factors (IRFs) on innate recognition of cytosolic nucleic acids. Type I IFN genes,
  particularly IFN-β, are induced via TIR domain-containing adaptor, including IFN-β
  (TRIF) downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways, and via myeloid differentiation
  primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) downstream of TLR7 and TLR9 signaling pathways.
  Further, the TRIF pathway signals exclusively to IRF3 to induce IFN-β gene expression.
  IRF7 may also be involved for TLR3-, but not for retinoic acid-inducible gene I
  (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR)4-mediated type I IFN gene induction. In the MyD88 pathway,
  IRF1, IRF5, and IRF7 form a complex with MyD88. Among MyD88-bound IRFs, IRF7 is
  critical for the robust induction of type I IFN in plasmacytoid dendritic cells
  (pDCs). IRF5 is partially involved in type I IFN gene induction in pDCs, whereas
  IRF1 is important for expression of type I IFNs in conventional DCs (cDCs). In contrast,
  IRF8 is involved in the expression of type I IFN genes in pDCs, but does not bind
  to MyD88. IRF3 also does not bind to MyD88, but is involved in Listeria monocytogenes–mediated
  type I IFN gene induction in pDCs.
