caption: 'Mechanism of miRNA formation and sorting mechanism for exosomal miRNAs.
  miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as pri-miRNAs, which are processed
  using two cleavage events to produce mature miRNA. The primary cleavage of animal
  pri-miRNA is located in the nucleus and produces miRNA precursors with a length
  of 70 nt and a stem-loop structure, which are referred to as pre-miRNA. The secondary
  cleavage is located in cytoplasm where pre-miRNA is cleaved to mature miRNAs with
  21–23 nt. The cleavages in the maturation process of miRNA are catalyzed by two
  types of RNase III, i.e., Drosha and Dicer, respectively. Then, the mature miRNAs
  incorporate into RISC to form a miRISC complex. Mature miRNAs are sorted into exosomes
  through six mechanisms: (1) the miRNA motif and hnRNPA2B1-dependent pathway, (2)
  nSMase2-dependent pathway, (3) 3''-end of the miRNA sequence-dependent pathway,
  (4) endogenous RNA-mediated pathway, (5) Ago2-dependent pathway, and (6) (YBX1)-dependent
  pathway. pri-miRNA: Primary miRNA transcript; miRISC: miRNA RISC; hnRNPA2B1: Heterogeneous
  nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1; nSMase2: Neutral sphingomyelinase 2; YBX1: Y-box
