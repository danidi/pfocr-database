caption: A model for defective huntingtin-mediated cofilin rod stress response leading
  to activation of TG2. The grey arrow pathway highlights normal huntingtin stress
  response by releasing from the ER, entering the nucleus and binding cofilin–actin
  rods, then exiting the nucleus upon stress relief. With mutant huntingtin present,
  the dashed arrow pathways show a defect in huntingtin stress response, resulting
  in less nuclear activity and persistent rods. Back in the cytoplasm, the black arrow
  pathways highlight elevated calcium due to a defective ER, which results in aberrant
  TG2 activation and cross-linking of cofilin–actin in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.
  Defective actin remodeling critically affects neurons at the level of dendritic
  and synaptic dysfunction, as well as exocytosis activity in peripheral cells.
