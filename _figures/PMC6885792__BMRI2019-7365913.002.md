caption: The role of MYOF in membrane trafficking. These trafficking processes have
  been identified in muscle fibers and other cells. They are also present in cancer
  cells. MYOF is present at the plasma and nucleus membrane as well as intracellular
  vesicle. It is involved in exocytosis, endocytosis, receptor internalization and
  recycling. For example, MYOF mediates endocytosis of transferrin by interacting
  with caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and dynamin-2 (Dyn-2). MYOF also directs vesicles containing
  VEGFR-2 to the plasma membrane to promote its surface expression and prevents it
  from proteasomal degradation. In addition, MYOF is responsible for internalization
  and recycling of receptors like IGF receptor. MYOF depletion redirects IGF receptor
  from recycling to a degradation pathway, which leads to mistrafficking of such receptor
  and disrupts IGF signaling. The secretion of lysosomal enzymes also requires MYOF,
  suggesting that this protein is widely involved in membrane trafficking.
