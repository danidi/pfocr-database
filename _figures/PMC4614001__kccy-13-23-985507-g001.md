caption: 'Proliferation versus arrest. (A) Proliferation: Growth factors (GF) activate
  MAPK and mTOR pathways, driving cell growth (in size) and cell cycle. Cellular growth
  is balanced by cell division. (B) Quiescence: In the absence of GF, cell growth
  and cycle are at rest. (C) Pro-senescent cycle arrest: When the cycle cycle is blocked
  by p21 or p16, the growth promoting pathway (MAPK/mTOR) causes growth in size (hypertrophy).'
