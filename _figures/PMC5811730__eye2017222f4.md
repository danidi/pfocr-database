caption: 'Distinct mechanisms of small-molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies
  for targeting receptor tyrosine kinases in cancer cells. (a). Epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-dependent growth signaling in
  cancer cells. The extracellular region of EGFR consists of four domains, the ligand-binding
  domains (L1 and L2) and the cysteine-rich domains (CR1 and CR2), and the C-terminal
  domain of EGFR contains six tyrosine residues (Y; only two are depicted here for
  simplicity). Following the activation of EGFR by ligand binding or ligand-independent
  dimerization, the Ras–Raf–MEK–MAPK pathway is activated through the growth factor
  receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2)–SOS complex. EGFR-mediated signaling also activates
  the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)– AKT pathway, which contributes to anti-apoptotic
  effects of EGFR activation. In addition, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (Stat) proteins (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5) are also activated. The coordinated effects
  of these EGFR downstream signaling pathways lead to the induction of cellular responses
  including proliferation, differentiation, cell motility, adhesion, and angiogenesis.
  The deregulation of EGFR-mediated signaling in some cancer cells leads to aberrant
  proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and neovascularization. (b) Small-molecule
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib function as ATP analogues and
  inhibit EGFR signaling by competing with ATP binding within the catalytic kinase
  domain of RTKs. As a result, the activation of various downstream signaling pathways
  is blocked. Each TKI has a different selectivity for RTKs, and some are dual- or
  multi-selective, which might provide a therapeutic advantage. (c) By contrast, therapeutic
  monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) bind to the ectodomain of the RTK with high specificity
  (for example, cetuximab binds to the L2 domain of EGFR, and thereby inhibits its
  downstream signaling by triggering receptor internalization and hindering ligand–receptor
  interaction. Unlike small-molecule inhibitors, mAbs also activate Fcγ- receptor-dependent
  phagocytosis or cytolysis by immune-effector cells such as neutrophils, macrophages
  and natural killer cells by inducing complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or
  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. (Reproduced with permission:
