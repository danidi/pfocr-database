caption: Schematic illustration of a proposed model for the different responses of
  early NO production and its effects on the defense response of rice to water stress.
  In the roots of NH4+-supplied rice, the NOS-mediated early NO burst (3 h) significantly
  enhanced plant antioxidant defense by reducing ROS accumulation and enhancing antioxidant
  enzyme activity; the relative lower NO production after 24 h of water stress in
  comparison to NO3−-supplied rice also helped maintaining the redox balance in root
  cells, thus enhancing their drought tolerance. In the roots of NO3−-supplied rice,
  ROS accumulation and oxidative damage induced by 3 h of water stress were significantly
  higher than that in NH4+-supplied rice. High NO accumulation in the NO3−-treated
  roots likely caused the nitrosative stress at 24 h of water stress. A combined effect
  of oxidative and nitrification stresses might have led to the weak resistance to
  water stress in NO3−-supplied rice. NR, nitrate reductase. Red arrows represent
  increase; green arrows represent decrease. Black solid arrows represent defined
  pathways, dotted arrows represent undefined pathway
