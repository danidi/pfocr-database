caption: 'Systemic inflammation contributes to cancer-related fatigue. Cancer and
  its treatments activate leukocytes, resulting in increased expression of the transcription
  factor NF-κB and production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6
  (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Dysregulation
  of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis leads to altered release of cortisol;
  glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) function on leukocytes is also decreased. Inflammation
  in the periphery leads to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) through
  several immune-to-brain communication pathways. Signals from sensory nerves activate
  CNS cells such as microglia to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6,
  TNF-α, and interlukin-1 beta (IL-1β). These inflammatory mediators then impact neurons
  directly or indirectly through altered oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and endothelial
  cell functions. Inflammation in the periphery also decreases the availability of
  precursors, such as tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) required for the synthesis of the
  neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5HT). Deficits
  in serotonin production also occur as tryptophan (Trp) is converted into kynurenine
  from an inflammation-mediated increase in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Kynurenine
  is further metabolized in the brain into neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites such
  as 3-hydroxy kynurenine and quinolinic acid. Dashed lines indicate a disrupted pathway.
