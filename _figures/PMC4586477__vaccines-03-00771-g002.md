caption: 'TAA-specific CD8+ T cells often lack co-stimulation for an immune response
  against tumors. CD28 signaling was reflected in a top canonical pathway predicted
  by genome-wide mRNA expression profiling to trend towards less activation in TAA-specific
  CD8+ T cells from the tumor compared to those in circulation (p-value of overlap
  = 3.2E-4, right-tailed Fisher Exact Test, z-score = −0.816). Many signaling pathways
  overlap between T cell subsets, so it is not surprising that a CD4+ T cell signaling
  pathway was associated with the gene expression of CD8+ T cells used to generate
  the figure above. Differential gene expression corresponding to molecules enriched
  in this pathway are outlined in purple with red fill representing overexpression
  and green fill representing decreased expression in T cells from the tumor relative
  to the periphery, and color intensity corresponds to the extent of expression difference.
  CD28 was predicted to be a key upstream regulator that is less active in TAA-specific
  CD8+ T cells from the tumor (p-value of overlap = 1.3E-5, right-tailed Fisher exact
  test, activation z-score = −0.696). CTLA-4 was also predicted to be an upstream
  regulator of differential gene expression (p-value of overlap = 9.7E-5, right-tailed
  Fisher exact test). Differentially-expressed genes and corresponding fold-changes
  have been previously published and were reanalyzed through the use of QIAGEN’s Ingenuity®Pathway
  Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN, Redwood City, CA, USA, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) []. Both
  direct and indirect relationships were assessed in the Ingenuity knowledge base
  reference set with a confidence threshold of previous experimental observation in
  T cells. Note: The connecting arrow between SHP and T cell activation was altered
  to a line to better reflect inhibition downstream of CTLA-4.'
