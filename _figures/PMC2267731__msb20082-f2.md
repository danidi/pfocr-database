caption: 'BL module: A network visualization of the top 25 scoring genes in BL. Transcription
  factors are shown as circles, whereas other proteins are shown as squares. Protein–protein
  interactions are also shown in beige, protein–DNA interactions are black with an
  arrowhead, and transcription factor-modulated interactions are shown in blue with
  a circular endpoint. Red/green indicates overexpression or underexpression (P<1e−8),
  respectively in BL versus GC cells. There are some notable characteristics of this
  figure. First, all 25 genes form a connected module, which would not occur by chance.
  Second, MYC appears to be a central regulator of this module, as a full 21 out of
  the 25 members are MYC targets. MYC also appears regulated by MYC-associated zinc-finger
  protein (MAZ), which is also not differentially expressed. Third, there are interesting
  sets of genes that emerge, such as SMAD1, which is known to be associated with some
  NHL, and members of the NFAT family, including NFATC3, NFATC4, and NFAT5 (these
  proteins are members of the Wnt-signaling pathway). There also appears to be a protein
  complex of COL1A2, COL6A1 COL6A2, and FN1, which are all upregulated (and members
  of the cell signaling and ECM–receptor interaction pathway). These module diagrams
  can serve as a useful platform for further hypothesis generation and biochemical
  investigation.'
