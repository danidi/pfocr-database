caption: Cyclin D1 interacts with Bax in the LDIR-induced adaptive response. LDIR
  (10 cGy X-ray) induced Cyclin D1 via NF-κB regulation is conjugated with the chaperon
  14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm. Cyclin D1 then interacts and forms a complex with
  Bax in mitochondria of human karotinocytes and skin tissue from whole-body irradiated
  mice (). The NF-κB-Cyclin D1-Bax signaling pathway is critical to the regulation
  of the level of 14-3-3/Cyclin D1 complex in the LDIR adaptive response. Bax, Bcl-2-associated
  X protein; 14-3-3ζ, chaperones. To see this illustration in color, the reader is
