caption: Signal pathways of migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF is induced in response
  to cytokine production and, after its endocytosis, can interact with intracellular
  proteins such as Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (Jab1), thereby down-regulating
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signals and modulating cellular redox homeostasis.
  Extracellular MIF binds to the cell surface protein CD74 (invariant chain Ii). CD74
  lacks a signal-transducing intracellular domain but interacts with the proteoglycan
  CD44, which induce the activation of Src-family kinase and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) pathways to either activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  pathway or initiate the p53-dependent inhibition of apoptosis. MIF also can bind
  and signal through G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors (GPCRs, e.g., CXCR2 and
  CXCR4) alone. Complex formation between CXCR2 and CD74, enabling accessory binding,
  appears to facilitate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation and the formation
  of a GPCR-receptor tyrosine kinases like signaling complex to trigger calcium influx
  and rapid integrin activation.
