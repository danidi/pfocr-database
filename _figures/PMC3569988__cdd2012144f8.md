caption: A model to illustrate the proapoptotic potential of SARM following T-cell
  immune response. Antigen presenting cells (APC) present the epitopes of the foreign
  pathogens to the T cells. Antigen-specific T cells undergo clonal expansion and
  differentiate into effector T cells. These T cells mediate pathogen clearance. Later,
  apoptosis specifically contracts the expanded T cells in a well-orchestrated manner.
  Our influenza infection mouse model demonstrates the proapoptotic function of SARM
  during T-cell contraction. SARM expression is significantly decreased during activation-induced
  T-cell clonal expansion to support proliferation. During T-cell contraction, SARM
  is elevated and it acts proapoptotically via intrinsic pathway. SARM seems to oppose
  the survival signal mediated by ERK phosphorylation, and modulates the levels of
  the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, leading to the loss of mitochondrial integrity via BAX
  BAK and ROS. The release of the mitochondrial content leads to activation of the
  initiator caspase-9 and effector caspase-3. Activated caspases cause apoptosis,
  thereby bringing down the number of T cells. Failure of T-cell contraction may result
  in lymphoproliferative diseases and autoimmunity. Coincidently, the expression of
  proapoptotic SARM is reduced in NK/T lymphoma tissues compared with the healthy
  cells
