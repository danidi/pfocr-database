caption: 'A: In the absence of cocaine, serotonin (5-HT) binding to 5-HT1B receptors
  in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) does not alter basal dopamine (DA) release in
  the nucleus accumbens (NA).B: In the presence of systemic or intra-VTA cocaine,
  5-HT transporters are blocked by cocaine causing an increase in extracellular 5-HT
  in the VTA, and increased stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors on the terminals of GABAergic
  projections from the NA. GABA release from these terminals is decreased in response
  to 5-HT1B receptor stimulation, resulting in a disinhibition of the mesolimbic pathway
  and increased DA release in the NA.'
