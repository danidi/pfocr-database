caption: Schematic representation of a suggested model describing the antidepressant
  mechanism of ARN-3236. Chronic stress significantly promoted the expression of hippocampal
  SIK2, which phosphorylates cytoplasmic CRTC1 and prevents its nuclear translocation,
  leading to decreased CRTC1-CREB binding in the hippocampus. Due to the deficiency
  in CRTC1-CREB supporting, the levels of BDNF biosynthesis as well as its downstream
  signaling cascades (MAPK/ERK, PI3L/AKT and CaMK/CaMKIV pathways) are fully down-regulated,
  resulting in depression. ARN-3236 produces antidepressant-like actions by preventing
  the chronic stress-induced effects on the hippocampal SIK2-CRTC1-CREB-BDNF pathway.
