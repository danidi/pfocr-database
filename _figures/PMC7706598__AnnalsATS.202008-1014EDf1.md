caption: Schematic representation of the different mechanisms that could modify coronavirus
  disease (COVID-19) illness in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
  The renin–angiotensin pathway is dysregulated in PAH with decreased angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and angiotensin (Ang) (–) levels. Severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human cells via binding to ACE-2 receptor, which
  is expressed on various pulmonary cells including type II alveolar cells, macrophages,
  endothelial, smooth muscle cells, and perivascular pericytes. Reduced ACE-2 in PAH
  could impair viral entrance. However, higher angiotensin II levels could lead to
  worse lung injury and inflammation. The immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis
  of PAH with increased perivascular mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and
  T cells and could modulate viral replication and/or the deleterious cytokine response
  induced by SARS-CoV-2. Another important hypothetical mechanism is the role of PAH-targeted
  therapies, mainly endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and the nitric oxide (NO)
  pathway enhancers, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-i), and soluble guanylate
  cyclase stimulators (sGCS). ERAs block the downregulation of ACE-2 by endothelin-1
  (ET-1) and inhibit angiotensin II–induced vasoconstriction and lung injury. PAH-targeted
  therapies may also have antiinflammatory and antithrombotic effects. Inhaled NO
  has been shown to have an antimicrobial effect; however, it is unclear whether other
  therapies that increase signaling along the NO axis have the same effect. Lastly,
  PAH therapies are pulmonary vasodilators and could worsen ventilation–perfusion
  mismatch in COVID-19 lung injury.
