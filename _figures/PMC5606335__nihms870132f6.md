caption: Oxygen-dependent regulation of antioxidant production by HIF1. Under hypoxic
  conditions, HIFs activate the transcription of PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH (red) to increase
  conversion of glucose to serine (serine synthesis pathway); and SHMT2, MTHFD2, and
  MTHFD1L (blue) to increase generation of mitochondrial NADPH (mitochondrial one-carbon
  metabolism), which is required to convert glutathione from oxidized (GSSG) to reduced
  (GSH) form to protect against increased ROS generated by the ETC. Genes encoding
  proteins that generate cytosolic NADPH are either not consistently induced [SHMT1,
  MTHFD1 (purple)] or actively repressed [G6PD (green)] under hypoxic conditions.
  G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; MTHFD, methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase;
  MTHFD1L, MTHFD1-like; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT, phosphoserine
  aminotransferase; PSPH, phosphoserine phosphatase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase.
