caption: Mechanisms of ISG induction. The pathway activated by IFN-α/β is depicted
  on the left side of the diagram, leading to formation of the complex known as ISGF3
  (phosphorylated STATs 1 and 2 plus IRF-9). The route of virus activation of IRF-3
  is shown on the right, leading to a complex containing phosphorylated IRF-3 plus
  CBP. The induction of ISGs is mediated by either complex; in addition, activated
  IRF-3 can induce the IFN-β gene, resulting in the production of IFN-β, which can
  engage the IFN-α/β receptor to activate the pathway leading to the formation of
  ISGF3.
