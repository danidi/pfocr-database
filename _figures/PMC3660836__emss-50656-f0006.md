caption: Model for O-GlcNAcylation in FGF signaling. The model shows the requirement
  of protein O-GlcNAcylation for Htl-dependent mesoderm spreading mediated by the
  Pebble (Pbl)–Rac pathway and mesoderm differentiation mediated by MAPK activation.
  The HBP converts glucose (blue circle) into UDP-GlcNAc (blue squares). With normal
  amounts of UDP-GlcNAc, OGT transfers O-GlcNAc to the adaptor protein Dof. O-GlcNAcylated
  Dof may be phosphorylated (red circles) upon activation of Htl by FGF8-like ligands
  and recruits effector proteins, such as the phosphatase Corkscrew (Csw), to trigger
  FGF-dependent MAPK activation and cell shape changes. This model does not exclude
  the possibility that OGT might also O-GlcNAcylate yet unknown protein(s) (X), which
  may be indirectly required for FGF signaling (transparent brown arrow).
