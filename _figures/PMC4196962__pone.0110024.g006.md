caption: (A) Model of SHH signaling pathway in brain capillary endothelial cells.
  Secreted SHH binds and inactivates its receptor Patched-1, which allowed Smoothened
  to activate the transcription factor Gli-1. Gli-1 upregulates tight junction proteins
  and enhances BBB integrity. (B) Model of BBB breakdown by IL-1β. Under healthy conditions
  (left), astrocytes secrete SHH to upregulate tight junction proteins in endothelial
  cells and maintain BBB integrity. Under pathologic conditions (right), pathogenic
  stimuli such as amyloid β, DAMPs, or cytokines induce microglia to release IL-1β.
  IL-1β suppresses astrocytic SHH production, leading to downregulation of tight junction
  proteins in endothelial cells and disintegrity of the BBB. IL-1β also activates
  astrocytes to release pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL2, CCL2, and CCL20.
  These chemokines induce migration of immune cells, thereby worsening BBB disruption
  and neuroinflammation. Neut, neutrophils; Mo, monocytes; MΦ, macrophage; DC, dendritic
  cells; T, T cells.
