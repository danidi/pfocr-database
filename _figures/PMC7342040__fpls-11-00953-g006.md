caption: Model proposed to explain the molecular mechanism of action of an enzymatically
  hydrolyzed animal protein-based biostimulant (Pepton). (A) Experiment 1, plants
  with large roots exposed to nutrient deficiency, (B) Experiment 2, plants with small
  roots exposed to suboptimal temperatures. Note that the hormonal pathway (salicylic
  acid increases) appeared to play a major role in experiment 1 than in experiment
  2. (C) Integrated model proposed to explain the increased salicylic acid content.
  Note that an increased Phe availability provided by Pepton may stimulate diversion
  of the salicylic acid pathway through PAL instead of ICS. Orange arrows represent
  biosynthetic pathway steps, green and red arrows represent positive or negative
  relationships, respectively. Blue arrow represents an increase on the content of
  aromatic amino acids. Phe, phenylalanine; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; ICS,
  isochorismate synthase; CM, chorismate mutase.
