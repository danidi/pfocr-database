caption: Ischaemia–reperfusion injury activates the unfolded protein response to preserve
  cardiac functionROS accumulation, depletion of SR Ca2+ stores, and metabolic collapse
  together increase the abundance of unfolded proteins inside the ER lumen, activating
  the UPR to restore proteostasis. Activation of the IRE1α–Xbp1s branch of the UPR
  leads to GFAT expression, a key rate-limiting enzyme within the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP). Activation of the HBP promotes protein O-GlcNAcylation, which is
  cardioprotective in I–R injury.
