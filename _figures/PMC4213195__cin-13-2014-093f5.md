caption: A schematic model of Wnt- and SHH pathways working interdependently in GBM
  based upon observations in this study. As observed from PPI network and betweenness
  centrality measures, CSNK1A1 molecule is directly connected to both Gli2 in SHH
  pathway and CTNNB1 in Wnt pathway, all these three molecules having high betweenness
  centrality. These are considered as plausible drug targets based on this study and
  denoted as diamond-shaped nodes. CSNK1A1 is indirectly connected to SMO in SHH pathway.
  The arrows indicate that the overexpression of CSNK1A1 leads to phosphorylation
  of CTNNB1 and SMO (indicated by “P” in the nodes), thereby inactivating these two
  pathways, for which evidence is present in literature. However, the cross-talk between
  CSNK1A1 and Gli2 is not available to the best of knowledge, and therefore, needs
  to be studied further. It is surmised that since Wnt and SHH pathways appear to
  be aberrantly activated in GBMs in this study, despite upregulation and significant
  differential gene expression of CSNK1A1 in tumors, Gli2 molecule may simply be acting
  as an antagonist of CSNK1A1. It may diminish the effect of CSNK1A1 on CTNNB1 and
  SMO, or inhibit CSNK1A1 altogether, leading to aberrant activation of these pathways.
