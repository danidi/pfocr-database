caption: Extracellular L-Phenylalanine (L-Phe) signalling pathway mediated by the
  Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5 (SPS) sensor system. When L-Phe is the sole nitrogen source, Ssy1
  may react to it and recruit casein kinase Yck1/2 to phosphorylate the N-terminus
  of Ssy5. The N-terminus of Ssy5 is ubiquitinated and degraded to free the Cat domain,
  which cleaves the N-terminal regulatory domains of Stp1 and Stp2. The shorter forms
  of Stp1 and Stp2 target the nucleus and bind the UASAA elements AGP1 and BAP2, activating
  expression of these genes. Then, Agp1p and Bap2p are secreted into the membrane
  of the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are processed, modified, and transferred
  to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and packaging. Finally, Agp1p and
  Bap2p are localized to the cell membrane and transport extracellular L-Phe into
  cells.
