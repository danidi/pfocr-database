caption: NRTIs directly inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) inducing
  an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). NRTIs also inhibit mtDNA replication
  which can, in time, disrupt MRC function through a depletion of mtDNA encoded transcripts
  and MRC complex components. Augmented ROS production likely induces mitohormetic
  signalling which involves factors involved in prolonged longevity signalling culminating
  in increased lifespan (red dashed arrow). Based on our results, likely signalling
  pathway include CEP-1, SKN-1 and HIF-1. NRTI induced ROS also prompts gst-4 expression.
  Black solid arrows indicate results from this study. Grey dashed arrows indicate
  hypothetical pathways.
