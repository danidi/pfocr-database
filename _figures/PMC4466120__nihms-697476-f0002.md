caption: The pathway of net citrate production in citrate-producing prostate epithelial
  cells. Aspartate provides the intramitochondrial source of oxaloacetate and glucose
  provides the source of acetyl CoA for citrate synthesis. Citrate oxidation is limited
  due to the inhibition of m-aconitase activity by the intramitochondrial accumulation
  of high zinc levels. Citrate accumulates within the cell and is ultimately secreted
  as a major constituent of prostatic fluid. asp, aspartate; gluc, glucose; glut,
