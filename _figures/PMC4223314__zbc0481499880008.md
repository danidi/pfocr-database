caption: Diagram of the new Ras/NORE1A/Wnt signaling pathway. We interpret our data
  to suggest a novel Ras/NORE1A signaling pathway that activates β-TrCP toward a subset
  of its substrates, such as β-catenin, but not IκB. This results in differential
  degradation of SCFβ-TrCP substrates by the proteasome in the presence of Ras/NORE1A
  signaling.
