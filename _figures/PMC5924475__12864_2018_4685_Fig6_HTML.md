caption: The reported characterized Ca2+signaling pathways and the proposed possible
  fourth pathway mediated by the SCAMK proteins. The schematic Ca2+ wave stands for
  Ca2+ signals. The pathways I and II are shown in bluish lines indicating they are
  evolutionarily related. The pathways III and IV are shown in reddish lines showing
  they are evolutionarily related, although the proposed fourth pathway still needs
  future biochemical validation. The pathway I CCaMK is only found in land plants,
  and CaMKIs, IIs, IVs are found in animal, fungi, myxamoeba, Dictiostelium. The pathway
  II is found only in plants and certain protists. The pathway III is found in plants
  and Excavata. The pathway IV is found in Metakinetoplastina protists
