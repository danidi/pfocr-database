caption: Arachidonic acid is liberated from the cell membrane phospholipids by cytoplasmic
  phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Free arachidonic acid can be metabolized through cyclooxygenase
  (COX) and the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways. In the COX pathway, arachidonic acid
  is enzymatically converted to biological mediators called prostanoids, including
  prostaglandins (PGs) by specific prostaglandin synthases through several intermediary
  steps. COX-1 is the constitutive cyclooxygenase and maintains basal levels of prostaglandins,
  whereas COX-2 is inducible and produces prostaglandins under inflammatory conditions.
  In the 5-LOX pathway, arachidonic acid is converted into biologically active metabolites,
  such as leukotrienes (LTB4), which also trigger inflammatory response. Prostaglandin-mediated
  activation of p38 leads to the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA, which further enhances
  the prostaglandin production and inflammation through COX-2 pathway. Activated p38-MAPK
  phosphorylates and activates Runx-2 transcription factor, which triggers the expression
  of COL10A1 gene. Leukotrienes (LTB4) derived from 5-LOX pathway also activate p38-MAPK
  as well as ERK1/2 by phosphorylation. Phospho-ERK1/2 can also lead to the activation
  of Runx-2. Besides activating Runx-2, phospho-ERK1/2 is also known to inactivate
  and alleviate the inhibitory action of FOXO3a, thus further increasing the COL10A1
  gene expression. Naproxen, by inhibiting both the COX-1 and COX-2, causes diversion
  of arachidonic acid to 5-LOX-pathway-mediated leukotriene production. These leukotrienes
  (LTB4) in turn upregulate COL10A1 gene expression.
