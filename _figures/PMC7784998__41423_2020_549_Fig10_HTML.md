caption: Relationships between ISG12a and innate immunity, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway and cancer immunity in cancer. ISG12a promotes the proteasomal degradation
  of β-catenin by inhibiting the proteasomal degradation of Axin in cancer cells.
  By suppressing the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, ISG12a decreases expression
  of the immune checkpoint PD-L1 to promote the anticancer immunity represented by
  NK cell-mediated killing. Innate immune effector ISG12a promotes cancer immunity
  through suppressing canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
