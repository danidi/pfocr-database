caption: Glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA),
  and glycolytic inhibition with 2-DG. Diagram shows the main steps in glycolysis,
  its relationship to the PPP and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the action sites
  of 2-DG. Briefly, glucose enters cytoplasm via glucose transporters (GLUT3 in neurons
  or GLUT1 in glia), where glycolysis takes place. Glucose is first phosphorylated
  to glucose-6-P (G-6-P) and then further catalyzed to pyruvate via multiple steps.
  Pyruvate is the final product of glycolysis, which then enters mitochondria to participate
  in the TCA cycle for oxidative ATP production. G-6-P also enters the PPP, which
  generates reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione
  (GSH) to prevent the cell damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). When 2-DG
  is present, it competes with glucose for GLUT3/GLUT1 to enter the cell. Once in
  the cell, 2-DG is phosphorylated to 2-DG-6-P, which is trapped in the cell and cannot
  be further metabolized. 2-DG-6-P limits G-6-P conversion to F-6-P, which is the
  main mechanism of glycolytic inhibition by 2-DG.
