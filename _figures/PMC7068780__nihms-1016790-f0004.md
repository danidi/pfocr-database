caption: Grey nodes represent locus genes as well as genes prioritized from e/meQTL
  and PCHiC sources, based on genetics association of 16,531,985 markers with allergic
  rhinitis in 212,120 individuals. Blue nodes represent drugs from the ChEMBL drug
  database. Edges represent very-high confidence interactions from the STRING database
  (for locus-locus interactions) and drug target evidence (for drug-locus interactions).
  Red borders indicate genes with protein products that were significantly enriched
  in the “Th1 and Th2 Activation” pathway (-log[p-value] >19.1) from the IPA pathway
  analysis.
