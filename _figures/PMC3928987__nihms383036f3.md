caption: Lipoxygenase pathway of AA. LOX metabolizes AA to their corresponding isomeric
  hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs). 5-HPETE is reduced by peroxidase to
  5-HETE, then, 5-HETE is converted to 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE). 5-HETE
  and 5-ox-ETE are tumorigenic. Role of 8-HETE in prostate cancer is not known while
  12-HETE is tumorigenic. 15-LOX-1 metabolizes the major substrate, linoleic acid
  (LA) to 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) (inset). 15-LOX-1 is tumorigenic.
  15-LOX-2 metabolizes AA to 15-HETE, which is antitumorigenic in prostate cancer.
