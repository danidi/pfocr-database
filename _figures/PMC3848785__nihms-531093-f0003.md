caption: 'Schematic diagram of the known PtdEtn biosynthetic pathways. PtdEtn can
  be synthesized by several routes. The major route is the CDP-Etn pathway (Kennedy
  Pathway). Dietary Etn is converted to PtdEtn, by the stepwise action of ethanolamine
  (Etn) kinase (encoded by the Drosophila eas locus), Etn cytidyltransferase (ECT)
  and Etn phosphotransferase (EPT). PtdEtn can also be produced by PtdSer decarboxylation
  and converted to PtdCho by sequential methylation. The known enzymes required for
  the various steps in the pathway are shown. Abbreviations: choline (Cho), phosphoethanolamine
  (P-Etn), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), phosphatidylcholine
  (PtdCho), phosphocholine (P-Cho), phosphatidylserine (PtdSer).'
