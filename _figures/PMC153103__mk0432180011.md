caption: A model for the role of Inp53p and other machinery in trafficking of TGN
  resident proteins between the TGN and endosomes. In this model the AP-1 adaptor
  complex, clathrin, and Inp53p are required for anterograde TGN-to-early endosome
  transport while clathrin and the GGA proteins are required for TGN-to-PVC transport.
  TGN proteins such as A-ALP (A) tend to cycle between the TGN and early endosome
  and infrequently enter the PVC perhaps because of inefficient sorting at the TGN
  or early endosome. Inp53p acts in concert with the AP-1/clathrin perhaps in vesicle
  uncoating. In contrast, proteins such as Vps10p and Cps1p (V) are transported directly
  to from the TGN to the PVC via the GGA/clathrin pathway.
