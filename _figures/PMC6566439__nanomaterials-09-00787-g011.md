caption: Pathway analysis reveals the dysregulated expression of apoptosis-inducing
  genes. (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showing interconnected
  genes in the biological pathways. Red and blue colors represent genes respectively
  up- and downregulated by palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs). (B) Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) showing enriched pathways with both up- and downregulated genes.
  Note that DNA repair and apoptosis pathways were both detected within the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs). (C) GeneMANIA analysis showing the gene co-expression network
  (grey lines) and protein–protein interactions (light green lines) in the KEGG pathways
  (oxidative phosphorylation and MAPK signaling pathway).
