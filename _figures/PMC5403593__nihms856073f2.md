caption: An overview of the cell cycle phases and two examples of independent core
  pathways in the G1 stage. The first core pathway involves the MAPK (Raf/MEK/ERK)
  and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, and the second core pathway encompasses Hippo (YAP1)
  and WNT (β-catenin, or other pathways that lead to the expression (or activation)
  of Myc such as Notch, Hedgehog, etc.). Both of core pathways are parallel. At the
  G1→S restriction point, ERK and YAP1 regulate the post-mitosis G1 phase (G1-pm),
  whereas PI3K and β-catenin regulate the pre-synthesis G1 phase (G1-ps). ERK and
  YAP1, and PI3K and β-catenin, correspond to each other because they act in the same
  cell cycle stage; MAPK and PI3K cell cycle actions are consecutive as are those
  of YAP1 and β-catenin.
