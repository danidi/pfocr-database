caption: 'Coloured arrows in pathways represent changes for cell cultured at 45°C:
  up- (red) or downregulation (green) or not significantly modulated (purple) or protein
  not detected (blue) and not known to be present in Lb. casei (black). Dashed-lines
  represent a series of reactions, where every enzyme or substrate not is shown. Small
  arrows (red, up-regulated and green, down-regulated) show changes in abundance at
  40°C and 45°C with asterisks indicating FDR (**, FDR<1% and *, FDR<5%). Glck, Glucokinase;
