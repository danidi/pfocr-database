caption: 'TLR7/TLR9 and B cell receptor (BCR) ligands incite B cell signaling cascades.
  (A) Depiction of how immunogenic extracellular nucleic acid (NA) antigens are internalized
  to activate endosomal TLR7 and TLR9. NA antigens comprising double-stranded deoxyribonucleic
  acid (dsDNA) or single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) or synthetic analog reach
  the endosomal compartment via any of the following potential mechanisms: (1) membrane
  uptake of immune complex (IC) (NA protein or antibody); (2) diffusion (synthetic
  compounds or oligonucleotides), or (3) BCR- or Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated internalization
  when either is recognized directly. Once internalized, the NA component of the IC
  binds the appropriate toll-like receptor (TLR) molecule, initiating dimerization
  and signal transduction. TLR7/TLR9 and BCR pathway stimulation leads to the activation
  of nuclear factors and to transcription of additional activation genes, such as
  mediators of proliferation and effector cytokines. Trafficking of TLR7 and TLR9
  from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomal compartments is tightly regulated by
  the chaperone protein, UNC93B1. (B) The major molecular activators immediately downstream
  of the BCR and TLR7/TLR9 and molecular points of crosstalk between the two signaling
  pathways. On the left-hand side, initial activation of TLR7/TLR9 by NA in the endosome
  leads to the recruitment and binding of MyD88 to their intracellular domains. This
  TLR7/TLR9 activation leads to Myddosome complex composed of MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4,
  and subsequent recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), each activated
  sequentially. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 associates with and polyubiquitinates the TAK1
  complex (including proteins TAB 1 and TAB 2, not depicted). TAK1 then undergoes
  autophosphorylation, initiating the MAPK or NFκB pathways. These pathways can each
  result in the activation of important transcription factors including NFκB, AP-1,
  and IRFs (3, 5, and 7) that govern B cell fate. On the right-hand side, BCR ligation
  activates proximal kinase proteins including Lyn, Blk, Syk, and Btk. These kinases
  phosphorylate adaptor molecules including, BLNK, BCAP, and BANK1, which function
  as scaffolding proteins and allow for the many divergent pathways activated downstream
  of BCR including PLCγ2, MAPK, PI3K, and NFκB pathways. Molecules known to convey
  crosstalk between the BCR–TLR pathways upon ligation by NA-ICs include Lyn, Syk,
  Btk, BANK1, BCAP, TAK1, and DOCK8. The proposed mechanism of positive or negative
  regulation of TLR signaling is shown. Key: arrows = activation; multiple arrows = indirect
  activation; perpendicular lines = inhibition; broken lines = unknown in B cells
  because published work done on non-B cells; solid lines = protein association; gray
  broken arrow = contradictory regulation of TLR signaling; circled question-mark = mechanism
  of TLR regulation unknown. Abbreviations: Lyn, Lck/Yes-related novel protein tyrosine
  kinase; Blk, B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase; Syk, spleen tyrosine kinase; Btk, Bruton
  tyrosine kinase; BLNK, B cell linker protein; BCAP, B cell adaptor for phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; BANK1, B cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats 1; PLCγ2, phosphoinositide-specific

  TNF receptor-associated factor; IRF, interferon regulator factor.'
