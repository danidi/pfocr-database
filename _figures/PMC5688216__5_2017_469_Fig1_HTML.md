caption: Regulatory T cell development (Churlaud et al. ; Josefowicz and Rudensky
  ; Kosten and Rustemeyer ; Zhang et al. ). Thymus-derived regulatory T cells (tTregs)
  can develop from SP CD4+CD8− thymocytes (a), or an alternative pathway of their
  development from DN is hypothesized (b); CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs can also arise in
  the thymus from SP CD8+CD4− thymocytes (c). Both thymic Tregs migrate to peripheral
  lymphoid organs as mature T cells exhibiting suppressive potential. Peripherally
  induced Tregs differentiate from antigen-activated naive Th CD4+ cells into pTregs
  of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ phenotype. Additionally, Tr1 and Th3 are generated (d); naive
  T CD8+ cells can differentiate into CD8+CD28− Tregs (e); γδ Tregs can arise from
  antigen-activated γδ T cells (f). DN double-negative, DP double-positive, SP single-positive,
  TEC thymic epithelial cells, DC dendritic cells
