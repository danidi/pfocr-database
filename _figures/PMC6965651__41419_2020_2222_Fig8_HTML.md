caption: ADT-OH leads to apoptosis of B16F10 cells via FADD-dependent apoptotic pathway.
  In B16F10 cells, ADT-OH promotes IκBα degradation and inhibits NF-κB activation,
  thus leading to down-regulate NF-κB-targeted anti-apoptotic genes, such as XIAP,
  BCL2, to finally induce apoptosis. In addition, ADT-OH can also increase the expression
  level of intracellular FADD by decreasing the expression level of MKRN1, an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase of FADD, thereby activating caspase 8 in downstream to further induce caspase
  3 activation, finally enhancing apoptosis.
