caption: Mitochondrial redox signaling as essential part of branched-chain keto-acid-
  stimulated secretion of insulin. Branched-chain keto-acids are metabolized by a
  series of catabolic reactions leading to production of substrates fueling Kreb‘s
  cycle and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. ATP and H2O2 then cause closure of
  the ATP-dependent K+ channels (KATP) on the plasmatic membrane, membrane depolarization
  and activation of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaL) setting off the canonical
  pathway of insulin release. BCAT—branched-chain α-ketoacid amino transferase; BCKDH—branched-chain
  α-ketoacid dehydrogenase; IVD—isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase; MCC—methylcrotonyl-CoA
  carboxylase; MGCoAH—methyl-glutoconyl-CoA hydratase; HMGCoAL—3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  lyase.
