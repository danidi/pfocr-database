caption: The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) activates the stimulator of interferon
  genes (STING) pathway. cGAS binds to cytosolic DNA, which can originate from infection
  with foreign DNA or damaged mitochondria or nuclei. cGAS catalyzes the cyclization
  of ATP and GTP to cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (2′3′-cGAMP).
  2′3′-cGAMP binds to STING that is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
  two cascades are initiated and trigger the transcription of type I interferons.
