caption: Schematic of the primary molecular pathways leading to pyroptosis in monocytes/macrophages
  in CVDs. Internalization of oxidized low‐density lipoprotein (oxLDL) by macrophages
  through CD36 receptor leads to intracellular gathering of cholesterol crystals in
  large phagolysosomal compartments. Cholesterol crystals can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome
  through lysosomal damage. oxLDL can also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the
  TLRs/NF‐κB pathway. Activated NLRP3 inflammasome induces the release of mature IL‐1β
  and IL‐18 and further leads to inflammatory cell infiltration and pyroptosis
