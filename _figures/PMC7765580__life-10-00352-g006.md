caption: Cyanosulfidic geochemical scenario proposed by Sutherland and co-workers
  [,,]. (A) Reaction scheme for the cyanocuprate-photocatalytic synthesis of ribonucleotide
  and amino acid intermediates. Not shown are pathways for additional amino acid and
  phospholipid precursors. For more details, see reference []. (B) Scheme for arabinose
  aminooxazoline synthesis 28 via the Powner-Sutherland pathway from potential evaporites
  that could have yielded the necessary starting materials. Image redrawn based on
  D of reference []. (C) A post-meteoritic impact geochemical scenario where streams
  produced from rainfall carry different starting materials derived from various evaporites
  as shown in (B). The image in (C) was reprinted with permission from reference [].
