caption: RICTOR is upstream of multiple canonical pathways. a RICTOR and its downstream
  proteins displayed as a network. Symbol color represents expression value, red indicating
  an upregulation and blue/green indicating downregulation in our dataset. RICTOR
  modulates the expression or function of downstream proteins listed in figure. The
  aggregate expression values of data set proteins contribute to a predicted decrease
  in RICTOR activity. b Proteins downstream of RICTOR can be grouped into five canonical
  pathway groups and four families. The identified pathways are also included in the
  top five pathways identified as affected by age
