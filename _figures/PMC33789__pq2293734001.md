caption: Viral inhibitors of the PKR pathway. PKR is depicted as a monomer  with a
  kinase domain (KD) and two dsRNA binding domains (RBD) bound to  the 60S ribosomal
  subunit. The binding of dsRNA induces a  conformational change to promote PKR dimerization,
  autophosphorylation,  and activation of the eIF-2α kinase activity. Activated PKR
  also  leads to activation of NF-κB, p53, and IFN regulatory factor 1  (IRF1). Viral
  inhibitors that act through different mechanisms are  depicted. Adenovirus VA RNAs,
  Epstein–Barr virus EBER RNAs, and HIV  transactivator responsive region TAR RNA
  bind and inhibit PKR and  presumably displace PKR from the ribosome. Numerous viral
  proteins,  such as vaccinia virus E3L, influenza virus NS1, and reovirus σ3 bind  and
  sequester dsRNA, thereby preventing activation by dsRNA. Vaccinia  virus K3L and
  HIV trans-activating transcriptional activator Tat act to  inhibit PKR binding to
  eIF-2α. Protein phosphatase PP1  dephosphorylates phosphorylated eIF-2α as well
  as phosphorylated PKR.  Herpes simplex virus 1 encodes a protein γ32.5 that facilitates  activation
  of PP1. Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein NS5A  prevents PKR dimerization.
  In addition, influenza virus activates a  cellular inhibitor P58IPK that also inhibits
  PKR  dimerization. Poliovirus induces PKR degradation. (See ref.  and  references
  therein). met represents initiator methionyl tRNA, and AUG  represents the initiator
  codon.
