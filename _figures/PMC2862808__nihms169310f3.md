caption: In normal myeloid progenitors (left side schematic), miR-24 is repressed
  by Runx1. This activates MAP kinase phosphatase 7 (MKP-7), which in turn blocks
  the activity of MAP kinase, thus down-regulating myeloid cell proliferation, concomitant
  with an increase in granulocytic differentiation. In AML patients, the leukemic
  AML1-ETO occupies the same site in the miR-24 promoter, but activates it. Activation
  of miR-24 down-regulates MKP-7 and up-regulates down-stream MAPK signaling. Activation
  of MAPK then leads to activated cell proliferation and inhibited myeloid cell differentiation,
  hallmarks of leukemia blast cells.
