caption: In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway (shaded grey), the signal is transduced
  through Dishevelled (Dvl) upon Wnt protein binding to its receptor Frizzled (Fz).
  The activation of Dvl leads to disassemble of the destruction complex consisting
  axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and GSK3β, which results in the accumulation
  of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nuclear translocation. After nuclear translocation,
  β-catenin interacts with transcription factors TCF/LEF to regulate target gene expression.
  Additional crosstalk between the Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β signaling pathways as well
  as Wnt/β-catenin with other transcription factor, such as Hif-1α controls cellular
  events essential in organ morphogenesis and wound repair during late fetal and postnatal
  stages. In contrast, the non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling (shaded yellow) leads to
  the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton via the activation of Rho family of small
  GTPases (RhoA and Rac1) and their downstream protein kinases (JNK or Rho associated
  kinase (ROCK)). This signaling mechanism regulates polarized cell movement and establishes
  planar cell polarity (PCP) that are essential for epidermal wound repair, neural
  tube closure, and cochlea hair cell polarity during early phase of fetal development.
