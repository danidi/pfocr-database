caption: 'ADAM17/EGFR signaling an important player in CF and COPD lung disease. In

  exposure [] cause enhanced activity of the EGFR/ADAM17 signaling cascade, and thus
  enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors that are ADAM17
  substrates and signaling molecules that are downstream of the EGFR/MAPK pathway
  () including the proinflammatory CXCL8 (IL-8). In chronic lung disease, this could
  contribute to mucous metaplasia, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. A potential
  link between CFTR deficiency, COPD, and EGFR/ADAM17 activity (dashed arrows) is
  the extracellular redox potential, which is in part dependent on CFTR-related glutathione

  long-term downregulation of CFTR expression [, , ] can have the same long-term effect,
  in addition to the acute oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoke. In this figure,
  we focus on two canonical ADAM17 substrates: proinflammatory IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)
  and growth factor amphiregulin (AREG). AREG is proteolytically cleaved by ADAM17
  from airway epithelial cells and activates EGFR in the airway epithelial cells and
  on the underlying fibroblasts. IL-6R trans-signaling requires ADAM17-mediated shedding
  of the extracellular domain or alternative mRNA splicing. The soluble sIL-6R binds
  to IL-6 creating IL-6/sIL-6R complexes that trans-activate gp130 on the underlying
  myofibroblasts and myeloid cells. Signals transduced by AREG and IL-6R shed from
  airway epithelial cells converge in combined activation of the transcription factor
  STAT3 in myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. STAT3 is involved in fibrotic responses
