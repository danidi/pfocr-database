caption: (A) shows a simplified, linear view of the aggregation pathway of α-synuclein
  (in blue). The monomer of α-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein with several
  repeats, shown by dark bars on the monomer. The protein has an innate tendency to
  aggregate with other molecules of α-synuclein, first into oligomers (also known
  as protofibrils), then into fibrils. It is the fibrillar forms of α-synuclein that
  are deposited into the classic pathological structures of PD, Lewy bodies. There
  are several studies that suggest that the oligomeric intermediates are the major
  toxic species, although this is not certain. (B) shows the recessive mutations associated
  with parkinsonism and their possible relationships to subcellular targets, either
  mitochondria (left) or the proteasome (right). Insults to either of these can cause
  cellular damage and may interact. For example, proteasome inhibitors can cause mitochondrial
  damage, which can be antagonized by PINK1. Parkin can promote the turnover of proteasomal
  substrates, and DJ-1 can prevent mitochondrial damage.Quite whether (B) relates
  to (A) is not clear, but recent results with DJ-1 imply that DJ-1 has chaperone
  activity towards oligomers of α-synuclein (see text). Although there is much to
  be done to resolve the order of these events, it is likely that, either alone or
  in concert, damage to multiple cellular pathways leads to neuronal dysfunction and,
  eventually, cell death.
