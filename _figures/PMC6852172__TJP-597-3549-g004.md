caption: A, intestinal glucose and fructose absorption and fructose conversion into
  glucose and lactate within the enterocytes. Glucose is primarily absorbed via the
  sodium dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and is largely transmitted passively
  into the portal vein. Fructose is primarily absorbed via glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5)
  and can be transmitted into the portal vein via glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) or
  can be metabolized within the enterocyte. Via first conversion into fructose‐1‐phosphate
  (via fructokinase) glucose‐6‐phosphate and pyruvate can be formed. Glucose‐6‐phosphate
  can be converted into glucose (via glucose‐6‐phosphatase) and leave the enterocyte
  via GLUT2. Pyruvate can be converted into lactate (via lactate dehydrogenase) and
  leave the enterocyte via monocarboxylate transporter (MCT). B, main pathways involved
  in hepatic glucose and fructose absorption and fructose conversion into glucose
  and lactate during exercise. Glucose is primarily taken up via GLUT2 and is largely
  transmitted passively into the systemic circulation. Fructose can be taken up via
  GLUT2, GLUT5 and/or GLUT8 and is largely metabolized into glucose and lactate during
  exercise. Via first conversion into fructose‐1‐phosphate (via fructokinase) glucose‐6‐phosphate
  and pyruvate can be formed. Glucose‐6‐phosphate can be converted into glucose (via
  glucose‐6‐phosphatase) and leave the hepatocyte via GLUT2. Glucose‐6‐phosphate can
  also be used as a substrate for restoring liver glycogen during exercise (via conversion
  first into glucose‐1‐phosphate and subsequently into UDP‐glucose). However, fructose
  co‐ingestion is not more effective in preventing liver glycogen depletion during
  exercise compared to glucose ingestion only, suggesting that liver glycogen storage
  during exercise may not be a primary pathway. Pyruvate can be used as substrate
  to provide direct energy to the liver (TCA cycle) or can be converted into lactate
  (via lactate dehydrogenase) and leave the hepatocyte via the monocarboxylate transporter
  (MCT). The additional glucose and lactate (derived from fructose) can be used as
  substrate for oxidation in the muscle during exercise. GLUT, glucose transporter;
  TCA Cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; UDP‐glucose, uridine diphosphate glucose.
