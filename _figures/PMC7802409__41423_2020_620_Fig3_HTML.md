caption: Microglia damage to neurons after encephalitis leads to neurological complications
  in survivors. Activated microglia are highly phagocytic and express many components
  of the complement pathway. Aggregation of complement components on neurons is sensed
  by complement receptor 3 (CR3), which is expressed by microglia. This activation
  leads to phagocytosis and synaptic stripping of neurons. Interferon gamma receptor
  (IFNgR) signaling in microglia regulates neuronal synaptic stripping upon the induction
  of viral encephalitis. The role of purinergic receptors, Peli1 and other cytokines
  in synaptic stripping is not known
