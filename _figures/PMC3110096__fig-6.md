caption: 'Summary of processes known or proposed to involve BSH. BSH is known or predicted
  to participate in numerous aspects of cellular redox chemistry, including (clockwise
  from top): (i) the formation of mixed disulfides with OhrR in response to organic
  peroxides (in addition to other OhrR oxidation products); (ii) the NADH-dependent
  reduction of SNO compounds (which can generate BSNO by transnitrosylation), perhaps
  mediated by AdhA; (iii) BST-dependent detoxification including, as an example, the
  FosB-dependent inactivation of fosfomycin (conjugation products may then be processed
  by Bca); (iv) detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG) by formation and degradation
  of the MG conjugate by glyoxylases I and II (Glx I,II); (v) detoxification of formaldehyde
  (FA) mediated by AdhA; (vi) detoxification of selenite may involve Brx-like proteins
  in a pathway analogous to that observed with GSH; (vii) reduction of oxidized BSSB
  by a protein (perhaps YpdA) analogous to glutathione reductase; and (viii) reversible
  chelation of intracellular metal ions (Mn+) by BSH.'
