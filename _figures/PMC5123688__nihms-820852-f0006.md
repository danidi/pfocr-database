caption: Representative image of wild-type and Tlr8−/− mice cells that are infected
  with WNV and the proposed mechanism of signaling. In wild-type cells infected with
  WNV, TLR8 signaling results in increased SOCS-1, which negatively regulates antiviral
  immunity via direct STAT-1 inhibition () or possibly through ISG-56 inhibition,
  which results in increased viral load, triggering the p53-Bax-dependant apoptosis
  pathway (, ). Conversely, in TLR8 deficient cells (Tlr8−/−) SOCS-1 is not adequately
  induced, therefore antiviral immunity is minimally inhibited, resulting in increased
  Isg-56, Irf7, and Tlr7 expression, which ultimately amplifies the TLR7 signaling
  pathway, while successfully controlling viral load and reducing virus-induced apoptosis.
  The non-canonical function of SOCS-1 directly binding to TLR8 and not TLR7, in both
  mock and TLR7 and TLR8 stimulated cells, is yet to be further elucidated.
