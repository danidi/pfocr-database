caption: The mechanism of Mir20a/106a-WTX axis regulates RhoGDI/CDC42 signaling and
  their function in CRC progression. In CRC cell, the aberrant high miR-20a/106a inhibits
  WTX expression. Without WTX, RhoGDIα could not form the stable RhoGDIα/CDC42 complex,
  subsequently the CDC42GDP dissociats from RhoGDIα and transforms to CDC42GTP and
  becomes active. Then CDC42GTP activates the downstream MRCKa-LIMK1/2-Cofilin pathway,
  which results in F-actin remodeling, increased cell proliferation, polarity, and
  migration ability, finally promots CRC progression and liver metastasis. To block
  miR-20a/106a could recover WTX expression. The regained WTX promots RhoGDIα/CDC42
  complex formation and keeps it stability, so that CDC42 stays inactivity by keeping
  in the CDC42GDP type which inhibits MRCKa-LIMK1/2-Cofilin pathway, thus prevents
  CRC progression and liver metastasis (all the images in the figure are created by
  Q.-l. Z, polished by C. L and H. W.)
