caption: 'Potential model for phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent opponent
  input to rodent olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). One component of a binary odorant
  mixture (yellow circles) excites the cell through the canonical cyclic nucleotide
  signaling pathway: the olfactory receptor (OR) activates a G-protein (Gαolf), which
  in turn activates adenylyl cyclase (AC3) to produce cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) that activates the olfactory cyclic nucleotide gated channel (CNGC). The
  other component (blue stars), potentially binding to the same OR, inhibits the cell
  by activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) through the beta/gamma subunit of
  the same or still unknown G-protein. Activation of PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3), which negatively regulates sensitivity of the CNGC
  to cAMP and reduces the net output of the ORN. The involvement of phospholipase
  C (PLC, faded) to produce inositol-1,4,5-phosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG)
  remains to be explored.'
