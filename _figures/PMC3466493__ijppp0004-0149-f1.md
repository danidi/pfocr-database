caption: The scheme representing effects of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide
  in regulation of cancer cell anoikis through a caveolin-1-dependent pathway. In
  the attached condition, hydroxyl radical enhances cancer cell migration and invasion
  by increasing the level of caveolin-1 protein, while hydrogen peroxide and superoxide
  anion play an opposite effect. Under cell detachment condition, the loss of cell-extracellular
  matrix interaction mediates caveolin-1 down-regulation and anoikis. Endogenous hydrogen
  peroxide functions in maintaining caveolin-1 level which subsequently suppressed
  anoikis. Also, exogenous hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide sustains such caveolin-1
  level and inhibited anoikis response of the cells. During anoikis, caveolin-1 inhibits
  anoikis via Mcl-1 and/or Akt-dependent pathways.
