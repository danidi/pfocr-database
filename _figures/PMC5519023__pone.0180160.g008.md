caption: The 20E titer in the nm2 mutant was lower than in the wildtype, leading to
  upregulation of ecdysone biosynthesis genes and downregulation of CYP314A1, which
  takes part in the conversion from ecdysone to 20E. Two nuclear receptor genes, HR3
  and HR4, were markedly downregulated, whereas the key nuclear receptor gene βFTZ-F1
  was significantly upregulated. BmCPG10 might act as an EPDFP monitor to regulate
  the molting process by controlling the biosynthesis of ecdysone.
