caption: Schematic illustration of ER stress and the activation of the three UPR pathways.
  Under stressed conditions, the separation of BiP/GRP78 and UPR sensors activates
  the signal transduction pathways. PERK is activated to phosphorylate eIF2α at Ser51,
  and this process increases the ATF4 level. DDIT/CHOP is the target of ATF4 and can
  help to upregulate apoptosis genes and downregulate antiapoptosis genes. IRE1 cleaves
  a 26-nucleotide segment from XBP1 mRNA to produce a transcriptionally active XBP1
  (XBP1s). XBP1 can accelerate protein folding and transport as well as degeneration,
  and IRE1 can also react directly with TRAF2, leading to activation of the apoptosis
  signaling pathway and inhibition of the antiapoptosis signaling pathway. ATF6 transits
  to the Golgi and is processed by the proteases S1P and S2P to become an activated
  fragment called PSOATF6. PSOATF6 moves into the nucleus and subsequently activates
  the expression of BiP, ER protein 57, and Grp 94. These proteins enhance the capacity
  to alleviate protein loading and maintain ER homeostasis through accelerating protein
  folding, transduction and degradation.
