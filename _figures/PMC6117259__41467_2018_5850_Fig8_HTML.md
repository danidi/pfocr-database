caption: GT-induced anoikis signalling. FAK is recruited to focal adhesions via paxillin
  and is active in healthy adhesion cells. Active FAK phosphorylates p190RhoGAP. Phosphorylated
  p190RhoGAP stimulates the GTPase activity of RhoA. RhoA and the downstream anoikis-inducing
  cascade is therefore inactive (left). GT inactivates integrins, possibly by covalent
  binding to cysteines in the N-terminal region of α and β chains and triggers the
  disassembly of focal adhesions. Paxillin is degraded and FAK is inactivated, resulting
  in inactive p190RhoGAP. RhoA is consequently active and induces anoikis via a kinase
  cascade from ROCK to MKK4/MKK7 to JNK, resulting in the pro-apoptotic triple phosphorylation
  of Bim (right). Inhibitory integrin antibodies such as Cilengitide or FAK inhibitors
  such as FAK14 can induce the same anoikis signalling pathway
