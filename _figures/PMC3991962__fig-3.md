caption: Model of integrin-mediated phagocytosis in TM cells. Phagocytosis in TM cells
  involves an αvβ5 integrin–focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway that can
  regulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling to form the phagocytic cup in TM cells. Activation
  of the αvβ3 integrin via dexamethasone (DEX) hinders αvβ5 integrin-FAK-mediated
  phagocytosis, possibly by preventing actin remodeling.
