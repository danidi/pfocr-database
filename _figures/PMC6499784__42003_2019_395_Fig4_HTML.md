caption: Schematic representation of a proposed model of the TBS pathway interaction
  with PET. In normally functioning PET, electrons derived from water are subsequently
  transferred from photosystem II (PSII) to plastoquinone (PQ) generating its reduced
  form, plastoquinol (PQH2). PQH2 is then oxidised by transferring the electrons to
  cyt b6f and by PTOX2. In the ptox2 petB mutant, the PQ pool is almost completely
  reduced, as depicted by the greater PQH2 oval (PQ«PQH2). In such conditions, PPX
  cannot transfer the electrons derived from Protogen to PQ. FAD cofactor present
  in PPX is proposed to mediate in electron transfer from PPX to PQ. Thus, lack of
  the oxidised plastoquinone (PQ) leads to a dysfunction or a complete blockage of
  the PPX function. This in turn prevents synthesis of Proto in a controlled fashion.
  Subsequently, Protogen is unspecifically oxidised in the chloroplast and after sequestration
  in the cytosol, leading to the formation of Proto, which is inaccessible for MgCh
  and FeCh. Ultimately, accumulating Proto leaks out of the chloroplast and outside
  of the cell, which is observed as the brownish precipitate in the media. However,
  a small portion of the Proto formed in the chloroplast may be still available for
  the enzymes subsequently leading to biosynthesis of chlorophyll and heme
