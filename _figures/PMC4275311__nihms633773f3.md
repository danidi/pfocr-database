caption: The selective autophagy cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1 functions as a positive
  regulator of multiple tumor promoting pathways. Because p62 accumulates with autophagy
  inhibition, impairment of autophagy has been correlated with increased activation
  of multiple pathways and with enhanced tumor cell growth. First, Atg deletion and
  p62 have been shown to promote NFκB activity. p62 promotes NFκB function by interaction
  with TRAF6. The increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes by NFκB supports
  tumorigenesis. Second, Atg deletion promotes Nrf2 stability and activity by increasing
  levels of p62, which interacts with and sequesters Keap1. Keap1 is an adaptor for
  the E3-ubiquitin ligase that promotes Nrf2 ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation.
  Nrf2-mediated expression of antioxidants promotes tumor growth. Furthermore, in
  response to nutrient signaling, p62 complexes with regulators of mTOR to activate
  mTORC1 at the lysosome and promote cell growth. The impact of p62 on mTORC1 pathway
  activation during autophagy inhibition has not been established. Finally, RNAi-mediated
  depletion of ATGs or p62 overexpression enhances ERK signaling to enable the proliferation
  of transformed cells. The mechanism underlying this increase in ERK activity is
  not understood.
