caption: The proposed tentative mechanism underlying MAFA-mediated selective inhibition
  of FcɛRI-induced cytokine gene transcription. MAFA clustering leads to a rapid tyrosine
  phosphorylation of its ITIM sequence, probably by the PTK Lyn, which is associated
  with MAFA even in the unperturbed cells. Once phosphorylated, the ITIM directly
  binds several SH2 domain-containing molecules, such as SHIP and Lyn itself. When
  recruited to the proximity of the plasma membrane, SHIP dephosphorylates PI-3,4,5-P3
  and PI-4,5-P2 to PI(3,4)P2 and PI-4-P, respectively, and thereby interferes with
  the FcɛRI-induced recruitment and activation of PLCγ via PI-3,4,5-P3, as well as
  with the production of IP3 and DAG from the PLCγ substrate PI-4,5-P2. This in turn
  leads to inhibition of downstream coupling events including the transient rise of
  [Ca2+]i and the subsequent activation of PKC, p38 MAPK, NF-κB, and NFAT, which are
  all involved in the regulation of cytokine gene transcription. In parallel, phosphorylated
  SHIP recruits the adaptor molecule Dok-1, which then binds the Ras GTPase-activating
  protein (RasGAP). RasGAP is a negative regulator of the Ras signaling pathway and
  its recruitment to the plasma membrane inhibits activation of Erk-1/2 signaling
  and the cytokine gene transcription regulated by this pathway. In contrast, MAFA
  clustering (or co-clustering) was found to only marginally affect tyrosine phosphorylation
  of several key coupling elements such as PTK Syk and adaptor proteins LAT and Gab2.
  As a result, the PKB and Jnk signaling and the subsequent activation of AP-1 components
  (Jun and Fos) stay essentially unaffected, leading to unaltered transcription of
  several downstream inflammatory genes. The white arrows indicate signaling pathways
  unaffected by MAFA clustering; black strikes on black arrows indicate MAFA-mediated
  suppression.
