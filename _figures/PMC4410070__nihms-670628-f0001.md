caption: Atherosclerotic plaques begin with the recruitment of inflammatory cells
  such as monocytes and T cells to the endothelial lining of the blood vessel. The
  endothelial cells release leukocyte adhesion molecules (e.g., VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and
  E-selectin) to facilitate sub-endothelial cell migration. MIF and MCP-1 levels are
  elevated in SLE patients and lead to increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increase
  in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) has been
  implicated in vascular lesion formation. LDL modified by the effect of ROS results
  in the formation of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). SLE and other autoimmune diseases produce
  autoantibodies which form complexes with either lipid metabolizing enzymes like
  lipoprotein lipase or with apolipoproteins and slow down lipoprotein catabolism,
  which may produce varieties of dyslipidemia. oxLDL complexed to IgG (oxLDL-IC) can
  be internalized by macrophages and results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and promotes plaque formation. Pro-inflammatory HDL has been strongly associated
  with the development of carotid plaques and with intima media thickness in SLE patients.
  Targeting key metabolizing enzymes in the sphingolipid pathway (e.g., sphingomyelinases,
  ceramidases, and sphingosine kinases) that regulate the generation of the bioactive
  lipids sphingomyelin (SM), ceramide (Cer), sphingosine (Sph), and sphingosine 1-
  phosphate (S1P) in activated macrophages and foam cells might avert accelerated
  vascular disease in SLE.
