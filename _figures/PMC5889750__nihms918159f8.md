caption: The telomerase signaling pathway is oppositely modulated in platyfish (A)
  compared to medaka (B) and zebrafish (C) following FL exposure. The opposite modulation
  of the HDAC regulator (boxed in yellow) is predicted to be responsible for the opposite
  modulation of the telomerase signaling pathway. In each plot, molecules shaded in
  green represent down modulated transcripts and molecules shaded in red represent
  up-modulated transcripts (Fold Change see ). Functions shaded in blue are predicted
  to be suppressed and in orange are induced (IPA z-score -2.0 platyfish, 2.1 medaka
  and 2.3 zebrafish).
