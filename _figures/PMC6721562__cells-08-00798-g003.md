caption: 'Direct and indirect epigenetic control of cellular metabolism. The DNA and
  histones methylation status influences the glycolytic flux through promoter hypermethylation
  or hypomethylation of enzymes with key-roles in the glycolytic pathway. Indeed,
  hypomethylation of PKM2 (pyruvate kinase embryonic isozyme M2) or HK2 (hexokinase
  2) promoters is associated with the high glycolytic flow, whereas the downregulation
  of fructose 1,6-biphosphatase (FBP1) expression, due to promoter hypermethylation,
  inhibits gluconeogenesis and favors glycolytic metabolism. Moreover, epigenetic
  mechanisms indirectly control cell metabolism by promoter hypermethylation and consequent
  silencing of numerous tumor suppressor genes that repress PI3K/AKT/mTOR and HIF1α
  signaling pathways, two pro-tumorigenic cascades involved in prompting Warburg metabolism.
  Additionally, numerous histone demethylases, remodeling histone methylation patterns,
  influence cellular metabolism promoting transcriptional activation of several glycolytic
  genes, such as glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) and monocarboxylate transporter
  4 (MCT4), as well as mediating the activity and/or availability of crucial transcription
  factors. Abbreviations: G6P-Glucose 6-Phosphate; F6P-Fructose 6-Phosphate; F1,6BP
