caption: 'Overview of signal transduction pathways and role of selective inhibitors.
  Binding of a ligand (e.g., VEGF) to two adjacent receptors results in an active
  tyrosine kinase (e.g., VEGFR). The receptor tryosine kinase initially undergoes
  self-phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues; this results in stimulation
  of several pathways. For example, RTKs can stimulate the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway, as
  the phosphotyrosines of RTKs facilitate docking of Grb2–SOS complex, ultimately
  resulting in activation of Ras. The activated Ras binds to Raf-1; afterwards, Raf-1
  is activated via a complex series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps.
  Ultimately, this pathway regulates expression of genes controlling apoptosis and
  cell proliferation. Similarly, mTOR is stimulated by a phosphorylation cascade,
  which involves proteins including PI3K and AK2. Once stimulated, mTOR controls protein
  translation of elements involved in cell cycle progression; in addition mTOR also
  controls protein synthesis in response to environmental change and starvation (including
  synthesis of HIF-1α in RCC cells). The signal transduction pathways can be inhibited
  at several steps including: (1) inhibition of VEGF (by bevacizumab); (2) inhibition
  of tyrosine kinase activity of RTK (by sunitinib and sorafenib); (3) inhibition
  of Raf kinase (by sorafenib); (4) inhibition of mTOR (by CCI-779).'
