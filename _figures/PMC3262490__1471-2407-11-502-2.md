caption: 'The Notch signaling pathway. The initiation of the Notch signaling pathway
  begins when the Notch ligand binds to the Notch receptor. This action triggers two
  proteolytic cleavages by ADAM-type protease (S2) and γ-secretase (S3), respectively.
  Following cleavages, the activated form of Notch is released (NICD) and is translocated
  to the nucleus, where NICD forms complexes with specific DNA-binding proteins (CBF1/Suppressor
  of Hairless/LAG-1 and Mastermind/SEL-8). Afterward the transcriptional process of
  target genes is initiated. MAML1: Mastermind-like 1 protein; CBF1: DNA-binding transcription
  factor.'
