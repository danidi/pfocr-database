caption: Rice generates immunity, including ROS burst during its interaction with
  M. oryzae. Once host perception, M. oryzae induces MoOsm1 phosphorylation that disintegrates
  MoOsm1 dimerization leading to enhanced nuclear translocation of MoOsm1. MoOsm1
  phosphorylates MoAtf1 uncoupling MoAtf1-MoTup1 interaction that induces the expression
  of oxidation regulation pathway genes. At the same time, the phosphorylated MoAtf1
  promotes the expression of two phosphatases, MoPTP1 and MoPTP2, that dephosphorylate
  MoOsm1 to suppress MoAtf1-MoTup1 dissociation. MoPtp1/2-mediated MoOsm1 dephosphorylation
  provides an act balancing infection and its hemibiotrophic growth in rice.
