  (i) The pie chart offers information for the compounds present in these edible plants;

  through a first-degree neighbor (yellow diamond; Py) of TPx, (b) the phytochemical
  Cx is structurally similar with a compound (Cy) that interacts with the target protein
  (TPx). Straight lines represent verified interactions while dashed lines represent
