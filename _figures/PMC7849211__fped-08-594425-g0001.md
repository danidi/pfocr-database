caption: Evidence- and consensus-based algorithm of first- and second-tier therapies
  for pediatric TBI management. (A) The algorithm includes several components, such
  as baseline care (black), an ICP pathway (yellow), a herniation pathway (green),
  a CPP pathway (orange), and a PbrO2pathway (purple). Solid lines identify the ICP
  and CPP pathways, reflecting their primary role, a dashed line identifies the PbrO2pathway,
  given the fact that it represents a monitoring and management option, which is less
  commonly used and has less literature support. The caregiver should integrate all
  available information and implement the guidelines within the context of each patient's
  unique response to various therapies to establish the optimal treatment regimen.
  If baseline care is insufficient to control ICP, then progression down the ICP and
  CPP pathways is indicated (solid black line). First tier interventions progressing
  down the ICP pathway include optimized baseline care with controlled mechanical
  ventilation with normocarbia and adequate oxygenation, elevation of the head of
  the bed, nutrition, and appropriate analgesia and sedation, followed cerebrospinal
  fluid drainage and the use of hyperosmolar therapy as directed by ICP, CPP, or PbrO2.
  Please see the published TBI management algorithm () and  for details. The blue
  box indicates the need for second-tier therapy and represents the link to (B), which
  represents the treatment options for refractory intracranial hypertension when tier
  1 approaches are insufficient. These therapies may be applied singularly, serially
  or in combinations. In addition, as shown, the management of refractory intracranial
  hypertension in the second-tier phase may be aided by the use of advanced monitoring.
  Data are not available on the number of patients treated with each of the first
  and second tier therapies given that even Guidelines-based care is highly center
  dependent. CBF, cerebral blood flow; CPP, cerebral perfusion pressure; CT, computed
  tomography; EEG, electroencephalogram; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; ICP, intracranial
  pressure; PbrO2, brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen; PRx, pressure reactivity
  index; TBI, Traumatic brain injury; TCD, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Graphical
  elaboration of text and Figures 1, 2 in ().
