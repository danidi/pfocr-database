caption: Migratory pathway activated by androgens in mesenchymal and transformed mesenchymal
  cells. Androgen (10 nM) enhances AR/FlnA co-localization at intermediate cytoskeleton
  filaments and induces a tripartite complex including AR/FlnA/integrin beta1 in NIH3T3
  fibroblasts. This complex, likely through Trio-GEF, activates Rac. The Fln-associated
  GTPase activating protein (Fil-GAP) might switch off Rac-GTP. The AR/FlnA/integrin
  beta1 complex also triggers FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. Activation
  of this machinery modifies cytoskeleton actin and cell adhesion, thus increasing
  motility of target cells ().
