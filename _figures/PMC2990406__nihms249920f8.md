caption: A previously unknown miR-290–dependent pathway controls DNA methylation via
  Rbl2 and affects telomere integrity and telomere-length homeostasis. We identify
  here a regulatory pathway involving the highly conserved mammalian miR-290 cluster
  as an important post-transcriptional regulator of Rbl2, which in turn acts as a
  transcriptional repressor of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (a). In the absence of Dicer (b),
  miR-290 downregulation leads to increased levels of the miR-290 target Rbl2, which
  in turn acts as a transcriptional repressor of Dnmt3a,3b expression. Decreased Dnmt
  expression leads to a hypomethylation of the genome, including the subtelomeric
  regions, and to the appearance of telomere phenotypes such as increased telomere
  recombination and aberrantly long telomeres.
