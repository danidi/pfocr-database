  glycerol concentration and the enrichment of Hog1 in the nucleus. The model contains
  a feedback depending on Hog1p (with strength β) and one, which is independent of
  Hog1p (strength α). The equations for this model read  and . (b) The same model,
  interpreted in biological terms. The export of osmolytes is regulated by a mechanism,
  which does not depend on the MAPK pathway (e.g., closure of Fps1p) and by a mechanism
  depending on Hog1p activation. (c) Diagram of the model structure proposed by Zi
  et al. The model includes a simplified version of the MAPK pathway as well as two
  different feedbacks induced by activated Hog1p (a slow transcriptional and a fast
  nontranscriptional). Both of these feedbacks act by increasing the production of
  glycerol.'
