caption: 'Cellular calcium [Ca2+] homeostasis and signaling: Organelles and molecules
  that are involved in Ca2+ pathways. There are several pathways which can change
  the amount of [Ca2+]i and subsequently alter the biology of the cell. Several types
  of Ca2+-dependent proteins and subtypes in the cell include the store-operated Ca2+
  channels (SOCs), Ca2+ transporters, transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs),
  voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), and ligand-gated Ca2+ channels []. Furthermore,
  phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and its receptor (IP3R),
  the stromal-interacting molecule (STIM), are located on the membranes of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
  reticulum. Other subcellular organelles also have a role in [Ca2+]i homeostasis
  of the cell, notably the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and the Ca2+/Mn2+ ATPases
  (SPCAs) secretory pathway of the Golgi [,,]. Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm from the
  ER lumen and from the extracellular fluid via channels and pumps on the plasma membrane
  []. LGCCs: ligand-gated Ca2+-channels; ORAI: transient receptor potential canonical;
  SERCA: sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase.'
