number: Fig. 1
caption: Diagram of mechanistic treatment used in OMPBioM. The downward vertical arrow
  at the top of the figure indicates uOMP synthesis and translocation. Nascent uOMP
  (U) can interact with itself through the aggregation pathway (purple), bind to chaperone
  (red) before folding into its native state (N), or be degraded (orange). Chaperones
  enter the system as monomers before undergoing oligomerization into a binding-competent
  oligomerization state indicated by subscript (blue). All species are subject to
  a rate of dilution (gray). Chaperones are regenerated upon uOMP folding or unbinding.
  Folding pathways that are assumed to be accelerated by BAM are shown (green). For
  more information of this mechanistic treatment see .
