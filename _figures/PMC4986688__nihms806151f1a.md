caption: (A) Intercellular homeostatic signaling demonstrating; differentiation of
  CD4 T-cells in a context dependent manner; Regulation of mast cell activation by
  direct interaction e.g. through OX40 receptor; Activation of Mast cells and subsequent
  deactivation. And how these signaling cascades interact to stimulate neurons. The
  system is tightly controlled and regulated with numerous checkpoints.(B) Schematic
  representation of modulated immune system in CPPS. 1. We hypothesize that an initiating
  event, such as bacterial infection, drives prostatic epithelial cell damage and
  2. Promotes secretion and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and
  presentation of antigen via APCs 3. These signaling cascades result in CD4 T-cell
  activation which is initially of Th1-type (IFNgamma) but Th17 activation is also
  implicated in the pathway possibly at later stages of chronic pain development.
  4. Data suggests a loss of IL-10 secreting suppressive T-regs and a skewing towards
  Th1/17 responses, this may be attributable to genetic polymorphisms regulating expression
  of these factors. 5. The loss of suppression of mast cells as a result of unchecked
  T-cell activation results in a positive feedback loop in the mast cell resulting
  in; 7. degranulation and releases of proteases such as tryptase, chymase and allergy
  mediators such as histamine., and 8. cytokine secretion (IL6, IL17, TNFa, IL6) resulting
  in recruitment of inflammatory cells. Together 7. and 8. can disrupt the Blood Brain
  Barrier, 9. and/or directly 10. demyelinate neurons. Taken together these processes
  result in 11. neuronal activation and sensitization. The mast cell mediates these
  events and positive feedback loops increase these processes through 6. Further epithelial
  cell damage, 12., is one consequence of such increased mast cell activity. Prostate
  antigens generated from damage to the epithelium in the presence of an activated
  CD4 T-cell response, with unchecked mast cell degranulation and increased numbers
  of CD8 Tcells can result in development of 13. autoimmunity, which only further
  exacerbates these mechanisms.
