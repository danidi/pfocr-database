caption: 'An early event in the cellular response to gallium(III) is an increase in
  intracellular ROS of mitochondrial origin. Changes in zinc homeostasis along with
  ROS generation induce the expression of MT2A. HO-1 gene expression is triggered
  by ROS via the p38 MAP kinase pathway and activation of transcription factor Nrf2.
  MT2A and HO-1 are cytoprotective. The iron-dependent R2 subunit of ribonucleotide
  reductase is inhibited by gallium(III). Apoptosis is triggered through Bax activation
  and the mitochondrial release of Cyto c leading to caspase-3 activation. Direct
  action of gallium(III) on the mitochondria is also likely. Cell death ensues when
  cytoprotective responses are overwhelmed.ARE: Antioxidant response element; Cyto
  c: Cytochrome c; MRE: Metal-responsive elements; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; RR:
  Ribonucleotide reductase.'
