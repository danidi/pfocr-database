caption: Working model. (A) IL-15 receptor signaling in malignant cells (left) and
  normal CD4+ T cells (right). IL-15 cytokine binds its receptor complex α-β-γ to
  drive intracellular signaling, which includes reducing the level of miR-29b in cells.
  Decreased miR-29b releases negative regulation on BRD4 which then binds acetylated
  lysine residues on chromatin to direct gene expression. Upregulated genes include
  oncogenes and IL-15 receptor complex constituents, which drive cellular proliferation
  and resistance to apoptosis. Bortezomib inhibits the pathways that lead to decreased
  miR-29b expression, whereas JQ1 reduces BRD4 binding of chromatin, and both of these
  therapeutic strategies reduce oncogene and IL-15 receptor complex expression. In
  nonmalignant CD4+ T cells, miR-29b basal levels are higher, and BRD4 binding is
  relatively low. (B) IL-15 autocrine signaling loop. The regulatory pathway described
  facilitates formation of a self-sustaining autocrine loop that drives oncogene activation
  and cellular proliferation. This loop can be disrupted through use of bortezomib
  and JQ1.
