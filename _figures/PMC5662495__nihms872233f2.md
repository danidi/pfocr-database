caption: The schematic portraits the components and major events of the extrinsic
  and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic pathway or the death receptor
  pathway is activated by the binding of death receptors to their ligands such as
  FASL (FAS ligand), TNFa, (tumor necrosis factor) or TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand). This promotes the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as FAS-associated
  death domain protein (FADD) that bind to death effector domain containing caspase
  −8 or −10. Formation of this complex results in dimerization and activation of caspase
  −8 that can induce two different pathways to apoptosis; the first one is the direct
  cleavage and activation of executioner caspases −3, −6 or −7. The other one is the
  cleavage and activation of the BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID), the truncated
  product of which is tBID. tBID leads to the interaction of BCL-2-associated X protein
  (BAX) and BCL-2 antagonist or killer (BAK) and induction mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeability (MOMP), thereby generating a crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic
  apoptotic pathways.The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway is initiated by different
  apoptotic stimuli or environmental stresses such as DNA damage, ROS, endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress, irradiation, which activate B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) homology
  3 (BH3)-only proteins leading to translocation of BAX and BAK to mitochondria and
  induction of MOMP. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins prevent MOMP by binding to BH3-only
  proteins, tBID and activated BAX or BAK. MOMP induces the release of cytochrome
  c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) to the cytosol that promotes
  caspase activation and apoptosis. Cytochrome c binds to the apoptotic protease-activating
  factor 1 (APAF1) and promotes the formation of the apoptosome that subsequently
  recruits and activates the initiator caspase, caspase 9. Caspase 9 further cleaves
  and activates executioner caspases −3, −6 or −7 leading to apoptotic cell death.
  Other proapoptotic proteins that are released following MOMP are second mitochondria-derived
  activator of caspase (SMAC; also known as DIABLO) and OMI (also known as HTRA2)
  that interacts with the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) to prevent
  its inhibitory function on caspase −9 and −3.mS29 (death-associated protein 3, DAP3)
  is depicted in the figure as an example of one of the three mitoribosomal subunits
  involved in apoptosis. mS29/DAP3 is predicted to regulate mitochondrial translation
  and apoptosis in various ways. mS29/DAP3 mediate contact with intersubunit bridges
  thereby assisting in monosomes formation and mito translation. mS29/DAP3 is also
  involved in mitochondrial dynamics by regulating the phosphorylation of DRP1 (dynamin-related
  GTPase involved in mitochondrial fission). In addition, mS29/DAP3 can initiate the
  extrinsic apoptotic pathway through its interactions with ligands of death receptors
  such as FASL, TRAIL and TNFα. mS29/DAP3 also co-localizes with FADD and participates
  in the formation of Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC), which exists in the
  cell in an inactive form by the action of protein kinase B (AKT/PKB). DAP3 also
  interacts with FADD through the involvement of interferon-β promoter stimulator
  1 (IPS1), which is a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) bearing protein,
  present in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This complex further recruits procaspase-8,
  thereby triggering further downstream cleavage and activation of caspase resulting
  in cell death. mS29/DAP3 induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through the activation
  of p38 MAPK and the JNK signaling pathway.Two other pro-apoptotic mitoribosome LSU
  proteins, mL41/BMRP that interacts with 16S rRNA and associates with mL65/PDCD9,
  have been also being depicted in the schematic. However, their pro-apoptotic mechanism/s
  of action remain to be unveiled.
