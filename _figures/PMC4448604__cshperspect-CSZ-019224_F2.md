caption: The Drosophila Hippo pathway. More than 40 proteins have been identified
  in the Drosophila Hippo pathway. Growth-promoting proteins are depicted in red and
  growth repressors in blue. Many upstream regulatory proteins control activity of
  core kinase cassette proteins, such as the Hippo kinase (Hpo), Salvador (Sav), Mob
  as tumor suppressor (Mats), and Warts (Wts). The Wts kinase represses tissue growth
  through phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of Yorkie (Yki). Some Hippo pathway
  proteins bypass the core kinase cassette and regulate Yki directly. When nuclear,
  Yki can activate different transcription factors to promote tissue growth. AJ, adherens
