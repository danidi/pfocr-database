caption: Salt overlay sensitive (SOS) and related pathway involved in maintenance
  of ion homeostasis (Na+, K+ and Ca2+) during salinity stress. Phosphorylation of
  SOS1 (Na+/H+ antiporter) by SOS3-SOS2 protein kinase complex leads to Na+ efflux.
  SOS3-SOS2 complex also inhibits the activity of HKT1 (low affinity Na+ transporter),
  restricting cytosolic entry of Na+. The Vacuolar Na+/H+ exchanger (NHX) is activated
  by SOS2 and results in Na+ sequestration into vacuoles. CAX1 (H+/Ca2+ antiporter)
  is involved in Ca2+ homeostasis via SOS2 signaling. All these factors, culminatively
  work together to provide salinity tolerance to plants via maintaining ion homeostasis
  (Na+, K+, and Ca2+). (Adapted from Tuteja 2007).
