caption: Extracellular release of superoxide by NMDA-induced NADPH oxidase activation.
  (A) Superoxide release from mitochondria will first encounter intracellular constituents
  of the cell in which it is enclosed, and can reach the extracellular space only
  be eluding cytosolic superoxide dismutase and crossing the lipid plasma membrane.
  By contrast, NADPH oxidase releases superoxide directly into the cytosol, where
  it can more readily interact with neighboring cells. (B) Cell-to-cell transmission
  of oxidative stress in neuronal cultures in which only a small subset of neurons
  (labeled green) contain functional NADPH oxidase. Application of NMDA to these cultures
  induces oxidative stress in neighboring neurons, as detected by the lipid peroxidation
  marker 4-hydroxynonenal (red). Cell nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (blue).
