caption: Summary model of proposed mechanism of AVD progression. TGFβ signaling results
  in Erk1/2 activation and this in turn stimulates elastase expression ultimately
  leading to the downstream effects including ECM abnormalities and inflammation.
  Refametinib or doxycycline treatment, inhibiting p‐Erk1/2 or elastase activation,
  significantly reverses progression of disease; however, the fact that neither drug
  returns p‐Erk to its WT levels suggests that Erk1/2 phosphorylation and elastase
  expression potentiate reciprocally. AVD, Aortic valve disease.
