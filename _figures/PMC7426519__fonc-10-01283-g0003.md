caption: RANKL inhibition as a novel cancer immunotherapy. RANK/RANKL signaling has
  long been known to play an active role in supporting tumorigenesis through angiogenesis
  and metastasis both of which can be targeted through RANKL inhibition with Denosumab.
  However, blocking RANKL has recently gathered promise as a new avenue for cancer
  immunotherapy which may have complimentary and synergistic effects with known check
  point inhibitors in fighting cancer. How blocking RANKL achieves this is not known,
  although several hypotheses exist. In the thymus, the RANKL/RANK pathway is critical
  for CD80+ AIRE+ medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC) maturation and central tolerance.
  Temporarily blocking central tolerance through blocking RANK/RANKL by Denosumab
  could potentially increase the generation of more aggressive anti-tumor antigen
  T cells. Activated T cells and NK cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) express
  RANKL on their surface, which can interact with RANK+ tumor cells to induce immunosuppression
  in these infiltrating cells. Blocking RANKL with Denosumab would overcome this suppression.
  Tumor-derived RANKL has also been suggested to play a role in converting RANK+ infiltrating
  T cells into immune-suppressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the TME.
