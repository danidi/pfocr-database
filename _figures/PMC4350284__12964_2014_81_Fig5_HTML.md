caption: 'Activated SFK interfere with dimerization and nuclear translocation of pSTAT5A
  in BCR-ABL expressing cells. Left scheme: Classical activation of the JAK2-STAT5A
  signaling pathway downstream of the EpoR. Right scheme: BCR-ABL directly phosphorylates
  STAT5AY694 resulting in STAT5A dimerization, nuclear accumulation and finally target
  gene expression []. In the presence of BCR-ABL, a predominantly cytoplasmic localization
  of pSTAT5A is achieved (i) upon binding to the scaffolding adaptor Gab2 resulting
  in pro-survival signaling through PI3K/Akt activation [] and (ii) through binding
  of the STAT5A SH2 domain to the phosphorylated activation loop of SFK, a mechanism
  that interferes with STAT5A dimerization and subsequent nuclear accumulation. Constitutively
  active STAT5AS710F escapes the SFK-mediated cytoplasmic retention. Flashes indicate
  phosphorylation events.'
