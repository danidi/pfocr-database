caption: Schematic representation of the de novo VG biosynthetic pathway in S. Cerevisisae
  (as designed by Hansen et al []). Metabolites are shown in black, enzymes are shown
  in black and in italic, cofactors and additional precursors are shown in red. Reactions
  catalyzed by heterologously introduced enzymes are shown in red. Reactions converting
  glucose to aromatic amino acids are represented by dashed black arrows. Metabolite
  secretion is represented by solid black arrows where relative thickness corresponds
  to relative extracellular accumulation. 3-DSH stands for 3-dedhydroshikimate, PAC
  stands for protocathechuic acid, PAL stands for protocatechuic aldehyde, SAM stands
  for S-adenosylmethionine. 3DSD stands for 3-dedhydroshikimate dehydratase, ACAR
  stands for aryl carboxylic acid reductase, PPTase stands for phosphopantetheine
  transferase, hsOMT stands for O-methyltransferase, and UGT stands for UDP-glycosyltransferase.
