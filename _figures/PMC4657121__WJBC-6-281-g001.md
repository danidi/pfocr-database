caption: 'Schematic representation of amino acid metabolic pathways targeted in cancer
  therapy. The amino acid metabolism of Arg, Trp, Ser, Gly, Gln, Glu, and BCAAs interconnects
  with major catabolic and biosynthetic pathways shown in gray. Arg is an important
  precursor for creatine, urea, and agmatine synthesis while Trp is important for
  kynurenine and serotonin biosynthesis; Ser and Gly are major sources of methyl groups
  during purine and thymidylate biosynthesis; Leu is a known activator of complex
  1 of mTOR pathway and Gln/Glu provide intermediates for the TCA cycle and restore
  glutathione to its reduced form. Metabolic enzymes catalyzing important steps in
  the metabolism of these amino acids are involved in clinical and/or preclinical
  cancer studies and are denoted in red. 5-HTP: 5-hydroxytrytophan; 3-PG: 3-phosphoglycerate;
