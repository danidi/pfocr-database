  According to this model, sequestration and sequestration-associated events is associated
  with EC activation and TF expression in the microvessels of the brain and in other
  vascular beds. Cytokines, fibrin, hypoxia, apoptosis, proinflammatory molecules
  released by pRBC (e.g. GPI, hemozoin, oxidized heme) or platelets, and monocytes
  might also contribute to TF expression (not shown) at sequestration sites and/or
  paracrinally. Mechanistically, TF initiates the coagulation cascade through binding
  to coagulation FVIIa and the substrates FIX and FX (extrinsic Xase) in the presence
  of Ca2+. In this ternary initiation complex, FIXa and FXa are generated.Amplification:
  FXa, FVa, and prothrombin assemble in the pRBC surface and/or activated platelets
  in the presence of Ca2+, with formation of the prothrombinase complex leading to
  explosive thrombin formation and amplification of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin
  thus formed promotes fibrin deposition and induces platelet aggregation. Thrombin
  also activates FXI to FXIa, which activates FIX to FIXa. Factors IXa, FVIIIa, and
  FX assemble in the membrane of activated platelets and/or pRBC with formation of
  the intrinsic Xnase complex required for production of additional FXa owing to feedback
  inhibition of the FVIIa/TF complex by TFPI (not shown). Therefore, the Tissue Factor
  Model (TFM) for human malaria pathogenesis proposes that both initiation of blood
  coagulation by TF expression and amplification phase supported by pRBC and/or activated
  platelets—particularly at sequestration sites—are critical steps for pathogenesis
  of the disease.Coagulation–Inflammation: Activated coagulation factors FVIIa/TF,
  FXa, and thrombin activate PAR in different cell types including mononuclear cells
  and EC at sequestration sites or paracrinally. PAR activation is accompanied by
  upregulation of molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, COX-2, NO synthase)
  and production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) that have
  reportedly been found in CM. Cytokines bind to specific receptors and, together
  with coagulation factors (and vice versa), perpetuate the inflammatory response,
  which promotes increased interaction of activated monocytes, elastase- and ROS-producing
  neutrophils, activated platelets, and/or GPI-containing pRBC with activated EC.
  The result is a convergence of signals leading to exacerbated TF expression that
  sustains the coagulation-inflammation cycle in different vascular beds. The cycle
  is potentially modulated by physiological inhibitors such as NO, prostacyclin, and
  anticoagulants tissue factor pathway inhibitor, thrombomodulin/protein C pathway,
  and antithrombin (not shown). As a result of pro- and anti-inflammatory events,
  a potentially systemic inflammation ensues, leading to metabolic stress, apoptosis,
  and production of TF-containing microparticles. In extreme cases, organ dysfunction
  and coma occur.'
