caption: Role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in cancer progression. TGF-β is
  a secreted polypeptide that signals via receptor serine/threonine kinases and intracellular
  Smad effectors. TGF-β inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in various cell
  types. Accumulation of loss-of-function mutations in the TGF-β receptor or Smad
  genes classifies the pathway as a tumor suppressor in humans. In addition, various
  oncogenic pathways directly inactivate the TGF-β receptor-Smad pathway, thus favoring
  tumor growth. On the other hand, all human tumors overproduce TGF-β whose autocrine
  and paracrine actions promote tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis. Accordingly,
  TGF-β induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).
