caption: Mechanism underlying Notch ability to promote drug resistance in multiple
  myeloma (MM) microenvironment. Jagged1/2 overexpression in MM cells causes hyperactivation
  of Notch signaling in the bone marrow (BM) milieu, which, in turn, promotes drug
  resistance by modifying both MM cell and BM stromal cell (BMSC) behavior. Indeed,
  (1) Notch activation in MM cell triggered by Jagged1/2 through homotypic interactions
  sustains resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in different ways. Notch can (2) promote
  the expression of the pro-survival factors BCL2, Survivin, and ABCC1 and the chemokine
  receptor CXCR4; (3) up-regulates HES1, which in turn inhibits the expression of
  the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa; (4) promotes the expression of integrin αvβ5, thus
  enhancing MM cell adhesion to vitronectin. (5) MM-derived Jagged1/2 may also activate
  Notch in BMSC, (6) boosting its ability to produce SDF1α, which in turn, by activating
  CXCR4 signaling in MM cell, promotes the expression of the anti-apoptotic factors
  BCL2, Survivin, and ABCC1, improving MM cell pharmacological resistance. On the
  other hand, (7) BMSC activate the Notch pathway in MM cells through their basal
  expression of Jagged1 and Dll4, (8) promoting the expression of cytochrome P450
  and p21, thereby supporting MM cell resistance to therapy.
