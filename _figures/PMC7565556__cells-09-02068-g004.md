caption: A proposed model for the role of truncated PPM1D in the ionizing radiation-induced
  lymphoma. Mice carrying wild-type Ppm1d and Tpr53 activate the p53 pathway and DNA
  damage response upon exposure to ionizing radiation leading to block of the cell
  proliferation or to apoptosis in the thymus. This protects genome integrity and
  prevents tumor development (A). A partial loss of the p53 function in Trp53+/− mice
  suppresses activation of the checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation. This allows
  continuous cell proliferation in the presence of DNA damage leading to accumulation
  of the genetic changes and lymphoma development (B). Mice carrying C-terminally
  truncated Ppm1d fail to fully activate p53 and DNA damage response after exposure
  to ionizing radiation. In most cases, residual p53 function is sufficient to suppress
  proliferation and tumor formation. However, a fraction of cells proliferates despite
  the existing DNA damage which may occasionally result in tumor development (C).
  Combination of a partial loss of p53 and suppression of its function in Ppm1dT/+Trp53+/−
  mice allows continuous proliferation in the presence of DNA damage and prevents
  clearance of damaged cells by apoptosis. As a result, thymic lymphoma develops more
  frequently in Ppm1dT/+Trp53+/− mice compared to Ppm1dT/+ or Trp53+/− alone (D).
