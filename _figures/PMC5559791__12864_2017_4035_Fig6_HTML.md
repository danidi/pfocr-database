caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of RNA-Seq data showed that the canonical coagulation
  system was over-represented by up-regulated genes in abdominal fat of LG cockerels.
  Plasminogen activator, urokinase (UPA) was the only coagulation gene expressed higher
  in visceral fat of the HG birds. The IPA indicates that 16 out of 17 DE genes are
  expressed at higher levels in the LG birds, while only plasmogenin activator, urokinase
  was up-regulated in abdominal fat of HG cockerels. Both the intrinsic (12 AR-DE
  genes) and extrinsic (11 AR-DE genes) pathways in visceral fat of LG birds are highly-populated
  by up-regulated coagulation genes (see Additional file  for functional AR-DE gene
  lists)
