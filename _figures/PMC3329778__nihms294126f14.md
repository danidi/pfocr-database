caption: 'Shown in  and  is a proposed mechanism for the photooxidation and cleavage
  of the alkene group covalently bonded to the porous glass surface. The mechanism
  involves 3 steps: (i) visible light and O2 gas emerge from the opposite face of
  the attached sensitizer molecules for a triplet-triplet energy transfer reaction
  producing 1O2. (ii) Of the 3O2 molecules coming through the tip, 1O2 is located
  near the surface in a free or adsorbed state, which reacts with the alkene group
  with inefficient diffusion to the surrounding solution. There is a loss in mobility
  of 1O2 into the solution phase. Namely, the concentration of 1O2 drops off rapidly
  in the solution phase with increasing distance away from the probe tip due to 1O2
  uptake at the alkene sites and the intrinsic short diffusion distance of 1O2. (iii)
  Silanol or silanoxy anion nucleophilic attack on a C atom of the dioxetane group
  is proposed to take place where the heterogeneous catalyst causes a gain in the
  initial yield of 3 from 1 by a mechanism other than higher loading of the sensitizer
  silane. Shown in Scheme 6 are two different pathways that can be visualized for
  the dioxetane cleavage reaction. The first involves an adsorption of 3 and the lack
  of photorelease due to the resistance to 3 dissolution as revealed by the toluene-d8
  and D2O media at the cap/outer-phase boundary. The second pathway involves the release
  of 3, which effectively increases the diffusion distance of singlet oxygen. In this
  case, the amount of 3 released into petrolatum would probably relate to local drug
  delivery via permeabilization, which is an important finding to distinguish a new
  application in PDT. Overall, we ascertained single digit to tens of nmol of sensitizer
  released, which appears to surpass the objective of 0.25 nmol sensitizer/mL needed
  for PDT, although the quantities needed can depend on the type of tumor targeted.'
