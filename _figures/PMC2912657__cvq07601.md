caption: NF-κB activation pathways. Schematic view of the canonical (left) and non-canonical
  (right) NF-κB activation pathways. The canonical pathway is activated by activated
  TNF receptor via the IKK signalsome, composed of the catalytic kinases IKKα and
  -β, and the regulatory subunit IKKγ. Activated IKK is responsible for NF-κB translocation
  by proteolysis of the IκBα inhibitor. NF-κB activation is mediated by the PKAc phosphorylating
  Ser residue 276 of the RelA subunit. In contrast, Ang II activates the canonical
  pathway by inducing the Carma3·Bcl10·MALT1 complex, known as the ‘CBM signalsome’
  upstream of IKK. Activated IKK liberates NF-κB for translocation. NF-κB activation
  is mediated by the RhoA-NIK signalling pathway converging on phosphorylation of
  RelA on Ser residue 536. The non-canonical pathway is controlled by the IKK complex
  composed of IKKα and NIK. Activated IKKα·NIK phosphorylates the COOH terminus of
  100 kDa precursor of NF-κB2 DNA-binding subunit. Liberated NF-κB2 associates with
  RelA (forming the cross-talk pathway), and RelB, with the latter complex activating
  CCL19 and other unique genes. IKK, IκB kinase; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; NIK,
  NF-κB-inducing kinase; PKAc, catalytic subunit of protein kinase A; Pol II, RNA
  polymerase II.
