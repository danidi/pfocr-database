caption: Schematic representation of apoptotic effects of PEAL on AGS human gastric
  cancer cells. PEAL activated p53 and subsequent Bax induction as well as by modulating
  Bcl-2 protein. The reduce MMP (ΔΨm) triggered by PEAL activates caspase 3, then
  the activated caspases activate Bid, and thus the Bid augments the loss of MMP (ΔΨm)
  through activation Bax. Through the process, PEAL induced apoptosis through mitochondrial
  pathway. In addition, PEAL suppressed phosphorylation of Akt that regulate the anti-apoptotic
  proteins. This PEAL-induced suppression of Akt may be associated with Bcl-2 suppression.
  Taken together, this study suggests that PEAL induced caspase-dependent apoptosis
  by up-regulating p53, and subsequent Bax induction as well as by modulating Bcl-2
  protein, and that Akt is the critical upstream signaling that regulate the apoptotic
  effect of PEAL in AGS human gastric cancer cells.
