caption: Proposed signal pathway by which repetitive deformation may induce intestinal
  epithelial cell migration. The cartoon summarizes a proposed signaling pathway for
  the stimulation of intestinal epithelial cell migration across fibronectin by repetitive
  deformation. The scheme is based on the results from our previous studies on the
  same system, some of which we have reconfirmed here (broken lines), taken together
  with entirely new results from the present study (solid lines).
