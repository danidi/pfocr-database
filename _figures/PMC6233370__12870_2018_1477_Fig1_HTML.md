caption: Impact of phenylpropanoid (PP) intermediates on the growth of 35S::KMD1/KFB20
  (OE#1) plants. Simplified scheme of the PP biosynthetic pathway showing (in red)
  the PP intermediates used for feeding experiments, relative differences in rosette
  sizes of the OE#1 plants and fresh weight (FW) changes in OE#1 plants after 18 days
  of growth on MS/2 media supplemented with the specified PP intermediates. The illustration
  of relative size and the FW difference between the wild-type (WT) and OE#1 plants
  grown on control medium is presented in the shaded insert on the left-hand side.
  The mean fresh weights of treated OE#1 plants ± SD (n ≥ 12) are presented relative
  to the weight of the wild-type (WT) plants grown on control medium. The concentrations
  of the PP intermediates in the MS/2 medium for which the data are shown is noted
  in parenthesis. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase
