caption: A) A proposed molecular model for the accumulation of PTTG protein in the
  thyroid cancer of TRβPV/PV mice(a) The direct interaction of TRβ with SRC-3 induced
  by the binding of T3 induces the formation of TRβ/PTTG/SRC3/PA28γ complexes that
  activate the degradation of PTTG and lead to timely separation of sister chromatids
  at anaphase. (b) TRβPV physically interacts with PTTG but as it does not bind T3,
  it does not interact with SRC-3/PA28γ to activate PTTG degradation. The absence
  of degradation leads to PTTG accumulation and inhibition of mitotic progression
  ().B) A proposed molecular model for the accumulation of β-catenin in the thyroid
  cancer of TRβPV/PV mice. (a) The physical interaction of TRβ with β-catenin is weakened
  by T3 binding and favors the degradation of β-catenin by proteasomal pathways. (b)
  TRβPV strongly interacts with β-catenin and the loss of its T3 binding activity
  inhibits the release of β-catenin from TRβPV/β-catenin complexes in the presence
  of T3, thereby preventing β-catenin degradation. The absence of β-catenin degradation
  leads to β-catenin accumulation and constitutive activation of its oncogenic signaling
  ().
