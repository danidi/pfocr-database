caption: A hypothetical model of PAR-1 and PAR-2 activation by coagulation proteases
  when either EPCR or an unknown FX/FXa receptor is occupied by natural ligands. In
  the absence of protein C/APC or FX/FXa, EPCR is associated with caveolin-1 (Cav-1)
  within the lipid rafts of endothelial cells (left panel in the box). In this case,
  thrombin appears to signal via Gq and/or G12/13, thereby enhancing cellular permeability
  through the activation of RhoA and eliciting proinflammatory responses through the
  activation of NF-κB (). The occupancy of either EPCR by protein C (PC) or FX receptor
  by its ligand results in dissociation of EPCR from caveolin-1 (right panel). This
  process appears to be linked with the coupling of PAR-1 to Gi/o. In this case, the
  activation of PAR-1 by thrombin increases the barrier integrity of endothelial cells
  by activating Rac1 GTPase and eliciting an anti-inflammatory response through the
  inhibition of NF-κB (). A similar protective effect is mediated when FXa binds to
  its receptor on endothelial cells. In this case, not only the activation of PAR-1
  by thrombin is protective, but FXa also elicits a protective response directly through
  the activation of PAR-2, thereby activating Rac1 GTPase and inhibiting the NF-κB
  pathway. See text for more details.
