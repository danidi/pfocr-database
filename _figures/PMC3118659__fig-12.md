caption: Methionine cycle and glutathione biosynthesis. Methionine serves as the starting
  material for a variety of different biologically important compounds, including
  SAM, SAH, and cysteine. Under normal conditions, regular dietary intake of methionine
  offsets losses to the transsulfuration pathway. Under conditions of oxidative stress,
  when the demand for glutathione may exceed the capacity of the cell to produce it,
  there is a net reduction of the methionine pool, leading to an insufficiency of
  SAM and SAH that likely has significant effects on downstream epigenetic events.
  BHMT, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase; MTase, generalized methyltransferase.
  SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine.
