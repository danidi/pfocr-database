caption: 'Strategies to reduce the expression of mutant huntingtin. The expression
  of mHtt causes a range of catastrophic events that disrupt neuronal functions, which
  can lead to cell death: gene expression disruption, abnormal expansions of CAG tandems,
  autophagy disruption, oxidative stress, etc. Many strategies to stop the progression
  of these events have been assayed, such as targeting oxidative stress by scavenging
  free radicals. However, the sources of reactive species remain, and further free
  radicals may be produced. We suggest that removing the cause of the production of
  these reactive species may be a more efficient way to treat HD. For example, ablation
  of the mutant allele of HTT by means of CRISPR will stop the production of mHtt,
  constituting a permanent cure for HD. This strategy lacks maturity; knocking down
  the gene using ssODN or RNAi may be a more practical approach. Antibodies against
  mHtt can be designed with ubiquitine ligase domains, and once introduced into cells,
  can target the toxic mHtt to degradation. Finally, mHtt can be degraded, taking
  advantage of the natural pathway of damaged protein clearance of the cell, autophagy.
  Activators of AMPK, a well-known autophagy inducer, may be considered as potential
  HD treatments, because they can reactivate autophagy in cells stressed by mHtt,
  which is ussually blocked in mouse models and patients with HD. The activation of
  AMPK results in reduced inflammation. Metformin has been shown to be a good candidate
  to reduce toxicity induced by mHtt. This drug is a regular treatment for type 2
  diabetics, so its use has been widely investigated, and it has been shown to have
  few side effects. Metformin shows strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties,
  AMPK-dependent and independent, and induces DNA stability, which may be useful to
  stop expansions of CAG tandems.'
