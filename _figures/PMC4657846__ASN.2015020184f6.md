caption: Sites of complement pathway dysregulation. (A) Loss of CFH inhibition. Deficiency
  or dysfunction of CFH results in excessive generation of C3b, because the AP C3
  convertase continuously produces C3b that is not degraded. (B) CFH deregulation.
  Abnormal CFHR proteins with higher affinity outcompete CFH, resulting in less inhibition
  of the C3 convertase and excessive generation of C3b. (C) Stabilization of the C3
  convertase. Hyperfunctional C3 results in excessive generation of C3b, despite normal
  function of the regulatory mechanisms. (D) Impaired inactivation of C3b to iC3b.
  Deficiency or dysfunction of CFI or MCP impairs degradation of C3b, resulting in
  increased levels of C3b.
