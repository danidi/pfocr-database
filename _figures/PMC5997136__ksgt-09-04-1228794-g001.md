caption: Mst homo- and heterodimers. In their homodimeric form, Mst1 and Mst2 are
  highly active and promote cell cycle delay, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. Mst1
  and Mst2 can also heterodimerize with additional proteins, some of which containing
  SARAH domains (WW45, Rassf; SARAH domain indicated by extension from rectangle),
  and some which do not (c-Raf, Abl, Pdx1, and mTORC2 (via Rictor). In many cases,
  these heterodimers are inactive, and the Hippo pathway is suppressed. Mst heterodimers
  are inactivated due to a variety of mechanisms, including inhibitory phosphorylation
  of Mst kinase domain (Akt), phosphorylation-induced dissociation of Mst homodimers
  (mTORC2), importation of complexed phosphatases (c-Raf), absence of a kinase partner
  for transphosphorylation (Rassf, if bound to Mst prior to activation), and unknown
  mechanisms (Mst1/Mst2 heterodimers).
