caption: ER-stress induced UPR signaling. Summary mapping of the UPR signaling pathways
  and locations in which they occur. Each of the three ‘arms’ of UPR signaling are
  bound by inhibition due to GRP78 sequestration (right, green ER). Under ER stress,
  GRP78 binds unfolded proteins, releasing IRE1, ATF6, and PERK (left, red ER).
