caption: 'Overview of the molecular mechanisms regulating autophagy. Autophagy is
  classified into three major types: microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy
  (CMA), and macroautophagy. (A) Microautophagy is a dynamic lysosomal membrane process
  that directly enwraps and deliver the intracellular portions to the lumen of lysosomes
  for degradation. (B) CMA is a lysosomal degradation process that involves the recognition
  of proteins containing the KFERQ-like motif by HSC70 and transport into the lysosomal
  lumen via the interaction with LAMP2A. (C) Macroautophagy (referred to here as autophagy)
  is a degradation pathway that promotes membrane rearrangement to generate vacuoles
  to engulf the cytosolic components targeted for degradation within lysosome. Two
  distinct metabolic sensors, AMPK and the mTOR complex, control the initiation of
  autophagy. Nutrient starvation in cells triggers the suppression of mTOR by AMPK1and
  the translocation of the ULK1/2 complex (ULK1/2, ATG13, RB1-inducible coiled-coil
  1 (RB1CC1, also known as FIP200) and ATG101) to the autophagy initiation site. Subsequently,
  the ULK1/2 complex leads to the recruitment and activation of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
  kinase (class III-PI3K complex, including Vps34/PI3KC3, Vps15, Beclin 1, and ATG14)
  to synthesize PtdIn(3)P. The generated PtdIn(3)P then recruits DFCP1 and WIPI family
  proteins to the ER-associated membrane compartment to induce the formation of the
  isolation membrane (IM)/phagophore. In addition to the ER, other organelles, such
  as the plasma membrane, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and recycling endosome, also
  supply membrane resources required for the membrane nucleation and the formation
  of phagophore in the initial step of autophagy. ATG9, VMP1, and coated protein complex-associated
  vesicles are involved in the trafficking of membrane resources for the formation
  of the phagophore. The expansion and elongation of the phagophore to form enclosed
  autophagosomes rely on two ubiquitin-like (UBL) conjugation systems. First, ATG12
  is conjugated to ATG5 via ATG7 (ubiquitin activating enzyme 1, E1) and ATG10 (ubiquitin
  conjugation enzyme 2, E2), yielding an ATG5-ATG12 conjugate that binds to ATG16L
  to form an ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L complex. Second, ATG8/LC3 family proteins are post-translationally
  processed by a cysteine protease ATG4 to form ATG8/LC3-I. Then, ATG7 (E1) and ATG3
  (E2) enzyme cascades mediate the covalent linkage of ATG8/LC3-I to PE to form the
  lipidated form of LC3 (ATG8/LC3-PE, also known as ATG8/LC3-II). The enclosed autophagosomes
  fuse with lysosomes to form mature autolysosomes, which eliminate the engulfed materials.
  The interactions of RAB) with FYCO1 and RILP regulate the fusion of autophagosomes
  with lysosomes. In addition, several protein-protein interactions and the assembly
  of protein complexes, including the interaction between UVRAG and RAB7, the association
  of PLEKHM1 with the HOPS complex, and the formation of a protein complex containing
  ATG14L, STX17, SNAP29, and VAMP8, also regulate autophagosome-lysosome fusion.'
