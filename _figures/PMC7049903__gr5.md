caption: Model diagram depicts angiotensin synthesis and pre- and post-synaptic signaling
  pathways.In sympathetic stellate neurons, the classical pathway for Angiotensin
  II (AngII) synthesis occurs by sequential enzymatic cleavage of Angiotensinogen
  (Agt) by renin and Angiotensin Converting Enzymes (ACE). AngII is hydrolyzed by
  ACE2 producing the bioactive metabolite of Angiotensin 1–7 (Ang1–7). We identified
  the presence of precursors and transcripts encoding these enzymes and depict here
  a proposed model for angiotensin synthesis (a). We also identified the presence
  of AngII and Ang1–7 receptors on sympathetic stellate ganglia of human and rat.
  AngII has been shown to elevate intracellular Ca2+ and enhance noradrenaline release
  via actions at AT1R [,]. Conversely Ang1–7-dependent activation of its cognate receptor,
  Mas R, has been shown to couple to NO in the brain and several other receptor sites
  []. In this study, we show that administration of both AngII and Ang1–7 elevate
  cGMP in the rat stellate ganglia. We and others have previously demonstrated the
  importance of NO-cGMP signaling in reducing [Ca2+]i [,] and end-organ transmission
  in peripheral sympathetic stellate nerves [,,,] although the effects of Ang1–7 may
  be biphasic []. Dotted lines indicate intermediates in these intracellular signaling
  pathway. Several effects of AngII and Ang1–7 on the myocardium have been established
  [,, , , , ].
