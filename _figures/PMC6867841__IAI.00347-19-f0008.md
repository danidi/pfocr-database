caption: Schematic picture depicting the effect of the immune factors on cysticercal
  brain infection. Both C5a and TNF-α participate in the recruitment of peripheral
  blood cells (CSF cellularity increases) that may damage brain cysticerci. The exacerbated
  inflammation increases the severity of the disease and promotes the destruction
  of the parasite. Parenchymal parasites are the main cause of late-onset epilepsy
  in countries of endemicity, and seizure crises are clearly linked to the presence
  of an inflammatory reaction around the parasites. TRAF1 participates in the TNF-α
  signaling pathway via the TNFR2 receptor, which in turn participates in the production
  of TNF-α and the survival of activated cells. TNF-α, together with C5a and C3a,
  produced during complement activation, promotes the recruitment of peripheral macrophages,
  neutrophils, and eosinophils, which induce parasite damage through cell degranulation
  and the release of toxic molecules. On the other hand, cysticerci and oncospheres
  can also be damaged by the membrane attack complex of the complement.
