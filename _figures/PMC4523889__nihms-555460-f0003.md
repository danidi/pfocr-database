caption: In a condensed model, aerobic exercise training alters key intracellular
  signaling pathways and mRNA expression related to both skeletal muscle protein metabolism
  (e.g., FOXO3a, myostatin) () and mitochondrial dynamics and proliferation () that
  may be associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Reduced myostatin, a negative
  regulator of growth, appears to promote a positive protein balance through the AKT-mTOR
  pathway and increased muscle protein synthesis (MPS). When phosphorylated, FOXO3a
  is excluded from the nucleus, which inhibits the transcription of ubiquitin E3 ligases,
  MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1. Reduction of MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1 may assist in lowering muscle
  protein breakdown (MPB) and promote a positive net protein balance. Emerging evidence
  () proposes that PGC-1α inhibits FOXO3a expression therefore lowering muscle catabolism
  and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis as observed after aerobic exercise training.
  Collectively, increased mitochondrial dynamics and abundance may lead to improved
  mitochondrial energetics (i.e., reduced ROS, increased ATP), which have been hypothesized
  to modulate MPB and MPS. Aerobic exercise appears to alter MPB and MPS to create
  a positive muscle protein balance and skeletal muscle growth; however, further research
  is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms associated with these hypotheses. ROS
  = reactive oxygen species, ATP = adenosine triphosphate, P = phosphorylation.
