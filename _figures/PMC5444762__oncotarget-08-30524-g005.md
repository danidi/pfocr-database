caption: A. Under normal conditions, growth signals activate the Hippo signaling pathway,
  causing the activation of YAP/TAZ complex. This complex translocates into the nucleus
  to form YAP/TEAD which activates several growth factors, leading to cell growth
  and proliferation. B. Verteporfin blocks the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the nucleus,
  thus inhibiting cell growth and survival.
