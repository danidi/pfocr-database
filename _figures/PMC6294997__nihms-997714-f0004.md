number: Figure 3
caption: Potential CRC risk associated with metabolic incorporation of non-human sialic
  acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) from red meat. (a) Neu5Gc is present in
  beef, pork, lamb, but humans cannot synthesize Neu5Gc. (b) Neu5Gc can be incorporated
  into human cells through the same pathway used for Neu5Ac recycling. (c) Endocytosed
  Neu5Gc is used as a substrate for the synthesis of sialylated glycans in the Golgi.
  Cell surface glycans containing Neu5Gc may be targeted by circulating anti-Neu5Gc
  antibodies and complement, leading to a human specific inflammation, termed xenosialitis.[]
