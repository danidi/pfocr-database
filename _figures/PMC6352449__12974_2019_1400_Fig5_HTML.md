caption: Splenic sympathetic nerve-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway after stroke.
  After the acute stage of stroke, “brain-spleen cross-talk” not only inhibits the
  splenic inflammatory response by activating the SNS (reducing the production of
  inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α) [] but also induces IL-10 production by lymphocytes
  in the spleen through activation of the NE-mediated PKA/cAMP pathway in other inflammatory-related
  disease models [, ]
