caption: 'PP2A positively and negatively regulates the MAPK signaling pathway. Growth
  factors stimulate a complex of proteins: SHC, GRB2 and SOS to assemble on a growth
  factor receptor. This complex activates Ras which starts a signal cascade from activation
  of Raf, to activation of MEK, ERK and eventually the transcription factors that
  activate the transcription of growth related genes. PP2A can activate Raf by dephosphorylating
  S259 and causing 14–3-3 release. PP2A-Bα dephosphorylates S392 of KSR1, which leads
  to dissociation of 14–3-3 from KSR1, essential for MEK1 activation. PP2A negatively
  regulates MAPK upstream by activating Sprouty2, which inhibits GRB2 and subsequent
  RAS complex formation. PP2A-B′β/B′γ can directly dephosphorylate ERK1/2 downstream
  of the signaling cascade, thereby inactivating it. Factors promoting cell division
  are shown in green and those opposing cell division are shown in red. Figure adapted
  from . (see colour version of this figure at www.informahealthcare.com/bmg).'
