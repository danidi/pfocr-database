caption: ALPK1‐TIFA‐NF‐κB axis. Once HBP and ADP‐Hep, bacterial products of the LPS
  biosynthetic pathway, are transported into the host cell, both types of sugars activate
  NF‐κB signaling pathway. ADP‐heptose 7‐P, which is converted from HBP by host enzyme
  NMNAT, interacts to N‐terminus of ALPK1. Activated ALPK1 phosphorylates TIFA and
  induces the TIFA oligomerization with TRAFs, named TIFAsome. ADP‐Hep can also interact
  with ALPK1 in the same fashion, leading to the activation of NF‐κB and inflammation.
  ADP‐Hep has much more potent NF‐κB activator than HBP. ADP‐Hep, ADP‐β‐D‐manno‐heptose;
  ALPK1, alpha‐kinase 1; HBP, D‐glycero‐β‐D‐manno‐heptose 1,7‐bisphosphate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  NMNAT, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; TIFA, TRAF‐interacting protein
  with forkhead‐associated domain; TRAF, TNF receptor‐associated factor
