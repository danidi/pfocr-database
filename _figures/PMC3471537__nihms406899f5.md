caption: 'General mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab: presence of signaling through
  an alternate receptor and/or pathway. Signaling may continue regardless of trastuzumab
  binding to HER2 when other receptors remain active on the tumor cell. The activity
  of certain receptors may also increase as a result of trastuzumab blockage of HER2,
  as a cell survival mechanism (see text for details). Trastuzumab-induced growth
  inhibition in HER2-overexpressing cells can be compensated for by increased IGF-IR
  signaling, resulting in resistance to trastuzumab. In preclinical models in which
  HER2-overexpressing tumor cells are cultured in the presence of ligand, resembling
  what is likely to happen in vivo, trastuzumab does not interfere with HER2/HER3
  heterodimerization and therefore does not block signaling from these heterodimers
  (). c-Met is frequently co-expressed with HER2 in cell lines and contributes to
  trastuzumab resistance through sustained Akt activation.'
