caption: Information flow through the JNK network. Kinases with predicted substrates
  in the JNK signaling network are shown in various colors, and the corresponding
  phosphorylation sites are indicated with similarly colored boxes on the corresponding
  targets. Stacked boxes indicate instances where the same motif is predicted to be
  phosphorylated by multiple kinases. Colored lines indicate either that we have detected
  an epistatic interaction among kinases and substrates or that kinase and substrate
  have correlated scores across sensitized screens (). Curved arrows emanating from
  JNK represent instances for which we predict the existence of regulatory feedback
  in the JNK network. Additionally, we show components of the networks that we did
  not predict as either kinases or substrates, but that have well-characterized functional
  relations with particular components of the JNK phosphorylation network. For example,
  KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras), RAF (a family of serine-threonine protein kinases),
  and ERK are well-characterized components of the same pathway (). Unless predicted
  as a kinase by NetworKIN, JNK regulators are colored according to whether they were
  identified as JNK enhancers (blue) or JNK suppressors (red) in this study. AKT,
  FOS, and JUN were not isolated in this screen. All other JNK regulators are listed
  in the colored boxes and were grouped according to GO annotation (www.flybase.org).
  AMPK, adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase. Numbers in parentheses
  correspond to the number of JNK regulators identified in this study that make up
  each group.
