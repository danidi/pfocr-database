caption: A) Addition of phosphorylcholine (CHOP) to bacterial lipooligosaccharide
  (LOS) reduces surface electronegativity and thus resistance to cationic peptides.
  B) Secretory IgA (sIgA) immune complexes promote M cell uptake of commensal microbial
  antigen. Induction of this pathway is important for induction of host-commensal
  homeostasis. C) Capsular polysaccharide A (PSA) from Bacteroides fragilis induces
  an IL-10 predominant immune response. This, in turn, is associated with protection
  from mucosal damage in murine models of colitis.
