caption: 'Aerobic glycolysis could serve as a metabolic adaptation to promote anabolism
  and visual cycle in the photoreceptors. Lactate represents carbon that is unavailable
  for oxidation and ATP generation. We favor a model where allosteric and FGF-mediated
  promotion of Warburg effect would funnel glucose towards glycolytic pathway enabling
  generation of NADPH- a key cofactor in lipid biosynthesis and visual cycle, and
  nucleotides- required RNA biosynthesis to replenish proteins lost in disc shedding
  and phototransduction. Since methods to quantify selective glucose uptake by photoreceptors
  in undissociated state are not available, its fate specifically in the photoreceptors
  and relative contribution of glycolysis to the ATP pool in these cells is currently
  not decipherable. Other fuels such as fatty acids can be used in the mitochondria
  for ATP requirements (). A byproduct of mitochondrial activity is ROS generation.
  NADPH plays a critical role in ROS detoxification as well. Thus, in this way aerobic
  glycolysis might support sustainable energy generation by the photoreceptors. It
  is worth noting that the blood pressure in choroidal vasculature (that lies behind
  the photoreceptors) is not regulated and is generally considered to provide unabated
  supply of nutrients and oxygen to the neural retina. Given this anatomical feature,
  metabolic regulation in photoreceptors might not be geared toward economizing carbon
  allocation. Thus, aerobic glycolysis might not be a wasteful process, but a metabolic
  adaptation to meet multiple physiological needs.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25946.022'
