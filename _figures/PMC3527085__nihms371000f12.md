caption: ADMA-induces mitochondrial dysfunction reducing cellular ATP levels. As the
  activity of Hsp90 is ATP-dependent, GCH1/Hsp90 interactions are disrupted. This
  leads to increased binding of Hsp70 to GCH1 leading to the recruitment of CHIP.
  CHIP then ubiquitinates GCH1 targeting it for proteasomal degradation. The resulting
  BH4 deficiency induces eNOS uncoupling. L-carnitine supplementation short-circuits
  this degradation pathway by maintaining mitochondrial function.
