caption: Proposed mechanism of action of MR309 to decrease the expression of inflammatory
  cytokines and the hyperexcitability of spinal neurons after contusion of the spinal
  cord. (A) Contusion of the spinal cord of the mouse causes a spinal cord injury
  which results in glutamate (Glut) release by necrotic death of neurons and glial
  cells, medullary parenchyma destructuring, progressive reactivation of microglia
  and astrocytes, and the formation of the glial scar that surrounds the area of injury.
  In this injured area, there is also an infiltration of blood-forming elements, such
  as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, is evidenced. In the neurons and glial
  cells surviving in the spinal cord injury (red box), the excess of glutamate in
  the medullary parenchyma causes a set of molecular changes. (B) The glutamate can
  interact with the NMDA receptors present in neurons and glial cells, causing an
  increase in the influx of sodium and calcium ions. In both cell types, the increase
  in intracellular calcium ions causes the activation of calmodulin (CaM), so that
  the calcium-calmodulin complex in turn activates adenylate-cyclase (AC) with an
  increase in the synthesis of cAMP, the second messenger that causes the activation
  (phosphorylation) of ERK1/2. Also, calcium ions activate protein kinases (PKA and
  PKC), which in turn also facilitate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Phosphorylated
  ERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus and transcription of target genes begins. In
  the case of spinal nociceptive neurons, genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors
  (e.g., AMPA, NMDA, and NK1) as well as voltage-gated ion channels are transcribed.
  While in the case of glial cells (astrocytes and microglia), genes encoding pro-inflammatory
  cytokines are transcribed (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). On the other hand, the
  influx of sodium ions causes an increase in the neuronal excitability of the spinal
  nociceptive neurons, with an increase in action potentials by the spinothalamic
  tract toward the brain. Gene transcription of ion channels and receptors for neurotransmitters
  also facilitates neuronal hyperexcitability. Finally, activated protein kinases
  also cause phosphorylation of NMDA-receptors that will further contribute to central
  sensitization. (C) σ₁ receptor classified as a ligand-regulated molecular chaperone
  is activated under stress or pathological conditions and interacts with several
  neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels to modulate their function and its activity
  can be regulated by endogenous and/or synthetic compounds in an agonist-antagonist
  manner (). Upon σ₁R activation under stress or pathological conditions (SCI in this
  case), σ1R in the ER binds to IP3R to enhance Ca2+ influx into mitochondria and
  efflux into the cytosol. There is also redistribution of σ1R from mitochondria-associated
  endoplasmic reticulum membrane to peripheral endoplasmic membranes to bind ion channels,
  receptors (NMDA) or protein kinases which, in turn will produce a further increase
  in intracellular Ca2+. Therefore, σ1R antagonism by MR309 would result in a reduced
  Ca2+ cytosolic mobilization from ER stores (via PLC and IP3R) and in a reduced extracellular
  entry through NMDAR, favoring the access of negative regulators of the receptor
  such as Ca2+-CaM, finally resulting in an inhibition of Ca2+ dependent intracellular
  effectors such as PKC/PKA and CaMKII. This downstream modulation would modulate
  the ERK pathway by preventing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and consequently, the
  levels of gene expression of NMDAR and proinflammatory cytokines, together with
  a decrease in the overactivity of NMDAR (mediated by phosphorylations at S1303 and
  Y1472). All of these changes would decrease neuronal and glial hyperexcitability
  and thus produce an attenuation in central neuropathic pain development.
