caption: Molecular structure of triclosan and type II fatty acid synthesis. (A) Chemical
  structure of triclosan, 2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenyl ether. (B) Type II fatty
  acid synthesis (FASII) pathway. Triclosan is known to disrupt FASII by inhibiting
  FabI. However, FabV is more resistant to triclosan. ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA,
  coenzyme A.
