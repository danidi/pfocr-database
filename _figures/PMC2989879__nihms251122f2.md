caption: Activation of Foxos in response to oxidative stress is mediated by reactive
  oxygen species (ROS)-activated kinases, such as JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and
  by the ROS-induced interaction of β-catenin with Foxos. Active Foxos suppress cellular
  ROS levels through transcriptional induction of antioxidant genes, such as catalase
  and superoxide dismutase 2 (REF. ). In addition to regulation of ROS levels, Foxos
  modulate both proliferation and cell death, in response to incoming signals, such
  as those mediated through PTEN and Akt. Among key cell cycle regulatory targets
  of Foxos are the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors p21 and p27, which are
  positively regulated by Foxos, and D-type cyclins, which are negatively regulated.
  RB is a downstream effector of both these sets of Foxo target genes. Foxo transcription
  factors also regulate the expression of the transcriptional co-activator CITED2
  (REF. ), which modulates BMI1 levels, feeding into regulation of the RB pathway
  through repression of INK4A. Foxos may also influence RB activity through effects
  on ROS-dependent activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which induces
  transcription of INK4A through Ets transcription factors. In addition, p38 promotes
  cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression, which induces RB-dependent cell cycle arrest
  mediated through transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) or INK4A. Interestingly, E2f
  activity feeds back to induce expression of ASK1, which modulates p38MAPK activity
  by ROS. Direct interaction of FOXO3A with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) has
  been reported to promote the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks, and
  loss of Foxo or ATM leads to increased DNA damage and ROS in cells. The mechanism
  by which DNA damage induces ROS is not clear but may be mediated by increased activity
  of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), which depletes NAD+ and inhibits the pentose
  phosphate pathway,.
