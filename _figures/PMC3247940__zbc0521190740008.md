caption: Model of enhancement of HIV-1 infection as a result of HIV-1 gp41 binding
  to CD74 and subsequent activation of the ERK/MAPK signal pathway. a, gp41, which
  is exposed during membrane fusion, binds CD74 and activates the ERK/MAPK pathway.
  b, gp41 existing on defective virions directly binds CD74 and activates the ERK/MAPK
  pathway. c, degraded gp41 fragments containing loop sequence (like peptide 6358)
  bind CD74 to activate the ERK/MAPK pathway and enhance HIV-1 infection. The ERK/MAPK
  downstream signaling pathway has been described elsewhere (, ).
