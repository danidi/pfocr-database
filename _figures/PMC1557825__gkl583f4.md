caption: The ordering and correlation network diagrams for the significant pathways.
  The Lung-cancer dataset was used for topology-based pathway analysis, and the two
  significant pathways, derived from the BioCarta and KEGG pathway databases, respectively.
  (a) Ordering networks of eicosanoid metabolism; (b) correlation networks of eicosanoid
  metabolism; (c) ordering networks of ascorbate and aldarate metabolism; (d) correlation
  networks of ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Two class-specific networks (MPM
  and AD) are shown for each pathway. The network topology reveals the apparent difference
  between the two class-specific networks, as well as the change of the hub gene.
  In the ordering networks, the hub gene is ALOX5 in AD but is PTGS1 in MPM (a); the
  hub gene is CYP26A1 in AD but is ALDH1A2 in MPM (c).
