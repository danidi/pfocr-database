caption: Putative vasoactive signaling pathways involved in neurovascular coupling.
  Neuronal activity generates elevation of [Ca2+]i in the astrocytic endfoot, through
  activation of InsP3R, which activates astrocytic BK channels. BK channel activation
  leads to the local release of K+ ions from endfeet surrounding cortical blood vessels,
  which activates Kir channels in arteriolar SMCs. Local concentrations of K+ ions
  between 3–15 mM increase SMC Kir channel conductance, causing SMC membrane potential
  hyperpolarization, closing voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC), and leading to
  vasodilation. Higher local concentrations of K+ (e.g. >20 mM) would cause membrane
  potential depolarization, and vasoconstriction. Through an alternate pathway, increased
  astrocytic [Ca2+]i is postulated to activate phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to generate
  arachidonic acid (AA) and subsequently prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) through a cyclooxygenase
  (COX)-dependent mechanism. Activation of EP receptors by PGE2 would lead to increased
  cAMP in SMCs, ultimately decreasing SMC [Ca2+]i and generating vasodilation through
  an as yet unidentified mechanism. Modified from ().
