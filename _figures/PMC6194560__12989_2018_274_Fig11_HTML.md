caption: 'Model of ZnO NPs-induced neuroinflammation in the CNS via the taste nerve
  pathway and the related mechanisms underlying ZnO NPs-induced neuroinflammation.
  ZnO NPs could be taken up by taste buds and transfer to CNS via taste nerve pathway,
  which would further induce neuroinflammation. The cytological experiments show that
  ZnO NPs get into cells in the CNS (microglia and neuron), which induce LDH and Ca2+
  release. The increases of Ca2+ can be elicited by multiple plasma membrane channels.
  Subsequently, the increase Ca2+ activate NF-κB, ERK and p38 signaling pathway, cause
  the release of proinflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammation. Abbreviations: ZnO:
  zinc oxide nanoparticles; CNS: central nervous system'
