caption: A simplified network involved in the invasive growth in haploids. Nutrient
  signal activates Ras2p and Gpa2p, which binds to adenylate cyclase to signal through
  cAMP-PKA cascade. The signaling through cAMP-PKA cascade includes cAMP binding to
  PKA complex to release its catalytic subunits Tpk1/2/3p from regulatory subunit
  Bcy1p. Tpk2p phosphorylates Flo8 and an inhibitor Sfl1 to activate FLO11, a flocculin
  gene involved in invasive growth. Pde1 and Pde2 are cAMP—phosphodiesterases which
  hydrolysis cAMP to AMP. Tpk1/3 exerts a negative feedback by activating Pde1. Activated
  Ras2p can also signal through MAPK cascade to activate Kss1p (MAPK). The signaling
  through MAPK cascade includes Ste20 (MAPKKKK), Ste11 (MAPKKK) and Ste7 (MAPKK).
  The activated Kss1p activates Ste12p/Tec1p, another transcriptional activator of
  FLO11. Tpk1/2/3 of cAMP pathway cross-activates Ste12p/Tec1p. The pheromone signal
  activates GPCR system, which signals through elements of the same MAPK cascade to
  activate Fus3, which brings about degradation of Tec1 and activation of Ste12p.
  The Ste12p binds to pheromone response element (PRE), thereby helping in mating
  specific functions
