caption: p53 activity is induced by many stress-related signals and is under the control
  of various transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. These
  include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and poly-ADP ribosylation, which
  have been implicated in the control of p53 nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization,
  as well as gene target selectivity. Phosphorylation of p53 at specific serine and
  threonine residues affects recognition by the ubiquitin (Ub) e3 ligase MDM2 and
  the related protein MDMX (also known as MDM4). Although the main function of MDM2
  is to decrease p53 stability, MDM2 and MDMX can also suppress p53 transcriptional
  activity by competing with the acetyltransferase p300 for p53 binding. The role
  of p53 phosphorylation in vivo remains to be established, but the negative regulatory
  function of MDM2 and MDMX has been confirmed by mouse genetic models and by the
  use of small molecules, such as Nutlin-3, that block p53–MDM2 interactions. As MDM2
  is one of the direct transcriptional targets of p53, the short and long arms of
  the negative feedback loop resulting from p53-dependent induction of MDM2 and MDM2-dependent
  suppression of p53 activity provide the basis for the oscillatory behaviour of the
  p53 pathway in response to DNA damage. For more detailed information on the p53
  pathway, as well as the consequences of TP53 mutations not covered in this article,
