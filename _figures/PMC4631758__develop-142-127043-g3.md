  description: Gene regulatory networks involved in photoreceptor development. (A)
    A possible gene regulatory network for progenitors in their last cell cycle. Ascl1
    can activate Otx2, although it is not necessary for this event. Thus, other factors
    (asterisk) and/or the loss of Notch signaling are needed to activate Otx2 expression.
    The expression of Ascl1 requires intact miRNA regulatory pathways. Otx2 and Rorb
    combine to activate Prdm1. Alternatively, Rorb and Foxn4 can cooperate to activate
    Ptf1a and push the cell towards amacrine or horizontal cell fates. Transient expression

    require additional co-factors for their expression. Prdm1 and Vsx2 are likely
    to cross-repress each other to stabilize photoreceptor and bipolar fates, respectively.
    (C) A gene regulatory network that simultaneously shows the rod and cone specification
    pathways. Otx2 and Crx are expressed by all photoreceptors. Downstream of Otx2,
    Prdm1 silences the bipolar cell pathway (gray). Nrl and Nr2e3 expression defines
