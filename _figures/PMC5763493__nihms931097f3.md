caption: a | B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling activates the inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) kinase (IKK)–NF-κB signalling pathway through the CARMA1–BCL-10–MALT1 signalosome.
  Although the precise targets of CYLD in B cells remain unclear, CYLD negatively
  regulates the IKK complex and NF-κB. Based on recent work on a short isoform of
  CYLD (sCYLD), it is conceivable that CYLD might also have a positive signalling
  target, possibly one of the SRC kinases (LYN or SYK) as their T-cell homologue,
  LCK, is positively regulated by CYLD. b | sCYLD is encoded by a natural splicing
  variant of the CYLD gene that lacks exons 7 and 8. sCYLD does not contain the TRAF2-
  and IKKγ-binding domains that are required for negative regulation of NF-κB, but
  it retains the deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) activity. One implication is that sCYLD
  is defective in binding to its negative targets (such as IKKγ) but remains effective
  towards its positive targets, which would explain the B-cell hyper-activation in
  mice expressing sCYLD. BCL-10, B-cell lymphoma 10; CARMA1, caspase recruitment domain
  (CARD) membrane-associated guanylate kinase 1; Cap-Gly, cytoskeleton-associated
  protein glycine-rich domain; MALT1, mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma-translocation
  gene 1.
