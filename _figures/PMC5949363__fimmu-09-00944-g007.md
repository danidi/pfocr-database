caption: Schematic diagram of interaction between T follicular helper (Tfh) and B
  cells initiating synergetic effect of IL-21/IL-21R and CD40 ligand (CD40L)/CD40
  to promote plasma cell differentiation and antibody production in EAE. (A) The process
  of antigen-activated T cells and B cells migrating to the B cell follicles, where
  enables B cells receive helper signals from Tfh cells. Red pentacle cells stand
  for dentritic cells and green pentacle ones for follicular dentritic cells. (B)
  At the T-B border, B cells receive signals from cognate CD4+ T cells to activate
  and proliferate. (C) Within the germinal centers (GCs), MOG-specific B cells recognize
  antigen and present it to Tfh cells. After receiving activation signal of MHC-peptide
  complex and ICOSL from B cells, Tfh cells secret large amount of IL-21 and express
  CD40L. IL-21 and CD40L bind to the relevant receptor and ligand on B cells, respectively.
  The ligation of CD40L and CD40 promote the stabilization of NF-κB-inducing kinase
  (NIK), and activate the downstream pathway, which lead the formation of P52 and
  initiate the expression of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1).
  IL-21 receptor activates the JAK/STAT3 pathway and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3)
  promotes the expression of Blimp-1. Moreover, P-STAT3 could also upregulate the
  expression of NIK, probably through stimulating the de novo synthesis of NIK (red
  thin arrow). Thus, the signal provided by IL-21 and CD40L synergistically facilitates
  the differentiation of B cells and autoantibody production.
