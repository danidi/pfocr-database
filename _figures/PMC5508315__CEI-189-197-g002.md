caption: 'Direct, indirect and semidirect pathway of allorecognition. Direct pathway:
  in the direct pathway, intact major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on donor antigen‐presenting
  cells (APCs) is recognized directly by recipient CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Indirect
  pathway: the indirect pathway is characterized by recipient APC uptake of allogeneic
  donor MHC that has been shed through apoptosis or necrosis. This is then processed,
  resulting in presentation of donor antigens in the context of recipient MHC class
  II to recipient CD4+ T cells. Semidirect pathway: semidirect allorecognition results
  from the transfer of cellular membrane components, including intact donor MHC, from
  donor APCs to recipient APCs. This process may occur through mechanisms such as
  cell–cell contact or through the transfer of donor exosomes that fuse with recipient
  APC cell membranes. Recipient APCs are then chimeric for MHC, and are able to stimulate
  both CD4+ and CD8+ recipient T cells.'
