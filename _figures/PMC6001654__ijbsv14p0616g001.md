caption: 'Role of DKK4 in different signal pathway. Binding of TR to nucleotides 1645-1629
  of promoter of DKK4 gene is related to T3-dependent DKK4 transcription. Triiodothyronine
  (T3) and TR up-regulate the mRNA and protein levels of DKK4 expression. 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin
  D3 might be able to inhibit DKK4 expression. There may be 2 mechanisms: (a) bonding
  of vitamin D receptor with DKK4 promoter; (b) mediately by the TCF/ β-catenin-connection
  sites. DKK4 inhibites activity of TCF/LEF and down-regulates nuclear β-catenin entry.
  As the downstream effector, c-Myc as well as cyclin D1 also expressed at a low level.
  Meanwhile DKK4 decreases levels of phosphorylated GSK3β and up-regulates levels
  of phosphorylated β-catenin to antagonize the canonical Wnt signaling. Activating
  canonical Wnt signaling can induce expression of DKK4 as a negative feedback loop.
  DKK4 up-regulates and phosphorylates c-Jun and activates the non-canonical JNK signaling.
  DKK4 can activate the MAPK signal pathway through coexpression with MAPK3.'
