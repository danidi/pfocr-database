caption: In the genomic pathway of estrogen action (i), estrogen or SERMs bind to
  the ER, regulating transcription of target genes in the nucleus by binding to estrogen
  response element (ERE) regulatory sequences and by recruiting coregulatory proteins
  (CoRegs). Estrens were previously thought only to signal through the rapid, nongenomic
  pathway mediated by the ER located in or adjacent to the plasma membrane (ii), which
  may require the presence of adaptor proteins, which target the ER to the membrane.
  Activation of the membrane ER leads to a rapid change in cellular signaling molecules
  and stimulation of kinase activity, which in turn may affect transcription. Figure
  and legend adapted from ref. .
