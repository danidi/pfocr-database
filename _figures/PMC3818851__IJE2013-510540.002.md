caption: Schematic cartoon portraying the apoptotic signalling pathway triggered by
  anandamide (AEA) in rat decidual cells. AEA binds and activates the specific G-protein-coupled
  cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). The CB1 activation results in intracellular ceramide
  accumulation through de novo synthesis. This would lead to subsequent increase in
  phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (p38-MAPK), which
  thus affects the mitochondrial pathway. It is followed by a drop in mitochondrial
  membrane potential (Δψm), caspase-3/-7 activation, and apoptosis of decidual cells.
  This CB1 activation mechanism is believed to play a role in decidual cell death,
  thus affecting uterine remodeling processes occurring during placentation.
