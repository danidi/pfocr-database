caption: Schematic mechanism. The process of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion activates
  endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathway, as reflected by upregulation of
  GRP78, phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1, and promotion of ATF6. Subsequently, the
  downstream factor CHOP is activated, leading to increased expression of cleaved
  caspase 3, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the myocardium. Enhanced myocardial inflammation and
  apoptosis finally leads to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Dexmedetomidine
  pretreatment attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via reducing myocardial
  inflammation and apoptosis through inhibiting the activation of ERS signaling pathway.
