caption: Metabolic map showing genes knocked out for the validation of final drug
  targets, including VV10567, VV10580, VV11175, VV11568, VV11644, VV11691, and VV11866.
  All disrupted genes, displayed as colored lines on the metabolic map, were essential.
  Red and green lines indicate no mutant constructed and insertion mutant created
  with low frequency, respectively. Five essential metabolites are represented with
  their structures. Multiple arrows indicate reactions not shown in the metabolic
  pathway. Metabolite abbreviations can be found in .
