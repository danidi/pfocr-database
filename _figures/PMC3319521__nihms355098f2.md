caption: 'Anti-CD47 antibody may be utilized in several combination strategies to
  more effectively target tumor cells. First, anti-CD47 antibody may be combined with
  a second antibody against a tumor-specific antigen either separately or in a bi-specific
  format to recruit multiple cytotoxic mechanisms: macrophage-mediated phagocytosis,
  NK cell mediated-ADCC, and/or CDC. Second, anti-CD47 antibody may be combined with
  agents that augment macrophage effector cell number and function, including M-CSF
  or GM-CSF, to increase effector cells at tumor sites to enable phagocytic elimination.
  Third, chemotherapy and/or radiation may be combined with anti-CD47 antibody to
  induce pro-phagocytic signals (calreticulin) on tumor cells to augment anti-CD47
  antibody potency. Fourth, given the ability of anti-CD47 antibody to inhibit tumor
  metastasis through phagocytosis by vascular-lining macrophages or direct inhibition
  of chemotaxis, this therapy can be administered systemically and/or infused locally
  at the time of surgical excision of the tumor mass to prevent metastatic spread.'
