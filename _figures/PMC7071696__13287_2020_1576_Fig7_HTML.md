caption: The mechanism graph of the regulatory network of miR-495/HOXC6/TGF-β in the
  progression of OSCC. miR-495 targets HOXC6 and subsequently represses its expression,
  leading to the blocked TGF-β signaling pathway, ultimately impeding EMT, proliferation,
  invasion, and migration of CSCs while promoting cell apoptosis
