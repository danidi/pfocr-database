caption: Hyperosmotic hepatocyte shrinkage induces Nox-driven generation of ROS through
  a signaling pathway involving endosomal acidification, acidic sphingomyelinase activation,
  ceramide-dependent PKCζ activation and serine phosphorylation of p47phox, the regulatory
  subunit of Nox. ROS formation activates JNK which may directly or indirectly regulate
  transcription factors being required for the regulation of apoptotic genes and the
  biogenesis of the miR-15/107 family. Activated miRNAs in turn repress anti-apoptotic
  genes on a posttranscriptional level. In contrast to the short term signaling pathway
  towards CD95 activation (involving EGFR activation, EGFR/CD95 association, CD95
  tyrosine phosphorylation and oligomerization, translocation of the CD95/EGFR complex
  to the plasma membrane and recruitment of the death-inducing signaling complex),
  miR-15a/b/-16 upregulation is a long-term proapoptotic regulatory mechanism. Furthermore,
  ROS is generated by benzylamine through the monoamine oxidase reaction and may inhibit
  the expression of anti-apoptotic genes.
