caption: Interplay between lifespan regulation and brain function. Schematic illustration
  depicts the unique duality of the brain to be both responsive to systemic lifespan
  regulation as well as serve as a central regulator of lifespan. Genetic studies
  have identified the FoxO family of transcription factors, Sirtuins and mTOR signaling
  pathway as molecular regulators that both promote longevity and mediate critical
  brain functions known to undergo age-related impairments such as learning and memory.
  Conversely, the brain has also been demonstrated to promote longevity through neuronal
  regulation, particularly via the hypothalamus region.
