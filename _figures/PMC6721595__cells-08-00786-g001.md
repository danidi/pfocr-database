caption: Human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (hOPCs) incorporate and metabolize
  nervonic acid. (A) GC/MS lipid profiling of the whole brain tissue revealed that
  nervonic acid (NA) ester (red arrows) is not synthetized during EAE in contrast
  to arachidonic acid ester (blue arrows) known for its proinflammatory properties.
  (B) Human phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated MO3.13 cells, as the
  cellular model of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) polarization to mature
  myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, were used to determine an effect of fish oil
  mixture (FOM) supplementation on OPC function. LO was used as the negative control.
  PMA-stimulated MO3.13 cells were incubated with 5% FOM or 5% LO for 72 h. (C middle
  right panel) Sphingomyelin consists of a phosphocholine head group, sphingosine,
  and fatty acid esters which are bound via an amide bound to a sphingosine base [,].
  Fatty acid esters were detected by the GC/MS method. (C) NA, opposite to palmitic
  and stearic acid is synthetized de novo by maturating OPCs. Palmitic and stearic
  acid esters are constitutively presented in hOPCs, and can be directly used for
  sphingomyelin synthesis or can also be used as substrates for NA synthesis with
  cis-13-dicosenoic acid as an intermediate product (blue arrows). During FOM supplementation,
  NA is directly incorporated by hOPCs, while the cis-13-dicosenoic acid-dependent
  pathway is inhibited (red arrow). The rates of acid esters were measured at three
  time points (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h) in lyophilisates of hOPCs incubated with FOM
  or LO or in medium. Data are presented as means ± SD from four independent experiments.
