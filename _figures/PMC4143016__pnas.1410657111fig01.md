caption: Integrated production of fuels, chemicals, and materials from biomass-derived
  lignin via natural aromatic catabolic pathways and chemical catalysis. Biomass fractionation
  can yield streams enriched in lignin and polysaccharides, which can be converted
  along parallel processes. The challenges associated with lignin’s heterogeneity
  are overcome in a “biological funneling” process through upper pathways that produce
  central intermediates (e.g., protocatechuic acid). Dioxygenases cleave the aromatic
  rings of these intermediates, which are metabolized through the β-ketoadipate (β-KA)
  pathway to acetyl-CoA. As shown, residual glucose and acetate present will also
  be metabolized to acetyl-CoA, the primary entry point to mcl-PHA production via
  fatty acid synthesis. We demonstrate mcl-PHA production, which are biodegradable
  polymers. mcl-PHAs are converted to alkenoic acids, and further depolymerized and
  deoxygenated (“depoly-deoxy”) into hydrocarbons, thus demonstrating the production
  of fuels, chemicals, and materials from lignin and other biomass-derived substrates.
