caption: Potential interplay of m6A methylation with cellular metabolic pathways.
  (A) List of metabolites affecting activities of m6A writers and erasers. Grey, activators;
  white, inhibitors. (B) Schematic of metabolic pathways that can influence m6A methylation
  and demethylation processes. One-carbon metabolism produces SAM, a methyl donor
  of m6A modification. S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), the by-product of methylation,
  inhibits writer activity. On the other hand, the oxidative demethylation of m6A
  by erasers needs α-ketoglutarate (αKG), oxygen (O2), and iron [Fe(II)] as cofactors.
  Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle produces co-factors that activate (αKG) or inhibit
  (fumarate and succinate) demethylase activity. Iron is delivered to cells as transferrin–iron
  complex, wherein low lysosomal pH causes release of free iron ions into the cytoplasm.
  Pentose phosphate pathway converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)
  to NADPH, another cofactor for demethylases. R-2HG, R-2-hydroxyglutrate; Met, methionine;
  THF, tetrahydrofolate; Hcy, homocysteine.
