caption: Model for a molecular mechanism whereby cAMP inhibits T cell function. Activation
  of adenylyl cyclase (AC), e.g., by binding of ligands such as adrenalin and PGE2
  to G protein–coupled receptors (R), turns on a regulatory pathway assembled in lipid
  rafts that involves phosphorylation of Csk at S364 by PKA type I leading to activation
  of Csk. Activated Csk then phosphorylates and turns off Lck, and T cell activation
  is inhibited by the absence of ζ chain phosphorylation. Lipid raft association of
  Csk through interaction with phosphotyrosine Y314 in Cbp/Y317 in PAG and of PKA
  by interaction with A-kinase anchoring proteins and/or other docking proteins spatially
  facilitates modulation of T cell activation processes in lipid rafts by this inhibitory
  pathway.

  description: Model for a molecular mechanism whereby cAMP inhibits T cell function.
    Activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), e.g., by binding of ligands such as adrenalin
    and PGE2 to G protein–coupled receptors (R), turns on a regulatory pathway assembled
    in lipid rafts that involves phosphorylation of Csk at S364 by PKA type I leading
    to activation of Csk. Activated Csk then phosphorylates and turns off Lck, and
    T cell activation is inhibited by the absence of ζ chain phosphorylation. Lipid
    raft association of Csk through interaction with phosphotyrosine Y314 in Cbp/Y317
    in PAG and of PKA by interaction with A-kinase anchoring proteins and/or other
    docking proteins spatially facilitates modulation of T cell activation processes
    in lipid rafts by this inhibitory pathway.
