caption: 'The map was constructed using a correlation of pretreatment metabolites
  with change in LDL-C in FR. The color scheme corresponds to correlation strength
  as shown by the color bar. Red: Better response, more reduction of the metabolite.
  Blue: Better response, less reduction or increase of the metabolite. Correlations
  to change in LDL-C are given in the first row and column. The metabolites are rescaled
  (divided by the largest absolute value of them) to be clearer in the map. * Correlations
  significant by p-value, but not significant after controlling for q-value. ** Correlations
  significant by p-value and significant after controlling for q-value.'
