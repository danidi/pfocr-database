caption: Proposed regulatory network directing Dll1 expression in the tailbud and
  presomitic mesoderm. WNT signals induce mesoderm formation and Brachyury expression,
  whose function is essential for migration of mesodermal cells through the primitive
  streak. T acts upstream of Tbx6, potentially as direct activator, and Tbx6 is required
  to maintain paraxial mesoderm. Both T and Tbx6 regulate Dll1 in the tailbud and
  in the presomitic mesoderm, respectively. WNT signals acting through the canonical
  Wnt pathway control Dll1 expression in the paraxial mesoderm synergistically with
  TBX6. (Bold arrows) Proven direct regulation; (dashed arrows) genetically upstream.
