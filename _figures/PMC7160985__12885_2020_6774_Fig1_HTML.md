caption: Selection of data and analysis workflow. Left-most column shows the source
  of data from (GEO and TCGA). Data for SS were applied first followed by data for
  cancer. Next column describes the processing of the data that form a progressive
  filter for narrowing down the number of pathways of relevance. KEGG contains 272
  pathways of which 90 were assigned significant pathway scores by Gene Set Enrichment
  Analysis (details in the main text). The right-most column lists the interpretations
  made at each horizontal step. This figure was generated using LibreOffice Impress
  (Version 6.0.7.3) and exported to .pdf format
