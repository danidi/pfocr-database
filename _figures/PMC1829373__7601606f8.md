caption: Model for MT1-MMP intracellular trafficking. The model depicts two main intracellular
  pathways (I) Rab8-regulated exocytic mobilization of MT1-MMP from a biosynthetic
  storage compartment induced by collagen engagement in invading cells (II) Constitutive
  cycling from recycling endosomes in a stationary cell involves MT1-MMP un-engaged
  in matrix degradation. Additional pathways could involve (III) transport loop between
  the biosynthetic storage and recycling compartments and (IV) endocytosis targeted
  to lysosome degradation of surface MT1-MMP involved in collagen degradative activity.
