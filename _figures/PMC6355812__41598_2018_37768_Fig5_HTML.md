caption: Illustration of TAG metabolism pathway. Phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase
  (PDAT) is only present in yeast and plants. Thus, it is not considered in this study.
  Triacylglycerol lipase is sourced from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that reversibly converts
  Triacylglycerol and Diacylglycerol. WS/DGAT is the same enzyme as in WE synthesis.
