caption: 'The endothelial cell as the maestro of thromboregulation. Non-thrombogenic
  functions shown in green include the thrombomodulin–thrombin protein C system, tissue
  factor pathway inhibitor, plasmin generating system, and the heparin antithrombin
  system. Additionally, there are non-thrombogenic interactions with platelets through
  CD39, nitric oxide, and the eicosanoid pathway. Non-constitutive “activated” functions
  (red) on the luminal side of the cell include upregulation of cell adhesion molecules
  and tissue factor, factor IXa binding, platelet activating factor release (PAF),
  factor V synthesis, and basally: PDGF release and plasminogen-activated inhibitor–1
  release. Abluminal matrix deposition of collagen, vWF, fibronectin and thrombospondin
  are also shown.'
