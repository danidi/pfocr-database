caption: 'Schematic representation of computational framework of 3D vascularized bone
  regeneration within a porous biodegradable CaP scaffold. The model encapsulates
  four biological/physical scales from micro level to macro level: molecular, cellular,
  scaffold, and bone tissue scales. At the scaffold scale, growth factors (BMP2, Wnt
  and VEGF) were released from the CaP scaffold via calcium phosphate degradation
  due to hydration reaction. At molecular scale, the released BMP2 and Wnt stimulated
  the intracellular signaling pathway of MSC and pre-osteoblasts to activate the transcription
  factors Runx2 and Osx. At the cellular scale, each osteoblastic cell underwent migration,
  proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. MSC and pre-osteoblasts migrated
  along the gradient of the concentration of growth factors and oxygen, and their
  differentiation was regulated by Runx2 and Osx. At the bone tissue scale, new capillary
  sprouts, migrating from host tissue, were induced and sustained by released VEGF
  to grow into the pores of the scaffold. The remodelled vasculature could transport
  oxygen to maintain osteoblast metabolism and survival within scaffold pores.'
