caption: Canonical pathways and phenotypic interpretation derived from the microarray
  analysis. Canonical pathways in (a) thymine-treated untransduced cells, (b) transduced
  cells, and (c) thymine-treated and transduced cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  Software checks which genes in the dataset meet the criteria for generating canonical
  pathways, i.e., idealized or generalized pathways that represent common properties
  of a particular signaling module or pathway based on the literature, and accordingly
  categorizes the genes in specific canonical pathways. Each pathway is shown as a
  single “node” colored proportionally to the Fisher's exact test P value, where brighter
  red is more significant. Note that treatment with thymine focuses on the cell cycle
  regulation of the affected cells, while transduction largerly implicates immune
  system responses. However, the combination of both treatments, i.e., vector transduction
  and thymine treatment greatly reduce the immune system effects. (d) Phenotypic interpretation
  of the microarrays analysis.
