caption: Suppression of the H2S-producing activities of CSE and the 3MST/CAT pathway
  by Ca2+. CSE and the 3MST/CAT pathway produce H2S in a steady state at low intracellular
  concentrations of Ca2+. When intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are increased by
  Ca2+ influx or a Ca2+ release from the mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum, CSE
  decreases the production of H2S by 50%, and the 3MST/CAT pathway nearly ceases producing
  H2S. CAT, cysteine aminotransferase; CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; H2S, hydrogen sulfide;
  3MST, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase.
