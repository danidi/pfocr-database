caption: (A) Early events after VV infection, up to 1 hpi, rely on the activation
  of MEK/ERK. Both kinase activation and transient c-fos expression are verified very
  early during virus–host interaction and are independent of the viral protein VGF.
  A structural component of the virus seems to be sufficient for c-fos stimulation,
  since no virus gene expression is required. PKA is also recruited to trigger the
  early signals. (B) Events that occur between 1 hpi until late stages of VV multiplication.
  Sustained ERK1/2 and RSK2 activation lead to Elk-1 phosphorylation, which in turn
  binds, possibly in association with SRF, to the cis-acting element SRE found at
  the 5′-untranslated region of EGR-1 (P. N. G. Silva and C. A. Bonjardim, unpublished
  work) to promote a sustained egr-1 expression. In connection with this pathway,
  upstream events are also required, which include tyrosine phosphorylation and actin
  dynamics. Viral progeny results from an orchestrated programme, which is initiated
  soon after virus–host interaction and requires, at least partially, sustained MEK/ERK/RSK2
  activation.
