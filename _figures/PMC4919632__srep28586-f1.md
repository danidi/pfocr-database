caption: CD4(+) T cells play a critical role during MTB infection by regulating the
  immune response and mediating host protection. Th1 and Th17 cells are the main effector
  CD4(+) T cells. Th1 cells contribute to tuberculosis protection by secreting IFN-γ
  and activating the antimycobacterial reaction in macrophages. Th17 cells are interleukin
  (IL)-17-producing CD4+ T cells with implications in inducing neutrophilic inflammation
  and mediate tissue damage. Antimicrobial inflammatory response primarily begins
  through the initial sensing of different pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  by the pattern recognition receptors of the host. Amongst the innate immune receptors,
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have the unique capacity to sense the initial infection
  and are the most potent inducers of the immune responses. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  is the main receptor mediating the signals responsible for the production of IL-17A
  induced by MTB. The deficiency of TLR4 inhibits Th17 cell differentiation by suppressing
  the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway and promoting
  Th1 cell differentiation by enhancing the STAT1 pathway. As shown in , microRNA-146a
  (miR-146a) is also involved in the host immune response to MTB infection by acting
  as a negative feedback regulator of the TLR/NF-kB pathway and potentially participating
  in regulating IL-17 expression by targeting the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of
  the TRAF6 and the IRAK-1 genes. The activation of innate immunity receptors via
  a pathogen induces the up-regulation of miR-146a expression and will in turn exert
  a negative feedback on TLR4, leading to an inhibition of Th17 pathway molecules
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-6 and TNF-α) and an attenuation
  of the inflammatory effect of Th17 cells.
