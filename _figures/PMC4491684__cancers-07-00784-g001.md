caption: The Hedgehog signaling pathway mechanism. (A) In the absence of the Hh ligand,
  the signaling is inactive as SMO is repressed by PTCH1; (B) In the presence of Hh
  ligand it can bind to PTCH1, which relieves SMO from repression and allows downstream
  activation of the pathway through the translocation of GLI where it acts as a transcription
  factor to the nucleus with the mediation of SUFU and KIF17. Hh Hedgehog ligand,
  SMO smoothened, PTCH1 patched 1, GLI glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger.
