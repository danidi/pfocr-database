caption: Cartoon presentation of proposed cellular and molecular mechanisms for the
  synergistic effects of ATO/AA combination treatment. AA and ATO enter the colorectal
  cancer cells and induce overproduction of ROS that in turn activates the mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway with increased expression of Bax and caspase-3 and decreased expression
  of Bcl-2. On the other hand, AA and ATO activate pyroptosis signaling by increasing
  caspase-1 and releasing IL-1β and IL-18. AA sensitizes ATO-induced apoptosis and
  pyroptosis by ROS-dependent oxidative stress in colon cancer cells.
