caption: 'Schematic diagram of proposed pathway involved in mediating the protective
  role of oestrogen in treating PMS: PMS is associated with increased Ang II-induced
  contraction, increased ROS generation and decreased NO bioavailability, which is
  responsible for the compromised endothelial function. Apart from that, SIRT1 and
  P-AMPK are deficient in PMS. 17-β Oestradiol therapy in PMS condition is effective
  at generating NO via activation of the SIRT-1/AMPK pathway, thus mediating vasorelaxation,
  alleviating endothelial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy. Activation of SIRT-1/AMPK
  pathway thus serves as an excellent and effective approach to treat PMS and associated
  complications.'
