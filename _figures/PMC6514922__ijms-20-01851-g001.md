caption: 'A hypothetical model for the role of thrombomodulin (TM) in mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling: Thrombomodulin regulates the activation of MAPKs
  under various pathophysiological conditions. (A) Under inflammatory and mitogenic
  conditions, TM attenuates MAPK pathways by inhibiting the signaling functions of
  protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), receptor for advanced glycation end products
  (RAGE), and other unknown receptor(s). During angiogenesis, it promotes extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated vessel growth through activation of protein
  C (PC) to activated protein C (APC) and crosstalk with other receptors such as G-protein
  coupled receptor 15 (GPR15) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). (B)
  TM functions as a cofactor for thrombin to mediate the activation of PC to APC,
  thereby initiating anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective signaling responses through
  APC-mediated activation of PAR1, inhibition of RhoA and promoting a protective signaling
  pathway through Rac1. APC trans-activates S1PR1 receptor to enhance the barrier
  permeability function of endothelial cells. CS, chondroitin sulfate; PC, protein
