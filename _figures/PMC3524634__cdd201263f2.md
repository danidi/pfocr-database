caption: Opposing views of the effects of autophagy on hypothalamic food sensing.
  (a) With acute starvation, the increased serum FFAs released from adipocyte lipid
  stores result in increased FFA levels in AgRP neurons and FFA incorporation into
  LDs. Starvation-stimulated autophagy breaks down LDs into FFAs that induce AgRP
  production. AgRP increases food intake both directly and indirectly through inhibitory
  effects on POMC neurons. An increase in autophagy in hypothalamic AgRP neurons therefore
  translates into increased food intake and body mass. (b) With chronic HFD feeding,
  the hypothalamic levels of autophagy are decreased. Reduced autophagy leads to an
  inflammatory response, which includes activation of the IκB kinase β (IKKβ)/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, that increases food intake. In this proposed model, a decrease
  in hypothalamic neuron autophagy increases food intake and body mass
