caption: A graphic model depicting a safeguard mechanism whereby retromer ensures
  unidirectional Notch signaling (purple arrow) from neural progenitor (light blue)
  to neural stem cell (NSC; pink) by preventing cell-autonomous ectopic Notch signaling
  activation in neural progenitors. Retromer (purple) normally interacts with Notch
  (green) and retrieves the pool of hypoubiquitinated Notch evading the ESCRT (cyan)-lysosomal
  degradation pathway and sends it back to the cell surface (left panel). Upon retromer
  dysfunction, hypoubiquitinated Notch is accumulate in MVBs and aberrantly cleaved
  by γ-secretase (brown) in a ligand (light purple)-dependent manner, causing neural
  progenitor-originated tumorigenesis (right panel).
