caption: Molecular signaling involved in nephrogenesis. The development of the kidney
  is coordinated by the complex interactions among numerous transcription/growth factors
  and intracellular signaling molecules. The most important signaling pathway is GDNF-RET,
  which controls metanephric mesenchyme (MM) development and ureteric bud (UB) outgrowth
  and branching. GDNF is secreted by the MM and binds a receptor complex that includes
  RET and a membrane-tethered GFRA1 co-receptor located on the nephric duct (ND).
  GDNF signals through the RET complex to promote UB invasion of the MM. GDNF binding
  to the RET receptor leads to activation of signaling pathways promoting proliferation
  and differentiation. There are several key transcriptional regulators including
  Odd1, Eya1, and Six1/Six2 identified as being necessary for interaction between
  UB and MM. Loss of function in any of a number of genes including Pax2, Eya1, Six1,
  Wt1, and Hoxa11/Hoxd1 (and others) leads to a loss of Gdnf expression and either
  renal agenesis or renal hypoplasia. Likewise, mice knockouts of Ret or Gfra1 result
  in failure of the UB to form and can also result in renal agenesis. In this context,
  any alterations in the timing, expression, and/or function of these genes/proteins
  have the ability to influence nephron composition on a continuum from low to high.
