caption: NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy pathway. (a) Iron (Fe) is sequestered in 24-mer
  ferritin complexes containing ferritin heavy and light chains. NCOA4 recognizes
  ferritin and delivers it to an incipient autophagosome. The molecular nature of
  the NCOA4-autophagosome interaction is unclear but likely involves interaction with
  LC3-II potentially via a non-canonical LIR motif. Degradation of ferritin in an
  autolysosome releases iron, which is exported to the cytosol. (b) NCOA4 levels and
  thereby ferritinophagy are regulated by iron levels in the cell. Under high iron/iron
  replete conditions, NCOA4 is recognized by HERC2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in an
  iron-dependent manner and targeted for proteasomal degradation. In tandem, NCOA4
  is also targeted for autophagic degradation. A lower level of NCOA4 therefore decreases
  flux through the ferritinophagy pathway. (c) Liberated iron can be used in many
  iron-dependent processes including heme synthesis, which is required for hemoglobin
  synthesis during erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy
  is important for other physiological processes such as maintenance of liver iron
  homeostasis. Further research will be required to understand the role of NCOA4 in
  CNS development and pathophysiology of iron-associated neurodegenerative disorders.
