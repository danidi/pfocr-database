caption: Model showing fusion inhibitors in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. In synaptic
  neurotransmitter release, the fusion regulator Munc18-1 binds to the syntaxin monomer
  and blocks the formation of the t-SNARE complex on the plasma membrane. Complexin,
  on the other hand, recognizes the partially zippered trans-SNARE complex and arrests
  fusion at a late step of the fusion pathway. Our research established that synip
  negatively regulates the vesicle fusion reaction of GLUT4 exocytosis by binding
  the t-SNARE complex and preventing the initiation of trans-SNARE assembly. The regulatory
  mechanism of synip is distinct from how Munc18-1 and complexin arrest vesicle fusion.
  It should be noted that, in addition to their inhibitory functions, Munc18-1 and
  complexin also positively regulate membrane fusion.
