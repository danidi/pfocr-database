caption: The protumor role of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. A Chronic activation
  of STING creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Continuous STING activation
  in turn impedes the original antitumor immunity by increasing the infiltration of
  MDSCs, Tregs and expression of PD-L1, IDO and CCR2, while decreasing the infiltration
  of NK cells, DCs and T cells. B The function of the STING signaling in tumor metastasis.
  B-1 delineates the cell autonomous pro-metastasis effect, and B-2, B-3 depict the
  cell nonautonomous pro-metastasis effect
