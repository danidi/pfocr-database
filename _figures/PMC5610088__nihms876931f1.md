caption: Phospholipid biosynthetic pathways in Streptomyces. Parts of the biosynthetic
  pathway with experimental evidence are shown in blue, those with only bioinformatic
  predictions are shown in purple, and the reactions for which there is not enough
  evidence for any gene associated with them are shown in red. Phospholipids that
  have been identified in Streptomyces lipid extracts are highlighted in blue rectangles.
  G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; LPA, lyso-phosphatidic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; CDP-DAG,
  cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol; PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PGP, phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin;
  MLCL, monolyso-cardiolipin; DLCL, dilyso-cardiolipin; PIP, phosphatidylinositol-phosphate;
