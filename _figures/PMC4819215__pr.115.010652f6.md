caption: 'Ca2+ desensitization: ACh stimulation of muscarinic receptors on the vascular
  endothelium leads to the production of NO, and NO diffuses into smooth muscle cells
  to activate guanylate cyclase. The NO/cGMP signaling pathway relaxes smooth muscle
  by both decreasing intracellular Ca2+ and activating MLC phosphatase, which results
  in Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile filaments (see text for details).'
