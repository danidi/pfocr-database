caption: A model of the regulation of neurexin post-translational modifications by
  FAM19A1-A4. The schematic depicts a presynaptic terminal containing Nrxn1β as an
  exemplary neurexin isoform that was exported to the cell surface either in the absence
  (left) or presence (right) of FAM19A1-A4. Binding of FAM19A1-A4 early in the secretory
  pathway down-regulates subsequent modifications by O-glycans or heparan sulfate.
  β, β-Nrxn-specific sequence; LNS, sixth LNS domain that is the only LNS-domain of
  β-neurexins; SV, synaptic vesicles.
