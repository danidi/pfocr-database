caption: 'FFAs are taken up by a family of plasma membrane proteins (fatty acid transporter
  protein (FATP1), fatty acid translocase (CD36)) and in cytoplasm associated with
  fatty acid binding protein (FABP). FFAs are esterified to acyl-CoA via fatty acyl-CoA
  synthetase. The resulting acyl-CoA is then transported through the inner membrane
  of the mitochondrion, via the exchange of CoA for carnitine by carnitine palmitolyltransferase
  I (CPT I). Acylcarnitine is then transported by carnitine acylcarnitine translocase
  into the mitochondrial matrix where a reverse exchange takes place through the action
  of carnitine palmitoyltransferae II (CPT II). Once inside the mitochondrion acyl-CoA
  is a substrate for the β-oxidation pathway, resulting in acetyl-CoA production.
  Each round of β-oxidation produces 1 molecule of NADH, 1 molecule of FADH2 and 1
  molecule of acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, where it is further oxidized
  to CO2 with the concomitant generation of 3 molecules of NADH, 1 molecule of FADH2
  and 1 molecule of ATP. Acetyl-CoA, which is formed in the mitochondrial matrix,
  can be transferred into the cytoplasm with participation of carnitine, carnitine
  acetyltransferases and carnitine acetyltranslocase (carnitine acetylcarnitine carrier
  complex, CAC). Glucose (GLU) is taken up by glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) and enters
  the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, which converts glucose via a series of reactions into
  2 molecules of pyruvate (PYR). As a result of these reactions, a small amount of
  ATP and NADH are produced. G6P – glucose 6-phosphate; HK – hexokinase; PFK – phosphofructokinase;
  GLY – glycogen; F1,6diP – fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; GAPDH – glyceralhehydephosphate
  dehydrogenase; 1,3DPG – 1,3 diphosphoglycerate. The redox potential of NADH is transferred
  into the mitochondrial matrix via the malate–aspartate shuttle. OAA – oxaloacetate;
  Glut – glutamate; αKG –α-ketoglutarate; ASP – aspartate. Malate generated in the
  cytosol enters the matrix in exchange for α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and can be used
  to produce matrix NADH. Matrix oxaloacetate (OAA) is returned to the cytosol by
  conversion to ASP and exchange with glutamate (Glut). Most of the metabolic energy
  derived from glucose can come from the entry of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle and
  oxidative phosphorylation via acetyl-CoA production. NADH and FADH2 are oxidized
  in the respiratory chain (complexes I, II, III and IV). These pathways occur under
  aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted to lactate.
  Feedback regulation of substrate supply occurs in the following way. A glucose–fatty
  acid cycle (Randle hypothesis): if glucose and FFAs are both present, FFAs inhibit
  the transport of glucose across the plasma membrane, acyl-CoA oxidation increases
  the mitochondrial ratios of acetyl-CoA/CoA and of NADH/NAD+, which inhibit the pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, and increased citrate (produced in the Krebs cycle)
  can inhibit phosphofructokinase (PFK). These changes would slow down oxidation of
  glucose and pyruvate (PYR) and increase glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which would inhibit
  hexokinase (HK), and decrease glucose transport. The mitochondrial creatine kinase
  (miCK) catalyses the direct transphosphorylation of intramitochondrially produced
  ATP and cytosolic creatine (Cr) into ADP and phosphocreatine (PCr). ADP enters the
  matrix space to stimulate oxidative phosphorylation, while PCr is transferred via
  cytosolic Cr/PCr shuttle to be used by functional coupling of CK with ATPases (acto-myosin
  ATPase and ion pumps); If the workload increases, ATP production and respiration
  are increased due to feedback signalling via the creatine kinase (CK) system, leading
  to decreased mitochondrial content of acetyl-CoA, which is transferred into the
  cytoplasm with participation of carnitine acetyl carrier (CAC). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC) is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, a potent inhibitor
  of CPT I, with the aim to avoid overloading the mitochondria with fatty acid oxidation
  intermediates, when the workload is decreased. Inactivation of ACC occurs via phosphorylation
  catalysed by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Phosphorylation and inactivation
  of ACC leads to a decrease in the concentration of malonyl-CoA. A fall in malonyl-CoA
  levels disinhibits CPT I, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation. Malonyl-CoA
  is also converted back into acetyl-CoA in the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) reaction.
  Increase in the workload increases the rate of acetyl-CoA consumption and that automatically
  decreases the malonyl-CoA content. The ACC and MCD regulation occur under stress
  conditions when the AMP/ATP ratios are increased, but are unlikely to occour under
  normal work-load conditions of the heart. Thus, AMPK may be envisaged as a modulator,
  under situations of cellular stress, rather than as a master on–off switch of fatty
  acid oxidation.'
