caption: Schematic overview of NO-promoted CSC-like phenotypes through stabilization
  of Oct4 cellular level by dissociating it from the Cav-1:Oct4 degradation complex.
  A, in the absence of NO, Cav-1 binds to Oct4 and enhances its degradation through
  the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. The reduction of cellular Oct4 level by Cav-1
  leads to a decrease in stemness-related gene expression, which diminishes CSC-like
  phenotypes. B, in the presence of NO, NO promotes phosphorylation of Cav-1 (tyrosine
  14) through the activation of Akt signaling. Because Cav-1 is phosphorylated, Oct4
  is dissociated from the Cav-1 complex. The liberated Oct4 accumulates in the nucleus
  and enhances the expression of stemness-related genes, which promote CSC-like phenotypes.
