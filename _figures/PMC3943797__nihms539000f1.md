caption: CVB3 infection leads to increased TF expression and activation of coagulation.
  Thrombin mediated PAR-1 cleavage contribute to TLR3 dependent IFN-β due to increase
  in p38 activation on cardiac cells, such as cardiac fibroblasts. Additionally, PAR-1
  can be activated by MMP13 and enhances TLR3 signaling during viral infection.
