caption: Apoptosis and Calcium (Ca2+) dynamics in cancer. Apoptosis is the best-characterized
  and studied programmed cell death. In the extrinsic pathway, extracellular ligands
  determine the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex that activates the
  caspases cascade. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is characterized by permeabilization
  of the mitochondria that allows the release of cytochrome c (cyt-c) and other apoptogenic
  factors in the cytosol. Once released, these factors bind apoptotic protease activating
  factor 1 (APAF1) and form a multiprotein complex called the apoptsome that recruits
  and activates the caspases. Ca2+ has a major role during intrinsic apoptosis, and
  excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation may trigger apoptosis. Different proteins
  were found to control apoptotic machinery by regulating Ca2+ flux between endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) members
  block apoptotic program by lowering Ca2+ levels in the ER, thereby attenuating subsequent
  Ca2+ release. p53 localizes at the ER–mitochondria interface to improve Ca2+ dynamics
  and apoptosis by increasing sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps
  activities. Additionally, the tumor suppressors promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML),
  BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) move
  to the mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs) to regulate Ca2+-dependent apoptosis.
  They determine the activation of Ca2+ release from the ER by modulating the activity
  of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 3 (IP3R3). Mutations or loss of these tumor
  suppressors are frequently found in diverse human tumor samples, where they lead
  to a reduction in Ca2+ homeostasis and the apoptosis rate, favoring cellular proliferation,
  tumor growth, maintenance, and metastasis. Created with BioRender.com.
