caption: Cell localization of the main thiamin dependent-enzymes and its participation
  in metabolic pathways. Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP), the active form of thiamin,
  works as an essential coenzyme for the enzymes involved in photosynthesis in chloroplasts,
  pentose phosphate pathway, and alcoholic fermentation in cytoplasm, as well as in
  ATP synthesis in the participation in oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and
  tricarboxylic acid cycle in mitochondrial central metabolism. Thiamin has also been
  shown to be involved in the acclimation responses to abiotic stresses; photoperiod;
  and working directly as an antioxidant, scavenging ROS; a protection molecule; and
  indirectly by contributing to the cell energy poll, conferring the cell the necessary
  metabolic flexibility to acclimate to new conditions. The thiamin-dependent enzymes
  shown are α-ketose transketolase (TK); 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS);
  acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS); pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH); 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
  (OGDH); and branched chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase (BCOADH). MEP, methylerythritol
  pathway.
