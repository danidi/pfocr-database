caption: 'Comprehensively, PDGF-BB mediated protection on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
  from ITP patients. (A): PDGF-BB protects MSC-ITP against apoptosis and senescence.
  In MSC-ITP, p53 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and altered Bcl-2
  family proteins, which promotes caspase-9 and then caspase-3 activation. P53 also
  upregulated the expression of FasL and Fas, activating caspase-8 and caspase-3 and
  causing apoptosis in MSCs. P53 increased the expression of p21 and caused cell cycle
  arrest. PDGF-BB is capable of protecting MSC-ITP against senescence and apoptosis
  by inhibiting the p53/p21 pathway. (B): PDGF-BB restores the immunosuppressive capacity
  of MSC-ITP. PDGF-BB reversed the impaired capacity for inhibiting T-cell proliferation
  and inducing Tregs in MSC-ITP. PDGF-BB also reversed the shift in the Th1/Th2 cytokine
  balance and maintained the capacity for suppressing the production of anti-GPIIb-IIIa
  antibodies in the coculture system. Abbreviations: Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bcl-2,
  B-cell lymphoma 2; Fas, factor-associated suicide; FasL, Fas ligand; GP, glycoprotein;
  MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; MSC-ITP, MSCs from patients with immune thrombocytopenia;
  PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Th, T helper cell.'
