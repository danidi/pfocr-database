caption: a | Membrane-bound β-catenin links cadherin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton,
  and in non-transformed epithelial cells β-catenin is primarily localized to E-cadherin
  complexes. Cytoplasmic β-catenin is a downstream component of the Wnt pathway; in
  the absence of Wnt (upper panel), cytosolic β-catenin remains bound within a multi-protein
  inhibitory complex comprised of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), the adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor protein and axin. Under unstimulated conditions,
  β-catenin is constitutively phosphorylated (P) by GSK3β, ubiquitylated and degraded.
  Binding of Wnt to its receptor, Frizzled (FRZ; lower panel), activates dishevelled
  (DSH) and Wnt co-receptors, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5)
  and LRP6, which then interact with axin and other members of the inhibitory complex,
  leading to the inhibition of the kinase activity of GSK3β. These events inhibit
  the degradation of β-catenin, leading to its nuclear accumulation and formation
  of heterodimers with the transcription factor lymphocyte enhancer factor/T cell
  factor (LEF/TCF), resulting in the transcriptional activation of target genes that
  influence carcinogenesis. b | Injection of CagA results in the dispersal of β-catenin
  from β-catenin–E-cadherin complexes at the cell membrane, allowing β-catenin to
  accumulate in the cytosol and nucleus. CagA, potentially by binding MET or other
  H. pylori constituents such as OipA, VacA and peptidoglycan (PGN) as well as tumour
  necrosis factor-α (TNFα), which is produced by infiltrating macrophages, can activate
  PI3K, leading to the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β. This liberates β-catenin
  to translocate to the nucleus and upregulate genes, leading to increased proliferation
  and aberrant differentiation; TNFR, TNF receptor.
