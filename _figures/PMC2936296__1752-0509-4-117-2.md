caption: The RIG-I signalling pathway. A) KEGG pathway diagram of the RIG-I pathway.
  B) A network of all InnateDB annotated molecular interactions between components
  of the RIG-I pathway highlights the additional level of complexity that is not conveyed
  in the KEGG diagram. Edges coloured red represent phosphorylation interactions;
  edges coloured blue represent protein-DNA interactions. C) A network of all InnateDB
  annotated molecular interactions between components of the RIG-I pathway and all
  other annotated interaction partners reveals the potential for cross-talk between
  RIG-I pathway components and many other molecules and pathways. Networks were constructed
  using InnateDB (http://www.innatedb.com/batchSearchInit.jsp) and were visualised
  in Cytoscape 2.6.3 using the Cerebral plugin.
