caption: 'Schematic of involvement of mitophagy in the transportation of amorphous
  calcium phosphate (ACP) precursors from the mitochondria to the extracellular matrix
  in stem cells with osteogenic potential. Calcium and phosphate ions are sequestered
  into the mitochondria matrices and accumulate as ACP granules. When ACP accumulation
  reaches a threshold, the mitochondria swell and lose membrane potential, resulting
  in PINK1 accumulation on their outer membrane. The latter recruits PARKIN from the
  cytosol to the damaged mitochondria. PARKIN ubiquitylates mitochondrial proteins
  and causes the ACP‐overloaded mitochondria to be engulfed by autophagosomes through
  p62 and LC3. The autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes to become autolysosomes.
  Digestion of the dysfunctioned mitochondria by autolysosomal acidification releases
  the intramitochondrial ACP droplets, which coalesce into larger ACP granules within
  the autolysosomes. The coalesced ACP granules are subsequently transferred from
  the autolysosomes to the ECM via exocytosis. Infiltration of ACP into collagen fibrils
  results in intrafibrillar mineralization of the extracellular matrix. During this
  process, the BMP/Smad signaling pathway is activated to support the ACP transportation
  role of mitophagy in cell‐mediated osteogenesis. Abbreviations for pathway modification
  within the cytosol: solid black arrow: direct stimulatory modification; dashed black
  arrow: tentative stimulatory modification; dotted black arrow: joining of subunits
  and translocation; solid folding line with arrow: transcriptional stimulatory modification;
  solid line with right vertical bar: direct inhibitory modification. BMRR I and BMRR
