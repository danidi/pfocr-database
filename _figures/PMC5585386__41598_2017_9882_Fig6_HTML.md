caption: 'Schematic representation of a B. arvensis oil biosynthetic pathway rich
  in stearidonic acid. The relative expression of genes involved in fatty acid desaturation
  and triacylglycerol biosynthesis in developing seeds(6, 12, 18, 24, 30 DAF) and
  leaves of B. arvensis were analysed through qRT-PCR. Alpha-tubulin and clathrin
  adaptorcomplex (CAC) were used as internal reference genes. Fold change is represented
  as log2 in a heat map. Stage-1(6 DAF) was used as a calibrator and its expression
  was set as 1.0. ACP: acyl-Carrier protein; GL: galactolipid; G3P: sn-glycerol-3
  phosphate; PA: phosphatidic acid; LPA; lysophosphatidic acid; LPC: lysophosphatidylcholine;
  DAG: diacylglycerol; TAG: triacylglycerol; PC: phosphatidylcholine. For full name
  of genes, see Table .'
