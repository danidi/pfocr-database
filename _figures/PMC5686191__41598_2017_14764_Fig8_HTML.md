caption: Possible mechanisms underlying how YAP regulated LRP1 by promoting proliferation
  and metastasis of melanoma cells and also reducing apoptosis. These pathways are
  involved in several processes of tumorigenesis and progression. Yes-associated Protein
  (YAP) can stimulate the expression of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  1(LRP1) via binding to the LRP1-promoter.LRP1 can activates the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase signaling pathway (MAPK), which can increase the transcriptional
  levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9. MMP2/9 can drive cancer cell
  proliferation and invasion.LRP1 activates the serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT)
  signaling pathway and insulin receptor (IR), which inhibits cancer cell apoptosis.
