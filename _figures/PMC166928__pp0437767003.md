caption: Schematic representation of isoprene biosynthesis pathway and possible coupling
  to cytosolic Glc metabolism and IPP. Also noted are the sites of action of the inhibitor
  fosmidomycin () and of the isotopic discrimination by DXS. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate.
