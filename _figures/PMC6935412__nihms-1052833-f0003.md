caption: Increased IFNβ enhanceosome components in lupus B cells. A. Uncleared ACs
  or AC-autoantibody immune complexes with DNA- or RNA-containing proteins signals
  BCR and the TLR3, 7, 9 endosome in B cells. Both IRF3 and IRF7 are critical for
  type I IFN induction and amplification following TLR signaling. Alternatively, defects
  in clearance of endogenous DNA/RNA could activate cytosolic sensors through the
  cGAS/STING pathway. This all leads to increased NF-kB, IRF7 and IRF3 which are important
  co-factors for the IFNβ enhanceosome. The IFNβ promoter contains four positive regulatory
  domains (PRD I-IV), which are occupied by overlapping transcription factor complexes.
  IRF3 and IRF7 bind PRDI and III; the AP-1 heterodimer of ATF-2 and c-Jun binds PRDIV;
  and the NF-κB p50-RelA heterodimer binds PRDII. Polymorphisms in IFNβ enhanceosome
  genes and aberrant induction of nucleic acid sensing pathways may contribute to
  elevated IFNβ expression, which leads to production of other IFN subtypes and amplification
  of nucleic acid sensing responses. B. Increased expression of IFNβ enhanceosome
  components in lupus B cells. Super-Resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy
  (SIM) imaging analysis showing the colocalization of NF-ĸB p65 and IRF7 in DAPIdim
  open chromatin region in B cells derived from lupus prone BXD2 mice but not normal
  B6 mice. As SLE B cells express endogenous IFNβ, these results suggest there is
  increased stimulation of the IFNβ enhanceosome.
