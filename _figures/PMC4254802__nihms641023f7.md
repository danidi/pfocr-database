caption: Model of TACE activation by MAPK signaling. Without MAPK signaling, cell
  surface TACE is primarily present as dimer and readily associates with TIMP3, possibly
  binding to the TACE dimer in a 2:2 ratio. TACE is therefore only partially active
  and its activity depends on the availability of TIMP3 (left). Upon p38 or ERK MAPK
  pathway activation, the cytoplasmic domain of TACE is phosphorylated, resulting
  in rapidly increased cell surface presentation (wider arrows), higher abundance
  of TACE monomers, and lower abundance of dimers. The lack of dimerization results
  in lower association of TACE with TIMP3 and the activation of TACE (right). The
  activity of TACE thus results from the dynamic balance between TACE dimers and monomers
  at the cell surface and the resulting differences in TIMP3 binding efficiency.
