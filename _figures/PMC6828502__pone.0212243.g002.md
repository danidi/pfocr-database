caption: 'Three levels of constructions were created (A), (B), (C). Level (A) deals
  with the DNA products generated either by PCR using the appropriate primers or by
  direct synthesis of codon optimized (for Escherichia coli expression) DNA of the
  depicted organism. Level (B) consists of single modules into Dual expression vectors
  (Duet). Level (C) contains the dual gene expression vectors. Non-arrowed lines indicate
  the appropriately named restriction sites. Letter symbols correspond to suitable
  sequences: PT7, T7 Promoter; O, Lac Operator; T, Termination, E.c., E. coli.'
