caption: A schematic model of the S. eriocheiris ALP interaction with the EGF domain
  protein to facilitate bacterial infection of the host cell when the EGFR pathway
  was effected by ALP. On the left is the normal EGFR pathway, and on the right is
  the main EGFR signaling like RhoA/ROCK (Rho kinase), MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)/ERK (extracellularsignal-regulated
  kinase), etc. were decreased duo to competitive binding of ALP to EGF. The small
  GTPase RhoA has been identified as a negative regulator of EGFR endocytosis via
  its effector Rho kinase (ROCK). The fibulin7 protein duo to has servels EGF domain
  act as an adhesion sites of the bacteria. For abbreviations and explanations, see
  the text.
