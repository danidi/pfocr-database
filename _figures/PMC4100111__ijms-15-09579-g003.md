caption: 'Bioinformatics analysis by String. The list of the identified proteins was
  subjected to String (v. 9.05) analysis to reveal functional interactions between
  the deregulated proteins. Each node represents a protein, and each edge represents
  an interaction. The original graphic output was modified to fit the proteins, according
  to their classification under the gene ontology descriptor “Biological Process”:
  proteolysis (confined within the red circle), glucose catabolic process (confined
  within the black circle) and tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway (confined
  within the blue circle) as revealed by the DAVID (v. 6.7) annotation system.'
