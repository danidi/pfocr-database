caption: 'Hsp gene induction by ROS and denatured proteins. Reactive oxygen species
  (ROS, shown in red) and denatured proteins induce Hsp gene expression through at
  least two pathways, involving the transcription factors HSF (a) and Foxo (b). (a)
  Denatured proteins activate all Hsp genes through the transcription factor HSF.
  HSF is constitutively expressed, and under normal conditions HSF is present in the
  cytoplasm in a complex with several Hsps (including Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hsp40), that
  sequester the HSF protein in an inactive, monomeric form. The induction of Hsp genes
  by denatured proteins involves activation of HSF, and a negative feed-back loop
  that limits the response. Heat stress, ROS damage and other protein-denaturing stresses
  cause the unfolding of proteins and the exposure of hydrophobic residues in the
  denatured proteins. The exposed hydrophobic residues bind to Hsps, and these interactions
  inhibit aggregation, and facilitate re-folding or turnover, thereby reducing toxic
  effects on the cell. The binding of Hsps to denatured proteins titrates the Hsps
  away from HSF transcription factor, allowing HSF to assume an active trimeric form
  and translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, HSF binds to heat shock response
  elements (HSEs) in the promoters of the Hsp genes, and activates high-level Hsp
  gene expression. Once Hsp protein levels increase sufficiently they saturate the
  denatured proteins and titrate HSF back to the inactive Hsp-bound form, thereby
  limiting the response. The Hsps bind to a variety of clients, including inhibitory
  interactions with the tumor-suppressor (and senescence-regulatory protein) p53.
  In this way, stresses such as heat or oxidative stress that cause the denaturation
  of proteins can coordinately affect a variety of pathways by sequestering the Hsps
  away from their multiple regulatory-protein clients. (b) ROS also activates a subset
  of Hsp genes through the JNK signaling pathway and the transcription factor Foxo.
  JNK signaling activates Foxo in the cytoplasm, allowing Foxo to translocate to the
  nucleus where it binds to motifs in the promoters of a subset of Hsp genes and activates
  their expression, for example, the sHsp gene l(2)efl. The insulin/IGF1-like signaling
  (IIS) pathway negatively regulates Foxo activity by phosphorylating sites on Foxo
  that favor its retention in the cytoplasm. Therefore, decreased IIS can favor the
  expression of specific genes, such as l(2)efl, through increased activity of Foxo.Key:
  HSF, heat shock factor; IIS, insulin/IGF1-like signaling pathway; JNK, Jun N-terminal
  kinase. Solid arrowheads indicate activation or production. T-bar indicates inhibition.
  Single-side arrowheads indicate partitioning between two subcellular compartments
  or states.'
