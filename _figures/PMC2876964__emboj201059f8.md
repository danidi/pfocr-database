caption: A model of poly(A) tail dynamics after DNA damage. In the absence of DNA
  damage treatment, CBP80 binds to nuclear PARN, inhibiting its deadenylase activity.
  Under those conditions, CBC also enhances the polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs by increasing
  the stability of the RNA/CstF complex. As a result of these functional interactions,
  polyadenylation takes place and normal levels of total mRNA are observed. After
  exposure to UV treatment, the elongating RNAP II–CstF holoenzyme complex stalls
  at the sites of damage. A BRCA1/BARD1-containing complex is recruited to sites of
  repair, inhibiting RNAP II and the associated polyadenylation machinery by ubiquitination
  followed by degradation of the RNAP IIO. Under those conditions, the CBP80 protein
  dissociates from PARN, allowing binding of PARN to the CstF-50/BARD1 complex. As
  a result of these functional interactions, polyadenylation is inhibited and a 5′-cap-dependent
  deadenylation decay pathway is activated, generating the observed decrease in the
  levels of total mRNA. Given that CstF-50 can functionally interact with all the
  elements of this model, we propose an important role for this protein in the transcription-coupled
  DNA damage response.
