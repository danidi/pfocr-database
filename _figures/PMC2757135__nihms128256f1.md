caption: 'Pathway 1: Cholesterol synthesized in the ER is trafficked to the Golgi
  apparatus where it can be targeted to the mitochondria via the PAP7 protein for
  steroidogenesis. Passive diffusion from the ER to the mitochondria, shown here with
  the corresponding cholesterol molecules present on both organelles, is another possible
  pathway for steroidogenic cholesterol to be transferred to the mitochondria. Pathway
  2: Low density lipoprotein (LDL), containing cholesterol, binds to the LDL receptor
  and is trafficked through the endosomal pathway. MLN-64 assists with the transfer
  of cholesterol to the mitochondria from the late endosomes and lysosomes for use
  in steroidogenesis. NPC1 and NPC2 associate with MLN-64 for cholesterol transfer
  out of the lysosomes, although it is not known if this cholesterol is used for steroidogenesis.
  Pathway 3: Cholesterol is transferred from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to the
  plasma membrane by the SR-BI receptor. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) converts esterified
  cholesterol from the plasma membrane to free cholesterol, which can be used for
  steroidogenesis. Pathway 4: HSL also interacts with esterified cholesterol present
  in the lipid droplets (LD), which converts esterified cholesterol to free cholesterol
  for use in steroidogenesis as well. Free cholesterol from the LD can interact with
  lipid-binding proteins present in the cytosol for delivery to the mitochondria.'
