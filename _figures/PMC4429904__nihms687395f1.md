caption: A model for illustrating distinct anti-inflammatory mechanisms of PGRN and
  current anti-TNFα therapy. TNFα binds to TNFR1 and mediates inflammation. Currently-marked
  anti-TNFα therapies, exemplified by infliximab (Remicade), bind to TNFα ligand and
  in turn block TNFα-mediated inflammation; however, PGRN and its derived Atsttrin
  exert their anti-inflammatory action via direct binding to and by occupying TNFR1.
  Note that PGRN-mediated activation of the protective PGRN/TNFR2 pathway is not included
  in this model.
