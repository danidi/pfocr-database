caption: PHLPP suppresses the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Upon activation of growth
  factor receptors, PI3K is recruited by insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and
  other proteins to the receptors, where it is activated by phosphorylation, resulting
  in production of the second messenger PIP3 at the plasma membrane. Upon this stimulus,
  Akt translocates to the plasma membrane, where it is activated by phosphorylation
  at the activation loop (T308) and hydrophobic motif (S473). Fully phosphorylated,
  active Akt phosphorylates a range of downstream substrates, including TSC2, which
  indirectly regulates mTOR, and GSK3β. Several phosphatases (bright red) act to restrain
  PI3K/Akt pathway activation, including the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which dephosphorylates
  PIP3, removing the upstream signal for Akt activation, and the protein phosphatases
  PP2A and PHLPP, which dephosphorylate Akt at T308 (the activation loop) and S473
  (the hydrophobic motif), respectively. Note that PHLPP also dephosphorylates S6K1
  at its hydrophobic motif, repressing protein synthesis and activating the S6K/IRS-1
  feedback loop. PHLPP expression is tightly regulated downstream of Akt, resulting
  in negative feedback via two mechanisms. First, mTORC1 activation increases PHLPP1
  and PHLPP2 protein translation via activation of S6K and inhibition of 4EBP1; second,
  GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of PHLPP1 results in increased PHLPP degradation
  mediated by the E3 ligase β-TrCP. Thus, repression of GSK3β by Akt prevents PHLPP
  degradation and increases PHLPP protein levels.

  description: PHLPP suppresses the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Upon activation of

    this stimulus, Akt translocates to the plasma membrane, where it is activated

    Fully phosphorylated, active Akt phosphorylates a range of downstream substrates,

    (bright red) act to restrain PI3K/Akt pathway activation, including the lipid

    Thus, repression of GSK3β by Akt prevents PHLPP degradation and increases PHLPP
    protein levels.
