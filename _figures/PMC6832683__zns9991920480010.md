caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the distinct roles of Nrp2 in corticostriatal
  pathway development, maintenance, and function. Loss of Nrp2 in Nrp2−/− global KO
  mice increases spine number on apical dendrites of layer V cortical neurons as well
  as on striatal SPNs. CKO mice with adult loss of Nrp2 specifically from layer V
  cortical neurons (Nrp2f/f;Etv1-CreER) also show an increased number of cortical
  dendritic spines. Both Nrp2 KO and CKO mice show reduced paired-pulse facilitation
  relative to WT mice at corticostriatal synapses, indicating a modification in presynaptic
  neurotransmitter release. Nrp2 KO increased SPN intrinsic excitability relative
  to WT mice, consistent with the increased number of spines on SPN dendrites, whereas
  CKO mice showed no change in SPN excitability. Nrp2 KO animals were impaired in
  the rotarod and in an instrumental goal-directed task, whereas CKO mice showed only
  impaired rotarod performance.
