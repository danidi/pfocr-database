caption: In response to DR agonists such as TRAIL, tubular mitochondria in normal
  cells undergo Drp1-dependent fission and then fuse to restore the tubular network
  (upper panel). This may make normal cells resistant to the stress. On the other
  hand, in tumor cells, relatively higher levels of mitochondrial ROS (mROS) accumulation
  occur and then mROS evoke depolarization, which promotes mitochondrial fragmentation
  and clustering. Consequently, a smaller number of mitochondria can restore the tubular
  network through the fission-fusion homeostasis described above. Hence, this mitochondrial
  morphology homeostasis can be anti-apoptotic by counteracting pro-apoptotic (irreversible)
  mitochondrial network abnormalities, impairment of the Drp1-dependent fission by
  Drp1 knockdown or mdivi-1 accelerates mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering,
  and cell death. mROS accumulation also causes mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
  collapse, resulting in the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (mPTP), mitochondrial swelling and collapse of mitochondrial integrity, a central
  gatekeeper of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Mitochondrial swelling and depolarization
  may cooperatively facilitate the formation and clustering of damaged punctate mitochondria.
  Either or both of mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering may promote apoptotic
  cell death.
