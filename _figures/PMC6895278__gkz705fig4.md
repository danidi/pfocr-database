caption: Models for REV3-dependent synthesis at difficult-to-replicate regions in
  the genome. (A) Model, after Northam et al., for the role of pol ζ and Rev1p synthesizing
  non-B DNA (). Hairpin structures in DNA can stall replicative polymerases. Ubiquitinated
  PCNA then recruits Rev1p. Rev1p first acts enzymatically and inserts a dCTP near
  the base of the hairpin, after which it serves to recruit pol ζ. Pol ζ then initiates
  synthesis on the opposing strand followed by repriming near the original site of
  the hairpin, copying from this mismatched sequence. Alternatively, hairpin structures
  can be bypassed by template switching. (B) Model for pol ζ bypass of incorporated
  ribonucleotides proposed by Lazzaro et al. (). Incorporated ribonucleotides can
  be repaired by ribonucleotide excision repair or a Top1-dependent pathway. When
  incorporated ribonucleotides remain in the DNA during replication they have the
  potential to stall a replication fork. In yeast, pol ζ may bypass incorporated ribonucleotides.
  (C) Model for pol ζ replicating interstitial telomeric sequences (ITS), after Moore
  et al. (). Telomeric proteins, at (ITS), may result in stalling of the replication
  fork. REV3 is proposed to fill a gap caused by cleavage of the fork by the MRX endonuclease
  complex (Mre11p/Rad50p/Xrs2p) followed by end resection. Alternatively, cells can
  deal with ITS through homology dependent repair mechanisms (dependent on RAD51 or
  RAD52).
