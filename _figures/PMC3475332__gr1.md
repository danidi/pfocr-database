caption: 'Tertiary and quaternary structure of β-catenin in the adherens junction
  and the experimental setup for its nanomechanical analysis. (A) Schematic representation
  of the cadherin adhesion system and possible force applied through the cell-cell
  adhesion contact. β-catenin is an adaptor protein involved in cell-cell adhesion
  that can also translocate to the nucleus and act as a transcriptional cofactor when
  the Wnt signaling pathway is active (). (B) Crystal structure of the ARM region
  from β-catenin (lighter structure) complexed with E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail (darker
  structure). The ARM region is in the middle of the protein and consists of 12 ARM
  repeats stacked onto one another in a superhelical tertiary structure. β-catenin
  binds both α-catenin (close to its N-terminal region) and the cadherin cytoplasmic
  domain (through the ARM region). Circle and pentagon mark the N-termini of β-catenin
  and cadherin respectively, which are oriented in opposite directions. Ellipse and
  triangle mark the C-termini of β-catenin and cadherin respectively. (C) We analyzed
  several fusion proteins comprising four repeats of the titin I27 marker, used for
  single-molecule identification, flanking either the region of 12 ARM repeats from
  β-catenin (ARMI27) or the full-length β-catenin (βI27). We also analyzed the full-length
  β-catenin without the markers. (D) Cartoon representation of the experimental setup:
  proteins were immobilized on top of a substrate and after their attachment to the
  cantilever tip of an AFM, these molecules were axially stretched (in the N-C direction).'
