caption: 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. A. ROS generation: Cellular ROS
  is generated by 5 pathways. 1) Superoxide generation: O2•- is derived from oxygen
  (O2) after receiving an electron from various oxidases or from mitochondrial electron
  transport chain (ETC). 2) Reactive nitrogen species generation: O2•- reacts with
  nitric oxide (NO•) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). At physiological pH (pKa = 6.8),
  ONOO− is in equilibrium with peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH). In the aqueous phase, ONOO−
  rapidly reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate carbonate radical anion (CO3•-)
  and nitrogen dioxide (NO2•). In the hydrophobic phase, ONOOH can undergo homolytic
  fission to generate hydroxyl radical (OH•-) and NO2•. 3) Hydrogen peroxide generation:
  O2•- is dismutated spontaneously or by superoxide dismutase (SOD) into H2O2. NOX4
  and DOX1/2 can also dismutate O2 directly to H2O2. 4) Hydroxyl radical generation:
  OH•- can be derived from ONOOH as described in pathway 2. It can also be generated
  from H2O2 through Haber–Weiss reaction in the presence of transition metals, such
  as Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+. H2O2 can be converted to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by myeloperoxidase
  (MPO), and then react with O2•- to form OH•. 5) Lipid radical generation: Lipid
  peroxidation is usually initiated by OH•- abstracting an allylic hydrogen (H) from
  unsaturated lipid and forming the carbon-centered lipid radical (L•). Generated
  L• then rapidly reacts with O [] to form a lipid peroxyl radical (LOO•), which abstracts
  a H from another unsaturated lipid (LH) molecule to form lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH).
  B. ROS clearance: There are five major ROS clearance pathways, including I) Superoxide
  dismutation: Two O2•- can be converted to one H2O2 and O2 by SOD1-3. Ⅱ) Hydrogen
  peroxide decomposition: Two H2O2 molecules can be decomposed by catalase (CAT) into
  H2O and O2. Ⅲ) Glutathione redox cycle: H2O2 can be reduced by glutathione peroxidase
  (GPX) or Peroxiredoxin (PRDX)1/4/6 isoforms into H2O using GSH as the electron donor.
  Oxidized GSSG will be reduced back to GSH by glutathione reductase (GSR) after receiving
  a H from NADPH. GPX can also reduce LOOH to become LOH. Ⅳ) Thioredoxin redox cycle:
  H2O2 can also be reduced by PRDX1-5 into H2O using reduced Thioredoxin (TrxR) as
  an electron donor. Oxidized Thioredoxin (TrxO) will be reduced back to TrxR by Thioredoxin
  reductase (TR). Ⅴ) glutathione-S-transferase detoxification: Some electrophilic
  compounds, such as xenobiotics, can be conjugated with GSH by glutathione-S-transferase
  (GST) forming Glutathione conjugates (GSX). Abbreviation: Arg, l-arginine; CAT,
