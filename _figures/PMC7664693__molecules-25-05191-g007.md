caption: The proposed mechanism by which carvone decreases melanin content by inhibiting
  melanoma cell proliferation. As shown in a schematic illustration, the stimulation
  of the cAMP signaling pathway by carvone is responsible for the inhibition of cell
  proliferation. The downstream molecular mechanism by which cAMP-mediated inhibition
  of cell growth seems to be associated with the phosphorylation of Cdc25 and CDK1
  proteins.
