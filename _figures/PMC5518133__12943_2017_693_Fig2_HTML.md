caption: Regulatory mechanisms of WBP2 in breast cancer. a Once nER activated by estradiol,
  WBP2 then binds to YAP for stimulating the transcriptional activation of ERα. b
  WBP2 participates in the EGF signaling pathway thru binding to the complex of c-Yes
  and YAP in breast cancer. c ERα-medicated Wnt expression can activate GSKβ/β-catenin
  to promote the ERα-launched transcriptional programming. d WWOX binds PPxY domain
  of WBP2 and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, suppressing WBP2-mediated transcriptional
  functions. e TAZ interacts with WBP2 to improve the cell proliferation, migration,
  and survival through Hippo pathway in breast cancer, and the binding of them may
  also trigger the transcription activation of ERα. f Tyrosine phosphorylation of
  WBP2 possibly can be activated by several tyrosine kinases via the binding of E2
  to mER and be drived into nuclei to function as a coactivator of ER
