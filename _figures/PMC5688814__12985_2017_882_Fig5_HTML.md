caption: ZIKV induced host responses and alterations of host transcriptome. Several
  DE lncRNAs, ISOs and PCGs were enriched in cell cycle, apoptosis, immune response,
  transcription regulation, amino acid biosynthesis, mTOR signaling pathway and p53
  signaling pathway. Meanwhile, many of genes undergone AS involved in neuron development,
  RNA processing and transport. Red and green arrows denote downregulation and upregulation,
  respectively. The rectangle and oval stand for GO terms and pathways, respectively
