caption: Proposed model of norepinephrine’s antioxidant effect in ovarian surface
  epithelial cells. Outlined above is the proposed pathway by which norepinephrine
  decreases ROS generation and subsequent DNA damage in ovarian surface epithelial
  cells. In this model, norepinephrine acts as a rapid ROS scavenger leading to a
  decrease in downstream DNA damage and reactive transcription of genes involved in
  the cellular response to oxidative stress.
