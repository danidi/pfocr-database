caption: A summary of purinergic pathways involved in microglial response. Since ATP
  is ubiquitous, it is present in the cytoplasm of nerve terminals, astrocytes, and
  the microglia itself. It is released to the extracellular space in response to a
  wide variety of signals, including neuronal firing, mechanical stimuli, ischemia/energy
  deprivation, bacterial endotoxin and cellular damage. Adenosine could be either
  released from cells, or generated from extracellular ATP via breakdown by NTPDase
  (NTPD) and CD73/5–nucleotidase (CD73) enzymes. The action of adenosine is terminated
  by its uptake into nerve terminals by the equilibrative nucleoside transporter system
  (ENT), and the same transporters could mediate the release of adenosine under energy
  deprivation. ATP acts on ionotropic P2X7 and P2X4 receptors, and also on metabotopic
  P2Y receptors, whereas adenosine activates metabotropic A1, A2A and A3 receptors,
  all present on the surface of activated microglia. Whilst the activation of P2X
  receptors triggers an inward cationic current and depolarizes the microglial membrane,
  the activation of P2Y receptors is coupled to the G protein-phospholipase C (PLC)
  signal transduction pathway, both resulting in the elevation of intracellular Ca2+.
  P2X receptors are involved in the expression, posttranslational processing and secretion
  of various factors shaping the microglial response i.e., IL–β, IL–, IL–8, TNF-α,
  reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), plasminogen, 2-arachydonoyl glycerate (2-AG),
  and microglial response factor−? (MRF-1) and thereby contribute to both the proinflammatory
  and antiinflammatory aspects of microglial activation. In addition, P2X7 receptors
  eventually also mediate apoptosis by caspase 1 activation. The stimulation of P2Y
  receptors hyperpolarizes the microglia, via an outward K+ conductance and inhibits
  the production of proinflammatory mediators. Adenosine receptors regulate the proliferation/survival
  of microglia, COX-2 expression and subsequent secretion of PGF2, and the production
  of nerve growth factor (NGF). For more details and references, see text. For the
  sake of clarity, details of intracellular signal transduction and transcriptional
  changes are not illustrated
