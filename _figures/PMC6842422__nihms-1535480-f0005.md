caption: (A) In wild type Fog-Mist signaling, the G protein Cta transmits the signal
  from the Mist receptor activated by its ligand Fog. Mist is then phosphorylated
  by Gprk2, followed by an interaction with Krz that properly terminates signaling.
  (B) The finger loop mutation (VL/A) interferes with the ability of Krz to uncouple
  Mist from Cta, while still allowing partial association with the Gprk2-phosphorylated
  residues in the receptor tail. Combination of the finger loop and phosphate sensor
  mutations (KKVL/A) leads to inability of Krz to associate with the receptor. Both
  the VL/A and KKVL/A mutations result in hyperactivity of the Fog-Mist signaling
  pathway, leading to excessive cellular contractility.
