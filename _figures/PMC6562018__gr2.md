caption: (a) Reduction in AAs (EAAs, BCAAs, and Met) induces uncharged tRNA and activates
  GCN2, eIF2α and ATF4/5, resulting in increased FGF21 production. FGF21 production
  is also increased due to the reduced levels of NEAAs via NUPR1. FGF21 improves glucose
  metabolism through UCP-1-dependent increases in energy expenditure or the UCP-1-independent
  pathway. GCN2 also suppresses mTORC1 activation. (b) LPD, LPHC or MetR-induced reduction
  in GH/IGF-1 signalling suppresses mTORC1 activation and FOXO activation via the
  suppression of Akt. FOXO activation leads to anti-ageing effects, such as anti-oxidation.
  FGF21 inhibits GH/IGF-1 signalling, and the reduction in GH/IGF-1 is related to
  the restoration of Gnmt activation.
