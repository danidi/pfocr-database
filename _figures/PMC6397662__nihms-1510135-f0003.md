caption: A) Excess consumption of energy demands an increased nutrient storage capacity
  of adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT). As a result, adipocytes become hypertrophic
  and stressed, leading to dysfunction marked by ensuing inflammation. Expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, lipocalin-2 (LCN2), renin angiotensin system (RAS)
  markers, and ER stress markers by these stressed adipocytes and stromal vascular
  fraction (SVF) of the WAT leads to chronic leukocyte-type 12-LOX (12/15-LOX) activation
  in the adipocyte and SVF and subsequent generation of pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites,
  such as 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE. 12/15-LOX activity promotes further amplification
  of these pathways, in particular the interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway. This inflamed
  fat promotes the recruitment of macrophages and other inflammatory cells into the
  fat bed, further propagating the inflammatory autocrine cascade. In addition, WAT
  exerts paracrine and endocrine pro-inflammatory effects through secreted cytokines
  on various organ systems, including the pancreas, liver, and vasculature, leading
  to metabolic decline. B) Diets enriched in ω−3 fatty acids or acute inflammatory
  responses acutely activate the 12- and 15-LOX enzymes in normal or inflamed hypertrophic
  WAT to generate anti-inflammatory or pro-resolving lipid metabolites, such as the
  maresins, resolvins, protectins, and lipoxins. Thereby targeting 12/15-LOX activity
  may be a novel therapeutic target in treating Local WAT and systemic metabolic dysfunction.
