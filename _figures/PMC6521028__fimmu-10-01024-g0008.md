caption: The mechanism of PDCoV N protein interfered with the type I IFN response.
  PDCoV infect the host cells by attaching to the celluar receptor porcine APN. In
  the cytoplasm, PDCoV release the viral genomic RNA and then complete the transcription
  and replication process. The ssRNA as well as dsRNA as replicative intermediate
  are sensed by porcine innate nucleic acids sensors in the cytoplasm to induce the
  IFNs production, such as porcine RIG-I. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Riplet is shown
  to active RIG-I by K63-linked polyubiqutination. Activation of JAK-STAT pathway
  by IFNs binding its receptor induces the production of ISGs, such as OAS1, ISG15.
  In the present, PDCoV N protein can block the porcine RIG-I dsRNA-binding and interferes
  with porcine Riplet-mediated porcine RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination to restrain
  the type I IFN response. PDCoV N protein also interacts with porcine TRAF3. However,
  the mechanism of the association is unclear. The other viral structure proteins
  are unclear in regulating type I IFN response.
