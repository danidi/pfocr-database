caption: Hypothetical host-cell signaling pathways linking Cryptosporidium parvum
  infection and tumorigenesis. Different studies have shown that C. parvum induces
  cytoskeleton remodeling and actin reorganization through the implication of several
  intracellular signals, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Cdc42.
  In addition, in an experimental model, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) and E-cadherin
  labelings were decreased while β-catenin and the P53 tumor suppressor labelings
  were increased in the cytoplasm of C. parvum-infected epithelial cells. β-catenin
  was found localized in a juxtamembraneous position, suggesting a role of the non-canonical
  Wnt pathway in this transformation process. P53 was not translocated into the nucleus,
  and its labeling increased in the cytoplasm where P53 could regulate key metabolic
  pathways associated to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
