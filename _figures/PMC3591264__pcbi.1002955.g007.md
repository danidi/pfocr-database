caption: '(A) A DC map of modules enriched with protein complexes. Node size is proportional
  to the size of the module. The enriched pathway names are noted on the module. 40S:
  40S cytoplasmatic Ribosome complex, 60S: 60S cytoplasmatic Ribosome complex, Nop56:
  Nop56p-associated pre-rRNA complex. Blue and red edges mark increased and decreased
  correlation in AD, respectively. (B) Analysis of DC in the Ribosome and 60S-Nop56
  meta-module circled in A. Left: the known interactions involving the genes of the
  two modules according to GENEMANIA. Right: co-expression networks of the same genes
  for AD patients and controls. An edge between two genes indicates correlation >0.5
  in the tested class. The average correlation between modules was 0.4 and 0.75 in
  the controls and AD class, respectively. Node colors show DE between AD and control,
  measured as the base-10 logarithm of the p-value (t-test) of the tested gene. Circled
  subgroups: proteins belonging to 40S cytoplasmatic Ribosome and Nop56 complex. 40S
  complex genes are up-regulated in AD, whereas 60S genes show only mild DE.'
