caption: A potential BAG6/SGTA cycle for cytosolic quality control. Hydrophobic polypeptides
  that fail to engage SRP, including tail-anchored (TA) proteins and short fragments
  of integral membrane proteins, become substrates for both SGTA and the BAG6 complex
  (step 1). Tail-anchored proteins are most likely passed from SGTA to the BAG6 complex
  before specific transfer to the ER delivery factor TRC40 (step 2; see ; ; ). By
  contrast, the binding of MLPs to the BAG6 complex promotes their ubiquitylation
  () and proteasomal degradation (step 3), a process that is antagonised by SGTA ().
  We postulate that SGTA normally acts to provide a rescue pathway for prematurely
  ubiquitylated substrates (step 4), thereby prolonging their opportunity for successful
  ER delivery and/or native folding. SGTA overexpression causes the inhibition and/or
  reversal of BAG6-mediated MLP ubiquitylation (step 5), resulting in their accumulation
  and aggregation.
