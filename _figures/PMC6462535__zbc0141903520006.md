caption: Model for ethanol regulation of stem cell differentiation via activation
  of RA signaling. ROL, in complex with Rbp4, is a substrate for Stra6, which imports
  ROL into the cell. EtOH increases the mRNAs of Stra6 and several genes in the RA
  synthesis pathway, including Rdh10, Dhrs3, Rbp1, and Crabp2. Intracellular ROL is
  either converted to 4-oxoretinol via Cyp26a1 or presented to the RA synthesis machinery
  upon binding to Rbp1. ROL is not stored as retinyl esters in ESCs, as Lrat is not
  expressed in these cells. The Rdh10/Dhrs3 complex oxidizes ROL to retinaldehyde,
  which serves as a substrate for Aldh1a2-catalyzed oxidation to all-trans-RA. Newly
  formed RA is then transported to the nucleus by Crabp2, where it activates the RARγ/RXR
  transcriptional complex to stimulate expression of RA-responsive genes necessary
  for ESC differentiation.
