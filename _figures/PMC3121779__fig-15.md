caption: Protective effects of OxPLs against acute lung injury and endothelial barrier
  dysfunction. PL oxidation products such as OxPAPC can inhibit lung damage in acute
  bacterial inflammation due to their ability to inhibit activation of TLRs 2 and
  4. Furthermore, PL-esterified isoprostanes activate tyrosine kinase SRC and PI3K-AKT
  signaling, leading to recruitment of RAC/CDC42 specific nucleotide exchange factors
  TIAM1 and βPIX, stimulation of RAC and CDC42 GTPases and their effectors involved
  in activation of peripheral actin polymerization (cortactin, p21ARC, ARP2/3, N-WASP,
  cofilin), focal adhesion remodeling (FAK, paxillin) and enhancement of adherens
  junctions (β-catenin). These cytoskeletal changes are critical for enhancement of
  vascular endothelial barrier properties. Finally, OxPAPC and other classes of OxPLs
  protect against vascular hyperpermeability caused by edemagenic, inflammatory factors,
  and pathologic lung overdistension. This protection involves inhibition of RHO GTPase-dependent
  pathway of endothelial contraction and monolayer barrier disruption via activation
  of RAC-dependent mechanisms triggered by OxPLs.
