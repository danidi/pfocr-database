  cells respond to a variety of hormonal and non-hormonal stimuli to control Na+ and

  expression of various targets that modulate ion transport, notably the serum and
  glucocorticoid inducible kinase SGK1 and the small chaperone GILZ1 (Glucocorticoid-inducible
  leucine zipper protein 1). Other factors, such as insulin and angiotensin II act
  through the master kinases phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex
  2 (mTORC2) to stimulate SGK1 activity. mTORC2 directly phosphorylates SGK1 in its
  hydrophobic motif, while PI3K acts through PI3K-dependent kinase to phosphorylate
  SGK1 in its activation loop. Only when phosphorylated at both these sites is SGK1
  fully active. SGK1 phosphorylates a variety of proteins, notably the ubiquitin ligase,
