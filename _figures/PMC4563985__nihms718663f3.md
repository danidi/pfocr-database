caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways
  in IFN-mediated autoinflammatory diseases. Pathways of innate immune sensing of
  cytosolic nucleotide and stress lead to type I IFN production and a feed-forward
  loop of IFN signaling. The enzyme cGAS is a cytosolic sensor of dsDNA that, upon
  activation, generates a small-molecule second messenger, cGAMP, which binds and
  signals through the adaptor protein STING. Similarly, the RIG-I-like receptor sensors
  RIG-I and MDA5 are triggered by binding to dsRNA and signal through the adaptor
  protein MAVS. The common pathway downstream of STING and MAVS includes TBK1 and
  IRF3 phosphorylation/activation and IFN-β transcription. The disease-causing mutations
  cause a gain of function of an intracellular sensor (red ) or a loss of function
  of a protein (blue), leading to generation of intracellular stress. (a) Aicardi-Goutières
  syndrome 7 (AGS7). MDA5, encoded by IFIH1, is one of the dsRNA sensors. Gain-of-function
  mutation in MDA5 causes constitutive or enhanced IFN-β transcription, resulting
  in a clinical syndrome similar to that caused by TREX1 mutation. (b) STING-associated
  vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). Gain-of-function mutations in STING cause
  spontaneous or enhanced transcription of IFN-β, leading to the clinical syndrome
  SAVI. (c) PRAAS/CANDLE. Genetic mutations in proteasome subunits cause loss of function
  and cellular stress. Through a still unclear process, reduced proteasome function
  leads to type I IFN production and the inflammatory disease phenotype of CANDLE.
  Whether the stress response due to defective proteasome function that is triggered
  through the cytosolic nucleotide–sensing pathway or other sensors that are coupled
  to type I IFN production remains unknown. The transcription and secretion of type
  I IFN results in a cytokine amplification loop in the same cells or other bystander
  cells. IRF7 is one of the IFN response genes, which further promote type I IFN transcription
  and amplification of the process. (d ) Aicardi-Goutières syndrome 1–6 (AGS1–6).
  TREX1 loss-of-function mutations cause accumulation of ssDNA derived from an endogenous
  retroelement, resulting in STING-dependent type I IFN transcription (AGS1). Similarly,
  loss-of-function mutations in RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, RNASEH2A, SAMHD1, and ADAR1 result
  in type I IFN transcription through still unknown signaling processes (AGS2–6).

  or ❷ generation of cell stress. (Other abbreviations: AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
