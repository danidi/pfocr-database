caption: Tyrosine kinases in the development of atopic dermatitis. Barrier impairment
  is one of the initial steps in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis which leads
  to the production of TSLP by keratinocytes that activates dendritic cells in a Jak1/Jak2
  dependent manner in the skin. Proinflammatory mediators produced by dendritic cells
  and keratinocytes drive the activation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells toward
  the TH2 phenotype. Activated TH2 cells produce several cytokines including IL-4
  and IL-13 which promote isotype switch and IgE production in B cells acting through
  receptors with the common γ chain (γc) utilizing the Jak1/Jak3 heterodimer. Additionally,
  intact B cell receptor (BCR) signaling involving Src-family kinases (SFK) and Syk
  is essential for normal B cell development. Downstream effector cells like mast
  cells recognize IgE through FcεRI in a Src-family and Syk dependent manner leading
  to degranulation and the production of proinflammatory mediators contributing to
  the development of atopic dermatitis. There are several feedback loops and shortcuts
  in this pathway facilitating inflammation utilizing tyrosine kinases. TH2 cytokines
  also promote the activation of keratinocytes and effector immune cells like mast
  cells requiring intact Jak signaling. Activation of mast cells through IL-3R/Jak2/Stat5
  pathway was also found to be important in allergen-induced dermatitis in mice. Furthermore,
  TSLP and TH2 cytokines acting through a Jak dependent manner in sensory neurons
  were found to mediate pruritus in atopic dermatitis in addition to mast cell-derived
  compounds such as histamine.
