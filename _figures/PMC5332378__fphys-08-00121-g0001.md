caption: Apelinergic signaling pathway. G protein-dependent, including PTX-sensitive
  and -insensitive pathways; and G protein-independent pathway, mediating the effects
  of apelin receptor (Kalea and Batlle, ; Chen et al., ). In contrary to dominant
  stretch that causes β-arrestin-mediated pathologic hypertrophy, apelin through APJ
  and G proteins can induce inotropic effects and plays a protective role. There is
  a functional interplay between apelin and stretch, such that apelin blunts pathological
  signaling from the stretch and stretch in turn profoundly interferes (via β-arrestins)
  with G-protein activation relevant to apelin signaling. Progressive increase in
  Ca2+ transient is the central player in the positive inotropic effect of apelin
  (Wang et al., ; Neves et al., ). As it shown, apelin through increasing of RyR2
  channel (Wang et al., ), NCX (Szokodi et al., ; Japp and Newby, ), PLB and SERCA
  activity (Wang et al., ), provide the Ca2+ required for contraction. The Ca2+ molecules
  subsequently bind to the contractile proteins such as TnC, which causes interaction
  of thick and thin filaments (Sussman et al., ; Gerilechaogetu et al., ). Besides
  RLC activation by PKC (sustained, fine-tuning regulation of contraction), PKC-mediated
  phosphorylation of NHE and NCX is essential for the maintenance of the increased
  contractility and for the prevention of the slow force decline (Perjés et al., ;
  Neves et al., ). It is noteworthy that the intracellular signals via PKC-ERK axis
  and Akt phosphorylation can be downstream elements of PTX-sensitive fashion of apelinergic
  system. Improving of calcium handling (direct or indirect modification of calcium
  cycling proteins), increasing of Ca2+ loading of SR along with translocation of
  AKT to the SR (due to increased of PLB phosphorylation), and increasing of the SERCA-PLB
  activity (via downregulation of phosphatase PP1) are proposed mechanisms for the
  increased contractility by cardiac specific AKT (Sussman et al., ; Gerilechaogetu
  et al., ). Interestingly, Wang et al. demonstrated that SR Ca2+ content is decreased
  by apelin and greater increase of NCX activity than that of SERCA activity, is proposed
  as an explanation (Wang et al., ). APJ, Angiotensin receptor like-1; PLC, phospholipase
