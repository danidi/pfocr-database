caption: A proposed model for the signaling pathway of Cao-induced keratinocyte differentiation.
  In high Cao conditions, PIP5K1α and PI3K are recruited to a p120-catenin dependent
  E-cadherin complex by β-catenin in the plasma membrane in which they increase the
  synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 and PIP(3,4,5)P3, respectively. PLC-γ1 then is recruited
  to the plasma membrane and activated by PI(3,4,5)P3, producing more IP3 that in
  turn increases Cai concentration to stimulate keratinocyte differentiation.
