caption: Simplified schematic representation of the alterations within glucose metabolism
  pathways in the brain after feeding of medium-chain triglycerides. The metabolism
  of glucose by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway is shown, along with
  the TCA cycle. Dark arrows represent regulatory steps in the pathway. Only the enzymes
  involved in reactions where changes in metabolite levels were observed are labeled.
  Thick arrows next to metabolites indicate significant differences between trioctanoin-
  and control diet-fed mice in the direction of arrow.
