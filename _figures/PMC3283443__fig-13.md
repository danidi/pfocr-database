caption: Denitrification pathway (a) and regulation (b) in bacteria. In (a), the topological
  organization of denitrification enzymes is shown. The membrane-bound (NarGHI), and
  periplasmic, (NapABC) nitrate reductases as well as the nitrite reductases (Cu-type
  or cd1-type), nitric oxide reductases (cNor, qNor, and qCuANor), and nitrous oxide
  reductase (NosZ) are shown. (b) Regulatory network of denitrification genes in response
  to O2 concentration, nitrate/nitrite, and nitric oxide (NO). Positive regulation
  is denoted by arrows, and negative regulation is indicated by perpendicular lines.
  Further details are given in the text.
