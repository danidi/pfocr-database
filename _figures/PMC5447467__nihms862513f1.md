caption: 'Panel A: Through its dense network of capillaries, the glomerulus serves
  as the basic blood filtration unit of the kidney. Therefore proper renal function
  relies largely on the structural and functional integrity of this specialized ‘unit’.
  Mesangial cells form the so-called mesangium, a stalk-like structure of mesenchymal
  origin that serves as a support for the glomerular vasculature and also contributes
  to the blood filtration process, thereby aiding urine formation (panel A). Podocytes
  are specialized perivascular epithelial cells extending long processes (foot processes,
  or pedicels) that wrap around glomerular capillaries and contribute to blood ultrafiltration
  by creating appropriate filtration slits (panel A). Capillary endothelial cells,
  podocytes and the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) altogether form the glomerular
  filtration barrier. (Panel B): A derailed complement response can target multiple
  anatomical sites and structures within the kidney glomerulus, such as the glomerular
  basement membrane (GBM), the mesangium, and the capillary endothelial cell wall.
  Excessive complement activation contributes to renal pathology in several clinical
  indications, including microangiopathies (atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [aHUS])
  and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). These clinical disorders, although manifested in distinct
  anatomical compartments of the kidney, share a common profile of complement-specific
  genetic perturbations and serum biomarkers. Most of these genetic or acquired alterations
  affect the functionality of complement regulators that normally control autologous
  complement responses, protecting host surfaces such as the GBM from inflammatory
  damage (right panel, top schematic). In C3G, complement dysregulation results in
  autologous complement attack on the GBM and is tightly linked to the formation of
  electron dense deposits and impaired renal function (left panel). This deregulated
  response can be driven by genetic factors or autoantibodies (i.e., C3 nephritic
  factors, C3Nefs) that stabilize the enzymatic complex that cleaves C3 into its bioactive
  fragments C3a and C3b (panel B). Factor H is a fluid-phase regulator of the alternative
  pathway (AP) that circulates in the plasma and can attach to host surfaces through
  high-affinity binding to carbohydrate moieties (e.g., GAGs) (right panel, top schematic).
  Genetic variations in FH leading to partial or complete loss of its ability to regulate
  C3 convertase in the fluid phase and on host surfaces have been linked to C3G. Impaired
  FH function can lead to uncontrolled C3 activation and persistent C3b deposition
  in the GBM via AP amplification (right panel, middle). Recent studies have shown
  that targeted C3 inhibition can restore complement regulation in C3G, attenuating
  multiple drivers of inflammatory damage (right panel, bottom schematic). C3-based
  inhibitors offer broad control over the detrimental consequences of complement activation
  in the kidney by simultaneously blocking the generation of multiple effectors (e.g.,
  C3a, C5a, MAC). Abbreviations: iC3b, inactive C3; FH, factor H; CFHRs, complement
  FH-related proteins; EC, glomerular endothelial cell; GBM, glomerular basement membrane;
  C3Nef, C3 nephritic factor.'
