caption: Exposure to LPS activates the NF-κB pathway in isolated islets and inhibits
  the expression of insulin, PDX-1 and MafA. The decrease in insulin expression might
  indirectly results from LPS inhibition of PDX-1 and MafA. NF-κB could also inhibit
  insulin gene expression by interacting with other proteins such as C/EBPβ and/or
  CREB, as observed in other cell types.
