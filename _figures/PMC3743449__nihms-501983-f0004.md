caption: The classical example of NFκB is the heterodimer of p50 and p65 and the classical
  activation pathway entails the release from its association with an inhibitory molecule
  of the IκB family. Upon exposure of the cell to various stimuli such as increase
  in oxidative stress, two specific serine residues are rapidly phosphorylated by
  the IKK1/2 kinases, whose activity is coupled to upstream signaling cascades by
  their association with a third protein called NFκB essential modulator (NEMO). Once
  phosphorylated, IκBs undergo degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway in
  the main route of NFκB activation. This is mediated by initial recognition of phosphorylated
  IκBs by the β-TrCP component of the ubiquitin ligase complex Skp1/Cul1/ROC1/F-box
  protein FWD 1 and subsequent covalent attachment of multiple moities of ubiquitin
  to the IκBs. The multi-ubiquitin chain allows subsequent association with the amino-terminal
  domain of valosin-containing protein (VCP), and thereby the targeting of IκBs to
  the 26S proteasome and the translocation of the transcriptionally active dimers
  to the nucleus. Worth noticing is the fact that the very same IKK/E3 combination
  is also involved in the generation of p50 (NFκB1) from its precursor molecule p105
  by limited proteolysis, adding to its NFκB activating function. Modified and reproduced
