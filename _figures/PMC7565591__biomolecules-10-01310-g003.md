caption: Coupling of signal transduction and (default) pathways affecting mRNP formation
  and mRNA fate. Stressful conditions and cytokines activate three canonical signaling
  pathways that primarily initiate mRNA transcription (through the IKK-NF-κB pathway)
  but simultaneously also promote mRNA decay and fast mRNA turnover (through the JNK
  and p38 MAPK pathways). The newly synthesized mRNAs are rapidly and efficiently
  unfolded and translated (right part) but can also be targeted for immediate decay
  by phosphorylation of prototypical RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as TTP, AUF1
  and HUR1 (center). Decay proceeds stepwise through deadenylation, decapping and
  5′ exonucleolysis (left part). The balance between mRNA translation and decay ensures
  fast and transient protein turnover in response to the above-mentioned triggers.
  Alternatively, mRNAs can transform into closed loop (circular) mRNPs or progressively
  fold into structures of higher complexity through liquid-liquid phase separation
  (LLPS) and formation of P-bodies or stress granules. These pathways allow mRNA storage
  and translational shut-off under unfavorable conditions. New studies now suggest
  that in addition to the (reversible) modifications of multiple RBPs, also the factors
  mediating decay, storage and higher-order assemblies of mRNPs are directly controlled
  by post-translational modifications, in particular phosphorylation by various protein
  kinases and non-degradative, K63-linked ubiquitin polymers by multifunctional E3
  ligases such as TRAF6. For details and specific examples see text.
