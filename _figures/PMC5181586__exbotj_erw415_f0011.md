caption: Model summarizing the main results regarding ethylene action on AR formation
  in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. ACC degradation by ACO gives rise to ethylene.
  In the presence of ethylene, EIN2 activates a TF cascade, including EIN3 and its
  most closely related homolog EIL1. The EIN3–EIL1 network activates a transcriptional
  cascade leading to the ethylene response. In the hypocotyl, the ethylene response
  involves the inhibition of the expression and activity of the WEI2 (ASA1) and WEI7
  (ASB) isoforms of the anthranilate synthase that converts chorismate into anthranilate,
  an early step in the tryptophan-dependent indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway of
  IAA biosynthesis. Following this biosynthethic route, tryptofan is formed, and IPyA
  is in turn formed from tryptophan. IPyA is converted to IAA by YUC6 flavin monooxigenase.
  In addition, YUC6 transcription is inhibited in response to ethylene, whereas the
  activities of the ENOYL-COA HYDRATASE IBR10 and the ENOYL-COA HYDRATASE2 (ECH2)
  of the β-oxidation of IBA, leading to its conversion into IAA, are stimulated. The
  IBA-derived IAA is the main source of auxin that leads to adventitious rooting through
  numerous successive steps (dotted arrows). Further details and references are in
  the text.
