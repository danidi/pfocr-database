caption: Mechanism of reversine and XSLJZD amelioration of TAA-induced hepatic injury.
  TAA-induced liver damage and fibrosis by activation of NF-κB/caspase-1. Reversine
  inhibited the TAA-induced damage by regulating the RelA/NF-κB/caspase signaling
  pathway. XSLJZD enhanced the suppressing effect of reversine on the inflammatory
  pathway.
