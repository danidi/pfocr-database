caption: 'Simplified overview of the RA-associated inflammation-promoting factors.
  Although the cause of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is currently unknown, three factors,
  genetics, environment, and autoimmunity, play predominant role. It is currently
  accepted that autoimmune reaction is probably initiated at mucosal surfaces mostly
  of oral cavity, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract by not-well-described triggers
  involving environmental factors such as smoking and mucosal microbiota leading in
  predisposed individuals to development of B- and T-cell clones involved in the producing
  of autoantibodies. They recognize either Fc portion of normal immunoglobuline molecules
  and rheumatoid factor (RF) or they recognize citrullinated proteins (anti-citrullinated
  protein antibodies, ACPAs, or cyclic citrullinated peptides or CCP antibodies) formed
  by post-translational modification of amino acid arginine to citrulline. Produced
  autoantibodies could also recognize mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV), and carbamylated
  proteins (CarP) formed by post-translational modification of the amino acid lysine
  to homocitrulline. In this scenario, after long period of preclinical RA, inflammation
  is relocated from mucosal tissues to joints. This process probably involves immune
  complexes formation and their joint deposition, sharing antigenic determinants between
  sites of autoimmunity initiation and the joints, epitope spreading leading to the
  generation of autoimmunity directed to joint, and memory T and B cells. During relocation
  from mucosal tissues to joints, changes in autoantibodies isotype, avidity, and
  glycosylation, and epitope spreading should take place in response to as yet unknown
  stimuli. Joint synovial membrane-deposition of auto-antibodies and immune complexes
  trigger local inflammation by several mechanisms including (a) complement activation,
  (b) probably also direct interaction of autoantibodies with Fc receptors on innate
  immunity cells (MΦ, DC), (c) stress/inflammation-induced release of endogenous DAMP,
  (d) successive activation of innate immunity cells (similarly to those described
  in TJA loosening above), and (e) immigration and activation of T cells (Th1). All
  those stimuli lead to predominance of osteoclastogenic cytokines involved in the
  differentiation of bone marrow GM-CFU precursors to fully mature osteoclasts (M-CSF,
  RANKL, IL-1β, TNF-α) or M1 macrophages (IFN-γ, type 1 IFNs, TNF-α). In RA, activated
  synovial fibroblasts (AFs) and T cells are the major source of RANKL contributing
  thus to bone resorption. Th1 cells further support this by inflammatory activation
  of fibroblasts through TNF-α. On the other hand, osteoclast-suppressive, osteoblastogenic
  cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, IL-1Ra, OPG) released by Th2, M2 macrophages,
  physiologically activated resident fibroblasts, and Treg cells are suppressed (for
  simplicity, not shown in the picture). One of prominent regulatory immune cells,
  Treg, was reported to be deficient in RA synovium. Some negative feedback during
  inflammation-activated bone resorption represents IFN-γ and type 1 IFNs produced
  predominantly by MΦ, DC, and fibroblasts. They inhibit the RANKL signaling in osteoclast.
  One of crucial regulator of bone formation and remodeling represent wingless-type
  MMTV integration site family (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt ligands are
  soluble intercellular signaling molecules involved in embryogenesis. Wnt ligands
  enhance osteoblast differentiation and activity and they upregulate OPG. Wnt ligands
  (here, Wnt5a and Wnt3a) interact either with canonical receptor complex consisting
  of frizzled-related protein (FRP) and low-density lipoprotein-related receptor LRP5/6
  or with non-canonical single transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan
  receptor (Ror)1/2. On binding to canonical receptor, Wnt3a activates whereas Wnt5a
  inhibits osteoblasts. Furthermore, binding of Wnt5a to Ror2 upregulates the expression
  of the receptor for RANKL on osteoclast precursors. Therefore, Wnt5a promotes bone
  resorption and inhibits the bone remodeling. RA synovial activated fibroblasts (AFs)
  produce substantial amount of Wnt5a as well as inhibitors of the Wnt pathway: Dickkopf
  Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor (DKK)-1, DKK-2, DKK-3, secreted frizzled-related
  proteins (SFRP)2, and SFRP4 impairing osteoblast functions at sites of joint erosions,
  situation typical for RA.'
