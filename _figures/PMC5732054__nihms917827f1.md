caption: Both PMA, and ligands that require a receptor on the cell surface, activate
  intracellular kinases before NOX2 is recruited and activated. NOX2 produces superoxide
  (O2−), the substrate for SOD, which is then converted to hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen
  peroxide acts as the final anti-microbial product in this pathway in hemocytes.
  The kinases and receptors which lead to the activation of NOX2 are not conclusively
  characterized in B. glabrata, though the downstream NOX2-SOD pathway is believed
  to be conserved with that of mammals. The receptor initiating the hemocyte response
  is likely to be the primary difference between stimulation with the ligands used
  in this study (other than PMA).
