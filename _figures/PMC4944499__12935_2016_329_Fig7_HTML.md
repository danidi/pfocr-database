caption: CRT-knockdown correlates with the modulation of p53 and MAPK pathways. a
  Possible role of calreticulin in the p53 pathway. Activated p53 suppresses the processes
  of tumor formation and progression through the activation of SERPINB5, TP53I11 and
  TP53TG5. Calreticulin possibly blocks p53 stimulatory effects of these processes.
  b Possible contribution of calreticulin in the MAPK pathway. MEKs are activated
  following the attachment of growth factors and other ligands to the surface receptors.
  This leads to the activation of sequential phosporylation processes, enhancement
  of transcriptional activities and finally regulation of gene expression. MAP2K6
  and MAPK8 are two significantly modulated MAPKs following CRT knockdown (p < 0.05)
  while MKK1 and MKK4 have also shown some changes in their expression levels. Calreticulin
  possibly has a stimulatory effect on the production of MKKs
