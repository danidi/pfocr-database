caption: Cytoscape diagram of the functional interaction network representing proteins
  modulation in Pt1 interstitial fluid. The network was edited in order to get an
  effective visualization of the fold-change of each protein/node. In particular,
  we have used different colors for up- and down-regulated proteins, displayed in
  red and green, respectively, whereas the node size was made proportional to the
  fold-change of the corresponding modulated protein. Red circles represent up-regulated
  proteins in the pathological samples; green circles, up-regulated proteins in the
  healthy samples; red triangles, singleton proteins identified in the pathological
  samples; green triangles, singleton proteins identified in the healthy samples.
