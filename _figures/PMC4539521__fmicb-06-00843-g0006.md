caption: Changes in gene expression and MAPK signaling pathways in Cgasg1Δ and Cghal9Δ
  strains. Transcriptional profiling of genes involved in MAPK signaling pathways
  were compared, including the mating pheromone response, the cell wall integrity
  pathway, the spore wall assembly, the growth control pathway, and the HOG pathway.
  T1-T6 represent gene transcription levels of the wild-type, Cgasg1Δ and Cghal9Δ
  strains in YNB and YNB-pH 2.0 media, respectively.
