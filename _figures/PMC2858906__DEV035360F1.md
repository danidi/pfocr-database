caption: The main steps and key regulators in blood and lymphatic vasculature development.
  The development of the embryonic vasculature requires the differentiation of endothelial
  cells (ECs), as depicted schematically here. Within the mammalian embryo, the first
  step in this process is the formation of endothelial precursors (angioblasts) from
  mesodermal progenitors during gastrulation. The ETS transcription factor Etv2 is
  at the top of the pathway that leads to EC differentiation, and the Notch, BMP and
  Wnt signaling pathways regulate its expression. VEGF signaling is also important
  during the differentiation of angioblasts into ECs. Subsequently, Notch signaling
  is required to promote arterial endothelial cell identity, and the expression of
  the orphan nuclear receptor COUP transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) promotes venous
  endothelial cell fate by downregulating Notch signaling. Upon its activation in
  a subpopulation of the venous endothelial cells, the SRY-related HMG-domain transcription
  factor Sox18 cooperates with COUP-TFII to activate expression of the homeobox transcription
  factor Prox1. Prox1 expression is sufficient to specify lymphatic endothelial cell
  (LEC) fate. Later on, Prox1 expression becomes independent of external stimuli,
  as it regulates its own expression and maintains LEC identity.
