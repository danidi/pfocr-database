caption: Using PainNetworks to reproduce the NRG1-ErbB signalling pathway. (A) The
  pathway as reproduced by PainNetworks, showing the interactions involving NRG1/ErbB2/ErbB3.
  The genes from the original pathway are shown in red. In order to create this network,
  PainNetworks was queried using NRG1, ErbB2, and ErbB3; results were filtered so
  that only interactions that include these genes were shown; interactions between
  the nonquery genes were removed to prevent the number of edges in the network from
  obscuring the image. (B) The original pathway, taken from . Note that only a part
  of the pathway is reproduced, in order to stop the network becoming too large and
  difficult to interpret. (C) A second reproduction of the pathway. In this network,
  only direct interactions between the query genes are shown, and results have been
  limited to include only direct physical interactions.
