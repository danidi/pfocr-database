caption: 'Interaction between tumor metabolism and the mTOR signaling pathway. The
  mTOR pathway is closely related to tumor metabolism. Pathway 1: In bladder cancer,
  down-regulation of PKM2 expression reduces SREBP-1 expression through inactivated
  AKT/TSC/Rehb/mTORC1 pathway. The down-regulation of SREBP-1c inhibits FA generation
  by inhibiting FASN transcription, leading to the inhibition of tumor growth.). Pathway
  2: Up-regulation of TEF in tumors activates the Ras/Erk/TSC/Rehb/mTORC1 pathway.
  Activation of this pathway will promote the uptake of nutrients by tumor cells to
  meet the needs of the rapid growth of tumors. Pathway 3: HCC can increase sphingomyelin
  and cardiolipin production by activating mTORC2. Large amounts of sphingomyelin
  and cardiolipin are used to assemble cell membranes, which also meet the needs of
  rapid tumor proliferation. Pathway 4: The accumulation of BCAA can promote the occurrence
  and development of tumors by activating mTORC1. Pathway 5: A2aR, which is highly
  expressed in gastric cancer, binds adenosine to activate the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway.
  Pathway 6: In breast cancer, FFAs promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis by
  activating the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway. Pathway 7: The PI3K/AKT/mTORC1/SREBP pathway
  promotes breast cancer proliferation by inducing new lipid synthesis'
