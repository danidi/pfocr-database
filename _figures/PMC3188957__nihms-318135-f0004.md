caption: Highest confidence network of genes influenced by CLOCK knockdown. The network
  is relevant to “Cellular Growth and Proliferation, Cell Signaling and Interaction”.
  Transcripts which were up-regulated following CLOCK-knockdown are depicted in red,
  and down-regulated molecules are shown in green. Each interaction is supported by
  at least one literature reference identified in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge
  Base, with solid lines representing direct interactions, and dashed lines representing
  indirect interactions.
