caption: The CaSR in breast cancer. In breast cancer cells, stimulation of the CaSR
  increases PTHrP production. Therefore, the high local calcium concentrations surrounding
  bone metastases would be expected to stimulate PTHrP secretion, which would stimulate
  osteoblasts (Ob) to produce more RANKL, thereby driving more osteolysis and releasing
  growth factors (GF) from the bone matrix that stimulate tumor cell growth. As a
  result, activation of the CaSR facilitates a feed-forward, vicious cycle of bone
  resorption, tumor growth and osteolysis. In addition, the CaSR increase the PMCA2
  calcium pump activity to protect the breast cancer cells from calcium-mediated apoptosis,
  and regulates the TRPC1 calcium channel, which can stimulate proliferation. Finally,
  as outlined in Figure , activation of the CaSR promotes breast cancer cell proliferation
  and enhances cell survival by activating a nuclear PTHrP signaling pathway that
  inhibits p27kip1 and AIF respectively. These findings suggest that extracellular
  calcium may promote tumor cell growth by activating the CaSR, which, in turn, can
  activate PTHrP-dependent and PTHrP-independent signaling pathways that stimulate
  cancer cell proliferation, inhibit cancer cell death and promote osteoclastic bone
  resorption.
