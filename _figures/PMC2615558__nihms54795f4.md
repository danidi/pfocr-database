caption: Biological network of selected genes that were only induced more than twofold
  (P < 0.01) in the r1918-infected mouse lung compared with uninfected controls. This
  diagram shows the direct (solid lines) and indirect (dashed lines) interactions
  reported for these cell-death-related (blue shading) and immune-response-related
  (yellow shading) genes; grey denotes genes with multiple and/or undefined biological
  functions. Biological network analysis was performed by using Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis and showed statistical significance with Fisher’s exact test to calculate
  a P-value determining the probability that each biological function and/or disease
  assigned to that data set was due to chance alone (see Methods for details).
