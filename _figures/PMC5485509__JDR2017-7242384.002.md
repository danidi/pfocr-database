caption: Histone modifications regulate gene transcription involving renal fibrosis
  of diabetic kidney disease. TGF-β signaling pathway, activated by high glucose,
  will stimulate two types of epigenetic histone mechanisms including histone acetylation
  and histone methylation. TGF-β1 activates the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300/CBP,
  followed by the enrichment of H3K9/14Ac and HAT p300/CBP at the promoters of renal
  fibrotic genes, and then increases the transcriptions of fibrotic genes and EMT
  progress. After induced by TGF-β1, the methyltransferase SET7/9 enriches at fibrotic
  gene promoters, leading to increases of positive chromatin marks, such as H3K4me1,
  H3K4me2, and H3K4me3, and reductions of inhibitive marks including H3K9me2 and H3K9me3,
  at promoters of fibrotic genes. Eventually, the expressions of renal fibrotic genes
  are upregulated, which will result in the progression of DKD. Another pathway, myocardin-related
  transcription factor A (MRTF-A), also can be activated by high glucose. MRTF-A can
  regulate the histone acetylation and histone methylation of renal fibrotic genes
  by accelerating the recruitment of HAT p300/CBP and HMT WDR5 to fibrotic gene promoters,
  resulting in transcriptional activation. DKD, diabetic kidney disease; TGF-β, transforming
  growth factor β; MRTF-A, myocardin-related transcription factor A; HAT, histone
  acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HMT, histone methyltransferase; Smad,
  mothers against decapentaplegic homologue; ECM, excess extracellular matrix; EMT,
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
