caption: Signal transduction pathway of bitter (T2R), sweet (T1R2/3), and umami (T1R1/3)
  GPCRs in type II taste cells of the tongue. As described in the text and reviewed
  in [,], ligand binding to taste GPCRs results in Ca2+signaling through two G-protein-coupled
  pathways. Gβγ activation of phospholipase C isoform β2 (PLCβ2) results in production
  of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which activates the IP3 receptor (IP3R),
  an intracellular ion channel that allows calcium (Ca2+) release from the intracellular
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores []. Simultaneously, Gα-gustducin activates
  phosophodiesterases (PDEs), which reduce the levels of cyclic-AMP (cAMP) and decrease
  protein kinase A (PKA) activity []. PKA can phosphorylate and inhibit the activity
  of the type III IP3R [,], the major IP3R isoform found in type II taste cells [–],
  thus reduction of PKA activity can enhance IP3R3-mediated calcium signaling. Calcium
  activates the plasma membrane-localized cation channel TRPM5 [,], causing depolarization
  of cellular membrane potential, activation of voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels
  [], and generation of an action potential that results in ATP release [] through
  the CALHM1 ion channel [,] and subsequent purinergic neurotransmission of taste
  sensations.
