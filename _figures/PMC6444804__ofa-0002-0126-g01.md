caption: 'Fatty acid synthesis pathway: Excess glucose in the cell is first converted
  to pyruvate via glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria and
  is converted to acetyl-CoA and transported as citrate from mitochondria to the cytoplasm.
  ATP citrate lyase (ACL) then reconverts citrate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC) catalyses the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Both acetyl-CoA
  and malonyl-CoA are then used as the substrates for the production of palmitate
  catalysed by fatty acid synthase (FAS). Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) converts
  malonyl-CoA back to acetyl-CoA. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) is the enzyme
  importing long-chain fatty acyl-CoA into mitochondria for β-oxidation; CPT1 activity
  is allosterically inhibited by malonyl-CoA. The resulting saturated fatty acid molecule
  produced by FAS can be further metabolised depending on requirements, desaturated
  to form unsaturated fatty acids, derived to triglyceride molecules, or channelled
  to a range of phospholipids and derivatives for membrane and signalling functions.'
