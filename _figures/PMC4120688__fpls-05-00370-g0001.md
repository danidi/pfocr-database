caption: 'Thiamin biosynthesis pathway in plants. Abbreviations (bold) used for enzyme
  and transport functions assigned to genes of Arabidopsis and maize (Table ): THIC,
  hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate synthase; THI4, thiazole biosynthetic protein;
  TH1, hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate kinase/hydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase/thiamin-phosphate
  pyrophosphorylase (dual function enzyme); HETK, hydroxyethylthiazole kinase; TDPK,
  thiamin diphosphokinase; TPC, mitochondrial thiamin diphosphate carrier. Pathway
  intermediates and products include HMP-P, hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate; HMP-PP,
  hydroxymethylpyrimidine diphosphate; thiamin; ThDP, thiamin diphosphate; HET, hydroxyethylthiazole;
  HET-P, hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate. Dashed horizontal lines separate plastidial,
  cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments of the cell.'
