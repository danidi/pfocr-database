caption: We demonstrate that in the intestines, where PXR is expressed in intestinal
  epithelial cells in a crypt-villus gradient (apical IEC), in homeostasis, dietary
  tryptophan-derived bacterial metabolites (i.e. indole-3-propionic acid or IPA) tonically
  activate PXR and induce a down-regulation of TLR4, and its downstream signaling
  pathway. This results in modulating the abundance of TNF-α, which in turn modulates
  intestinal barrier function (i.e. permeability). In the context of preserved indole
  concentrations, loss of PXR (often observed in some Crohn’s ileitis and UC) will
  promote the inflammatory response. In corollary, with excess loss of dietary modulators
  (e.g., tryptophan/IPA), and/or specific indole metabolizing bacteria (e.g., antibiotics),
  there is increased permeability exacerbating underlying inflammatory pathology.
  In this model, restitution of signaling homeostasis, either by reconstituting intestinal
  loss of PXR or indole-metabolite producing bacteria and/or PXR activating bacterial
  metabolites (i.e. IPA via tryptophan catabolism), could result in abrogating pro-inflammatory
  signals and loss of barrier permeability in the context of intestinal inflammation.
