caption: 'An overview of biogenesis of (A): miRNAs, (B): circular RNAs and (C): lncRNAs.
  NcRNAs are first generated in the nucleus, transcribed by polymerase II giving rise
  to a long, sometimes hundreds of kilobases 5′ capped and 3′ polyadenylated transcripts.
  (A): Canonical miRNA: DGCR8 and Drosha bind and cleave the basal stem of pri-miRNAs
  to liberate the stem-loop pre-miRNA that enters the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (EXP5)
  where the pre-miRNA loop is cleaved by the RNase III Dicer and HIV-1 TAR RNA binding
  protein (TRBP) to form a mature RNA duplex. One of the two strands, the guide strand,
  is selected by one of the four Argonaute (AGO) proteins and loaded together with
  the passenger strand in the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). The passenger
  strand is degraded while the guide strand will become the mature miRNA. Non-canonical
  miRNAs: mirtrons: reside in introns at the exon junction site of the pre-mRNA, are
  spliceosome-dependent and have their own processing mechanism, which is independent
  from microprocessor complex. Mirtrons form lariats which are debranched under the
  action of lariat debranching enzymes (LDE) to fold into the pre-miRNA hairpin and
  proceed through the canonical miRNA pathway maturation. (B): Circular RNAs: The
  canonical spliceosomal machinery produces 3′-5′ backspliced circular pre-mRNA transcripts
  that are composed of exons (exonic circRNAs), or 2′-5′ lariats (intronic RNAs, ciRNAs)
  and exon-intron circRNAs (EIciRNAs). CiRNAs and ElciRNAs remain in the nucleus in
  contrast to the circRNAs, which are transported in the cytoplasm. (C): LncRNAs:
  Based on their location in the genome, lncRNAs may be long intergenic (lincRNAs),
  between two adjacent genes or intronic or within the intron of a protein-coding
  gene. Antisense lncRNAs as uaRNAs or eRNAs are transcribed in an opposite direction
  from the host gene. Intergenic and intronic lncRNAs are spliced from the pre-mRNA,
  through the spliceosomal machinery and can be polyadenylated or not. One of the
  functions of lncRNAs is to decoy miRNAs.'
