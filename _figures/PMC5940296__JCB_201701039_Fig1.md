caption: 'Latest advances in the interplay of physical and biochemical signaling pathways
  leading to transcription in the tumor microenvironment. Changes in the mechanical
  properties of the tumor microenvironment due to tumor initiation (stress-induced
  hyperproliferation) and late progression (stiffness-induced fibrosis) in the induction
  of the activation of two distinct pathways involved in tumorigenic transcription:
  the β-cat pathway and the Yap/Taz pathway, respectively. Hyperproliferative tumor-growth
  pressure activates the Ret kinase receptor (Tyr1062 phosphorylated), which in turn
  leads both to the inhibition of the β-cat interaction with E-cadherin through its
  phosphorylation of the Y654–β-cat and to the inhibition of β-cat degradation through
  phosphorylation of the Ser473-Akt and subsequent inactivation of the GSK3β (Ser9
  phosphorylated). As a consequence, the cytosolic β-cat concentration increases,
  favoring its translocation into the nucleus and the transcription of tumorigenic
  target genes, such as c-myc or zeb-1, in vivo. β-cat also induces the expression
  of microRNAs (miR-18a) that repress the expression of the tumor suppressor phosphatase
  and Tensin homologue directly or indirectly via HOAX9. ECM high stiffness induced
  by late tumor development causes conformational changes in the focal adhesion protein
  Talin, resulting in the recruitment of Vinculin and subsequent dephosphorylation
  of the transcriptional coactivator YAP at Ser 127. Dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ then
  shuttle into the nucleus, where they activate TEA domain family members (TEAD)–mediated
  gene expression. Activation of the membrane-anchored mechanosensor integrin also
  promotes Twist phosphorylation at Tyr107, releasing it from the anchoring membrane
  protein G3BP2, thus promoting its nuclear import and downstream expression of targets
  contributing to EMT, tumor proliferation, and metastasis. The response is increased
  through cross talk and cooperation between distinct pathways, i.e., integrin-induced
  AKT activation by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) also contributes to stabilize β-cat
  by inhibiting GSK3β. Green arrows or red blunted lines indicate activation or inhibition,
  respectively. Blue arrows indicate nuclear translocation.'
