caption: Roles of lipid peroxidation products in cytoprotective response of cell upon
  exposure to laminar shear stress. ROS generation occurs in response to shear stress
  and induces lipid peroxidation. The expression of genes encoding cytoprotective
  proteins are induced by Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway which are activated by lipid
  peroxidation products.
