caption: TRAF2 and TRAF3 cooperatively and constitutively repress the alternative
  NF-κB pathway, with BAFF-R signaling relieving this suppression. In all reports
  describing deficient BAFF-R signaling, blunted naive mature B cell survival and
  development is the result (a). When BAFF-R signaling is deficient, TRAF3 and TRAF2
  cooperate to constitutively degrade NIK and thus block activation of the alternative
  NK-κB pathway (a). It is thought that both TRAF2 and TRAF3 bind to NIK and cooperate
  in its degradation, with the heterocomplex of TRAF2/TRAF3/NIK depicted in (a) purely
  hypothetical. Upon ligation of BAFF-R by BAFF (b), TRAF3 is recruited to an atypical
  TRAF3-binding site located in the cytoplasmic tail of BAFF-R (depicted by the amino
  acid sequence PVPAT). TRAF3 is then targeted for degradation in a TRAF2-dependent
  manner. Owing to depleted TRAF3 levels, NIK is no longer the subject of continual
  degradation and can activate the alternative NF-κB pathway. Through NF-κB2 signaling,
  B cell survival and the transitional B cell developmental checkpoints occur.
