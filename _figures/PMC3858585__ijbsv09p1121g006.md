caption: Protein homeostasis is mainly maintained by HSF1 and FOXO, two downstream
  targets of the insulin pathway. The formation of biochemistry-detectable aggregates
  is a dynamic process, which is initiated by accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins
  (Phase I), facilitated by the formation of intermediates (Phase II) leading to the
  appearance of detectable aggregates (Phase III). This process can be intervened
  by different cellular strategies, including HSPs mediated folding/refolding, as
  well as proteasome- and autophagy-mediated degradation. HSPs, up-regulated by HSF1
  and FOXO, are mainly responsible for Phase I, in which the misfolded proteins can
  be either refolded to become functional normal proteins or degraded if refolding
  is unsuccessful. Once the intermediates are formed, autophagy starts playing a more
  important role. At the beginning of Phase II, the intermediates can still be handled
  by either HSPs or proteasome, and this response supposedly requires FOXO. At both
  Phase II and III, FOXO is also involved the induction of autophagy to clear large(r)
  protein aggregates.
