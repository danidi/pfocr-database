caption: 'The interplay between EVA71 infection and autophagy. On one hand, EVA71
  infection induces host autophagy activation through three major mechanisms as follows
  (red arrows): Firstly, unfolded or misfolded viral polypeptides during productive
  infection stimulate ER stress, which activates autophagy through inhibiting the
  activity of mTORC1 and activating ULK1 complex, BECN1 and ATGs. Secondly, EVA71
  inhibits the generation of miRNA (has-miR-30a), which targets BECN1, leading to
  an increase in both mRNA and protein levels of BECN1. Thirdly, anti-viral protein
  PML (promyelocytic leukemia) is suppressed by EV71. The deficiency of PML is reported
  to trigger autophagy. On the other hand, increased autophagy activity may promote
  the EVA71 life cycle at different phases (blue arrows). The autophagic component
  ATG4B may involve in viral polyprotein processing. Autophagy may also provide membrane-bounded
  replication compartments for viral replication. ATG5 negatively regulates host anti-viral
  protein KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP, also known as FBP2), which involves
  in inhibiting EVA71 RNA translation. APOBEC3G, restricting 5′ UTR replication capacity
  of EVA71, co-localizes with p62 to the autophagic puncta and is degraded through
  the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Syntaxin-17 (STX17) and synaptosome associated protein
  29 (SNAP29) interacting with EVA71 2BC promote viral maturation. Except for lysis,
  virions may release through the autophagosome-mediated exit without lysis (AWOL),
  which might involve in neurological infection. Besides, Toll-like receptors (TLR)
  signaling, represent the inhibition of innate immunity, is negatively regulated
  by EVA71 though autophagy (blue arrows)'
