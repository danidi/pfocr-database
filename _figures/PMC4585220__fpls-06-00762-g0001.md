caption: Overview of the glucosinolate pathway and the enzymatic function of AOP3.
  Selected genes and intermediates in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis from methionine.
  Dependent on the status of GS-ELONG containing the different MAMs, methionine undergoes
  1–6 chain elongation cycles before entering the core glucosinolate structure pathway.
  AOP3 catalyzes production of hydroxyalkyl glucosinolate from C3 side chained methylsulfinylalkyl
  glucosinolate.
