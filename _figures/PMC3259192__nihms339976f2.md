caption: A.) The role of S1P in leukemia. i.) Sphingosine is converted by SphK1 into
  S1P and is exported to the extracellular space, where it can then activate S1P receptors.
  ii.) Upregulation of SphK1 inhibits cytochrome c transport to the cytoplasm. iii.)
  S1P activates S1P1, which persistently activates the STAT3 pathway. iv.) STAT3 is
  transiently activated by IL-6 and travels to the nucleus for transcription. v.)
  Ceramide represses human telomerase (hTERT) promoter activity through HDAC-1-mediated
  deacetylation of sp3. B.) S1P signaling and apoptosis in lymphomas. i.) S1P2 exerts
  a negative effect on B-cell lymphoma development, as S1P2 knockout mice exhibit
  enhanced lymphoma formation. ii.) R(+)-methanandamide treatment results in decreased
  cell viability through increased ceramide synthase activity in mantle cell lymphoma.
  iii.) When SK is inhibited by DMS or SphK1 is inhibited by siRNA (*) in the presence
  of R(+)-methanandamide, cytochrome c induced apoptosis is potentiated in mantle
  cell lymphoma. C.) S1P signaling and apoptosis in Multiple Myeloma. i.) Mcl-2 anti-apoptotic
  effect is activated by S1P through S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3. ii.) IL-6 confers an anti-apoptotic
  effect through activation of SphK1. iii.) IL-6 activation of SphK1 mediates conversion
  of sphingosine into S1P to prevent apoptosis.
