caption: Proposed resveratrol-mediated regulation of p35 expression and Cdk5 activity.
  Resveratrol (RESV) reduces Cdk5 activity through inhibition of p35 expression. The
  inhibitory effects of resveratrol on p35 expression could be brought about at several
  levels, inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling pathway could affect Egr-1 expression, or
  activation of the p38 MAPK, JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways could downregulate
  p35 promoter activity.
