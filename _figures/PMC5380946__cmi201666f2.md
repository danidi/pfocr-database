caption: Sumoylation promotes the stability of cGas and Sting and regulates the kinetics
  of the response to a DNA virus. In uninfected or early-infected cells, cGas and
  Sting are sumoylated, which promotes their stability and activation by inhibiting
  K48-linked polyubiquitin-proteasomal and chaperone-mediated degradation (CMA) pathways,
  respectively, thus promoting an efficient innate immune response to a DNA virus.
  In the late phase of viral infection, Senp2 mediates the desumoylation of cGas and
  Sting, leading to their degradation by the proteasomal pathway and CMA, respectively,
  therefore turning off the innate immune response.
