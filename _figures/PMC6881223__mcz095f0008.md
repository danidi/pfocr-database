caption: Working model of auxin function during nitrogen and dark-mediated AR formation
  in Petunia hybrida cuttings. Red arrows indicate the direction of PAT and the pathway
  of auxin action, while auxin-related processes and factors are indicated by red
  letters. White arrows indicate the transport of amino acids. Blue and black arrows,
  ending with arrowheads vs. crossbars indicate promotive vs. inhibitory influences
  of nitrogen limitation and dark incubation, respectively. Broken lines indicate
  hypothetical relationships based on further literature discussed in the text. AA,
  amino acids; Arg, arginine; Gln, glutamine; NO, nitric oxide; IAA, indole-3-acetic
  acid; ET, ethylene; JA, jasmonic acid; Ck, cytokinins; Sl, strigolactones; PAT,
  polar auxin transport; Trp, l-tryptophan; YUC, YUCCA; TOR, target of rapamycin kinase.
