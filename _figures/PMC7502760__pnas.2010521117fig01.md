caption: Overview of genetic manipulations in yeast enabling selective production
  of MCFOHs. (A) Schematic illustration of the pathway engineering strategies in background
  strain ZWE243. AnACL, ATP-citrate lyase from Aspergillus nidulans; Ctp1, mitochondrial
  citrate transporter; FAS*, engineered endogenous fatty acid synthase for MCFAs production;
  Hfd1, aldehyde dehydrogenase; ′Mdh3, malate dehydrogenase without peroxisomal signal;
  MmACL, ATP-citrate lyase from Mus musculus; MmCAR, carboxylic acid reductase from
  Mycobacterium marinum; NpgA, phosphopantetheinyl transferase from Aspergillus nidulans;
  Pox1, fatty acyl-CoA oxidase; RtME, malic enzyme from Rhodosporidium toruloides;
  . The genes encoding ′Mdh3, RtME, MmACL, AnACL, and Ctp1 were overexpressed to increase
  the acetyl-CoA supply, and POX1 and HFD1 genes were deleted to avoid reverse reactions.
  R represents C3–C9. (B) MmCAR was modified using diverse approaches. A domain (residues
  88 to 541); PCP domain (residues 651 to 728); R domain (residues 731 to 1,174).
  (C) The predicted MCFA transporter gene TPO1 was deleted to prevent the secretion
  of MCFAs.
