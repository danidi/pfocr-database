caption: Regulation of RNase 7 induction. Mohammed et al. [] reported that RNase 7
  expression induced by IL-1β in human corneal epithelial cells is regulated by phosphorylation
  of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and subsequent activation
  of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to activation of the
  transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2. Simanski et al. [] demonstrated that IL-17A/IFNγ-induced
  RNase 7 expression in keratinocytes is mediated via STAT3 signaling. Wanke et al.
  [] reported that Staphylococcus-mediated RNASE7 induction is regulated via two different
  pathways. Staphylococcus epidermidis activates TLR-2 and a signaling cascade involving
  activation of the EGFR by EGFR ligands as well as activation of the transcription
  factor NFκB. Staphylococcus aureus activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways. Firat et al. []
  documented that EGFR signaling is involved in Trichophyton rubrum-induced RNase
  7 expression in keratinocytes. (PRRs = pattern recognition receptors; black arrows
  = activation; red curved arrow = induction; red “P” = phosphorylated).
