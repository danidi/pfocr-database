caption: 'The classic neutral pathway (left) is initiated by a highly regulated microsomal
  CYP7A1. The 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol is the rate-determining step in this
  biochemical pathway. Produced 7αHC is then converted to C4 by HSD3B7. C4 is the
  branch point to CA and CDCA. The main stream of the acidic pathway (right) is initiated
  by mitochondrial CYP27A1. This enzyme has been shown to hydroxylate cholesterol
  to form 24HC, 25HC, 26HC and CA27-Δ-3β-ol, which are then rapidly 7α-hydroxylated
  by microsomal CYP7B1 for reducing their regulatory abilities. In patients with CYP7B1
  deficiency, CA27-Δ-3β-ol is metabolized to CA24-Δ-3β-ol without 7α-hydroxylation.
  In human and mice, CH25H in the endoplasmic reticulum also converts cholesterol
  to 25HC. In addition, 24HC produced in the brain is carried to the liver by ApoE
  and is also metabolized as same manner. CYP39A1 and CYP7A1 are reported to have
  7α-hydroxylation activity toward 24HC in the liver. All the 7α-hydroxylated sterols
  and CA27-Δ–3β,7α-diol are led to CA24-Δ–3β,7α-diol by the multiple reactions of
  side chain cleaving, which is ultimately converted to CDCA. Most recently, Cyp3α11
  is reported for (25S)-26-hydroxylation of 7αHC in mouse evidencing that mouse is
  capable of synthesis of down-stream sterols and bile acids bypassing CYP27A1 and
  CYP7B1. In human hepatocytes, 24HC is reported to be metabolized not only to CDCA
  but also to CA. Also, in rabbit, 26HC is shown to be metabolized to CA. Bile acids
  are conjugated with the amino acids, taurine or glycine, by the action of amino
  acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT). Conjugated bile acids are secreted into bile via
  bile salt export pump (BSEP). In the colon, conjugated bile acids are de-conjugated
  and 7α-dehydroxylated by bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and 7α-dehydroxylase,
  respectively. Abbreviations: AKR1D1, aldo-keto reductase 1D1; CA, cholic acid; CDCA,
