caption: Crosstalk between complement and TLR pathways. C5a/C5aR signaling pathway
  can cooperate with TLR-4 activation by LPS on macrophages. Intermediate signaling
  pathways JNK and MAPK are activated and thus lead to pro-inflammatory effect by
  TNF-α, IL6, and IL1-β synthesis. On dendritic cells (DCs), TLR-4 and C5aR cooperate
  in different manner between mice and human. In vivo experiments have demonstrated
  an implication in Th1 cells expansion, whereas in human, an anti-inflammatory role
  of TLR-4/C5aR collaboration has been described by an antagonized effect on IL-12
  and IL-23 synthesis by DC.
