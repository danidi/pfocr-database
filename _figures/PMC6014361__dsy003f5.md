caption: Duplication of genes related to DDR in E. heterophyllum. (A) Genes involved
  in the DDR pathway and cell cycle control that are duplicated in E. heterophyllum.
  Duplicated genes are shown in light brown. HR, homologous recombination; NHEJ, non-homologous
  end-joining. (B) A schematic picture of the plant cohesin complex indicating duplication
  of genes encoding two cohesin subunits, SCC3 and SMC3. The numbers of the corresponding
  genes in E. yunnanense and E. heterophyllum are shown in square brackets in the
  format [E. yunnanense, E. heterophyllum]. The expression profiles in FPKM (fragments
  per kilobase per million reads mapped) of paralogs are plotted as log10 values.
  See online version for color display.
