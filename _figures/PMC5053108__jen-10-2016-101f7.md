caption: 'Role of miR-9 in zebrafish brain development.Notes: (A) Zebrafish forebrain:
  In the forebrain, miR-9 inhibits proneural gene her6 and targets Fgf signaling pathway
  genes (dusp6, pea3). However, detailed study is not available on this account. (B)
  Zebrafish midbrain and hindbrain: The miR-9 regulates MHB by limiting Fgf8 and its
  receptor Fgfr1 expression within the MHB. The miR-9 regulates the progenitor state
  in the MH by regulating her5 and her9. (C) Zebrafish hindbrain: The miR-9 is regulated
  by Notch signaling and its target gene, her6. The miR-9 regulates proliferation
  by inhibiting Zic5 and differentiation by inhibiting elavl3.Abbreviations: MH, midbrain–hindbrain;
  MHB, MH boundary; miR-9, miRNA-9.'
