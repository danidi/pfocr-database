caption: 'Asymmetry in the circuitry for ON versus OFF S cone-based opponency in the
  primate retina. A: left panel plots spatial tuning (response amplitude as a function
  of spatial frequency) of S ON and L+M OFF responses from a macaque blue ON small
  bistratified ganglion cell. Overlap of the spatial tuning plots shows the spatially
  coextensive S ON and L+M OFF fields. Gaussian fits to the data are illustrated by
  the inset profiles with Gaussian radii indicated. Right panel: top, spike discharge
  to sine-modulated S versus L+M stimuli. Bottom, L+M response is preserved after
  attenuation of the ON pathway and inhibitory transmission. B: circuitry for the
  small bistratified cell. S ON and L+M OFF responses arise from parallel ON and OFF
  pathway excitatory inputs to the bistratified ganglion cell dendritic tree. ON and
  OFF L+M surrounds arising from H1 and H2 cell feedback to cones appear to largely
  cancel at the ganglion cell level. C: in contrast to the small bistratified cell,
  the S OFF pathway originates in the midget circuit with a private-line OFF midget
  bipolar cell connected to each S cone in central retina and an L+M ON surround provided
  by H2 horizontal cell feedback to S cones. D: in the retinal periphery, OFF ganglion
  midget cells receive convergent input from S, L, and M cones, eliciting a weaker
  S cone contribution to the receptive field and more complex chromatic tuning (see
  text for discussion and references).'
