caption: WW domain protein roles in genomic stability. Upon DNA damage, ATR and ATM
  get activated. When activated, they can phosphorylate and activate the E3 ligase
  ITCH. Active ITCH can further ubiquitinate and activate WWOX leading to its translocation
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, WWOX, in a positive feedback loop activates ATM
  and ATR and enhances DNA damage response and repair. Moreover, WWOX can interact
  with BRCA1 and enhance Non-homologous end joining over homologus recombination repair
  pathway. E3s also play roles in genomic stability too. SMURF2 increase genomic stability
  by inhibiting the activity of RNF20/hBre1A, the major ubH2B-specific E3 and by stabilizing
  topoisomerase IIa (Topo IIa). ITCH enhances genomic integrity by increasing the
  efficiency of DNA damage repair (DDR). Upon DNA damage ITCH is activated by ATM.
