caption: General strategies for the combinatorial biosynthesis of PKs and NRPs. (a)
  Through domain truncation and AT domain exchange, the type I aureotin PKS was morphed
  to produce its homologue luteoreticulin (3) in the heterologous host S. albus. (b)
  The tetracycline SF2575 biosynthetic pathway harboring a type II PKS and modifying
  enzymes was reconstituted in the heterologous host S. lividans. Subsequent inactivation
  of the methyltransferase gene generated tetracycline analogue (4). (c) Novel lipopeptide
  (5) was produced by replacement of module 11 of daptomycin NRPS (DptBC) with the
  corresponding module from related A15454 NRPS (LptC) in the native daptomycin-producing
  S. roseosporus. Modified structures from natural products are highlighted in blue.
