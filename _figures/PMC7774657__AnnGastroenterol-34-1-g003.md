caption: 'Schematic illustration of aspirin’s role in colorectal cancer prevention
  Cyclooxygenase (COX) dependent pathway (Left panel): Inhibition of COX-1 in platelets
  and COX-2 in epithelial cells. Prostaglandins (PGs) are important derivatives of
  arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) play a role in platelet
  aggregation, atherosclerosis, and vasoconstriction. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor
  is involved in cell growth, survival, and proliferation. It is an essential target
  for hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPDG). COX metabolism also involves gene
  by environment (GxE), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs2920421 and rs2965667,
  and prostaglandin M (PG-M). COX independent pathway (Right panel): WNT β-catenin
  is an important target for aspirin by inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).
  It is also inhibited by the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) induced
  by the paracrine effect of PGE2. Chromosome 8q24 has an important SNP, rs6983267,
  which lowers the expression of MYC proto-oncogene via WNT signaling. Furthermore,
  aspirin mediates its effects via a mitogenic activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
  cascade, nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) and resulting apoptosis (via c-myc and
  c-fos). Aspirin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by targeting soluble tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 2 and macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC). These
  actions induce a reduction in the generation of cytokines interleukin (IL) -1 and
  -6, TNF and chemokines'
