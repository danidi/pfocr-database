caption: Schematic diagram depicting the sequence of events triggered by ATP-induced
  activation of P2X7Rs in osteoblasts and the distribution of P2X7Rs, Panx1 channels
  and Cx43 when forming gap junction channels and hemichannels. (a) Extracellular
  ATP (exogenously added or release from mechanically stimulated cells) diffuses (1),
  binds and activates ionotropic P2X7Rs (2), resulting in influx of Ca2+ (3) and P2X7R
  interaction with Panx1 channels (4). (b) P2X7 activation induces opening of Panx1
  channels, providing a pathway for ATP efflux and for YoPro dye uptake (5). Autocrine
  P2X7R activation by released ATP triggers further ATP-induced ATP release from stimulated
  cells (6) and enhances paracrine signaling (7) to the neighboring cells. Gap junction
  channels formed of Cx43 also play a role in intercellular signaling through exchange
  of second messengers.
