number: Figure 3
caption: 'Starvation causes activation of autophagy and MAPK14 phosphorylation. Active
  MAPK14 upregulates SLC2A3 expression through HIF1A stabilization and increases glucose
  uptake. In addition, MAPK14 induces a proteasome-dependent degradation of PFKFB3,
  which results in an increase of PPP at the expense of glycolysis. PPP enhancements
  fuels NADPH production, leading to reduced ROS levels and autophagy. Abbreviations:
  mitogen-activated protein kinase 14(MAPK14), Solute Carrier Family 2 (Facilitated
  Glucose Transporter), Member 3(SLC2A3), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), reduced form of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH), reactive oxygen species (ROS).'
