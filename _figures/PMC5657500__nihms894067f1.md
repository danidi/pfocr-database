caption: 'A. Overview. Both apoptosis and necrosis can be initiated through death
  receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Regardless of pathway, the defining molecular
  event in apoptosis is activation of caspases, which are a class of cysteine proteases.
  Caspase activation takes place in complex IIa and complex IIb in the death receptor
  pathway (see panel B) and the apoptosome in the mitochondrial pathway. Apoptosome
  assembly is triggered by cytochrome c, which is released through permeabilization
  of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The defining events in necrosis involve activation
  of receptor interacting proteins 1 and 3 (RIP1 and RIP3), which are kinases, in
  the death receptor pathway, and opening of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability
  transition pore (PTP) in the mitochondrial pathway.B. Death receptor signaling.
  The binding of TNF-α to TNFR1 stimulates the assembly of Complex I, which signals
  cell survival. This complex includes the adaptor protein TRADD, the kinase referred
  to as receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), and several E3-ubiquitin ligases. The
  addition of amino to carboxyl-linked ubiquitin chains onto RIP1 by linear ubiquitin
  chain assembly complex (LUBAC) provides a platform for the activation of the transcription
  factor NF-κB. The attachment of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains to RIP1 by cellular
  inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and 2) and TRAF2 provides a platform
  for the activation of TAK1, which in turn activates NF-κB and mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs). TAK1 may also be activated more directly through TRAF2-mediated
  ubiquitylation. De-ubiquitylation of RIP1 leads to disassembly of Complex I and
  formation several cytoplasmic complexes. Complex IIa includes TRADD, Fas-associated
  death domain (FADD), and procaspase-8 - the result being caspase activation and
  apoptosis. Complex IIb (the “ripoptosome”), involving RIP1, FADD, and procaspase-8,
  also induces apoptosis but through RIP1 phosphorylation. In addition, caspase-8
  activation inhibits necroptosis by cleaving RIP1 and RIP3. If caspase-8 is inhibited,
  however, Complex IIc (the “necrosome”) may form, which signals necroptosis through
  the phosphorylation and interaction of RIP1 and RIP3. Events that mediate necroptosis
  downstream of RIP3 include: (a) phosphorylation and recruitment of MLKL, which oligomermizes
  to cause plasma membrane dysfunction; (b) activation of metabolic enzymes that generate
  oxidative stress; and (c) activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
  II-delta (CaMKII-δ) leading to opening of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability
  transition pore.'
