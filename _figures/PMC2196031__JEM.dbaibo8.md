caption: Schematic presentation of the proposed sites of inhibition of the ceramide
  pathway by CrmA and Bcl-2. Activation of sphingomyelinases requires several stages
  of proteolytic processing (). The inhibition of ceramide accumulation by CrmA is
  hypothesized to be due to its ability to inhibit cysteine or serine proteases probably
  involved in the processing of sphingomyelinase(s). Bcl-2 functions further downstream
  by inhibiting effector molecules involved in the execution of the death order without
  interfering with the generation of ceramide. The specific target of Bcl-2 is not
  yet known. The diagram illustrates the possibility that either proteases or regulatory
  molecules are targeted by Bcl-2.
