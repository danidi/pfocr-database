caption: a Cells treated with cisplatin in a 3D context present significant induction
  of ATR-Chk1 pathway, which in turn is essential for REV3L upregulation, translesion
  DNA synthesis (TLS), and cellular survival. In contrast, b under two-dimensional-cultured
  conditions, no significant levels of p-Chk1 and REV3L induction were detected, leading
  to replication fork obstruction and elevated cellular sensitivity to this chemotherapy.
  Through a similar mechanism, blockage of cisplatin-mediated induction of ATR-Chk1
  signaling, by co-treatment with VE-821, reverts the 3D-microenvironmet-associated
  resistance to cisplatin
