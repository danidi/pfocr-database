caption: Proposed signaling regulation of MT1-MMP and Sp1 in prostate cancer cell
  lines. (A) Invasive prostate cancer PC-3N and PC-3 cells express high levels of
  MT1-MMP, which is dependent on Sp1 transcriptional regulation. Inhibition of constitutively
  active PI3K or JNK pathways, both pharmacologically and genetically, decreases MT1-MMP
  and Sp1 expression. The exact mechanisms of these pathways in regulating Sp1 are
  not known. (B) DU-145 prostate cancer cells express lower levels of MT1-MMP compared
  to PC-3 and PC-3N cells, which is also dependent on Sp1 transcriptional regulation.
  Inhibition of constitutively active ERK, both pharmacologically and genetically,
  reduces MT1-MMP expression. This model indicates that varying levels of MT1-MMP
  in prostate cancer cell lines are regulated through the differential activation
  of signaling pathways and Sp1. The model suggests that AKT and JNK pathways mediate
  a more invasive phenotype than the ERK pathway through increased modulation of MT1-MMP
  expression.
