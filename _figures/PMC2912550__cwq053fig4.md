caption: Mechanisms for the synthesis of GDP-fucose and its transport into the secretory
  pathway. In the cytoplasm, GDP-mannose is converted into GDP-fucose by GMD and FX
  enzymes. In mammalian cells, an alternative, salvage pathway exists, which uses
  the free fucose transported from the extracellular space or from the lysosome to
  make GDP-fucose (). FK stands for fucose kinase; GPP stands for GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase.
  The salvage pathway allows the rescue of GMD and Fx mutations by providing fucose
  in the medium. Drosophila cells lack the salvage pathway. Efr and Gfr transport
  GDP-fucose into the ER and Golgi lumens, respectively. Genetic and biochemical experiments
  indicate that Gfr is essential for the addition of fucose to N-glycans on Notch
  and other proteins in Drosophila larvae. For the addition of O-linked fucose to
  Notch—which occurs in the ER—Gfr and Efr function redundantly. Since Gfr resides
  in the Golgi, retrograde transport of GDP-fucose from Golgi to the ER (the dashed
  arrow) is likely to underlie the ability of Gfr to compensate for the lack of Efr
