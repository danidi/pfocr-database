caption: A stepwise demonstration of the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry
  site (HCV IRES) translation initiation pathway. The specified arrangement of the
  HCV IRES domains and ribosomal subunits along with the particular placement of a
  subset of canonical eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) required to
  assemble the pre-initiation 48S and 80S complexes are depicted. The red arrows indicate
  eIF2-GTP-independent translation under stress (upon eIF2α phosphorylation), when
  protein synthesis continues with eIF5B or other reported factors (eIF2A, eIF2D).
  Mutations in different HCV IRES domains that may inhibit particular stages of translation
  complex formation are shown under the arrows.
