caption: p53 effects multiple areas of cellular metabolism. p53 can repress the transcription
  of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4. TIGAR is upregulated by p53 to suppress
  glycolysis and divert the pathway into the pentose phosphate pathway. Not only does
  p53 effect glucose metabolism but also plays a role in mitochondrial respiration
  and ATP production via the upregulation of SCO2 and GLS2. SCO2 is essential for
  mediating the formation and stabilization of the COX complex and thus critical for
  oxidative phosphorylation. GLS2 is a protein that catalyzes glutamine into glutamate.
  Glutamate can then be converted to α-ketogluterate, a key component in the Krebs
  cycle.
