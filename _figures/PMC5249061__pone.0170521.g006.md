caption: A) For young mice it was determined that the key miRNA signature has impact
  on MYC and JUN along with other mRNAs determined using CluePedia Cytoscape plugin.
  The miRNA-mRNA interactions were determined from three different databases as indicated
  by the figure legend. B) Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) the functional impact
  of the miRNA signature is shown for young mice comparing Smurf2T/T mice to wild-type
  (WT) mice. C) Using IPA we predicted the impact of the miRNA signature on JUN (indicated
  by blue color being downregulated). MYC expression is known to be downregulated
  in Smurf2T/T mice from previous publications []. D) Western for JUN protein expression
  on tumor samples from Smurf2T/T mice (lanes 2–7), spleen from wild-type (WT) C57BL/6
  mice for the same age the tumor samples (lane 1), and spleen from young wild-type
  mice (lane 8) and young Smurf2T/T mice (SM2) (lane 9).
