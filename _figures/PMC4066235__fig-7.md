caption: miRNA regulation of radiation-induced apoptosis. Excessive radiation-induced
  DNA damage leads to activation of apoptosis. Here, we depict two mechanisms by which
  apoptosis is initiated in response to IR. Activated p53 transcriptionally activates
  pro-apoptotic factors, including PUMA, FAS-R, and BAX, while inhibiting transcription
  of anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and MCL1. Activation of pro-apoptotic factors BAX,
  BAK, and BIM in the mitochondria, ultimately, results in cytochrome c release into
  the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c forms a complex with APAF-1 and caspase 9, which activates
  downstream caspases 3 and 7. Activation of caspase 3 and 7 can also be accomplished
  via death-receptor signaling. FAS-R, a death-receptor, is activated by its ligand,
  FAS-L, resulting in caspase 8 activation and subsequent activation of caspases 3
  and 7. miRNA regulation is significantly involved in the regulation of apoptosis
  signaling, especially with regard to the Bcl-2-like family of pro- and anti-apoptotic
  factors. miRNAs in bold regulate multiple targets within the abridged pathway depicted
  here. Underlined miRNAs are involved throughout DDR. FAS-R, Fas receptor.
