number: Figure
caption: Figure shows the endothelial response to a high salt diet. Transforming growth
  factor β1 is increased in response to a high salt diet that triggers downstream
  phosphorylation of SMAD2 (see text for discussion). Activation of this pathway triggers
  a decrease in Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) that
  in turn permits an increase in Akt activity and phosphorylation of the endothelial
  isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Endothelial nitric oxide restores endothelial
  function. Problems in this transduction pathway can lead to an impaired response
  to a high salt diet and endothelial dysfunction.
