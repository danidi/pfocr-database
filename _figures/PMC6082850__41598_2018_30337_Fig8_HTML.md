caption: Schematic diagram of the antidepressant and anxiolytic mechanism of acupuncture
  in a PTSD rat model. Acupuncture stimulation at HT8 release MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt.
  Both pathways activate mTOR through phosphorylation. mTOR then phosphorylates and
  activates p70S6K. In parallel, mTOR hyperphosphorylates 4E-BP-1, reducing its interaction
  with eIF4E. Together, released of eIF4E from 4E-BP-1 disinhibit protein translation,
  producing more synaptic proteins such as PSD95, Syn1 and GluR1, as well as BDNF.
  This facilitates increased synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, and leads to antidepressant
  and anxiolytic behavior in rodents. However, pretreatment with the mTOR inhibitor
  rapamycin prevented the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of acupuncture at
  HT8. Lines with arrow indicate stimulus connections. Lines with a flattened ends
  indicates inhibitory connection. The dashed lines indicate the pathways where activity
  decreased as a result of acupuncture stimulation.
