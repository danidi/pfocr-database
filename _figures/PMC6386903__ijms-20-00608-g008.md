caption: Mechanism of suppression of FN-induced EMT by cirsiliol in B16F10 metastatic
  melanoma cells. FN activated PI3K/Akt phosphorylation which, in turn, might have
  upregulated Twist and Snail (independently or via NFκB p65). Snail itself or through
  interaction with Twist might have suppressed E-cadherin. Cirsiliol was effective
  in inhibiting phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which in turn caused downregulation
  N-cadherin and upregulation of E-cadherin. The signaling pathways indicated within
  the red dotted line box are already established mechanisms. FN, fibronectin; ⊥,
  pathways inhibited by cirsiliol; → unidirectional mode of action; ↔, bidirectional
  mode of action.
