caption: Three routes for isoleucine biosynthesis (see the text). Pyruvate and acetyl-CoA
  are the precursors for Ile synthesis via the pyruvate pathway (route 1) (), threonine
  and pyruvate are the precursors for Ile synthesis via the threonine pathway (route
  2) (, , ), and glutamate and pyruvate are the precursors for Ile synthesis via the
  glutamate pathway (route 3) (, ). α-Ketobutyrate is a common intermediate in these
  three pathways.
