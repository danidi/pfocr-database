caption: 'Essential gaps in key Y. pestis CO92 metabolic pathways. A. The last step
  during each fatty acid elongation cycle involves the reduction of an enoyl-ACP intermediate.
  In other Enterobacteria such as E. coli and S. Typhimurium, FabI catalyzes this
  step; however, the current annotation of the YP CO92 genome does not contain fabI.
  B. The enzyme ArgD catalyzes the sixth step in the nine-step lysine biosynthesis
  pathway, but argD (YPO0170) is disrupted in YP CO92. YPO1962 has the greatest homology
  to YPO0170 within the Y. pestis CO92 genome, and we hypothesize here that YPO1962
  can replace the function of YPO0170. Note: although each reaction in each pathway
  is depicted as unidirectional, some are reversible.'
