caption: Recognition of pathogen by immune cells initiates a genetic program that
  promotes use of numerous metabolic pathways for biogenesis (i.e. nucleotide synthesis)
  and energy production (i.e. glycolysis, TCA cycle). Metabolites involved in glycolysis
  (teal), TCA cycle (orange), and one-carbon metabolism (light-green) can play critical
  roles as substrates such as acetyl-CoA and SAM, for histone acetylation and methylation
  respectively, or cofactors such as 2-oxoglutarate and NAD+, for demethylation of
  DNA and histone deacetylation respectively. Epigenetic enzymes (blue) catalyze the
  addition (HAT, HMT or DNMT) and removal (HDAC, JHDM, or TET) of epigenetic marks
  and can be impacted by multiple metabolic pathways. Metabolites shown to be controlled
  by pathways relevant in T cells or macrophages (bold) are critical for energy production
  (i.e. lactate, acetyl-CoA) and proliferation (i.e. serine). Flexibility in metabolic
  pathway usage is reflected by the small network depicted here; for example, 3-phosphoglcerate
  can be converted to serine for use in one-carbon metabolism. Clear links between
  activity of epigenome modifying enzymes and metabolites relevant in T cells and
  macrophages that will impact the epigenetic landscape of activated cells can be
  drawn.
