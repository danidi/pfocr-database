caption: Diagram demonstrating the basic principles of the ‘cholinergic anti inflammatory
  pathway’. Cytokines such as those of the TNF and IL-1 family released from inflamed
  tissue activate the sensory (afferent) vagus nerve relaying information of the occurring
  inflammation to the brain. Subsequent (motor) efferent vagal nerve activity then
  leads to ACh release within the inflamed peripheral tissues lying proximal to the
  nerve. The free ACh then binds to the α7AChRs on immune competent cells and down
  regulates localised inflammation (Adapted from Pavlov et al. [])
