caption: 'Potential mechanisms of ART-induced mitochondrial toxicity. A. Biosynthesis
  of endogenous nucleotides under normal conditions: Deoxyribonucleotise (dN) is transported
  into the cell through nucleoside transporter (NT). dN is phosphorylated to deoxyribonucleotide
  triphosphate (dNTP) in a step-wise fashion using deoxyribonucleoside kinases such
  thymidine kinase (TK1) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK); nucleoside monophosphate
  kinases (NMPKs); and nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs): the salvage pathway.
  dNTP is also produced via the de novo pathway through the reduction of ribonucleotide
  diphosphate (NDP) to deoxyribonucleotide (dNDP) catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase
  (RR). dNTP is used for the synthesis of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial
  dNTP arises from both an import from the cytosol and synthesis in the mitochondrial
  through the salvage pathway. Mitochondrial DNA contains genes that encodes for essential
  proteins of the electronic transport chain (ETC). Monophosphates of both endogenous
  and nucleoside analog nucleotides can be efflux by ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) proteins
  in cell membrane. B. Biosynthesis of nucleotides during ART-induced mitochondrial
  toxicity. Nucleoside analogs (NA) are metabolized in a step-wise fashion catalyze
  by the enzymes of the salvage pathway in the cytosol and mitochondria. The metabolism
  and usage of nucleoside analog triphosphates (NA-PPP) with time lead to competitive
  and feedback inhibition of the metabolism of endogenous nucleotides. Decreased synthesis
  of ribonucleotides (NMP, ribonucleotide monophosphate; NDP, ribonucleotide diphosphate)
  and dNTPs result in decreased DNA synthesis in the nucleus and mitochondrial; indicated
  by fading of the endogenous pathway. Analog triphosphate (NA-PPP) incorporation
  in DNA results inhibition of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Compensatory
  attempt at increasing DNA synthesis results in increased expression of deoxyribonucleoside
  kinases (TK1/2, dCK). The excess of analog metabolites could contribute to five
  potential mechanisms of mitochondrial toxicity numbered in the diagram: [1] Competitive
  inhibition of nucleotide metabolism resulting in decreased DNA synthesis; [2] Inhibition
  of Pol-γ by NA-PPP; [3] Compensatory proliferation of mtDNA; [4] Direct effect of
  ART on mitochondrial DNA replication and translation processes; [5] Production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS).'
