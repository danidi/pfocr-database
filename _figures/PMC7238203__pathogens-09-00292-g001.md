caption: 'DNA sensing mechanisms through the cGAS/STING/TBK1 signaling pathway. Upon
  DNA binding, cGAS undergoes a conformational change that leads to its activation.
  Activated cGAS catalyzes the synthesis of the second messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (2′3′-cGAMP)
  from ATP and GTP, which is a STING ligand. 2′3′-cGAMP binding to STING results in
  the translocation of STING from the ER compartment to the ER–Golgi intermediate
  compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi apparatus, triggering the activation of the following
  downstream signaling pathways: STING recruits autophosphorylated TBK1, which then
  phosphorylates STING, thereby promoting the docking of the transcription factor
  IRF3 to the phosphorylated STING residue, resulting in the TBK1-dependent phosphorylation
  of IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where it
  transcriptionally activates IFNs genes. The binding between E7 and the mitochondrial
  NLRX1, which in turns contributes to enhance STING turnover, is also indicated.
  The symbol ┫ indicates the specific target of the inhibitory action of E6 or E7
  oncoprotein. When a direct binding of the oncoprotein to a specific target has been
  demonstrated, this is indicated by the symbol ●. Abbreviations: cGAS, cyclic GMP–AMP
