caption: A schematic presentation of the rationale of targeting PARPs for cancer therapy.
  Inhibition of PARPs impairs the repair for DNA single-strand breaks (SSB), which
  then accumulate in the cell. When colliding the progressing replication forks, those
  SSB are converted to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that are generally repaired
  through the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Defects in the HR pathway such
  as the functional mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 disable the repair for those DSB and
  confer lethality to them. This is so called as “synthetic lethality”. On the other
  hand, if the HR pathway functions normally under PARP inhibition, additional introduction
  of exogenous SSB as induced by irradiation or certain DNA damaging drugs may produce
  excessive DSB that overwhelm the HR repair. Consequently, those excessive, unrepaired
  DSB kill the cell.
