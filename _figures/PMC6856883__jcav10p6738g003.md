caption: The regulatory roles of lncRNAs in TAM by regulating classic signaling pathway.
  LncRNA CamK-A motivates Ca2+-dependent NF-κB in oxygen deficiency situation, which
  lead to increase inflammation cytokines and macrophages recruitment, resulting tumorigenesis
  ultimately. TAM-derived exosomes inhibit the migration of tumor through miR-146b-5p/TRAF6/NF‑κB/MMP2
  signaling pathway. However, two lncRNAs from EOC exosome can reverse this suppression.
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB. PNCK, pregnancy upregulated non-ubiquitously expressed
  CaM kinase. TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6. MMP2, matrix
  metalloproteinase2.
