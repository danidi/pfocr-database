caption: The RIP1 ubiquitination that inhibited by spermidine resulting in the decreased
  phosphorylation of the IKK complex including the most important p65 transcription
  pathways. Afterward, the inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a, were
  decreasingly secreted by FLS. The decreased infiltration of inflammatory cytokines
  on cartilage, which ameliorate the degenerative expression of chondrocytes including
  Aggrecan, Collagen10, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, MMP3 and MMP13, and finally alleviate the
  progression of OA.
