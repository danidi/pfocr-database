caption: The metabolism of the fat body on a rich diet favors pyruvate/acetyl-CoA
  production and macromolecule biosynthesis. (A) Diagram of diet-dependent changes
  in the levels of metabolic enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, citric acid cycle,
  and electron transport chain. Enzymes showing relatively high or low abundance on
  a rich diet are highlighted in red or blue, respectively. Regulatory enzymes are
  indicated by a black rectangular outline. Poor to Rich iTRAQ (isobaric tags for
  relative and absolute quantification) ratio is shown for each metabolic enzyme.
  Solid arrows indicate direct conversion of metabolites, whereas dashed arrows signify
  multiple enzymatic steps. Regulatory enzymes that contribute to pyruvate/acetyl-CoA
  production, including Hex-C (Hexokinase-C), Pepck (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase),
  AcCoAS (acetyl-CoA synthase), and ATPCL (ATP citrate lyase) are upregulated on a
  rich diet, whereas regulatory enzymes in the citric acid cycle and electron transport
  chain are downregulated on a rich diet, suggesting that the fat body favors building
  block production. (B) Live adipocytes from females maintained for 16 hr either on
  rich or poor diet simultaneously stained with the membrane potential-dependent mitochondrial
  dye tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) and the membrane potential-independent
  mitochondrial dye Mitotracker Green FM (MTGFM). Scale bar, 40 μm. (C and D) Average
  normalized mitochondrial activity (TMRE/MTGFM ratio) (C) and average MTGFM intensity
  (proportional to total mitochondrial mass) (D) in adipocytes from females illustrated
  in (B) (n = 31 adipocyte fields for Rich and n = 32 adipocyte fields for Poor; 16
  females were examined for each dietary condition). n.s., not significant, Student’s
  t-test.
