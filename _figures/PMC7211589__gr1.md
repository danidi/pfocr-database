caption: This figure illustrates the differential glucose metabolism in a healthy
  macrophage and in a COVID-19-activated macrophage. In a healthy macrophage, pyruvate,
  a glucose metabolite, enters the mitochondria where it is enzymatically converted
  to acetyl-coenzyme A by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Acetyl-coenzyme
  A feeds the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and supports oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS). Additionally, acetyl-coenzyme A is an essential co-factor/substrate for
  the rate limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase
  (AANAT). This allows for melatonin to be regularly produced in healthy macrophages;
  melatonin functions intracellularly and is released into the cellular microenvironment,
  but not into the blood. In COVID-19-activated mitochondria, via HIF-1α, mTOR, etc.,
  the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is strongly upregulated and inhibits
  PDC (red X). Thus, acetyl-coenzyme A is not synthesized and mitochondrial OXPHOS
  falters with ATP synthesis occurring in the cytosol via aerobic glycolysis (Warburg
  effect). Similarly, mitochondrial melatonin production is shut down so the cell
  is deprived of an essential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent and of an immune-enhancer
  so the elevated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines goes uncontested and the
  cytokine storm is a result. 5-HT = serotonin; ASMT = acetylserotonin methyltransferase;
  CoA = coenzyme A; IMM = inner mitochondrial membrane; HIF-1α = hypoxia inducible
  factor-1α; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; NAS = N-acetylserotonin; OMM = outer
  mitochondrial membrane; PPP = pentose phosphate pathway.
