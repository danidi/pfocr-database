caption: The pathways were analyzed on the basis of the KEGG pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).
  The levels of the identified metabolites that were elevated and depleted in obese
  mice, compared to lean mice, are color coded as red and blue, respectively, and
  the metabolites in gray were not identified in our study. Direction of change is
  shown for all obese mice including males and females. For the direction of change
  based on gender, see  and . The metabolites with asterisk are shown several times
  in this diagram to avoid the complexity of the pathways. The metabolites with sharp
  indicate the significant ones in male or female group only. Solid and dashed arrows
  indicate the single and multiple steps involved, respectively, between two metabolites.
