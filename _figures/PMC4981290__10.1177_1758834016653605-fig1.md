caption: When Hh signaling ligand is present and binds to the 12 transmembrane protein
  PTCH1, the 7 membrane spanning receptor SMO is no longer inhibited via PTCH1-mediated
  inhibition and allows transcription factor Gli1 to enter the cell nucleus, stimulating
  cell division and tumorigenesis. Both vismodegib and sonidegib bind SMO and inhibit
  the Hh pathway reactivation.Hh, Hedgehog; PTCH1, Patched-1 mutation; SMO, Smoothened
  mutation.
