caption: a. A simplified schematic of the reaction and diffusion events used in our
  CtrA activation model. Dotted red arrows indicate CckA, ChpT, and CckA binding to
  either the new pole (NP) or the old pole (OP) species. The width of the arrow represents
  the strength of binding, with thicker arrows for tighter binding. The colored edges
  out of CckA (blue), ChpT (orange), and CtrA (green) boxes indicate diffusion inside
  the pole and in the body of the cell. The length of the arrow represents the rate
  of diffusion, with shorter arrows representing slower diffusion. Phosphotransfer
  reactions are shown in black. Each arrow is labeled with a reaction number from
  1 to 39. Information on each reaction is found in . b. A complete schematic of the
  phosphotransfer reactions including binding and transfer events. Reaction numbers
  match the simplified schematic in (a). c. Concentrations of each molecular species
  in the system were modeled as a function of position along the long axis of the
  cell and time. The governing partial differential equation (PDE) for each species
  was approximated as a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The spatial
  dimension of a 4 μm cell was discretized into n = 80 bins, each representing a 0.05
  μm Δx section of the cell. Each species is broken into n sub-species, one per bin.
  The simulation advances in 0.1 second steps. We use the second-order center difference
  formula to approximate the Laplacian operator and convert each PDE into a set of
  ODEs (). d. Simulation results with wildtype parameters () showing steady state
  protein concentrations for CckA (blue), ChpT (orange), and CtrA (green) as a function
  of distance from the new pole in the predivisional cell.
