caption: Overview of molecular mechanisms triggered by the HAnano® surface in osteoblasts.
  This scheme depicts the main biological mechanisms triggered by the HAnano-modified
  surface in osteoblast responses. When in contact with the surface, osteoblast upmodulates
  the activity of a set of genes related with cell adhesion at early 3 and 24 hours
  and further compromises the expression of genes related with osteoblast differentiation.
  Importantly, calcium and phosphate ions are hypothesized to be released as described
  within current literature which triggers signaling pathway upstream activating osteoblast
  proliferation and differentiation. Altogether, these biological stages of osteoblast
  biology culminate on osteogenesis process and are expected being recapitulated during
  osseointegration of dental implants.
