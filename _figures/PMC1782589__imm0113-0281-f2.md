caption: Signalling cascades of the LPS pathway and reported sites of IL-10 intervention.
  LPS activates numerous signalling cascades that are critical for the production
  of cytokines by macrophages. The two dominant pathways of cytokine production, the
  NF-κB and the p38 MAPK pathway have both been cited as being inhibited by IL-10.
  The NF-κB pathway has been suggested to be regulated at several levels, with IL-10
  inhibiting the activation of IKK and thereby the degradation of IκB by the proteosome
  and also preventing the binding of the NF-κB subunits to its binding motif. Other
  reports have suggested IL-10 prevents translation in murine systems by inhibiting
  p38-MAPK. In addition 3′ UTR of the TNF-α gene was found to be critical to IL-10
  activity. With the exception of JNK, the other pathways activated by LPS have also
  demonstrated sensitivity to the effects of IL-10. *, Suggested site of IL-10 inhibition.
