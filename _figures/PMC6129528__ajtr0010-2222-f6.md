caption: Overview of KDM2B mediated molecular mechanisms in cancer development. KDM2B
  acts as a double-edged sword in cancer development. On one hand, KDM2B inhibits
  p15Ink4bpathway, increases oxidative phosphorylation and enhances KDM5A/MYC protein
  expression, which promotes cancer cell proliferation. Becides, KDM2B recruits PRC
  and Nsg2 to enhance cell migration and controls self-renewal of cancer stem cells.
  On the other hand, KDM2B inhibits ribosomal RNA genes, MYC protein, and promots
  c-Fos ubiquitylation, which led to a decrease of cancer cell proliferation.
