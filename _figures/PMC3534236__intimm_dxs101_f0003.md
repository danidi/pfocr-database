caption: TLRs and autophagy in innate immunity. (A) Cell wall components of Gram-positive
  bacteria and yeast are recognized by TLR2 whose activation triggers the association
  of LC3 with the phagosomal membrane and promotes phagolysosomal fusion. Phagocytosis
  of dead cells through recognition of surface PtdSr by Tim4 also utilizes LAP. LAP
  is also critical for processing and presentation of HSV antigens for MHC II by DCs.
  (B) Several TLRs are known to induce autophagy. (C) In pDCs, autophagy enables TLR7
  recognition of cytosolic virus replication products or cytosolic viral genomes,
  resulting in both type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokine production (orange
  lines). In addition, TLR9 signaling for type I interferon production requires Atg5,
  possibly through the LAP-dependent signaling pathway (dotted green lines). Cytokine
  induction downstream of TLR9 occurs independently of Atg5 (solid line).
