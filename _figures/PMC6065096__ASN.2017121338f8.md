caption: The R431C mutation induces hyperproliferation, hypermotility and ER stress-induced
  apoptosis in podocytes. (A) In healthy podocytes, ANLN modulates actin cytoskeletal
  dynamics at the slit diaphragm and facilitates prosurvival signaling through the
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway. The ANLN interaction with
  CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is essential to these functions. The R431C mutation
  disrupts the ANLN-CD2AP interaction, producing (1) dysregulated F-actin polymerization
  and bundling, (2) hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K/Rac1 signaling axis,
  and (3) activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–induced apoptosis. Specifically,
  the R431C mutation distorts the secondary structure of ANLN at the F-actin binding
  domain (), which impairs F-actin polymerization and bundling in podocytes. These
  changes alter podocyte foot process architecture at the slit diaphragm, contributing
  to the development of proteinuria. The R431C mutation also disrupts the ANLN-CD2AP
  interaction through distortion of the CD2-associated protein binding region ().
  This uncoupling further impairs F-actin cytoskeletal dynamics and alters podocyte
  prosurvival signaling through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Hyperactivation of
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K/Rac1 axis enhances Rac1-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling,
  contributing to distortion of foot process architecture. Additionally, increased
  Rac1 activity induces activation of the transcriptional regulator Signal Transducer
  and Activator of Transcription 3 (), which promotes podocyte proliferation. In a
  parallel process, the hyperactivation of mTOR induces ER stress. ER stress promotes
  the upregulation of calcineurin phosphatase (Cn) activity. Cn dephosphorylates/activates
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), which activates C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)
  expression in the context of ER stress. Activation of CHOP induces caspase 3–mediated
  apoptotic signaling. The loss-of-function effect of the R431C mutation in vivo likely
  reflects the effect of R431C-induced podocyte apoptosis. R431C-induced apoptosis
  is attenuated by inhibition of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, GSK-3β, and Cn in vitro. (B) The
  R431C mutation causes podocyte dysfunction through hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling and induces podocyte apoptosis through activation of mTOR-driven ER stress.
