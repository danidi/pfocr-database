caption: The Hippo pathway in Drosophila (a) and mammals (b). In the Drosophila, the
  upstream regulation factors exist in both surface membrane, such as Ds, Fat, and
  Crumbs, and submembrane proteins, such as Ex and Mer. The main effectors of Hippo
  pathway upstream are Hpo, Sav, Wts, and Mats, and the downstream effectors are Yki
  and Sd. In the mammals, the homologies of Drosophila in surface membrane protein
  are DCHS1-2, Ft1-4, and Crb1-3. The submembrane regulators are Nf2 and FROMD6. The
  Hippo pathway core machinery consists of Mst1/2, WW45, Lats1/2, and Mob1 and downstream
  effectors are YAP, TAZ, and TEADs. When surface membrane proteins are activated,
  they will activate subsequence effectors, which will then recruit Hippo core effectors
  to form complex, such as FRMD6-Nf2 and YAP-TAZ (Yki in Drosophila). Activated Hippo
  kinase complex will phosphorylate and then be inactivated through interaction with
  14-3-3 proteins. Nonphosphorylated YAP/TAZ transfer into the nucleus, interact with
  TEADs (Sd in Drosophila), and then drive target gene expression to promote cell
  proliferation and suppress apoptosis.
