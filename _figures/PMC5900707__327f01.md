caption: A schematic diagram of RIPK1 domains, interacting proteins, post-translational
  modifications, and the catalytic enzymes that read or write these modifications.
  RIPK1 contains an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain with a RIP homotypic
  interaction motif (RHIM), and a C-terminal DD. The phosphorylation and ubiquitination
  sites as well as types of ubiquitin linkages on RIPK1 are indicated together with
  their respective catalytic enzymes. K63 ubiquitination chains on Lys377 mediate
  the recruitment of TAB2/3 and the activation of transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1), which in turn phosphorylates IKKs for activating the NF-κB pathway.
  M1 ubiquitination of RIPK1 is regulated by the linear ubiquitination assembly complex
  (LUBAC) and the deubiqutinating complex CYLD/SPATA2. The ubiquitin-binding proteins
  ABIN-1, Optineurin (OPTN), and NEMO, each carrying a UBAN motif that can bind with
  the linear ubiquitination chains, play important roles in regulating the activation
  of RIPK1. The RHIM motif of RIPK1 is required for binding with RIPK3 to mediate
  necroptosis and may also interact with TRIF, DAI, and Toll-like receptors to promote
  inflammation. Autophosphorylation of Ser166 is a biomarker for RIPK1 activation.
  The small molecule Nec-1s is caged in a hydrophobic pocket between the N and C lobes
  of the kinase domain and forms an H bond between its nitrogen atom and the hydroxyl
  oxygen of Ser161 on the activation loop to inhibit the activation of RIPK1. The
  cleavage of RIPK1 after Asp324 by caspase-8 or the phosphorylation on Ser320/331/333/335
  in human RIPK1 and Ser321/332/334/336 in murine RIPK1 by TAK1 or MK2 leads to the
  suppression of RIPK1 activation. E3 ligase Pellino 1 (PELI1) mediates K63 ubiquitination
  on Lys115 of activated RIPK1 to promote complex IIb formation and necroptosis. The
  DD is not only crucial for the initiation of TNFR1 signaling but also indispensable
  for RIPK1 activation by mediating RIPK1 dimerization during the transition from
  complex I to complex II.
