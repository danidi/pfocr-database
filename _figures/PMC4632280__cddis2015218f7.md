caption: RAC3 regulates cellular senescence and aging. Rapamycin could induce senescence
  by inhibiting mTOR pathway (1a) that induces autophagy (1b), favors p53 transactivation
  (1c) and SIRT1 activity (1d). Hydrogen peroxide increases oxidative stress (2a),
  inducing senescence through autophagy at early stages (2b), activating p53 (2c)
  and its translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus (2d). Once there, it induces the
  expression of genes related to cell cycle arrest and senescence, like p21, in addition
  to apoptotic genes and represses SIRT1 expression (2e). p53-independent p21 expression
  could also be induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) or mTOR inhibition by unknown
  mechanisms (2f). ROS also induces FOXO3A transactivation (2g), regulating positively
  the expression of SIRT1 and others surviving genes, like manganese superoxide dismutase
  (MnSOD; 2h). RAC3 inhibits autophagy (3a) and the p21 activation, involving blockage
  of p53 nuclear translocation (3b) or p53-independent mechanisms (3c). RAC3 allows
  the FOXO3A nuclear enrichment through an unknown mechanism (3d); increases AKT expression,
  activity (3e) and nuclear translocation (3f). Phosphorylation of FOXO1A at the serine
  256 by Akt promotes its inactivation and nuclear export (3g), whereas deacetylation
  by SIRT1 increases its activity (3h). Finally, RAC3 could increase hTERT activity
  (3i) by an unknown mechanism, avoiding telomere shortening (3j) and p53 activation
  (3k)
