caption: 'Legend: nodes – genes, edges – interactions with significant z-scores. Edge
  legend: Grey edges: Non significant interactions, part of KEGG network data. Red
  solid edges: interactions positive and significant in HA samples, negative in LA
  samples. Red dashed edges: interactions positive and significant in HA samples,
  positive in LA samples. Orange solid edges: interactions positive in HA samples,
  negative and significant in LA samples. Orange dashed edges: interactions negative
  in HA samples, negative and significant in LA samples. Dark green solid edges: interactions
  positive and significant in LA samples, negative in HA samples. Dark green dashed
  edges: interactions positive and significant in LA samples, positive in HA samples.
  Light green solid edges: interactions positive in LA samples, negative and significant
  in HA samples. Light green dashed edges: interactions negative in LA samples, negative
  and significant in HA samples.'
