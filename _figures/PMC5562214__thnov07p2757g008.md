caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanism of sunitinib-induced cardiac side
  effects: (A) Sunitinib upregulates glycolysis and downregulates oxidative metabolism
  in cardiac mitochondria. (B) Sunitinib induces resistance to insulin stimulation
  of cardiac glucose uptake. The metabolic switch is an immediate early response to
  sunitinib while insulin resistance either appears later or is masked by the metabolic
  switch during the early stages of sunitinib treatment. Both mechanisms depend on
  signaling by the endothelin pathway, and lead to myocardial fibrosis and impaired
  cardiac function, and are reversed by the endothelin receptors antagonist macitentan.
  Red indicates upregulated proteins and pathways, blue indicates downregulated protein
  and pathways. ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; ET-1: endothelin 1; ETA: endothelin receptor
  type A; FA: fatty acid; GLUT: glucose transporter protein; O2: oxygen; OXPHOS: oxidative
  phosphorylation; TCA: tricarboxylic acid.'
