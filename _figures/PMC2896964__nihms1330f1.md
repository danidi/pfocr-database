caption: Schematic representation of the possible interactions between HIV-1 and the
  host miRNA-guided RNA silencing pathway. miRNA genes are transcribed into primary
  miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) (A), which are trimmed into miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) by
  the microprocessor complex (B). Pre-miRNAs are then exported via Exportin-5 to the
  cytoplasm (C), where they are cleaved by the pre-miRNA processing complex to generate
  miRNA:miRNA* duplexes (D). Following a strand selection and separation step (E),
  the mature miRNA is incorporated into effector miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein
  (miRNP) complexes to mediate recognition (F) and translational repression (G) of
  specific mRNA targets. Secondary structures in HIV-1 mRNAs may themselves be recognized
  and processed by Dicer into viral miRNAs or siRNAs (H). TAR is the target for the
  viral transactivating protein Tat (I), which has been suggested to inhibit Dicer
  activity (D). Conversely, cellular transactivating response RNA-binding protein
  (TRBP), which cooperates synergistically with Tat function (I), was recently reported
  to assist Dicer function in RNA silencing (D). Finally, siRNAs targeting HIV-1 and
  introduced in an infected cell can be accommodated by the endogenous machinery to
  form a mature RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that will cleave HIV-1 mRNAs
  (J).
