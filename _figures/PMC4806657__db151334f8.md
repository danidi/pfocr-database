caption: 'Sorcin lies on a pathway linking β-cell lipotoxicity to ER calcium and ER
  stress, representing a mechanism for dysregulation of β-cell function under conditions
  of metabolic stress. A: In pancreatic β-cells, sorcin is downregulated under conditions
  of lipotoxic stress such as exposure to HFD and palmitate or proinflammatory cytokines,
  as shown by others (). The inverse relationship between sorcin and G6PC2 expression
  levels observed in islets suggests that an important mechanism of action of sorcin
  is to regulate G6PC2 expression to influence both ER stress and GSIS. B: Sorcin
  overexpression is sufficient to protect against β-cell dysfunction during HFD. In
  stressed β-cells, sorcin overexpression increases ER and cytosolic [Ca2+], decreasing
  G6PC2, through the NFAT signaling pathway, which would stimulate GSIS. By maintaining
  a high concentration of Ca2+ in the ER lumen, sorcin prevents ER stress and maintains
  long-term capacities for GSIS during HFD. FFA, free fatty acid.'
