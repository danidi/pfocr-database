caption: Putative pathway of starch synthesis (a) and degradation (b) in Oryza sativa
  stems at early ripening stage. Italicized indicate genes analyzed in this work (see
  ). For genes, BE1, GWD1, AMY2A, and BAM2 shown in red, there were significant varietal
  difference among two HYVs. Water entry into amyloplast (shown in blue) caused by
  an increase in turgor pressure may be required for the initiation of starch phosphorylation
  by the activation of GWD, but not for PWD, followed by the elevated amylase activity
  to degrade starch. In b, putative water-transporting proteins (AQP) localized on
  the amyloplasts envelope membrane is also indicated.
