caption: Phosphortlated Smad3 is stabilized by ERG in ERG-positive prostate cancer
  cells. Smad3 is phosphorylated by TGF-β binding to receptor. Phosphorylated Smad3
  forms a complex with phosphorylated Smad2 and the common Smad (Smad4) and translocates
  to the nucleus. Phosphorylated Smad3 is stabilized by binding to ERG in the nucleus.
