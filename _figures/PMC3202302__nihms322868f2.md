caption: Activation of the IKK complex in the canonical pathway leads to the phosphorylation
  and ubiqutination of IκB, which is subsequently cleaved in the proteasome. The freed
  NFκB dimers are now able to enter the nucleus. NIK mediated IKK1 phosphorylation
  leads to the activation of the non-canonical pathway which is characterized by the
  cleavage of p100 and release of the NFκB heterodimer p52/RelB.
