caption: The sphingolipid metabolic network. The core biochemical network of the sphingolipid
  metabolism and the relation to the phosphatidate (LPA) and redox (Radical) networks.
  The canonical de novo pathway is initiated by a condensation of serine and palmitate
  by serine palmitoyltransferase (1). The product 3-keto-sphinganine is further processed
  to sphinganine by 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (2), which can either by phosphorylated
  by sphingosine kinase (12) or converted to dihydroceramide by dihydroceramide synthase
  (3) and finally emerging as ceramide by the action of dihydroceramide desaturase
  (4). The faith of ceramide is then determined by the balance and interaction of
  several enzymes including ceramidase (8), sphingosine kinase (12), sphingomyelin
  synthase (5), sphingomyelinase (9), UDP-galactosyl ceramide glycosyltransferase
  (7)-galactosidase (11),UDP-glucose ceramide glycosyltransferase (6), and-glucosidase
  (10). Ceramide may also be phosphorylated to ceramide-1 phosphate by ceramide kinase
  (14), which may be reverted by a putative ceramide phosphatase (15). Sphingosine-1
  phosphate may be dephosphorylated by sphingosine-1 phosphate phosphatase (13) or
  irreversibly degraded by sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. Many of these enzymes has
  two or several isoforms. For a review see e.g., Lahiri and Futerman (). The salvage
  pathway (Lysosome) refers to the re-generation of sphingosine by acidic sphingomyelinase,
  galactosidase, and glucosidase that generates ceramides, which is further decomposed
  to sphingosine by acidic ceramidase. Please refer to Table  for abbreviation of
  the enzymes. For further information of the phosphatidate and redox metabolism related
  to the sphingolipid metabolism (see e.g., Ghelli et al., ; Won and Singh, ).
