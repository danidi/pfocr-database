caption: Increased oxidative stress in antigen presenting cells (APCs) leads to increased
  formation of isolevuglandins. This leads to activation APC leading to production
  of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1B, IL-6 and IL-23. These APC activate T cells to
  proliferated and produce cytokines that promote hypertension and obesity.
