caption: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) regulates Sirt 1-mediated release of
  adiponectin from adipose tissue with relevance to NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome.
  Micro RNA, Sirt 1, and transcription factor interactions are possibly involved in
  vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-mediated release of ADNP from neurons with critical
  links of Sirt 1 and ADNP in neuron survival. FGF21, Sirt 1, and VIP are associated
  with the circadian brain–liver amyloid beta clearance pathway with decreased VIP
  levels in plasma associated with excess sodium intake and sodium intake linked to
  adiponectin levels. Sirt 1’s downregulation, associated with insulin resistance,
  is linked to high plasma sodium levels and low plasma VIP levels. This is related
  to its vascular effects in the central nervous system, which determine hepatic amyloid
  beta metabolism and the regulation of apo E-mediated amyloid beta clearance pathways
  in the brain.
