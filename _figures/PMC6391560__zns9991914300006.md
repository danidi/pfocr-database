caption: Model for light input to the circadian clock network of Drosophila. LI light
  is sensed by CRY in the clock neurons themselves (indicated in the left brain hemisphere)
  and can quickly reset their oscillations to light (). MI light is perceived by the
  compound eyes, transferred via histamine (His) to the optic lobes and via acetylcholinergic
  (ACh) interneurons to the large ventrolateral neurons (l-LNv; ; indicated in the
  left brain hemisphere). The l-LNv signal via the neuropeptide PDF to the morning
  (M) and evening (E) cells, respectively (short orange arrow), and to the contralateral
  hemisphere (long orange arrow). The signaling of HI is shown in the right hemisphere.
  HI light is perceived by the HB eyelets that signal via ACh to the M cells (s-LNv;
  ). The M cells might signal via PDF directly to the E cells (shown by arrows) and
  inhibit E-cell activity or to the siesta cells (DN1) in the dorsal brain (; ). The
  siesta cells then signal via glutamate (Glut) to the E cells (3 CRY-positive LNd
  and the fifth sLNv) and delay the onset of E activity ().
