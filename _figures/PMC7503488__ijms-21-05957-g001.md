caption: 'Actions of metformin on immune cells, blood platelets and endothelium during
  the development of neurodegeneration disease: Metformin has multiple properties
  such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antithrombotic properties. It may influence
  different types of cells, including immune cells (oligodendrocytes, macrophages,
  T cells and B cells), blood platelets and endothelial cells. It may also affect
  many processes involved in BBB disruption and demyelination during MS development,
  including pro-inflammatory cell differentiation, degranulation and infiltration
  of immune cells into the CNS from the blood vessels, as well as myelin repair process
  (remyelination). As a versatile compound, metformin is responsible for maintaining
  the Th17/Treg balance by blocking differentiation of CD4+ naive T cell into pro-inflammation
  RORyt+Th17 cells and stimulation to differentiate into anti-inflammation FoxP3+
  Tregs. These actions provide protection against the negative influence of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-17, IL-21, TNF-α and IFN-γ) and enhance myelin reconstruction, supporting
  the remyelination process. Metformin inhibits differentiation of monocytes into
  macrophages, diminishing the secretion of inflammatory agents (NO, PGE2, IL-1 and
  IL-6), and inhibits the autoreactive antibodies secretion from B cells. One of the
  key functions of metformin is blocking the massive infiltration of immune cells
  (mainly neutrophils and macrophages) into the CNS, which initiates neuroinflammation
  in MS. This diabetic drug improves the angiogenic functions of endothelial cells
  by activating the AMPK pathway. Metformin has been shown to stimulate fibrinolysis
  by decreasing the PAI-1 and CFVII levels in serum as well as has been proven to
  have an impact on blocking the platelet pro-thrombotic activities by diminishing
  their adhesion and aggregation. Furthermore, metformin may inhibit the activation
  of blood platelets, which reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that
  pull immune cells to the BBB disruption site. Abbreviations: AMPK—adenosine monophosphate
  kinase; BBB—blood-brain barrier; CFVII—coagulation factor VII; CNS—central nervous
  system; IFN-γ—interferon γ; IL—interleukin; MMP-9—matrix metalloproteinase 9; MS—multiple
  sclerosis; NO—nitric oxide; PAF—platelet-activating factor; PAI-1—plasminogen activator
  inhibitor 1; PF4—platelet factor 4; PGE2—prostaglandin E2; RANTES—regulated upon
  activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted; ROS—reactive oxygen
