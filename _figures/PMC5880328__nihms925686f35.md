caption: Microarray analysis and targeted mutagenesis studies in an ascending UTI
  model both point to roles for glycolysis, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  Entner-Doudoroff pathway (E–D), and both oxidative and branched/reductive TCA cycles
  during infection, while gluconeogenesis appears to be dispensable. Induction and
  requirement of gdhA suggests a low carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Gene names in red were
  induced in vivo compared to broth culture as detected by microarray analysis; gene
  names in black were not differentially regulated while names in purple were repressed.
  An “X” over a pathway indicates a targeted mutant was assessed in cochallenge, with
  a red X indicating the mutant was outcompeted and a purple X indicating no fitness
  defect. Interestingly, a different picture emerges from Tn-Seq in a CAUTI model,
  where a catheter remains in the bladder. Here, gluconeogenesis contributes to fitness
  instead of glycolysis, and ammonia uptake relies on glnA instead of gdhA. During
  coinfection with Providencia stuartii in the CAUTI model, gluconeogenesis remains
  important, and PPP, E–D, and the oxidative TCA cycle are once again contributors
  to fitness. Figure adapted from (), (), and ().
