caption: 'The K2 toxin (grey oval) initially binds to cell wall-localized β-1,6-glucan.
  K2 is recognized by the plasma membrane-localized receptor Kre1 prior to integrating
  into the cell membrane and disrupting the electrochemical ion gradient leading to
  the leakage of K+ ions. Disrupting the functional integrity of the plasma membrane
  triggers multiple stress signaling responses involving the cell wall integrity pathway
  (in pink), the HOG pathway (in green), and phosphoinositide signaling (in purple).
  Rho1 and Pkc1 efficiently relay cell wall stress from the plasma membrane into the
  nucleus, leading to the activation of specific transcriptional programs. Ion and
  pH homeostasis maintenance mechanisms are activated to prevent cell death through
  ion leakage. Plasma membrane ion channels and their regulators (in yellow), vacuolar
  H+-ATPase and other vacuolar ion homeostasis keeping proteins (in blue), mitochondrial
  F0F1 ATP-synthase and H+/K+-antiporter (in red) are all involved. Key: Gene products
  depicted in uppercase denote K toxin effectors which are specific to K2 toxin. Lowercase
  genes are also involved in K1 and/or K28 susceptibility. Gene products circled in
  red are involved in K2 resistance; those circled in green in K2 hypersensitivity.
  For the K2 effectors, the color-coding is as follows: Orange, proteins associated
  with cell wall organization/biogenesis; Purple, phosphoinositide-related; Pink,
  CWI cascade; Green, HOG pathway; Red, mitochondrial constituents; Blue, vacuolar
  constituents; Yellow, ion transporter at the PM. CW, cell wall; PM, plasma membrane;
  CWI, cell wall integrity pathway. The cell wall consists of an inner layer, which
  is composed of β-1,3-glucan (in brown) and chitin (yellow waves), and an outer layer,
  densely packed with mannoproteins (in orange), extensively modified by N- and O-glycosylation
  (not represented). Components of the inner and outer cell wall layers are connected
  by β-1,6-glucan (in green).'
