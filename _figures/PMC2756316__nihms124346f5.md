caption: The proposed model for the interaction between PyVmT and IR or IGF-IR. In
  the quiescent cell, PyVmT and IR or IGF-IR form a preexisting complex. Insulin and
  IGF-I activate their receptors, increase their association with PyVmT and stimulate
  its tyrosine phosphorylation. This enhances the recruitment of Src or PLCγ1, which
  are key oncogenic molecules in PyVmT-induced malignant transformation. In addition,
  Src is important for insulin-and IGF-I-mediated signalling through the MAPK pathway.
  These data imply that PyVmT physically and functionally interacts with IR and IGF-IR.
  PyVmT requires IR and IGF-IR for its full activation and for the recruitment of
  Src and PLCγ1 to promote tumourigenesis, whereas PyVmT-activated Src is necessary
  for insulin- and IGF-I-mediated signal transduction through the MAPK pathway.

  description: The proposed model for the interaction between PyVmT and IR or IGF-IR.
    In the quiescent cell, PyVmT and IR or IGF-IR form a preexisting complex. Insulin
