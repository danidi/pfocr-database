caption: 'Organelle homeostasis imbalance signaling pathways. ER stress signaling
  (with the unfolded protein response (UPR) sensors IRE1, PERK and ATF6; left) and
  Golgi stress response (right). Left panel: unfolded protein accumulation is sense
  by three ER resident receptors: IRE1, PERK and ATF6. IRE1 activation imposes the
  induction of two different activities: kinasic and RNAsic activity. The first controls
  phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic factor JNK, the latter mediates IRE1 dependent
  mRNA decay (RIDD) and the unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA. PERK activation
  induces eiF2a phosphorylation, thus inducing global mRNA translation inhibition
  and translation of specific mRNA, such as ATF4 mRNA. ATF6 activation induces its
  translocation into the Golgi, where it is the substrate of two proteases. This cleavage
  promotes the release of an active transcription factor known as ATF6f. All together
  these factors mediate the transcriptional program unfolded protein response. Right
  panel: unfolded protein accumulation also induces a Golgi-dependent response. The
  main receptors are still needed to be defined (X, Y and Z), but currently two main
  effectors were identified: TF3/MLX and CREB3. The first regulates genes necessary
  to increase Golgi function, the latter transcribe for ARF4, thus inducing apoptosis.'
