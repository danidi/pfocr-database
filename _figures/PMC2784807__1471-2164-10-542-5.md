caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® network depicting relationships among genes involved
  in immune and metabolic responses due to IMI with Streptococcus uberis. Red denotes
  up-regulation and green down-regulation of the gene. Arrows highlighted in blue
  and orange represent the known positive and negative relationships with TNF, respectively.
