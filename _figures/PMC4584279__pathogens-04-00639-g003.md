caption: Schematic representation of selected signal networks induced by Dectin-1
  and Dectin-2. Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 induce intracellular signaling via tyrosine
  (Y)-based activation motifs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs or
  ITAMs) which recruit and activate Syk-kinase either directly, or indirectly through
  the FcγR adaptor chain. Signaling through protein-kinase C (PKC) δ activates the
  Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 complex and induces gene transcription and the production of various
  inflammatory mediators. Dectin-1 can signal via the Raf-1 kinase pathway which modulates
  other signaling pathways, including those induced by the Toll-like receptors (TLR)
  and the Dectin-1/Syk pathway. Dectins can also collaborate with TLRs, to synergistically
  induce or repress various cytokines and chemokines and to mediate fungal phagocytosis
  (not shown). Dectins-mediated recognition of C. albicans yeasts or hyphae drives
  their uptake and killing by phagocytes, and directs the development of protective
  Th1/Th17 responses. Induction of IL-12 drives IFN-γ production by Th1 cells, which
  is critically required for the activation of phagocytes. Signals inducing IL-10
  production lead to Treg differentiation. On the other hand, induction of IL-1β,
  IL-6, and IL-23 promotes Th17 differentiation, which drives the production of IL-17
  and IL-22.
