caption: IL-22 production is induced by cancer cell mediated activation of IL-1 signaling
  pathway. Cancer cells induce NLRP3 inflammasome with the subsequent release of IL-1β
  from both myeloid and T cells. IL-1 receptor signaling via the transcription factors
  AhR and RORγt induces IL-22 production by mixed T helper cell population comprised
  of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells.
