caption: L-arginine (substrate) is oxidized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to form
  citrulline and NO. Alternatively, L-arginine can be catabolized by arginase to form
  ornithine or shunted to the methylation pathway to form N-monomethylarginine (MMA),
  symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Both MMA
  and ADMA inhibit NOS. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity occurs through formation
  of superoxide radical, a potent cause of oxidative stress, which then interacts
  with a variety of molecules, including NO, to produce toxic peroxynitrites that
  lead to further nitrosative stress. Reductions in NO can also lead to anthracycline-induced
  cardiotoxicity by disrupting the beneficial physiologic effects that NO exerts on
  normal well-functioning endothelium. Doxorubicin also results in calcium overload
  and myofibrillar disarray, topoisomerase-IIβ inhibition which may further exacerbate
  oxidative stress via alterations in the transcriptome; and iron-mediated generation
  of oxidative stress.
