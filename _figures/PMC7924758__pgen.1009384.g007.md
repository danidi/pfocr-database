caption: The different responses of specific seedling tissues to changing light conditions
  and auxin reflect different patterns of IAA and PIF activity in these tissues. In
  young leaves, low light is perceived by photoreceptors and then triggers the accumulation
  of PIFs, leading to increased YUCCA expression and auxin abundance. The auxin in
  the leaves is transported to the hypocotyl, in which IAA3 is degraded through the
  TIR1-mediated proteasome pathway, releasing the inhibition of several transcription
  factors including PIFs, ARFs, and BZR1. The target genes of these transcription
  factors are activated to promote hypocotyl elongation. When the light conditions
  are sufficiently high, PIF accumulation in the leaves is reduced, leading to decreased
  YUCCA expression, and then reduced auxin levels in the leaves. Thus, the auxin in
  the hypocotyl which is transported from leaves is also reduced. Consequently, IAA3
  represses PIFs, ARFs, and BZR1 in the hypocotyl. The blue arrows in the diagram
  represent auxin flow and the thickness of the arrows represent auxin level.

    The auxin in the leaves is transported to the hypocotyl, in which IAA3 is degraded
