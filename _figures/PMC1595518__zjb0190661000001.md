caption: Thiamine pyrophosphate biosynthetic pathway in S. enterica. (A) Simplification
  of the biosynthetic pathway for thiamine production. Emphasis is placed on the two
  reactions relevant to this work. The reactions are catalyzed by the gene product
  indicated. The PurD reaction has been used in the coupled assay to monitor PRA formation
  in vitro (). (B) Reaction catalyzed by the TrpDE enzyme complex that results in
  an intermediate in the biosynthesis of tryptophan.
