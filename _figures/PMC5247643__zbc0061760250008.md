caption: Model, perturbation of acetyl-CoA synthesis in crd1Δ cells. In the proposed
  model, loss of CL leads to decreased acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme activity, resulting
  in accumulation of acetate and decreased synthesis of acetyl-CoA by the PDH bypass.
  To compensate for defects in the PDH bypass, PDH gene expression and protein synthesis
  are increased in CL-deficient cells. However, PDH activity is not increased, possibly
  because mitochondrial import, enzymatic activity, or assembly of PDH inside the
  mitochondria requires CL. Thus, a defective PDH bypass pathway results in decreased
  synthesis of acetyl-CoA, which is not compensated by PDH.
