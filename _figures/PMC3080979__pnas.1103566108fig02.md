caption: Partial hepatectomy stimulates anandamide production through a pathway involving
  conjugation of arachidonic acid and ethanolamine by FAAH. The generated anandamide,
  which may cross the cellular membrane either by passive diffusion (dotted arrow)
  or through a specific transporter [putative anandamide transporter (AT), solid arrow],
  promotes hepatocytes regeneration through activation of both CB1 (as shown by Mukhopadhyay
  et al.) () and CB2 (as shown by Teixeira-Clerc et al.) (). After CB1 receptor activation,
  anandamide induces the forkhead-box M1 (FoxM1) transcriptor factor, which is involved
  in mitotic progression. The CB1-mediated induction of FoxM1 involves the Akt/PTEN
  (protein kinase B/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) signaling
  pathway. The intracellular mechanisms associated with CB2-stimulated cell proliferation
  have been not studied to date. Note that anandamide could stimulate liver regeneration
  as a paracrine (as shown in this figure) and/or an autocrine lipid mediator. GP-AEA,
  glycerophospho-anandamide; NArPE, N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine.
