caption: The C. elegans engulfment genes and their molecular functions. (a) Two parallel
  and partially redundant pathways that control the engulfment of apoptotic cells
  in C. elegans. Members of each pathway were identified from genetic screens for
  mutations that impair cell-corpse removal. Each gene was placed in one of the two
  pathways based on the results of epistasis grouping assays and phenotype characterizations.
  The order of genes in each pathway was determined by epistasis analyses (for details,
  see text and Ref. []). The identities of the corresponding mammalian homologs are
  indicated inside parentheses. (b) The molecular functions and protein–protein interactions
  of the eight genes listed in (a). Yellow spheres coating the cell corpse represent
  the ‘eat me’ signal presented by cell corpses to attract engulfing cells. Among
  the eight proteins, CED-7 is the only one that functions in both dying and engulfing
  cells. All other proteins function specifically in engulfing cells for cell-corpse
  engulfment. CED-2, CED-5 and CED-12 form a protein complex under the plasma membrane
  to regulate the CED-10 Rac GTPase, which promotes cytoskeletal reorganization and
  pseudopod extension during engulfment. CED-5 and CED-12 function as a bipartite
  guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor that activates CED-10. CED-10 associates with
  the plasma membrane through its prenylated C terminus. Two deep blue lines, which
  represent a transmembrane receptor that interacts with an ‘eat me’ signal molecule
  and a nearby question mark indicate that the transmembrane receptor(s) expected
  to interact with the SH2 domain of CED-2 with its intracellular domain and activate
  the CED-2, -5 and –12 complex has not been identified. In the other pathway, CED-7
  mediates the presentation of an ‘eat me’ signal on the surface of apoptotic cells,
  and might possess a different engulfment-promoting activity on the surface of engulfing
  cells. CED-1 is a phagocytic receptor that uses its extracellular domain to recognize
  the ‘eat me’ signal, clusters around the cell corpse, and uses its intracellular
  domain for downstream signaling. CED-6 interacts with CED-1 and functions as the
  adaptor of CED-1. DYN-1 is localized to the surface of pseudopods and phagosomes
  in a manner dependent on the functions of CED-1, -6 and -7. DYN-1 mediates the signaling
  of CED-1 to promote the delivery and incorporation of intracellular vesicles to
  pseudopods through ‘focal phagocytosis’, a mechanism that provides membrane material
  to support pseudopod extension. DYN-1 also mediates CED-1 signaling to promote phagosome
  maturation. An additional activity of CED-1 and CED-6 in actin reorganization, possibly
  mediated by CED-10, has also been suggested. For review, see main text and Refs
  [,,,,,]. Figure adapted, with permission, from Ref. [].
