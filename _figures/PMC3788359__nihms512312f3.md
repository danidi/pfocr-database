caption: Potential pathways linking hypoxia to CSCs and EMT in tumor aggressiveness.
  Hypoxic stress increases the stability and expression of the HIFs, especially HIF-1
  and 2 in the cells under tumor microenvironment. The activation of HIF signaling
  pathways up-regulate (1) tumor angiogenesis via the regulation of VEGF, VEGFR1,
  and Ang-2; (2) the maintenance of CSC phenotype and function via the regulation
  of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2; (3) the induction of EMT characteristics via regulation
  of ZEB2, Snail, Twist, Slug, TGF-β, Wnt, and Notch; and (4) the metabolic adaptation
  of hypoxic stress via regulation of Glut 1,2, CAIX, LDH-5, IGF-2, and BNIP3. These
  regulations result in tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, treatment resistance,
  and recurrence. Complex interlinking of HIF pathway to NF-κB, Akt/mTOR, Notch, Wnt/β-catenin,
  and Hedgehog signaling pathways increases the contribution of HIF signaling pathway
  to tumor aggressiveness by the regulation of angiogenesis, CSCs, EMT, and metabolic
  shifts. Hypoxia also induces the altered expression of miRNAs, for examples, the
  up-regulation of miR-21, miR-210, and miR-373; and the down-regulation of let-7,
  miR-20, miR-22, and miR-101 in the tumor cells. The deregulation of the hypoxia-associated
  miRNAs may enhance tumor angiogenesis, CSC and EMT characteristics through the modulation
  of multiple signaling pathways. Natural agents such as isoflavones, curcumin, DIM,
  lycopene, resveratrol, and EGCG have been demonstrated to modulation of these signaling
  pathways, potentially by the differential regulation of hypoxia-mediated miRNAs,
  leading to the inhibition/attenuation of tumor aggressiveness.
