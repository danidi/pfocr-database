caption: 'The biallelic loss of FH leads to the truncation of the TCA cycle and the
  subsequent accumulation of fumarate (highlighted in orange). The combined disruption
  of the TCA cycle and the inhibition of Succinate Dehydrogenase (also known as Complex
  II of the respiratory chain) by fumarate significantly reduce mitochondrial respiration.
  To compensate for the loss of mitochondrial function, FH-deficient cells engage
  in a complex biochemical rewiring. First, FH-deficient cells shift towards aerobic
  glycolysis reducing the oxidation of glucose in the mitochondria (lilac arrows).
  Part of carbons from glucose are diverted toward the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  to maintain redox homeostasis (lilac arrow). Furthermore, to maintain the remaining
  TCA cycle activity and sufficient NADH generation, FH-deficient cells increase glutamine
  oxidation (red arrows). Glutamine-derived carbons are further metabolized to fumarate
  and, via the haem pathway, to biliverdin and bilirubin, which is secreted in the
  medium, or are used to generate lipogenic acetyl-CoA via reductive carboxylation
  (yellow arrows). FH-deficient cells also activate multiple strategies to buffer
  the potentially toxic accumulation of fumarate. For instance, fumarate permeates
  the various intracellular compartments, including the nucleus, and can be released
  in the extracellular milieu. Fumarate accumulation leads to the aberrant production
  of argininosuccinate via the reversal of the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate
  lyase (ASL) (turquoise arrows). Of note, FH-deficient cells require constant supply
  of exogenous arginine to maintain this buffering system active and die when arginine
  is depleted. Finally, fumarate leads to the accumulation of adenylosuccinate, likely
  via the reversal of adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) within the purine nucleotide cycle
  (PNC). AMP= adenosine monophosphate; CI-V=Electron transport chain Complex I-V;
  PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; GLUT1=glucose transporter 1; HMOX1=haem oxygenase 1;
  IMP= inosine monophosphate.'
