caption: Simplified steps of Okazaki fragment maturation during DNA lagging strand
  synthesis (for further details see refs. –). In rad27Δ cells, unprocessed replication
  intermediates could be resolved either by using an alternative process involving
  Dna2, Exo1, RNase H(35), and Polδ activities or by the Rad52 recombinational repair
  pathway.
