caption: Diagram of the pathways involved in the metabolic interaction of glycolysis,
  mitochondrial respiration, and hyaluronan synthesis. Glucose is taken up by the
  glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT1) and further metabolized in the glycolysis. For
  energy production, pyruvate is shuttled to the mitochondria via the mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier (MPC) where it is converted to acetyl‐CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (PDC), whose activity is regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK).
  Acetyl‐CoA is then further consumed in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to fuel
  ATP synthesis. In most cancer cells, this pathway is aberrant due to an up‐regulation
  of PDK leading to an inhibition of PDC activity. This switch is characteristic for
  hypoxic conditions but is regularly found also in the presence of oxygen in tumour
  cells (Warburg effect). Under these circumstances, pyruvate is reduced to lactate,
  which is exported by monocarboxylate transporters (e.g., MCT1). Restoration of mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by the PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) yields
  an increased amount of acetyl‐CoA in the mitochondria, which is also shuttled to
  the cytosol under involvement of the citrate carrier (CiC) and the ATP‐citrate lyase
  (CL). A reactivation of mitochondrial metabolism in tumour cells has been connected
  to the induction of caspase‐dependent apoptosis. Our study reveals that this process
  also yields an increase in the hyaluronan (HA) synthesis precursors glucose 6‐phosphate
  and N‐acetyl‐glucosamine. The latter also triggers the O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT)
  mediating GlcNAcylation of proteins (e.g., hyaluronan synthase [HAS]). These processes
  result in a pronounced increase of the extracellular matrix compound HA that inhibits
  apoptosis via its receptors CD44 and RHAMM. HA synthesis can be blocked by 4‐methylumbelliferone
  (4‐MU), thus providing a countermeasure for this antiapoptotic counter‐regulation.
