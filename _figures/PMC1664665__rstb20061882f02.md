caption: Regulation of the axon cytoskeleton by PI3K signalling. Small GTPases, including
  Rac, Cdc42 and Rho, are major downstream mediators of PI3K signalling that regulate
  the cytoskeleton. Both Rac and Cdc42 are activated by neurotrophin signalling downstream
  of PI3K. Activated Rac can activate WAVE proteins and subsequently the Arp2/3 complex
  to promote actin polymerization that mediates lamellipodia formation. Rac can also
  activate PAK and LIM kinase (LIMK), which phosphorylates and inactivates the actin
  depolymerization factor cofilin. Cofilin is activated by dephosphorylation via the
  phosphatase Slingshot directly downstream of PI3K. Appropriate regulation of cofilin
  activity is important for actin polymerization. Cdc42 is mainly involved in regulation
  of actin filopodial formation, probably via the actin binding protein mDia. In addition
  to regulation of actin filaments, both Rac and Cdc42 regulate microtubule assembly
  and dynamics. Activated Rac at the lamellipodial leading edge can capture and stabilize
  dynamic microtubules via the interaction of its effector IQGAP1 with the microtubule
  plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs) Clip-170 and CLASP. Cdc42 may regulate microtubule
  dynamics via a conserved cell polarity pathway, Par3/6-aPKC, which in turn inactivates
  GSK-3 and promotes microtubule assembly via another +TIP, APC. There is also cross
  talk between Rac and Cdc42 mediated microtubule regulatory pathways. IQGAP1 can
  interact with APC downstream of Rac, whereas GSK-3 inactivation downstream of Cdc42
  also regulates the CLASP–microtubule interaction. Another kinase, Akt, may also
  regulate GSK-3 activity downstream of PI3K. Although Rho is not directly regulated
  by PI3K, both Rac and Cdc42 can regulate Rho activity, and vise versa. Rho can regulate
  actin dynamics via actin-based motor protein myosin II. Activation of Rho kinase
  (ROCK) downstream of Rho leads to phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) that
  is important for myosin II activation. Rho has also been shown to inactivate GSK-3
  via mDia. Green arrows indicate activation, and red arrows indicate inhibition.
