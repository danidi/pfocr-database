caption: Porphyromonas gingivalis interacts with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 (specifically
  with the CD14–TLR2–TLR1 complex) and TLR4. The latter receptor is blocked by the
  bacterium’s atypical lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 antagonist) and thus cannot induce
  protective responses. The TLR2 response is proactively modified through crosstalk
  with other receptors that are regulated by P. gingivalis. P. gingivalis controls
  C5a receptor (C5aR) by virtue of Arg-specific cysteine proteinases, which attack
  C5 and release biologically active C5a. C5a stimulates intracellular Ca2+signalling
  which synergistically enhances the otherwise weak cAMP responses induced by TLR2
  activation alone. Maximal cAMP induction requires the participation of CXC-chemokine
  receptor 4 (CXCR4), which is activated directly by the pathogen’s fimbriae and coassociates
  with both TLR2 and C5aR in lipid rafts. The ensuing activation of the cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase A (PKA) inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and impairs
  the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-dependent killing of the pathogen in
  macrophages. An additional pathway induced downstream of TLR2 is an inside-out signalling
  pathway, mediated by RAC1, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and cytohesin 1
  (CYT1), which transactivates complement receptor-3 (CR3). Activated CR3 binds P.
  gingivalis and induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1)/ERK2 signalling,
  which in turn selectively downregulates IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression through
  suppression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). This inhibitory ERK1/ERK2
  pathway is also activated downstream of the C5aR. Inhibition of bioactive IL-12,
  and secondarily IFNγ, leads to impaired immune clearance of P. gingivalis.
