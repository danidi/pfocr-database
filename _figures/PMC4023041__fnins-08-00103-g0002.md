caption: Astrocyte calcium-dependent vasoactive signaling pathways. Neuronally released
  glutamate can act on astrocyte mGluRs, activating PLC, and increasing astrocyte
  [Ca2+]i, activating PLA2 resulting in the release of AA from the plasma membrane.
  AA can be metabolized within the astrocyte to form PgE2 or EETs which are released
  and act on smooth muscle cells, evoking vasodilation. Alternatively, AA can be released
  and act on smooth muscle cells where it is metabolized to the vasoconstrictor 20-HETE.
  ATP can activate Ca2+-mediated downstream vasoactive pathways either by acting on
  P2Y receptors and activating PLC or via P2X7 receptors, increasing [Ca2+]i. An alternative
  vasoactive pathway downstream of the [Ca2+]i increase is the activation of BKCa
  channels and subsequent efflux of the vasodilator K+.
