caption: Signaling pathway of IFIT family genes. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-like
  receptors (RLRs) are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) families that recognize
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that trigger signaling. TLR3 and
  RIG-I sense dsRNA, while TLR4 senses LPS, TLR7/8 senses ssRNA and TLR9 senses CpG
  DNA. Adapter proteins MYD88, TRIF and ISP-1 are used by the receptor complex that
  activate IRF3 and IRF7 by phosphorylaton, which then bind the DNA to stimulate IFN
  expression. Secreted IFN binds the receptor IFNAR at the cell surface, followed
  by activation of STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 form
  the ISGF3 complex, which is translocated into the nucleus, binds with the ISRE elements
  in the promoter of IFIT family genes, and thus stimulates IFIT family genes expression.
