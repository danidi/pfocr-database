caption: Schematic of mechanisms on EET-mediated signaling in response to cardiac
  hypertrophy and fibrosis. EETs inhibit cardiac hypertrophy by acting directly on
  cardiomyocytes through the PPAR-γ/oxidative stress/SERCA2a/ER stress pathway and
  interaction of Akt1 and AMPKα2β2γ1 (, , ). Moreover, EETs attenuate pro-fibrotic
  and pro-inflammatory responses of cardiomyocytes transmitted to cardiac fibroblasts
  and macrophages, respectively (, ). This study indicates that EETs inhibit cardiac
  fibrosis by inhibiting fibrotic response of cardiac fibroblasts, including inhibition
  of cardiac fibroblast activation, proliferation, migration, and collagen secretion.
  Mechanistically, EETs stimulate the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, which reduces Gα12/13
  and subsequently inhibits RhoA/ROCK activation (Dashed lines represent previous
  findings and solid lines represent present findings).
