caption: Schematic diagram illustrating some of the major abnormalities related to
  sensitized D1R-signaling and associated to LID. In PD, the loss of striatal dopamine
  leads to sensitization of D1Rs on the striatonigral MSNs of the direct pathway.
  Emerging evidence indicates that, if persistent, this phenomenon results in the
  appearance of dyskinesia. D1R sensitization may be caused by augmented D1R expression
  at the cell surface. Chronic administration of l-DOPA promotes the release of BDNF
  from corticostriatal neurons, leading to activation of TrκB receptors and increased
  expression of D3Rs, specifically in striatonigral MSNs. Direct interaction with
  D3Rs is likely to increase the levels of membrane-bound D1Rs, thereby exacerbating
  D1R sensitization and dyskinetic behavior. In line with this possibility, D3R antagonists
  have been found to counteract LID in experimental models of PD. Sensitized D1R transmission
  may also be caused by increased levels of adenylyl cyclase 5 (AC 5) in striatonigral
  MSNs. Increased responsiveness of the D1R/Gαolf/AC5 machinery to l-DOPA results
  in augmented synthesis of cAMP and hyper-activation of PKA and DARPP-32. Pharmacological
  inhibition of PKA, or genetic inactivation of DARPP-32 have been shown to reduce
  LID. Abnormal PKA/DARPP-32 signaling increases the phosphorylation of GluR1. This
  effect promotes the excitability of MSNs and may participate in the loss of corticostriatal
  LTD and depotentiation associated to LID. Sensitized D1R-mediated transmission leads
  also to activation of ERK, which controls transcriptional and translational processes.
  Both pharmacological and genetic suppression of ERK signaling counteracts the development
  and expression of LID. In the nucleus, PKA/DARPP-32 and ERK/MSK1 signaling leads
  to phosphorylation of CREB and histone H3, and increased expression of immediate
  early genes and prodynorphin. Reduced expression/activity of ΔfosB efficiently counteracts
  LID. Activation of ERK promotes mTORC1-dependent signaling, thereby accelerating
  mRNA translation. Blockade of mTORC1 with rapamycin has been found to attenuate
  the development of LID. Red color indicates receptors or signaling components whose
  targeting reduces LID. See text for abbreviations.
