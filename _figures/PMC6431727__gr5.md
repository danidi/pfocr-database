caption: RANKL-RANK signaling pathway via Btk in osteoclast differentiationTec family
  kinases are activated by RANK and bind to scaffolding proteins (BLNK or SLP76) activated
  by ITAM signaling, thereby forming a complex that cooperates to activate PLCγ2.
  PLCγ2 in turn stimulates calcium signaling, which is required for activation of
  NFATc1, a transcription factor essential for osteoclast differentiation. Our data
  suggest that ITAM signaling may be bypassed by RANK-RANKL signaling via Btk/Tec.
