caption: Signaling pathways for selected transcripts that regulate dendritic spine
  density. Lines with arrowheads indicate activation and those with blunted ends indicate
  inhibition. Open arrows indicate the direction of altered expression of each transcript
  in layer 3 pyramidal cells in schizophrenia (; ; ). The protein products of these
  transcripts contribute to spine stability through regulation of the assembly and
  stability of actin filaments (). Rho GTPases are dendritically translated, are active
  in the spine, and have well elucidated roles in the morphogenesis and maintenance
  of dendritic spines, including molecular signaling cascades such as the cell division
  cycle 42 (CDC42) pathway (). In this pathway, CDC42 is negatively regulated by a
  Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha (ARHGDIA) () and acts through the CDC42-p21-activated
  serine/threonine kinase (PAK)-LIM domain kinase (LIMK) pathway to promote spine
  stability by phosphorylating and deactivating the neuronal cofilin, cofilin-1, an
  actin severing protein (). In a separate pathway, negative regulation by CDC42 on
  CDC42 effector proteins 3 and 4 (CDC42EP3 and CDC42EP4) promotes spine outgrowth
  by opening the barrier at the base of dendritic spine necks formed by septin molecules
  such as Septin-7 (SEPT7) and allowing influx of molecules important in spine growth
  into the spine head (). RhoA is another GTPase which has a negative influence on
  dendritic spine maintenance, contributing to spine loss (). In addition to the role
  that GTPases play in dendritic spine maintenance, other molecules contribute to
  the stability of spines. For example, neuronal cadherin (N-cadherin) has been shown
  to contribute significantly to nascent synapse stabilization and subsequent spine
  formation ().
