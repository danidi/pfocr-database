caption: 'Overall workflow and summary of results in each step. The pyrimidine metabolism
  (KEGG PATHWAY: hsa00240, 100 genes) has been chosen as a starting point and then
  using comprehensive PPI to extend the pathway to add more proteins that could be
  potentially related to the pathway in which 69 new proteins can be added. We also
  added 9 membrane transporters that have been known to be associated with the gemcitabine
  pharmacologic pathway. 5046 nsSNPs are found to be linked to the 178 genes (100
  together with the new 69 and the 9 transporters’ genes). 77 of them are found to
  be common in Singaporean population. After that, five criteria have been used to
  prioritize the common SNPs. We did detailed SNP analysis for 15 common nsSNPs that
  passed at least 3 out of 5 criteria and some borderline SNPs. Finally, after thorough
  literature review, we selected six SNPs to be genotyped in the NSCLC Singaporean
  patient cohort. PPI: Protein-protein interaction, SGVP: Singaporean Genome Variation
