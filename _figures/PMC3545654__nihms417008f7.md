caption: 'Mechanisms that induced optimal production of IFN-γ by NK cells: requirement
  of concomitant engagement of TLR3 and RLRs on mDCs and RLRs on NK cells by dsRNA.
  Poly(I:C) that triggered both TLR3 and RLR pathway led to high level of IL-12 and
  type I IFN production by mDCs, whereas poly(A:U) that activated only TLR3 induced
  a high amount of type I IFN but low IL-12. In parallel, poly(I:C)—but not poly(A:U)—was
  able to directly activate NK cells via RLRs and allowed them to produce high level
  of IFN-γ in combination with IL-12. Cytotoxic potential of NK cells mostly dependent
  of the type I IFN produced by dsRNA-activated mDCs and not of a direct triggering
  by dsRNA was comparable with both poly(I:C) and poly(A:U).'
