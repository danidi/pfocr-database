caption: UV-induced H1 ubiquitylation is mediated by HUWE1 and stimulates the RNF8-RNF168
  pathway. Model of HUWE1 functioning in the DNA damage-induced ubiquitin pathway.
  HUWE1 ubiquitylates histone H1, with a mono-ubiquitin or short poly-ubiquitin chain,
  in response to DNA damage, thereby providing additional substrates for RNF8-mediated
  K63-linked poly-ubiquitylation. These K63-chains are recognized and bound by RNF168
  which ubiquitylates histone H2A at lysine K13/15, stimulating the recruitment of
  downstream factors like 53BP1. P = phosphorylation of H2AX, Ub = ubiquitylation.
