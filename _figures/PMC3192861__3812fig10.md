caption: A schematic model of GC-mediated acute activation of NHE3 via SGK3. Previous
  studies showed that GCs bind to GR, and activated GR interacts with the p85 regulatory
  subunit of PI3K and recruits the p110 catalytic subunit in the cytoplasm (; ; ).
  PI3K activates PDK1 by phosphorylating PDK1, which acutely mobilizes to recycling
  endosomes (RE), where SGK3 and NHE3 are expressed. PDK1 then activates SGK3, which
  in turn phosphorylates NHE3 and induces exocytotic insertion of NHE3 into the plasma
  membrane (PM). This cascade occurs as part of the acute NHE3 activation by Dex involving
  SGK3. In the absence of SGK3, the activated PDK1 diffuses through cytoplasmic matrix
  and activates SGK1 or SGK2. Activated SGK1 and SGK2 then phosphorylate NHE3 at endosomes
  and potentiate trafficking of NHE3 to PM, a later pathway of NHE3 regulation.
