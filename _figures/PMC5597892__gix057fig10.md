caption: Cartoon depiction of coloured KEGG pathway of gastric acid secretion in the
  stomach. The entry in red represents upregulation during digestion; the entry in
  purple represents high expression. H/K is H+/K+-exchanging ATPase alpha polypeptide.
  CA is carbonic anhydrase. AE is solute carrier family 26 (anion exchange transporter).
