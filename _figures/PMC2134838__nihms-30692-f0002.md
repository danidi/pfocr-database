caption: 'ST/SLT upon binding Gb3 can enter the cell by clathrin-dependent endocytosis,
  and also by clathrin-independent mechanism from lipid rich, plasma membrane microdomains
  (lipid rafts). ST/SLT initially accumulates in EE and from there it moves in retrograde
  fashion to the TGN. During transport to the TGN, ST/SLT subunit A is digested by
  the protease furin resulting in the cleavage of subunit A into two fragments (A1
  and A2) that are held together by an internal disulfide bond. ST/SLT continues its
  journey to the ER, where the enzyme PDI releases fragment A1 from the rest of the
  molecule. A1, which retains the toxic enzymatic activity, translocates then to the
  cytosol from the ER, allegedly using the cellular ERAD machinery. Abbreviations:
  EE, early endosomes; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated protein degradation;
  GA, Golgi apparatus; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins; N, nucleus;
  PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; ST, Shiga toxin; SLT, Shiga-like toxin; TGN, trans-Golgi
  network.'
