caption: The schematic of the redox cycle shows the relationship between antioxidant
  enzymes and glutathione. All enzymes are shown in green, substrates and products
  in blue, and inhibitors in red. Glutathione (GSH) is synthesized from amino acids
  by the action of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), the rate-limiting enzyme,
  and glutamyl synthase (GS). This reaction requires energy, is ATP-limited and is
  specifically inhibited at the level of γ-GCS by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO).
  GSH undergoes the glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-PX) coupled reaction, thereby detoxifying
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A major source of
  H2O2 is the biochemical conversion of superoxide anion (O2-•) by the action of superoxide
  dismutase (SOD). During this reaction, GSH is oxidized to generate GSSG, which is
  recycled back to GSH by the action of glutathione reductase (GSSG-RD) at the expense
  of reduced nicotinamide (NADPH/H+), thus forming the redox cycle. The reduction
  of the glutathione pathway is blocked by the action of 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea
  (BCNU). The major source of NADPH/H+ comes from the conversion of glucose, a reaction
  blocked by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
