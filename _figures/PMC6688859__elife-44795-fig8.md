caption: 'WT cells (which have a functional tRNA thiolation machinery) in amino acid
  (methionine and cysteine) replete conditions have high amounts of thiolated tRNAs.
  In these cells, carbon flux coupled with amino acid utilization is towards nucleotide
  biosynthesis. Sufficient nucleotide levels support growth, and proper cell cycle
  progression, and reflect an overall ‘growth’ metabolic state. The absence of the
  tRNA thiolation machinery results in non-thiolated tRNAs, and here carbon flux is
  driven away from nucleotide synthesis and towards storage carbohydrates, with a
  concurrent accumulation of amino acids. This metabolic rewiring in these mutants
  is due to reduced expression of genes involved in phosphate-responsive signalling
  pathway (a dampened PHO response), which results in a phosphate-limited state. Due
  to this restricted phosphate availability in the thiolation mutants, these cells
  attempt to restore intracellular phosphate levels through a metabolic rewiring,
  via Tps2-dependent trehalose synthesis, accompanied by phosphate release. Thus,
  despite the absence of carbon or nitrogen (amino acid) starvation, the tRNA thiolation
  mutants exhibit an overall metabolic signature of a ‘starved state’, with decreased
  nucleotide synthesis and delayed cell cycle progression. Key: Pho: phosphate transporters,
  Pi: inorganic phosphate, PPP: Pentose Phosphate Pathway, cys: cysteine, met: methionine.'
