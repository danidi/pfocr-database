caption: Determination of SA-regulated genes downstream of a n-butanol-sensitive pathway.
  Among the 4,022 genes that showed differential gene expression in one of the five
  tested comparisons, 214 showed transcript level changes both in the SA versus water
  comparison and in the same direction in the SANB versus SATB comparison as in the
  SANB versus SA comparison. For these genes the transcript levels did not change
  in the same direction in the NB versus TB comparison as in the SANB versus SATB
  comparison. Hence these genes are probably SA regulated via the PLD pathway. Of
  these genes, 147 were up-regulated and 67 were down-regulated by SA treatment. Ninety-seven
  genes out of the 214 showed a positive action of PLD on their SA response.
