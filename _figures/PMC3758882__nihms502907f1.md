caption: 'Normal complement activation cascade and its regulation. This figure illustrates
  the normal complement pathways and the factors that protect the host from injury.
  Complement can be activated by three different pathways: classical, lectin and alternate
  pathways. C3 convertase from the classical and lectin pathways is generated by antigen
  antibody complex and interaction of mannose residues on the microbial surface with
  mannose binding lectin, respectively, in the presence of C4 and C2. The alternate
  pathway is constitutively active at low levels generating C3b. C3b binds with complement
  factor B, which is cleaved by complement factor D to generate C3bBb; the alternate
  pathway C3 convertase. Thus, all three complement pathways converge at C3 convertase.
  Either of the C3 convertases can bind to C3b to generate C5 convertase (C3bBbC3b
  or C4b2aC3b). Either of the C5 convertases can cleave C5 to C5b, which then binds
  to C6, C7, C8 and C9 to generate membrane attack complex. The regulation of complement
  activation is critical to the host. The important complement regulatory proteins
  associated with aHUS are complement factor H, complement factor I and MCP. In the
  presence of complement factor H and MCP, complement factor I cleaves C3b to inactive
  C3b (iC3b). The carbohydrate content of the cell membrane determines whether complement
  factor B or H binds to C3b. Eukaryotes have polyanions on their cell surface and
  C3b in that instance will bind preferentially to complement factor H and C3b is
  inactivated. Prokaryotes (bacteria) lack polyanions and complement factor B binds
  C3b to generate C3 convertase and further activation of the complement system. The
  formation of membrane attack complex is inhibited by vitronectin, clusterin and
  protectin. MCP, membrane cofactor protein.'
