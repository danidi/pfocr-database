caption: The endo-lysosomal system is a complex pathway that is vital to countless
  processes in the cell, and its dysfunction results in the hallmarks of many diseases.
  Shown here are some of the findings from studies detailed in this review, revealing
  many alterations to cell biology in microgravity that are associated with endosomes
  and lysosomes. Further research into alterations of the endo-lysosomal system in
  space may provide substantial new knowledge in its involvement in disease pathogenesis
  to provide new biomarkers or therapeutic targets. ↓↑ depicts up- and downregulation
  observed in spaceflight or associated analogues. Grey arrows depict potential lysosomal
  biogenesis trafficking pathways. Black arrows depict action/downstream effects on
  proteins and pathways.
