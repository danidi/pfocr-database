caption: Potential mechanism of Fn in CRC. (A) Biomolecules (Lps, FadA and Fap2) are
  located on the surface of Fn. Lps breaks the intestinal barrier and facilitates
  the entry of Fn into epithelial cells. It activates MYD88 through TLR4, which further
  activates the NF-κβ-associated proinflammatory pathway, forming the immune microenvironment
  for the occurrence of CRC. FadA activates the E-catenin/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  which contributes to tumor development. Gal-GalNAc on tumor cells is the receptor
  of Fap2 and recruits Fn to the tumor site. In addition, FadA binds TIGT in tumor
  tissues and serves a role in inhibiting T cell and Nκ cell function, which are potential
  mechanisms of tumor immune escape. (B) Upon chemotherapy intervention, Fn activates
  the TLR4/MYD88 signaling pathway, which activates autophagy in CRC cells and contributes
  to chemoresistance. Fn, Fusobacterium nucleatum; CRC, colorectal cancer; MYD88,
  MYD88 innate immune signal transduction adaptor; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; NF-κβ,
  nuclear factor-κB; Gal-GalNAc, D-galactose-β-(–)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine; TIGIT,
  T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domains; NK, natural
  killer; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; FadA, adhesin A; Fap2, fusobacterium autotransporter
  protein 2; ‘P’ in the green circle, phosphorylation.
