caption: Proinflammatory signaling pathways induced by SP-C BRICHOS mutants. Expression
  of SP-C BRICHOS mutants (SP-CΔexon4 and SP-CL188Q) induce an unfolded protein response,
  in part via activation of a canonical endoplasmic reticulum stress–sensing pathway,
  using insulin response element 1 (IRE1). Conformational changes in the cytosolic
  domain of IRE1, which allow for binding to TNF-α receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2),
  can interface with both NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
  IRE1–TRAF2 activates JNK through phosphorylation, with phospho-JNK subsequently
  activating the transcription factor, activating protein 1 (AP1). Nuclear translocation
  of AP-1 leads to an upregulation of IL-8 release. Inhibition of IL-8 release by
  SP600125 treatment indicates that JNK signaling represents the major pathway mediating
  the proinflammatory cytokine response. With more severe misfolding, as observed
  with SP-CΔexon4, the IRE1–TRAF2 complex can also recruit IκB kinase (IKK), which
  phosphorylates and removes the IκB inhibitory subunit of NFκB. 4-PBA treatment downregulates
  NFκB, but not IL-8 release, and suggests that NFκB does not play a significant role
  in the inflammatory response of this system. P, phosphorylation modification.

  description: Proinflammatory signaling pathways induced by SP-C BRICHOS mutants.
    Expression of SP-C BRICHOS mutants (SP-CΔexon4 and SP-CL188Q) induce an unfolded
    protein response, in part via activation of a canonical endoplasmic reticulum
    stress–sensing pathway, using insulin response element 1 (IRE1). Conformational
    changes in the cytosolic domain of IRE1, which allow for binding to TNF-α receptor–associated
    factor 2 (TRAF2), can interface with both NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase
    (MAPK) pathways. IRE1–TRAF2 activates JNK through phosphorylation, with phospho-JNK
    subsequently activating the transcription factor, activating protein 1 (AP1).
    Nuclear translocation of AP-1 leads to an upregulation of IL-8 release. Inhibition
    of IL-8 release by SP600125 treatment indicates that JNK signaling represents
    the major pathway mediating the proinflammatory cytokine response. With more severe
    misfolding, as observed with SP-CΔexon4, the IRE1–TRAF2 complex can also recruit
    IκB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates and removes the IκB inhibitory subunit
    of NFκB. 4-PBA treatment downregulates NFκB, but not IL-8 release, and suggests
    that NFκB does not play a significant role in the inflammatory response of this
    system. P, phosphorylation modification.
