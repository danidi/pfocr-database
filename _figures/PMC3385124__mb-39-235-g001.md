caption: Schematic diagram of Cryptococcus neoformans bisexual mating. a and α represent
  cells of the opposite mating type controlled by the mating type locus (MAT). In
  response to mating induction, the α cell usually produces a conjugation tube, after
  which cell fusion takes place. Important events that take place during sexual development
  are shown in the figure. The genes on the right show the key known components involved
  in mating. For example, pheromone genes, components of the Cpk1 mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinase pathway [], and the HMG domain transcription factor Mat2 are
  important for cell fusion [], whereas the homeodomain transcription factors Sxi1α
  and Sxi2a are necessary for the dikaryotic hyphae formation [, ]. The zinc finger
  transcription factor Znf2 is crucial for hyphal formation in both unisexual and
  bisexual mating []. Dmc1 is the meiotic recombinase which plays a role in homologous
  recombination during meiosis [].
