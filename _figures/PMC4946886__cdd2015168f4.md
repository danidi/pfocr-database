caption: Physical factors regulating lineage commitment of MSCs. MSCs physically interact
  with various components in the tissue microenvironment in vivo. The physical factors
  including cell shape, external mechanical forces, extracellular matrix, and geometric
  structures are involved in stem cell fate decision. By regulating RhoA-ROCK signaling
  pathway, spread cells tend to differentiate into osteoblasts while round cells tend
  to become adipocytes (a). Different physical forces can also direct MSCs to differentiate
  into different lineages via controlling myosin II activity (b). Meanwhile, components
  of extracellular matrix, such as osteopontin and fibronectin, can regulate the adipo-osteogenic
  balance of MSCs through binding to integrin receptors (c). In addition, geometric
  cues such as nanoscale changes can also effectively dictate the differentiation
  of MSCs (d)
