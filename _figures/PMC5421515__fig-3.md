caption: Shear stress and autophagy. OSS mediates LC3-II to LC3-I ratios to promote
  autophagosome biogenesis and p62/SQSTM1 accumulation. Shear-induced autophagy is
  mediated by BMPRs and BMPR-specific Smad1/5 in a pathway that is independent of
  BMPs. LSS-induced autophagy is regulated by p38 MAPK. The BMPR/Smad1/5/p38 MAPK
  cascade modulates expression of LC3B-II proteins. LSS increases phosphorylation
  of AMPK. Activated AMPK may inhibit mTOR. In addition, AMPK can be activated by
  LSS via a pathway that is independent of PECAM-1 and distinct from that resulting
  in AKT activation. Meanwhile, AKT-mediated phosphorylation of BECN1 enhances its
  interactions with 14-3-3 and vimentin intermediate filament proteins. Akt suppression
  of autophagy can also be mediated by mTOR activation, which inhibits the autophagy-initiating
  ULK1 kinase complex. LOX-1 plays an important role in LSS-induced autophagy via
  ROS production. ROS regulates autophagy via various signaling pathways, including
  ROS–FOXO3–LC3/BNIP3–autophagy, ROS–NRF2–P62–autophagy, ROS–HIF1–BNIP3/NIX–autophagy,
  ROS–TIGAR–autophagy, as well as regulation mainly by inhibition of Atg4 activity.
  NO impairs autophagy by inhibiting the activity of the S-nitrosylation substrates
  JNK1 and IKK-β. Inhibition of JNK1 by NO reduces Bcl-2 phosphorylation and increases
  Bcl-2/BECN1 interactions, thereby disrupting Vps34/BECN1 complex formation. Additionally,
  NO inhibits IKK-β and reduces AMPK phosphorylation, leading to mTORC1 activation.
  OSS, oscillating shear stress; BMPR, bone morphogenetic protein receptor; IKK-β,
  inhibits of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta.
