caption: 'Predicted arsenic resistance pathway in R. aetherivorans BCP1 involving
  the NADPH-TrxR-Trx (indicated in red) and the NADPH-MSH-Mrx1 (indicated in blue)
  redox systems. In the MSH/ Mrx-dependent pathway (reactions from 1 to 4 on the left),
  a sulfide bond is generated between the As(V) and the thiol group of a cysteine
  in the MSH/ Mrx-dependent ArsC active site. MSH reduces the disulfide bond forming
  a mycothiol-arsenate conjugate [MS-As(V)] (reaction 1), which is reduced by mycoredoxin
  1 (Mrx1) releasing As(III) and a mycothiol-mycoredoxin mixed disulfide conjugate
  (Mrx1-S-SM) (reaction 2). The mycothiol is recovered via MSH/MTR-pathway in which
  the disulfide bond Mrx1-S-SM is reduced by a second MSH (reaction 3), forming the
  mycothione (MS-SM) that is further reduced into mycothiols by the mycothione reductase
  (reaction 4). In the NADPH-TrxR-Trx pathway (reactions from 5 to 7 on the right),
  the sulfide bond between As(V) and the Trx-dependent ArsC proteins (reaction 5)
  is reduced through a thioredoxin system (possibly a DUF2703-containing protein in
  BCP1) with the release of As(III) (reaction 6). The reduction of the thiol-disulfide
  bond between the ArsC and Trx (ArsC-S-S-Trx) is catalyzed by a thioredoxin reductase
  (TrxR) (reaction 7). JGI locus tag and GenBank access codes: Mycoredoxin Mrx1 (Ga0035244_037036;
