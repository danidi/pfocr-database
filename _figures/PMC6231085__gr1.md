caption: 'Primary carbon metabolism pathways: summary overview of all pathways included
  in the A. niger NRRL 3 manually curated carbon metabolic network. Substrates are
  in green, reactions are depicted with an arrow, reversible reaction are indicated
  with double arrow. Enzyme Commission (EC) number for each reaction is indicated
  beside each reaction, while reactions are identified by numbers in brackets (for
  more information see ). Proteins assigned to the reactions are indicated in black,
  common gene name used in A. niger is noted beside the protein ID where possible.
  Characterised enzymes are in red, enzymes involved in more than one reaction are
  indicated in lighter colour. Dash lines connect metabolites from different pathways.
  * The enzymes associated to that reaction form a complex. Each pathway is highlighted
  with a background shade, the legend for the shades is on the right.'
