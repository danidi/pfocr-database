caption: Schematic representation of how ablation of IκBNS affects B cell activation
  and PC differentiation. Activation of B cells in response to TI antigens is initiated
  through ligation of the BCR and/or Toll‐like receptors, and is enhanced through
  TACI. These surface receptors all trigger activation of the classical NF‐κB pathway
  by degrading the inhibitory IκB protein, consequently releasing the NF‐κB proteins
  that translocate to the nucleus where they are transcriptionally active. In bumble,
  the transcriptional regulation of NF‐κB target genes is altered in the absence of
  IκBNS, resulting in impaired TACI expression, PC differentiation and TI antibody
  responses.
