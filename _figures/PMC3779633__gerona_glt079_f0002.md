caption: Autophagy degrades and recycles cellular components. Autophagy is an intracellular
  recycling pathway in which cellular components, including protein aggregates and
  organelles such as mitochondria, are targeted to the lysosome for degradation. Cellular
  components targeted for degradation are engulfed by a double-membrane structure
  known an autophagosome. Autophagosome formation depends on series of ubiquitin-like
  conjugation reactions. In this process, Atg7, which is an E1-like enzyme, activates
  a ubiquitin-like protein known as LC3. LC3 then becomes conjugated to phosphatidyl
  ethanolamine (PE) and thereby promotes autophagosome production. Importantly, Atg7
  is essential for autophagy and conditional deletion of this gene can be used to
  examine the importance of autophagy in specific cell types.
