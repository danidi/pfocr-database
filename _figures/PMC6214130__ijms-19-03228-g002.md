caption: A schematic representation of pathways linking the gut microbiota, the formation
  of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by flavin monooxygenase (FMO) 3 and the regulation
  of enterohepatic bile acid (BA) and cholesterol metabolism and macrophage reverse
  cholesterol transport (RCT) pathways. Black arrows indicate movement of TMA/TMAO
  and cholesterol through the body. Blunt-end arrows indicate activation (+) or inhibition
  (-) of specified receptors and transporters or pathways. Gut microbiota metabolism
  of choline and l-carnitine results in the formation of trimethylamine (TMA). In
  the liver, FMO3 converts TMA into TMAO. The potential effects of TMAO on the proatherogenic
  pathways include the promotion of foam cell formation by increasing macrophage scavenger
  receptors (↑) and the downregulation of the main liver bile acid (BA) synthetic
  enzymes, cyp7a1 and cyp27a1. Downregulation of these rate-limiting enzymes reduces
  intracellular levels of BA (↓). The BA pool size could impact the farnesoid X receptor
  (FXR)-mediated regulation of FMO3. In turn, this enzyme may regulate the liver X
  receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α signaling
  pathways, reducing liver inflammation (↓) and promoting hepatic lipogenesis and
  gluconeogenesis (↓). FMO3 impairs the cholesterol flux into the nonbiliary transintestinal
  cholesterol export (TICE) pathway (↓). TMAO also reduces Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1
  (NPC1L1) and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) G5/G8 expression (↓),
  and inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption. Collectively, the effects of TMAO/FMO3
  on BA homeostasis and TICE impair the macrophage-to-feces RCT (↓).

  description: A schematic representation of pathways linking the gut microbiota,
    the formation of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by flavin monooxygenase (FMO) 3

    Gut microbiota metabolism of choline and l-carnitine results in the formation
    of trimethylamine (TMA). In the liver, FMO3 converts TMA into TMAO. The potential
    effects of TMAO on the proatherogenic pathways include the promotion of foam cell
    formation by increasing macrophage scavenger receptors (↑) and the downregulation
    of the main liver bile acid (BA) synthetic enzymes, cyp7a1 and cyp27a1. Downregulation
    of these rate-limiting enzymes reduces intracellular levels of BA (↓). The BA
    pool size could impact the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated regulation of FMO3.
    In turn, this enzyme may regulate the liver X receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated
    receptor (PPAR) α signaling pathways, reducing liver inflammation (↓) and promoting
    hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis (↓). FMO3 impairs the cholesterol flux
    into the nonbiliary transintestinal cholesterol export (TICE) pathway (↓). TMAO
    also reduces Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) and adenosine triphosphate-binding
    cassette (ABC) G5/G8 expression (↓), and inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption.
    Collectively, the effects of TMAO/FMO3 on BA homeostasis and TICE impair the macrophage-to-feces
    RCT (↓).
