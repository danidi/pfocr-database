caption: Schematic representation of the main molecular and genetic alterations present
  in hepatocellular carcinoms (HCC). In many cases of HCC are present mutations in
  the TP53 gene which induces changes in the expression of the corresponding protein
  P53. It is also quite common to observe an over expression of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), as well as a RAF-MEK-ERK/MAPK
  signaling pathway activation.
