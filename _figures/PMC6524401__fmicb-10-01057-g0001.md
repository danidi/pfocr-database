caption: Overexpression of IL-6 and its potential negative consequences on the viral
  immune response. Current scientific evidence supports different scenarios where
  imbalance on the IL-6 production after viral infection can affect viral clearance,
  promoting viral persistence and chronic infections. (A) IL-6 might favor Th2 polarization
  by stimulating STAT3 pathway, and consequently increasing the production of IL-4,
  and the suppressor of cytokine signaling one protein (SOCS-1). SOCS-1 affects STAT
  1 phosphorylation, impairing IFNγ production by decreasing IFNγ self-loop stimulation.
  (B) IL-6 might impair cytolysis by inducing the production of SOCS-3, affecting
  phosphorylation of STAT 4, and consequently impairing IFNγ production, an essential
  IFN type II interferon molecule to promote CD8 and NK cells activation. (C) IL-6
  might promote infected cell survival by inducing apoptosis. Overexpression of this
  cytokine increments Th17 polarization, increasing IL-17 production in the cellular
  environment. IL-17 pathway induce the production of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma
  2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma extra-large (Bcl-xL) proteins, which prevent mitochondrion
  to produce the cytochrome complex protein (Cyt-c) after stimulation by the pro-apoptotic
  molecule protease Granzyme B, impairing the production of active apoptotic caspase
  molecules. An additional scenario includes the production of the programmed death
  ligand 1 protein (PD-L1) by the concerted action of IFN type I and IL-6. Matching
  between PD-L1 and programed death protein 1 (PD-1) switches off apoptosis mediated
  by CD8 T cells.
