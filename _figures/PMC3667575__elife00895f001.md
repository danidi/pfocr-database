caption: Cells respond to stress through the unfolded protein response (UPR; right)—which
  is caused by high levels of unfolded or misfolded proteins—and the integrated stress
  response (ISR; left)—which has multiple activators. ISRIB is a small molecule that
  acts at the intersection of these two responses. UPR stress sensors (blue ovals)
  localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ISR kinases (purple text) receive
  stress signals (not shown) and relay these (blue arrows) to the cytoplasm and nucleus
  to reduce the expression of genes. The PERK pathway is involved in both responses;
  the signal from IRE1 is relayed via a protein called XBP1. ISRIB acts downstream
  of the phosphorylation of eIF2 (eIF2(αP)) and upstream of the activation of ATF4
  (green arrow) and the repression of bulk protein synthesis (red down arrow). Sidrauski
  et al. show that ISRIB also enhances memory in rats and mice.
