caption: 'Components of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. When the pathway is switched
  “ON” (blue background), activated mammalian sterile 20-like kinases (MST1 and MST2,
  MST1/2) and Salvador homolog 1 (SAV1) phosphorylate and activate the large tumor
  suppressor kinases (LATS1 and LATS2, LATS1/2). The activated LATS1/2 and MOB kinase
  activators 1 (MOB1) phosphorylate yes-associated protein (YAP) or the transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), leading to YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic retention
  (inactive) and degradation. When the pathway is switched “OFF” (gray background),
  YAP/TAZ accumulates in the nucleus and forms complexes with some transcription factors
  such as TEA domain (TEAD) family transcription factors, runt-related transcription
  factors (RUNX) and p73. Arrow: Increase.'
