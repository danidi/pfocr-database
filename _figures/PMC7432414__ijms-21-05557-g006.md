caption: 'Putative signaling pathway involved in HRPC–CAF transition mediated by PDGF-BB
  increase. In the proposed model, PDGF-BB is involved in HPRC-CAF transition induced
  by 92.1UM, confirmed by the significantly increased of CAF markers. PDGF-BB released
  by activated HRPC binds in an autocrine manner to the receptor PDGFRβ, allowing
  its activation by dimerization and autophosphorylation. In our model, we verified
  the involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway as indicated by the nuclear translocation
  of phospho-STAT3 following activation by 92.1UM. STAT3 transcription factor is known
  to increase the transcription of specific genes such as IL-10, TGF-β1, CCL10, CXCL11,
  and VEGF as observed in HRPC cocultured with 92.1UM. Indeed, activated HRPC could
  support different activities of 92.1UM (proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis,
  and immune escape) by producing different cytokines and chemokines. Imatinib inhibits
  PDGFRβ activation and, consequently, CAF transition and tumor invasiveness. Abbreviations:

  fibroblasts; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor beta; α-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle
