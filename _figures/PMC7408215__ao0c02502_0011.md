caption: . Synergistic Mechanism of the HSYA Together with Lexiscan (Lex) in CIR Injury
  Treatment; The FDA-Approved Adenosine Receptor Agonist Lex Could Transiently Increase
  the BBB Permeability by Inhibiting the Expression of P-gp on the BBB Paracellular
  Pathway, Which Would Promote HSYA to Accumulate in the Brain; for the Investigation
  of HSYA in the Mechanisms on Pyroptosis, the Expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1,
  and GSDMD Was Selected as the Index for Detection; More Than That, the Effect of
  HSYA on the Activation of the NF-κB Signaling Pathway Was Also Studied in This Study;
  the Release of Pro-inflammatory Factors Could Be Prevented by the Inhibition of
  Pyroptosis and Apoptosis Activation; in Conclusion, the Improvement of Pharmacodynamics
  and Drug Defects Would Further Promote the Clinical Application of HSYA.
