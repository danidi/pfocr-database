caption: A. A cartoon representation of the domain structure of integrin beta3 chain,
  with majority of the domains labeled. Phoshorylated threonine residues identified
  in the current study are shown at the bottom. B. Names of six kinases that were
  found to show a direct interaction with ITB3 in the platelet PPI network. C. Signaling
  pathways showing integrin ITA2B and ITB3 and selected interacting protein kinases
  and phosphatases that are present in our platelet PPI network. ITB3 interacts with
  ITA2B (α-chain of the integrin heterodimer) and is found phosphorylated at threonine
  residues T753 and T755 in the resting platelets. Phosphomotif finder  mapping suggests
  that PDPK1 (3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1) is the likely kinase
  that phosphorylates ITB3 at this site. Literature mining also suggests that PDPK1
  interacting protein 14-3-3 inhibits this kinase , , , . Threonine phosphorylation
  of ITB3 maintains it in the inactive state. ITA2B interacting protein phosphatase
  PP1A and/or PP2A likely dephosphorylates this site and leads to generation of non-phosphorylated
  ITB3 . D. In activated platelets, the non-phosphorylated ITB3 is a substrate for
  SRC kinase. HPRD database shows that ITB3 can be phosphorylated at residue Y759
  , . SRC phosphorylation of ITB3 leads to binding of other proteins, such as SHC
  and others , outside-in signaling by the integrin and initiation/augmentation of
  platelet activation , .
