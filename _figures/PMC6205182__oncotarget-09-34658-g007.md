caption: In the conversion of retinol to retinal a feedback regulatory mechanism normally
  maintains homeostatic levels of ALDH (the enzyme that metabolizes retinal into all-trans
  retinoic acid - ATRA). Through this mechanism, ALDH levels are tightly controlled
  by intracellular levels of retinoic acid agonists, particularly ATRA []. Intracellular
  ATRA levels are maintained by the enzyme CYP26A1 which catalyzes ATRA degradation.
  Specifically, RA signaling regulates ALDH via the binding of ATRA to retinoic acid
  receptors RXR and RAR that transcriptionally control ALDH gene expression. In tumor
  cells, several components of this pathway are increased, including ALDH, CYP26A1
  and CtBP1. Increased ALDH in tumors can be explained by the feedback mechanism whereby
  increased CYP26A1 enzyme activity leads to ATRA degradation, and decreased ATRA
  levels then lead to increased ALDH via feedback controls. Specifically, decreased
  ATRA leads to less RA signaling through RXR- and RAR-based transcriptional control
  of ALDH. Moreover, we found that tumor cells have increased CtBP1, which acts as
  a transcriptional repressor of the RAR/RXR/RARE transcriptional complex. Transcriptional
  repression by CtBP1 not only leads to increased ALDH expression, but also up-regulates
  expression of genes that promote cell cycling.
