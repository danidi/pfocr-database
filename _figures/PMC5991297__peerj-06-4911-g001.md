caption: The advanced glycation end-product (AGE)—AGE receptor (RAGE) pathway can
  be activated by the binding of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs)
  like S100B (S100 calcium-binding protein B) and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1
  protein) from dying cells, or AGEs, derived from oxidized proteins, lipids, and
  nucleic acids. RAGE can signal through the MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase)
  signaling transduction proteins like Raf (MAPK kinase kinase), MEK1 (MAPK kinase),
  ERK1/2 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase), leading to the phosphorylation and
  nuclear translocation of key transcription factors like Ets1, Jun and NFAT5 (Nuclear
  factor of activated T-cells 5).
