caption: The metabolism of DβHB in mitochondria is stereospecific to the D isoform.
  Under normal physiological conditions, the level of DβHB is low but becomes dramatically
  elevated during starvation, increased fatty acid metabolism or pathological conditions
  such as diabetes. From its site of production in the liver, DβHB is released into
  the blood and circulated for utilization by other tissues. In general, the rate
  of ketone body usage in the brain is proportional to the concentration in the circulation
  . Circulating DβHB readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters brain mitochondria
  where it is metabolized by mitochondrial β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to acetoacetate,
  which is subsequently converted to acetyl-coenzyme A to feed into the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) cycle. The intermediate products generated from this cycle, NADH
  and succinate, in turn feed into the electron transport chain to subsequently generate
  ATP at complex V. Through this metabolic pathway, DβHB is an excellent alternative
  source of energy in the brain when glycolysis is not operative or when glucose supply
  is depleted such as during starvation .
