caption: Temporal regulation of the floral volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (FVBP)
  pathway in petunia. The FVBP pathway is the primary metabolic pathway of petunia
  for scent production. The FVBP pathway is composed of a series of enzymes (shown
  in blue ovals), which includes 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase
  (DAHPS), 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), chorismate mutase
  1 (CM1), arogenate dehydratase (ADT), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 3-ketoacyl-CoA
  thiolase (KAT1), benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol/phenylethanol benzoyltransferase (BPBT),
  S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BSMT),
  and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H). These enzymes modify products of the Calvin cycle
  into volatile scents that are emitted by the flowers (volatile products shown in
  pink). Solid lines in the FVBP pathway represent single enzymatic steps, while dotted
  lines represent multiple steps. Representative daily mRNA expression patterns are
  drawn for selected genes. The relationship between LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY)
  and GIGANTEA (GI) in the circadian oscillator was conceptualized based on knowledge
  obtained from Arabidopsis research and their expression patterns in petunia. Transcriptional
  regulators in the FVBP pathway are highlighted by yellow backgrounds, including
  ODORANT 1 (ODO1), EMISSION OF BENZENOIDS I (EOBI), EOBII, and MYB4. Solid arrows
  connecting transcription factors to FVBP genes denote confirmation of direct molecular
  binding demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), yeast one-hybrid,
  and/or transient reporter assay; dashed lines lack this confirmation. EOBI may regulate
  the FVBP gene expression more directly (not through the regulation of ODO1). The
  general emission pattern of benzenoid compounds is shown in the bottom left-hand
  corner; this profile is synthesized based on daily scent emission profiles of four
  major benzenoids in .
