caption: The known JS-associated proteins are depicted in red and have been shown
  to localize to the basal body and/or primary cilium in at least some contexts. ARL13B,
  RPGRIP1L and possibly MKS3, CEP290 and CC2D2A are required for primary cilium/basal
  body formation or maintenance ,,,,. Direct contact between proteins indicates in
  vivo or in vitro evidence for physical interactions that are likely cell type and
  cell cycle dependent. Activation of the SHH signaling pathway (orange) relieves
  the suppression of SMO activity by PTCH, allowing SMO to enter the cilium and alter
  the balance of GLI activator and repressor transcription factors to control cell
  fates in a wide variety of tissues (reviewed in Eggenschwiler and Anderson 2007;
  Wong and Reiter 2008)., arl13b and rpgrip1l mutations in mice disrupt SHH signaling
  and cause randomization of left-right asymmetry, neural tube defects and polydactyly.,
  The primary cilium/basal body is required for PDGFα signaling pathway (blue) that
  is involved in regulation of the cell cycle, cytoskeletal organization and cell
  migration (reviewed in Andrae et al. 2008; Christensen et al. 2008)., Although the
  mechanism is unknown, the PC/BB also plays a role in regulating the balance between
  canonical (green) and non-canonical (black) WNT pathways (reviewed in Clevers 2006;
  Gerdes and Katsanis 2008).,
