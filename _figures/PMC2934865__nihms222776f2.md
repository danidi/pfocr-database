caption: Hypothetical model for SUMO regulation in NFκB pathway. Sumoylation of IκBα
  mediated by Ubc9 and RSUME competes off the ubiquitination pathway, which stabilizes
  IκBα and inhibits NFκB signaling. IL-1R is also sumoylated upon stimulation, which
  conduces to signal transduction. The question marks indicate processes which have
  not been fully substantiated experimentally.
