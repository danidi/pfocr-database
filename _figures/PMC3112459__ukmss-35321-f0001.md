caption: Once cleaved from latent TGF-β binding protein (four isoforms, LTBP1-4) the
  mature and active dimeric TGF-β (three isoforms, TGFB1-3) can bind to heteromeric
  receptor complexes formed by type I (TGFBR1; ALK5 and ALK1 (activin A receptor type
  II-like 1)) receptors and type II (TGFBR2) receptors, initiating signal transduction.
  The binding of TGF-β to the receptor complex is facilitated by type III co-receptors,
  such as endoglin. Endoglin is expressed at particularly high levels in endothelial
  cells (). Activation of receptor kinase domains initiates downstream signalling
  by phosphorylation of transcription factors e.g. SMAD1-5 (SMAD family members).
  The SMAD complex migrates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor to regulate
  cell and phenotype specific patterns of gene expression. SMAD6 and SMAD7 block phosphorylation
  of SMAD2 or SMAD3 and act as inhibitors of the TGF-β signalling pathway (, ). SMADs
  are widely expressed in most adult tissue and cell types indicating that this TGF-β
  signalling mechanism is ubiquitous.
