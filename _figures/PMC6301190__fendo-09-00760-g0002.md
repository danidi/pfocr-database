number: Figure 2
caption: Scheme illustrating the FSHR biased signaling. The upper part of the figure
  presents the G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent signal transduction of
  the wild-type FSHR. The lower part of the figure shows the bias toward either the
  G protein-dependent pathway (left) or the β-arrestin pathway (right) when a binding-deficient
  and a signal-deficient FSHR are co-expressed.
