caption: 'The potential molecular mechanisms of crosstalk between nuclear receptors
  LXR and FXR–SHP–LRH-1 regulatory cascade in the liver and intestine. Bile acids
  act as ligands for FXR, which regulates transcription by binding as a heterodimer
  with RXRs. This step results in increased SHP expression. SHP in turn inhibits LRH-1,
  preventing the activation of target genes that participate in bile acid and fatty
  acid synthesis. In the absence of bile acids, LRH-1 acts together with LXR to stimulate
  bile acid synthesis [, , ]. The important pathways in the intestine that contribute
  to modulation of bile acid synthesis are also depicted (see text for details). There
  is a bile-acid-mediated activation of intestinal FXR and, as a result, the release
  of FGF15 in the small intestine. The secreted FGF15 by the intestine circulates
  to the liver, likely through the portal circulation or lymph flow [] and induces
  the activation of FGFR4 in the liver. The FGF15/FGFR4 pathway synergizes with SHP
  in vivo to repress CYP7A1 expression []. Bas: bile acids; FGF: fibroblast growth
  factor; FGFR4: FGF receptor; FXR: farnesoid X receptor; LRH-1: liver receptor homologue-1;
  LXR: liver X receptor; RXR: retinoid X receptors; SHP: short heterodimer partner.
