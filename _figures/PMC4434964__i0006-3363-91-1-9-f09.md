caption: Models of EGF network and CNP/NPR2 signaling in the regulation of LH-induced
  ovulation. In the wild-type mice, LH activates its receptor on GCs of POFs, leading
  to stimulation of cAMP-dependent signal cascades, which induces the expression of
  EGF-like factors and suppresses the CNP/NPR2 signaling. Activation of EGF network
  is involved at early time points (fast, 15–30 min), while CNP decrease may be involved
  at later time points (2–4 h). These two pathways act together or in parallel to
  induce meiotic resumption. In the presence of AG1478, CNP availability is primarily
  responsible for the reduction in cGMP. In the EgfrΔ/flCyp19-Cre mice, either the
  residual EGFR signaling or another pathway is responsible for the early decrease
  in cGMP.
