caption: (1). The host through recognition of an as yet undefined viral RNA PAMP in
  the cytoplasm detects WNV. RIG-I acts as the primary PRR sensor for WNV during the
  early stages of infection. RIG-I activation promotes association with IPS-1, which
  leads to recruitment of TRAF3 and TBK1, and phosphorylation of IRF-3. NF-κB and
  ATF-2/c-Jun and the small amounts of constitutively expressed IRF-7 may also be
  activated via this IPS-1-dependent pathway. IRF-3, IRF-7 NF-κB, ATF-2/c-Jun translocate
  to the nucleus, bind the IFN-β gene promoter and promote transcription. Secretion
  of IFN-β by infected cells during this early phase results in autocrine and paracrine
  type I IFN signaling through binding of the IFN-αβR. (2). Activation of IFN-αβR
  results in phosphorylation of JAK1 and Tyk2, which activate STAT1 and STAT2 leading
  to formation of the heterotrimer ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2 and IRF-9). Nuclear translocation
  and promoter binding of ISGF3 upregulates hundreds of different ISG, including IRF-7.
  (3). During a later phase of infection, detection of WNV in MEF also relies on MDA5
  and PKR. Recruitment of TRAF3 and TRAF6 activates IRF-3 and IRF-7. NF-κB and ATF-2/c-Jun
  are also activated via an as yet undefined mechanism. Subsequently, IRF-3, IRF-7,
  NF-κB, and ATF-2/c-Jun translocate to the nucleus, bind the IFN-β gene promoter
  and induce optimal transcription. Induction of IFN-α genes occurs through TRAF6
  and the transcriptional activation of IRF-7.
