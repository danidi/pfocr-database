caption: Models to explain HDAC-mediated regulation of MHC gene expression during
  hypertrophy. (A) Induction of βMHC gene expression by blocking the activity of class-II
  HDACs (HDAC 4/5). Class-II HDACs binds to SRF and MEF2 leading to repression of
  their gene transcription activity. Hypertrophy stimuli activate the activity of
  a kinase (Ca/calmodulin dependent kinase and/or HDAC kinase), which phosphorylates
  two serine residues conserved in class-II HDACs []. Upon phosphorylation, class-II
  HDACs are exported out from nucleus to cytoplasm, resulting in the de-repression
  of SRF and MEF2 transcription activity and induction of the βMHC expression from
  SRF and MEF2 binding sites [, ]. In a parallel pathway, activation of the PK-c signaling
  phosphorylates TEF1 leading to activation of its gene activation potential. TEF1
  physically binds and functionally interacts with SRF and MEF2. It is therefore likely
  that a combined effect of these three regulators of gene expression controls the
  βMHC gene induction in response to hypertrophic stimuli. (B) Activation of αMHC
  gene expression by trichostatin A (TSA). The effect of TSA on αMHC induction is
  mediated by inhibition of the class-I HDACs and it occurs in euthyroid and not in
  hypothyroid animals (see text). In the absence of ligand (T3), thyroid receptor
  (TR) interacts with a multiprotein co-repressor (CoR) complex that contains class-I
  HDACs. This complex represses the gene transcription. In the presence of ligand
  (T3), the TR undergoes a conformational change, which results in replacement of
  the co-repressor complex with an activator complex (CoA) that contains HATs (p300/PCAF).
  Inhibition of HDACs by TSA enhances the activity of this activator complex with
  TR, resulting in the induction of the α-MHC gene expression. The activity of αMHC
  gene promoter is also controlled by change in activity of PARP1, which is activated
  by elevated levels of Ca2+ and increased activity of MEK/ERK1/2 signaling. PARP1
  forms a repressor complex with class-I HDACs. Thus, TSA can also activate the αMHC
  gene expression by blocking the repressor activity of PARP1/class-I HDACs complex.
  In this context, another MHC gene regulator, TEF1, which physically binds to PARP1
  can also modulate the PARP activity. TEF1 is phosphorylated by PK-A, and that stimulates
  its gene transcription activity []. Thus, we propose that the activation of PARP1
  by TSA, and the activation of TEF1 by PK-A-signaling may have a co-operative effect
  for the activation of the αMHC gene expression (for details see text).
