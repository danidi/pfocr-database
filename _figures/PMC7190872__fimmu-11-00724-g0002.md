caption: Crosstalk between TLR4, NLRP3 inflammasome, and complement promotes neuroinflammation
  in Alzheimer's disease. Priming of the inflammasome occurs when the transcription
  factor, NF-kB, is activated, triggering the production of both NLRP3 and Pro-IL-1β.
  NF-kB can be activated via the TLR/IL-1R MyD88-dependent pathway and the C3/C5 MAPK
  pathway. The TLR pathway can be induced by a bacterial component, such as LPS, and
  the MAPK pathway can be induced by C3a/C5a binding to their respective receptors.
  The activation of NF-kB through complement, TLR and IL-1R pathways may create a
  synergistic increase in pro-inflammatory factors. The inflammasome can be activated
  in several ways, including an increase of endogenous damage-associated and pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns or an efflux of potassium or chloride ions. Additionally, aggregated
  fibrillary Aβ engulfed by the microglia can damage the lysosome and leak into the
  cytoplasm, also contributing to the activation of the inflammasome. Activation of
  the inflammasome can induce pyroptosis, leading to the secretion of IL-1β and ASC
  specks. ASC specks bind to Aβ and seed the surrounding parenchyma leading to further
  Aβ aggregation. Aggregated Aβ can also bind to TLR and induce activation of the
  MyD88 pathway. Likewise, IL-1β secreted from the pyroptotic microglia can bind to
  IL-1R and induce activation of the MyD88 pathway. The induction of the MyD88 pathway
  through the by-products of microglial pyroptosis may lead to a vicious cycle of
  inflammasome priming, inflammasome activation and pyropotosis that will exacerbate
  Aβ pathology.
