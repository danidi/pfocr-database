caption: Conditional Wnt pathway activation, mRNA tagging, and microarray analysis
  to identify seam and VPC-specific Wnt targets. Outlined here is the procedure used
  to conditionally activate the Wnt pathway in L2/L3 worms by heat shock and enrich
  for transcripts expressed in the seam cells and VPCs using the mRNA tagging method.
  An SC+VPC-specific enhancer element from the bar-1 gene (bar-1e) was used to drive
  FLAG-tagged poly-A tail binding protein (PAB-1) in the seam cells and VPCs. Crosslinked
  FLAG-PAB-1-mRNA complexes were immunoprecipitated, enriching for transcripts from
  those cell types. Transcript profiles after heat shock from the three indicated
  strains were determined using a C. elegans genomic DNA microarray, and transcripts
  upregulated in response to Wnt pathway activation were identified. A subset of genes
  was subject to further in vivo characterization based on criteria of their identity
  or independent qPCR validation.
