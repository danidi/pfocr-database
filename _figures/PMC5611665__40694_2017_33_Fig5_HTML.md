caption: The possible carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of Neurospora crassa. The gene
  products/enzymes responsible for each enzymatic reaction are indicated. Site of
  chemical changes from precursor molecules are shaded. Molecular groups that distinguish
  xanthophylls from carotenes are marked with red circles. The pigments found in N.
  intermedia N-1 are presented in boxes
