caption: (Left) The thiamine biosynthetic pathway uses the branch-point metabolite
  aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR) from de novo purine biosynthesis. ThiC catalyzes formation
  of HMP-P from AIR, which is subsequently phosphorylated prior to being condensed
  with THZ-P to form thiamine-phosphate. Thiamine-phosphate is further phosphorylated
  to thiamine-pyrophosphate (TPP). (Right) Coenzyme A is synthesized from pantothenate
  in five steps. The production of the pantoate is predominantly catalyzed from ketopantoate,
  an intermediate in valine biosynthesis, by PanE. The branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic
  enzyme acetohydroxyacid isomoreductase (IlvC) has weak ketopantoate reductase activity.
