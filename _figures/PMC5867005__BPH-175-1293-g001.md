caption: UPR signalling pathway. The three ER‐resident transmembrane proteins, ATF6,
  IRE1 and PERK, associate with Bip in their inactive state under normal condition.
  In response to ER stress, these sensors are released and activated. Both IRE1 and
  PERK are oligomerized and autophosphorylated. Phosphorylated IRE1 catalyses the
  splicing of XBP1 mRNA leading to the generation of UPR‐target transcription factor.
  Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α leading to general translational attenuation
  and increased expression of ATF4. ATF6 is cleaved by SP1/SP2, and the cytosolic
  fragment of ATF6 migrates to the nucleus. The downstream effectors of these three
  signalling pathways, in combination, induce the expression of proteins, which can
  help restore the ER protein folding capacity. ERAD is accelerated to remove terminally
  misfolded proteins.
