caption: HOCl-alb upregulates ICAM-1 protein and mRNA expression in vascular endothelial
  cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The pathobiological effects of HOCl-alb
  on endothelial cells are caused by the activation of a redox-sensitive intracellular
  signaling cascade involving ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, and culminating in NF-κB. The upstream
  part of this pathway involves NOXs activation. As a specific inhibitor of NOXs,
  apocynin inhibits the pathological biological effects induced by HOCl-alb. NOXs
  are important interventional targets, and blocking NOXs-related pathways might protect
  against endothelial dysfunction and vascular diseases ().
