caption: FHIT-substrate complex as a signaling molecule. Intracellular Ap3A substrates
  may increase following external stimuli such as peroxide and UV light. The FHIT
  signaling pathway is activated when FHIT binds Ap3A substrate. Hydrolysis of Ap3A
  substrate into AMP and ADP, or Src phosphorylation of Tyrosine 114 and subsequent
  degradation may inactivate the signaling pathway.
