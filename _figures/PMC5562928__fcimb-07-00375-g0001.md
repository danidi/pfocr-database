caption: 'Model of amino acid synthesis in I. scapularis. The main enzymes involved
  in tyrosine, cysteine, serine, glycine, methionine, alanine, glycine, glutamate,
  glutamine, asparagine, aspartate and proline synthesis that were identified in the
  genome of I. scapularis (Table ) are shown. The interplay between amino acid and
  glucose metabolism (i.e., glycolysis and TCA cycle) intermediates is also shown.
  The names of the enzymes were abbreviated as follow: phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH),
  dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), glutamate synthase (GLUS), asparagine synthetase
  (AsnRS), asparaginase (ASPG), glutamine synthetase (GS), aspartate aminotransferase
  (AST), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR1),
  delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT),
  alanine transaminase (ALT), alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), methionine
  adenosyltransferase (MAT), methionine synthase (MS), Adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY),
  phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), cystathionine
  beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionase (Cystationine gamma lyase) (CTH), phosphoserine
  aminotransferase (PSAT1) and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). The metabolic
  intermediates were abbreviated as follow: oxaloacetate (OAA), 3-phosphoglycerate
  (3-PGA), 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (3-P(OH)Pyr), 3-phosphoserine (3-Pser), inorganic
  phosphate (Pi), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet).
  The dashed line represents the VOMIT pathway (where V stands for valine, O for odd-chain
  fatty acids, M for methionine, I for isoleucine, and T for threonine) that transforms
  α-ketobutyrate in the TCA cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA. The VOMIT pathway involves
  three enzymes (propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta chain, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase
  and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase) no displayed in the figure (Table ). Glutamate γ-semialdehyde
  is the open-chain tautomer of Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. The circular arrow symbol
  represents the nonenzymatic and reversible interconversion of Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  to glutamate γ-semialdehyde.'
