caption: 'Characterization of complex transporter-mediated model of carbon allocation
  and energy supply for oil synthesis in developing P. sibirica seeds. The identified
  intracellular metabolite transport routes of carbon allocation and energy supply
  for oil synthesis are mainly based on a combination of our previous 454 sequencing
  data analysis and qRT-PCR detection. The background color distinguishes different
  subcellular locations and/or pathways as follows: Light green signifies a direct
  involvement in glyoxysomal glyoxylate cycle and β-oxidation; light blue signifies
  a cytosolic location; yellow signifies mitochondrial TCA cycle; orange signifies
  plastidial glycolysis and OPPP; light purple signifies the vacuole; pink signifies
  the ER membrane. Dark purple arrows represent the transports of metabolite and energy
  across intracellular membrane by specific transporters. All transporters involved
  in carbon flux allocation and energy provision for oil synthesis and TAG mobilization
  are shown in yellow. Abbreviations for the transporters, enzymes and metabolites
  are as follows: AAC ATP/ADP carrier, ACBP acyl-CoA-binding protein, ACO aconitase,
