caption: Melanocortins such as α-MSH and ACTH, produced in the pituitary and the epidermis,
  act as high-affinity agonistic ligands to the MC1R, a Gs-protein coupled receptor
  on the surface of melanocytes. As a result, adenylyl cyclase is activated and cytoplasmic
  levels of the second messenger cAMP increase. This leads to activation of cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA) and upregulation of the cAMP responsive binding
  element (CREB) and microphthalmia (Mitf) transcription factors. Together, CREB and
  Mitf stimulate melanin production through increased expression of melanin biosynthetic
  enzymes such as tyrosinase. Through increased production and accumulation of UV-blocking
  melanin pigments, the skin is better protected against UV insults. In addition to
  stimulating melanin production, MC1R/cAMP signaling also enhances the ability of
  melanocytes to resist and recover from UV damage by boosting nucleotide excision
  repair (nucleotide excision repair), the genome maintenance pathway charged with
  the removal of mutagenic UV photolesions.
