caption: 'Schematic representation of the main pyruvate dissimilation pathways in
  K. lactis. EMP, Embden-Meyerhof pathway; HMP, hexose-monophosphate pathway; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle. Key enzymatic reactions at the pyruvate branch point are
  catalyzed by the following enzymes: ➊, pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1; ⊗ indicates
  that this activity is absent in the K. lactic strain PMI/C1); ➋, alcohol dehydrogenase
  (EC 1.1.1.1); ➌, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.4 or EC 1.2.1.5); ➍, acetyl
  coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (EC 6.2.1.1); ➎, acetyl CoA shuttle from the cytosol
  to mitochondria; ❻, acetyl CoA shuttle from mitochondria to the cytosol; and ❼,
  heterologous l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). Enzymatic reactions involved
  in anaplerotic syntheses have been omitted. Black arrows indicate the metabolic
  pathway leading to the production of lactic acid from glucose in heterolactic and
  homolactic strains PM6-7A(pEPL2) and PMI/C1(pEPL2), respectively. A schematic representation
  of the expression cassette [KlPDC1 promoter and l-(+) LDH gene] on the plasmid pEPL2
  is also shown.'
