caption: Incorporation of D-amino acids into peptidoglycan via racemase-dependent
  and racemase-independent pathways. The intracellular processing of D-alanine is
  contrasted with the perpiplasmic addition of D-methionine, which is “swapped” at
  the C-terminus of peptidoglycan, mediated by the transpeptidase domains of penicillin
  binding proteins (PBPs). D-Met may be incorporated into peptidoglycan muropeptides
  by exogenous administration or by physiologic production, with the latter associated
  with transition into the stationary phase and downregulation of peptidoglycan synthesis.
  The putative pathway of 11C retention following [11C] D-Met administration to infected
  animals is highlighted in red. GlcNAc = N-acetylglucosamine, MurNAc = N-acetyl-
  muramic acid, m-DAP = meso-diaminopimelic acid.
