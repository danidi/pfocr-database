caption: Toll-like receptor signaling during ischemia–reperfusion injury. Specific
  receptors, such as TLRs, are activated during ischemia–reperfusion through damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), which activate downstream MAPK pathway and via different
  transcription factors such as NFκB and c-fos-c-jun, and translate different cell
  adhesion and inflammatory molecules, which causes inflammation. This pathway also
  acts through inflammasomes formation and through caspase 1 activation, which also
  results in inflammation.
