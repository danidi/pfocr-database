caption: Schematic of proposed model. A) During AD pathogenesis, Aβ directly interacts
  with VEGFR2, blocking the ability of VEGF to bind to VEGFR2, disrupting signaling.
  The complete Aβ/VEGFR2 pathway is currently unknown. B) DV directly binds both VEGFR2
  and the α5β1 integrin, increasing tube-like structure formation in brain endothelial
  cells by increasing VEGF secretion and VEGFR2 expression, creating a proangiogenic
  positive feedback loop. When α5 expression is reduced, DV is unable to induce VEGF
  secretion and thus is unable to rescue Aβ’s reduction in the formation of tube-like
  structures. DV signals through α5β1 in MBECs to activate the Akt/ERK mitogen activated
  pathway. VEGF/VEGFR2 can signal through the same pathway, inducing the expression
  of VEGF. We propose that DV prevents Aβ from binding to VEGFR2 by directly binding
  to VEGFR2 itself and/or by increasing the VEGF amount to a level where it can outcompete
  with Aβ for receptor binding and subsequently induce an angiogenic signal.
