caption: 1) In response to a painful stimulus to the skin (or other peripheral tissue),
  ATP is released to activate ionotropic and metabotropic ATP receptors. 2) ATP signaling
  is terminated by degradation of ATP to ADP by NTPDase3, resulting in a more prolonged
  activation of ADP receptors (due to the lower efficiency of NTPDase3 for ADP hydrolysis
  over ATP), as well as inhibition by ADP of adenosine production by 5′-ectonucleotidases.
  Whereas ATP receptors (P2X, P2Y2, P2Y4) are either ionotropic or Gq-coupled and
  thus likely to be excitatory, ADP receptors in sensory neurons include both the
  pro-nociceptive Gq-coupled P2Y1 and the Gi-coupled P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptors, which
  are likely to exert an anti-nociceptive influence (). 3) Finally, hydrolysis of
  ADP provides a pool of extracellular AMP and removes inhibition of 5′-ectonucleotidases,
  resulting in production of adenosine (ADO) by NT5E and TM-PAP (PAP). Arrow sizes
  indicate differences in efficiency for hydrolysis of ATP versus ADP and AMP. The
  G protein coupling of each receptor is indicated. Zylka and colleagues have demonstrated
  a powerful antinociceptive effect of adenosine in the dorsal horn mediated by the
  A1 receptor (, Sowa et al., 2009, ). This figure illustrates the signaling machinery
  for nucleotide signaling at the peripheral sensory axon terminal, however a similar
  organization is likely at the central presynaptic terminal in the dorsal horn. Note
  that NTPDase3 expression was also found in the superficial epidermis (not shown),
  and presumably regulates levels of ATP released in this region. This figure was
  constructed in part using the pathway builder tool on www.proteinlounge.com.
