caption: 'Schematic model of the interactions of MT-3 and its implication on the biological
  functions of MT-3. The hypothetical model describes the process of secretion of
  MT-3, from the astrocytes into the extracellular milieu, through its interaction
  with Rab3A, 14-3-3 zeta, Exo84p (Left panel). The uptake of MT-3 into the neurons
  and their growth regulation: uptake is facilitated through the interaction with
  the plasminogen (PGn) and enolase (either, αγ or γγ). Once inside the neurons, MT-3
  protects the neurons from the extension and the outgrowth through its interaction
  with DRP-2. In Alzheimer''s disease, oxidative stress alters several proteins involved
  in the interaction with MT-3, therefore potentially affecting the pathway of secretion
  and/or the uptake.'
