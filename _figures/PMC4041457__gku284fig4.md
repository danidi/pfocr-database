caption: The SDSA (synthesis-dependent strand annealing) and DSB repair sub-pathways.
  D loop formation and DNA repair synthesis can follow two different routes namely
  SDSA and DSBR to complete homologous recombination. In SDSA invading strand is displaced
  from D-loop and annealed with complementary strand associated with second end of
  the DSB. SDSA is preferred over DSBR during mitosis, and mainly results in a non-crossover
  product. In the DSBR pathway, the other end of the DSB is captured and double Holliday
  Junctions (dHJs) intermediate is formed which is then resolved to produce cross-over
  (mainly during meiosis) or non-crossover products.
