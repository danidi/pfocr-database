caption: Mammals have two distinct but ultimately converging pathways to apoptosis.
  Signalling via death receptors is indicated on the right. The ‘death receptor' pathway
  is activated by the stimulation of extracellular ‘death receptors' (such as, Fas/CD95)
  by their cognate ‘death ligands' (FasL/CD95L). The adaptor protein FADD then promotes
  recruitment and activation of the ‘initiator caspase', caspase-8. Caspase-8 in turn
  proteolytically activates ‘effector caspases' (caspase-3, -6 and -7). Caspase-8-mediated
  proteolytic activation of the BH3-only protein Bid connects the ‘death receptor'
  pathway to the ‘Bcl-2 regulated' pathway and serves to amplify the apoptosis cascade.
  This amplification mechanism is essential for Fas-induced killing in so-called type
  2 cells (e.g., hepatocytes) but dispensable in type 1 cells (e.g., thymocytes).
  The Bcl-2-regulated pathway is indicated on the left, and is activated in response
  to a broad range of cell stressors, such as growth factor deprivation or chemotherapeutic
  drugs. The pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (members of the Bcl-2 family; red boxes)
  serve as molecular sensors to initiate apoptosis in response to these cellular stresses.
  Their ability to kill cells is dependent on the multi-BH domain pro-apoptotic Bax/Bak-like
  Bcl-2 family members. BH3-only proteins are thought to activate Bax/Bak either directly
  or indirectly by unleashing them from the pro-survival Bcl-2 family members. Regardless
  of mode of activation, activated Bax/Bak cause permeabilisation of the mitochondrial
  outer membrane (MOMP) with consequent release of apoptogenic factors (e.g., cytochrome
  c, Smac/DIABLO). Together with the adaptor protein Apaf-1, cytochrome c promotes
  activation of the ‘initiator caspase', caspase-9 that in turn leads to ‘effector
  caspase' activation and subsequent cell demolition. The colour reproduction of this
