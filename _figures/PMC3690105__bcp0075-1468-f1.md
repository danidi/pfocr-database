caption: Metabolic pathway of clopidogrel. The pro-drug, clopidogrel, is converted
  to a minor (10–15%) active thiol metabolite (SR26334) upon sequential metabolism
  by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Upon secretion into plasma, the active metabolite
  is either plasma protein bound (>98%) or as the unbound species which is available
  for irreversible binding with platelets in order to inhibit their aggregation. On
  the other hand, hepatic carboxylesterase is responsible for the formation of the
  major (∼85%) inactive carboxyl metabolite (R-130964). Our hypothesis is that the
  inactive metabolite, which is highly plasma protein bound (>98%) and available in
  high concentrations in plasma, might compete with the active metabolite for the
  plasma protein binding sites. This would result in decreased plasma protein binding
  and increased unbound active metabolite, thus leading to enhanced pharmacological
  response
