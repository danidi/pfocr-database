caption: Numerous miRNAs were found to be over-expressed in naïve CD4 T cells of MS
  patients that target TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, SMAD2 and SMAD4. In contrast, 3 miRNA were
  down-regulated that were predicted to target SMAD7, a negative regulator of the
  TGF-β signaling pathway. Severin et al [] found that these miRNAs reduced the ability
  of naïve CD4 T cells to differentiate into Tregs which may partially explain the
  Treg defect observed in MS patients.
