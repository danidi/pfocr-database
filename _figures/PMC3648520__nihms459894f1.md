caption: Double strand breaks induced by DNA damage are first resected to produce
  3’ DNA tails, which become coated by the ssDNA binding protein RPA. Recombination
  mediator proteins, such as Rad52 in yeast and BRCA2 in humans, promote the exchange
  of RPA by a helical filament of Rad51. DNA synthesis occurs after strand invasion
  catalyzed by the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. The resulting DNA joint can
  be processed through either the SDSA pathway or the DSBR pathway. In the former,
  the invading strand is ejected by Mph1/FANCM/Fml1 and then becomes annealed with
  the other ssDNA end. The SDSA pathway generates exclusively noncrossover recombinants.
  In the DSBR pathway, the second DSB end is captured to yield a double Holliday junction
  (dHJ), which is either resolved by a HJ resolvase to generate crossover or noncrossover
  products, or it can be dissolved by the concerted action of the Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complex
  in yeast and BLM-Topo IIIa-RMI1/2 complex in humans to generate noncrossover products
  exclusively.
