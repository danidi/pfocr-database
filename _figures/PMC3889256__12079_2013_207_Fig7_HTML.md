caption: Rsu1 is a critical component for regulation of p38 Map kinase signaling from
  the IPP complex. Rsu1 is required for the constitutive and EGF-induced p38 signaling.
  The elimination of Rsu1 reduces both constitutive and EGF-induced p38 phosphorylation
  and the expression of N92D-Rsu1 activates constitutive p38 signaling. p38 Map kinase
  can be activated by detachment and this may occur via the αPix-induced Rac pathway.
  Dashed and dotted lines represent incompletely characterized pathways

  and - independent mechanisms.
