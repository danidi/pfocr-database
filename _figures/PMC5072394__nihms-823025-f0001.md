caption: RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) have been identified as important cytoplasmic
  viral RNA sensors that recognize the genomic RNA and/or RNA replication intermediates
  of numerous viruses. The two RLR members retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein
  (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are kept inactive
  in uninfected cells through the phosphorylation of their caspase activation and
  recruitment domains (CARDs) and carboxy-terminal domains (CTDs). In addition, RIG-I
  adopts a ‘closed’ auto-inhibited conformation. Following viral infection, RIG-I
  recognizes cytoplasmic viral short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that contains a 5′-triphosphate
  or 5′-diphosphate moiety, whereas MDA5 detects long dsRNA structures. Following
  the binding of RNA, RIG-I and MDA5 are dephosphorylated by PP1α or PP1γ, which induces
  the formation of a signalling-active CARD conformation. RIG-I is further activated
  by the Lys63-linked ubiquitylation of its CARDs that is mediated by tripartite motif
  protein 25 (TRIM25). Riplet, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediates the Lys63-linked
  ubiquitylation of the CTD of RIG-I, which is also crucial for the activation of
  RIG-I. Lys63-linked ubiquitylation induces the tetramerization of RIG-I (the signalling-active
  form of RIG-I), which subsequently interacts with the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral
  signalling protein (MAVS) on mitochondria, mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs)
  or peroxisomes (not shown). The mitochondrial-targeting chaperone protein 14-3-3ε
  is essential for the translocation of RIG-I to mitochondrial MAVS. In the case of
  MDA5, binding to long dsRNA induces MDA5 filament formation, which subsequently
  enables MDA5 to bind to MAVS. MAVS activates TBK1 or IκB kinase-ε (IKKε) as well
  as the IKKα–IKKβ–IKKγ complex, which activate interferon (IFN) regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3) and IRF7, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), respectively, through phosphorylation
  events. IRF3 and/or IRF7 and NF-κB together with activator protein 1 (AP1; not illustrated)
  induce the gene expression of type I IFNs (mainly IFNα subtypes and IFNβ), type
  III IFNs (IFNλ subtypes), and many other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
  to establish an antiviral state. Solid arrows indicate direct signalling events.
  Dashed arrows indicate indirect signalling events. DENV, dengue virus; HBV, hepatitis
  B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; IAV, influenza A virus; JEV, Japanese encephalitis
