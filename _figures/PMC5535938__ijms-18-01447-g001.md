caption: The growth hormone (GH) receptor signaling and target genes in the liver.
  GH binds to the GH receptor and activates the janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling pathway. Several target genes
  of STAT5, including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ (PPARγ), play an essential role in the liver. The decrease in GH receptor
  signaling induces a decrease in IGF-I expression, resulting in the progression of
  fibrosis. At the same time, an increase in the expression of PPARγ, peroxisome proliferative
  activated receptor γ, coactivator-1α(PGC1α), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36),
  and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and a decrease in the expression of very low density
  lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), cause the impaired lipid metabolism, leading to steatosis.
  GH, growth hormone; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor-I.
