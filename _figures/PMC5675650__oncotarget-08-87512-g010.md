caption: The schematic diagram indicates the structure and functions of HPTA (spermatogenesis
  and T biosynthesis), and shows the reactions leading from cholesterol to T including
  the originating cell (Leydig cells), corresponding enzymes, and organelles in which
  the reactions are carried out. 17β-HSD, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 3β-HSD,
  3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; CYP17, cytochrome P450c17 subfamily a; CYP19,
  cytochrome P450c19 subfamily a; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; LH, luteinizing
  hormone; FSH-R, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing
  hormone (GnRH); INH-α, inhibin subfamily α; INH-β B, inhibin subfamily β B; LH-R,
  luteinizing hormone receptor; P450scc, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme; StAR,
  steroidogenic acute regulatory protein.
