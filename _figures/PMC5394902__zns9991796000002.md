caption: Canonical pathway and upstream regulator effects analysis identifies inflammatory
  response, migration, and proliferation pathways enriched in trkB.T1 KO astrocytes.
  To examine which upstream regulators and pathways were statistically significantly
  enriched in our dataset, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) and GO::TermFinder.
  Upstream regulator analysis demonstrated that our set of differentially regulated
  genes was predicted to inhibit cellular migration, proliferation pathways, and inflammatory
  response genes (not depicted in figure due to number of differentially regulated
  genes; gene list can be found in Table 1 at https://www.nursing.umaryland.edu/directory/susan-dorsey/).
  Per the prediction legend, blue is predicted inhibition; orange is predicted activation.
  Genes colored in green are significantly downregulated in trkB.T1 KO astrocytes
  compared with WT astrocytes. Red indicates upregulation of the particular gene.
  The yellow line indicates that the findings from the RNAseq experiment are inconsistent
  with the state of the downstream outcome from the upstream regulator (e.g., proliferation,
  migration). The darker the color, the greater the degree of dysregulation.
