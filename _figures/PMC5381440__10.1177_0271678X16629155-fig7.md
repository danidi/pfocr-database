caption: 'Schematic representation of the hypothetical signalling pathway leading
  to endothelium-dependent dilation in static versus pulsatile pressure conditions.
  (a) Under static pressure, flow promotes endothelial-dependent dilation, sensitive
  to both eNOS inhibition with L-NNA and to PEG-catalase, which degrades H2O2; this
  suggests that eNOS is uncoupled and produces  that, in turn, is converted into the
  dilatory H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Flow-mediated dilation is therefore
  eNOS-dependent, but mostly NO-independent, as confirmed by the measurement of insignificant
  NO and large H2O2 production during FMD under static pressure. Flow-mediated dilation
  is also reduced by the specific NOX2 inhibitor gp91ds-tat, suggesting that NOX2
  participates in the dilatory pathway: flow activates an unidentified shear stress
  sensor, which may stimulate the NOX2/eNOS complex, leading to the production of
  H2O2 and to dilation. How NOX2 and eNOS are associated remains to be identified.
  Acetylcholine also promotes a dilation that is reduced by L-NNA, PEG-catalase and
  gp91 ds-tat, suggesting that FMD and ACh activate similar pathways, i.e. NOX2/eNOS-derived
  H2O2. Acetylcholine activates the muscarinic receptor, which is associated with
  the Gq heterotrimeric G-protein; the α-subunit of the Gq protein is coupled to phospholipase
  C (PLC) that promotes intracellular Ca2+ release, which activates eNOS and, to a
  lesser extent, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) release. The link
  between the muscarinic receptor and NOX2/eNOS complex could be through the β-subunit
  of the Gq protein. (b) Under pulse pressure, flow promotes endothelium-dependent
  dilation sensitive to L-NNA and gp91ds-tat, but insensitive to PEG-catalase. This
  suggests that eNOS is coupled and that the NOX2/eNOS complex leads to NO release,
  as confirmed by the significant NO production during FMD under pulsatile pressure.
  The nature of the pulse sensor and how it is associated to NOX2/eNOS complex are
  unknown. Under pulsatile pressure, acetylcholine induces a dilation that is lower
  than that observed under static pressure; the dilation is reduced by L-NNA, but
  augmented by gp91ds-tat and by PEG-catalase. The fact that both NOX2 inhibition
  and favoured H2O2 degradation augment the dilation suggests that the pulsatile pressure
  promotes  production (via NOX2 and possibly other sources) that inactivates eNOS-derived
  NO. Ach: acetylcholine; EDHF: endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor; FMD: flow-mediated
