caption: Regulation of TLS in replication-associated ICL repair. The FA core complex
  not only regulates the incision step by monoubiquitinating FANCD2, but also contributes
  to the recruitment of a TLS polymerase REV1 to the lesion, thus promoting bypass
  of the ICL intermediate. FAAP20 is an important factor in both steps, as it stabilizes
  FANCA (therefore keeping the integrity of the FA core complex) and interacts with
  monoubiquitinated REV1 via its UBZ4 domain to promote stable association of the
  PCNA/REV1 DNA damage bypass complex at the stalled replication fork. REV1 controls
  the polymerase switching of TLS polymerases to restore the leading strand synthesis
  mediated by Pol ζ. It is not clear whether RAD18-dependent PCNA monoubiquitination
  is a prerequisite for the REV1 recruitment to the ICL region. In contrast, PCNA-Ub
  enhances the recruitment of UBZ4-containing SNM1A to the ICL site. The 5′–3′ exonuclease
  activity of SNM1A trims the unhooked intermediate to generate a favorable substrate
  for TLS ().
