caption: 'An efferent vagus nerve can inhibit inflammation through the activation
  of splenic nerve (A) by a neuroimmune pathway constituted by alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor (α7nAChR)-expressing mesenteric ganglia (B) and splenic acetylcholine-producing
  T lymphocytes. Afferent vagal signaling, sympathetic C1 neurons (G) and cortical
  stimulation (H) can prevent local joint inflammation by a mechanism dependent on
  activation of LC (F) followed by stimulation of splanchnic nerve (E) or synovial
  sympathetic innervations (C & D). An articular non-neural cholinergic system improves
  local inflammation by a mechanism dependent on a7nAchR expressed in macrophage/fibroblast
  (C) while a neural adrenergic system inhibits local inflammation by direct (β-adrenoceptors)
  or indirect (IL-10-producing B lymphocytes) mechanisms (D). A recent hypothesis
  suggests that non-neural acetylcholine can be produced by peripheral T-cells that
  migrate to organs (e.g., spleen) after vagal stimulation (I). LC: Locus coeruleus.'
