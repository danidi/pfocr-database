caption: 'Proposed chemoresistance mechanism mediated by RAB7A. CDDP enters the cell
  through specific transporters, by passive diffusion or by endocytosis. The uptake
  of CDDP in cells with functional endocytic trafficking leads to activation of apoptosis
  following sequestration of drug in lysosomes and consequent Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization
  (LMP) induction. Uptake of CDDP into cells in which RAB7A is downregulated with
  a reduction in the size, number and acidification of lysosomes, leads to CDDP efflux
  through the EVs and then to a resistant phenotype. EE: Early Endosome; LE: Late
  Endosome; MVB: Multivesicular Body.'
