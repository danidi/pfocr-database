caption: 'Outline of the three main pathways of colon carcinogenesis. A classic, conventional
  pathway is initiated by APC mutations and progresses through the sequential accumulation
  of genetic mutations and chromosomal instability (CIN), causing microsatellite stable
  (MSS) tumors. The germline mutation pathway is related to germline mutation of mis-match
  repair (MMR) genes, seen in Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis coli) and leads
  to microsatellite instability (MSI-H). The sessile-serrated-methylation pathway
  is heterogeneous: a traditional serrated pathway, related to KRAS/BRAF mutations,
  leading to MSS tumors, with a variable CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP); a
  traditional serrated pathway, comprising three subgroups: one leading to MSS and
  CIMP+ tumors, one associated with BRAF mutated and KRAS-WT and hypermethylation
  of MGMT and p16 gene promoters; the two others leading to MSI-H and CIMP+ tumors,
  one associated with BRAF-mutations and KRAS-WT and hypermethylation of the MLH1
  gene promoter and the other one associated with BRAF-WT and KRAS-mutated and hypermethylation
  of the MLH1 gene promoter.'
