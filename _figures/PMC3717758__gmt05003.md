caption: Cellular transport of memapsin 2Memapsin 2 is a type I transmembrane protein
  that is synthesized in the ER, post-translationally modified in the Golgi and secreted
  to the cell surface where it undergoes coupled endocytosis with APP, thereby resulting
  in the presence of both proteins in the endosomal compartment ApoE-containing lipoprotein
  particles can trigger the endocytosis of complexes formed by ApoER2, APP, and memapsin
  2. This event is mediated by adaptor protein X11. Memapsin 2 cleaves APP in the
  acidic endosomal environment that constitutes the first cleavage event in the amyloidogenic
  pathway leading to Aβ production. From the endosomes, memapsin 2 is recycled back
  to the cell surface through the secretory pathway. Phosphorylation of the dileucine
  motif on memapsin 2 results in an interaction with GGA or the retromer complex,
  which allows for the transport of memapsin 2 from the endosomal system to the Golgi.
  Once in the Golgi, memapsin 2 is transported back to the cell surface and remains
  unphosphorylated.
