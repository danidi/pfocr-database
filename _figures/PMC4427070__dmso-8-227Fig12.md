caption: 'Summary of the three-way interaction among AMPK, SIRT1, and eNOS.Notes:
  AMPK and SIRT1 exhibit a bidirectional interaction in response to cellular energy
  status and regulate lipid metabolism and inflammatory status. The eNOS–NO–cGMP pathway
  merges with the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway through activation of eNOS by AMPK phosphorylation
  of Ser1177 and by SIRT1 deacetylation of Lys 496 and 506. SIRT1, in turn, is stimulated
  by the eNOS-mediated increase in NO, thus creating a three-component loop. While
  HFD or caloric excess inhibit the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway and consecutively eNOS activity,
  caloric excess or leucine act as activators of this pathway. PDE5-inhibitors increase
  eNOS activity by yet unknown mechanisms, thereby also indirectly stimulating AMPK/SIRT1
  downstream effects. In addition, PDE5-inhibitors increase cGMP levels and consecutively
  PKG, which also regulates inflammation. Thus, leucine combined with PDE5-inhibitors
  act together to reverse the inhibitory effects of HFD and caloric excess on the
  AMPK/SIRT1 pathway.Abbreviations: eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; AMPK,
