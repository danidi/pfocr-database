caption: In both C. elegans and Drosophila, changes in O2 levels directs acute behavioral
  responses mediated by atypical nucleotide guanylate cyclases (GCs). GCs can bind
  O2, which regulates the enzymatic activity of GCs to convert GTP to cyclic GMP.
  In vertebrates, sensing reduction in O2 levels directs ventilation responses in
  the carotid body by altering the H2S level, which increases upon hypoxia. There
  are also acute behaviors that require mechanisms independently of cyclic nucleotides
  in C. elegans and it remains unknown whether vertebrates also use GCs to modulate
  ventilation. Sensing changes in CO2 levels in both C. elegans and vertebrates appears
  to be mainly mediated by GCs and/or adenylate cyclases; whether this is also the
  case in Drosophila remains to be seen. The perception of carbonation in mammals
  uses pH-sensing mechanisms via carbonic anhydrase (CA)-generated protons. In all
  animal species examined so far, an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional pathway
  mediates the homeostatic response to hypoxia. The O2-sensing hydroxylase EGLN family
  proteins is modulated by the antagonizing actions of O2 and H2S to inhibit HIF transcription
  factors, which ultimately direct adaptive responses to hypoxia by the transcriptional
  regulation of its numerous target genes.
