caption: 'Role of spleen tyrosine kinase in alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic
  steatohepatitis pathogenesis. Excessive alcohol consumption and Increased fat accumulation
  due to an increased fat biogenesis and reduced metabolism, causes hepatocellular
  injury that generates reactive oxygen species, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines leading to activation of resident macrophages (Kupffer cells), and
  recruitment of circulating immune cells including neutrophils and monocytes. Overconsumption
  of alcohol also trigger the production of lipopolysaccharides due to increased intestinal
  permeability. Increased levels of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Lipopolysaccharides)
  and damage-associated molecular patterns (released from dying hepatocytes) that
  in turn interacts with toll-like receptors e.g., toll-like receptor 4 resulting
  in the activation of spleen tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway,
  and inflammasome activation. These processes develop into liver inflammation and
  fibrosis via increased infiltration and activation of immune cells and hepatic stellate
  cells, respectively. SYK: Spleen tyrosine kinase; LPS: Lipopolysaccharides; PAMPs:
  Pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs: Damage-associated molecular patterns;
  TLRs: Toll-like receptors; HSCs: Hepatic stellate cells; ROS: Reactive oxygen species.'
