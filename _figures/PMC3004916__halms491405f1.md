caption: 'This model highlights the main differences in glucose and fatty acids utilization
  between quiescent (A) and highly proliferative cells (B). Red arrows indicate preferred
  metabolic pathway. In non-proliferating cells glucose can either be used for glycogen
  or fatty acids synthesis, or can be converted to pyruvate through basal rate of
  glycolysis that occurs in the cytoplasm. Pyruvate is then imported into the mitochondrion
  where it is decarboxylated to acetyl Coa or oxalacetate (OAA). Circulating fatty
  acids are also imported into non-proliferating cells were they are stored as triglycerides
  or oxidized into the mitochondrion to generate acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA derived from
  both glucose and fatty acids is then oxidized through TCA cycle that produces intermediate
  citrate that is directed toward mitochondrial OXPHOS to generate ATP. In contrast,
  in proliferative cancer cells, the glycolytic flux is largely increased and most
  of the imported glucose is converted to the glycolytic end-product, pyruvate. The
  resulting pyruvate is mainly converted to lactate which is secreted from the cells,
  whereas the remaining pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, which in turn is directed
  toward de novo FA synthesis. Circulating fatty acids are also mainly oxidized to
  generate acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA derived from both glucose and fatty acids is then
  oxidized through TCA cycle to produced intermediate citrate. The resulting citrate
  is not directed toward OXPHOS but rather is exported to the cytoplasm where it is
  re-converted to acetyl-CoA, which, in turn, is used for de novo fatty acids biosynthesis.Abbreviations:
  Glc, glucose; FA, fatty acids; OAA, oxaloacetate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; OXPHOS,
  oxidative phosphorylation.'
