caption: P. gingivalis gingipains (Kgp, HRgpA, RgpB) inhibit the classical, lectin,
  and alternative pathways of complement activation by degrading the central complement
  component C3. This prevents the deposition of C3b opsonin or the membrane attack
  complex (MAC) on the bacteria. P. gingivalis protects itself against complement
  also by using HRgpA to capture the circulating C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a negative
  regulator of the classical and lectin pathways. P. gingivalis interacts with TLR2
  (specifically with the CD14–TLR2–TLR1 signaling complex) and with TLR4. TLR4 activation
  is prevented by the bacterium’s atypical LPS that can act as a TLR4 antagonist.
  A subset of TLR2 responses is subverted by P. gingivalis through instigation of
  signaling crosstalk with complement receptors. By means of its HRgpA and RgpB which
  release biologically active C5a from C5, P. gingivalis activates the C5a receptor
  (C5aR) in macrophages and induces intracellular Ca2+signaling which synergistically
  enhances the otherwise weak cAMP responses induced by TLR2 activation alone. The
  resulting activation of protein kinase A (PKA) inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β
  (GSK3β) and inhibits iNOS-dependent intracellular killing (in macrophages). P. gingivalis-activated
  TLR2 also induces an inside-out signaling pathway, mediated by RAC1, PI3K and cytohesin-1
  (CYT1), which transactivates complement receptor-3 (CR3). Activated CR3 binds P.
  gingivalis and induces ERK1/2 signaling, which in turn selectively downregulates
  IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression through suppression of IFN regulatory factor 1
  (IRF1). This ERK1/2 pathway is also induced downstream of C5aR. Inhibition of IL-12,
  and secondarily IFN-γ, results in defective immune clearance of P. gingivalis.
