caption: 'Positive and negative regulators of hepcidin synthesis. Hepcidin regulators
  are activated by different stimuli: positive (iron status, inflammation), and negative
  (erythropoietic activity, and hypoxia). HFE is a component of an iron-sensing complex
  that involves interactions with diferric transferrin (Tf-Fe2), transferrin receptors
  (TFR-1 and TFR-2) at the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. High concentrations of
  Tf-Fe2 displace HFE from TFR1, which then forms a complex with TFR2 and HJV to promote
  bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling to hepcidin (,). HJV is a GPI-linked
  protein that activates hepcidin as a co-receptor for BMP cytokines. Only BMP2 and
  BMP6 have been so far demonstrated to activate hepcidin in vivo (,,,). In the liver,
  hepcidin is expressed only in hepatocytes while BMP2 and BMP6 are expressed almost
  exclusively in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) suggesting a paracrine
  function of these ligands (). How LSECs sense changes in body iron levels and upregulate
  BMP2 and BMP6 is still to be defined. Two types of BMP receptors, type I (BMPRI)
  and type II (BMPRII) are involved in this pathway, and both types, as well as their
  ligands, act as dimers. The regulatory SMADs (R-SMADs), SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8
  are the mediators of BMP signalling, as they are phosphorylated by activated BMPRIs.
  The common SMAD4 translocates to the nucleus in complex with the R-SMADs to induce
  the expression of genes regulated by BMP-responsive elements, as hepcidin. BMP/SMAD
  signaling to hepcidin is suppressed by matriptase 2, a serine protease, codified
  by TMPRSS6 that cleaves and generates a soluble form of HJV. Erythroferrone (ERFE),
  a TNFα-like protein released by mature erythroblasts in condition of enhanced erythropoiesis,
  is a major candidate of erythropoiesis-induced hepcidin suppression (). Platelet-derived
  growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is the candidate of hypoxia-induced hepcidin inhibition
  by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), likely produced by a non-erythroid Ter119neg
  population under hypoxia stimuli (,). Infection and inflammation markedly increase
  hepcidin synthesis through the interaction of interleukin 6 (IL6) with its receptor
  (IL6R) and STAT3 pathway ().'
