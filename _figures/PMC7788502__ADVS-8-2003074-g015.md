caption: FUS‐enabled neuromodulation. a) FUS is constructed from concaved PZT ceramic
  array. b) A schematic of precision organ‐based neuromodulation in which the innervation
  points of known axonal populations are targeted for stimulation using pulsed FUS.
  Targets investigated herein include innervation points within the spleen and sensory
  terminals within the liver. FUS stimulation is shown to reduce cytokine response
  to endotoxin via activating the cholinergic anti‐inflammatory pathway (upper) and
  the hepatic FUS stimulation is shown to modulate pathways that regulate blood glucose
  (below). Reproduced with permission.[] Copyright 2019, Springer Nature.
