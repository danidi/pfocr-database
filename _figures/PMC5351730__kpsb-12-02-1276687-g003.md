caption: A working model on how PP2A-C5 might be involved in salt signaling pathway
  in Arabidopsis. The specific PP2A holoenzyme containing the C5 subunit up-regulates
  activities of AtCLCc and/or AtCLCa on vacuolar membrane by removing phosphates from
  its substrate proteins, leading to more anions (i.e., Cl− and NO3−) to move into
  vacuole, thereby resulting in increased salt tolerance or better growth and development
  under treatment of NaCl, KCl, and KNO3. AtCLCc, H+/Cl− antiporter; AtCLCa, H+/NO3−
  antiporter; NHX, H+/Na+ antiporter; V-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase; V-PPase, vacuolar
  pyrophosphatase.
