caption: 'Phytosterol Biosynthetic Pathway.Cycloartenol, the first polycyclic sterol
  intermediate, is converted into the dominant C5-sterols: cholesterol, campesterol,
  and sitosterol. The color code distinguishes the degree of C-24 alkylation (blue
  for the C1 addition and red for the C2 addition) on the black carbon skeleton of
  the sterol intermediates or products. For the names of the products and some intermediates,
  the color indicates whether the sterol has no addition (black), C1 addition (blue),
  or C2 addition (red) at C-24. The kinetically favored pathway for biosynthesis of
  cholesterol (black), campesterol (blue), and sitosterol (red) is also indicated
  with colored arrows. The enzymatic steps are numbered as follows: 1, S-adenosyl-l-methionine:C24(25)
  C-methyltransferase; 2, C-4 methyl oxidase/C-3 dehydrogenase/C-3 keto reductase;
  3, cycloeucalenol-obtusifoliol isomerase; 4, C-14 demethylase; 5, C14 reductase;
  6, C8-C7 isomerase; 7, S-adenosyl-l-methionine:C24(28) C-methyltransferase; 8, C-4
  methyl oxidase/C-3 dehydrogenase/C-3 keto reductase; 9, C5 desaturase; 10, C7 reductase;
  and 11, C24(25) reductase.'
