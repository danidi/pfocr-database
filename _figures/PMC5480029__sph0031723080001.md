caption: Sulfide (S2−) homeostasis and small-molecule chemistry that couples reactive
  sulfur species (RSS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). (A) Sulfide (S2−, HS−,
  and H2S) and O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS) are substrates for cysteine synthase (CysK)
  to form l-cysteine. l-Cysteine is the biosynthetic precursor to the major cellular
  reducing thiol in S. aureus, bacillithiol (BSH), and to coenzyme A (CoASH), which
  plays important roles in acyl-transfer reactions. l-Cysteine is also the precursor
  to other major sulfur-containing cofactors, including [Fe-S] clusters, biotin, lipoic
  acid, and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Lipoic acid and TPP function in the pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (pyruvate deHase) complex (upper right), used to synthesize acetyl-CoA,
  which is fed into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and other cellular processes.
  S2– can be accumulate in cells either from exogenous sulfide sources or endogenously
  via the activity of two enzymes in a transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine β-synthase
  (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), which converts homocysteine to l-cysteine.
  (B) Nitroxyl (HNO) defines an intersection of sulfide, LMW thiols (RSH), reactive
  sulfur species (RSS), reactive oxygen species (ox), and nitric oxide (NO·). Sulfide
  can lead to the accumulation of inorganic polysulfides (HSnH) and of organic persulfides
  (n = 1) and polysulfides (RSSnH), collectively termed reactive sulfur species (RSS),
  for which there is evidence in mammalian cells () and bacterial cells (). These
  RSS are sensed by CstR (), leading to the upregulation of a sulfide oxidation system
  that includes a canonical sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) (, ). The RSS can
  also be derived from exogenous or endogenous NO·, which reacts with oxidized sulfur
  species (Sox, RSox) to create the nitrosothiol thionitrous acid (HSNO) and organic
  nitrosothiols (RSNO), which in turn react with S2– to make HNO (). HNO can also
  be made via 1-electron reduction of NO· or other transformations (top of figure;
  note that not all possible reactions are shown []). (C) Angeli’s salt (AS) is an
  HNO donor () which, at pH values between 4 and 8, decomposes to HNO (pKa, 11.4)
  () and nitrite (NO2−). HNO further reacts with O2 to create the potent oxidant peroxynitrite
  (ONOO−), which in turn can react with S2– of [Fe-S] clusters to give perthionitrite
  (SSNO−) (), thus leading to the decomposition of protein-bound [Fe-S] clusters.
  SSNO− is unstable in aqueous solution and may regenerate HNO (). HNO is also a highly
  reactive electrophile at neutral pH that reacts with protein thiols to form sulfinamides
  in aqueous solution (); this reaction is in competition with HNO dimerization to
  form N2O and H2O () (not shown).
