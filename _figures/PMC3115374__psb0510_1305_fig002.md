caption: Schematic representation of JA and ET function in herbivore-attacked tobacco
  plants. Herbivore attack, composed of wound signal and release of insect elicitors
  to the wounds, induces a strong burst of defense hormones, JA and ethylene. While
  both signals suppress local growth in attacked leaves, JA and ET are also required
  to trigger accumulation of root-produced nicotine alkaloid in local (attacked) and
  systemic (undamaged) tobacco leaves. In contrast, trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI)
  expression and protein activity in the leaves requires only JA signaling pathway
  that is independent of ET.
