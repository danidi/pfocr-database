caption: Revised model of the molecular network underlying hypocotyl elongation. TCP-mediated
  developmental signals and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF)-mediated environmental
  signals converge at the level of YUC-dependent auxin synthesis to regulate a common
  pathway that promotes cell expansion in the hypocotyl. It was previously shown that
  TCP4 induces LOX genes that encode key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic
  acid (), the phytohormone that promotes YUC transcription (), and that PIF4 regulates
  temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation by directly activating YUC8 (). Red arrows,
  direct transcriptional activation; black arrows, downstream effects; reversible
  arrows, protein/protein interactions; T-bar, repression. (Adapted from Challa et
  al. [2016], Figure 8B.)
