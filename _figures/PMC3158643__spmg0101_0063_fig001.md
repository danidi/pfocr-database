caption: '(A) Intracellular modulators of the SMAD signaling pathway. The binding
  of a dimeric TGFβ superfamily ligand (e.g., TGFβ, activin or BMP) to its respective
  type I and type II receptors at the cell surface initiates phosphorylation of R-SMADs
  (SMAD2 and SMAD3 in the case of activins and TGFβ and SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 in
  response to BMPs). Phosphorylated R-SMADs complex with Co-SMAD4, accumulate in the
  nucleus and, in association with other transcriptional co-regulators, drive or repress
  target gene expression. TGFβ superfamily members can also activate the mitogen-activated
  protein kinases ERK1/2, p38 and JNK. SMAD2/3-mediated signaling is enhanced by the
  endosomal proteins HGS (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate)
  and ZFYVE9 zinc finger FYVE domain containing 9 protein (the murine homologue of
  human SARA). SMURF1 and SMURF2 are E3 ubiquitin ligases that cause proteosomal degradation
  of activated receptors (in conjunction with the inhibitory SMAD7) and of SMAD2 and
  SMAD3, thereby downregulating activin/TGFβ signaling. MAN1 and NET25 localize to
  the inner nuclear membrane. MAN1 (Lemd3) antagonizes activin/TGFβ/BMP signaling
  by sequestering SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5 away from chromatin binding. NET25 (Lemd2) is
  a truncated form of MAN1 that is unable to bind SMAD proteins but which is a potent
  inhibitor of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Production of one or more
  of these modulators has the potential to selectively influence the capacity of a
  cell to respond to one or more TGFβ superfamily ligands. (B–D) Differential expression
  of genes encoding related TGFβ superfamily signaling modulators during mouse testis
  development, as determined by Affymetrix microarray. (B) Transcript levels of the
  endosome-localized HGS, (C) Smurf1 and Smurf2 and (D) Man1 and Net25 exhibit distinct
  profiles corresponding to progressive changes in the cellular populations throughout
  the first wave of spermatogenesis. Man1 transcript levels are highest between days
  18 and 21, concordant with the prevalence of spermatocytes while Hgs and Net25 levels
  peak around day 26–35, when round spermatids predominate. Data are compiled from
  Schultz et al. 2003 and Shima et al. 2004 (Hgs: GDS605; Smurf1 and Smurf2: GDS606;
  Man1 and Net25: GDS409, available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). Time of first appearance
  of differentiating germ cell types are depicted above graphs; gon: gonocyte, spg:
