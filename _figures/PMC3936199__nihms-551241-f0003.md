caption: Three major pathways are critical for regulating basal and stimuli-induced
  hepcidin expression. Binding of iron containing Tf to Tfr1 causes a dissociation
  of Tfr1-High FE (HFE) complex and an interaction of HFE with Tfr2. Increased stabilization
  of Tfr2 increases BMP6 mediated phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/ 8 and recruitment of
  SMAD 1/5/8 and SMAD4 to the hepcidin proximal promoter. BMP/SMAD signaling is the
  major pathway by which hepcidin expression is coordinated to meet systemic iron
  requirements. Activation of hepcidin by inflammation is thought to act independently
  of the BMP/SMAD pathway. The best-studied mechanism is via the pro-inflammatory
  mediator IL-6. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) initiates activation
  of the JAK-STAT3 pathway. STAT3 binds directly to the proximal promoter to increase
  hepcidin expression. Hypoxia and erythropoiesis are inhibitors of hepcidin expression
  and these are the least understood pathways by which hepcidin expression is regulated.
  Hypoxia and erythropoiesis have been shown to inhibit hepcidin expression via direct
  binding of HIF to the proximal promoter, an EPO-EPO receptor (EPOR) mediated decrease
  in C/EBPα expression, and through increase in an unknown erythroid derived factor
  which signals through an undefined pathway.
