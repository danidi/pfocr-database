caption: Schematic depicting glucose metabolism and cellular signaling In highly glycolytic
  progressor tumors and repressor tumors undergoing therapy. In the progressor tumor
  (left), constitutive activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway by PD-L1 expressed on tumor
  cells causes high levels of tumor cell glycolysis and absorption of extracellular
  glucose. Decreased extracellular glucose levels causes impaired glycolysis in T
  cells, wherein depletion of the glycolytic metabolite PEP causes unrestrained SERCA
  activity, sequestration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ into the ER and impairment of TCR-induced
  Ca2+ flux and effector function. In the regressor tumor (right), therapeutic anti-PD-L1
  antibodies bind to PD-L1 causing its endocytosis and inactivation. Loss of constitutive
  PD-L1 signaling leads to decreased activation of the Akt-mTOR pathway decreased
  tumor cell glycolysis and increased extracellular glucose concentrations. Increased
  extracellular glucose drives T cell glycolysis, replenishing PEP levels, inhibiting
  SERCA-dependent sequestration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and promoting TCR-induced Ca2+
  flux and anti-tumor effector functions. Alternatively, constitutive overexpression
  of PCK1 in adoptively transferred T cells increases availability of PEP leading
  to inhibition of SERCA, increased anti-tumor effector function and tumor regression.
