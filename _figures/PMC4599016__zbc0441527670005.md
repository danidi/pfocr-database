caption: A model for two separate Gα13 Switch Region signaling pathways. G13SR1 is
  a classical receptor-coupled signal transduction pathway where agonist interaction
  with a surface membrane GPCR leads to G13SR1 activation and subsequent downstream
  signaling events, e.g. calcium mobilization, RhoA and Src activation, etc. In contrast,
  signaling through G13SR2 is not directly GPCR-dependent, but rather calcium-dependent.
  In this case, elevation of intraplatelet calcium promotes the recruitment of talin
  by the CalDAG-GEF/Rap1/RIAM pathway, binding of G13SR2 to whole talin, cleavage
  of the talin rod domain, binding of the Gα13-talin head complex to the cytoplasmic
  tail of β3 integrin, and dissociation of Gα13 from the talin head complex. Because
  of these significant differences in signaling mechanisms, selective inhibition of
  G13SR1 and G13SR2 signaling produces markedly different effects on human platelet
  function. Thus, inhibition of G13SR1 signaling only blocks PAR1-mediated platelet
  aggregation, whereas inhibition of G13SR2 signaling blocks aggregation in response
  to all platelet agonists.

  description: A model for two separate Gα13 Switch Region signaling pathways. G13SR1
    is a classical receptor-coupled signal transduction pathway where agonist interaction
    with a surface membrane GPCR leads to G13SR1 activation and subsequent downstream
    signaling events, e.g. calcium mobilization, RhoA and Src activation, etc. In
    contrast, signaling through G13SR2 is not directly GPCR-dependent, but rather
    calcium-dependent. In this case, elevation of intraplatelet calcium promotes the
    recruitment of talin by the CalDAG-GEF/Rap1/RIAM pathway, binding of G13SR2 to
    whole talin, cleavage of the talin rod domain, binding of the Gα13-talin head
    complex to the cytoplasmic tail of β3 integrin, and dissociation of Gα13 from
    the talin head complex. Because of these significant differences in signaling
    mechanisms, selective inhibition of G13SR1 and G13SR2 signaling produces markedly
    different effects on human platelet function. Thus, inhibition of G13SR1 signaling
    only blocks PAR1-mediated platelet aggregation, whereas inhibition of G13SR2 signaling
