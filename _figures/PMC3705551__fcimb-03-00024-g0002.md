caption: 'Major catabolic and anabolic pathways in mammalian cells. Glucose uptake
  by the transporters GLUT or SGLT, glycolysis (GL, red arrows) and gluconeogenesis
  (GN; specific reactions marked by blue arrows); pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP;
  broken red arrows); tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA; green circle); glutaminolysis
  (GLNLY, magenta arrows) and the associated TCA reactions. β-oxidation (β-Ox) and
  other catabolic reactions occurring in the mitochondrium and (mainly) in the cytosol
  are marked by black arrows. Anabolic reactions leading to amino acids, nucleotides,
  and lipids are indicated by broken thick black arrows. Also indicated are the reactions
  leading to NADH, NADPH, NAD, and ATP, respectively. Metabolites are marked in black
  and enzymes in blue. Abbreviations: HK, hexokinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; FBP,
  fructose bisphosphatase; PK, pyruvate kinase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex;
  PYC, pyruvate carboxylase; PCK, PEP-carboxylase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; CS,
  citrate synthase; ICD, isocitrate dehydrogenase; ACL, ATP-dependent citrate lyase;
  ME, malate enzyme; ETC, electron transfer chain for aerobic respiration (small red
  circle), consisting of complexes I–IV and of ATPase (complex V); small blue box:
  glutamine transporters SLC1A5 and ASCT2.'
