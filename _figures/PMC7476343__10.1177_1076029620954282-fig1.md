caption: 'Representation of the reciprocal links between cancer and thrombosis. Tumor
  cells can express procoagulant factors, such as tissue factor (TF), that trigger
  the cascade of coagulation, which would be suppressed by mechanisms that induce
  endothelial tissue factor pathway inhibitors (TFPI). Tumor cells interact with endothelial
  cells, platelets, and leukocytes and these interactions induce inflammatory cytokines
  and pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Neutrophil
  attraction contributes to the accumulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
  and triggers adhesion, activation, and generation of thrombin. In general, the adherence
  of cancer to the endothelium causes the release of procoagulants and formation of
  thrombus, leading to CAT occurrence. TF also triggers the generation of factor VIIa,
  factor Xa, and thrombin (IIa), which activate platelets and induce protease-activated
  receptor-mediated signaling. The plasminogen activator (PA) system is expressed
  on platelets and it consists of plasminogen activators: urokinase plasminogen activator
  (uPA), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), cell membrane receptor for uPA (uPAR),
  and the plasminogen activator inhibitors plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)
  and plasmin. The PA system has an effect on cell adhesion and migration, which is
  particularly important in cancer progression. Also, TF suppress vasculoprotective
  molecules, such as thrombomodulin (TM). Release of von willebrand factor (VWF) promotes
  recruitment, adhesion, and activation of platelets and leukocytes with formation
  of NETs. abbreviations: APC, activated protein C; GAGS, glycosaminoglycans heparin

    Tumor cells can express procoagulant factors, such as tissue factor (TF), that

    TF also triggers the generation of factor VIIa, factor Xa, and thrombin (IIa),
