caption: Schematic representation of acyl-CoA-dependent and acyl-CoA-independent pathways
  for TAG biosynthesis in plants. The Kennedy pathway involving acyl-CoA-dependent
  acyltransferases (GPAT, LPAT, and DGAT) includes an intervening PA intermediate
  that is hydrolyzed by PAP to form DAG. Two DGAT classes operate in plant TAG synthesis,
  and the relative contribution may be dependent upon the plant species and the specific
  types of FAs stored in TAG. Labeling studies of soybeans indicate that much of the
  newly synthesized FA supplied from the plastids rapidly enters an acyl-CoA pool
  that is incorporated into PC by acyl-editing reactions presumably via LPCAT. Acyl
  groups are desaturated or modified (e.g. hydroxylation) while esterified to PC and
  then released back to the acyl-CoA pool, where they may co-mingle with newly synthesized
  acyl-CoAs and are incorporated into glycerolipids by Kennedy pathway enzymes on
  a slower time course. The rapidly labeled PC pool is used to generate DAG (and vice
  versa) via PDCT (or CPT). TAG also can be synthesized from DAG and PC by PDAT, yielding
  lyso-PC, which can be reacylated to form PC. Net synthesis of PC from DAG is accomplished
  by CPT. PC can be hydrolyzed to PA by phospholipase D (PLD) or to DAG by phospholipase
  C (PLC; not shown) for TAG synthesis. This diagram does not account for separate
  pools of intermediates, which are likely. The relative contribution and combination
  of these alternative pathways to the overall flux to TAG in plants are tissue- and
  species-specific. Cho, choline; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lyso-PC; PLA, phospholipase
  A.
