caption: 'Proposed 3-bromopyruvate mechanism of action: (1) 3-bromopyruvate enters
  cells through MCTs (mono-carboxylate transporters), which are overexpressed in many
  cancer cells. (2) Following 3-BP entrance the molecule reacts with cysteine residues
  of proteins, leading to loss of tertiary structure and function []. 3-BP reacts
  with glycolysis enzymes hexokinase 2 (HKII) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH), leading to depletion of ATP. Moreover, 3-BP inhibits succinate dehydrogenase
  (SDH), respiratory complex II, which oxidizes succinate to fumarate (3) [], which
  can lead to disruption of ATP synthesis and the electron transport chain causing
  electron leakage and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (4) [,]. 3-BP reacts
  with the cysteine moiety in glutathione (GSH) (4), the main ROS scavenger, leading
  to its depletion and increase of ROS levels (5) [,]. In addition, 3-BP can cause
  inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) due to hindrance of glucose-6-phosphate
  formation (6), which in turn can lead to a fall in NADPH and further GSH depletion.
  dNTP levels could be decreased and PPP is a major source of dNTP precursors (7)
  []. ROS can enter the nucleus and cause oxidation of DNA bases and DNA breaks (8)
  []. DNA damage can be exacerbated by smaller dNTP pools, which are crucial for DNA
  repair and cell survival [,].'
