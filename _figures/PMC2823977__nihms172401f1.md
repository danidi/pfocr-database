caption: 'Death receptor extrinsic pathway. The major death receptor pathways include
  Fas/FasL, TNF-R1/TNFα, and TRAIL-R1/TRAIL. Binding of ligands to respective receptors
  activates downstream signaling and the formation of death-inducing signaling complex.
  Activation of the NF-κB survival pathway enhances transcription of the anti-apoptotic
  proteins like FLIPL or MnSOD and apoptosis blockade. At high ROS and failure to
  activate NF-κB promotes ASK1/JNK activation that triggers cell apoptosis. Death
  receptor signaling is associated with caspase-8 activation that promotes apoptosis
  via activation of effector caspases (e.g. caspase-3) or engages mitochondrial apoptotic
  signaling via truncated Bid, leading to the release of apoptogenic factors such
  as cytochrome c into the cytosol. ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; Apaf-1:
  apoptotic protease-activating factor-1; Bid, BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein; tBid,
  truncated form of Bid; casp 8, 9, active forms of caspases-8 and -9; cyt c: cytochrome
  c; FLIPL: FLICE inhibitory protein; FADD: Fas-associated death domain; FasL: Fas
  ligand; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NF-κB: nuclear transcription factor kappa
  B; I B/NF-κB: the inactive form of NF-κB associated with its inhibitor; MnSOD: manganese

  ligand; TRAIL-R1: Trail receptor-1; TRADD: TNF receptor-associated death domain;
  TRAF-2: TNF receptor-associated factor-2.Mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. Various
  apoptotic stimuli (e.g. ROS) mediate permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer
  membrane and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins. Within the cytosol, cytochrome
  c together with Apaf-1, and dATP form the apoptosome complex to which the initiator
  procaspase-9 is recruited and activated. Caspase-9-catalyzed activation of the effector
  caspase-3 executes the final steps of apoptosis. Caspase activation is further enhanced
  through neutralization of caspase inhibitors by apoptogenic proteins like Smac/Diablo
  and Omi/HtrA2 that are released from the mitochondria. In addition, mitochondrial
  proteins such as AIF and endoG promote caspase-independent apoptosis through nuclear
  translocation and mediating genomic DNA fragmentation. Cyt c: cytochrome c; casp
  9: activated caspase-9; Apaf-1: apoptotic protease activation factor-1; Smac/Diablo,
  second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein of
  low pI; Omi/HtrA2: high temperature requirement A2 serine protease; IAP: inhibitors
  of apoptosis proteins; AIF: apoptosis inducing factor; endoG, endonuclease G; Bax/Bak,
  pro-apoptotic proteins.'
