caption: Proposed model of the molecular and cellular responses to new replication
  stress inhibitors. ATR/CHK1 stabilizes replication forks and prevents their collapse
  into DSBs. SSBs can be accurately repaired using the undamaged strand as a template,
  a process involving the PARP enzyme. SSBs are mainly repaired through the homologous
  recombination (HR) pathway. BRCA is related to the error-free repair of DSBs by
  HR. ATRi or CHK1i in monotherapy and in combined treatment with PARPi cause genome
  instability and leads to the synthetic lethality of ovarian cancer cells.
