caption: 'Cannabinoid synthesis pathway. The three-step biochemical pathway that produces
  the medically important cannabinoids in the trichomes of C. sativa flowers. Each
  enzymatic step is labelled with a number: 1) olivetolic acid synthase produces olivetolic
  acid; 2) olivetolate geranyltransferase produces CBGA; 3) THCA synthase, CBDA synthase
  and CBCA synthase produce THCA, CBDA or CBCA, respectively. The compounds are transformed
  to their neutral form (THC, CBD and CBC) with heat in a non-enzymatic conversion.
