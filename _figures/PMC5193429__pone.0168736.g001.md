caption: (A) Drawing representing the developmental steps of flower development in
  saffron. At the beginning of September, one or more shoots emerge from the underground
  corm with the undeveloped flowers and leaves wrapped by the cataphylls, as flower
  develops the cataphyll grows protecting the flower up to the moment of shot emergence
  from the soil, which takes place during October-November, when the flower is complete
  developed. (B) Schematic representation of the apocarotenoid biosynthetic pathway
  in saffron stigma. Enzymatic reactions are represented by arrows. GGPP, geranyl
  geranyl diphosphate; PSY, phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; ZDS, Ϛ-carotene
  desaturase; CRTISO, carotene isomerase; LCYβ, lycopene β-cyclase; βCH, β-carotene
  hydroxylase; HTCC, 2,6,6-trimethyl-4-hydroxy-1-carboxaldehyde-1-cyclohexene.
