caption: The mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis. Apoptosis (programmed cell death)
  via the mitochondrial or ‘intrinsic’ pathway is regulated by finely balanced interactions
  between members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. (A) In healthy cells, pro-survival
  BCL-2 proteins act as guardians of mitochondrial integrity to restrain the effector
  molecules BAX and BAK, either by sequestering them in heterodimeric complexes or
  preventing their activation by certain initiator BH3-only proteins (A and B). In
  response to apoptotic stimuli, BH3-only proteins become up-regulated or activated
  and overwhelm the pro-survival proteins. This allows for BAX/BAK activation by certain
  BH3-only proteins and relieves BAX/BAK restraint by pro-survival proteins. Following
  a series of conformational changes in BAK/BAX, they oligomerize on the outer-mitochondrial
  membrane, leading to an irreversible step known as MOMP (C). When this occurs, cytochrome
  c is released into the cytosol (with other apoptotic factors) and together with
  Apaf-1 forms a structure known as the apoptosome that activates a cascade of proteolytic
  caspases which demolish the cell, leading to its death.
