caption: a. During a cognate interaction between APC and T cell, signaling through
  B7 costimulatory moleules and CD28 triggers local complement component production
  and release by both cells (~1000 fold more is produced by the APC) along with a
  transient downregulation of cell surface DAF and upregulation of C3aR/C5aR. These
  conditions favor the local, spontaneous, activation of complement by the alternative
  pathway. Consequently, local levels of C3a and C5a increase which stimulate both
  partners through their respective receptors. b. C3aR/C5aR signaling on both APC
  and T cells activates the AKT pathway by phosphorylation (among other pathways).
  AKT activation on the APC stimulates maturation, cytokine production, and B7 costimulatory
  molecule expression. AKT activation on the T cell directly promotes IFNγ secretion,
  reduces susceptibility to apoptosis, and promotes cell proliferation. In this manner,
  C3aR/C5aR stimulation directly and indirectly promotes T cell maturation with an
  expanded effector repertoire.
