caption: Possible routes of prostaglandin signaling in the induction of tumor angiogenesis.
  The experiments by Williams () suggest that COX-2 (and presumably prostaglandin
  synthesis) is required in the upstream stromal cells that provide VEGF to endothelial
  cells. Other investigators have found that COX-2 is required in the endothelial
  cells that will form the new blood vessels (downstream). Prostaglandins can exert
  their effects either through receptors on the cell surface, which are coupled to
  G proteins and various intracellular signaling pathways, or by the nuclear transcription
  factors (peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors). The routes through which
  prostaglandins act in this pathway are not known, but several possibilities are
  shown. In paracrine signaling, exogenous but locally produced prostaglandins (PG)
  act on the stromal cell to induce VEGF expression. Autocrine signaling differs in
  that the prostaglandins are produced in stromal cells and are secreted and act on
  receptors (blue) on the surface of these same cells. In intracrine signaling, prostaglandins
  also act on the producing cell, but they do so prior to being secreted. Similar
  events not shown here could occur in the downstream endothelial cell as well.
