caption: Monocytes represent a window between bone marrow and tissues. Blood monocytes
  are circulating intermediates between haematopoiesis in bone marrow and recruitment
  to tissues in response to turnover of resident macrophages of embryonic origin,
  and to increased demands following tissue inflammation, infection and malignancy.
  The CSF1 Receptor is a pan-monocyte marker expressed by all subsets of monocytes
  defined by CD14, CD16 and DCs, lacking both of these antigen markers. Together with
  CSF2R and CSF3R, these three lineage differentiation markers enable identification
  of distinct streams of monocytic, granulocytic and Dendritic cell types of monocyte
  differentiation. In response to the prototypic TH1 or TH2 cytokines, IFNγ and Interleukin
  4/13, monocytes are polarized to distinct M1-like, classically activated, and M2-like,
  alternatively activated macrophages. Each becomes fully activated by further local
  phagocytic stimulation by microbes and apoptotic cells, respectively. CD40 and CD64
  are M1-like markers, where CD40 is for detecting TLR4 pathway and CD64 is for detecting
  IFNγ activation, while CD200R is an M2-like marker. Other markers can be introduced
  as required.
