caption: 'After cardiomyocytes are subjected to pathogenic stimulation, the TLR4 signaling
  pathway is activated to promote the secretion of chemokines and DAMPs, in which
  the upregulated expression of MCP-1 and ICAM-1 mediates the migration of macrophages
  and T cells from the circulation to the heart. Immune cells infiltrating the heart
  release inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which promote the
  development of cardiac hypertrophy. Meanwhile, resident macrophages and fibroblasts
  are also activated by DAMPs and release inflammatory cytokines in the early stage
  of inflammation. As the inflammation enters the late stage, cardiac fibroblasts
  differentiate into cardiac myofibroblasts, mediating cardiac repair and fibrosis.
  Importantly, cardiac fibroblasts and immune cells communicate with each other to
  regulate pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. Abbreviations: TLR4, Toll-like
  receptor 4; DAMPs, Damaged associated molecular patterns; MCP-1, Monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1; ICAM-1, Intercellular adhesion molecule-1; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis factor-α;
  IL-1β, Interleukin-1β; IL-6, Interleukin-6.'
