caption: Based on inhibitor studies, a model for the activation of CNT2 transporter
  function triggered by TCA is shown. The inhibitors used to generate the data shown
  in  are also included, as well as their targets, thus defining the transduction
  pathway implicated in this response. TCA treatment increases the abundance of CNT2
  at the plasma membrane. From the in vivo tagged-CNT2 assays shown in (C), it is
  deduced that CNT2 translocation is increased. It is likely that, as in the case
  of BSEP translocation into the apical membrane, TCA transport into cells is required.
  Nevertheless, Fao cells which are highly responsive to TCA treatment, do not express
  the major bile acid transporter NTCP, although there is evidence of transporter-mediated
  TCA uptake, which may be mediated by OATP (organic anion transporter polypeptide)
  transporters (results not shown). For this reason the molecular identity of the
  TCA carrier protein has been omitted.
