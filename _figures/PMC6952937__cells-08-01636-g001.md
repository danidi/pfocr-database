caption: Two different NF-κB signaling pathways. The classical (canonical) pathway
  (left) is activated by a large number of agonists, such as TNF-α, IL-1, lipopolysaccharide,
  and T cell receptors. The activation of this pathway depends on the IκB kinase (IKK)
  complex (IKKEMO), which phosphorylates IκBα (Ser32, 36) to induce rapid degradation.
  This pathway is essential for immune responses, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and
  cell survival. The alternative (noncanonical) pathway (right) is activated by a
  limited number of agonists, which are involved in secondary lymphoid organogenesis,
  mature B cell function, and adaptive immunity. This pathway requires NIK and IKKα,
  which induce the slow processing of p100 to generate p52, resulting in the dimerization
  and activation of the p52/RelB heterodimer. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)
  activates both classical and alternative pathways.
