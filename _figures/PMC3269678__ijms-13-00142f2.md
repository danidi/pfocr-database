caption: Signaling pathways leading to transcription factors activation in response
  to UV-radiation. UV-induced Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation depends
  on phosphorylation of IκBα by Casein Kinase II (CK2) through the activation of p38-MAP
  kinase. Phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκBα releases NF-κB subunits RelA/p50,
  which enter into nucleus to activate gene transcription of targets genes. UV-induced
  phosphorylation of Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2α (eIF2α) inhibits
  de novo IκBα translation, whereas the existing IκBα is degraded, leading to NF-κB
  activation. The chemopreventive inhibition of NF-κB by natural compounds parthenolide
  and magnolol, as well as p38 blocking by (−)-Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) is
  depicted. In AP-1 pathway, UV-induced activation of membrane receptors leads to
  the activation of MEKK, c-Jun NH2-Terminal Kinases (JNK), and p38. MAPKs phosphorylate
  transcription factors leading to increased expression of AP-1. In Nrf2 pathway,
  Nrf2 acts as a sensor for oxidative and electrophilic stress. In these conditions,
  phase 2 inducers cause the modification of Keap1 and/or phosphorylation of Nrf2
  resulting in the release of Nrf2 from Keap1. Nrf2 is stabilized and translocate
  to the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with MAF proteins, to bind to the antioxidant
  responsive element which leads to activation of cytoprotective genes.
