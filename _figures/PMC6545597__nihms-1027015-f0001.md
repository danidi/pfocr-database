caption: A proposed model showing the interactions of Nm23-H1 with cellular pathways.
  The depicted tumor cell is polarized and moving upwards in response to a chemoattractant,
  while still maintaining a cell–cell interaction to a stromal cell below it. a The
  leading edge of the cell showing a representation of the focal adhesion structure,
  including pathways involved in cell motility that could be modulated by Nm23-H1
  as shown in b. The leading edge is driven by actin polymerization-mediated protrusions
  that point in the direction of cell movement. The JNK, Rho, and Map kinase pathways
  are involved in cell signaling inducing motility towards an external stimulus. b
  Depiction of the trailing edge of the cell showing a link between Nm23-H1 anti-motility
  properties and the regulatory effect on its described binding partners. Motility-associated
  pathways can be inhibited by the interaction of their constituents to Nm23-H1. The
  binding of Nm23-H1 to Dbl1 can modulate the Rho pathway, while Tiam1 binding can
  inhibit JNK and association with Ksr1 can regulate the Map kinase pathway. Nm23-H2
  can interact with Icap-1α inhibiting its association with the FAK complex. c Cell–cell
  interaction between the polarized cell and another nearby stromal cell. Nm23-H1
  can bind to Vimentin, leading to a localized thickening of the intermediate filaments.
  In addition, it can bind to the Plakoglobin complex in the area of cell–cell contact
