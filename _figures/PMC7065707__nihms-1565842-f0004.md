caption: 'A decrease of CDK activity during neurogenic divisions enables the transactivation
  of proneural genes by a truncated form of Sox2 and Ngn2. Ngn2, in turn, inhibits
  the expression of G1 cyclins. A cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 stabilizes Ngn2, whereas
  p57Kip2 interacts with pro-neural factor Mash1 and represses its transcriptional
  activity. Rbl1 modulates the Notch pathway and affects the expression of its target
  genes. Abbreviations: NSC: neural stem cell.'
