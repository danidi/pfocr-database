caption: 'Functional inactivation of pRB has been shown to result in numerous changes,
  including transcriptional changes (local effects: regulation of specific transcriptional
  activators: E2F, etc; broad effects: regulation of heterochromatin formation, including
  telomeric and centromeric regions; and global effects: chromosome condensation and
  cohesion levels [purple box, top right]). Each of these defects in turn influence
  DNA replication, mitotic fidelity and the DNA damage response machinery through
  the transcriptional regulation of important players (yellow and green Boxes; DNA
  damage represented by yellow lightning bolt). In addition, transcription-independent
  interactions of pRB with components of many of these pathways have been identified,
  raising the possibility that pRB’s influence on these downstream processes may be
  independent of its role in transcription (yellow and green Boxes). Importantly,
  defects in each of these cellular processes have been shown to result in genomic
  instability. In addition, pRB loss has been implicated in tolerance of aneuploidy,
  thereby allowing the propagation of these newly aneuploid cells. The molecular mechanisms
  behind many of these effects remain unclear and the complex interplay between different
  effectors of pRB loss makes it difficult to tease apart functional relevance. The
  importance of individual effects of pRB inactivation under different cellular contexts
  may in part explain the varying degree of genomic instability seen in tumors possessing
  pRB pathway lesions.'
