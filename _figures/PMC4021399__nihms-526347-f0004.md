caption: MiRNAs such as miR-375 and miR-223 are produced in peripheral tissues and
  incorporated in exosomes through a mechanism controlled by nSMase2, the rate limiting
  enzyme in ceramide biosynthesis, and transported in the blood. Some miRNAs are also
  bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDL), incorporation of microRNAs into HDL is
  controlled by the cholesterol transporter ABCA and by nSMase. Uptake of RNA and
  miRNAs from exosomes in target cells does not require binding to a specific receptor.
  MiRNAs associated with HDL are thought to be trafficked to the liver through the
  reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway and taken up by a scavenger receptor
  B I-dependent mechanism. Once inside target cells, miRNAs can then exert inhibitory
  effects on a range of target genes.
