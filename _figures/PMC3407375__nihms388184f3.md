caption: Signaling loops initiated by TGF-β accelerate downstream action and effects
  via miRNAs. A) TGF-β increases miR-192 expression via Smad3 or p53. TGF-β1 gene
  expression is itself auto-upregulated by miR-192 through Zeb1/2. B) miR-192 enhances
  p53 levels via inhibition of Mdm2 (inhibitor of p53). p53 increases transcription
  of miR-192 through p53 responsive elements on the promoter. C) miR-200 family members
  can further augment their own expression through inhibition of Zeb1/2. Initial expression
  of miR-200 family can also be induced by miR-192 through Zeb1/2. D) The promoter
  of the non-coding RNA RP23 (the host gene of miR-216a and miR-217) also contains
  E-boxes  and increased miR-216a also activates its own promoter through Tsc-22 and
  Tfe3. miR-216a/Ybx1 pathway can amplify the signaling initiated by TGF-β and miR-192.
