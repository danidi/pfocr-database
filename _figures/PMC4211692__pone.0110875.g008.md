caption: Glucolipotoxicity impairs CERT- and vesicular-mediated Cer traffic. Glucolipotoxicity
  decrease the amount of active CERT significantly decreasing a) the total amount
  of the protein and b) the phosphorylation of CERT SR motif that is no longer able
  to localize at the Golgi apparatus. Moreover glucolipotoxicity inhibits PI3K/Akt
  pathway that could in turn impairs vesicular trafficking of Cer from the ER to the
  Golgi apparatus. Both transport systems contribute to the accumulation of Cer at
  the ER, thereby inducing ER stress. Furthermore ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4)  and
  serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) , , both residing in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), have been shown to be involved in regulating Cer levels in β-cells in response
  to lipotoxicity and/or glucolipotoxicity.
