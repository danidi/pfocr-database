caption: Canonical Wnt signaling through Disheveled (Dis) and APR-1 (APC ortholog)
  regulates the β-catenin BAR-1. In the absence of Wnt, APR-1 is active and inhibits
  BAR-1. In the presence of Wnt, APR-1 is inhibited and BAR-1 activity is increased.
  Higher levels of BAR-1 lead to increased nuclear import and activation of the transcription
  factor POP-1 (TCF/LEF). We have shown that RPM-1 binds to ANC-1, and RPM-1 and ANC-1
  function in the same pathway to positively regulate BAR-1 activity. RPM-1 and ANC-1
  are likely to function in a protein complex at the nuclear envelope to regulate
  BAR-1 nuclear levels by inhibition of EMR-1. Canonical Wnt signaling is likely to
  act coordinately with RPM-1 and ANC-1 to regulate BAR-1 activity.
