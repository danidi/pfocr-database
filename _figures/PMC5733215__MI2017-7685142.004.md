caption: STAT3/S1P/S1PR1/SPHK1/SPL-positive feed-forward loop promoting CAC. In a
  chronic inflammatory milieu, STAT3 is persistently activated through two pathways.
  (1) SphK1 produces S1P which when kept intracellular can activate the NFκB pathway
  leading to increased expression of SPHK1. (2) When S1P is exported out of the cells
  via the SPNS2 transporter, the binding of S1P to its S1PR1 activates STAT3. STAT3
  upregulates IL-6 and S1PR1 expression as well as miR-181b1 and miR-21. miR-181b1
  decreases the expression of the tumor-suppressor CYLD which results in derepression
  of the NFκB pathway. miR-21 decreases the expression of PTEN which is an antioncogene
  negatively regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway and positively p53. All these pathways
  are interrelated in an amplification loop, permitting the persistent STAT3 activation,
  which is involved in cell transformation and tumor progression. Bent arrows indicate
  transcriptional regulation.
