caption: Striatal regulation of cGMP signaling in direct and indirect pathway MSNs.
  The generation of NO from NOS+ interneurons is dependent upon both D1-like receptors
  and glutamate acting on AMPA receptors while the concentration of cGMP in MSN is
  regulated by phosphodiesterase activities including PDE10A. Not shown are the cholinergic
  interneurons which also play a role in this regulation.
