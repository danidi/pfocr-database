caption: Tau modulates Fyn kinase pathways in myelinating oligodendrocytes. Myelination
  requires the outgrowth of oligodendrocyte processes and the formation of contact
  points between oligodendrocytes and axons. For this to occur, the mRNA of the myelin
  basic protein (MBP) needs to be targeted to those contact points. Tau acts as a
  scaffold protein linking Fyn kinase to the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton of oligodendrocyte
  processes. Upon establishment of contact points at the neuron-glia interface, a
  signaling cascade involving tau and Fyn kinase is activated. That signaling pathway
  culminates into the rearrangement of the cell cytoskeleton that leads MBP mRNA to
  myelination sites and promotes the growth of oligodendrocyte processes.
