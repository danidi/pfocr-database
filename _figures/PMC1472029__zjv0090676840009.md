caption: Scheme of trafficking pathways used by PyV for the movement towards the cell
  nucleus. Virions are internalized through lipid raft domains into smooth, often
  caveolin-positive, monopinocytic vesicles. These vesicles then fuse with early endosomes,
  and endosomal acidic pH is (in contrast to SV40) necessary for efficient PyV trafficking.
  Virus uptake is accompanied with protein tyrosine kinase signaling (our unpublished
  observation) and with a transient reorganization of the actin network (). Further
  movement of the virus is directed into the recycling endosomes, as we proved by
  FRET between PyV VP1 and transferrin or between PyV VP1 and Rab11 GTPase. Significant
  colocalization of VP1 with the BiP marker was observed previously () and suggests
  that PyV can be transported to the ER. However, in contrast to cholera toxin, or
  to SV40, the PyV route into the ER is independent of COPI vesicles (). We also detected
  direct fusions of virus-carrying monopinocytic vesicles with the ER on ultrathin
  cell sections (); therefore, both routes to the ER (the one from recycling endosomes
  and the direct one from monopinocytic vesicles) are considered alternative routes.
  The possibility that “successful” virions escape from early endosomes into the cytosol
  (as a result of conformation changes induced by acidic pH) still cannot be ruled
  out. The trafficking pathway leading to the ER via recycling endosomes would then
  represent a cell defense mechanism. We have shown previously () that only a few
  viral genomes reach the nucleus, while a substantial amount is directed to the ER-associated
  degradation pathway. It is conceivable that PyV misuses this pathway, like some
  bacterial toxins (), counting upon an escape of several viral genomes into the nucleus
  prior to their degradation in the cytoplasm. Black arrows, experimentally proved
  routes; dotted arrows, possible alternative routes. NPC, nuclear pore complex.
