caption: The metabolism of PUFAs by LOX enzymes leads to the formation of leukotrienes
  and hydroxyl fatty acids (). The LOX pathway in cancer is more complicated as there
  are multiple isoforms of LOX enzymes. It is generally believed that 5-LOX and 12-LOX
  and their metabolites promote cancer, while 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 have anti-tumor
  effects, , . 5-HETE, a 5-LOX metabolite of ARA, has been shown to induce angiogenesis,
  inflammation, and tumor progression. Pharmacological inhibitors of the 5-LOX enzyme
  have been shown to suppress tumor progression in animal models. Since both COX-2
  and 5-LOX are up-regulated in tumor tissues, dual inhibition of COX-2 and 5-LOX
  has been shown to cause enhanced anti-tumor effect, .
