caption: Schematic overview of the intestinal trafficking machinery. Schematics of
  polarized mouse enterocytes showing their cell features, cytoskeletal organization
  and trafficking routes. The apical surface is uppermost. (A) Apically and basolaterally
  destined proteins follow different pathways (denoted by arrows) to reach their target
  membrane. The biosynthetic route (route 1) is indicated in black line, the transcytotic
  route (route 2) in dashed line, and the recycling pathway (route 3) in dotted line.
  (B) Vesicle transport is mediated by the cytoskeleton. Long-distance transport occurs
  along microtubules, and is mediated by kinesin and dynein motor proteins. Short-distance
  transport occurs along actin filaments of the terminal web and is mediated by motor
  proteins of the myosin family.
