caption: PGE2 synthesis, action, transport and metabolism in granulosa cells. PGE2
  is synthesized by the enzymes PLA2G4A, PTGS2, and PTGES which are associated with
  intracellular membranes including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intermediates
  in PGE2 synthesis include arachidonic acid (AA) and PGH2. Functional PGE2 receptors
  (PTGERs) can be located in the plasma membrane or nuclear envelope, so both intracellular
  and extracellular PGE2 can bind to receptors and initiate signal transduction. PGE2
  can exit and enter a cell via passive diffusion through the plasma membrane or facilitated
  diffusion via transporters such as SLCO2A1 and MRP4. Bioactive PGE2 is converted
  to the inactive PGE metabolite 15-keto-PGE2 through the activity of the cytoplasmic
  enzyme HPGD.
