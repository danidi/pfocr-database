caption: Speculated biosynthesis pathways of glycosylated products elongated on a
  saccharide primer. The biosynthesis is initiated with galactosylation on the Xyl.
  The disaccharide is phosphorylated for GAG-type oligosaccharide biosynthesis. The
  phosphorylated disaccharide is used as an intermediate of the GAG biosynthetic pathway.
  Dephosphorylation can occur during both GlcA addition on the phosphorylated trisaccharide
  and GalNAc addition on the phosphorylated tetrasaccharide. The phosphorylated trisaccharide
  can be modified by α2-6-linked NeuAc for sialyl GAG synthesis. Without the Xyl phosphorylation,
  the disaccharide can be capped by α2-3-linked NeuAc. Gal, HexA, and HexNAc residues
  can be sulfated during the biosynthesis.
