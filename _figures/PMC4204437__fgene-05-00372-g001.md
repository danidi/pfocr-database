caption: Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins implicated in interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair.
  Cartoon schematic of the FA proteins implicated in the ICL repair pathway. The integrity
  of the core complex is required for FANCD2/FANCI monoubiquitination, a key activation
  step of the FA pathway. ERCC1-XPF is the nuclease implicated in ICL processing.
  FANCJ and certain other FA proteins are not required for FANCD2/FANCI monoubiquitination,
  and are therefore implicated in downstream events of the FA pathway, such as homologous
  recombination (HR) repair of the processed ICL.
