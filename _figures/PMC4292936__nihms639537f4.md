caption: Working hypothetical model showing how BRCA1/1a binding to Ubc9 regulates
  caveolin-1 expression and function in normal ovaries. In SEOC with BRCA1 dysfunction,
  Ubc9 is unleashed which inhibits caveolin-1 expression causing loss of DNA repair,
  lipid trafficking, cellular signaling, endothelial and mitochondrial function resulting
  in SEOC.
