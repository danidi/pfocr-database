caption: A simplified view of the InsP synthesis and degradation pathway. InsP synthesis
  starts in the Loewus Pathway (tan), where InsP is synthesized from Glucose-6-Phosphate
  (G6P). InsPs are synthesized through the Lipid-Dependent (pink) or Lipid-Independent
  (yellow) pathways. PP-InsPs in plants are synthesized from InsP6 (purple). The enzymes
  involved in the pathway are discussed throughout the review.
