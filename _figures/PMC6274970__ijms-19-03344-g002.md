caption: There are several potential alterations in cellular metabolism and signaling
  as a consequence of dysregulated AMPK-glycogen physical and functional interactions
  that represent key knowledge gaps in our current understanding and warrant further
  investigation in future studies. These potential alterations include changes in
  AMPK localization, translocation, substrates, and signaling pathway crosstalk, and
  subsequently, alterations in gene expression, cellular metabolism and glycogen storage.
