caption: NB enhances the cellular uptake of SeC, which subsequently augmented intracellular
  ROS generation and DSBs. DNA damage activates p53 pathway, which causes mitochondrial
  dysfunction by regulating the expression levels of Bcl-2 family members. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction results in release of apoptogenic factors into cytosol, and then activates
  several caspase cascades, and finally leads to cell apoptosis. In addition, as a
  functional loop, ROS produced in mitochondria promotes the phosphorylation of p38MAPK
  and inactivation of Akt and ERK, which enhances the p53 activation and potentiates
  the apoptotic cascade.
