caption: UPR signaling in diseases. Pathophysiological conditions such as hypoxia,
  elevated levels of fatty acids or cholesterol, oxidative stress, high or low glucose
  levels, and inflammatory cytokines induce ER stress and activate the UPR chronically.
  UPR signaling is interconnected with oxidative stress and inflammatory response
  pathways and involved in a variety of diseases including metabolic disease, inflammatory
  disease, and cancer. The three arms of the UPR, IRE1α-XBP1s, PERK-eIF2α phosphorylation-ATF4,
  and ATF6 are important for tumor cell survival and growth under hypoxic conditions.
  The UPR, IRE1α, and PERK can activate c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NFκB to
  promote inflammation and apoptosis that contribute to inflammation in obesity and
  pancreatic β-cell death in diabetes. In addition, CHOP production in the PERK pathway
  exacerbates oxidative stress in diabetic states and atherosclerosis to aggravate
  the diseases.
