caption: Illustration of fluxes in central carbon metabolism for metabolic phases
  II and III along the protein/ tradeoff. bna572 was simulated with flux projections
  into the lumped network. Arrows denote the direction of flux (not reaction directionality).
  Lumping of metabolites is indicated by indices c, p, m, and x. For example, F6P/G6Pcp
  unifies the metabolites Fru-6- and Gly-6- in cytosol (c) and plastid (p). Two major
  ways Gln can be transformed into oxaloacetate/malate are highlighted in gray. PPP,
  reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway; Protc, protein. For further abbreviations,
  see  legend.
