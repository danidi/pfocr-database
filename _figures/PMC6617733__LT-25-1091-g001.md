caption: Distinct molecular and morphologic features of apoptotic, necroptotic, and
  necrotic cell death. (A) Molecular pathways of cell death in PLCs. The binding of
  TNF‐α and TNFR1 recruits TRADD, TRAF2, RIPK1, cIAP1/2, and LUBAC and forms the complex
  I leading to the activation of the NF‐κB signaling and a prosurvival pathway. Following
  the dissociation from TNFR1, complex I is transformed into complex IIa, which includes
  TRADD, FADD, FLIPs, and procaspase 8, and contributes to the activation of caspase
  8 and subsequent RIPK1‐independent apoptosis. Hyperactivation of cylindromatosis
  (CYLD) deubiquitinates RIPK1 and thus destabilizes complex I and promotes the formation
  of complex IIb, which is involved in RIPK1‐dependent apoptosis. Complex IIb consists
  of RIPK1, RIPK3, FADD, FLIPs, and caspase 8, and it can be promoted by inhibition
  of NEMO, cIAPs, or TAK1. Nevertheless, once caspase 8 is inhibited, RIPK3 is activated
  to interact with RIPK1 and binds to MLKL, forming the complex IIc (necrosome) by
  which necroptosis is promoted. RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL in the complex IIc and
  thereby triggers oligomerization of MLKL, driving the permeabilization step. Nonprogrammed
  cell death by necrosis is characterized by mitochondrial impairment with resulting
  ATP depletion and triggering of the ROS‐JNK loop. After the cell membrane ruptures
  in necrotic or necroptotic cells, intracellular DAMPs are released and act as activators
  and amplifiers of necroinflammation. Conversely, release of a lower amount of DAMPs
  from apoptotic cells leads to much milder necroinflammation. (B) Summary of hallmark
  events and characteristics of cell survival and cell death by apoptosis, necroptosis,
  or necrosis.
