caption: 'Membrane receptors and intracellular signaling pathways activated by IL-4
  and/or IL-13. IL-4 and IL-13 exert their biological actions by activating a heterodimeric
  receptor complex consisting of the IL-4 receptor α-subunit (IL-4Rα) and the IL-13
  receptor α1-subunit (IL-13Rα1).Note: Binding of IL-13 to IL-13Rα1 induces heterodimerization
  with IL-4Rα. This dimerization, which can also be triggered by IL-4, activates JAK1/2
  and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases, that are responsible for phosphorylation of STAT-6. Phosphorylated
  STAT-6 dimerizes and migrates from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it binds to
  the promoter regions of IL-4/IL-13-responsive genes. IL-13 can also bind to its
  receptor α2-chain (IL-13Rα2), which is not coupled to any dimerization mechanism
  or intracellular signaling pathway. The receptor/signaling complex constituted by
  IL-4Rα and γC chains, associated with JAK1/3 kinases, can be activated only by IL-4,
  but not by IL-13.Abbreviations: IL, interleukin; JAK, Janus kinase; P, phosphorylation;
  STAT6, signal transducer and activator of transcription 6; Tik2, tyrosine kinase
