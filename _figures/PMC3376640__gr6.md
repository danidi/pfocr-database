caption: Proposed Model of Psoriasis Pathogenesis in the Presence of Psoriasis-Specific
  CARD14 AlterationsAfter an inflammatory trigger, alterations in CARD14 induce activation
  of NF-kB. This leads to the transcription of many genes, including key chemokines
  such as CCL20, IL8, and IL36G, implicated in psoriasis. The proteins encoded by
  these transcripts can recruit immune cells involved in disease pathogenesis. Those
  cells, in turn, produce cytokines and chemokines that cause inflammation and lead
  to further keratinocyte activation and epidermal hyperplasia (see ). Other proteins
  in the NF-kB pathway have been previously implicated in psoriasis and might be important
  in CARD14 signaling to NF-kB. These proteins include A20, TNIP1, and Act1, and these,
  in turn, implicate TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6. IL36RN, recently found to be mutated
  in pustular psoriasis, might also play a role in this pathway by inhibiting IL36γ-induced
  immune cell activation. All of these events contribute to this vicious cycle of
  inflammation and acanthosis seen in psoriasis.
