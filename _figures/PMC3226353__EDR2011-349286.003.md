caption: Adenosine/L-arginine/nitric oxide (ALANO) signalling pathway in gestational
  diabetes mellitus. Human umbilical vein (macrovasculature) and placental microvascular
  endothelial cells exhibit increased (solid light-blue arrows) L-arginine transport
  via the cationic amino acid transporters 1 (hCAT-1) but reduced (segmented light-blue
  arrows) adenosine uptake via the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1).
  The latter phenomenon leads to accumulation (white up arrow) of adenosine in the
  extracellular space, which then stimulates A2A adenosine receptors to activate (dotted
  light-blue arrows) maximal transport capacity of hCAT-1 and maximal metabolic capacity
  of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) leading to supraphysiological levels
  of nitric oxide (NO) and L-citrulline. The gas NO activates hC/element-binding protein
  (CBP) homologous protein 10-C/EBPα transcription factor complex (CHOP) leading to
  repression of SLC29A1 gene expression resulting in reduced hENT1 protein synthesis
  and abundance at the plasma membrane. On the other hand, NO activates the transcription
  factor-specific protein 1 (Sp1) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) leading to increase
  transcription of SLC7A1 and NOS3 genes, respectively. This phenomenon results in
  higher abundance of hCAT-1 and eNOS protein increasing L-arginine transport and
  NO synthesis. From data in [, , , , , ].
