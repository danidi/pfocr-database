number: Fig. 6
caption: Aβ42 stimulates aberrant activation of the JNK pathway, which results in
  hyperphosphorylation of Itch at T222 and S232 by JNK (Fig. ). The phosphorylation
  at these sites promotes its autoubiquitination of Itch at K393 (Fig. e and f). These
  post-translational modifications induce TAp73–Itch interaction (Figs. d, e and ),
  which results in TAp73 ubiquitination (Fig. d, g) and degradation (Fig. ) and may
  affect the transcription of TAp73 target genes. Collectively, these events result
  in cell cycle re-entry and neuronal apoptosis (CRNA; Figs.  and ).
