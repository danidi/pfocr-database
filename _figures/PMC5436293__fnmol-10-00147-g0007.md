caption: Retrograde communication from myocytes to axon terminals through BDNF/TrkB
  signaling. (A) Graphical representation of BDNF signaling outcomes observed under
  presynaptic stimulation without muscle contraction and presynaptic stimulation with
  muscle contraction. Presynaptic activity (1) promotes cPKC phosphorylation and (2)
  increases BDNF levels. BDNF acts presynaptically through (3) TrkB/PLCγ/PKC pathway
  to complete the activation of pPKC and thus enhance synaptic vesicle fusion and
  ACh release. Once PKC have executed their action, they are typically degraded thus
  decreasing its protein levels. (B) Graphical representation of BDNF signaling outcomes
  observed under presynaptic stimulation with contraction. The presence of contraction
  (2) further increases BDNF protein levels and (4) decreases TrkB.T1 protein levels,
  ultimately increasing the ratio TrkB.FL/T1. Even though this ratio still enhances
  (3) cPKC activity and its subsequent degradation, it promotes the increase in total
  PKC protein levels (5). Presumably, this might be due to an increase in PKC synthesis
  or alternatively, to a decrease in their activity-induced degradation. Consequently,
  pPKC levels are enhanced. The influence of TrkB.FL/T1 ratio over cPKC in both conditions
  is demonstrated by the sequestering antibody 47/TrkB. Therefore, muscle contraction
  could modulate BDNF/TrkB signaling to promote a retrograde regulatory feedback from
  the myocyte that maintains the levels of presynaptic cPKC. This may have an impact
  in NMJ functionality since cPKCβI activity is required for acetycholine release.
