caption: T-DM1 exerts anti-tumour activity via at least three distinct mechanisms.
  As for trastuzumab, engagement of HER2 receptors by T-DM1 inhibits downstream signalling
  pathways (via RAS–mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] and phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase [PI3K]–AKT–mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]) and ectodomain shedding
  while also eliciting immune effector cell function (e.g. antibody-dependent cellular
  cytotoxicity) mediated via Fc receptors. T-DM1–HER2 complexes are also internalised
  via receptor-mediated endocytosis, after which endocytic vesicles mature through
  the endosomal pathway for ultimate delivery to lysosomes. Trastuzumab is proteolytically
  degraded in lysosomes, liberating lysine-MCC-DM1 for active transport into the cytoplasm,
  where it inhibits tubulin polymerisation resulting in failure of the mitotic spindle
  and ultimate mitotic catastrophe.
