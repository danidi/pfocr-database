caption: The role of the apicoplast in production of isoprenoid precursors, IPP and
  DMAPP, which are exported into the cytoplasm and used to synthesize small molecule
  isoprenoids and prenylated proteins. P. falciparum is unable to synthesize isoprenoid
  precursors either due to inhibition of the biosynthetic pathway by fosmidomycin
  or loss of the apicoplast following doxycycline inhibition which can be chemically
  rescued by addition of exogenous IPP. The exogenous IPP enters the host cell through
  unknown membrane transporters and fulfills the missing biosynthetic function [].
