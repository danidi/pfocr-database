caption: Fatty alcohols can be produced by expressing a fatty acyl-CoA reductase from
  Tyto alba (TaFAR). TaFAR was then introduced into matrix of peroxisome by tagging
  with PTS1 or PTS2 signals to convert shortened fatty acyl-CoAs to produce medium
  chain fatty alcohols. The peroxisomal membrane protein PEX5 and PEX7 was overexpressed
  to enhance the efficiency of cytosol TaFAR introduction. PEX3 and PEX19 were engineered
  to help the formation of peroxisomes. In addition, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1)
  and ATP-dependent citrate lyase (ACL) from Yarrowi lipolytica were overexpressed
  to enhance the supply of precursors in fatty acid synthesis.
