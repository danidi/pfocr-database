caption: Schematic representation of NR2B-mediated Epac1-Piezo2 signaling pathway
  possibly participating in the mechanical allodynia of BCP. In the mouse model of
  BCP, peripheral nociceptive stimulation leads to the activation of GPCRs in DRG
  neurons which triggers the conversion of ATP into cAMP. As an important second messenger,
  cAMP directly activates Epac1 protein and then regulates the activity of NR2B-containing
  NMDA receptors. Activated NMDA receptors cause a significant increase in [Ca2+]i
  through multiple ways, such as the directly influx of calcium ions, CICR and VGCC.
  Various calcium-dependent protein kinases (such as ERK or CaMK) may be subsequently
  activated. On the one hand, the synthesis of Piezo2 mRNA or protein is increased;
  on the other hand, phosphorylation of Piezo2 enhances its function which mediate
  large amount of cations influx. Based on these mechanisms, the excitability of neurons
  continues to escalate and ultimately increases the transmission of peripheral nociceptive
  signals to the center, which leads to the production and maintenance of mechanical
  hyperalgesia in BCP. GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; CICR, calcium-induced
  calcium release; VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel; ERK, extracellular-signal
  regulated kinase; CaMK, calmodulin-dependent kinase.
