caption: Stimuli responses of EET-related metabolic pathways of four abundantly shown
  Geobacteraceae OCSs. EET-related metabolic pathway map constructed by gene expression
  profiles of selected marker genes (refer to Supplementary Fig. ) in the OCS H1geo(pan)
  (a), H2/M4geo (b), L1/M1geo(pan) (c), and M3ppro (d). The operational variable-associated
  metabolic flows and electron (e-) flow are analyzed by the wCCA analysis (Supplementary
  Fig. -). Sucrose-consuming EET (Sucrose EET) pathway was shown by yellow arrows,
  acetate-consuming EET (Acetate EET) pathway was shown by red arrows, and open circuit
  responses were shown by blue arrows with the detailed description about OC responses
  for each OCS in the blue box. Genes coding MH-cytC proteins for EET reactions are
  shown as oval (Names are described inside)
