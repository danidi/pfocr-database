caption: The coagulation cascade related to xenotransplantation. (A) Coagulation cascade
  in primates. Black arrows designate cascade amplification steps. The coagulation
  cascade is initiated by tissue factor (TF) (extrinsic pathway) or negatively charged
  surface contact (intrinsic pathway). TF is expressed by vascular subendothelial
  cells. When endothelium is damaged, TF is exposed to the circulation and forms complexes
  with factor VIIa, activating factors V and X. Factor Xa converts prothrombin to
  thrombin. Thrombin then cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and activates factor
  XIII, which cross-links fibrin monomers into an insoluble clot. In response to shear
  stress, von Willebrand Factor (vWF) binds to glycoprotein 1b (GPIb) on platelets
  leading to platelet activation and adhesion (). Activated platelet bind to fibrinogen
  to mediate platelet aggregation and endothelial adherence. Red lines show the natural
  inhibitors of coagulation. (1) Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits the
  activation of factor Xa and formats TFPI/Xa, which subsequently inhibits the TF/VIIa
  complex. These processes consequently prevent the formation of thrombin (). (2)
  In the thrombomodulin (TBM)–protein C (PC) pathway, TBM serves as a cofactor in
  the thrombin-induced activation of PC. Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is
  a receptor for PC that enhances its activation. The activated PC (aPC), together
  with cofactor protein S (PS), suppressing factors Va and VIIIa, thereby downregulating
  thrombin formation and suppressing coagulation cascade (). (3) Soluble antithrombins
  (AT) inhibits factors XIa, IXa, Xa, VIIa, and thrombin by targeting serine proteases
  (). (B) Dysregulated coagulation in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation. Red and
  black arrows designate incompatibility between pig and primates. When pig endothelium
  is activated, pig TF is expressed and released into the circulation. After interaction
  with the pig endothelium, recipient platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  (PBMCs) express primate tissue factor (hTF). The porcine TF (pTF) pathway inhibitor
  is an ineffective inhibitor of the human Xa factor and may ineffectively shut down
  the activation of the major TF. Pig TBM (pTBM) binds only weakly to primate thrombin,
  leading to levels of activated PC that are insufficient to inhibit coagulation,
  resulting in thrombotic microangiopathy in pig grafts within a matter of weeks ().
  Porcine vWF spontaneously could aggregate primate platelets through GPIb receptors
  even in the absence of shear stress (). After aberrant porcine GPIb–primate vWF
  interaction, platelets are activated. Small vessels in the graft become occluded
  by fibrin and platelet aggregation.
