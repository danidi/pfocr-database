caption: Healthy T cells undergoing activation have high energy and biosynthetic needs.
  They upregulate glucose import and glycolysis, driving mitochondrial activity and
  ROS production. T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) prefer shunting
  of glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway, thus reducing mitochondrial ROS production
  and enhancing NADPH generation. The outcome is a reduction of ATP and an intracellular
  milieu depleted of ROS. ROS, reactive oxygen species; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
