caption: Sugar sensing and signaling in C. albicans. The sugar-sensing network in
  C. albicans. The faded arrows and proteins represent the situation when sugars are
  absent. All proteins are represented as circles. Activation is represented with
  green arrows, while red arrows indicate inhibition. The dashed lines represent the
  hypothesis. When the CaHgt4 receptor senses glucose, galactose, maltose, or fructose,
  CaYck2 phosphorylates CaStd1. This is subsequently ubiquitinated by CaGrr1 and broken
  down by the proteasome. In the absence of a carbon source, CaStd1 functions together
  with CaRgt1 to repress transcription of the CaHGT genes. The CaHgt transporters
  allow sugars to enter the cells. When glucose enters the cells, it is converted
  to pyruvate during glycolysis. In the presence of extracellular glucose, an active
  CaCdc25 allows the exchange of GDP to GTP on the CaRas proteins. CaRas is now activated
  and stimulates CaCyr1. Next to activation by CaRas, CaCyr1 needs the stimulus coming
  from CaGpr1 to be fully activated. CaGpr1 is activated by sensing extracellular
  molecules, presumably methionine or lactate, which allows the exchange of GDP to
  GTP on the CaGpa2 proteins. CaGpa2-GTP activates CaCyr1. ATP is converted into cAMP
  after complete activation of CaCyr1 by CaRas and by CaGpa2. cAMP binds to the regulatory
  subunits of PKA (CaBcy1) thereby causing them to release the catalytic subunits
  (CaTpk) causing PKA activation. When N-acetylglucosamine enters the cells via CaNgt1,
  it can be metabolized to fructose-6-phosphate by CaHxk1, CaDac1, and CaNag1. The
  hypothesis is that fructose-6-phosphate can be converted into galactose by the action
  of the CaGal enzymes. The galactose metabolism in C. albicans remains a mystery,
  but the expression of the CaGAL genes is found to be regulated by CaCph1 and CaRgt1.
  CaSnf1 can be phosphorylated by CaSak1 but no more in this pathway has been revealed.
