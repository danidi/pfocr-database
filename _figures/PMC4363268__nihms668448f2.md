caption: A schematic diagram illustrates important roles of NKCC-1 and NHE-1 in regulation
  of cancer cell survival and migration/invasion. In response to stimuli, WNKs/OSR1
  are major upstream regulators of NKCC1, while ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathway
  is involved in activation of NHE-1. NKCC-1 and NHE-1 mediate regulatory volume increase
  (RVI) to against apoptosis and promote cell survival. Direct interaction between
  ERM-NKCC-1 or ERM-NHE-1 contributes to cytoskeletal rearrangement which affects
  cell migration. Activation of NHE-1 not only leads to cytosolic alkalinization and
  inhibits apoptosis, but also increases cell migration/invasion by mediating extracellular
  acidification and stimulating release of MMPs.
