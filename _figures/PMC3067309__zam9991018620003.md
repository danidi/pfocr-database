caption: 'The reductive citric acid (Arnon-Buchanan) cycle as it functions in green
  sulfur bacteria (, ). The pathway of acetyl-CoA assimilation to pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP), and oxaloacetate is shown as well. For deviations from this variant of the
  cycle, see the text. Enzymes: 1, ATP-citrate lyase; 2, malate dehydrogenase; 3,
  fumarate hydratase; 4, fumarate reductase (natural electron donor is not known);
  5, succinyl-CoA synthetase; 6, ferredoxin (Fd)-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase;
  7, isocitrate dehydrogenase; 8, aconitate hydratase; 9, Fd-dependent pyruvate synthase;
  10, PEP synthase; 11, PEP carboxylase.'
