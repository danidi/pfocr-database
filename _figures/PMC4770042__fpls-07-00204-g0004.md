caption: 'Tentative anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway for S. littorea. The pathway
  is primarily linear with three side branches that produce the anthocyanin pigment
  cyanidin. Flavonoids detected by HPLC are indicated with asterisks. Enzymes not
  included in this study are indicated in gray. Enzyme abbreviations are indicated
  next to arrows: PAL, phenylalanil ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL,
  coumarate CoA ligase; CHS: chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3′H, flavonoid
  3′hydroxylase; FNS, flavone synthase; F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; UF3GT,
  flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase; AT, acyltransferase. The three gene regulatory
  complex consists of a basic Helix Loop Helix protein (bHLH), WD Repeats (WD40) and
  R2R3-MYB domains (MYB) in most angiosperms.'
