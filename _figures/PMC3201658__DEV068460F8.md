caption: Schematic model for sprouting angiogenesis. A proposed model for regulation
  of angiogenic sprouting based on this and previous studies. Our data showing endothelial-specific
  expression strongly suggest that the Rspo1-Wnt-Vegfc-Vegfr3 pathway functions in
  an endothelial-specific fashion. The diagram as drawn shows autocrine Rspo1 and
  paracrine Vegfc endothelial signaling, but we are not able to determine from the
  data presented in this manuscript whether signaling is autocrine, juxtacrine or
  both. However, the pan-endothelial (not tip- or stalk-restricted) expression of
  the components of this pathway suggests that it provides a permissive cue for angiogenesis,
  rather than a selective cue for tip cells. Other published studies have shown that
  Vegfa produced by surrounding tissue signals through Vegfr2 to induce Vegfr3 and
  Dll4 in the tip cell (; ). Supporting stalk cells express soluble Flt1 (sVegfr1)
  and Notch. sVegfr1 helps sharpen the concentration gradient of available Vegfa to
  direct sprouting (), whereas Dll4/Notch signaling limits the number of tip cells
  specified (; ; ). Notch limits Vegf receptor expression in stalk cells and Dll4
  suppresses Vegfr3 in the tip cell to inhibit hyperbranching (; ; ).
