caption: Lentivirus-mediated XPC silencing in normal human keratinocytes impairs DNA
  repair efficiency. To evade damaged base–induced cell-death apoptosis, some cells
  use bypass repair systems (such as NHEJ repair). Activation of the DNA-PK pathway
  results in upregulation of the AKT pathway, which in turn activates NADPH oxidase.
  Cytoplasmic ROS generation will consequently increase, leading to enhanced oxidation
  of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, followed by the induction of mtDNA deletions,
  mitochondrial ROS, and alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Meanwhile, it
  is likely that increased cytoplasmic ROS enhances the mutation of oncogenes and/or
  tumor suppressor genes, leading to aberrant cell-cycle progression, enhanced cell
  proliferation, and tumorigenesis.
