caption: This scheme depicts pathways related to perturbations in pentose phosphate
  pathway, purine metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and lipid peroxidation, with a
  specific emphasis on those linked to redox stress. Metabolites with increased levels
  are indicated in red and with upward arrows; those with decreased levels are indicated
  in green and with downward arrows. The metabolites/pathways that changed only in
  MCD+PCB 126 vs MCD groups are marked with asterisk. See also  for r
