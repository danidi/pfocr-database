caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of BBB disruption in CNS
  TB. In homeostasis (left panel), MMP-9 secretion is low and the human Hedgehog (Hh)
  pathway is active which maintains blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Astrocyte
  derived sonic hedgehog (Shh) binds to patched (Ptch), allowing activation of Smoothened
  (smo), and Gli translocation to the nucleus, leading to the expression of TJP. In
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (right panel), mycobacteria that reach the
  CNS stimulate microglia and astrocytes, which secrete cytokines such as TNF-α and
  IL-1β and matrix metalloproteinases. Cellular signalling networks between infected
  microglial/ monocyte-derived cells (CoMtb), and uninfected astrocytes or microvascular
  endothelial cells have important roles in driving inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP)-9 degrades tight junction proteins (TJPs) and type IV collagen in the basement
  membrane, increasing BBB permeability. MMP-9 also decreases Scube2 protein levels
  at the surface of astrocytes, impairing Shh processing and delivery to endothelial
  cells, downregulating the Hh pathway, and further decreasing TJP expression. Impaired
  tight junctions together with increased surface expression of endothelial adhesion
  molecules (e.g. ICAM-1, VCAM-1) result in leukocyte influx into the CNS, causing
  host immunopathology.
