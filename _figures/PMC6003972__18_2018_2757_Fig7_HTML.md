caption: Schematic model of the NF-κB pathway in the regulation of the human SLC52A3
  transactivation. Environmental stimuli that activate NF-κB p65/Rel-B cause phosphorylation
  of IκB, which is followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This
  results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLS) on NF-κB p65/Rel-B
  subunits and the subsequent translocation of the molecule to the nucleus. In the
  nucleus, NF-κB p65/Rel-B bind to their consensus sequence in the human SLC52A3,
  resulting in SLC52A3 transcriptional activation
