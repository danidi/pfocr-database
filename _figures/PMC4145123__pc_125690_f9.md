caption: A Coactivator and Corepressor Model for  Signaling.Under -deficient conditions,
  DELLA proteins are stable and localized in nuclei. DELLAs titrate PIF and BZR transcription
  factors by inhibiting DNA binding activity while exhibiting high transcriptional
  activity with GAF1. In the presence of , DELLAs are degraded via the 26S proteasome
  pathway. On the one hand, PIF and BZR activate target genes such as PACLOBUTRAZOL
  RESISTANCE (PRE) and EXPANSIN. On the other hand, the GAF1-TPR complex exhibits
  transcriptional repression activity. -induced functional conversion of the GAF1
  complex in plants depends on the degradation of coactivator DELLA proteins.
