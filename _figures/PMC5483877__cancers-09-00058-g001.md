caption: Strategies of effective targeting of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met
  signaling for the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ligand binding of
  c-Met triggers multiple signaling pathways, including the conventional PI3K/AKT
  and MAPK, coupled with the Hic-5-reactive oxygen species (ROS)-c-jun-N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) cascade. It also induces the c-Met endosomal pathway, including early
  endosomal and late endosomal, and recycling of the c-Met pathway for c-Met-mediated
  fluctuant signaling for HCC migration. Altogether, these pathways lead to HCC progression.
  Conventional blocking of c-Met signaling by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of
  c-Met or by agonists of PI3K/AKT and MAPK may cause resistance or side effects (shown
  as dotted arrows in purple), whereas blocking of the Hic-5-ROS-JNK cascade is proposed
  to be more promising (shown as solid arrows in orange-red). In addition, the inhibition
  of the endosomal regulators PKCε and GGA3 (shown as solid arrows in orange-red)
  may perturb the c-Met fluctuant signaling for cell migration. On the other hand,
  using herbal drugs against c-Met-dependent signaling (shown as solid arrows in orange-red)
  is proposed to be more effective and safer.
