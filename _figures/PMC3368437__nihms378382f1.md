caption: Regulation of vascular cell signaling by thrombospondin-1 and CD47. A, Angiogenic
  factors such as VEGF stimulate NO synthesis in endothelial cells by endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). TSP1 binding to CD47 inhibits activation of the VEGF
  receptor VEGFR2 and inhibits calcium-dependent activation of the VEGFR2 target eNOS.
  Within endothelial cells, NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to increase
  angiogenesis, and this enzyme is another target of inhibitory signaling through
  CD47. NO can also diffuse into underlying vascular smooth muscle where it activates
  sGC to cause relaxation and increase blood flow. TSP1 in the vessel wall can antagonize
  this signal via CD47 on vascular smooth muscle cells. NO diffusing into the vascular
  lumen limits platelet activation, and TSP1 signaling via CD47 blocks this signal
  to promote platelet aggregation. B, NO can also act on inflammatory cells to inhibit
  their activation. TSP1 signaling through this pathway may regulate inflammation,
  and additional signals through CD47 regulate recruitment and interferon-γ and ROS
  production.
