caption: Early steps of tetrahydrofolate and tetrahydromethanopterin pathways in Bacteria
  and Archaea. Most bacteria use the FolE (or FolE2)/FolB/FolK route (in blue) to
  6-HMDP even if some use the bacterial PTPS-III shunt (in green). Several routes
  to the common 6-HMDP intermediate in tetrahydrofolate and tetrahydromethanopterin
  are found in Archaea. A common pathway is the FolE2/MptD/MptE route (in red) such
  as in H. volcanii paralleling the bacterial pathway. However, some methanogens such
  as M. jannaschii use the MptA/MptB/MptD/MptE route, whereas P. furiosus uses the
  archaeal PTPS-III shunt. Phosphatases still to be identified are noted by a question
  mark (?). FolE/FolE2, GTP cyclohydrolase IA/IB (GCYH-IA/B); FolB, 7,8-dihydroneopterin
  aldolase (DHNA); FolK, 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin diphosphokinase (6-HMDPK);
  MptA, archaeal GTP cyclohydrolase I (Fe(II)-dependent enzyme); MptB, Fe(II) dependent-cyclic
  phosphodiesterase; MptD, archaeal specific DHNA; MptE, archaeal specific 6-HMDPK;
  PTPS-III/PTPS-V/PTPS-VI, pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase paralogs involved in
  6-HMDP synthesis.
