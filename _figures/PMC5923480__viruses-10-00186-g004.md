caption: Feline A3s inhibit the replication of FIV and are counteracted by FIV Vif.
  In producer cells, A3s can be incorporated into virus particles and be delivered
  into target cell in the absence of Vif. During viral reverse transcription, virion-encapsidated
  A3s are able to catalyze the cytidine to uridine in viral cDNA. In the synthesis
  of next strand virus DNA, G-A hypermutations are produced on the coding strand.The
  uracil-containing viral cDNAs are partially degraded by cellular DNA repair enzymes,
  and the double-stranded DNAs harboring G-to-A hypermutations encode viral proteins
  with premature stop codons or mutated proteins. However, FIV Vif directly interacts
  with feline A3s and forms an A3-Vif-E3 ubiquitination complex, which induces A3
  degradation by the proteasome pathway. In Vif expressing FIV infections, viral particels
  are produced that are mostly free of A3 proteins.
