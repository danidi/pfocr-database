caption: The expanding role of macrophages in cardiovascular homeostasis and disease.
  Activation of the cGAS-IRF3 pathway in macrophages promotes inflammation and cardiac
  remodeling. Alarmins released from infarct tissue and elevated sympathetic drive
  function synergistically to promote progression of atherosclerosis after acute cardiovascular
  events. TET2-deficient macrophages accelerate atherosclerosis. Resident macrophages
  facilitate conduction in the AV node by forming gap junctions through connexin (Cx)
  43. Macrophages are essential for myocardial regeneration by promoting angiogenesis
  and extracellular matrix remodeling.
