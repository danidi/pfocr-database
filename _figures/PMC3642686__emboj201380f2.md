caption: Schematic description of eIF2a phosphorylation pathway. Upon stress sensing,
  four known different eIF2α kinases, PKR, PERK, GCN2 and HRI, act via phosphorylation
  of serine 51 of eIF2α to limit global protein synthesis. GADD34 (PPP1R15a) and CReP
  (PPP1R15b) are regulatory subunits of PP1 that promote eIF2α dephosphorylation and
  counteract eIF2α kinases activity. Under normal conditions, ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP
  mRNA translation is repressed by competition for translation initiation of several
  short open reading frames (decoy ORFs) located upstream and frame shifted from the
  true translation initiation site. Upon phosphorylation of eIF2α, translation can
  now initiate at the AUG of the downstream coding regions allowing synthesis of these
  molecules during stress-induced protein synthesis inhibition.
