caption: A model for three pathways of TLS in mammalian cells. TLS across a TT CPD
  is rapid and accurate, and occurs most likely by a single DNA polymerase, polη (A).
  TLS across cisPt-GG and BP-G occurs by a two-polymerase TLS pathway, which is rapid
  and accurate but delayed, and involves a combination of polζ with either polη or
  polκ (B). TLS across an AP site occurs by a slow and highly mutagenic TLS pathway,
  which involves polζ, and most likely an additional DNA polymerase (C). See text
  for details.
