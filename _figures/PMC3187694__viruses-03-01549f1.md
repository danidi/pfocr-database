caption: A simplified model of autophagy. 1. The mTOR complex mTORC1 acts upstream
  of the autophagic pathway to suppress autophagic membrane formation, and mTOR activity
  can be monitored by detecting the activation of its downstream target S6 kinase.
  mTORC1 is inhibited when autophagy is induced via a cellular stress such as starvation
  or a drug treatment like rapamycin. 2. After initiation of autophagy, a complex
  containing the Atg protein Beclin-1 is necessary for autophagosome formation. Tamoxifen
  induces autophagy by indirectly acting upon Beclin-1, while 3-MA suppresses autophagy
  due to its inhibition of PI3 kinases that interact with Beclin-1. The picornaviruses
  PV, CVB3, HRV-2, HRV-14, EV71, FMDV and EMCV have been shown to induce autophagic
  membrane formation. 3. During autophagic membrane formation, the cytosolic Atg protein
  LC3-I becomes conjugated to PE, mediated in part by the ubiquitin E1-like enzyme
  Atg7, to form LC3-II. LC3-II proteins then specifically associate with a newly-formed
  crescent-shaped membrane termed a phagophore. The conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II
  has been observed with all of the picornaviruses discussed at length in this review.
  4. The phagophore elongates around cytosolic contents until the contents are completely
  sequestered within a fully formed double-membraned autophagosome. The formation
  of the autophagosome requires the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12. 5. The autophagosome
  matures, becoming acidic, and fuses with lysosomes to form the degradative autolysosome.
  The cytosolic contents are degraded, and LC3-II is also degraded or recycled back
  to LC3-I. CVB3 appears to block this degradative step, while EMCV does not.
