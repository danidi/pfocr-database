caption: As illustrated, genetic variations in Nrf2 and Keap1 genes as well as chemical
  inducers may cause persistent activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway leading to increased
  antioxidants and redox changes (not shown). Such changes may lead to (1) metabolic
  reprogramming of the cancer cells, promoting cancer cell proliferation, (2) increased
  stability of pro-metastasis factors, such as Bach1, promoting cancer metastasis,
  and (3) increased cellular defenses against cytotoxic anticancer drugs, causing
  drug resistance and cancer relapse. Collectively, these contribute to the progression
  of cancer and poor prognosis.
