caption: Complex interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  controls numerous biological processes. The HBP integrates a fraction of the glucose
  entering the cell as well as lipid, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolites to produce
  UDP-GlcNAc. Then, OGT uses UDP-GlcNAc as a nucleotide sugar donor substrate to add
  a GlcNAc group on serine and threonine residues of target proteins. Like phosphorylation,
  O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification. Its
  targets are involved in a wide range of biological processes such as transcription,
  translation, ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, signal transduction, cell traffic
  and architecture, cell cycle, apoptosis or development. In parallel, binding of
  insulin or growth factor to their RTK leads to receptor activation and recruitment
  of IRS-1/2 and PI3K. PI3K produces PIP3 (from PIP2), which recruits AKT and PDK1
  to the plasma membrane. PDK1 and mTOR in mTORC2 activate AKT through phosphorylation.
  mTORC1 is activated by AKT through TSC2 inhibition and upon amino acid stimulation
  and, is inhibited in response to low energy by AMPK. mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis
  via direct phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1. By phosphorylating key substrates,
  AKT and mTORC1 regulate metabolism, cell cycle, proliferation, survival, growth,
  angiogenesis and autophagy. OGT localization and activity are regulated through
  phosphorylation by IR and AMPK. OGT stability is indirectly regulated at the protein
  synthesis level via mTORC1. Reciprocally, several actors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway are modified by O-GlcNAcylation such as IRS-1, PI3K, PDK1, AKT, AMPK, p70S6K,
  and 4E-BP1.
