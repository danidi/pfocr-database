caption: Second part of E. histolytica glycolysis pathway. The pathway is formed by
  3-phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), enolase (ENO) and pyruvate phosphate dikinase
  (PPDK). Reduction of pyruvate to L-lactate (Lac) consuming NADH (dashed lines) is
  not part of the parasite pathway, but lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was used in the
  in vitro reconstituted pathway in order to experimentally follow the final flux
  and establish a quasi steady-state to Lac . Metabolite action in enzyme inhibition
  is represented in red. 3PG 3-phosphoglycerate; 2PG 2-phosphoglycerate; PEP phosphoenolpyruvate;
  Pyr pyruvate.
