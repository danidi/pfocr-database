caption: Resveratrol diminished the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in aged hearts
  through the restoration of SIRT1 deacetylase activity. This led to the inhibition
  of USP7, a p53-deubiquitinating enzyme, followed by a reduced expression of p53
  and Bax, which subsequently de-activated the apoptotic pathway. Enhancement of SIRT1
  activity by resveratrol also mitigated the augmentation of proteasomal activity
  induced by doxorubicin treatment. In young mice, resveratrol repressed the elevation
  of catabolic signalling measured as acetylated Foxo1 and MuRF-1 induced by doxorubicin.
  However, it is not known why the acetylation of Foxo1 and transactivation of MuRF-1
  were unaffected by pharmacological interventions in aged hearts.
