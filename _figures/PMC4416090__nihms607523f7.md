caption: Under conditions of sufficient nutrients, the insulin signaling and TOR signaling
  pathway are active in all endoreduplicating larval tissues (ERTs) and imaginal progenitor
  tissues, causing rapid growth and proliferation. However under conditions of amino
  acid insufficiency, growth is inhibited in ERTs, but only slowed in imaginal discs.
  In amino acid deprived ERTs, this is accomplished by down regulation of the insulin
  and TOR signaling pathway, which results in activation (by dephosphorylation) of
  FOXO and 4E-BP. In ERTs, FOXO activates transcription of Thor, resulting in an increase
  in active 4E-BP protein levels and inhibition of cell growth. However in imaginal
  discs, Polycomb silencing of Thor prevents transcriptional activation of Thor by
  FOXO and renders discs refractory to rapid cell growth arrest in response to reduced
  insulin and TOR signaling pathways when nutrients are insufficient. The absence
  of 4E-BP protein in imaginal discs allows for continue proliferating under conditions
  of nutrient insufficiency, possibly by utilizing energy stores in ERTs until they
  are depleted, which delays the onset of growth arrest of imaginal progenitors.
