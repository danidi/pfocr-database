caption: Tetherin blocks virus release, activates an innate immune response and is
  counteracted by Vpu or Nef. Tetherin (BST2 or CD317) prevents virus release by inserting
  its N-terminal transmembrane domain in the plasma membrane and its GPI-linked C
  terminus in the virus envelope lipid bilayer. The tethered virus is then endocytosed.
  Tetherin contacts cortical actin through an interaction with RICH2. Tetherin is
  phosphorylated on tyrosines near its N terminus by Syk. Phosphorylated tetherin
  activates TRAF2, TRAF6 and TAK1. The complex phosphorylates IKK, causing the degradation
  of IκBα and thereby activating NF-κB, which induces the transcription of the proinflammatory
  cytokines CXCL10, IL-6 and IFN-β. Sequestration of tetherin by HIV-1 Vpu in the
  ER prevents its transit to the plasma membrane. Tetherin proteasomal degradation
  is induced by its interaction with the SCF-β-TRCP complex. In most SIVs, Nef binds
  to tetherin at the plasma membrane to induce its endocytosis through an AP2-dependent
  pathway.
