caption: Model for the modulation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway by extracellular domains
  of Frizzled receptors. We propose that a complex formed between Xfz4S and Wnt-3a/-8/-8b
  could be recognized by LRP and Wnt signaling could be activated in LRP dependent
  manner. Complexes between Xfz4S and Wnt-4/-5a/-11 would not be recognized by LRP
  and Xfz4S and Wnt/β-catenin signaling would not be activated by these Wnts.
