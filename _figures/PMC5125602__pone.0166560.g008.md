caption: TAC (stress overload) could activate phosphorylation of the protein kinases
  of ERK1/2 and AKT, enhance the expression of GATA4, promote the transcription of
  BNP gene, and result in HF. SalB could inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2,decreasing
  the expression of GATA4 and BNP, leading to inhibit HF. ⫿ denotes inhibition of
  protein kinase by SalB treatment, ⨂ denotes AKT was not participated in SalB treatment.
