caption: 'Schematic representation of energy status of cells modulating cell signaling
  and mitochondrial function. Under high energy (ATP/AMP ratio)/nutrient levels the
  insulin/insulin growth factor signaling (IIS) activates PI3K-Akt pathway. Initiation
  of PI3K-Akt signaling takes place when mTORC2 is active and phosphorylates Akt on
  Serine473. FoxO is the transcription factor of rictor, a critical component of mTORC2.
  Akt is further phosphorylated at Threonine 308 by IIS mediated PIPDK (originally
  PDK1). High ATP/AMP ratio stabilizes the phosphorylations and activated Akt phosphorylates
  FoxO, which leads to its exclusion from the nucleus. Akt inactivates tuberous sclerosis
  complex (TSC) 1/2 resulting in activation of mTORC1. mTORC1 promotes biosynthetic
  activity, inhibits autophagy. When ATP/AMP ratio is high, mitochondria stop synthesizing
  ATP and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activate metabolite shuttles
  to replenish the amino acids and citrate, the precursors of protein and membrane
  lipids. Reduction in the ATP/ADP ratio, on the other hand, results in activation
  of AMPK, which activates autophagy. FoxO translocates into nucleus transcribes sestrins
  which inhibit mTORC1 and activates mTORC2 by transcribing rictor. The activation
  of glycolysis and glucose transport by Akt S473 and AMPK increases the ATP/ADP ratio
  there by reactivating the cycle. Under normal and healthy dietary conditions a perfect
  balance between ATP production, ROS generation, and biosynthetic processes is cyclically
  maintained by activation–inactivation cycles of autophagy modulated by alternate
  activation and inactivation cycle of AMPK and mTORC1. Under surplus nutrients/inflammatory
  conditions, a deregulated hyper activated mTORC1 leads to either carcinogenesis
  or insulin resistance. A growing tumor, with increased population of cells is heterogeneous
  with mixed population of cells, either deprived of oxygen or having access to it.
  It maintains a metabolic symbiosis with hypoxic cells surviving on glucose uptake
  and anaerobic glycolysis, while those having access to oxygen thrive on lactate
  accumulating in the neighborhood (microenvironment). Akt, protein kinase B (T308,
