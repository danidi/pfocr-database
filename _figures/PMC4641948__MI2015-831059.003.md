caption: The coagulation proteases thrombin and activated factor X (FXa) enhance S1P
  synthesis and release from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSCMs). During vascular
  injury, local generation of thrombin and FXa enhances the synthesis and the release
  of S1P via activation of PAR-1 and PAR-2, respectively. This signaling pathway involves
  activation of the small GTPase Rho and PKC signaling leading to transcriptional
  upregulation of SphK-1. The resulting S1P activities regulate proliferation and
  migration of VSMCs.
