caption: Model for the Proposed Mechanism of the Antiestrogenic Effects of TCDD and
  HypoxiaTranscriptional activity of the ERs, particularly of ERβ, is enhanced by
  the presence of ARNT. Activation of the AhR or HIF-1α signaling pathway leads to
  reduction of ARNT available for ER and thus to decreased ER function.
