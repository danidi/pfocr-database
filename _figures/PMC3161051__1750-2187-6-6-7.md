caption: Model of Rad6B/β-catenin regulation in breast cancer cells with autocrine
  Wnt activity. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is regulated by Wnt ligand
  interactions with Wnt receptors Frizzled (FZD) and coreceptors LRP5/6 at the cell
  surface, and culminates in β-catenin stabilization by preventing its recruitment
  into the APC/Axin/GSK3 destruction complex. Rad6B transcription is induced by β-catenin,
  and Rad6B in turn stabilizes β-catenin by mediating K63 linked polyubiqitin modifications
  that render β-catenin insensitive to proteasomal degradation. Rad6B silencing disrupts
  the positive feedback loop between Rad6B expression and β-catenin stabilization
  with resultant decrease in ubiquitinated β-catenin and β-catenin transcriptional
  activity. The Rad6B induced β-catenin stabilization occurs downstream of Wnt activation
  and requires LRP6 mediated protection of β-catenin from incorporation into the destruction
  complex, as inhibition of LRP6 function in Rad6B overexpressors prevents β-catenin
  stabilization with resultant decreases in Rad6B expression.
