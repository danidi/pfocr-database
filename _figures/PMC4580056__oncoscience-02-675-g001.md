caption: 'Top: conventional progression pathway via knock-down/loss of APC or expression
  of stabilized β-Catenin; Bottom: serrated progression pathway initiated by activation
  of BRAF. Dashed lines indicate non-malignant endpoints, either by tissue reversion
  (restoration of APC or inactivation of stabilized β-Catenin) or stem cell exhaustion
  (BRAF hyperactivation). Mutations in key oncogenes and tumor suppressors are given
  in blue and green, respectively. Changes in the stem cell pool are indicated in
  red. Code for cell types: stem cells (red); proliferative progenitors (pink); differentiated
  cells (blue); cancer cells (red-blue).'
