caption: The proposed signaling pathway involved in VEGF165 and flow/shear stress-induced
  dilations of retinal arterioles. Evidence from our studies provides support for
  ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of VEGFR2 in the endothelium
  mediating NO-dependent dilations of retinal arterioles in response to VEGF165 and
  increased flow/shear stress, respectively. The activation of endothelial VEGFR2
  leads to stimulation of PI3K and downstream link to calpain proteases and subsequent
  SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of NOS for NO production and arteriolar dilation.
  Bradykinin also can elicit a calpain/SIRT1-dependent vasodilator response, whereas
  resveratrol activates SIRT1 downstream from calpain leading to NO-mediated vasodilation.
  Blockade of the proposed signaling pathways by their respective inhibitors is indicated
  with vertical lines in reference to the direction of the arrows. AB, antibody.
