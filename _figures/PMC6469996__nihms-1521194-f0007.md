caption: Schematic illustration of pathways regulated by NNMT and proposed working
  model of mechanisms of action of NNMT inhibition as it relates to muSC activation
  and metabolic state in aged muscle tissue. Maintenance of flux through the NAD salvage
  pathway by NNMTi is indicated by gradient blue/red arrow; (i) increase flux of NAD+,
  activated SIRT-1, and oxidative metabolism that support quiescent muSCs are indicated
  by red arrows; (ii) increased NADH (i.e., increased NAD+ utilization in glycolysis),
  enhanced glycolysis, and reduced SIRT-1 mediated histone deacetylation that support
  muSC activation and differentiation are indicated by blue arrows. Pathway abbreviations
  include AOx1 (aldehyde oxidase), NA (nicotinamide), MNA (1-methylnicotinmaide),
  NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), NMN (nicotinamide mononucleoside),
  NMNAT (nicotinamide adenylyltransferase), NNMT (nicotinamide N-methyltransferase),
  NR (nicotinamide riboside), NRK (nicotinamide riboside kinase), PNP1 (purine nucleoside
  phosphorylase), PYR-2/4 (1-methyl-2/4-pyridone-5-carboxamide), SAH (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine),
  SAM (S-adenosylmethionine), MTases (methyl transferases), SIRT1 (NAD-dependent deacetylase
  sirtuin 1), NAD+/NADH (oxidized Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/reduced form of
  NAD+), OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation), Histone*protein-Ac/DeAc (Acetylated/deacetylated
  histones).
