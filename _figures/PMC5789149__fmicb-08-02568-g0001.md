caption: (A) Extracellular electron transport (EET) in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
  builds proton motive force (pmf). Under anaerobic conditions members of the genus
  Shewanella can transport electrons from the inner membrane, periplasm, outer membrane,
  and an electrode via a chain of cytochromes and menaquinones (MQ) known collectively
  as extracellular electron transport (EET). Expression of EET cytochromes can fluctuate
  based on the electron acceptor available in the environment. The number of iron
  containing c-type heme groups are indicated inside (parenthesis). Electron flows
  from electron donors, such as lactate, to reduce quinones (Q), which simultaneously
  transfer H+ into periplasm, building pmf, while also passing electrons to CymA.
  In the absence of soluble electron acceptors the electrons are transferred to MtrCAB
  outer membrane complex. This MtrCAB complex can donate electrons directly to terminal
  electron acceptor, either mineral or anode electrode, or via flavin molecules. The
  pmf drives the production of ATP and rotation of the polar flagella. “Self-sensing”
  methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) control flagella rotation via the chemotaxis
  signal transduction system (B) and may detect changes in H+ concentration during
  metal reduction. (B) Likely chemotaxis signal transduction pathway in Shewanella.
  In response to stimulation, the structure of MCP shifts like a piston, causing the
  auto phosphorylation of CheA to slow or stop. CheY and CheB are, therefore, not
  phosphorylated, and this lack of CheY-P allows smooth swimming. This stimulation
  also has another effect—the CheB is inactive without phosphorylation (it cannot
  perform as a methylesterase) and this allows for the CheR protein (a continually
  active methyltransferase) to outcompete and freely methylate the dimer methyl-accepting
  region of MCP (HAMP domain). This methylation of the MCP acts to increase the auto-phosphorylation
  rate of CheA Histidine residue. Therefore, the signal transduction system has control
  over the flagellar reversal frequency in the presence of increased or decreased
  stimuli, leading to a series of “run-and-reversal” swimming.
