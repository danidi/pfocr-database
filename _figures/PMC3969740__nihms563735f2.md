caption: A) Pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I and TLR3 detect HCV ds RNA and activate
  via their adaptor molecules IPS-1 and TRIF. These signaling cascades result in transcription
  of INF-β gene in synergy with NF-κβ. Secreted INF-β activate JAK/STAT pathway by
  binding INF common receptor. As a result, INF-stimulated genes are induced. B) HCV
  attenuates innate immune responses at the multiple levels. NS3/4A protease inhibits
  RIG-I and TLR3 downstream pathway via blocking their adaptor molecules, IPS-1 and
  TRIF. HCV proteins NS5A and Core inhibit INF-stimulated gene expression by interfering
  with JAK/STAT pathway. HCV proteins E2 and NS5A inhibit PKR activation.
