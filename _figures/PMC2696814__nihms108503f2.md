caption: An increased on-rate of autophagy occurs in response to stress signals, resulting
  in increased autophagosomal and autolysosomal accumulation and successful execution
  of the adaptive physiological functions of autophagy. In certain disease states
  or upon treatment with lysosomal inhibitors, there is a reduced off-rate resulting
  in impaired lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes. This results in increased autophagosomal
  accumulation and adverse pathophysiological consequences related to unsuccessful
  completion of the autophagy pathway. A decreased on-rate is observed if signaling
  activation of autophagy is defective or mutations are present in ATG genes. This
  results in decreased autophagosomal accumulation, the accumulation of protein aggregates
  and damaged organelles, and pathophysiological consequences related to deficient
  protein and organelle turnover. The physiological and pathophysiological consequences
  listed for “increased on-rate,” “reduced off-rate,” and “decreased on-rate” are
  based on knockout studies of the ATG genes in model organisms.
