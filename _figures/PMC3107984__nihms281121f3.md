  (), we present a visual depiction of the data from . In green are genes annotated
  in the KEGG database, in white are genes not annotated in the KEGG database. In
  blue are genes that show nominal significance in the “Gene p-value” test in the
  detailed pathway analysis, and the gene symbols for the nominally significant genes
  are listed beside the KEGG annotation. Genes that were not nominally associated,
  but in the pathway are: 2.3.1.9 = ACAT1 and ACAT2; 2.3.3.10 = HMGCS1 and HMGCS2;
  2.8.3.5 = OXCT2.'
