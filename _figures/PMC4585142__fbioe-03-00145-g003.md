caption: 'Relevant engineered E. coli strains for SA production. Metabolic traits
  of E. coli derivative strains engineered for SA production resulting in highest
  SA titer and yield from glucose. The figure illustrates alterative glucose transporter
  GalP (galactose permease) selected by the cell after laboratory adaptive evolution
  process of a PTS− mutant (Flores et al., , ; Aguilar et al., ). Glf (glucose facilitator)
  and Glk (glucokinase) from Z. mobilis (plasmid cloned). Resultant characteristics
  of engineered strains are shown for pSC6.090B (Chandran et al., ), PB12.SA22 (Escalante
  et al., ), AR36 (Rodriguez et al., ), and SA116 strain (Cui et al., ). CCM key intermediates
  and protein encoding genes: TCA, tricarboxylic acid pathway; E4P, erythrose-4-P;
  PGNL, 6-phospho d-glucono-1,5-lactone; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate;
  ACoA, acetyl-CoA; CIT, citrate; OAA, oxaloacetate; zwf, glucose 6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase;
  tktA, transketolase I; pykA, pyruvate kinase II; lpdA, aceE and aceF, coding for
  PYR dehydrogenase subunits; gltA, citrate synthase; pck, PEP carboxykinase; ppc
  PEP carboxylase; ppsA, PEP synthetase. SA pathway intermediates and genes: DAHP,
  3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate; DHQ, 3-dehydroquinate; DHS, 3-dehydroshikimate;
  SA, shikimic acid. Continuous arrows indicate single enzymatic reactions; dashed
  arrows show several enzymatic reactions. Bold arrows show improved carbon flux.
  Black squares in plasmids/operons indicate gene interruption; c, chromosomal gene
  interruption or integration; p, plasmid-cloned genes.'
