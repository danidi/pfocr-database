caption: '(A) In plants, IRE1A and IRE1B have a luminal domain and cytosolic kinase
  and RNase domains. By similarity with yeast and metazoans, it has been proposed
  that the interaction between BiP and the luminal domain of IRE1 may keep the lattes
  in an inactive monomeric state. Upon the accumulation of unfolded proteins, BIP
  dissociates from IRE1, leading to IRE1 homodimerization and auto-transphosphorylation
  as well as promoting activation of the RNase domain. In plants, the RNase domain
  catalyzes two processes: the unconventional splicing of bZIP60 mRNA producing the
  translation of an active TF, bZIP60 (pathway 1), and the selective degradation of
  mRNAs (RIDD) (pathway 2), which has been associated with autophagy. If the IRE1-kinase
  domain phosphorylates other functional substrates besides itself has not been yet
  establish (pathway 3). The recent identification of IRE1C (pathway 4), which lacks
  the luminal domain, raises questions about its mechanism of activation and its functional
  implication in the response to stressors (). (B) The activation of bZIP28 is mediated
  by its interaction with BiP (pathway 1). An accumulation of unfolded proteins causes
  the dissociation of BiP from the bZIP28 luminal domain leading to its Golgi translocation.
  Once in the Golgi, bZIP28 is cleaved first by unknown protease(s), possibly by S1P,
  and then by S2P. This process releases the active TF from the membrane anchor for
  nuclear translocation. Although the activation mechanism of bZIP17 may be similar
  to bZIP28 (pathway 2), the interacting proteins that retain bZIP17 in the ER under
  normal conditions has not been described yet. CT, cytoplasm; LM, ER lumen; N, nucleus.'
