caption: Model to explain how FGFR3–TACC3 contributes to oncogenesis. (a) FGFR3 is
  normally involved in signalling via MAPK and PI3K signalling cascade. Upon fusion
  with TACC3, FGFR3–TACC3 activates the MAPK pathway constitutively, with possible
  activation of PI3K. Previous work has described how either a loss or overexpression
  of TACC3 causes mitotic defects. (b) Work in this paper shows that FGFR3–TACC3 binds
  and recruits TACC3 away from the spindle. In addition to constitutive signalling,
  cells have defects in mitosis which together are likely to contribute to oncogenesis.
