caption: Schematic model of the effect of NS5A on the β-catenin signaling pathway.
  Binding of NS5A to the SH3 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K relieves
  inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit and activates lipid kinase activity. The
  mechanism of this activation is as yet uncharacterized, hence the question mark.
  In turn, activation of PI3K recruits and activates the serine/threonine kinase Akt,
  a master control switch within the cell. Akt subsequently phosphorylates and inhibits
  several proapoptotic proteins, including the Bcl2 homologue Bad and the stress-activated
  transcription factor FKHR. Akt also phosphorylates the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3β,
  a negative regulator of the proto-oncogene β-catenin. Inhibition of GSK-3β prevents
  proteasomal degradation of β-catenin, and in turn activated β-catenin can translocate
  to the nucleus and bind to promoter sequences within genes associated with cell
  survival. In all cases, events stimulated by NS5A are denoted by (↑↑), and those
  inhibited by NS5A are denoted by (↓↓).
