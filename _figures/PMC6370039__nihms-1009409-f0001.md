caption: Relationship between NFκB and autophagy. The majority of cancer cells express
  a constitutively activated NFκB pathway responsible for tumor cell survival, growth,
  invasion, and resistance to cytotoxic therapies. There exists crosstalk between
  the NFκB pathway and autophagy. Activated NFκB signals two downstream target gene
  products, SNAIL and YY1, leading to their overexpression. The overexpression of
  YY1 negatively regulates miR30A, resulting in the de-repression of both Atg5 and
  Beclin-1, and thus, leading to the induction of autophagy. Likewise, the overexpression
  of SNAIL results in the repression of E-cadherin and the induction of EMT. There
  is crosstalk in both directions between EMT and autophagy (depending on the type
  of cancer and its properties). The overexpression of SNAIL represses RKIP and leads
  to its failure to inhibit NFκB (solid lines). If NFκB is inhibited, all of the just
  described processes are reversed (dashed lines).
