caption: Cell cycle pathway. Tumor suppressor genes (CDKN1A/p21, CDKN1C/p57, RBL2/p130)
  and the cyclin D family were overexpressed in normal lung tissue while there was
  type-specific overexpression of oncogenes, cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases, and
  other cell cycle driving genes in tumors. Genes belonging to the mini-chromosome
  maintenance complex were overexpressed in squamous and small-cell lung cancer, as
  well as in mesothelioma. The same genes were not differentially expressed in AD
  and downregulated in COID. Fifty-six out of 63 genes in the Cell Cycle pathway were
  overexpressed in SQ, including CCNE/CDK2, CCNA/CDK2, CCNA/CDK1, CCNB/CDK1 complexes,
  BUB1, BUB1B, BUB3, and MYC oncogenes, damage response genes (ATR, CHEK1/2) and five
  genes of the 14-3-3 family. Red is overexpressed, dark green downregulated. SQ,
  squamous type; AD, adenocarcinoma; SCLC, small-cell lung cancer; COID, carcinoid;
  MESO, mesothelioma.
