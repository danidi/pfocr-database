caption: 'Modeling of the multiple functions of Reelin during migration, dendritic
  growth and synaptic development and the corresponding signaling pathways: (A,A’).
  During the early steps of cortical development, early born neurons perform a radial
  glia-independent somal translocation. Reelin triggers an interaction between Cajal–Retzius
  cells (CR) and the neuron leading process through N-cadherin and nectins. (B,B’,B’’).
  As the neocortex develops, the cerebral wall increases in thickness. The somal translocation
  mode of migration is gradually replaced by a radial migration subdivided into four
  steps: a short bipolar migration during which postmitotic cells move away from the
  ventricular zone (VZ) (not depicted here), followed by a radial glia-independent
  multipolar migration. Cells then switch to a radial glia-dependent but Reelin-independent
  bipolar locomotion and finish their journey with a terminal somal translocation.
  While the full-length Reelin is produced and mainly located at the marginal zone
  (MZ), cleavage fragments of Reelin depleted of the C-t fragment, namely R3-6, N-R2
  and N-R6, diffuse from the MZ into the depth of the tissue to reach and signal to
  multipolar neurons. R3-6 and/or N-R6 interaction with ApoER2 receptors induces the
  movement of multipolar neurons towards the cortical plate (CP) and a timely subsequent
  switch from multipolar to bipolar migration. This depends on a Reelin-triggered
  interaction and activation of N-cadherin with fibroblast growth factors (FGF) receptors
  (FGFRs) and the downstream effectors Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases
  1 and 2 (Erk1/2). When bipolar locomoting neurons reach the top of the cortical
  plate (CP), Reelin triggers the detachment from the radial glia and induces a switch
  from the locomotion mode of migration into the terminal somal translocation. This
  requires the interaction of full-length Reelin and/or any of its processing fragments
  containing the central part R3-6 with VLDLR and ApoER2 to stimulate the interaction
  of Integrins α5β1 on the neuron leading process with fibronectin located at the
  MZ. Both multipolar migration and terminal somal translocation require activation
  of the small GTPase Rap1 and of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/n-cofilin
  pathway. (C,C’). After completion of migration, the leading process transforms into
  apical dendrites. Reelin triggers dendritic growth and branching in the cerebral
  cortex and hippocampus. Several mechanisms are involved. All these events seem to
  be regulated by PI3K: Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor)/S6
  kinase 1 (S6K1) pathway that could regulate protein synthesis; regulation of the
  actin cytoskeleton through n-cofilin; and promotion of the translocation of the
  Golgi into the longest dendrite in a Cdc42-dependent manner. (D,D’). Dendritic spines
  are small protrusions arising from the dendritic shaft where most excitatory synapses
  reside. Reelin regulates their density in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.
  Synaptic plasticity is the ability of a synapse to modify its strength and is also
  influenced by Reelin that accumulates at synaptic contacts. N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate
  receptors (NMDARs and AMPARs ) are two postsynaptic ionotropic receptors directly
  involved in synaptic plasticity. Reelin modulates the subunit composition of NMDARs,
  its phosphorylation, its calcium conductance and potentiation. Reelin also facilitates
  the insertion of AMPARs in postsynaptic membranes and presynaptic release of neurotransmitters.
  Core components VLDLR and/or ApoER2, Src family kinases (SFK) and Dab1 are involved
  in most Reelin functions. Dab1 is polyubiquitinated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
  containing Cullin 5 (Cul5), Rbx2 and SOCS7 and is subsequently degraded by the proteasome.
  This rapid downregulation of the signal is necessary for a correct organization
  of the CP. Its function in Reelin-induced dendritic growth and at the synapse has
  not been investigated. The PI3K/Akt pathway is also involved in all these Reelin
  functions but was apparently not crucial for early somal translocation. See the
  text for more details.'
