caption: Potential effects of elevated CO2 on host plant, and the cascading effects
  on aphid feeding using Medicago truncatula-pea aphid as examples. Elevated CO2 affects
  aphid feeding efficiency in three ways. First, elevated CO2 modifies the phytohormone-dependent
  induced defenses and plant secondary metabolites derived defense. Enhancement of
  the salicylic acid-dependent defense pathway increased surface and epidermis resistance
  while the impairment of the jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent defense pathway decreased
  mesophyll and phloem resistance. The changes of resistance facilitate the penetration
  feeding phase (the feeding phase that occurs before the stylet reaches the phloem).
  Second, the impairment of ethylene signaling pathway enhanced N fixation inroot,
  elevated CO2 tends to increase N assimilation and non-essential amino acid supple
  in the phloem. Furthermore, the aphid endosymbiont Buchnera could transform non-essential
  amino acid into essential amino acids, which increases the output of essential amino
  acid for aphids. Therefore, the increased amino acid supply benefits the phloem
  feeding of aphids. Third, elevated CO2 decreases stomatal conductance and transpiration,
  which increases the water potential in M. truncatula. As a result, aphid xylem feeding
  and osmotic pressure regulation are enhanced under elevated CO2. These three effects
  of elevated CO2 (alteration of host plant defenses, of amino acid supply in the
  phloem, and of host and aphid water status) greatly affect aphid feeding efficiency.
