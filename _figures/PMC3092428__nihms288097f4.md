caption: Mechanism of Torso signal transduction. Ligand (Trunk) binding triggers dimerization
  and autophosphorylation of Torso on multiple tyrosine residues. Phosphotyrosines
  located in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain are essential for Torso
  enzymatic activity. Phosphotyrosines located outside of the kinase domain serve
  to recruit Csw and possibly DSHC and other adaptors or SH2-containing signaling
  molecules, which may include STAT92E. The adaptor molecules redundantly or synergistically
  recruit Son of Sevenless (Sos) to the membrane. Sos converts GDP-Ras1 to GTP-Ras1,
  linking Torso activation to the Ras1/Draf/Dsor1/Rolled signaling cassette. In addition,
  Torso is able to activate Draf by means of a Ras1-independent pathway (dashed line
  1), and Ras1 plays a role in activating an unknown Draf activator (dashed line 2)
  in addition to binding to Draf. Thus, multiple signaling routes originating from
  Torso can converge on the Draf kinase, leading to expression of downstream target
  genes. In the posterior terminal region, Torso signaling induces target gene tailless
  (tll) and huckebein (hkb) mainly by derepression, counteracting repressor complexes,
  including Capicua (Cic) and Groucho (Gro) and possibly other proteins that bind
  to the regulatory regions of tll and hkb. Gro is a conserved transcription repressor
  that is recruited to specific genes by its DNA-binding partner Cic. After relief
  of repression, the expression of tll and hkb depends on participation of transcription
  activators that may or may not require input from Torso signaling. Gene regulation
  by Torso in the anterior terminal region is more complex (see text for detail) and
  is not depicted in this schematic drawing.
