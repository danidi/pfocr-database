caption: Pathway of the 90-kilodalton heat-shock protein (Hsp90) cellular stress response.
  Hsp90 expression increases in response to environmental stress, which perturbs protein
  form and function (protein homeostasis), including proteins involved in genomic
  DNA repair (e.g., DNA Pol-η), transcriptional activity (PPARα/β), chromosome integrity,
  and epigenetic regulation (e.g., histone acetyltransferase, SmyD). Hsp90, along
  with the cochaperone Shutdown (Shu) is also necessary for loading of piwi-interacting
  RNAs (piRNAs) onto the PIWI protein complex. The PIWI/piRNA pathway can silence
  transposable elements (TEs) transcriptionally (left), through histone methylation
  (Me) or other modifications to histones (H), or post-transcriptionally (right),
  through RNA-interference-mediated targeting of TE transposase RNAs. Genomic DNA
  (gray), TE DNA/RNA (red), and piRNA (purple) are also shown.
