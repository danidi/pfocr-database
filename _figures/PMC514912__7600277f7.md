caption: Model showing the cooperation of the BLM and the FA pathways in the response
  to replication arrest induced by either DNA crosslinks or UVC and HU exposure. In
  response to HU or UVC (A), stall of the replication machinery triggers activation
  of both the BLM–MRE11 and the FA branches. Possibly, the BLM–MRE11 branch is required
  for direct resolution of the replication arrest, whereas the FA pathway might be
  required for the subsequent recombinational-based replication rescue. FANCD2–BLM
  interaction might be functional at this step. In response to ICL-dependent replication
  fork arrest (B), the upstream FA core complex is activated to trigger the FA-MRE11
  and the BLM branches of the pathway. Both the branches might be involved in the
  correct execution of the recombination-based rescue of replication, ensuring cell
  viability and chromosomal integrity.
