caption: TGF-β signaling in C. elegans. The TGF-β ligand (DAF-7) stimulates the type
  II receptor (DAF-4), which in turn, recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptor
  (DAF-1). DAF-1 phosphorylates (activates) downstream Smads (DAF-14), which complex
  with DAF-8 and enter the nucleus. In the nucleus, the DAF-8/-14 complex inhibits
  pro-dauer Smads (DAF-3/-5) and promotes development, rather than dauer formation.
  An alternate Smad based pathway involves hetero-trimer formation of a combination
  of SMA-2/-3 and 4. These trimers enter the nucleus, associate with transcriptional
  co-factors and regulate body size development of C. elegans.
