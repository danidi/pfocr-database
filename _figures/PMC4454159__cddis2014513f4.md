caption: 'Map of the NAD±biosynthetic pathway. To clarify the interpretation of the
  ‘in vivo'' experiments described in the test, the NAD+biosynthetic pathway is schematically
  reported: NAD+ can be synthesized from tryptophan (de novo synthesis) or nicotinic
  acid -NicA- or nicotinamide -Nam- (salvage pathway). NAD+synthesis via tryptophan
  is performed by several reactions that lead to quinolinic acid (Quin) synthesis:
  this is next converted into nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) and NAMN to desamido-NAD
  (NAAD) and eventually into NAD+. Diversely, in the major salvage pathway of NAD+synthesis,
  NAM can be converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT) and NMN is further converted into NAD+ by NMN adenylyltransferase (NMNAT
  1 and 2 nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms respectively, NMNAT3 mitochodrial isoform).
  The asterisk indicates a reaction, catalyzed by NAD+ glycohydrolase, which bears
  close similarity with the family of ADP ribosyl cyclases. However, all the NAD+-transforming
  enzyme families mentioned above (i.e., Mono ADP-ribosyl transferases, PARPs, sirtuins)
  share with ADP ribosyl cyclases/NAD+ glycohydrolases the property of releasing NAM
  from NAD+'
