caption: Innate immunity in the initial phase of infection. The initial immune response
  to SARS-CoV-2 by innate immune cells, after its entry via the ACE-2 receptor on
  lung or gut epithelium, determines whether or not infection is swiftly controlled
  and minimally symptomatic. 1. SARS-CoV-2 virions are taken up by a tissue-based
  macrophage or circulating monocyte. 2. Within the cell, SARS-CoV-2 single-stranded
  RNA is recognised by the RNA-responsive intracellular sensors RIG-1 and TLR-7 and
  signalling pathways are activated. 3. Due to RIG-1 and TLR-7 activation, nuclear
  transcription of antiviral interferons and inflammatory mediators is stimulated.
  Antiviral interferons predominate in females and inflammatory cytokines in males
  after TLR7 signalling, contributing to more efficient viral clearance in females.4.
  Intracellular disturbance caused by whole SARS-CoV-2 virions cause activation of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. This induces pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell
  death pathway for infected cells which limits viral replication and release. In
  addition, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 cytokines are produced, and cleaved to active
  IL-1β and IL-18 by Caspase-1. Such inflammasome activation is critical in an effective
  antiviral response. 5. NLRP3 activation is regulated by signals from cell surface
  Siglecs, if these are stimulated by Siglec ligands. An appropriately configured
  sialyl Tn or 3′SLacNac secreted glycoprotein would bind equally to Siglec-5 or Siglec-14
  as their extracellular domain is almost identical. 6. In a homozygous Siglec-14
  positive person such glycoprotein binding induces strong activation of the NLRP3
  inflammasome, while in a Siglec-14 null person this induces strong inhibition. In
  a person who is heterozygous, a more modest activation response occurs. Thus, an
  infected person who is homozygous Siglec-14 positive is more likely to mount a successful
  early antiviral response than one who is Siglec-14 null, with heterozygotes making
  an intermediate response.
