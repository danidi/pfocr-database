caption: 'Steroid hormone synthesis starts with acetyl-CoA and leads to the formation
  of (pro) vitamin D3 and cholesterol. Cholesterol-derived pregnenolone is synthesized
  from and is the origin of all steroid hormones. Cholesterol also gives rise to oxysterols
  (OS), important positive mediators of Hh pathway activation. Inhibition or mutation
  of enzymes involved at early steps of steroid hormone biosynthesis (asterisks) blocks
  cholesterol and (pro) vitamin D3 production, leading to defects in Hh signaling.
  Progesterone induces Ihh in the uterus, androgens upregulate Shh in the developing
  prostate, and estrogens downregulate Shh in the prostate and Ihh and Dhh in the
  uterus. In this issue of the JCI, Heine and Rowitch report that GCs can modulate
  the Hh pathway in postnatal mice (). Proliferation of CGNPs in the cerebellar external
  granule layer (EGL) is physiologically promoted by Shh secreted by Purkinje cells.
  This process is antagonized by binding of GCs to the GR, which also leads to CGNP
  apoptosis. GC antagonism of Hh signaling leads to neuronal injury and aberrant cerebellar
  development. Shh protects CGNPs via 11βHSD2, which inactivates cortisol, Cort, and
  Pred, but not Dex, suggesting that it is better to use 11βHSD2-sensitive GCs to
  avoid neuronal injury in neonates. GCs may exert their effects via interaction with
  COUP-TFII: the GC-bound GR stimulates COUP-TFII–induced transactivation, while COUP-TFII
  represses GR transcriptional activity (). COUP-TFII is also an Hh target and modulates
  the expression of IGF-1, which regulates GC metabolism through 11βHSD1. Positive
  and negative regulators of the Hh pathway are shown in green and red, respectively.'
