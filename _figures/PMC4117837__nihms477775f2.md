caption: The rate of formation of nascent adhesions depends on the ECM concentration,
  and the rates of nascent adhesion formation and turnover depend on the velocity
  of membrane protrusion. Nascent adhesions promote protrusion via Rac activation,
  either via a pathway utilizing βPix that is reinforced by positive feedback through
  PAK, or through a pathway involving DOCK180. Those nascent adhesions that are not
  turned over mature to form stable adhesions, a process that is reinforced by myosin-mediated
  feedback and attenuated by Src. Stable adhesions directly antagonize protrusion,
  disassemble over a relatively long time scale, and have a diminishing influence
  on processes at the leading edge as a function of their growing distance from the
  leading edge during protrusion.
