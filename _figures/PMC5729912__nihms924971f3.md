caption: Diacetylspermine (DAS) has a role in biofilm-associated colon cancer. Various
  metabolomic and orthogonal biological techniques contributed to the association
  of DAS with bacterial biofilms and their role in the pathology of cancer. Fluorescence
  in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing identified the presence
  of bacterial species and biofilms on colon tissues. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics
  identified and validated the association of polyamine metabolites with colon cancer
  tissues. Stratification by biofilm status showed that DAS was upregulated primarily
  in biofilm-associated tissues, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry imaging.
  Network modelling using the KEGG and BioCyc databases, and pathway analysis using
  untargeted stable-isotope assisted metabolomics, showed that DAS is an end-product
  of polyamine metabolism. For further analysis, orthogonal techniques were used.
  Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence revealed increased cellular proliferation
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines in biofilm-associated tissues. The combination of
  these techniques led to the conclusion that bacterial biofilms induce a pro-carcinogenic
  state in the colon epithelium.
