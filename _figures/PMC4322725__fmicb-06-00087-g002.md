caption: Post-translational modifications controlling various infectious cycle steps
  of Legionella pneumophila. Immediatly after uptake of the bacteria, L. pneumophila
  secretes a high number of Dot/Icm effectors into the host cell cytosol. (1) L. pneumophila
  exploits the host prenylation apparatus to alkylate some of these effectors and
  target them to the LCV surface. The effector LubX is able to ubiquitinate some effectors
  thus addressing them to proteasomal degradation and controlling their temporal presence
  on the LCV during infection. (2) Four Dot/Icm effectors reversibly AMPylate and
  phosphocholinate the host Rab1 small GTPase, thus controlling its activity to promote
  ER recruitment on the LCV, a prerequisite feature to make the phagosome a replicative
  niche. SidC and its paralog SdcA monoubiquitinate Rab1 and catalyze polyubiquitin
  chains formation necessary for ER recruitment on the LCV. (3) The Dot/Icm effector
  AnkB functions as a platform for the docking of polyubiquitinated proteins to the
  LCV membrane, thus promoting proteasome-mediated generation of free amino acids
  essential as energy and carbon sources for L. pneumophila intracellular proliferation.
  (4) The Dot/Icm effector LegK1 phosphorylates IκB thus mimicking the host IKKs,
  and triggering the activation of the NF-κB pathway and the transcription of NF-κB
  dependent genes. (5) The Dot/Icm effector LegAS4/RomA trigger the methylation of
  the histone H3, thus inducing epigenetic changes and subsequent transcriptional
  control of host genes. (6) Several Dot/Icm effectors exhibits glycosidase activity
  toward eEF1A, thus inhibiting the host cell translation.
