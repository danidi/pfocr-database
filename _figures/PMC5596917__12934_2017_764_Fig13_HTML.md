caption: Speculated regulatory mechanism of dissolved oxygen tension in B. subtilis
  cells. When the DO concentration decreased (left) ResE can activate ResD, a regulatory
  protein that can regulate the expression of genes fnr, narK, J, I, H, G and so on.
  Global regulator FNR was speculated to be responsible for the down-regulated ykgB
  and up-regulated alsS, which lead to decreased flux through PP pathway, lower riboflavin
  production and increased flux through glycolysis and overflow metabolism. Nitrate
  accepted more electrons as genes narK, J, I, H, G were activated. When the DO concentration
  was high enough (right) ResE will dephosphorylate ResD and enough oxygen molecules
  can maintain the normal operation of electron transport chain
