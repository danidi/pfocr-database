caption: ATF6α directly induces the expression of CIP2A, which interacts with and
  stabilizes c‐Myc protein. As a direct target of ATF6α, XBP1 also contributes to
  sustain c‐Myc expression. Meanwhile, ATF6α interactor Yin Yang 1 transcription factor
  has been shown to associate with c‐Myc, but whether these two proteins interact
  with each other is not known (denoted as red dashed line).
