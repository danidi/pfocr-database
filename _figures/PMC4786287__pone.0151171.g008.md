caption: Levels of metabolites from the γ-glutamyl cycle were analyzed in whole ACP
  KD and MECR OX cells and their respective controls using metabolomics, which included
  UHLC/MS/MS and GC/MS, as described in Experimental Procedures. Gamma-glutamyl cycle
  intermediates that were identified are indicated with arrows and a corresponding
  box plot. Y-axes for box plots indicate scaled intensity. Direction of metabolite
  level change compared to control in ACP KD cells is indicated by gray arrows, and
  direction of metabolite level change relative to control in MECR OX is indicated
  by blue arrows. In box plots, metabolite levels are shown for ACP KD cells, MECR
  OX cells, and their respective controls. For each box, n = 6 and open circles indicate
  extreme data points.
