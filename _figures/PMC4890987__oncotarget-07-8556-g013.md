caption: During the aging process, ATF4 and STMN1 are involved in the MAPK signaling
  pathway, and SMAD4, LEF1, and LRRFIP2 play key roles in the Wnt signaling pathway.
  Since these genetic and epigenetic regulation observed cannot overcome the dysfunction
  due to accumulated genetic mutations during the aging process, the transcription
  factor ATF4 can be activated and LEF1 can be inhibited by a wide variety of stress
  signals, including the MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways. This results in deregulation
  of various cellular responses, including cell cycle, apoptosis, metabolism, cell
  communication, cell transport, biological regulation, and response to stimulus.
  In this figure, the light blue blocks represent the proteins involved in the indicated
  pathways, the deep green nodes represent the TFs, the deep blue blocks represent
  the TFs target genes, the light green nodes represent the miRNAs, the red nodes
  represent DNA methylation of genes, the yellow nodes represent the mutation of genes,
  arrows represent activation of proteins, and the link represents interaction between
  these two proteins.
