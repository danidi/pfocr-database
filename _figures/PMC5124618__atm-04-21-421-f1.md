caption: Changes in the VE response to inflammatory stimuli during sepsis. The resting
  vascular endothelium is shown on the left in its natural state. As shown on the
  right, sepsis produces profound changes that convert the endothelium to a procoagulant
  state. This disrupted endothelium expedites the loss of fluid through disengaged
  tight junctions and expedites the recruitment, attachment and extravasation of inflammatory
  cells through the endothelium. Activation of the coagulation cascade potentiates
  inflammation and completes a vicious cycle in which inflammation induces and exacerbates
  coagulopathies and endothelial injury. Only some of the signaling molecules involved
  in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity are shown in the figure. Others that
  play important roles include Angpt/Tie2 signaling, the ACE2/angiotensin-(-)/Mas
  signaling axis, C3a/C5a, RhoA/Rac1 GTPases, matrix metalloproteinases, and S1P1.
