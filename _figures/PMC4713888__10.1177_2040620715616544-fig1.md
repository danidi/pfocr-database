caption: 'Immune evasion mechanisms seen in acute leukemia.Multiple immune pathways
  and functions are targeted by acute leukemia. Leukemic blasts directly and indirectly
  inhibit the host’s immune response by inducing phenotypic changes in T cells and
  NK cells by: modifying milieu toward hostile environment for immune system to function;
  inducing suppressor cells; and promoting immune checkpoint and coinhibitory pathways.
  The magnitude to which each pathway contributes to leukemia’s immune escape ability
  remains to be elucidated. Studies are mostly done in AML and immune evasion mechanisms
  applicable to ALL are less well understood.ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; AML,
  acute myeloblastic leukemia; CD4/8, costim, costimulatory; GITR, glucocorticoid-induced
  tumor necrosis factor-related protein; IDO, indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase; KIR, killer
  immunoglobulin-like receptor; LAG3, lymphocyte-activation gene 3; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MIC, major immunogene complex;
  NK, natural killer; NKG2D, natural killer group 2, member D; NOS, nitric oxide synthase;
  PD1, programmed death 1; PD-L1, programmed death–ligand 1; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; TIM3, T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain
  3; Treg, regulatory T cell.'
