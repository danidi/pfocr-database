caption: Negative regulation of AChR clustering by Wnt3a. Muscle Wnt3a initiates a
  Wnt signaling pathway in the muscle that leads to decreased Rapsyn levels. This
  is achieved through the β-catenin-mediated negative regulation of rapsyn gene expression,
  and decreased Rapsyn levels result in the destabilization and dispersal of AChR
  clusters. In addition, Wnt3a, via β-catenin, also triggers an unknown retrograde
  signal that affects presynaptic function and/or assembly.
