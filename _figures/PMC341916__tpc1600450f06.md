caption: Phylogenetic Relationships of PAC1 and MP1 Homologs.Three major clades of
  PAC1 and MP1 homologs are apparent. The PAC1 clade consists of PAC1, AN11, and TTG1.
  The MP1 clade contains MP1, ATAN11A, and ATAN11B. A third clade consists of animal
  species within a grouping of non-plant species. The consensus unrooted tree is depicted,
  with leaf and branch lengths representing distance derived from maximum likelihood
  analysis. Leaves that were minimal in length have been exaggerated to emphasize
  position on branches. Five hundred trees were generated by bootstrapping. Number
  of trees supporting each branch point is as presented in the key, with the exception
  that branch points with <250 supporting trees are unmarked. The bar indicates a
  length representing 0.3 amino acid substitutions per site.
