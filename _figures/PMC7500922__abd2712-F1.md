caption: (A) In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PD-1 is glycosylated at residues N49
  and N74, which are subsequently fucosylated (red triangle) in the Golgi apparatus,
  resulting in sustained expression of PD-1 at the cell membrane and transmission
  of inhibitory signals. Genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of Fut8 fucosyltransferase
  decreases PD-1 fucosylation, expression, and inhibitory signaling, resulting in
  increased T cell activation. (B) FBXO38 ubiquitin ligase mediates a K48-linked ubiquitination
  of PD-1 at K233, resulting in PD-1 internalization and proteasomal degradation.
  Genetic ablation or down-regulation of FBXO38 results in increased PD-1 expression,
  leading to enhanced inhibitory signaling and T cell suppression. (C) Expression
  of PD-L1 in tumor cells is stabilized by glycosylation. This is antagonized by GSK3β,
  which binds to the nonglycosylated form of PD-L1, leading to phosphorylation at
  T180 and S184, and β-TrCP–mediated PD-L1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
  EGFR-mediated signals inhibit GSK3β-mediated PD-L1 phosphorylation and degradation
  and promote PD-L1 stabilization and immunosuppressive function. Antibodies targeting
  glycosylated PD-L1 (anti–gPD-L1) block interaction with PD-1 and induce PD-L1 internalization
  and degradation. (D) In cancer cells, TNFR (TNF receptor)–mediated signaling results
  in IKKβ (inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase β)–mediated p65 activation and nuclear
  translocation, leading to transcription of CSN5, which stabilizes PD-L1 by direct
  deubiquitination or by inhibiting PD-L1 ubiquitination, resulting in enhanced immunosuppressive
  activity. CMTM4/6 associates with PD-L1 at the cell surface, reducing its ubiquitination
  and increasing the half-life of PD-L1 protein.
