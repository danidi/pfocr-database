caption: 'Clearance of AICAR through the de novo purine synthesis pathway limits effectiveness
  of AICAR as an AMPK activator in skeletal muscle. Co-therapy with AICAR and MTX
  may overcome these limitations by reducing the threshold for AMPK activation in
  skeletal muscle. Underlying mechanisms include diminished ZMP clearance and energy
  deprivation. However, other ATIC-independent mechanisms are likely involved. AICA:
  5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide, GART: glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase,
  IMP: inosine monophosphate, PRPP: 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate.'
