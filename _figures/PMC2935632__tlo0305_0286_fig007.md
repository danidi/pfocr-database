caption: Schemes of the opposing responses of p53 after lupulone treatment in SW620
  and SW480 cells. (A) In SW620 cells, lupulone induced apoptosis by activating the
  extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway involving TRAIL-DR4/DR5 receptors and caspases
  activation []. In these cells, p53 plays a proapoptotic role. Lupulone upregulated
  p53 transcription and protein expression; p53 accumulated in the nucleus, where
  it enhanced the transcription of TRAIL-DR5 gene, which amplified the apoptotic response
  triggered by lupulone. Inhibition of p53 by PFT-α caused only a limited decrease
  of cell death because TRAIL-DR4 receptor expression remained unaffected by p53 activation.
  (B) In SW480 cells, lupulone induced apoptosis by activating both the extrinsic
  and intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic signaling pathways involving TRAIL-DR4/DR5
  receptors and caspases activation [9]. As opposed to SW620 cells, p53 played the
  role of a survival factor in SW480 cells. Indeed, activation of p53 by lupulone
  caused a down-regulation of TRAIL-DR4 and -DR5 expression and a translocation of
  p53 from the nucleus to the cytosol associated with an up-regulation of the antiapoptotic
  Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins favoring a protective effect on mitochondrial function.
  These prosurvival effects of p53 were reversed by PFT-α, which caused a blocking
  of p53 in the nucleus enhancing its proapoptotic effects.
