caption: Data from our laboratory shows that organic anion transporting polypeptide
  1a4 (Oatp1a4) facilitates brain delivery of drugs that may exhibit neuroprotective
  efficacy in treatment of cerebral hypoxia/ischemia. The transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β) signaling pathway regulates Oatp1a4 functional expression and may offer
  an opportunity to “control” Oatp1a4 expression/activity via small-molecule inhibition
  of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5). We also propose that nanotechnology-based
  delivery vehicles may offer unique advantages in the CNS penetration of therapeutics.
  Blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cell receptors can be targeted for transcytosis
  of nanoparticles via attachment of specific ligands (i.e., transferrin).
