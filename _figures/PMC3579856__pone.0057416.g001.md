caption: Biosynthesis of mucin O-glycans is initiated by the addition of GalNAc to
  ser or thr of the peptide as catalyzed by polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases
  (GALNTs). This is followed by the addition of Gal in β1-3 linkage to GalNAc as catalyzed
  by C1GALT1 enzyme and produces core-1. Core 2 is generated by adding GlcNAc in β1-6
  linkage to GalNAc by GCNTs. To synthesize sLea, Gal is transferred to GlcNAc in
  β1-3 linkage to form type 1 chain as catalyzed by B3GALTs, followed by the addition
  of α2-3NeuAc to Gal as catalyzed by ST3GALTs and then α4-fucose (Fuc) to GlcNAc
  as catalyzed by α3/4FUTs.
