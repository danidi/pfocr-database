caption: Pathways of β-oxidation. β-oxidation is the catabolic pathway that occurs
  in mitochondria and produces energy from TG hydrolysis. (1) FFA are transformed
  to Acyl-CoA in cytosol; (2) protein Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase-1 (CPT1) catalizes
  the transfer of the acyl group of a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA to carnitine to form
  acylcarnitines (mainly Palmitoylcarnitine); (3) Carnitine Acyltranferase (CACT)
  transfers acylcarnitine across outer mitochondrial membrane; (4) Carnitine Palmitoyl
  Transferase-2 (CPT2) reconverts acylcarnitine in acylCoA and carnitine; (5) Acyl-CoA
  enters in β-oxidation cycle and is degraded in several Acetyl-CoA molecules; (6)
  Acetyl-CoA enters in Krebs cycle to produce energy as Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).
