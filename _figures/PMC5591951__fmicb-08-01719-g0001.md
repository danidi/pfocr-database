caption: Model of how FPR2 promotes harmful inflammation in a time scale manner. At
  early stages post-infection, Annexin A1 incorporated into IAV, activates FPR2 leading
  to (i) an anti-inflammatory state, which impairs host immune response and provides
  the mean for IAV to replicate. In addition (ii), FPR2-signaling activates the ERK
  pathway, further increasing IAV replication. Altogether, IAV replication fosters
  PRR activation, leading to a dysregulated and excessive innate immune response.
  During the time course of infection, infected cells undergo apoptosis, leading to
  the release of mitochondrial formylated peptides. In addition, proteases are released
  in a large amount by leucocytes that are recruited to the site of infection. Those
  proteases cleave Annexin A1 incorporated into IAV. FPR2, which is then activated
  by formylated peptides and cleaved Annexin A1 turns pro-inflammatory. This further
  contributes at later stages post-infection to increased inflammation and IAV pathogenesis.
