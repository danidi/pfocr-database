caption: Proposed model for the functional connection of the Pbs2-Hog1 MAPK pathway
  with the fungal two-component system in C. neoformans. Under normal conditions,
  the Hog1 MAPK is constitutively phosphorylated (inactive form) via the Pbs2 MAPKK
  and an unknown MAPKKK. Phosphorylated Hog1 MAPK functions to repress capsule and
  melanin production and sexual development under normal growth conditions. Because
  the Tco1 and Tco2 sensor kinases do not significantly affect the constitutive phosphorylation
  of Hog1, another sensor or internal signaling enables Ssk1 to trigger constitutively
  phosphorylate the Hog1 MAPK. In response to diverse stresses or exposure to the
  antifungal drug fludioxonil or the toxic metabolic by-product MG, a variety of sensor
  kinases, including Tco1 and Tco2, or sensor-independent internal signaling further
  activates Ssk1, which in turn activates a Hog1-specific phosphatase to dephosphorylate
  and activate the Hog1 MAPK.
