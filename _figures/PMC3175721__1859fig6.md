caption: Models for context-dependent ICL repair during replication. Following replication
  fork stalling in the vicinity of the ICL, FANCD2–FANCI becomes activated and in
  turn orchestrates the repair of ICLs. The repair is initiated by XPF–ERCC1-dependent
  incisions, either 5′ to the lesion alone or by flanking incisions. Slx4 may help
  to target XPF–ERCC1 to the site of the ICLs at such structures. Following ICL incision,
  hSNM1A is able to digest the cross-linked oligonucleotide, leaving a single nucleotide
  tethered to the complementary strand. The initial incisions could be on either the
  leading or lagging strand. (A) Should the incision and processing reaction be targeted
  to the leading strand template, TLS gap filling would produce an intact template
  for the progression of the nascent leading strand, with a gap remaining in the nascent
  lagging strand that can be repaired/filled post-replicatively by TLS or HR. (B)
  Conversely, incision on the lagging strand would allow the leading strand to directly
  extend past the ICL lesion. Break-induced repair by HR can then take place to re-establish
  the replication fork. (C) In the situation when two replication forks converge on
  an ICL, most likely during late S phase, initial incisions could still be produced
  by XPF–ERCC1, with post-incision processing by hSNM1A. Where XPF–ERCC1 is impaired,
  the converging fork pathway might predominate due to the failure to initiate repair
  following the arrival of the first fork, but under such circumstances, we suggest
  that here Mus81 could be recruited as an alternative means of incising the ICL,
  generating a two-ended DSB. Following extension of leading strand synthesis past
  the remaining ICL adduct, HR can restore the replication fork through DSB repair,
  allowing completion of DNA synthesis.
