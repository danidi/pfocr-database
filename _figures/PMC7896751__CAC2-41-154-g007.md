caption: Feedback loop of S100A8 in TGF‐β‐induced EMT. TGF‐β in the tumor stroma regulated
  S100A8 expression through USF2 to promote EMT. If there were redundant S100A8 produced
  by stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, it would inhibit the USF2/S100A8
  pathway of tumor cells, and thereby inhibit EMT in tumor cells.
