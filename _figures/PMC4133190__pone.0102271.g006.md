caption: In Med1epi−/− keratinocytes, the expression of follistatin is decreased.
  Consequently, activin, which is not sequestered by follistatin, is increased and
  activates the MAPK signaling pathway in keratinocytes in endocrine and/or paracrine
  manners. As a result, the proliferation and migration of Med1epi−/− keratinocytes
  are enhanced, contributing to rapid cutaneous wound healing process. However, as
  the number of hair follicle bulge stem cells decreases in old Med1epi−/− mice, the
  promoting effect of follistatin down-regulation on epidermal regeneration is overcome,
  resulting in impaired cutaneous wound healing.
