caption: Proposed model of mifepristone for the treatment of adenomyosis. Mifepristone
  causes cell cycle arrest through inhibiting CDK1 and CDK2 expression and induces
  cell apoptosis via the mitochondria‐dependent signalling pathway in endometrial
  epithelial cells and stromal cells of adenomyosis. Furthermore, mifepristone inhibits
  the migration of endometrial epithelial cells and stromal cells through decreasing
  CXCR4 expression and restricts the invasion of endometrial epithelial cells via
  suppression of EMT process in adenomyosis
