caption: Diagram depicting the yeast PKC signaling pathway. The basic components of
  the cell integrity signal transduction pathway are depicted. Cell surface sensors
  transduce extracellular signals through a MAP kinase cascade to induce transcription
  via two main downstream regulators, Rlm1p and Swi4p, so as to respond to a variety
  of external cell wall stresses.
