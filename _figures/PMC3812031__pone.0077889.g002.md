caption: Many genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism were wound-regulated DEGs.
  For each biochemical step the number of genes regulated out of total number of clones
  representing those genes on the TIGR 10-K (version 3) potato cDNA microarray is
  indicated as a single or cluster of blocks. The colored blocks represent DEGs regulated
  at 1 hr (grey) and 8 hr (black) or both (checkered). Up-regulated DEGs are indicated
  by solid arrows and down-regulated DEGs are represented by dotted arrows. For some
  biochemical steps, enzymes were not represented on the array; no boxes appear at
  these steps. For complete pathway see Plant Metabolic Network (PMN; pmn.plantcyc.org).
