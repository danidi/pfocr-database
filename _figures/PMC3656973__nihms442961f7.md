caption: JSI-124 treatment activates the NF-κB pathway by phosphorylation (P) of NF-κB
  p65 protein, subsequent nuclear localization and IκBα degradation (Ub, ubiquitin).
  Once in the nucleus, phosphorylated NF-κB dimers bind to the promoters of IL-6,
  IL-8 and SOCS3 and begin gene transcription. IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA are translated into
  protein and secreted into the medium. SOCS3 mRNA is also translated into protein
  and acts as a negative regulator of JAK/STAT3, preventing STAT3 activation.
