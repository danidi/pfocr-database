caption: Schematic model of EGFR stabilization by cigarette smoke. Under EGF exposure,
  c-Cbl can bind directly and indirectly to the EGFR via phospho-Tyr-1045 and Grb2,
  respectively, allowing receptor ubiquitination, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and
  lysosomal degradation. Under cigarette smoke exposure, EGFR Tyr-1045 is not phosphorylated
  and Grb2 can no longer interact with EGFR; therefore, the receptor does not follow
  the same degradation pathway that is induced by EGF. Instead, the EGFR is stabilized
  at the plasma membrane and also traffics to a perinuclear compartment where it may
  remain active and contribute to prolonged signaling. Ub, ubiquitin; circled P, phospho-Tyr.
