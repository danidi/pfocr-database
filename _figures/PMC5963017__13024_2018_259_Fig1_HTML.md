caption: Pridopidine promotes BDNF/TrkB signaling and restores ER calcium levels in
  the corticostriatal pathway. a Shown is a schematic representation of the motor
  circuit in mammals. Motor cortical neurons project to the striatum and form excitatory
  (glutamate, green line) synapses with D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons (D1
  and D2, blue box). Inhibitory D1 receptor-expressing neurons make GABAergic connections
  (GABA, red line) with the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNr). In contrast,
  D2 receptor-expressing neurons follow an indirect pathway and send GABAergic projections
  to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). In turn, GABAergic neurons
  of the GPe project to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and excitatory STN neurons
  send efferents to the SNr GABAergic projections that innervate thalamus, and the
  thalamus completes the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry by sending excitatory
  projections to the motor cortex. b In the WT striatum, the huntingtin (Htt) protein
  facilitates axonal transport of synaptic vesicles carrying brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF) and glutamate to the active zone of cortical neurons. Released glutamate
  and BDNF bind to their targets on the postsynaptic density of striatal neurons,
  including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and tropomyosin receptor kinase
  B (TrkB) receptors, respectively. c In Huntington disease, mutant Htt (mHtt) interferes
  with the axonal transport process, disrupting normal release of BDNF and consequently
  TrkB signaling in the striatum. In addition, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium
  is also perturbed in the striatum during HD progression. d Shown is a proposed mechanism
  of action for pridopidine in the corticostriatal pathway. Treatment with pridopidine
  has been previously shown to improve both sigma 1 receptor (σ1r)-dependent BDNF
  release in neuroblastoma cells, increase striatal BDNF levels in HD mice and restore
  proper ER levels of Ca2+ via direct activation of σ1r in cortical and striatum co-cultures
