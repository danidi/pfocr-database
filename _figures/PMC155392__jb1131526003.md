caption: 'Predicted pathways for degradation, transport, and metabolism of chitin
  by M. degradans strain 2-40. Chitin in the environment is depolymerized to chitooligosaccharides
  (COS) by secreted ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC. Secreted CbpA may act as an anchor between
  the polymer and the bacterium. Once degraded, chitooligosaccharides are transported
  to the periplasm and degraded to GlcNAc and chitobiose by CdxA. Chitobiose is further
  degraded to GlcNAc by HexA and HexB. GlcNAc and some chitobiose are likely to be
  transported to the cytoplasm, perhaps via specific PTS transporters. Once in the
  cytoplasm, chitobiose may serve as a signaling molecule or can be degraded by HexC
  to form GlcNAc. GlcNAc may be shunted to cell wall biogenesis or modified and isomerized
  to form fructose-6-P, which is then metabolized via the glycolytic pathway. Abbreviations:
  OM, outer membrane; PP, periplasm; IM, inner membrane; CP, cytoplasm.'
