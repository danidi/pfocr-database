caption: 'Model of signaling mechanisms involved in protective effects of monophosphoryl
  lipid A (MPLA) in the medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL). Sepsis impairs  absorption
  in the MTAL through 2 distinct mechanisms: 1) by inducing an increase in ERK activity
  that decreases the basal  absorption rate and 2) by enhancing inhibition of  absorption
  by LPS by upregulating the basolateral Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88)-ERK pathway (, ). Pretreatment with MPLA prevents both inhibitory
  effects by stimulating a basolateral TLR4-Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing
  IFN-β (TRIF)- phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway that suppresses sepsis-
  and LPS-induced ERK activation. §Precise molecular mechanism(s) underlying the inhibitory
  signaling interactions remain to be determined but may involve MPLA-induced, PI3K-dependent
  inhibition of upstream signaling proteins that mediate sepsis- and LPS-induced ERK
  activation (see text for details).'
