caption: Sulfate assimilation leading to glutathione and phytochelatin synthesis is
  critical for cadmium and arsenite resistance in S. pombe. The diagram illustrates
  the biochemical pathway starting with sulfate and leading to cysteine biosynthesis,
  formation of glutathione and phytochelatin, and chelation of arsenic and cadmium
  by these cysteine-rich peptides. All genes of this pathway were identified in the
  arsenic and cadmium functional profiling screens, with the exception of three genes
  indicated by an asterisk (sir1, met10, and gcs1) that were absent from the deletome
  library used in these studies. These three genes were previously shown to be critical
  for cadmium resistance ().
