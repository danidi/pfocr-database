caption: Shear stress and atherosclerosis. Shear stress can activate IGF-1, TGFβ1,
  and PDGF, while increased AKT phosphorylation may be mediated by PI3K. The serine/threonine
  kinase p70S6k is believed to play a critical role in the regulation of protein synthesis
  and activation of VSMC differentiation via the PI3K–Akt-dependent activation of
  the mTOR pathway. PECAM-1 transmits the mechanical signal via VE-cadherin to VEGFR2,
  which then activates intracellular signaling via PI3K. PI3K further phosphorylates
  Akt, which leads to eNOS phosphorylation and subsequent NO release. Shear stress-induced
  phosphorylation of GAB1 and the association with SHP2 are essential for PKA activation,
  which increases NO production. Shear stress can induce VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selection,
  MCP-1, IL-8, TNF-α, interferon-g, VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-15. KLF-2 can be induced
  by LSS and inhibit the MAPK pathway via inhibition of JNK and its downstream targets
  ATF2/c-Jun, and the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. The suppressive
  effects of KLF-2 are attributed to inactivation of the proinflammatory AP-1 family
  of transcription factors by inhibiting phosphorylation and nuclear localization
  of c-Jun and ATF2, thereby reducing NF-κB-mediated transcription. LSS can increase
  MEF2 transcriptional activity via upregulation of the transcriptional activity of
  ERK5. MEK5 is activated by LSS and catalyzes the phosphorylation of ERK5, which
  results in activation of MEF2 and subsequent synthesis of KLF-2. ERK5 is a key factor
  that inhibits endothelial inflammation by ERK5 and TNF. TNF significantly increases
  NF-κB activity and VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression via Rac-1 activation and ROS generation.
  LSS increases intracellular antioxidant levels as a result of Nrf2 activation, thereby
  preventing excess ROS/RNS production. ROS are crucial for NF-κB signaling downstream
  of TNF and may also lead to the formation of NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing
  protein 3 inflammasomes, which activate both IL-1b and IL-18. Nrf2 is activated
  by HSS. Nrf2 prevents onset of a proinflammatory state via negative regulation of
  the MAPK pathway. On one hand, Nrf2 suppresses the upstream activators p38 and MAPK
  kinases 3 and 6, while on the other, it enhances activity of MKP-1, a negative regulator
  of p38 and JNK, by altering its redox state and promoting the catalytically active,
  reduced form of MKP-1, which leads to suppressed expression of the adhesion molecule
  VCAM-1. HSS, high shear stress; LSS, laminar shear stress; ROS, reactive oxygen
