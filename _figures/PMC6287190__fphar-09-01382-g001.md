caption: Classic and alternative pathways of bile acids synthesis. In human liver,
  two primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), are
  produced. Key regulatory enzymes in both pathways are shown. Microsomal cholesterol
  7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the first the rate-limiting step in the classic
  pathway converting cholesterol into 7-hydroxycholesterol, whereas the mitochondrial
  sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) initiates the alternative pathway by converting
  cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol, which is then 7-hydroxylated by microsomal
  oxysterol 7-hydroxylase (CYP7B1). CYP8B1 regulates the cholic acid synthesis in
  the classic pathway.
