caption: Schematic representation of the PGE2 triggered signal transduction pathways
  converging on HDAC5 and subsequently MEF2. PGE2 activates MEF2 through EP3 receptor
  and the βγ subunit of Gi/o proteins. One pathway implicates activation of PKD and
  concomitant phosphorylation of HDAC5. The phosphorylated HDAC5 is exported from
  the nucleus, which results in de‐repression of MEF2 and activation of the embryonic
  gene programs. In addition, hand in hand activation of Tiam1, Rac1, and PAK2 kinase
  occurs, which pathway also contributes to the nuclear export of HDAC5 and is responsible
  for synergistic activation of MEF2.
