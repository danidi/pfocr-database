caption: The speculated model of miRNA–targets regulatory network of soybean CMS during
  flower bud development. The up-regulated miRNAs and down-regulated mRNAs are in
  red and green, respectively. Solid lines indicate a pathway supported by experimental
  evidence in this study. Dotted lines show a speculated pathway supported by reports
  from literature. Pictures in left were morphology of anthers during flowering day
  in NJCMS1A and NJCMS1C, which exhibited anther indehiscence and dehiscence, respectively.
  Pictures in right were I2–KI staining of pollen during flowering day in NJCMS1A
  and NJCMS1C, whose pollen were sterile and fertile, respectively
