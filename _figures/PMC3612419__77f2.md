caption: Mechanism of activation and inhibition of Janus kinases and signal transducer
  and activator transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Upon activator cytokine binding
  to its receptor on cell surface (e.g., IL-6 receptor), JAK/STATpathway is activated
  (left) leading to sequential cell response. Inhibition of signaling process (right)
  is induced by a particularly inhibitory cytokine, JAK degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome
  system (Ub), dephosphorylation by cytoplasmic PTP1B or nuclear phosphatase (NPTP),
  or by inhibition the dimerization of STAT (adapted with modification from Escandell
  et al.,2008).
