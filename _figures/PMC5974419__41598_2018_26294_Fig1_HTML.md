caption: Ganglioside induction scheme. The mammalian ganglioside synthesis pathway
  (left), Drosophila endogenous pathway (middle,), and Drosophila transgenic pathway
  (right, in this study). Filled boxes indicate sugar or SA donors. In vertebrates,
  the first ganglioside, GM3, is generated from glucosylceramide (GlcCer) via lactosylceramide
  (LacCer). In the Drosophila endogenous pathway, GlcCer is modified by the mannosyltransferase
  Egghead and the GlcNAc transferase Brainiac. We induced GM3 expression using transgenic
  (Tg) constructs and by feeding an SA donor to flies. In addition, the CMP-SA synthesis
  pathway is partially conserved in Drosophila (see Supplementary Fig. ).
