caption: Potential mechanisms of NF-κB activation in T-ALL leukemic cells. TCRαβ and
  pre-TCR cell surface complexes are known to activate NF-κB in T cells and may do
  so in T-ALL as well, through constitutive signaling (pre-TCR) or MHC-coupled antigenic
  stimulation (TCRαβ). Intracellular NOTCH1 protein (ICN1) was shown to interact with
  and enhance IKK activity in T-ALL cells [] and to interact with and stabilize p50:c-Rel
  heterodimers in the nucleus of activated splenocytes []. The ICN1-induced HES1 repressor
  facilitates NF-κB activation by repressing the expression of the deubiquitinating
  enzyme CYLD [], a negative regulator of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Together with
  CBF and co-activators (CoA), ICN1 may potentially facilitate noncanonical NF-κB
  activation by direct induction of the NFKB2 and RELB genes [,].
