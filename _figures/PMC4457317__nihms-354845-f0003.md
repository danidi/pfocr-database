caption: 'a | The family of extracellular HH ligands, of which there are three in
  mammals (sonic hedgehog (SHH), Indian hedgehog (IHH) and desert hedgehog (DHH))
  bind to the patched 1 (PTCH1) receptor. This relieves the inhibition of smoothened
  (SMO) by PTCH1, and SMO sends signals through a series of interacting proteins,
  including suppressor of fused (SUFU), resulting in activation of the downstream
  Gli family of transcription factors: GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3. b| Loss of PTCH1 in patients
  with basal cell nevus syndrome predisposes them to basal cell carcinoma (BCC) development.
  Sporadic BCCs routinely carry mutations in PTCH1 and TP53, consistent with their
  having been produced by ultraviolet radiation and, in 10% of instances, in SMO.
  Other mutations have been implicated in BCC development, including genes that regulate
  skin colour, DNA damage repair genes, members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt
  and the Wnt pathways and FOXM1.'
