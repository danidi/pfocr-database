caption: 'Mitochondrial disorders in septic cardiomyopathy. Increased reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production may cause direct oxidative or nitrosative
  damage and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, leading to
  decreased O2 consumption and proton-motive force between the intermembrane space
  and the matrix (∆p). Reduced calcium (Ca2+) uptake by and increased Ca2+ leakage
  from the sarcoplasmic reticulum result in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload.
  Increased ROS/NO production, along with Ca2+ overload trigger the opening of the
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). This results in mitochondrial
  uncoupling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis from O2 consumption (i.e.,
  OXPHOS uncoupling) and a decreased ∆p. Altered mitochondrial cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) protein kinase A (PKA) signaling also promotes OXPHOS uncoupling and decreased
  ∆p. Decreased ∆p leads to ATP synthase (FOF1) inhibition and energy deficit. The
  mPTP opening and other mechanisms, as yet poorly described, induce externalization
  of mitochondrial components to the cytosol and the extracellular space that activates
  the inflammation pathway. Decreased ∆p, the presence of oxidized proteins, and externalization
  of mitochondrial components in the cytosol activate intrinsic apoptosis, leading
  to reduction in myofilament response to Ca2+. Although ∆p and the presence of oxidized
  proteins activate auto-mitophagy, RhoA-ROCK activation results in automitophagy
  failure. As increased ROS production, cytosolic Ca2+ overload and energy deficit
  activate mitochondrial biogenesis, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) disorders result in mitochondrial biogenesis
  failure. Overall, increased inflammation, energy deficit, reduced myofilament response
  to Ca2+, impaired automitophagy, and failure in mitochondrial biogenesis are the
  features of mitochondrial disorders in septic cardiomyopathy. ADP: adenosine diphosphate;
