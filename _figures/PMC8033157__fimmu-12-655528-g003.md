caption: 'Immune evasion by coronaviruses. The image schematically represents how
  viral proteins of Betacoronavirus (green: SARS-CoV, red: SARS-CoV-2, and purple
  MERS-CoV) are capable of inhibit different events of the immune response such as
  pathogen detection, IFN production, IFN signaling, and ISG functions. Each viral
  protein blocks one or more key signaling proteins. First, viruses modify their nucleic
  acids to avoid being recognized by cytosolic receptors. Viral RNA can be guanosine-capped
  and methylated at the 5’ end by SARS-CoV nonstructural proteins (nsp 10, nsp14,
  nsp15, and nsp16), allowing the virus to efficiently evade recognition of host dsRNA
  sensors (–). Viral proteins inactivate key intermediates in the recognition of pathogens,
  for example, RIG-I activation is blocked by SARS-CoV N protein () and M protein
  the latter is physically associated with RIG-I (). Additionally, other viral proteins
  inhibit different intermediate steps in the signaling cascade for the production
  of IFN, for example: ORF9b from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indirectly interact with
  MAVS in mitochondria (, ). Signaling through STING in the endoplasmic reticulum
  is antagonized by SARS-CoV nsp3 (). Viral proteins interfere with complex formation
  such as TBK-1, which is inhibited by SARS-CoV M and MERS-CoV ORF4b (, ). Also, SARS-CoV-2
  nsp13 and nsp15 interfere with TBK-1 signaling and IRF3 activation (). Phosphorylation
  reactions and translocation to the nucleus of key proteins in the signaling cascade
  are also targeted by viral proteins, for example, SARS-CoV nsp3, N, ORF3b and ORF6
  (, ). Viral proteins are even capable of inhibiting the function of transcriptional
  factors specific for the induction of INFs and proinflammatory cytokines. Proteins
  of MERS such as ORF 4a, ORF 4b, ORF 5, and M inhibit IRF-3/IRF-7 function and ORF
  4a inhibits NF-κB function (). Additionally, nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
  suppresses host gene expression by promoting mRNA degradation leading to a strong
  protein synthesis inhibition, including proteins involved in host innate immune
  functions (, ). The right panel shows how several viral proteins block IFN signaling,
  SARS-CoV ORF3a protein induces degradation of IFN alpha-receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1)
  (). SARS-CoV nsp1 significantly inhibited IFN-dependent signaling by decreasing
  the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 (). Additionally, SARS-CoV ORF6 protein inhibits
  nuclear translocation but not phosphorylation of STAT1, this occurs through the
  recruitment of karyopherin (α2 and β1) in the endoplasmic reticulum, thus preventing
  the translocation of the ISGF-3 complex to the nucleus (). Finally, coronaviruses
  inhibit the effector function of ISGs, for example, MERS-COV ORF4b antagonizes activation
  of the OAS-RNase L pathway through its 2,5–phosphodiesterase activity that degrades
  the products of OAS (2,5 oligoA) which prevent activation of RNase L (). Nsp3 encoded
  by SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the suppression of host innate immune responses
  through the reversal post-translational modification of proteins performed by ISG15
  (). For further details visit ().'
