caption: ERAD pathways and mechanisms of ERAD inhibition. As newly synthesized polypeptides
  are translocated into the ER, they are immediately recognized by BiP, which promotes
  substrate folding and solubility. They are then marked with an oligosaccharide precursor
  (GlcNAc2-Man9-Glc3), which is sequentially trimmed to allow substrate interaction
  with the lectin chaperones CNX and CRT. Specifically, interaction with the lectin
  chaperones occurs upon cleavage of the two terminal glucoses by glucosidase I and
  II and is terminated by removal of the last outermost glucose residue (GlcNAc2-Man9)
  by glucosidase II. At this point, natively folded proteins exit the ER, whereas
  partially folded intermediates are reglucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase
  (UGGT) and re-enter the lectin folding cycle. In order to prevent excessive accumulation
  of folding intermediates, unstable misfolding-prone substrates are processed by
  ER mannosidase I, which cleaves three to four mannose residues from the oligosaccharidic
  group and promotes substrate binding with the ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like
  lectins (EDEM). ERAD substrates are then retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm via
  the Sec61 retrotranslocon and polyubiquitinated. Substrate retrotranslocation is
  mediated by the p97 complex, which includes ubiquitin fusion degradation 1 (Ufd1)
  and nuclear protein localization 4 (Npl4). p97 ATPase provides the driving force
  for substrate extraction and shuffling to the proteasome. As shown in the schematic,
  kifunensine and eeyarestatin I, small molecules that function as ERAD inhibitors,
  block different steps of the ERAD pathway. Kifunensine inhibits ER mannosidase I,
  and eeyarestatin I inhibits p97 ATPase activity.
