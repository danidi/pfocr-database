caption: Hepatocellular processing of, and immune modulation by, the precore protein.
  The precore precursor protein (p25) is translated from the precore mRNA transcript,
  and targeted to the ER by an N-terminal ER signal sequence where it is processed
  N-terminally, removing 19 residues, to produce the p22 intracellular precore protein.
  Further processing following the secretory pathway results in a C-terminal truncation
  of approximately 34 residues to produce HBeAg (p17). The arginine-rich C-terminal
  domain is integral for DNA binding by the closely related HBcAg or core protein
  (p21). HBeAg (p17) self assembles to form dimers and RNA/DNA-negative capsids which
  can be secreted from the hepatocyte. In addition to the secretory pathway, precore
  protein may enter the cytosolic pathway, resulting in the envelopment and secretion
  of RNA/DNA-negative Dane particles, which potentially act as an immune decoy. Alternatively,
  precore protein has been detected in the nuclear compartment, suggesting the possible
  existence of a precore nuclear localisation pathway. Secreted HBeAg levels influence
  innate and adaptive immune responses. In HBeAg positive HBV, high HBeAg serum levels
  directly dampen the innate immune response by down-regulation of TLR2, which subsequently
  lowers TNFα levels and induces a low pro-inflammatory state. HBeAg also down-regulates
  expression of the CD86 co-stimulatory molecule, thereby regulating activation of
  the adaptive immune response. Conversely, HBeAg negative HBV equates to low HBeAg
  serum load, with no tolerance effect on the innate and adaptive immune responses,
  leading to the development of a high pro-inflammatory state. ER, Endoplasmic Reticulum;
  HBeAg, hepatitis B e antigen; HBV, hepatitis B virus; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNFα,
  tumor necrosis factor alpha.
