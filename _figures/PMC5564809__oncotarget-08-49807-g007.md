caption: (A) Analysis of miR-196b-5p expression with protein expression of SOCS1,
  SOCS3 and nuclear pSTAT3 in 8 CRC tissues. U6 was used as the control for RNA loading.
  miR-196b-5p expression levels were normalized to that miR-196b-5p expression of
  sample one. Loading controls were α-tubulin and p84 for the cytoplasmic and nuclear
  fractions. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P
  < 0.05. (B) Hypothetical model illustrating that constitutive activation of the
  STAT3 signaling pathway by miR-196b-5p epigenetic disruption of multiple negative
  feedback loops contributes to the maintenance of stemness and chemoresistance in
  CRC cells.
