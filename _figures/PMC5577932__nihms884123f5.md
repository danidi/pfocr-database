caption: The level of muscle ATP, a downstream indicator of glucose provision, was
  greater in non-survivors. The level of formate, a 1-carbon unit involved in anabolic
  biosynthesis, was also higher in animals that died. Higher levels of branched-chain
  (BCAA) and other amino acids (AA) in the muscle and serum of non-survivors support
  the hypothesis of an elevated degree of proteolysis in animals that died. In the
  anabolic environment created by glucose provision, these amino acids can be used
  as building blocks for other amino acids. The level of glucose was differentiating
  and lower in the liver of non-survivors and is reflected in a lower level of ATP
  level in pigs that died. In contrast to the muscle, the liver metabolite profile
  suggests that animals that died exhibited a lower degree of biosynthetic activity
  compared to animals that lived. This is evidenced by the lower levels of liver GSH,
  hypoxanthine (HX), AMP, NAD+ and NADP+ in non-survivors. All these metabolites arise
  from activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the pathway involved in anabolic
  biosynthesis. The lower level of glycerol, our marker of lipid breakdown, in non-survivors
  suggests that the degree of lipolysis was lower in non-survivors at baseline. Various
  metabolites that reflect tissue patterns were observed in the serum and urine. OXPHOS,
  oxidative phosphorylation; TMA, trimethylamine.+ = level of this metabolite was
  higher in non-survivors compared to survivors− = level of this metabolite was lower
