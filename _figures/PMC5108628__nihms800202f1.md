caption: Following virus infection, dsRNAs are produced in the cell cytosol as a byproduct
  of the virus life cycle. While dsRNAs activate PKR and MDA5, short (<200 bp) RNAs
  with a 5′ triphoosphate group activate RIG-I. MDA5 and RIG-I signal through the
  adapter MAVS which is located on the mitochondrial membrane. MAVS then signals though
  TBK1 and RIP1/FADD to activate the transcription factors IRF3 and NFκB, respectively.
  PKR is capable to activating NFκB. When activated, these transcription factors localize
  to the nucleus where they induce IFNβ and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are
  secreted from the cell and bind to the type I IFN receptor and recruit specialized
  immune cells to the site of infection. Dysfunction in certain nodes of pathway can
  result in autoimmune diseases (marked by red stars). Loss of the PKR inhibitor,
  P58IPK results in late onset of Type I diabetes (T1D), as does downregulation of
  the MDA5 inhibitor, USP18, or mutations in the gene encoding MDA5. Mutations in
  the MDA5 inhibitor ADAR may lead to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), while mutations
  in RIG-I and MDA5 may lead to Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS). Crohn’s disease (CD)
  has been linked to RIG-I dysfunction. Finally, loss of prolidase, which aids in
  the proper maturation and surface expression of the type I IFN receptor, is linked
  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
