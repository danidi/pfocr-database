number: Figure 6
caption: Gene network construction. Pathway in cancer in KEGG was confirmed in gene
  network construction. The relationship between PPM1D and the 26 differential genes
  is shown. Green and red round dots represent downregulated gene and upregulated
  gene, respectively. The gray represent added gene. The size of the dot represents
  the significance of the difference.
