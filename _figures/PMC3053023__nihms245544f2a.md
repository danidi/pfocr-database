caption: Figure 2a. Differential Activity of Hedgehog Pathway in Healthy and Injured
  Livers. Healthy livers express low levels of Hedgehog (Hh) ligands. Several types
  of resident liver cells are capable of producing Hh ligands, including hepatocytes,
  cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSC), natural killer T (NKT) cells, and
  sinusoidal endothelial cells. Ligand production can be stimulated by growth factors/cytokines,
  as well as by cytotoxic/apoptotic stress. Thus, diverse stimuli that promote liver
  regeneration/remodeling induce hepatic production of Hh ligands.Figure 2b. Differential
  Activity of Hedgehog Pathway in Healthy and Injured Livers. Healthy livers express
  low levels of Hh ligands (a) and relatively high levels of Hh interacting protein
  (Hhip) (b), which binds to Hh ligands, preventing them from engaging receptors on
  Hh-responsive target cells. During liver injury, production of Hh ligands increases
  () and Hhip is repressed, permitting ligand-receptor interaction and activation
  of the Hh signaling pathway in Hh-responsive cells. The latter include several types
  of resident liver cells, including NKT cells, cholangiocytes, progenitors and quiescent
  hepatic stellate cells (Q-HSC). Activation of Hh signaling in each of these cell
  types induces responses that contribute to fibrogenic repair. For example, Hh pathway
  activation stimulates growth of NKT cell populations and induces their production
  of pro-fibrogenic factors, such as IL4 and IL13. It also stimulates cholangiocyte
  growth and production of chemokines, including chemokines that recruit NKT cells
  and other inflammatory/immune cells to the liver. In addition, Hh ligands promote
  growth of liver progenitors and stimulate Q-HSC to transition to become myofibroblastic
  (MF)-HSC. The growth of MF-HSC is further stimulated by Hh pathway activity. Coupled
  with expansion of Hh-responsive ductular and progenitor populations, this contributes
  to the fibroductular reaction that often accompanies liver injury. Finally, Hh ligands
  activate liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, causing them to express adhesion factors
  and other mediators that contribute to vascular remodeling.
