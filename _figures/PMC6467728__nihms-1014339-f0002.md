caption: '‘Ins’ refers to inositol; the subscripts denote the total number of phosphates
  (‘P’), and the numbers in parentheses describe the positions of the phosphate groups
  around the inositol ring. Arrows depict metabolic steps, catalyzed by the following
  enzymes: IP3K, inositol trisphosphate 3-kinase; IPMK, inositol polyphosphate multikinase;
  INPP5, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; ITPK1, inositol trisphosphate 6-kinase/
  inositol tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase; IP5K, inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase;
  IP6K, inositol hexakisphosphate kinase. The enzymes that are the focus of this study
  – IPMK and IP6K - are highlighted in red font.'
