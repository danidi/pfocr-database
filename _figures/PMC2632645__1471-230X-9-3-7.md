caption: A hypothetical biochemical pathway that could explain the PON1 alterations
  observed in the CCl4-administered rats. Free radical-induced liver impairment would
  result in a decrease in PPARδ gene expression and, as a consequence, in PON1 gene
  expression. It would also induce an inhibition of ABCA1, a decrease in HDL synthesis
  and, therefore, a decrease in serum PON1 concentration. Serum lactonase activity
  would be decreased secondarily to these changes and, as well, due to a direct inhibition
  by free radicals. Intrahepatic PON1 levels would be increased as a consequence of
  a decreased protein degradation.
