caption: 'Panel a: Transformed cells constitutively produce superoxide (O2−·), which
  is involved in maintaining their transformed state and in controlling their proliferation.
  They also release transforming growth factor type β (TGF-β), which triggers neighbouring
  cells to release nitric oxide (NO·) and peroxidase (POD). TGF-β may affect transformed
  cells themselves to release these signals too (dashed lines). Through a cascade
  of biochemical reactions, hydroxyl radicals (·OH) are formed. These induce peroxidative
  damage to lipids in cell membrane, which then triggers intracellular pathways leading
  to apoptosis. Panel b: Detailed view of the intercellular signalling cascade, showing
  the two major pathways identified experimentally, the nitric oxide/peroxynitrite
  and peroxidase/hypochlorous acid pathways. In the peroxidase pathway, transformed
  cell-derived O2−· dismutates into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is by POD converted
  in part to water and in part, using abundant chlorine anions (Cl−), to hypochlorous
  acid (HOCl). Upon reaction of HOCl with O2−·, hydroxyl radicals are formed. In the
  peroxynitrite pathway, O2−· reacts with NO· to form peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−),
  whose conjugate acid (ONOOH) decays into NO2· and ·OH. Two modes of the peroxynitrite
  pathway can be distinguished, the autocrine mode with NO· derived from transformed
  cells themselves (dashed arrow) and the inter-culture mode with NO· provided by
  normal cells (solid arrow). Due to the short lifetime and hence a small diffusion
  distance of O2−·, all reactions occur predominantly in the vicinity of transformed
  cells, and the induction of apoptosis is highly selective to the transformed phenotype.
  Tumour cells produce superoxide too, but in addition also express catalase (not
  depicted) that abrogates the signalling and makes tumour cells resistant to the
  intercellular induction of apoptosis. Additional details on the signalling can be
  found in ref. .'
