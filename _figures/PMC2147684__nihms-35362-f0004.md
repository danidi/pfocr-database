caption: IGF-I leads to induction of multiple signaling intermediates down-stream
  of IGF-IR and IRS-1 ( □ ). For investigating signaling pathways involved in IGF-I
  mediated COX-2 expression, inhibitors to MAPK/Erk1/2, PI-3K/Akt, P38, or SAPK were
  studied. The results show that MAPK/Erk is the predominant pathway for mediating
  IGF-I-induced COX-2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells (bold arrow). HIF-1α is
  downstream of the IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling cascade, as previously reported (dotted
  arrow) []. However, selective inhibition of HIF-1α using RNAi, decreased constitutive
  COX-2 expression, but had no effect on inducible COX-2 up-regulation suggesting
  that other transcription factors are involved in IGF-IR medicated Cox-2 induction.
  In contrast, PI-3K and SAPK appear to function as negative regulatory pathways for
  COX-2 expression since selective inhibition leads to increases in constitutive COX-2.
  The P38 pathway is activated upon stimulation with IGF-I, but inhibition of this
  protein had no effect of COX-2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells.
