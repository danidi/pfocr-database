caption: Proposed role of stem-progenitor cells in leiomyoma pathogenesis. It has
  been proposed that a single myometrial stem-progenitor cell goes through tumorigenic
  transformation following a cellular insult and gives rise to daughter leiomyoma
  stem-progenitor cells, which proliferate, undergo self-renewal and clonally expand
  in response to steroid hormones via paracrine signaling from surrounding differentiated
  myometrial and leiomyoma cells. Pathways involved in the paracrine signaling have
  not been fully elucidated, but there is recent evidence for a critical role of the
  WNT/β-catenin pathway. Treatments targeting these paracrine interactions, or the
  stem-progenitor cells themselves, could not only treat existing leiomyoma, but also
  possibly prevent the development and growth of new tumors.
