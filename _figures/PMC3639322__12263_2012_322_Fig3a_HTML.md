caption: Core networks and time-dependent changes in gene expression during the development
  of diet-induced obesity. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to find core networks
  based on 332 high-fat diet responsive genes. Gene expression changes (log2 fold
  change) are shown on as red (+) or green (−). Blue lines indicate genes, which were
  altered in a time-dependent manner from 2 weeks to 24 weeks in high-fat diet-fed
  mice. a Network 1; Cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, hematological system
  development and function, cellular movement. b Network 2; Lipid metabolism, small
  molecule biochemistry, endocrine system disorders. c Network 3; Hepatic system disease,
  lipid metabolism, molecular transport. d Network 4; Inflammatory response, cellular
  movement, immunological disease. e Network 5; Hepatic system disease, lipid metabolism,
  molecular transpor (color figure online)
