caption: Antibody‐dependent mechanisms. (A) IgG3 antibodies can exert their function
  by being recognized through their Fc by Fc (fragment crystallizable region) γ‐receptor
  (FCγR) (1, 2) or by binding to specific surface receptors influencing their activity,
  as occurs with M2‐adrenergic and β1‐adrenergic receptors (3). (B) Antibody‐mediated
  disease may also induce the activation of the complement system via the classical
  pathway ending in membrane attack complex (C5b‐9) formation and chemotaxis of myeloid
  cells, allowing inflammation, fibrosis, and tissue dysfunction promoting hypertrophy
  and arrhythmias. C5aR, C5a receptor; TNF‐α, tumour necrosis factor‐α; TGF‐β, transforming
  growth factor‐β. Original image created with BioRender®.
