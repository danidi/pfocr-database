caption: Schematic overview of cytoplasmic 60S subunit assembly. The AAA-ATPase Drg1
  promotes release of the GTPase Nog1 and the exchange of Rlp24 for Rpl24 that in
  turn recruits Rei1. The J-protein Jjj1 (human DNAJC21) cooperates with the ATP-dependent
  Hsp70 chaperone SSa to release the export receptor Arx1 that lies close to the polypeptide
  exit tunnel. In a parallel pathway, Yvh1 facilitates the exchange of Mrt4 with P0
  to assemble the ribosome stalk. Recruitment of uL16 in concert with the GTPase Lsg1
  promotes release of the export adaptor Nmd3. Finally, release of eIF6 from the subunit
  joining face by SBDS and the EFL1 GTPase licences entry of the mature subunit into
  the pool of actively translating ribosomes. Proteins mutated in human disease are
  highlighted in red. DNAJC21 and SBDS are mutated in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome;
  uL16 is mutated in paediatric T-ALL.
