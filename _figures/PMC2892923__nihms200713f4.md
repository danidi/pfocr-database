caption: From gathered evidence presented in this article, HS is involved in several
  key functions regarding cancer progression. Cell metastasis depends on HS to provide
  P-Selectin binding so cells can adhere. As an antenna molecule, HS also plays a
  role in transducing signals from external growth factors by forming complexes with
  growth factor receptors. Additionally it is necessary for efficient activation of
  Heparanase, which is necessary for invasion, angiogenesis, and inflammation. By
  binding P-Selectins on platelets, HS also protects cancer cells from natural killer
  (NK) cell activity. Systemically, shed cell-surface HS can form paracrine signaling
  complexes FGFRs. Additionally, though not completely understood, cancer cells instigate
  circulating lymphocytes to upregulate heparanase activity; as an antenna molecule,
  HS is probably involved in this pathway as well.
