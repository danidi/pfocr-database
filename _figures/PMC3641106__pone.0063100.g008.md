caption: A) The early release of IFN-γ induces an increase of TLR9 expression in DC
  and primes cells to TLR9 response (1). The high levels of IL-12/IL-23p40 secreted
  by DCs down-regulate the TLR9 responses of monocytes/macrophages by modulating the
  TLR9 expression (2). On the other hand, TLR2 is used by macrophage population to
  produce TNF-α (3). B) In DCs, TLR2 regulates negatively TLR9-dependent IL-12/IL-23p40
  production by modulating signaling pathway.
