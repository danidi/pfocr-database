caption: Pathway and Regulation of ABA Biosynthesis.ABA is synthesized from a C40
  precursor β-carotene via the oxidative cleavage of neoxanthin and a two-step conversion
  of xanthoxin to ABA via ABA-aldehyde. Environmental stress such as drought, salt
  and, to a lesser extent, cold stimulates the biosynthesis and accumulation of ABA
  by activating genes coding for ABA biosynthetic enzymes. Stress activation of ABA
  biosynthetic genes is probably mediated by a Ca2+-dependent phosphorelay cascade,
  as shown at left. In addition, ABA can feedback stimulate the expression of ABA
  biosynthetic genes, also likely through a Ca2+-dependent phosphoprotein cascade
  (, ; L. Xiong and J.K. Zhu, unpublished data). Also indicated is the breakdown of
  ABA to phaseic acid. AAO, ABA-aldehyde oxidase; MCSU, molybdenum cofactor sulfurase;
  NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase.
