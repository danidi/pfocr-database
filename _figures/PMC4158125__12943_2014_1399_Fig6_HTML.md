caption: 'TQ induces changes in the PAK1-ERK1/2 complex conformation inhibiting the
  prosurvival role of PAK1. A. Without TQ, in cancer cells, ERK2 phosphorylates pPAK1Thr212
  (I). While an interaction between pPAK1Thr212 and pPAK1Thr423 is so far not reported
  (II), pPAK1Thr423 is known to induce the catalytic activity of PAK1 (III) thus leading
  to the activation of the prosurvival ERK1/2 pathway (IV). B. Upon TQ we observed
  massive conformational changes of PAK1 disrupting its scaffold function in prosurvival
  PAK1/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling and leading to the following modified signaling: ERK1/2-PAK1
  binding is reinforced preventing pPAK1Thr212 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 (I). This
  leads to an increased phosphorylation at the Thr423 site (II) which impairs the
  interference with the catalytic domain of PAK1 and prevents PAK1 activation (III)
  finally resulting in apoptosis induction (IV).'
