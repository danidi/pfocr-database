caption: ( a) NiV infection is followed by the production of viral RNA, which activates
  TLR and RLR pathways in the cell, leading to the activation of IFN-I and IFN-stimulated
  genes (ISGs). However, several NiV proteins could interfere with this activation
  at different levels. NiV-V disrupts MDA5 and LGP2 stimulation and subsequent RIG-I
  activation . Conjointly, NiV-C protein counteracts IKKα/β dimerization, important
  for the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 , while NiV-W protein prevents nuclear transport
  of phosphorylated IRF3/7 dimers . In addition, NiV-V protein inhibits RIG-I activation
  and its signaling pathway by binding to its caspase activation and recruitment domain
  (CARD) following anterior binding to TRIM25 that prevents further RIG-I ubiquitination
  . Finally, experiments using a live virus NiV deficient in M gene expression highlighted
  the effect of NiV-M in the degradation of TRIM6 and disruption of IKKε ubiquitination
  (Ub), oligomerization, and subsequent phosphorylation (P) by preventing synthesis
  of K48-linked unanchored polyubiquitin chains . ( b) NiV-induced production of IFN-I
  leads to the stimulation of IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) and subsequent anti-viral signaling,
  which could be disrupted by several NiV proteins. NiV-N could inhibit nuclear import
  of STAT1/2 dimer , while NiV-M triggers degradation of TRIM6 and disrupts subsequent
  IKKε, TBK1, and STAT1/2 phosphorylation , as described in (a). In addition, experiments
  using live virus demonstrated that NiV-P and V could interfere with STAT1 and STAT2
  phosphorylation ,  while NiV-W prevents their nuclear exportation . Those mechanisms,
  combined, constitute the immune evasion strategy displayed during NiV infection,
  allowing an efficient host invasion. Inhibitory mechanisms presented by underlined
  NiV proteins correspond to studies published after 2016.
