caption: Hypothesized mechanisms of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor
  action in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Rprinted from []. Copyright 2012 with
  permission from Elsevier. (A) during the recovery phase of nephrotoxicant-induced
  tubular injury, the mTOR pathway in proximal tubular cells is activated to promote
  cell proliferation; (B) everolimus treatment exerts antiproliferative effects by
  blocking cell survival pathways. The quantification of urinary LC3 protein could
  be beneficial in predicting outcomes of treatment with mTOR inhibitors [].
