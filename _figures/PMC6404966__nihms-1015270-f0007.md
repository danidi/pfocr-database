caption: (A) Healthy tissues are generally non-responsive to agonist DR5 therapy because
  they express no or very low level of FOLR1, thus DR5 oligomerization and activation
  is very minimal.(B) In heterogeneous FOLR1 expressing OvCa cells in vitro, FOLR1
  acts as an anchoring ligand to recruit BaCa antibody close to DR5 antigen at cell
  surface in an avidity-optimized manner. This induces a high level of DR5 clustering
  and activation of apoptotic pathway in both “cis” and “trans” manner selectively
  in FOLR1+ OvCa cells.(C) In-vivo, tumor associated leukocytes (TAL) express inhibitory
  FcγRIIB receptor, which is required for the activity of DR5 agonist antibodies.
  Once engaged via FcγRIIB, the BaCa antibody additionally crosslinks the initial
  ternary complex (FcγRIIB-BaCa-DR5) via FOLR1 anchor into a high affinity stable
  quaternary complex (FOLR1-FcγRIIB-BaCa-DR5), which not only retains the antibody
  in the tumor tissue but also induces a highly superior TRAIL-R2 activation.
