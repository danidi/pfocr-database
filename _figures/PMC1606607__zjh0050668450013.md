caption: Potential signaling mechanism for ERK activation by lysoPC. Ca2+ influx from
  the extracellular stores induced by lysoPC exposure leads to uptake of the ion in
  mitochondria where it causes ROS production, possibly at multiple sites (respiratory
  chain complexes and TCA cycle dehydrogenases). Lipid peroxides generated as a result
  of membrane oxidation activate the ERK MAPK pathway. Impairment of electron transport
  with rotenone or antimycin A decreases mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and thereby attenuates
  ERK activation.
