caption: Direct and indirect mechanisms of action of metformin in cancer cells. Metformin
  induces antitumorigenic effects by both indirect and direct mechanisms. In the blood
  circulation, metformin decreases glucose levels and therefore insulin levels; insulin
  can act as a growth factor in tumor cells. For direct effects, metformin acts by
  AMPK-dependent and independent effects. Generally, metformin induces inhibition
  of the mTORC1 pathway, which involves an essential protein complex in cellular processes,
  including protein synthesis and cell proliferation; this complex also promotes tumor
  cell resistance to therapies. Furthermore, metformin induces cell cycle arrest by
  p53 activation.
