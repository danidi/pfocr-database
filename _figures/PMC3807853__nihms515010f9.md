number: Figure 9
caption: After binding to its receptor, IL-33 induces eosinophil activation, as measured
  by gene transcription and release of several mediators, through the phosphorylation
  of NFκB. Il6, Il13, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, and Clec4e are directly induced by IL-33 (IL-4-independent
  pathway). Although IL-4 transcription is not increased after IL-33 treatment, the
  protein release of preformed IL-4 is dependent on the IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway.
  Retnla, Ccl17 and Tfec induction by IL-33 is indirect and requires the activation
  of the IL-4/IL4Rα pathway (IL-4-dependent pathway) via the phosphorylation of STAT-6.
