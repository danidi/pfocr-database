caption: 'Summary of metabolic engineering performed for fatty alcohol production
  in E. coli. Genes that have been effectively inactivated (shown in red), overexpressed
  (shown in green) and heterologous enzyme expression (shown in blue) that have resulted
  in increased fatty alcohol production in E. coli. Cofactors are noted in particularly
  salient positions but are omitted from others for clarity. Note: these genetic modifications
  have not necessarily been combined into a single production strain. Abbreviation
  and gene names used are: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; R5P,
  ribulose-5-phosphate; X5P, Xylulose-5-phosphate; OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate
