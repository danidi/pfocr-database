caption: Successive steps in paediatric bone tumour progression. Hypothetical implication
  of the YAP signaling pathway. YAP (yes-associated transcription factor coactivator)
  plays a major role at various crucial steps during tumor progression. In pediatric
  bone tumors, the Hippo signaling pathway may be involved in primary tumor growth,
  tumor angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, intravasation, extravasation,
  cell survival, and metastatic dissemination.
