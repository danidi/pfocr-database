caption: Schematic summary of the results showing the consequences of mPGES-1 mediated
  PGE2synthesis for LPS-induced neuroinflammation. A, single intrathecal LPS injection,
  which simulates acute neuroinflammation, activates microglial toll-like receptor-4,
  causing a marked increase of cytokine release (i.e. TNFα and IL-1β). Via activation
  of their receptors they induce in microglia, neurons, or endothelial cells an up-regulation
  of COX-2 and mPGES-1 resulting in a selective synthesis of PGE2. Through neuronal
  EP2, PGE2 induces deleterious effects including neurodegeneration, excitotoxicity,
  or sensitization. B, if LPS was injected sequentially (24 h and 3 h before preparation),
  a situation of chronic neuroinflammation is mimicked. As a consequence, EP2 and
  EP4 are up-regulated in microglia enabling PGE2 to act via an additional pathway
  in microglia with a function as anti-inflammatory negative feedback regulator. As
  a proximate cause of this pathway, innate immune responses including cytokine and
  prostanoid synthesis induced by a second LPS injection are attenuated, promoting
  the resolution of neuroinflammation.
