caption: Proposed Model For the Convergence of Signaling Between mTOR and PPARγ Agonists
  in Endothelial Cells. In the absence of sirolimus, our results suggests that activation
  of PPAR responsive gene such as VEGF may lead to the activation of their respective
  receptors on the cell surface. This may result in a subsequent activation of the
  PI3-Akt-mTOR pathway that is necessary for VEGF expression and the reendothelization
  of bare and drug eluting stents. In the presence of SRL, inhibition of Akt signaling,
  through inhibition of TORC2 results in a reduction in VEGF expression and presumably
  a reduction in endothelial cell growth. Furthermore, our data demonstrates that
  mTOR is critical for PPARγ mediated gene transcription and SRL reduces PPARγ binding
  to its promoter, thereby reducing VEGF expression. Optimal transcription of PPARγ
  responsive genes requires Akt2 activation, but remains unknown if translocation
  of Akt to the nucleus or a downstream mediator is directly involved. RSG also modulates
  the mTOR pathway through inhibition of p70s6k which is independent of its effects
  on PPARγ.
