caption: PM2.5 treatment promotes pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis by inducing
  secretion of IL‐17A. PM2.5 inhibits autophagy of bronchial epithelial cells and
  promotes EMT by activating the TGF‐β signalling pathway via the promotion of IL‐17A
  secretion in γδT/Th17 cells, which ultimately aggravates inflammation and fibrosis

papertitle: IL‐17A‐producing T cells exacerbate fine particulate matter‐induced lung
  inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR‐mediated autophagy.
