caption: Simplified diagram of the potential pathways involved in the mammalian acoustic
  startle reflex and its modification by pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). There is a di-synaptic
  pathway from the cochlea to the cochlear root nucleus (CRN) and then to the medial
  facial nucleus (MFN) that innervates the posterior auricular muscle (PAM). There
  is also a tri-synaptic pathway from the CRN to the caudal pontine reticular formation
  (PnC) and then the facial nucleus. These are very short-latency pathways (thick
  black arrows). There is also a short-latency acoustic pathway which mediates PPI
  that is shown by the thick red arrows from the cochlea to the ventral cochlear nucleus
  (VCN), ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) and then to the CRN. Other pathways
  start at the cochlear nucleus and involve structures such as the periolivary nuclei
  (PON), dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) and the central nucleus of
  the inferior colliculus (CIC). The CIC projects to the external nucleus of the inferior
  colliculus (ECIC) which has connections to both the superior colliculus (SC) and
  directly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg). The SC may project directly
  to the dorsolateral facial nucleus (DLFN) but the main input to the DLFN is from
  the PnC. Thus the PPTg may provide a longer latency route (shown by the thin blue
  arrows) for mediating multimodal PPI.
