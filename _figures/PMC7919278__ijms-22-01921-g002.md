number: Figure 2
caption: 'Simplified scheme of IDO activity in immune regulation. IDO is expressed
  in various cells, such as APCs, fibroblasts, endothelial, epithelial, smooth muscle
  cells, etc., in response to proinflammatory mediators. Due to IDO activity, decreased
  levels of tryptophan activate the GCN2 kinase, which leads to T-cell anergy, T-cell
  cycle arrest and apoptosis. The deactivated mTOR pathway results in suppressed T-cell
  proliferation and differentiation. Increased levels of toxic tryptophan-kynurenine
  pathway metabolites induce effector T-cell apoptosis and promote Treg formation
  and activation. Abbreviations: Trp: tryptophan, IDO: indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase,
  APCs: antigen-presenting cells, GCN2: general control nonderepressible 2, mTOR:
  mammalian target of rapamycin and Tregs–regulatory T cells.'
