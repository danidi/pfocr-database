caption: Both medaka (A) and zebrafish (B) up-modulate the complement signaling pathway
  (IPA z-score 2.4 in medaka and 2.0 in zebrafish) in skin following FL exposure;
  however, only zebrafish induce both the classical complement pathway (yellow box)
  and the alternate pathway whereas medaka only utilizes the alternate pathway. In
  each plot, molecules shaded in green represent down modulated transcripts and molecules
  shaded in red represent up-modulated transcripts (Fold Change see ). Functions shaded
  in blue are predicted to be suppressed and in orange are induced.
