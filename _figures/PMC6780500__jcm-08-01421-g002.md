caption: Despite restoration of oxygen supply, a lower temperature during hypothermic
  machine perfusion (HMP) or subnormothermic machine perfusion (SNMP) of the liver
  seems to be associated with slower metabolic rates, thus there is a reduction in
  conversion of succinate to fumarate and reduction in overall electron flow through
  Complex I to inter-membrane mitochondrial space. Instead, the electron flow through
  the complexes is uninterrupted, which drives activity of adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) synthase for ATP recovery. Other pathways are suggested to help resynthesise
  tissue adenosine diPhosphate (ADP) and ATP, such as the purine salvage pathway.
