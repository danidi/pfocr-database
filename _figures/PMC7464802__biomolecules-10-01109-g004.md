caption: Intrinsic cancer cell response and intratumoral dialogue induced by chemotherapies.
  1. Senescence-dependent chromatin fragments, antimitotic-induced micronuclei or
  MOMP-released mtDNA contribute to proinflammatory secretory phenotypes in cancer
  cells treated by chemotherapies. Unprotected self DNA activate the cytosolic DNA
  sensor pathway cGAS-STING and downstream NF-kB and IFN-I signaling triggering chemo-induced
  secretome production. Chemo-induced necroptosis or ER stress (through intrinsic
  ligand-independent signaling) also promote a secretory phenotype. 2. Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, interferons as well as intrinsic (constitutive or inducible) Damage Associated
  Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) or DNA-containing exosomes can activate and recruit immune
  cells. 3. Antimitotic-dependent secretome increases NOXA expression and apoptotic
  priming via TNFα/IFN-I in cancer cells in a paracrine manner. 4. Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-6) from stromal cells (CAF) reduce apoptotic priming in cancer cells
  through IL-6-dependent MCL-1 upregulation. 5. Active caspase-3 opens PANX1 channel
  releasing metabolites that potentially contribute to proliferation, inflammation
  suppression, and wound healing phenotype in neighboring healthy cells. 6. Mitochondria
  or mtDNA transfer from endothelial cell to cancer cell or between two cancer cells
  can repopulate mitochondrial network in committed cells and restore respiratory
  functions. 7. Apoptotic debris activate efferocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine
  secretion by macrophages.
