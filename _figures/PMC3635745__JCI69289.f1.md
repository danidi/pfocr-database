caption: Antigen aggregation of receptors composed of membrane Ig (mIg) and transducers
  CD79a and CD79b leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of CD79 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motifs (ITAMs) (green) by Lyn/Fyn Src family tyrosine kinases. Participation
  of Src family kinases in this signaling pathway is negatively regulated by CSK-mediated
  phosphorylation of their C-terminal tyrosines. Phosphorylation of conserved ITAM
  motif tyrosines leads to recruitment of SH2 domain–containing effectors, including
  Syk, Lyn, and Fyn, and further activation of these effectors, initiating downstream
  pathways leading to cell activating (green arrows) and opposing regulatory signaling
  (red arrows). Among these proximally acting kinases, Lyn uniquely initiates both
  activating and regulatory circuitry by phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) embedded in cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins, including
  FCRLs, CD72, CD22, FcγRIIB, and other molecules. These phosphorylated motifs propagate
  inhibitory signals via activation of SHP and SHIP phosphatases. Lyn may also act
  through other intermediaries, e.g., monophosphorylated antigen receptor ITAMs, casein
  kinase 2, and components of the BLK/BANK1/InsP3 receptor complex on ER membranes,
  to trigger regulatory circuitry. Shown in red lettering are molecules in which certain
  allelic forms have been shown to increase risk of development of SLE.
