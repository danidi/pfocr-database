caption: Inhibition of myostatin (MSTN) and activin signalling by the soluble activin
  type IIB receptor (ActRIB). MSTN and activin signal to target cells by binding initially
  to the two activin type II receptors, ActRIIA and/or ActRIIB (also called Acvr2
  and Acvr2b, respectively) and then to the type I receptors, ALK4 and/or ALK5. The
  activated type I receptors phosphorylate the intracellular mediators of signalling,
  Smad2 and/or Smad3. Signalling through this pathway results in the inhibition of
  muscle differentiation and growth. The activities of MSTN and activin are regulated
  normally by a number of different extracellular binding proteins, such as follistatin
  and FSTL-3. The soluble form of ActRIIB (ActRIIB/Fc) can act as a ligand trap by
  binding MSTN and activin and preventing the ligands from binding to their true receptors.
