caption: Schematic model illustrating cellobiose-elicited action of ER stress and
  lignocellulase synthesis. Cellobiose, the major cellulolytic product by endo-glucanases
  (EG) and exo-glucanases (CBH), is transported by the cellodextrin transporters/transceptors
  CDT-1 and CDT-2. Cellobionic acid, derived from catalytic reactions of CDH and LPMO,
  is transported into the cell by CBT-1. Signals, derived from cellobiose, a modified
  version of cellobiose, and/or cellobiose interaction with CDT-1 and/or CDT-2 ()
  or other intracellular proteins results in the activation of downstream events,
  including transcriptional activation and gene expression, modulation of intracellular
  metabolism, and translation and secretion of lignocellulases. In particular, cellobiose
  signaling induces the activation of the Ire-1/HAC-1-mediated UPR pathway (), particularly
  proteins involved in translocation, folding, and protein glycosylation. Upright
  arrows indicate increases in protein abundance in response to cellobiose.
