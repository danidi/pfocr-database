caption: Illustration of the transcriptional changes of selected inflammatory TF pathway
  components during decidualization that represent the proposed STAT-to-NF-κB transition.
  Activatory STATs and repressory NF-κB pathway TFs are upregulated in the early phase
  and downregulated in the late phase. The late-phase release of NF-κB repression
  suggests autonomous NF-κB-mediated anticipation of progesterone withdrawal toward
  the end of the menstrual cycle. Late-phase upregulation of repressory NF-κB pathway
  decoy receptors (such as TNFRSFs) may constitute a distinct regulatory loop to counteract
  proapoptotic effects of inflammation. This late-phase effect is directly amenable
  for extracellular modification from other cell types such as trophoblasts and thus
  may be linked to maintenance of pregnancy. NF-κB indicates nuclear factor κB; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription; TF, transcription factor.
