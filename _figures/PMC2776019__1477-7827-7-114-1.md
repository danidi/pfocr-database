caption: The figure shows various cellular targets of radiofrequency electromagnetic
  waves (RF-EMW). Acute (short term) exposure to RF-EMW can stimulate plasma membrane
  NADH oxidase which can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Increase
  in ROS can stimulate endothelial growth factor (EGF) receptor which in turn activates
  extra cellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. ERK pathway consist of subsequent
  activation of Ras, Raf proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). MAPK
  pathway has tumor promoting role. Chronic exposure to ROS can activate various stress
  kinase (p38 MAP kinase). Activation of p38 MAP kinase can stimulate ERK pathway
  and also lead to phosphorylation of heat shock proteins (Hsp) which inhibits apoptosis.
  Inhibition of apoptosis might promote carcinogenesis by prolonging survival of cell
  with damaged DNA. Hsp also stabilizes endothelial stress fiber and alters secretion
  of bFGF. This can lead to increase in permeability of blood testis barrier and causes
  infertility. RF-EMW can also promote cancer by stimulating ornithine decarboxylase
  (ODC), a rate limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis pathway as well as by interfering
  with plasma membrane calcium channels.
