caption: NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Two steps are required for NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. The first step is priming, which is triggered by microbial molecules
  or endogenous cytokines and is required to induce the expression of pro-interleukin-1β
  (IL-1β), pro-IL-18, and NLRP3 via the activation of the transcription factor nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB). The second step is NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which includes
  canonical and noncanonical activation pathways and is induced by a number of PAMPs
  and DAMPs. The canonical activation pathway involves stimulation-mediated activation
  signals such as ion fluxes, lysosome rupture, mitochondrial dysfunction, Golgi apparatus
  disassembly, metabolic stress, and ER stress. Activation of the inflammasome causes
  caspase-1 activation, leading to the maturation and release of IL-1β/IL-18 and pyroptosis.
  The noncanonical activation pathway is mediated by human caspase-4, human caspase-5,
  and mouse caspase-11, indirectly promoting the production of pro-IL-1β or pro-IL-18.
  Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), FAS-associated death domain protein
  (FADD), and caspase-8 are involved in this pathway by regulating NF-κB activation,
  leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
