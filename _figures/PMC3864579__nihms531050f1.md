caption: 'During chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, virus-specific
  CD8 T cells are exhausted and B cells are not engaged in effective antiviral responses.
  (A) CD8 help. Adoptive transfer of LCMV-specific CD4 T cells into chronically infected
  mice rescues CD8 T cells. CD4 T cells may provide help to cognate CD8 T cells by
  licensing APCs. Activated CD4 T cells express CD40L, which crosslinks CD40 on the
  surface of APCs (i), and it may also provide direct signals to CD8 T cells (ii).
  (i) CD40 crosslinking on APCs induces an increase in MHC class I expression and
  costimulatory B7 molecules, which enhance antigen presentation and CD8 T-cell activation.
  (ii) Activated CD4 T cells secrete cytokines that directly enhance function of exhausted
  CD8 T cells (e.g., IL-21 and IL-2). (B) B-cell help. CD4 T cells provide help to
  cognate B cells in the form of CD40 ligation and IL-21. B cells that receive T-cell
  help in the germinal center reaction are selected to become memory B cells or plasma
  cells. Hence, adoptive transfer of LCMV-specific CD4 T cells can orchestrate and
  restore endogenous antiviral responses to promote viral control. (C) Pleiotropic
  antiviral effects. Increased production of IFN-γ and TNF-α (derived from both transferred
  CD4 T cells and rescued endogenous CD8 T cells) can recruit and activate effector
  cells from the innate immune system (e.g., macrophages, monocytes, eosinophils,
  neutrophils and NK cells). In addition, IFN-γ and TNF-α can have direct effects
  on infected cells, by inhibiting viral replication and also promoting cell death.
  Importantly, during chronic infections, exhausted CD8 T cells express the inhibitory
  receptor PD-1, and PD-1 ligands are ubiquitously expressed during persistent inflammation.
  Therefore, CD8 T-cell rescue is limited by the PD-1 pathway. In addition, CD4 T
  cells also express PD-1 upon activation and are not optimally functional in chronically
  infected hosts. Thus, blockade of the PD-1 pathway in combination with adoptive
  transfer of CD4 T cells results in enhanced function of transferred CD4 T cells
  and improved rescue of CD8 T cells that ultimately leads to superior viral control.
  Similar scenarios could also be envisaged for the treatment of other chronic infections,
  as well as cancer.For more information, please see [,,].pMHC: Peptide–MHC complex;
  BCR: B-cell receptor; TCR: T-cell receptor.'
