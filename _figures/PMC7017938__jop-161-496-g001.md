caption: Mechanisms of opioid activity in cancer. Preclinical and clinical studies
  demonstrate multiple signaling pathways and cellular effects stimulated by morphine
  and/or MOR, leading to progression of cancer and metastasis (left side). MOR directly
  and through coactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases for growth factors, VEGFR2,
  EGFR, and PDGFRβ stimulates mitogenic and survival-promoting signaling through MAPK/ERK,
  Stat3, and PKB/Akt in endothelial and/or tumor cells. Simultaneously, morphine activates
  S1P3R through Rho/ROCK pathway after the recruitment of p115 Rho GEF by MOR, leading
  to increased vascular permeability. Inhibition of NK cells and activation of mast
  cells by morphine further abrogates protective antitumor effects and simultaneous
  release of procancer cytokines and neuropeptides such as substance P, respectively.
  In addition, stimulation of COX2 leads to formation of PGE2, which has proangiogenic
  and pronociceptive activity and thus may even increase pain. Together, morphine/opioid-induced
  cellular effects and signaling pathways lead to endothelial and tumor cell proliferation,
  migration, invasion and EMT, immunosuppression, and increased vascular permeability,
  which is critical to tumor cell infiltration and metastasis, thus promoting cancer
  progression and metastasis. Although most of the strong evidence is from human tumor
  and endothelial cells and mouse models of cancer and metastasis, there are emerging
  data from clinical studies (mostly retrospective) showing the association of MOR
  with these signaling pathways and/or cellular activation in lung, prostate, and
  pancreatic cancer, leading to cancer progression and shorter survival. Conversely,
  antitumor effects of morphine/opioids through modulation of HIF1α, p38 MAPK, VEGF,
  MMPs, and TIMPs in endothelial and/or tumor cells lead to inhibition of cancer progression
  in mice. However, the only study in a clinical setting failed to replicate the preclinical
  observations on MMPs. COX2, cyclooxygenase 2; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  ERK, extracellular signal–regulated kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor;
  GPCR, G-protein–coupled receptor; HIF1α, hypoxia inducible factor 1 α; MAPK, mitogen-activated
