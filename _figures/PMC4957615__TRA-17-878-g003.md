caption: 'The role of actin and myosins in mammalian autophagy. This schematic diagram
  depicts the stages at which myosin motors and the actin cytoskeleton are thought
  to act in the autophagy pathway. Stage 1a (Initiation): Under conditions of low
  nutrients or stress, which is sensed by mTORC1 or AMPK, the ULK complex initiates
  autophagosome biogenesis. The ULK complex targets a class III PI3K complex that
  produces PI3P on omegasomes. Stage 1b (Expansion): NMM2A mini‐filaments and the
  actin cytoskeleton regulated by the WASH complex are important for the formation
  of ATG9 vesicles that cycle between the TGN and endosomes, and together with several
  other membrane sources contribute to expansion of the phagophore. The actin nucleator,
  ARP2/3, and nucleation promoting factors, such as WHAMM, induce a scaffold of branched
  actin networks inside the growing phagophore dome. The MYO6 adaptors and autophagy
  receptors – TAX1BP1, NDP52 and OPTN – may form the bridge between ubiquitinated
  bacteria or mitochondria and LC3 on the phagophore membrane. Stage 2 (Closure and
  maturation): LC3 is required for elongation of the phagophore and the closed autophagosome
  undergoes further maturation by fusion with endosomal compartments delivered by
  MYO6, which binds to endosomes via its adaptor protein, TOM1. MYO6 and associated
  endosomal cargo may be recruited to autophagosomal membranes by binding to autophagy
  receptors. WHAMM‐dependent actin comet tail formation and stabilization by cortactin
  leads to movement of autophagosomes. Stage 3 (Autophagosome‐lysosome fusion and
  degradation): Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes and the content is degraded by
  hydrolytic enzymes. Autolysosome formation requires the correct lipid composition
  of the individual organelles, which involves MYO1C‐dependent cholesterol‐enriched
  lipid raft trafficking, and a cortactin‐dependent remodelling of the F‐actin network.'
