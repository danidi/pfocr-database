caption: APOBECs-mediated RNA editing in cancer development. The color of the first
  arrow in each pathway indicates the mechanism (refer to Figure ) by which APOBECs
  regulates its direct targets, depicted in pink shapes. Dashed lines indicate suggested/unproven
  functions/relationships. CRC, colorectal cancer; PNST, peripheral nerve-sheath tumor;
  AML, acute myeloid leukemia. The figure was created with BioRender.
