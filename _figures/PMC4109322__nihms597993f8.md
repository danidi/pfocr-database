caption: Involvement of uPAR-β3 integrin signaling in calcineurin/NFAT activation-induced
  podocyte injury and proteinuria. Our in vivo results show that calcineurin-NFAT
  inhibition reduced proteinuria and inhibited uPAR expression and β3 integrin activation
  in NTX rats and LPS mice. Given recent evidence of the involvement of uPAR-β3 integrin
  signaling in podocyte dysfunction and proteinuria [, ], it is possible that the
  anti-proteinuric effect of CsA may be attributed to its inhibition of uPAR signaling
  in podocytes. The results from NFATc1nuc transgene mice, along with those from Wang
  et al. and Nijenhuis et al. [, ], suggested a NFAT activation-induced podoycte injury
  and proteinuria in mice. Importantly, the present results show that NFAT is able
  to regulate uPAR expression. All together, these findings suggest the involvement
  of uPAR signaling in calcineurin/NFAT activation-induced podocyte injury and proteinuria
