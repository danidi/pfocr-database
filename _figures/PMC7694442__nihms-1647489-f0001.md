caption: This figure summarizes the various mechanisms by which obesity is associated
  with asthma. 1) Obesity shares genetic influences with asthma and is also associated
  with DNA hypomethylation of promoters of genes associated with non-T2 immune responses.
  2) Obesity causes immune dysregulation with higher Th1/Th2 ratio or Th1 polarization
  and increased activation of monocytes with more patrolling and fewer classical monocytes
  in systemic circulation. 3) Th1 polarization and monocyte activation are inversely
  associated with pulmonary function deficits found in obese children with asthma.
  4) Whether obesity-mediated immune dysregulation links with pulmonary function through
  increased airway smooth muscle contractility is not known. 5) Although the mechanisms
  that underlie Th1 polarization and monocyte activation are not well understood (dashed
  arrows), upregulation of genes in CDC42 pathway have been reported; CDC42 causes
  preferential differentiation of naïve Th cells to Th1 cells and cytokine production
  and exocytosis. 6) Insulin resistance and dyslipidemia are the most common obesity-mediated
  metabolic abnormalities. Insulin resistance is directly associated and HDL is inversely
  associated with 7) pulmonary function deficits and 8) Th1 polarization found in
  obese children with asthma. Insulin resistance mediates the association of Th1 polarization
  with pulmonary function deficits. 9) Micronutrients are associated with pulmonary
  function deficits in obese children with asthma; while carotenoids and 25-hydroxy
  cholecalciferol are protective, n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio
  is associated with lower pulmonary function. Carotenoids are also protective against
  insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. 10) Together, these mechanisms are associated
  with pulmonary function deficits associated with obesity-related asthma.
