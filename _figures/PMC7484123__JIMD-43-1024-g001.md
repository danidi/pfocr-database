caption: 'The metabolism of hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is formed from
  cysteine by cystathionine β‐synthase (CBS) or by cystathionine‐γ‐lyase (CTH), or
  after transamination via cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) and the action of mercaptopyruvate
  sulfur transferase (MPST). Cysteine is also produced by gut bacteria. Cysteine is
  oxidized by cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) in the pathway to taurine synthesis. H2S
  is primarily oxidized by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) with the electrons
  transferred to coenzyme Q (CoQ), and with concomitant sulfur transfer to glutathione
  (GSH) to form glutathione persulfide (GSSH). GSSH is then oxidized to form sulfite
  by persulfide dioxygenase (SDO, gene ETHE1), which is further oxidized to sulfate
  by sulfite oxidase (SUOX). GSSH can also be converted to thiosulfate by thiosulfate
  sulfurtransferase (TST). Accumulating hydrogen sulfide can inhibit respiration at
  the level of complex IV. Other abbreviations used: CoQ is oxidized coenzyme Q, CoQH2
  is reduced coenzyme Q, Cytc is cytochrome c, α‐KG is α‐ketoglutarate, SO32− is sulfite,
  SO42− is sulfate, SSO32− is thiosulfate. MPST is variably localized in both the
  mitochondria and cytosol'
