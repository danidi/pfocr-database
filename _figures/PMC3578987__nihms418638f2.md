caption: Intrinsic, or mitochondrial pathways, and extrinsic, or death receptor pathway,
  converge to a common pathway involving the activation of caspase-3 by the apoptosome
  culminating in cell death execution. In type II cells, the extrinsic and intrinsic
  pathways are integrated through the cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 consequently linking
  mitochondria to the control of cell death.
