caption: A simplified scheme of pathways involved in the turnover of membrane lipids
  during leaf senescence followed by translocation of nutrients to sink tissues. Galactolipases
  release fatty acids from Galactolipid from thylakoid membranes in the chloroplast.
  Peroxisome produces Acetyl-CoA and Citrate. TCA cycle in the mitochondria produces
  the essential precursor of Phosphoenolpyruvate through oxaloacetate. The gluconeogenesis
  pathway in the cytosol also converts phosphoenolpyruvate to sucrose. Phloem translocate
  all nutrients, including FAs and sucrose to sink tissues like seeds.
