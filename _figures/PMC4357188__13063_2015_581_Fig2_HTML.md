caption: 'Pathways of guanidino compound synthesis. Legend: Guanidino compounds such
  as beta-guanidinopropionic acid, creatine, guanidinoacetic acid, gamma-guanidinobutyric
  acid, and guanidinosuccinic acid, are reported to be synthesized via transamidination
  of the amidino group from arginine as the major pathway, or through the urea cycle.
  Creatine biosynthesis involves two sequential steps catalyzed by L-arginine:glycine
  amidinotransferase (AGAT), and S-adenosylmethionine:guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase
  (GAMT) After [-].'
