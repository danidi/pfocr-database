caption: Role of SR-BI in HDL metabolism in vivo. HDL is thought to extract cellular
  cholesterol from peripheral tissues by a mechanism involving the product of the
  ABCA1 (Tangier disease) gene. After the plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) is esterified
  to cholesteryl ester (CE) by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (not shown), it can be
  transported to the liver by either an indirect pathway (transfer to other lipoproteins
  followed by hepatic receptor-mediated endocytosis, not shown) or a direct pathway
  via SR-BI and selective cholesterol uptake. The HDL-C in the liver can be secreted
  into the bile, either as cholesterol or as bile acids. The delivery of cholesterol
  from peripheral tissues via plasma HDL to the liver for biliary excretion as cholesterol
  or bile acids is called “reverse cholesterol transport.” SR-BI also can mediate
  HDL-C uptake by steroidogenic tissues for steroid hormone synthesis or cholesterol
  storage. Redrawn from refs. , .
