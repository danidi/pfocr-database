caption: Hepcidin regulation and action in non-cancerous tissue. The major regulators
  of hepcidin expression in hepatocytes are iron status, inflammatory signals and
  erythropoietic drive. Iron status is sensed by bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6),
  transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and hemochromatosis protein (HFE). BMP6 is produced
  by non-parenchymal liver cells (LSEC). BMP6 binds with BMP receptor (BMPR), which
  activates the SMAD pathway. Phosphorylated SMAD molecules induce HAMP (hepcidin
  antimicrobial peptide) expression. Inflammation induces hepcidin expression by activating
  the janus kinase 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3)
  pathway. Erythropoietic drive is a negative hepcidin regulator that acts by suppressing
  hepcidin expression through newly discovered erythroferrone (ERFE). Hepcidin mode
  of action is realized through induction of ferroportin (FPN) degradation in target
  cells, which causes sequestration of iron in cells.
