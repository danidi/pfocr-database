caption: Activation and de-activation pathways of hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic inflammation
  triggered by virus infection or immune-mediated mechanisms can initiate fibrogenesis
  by inducing apoptosis of hepatocytes. The released apoptotic bodies can activate
  quiescent hepatic stellate cells and transform them into myofibroblasts under the
  mediation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1), platelet-derived growth
  factor (PDGF), and endothelial growth factor (EGF). The activation process is fueled
  by the release of lipid droplets (autophagy). The apoptotic bodies from the damaged
  hepatocytes can also stimulate Kupffer cells to generate reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The ROS in
  turn can enhance hepatocyte apoptosis and continue the activation of hepatic stellate
  cells. Kupffer cells can also release ROS, cytokines and chemokines that contribute
  to the transformation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblasts. The
  myofibroblasts can also generate ROS and increase oxidative stress on hepatocytes
  by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase pathway and promote
  hepatic inflammation by enhancing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  adhesion molecules, activated T lymphocytes, and natural killer T (NKT) cells. The
  myofibroblasts generate the extracellular matrix which can be cross-linked by lysyl
  oxidases and rendered resistant to degradation by metalloproteinases (MMP). The
  reversibility of the extracellular matrix depends in part on the cross-linkage of
  collagen fibrils and the counterbalance of activities between MMP and MMP inhibitors.
  Myofibroblast activity can be attenuated by the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic
  genes which then favor myofibroblast apoptosis and the expression of the peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) gene which may contribute to hepatic
  stellate cell inactivation. Inactivated stellate cells are different from quiescent
  hepatic stellate cells in that they are “primed” to have a low threshold for reactivation
  by TGFβ1.
