caption: The proposed signaling pathway of this study. In RPE cells, UV radiation
  induces ROS production to induce an early ceramide production. Increased ceramide
  activates ER stress, which serves as an upstream signaling for AMPK activation.
  AMPK activation appears to be pro-apoptotic in this system. Suppression of this
  signaling axis by ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1, ER stress inhibitor
  salubrinal or by AMPK inhibitor compound C inhibits UV or H2O2-induced RPE cell
  death, while C6 ceramide and AMPK activator AICAR mimicked UV/H2O2’s effect. The
  role of MAPK activation in UV or H2O2-induced RPE cell death needs further investigation;
  also, the mechanism link between these pathways warrants more studies.
