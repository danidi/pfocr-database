caption: Schematic representation of I3M-induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon cancer
  cells. I3M is regarded as a cell permeable anti-cancer agent. It downregulates Ras
  activation and ultimately increases p53 levels in HCT116 p53+/+ cells. Increased
  p53 levels are associated with substantial ROS production in HCT116 p53+/+ cells,
  which ultimately stimulates CHOP-mediated DR5 expression. Additionally, I3M increases
  the expression of TRAIL, which ligates with its specific receptor, DR5, initiating
  the apoptotic pathway.
