caption: a | Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) controls brain development through maintenance
  of T-box brain 1 (Tbr1) gene expression or preservation of the Tbr1+ progenitor
  cell population. Loss of HDAC3 leads to impaired differentiation and migration of
  neural progenitor cells (NPCs), resulting in severe brain cytoarchitectural defects.
  b | HDAC3 controls glial cell fate. HDAC3 inhibits intermediate primitive oligodendrocyte
  progenitor cells (OPCs) and OPCs from undergoing astrogliogenesis, thereby promoting
  the formation of oligodendrocytes. HDAC3 inhibition of astroglial differentiation
  occurs through deacetylation and inhibition of signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 3 (STAT3), and by interaction with the histone acetyltransferase p300
  to activate oligodendrocyte gene enhancers,. Loss of HDAC3 decreases oligodendrocyte
  numbers and increases astrocyte numbers,. c | In the hippocampus, HDAC3 represses
  nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (Nr4a2) gene, which is important
  for the formation of long-term memory and object recognition. HDAC3 also regulates
  the Nr4a2 gene in the nucleus accumbens, where HDAC3 binding at enhancers is attenuated
  by cocaine use, which may facilitate long-term memories associated with drug abuse
  and reinforce future use. d | HDAC3 is recruited to specific sites of methylated
  DNA by the nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic
  acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complexes through their interaction with
  methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), which is implicated in Rett syndrome,. There,
  HDAC3 deacetylates and activates the transcription factor forkhead box protein O3
  (FOXO3) to promote neuronal gene expression. Ac, acetyl group; GPS2, G protein pathway
  suppressor 2; H3K27ac, acetylated histone H3 lysine 27; H3K9ac, acetylated histone
  H3 lysine 9; NR, nuclear receptor; TBL1X, transducin β-like 1, X-linked; TBL1XR1,
  TBL1-related protein 1; TF, transcription factor.
