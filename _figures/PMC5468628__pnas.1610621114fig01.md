caption: GRN and SBN circuits. (A) Circuit diagram representing the GRN controlling
  forebrain specification at midlate gastrula stage. The diagram shows the regulatory
  activity of key developmental transcription factors implicated in the specification
  of the different forebrain domains. Modified from ref. . (B) Simplified circuit
  diagram representing the core social behavior neural network for aggression, plus
  several key regions in the mesolimbic reward pathway. Some individual cell populations
  within these regions that play a known role in aggression are outlined within each
  structure. Dotted gray lines represent known physical connections between the brain
  regions. The black line represents one functional connection that has been recently
  quantified in mice, the inhibitory projection from lateral septum (LS) to the ventrolateral
  portion of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMHvl) (). The pallium
  is shaded in blue, medial ganglion eminence (MGE) and anterior entopeduncular area
  (AEP) are shaded in yellow, lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) is shaded in red,
  the preoptic area (POA) is shaded in orange, the hypothalamus is shaded in purple,
  and the midbrain is shaded in gray. HIP, hippocampus; NAcc, nucleus accumbens; OB/VNO,
  olfactory bulb and vomeronasal organ; VTA, ventral tegmental area.
