caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms of action of ANG Secreted ANG
  undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface to the inside of the
  cell where it accumulates in the nucleoli under growth conditions or in the cytoplasm
  under stress conditions. First, the extracellular ANG activates signal transduction
  pathways including SAPK/JNK, ERK1/2, and PI3K/AKT pathways, in different cells and
  cell conditions, although full pathway investigations have yet to be performed.
  The interaction between ANG and cell-surface complex could lead to ECM degradation
  and matrix metalloproteinase activation that promote cell migration and invasion.
  Second, the cytoplasmic ANG cleaves the tRNA to form tiRNA in response to stress,
  while the 5′-tiRNA interacts with the translational silencer YB-1 to inhibit translational
  initiation by recruiting eIF4G/A from uncapped mRNAs. ANG also inhibits the serine-15
  phosphorylation of p53 and the subsequent binding of Mdm2, resulting in ubiquitination
  of p53. In addition, cytoplasmic ANG can optimize stress fiber assembly and focal
  adhesion formation to accommodate cell migration. Third, the nuclear ANG contributes
  to the rRNA transcription/procession and mRNA transcription under growth conditions.
