caption: Fluxes are shown in C-mmol (gdw*h)−1 from A-stat experiments of Lactococcus
  lactis. Blue line represents average values of three independent experiments and
  red lines represent upper and lower values of standard deviations. Originally input
  values were experimentally measured at 20 time points and the other points were
  extrapolated between the measured values to calculate metabolic fluxes at interval
  of 0.01 h−1. Violet boxes are substrates, orange boxes are products and blue boxes
  intracellular metabolites. Diamonds illustrates proteins and pathways involved in
  the given conversion of metabolites. ace - acetate, lact - lactate, etOH - ethanol,

  I_AA_Glu_Group - the sum of consumption of arginine, proline, glutamine and glutamate,
