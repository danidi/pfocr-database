caption: HH signaling pathway during development. (a) In the absence of HH ligands,
  PTCH blocks ciliary localization of SMO and the GLI repressor form (mainly GLI3
  repressor form [GLI3R]) suppresses induction of GLI target gene expression. (b)
  In the presence of HH ligands, the HH pathway is activated. Binding of HH ligand
  to PTCH prevents PTCH inhibition of SMO, and SMO is free to translocate into primary
  cilia and is fully activated. SMO then activates the GLI family, mainly GLI2. GLI2
  upregulates expression of GLI1 as well as GLI target genes. GLI1 is also activated
  downstream of SMO. Activated GLI2 (GLI2A) and GLI1 further upregulate expression
  of various GLI target genes.
