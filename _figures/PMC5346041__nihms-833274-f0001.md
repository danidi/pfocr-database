caption: Major pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense RNA and DNA virus pathogen
  associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the cytosol. Following RIG-I sensing of
  short dsRNA, this sensor is further activated through K63-linked ubiquitination
  by TRIM25 and RIPLET, as well as through lysine deacetylation by HDAC6. Following
  sensing of long dsRNA, MDA5 oligomerizes along the dsRNA. Both RIG-I and MDA5 activate
  signaling through the adaptor MAVS located on mitochondria, mitochondrial-associated
  ER membranes (MAM), and peroxisomes (perox.), leading to the activation and nuclear
  translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB and the production of type I IFN and ISGs. Viral
  DNA PAMPs are sensed by cGAS which catalyzes the production of cGAMP after binding
  to DNA. cGAMP then signals through the adaptor STING, located on ER membranes to
  activate IRF3 and NF-κB. Other viral DNA sensors in the cytosol such as DAI and
  IFI16 are also postulated to function through this pathway. Activation of IFI16
  or AIM2 following viral DNA detection leads to inflammasome activation.
