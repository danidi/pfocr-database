caption: 'Biosynthesis of hop bitter acids from branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) precursors.a)
  The acyl side-chains of humulone/lupulone are derived from leucine, cohumulone/colupulone
  from valine and adhumulone/adlupulone from isoleucine via the corresponding acyl-CoA
  thioesters. The carbon chain of the BCAAs is shown in red to indicate their incorporation
  into the α- and β-acids. b) Schematic depiction of the major pathways contributing
  to the biosynthesis of the major α-acid product, humulone, in lupulin glands. Pathways
  are coloured to match Figure b: BCAA biosynthesis, purple; BCKDH complex, brown;
  MEP pathway, orange; malonyl-CoA biosynthesis, blue; bitter acid biosynthesis, green.
  The movement of metabolic intermediates between cellular compartments is indicated
  by dashed line. Note: the subcellular localization of the putative humulone synthase
  enzyme is not known.'
