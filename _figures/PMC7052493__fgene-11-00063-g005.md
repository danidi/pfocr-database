caption: Selenium-triggered transcriptional response mechanism model and possible
  compounds involved in MPST-7 catalyzed reaction. (A) Transcriptional response to
  selenium involving DAF-16/FOXO, SKN-1/NRF2, and HIF-1/HIF has been identified. The
  HIF-1 pathway involves CYSL-1, which detects selenium and inhibits EGL-9 (this study).
  HIF-1 activation would result in a gene expression change responsible for the selenium
  organismal response. The same pathway was previously proposed for sulfur in reference
  (). (B) MPST-7, catalyze the conversion of sulfite (SO32-) and glutathione persulfide
  (GSSH) to thiosulfate (SSO32-) and glutathione (GSH) (black) (). Possible MPST-7
  selenium substrates and products are shown in gray.
