caption: Schematic overview of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism and AhR pathway in health
  and disease. Panel (A) depicts the Trp metabolism and AhR pathway in a healthy adult,
  and its roles on immune and epithelial homeostasis. Panel (B) illustrates how IBD
  and metabolic diseases compromise the AhR pathway which affects intestinal permeability,
  inflammation and tissue regeneration. Panel (C) describes how neurological disorders
  affect Trp metabolism and AhR pathway in order to worsen symptoms of neurodegeneration.
  Panel (D) illustrates how tumors use Trp and activate AhR in order to proliferate.
  Panel (E) depicts immune AhR activation by coronaviruses in order to inhibit antiviral
  response and promote proliferation. Green arrows represent IDO1 production, large
  green arrows represent high production and the narrow arrows represent low production.
  Brown arrows represent AhR activation, large brown arrows represent high activation
  of AhR, and the narrow arrows represent low activation of AhR.
