caption: Superoxide is a  dangerous cellular toxin that has been implicated in a variety
  of  ailments such as cancer, aging, and Parkinson's disease (). The main  pathway
  used for the cellular degradation of superoxide  (O) is via the superoxide dismutase
  catalyzed  disproportionation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen  ().
  Recently, a new mechanism for the cellular destruction of  superoxide has been discovered
  involving superoxide reductases (SORs)  (). SORs catalyze the reduction of superoxide
  to afford  H2O2 (). This  mechanism is beneficial to anaerobic organisms, which
  are incapable of  processing dioxygen. Two examples of SORs [neelaredoxin and rubredoxin  oxidoreductase
  (Rbo)] have recently been structurally characterized  (, ). Each contains in its
  catalytically active reduced state an  Fe2+ ion (Center II in Rbo) that is ligated
  by  four equatorial histidines and one apical cysteinate trans to an open  site
  (Scheme ). Superoxide oxidizes the  reduced SOR Fe2+ ion to afford Fe3+ and  hydrogen
  peroxide. On release of hydrogen peroxide, a nearby glutamate  (Glu-47) coordinates
  to the Fe3+ ion to afford a  six-coordinate ferric species (the oxidized resting
  state) (Scheme )  (). It has been postulated that this reaction proceeds via a  Fe3+-hydroperoxo
  or -peroxo intermediate [step  (), Scheme ], which has been spectroscopically  observed
  (, ). This would imply that the mechanism for SOR  catalysis involves the transfer
  of an electron from  Fe2+ to a coordinated O via an  inner-sphere pathway. Exogenous
  ligands, such as azide and cyanide  (), have been shown to bind to the iron site
  of SOR, both in its  reduced and oxidized states, suggesting that an inner-sphere  catalytic
  mechanism is feasible ().
