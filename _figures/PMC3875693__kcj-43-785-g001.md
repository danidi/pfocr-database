caption: 'The role of carnitine in the transport of mitochondrial long-chain fatty
  acid oxidation. Carnitine is actively transported via OCTN2 into the cytoplasm and
  forms ester bonds with long chain carboxylic acids by the action of carnitine palmitoyl
  transferase I (CPT I), located in the inner aspect of the outer mitochondrial membrane.
  Acylcarnitine is then translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the
  carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) and cleaved by CPT II in the inner aspect
  of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine is released in the mitochondrial
  matrix and then return to the cytoplasm for another cycle, while the fatty acids
  are conjugated back to coenzyme A in the mitochondrial matrix and then enter the
  pathway of β-oxidation and ketone synthesis. FATP: fatty acid transport protein.'
