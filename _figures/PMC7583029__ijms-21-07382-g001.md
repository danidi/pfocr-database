caption: Plant abiotic stress perception and response, concerning different cell compartments/organelles,
  and the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Stress perception is sensed anywhere in
  the cell where there is a perturbation of biomolecules and metabolic reactions in
  various cellular compartments/organelles. Ca2+signaling is initiated through [Ca2+]cyt
  changes due to the influx of Ca2+ or its release from intracellular calcium stores.
  Changes in [Ca2+]cyt are sensed by various calcium-binding proteins (e.g., calmodulin,
  CBL), and signals are relayed to the nucleus through the SOS pathway. Ca2+ also
  activates other pathways such as ABA signaling. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  in the apoplast is initiated in response to Ca2+ and ABA signaling, and, together,
  Ca2+/ROS signals are automatically propagated to initiate an SAA or distal response.
  Mechano-sensitive channels through the CWI pathway may also play a role in sensing
  cellular stress and initiating a signal transduction cascade. ROS during stress
  is generated at various hotspots, particularly in metabolically active organelles,
  i.e., chloroplast, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. When
  ROS production exceeds the quenching capacity of the cell or cellular organelles,
  retrograde signaling is initiated either through ROS or through ROS-activated/dependent
  signaling pathways. ROS signals from different organelles may be integrated and
  fine-tuned through the ER–MCS. To prevent photoinhibition in the chloroplast, particularly
  that of PSII, CEF, Mehler peroxidase reaction, and photorespiration may relieve
  the system of the excess of reducing equivalents, while antioxidant defense systems
  such as the ascorbate–glutathione cycle may alleviate oxidative stress by quenching
