caption: Schematic of the role of BDNF in the brain reward pathway associated with
  addiction. A, the brain reward pathway consists of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway
  that projects from the VTA to the NAc. The NAc also receives excitatory input from
  limbic regions, including the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The NAc in turn
  sends GABAergic projections to the thalamus via the “direct” and “indirect” pathways.
  B, addictional research demonstrates that BDNF and TrkB signaling are enhanced in
  the NAc. Although BDNF mRNA levels are typically low in this area, BDNF may be secreted
  from limbic regions as well as the VTA. [Adapted from Bolaños CA and Nestler EJ
