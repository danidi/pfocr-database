caption: Model of achievement of SAA induced by NH4+ nutrition. Tomato plants grown
  in NH4+ as a sole N source develop different responses to relieve the mild toxicity
  effect. These responses play an important role in achieving SAA and in the resistance
  against Pst. A common response against NH4+ nutrition is the accumulation of PAs
  to compensate for the lack of some cations other than NH4+, besides serving as a
  sink for excess NH4+ to reduce the toxicity. Here, basal metabolic changes induced
  by NH4+ nutrition were observed, specifically Put, ABA, and ferulic acid accumulation.
  Another response against the mild toxic effect of NH4+ nutrition is ROS accumulation
  and, consequently, the modification of the redox cell state. This modification occurs
  by the basal induction of CuAO and rboh1 genes observed in N-NH4+ plants. Moreover,
  it was found that basal stomatal closure is probably produced by H2O2 derived from
  enhanced CuAO activity, induced by ABA-mediated NH4+ responses. The chloroplast
  receives the stress signal (mediated by ROS) and activates retrograde signalling
  pathways, recruiting downstream ABA signalling to regulate the expression of NH4+-responsive
  genes in the nucleus and prevent NH4+ toxicity. The activation of this defensive
  pathway might induce the establishment of SAA in tomato plant leaves, allowing them
  to better withstand a subsequent Pst. (This figure is available in colour at JXB
