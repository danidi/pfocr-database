caption: 'Thromboinflammatory pathways in sickle cell disease. Hemolytic and ischemia-reperfusion
  events (due to vaso-occlusion) drive inflammation and hemostatic alterations in
  sickle cell disease (SCD). Hemolysis leads to the release of cell-free hemoglobin,
  heme and other red blood cell contents into the vascular environment, causing nitric
  oxide depletion and contributing to platelet activation. Non-protein bound heme
  activates the endothelium (with some participation of tolllike receptor 4), induces
  tissue factor (TF) expression and activation in monocytes and endothelial cells,
  neutrophil extracellular trap formation, leukocyte and complement activation. Endothelial
  activation by platelets, leukocytes, ischemia-reperfusion events and heme/heme-laden
  microparticles results in the expression of adhesion molecules, including P-selectin
  and integrin αiibβ3, which recruit leukocytes and, in turn, red cells to the blood
  vessel walls. Activated endothelial cells, leukocytes and platelets also produce
  mature interleukin-1β, which further activates platelets and clot formation, in
  addition to having major inflammatory effects. Plateletderived proteins, such as
  CD40L and thrombospondin-1, activate the endothelium and may trigger red cell microparticle
  release. TF expression by monocytes leads to thrombin generation via the extrinsic
  (TF/FVIIa/FXa) pathway, while TF expression in activated endothelium signals through
  PAR-2 receptors (TF/FVIIa/FXa) triggering pro-inflammatory responses (interleukin-6
  expression and leukocyte recruitment). Thrombin also mediates pro-inflammatory pathways
  through PAR-1 receptors, triggering von Willebrand factor release and P-selectin
  expression, which contribute to platelet adhesive mechanisms. Thrombin generation
  is further increased by phosphatidylserine-expressing red blood cells and microparticles,
  platelet polyPs and cell-free DNA derived from NET, via the intrinsic pathway of
  coagulation. Thrombin generation ultimately results in fibrin production and clotting,
  but also induces red cell adhesion to the vascular wall, in addition to inflammation
  through PAR-1 signaling. Oxidative stress contributes to NET formation and endothelial
  activation. These cellular responses are part of thromboinflammation, illustrated
  in the inset of . Leukocyte, platelet and red blood cell recruitment to the vascular
  wall, together with clotting processes, neutrophil extracellular trap components
  and the formation of heterocellular aggregates between platelets, leukocytes and
  red blood cells, with subsequent red cell trapping, results in the vaso-occlusive
  processes that characterize SCD. ADP: adenosine diphosphate; ICAM: intercellular
