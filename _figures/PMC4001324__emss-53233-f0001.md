caption: Simplified overview of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS and RAS-related
  RHEB signaling pathways. See () and 34 for more details on pathways. Germline disorders
  associated with mutations in specific genes along this pathway are indicated in
  boxes. The gene products that belong to the paternal age-effect class (as defined
  in text) are in blue and yellow boxes indicate related disorders. RASopathies include
  Noonan, Costello, LEOPARD and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndromes and are caused
  by mutations in the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway. Other proteins in the pathway and associated
  germline disorders for which evidence of direct involvement in the process of selfish
  spermatogonial selection/paternal age-effect is still lacking are indicated in black.
  Known tumor-suppressor genes in cancer are indicated by blue circles. The RAS pathway
  is involved in many cellular process and some of the consequences of pathway activation
  of are illustrated in the case of transduction occurring in a mitotically active
  cell (bottom, middle) or during neurotransmission and/or synaptic plasticity (bottom,
  left and right). Translocation of phosphorylated forms of ERK (pERK) or AKT (pAKT)
  into the nucleus of a mitotic cell triggers many different cellular responses such
  as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility and apoptosis. Within excitatory
  neurons, a few examples of cellular responses triggered by the RAS orRHEB pathways
  are illustrated and involve molecules such as ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K and RSK2)
  and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1).
