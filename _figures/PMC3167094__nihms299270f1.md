caption: 'In the classical pathway (solid gray arrow), C21 precursors (pregnenolone
  and progesterone) are converted to the C19 adrenal androgens DHEA and androstenedione
  (AED) by the sequential hydroxylase and lyase activity of CYP17A1. Circulating adrenal
  androgens (including the sulfated form of DHEA, DHEA-S), enter the prostate and
  can be converted to testosterone by a series of reactions involving the activity
  of HSD3B, HSD17B and AKR1C enzymes. Testosterone is then converted to the potent
  androgen DHT by the activity of SRD5A. In the backdoor pathway to DHT synthesis
  (short gray arrows), C21 precursors are first acted upon by SRD5A and the reductive
  3α-HSD activity of the AKR1C family member, AKR1C2, followed by conversion to C19
  androgens via the lyase activity of CYP17A. DHT is subsequently generated by the
  action of HSD17B3 and an oxidative 3α-HSD enzyme, including HSD17B6 (also called
  RL-HSD) or HSD17B10 (as well as RODH4, RODH5 and NT 3α-HSD, not shown). Adapted
