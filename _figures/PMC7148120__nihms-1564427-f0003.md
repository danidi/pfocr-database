caption: (A) Stimulation with the classic anti-inflammatory interleukin, IL-4, decreases
  glucose uptake and lactate production. IL-4 stimulated microglia also downregulate
  Nitric Oxide (NO) and TNF-ɑ production as glucose is preferentially metabolised
  through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to increase ATP production. (B) The microglial
  inflammatory response is stimulated in a number of ways, such as infection (classically
  simulated with LPS and/or IFNɣ) or naturally through aging. These stressors have
  been shown to increase levels of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and thereby increase
  glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux, resulting in increased NADPH
  and ribose 5-phosphate availability to favor nucleotide synthesis versus ATP production.
  This push towards glycolysis and PPP is coupled with a decrease in mitochondrial
  respiration (OxPhos) and increased mitochondrial fission, resulting in increased
  mitochondrial number, but decreased mitochondrial size. Reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production through NOX2 and Nitric Oxide (NO) production are increased in
  a manner dependent on glucose uptake. Prolonged increases in NO can inhibit oxidative
  phosphorylation further. (C) Interestingly, the inflammatory response is also activated
  following High Fat Diet (HFD) in hypothalamic microglia only in males. HFD in males
  diminished CX3CR1 signaling and led to an enhanced inflammatory response, while
  in females CXCL1 protein was increased, but overall CXC3R1 signaling remained relatively
  unaffected, and no increased inflammation was observed.This figure is based on data
  presented in (; ; ; ; )
