caption: Schematic representation of the negative regulation of TLR3 and TLR5 signaling
  by MUC1. TLR3 expressed in endosomes by airway epithelial cells senses viral-derived
  dsRNA and triggers TRIF-dependent signaling pathways to induce inflammation and
  apoptosis. TLR5 expressed on the surface of these same cells senses bacterial flagellin
  and triggers a myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent
  signaling pathway to induce inflammation. During this early stage of inflammation,
  MUC1 expression is relatively low. TNF-α produced during the ongoing inflammatory
  response up-regulates MUC1 expression. The TLR3 and TLR5 signaling pathways are
  subsequently inhibited through interaction of the MUC1 CT with the respective cytoplasmic
  domains of TLR3 and TLR5.
