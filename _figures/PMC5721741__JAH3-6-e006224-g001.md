caption: Interrelation of nitrate, nitrite, and the l‐arginine‐nitric oxide (NO) pathway.
  The plasma nitrate and nitrite concentration depends on dietary uptake as well as
  endogenous formation of nitrite and nitrate as metabolites of nitric oxide (NO).
  A significant (re‐) conversion from nitrate to nitrite may occur during the entero‐salivary
  circulation of nitrate. Nitrite may be endogenously reconverted to NO by tissues
  nitrite/nitrate reductase activity.
