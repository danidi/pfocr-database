caption: 'Signaling targets of CO. CO has a high affinity for iron centers and thus
  can bind and modulate the cellular activity of hemoproteins. CO has been proposed
  to target sGC, which is a primary receptor of, and has a higher affinity for, nitric
  oxide []. The vasoregulatory effects of exogenous CO, are likely modulated by sGC,
  with possible contribution from direct ion channel modification []. CO has been
  implicated in several cellular effects, which include the modulation of inflammation,
  apoptosis and other cell death programs, and cellular proliferation. CO can also
  target immune responses by altering T cell proliferation and differentiation [].
  Mitochondria, the site of cellular energy generation, are believed to represent
  primary targets of CO action [,,,,,,] (see  for detail). CO can modulate inflammatory
  responses via mtROS [,,,,,] and/or p38 MAPK-dependent inhibition of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α) and upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-10 [,]. The anti-inflammatory effect of CO has been associated with the modulation
  of Toll-like receptor activation [,]. The modulation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB activities
  also can modulate the apoptosis program in response to pro-death stimuli [,]. Additional
  mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of inflammation by CO, including
  PPARγ/Egr-1 signaling [], modulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (Hif-1α)
  signaling [], and normalization of HMGB1 levels []. CO can regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome
  pathway, a specialized platform for the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. CO can also modulate the synthesis of specialized
  pro-resolving mediators, SPMs, to promote the resolution of inflammation [,,]. Abbreviations:
