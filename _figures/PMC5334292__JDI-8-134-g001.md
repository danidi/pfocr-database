caption: 'Schematic representation of the possible role of the polyol pathway in diabetes
  atherosclerosis. The polyol pathway consists of two steps: glucose is first reduced
  to sorbitol by the enzyme, aldose reductase (AR), and the resulting sorbitol is
  then changed to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH). During euglycemia, the
  utilization of glucose through the polyol pathway accounts for less than 3% of glucose
  consumption in cells. However, during hyperglycemia, total consumption of glucose
  through this pathway represents up to 30%, resulting in the enhancement of glucose
  utilization through metabolic cascade shown. Thus, hyperglycemia‐induced polyol
  pathway hyperactivity might contribute to developing not only microvascular disease,
  but also atherosclerosis in the patients with diabetes. eNOS, endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; NAMPT, nicotineamide phosphoribosyl
  transferase; NO, nitric oxide; PKC, protein kinase C; TF, tissue factor; TX, thromboxane;
