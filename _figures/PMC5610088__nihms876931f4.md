caption: Hopanoid biosynthesis in Streptomyces. Reactions in the biosynthetic pathway
  with experimental evidence are shown in blue, those with only bioinformatic predictions
  are shown in purple, and the reactions for which there is conflicting evidence are
  shown in red. Hopanoids that have been identified in S. coelicolor lipid extracts
  are highlighted in blue rectangles. The hopanoid biosynthetic cluster from S. coelicolor
  is shown below, with the locus tag numbers indicated and the same colour coding
  as the pathway. SCO6767 and SCO6768, while not directly involved in hopanoid synthesis,
  have functions associated to isoprenoid biosynthesis (see ). White arrows denote
  ORFs of unknown function. IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate;
  GPP, geranyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate. PSPP, presqualene diphosphate;
  HSQ, hydroxysqualene; SHC, squalene-hopene cyclase; ABHT, aminobacteriohopanetriol.
