caption: 'Overview of the C cascade. The C cascade can be activated through the classic
  pathway, the alternative pathway, and the mannose binding lectin pathway. Activation
  through each of these pathways generates C3-convertases (shown in blue font), enzyme
  complexes that cleave C3 and generate C3b. Further amplification of C activation
  through the alternative pathway generates additional C3b. C3b combines with the
  C3-convertases to create C5-convertases (shown in green font), enzyme complexes
  that cleave C5. Full activation of the C cascade generates several proinflammatory
  fragments: C3a, C3b, C5a, and C5b-9 (shown in red font). Although the C system is
  activated in most forms of glomerular disease, the mechanisms of activation and
  the pathways involved are distinct. Some of the diseases in which each pathway is
  involved are listed.'
