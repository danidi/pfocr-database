caption: Activation of AMPK leads to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by the
  phopshorylation of HMG-CoA reductase. By inhibiting ACC and activating MCD, AMPK
  increases fatty acid oxidation via the regulation of malonyl CoA levels, which is
  both a critical precursor for biosynthesis of fatty acids and a potent inhibitor
  of CPT-1, the shuttle that controls the transfer of LCACoA into the mitochondria.
  AMPK inhibits hepatic glucose production via the phosphorylation of TORC2 and inhibition
  gene expression for key gluconeogenic enzymes, G6Pase and PEPCK, and for the transcriptional
  co-activator PGC-1α. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
  CPT1-α, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; LCACoA,
  Long Chain acyl CoAs; MCD, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase; PGC1α, PPARγ co-activator 1α; TORC2, transducer of regulated CREB
  activity 2.
