caption: 'Expression of auxin transport and signaling genes in wild-type (WT) and
  CKX-4 tubers after GA3-mediated tuber sprouting. An overview of auxin transport
  proteins is shown on the left, and the auxin signaling pathway is shown on the right
  as derived from Arabidopsis (; ). Expression data of differentially expressed ESTs
  representing genes of auxin transport and signaling are shown in the gray panel.
  Color bars as displayed by the MapMan tool were copied to and aligned in Microsoft
  PowerPoint. The color scale above the panel indicates transcript levels, with red
  representing an increase and blue representing a decrease in transcript levels.
  The colors saturate at 4-fold change. Details on the assignment of individual POCI
  identifiers to genes shown are listed in Supplemental Table S3. Auxin transport:
  IAA is the most abundantly occurring auxin in nature. It can enter the cell in its
  protonated form either by diffusion through the plasma membrane or facilitated by
  AUX1 permeases. Inside the cell, IAAH is deprotonated and trapped due to the change
  in pH. Auxin efflux is performed by two types of transporters, PGP1/PGP19 ATP-binding
  cassette transporters and PIN proteins. PGP1/PGP19 usually has a nonpolar localization,
  whereas PIN proteins show a polar localization that determines the orientation of
  the auxin flow within the cell. Auxin signaling, without IAA: ARF transcription
  factors bind to auxin-responsive elements (AREs) in the promoters of auxin-responsive
  genes and interact with Aux/IAA proteins, which in turn recruit the transcriptional
  corepressor TPL to prevent gene expression. When accumulating in the nucleus, IAA
  binds to Aux/IAA proteins and the TIR1 subunit of the SCFTIR1 complex, targeting
  Aux/IAA for degradation via the 26S proteasome and releasing ARF transcription factors
  from inhibition. The activity of the SCRTIR1 complex can be regulated by the addition
  and removal of ubiquitin-like protein RUB1 through the action of conjugating (AXR1,
  RCE1, and ECR1) and deconjugating (CSN) enzymes. ARFs released from inhibition act
  as monomers or dimers to promote the expression of auxin-responsive genes (e.g.
  those coding for SAUR and GH3 proteins). AUX1, Auxin 1; AXR1, auxin-resistant 1;
