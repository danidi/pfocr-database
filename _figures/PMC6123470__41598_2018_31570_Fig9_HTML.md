caption: Light-driven signalling to the circadian clock via ROS, the MAPK cascade
  and the D-box enhancer in vertebrate cells. Schematic representation of how exposure
  to blue light differentially influences MAPK signalling and D-box enhancer-driven
  gene expression. In all three cell lines studied, blue light exposure triggers an
  increase in intracellular ROS levels. In PAC-2 cells (central panel), this results
  in two peaks of activation of p38 and JNK, one rapid (5–15 mins) and a second delayed
  increase (6–7 hours). In contrast, levels of P-ERK remain relatively unchanged during
  light exposure. This combined signalling results in the activation of D-box-driven
  gene expression, ultimately leading to circadian clock entrainment (indicated by
  green arrow). In HeLa cells (left panel), all three MAP kinases are activated with
  a predominantly delayed response (6–7 hours) that does not influence D-box driven
  transcription. Indeed, in mammalian cells D-box regulated expression constitutes
  a clock output pathway (indicated by white arrow). In EPA cells (right panel), all
  three MAP kinases are activated rapidly and transiently (with p38 also exhibiting
  the second, delayed peak of activation). However, as for the HeLa cells, this signalling
  does not affect the D-box enhancer or entrain the circadian clock. Indeed, it has
  been previously shown that cavefish cells possess a blind circadian clock (indicated
  by a red cross)
