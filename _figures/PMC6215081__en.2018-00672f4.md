caption: Mechanisms underlying glucose, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), bile acid,
  and amino acid sensing in EECs. (a) Glucose sensing in EECs, mediated by two pathways
  leading to cell depolarization and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC),
  triggering Ca2+ influx and hormone secretion. Glucose cotransport with Na+ through
  apical sodium glucose-linked transporter 1 can trigger depolarization and secretion,
  whereas glucose influx via glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) increases ATP levels and
  closes KATP channels, potentially modifying the effectiveness of other depolarizing
  stimuli. (b) SCFA sensing in EECs mediated by FFA2 Gαq signaling, thereby increasing
  Ca2+ and triggering hormone release. An unidentified pathway might also trigger
  EEC depolarization and opening of VGCC, as suggested by experiments on perfused
  intestine. (c) Bile acid sensing is mediated by basolateral G-protein–coupled bile
  acid receptor (GPBAR) 1 signaling through Gαs, increasing cAMP and triggering hormone
  secretion. GPBAR1 activation also promotes depolarization and opening of VGCCs.
  (d) Amino acid sensing in EECs is mediated by multiple pathways. Highlighted in
  the figure are calcium-sensing receptor Gαq signaling and electrogenic amino acid
  uptake, which trigger subsequent depolarization and opening of VGCCs.
