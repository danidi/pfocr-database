caption: The canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways. The canonical pathway
  is critical for the activation of innate immunity and inflammation (left). It is
  activated by TNFα, IL-1, and lipopolysaccharide. Activation of this pathway depends
  on the IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ complex, which phosphorylates IκB proteins to trigger their
  degradation through β-TrCP ubiquitin proteasome. The noncanonical pathway is crucial
  for the activation of adaptive immunity (right). It is activated by lipopolysaccharide,
  B cell – activating factor of the TNF family, and latent membrane protein 1. Activation
  of this pathway depends on IKKα homodimers which phosphorylate p100 to induce p100/RELB
  heterodimers processing intop52/RELB heterodimers.
