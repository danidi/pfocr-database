caption: '(A) Known KEGG pathway knowledge in cancer. (B) A common mutated pathway
  model for BRCA and OV initiation and progression. It is inferred based on the identified
  common gene sets and their participant pathway knowledge. The gene AKT1 does not
  appear in the identified common gene sets. (C) Only local parts of the common mutated
  pathway in (B) can be found by the individual cancer type approach BLP: (a) BRCA
  (up for 2 ≤ K ≤ 6, below for 7 ≤ K ≤ 10) and (b) OV, according to the detected genes
  in Table .'
