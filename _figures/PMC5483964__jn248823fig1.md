caption: Mechanisms linking folate to cellular function. Folate regulates cellular
  functions mediated by its well-established involvement in the synthesis of nucleotides,
  which are needed for DNA synthesis and repair, and its function as a methyl donor,
  critical for DNA methylation. We propose that folate sensing by mTOR constitutes
  a novel and distinct pathway by which folate modulates cell functions such as nutrient
  transport, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial respiration. Folate sensing by mTOR
  appears to involve both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and requires the folate transporter PCFT.
  The downstream cellular response to mTORC2 folate sensing in the lysosome is unknown.
