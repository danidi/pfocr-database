caption: A) Activation (green arrow) of LET-60-mediated signalling in the vulva by
  the LIN-3 (EGF), LET-23 (RTK), LET-60 (RAS), LIN-45 (RAF), and MPK-1 (MAPK) signalling
  cascade. Negative feedback loop is produced by chromatin regulators and the sumoylation
  pathway to attenuate LET-60-mediated signalling (in red). B) Diagram depicting the
  RNAi screening approach in a SUMO-balanced background using the MVP (multiple ventral
  protrusions) phenotype as readout for hyperactivation of the LET-60 signalling pathway
  during vulval development. The green pharynx indicates GFP balanced animals lacking
  one copy of smo-1, the non-green animals are smo-1 lf /smo-1 lf homozygotes. The
  percentage indicates the approximate ratio of adult animals for each genotype observed.
  smo-1 lf /smo-1 lf are 100% sterile presenting a protruding vulva (PVL) and about
  10% of these Pvl animals will display the multivulvae (MUV) phenotype. This was
  taken into account during the screen (see Materials and Methods).
