caption: A proposed model for the crosstalk between the cell wall integrity (CWI)
  pathway and several other pathways in M agnaporthe oryzae. There might be novel
  crosstalk between the CWI pathway and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway
  through MoPdeH. The CWI pathway may also crosstalk with the dithiothreitol (DTT)‐induced
  unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway.
  The question mark represents an unknown sensor protein which can respond to endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress (DTT) and subsequently activate the phosphorylation of the
  CWI pathway.
