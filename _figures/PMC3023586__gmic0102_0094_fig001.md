caption: 'Model for host-cell signalling induced by EPEC Tir. Tir is an effector protein
  of EPEC, which is injected into host cells by a type-III secretion system (T3SS).
  Translocated Tir is rapidly inserted into the host cell membrane where interaction
  with the bacterial surface protein Intimin triggers signalling leading to disease-related
  events. Tir membrane insertion results in a hairpin-like structure of the protein
  and correlates with multiple phosphorylation events at indicated serine/tyrosine
  residues. While the tyrosine residues Y-454 and Y-474 can be phosphorylated by Fyn,
  Tec and/or Abl kinases, the serine residues S-434 and S-463 are phosphorylated by
  PKA. Injected Tir has at least 10 interacting host cell proteins as indicated. The
  induced downstream signal cascades can be classified in three categories: (A) phosphorylation-independent,
  (B) dependent on Tir tyrosine phosphorylation, and (C) dependent on Tir serine phosphorylation.
  For more details see text.'
