caption: Flow diagram. Drug-target networks were constructed by integrating gene expression
  and protein interaction data, and the modules were identified using entropy-based
  clustering algorithm (ECA). The comparison of topological similarity and GO functional
  enrichment analysis was used to define the drug responsive modules (RMs). The KEGG
  pathway in RMs was enriched using DAVID 6.7 software. (A color version of this figure
  is available in the online journal.)
