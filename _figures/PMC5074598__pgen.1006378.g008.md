caption: 'A: Memory formation in Drosophila larvae occurs through at least two different
  components, which are genetically and functionally distinct. First, larval short-term
  memory (lSTM, light blue) occurs immediately after training, but decays within 20
  minutes. Second, larval anesthesia-resistant memory (lARM, light magenta) also appears
  immediately after training, but lasts for a longer period of time. In contrast to
  lSTM lARM is resistant to anesthetic disruption. At any given time interval after
  training the observed memory is the summed output of both components. B: Memory
  formation in Drosophila larvae after classical olfactory conditioning depends on
  protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) function, which are involved in
  two different signaling pathways. During conditioning MB KCs receive an olfactory
  stimulus via cholinergic projection neurons (conditioned stimulus CS) and a punishing
  stimulus from dopaminergic neurons (unconditioned stimulus US). In KCs binding of
  dopamine leads to a dissociation of a G protein subunit from G-protein coupled receptors
  (GPCR). The CS is perceived by KCs via acetylcholine receptors (AChR). Its activation
  leads to an opening of a voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) and leads to an
  intracellular Ca2+ influx. This mechanism is thought to be shared between both signaling
  pathways. In the classical pathway (left side, molecular elements tested in this
  study are highlighted in light blue), coincident stimulation of CS and US leads
  to an activation of type I adenylyl cyclase (AC) via Ca2+/Calmodulin and dopamine
  dependent G protein (Gαs) signaling, respectively. Active AC catalyzes the intracellular
  cAMP production, which is negatively regulated through a phosphodiesterase (PDE)
  to maintain cAMP concentrations at a tolerable level. cAMP serves as a regulatory
  signal for PKA, which phosphorylates different substrates like Synapsin (Syn) or
  CREB in order to induce short or long-lasting presynaptic plasticity. PKC signaling
  (right side, molecular elements tested in this study are highlighted in light magenta)
  has been shown in different species as an integral pathway for memory formation.
  Dopamine receptors were reported to couple to Gαq to regulate phospholipase C (PLC).
  Activation of PLC increases intracellular inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG) levels. Whereas IP3 stimulates the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum,
  DAG is a physiological activator of PKC. The downstream elements of PKC are not
  well described. We suggest that lSTM formation depends on the classical cAMP/PKA
  pathway, whereas early lARM formation depends on PKC signaling rather than on cAMP/PKA
  signaling. This assumption is based on the analysis of nine different genes (light
  purple: lARM phenotype, light blue: lSTM phenotype). In addition, we suggest that
  PKC can be linked with Radish (Rsh) and Bruchpilot (Brp) as direct or indirect downstream
  partners. This is so far hypothetical. Yet, a structural analysis on Rsh reported
  that it has several PKC phosphorylation sites. Ultimately, regulation of Brp via
  PKC signaling would change the organization of the active zone to provide a molecular
  substrate for presynaptic plasticity. DA: dopamine, Ach: Acetylcholine, CaM: Calmodulin,
  RP: reserve pool, RRP: readily releasable pool.'
