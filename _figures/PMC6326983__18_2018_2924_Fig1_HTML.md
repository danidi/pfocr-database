caption: Schematic model of the interaction between reprogramming to pluripotency
  and tumorigenesis. The reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency is performed
  by overexpressing reprogramming factors (such as OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, c-MYC, NANOG,
  and miRNAs) and inhibiting tumor suppressor genes (such as those encoding p14ARF,
  p16Ink4a, p21Cip1, and p53), to reset their fate toward a state of pluripotency,
  which is a dedifferentiation process that resembles tumor development. Patient-specific
  or healthy iPSCs are used in cell-based therapy after inducing differentiation to
  appropriate types of cells, for transplantation into patients. For example, iPCCs
  were derived by introducing OSKM factors and knocking down vector shTP53 in tumor
  cells in a manner similar to that described in iPSC protocols. The teratomas that
  are formed after the transfer of iPCCs to SCID mice are then dissected out, and
  isolated cells can form putative CSC-like phenotypes. The various malignancy characteristics
  observed in iPCCs seem to depend on differences in tumor cell types. In contrast,
  CSCs can be derived by an OCT4-mediated dedifferentiation process in tumor progression,
  even in somatic cells, via the stable expression of telomerase, the H-Ras V12 mutant,
  and inhibition of the p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathways. CSCs can also
  be derived directly from tumor cells via the overexpression of OCT4, NANOG, KLF4,
  and IGFBP3, in a dedifferentiating manner. Putative CSCs and iPCCs are expected
  to be used in studies of drug screening or cancer-initiation mechanisms in the field
  of human cancer therapeutics. Hypoxia enhances the reprogramming of somatic cells,
  and HIFs directly regulate the factors that are needed for self-renewal and multipotency
  in cancer cells and CSCs. Furthermore, hypoxia increases the production of ROS,
  which promote cell development and EMT in CSCs via the TGF-β signaling pathway and
  drive CSCs to produce VEGF, which induces angiogenesis
