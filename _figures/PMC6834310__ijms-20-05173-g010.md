caption: A proposed mechanism for melatonin-mediated abiotic stress tolerance. Two
  different mechanisms underlie melatonin-mediated plant responses. One mechanism
  is a BR-independent pathway (a). This pathway is associated directly with the antioxidant
  activity of melatonin. Melatonin-deficient rice plants, such as snat1, produce increased
  levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn inhibit plant growth and
  dampen abiotic stress tolerance. The other mechanism is a BR-dependent pathway (b).
  This pathway involves melatonin as a signaling molecule, possibly via a melatonin
  receptor []. Melatonin-deficient rice plants, such as snat2, exhibit decreased BR
  levels in conjunction with increased GA insensitivity, leading to enhanced abiotic
  stress tolerance. The basis of differential receptor recognition of melatonin deficiency
  caused by either SNAT1 or SNAT2 remains unclear. NAS, N-acetylserotonin; NA, not
  altered.
