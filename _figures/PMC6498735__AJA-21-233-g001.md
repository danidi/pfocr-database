caption: 'Schematic representation of signal contributes to CSC phenotype. (a) Wnt
  proteins bind to both frizzled receptor proteins and the co-receptor LRP5/6. This
  binding further facilitates the activation of β-catenin. Activated β-catenin translocates
  into nucleus and promotes Wnt downstream gene transcription. Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin
  induced hTERT also acts as a transcriptional factor, resulting a positive feedback
  in the enhanced expression of Wnt target genes that leads to cancer-promoting functions
  and CSC phenotypes. (b) Sonic Hedgehog pathway is initiated by binding one of the
  three secreted Hedgehog ligands to its receptor. This binding releases Smoothened
  that modulates the expression of three Gli zinc-finger transcription factors. (c)
  The Notch receptor is activated by ligand binding, which is presented by a neighboring
  cell. Notch activation releases an active fragment, NICD. NICD then translocates
  into the nucleus and promotes the expression of targeted genes. Notch-dependent
  signaling induces several genes associated with differentiation, survival, stemness,
  and EMT, which all relate to PCa progression and metastasis. Further, Notch signaling
  is often activated by hypoxia through HIF-1α. CSC: cancer stem cell; PCa: prostate
  cancer; hTERT: human telomerase reverse transcriptase; LRP: low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein; Gli: glioma-associated oncogene homolog; Sox 2: sex determining
