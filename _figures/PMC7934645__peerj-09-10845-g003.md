caption: '(A) Inactive signaling: In the absence of Hh ligands, PTCH precludes SMO
  localization to the cytomembrane and represses SMO activity. As a result, GLI cannot
  be separated from SUFU in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, GLI is processed into transcriptional
  repressors (GLI-R) by PKA- or CK1-dependent phosphorylation and proteasome. GLI-R,
  which has been translocated into the nucleus, cannot perform transcriptional functions.
  (B) Active signaling: once the Hh ligands bind to PTCH receptors on the cell membrane,
  the inhibitory effect of PTCH on SMO is abrogated. A protein complex containing
  KIF7 and SUFU bound to GLI zinc-finger transcription factors is dynamically transported
  to the activated SMO. Active SMO promotes release of GLI proteins from SUFU, resulting
  in nuclear accumulation of active GLI (GLI-A) and activation of FOXF2, the transcriptional
  target of Hh-GLI pathway. SUFU is degraded by Cullin-3 (Cul3) - or speckle type
  BTB/POZ protein (Spop) -dependent ubiquitylation.'
