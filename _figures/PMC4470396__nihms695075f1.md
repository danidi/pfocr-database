caption: The purine intermediate ZMP (highlighted in pink) is a positive regulator
  of expression of tetrahydrofolate genes involved in one-carbon metabolism. ZMP can
  also be produced from ATP via the histidine biosynthesis pathway. A conserved riboswitch
  is activated by ZMP binding, leading to expression of metabolic genes highlighted
  in pink. GlyA (glycine hydroxymethyltransferase), FolD (5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase/5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase), Fhs (formate tetrahydrofolate
  ligase), PurH (AICAR formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase).
