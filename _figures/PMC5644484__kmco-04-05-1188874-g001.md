caption: cGMP, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), sildenafil, and melanoma growth. Melanoma
  cells (gray) express a cGMP pathway (not shown) comprised of the CNP receptor guanylate
  cyclase B (GC-B), cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI), and the cGMP-degrading
  PDE5. The peptide hormone C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is released from inflamed
  tumor vessels (green jerrycan) and triggers cGMP synthesis in melanoma cells via
  GC-B. cGMP activates cGKI, which promotes mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signaling via phosphorylation of currently unknown substrate proteins. Cells with
  increased potential for growth, migration, and invasiveness develop. PDE5 hydrolyzes
  cGMP, keeping cGMP levels and melanoma growth low (left). Thus, CNP acts as fuel
  (left and right) and PDE5 as a brake (left) on the growth-promoting cGMP pathway.
  The PDE5 blocker sildenafil (blue pills/scissors) releases the PDE5 brake, leading
  to increased cGMP and MAPK signaling and, ultimately, more aggressive tumor growth
  (right).
