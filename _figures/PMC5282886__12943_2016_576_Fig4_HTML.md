caption: Model of IGF system inhibition strategies and resistance mechanisms. Strategies
  to target the IGF-I/IGF-IR axis included increasing circulating levels of IGF-I
  and blocking kinase activation of the IGF-IR. The mechanisms of drug resistance
  are mainly in abnormal autocrine or paracrine expression of ligand IGF-I, not shut
  down receptor signaling completely (hybrid receptor or IR signaling) or activation
  of alternative signaling pathway (EGFR or HER2 signaling pathways). IR, insulin
  receptor; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  HER2, epidermal growth factor 2 receptor
