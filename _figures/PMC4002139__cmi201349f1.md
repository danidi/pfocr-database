caption: A proposed regulatory mechanism of Treg homeostasis and survival. In the
  steady state, the interactions between pro-apoptotic Bim, anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and
  apoptotic regulators Bax and Bak actively maintain the homeostatic population of
  Tregs. When the homeostatic population of Tregs is disturbed, signals provided by
  IL-2 and costimulatory signals upregulate anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 expression, which
  in turn inhibits the Bak and Bax-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway and subsequently
  allows Tregs to proliferate during the niche-filling process. Treg, regulatory T
  cell.
