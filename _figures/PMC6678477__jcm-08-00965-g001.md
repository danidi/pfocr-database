caption: Rac1 activation is regulated by GEFs and GAP. In diabetes Tiam1 and Vav2
  are upregulated, and these GEFs activate Rac1 leading to increased Rac1-Nox2-ROS
  signaling pathway. Furthermore, increase in p66Shc displaces Sos1 from Grb2, leading
  to Rac1 activation. Hyperglycemia also increases prenylation enzyme FNTA and decreases
  GDI, that further helps Rac1 translocation to the membrane for Nox2 holoenzyme assembly.
  Increased ROS production by Nox2 augments mitochondrial damage, leading to capillary
  cell apoptosis and the development of diabetic retinopathy
