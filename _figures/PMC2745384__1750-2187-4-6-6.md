caption: 'RCAN1 mediated regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis: Schematic
  shows that GC-dependent GR activation and subsequent MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation
  enables GR binding to GRE sequences on target genes. GR alters expression profiles
  of T-lymphoid cells resulting in a net increase in pro-apoptotic gene expression.
  One of the gene that GR induces is RCAN1-1. Increases in [Ca2+]i levels triggers
  the calcium signaling pathway, culminating in the activation of calcineurin phosphatase
  (PP3C), which dephosphorylates and activates NFAT, causing its nuclear translocation.
  NFAT induces transcription of pro-survival genes, and RCAN1-4, which serves as a
  negative feed-back regulatory loop, because it can directly bind to and inactivate
  calcineurin phosphatase. GR-dependent induction of RCAN1-1 also causes inhibition
  of calcineurin, and subsequent down-regulation of pro-survival genes, thus facilitating
  GR-dependent apoptosis of T lymphoid cells.'
