caption: These network models show the predicted strength of relationships between
  all known FGF signaling ligand-receptor pairs []. Gene nodes are colored by SRC
  score (light gray = weak SRC; dark blue = strong SRC) and edge color/thickness indicates
  the strength of predicted functional association between ligand and receptor (yellow/thin
  = low probability; teal/thick = high probability). A. The hESC FGF signaling model
  shows that the most strongly connected ligand-receptor pairs with high-ranking SRCs
  are FGF2 and FGF19 (the human ortholog of Fgf15), which are most strongly associated
  with FGFR1 and FGFR3. FGF2 is known to activate FGF signaling in hESCs, while FGF19
  has been associated with neuronal development. B. The mESC FGF signaling model showed
  that the most strongly connected ligand-receptor pairs with high ranking SRCs are
  Fgf4 and Fgf5, which are both associated with Fgfr1 and Fgfr2, and Fgf15 which is
  most strongly connected to Fgfr2. In mESCs, Fgf4 is known to activate FGF signaling,
  Fgf5 is associated with FGF signaling in the late stage blastocyst and epiblast,
  and Fgf15 has been shown to be involved in early neurodevelopment.
