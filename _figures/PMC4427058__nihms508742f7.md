caption: Schematic representation of the identified epigenetic regulatory mechanism
  involved in the miR-124/STAT3 pathway in pediatric-UC. DNA-methylation in the promoter
  of MIR124 decreases the expression levels of the microRNA relieving its inhibitory
  effect on STAT3 levels, thus leading to increased STAT3 phosphorylation and consequently
  to higher levels of its direct target genes VEGF, BCL2, BCLXL and MMP9.
