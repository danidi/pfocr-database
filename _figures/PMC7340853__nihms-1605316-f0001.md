caption: Whereas complement typically exerts its various effector functions for defensive
  purposes, damaged host cells or foreign surfaces (for example, transplants and biomaterials)
  may trigger the cascade and cause clinical complications. For example, binding of
  natural antibodies (NAbs) to neoepitopes, released, for example, after hypoxia,
  or of auto-antibodies (AAbs) to auto-antigens may initiate the classical pathway
  (CP). Other damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can trigger the CP directly
  or invoke the lectin pathway (LP) via any of its pattern-recognition receptors,
  that is, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins (Fcns) or certain collectins (CLs).
  Either event leads to the formation of CP/LP C3 convertases (C4b2b), which in turn
  cleave C3 to generate the anaphylatoxin C3a and the opsonin C3b. Hydrolysis of C3
  (depicted as C3*; also termed C3(H2O)), which may either occur spontaneously (tick-over)
  or upon surface contact, provides a low-level activation of the alternative pathway
  (AP) by forming an initial AP C3 convertase (C3*Bb) with Factors B and D (FB and
  FD); thereby released C3b may assemble further AP C3 convertases (C3bBb), deposit
  directly on surfaces or, potentially, be recruited to select surfaces by the modulator
  properdin (FP). Surface-deposited C3b is the driving force of an amplification loop
  that leads to rapid opsonization with C3b. Increasing density of C3b favours the
  formation of CP/LP or AP C5 convertases (C4b2b3b and C3bBb3b, respectively) that
  cleave C5 to generate the potent chemoattractant and immune modulator of C5a and
  C5b, the initial component of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which may cause
  lysis, cell damage and/or signalling events. In a parallel breakdown pathway, complement
  regulators such as Factor H (FH), complement receptor 1 (CR1) or CD55 destabilize
  convertases and impair the amplification loop. Some regulators also serve as essential
  cofactors for the Factor I (FI)-mediated degradation of C3b to iC3b (that is, FH,
  CR1 and CD46) and C3dg (that is, CR1). These opsonin fragments modulate immune functions,
  including cell adhesion and activation, phagocytosis, cell signalling and stimulation
  of B cells and follicular dendritic cells. FH is the major fluid-phase regulator
  of the AP, whereas C4b-binding protein (C4BP) and C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH)
  control CP/LP activation, carboxypeptidase N (CPN) modulates anaphylatoxin activity
  and CD59 impairs MAC formation. Many complement proteins belong to major drug target
  classes, such as serine proteases or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), and/or
  engage in protein–protein interactions (PPIs) that may be modulated with therapeutic
  antibodies. MASP, mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease; pFD, pro-FD.
