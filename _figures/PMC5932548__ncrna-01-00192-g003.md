caption: Signalling pathways initiated by miRNAs and TGF-β in diabetic nephropathy.
  The TGF-β signalling pathway is responsible for the induction of ECM matrix protein
  expression. This process is positively up-regulated through the activity of miR-192
  which acts to negatively regulate E-box repressors (ZEB1 and ZEB2) and Smad-interacting
  protein 1 (SIP 1),which are responsible for down regulating the expression of induced
  extracellular matrix proteins during diabetic nephropathy. TGF-β regulates the expression
  of miR-216a and miR-217 through the down-regulation of phosphatase and tensin (PTEN)
  by AKT kinase. Fibronectin expression is increased through the down-regulation of
  p21-activated kinase (PAK1) and superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) by miR377a.
