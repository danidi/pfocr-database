caption: The TGF-β non-SMAD signaling pathways. (A) The ERK-MAP kinase pathway. First
  step for the activation of the TGF-β-induced ERK pathway is the phosphorylation
  of ShcA by the activated type I receptor. TGF-β-induced tyrosine phosphorylation
  of ShcA promotes formation of ShcA/Grb2/Sos complex and Ras activation. This leads
  to the sequential activation of Raf, MEK1/2 and finally ERK1/2. Activated ERK1/2
  phosphorylate transcription factors (TF), thus contributing to TGF-β-induced transcriptional
  responses. Activated ERK1/2 can also phosphorylate SMADs at the linker region to
  regulate their activity. (B) The p38/JNK and NF-κB pathway (via TAK1). Upon ligand
  binding, TGF-β receptor complexes interact with TRAF6 promoting its autoubiquitylation.
  SMAD6 can inhibit TRAF6 ubiquitylation and activation by recruiting the deubiquitylating
  enzyme A20. TRAF6 activates TAK1 via Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation and activated
  TAK1 in turn activates through phosphorylation MAP kinase kinases (MKKs) MKK4, MKK3
  and MKK6. MKKs activate their downstream kinases JNK and p38, which can then phosphorylate
  their target transcription factors (TF) in order to regulate transcription. SMAD7
  enhances the activation of the p38 pathway as it acts as a scaffolding protein for
  TAK1, MKK3 and p38. Activated JNK and p38 phosphorylate also SMADs at the linker
  region, thus regulating SMAD-dependent transcriptional responses as well. Finally,
  TAK1 activates also IKK, which eventually leads to the activation of NF-κB signaling.
  (C) The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. TGF-β promotes PI3K/AKT activation via direct interaction
  of the p85 subunit of PI3K (not shown) with TGF-β receptors. TGF-β-induced autoubiquitylation
  of TRAF6 results in recruitment and phosphorylation of AKT. TGF-β via PI3K, promotes
  also activation of mTORC2, which in turn can also phosphorylate and activate AKT
  promoting cell survival. Moreover, activated AKT prevents phosphorylation of SMAD3,
  thus attenuating SMAD3-dependent signaling. (D) TGF-β signaling by type I receptor
  intracellular domain signaling. The transmembrane metalloprotease TACE, promotes
  ectodomain cleavage of type I receptor, which is then followed by TRAF6-mediated
  ubiquitylation of the cytoplasmic domain of type I receptor and recruitment of presenilin-1
  (PS1), part of the γ-secretase complex. PS1 proteolytically cleaves the ubiquitylated
  intracellular cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (TGFβRI ICD), which is released
  into the cytoplasm. Then, TGFβRI ICD translocates to the nucleus where it associates
  with other co-factors (not shown) and induces the expression of target genes. (E)
  MAP kinase pathway activation via TRAF4. The MAP kinase pathway can also be activated
  via TRAF4, another E3 ligase that upon ligand binding is recruited to the receptor
  complex, gets autoubiquitylated and then activates TAK1 via polyubiquitylation,
  eventually leading to activation of the p38 pathway. At the same time, TRAF4 targets
  SMURF2 for polyubiquitylation and subsequent degradation, thus contributing to the
  stability of TGF-β type I receptor. (F) The JAK-STAT pathway. STAT3 gets phosphorylated
  and activated by JAK (which interacts with the type I receptor) in response to TGF-β
  in order to regulate the expression of subset of TGF-β target genes. (G) The Rho-(like)
  GTPase pathway activation. TGF-β induces activation of RhoA GTPase (via both SMAD-independent
  and SMAD-dependent mechanisms), which eventually results in actin cytoskeleton reorganization
  and formation of stress fibers. Additionally, Par6, a regulator of cell polarity,
  once phosphorylated by TGF-β type II receptor, recruits Smurf1 E3 ligase that targets
  RhoA for degradation, eventually leading to tight junction dissociation. Upon TGF-β
  stimulation, Rho-like proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 are also activated and promote actin
  reorganization via activation of PAK2.
