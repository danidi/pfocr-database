caption: Cell extrinsic and intrinsic cellular stress engages mitochondrial apoptosis
  through BCL-2 family proteins, which regulate mitochondrial integrity, as shown
  on the right side of the figure. The extrinsic stress pathway is mounted by ligand
  binding of death receptors at the plasma membrane resulting in caspase 8-mediated
  activation of BID (not shown). The intrinsic pathway is poorly characterized in
  different cell types upstream of BH3-only proteins, and depending on the stress
  its engagement results in heterogeneous upregulation of BH3-only activities. For
  example, BIM is upregulated in response to kinase inhibitors and microtubule stabilizing
  drugs []. When the stress activates enough of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins
  to overcome the anti-apoptotic response, the effectors BAK and BAX are directly
  activated by BID, BIM, and potentially other BH3-only proteins, and form pores in
  the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) releasing cytochrome c (cyt c), a process
  known as the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Cyt c triggers
  the activation of the downstream caspase cascade leading to apoptosis (not shown).
  The unified model of BCL-2 family protein function in MOMP is depicted at the left.
