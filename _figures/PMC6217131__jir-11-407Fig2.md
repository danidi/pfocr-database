caption: 'Schematic representation of NF-κB p65 activation and potential inhibitors
  along the signaling pathway.Notes: The inset shows phosphorylation and acetylation
  sites of p65 as sites of kinase inhibitors and HDACs. Representative inhibitory
  strategies along the pathway are shown.Abbreviations: NBD, NeMO binding peptide;
  GC, glucocorticoid; GILZ, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper; GR, glucocorticoid
  receptor; HDAC, histone deacytelases; NLS, nuclear localization signal; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide;
  PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; TAD, transactivation domain.'
