caption: Potential anti-inflammatory effects of estrogens on hypothalamic inflammatory
  processes induced by overnutrition. HFD feeding induces astrogliosis through activating
  NFκB pathway and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6). These astrocyte actions
  develop an inflammatory enviroment which could have detrimental effects on neurons
  such as the lack of leptin sensitivity as result of an increase in SOCS3 levels
  induced by inflammatory pathway activation in these cells and leading a positive
  energy balance. Estrogens are well-known for their protective effects in several
  cell types and thus, we hypothesize that estrogens could reduce astrocyte inflammatory
  phenotype through reducing fatty acids-activated NFkB activity and consequently
  decreasing inflammatory mediators synthesis. These astrocyte effects mediated by
  estrogens could be behind of the restoration of leptin signaling and sensitivity
  in neurons. ERs estrogen receptors; E2 estradiol; IL-6 Interleukin; NFκβ nuclear
