caption: Mycothiol (MSH) is oxidised by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mycothiol
  disulfide (MSSM). MSSM is reduced into MSH by the mycothiol disulfide reductase
  Mtr. MSH-dependent peroxidases, such as MPx, MsrA, and AhpE function in ROS detoxification.
  Electrophiles (RX) are conjugated to MSH to form MS-electrophiles (MSR), which are
  cleaved by the MSH S-conjugate amidase Mca to mercapturic acids (AcCysR) and exported
  from the cell. MSH serves as a cofactor for the alcohol dehydrogenase MscR and formaldehyde
  dehydrogenase AdhE for detoxification of NO and formaldehyde. Arsenate reductases
  CgArsC1/CgArsC2 conjugate MSH and arsenate As (V) to form As (V)-SM that is reduced
  to As (III) by mycoredoxin 1 (Mrx1). Metabolic reactions are catalyzed by enzymes
  such as maleylpyruvate isomerase requiring mycothiol as a cofactor for growth on
  diverse carbon sources. Under stress conditions, proteins are oxidised to mixed
  disulfides with MSH to form S-mycothiolated proteins that is reversed by the Mrx1/Mtr/MSH
  pathway.
