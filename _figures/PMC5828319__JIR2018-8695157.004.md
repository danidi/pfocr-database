caption: CD200R-induced signaling pathway. Interaction of CD200R with its ligand induces
  phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues (red squares) present in the intracellular
  portion of the receptor mediated by kinases of the Src family. This mechanism propitiates
  recruitment of Dok2 through its binding domain to tyrosine (PTB). Dok2 binds to
  the phosphorylated tyrosines, and it recruits the activator protein of Ras-GTPase
  (RasGAP), which inhibits Ras and downstream ERK activation. ERK is a MAP kinase
  which is involved in macrophages activation by IFN-γ. JAK/STAT-1 signaling pathway
  is required for cell activation, and STAT-1 is phosphorylated by JAK proteins and
  ERK-1/2 in turn to allow the gene expression for cell differentiation, growth and
  metabolism, so then, if CD200R binds to its ligand CD200 it allows the inhibition
  of cell activation [, ].
