caption: Model for the regulation of Keratin 6, 16 and 17 during skin wounding and
  in psoriasis. During skin injury, damaged keratinocytes (KCs) release a variety
  of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as nucleic acids (RNA or DNA)
  and proteins (such as IL1β). Recognition of these DAMPs by their cognate receptors,
  such as IL1β by IL1R, EGF by EGFR, dsRNA by TLR3 and/or VEGF by VEGFR, lead to the
  activation of downstream signaling molecules, including MAPKs (ERK1/2 and p38) and
  transcription factors CEBPβ, NFκB, NRF2 and AP1, which then translocate to the nucleus
  and mediate the transcription of K6, 16 and 17. K6 protein can interact with myosin
  IIA, promoting cell adhesion and resilience that is necessary for KCs to resist
  mechanical stress during wounding. Furthermore, the K17 protein can promote protein
  synthesis and cell proliferation by activating the mTOR-AKT pathway. K17 can also
  translocate to the nucleus, regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  through chromatin binding and transcription. In addition, peptides derived from
  K17 can function as autoantigens to activate conventional DCs (cDC), which then
  secrete cytokines (TNF, IL12 and IL23) that promote Th1, Th17 and/or Th22 T cell
  activation. T cell-derived cytokines, including IFNγ, IL17A and IL22, can in turn
  act on their respective cell receptors that are expressed on keratinocytes, leading
  to activation of the ERK1/2 and STAT1/3, which further increases the expression
  of keratin genes, forming an autoimmune positive feedback loop that ultimately drives
  psoriasis pathogenesis.
