caption: Simplified diagrams for agrin-induced signaling. (A) At the NMJ secreted
  agrin-z+ binds to Lrp4 and activates (arrows) MuSK and Dok-7. Rac/Cdc42 is activated
  dowstream of Dok-7, which leads to AChR clustering, to activation of MAP2K7, JNK
  and ultimately to transcriptional stimulation of postsynaptic genes such as MuSK
  and AChR subunits. Agrin-z+-induced Lrp4/MuSK activation also stimulates MEK1/2
  and ERK1/2 transiently (thinner arrows), which activates a negative feedback loop
  that inhibits AChR clustering (T-shape line). For much more detailed diagrams of
  agrin signaling at the NMJ please see reference . (B) In cortical and/or hippocampal
  neurons that bear excitatory synapses, soluble agrin-z+ may bind to Lrp4/MuSK, which
  might activate ERK1/2, which in turn would phosphorylate CREB. Phosphorylated CREB
  would stimulate transcription of genes that directly or indirectly influence synaptogenesis
  or synapse stability (i.e., “synaptic” genes). Electrical activity-dependent cleavage
  of full-length agrin (N-agrin-C) in the ECM by neurotrypsin releases a 22-kDa C-terminal
  fragment (agrin-C) that may bind α3 Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), to stimulate filopodial
  formation. The involvement of MAPKs in this pathway is unknown (MAPKs?). An unknown
  ligand may bind to transmembrane agrin (TM agrin), leading to formation of dendritic
  filopodia via activation of ERK1/2 dowstream of the Src-family tyrosine kinase Fyn.
  (?) These steps have not been confirmed experimentally. For references see text.
