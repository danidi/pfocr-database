caption: Model of rapid glucocorticoid signaling in PVN parvocellular neuroendocrine
  cells. A, Glucocorticoids (CORT) bind to a membrane-associated receptor (mbGR) and
  activate a G protein-dependent intracellular signaling pathway that leads to endocannabinoid
  (CB) synthesis and retrograde release. Endocannabinoids bind to presynaptic CB1
  cannabinoid receptors and suppress glutamate release from glutamate synapses onto
  the PVN neuron. B, Proposed membrane glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway.
  In this model, the membrane glucocorticoid receptor (mbGR) is a stimulatory G protein-coupled
  receptor (Gs) that, upon binding corticosterone (CORT), triggers the activation
  of adenylyl cyclase and the production of cAMP, resulting in increased PKA activity,
  which leads downstream to endocannabinoid synthesis from membrane lipid precursors
  followed by release.
