caption: Depiction of the cone-specific retinoid (visual) cycle as it is presently
  understood. The pathway involves the actions of enzymes and other proteins present
  in Müller cells and cone photoreceptors within the retina. The metabolic role and
  location of AWAT2 in this pathway is designated with the label “ARAT”. All-trans-retinol
  within the Müller cells is thought to undergo enzyme-catalyzed isomerization to
  11-cis-retinol through the actions of dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES-1). 11-Cis-retinol
  after its translocation to the cone photoreceptors undergoes oxidation catalyzed
  by an 11-cis-retinol retinol dehydrogenase (11-cis-RDH) forming 11-cis-retinaldehyde,
  which binds to cone opsins forming visual pigment. The figure was taken directly
  from Reference .
