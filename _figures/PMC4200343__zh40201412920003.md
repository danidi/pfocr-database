caption: Metabolism of [1-13C]pyruvate. Flux through PDH leads to production of 13CO2,
  but there are 3 other possible sources in a single turn of the TCA cycle. After
  carboxylation by PC, the 13C label can become symmetrized by exchange between malate
  and fumarate (faded circle). Subsequent flux through the malic enzyme produces 13CO2
  but the fractional enrichment has a maximal value of 50%. Alternatively, after carboxylation,
  a forward turn of the TCA cycle could eliminate a 13CO2 at the step of isocitrate
  dehydrogenase (shaded circle). This pathway could have a maximal enrichment equal
  to the exogenous pyruvate. Finally, after symmetrization at fumarate, a forward
  turn of the TCA cycle could produce a 13CO2 at α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.
