caption: 'Pathways of binding, internalization and processing by immunotoxins and
  ADCs leading to the killing of target cells. 1. A PE-derived immunotoxin binds CD22,
  is internalized via clathrin-coated pits, is processed within the cell, trafficks
  through the ER to the cytosol where an enzymatically active fragment ADP-ribosylates
  EF2, which inhibits protein synthesis leading to cell death. 2. A DT-based toxin,
  targeted to the IL2 receptor, is internalized to endosomes where the A chain of
  the toxin is released to the cytosol: it also ADP-ribosylates EF2, inhibiting protein
  synthesis leading to cell death. 3. ADCs bind target receptors, are internalized
  and traffic to lysosomes. In the lysosome, drugs are cleaved from the carrier antibody
  and then released to the cytosol to target tubulin (for auristatin and maytansine)
  or DNA (for calicheamicin). The pathway for ricin-based immunotoxins (not shown)
  resembles that of PE except its cytosolic target is the ribosomal RNA. Ricin-mediated
  depurination of rRNA results in inhibition of protein synthesis.'
