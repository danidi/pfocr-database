caption: A)FA/BRCA DNA damage response pathway. Following DNA damage, the proteins
  represented by A, B, C, E, F, G, L, and M form the core complex which is required
  for ubiquitination of the I and D2 proteins, which are in turn, required for the
  downstream complex of D2-ubi, I-ubi, and D1/BRCA1, N/PALB2, and J/BACH1/BRIP1 to
  form foci for DNA repair. Only BRCA1 is not yet known to be a FA gene. Adapted from
  Shimamura and Alter Blood Reviews 2010;24(3):101-22B) Approximate timeline and methods
  of gene discovery in FA
