caption: Dysregulation of the unfolded protein response is an emerging theme in neurodegenerative
  disease. Smith and Mallucci present mechanistic insights into this phenomenon from
  animal models that explain human neuropathological findings. They report that modulation
  of the pathway can have profound neuroprotective effects, with therapeutic implications
  for the treatment of dementia.
