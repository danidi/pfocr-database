caption: 'Apoptosis pathways. Apoptosis pathways can be initiated at the level of
  the mitochondria by the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, Smac
  or AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol (mitochondrial
  or intrinsic pathway) []. Smac promotes apoptosis by neutralizing “Inhibitor of
  Apoptosis Proteins” (IAP)-mediated inhibition of caspase-3 and -9 []. Alternatively,
  apoptosis can be triggered by ligation of death receptors (DR) such as CD95 or TRAIL
  receptors by their cognate ligands, i.e. CD95 ligand or TRAIL (receptor or extrinsic
  pathway) []. Death receptor stimulation in turn leads to receptor trimerization,
  recruitment of adaptor molecules such as FADD and activation of the initiator caspase-8,
  which propagates the death signal to effector caspases such as caspase-3 [–]. The
  BH3 domain only protein Bid links the receptor to the mitochondrial pathway []:
  Bid is activated by caspase-8-mediated cleavage and translocates to mitochondria
  to promote cytochrome c release. Apoptosis can be inhibited by at various levels,
  e.g. by FLIP, Bcl-2 or IAPs [, , ].'
