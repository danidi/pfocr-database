caption: A proposed mechanistic model on how SHARPIN regulates TNF-induced NF-κB activation
  through linear ubiquitination-mediated mechanisms. TNF ligation induces TNFR1 trimerization
  and promotes the assembly of a multiprotein complex named TNF-RSC (TNF receptor
  signalling complex), which is composed of adaptor protein TRADD, TRAF2/5 and E3
  ubiquitin ligases cIAP1/2. The signalling transduction then bifurcates into ‘TNFR-Lys63
  Ub’ and ‘TNFR-linear Ub’ branches that are dependent upon different ubiquitin-dependent
  regulatory strategies. The first downstream ‘TNFR-Lys63 Ub’ cascade utilizes the
  E3 ligases cIAP1/2 to catalyse the formation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains to
  RIP1, which recruits and brings in spatial proximity the two kinase complexes TAK1-TAB2/3
  and NEMO-IKKα-IKKβ. The activated kinase TAK1 then phosphorylates IKKα, which further
  phosphorylates IκBα to promote its proteasomal degradation. The other downstream
  ‘TNFR-linear Ub’ cascade employs linear ubiquitin chain-dependent mechanisms. TNF-RSC
  can function as a platform to attract LUBAC components, including HOIL1, HOIP and
  SHARPIN. LUBAC induces the formation of the linear ubiquitin chain to NEMO, which
  in turn recruits the kinase complex TAK1-TAB2/3. TAK1 then phosphorylates and activates
  the IKK complex similar to the ‘TNFR-Lys63 Ub’ pathway. Both ‘TNFR-Lys63 Ub’ and
  ‘TNFR-Linear Ub’ cascades converge at the IκBα-RELA-p50 complex that migrates into
  the nucleus for downstream gene activation after IκBα release and degradation.

  description: A proposed mechanistic model on how SHARPIN regulates TNF-induced NF-κB
