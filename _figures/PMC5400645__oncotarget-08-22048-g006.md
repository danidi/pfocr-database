caption: After specific and affine binding of the immunotoxin to the HER2 receptor
  (1), it internalizes via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (2). The internalized immunotoxin
  undergoes both lysosomal degradation (3) and productive trafficking into Golgi apparatus
  (4). In Golgi apparatus the C-terminal KDEL sequence of the immunotoxin binds to
  the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R) that mediates the protein retrograde transport into endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) (5). Somewhere along the transport pathway the immunotoxin molecule
  possibly undergoes enzymatic processing resulting in separation of functionally
  active PE fragment that comes out of ER into the cytoplasm (6) and inhibits protein
  synthesis there (7). Protein synthesis inhibition leads to apoptosis of target cell
  (8).
