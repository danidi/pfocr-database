caption: The sequential proteolytic degradation of amyloid precursor proteins results
  in the generation of Aβ peptides, ultimately leading to the progression of Alzheimer's
  disease. Black arrows represent nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor
  protein and red arrows represent the amyloidogenic pathway.
