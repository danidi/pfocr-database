caption: Schematic of networks used to generate simulated data. Illustrative schematic
  of the two pathways used to generate the simulated data. (a) The Linear network
  of 30 nodes/gene products, each of which is associated with one gene. The pair of
  squiggly lines across some arrows is used to indicate that there are more nodes
  that are not shown. (b) The Erbb signaling pathway from the KEGG pathway database
  []. The expressions of the genes associated with the nodes circled in red are correlated
  with each other and are the genes that were affected by the treatment.
