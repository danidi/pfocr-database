caption: The IL-23/T17 pathogenic axis is an important therapeutic target in psoriasis.
  IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine that is released by dendritic cells and binds
  to the IL-23 receptor (IL23R) on T17 cells. IL-23R is associated with Jak2 and Tyk2,
  which activate STAT3 molecules, resulting in the upregulation of IL-17A. Engagement
  of IL-17R on keratinocytes with IL-17A homodimers or IL-17A/IL-17F heterodimers
  induces the activation of NF-κB dimers, which translocate to the nucleus and drive
  the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides.
  Numerous genes (yellow) encoding proteins involved in the IL-23/T17 pathway have
  been shown by genome-wide association studies to confer psoriasis susceptibility.
  Following activation of IL-17R, ACT1 (encoded by TRAF3IP2) interacts with TRAF proteins
  and the IκB kinase complex (IKK). IKK subsequently phosphorylates the inhibitory
  proteins IκB (IκBα is encoded by NFKBIA), which normally form cytoplasmic complexes
  with NF-κB. Once phosphorylated, IκB is subject to ubiquitin-induced proteasomal
  degradation, resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Further, the protein
  products of TNFAIP3 and TNIP1, A20 and ABIN1, respectively, physically interact
  to enable the ubiquitin-mediated destruction of NEMO (a regulatory protein that
  activates IKK). Several medications for psoriasis (red) target components of the
  IL-23/T17 immune axis
