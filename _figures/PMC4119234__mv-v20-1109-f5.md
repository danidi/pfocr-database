caption: Succinate and the GPR91 signaling pathway in the retinas of STZ-induced diabetic
  rats. Each solid line and arrow denotes a step in an activating pathway. Succinate
  accumulation triggered by hyperglycemia activates GPR91 signaling, sequentially
  activating ERK1/2 and then upregulating COX-2 and PGE2 expression, and later increasing
  VEGF release in retinal ganglion cells. The increase of VEGF induces retinal vascular
  dysfunction and plays a key role in the pathology of diabetic retinopathy. The long
  dashed line and vertical lines denotes a step in an inhibiting pathway. U0126 blocks
  the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the downstream expression of COX-2, PGE2, and VEGF.
  NS-398 blocks COX-2 and PGE2 and decreases PGE2-mediated VEGF synthesis.
