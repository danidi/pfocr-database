caption: 'In this figure, we consider potential mechanisms regulated by physical activity
  and caloric restriction in inhibiting the mTOR pathway. Both refer to energy availability
  inhibiting carcinogenesis by suppressing the activation of the mTOR signaling network
  in this subtype of mammary carcinoma. The mTOR inhibition is mediated through the
  effects of vigorous PA or long-term exercise on systemic response such as concentrations
  of the circulating growth factors and hormones (i.e., IGF-1 and insulin) that regulate
  the mTOR network. The network is controlled through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway,
  the glycaemia and glutamine levels, inducing apoptosis and reversing malignancy-associated
  metabolic programming. Moreover, the control of energy availability by both exercise
  and CR induces a mitohormetic response that accounts for a physiological cellular
  stress adaptation through AMPK activation inducing mTOR inhibition. In this context,
  exercise should be considered in terms of its four components: frequency, intensity,
  time, and type; however, dose-dependent effects of each component on cancer protection
  via mTOR inhibition have not yet been clarified. Most data indicate that vigorous
  PA, either long-term or in adulthood, may reduce a woman''s risk of mammarian cancer,
  especially TNBC relapse. The inhibition of the mTOR complex and its cell growth-promoting
  functions leads to a reduction of cell proliferation, control of cancer progression,
  and consequent autophagy induction probably involved in tumorigenesis prevention.
  Thus, we hypothesized that the exercise-induced inhibition of the mTOR pathway may
  be useful in the control of cancer progression, including TNBC. PA: physical activity;
