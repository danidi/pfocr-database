caption: Schematic diagram of FSS regulating osteoclasts bone resorption function
  via ERK5 signaling pathway (green arrows are positively adjusted; red arrows are
  negatively adjusted; red lines are decreased due to inhibition of upstream proteins).
  FSS – fluid shear stress; ERK5 – extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5.
