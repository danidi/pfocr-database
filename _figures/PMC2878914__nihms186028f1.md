caption: (A) Differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells is modulated by the key regulators
  PPARγ (adipogenesis) and Wnt (osteogenesis). A host of NHRs play a role in modulating
  the activity of these two key regulators. Glucocorticoid inhibits Wnt signaling
  by increasing the expression of Wnt antagonists DKK and sFRP (extracellular) and
  Axin (intracellular) and also by decreasing the expression of Wnts. PPARγ is also
  able to inhibit Wnt signaling by inducing the degradation of β-catenin under specific
  conditions. VDR can modulate differentiation by inhibiting DKK and sFRP, which pushes
  the cells towards osteoblast differentiation. Wnt, itself, can propagate osteogenesis
  by inhibiting PPARγ activity via the expression of Cyclin D1 and c-myc, which bind
  to PPARγ and inhibit its activity. β-catenin also increases the expression COUP-TFII,
  which represses PPARγ transcription. (B) Embryonic stem cells differentiate down
  a neuronal path under the influence of retinoic acid (RA), which is known to inhibit
  the Wnt pathway. RA activity also induces body axis extension in the developing
  embryo. This Wnt inhibition is, in part, effected by an RA-mediated increase in
  Wnt antagonists, Fzd and DKK. Wnts are responsible for caudal development in the
  mouse and dorsal development in the frog. A potential negative-feedback loop occurs
  during Wnt-mediated inhibition of CYP26, an enzyme that metabolizes RA. (C) Keratinocyte
  stem cells differentiate into sebocytes, follicle keratinocytes or epidermal keratinocytes,
  which comprise the interfollicular epidermis. VDR and β-catenin cooperate to induce
  differentiation into follicle keratinocytes, however, perturbation of β-catenin
  or VDR (independently of each other) leads to cysts that contain epidermal keratinocytes
  and sebocytes.
