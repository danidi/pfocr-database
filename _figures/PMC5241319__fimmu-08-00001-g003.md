caption: The role of systemic complement in metabolism. Metabolically active proteins
  can activate systemic complement in the absence of infection. For example, adiponectin
  activates directly C1q, which results in the generation of C3a and C5a fragments
  via classical pathway activation. The anaphylatoxins are further processed by carboxypeptidase
  N (CPN) to C3a-desArg and C5a-desArg, which then impact on triglyceride (TG) clearance,
  increase insulin resistance, and alter adiposity by affecting signaling through
  the three anaphylatoxin receptors C3aR, C5aR1, and C5aR2 in several cell types such
  as adipocytes and pancreatic β-cells via diffusion into respective tissues. Importantly,
  although not yet formally proven, locally generated and activated complement also
  likely affects adipocytes activity as these cells are a major source of Factor D
  and can also synthesize and secrete other complement proteins such as Factor B,
  C3, and C5. These proteins, when secreted, form extracellular C3 and C5 convertases
  and generate locally C3a and C5a fragments, which engage their respective receptors
  and trigger AKT and NF-κB signaling that contributes to adipocyte development and
  activity.
