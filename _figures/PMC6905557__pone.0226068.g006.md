number: Fig 6
caption: A) The functionally grouped network of KEGG pathway and gene ontology terms
  that are presented as nodes and linked to each other based on the similarity of
  their associated genes using ClueGo app along with Cytoscape software. B) Magnification
  of the highest significant node revealed the most significant node as the cell cycle
  pathway (P ≤ 0.001). The square node represents the KEGG pathway, the circle nodes
  represent biological processes, and triangle nodes represent molecular function,
  while the colors denote clustered genes associated with the biological category
  and the size of node represents the P values (0.05 as cutoff value). CluePedia app
  shows the genes for each node where the thickness of edges reflects the GO evidence
  code (thick line is based on experimental evidence whereas thin line is inferred
  from electronic annotation).
