caption: The involvement of zinc metalloproteinases in Aβ metabolism. A range of ADAMs
  (10, 17, 9, 8, 19, and 33) have been implicated in the nonamyloidogenic processing
  of APP to generate sAPPα and C83, although the evidence for the latter four enzymes
  having a direct physiological role in this respect is limited. ADAMs 9 and 15 are
  capable of cleaving ADAM10 and may be indirectly involved in the activation of the
  nonamyloidogenic pathway in this respect. Nardilysin also indirectly activates nonamyloidogenic
  processing of APP via an activation of ADAMs 9, 10, and 17. IDE, NEP, ECE-1, ECE-2,
  MMPs, GCPII and, possibly, ACE are involved directly in the degradation of Aβ, and
  a potential role for catalytically active ADAMs in the degradation of Aβ remains
  to be elucidated.
