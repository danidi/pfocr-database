caption: Roles of glial ion transporters in ischemic brain damage. Ischemic stroke
  results in an immediate marked reductions of intracellular pH (pHi) as a consequence
  of oxygen depletion, which necessitates a switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic
  glycolysis, leading to generation of intracellular lactic acid as well as protons.
  Several ion transporters/exchangers in astrocytes, microglia, and/or oligodendrocytes
  are activated to prevent the pHi dysregulation. In astrocytes, Na+–HCO3− cotransporter
  (NBC) transports HCO3− to alkalinize pHi. Stimulation of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform-1
  (NHE1) extrudes H+ in exchange of Na+ influx, which leads to astrocytic swelling
  and disruption of astrocytic end-feet function at the blood-brain barrier (BBB),
  and contributes to inflammation by secretion of various cytokines. The increased
  Na+ overload triggers the reversal operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCXrev) and
  causes intracellular overload of Ca2+, and reduces glutamate uptake via the Na+-dependent
  excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT). Astrocytic Na+–K+–Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1)
  activation also contributes to astrocyte swelling and cascade events as described
  above. In microglia, NHE1 maintains the optimal pHi for NADPH oxidase (NOX2) activation,
  together with NCXrev activation, promoting the release of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and contributes to oxidative injury. In oligodendrocytes, NKCC1 is activated
  via the upstream WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway, and triggers NCXrev function and enhances
  excitotoxicity and apoptosis. Taken together, NHE1, NCX, NKCC1, and NBC play important
  roles in regulation of astrocytic, microglial, and oligodendrocytic functions in
  response to ischemic stroke
