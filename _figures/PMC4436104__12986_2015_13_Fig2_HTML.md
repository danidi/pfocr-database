caption: Proposed mechanisms of effects of nitrate/nitrite on glucose homeostasis
  and insulin signaling. Nitrate/nitrite increase insulin secretion by increasing
  pancreatic islet blood flow (1) and activation of guanylyl cyclase and cGMP pathway
  (2). Nitrate/nitrite induce NO production and improve insulin resistance and glucose
  uptake by increasing gene expression of GLUT4 (3). Nitrate/nitrite increase nitrosation
  and insulin-independent translocation of GLUT4 and increase glucose uptake by skeletal
  muscle and adipose tissue (4). Nitrate/nitrite also inhibits production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) in adipoceytes and dephosphorylation activity of protein-tyrosine
  phosphatase 1B and then facilitate phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate
  and subsequently GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake (5). ROS; Reactive oxygen
