caption: 'Glucose and glutamine, the two most abundant extracellular nutrients, contribute
  carbon for the synthesis of the three major classes of macromolecules (nucleic acids,
  lipids and proteins) in proliferating tumor cells. Biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines
  utilizes ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) produced from diversion of glycolytic intermediates
  into the oxidative and non-oxidative arms of the pentose phosphate pathway, and
  nonessential amino acids derived from glucose and glutamine. Fatty acid synthesis,
  used to produce cellular lipids, requires acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA), most of which is
  generated from glucose and transferred from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm via
  citrate. Protein synthesis requires amino acids, tRNAs and ribosomes (proteins and
  rRNAs). Both glucose and glutamine are used to generate these molecules. In addition
  to its role as a carbon source, glutamine also donates nitrogen to nucleotide and
  amino acid synthesis. Abbreviations: P, phosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; Mal-CoA, malonyl-CoA.'
