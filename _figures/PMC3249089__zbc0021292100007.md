caption: Putative metabolic map of GlcCer synthesis in fungi. EGCrP1 controls the
  quality of GlcCer during production by converting the immature GlcCer to an immature
  ceramide, which follows the maturation pathway of ceramide. GlcCer surrounded by
  a dotted line shows the immature GlcCer found in egcrp1Δ.
