caption: Hypothesis for the role of TTR with T4 during myoblast differentiation. (A)
  Hypothetical figure depicting role of TTR with T4 during myoblast differentiation.
  (1) T4 enters cells via Mct8 by passive diffusion and is converted to T3 by D2 enzyme,
  which in turn triggers the expression of several genes including TTR. (2) Synthesized
  TTR is exocytosed through exosomes, and (3) subsequently enters the cells as TTR-T4
  complex via an endocytic mechanism. (4) T3 produced in the cells can exocytose via
  exosomes. (B) TTR positively regulates RXRγ and FNDC5 and triggers myogenic regulatory
  factors, hence promoting myogenesis. RXRγ and FNDC5 negatively regulate TTR while
  RXRγ and FNDC5 regulate each other.
