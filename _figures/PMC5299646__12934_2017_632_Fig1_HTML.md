caption: The SWITCH strategy for cell factory construction and optimization. Step
  1 The genomic engineering state is created by integrating casX. Note that a direct
  repeat flanks the KlURA3 marker allowing it to be recycled via direct repeat (DR)
  recombination. Step 2 In one transformation event several genes of interest (GOI)
  are simultaneously and marker-less integrated by the unified support of assembler
  and CasX. Step 3 The genomic engineering state is switched into the regulatory state,
  when CasX is directed to cleave its own gene sequence. The rescue DNA fragment contains
  either a codon optimized dcasX or a dcasX fused with a regulatory domain (dcasX ± RD)
  flanked by regions that are homologous to the integrated casX cassette. Alternatively,
  step 3* if the strain is finalized in step 2, the locus containing casX can be restored
  to wild type by the assistance of CasX and a rescue fragment containing the locus
  sequence. Step 4 In the regulatory state the regulator protein (dCasX or dCasX-RD)
  can be used to target both endogenous and heterologous GOI. Finally, after both
  step 3* and 4 the newly created cell factory can be characterized as part of a metabolic
  engineering cycle
