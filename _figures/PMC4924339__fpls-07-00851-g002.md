caption: Nucleoprotein complexes associated with mammalian and A. thaliana telomeres.
  (A) Mammalian shelterin proteins (TRF1/2, Rap1, TIN2, TPP, and Pot1) modulate access
  to the telomerase complex and the ATR/ATM dependent DNA damage response pathway.
  The CST complex (CTC1–STN1–TEN1) affects telomerase and DNA polymerase α recruitment
  to the chromosomal termini, and thus coordinates G-overhang extension by telomerase
  with fill-in synthesis of the complementary C-strand (blue dashed line; figure adopted
  from ). (B) Arabidopsis TRB1, 2 and 3 interact with the telomeric sequence due to
  the same Myb-like binding domain as mammalian TRF1/2 (; ; ). TRB proteins interact
  with TERT and Pot1b and when localized at chromosomal ends they are eligible to
  function as components of the plant shelterin complex, mainly at telomeres with
  a G-overhang (, ). An evolutionary conserved CST complex is suggested to coordinate
  the unique requirements for efficient replication of telomeric DNA in plants as
  well as in other organisms (). Blunt-ended telomeres are specifically recognized
  and protected by the KU70/80 heterodimer that directly interacts with TRP1, and
  by extension, with TERT (; ; ).
