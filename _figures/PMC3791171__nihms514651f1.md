caption: Shown in the middle of the figure is the classical MAPK pathway leading from
  an extracellular mitogenic stimulus that activates a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
  in the cell membrane, to RAS, RAF (shown as BRAF-V600E), MEK and ERK. ERK is activated
  by phosphorylation (P) and enters the nucleus where it upregulates tumour-promoting
  genes and downregulates tumour suppressor genes and thyroid iodide-handling genes.
  On the left side of the figure is the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, in which
  extracellular stimuli activate the pathway by acting on receptors in the cell membrane,
  leading to activation of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK), resulting in the
  phosphorylation of IκB. Phosphorylated IκB becomes dissociated from NF-κB, which
  is normally bound with IκB in a complex and sequestered in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylated
  IκB undergoes ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Free NF-κB then enters
  the nucleus to promote the expression of tumour-promoting genes. Through an undefined
  mechanism that is independent of MEK signalling, BRAF-V600E promotes the phosphorylation
  of IκB and the release of NF-κB, thus activating the NF-κB pathway. Shown on the
  right side of the figure is the RASSF1–mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1)–forkhead
  box O3 (FOXO3) pathway. Activated by extracellular pro-apoptotic stimuli through
  membrane receptors, RASSF1A activates MST1. Activated MST1 then phosphorylates FOXO3
  on Ser207. The resulting phosphorylated FOXO3 becomes dissociated from 14-3-3 proteins
  in the cytoplasm. 14-3-3 proteins undergo proteasomal degradation, and phosphorylated
  FOXO3 enters the nucleus to promote the expression of pro-apoptotic genes in the
  FOXO pathway. BRAF-V600E directly interacts with and inhibits MST1 and prevents
  its activation by RASSF1A, thereby suppressing the pro-apoptotic signalling of the
  FOXO3 pathway. The downward arrow for the FOXO activities shown in the nucleus indicates
  this negative effect of BRAF-V600E on pro-apoptotic genes, which are normally upregulated
  by the RASSF1A–MST1–FOXO3 pathway. The triple independent coupling of BRAF-V600E
  to the pathways shown here represents a unique and powerful mechanism of thyroid
  tumorigenesis driven by BRAF-V600E. DAPK1, death-associated protein kinase 1; HIF1A,
