caption: Simplified view of the TWEAK-Fn14 signalling pathway. The selection of the
  probe genes to be monitored upon treatment with peptides and/or TWEAK was based
  on the analysis of Reactome [] and NetSlim [] databases, and a manual curation of
  TWEAK-Fn14 signalling pathway []. Downstream TWEAK-Fn14 activation complex, recruitment
  of the TRAF cofactor molecules, through NIK stabilization, engages ERSRP and non-canonical
  activation of NFkB. MAP3Ks cascades activation lead JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)
  and engagement of p38 (MAPK14), which results in their translocation to the nucleus,
  wherein they modulate gene expression.
