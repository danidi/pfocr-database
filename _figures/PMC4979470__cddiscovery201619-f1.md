caption: The NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires
  an initial ‘signal 1’, such as toll-like receptor or TNF receptor activation, that
  activates NF-κB. This priming signal induces the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β
  and also results in post-translational modification of the NLRP3 protein, which
  is required for activation. A second NLRP3-specific activation signal (‘signal 2’,
  such as the metabolic substances indicated) triggers conformational changes resulting
  in the oligomerization of NLRP3. The adapter molecule ASC is recruited through Pyrin
  domain interactions with NLRP3 and forms large prion-like oligomers. The ASC CARD
  domain interacts with caspase-1 and ASC oligomers provide a scaffold for caspase-1
  dimerization, autocatalytic processing and the generation of active caspase-1. Active
  caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their active mature forms, which
  are secreted. Caspase-1 also cleaves Gasdermin-D resulting in inflammatory cell
  death (pyroptosis).
