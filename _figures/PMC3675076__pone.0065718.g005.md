caption: Following Hh/Ptch interaction, Smo triggers a signaling cascade leading to
  Gli2 deacetylation and to the inhibition of the βTrCP-regulated balance between
  Gli2R and full length Gli2 (Gli2A). Both events contributes to the early signal-dependent
  activation of the Hh pathway. Once activated, Gli2 promotes transcription of Gli1,
  whose activity is also regulated by Hh-induced HDAC1-mediated deacetylation, thus
  generating a positive feedback loop (late activation).
