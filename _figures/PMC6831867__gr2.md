caption: 'Metabolic interplay between various ROS generators. ROS generator interplay
  is summarized in three major pathways: 1) NOX-ROS promoted Mt-ROS generation. In
  response to activation signaling, such as AngII, NOX1/2 located in PM/ER/ES can
  be activated via PKC-induced P47phox phosphorylation. Extracellular O2•- generated
  from PM-located NOX1/2 can be dismutated by SOD3 to form H2O2 which then diffuses
  into the cytosol via AQP, while intracellular O2•- generated from ER/ES-located
  NOX1/2 can be dismutated by SOD1 to form H2O2. 1a) ROS produced by Mt ETC. NOX1/2-derived
  H2O2 can activate Mt-KATP via PKC-ε signaling, leading to the K+ influx, decrease
  of Mt membrane potential (ΔΨm), inhibition of Mt complex I (Com I) and finally the
  increase of Mt O2•- production. 1b) ROS produced by NOX4 in Mt. In certain cell
  types such as CM and EC, NOX4 isoform is detected at the Mt. Increase expression
  of NOX4 by activation signaling such as AngII/Gαq pathway can directly contribute
  to the increase of Mt ROS. 2) Mt-ROS activated NOX-ROS generation. In Mt, O2•- generated
  by Com I is mainly released to Mt matrix and dismutated by SOD2 to H2O2, while O2•-
  generated by Com III can be released to either Mt matrix or intermembrane space
  and dismutated by SOD1. A small amount of Mt O2•- can be transported to the cytosol
  by VDAC directly and then dismutated by SOD1 to form H2O2. Mt-generated H2O2 can
  be leaked to the cytosol through water channel aquaporin (AQP). Mt-derived H2O2
  then further activates NADPH oxidase by two pathways: 2a) The p47phox phosphorylation
  via activating PKC/cSrc; 2b) The increased expression of P22phox/NOX1/2/4 probably
  via c-Src activation. 3) NOX/Mt-ROS regulated eNOS/XR-ROS. Cytosolic O2•- from Mt
  or NADPH oxidase can react with NO to form ONOO−, resulting in eNOS uncoupling via
  depletion of BH4, or XR to XO transformation via oxidation of critical thiols in
  Cys535/992. O2•- is generated by XO and uncoupled eNOS. Abbreviation: AngII, Angiotensin
