caption: 'Proposed signaling pathway for TOB-1-mediated progesterone signaling.Notes:
  TOB-1 was involved in the growth arrest pathway in response to progesterone in MCF-7
  cells. The binding of progesterone to progesterone receptor may activate the downstream
  TOB-1 signaling pathway. At the same time, progesterone can produce ROS, which may
  result in a change in the antioxidant enzyme balance. Furthermore, it can activate
  PTEN, which creates an interaction with the tumor suppressor TOB-1 and leads to
  a change in cell growth properties through its interaction with other tumor-suppressor
  proteins. The red and green upward arrows indicate upregulation of the specific
  proteins; the red downward arrows indicate downregulation of the specific proteins.Abbreviations:
  PG, progesterone; PR, progesterone receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD,
  superoxide dismutase.'
