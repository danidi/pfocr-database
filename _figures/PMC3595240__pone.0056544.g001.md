caption: Pheromone (α factor) binds to a G-protein coupled receptor (Ste2). Binding
  promotes dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein into Gα and Gβγ. Free Gβγ
  initiates downstream signaling by forming a complex with the scaffold protein Ste5
  at the plasma membrane, as well as the small GTPase Cdc42, the adaptor protein Ste50
  and the kinase Ste20. Ste5 further recruits the MAPK cascade members, Ste11, Ste7
  and Fus3. Once this complex forms, Ste20 phosphorylates and activates Ste11; Ste11
  then phosphorylates and activates Ste7; Ste7 phosphorylates and activates the MAPK
  Fus3. Dashed arrows indicate phosphorylation of proteins involved in the pheromone
  response shown here; solid arrows show connections to the high osmolarity response
  pathway, filamentation pathway, cell cycle control and polarized growth. Ste11 also
  participates in the hyper-osmotic response and the filamentation MAPK pathways,
  and Ste7 also participates in the filamentation pathway. Active Fus3 executes the
  different cellular responses to pheromone by phosphorylating and activating the
  transcriptional complex of Ste12, Dig1 and Dig2 to express the pheromone responsive
  target genes. In addition to transcriptional activation, Fus3 also arrests the cell
  cycle and initiates polarized growth. Figure omits other phosphorylation events
  and feedback. Phosphorylation events on the proteins Ste50, Dig1 and Ste12 (shaded
  in black) are the focus of this work.

  description: Pheromone (α factor) binds to a G-protein coupled receptor (Ste2).
    Binding promotes dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein into Gα and Gβγ.
    Free Gβγ initiates downstream signaling by forming a complex with the scaffold
    protein Ste5 at the plasma membrane, as well as the small GTPase Cdc42, the adaptor
    protein Ste50 and the kinase Ste20. Ste5 further recruits the MAPK cascade members,
    Ste11, Ste7 and Fus3. Once this complex forms, Ste20 phosphorylates and activates
    Ste11; Ste11 then phosphorylates and activates Ste7; Ste7 phosphorylates and activates
    the MAPK Fus3. Dashed arrows indicate phosphorylation of proteins involved in
    the pheromone response shown here; solid arrows show connections to the high osmolarity
    response pathway, filamentation pathway, cell cycle control and polarized growth.
    Ste11 also participates in the hyper-osmotic response and the filamentation MAPK
    pathways, and Ste7 also participates in the filamentation pathway. Active Fus3
    executes the different cellular responses to pheromone by phosphorylating and
    activating the transcriptional complex of Ste12, Dig1 and Dig2 to express the
    pheromone responsive target genes. In addition to transcriptional activation,
    Fus3 also arrests the cell cycle and initiates polarized growth. Figure omits
