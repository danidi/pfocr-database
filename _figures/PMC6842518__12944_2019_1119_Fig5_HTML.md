caption: Proposed model depicting the underlying molecular mechanism by which aqueous
  bark extract of T. arjuna exerts pro-apoptotic effect on macrophage and foam cells.
  TA promotes macrophage and foam cell apoptosis by directly modulating JNK, p38MAPK-CHOP
  pathway in a DUSP1-dependent manner (indicated by red coloured lines), and may also
  augment ox-LDL induced UPR-mediated activation of JNK and p38MAPK-CHOP cascade (black
  coloured lines), suggesting a possible interplay between the ER stress- and TA-mediated
  MAPK signaling (denoted by bidirectional arrow)
