caption: Network diagram representing the regulatory effects with top consistency
  scores. After RhoE-knockout, the top network, which yielded a consistency score=8.043,
  was 'adhesion of endothelial cells, recruitment of myeloid cells'. Possible regulatory
  pathways regulating the recruitment of myeloid cells and adhesion of endothelial
  cells are displayed.
