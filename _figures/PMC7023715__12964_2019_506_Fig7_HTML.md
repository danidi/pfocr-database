caption: Activation of the PDGFRα-Nrf2 anti-adipogenic signaling pathway impairs adipocyte
  differentiation in Nck1-deficient BM-MSCs. Nck1 deficiency in BM-MSCs results in
  enhanced PDGFRα signaling that leads to Nrf2 activation, which upon nuclear translocation
  induces expression of the anti-oxidant genes, Nqo1 and Hmxo1, as well as Pdgfa encoding
  PDGF-A, a specific ligand for PDGFRα. Increased PDGF-A expression could contribute
  to maintain higher activation of PDGFRα. Furthermore, PDGFRα-dependent Nrf2 induction
  leads to impaired adipocyte differentiation in Nck1 deficient BM-MSCs
