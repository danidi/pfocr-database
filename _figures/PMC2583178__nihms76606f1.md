caption: 'Biosynthetic routes to L-ascorbate in higher plants. The major L-galactose
  pathway is highlighted in yellow with intermediates in bold type []; alternative
  proposed biosynthetic routes are highlighted in blue [–]. Designations are given
  in italics for genes encoding known enzymes of the pathways; question marks indicate
  possible reactions where the gene and the specific enzyme have not yet been identified.
  The central reaction (and the first committed step for L-ascorbate synthesis) in
  the L-galactose pathway, which is catalyzed by VTC2 and VTC5, is shown in a larger
  font. Enzymes catalyzing the numbered reactions are: 1, hexokinase; 2, phosphoglucose
  isomerase; 3, phosphomannose isomerase (PMI); 4, phosphomannomutase (PMM); 5, GDP-D-mannose
  pyrophosphorylase; 6, GDP-D-mannose 3′,5′-epimerase (GME); 7, GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase;
  8, L-galactose-1-P phosphatase; 9, L-galactose dehydrogenase; 10, L-galactono-1,4-lactone
  dehydrogenase (GLDH); 11, nucleotide pyrophosphatase or sugar-1-P guanylyltransferase;
  12, sugar phosphatase; 13, sugar dehydrogenase; 14, L-gulono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase/oxidase;
  15, myo-inositol oxygenase; 16, uronate reductase; 17, aldonolactonase; 18, methylesterase;
  19, D-galacturonate reductase.'
