caption: Toll-like receptor pathways. TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are mostly
  expressed on the cell surface and bind to bacterial products. When activated by
  LPS, TLR4 is internalized onto an endosome surface. The internalization triggers
  the release of TIRAP/MyD88, activating the TRAF6 pathway and resulting in activation
  of transcription factors, NF-kB and AP-1. The release of TIRAP/MyD88 from TLR4 allows
  for the signaling by TRAM/TRIF to commence from the endosome, also activating NF-kB
  as well as the transcription factor, IRF3. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are located
  on internal vesicles and bind to bacterial and viral nucleic acids. TLR7, TLR8,
  and TLR9 each activate NF-kB, as well as the transcription factor, IRF7, through
  the MyD88 pathway. TLR3 is the only toll-like receptor that does not activate via
  the MyD88 pathway and instead activates NF-kB and IRF3 through the TRIF pathway.
