caption: General summary of altered mitochondrial functions in cancer cell life and
  death. a In normal non-transformed cells glucose is mainly metabolized through the
  glycolysis pathway and the resulting pyruvate enters the mitochondrial TCA cycle,
  producing reduced equivalents that are fed into the ETC to generate ATP with high
  efficiency through the OXPHOS. Antioxidant defenses and coupled respiration through
  OXPHOS maintain low levels of mitochondrial ROS. b Normal cells are sensitive to
  apoptotic stimuli triggered by different stresses that finally converge in BAK/BAX
  activation and MOMP with subsequent release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, stimulating
  the formation of the apoptosome and apoptotic cell death. c In cancer cells gain-of-function
  of oncogenes and loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes (such as MYC, HIF1α
  and TP53) results in altered metabolism, exemplified by the Warburg effect, characterized
  by high glucose consumption rates. Glucose is degraded through glycolysis to obtain
  biosynthetic intermediates and the resulting pyruvate is reduced to lactate to generate
  ATP. In this scenario, mitochondrial TCA is diverted to generate biosynthetic intermediates,
  which is accompanied by low OXPHOS activity and increased mitochondrial ROS production.
  NRF2 is upregulated in cancer cells to counteract ROS and permits cancer cells to
  withstand its deleterious effects. d Cancer cells, through the overexpression of
  anti-apoptotic proteins or inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins, counteract the
  action of BAX/BAK and evade MOMP formation. Besides this effect, mitochondrial cholesterol
  loading shields mitochondrial membrane, impairing BAK/BAX oligomerization in MOM
  and subsequent MOMP formation and represents an additional mechanism of cell death
  resistance in tumor cells
