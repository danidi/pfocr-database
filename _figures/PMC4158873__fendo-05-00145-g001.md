caption: Metabolic differences between normal and cancer cells are shown. In normal
  cells, glucose is metabolized to pyruvate, which is completely oxidized to CO2 through
  the TCA cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation process in the mitochondria. Only
  if O2 is limited, pyruvate is metabolized to lactate. Cancer cells convert most
  glucose to lactate regardless of the availability of O2 (the Warburg effect). Secretion
  of lactate favors tumor progression. The increased glucose utilization through glycolytic
  pathway generates metabolic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate, which is
  used for the synthesis of nucleic acids through the pentose phosphate pathway. Glutamate
  produced during glutaminolysis serves as the major substrate to refuel the TCA cycle.
  Citrate-derived acetyl CoA is used for lipid production. The increased synthesis
  of nucleic acid and lipids promote proliferation and growth of cancer cells.
