caption: Cells within the skeletal niche utilize long chain free fatty acids (LCFA)
  for energy generation via two complimentary cellular catabolic processes of the
  carnitine shuttle and β-oxidation. (A) Long chain fatty acids (LCFA) destined for
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation must first be activated and esterified to
  coenzyme A (CoA) via acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family members (ACSLs), which
  requires ATP and coenzyme A (CoA) yielding adenosine monophosphate (ANP) and inorganic
  pyrophosphate (PPi). Following these reactions the ‘carnitine shuttle’ transports
  fatty acyl groups via carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI) and II (CPTII), along
  with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) in to the mitochondria. (B) β-oxidation
  then utilizes two carbons of acyl-CoA by a series of reactions involving oxidation,
  hydration and cleavage ultimately generating acetyl-CoA from fatty acyl CoA. In
  additional to acetyl-CoA that can enter the Krebs cycle, β-oxidation also generates
  reducing equivalents FADH2 and NADH. Every round of β-oxidation utilizes two carbons
  (−2C) to generate acetyl-CoA. Additionally cells within the skeletal niche can acquire
  cholesterol via low density lipoprotein (LDL)-LDL receptor (LDLR) endocytosis or
  the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. (C) Circulating LDL particles will interact
  with LDL receptor (LDLR) on the cell surface which results in LDL-LDLR endocytosis.
  Within the cell these endosomes will fuse with the lysosome whereby lysosomal acid
  lipase (LAL) hydrolyzes cholesterol esters (CE) and triacylglycerols (TAGS) to free
  cholesterol and free fatty acids, respectively, while the LDLR is recycled back
  to the cell surface. Both sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and
  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulate intracellular cholesterol
  via modulation of LDLR expression. (D) Endogenous cholesterol biosynthetic pathway
  which utilizes 2 acetyl CoA molecules to yield acetoacetyl-CoA via acyl-CoA cholesterol
  acyltransferase (ACAT). The rate limiting step next converts 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate via HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Subsequent steps include
  isopentyl pyrophosphate (PP), farnesyl PP to squalene. Final stages will include
  the cyclization of squalene to ultimately form cholesterol. Cholesterol lowering
  statins impair HMGCR, while anti-resorptive bisphosphonates inhibit farnesyl disphosphate
  synthase.
