caption: Changes in AMPK activity may act through the acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC)–malonyl
  CoA–CPT1 pathway to regulate food intake and other metabolic processes. Other pathways
  downstream of AMPK, including possibly mTOR (), also mediate the effects of AMPK
  on energy balance and glucose homeostasis. An arrow represents stimulation, whereas
  a crossbar means inhibition.
