caption: Routes of AMPAR trafficking. AMPARs are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum
  and Golgi apparatus in the soma and are delivered into the dendrite via kinesin-dependent
  vesicular trafficking on microtubule networks prior to their insertion to the plasma
  membrane. Via lateral diffusion, surface AMPARs are incorporated into synapse and
  stabilized by postsynaptic density scaffolding proteins. Mature AMPARs undergo constitutive
  recycling through endosomal trafficking pathway. AMPARs are internalized from the
  plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and traffic to the early endosome.
  From early endosome, AMPARs can be delivered back to the plasma membrane either
  directly (fast recycling) or through recycling endosome, or entering the degradation
  pathway through late endosome. During LTD, the rate of AMPAR internalization outweighs
  the rate of AMPAR exocytosis, resulting in reduced number of synaptic AMPARs. Depending
  on the LTD stimulus, internalized AMPARs can either be retained in intracellular
  compartment or be degraded in lysosome. Conversely, during LTP, AMPARs are constantly
  delivered to the plasma membrane to induce early burst and long-term maintenance
  of synaptic potentiation. Under certain LTP stimuli, recycling endosomes containing
  AMPARs are directly inserted into dendritic spine exocytic domain, marked by the
  presence of t-SNARE syntaxin-4. The dendritic spine microdomain also includes a
  specialized endocytic zone, where AMPARs are rapidly internalized and recycled to
  provide a large pool of AMPARs during LTP. These highly complex pathways of AMPAR
  trafficking are tightly regulated by a series of orchestrated interactions with
  key intracellular regulatory molecules. Disruption of AMPAR binding to its interacting
  proteins shown in this diagram often leads to aberrant AMPAR trafficking, impaired
  synaptic plasticity and deficits in learning and memory.
