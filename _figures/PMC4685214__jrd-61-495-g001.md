caption: Signaling pathways leading to gonadotropin-induced activation of MAPK3/1
  in preovulatory follicles or cultured cumulus-oocyte complexes. The pathways are
  activated by LH, in vivo or in vitro, in the model of whole-follicle cultures. In
  the follicles, LH-induced generation of EGF-like peptides (AREG, EREG) occurs in
  mural granulosa cells, and EGFR-related signaling may occur in both mural granulosa
  and cumulus cells. The depicted pathways were also identified in cultured cumulus-oocyte
  complexes stimulated by FSH. The gonadotropins bind to their receptors and activate
  G-proteins that ensure transduction of the signals to effector enzymes and kinases.
  The activation of MEK/MAPK upstream kinase (B-Raf, c-Raf) occurs via ligand- (AREG)
  or PKC/Src-induced transactivation of EGFR. Whether Src- or PI3K-mediated activation
  of Ras or Raf, passing by EGFR, exist in mammalian follicles, has yet to be confirmed.
  The prolonged activity of EGFR/MAPK3/1 observed in gonadotropin-stimulated granulosa
  and cumulus cells is maintained by regulatory feedback loops involving the production
  of PGE2 and signaling via PGE2R. This signaling involves a MAPK14 inhibitor-sensitive
  expression of EGF-like peptides, which bind to EGFR, and the activation of PI3K/AKT,
  the target of which needs to be specified. The resumption of oocyte meiosis is triggered
  by posttranscriptional mechanisms, comprising mainly phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  events affecting the production and transport of cGMP in the cumulus-oocyte complex.
  However, a global change in the granulosa/cumulus cell transcriptomes is essential
  for successful completion of the maturation and ovulation processes. The transcription
  factors identified so far are depicted, as well as some of the genes participating
  in the regulation of granulosa/cumulus cell functions associated with oocyte maturation
  and cumulus expansion. The figure is predominantly based on studies curried out
  on rodent and pig models; some parts of the depicted pathway have been confirmed
  in other mammalian species.
