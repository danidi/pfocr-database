caption: The diagram of potential mechanisms of RR in EAE treatment. In multiple sclerosis
  (MS), macrophage is activated by bacteria or viruses or other environmental stimuli,
  leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and free radicals via activation
  of NF-κB signaling pathway. Produced ROS/RNS directly destruct the structure of
  myelin sheath and neurons. On the one hand, in our study, RR could directly scavenge
  ONOO−, a representative RNS. On the other hand, RR also suppressed the production
  of ONOO− though inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway.
