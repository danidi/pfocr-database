caption: Biosynthesis of the sialyl-Tn antigen. In the biosynthetic pathway that forms
  the sialyl-Tn (STn) antigen, a family of polypeptide N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-transferases
  (ppGalNAcT) initially adds a GalNAc residue to Ser or Thr of the peptide. This is
  followed by the addition of sialic acid in α2-6 linkage to GalNAc, catalysed by
  a family of α6-sialyltransferases (ST6GalNAc), and produces the STn antigen. Although
  GalNAc can be further converted to core structures, STn can only be a substrate
  for an O-acetylation reaction to produce O-acetyl-STn that is not recognized by
  anti-STn antibodies. Bars across the arrows indicate a block in the biosynthetic
  pathway.
