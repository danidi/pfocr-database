caption: Scheme of the biosynthetic pathway of myo-inositol and the metabolic regulation
  strategy in Synechocystis. The genetic modifications made in this study were highlighted.
  The conversion of glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) to myo-inositol (MI) was catalyzed
  by inositol-1-phosphate synthase (INO1) and myo-inositol-1-monophosphatase (Sll1329
  and Sll1383). The phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi), phosphofructokinase (PfkA), and
  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf) were downregulated by a small RNA tool to
  direct G-6-P to MI biosynthesis.
