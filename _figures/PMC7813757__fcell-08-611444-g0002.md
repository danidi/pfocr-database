caption: How TLR agonist promotes the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy. CTLA-4
  is expressed on the surface of CD8+ T cell, combining with B7 on dendritic cells
  (DCs), to regulate T cell responses. CTLA-4 pathway can be blocked by anti-CTLA-4
  antibodies. TLR agonist activates TLR on DC. Activated TLRs pathway can induce proliferation
  or activation of CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages and NK-cells, and depletion of M2
  macrophages and Tregs. CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages and NK-cells recognize and kill
  tumor cells in TME. PD-1 is expressed on CD8+ T cell. PD-L1 is expressed on tumor
  cell. The combination of PD-1 with PD-L1 inhibits the anti-tumor effect of T cells,
  that can be blocked by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. TLR agonist and anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1
  antibodies play a synergistic role in anti-tumor immunotherapy. TLR, toll-like receptor;
