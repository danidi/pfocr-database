caption: 'Mechanisms by which SND1 promotes oncogenesis. Downstream molecules that
  are upregulated, downregulated or degraded due to over expression of SND1 causing
  a variety of functions to go into disarray leading to tumorigenesis. Each color
  represents the specific cancer in which the mechanism has been studied. In prostate
  cancer regulation of spliceosome assembly by SND1 results in the production of an
  oncogenic variant of CD44 that promotes proliferation, motility and invasion. Tumor
  suppressor mRNAs that are targets of oncogenic miRNAs are degraded when SND1 over
  expression confers increased RISC activity in human HCC cells. SND1 increases AT1R
  mRNA stability, causing an increase in AT1R levels resulting in activation of ERK
  and TGFβ signaling pathway, promoting EMT and migration and invasion by human HCC
  cells. SND1 mediates endonucleolytic decay of tumor suppressor miRNAs in HEK293T
  cells promoting upregulation of oncogenic proteins. In breast cancer cells, SND1
  promotes expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, leading to RhoA ubiquitination
  and degradation, disrupting F-actin cytoskeletal organization, increasing cell migration
  and invasion, and promoting metastasis. SND1: staphylococcal nuclease and tudor
  domain containing 1; HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma'
