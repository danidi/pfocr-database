caption: FGF21 induces preventive effect on CVDs through multiple signaling pathways.
  As a classical cytokine, FGF21 functions as a metabolic regulator by binding with
  its receptor FGFR1 or FGFR2 in the presence of β-klotho. Growing studies demonstrated
  that FGF21 also induced beneficial effects on CVDs probably due to inhibition of
  glucose or lipid metabolic disorders. For instance, FGF21 prevented atherosclerosis
  and the subsequent CHD by inhibition of lipogenesis which was also the possible
  mechanism of FGF21-induced preventive effect on CH. Additionally, FGF21 also prevented
  MI and DC by activation of Akt- and AMPK-mediated signaling pathway which were usually
  involved in maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis.
