caption: In the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, some intrinsic and extrinsic
  triggers cause activation of some kinases which led to hyper-phosphorylation of
  Tau protein. This Tau hyper-phosphorylation causes disability of microtubules, which
  consequently causes aggregation of tau protein (Tau fibril) and neuro-filaments.
  On the other way, some intrinsic and extrinsic triggers cause activation of secretase
  family enzymes which initiate degradation of Amyloid precursor protein and led to
  production and formation of amyloid-beta. Amyloid-beta, Tau fibril/neuro-filament
  causes degeneration neural cells which cause Alzheimer's disease or dementia. As
  mentioned in the text, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 causes inhibition of secretases
  family enzymes and kinases enzymes which can inhibit occurrences of Alzheimer's
  disease, dementia, or cognition impairment. According to some indirect evidence,
  it seems that infection with the COVID-19 virus can cause inhibition of the angiotensin-converting
  enzyme-2 signaling pathway, and it might be can have long-term neurological sequels
  such as activation of Alzheimer's or dementia triggers signaling pathway
