caption: Pathway for cerebral amyloid β (Aβ)-heme complex formation at sporadic Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD).An age-dependent excess Aβ formation and/or its disturbed cleavage
  result in the formation of fibrils and senile plaques. Yet Aβ also accumulates around
  small cerebral blood vessels and leads to their destruction. The peptide also readily
  crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in erythrocytes. A subsequent cerebral
  hemoglobin release may represent the main precondition for the formation of Aβ-heme
  complexes which, in the presence of H2O2, exhibit peroxidase activity. This enzymatic
  activity is known to contribute to several aspects of AD pathology, including neurotransmitter
  oxidation. Yet, e.g., its effect on plaque formation is still not known. Neuron-derived
  free heme and leukocyte-derived heme peroxidases may contribute to this pathway.
