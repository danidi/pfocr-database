caption: In hepatocytes, free fatty acids (FAs) obtained from the plasma or de novo
  synthesis are activated to form fatty acyl-CoAs by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases
  (ACSLs). At the mitochondria, Them2 selectively hydrolyzes plasma-derived long-chain
  acyl-CoA. Under fasting conditions, newly-formed FAs may be directed to mitochondrial
  ACSLs, which in turn traffic fatty acyl-CoAs towards the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway
  for diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1)-mediated triglyceride (TG) synthesis.
  Newly-formed TGs are then packaged into very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles
  and secreted into plasma. By this mechanism, Them2 sustains the export of triglycerides
  from the liver into plasma during fasting. In the setting of overnutrition (not
  shown) when the flux of FA from adipose tissue to the liver and rates of hepatic
  de novo lipogenesis are high, Them2-mediated increases in VLDL production rates
  may serve to mitigate, at least in part, the intrahepatic accumulation of excess
  TG. Relative magnitude of flux is represented by line thickness.
