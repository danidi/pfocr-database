caption: Targeting regulatory and/or effector T cells with ICOS agonistic or antagonistic
  antibodies. ICOS can be targeted by either agonist (in green) and antagonistic (in
  red) antibodies (Abs). ICOS agonists are usually administered in concomitance with
  anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 Abs, for their ability to synergistically inhibit the suppressive
  activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and to potentiate the antitumour activity
  of effector T cells (Teff), including CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations. One main mechanism
  of action of ICOS antagonistic Abs is to inhibit Tregs by stimulating the antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by natural killer (NK) cells. CTLA-4,
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Ag-4; PD-1, programmed cell death-1.
