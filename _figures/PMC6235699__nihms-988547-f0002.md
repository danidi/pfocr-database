caption: Although nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can be synthesized via
  numerous pathways, including de novo synthesis followed by the Preiss-Handler pathway,
  the pathway mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the dominant
  mammalian pathway and has been shown to be essential in numerous cell types. NAMPT
  catalyzes the formation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) from nicotinamide (NAM),
  which is then converted to NAD+ by NMN adenylyltransferases 1–3 (NMNAT1–3).
