caption: 'Schematic diagram of the postulated vanin-1 pathway in renal tubular epithelial
  cells in response to oxidative stress. This overview is based on the works of Dupre
  et al. [] and Pitari et al. []. An inciting drug (e.g., cisplatin) induces generation
  of free radical species. Although reactive oxidative stress (ROS) has a positive
  modulatory role, excessive ROS or inadequate capability of antioxidant scavengers
  leads to oxidative stress. In the presence of oxidative stress, antioxidant response-like
  elements within the promoter region of VNN1 act as stress-regulated targets and
  enhance VNN1 expression. More cysteamine is produced from hydrolysis of pantetheine;
  cysteamine is then converted to cystamine, which is an inhibitor of γ-glutamylcytein
  synthetase (γ-GCS), the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Consequently,
  GSH stores decrease and subsequently intensifies the oxidative stress, producing
  more inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. GPX: glutathione peroxidase; GR: glutathione
  reductase; GSSG: glutathione disulfide.'
