caption: Schematic view of TF functions extracellular and intracellular signaling.
  As initiator of extrinsic coagulation pathway, TF binds other coagulation factors
  leading to clot formation. As “cellular receptor” it activates several intracellular
  signaling potentially involved in atherosclerotic disease development and progression.
  Binding FVIIa, TF activates PAR family members, modulating several cell phenomena
  such as differentiation, survival, proliferation, migration as well as angiogenesis.
  TF, tissue factor; PAR, protease activated receptor.
