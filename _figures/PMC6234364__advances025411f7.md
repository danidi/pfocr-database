caption: Model for the procoagulant properties of platelet CD36/ERK5 signaling. In
  dyslipidemic conditions, circulating oxidized lipids present in oxLDL particles
  are recognized by platelet CD36. This promotes immediate recruitment of Src family
  kinases and generation of ROS by NADPH oxidase. Activation of MAPK ERK5 signaling
  by superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide promotes the apoptosome formation and
  caspase activity. The mechanisms of activating ERK5 by ROS are unclear. Caspases
  activate known scramblases present on the surface of the membrane and thus promote
  externalization of procoagulant phosphatidylserine. ERK5 also induces a signaling
  pathway that promotes integrin activation to enhance thrombosis. There is crosstalk
  between CD36 and GPVI downstream signaling, potentially through Src family kinases,
  ERK5, or calcium. This crosstalk enhances the externalization of phosphatidylserine
  through maladaptive apoptosome formation that is not common to the cyclophilin D/mPTP
  pathway induced by the strong agonists THR and CVX or the physiologic cell death
  pathway. Assembly of the prothrombinase and tenase complex to the anionic phospholipid
  enhances fibrin accumulation in vivo to support arterial thrombosis in dyslipidemic
  conditions.
