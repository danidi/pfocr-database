caption: The biosynthetic pathway of the anthocyanins. Scheme displaying the biosynthetic
  pathway of Cy-3-O-(sinapoyl)(sinapoyl)-diglucoside-5-O-glucosidein red cabbage.
  The biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanidins leads to the biosynthesis of cyanidin,
  which is further modified with several glycosyl and acyl moieties added in a species
  specific manner by glycosyltransferases and acyltransferases (indicated by dotted
  lines).
