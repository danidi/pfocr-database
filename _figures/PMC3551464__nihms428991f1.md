caption: 'A. During glial-guided of migration of CNS neurons in the developing mammalian
  brain neurons are polarized in the direction of migration (arrow). A leading process
  extends in the direction of migration, cytoplasmic organelles like the centrosome
  (blue circle) are often found where the leading process tapers into the neuronal
  cell body and the nucleus (grey oval) is located in rear the cell body. Similar
  to what is observed in other migrating cells, a gradient of adhesive contacts exist
  where neurons contact a migration substrate (glial fiber is shaded grey, adhesions
  are depicted in red): new adhesions are primarily located in the leading process,
  stable adhesions near the soma and adhesions are removed near the rear of the soma.
  B. Summary of recently reported signaling pathways that control adhesion receptor
  endocytosis: ASTN1 endocytosis is controlled by ASTN2 and dynamin in CGNs, Integrin
  receptor endocytosis occurs at the rear of migrating SVZa neurons via dynamin and
  N-Cadherin surface levels is regulated via endocytic recycling controlled by the
  Rab5, 7 and 11 GTPases. C. Summary of recently reported signaling pathways that
  control adhesion trafficking to the neuronal cell surface. JAM-C trafficking is
  facilitated by the Pard3A component of the PAR complex and is negatively regulated
  by the Siah E3 ubiquitin ligase. A RELN, Dab1 and Rap1A dependent pathway controls
  multipolar transition and final cortical plate positioning by regulating N-Cadherin.
  The precise mechanisms controlling receptor exocytosis are currently unclear.'
