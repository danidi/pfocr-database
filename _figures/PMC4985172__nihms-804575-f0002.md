caption: Intracellular signaling pathways of EET’s. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids exhibit
  both autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanism, and they are either directly released
  from the phospholipids stores or synthesized from the archidonic acids (AA) via
  a cytochrome P450 pathway. The actions of EET’s are mediated by various intracellular
  signaling pathways as shown in blue color bubbles, which get activated at specific
  conditions in different tissues. The activation of large-conductance Ca-activated
  K (BKCa) channels occurs through a Gαs protein coupled to the putative receptor
  or due to activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1. The cAMP-PKA,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathways produce response by activation of gene expression. Src and tyrosine kinase
  promote phosphorylation of specific proteins and promote various intracellular signalings
  such as mitognesis. The activation of PPRAαυ inhibits the NF-kappa B action via
  IKK, IκBα and also reduce the expression of the leukocyte adhesion proteins such
  as V-CAM, I-CAM and E-selectin. STAT3 tyrosine promotes phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation which inhibits IL-10-mediated inflammatory signaling and gene expression.
  Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is the protein encoded by HBEGF
  gene. AA – archidonic acid, EET’s – Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, sEH – soluble epoxide
  hydrolase, CYP2C – cytochrome p450 2C, CYP2J – cytochrome p450 2J, DHETs – dihydroxyeicosatrienoic
  acids, cPLA – phospholipase A.
