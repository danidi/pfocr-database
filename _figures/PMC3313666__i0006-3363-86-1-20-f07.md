caption: Outline of the mevalonate pathway. Conversion of acetoacetyl-coenzyme A to
  HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid is regulated by HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step
  of cholesterol synthesis. Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. FPP and
  GGPP are the intermediate downstream products of mevalonic acid. FPP is involved
  in farnesylation of proteins and is inhibited by FTI. GGPP is involved in geranylgeranylation
  of proteins and is inhibited by GGTI.
