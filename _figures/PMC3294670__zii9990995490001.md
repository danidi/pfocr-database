caption: Human type IA PI 3-kinase pathway components targeted in the RNAi-based screen.
  During infection with Listeria, host type IA PI 3-kinase is activated downstream
  of the Met receptor and plays a critical role in bacterial internalization (, ,
  ). Type IA PI 3-kinase uses PI(4,5)P2 as a substrate and produces the lipid second-messenger
  product PI(3,4,5)P3 (, ). PI(3,4)P2 is another second messenger, which is generated
  from PI(3,4,5)P3 by phosphatases (). The RNAi-based screen performed in this study
  targeted three categories of host genes encoding proteins that act on the type IA
  PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. Category I genes encode proteins that interact with
  the 85-kDa regulatory and/or 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. Category
  II genes code for proteins that bind to the PI 3-kinase lipid products PI(3,4,5)P3
  and/or PI(3,4)P2. Category III genes encode products that are indirectly controlled
  by type IA PI 3-kinase.
