caption: Expression profiles linked to the biosynthetic- and bioactivation pathway.
  The biosynthetic pathway involves the enzymes CYP79A1, CYP71E1 and UGT85B1 with
  the formation of dhurrin from L-tyrosine. The bioactivation pathway hydrolyzes dhurrin
  to release HCN via the enzymes DHR1 and 2 and HNL. The detoxification pathway converts
  the HCN to aspartate + NH3 and/or asparagine via CAS and the NIT4A/B1 and NIT4A/B2
  heterodimers. The expression profiles for the specific enzyme involved in the reactions
  in the biosynthetic- or bioactivation pathway are colored in the same color as the
  enzyme boxes. In the box representing the POR expression, the a, b and c represents
  the three different isoforms found in sorghum. Expression is displayed in fragments
  per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM). The dashed line in each transcription
  box represents the dhurrin concentration throughout development
