caption: Involvement of the endothelin, nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin pathways
  in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. (Left) In the endothelin
  pathway the effects of endothelin (ET)-1 are mediated via the ETA and ETB receptors
  in the smooth muscle cells. Receptor binding leads to mobilization of Ca2+ resulting
  in vasoconstriction and proliferation. Selective and dual endothelin receptor antagonists
  (ERAs) inhibit this pathway; (Middle) The nitric oxide pathway involves the production
  of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which leads to inhibition of Ca2+ entry,
  resulting in vasodilation and antiproliferation. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)
  stimulators and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE-5i) activate this pathway;
  (Right) In the prostacyclin (PGI2) pathway, prostanoid receptors IP, EP3, and TP
  regulate vessel tone (other prostanoid target receptors are not functionally expressed
  in the pulmonary artery). Selective non-prostanoid IP receptor agonists and PGI2
  analogues bind to the IP receptor, which induces adenylate cyclase activity, cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, resulting in decreased Ca2+ and leads
  to vasodilation and antiproliferation. Some PGI2 analogues also bind to EP3 receptor
  leading to a decrease in cAMP, which blocks vasodilation.
