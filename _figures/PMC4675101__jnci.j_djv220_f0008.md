caption: Molecular pathway underlying interaction of Zn deficiency and miR-31 overexpression
  in promoting esophageal preneoplasia. Zn deficiency induces miR-31 overexpression,
  leading to downregulation of its direct target Stk40. Stk40 downregulation activates
  NF-κB and Rage through S100a8/a9 dimer protein complex, thereby promoting inflammation
  and cellular proliferation to produce the preneoplastic esophageal phenotype.
