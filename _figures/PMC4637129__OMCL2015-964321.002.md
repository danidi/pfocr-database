caption: 'General scheme of glutamine (GLN) utilization in main metabolic pathways
  with details concerning ATP, NADH2, and NADPH2 production/utilization. PDHC6 catalyzing
  the reaction pyruvate→Acetyl-CoA is the only reaction that is able to reduce the
  total number of TCA molecules in the cell; thus, every GLN degradation pathway goes
  to pyruvate. Two pathways can be defined (see also ): (1) glutaminolysis (GLL):
  GLN→αKT→SC→malate→(to cytoplasm)→pyruvate and (2) reverse-TCA (R-TCA): GLN→citrate→(to
  cytoplasm)→oxaloacetate→malate→pyruvate. The balance of GLL pathway is +1 FADH2,
  +1 NADPH2, and +1 ATP (alternatively 0 ATP in the case of reaction 12). The balance
  of R-TCA pathway is −2 NADH2, −1 ATP, and +1 NADPH2. The alternative NAD(P)H2 from
  the reaction 21 is omitted. The conversion of Acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the fatty
  acid synthesis utilizes 1 additional ATP. Only one ATP molecule can be created directly
  during degradation of GLN in the GLL pathway (reaction 11). R-TCA utilizes rather
  ATP (for enzyme names, see enzyme abbreviation list).'
