caption: Microbiota mediates T-cell differentiation in homeostatic or pathogenic conditions.
  In mice under germ-free (GF) conditions, Bacteroides fragilis restores the development
  of the Th1-associated immune response through a bacterial product, polysaccharide
  A (PSA)-dependent pathway, while in mice under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions,
  PSA derived from B. fragilis induces Treg cell accumulation. Segmented filamentous
  bacteria (SFB) induces a Th17 immune response through adenosine 5′-triphosphate
  (ATP) production or serum amyloid A (SAA) produced by innate cells. Clostridium
  sp. promotes Treg cells through short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) activated by cognate bacterial antigens could facilitate the generation
  of tissue-specific T cells derived from systemic T cells in a specific tissue environment.
