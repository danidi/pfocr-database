caption: Autophagy and UPS alterations bridging altered proteostasis with neuroinflammation,
  the paradigm of protein glycation. Within neurons, glycation leads to the formation
  of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which structurally modify proteins while
  promoting the formation of oligomer species. These in turn may impair the UPS while
  engulfing the autophagy pathway. Thus, indigested AGE-modified proteins may be released
  extracellularly upon merging of autophagy compartments with the plasma membrane.
  In neighboring cells, including neurons and glia, the presence of RAGEs allows binding
  and entering of prionoids. While spreading prionoids in neighboring cells, the binding
  of AGEs with RAGEs triggers a variety of transduction mechanisms which bridge alterations
  in cell-clearing mechanisms with inflammatory events. In fact, the binding of AGEs
  with RAGEs triggers the activation of PKC, NF-kB, JAK2/STAT1 and mTOR pathways,
  which promote a vicious cycle of inflammatory reactions while leading to the replacement
  of standard UPS subunits with immune-related ones, called immunoproteasomes. Besides
  fostering the replacement of standard- with immune-proteasome subunits, these pathways
  may also impair the autophagy machinery. This may contribute to further promote
  the extracellular release of indigested AGE-modified proteins. At the same time,
  the immunoproteasome triggers a variety of inflammatory and immune reactions by
  cleaving misfolded proteins specifically within immunogenic sites. This leads to
  the production of Ag peptides that are recognized by MHC-I and MHC-II in neurons
  and glia, respectively. The cognate Ag/MHC-I complex exposed on the neuronal plasma
  membrane induces proliferation of CD8+ T-cells while triggering CTL-mediated neuronal
  death. At the same time, Ag-peptides derived from the degradation of misfolded proteins
  which are phagocytosed by or routed via RAGEs within glial cells can be presented
  via MHC-II molecules for re-activation of CD4+ T cells. In this context, the immunoproteasome
  may cross-process Ags which bind on MHC-II molecules to prime CD4+ Th lymphocytes
  and fuel production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain milieu. Cytokines,
  in turn, may further promote immunoproteasome induction within neurons through interferon
  receptors, leading to a vicious cycle of events bridging alterations in protein
  degradation with prion-like spreading and neuroinflammation.
