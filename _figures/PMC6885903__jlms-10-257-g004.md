caption: The constructed network included a main connected component and 9 isolated
  nodes (DEGs). The main connected component, namely the network contained 169 interacted
  genes (see ). The network was a scale-free network and therefore it was possible
  to introduce a limited number of genes that were important relative to the others.
  These crucial genes can be identified via the centrality analysis of the network.
  Based on the degree value, 10% of the top queried DEGs including STAT1, MX1, ISG15,
  OAS1, IFIT1, IRF8, and OASL were determined as hubs. Two DEGs, namely OAS2 and RSAD2
  which had a degree value near the last hubs, were also added to the hub nodes (see
  ). Similar to the hubs, the bottlenecks were identified based on betweenness centrality
  and are tabulated in . The connections between the hubs and the bottlenecks are
  shown in the illustrated sub-network in . The number of links and kinds of neighbors
  in this sub-network are different. Since gene ontology can provide useful information
  about the roles of the central nodes, the related biological terms were determined
  for the central genes. As it is shown in , except SAMSN1, the other hubs and bottlenecks
  were related to the relevant biological terms. The biological terms are shown in  and  in
  more details. The terms were extracted from KEGG, REACTOME_Pathways, GO_Cellular
  Component-EBI-UniProt-GOA, and GO_Biological PROCESS-EBI-UniProt-GOA (27.02.2019)
  via Clue GO v2.5.4.
