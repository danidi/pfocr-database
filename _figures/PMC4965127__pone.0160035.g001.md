caption: 'Fatty acid synthesis and degradation cycles have been depicted with blue
  and orange arrows, respectively. Regulatory proteins have been shown in dotted box
  in green and red color denoting activation and repression, respectively. Genes that
  have been overexpressed in this study have been denoted with green upward arrow,
  while genes that have been deleted are shown along with red cross. Abbreviations:
  TesAT—thioesterase of Anaerococcus tetradius; TesBT–thioesterase of Bacteroides
  thetaiotaomicron; TesBF—thioesterase of Bryantella formatexigens; Acc*—acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase of Corynebacterium glutamicum; FabD–malonyl CoA-ACP transacylase; FabH
  - β- ketoacyl-ACP synthase III; FabG - β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; FabA and FabZ -
  β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase; FabI—enoyl-ACP reductase; FabB - β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase
  I; FadD—fatty acyl-CoA synthetase; FadE—acyl CoA dehydrogenase; FabR–transcriptional
  repressor of FASII; FadR–transcriptional enhancer of FASII and repressor of β-oxidation.'
