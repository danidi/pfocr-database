caption: MAPKs in the DAMP perception in innate immune cells. DAMPs interact with
  multiple PRRs of innate immune cells and trigger the maturation of DC to mature
  APCs or the synthesis and release of Type I interferons (IFNs), cytokines, chemokines,
  and other pro-inflammatory compounds. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR2 or
  TLR4 are located on the outer membrane, sense class I DAMPs (such as HMGB1) and
  initiate a pathway dependent on MyD88 and other mediators that triggers cascades
  that depend on mitogen-activated protein kinases, MAPKs (among others) and activate
  NF-κB and other transcription factors (TF). Nucleic acids can also be sensed via
  TLRs 3,7,8,9, which are located on the endosomal membrane, and activate the same
  downstream pathways.
