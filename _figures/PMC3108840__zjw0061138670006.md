caption: Functional pathway analysis of glycoproteins overexpressed in PC3-N2. Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) was employed to functionally map the cell-surface glycoproteins
  overexpressed in PC3-N2 cells. The network shows the biological functions (Fx) that
  have been associated with these glycoproteins in the context of disease. “Apoptosis
  of tumor cell lines” is the top listed function, as determined by the number of
  overexpressed glycoproteins (highlighted in blue) associated with this activity.
  Individual proteins with known biochemical activities are highlighted with class-specific
  shapes (indicated in the legend).
