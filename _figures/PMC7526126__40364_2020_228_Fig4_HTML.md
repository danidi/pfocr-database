caption: 'Interferon-γ contributes to cancer immunotherapy efficacy. The efficacy
  of anti-PD-1-antibody and anti-CTLA4-antibody in cancer treatment may be improved
  or diminished by the presence of IFN-γ. Tumor progression: The downregulation of
  IFN-γ/IFNGR pathway may decrease the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. The IFN-γ
  drive expression of inhibitory ligands (IDILs) on tumor cells such as TNFRSF14,
  LGALS9, MHCII, CD86, IFIT1 and MX1 to dampen the immune response. Moreover, IFN-γ
  exerts apoptotic effects on immune effector tumor-infiltrating cells. Tumor regression:
  Increased expression of interferon signature genes (IFNG, CD274, LAG3, and CXCL9)
  or IFN-γ concentration in the TME is linked to better ICB efficacy. IFNGR-interferon
  gamma receptor; IDILs-interferon-driven inhibitory ligands; TILs-tumor infiltrating
