caption: Neutrophils promote tumour growth through direct and indirect mechanisms.
  Neutrophils can secret proteinases and inflammatory factors that directly promote
  the proliferation of tumour cells, such as neutrophil elastase (NE), prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β). Neutrophils can also suppress T-cell immunity
  to promote tumour growth. Neutrophils inhibit antitumour T-cell responses through
  cell contact-dependent and independent mechanisms. Neutrophils have previously been
  shown to produce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1 (ARG1) to
  inhibit T-cell function. Neutrophils have also been reported to recruit regulatory
  T cells (Treg) by releasing chemokine C-C motif ligand 17 (CCL17). Wang et al demonstrated
  that tumour-derived granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induced
  the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on neutrophils, which in turn
  diminished T-cell immunity via its interaction with PD-1 on T cells, ultimately
  leading to increased tumour growth.
