caption: The alternative pathway of the complement system. Activation of the complement
  system can be achieved via three pathways—the classical, lectin, and alternative
  pathways—depending on the trigger that is recognized. The proteolytic enzyme cascades
  of these three pathways converge at the central event of complement activation,
  which is the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b by C3 convertases. The classical and
  lectin pathways are activated using pattern recognition molecules that initiate
  formation of the C3 convertase C4bC2a. The alternative pathway is continuously activated
  at a low rate by a mechanism called “tick-over.” The spontaneous hydrolysis of C3
  generates the active C3(H2O) fragment which can form an initial fluid-phase C3 convertase
  upon association with factor B (FB) that is subsequently activated by factor D (FD)
  into Bb. Under normal conditions, this convertase generates small amounts of activated
  C3 fragments. C3a is released as an anaphylatoxin to mediate inflammation, for instance
  by attracting leucocytes. C3b is an opsonin; it binds to molecular or cellular target
  surfaces and marks them for phagocytosis. C3b can also act as a platform for formation
  of new C3 convertases which are effectively stabilized by properdin (P). The alternative
  pathway may also be initiated by properdin as this molecule recognizes target surfaces
  and subsequently recruits C3b and FB to form stabilized C3 convertases. Alternative
  pathway C3 convertases are important amplifiers of the complement reaction by converting
  many C3 molecules into C3b which in turn support new C3 convertase formation. Furthermore,
  C3b can attach to preformed C3 convertase complexes to form C5 convertases that
  convert C5 into C5a (an anaphylatoxin similar to C3a) and C5b to initiate terminal
  pathway activity. The C5b activation fragment recruits a series of other complement
  components, i.e., C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules, to form the membrane attack
  complex (MAC; C5b-9). This protein complex forms a pore that disrupts the membrane
  integrity and thereby can cause osmotic lysis of susceptible bacteria and cells.
  In sublytic amounts, MAC causes cell damage by activating still not well-understood
  (pro-inflammatory) signaling pathways
