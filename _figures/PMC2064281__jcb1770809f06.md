caption: 'Model of signaling cascades leading to D. discoideum chemotaxis. cAMP activates
  multiple pathways. The PI3K and PLA2 pathway are parallel mediators of chemotaxis:
  either one can mediate chemotaxis, and chemotaxis is blocked nearly completely when
  both pathways are inhibited. PIP3 is the likely mediator of the PI3K pathway, by
  recruiting PH-containing proteins modulating the actin cytoskeleton. The messenger
  of the PLA2 pathway controlling chemotaxis is unknown. The PI3K pathway appears
  to be controlled by the PLC pathway, presumably at the level of PIP2 degradation,
  leading to a reduction of membrane-associated PTEN that degrades PIP3. The PLA2
  pathway is dependent on cytosolic Ca2+, but it is unknown whether this occurs at
  the level of PLA2 activation or the action of downstream messengers on the chemotaxis
  system. Cytosolic Ca2+ is regulated by Ca2+ uptake from the medium (which is both
  G protein dependent and independent), free fatty acid (FFA)–mediated Ca2+ release
  from acidic stores, and the IP3 receptor–mediated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic
  reticulum.'
