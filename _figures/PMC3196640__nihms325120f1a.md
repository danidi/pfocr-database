caption: 'In conditions of low glucose uptake and flux through glycolysis (left),
  the glucose flux that passes through glycolysis and generates NADH is balanced by
  a mitochondrial shuttling mechanism. In conditions of high glucose uptake and flux
  (right), the capacity of the malate-aspartate shuttle to regenerate NAD+ can be
  saturated and lactate dehydrogenase activity is required to regenerate NAD+. A proposition
  is that this behavior can explain the Warburg effect. The thickness of the arrows
  represents relative magnitudes of flux at different points in the glycolytic pathway.
  (inset) The malate-aspartate shuttle: a series of oxidation-reduction reactions
  and anti-porter based trafficking of intermediate metabolites that begins with the
  oxidation of malate and end with reduction of aspartate in a series of six reactions.
  Directed arrows denote the conversion of substrate to product. The net result is
  a regeneration of NAD+ in the cytosol and production of NADH in the mitochondria.
  Abbreviations: MAL – malate, ASP – aspartate, αKG – alpha-ketoglutarate, OAA – oxaloacetate,
  and GLU – glutamate.'
