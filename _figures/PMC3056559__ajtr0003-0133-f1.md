caption: Schematic model of prolactin (Prl)-Prl receptor (PrlR)-Jak2-Stat5 signaling
  pathway. Prl binding induces PrlR dimer formation and subsequent phosphorylation
  of PrlR itself and receptor-associated Jak2. Cytoplasmic Stat5 proteins are recruited
  to the activated Prl-receptor-Jak2 complex through interaction of the SH2 domain
  of Stat5 with the phosphotyrosine peptide sequence of PrlR. Jak2 phosphorylates
  tyrosine residues Y694 and Y699 of Stat5a and Stat5b, respectively, leading to homo-
  or heterodimer formation of Stat5 via the mutual interaction of SH2 domain of one
  Stat5a with the phosphotyrosine residue of another Stat5a molecule. Phosphorylated
  Stat5 dimers translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where they bind to
  the consensus DNA sequences and regulate transcription of target genes, such as
  Bcl-xL and cyclin D1.
