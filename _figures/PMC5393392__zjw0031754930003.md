caption: Protein interactions during the flavivirus life cycle elucidated by MS-based
  proteomics. (A) Flavivirus particle composition. Flaviviridae particles are composed
  of a capsid/core (C) surrounded positive strand RNA genome and enveloped by a host
  derived lipid bilayer in which the viral transmembrane domain glycoproteins M/E1
  and E/E2 are embedded. Additionally, the virions may comprise of nonstructural proteins
  and host proteins. (B) Virus host protein interactions during entry. Flaviviridae
  members penetrate the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and fusion in endosomal
  compartments. MS-based proteomics discovered the listed interaction partners of
  viral glycoproteins as receptor candidates. SILAC-approaches further revealed secondary
  interactors of HCV through co-IP MS of the HCV receptor CD81 (listed as entry cofactors).
  (C) Virus host protein interactions during translation and replication. The Flaviviridae
  viral genomes translate and replicate in the cytosol in close association with ER
  membranes, which are remodeled during infection. MS-based proteomics identified
  heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) as host translation factor and prolactin regulatory
  element binding (PREB), HSP70, and GBF1 as host replication factors for the indicated
  viruses. Viral NS proteins forming the replication complex are depicted by a single
  blue symbol. (D) Virus host protein interactions during particle assembly and release.
  Particles are assembled at ER-derived membranes and exit the cell through the secretory
  pathway. MS-based proteomics revealed annexins, ESCRT components, and the GTPase
  Rab18 as host factors promoting particle assembly, ER budding, and maturation of
  the indicated Flaviviridae members. All panels show the assumed but not necessary
  experimentally confirmed localization of host factors identified by MS-based proteomics.
