caption: Interactions of KEGG pathways for differentially expressed genes in different
  stages of PAD. Pathways are enriched in intermediate lesions (A) and advanced lesions
  (B), respectively. Many genes involved in one pathway could also be involved in
  another pathway. A, B. Networking displayed the interaction of pathways in intermediate
  lesions and advanced lesions, respectively.
