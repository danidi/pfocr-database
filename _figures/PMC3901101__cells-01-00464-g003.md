caption: Autophagic-induced photodamage triggering cytotoxicity/cytoprotection in
  cancerous cells. In PDT, ROS generated by different PSs localizing in mitochondria,
  Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and lysosomes trigger autophagy as part of a death or
  survival pathway in relation to neoplastic cells apoptosis deficiency or competence
  respectively. Probably, photosensitization damages and/or inactivates anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins and/or causes their dissociation from pro-autophagic Beclin1
  protein, favoring the induction of autophagy. Moreover, PDT photodestroys proteins
  (Bax oligomers, Bax-associated PTPC (Permeability Transition Pore Complex), Bax
  monomer and Bax associated tBid, truncated Bid) forming pores on mitochondrial membranes,
  altering the correct solutes flux between mitochondria and cytoplasm, SERCA pump
  and IP3Rs in ER, inducing the loss of ER Ca2+ homeostasis. Finally, PSs localizing
  in lysosomes breakdown their membrane or inactivate the matrix proteases.
