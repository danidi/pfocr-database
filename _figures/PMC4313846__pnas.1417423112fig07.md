caption: Schematic model of regulation of STEP61 by parkin in PD. The E3 ligase parkin
  regulates STEP61 levels through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. STEP61 normally
  opposes the development of synaptic strengthening by Tyr dephosphorylation of substrates
  that include ERK. Genetic mutations and PD toxins result in impaired parkin function
  that leads to the accumulation of STEP61 and a disruption of ERK and CREB-mediated
  synaptic plasticity events.
