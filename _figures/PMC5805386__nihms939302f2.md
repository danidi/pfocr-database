caption: Pathway illustrating flow of radiolabel into AHL from methionine, via S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM). The radiolabeled carbon is indicated by asterisk. Bacteria convert some labeled
  methionine to SAM via the enzymatic action of MetK, a SAM synthetase. A portion
  of the 14C-SAM is used by a LuxI-type AHL synthase as substrate for AHL synthesis.
  The acyl-thioester carrier is either acyl carrier protein or coenzyme A, depending
  upon the LuxI enzyme. MTA is the co-product 5′-methylthioadenosine.
