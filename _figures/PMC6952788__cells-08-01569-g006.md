caption: Cartoon illustrating the role of RAC1B in negative regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) program in (pancreatic) epithelial cells. Upon exposure to EMT
  inducers such as TGF-β1, epithelial cells—characterized by high RAC1B and E-cadherin
  expression, and low SNAIL—activate MEK-ERK signaling leading to downregulation of
  epithelial marker genes such as CDH1 and concomitant upregulation of mesenchymal
  marker genes such as SNAI1. The resulting mesenchymal phenotype is characterized
  by low RAC1B and E-cadherin expression but high SNAIL expression, a spindle-shaped
  cellular morphology, and a motile phenotype. RAC1B blocks this transition by interfering
  with TGF-β1-induced activation of the ERK pathway and in particular ERK2. Green
  arrows indicate activation, while the red line indicates suppression. For details
  see text.
