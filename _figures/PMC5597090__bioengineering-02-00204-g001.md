caption: Schematic diagram of the phenylpropanoid/benzenoid biosynthetic pathway in
  plants. Phenylalanine, which is synthesized in the plastid through the shikimate
  and aromatic amino acids biosynthetic pathways, is the precursor for both volatile
  (right hand side) and non-volatile (left hand side) specialized metabolites. The
  chemical structure of representative volatile compounds that contribute to the aroma
  and flavor of flowers and fruits is shown. Dashed arrows represent several enzymatic
  steps.
