caption: 'Fatty- acids, glucose and ketone bodies are internalized through surface
  receptors and can be metabolized into acetyl-CoA through β-oxidation, glycolysis
  or ketolysis, respectively. In the mitochondria, acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid
  cycle (TCA) and generates energy in the form of ATP, through the electron transport
  chain (ETC) during oxidative phosphorylation. Acetyl-CoA also acts as a precursor
  for production of the anti-inflammatory ketone body, BHB. Alternatively, fatty-acids
  can enter the non-oxidative pathway to generate lipid byproducts by providing fatty-acid
  (FA)-CoA as a precursor for ceramides and downstream sphingolipids, or for the synthesis
  of diacylglycerides (DAG) to generate triglycerides (TAG) and lipid mediators such
  as arachidonic, eicosapentaeinoic or docosahexaenoic acid. Nlrp3 activation requires
  two signals; signal 1 is TLR stimulation that triggers transcription of pro-IL1β
  for caspase-1 cleavage. Signal 2 is a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
  such as uric acid or ceramide which causes inflammasome aggregation. Increases in
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phagocytosis with lysosomal disruption are known
  to mediate the activation of Nlrp3. Inflammasome aggregation causes the release
  of active IL-1β, which drives sterile inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.
