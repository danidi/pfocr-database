caption: 'Effects on IDO activity on immune responses. IDO is expressed by various
  cells of the immune system in response to activation by inflammatory markers such
  as IFNs, ILs, TNFs, PGs and LPS. By decreasing the amount of available Trp IDO activates
  the GCN2 stress-kinase pathway leading to T cell anergy and cell cycle arrest, inhibits
  the mTOR pathway thus diminishing T cell proliferation. By increasing KP metabolite
  concentrations IDO also contributes to the apoptosis of effector T cells and promotes
  the formation of T cells of the regulatory subtype. Via these mechanisms IDO might
  exert profound effects on both systemic and local immune responses. Abbreviations:
  IFNs: interferons; Ils: interleukins; TNFs: tumor necrosis factors; PGs: prostaglandines;
  LPS: lipopolysaccharide; DC: dendritic cell; IDO: indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; Trp:
  tryptophan; KP: kynurenine pathway; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin.'
