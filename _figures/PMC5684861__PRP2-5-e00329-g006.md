caption: Mechanisms of bile acid homeostasis. Activation of FXR by CDCA or OCA results
  in increased expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and fibroblast growth
  factor 19 (FGF‐19), genes that suppress Cholesterol 7α‐hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the
  rate‐limiting enzyme in the de novo bile acid synthesis pathway. FXR also directly
  regulates bile acids via induction of the bile acid salt export pump (BSEP), which
  effluxes bile acids from hepatocytes to bile and heterodimer organic solute transporters,
  OST α and OST β, which transport bile acids form hepatocytes to blood circulation.
