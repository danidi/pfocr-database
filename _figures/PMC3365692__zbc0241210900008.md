caption: Aβ1–42-activated cellular signaling pathways and AMY3 role in AD. AMY3 is
  a multimeric complex formed by CTR and RAMP3 (see also a). Direct activation of
  AMY3 with hAmylin and Aβ1–42 results in Gαs-mediated adenylate cyclase (AC) stimulation,
  with subsequent increase in cellular cAMP, stimulation of PKA R2, downstream activation
  of ERK1/2, and an increase transcription factor cFos expression. The observed cytosolic
  Ca2+ rise could be due to Gαq activation. Akt is also activated followed cAMP and
  PKA activation. The cytosolic Ca2+ changes could also contribute to Akt activation.
  Long term AMY3 activation could trigger an ERK1/2 pathway that may cause Ca2+ imbalance
  and perturb homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to cell death.
