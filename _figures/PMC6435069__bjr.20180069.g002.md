caption: Schematic representation of complement regulators. Effects of the complement
  system are controlled by membrane-bound and soluble regulators. Complement regulators
  either inhibit proteases or accelerate the decay of certain complement components.
  C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) inhibits the serine proteases that cleave C4 and C2. C4 binding
  protein (C4BP) accelerates the decay of the classical pathway C3 convertase. Membrane
  cofactor protein (MCP) and CR1 are cofactors for Factor I, which degrades C3b and
  C4b fragments. Factor H degrades alternative pathway convertases. DAF and CR1 also
  accelerate decay of C3 convertases. Protectin and vitronectin prevent assembly of
  the MAC and the carboxypeptidases N, B and R degrade C3a and C5a to their less potent
  forms.,  MAC, membrane attack complex.
