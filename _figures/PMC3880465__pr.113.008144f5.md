caption: Kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism in response to inflammation.
  Tryptophan is metabolized intracellularly by IDO and TDO to produce kynurenine.
  In response to inflammation, there is an increase in the metabolism of kynurenine
  down the kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) pathways, which results in increased production
  of quinolinic acid, which agonizes NMDA receptors (NMDA-R). 3-HK, 3-hydroxy kynurenine;
  KATs, kynurenine aminotransferases.
