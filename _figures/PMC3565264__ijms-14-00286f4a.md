caption: 'DNA Damage/Cell Cycle Reagent HeLa –/+ UV Results. (A) Quantitative data
  from replicate runs was mapped onto the pathway diagram from . Green proteins denote
  peptides that increased at least 2.5-fold with UV damage, red proteins denote decreases
  of at least 2.5-fold. The red box highlights stress-responsive MAP kinase proteins,
  and the blue box highlights core DNA damage checkpoint proteins; (B) Selected peptides
  derived from p38 MAPK and JNK are shown in detail with modification/cleavage site
  number, peptide sequence, fold change (UV: Control), maximum intensity and whether
  the measurement was height (H) or area (A). Green cells represent peptides that
  increased with UV damage at least 2.5-fold. Total and phospho-specific antibodies
  are available for protein names and sites shown in blue text, respectively; (C)
  Western blotting of the same samples used for the PTMScan Direct analysis with total
  and phospho-specific p38 and JNK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Rab11 is
  included as a total protein control; (D) Selected peptides derived from the checkpoint
  proteins ATM, ATR, Chk1 and Chk2 are shown as in part B. “–” in the site column
  indicates an unmodified peptide; (E) Western blotting of the same samples used for
  the PTMScan Direct analysis with total and phospho-specific ATM and ATR antibodies
  (Cell Signaling Technology).'
