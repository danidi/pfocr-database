caption: 'switching the aldosterone response of the kidney to be antinatriuretic (left)
  or kaliuretic (right). Green arrow heads (activating pathways), red blunt end (inhibitory
  pathway). Left panel shows the pathway in the setting of low Na+ diet when Ang II
  and SGK-1 signaling leads to phosphorylation of WNK4. This stimulates phosphorylation
  of SPAK, which, in turn, phosphorylates NCC, activating Na+ transport to enhance
  conservation of Na+ in hypovolemia. Stimulation of unknown receptors are suspected
  to cause phosphorylation of L-WNK1 which can also stimulate SPAK phosphorylation.
  L-WNK1 has other functions: a) It blocks the NCC-inhibitory form of WNK4. b) It
  inhibits secretion of K+ via ROMK channels so as to, conserve K+ despite high aldosterone
  levels. Right panel shows the pathway in the setting of high dietary K+ intake,
  when aldosterone is stimulated and angiotensin is low. In the absence of sufficient
  AngII, ATR1 can not activate WNK4. This reduces SPAK activation and NCC phosphorylation.
  At the same time, dietary potassium loading increases the KS-WNK1 isoform to suppress
  the activity of L-WNK1. Consequently, the full inhibitory power of WNK4 on NCC becomes
  unleashed, blocking traffic of NCC to the apical membrane and thereby reducing NCC
  surface density. KS-WNK1 also blocks the effect of L-WNK1 on ROMK endocytosis, causing
  ROMK to increase at the apical membrane. In this way, K+ secretion in the DCT and
  CNT/CCD is maximized while NCC is suppressed. Aldosterone stimulation of ENaC (not
  shown) offsets the decreased Na+ reabsorption by NCC, allowing robust potassium
  secretion without changes in sodium balance. (Not shown for clarity are WNK3, which
  is believed to antagonize the inhibitory effects of WNK4 on NCC; and the possible
  WNK4 effects on ROMK).'
