caption: Schematic representation of major calcium channels, pumps, exchangers and
  sensors in mammalian cells. Ca2+ influx is mediated by plasma membrane channels
  including transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, voltage-gated calcium channels
  (VGCC), ligand-gated ionotropic P2X receptors, mechanosensitive Piezo channels,
  and store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway mediated by stromal interaction molecule 1
  (STIM1) sensor and ORAI1 channels. Distribution of Ca2+ against a chemical gradient
  across cell compartments is regulated by Ca2+ pumps including the plasma membrane
  Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), and
  Golgi network secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase (SPCA). The endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) Ca2+ channels include ryanodine receptor (RYR) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) receptor (IP3R); the latter is activated by IP3 ligand produced by the plasma
  membrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) via Gaq and phospholipase C-β (PLCβ)
  proteins. Two-pore channels (TPC) regulate Ca2+ release from the endolysosomal system.
  Mitochondrial Ca2+ levels are controlled by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)
  complex, and mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX).
