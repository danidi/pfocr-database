caption: Mdfi overexpression promoted C2C12 cell differentiation and positively modulated
  fast-to-slow-twitch muscle fibers transformation. We constructed a Mdfi-overexpressing
  C2C12 cell line by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. During C2C12 myogenic development, Mdfi
  promotes the differentiation of C2C12 cells by upregulating the expression of Myod,
  Myog, and Myosin. Mdfi positively modulated fast-to-slow-twitch muscle fibers transformation
  by upregulating the mRNA levels of Myod, Camk2b, and its downstream genes, such
  as Pgc1a, Pdk4, Cs, Cox4, Acadm, Acox1, Cycs, and Atp5a1. In addition, the calcium
  signaling pathway was the most significant in C2C12 cells with Mdfi-OE. We also
  systematically established regulatory networks and identified hub genes in them.
  Their regulation mechanism in Mdfi regulation of C2C12 cell differentiation and
  the muscle fiber type transformation warrants further investigations.
