caption: 'Biochemical relationships between the CDP-choline pathway of PtdCho synthesis,
  the degradation of PtdCho, and general phospholipid metabolism in mammals. Choline
  uptake is mediated by the organic cation transporters (OCTs) which rely on facilitated
  diffusion governed by the choline concentration gradient and the electrical potential
  across the membrane. Active transport of choline is mediated by the choline transporter-like
  proteins (CTLs) that are energized by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. The
  high-affinity choline transporters (CHTs) are Na+-dependent and require ATP hydrolysis.
  Intracellular choline can be acted upon by three different enzymes: the choline
  dehydrogenase (CHDH), choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and choline kinase (CK). CHDH
  is localized inside the mitochondria and oxidizes choline to betaine aldehyde, with
  oxygen being the final electron acceptor. The betaine aldehyde is oxidized to betaine
  by the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) in concert with the conversion of oxidized
  nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD+) into the reduced nicotinamide adenine nucleotide
  (NADH). Choline acetylation is catalyzed by the choline acetyltransferase (CAT)
  that transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) to choline, yielding
  free coenzyme A (CoA) and acetylcholine. CK catalyzes the esterification of the
  choline hydroxyl group with the γ-phosphate of the ATP to produce phosphocholine
  (P-choline) plus adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase
  (CCT) uses cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to convert P-choline into CDP-choline, with
  the release of pyrophosphate (PPi). The CDP-choline is esterified with diacylglycerol
  (DAG) by the cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) or the choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase
  (CEPT) to produce 1,2-diacyl-glycerophosphocholine (PtdCho) and cytidine monophosphate
  (CMP). The Legionella pneumophila-encoded AnkX(Lp) can hijack CDP-choline to esterify
  a serine hydroxyl group of Rab1 protein. PtdCho can be hydrolyzed into choline and
  phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) by phospholipase D (PLD); in turn, PtdOH can be hydrolyzed
  into DAG and Pi. PtdCho can also be hydrolyzed into DAG and P-choline by phospholipase
  C (PLC). Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) hydrolyzes the two acyl chains (FA) of
  PtdCho to yield glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho), which can then be further hydrolyzed
  into glycerophosphate (GroP) and choline by the glycerophosphodiesterase (GPD).
  Phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PSS1) catalyzes a base-exchange reaction with PtdCho
  substituting the choline group with serine (Ser) to produce phosphatidylserine (PtdSer).
  The sphingomyeline synthase (SMS) substitutes DAG for ceramide (Cer) to yield sphingomyelin
  (Sph). Sph can be hydrolyzed into P-choline and Cer by sphingomyelinase (SMase).
  Phospholipases A (PLA) can degrade PtdCho to yield lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PtdCho)
  and further hydrolysis of lyso-PtdCho yields GroPCho. The free hydroxyl group in
  lyso-PtdCho can be esterified by the acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT)
  using acylCoA as the donor of the acyl-group to yield PtdCho.'
