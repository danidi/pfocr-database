caption: Directed cell migration. (A) Dictysotelium chemotaxis. Ras is activated in
  response to a gradient of cAMP interacting with a surface GPCR. The receptor and
  associated G protein, as well as Ras, remain evenly distributed around the cell,
  but active, GTP-bound Ras is localized specifically in the direction of the gradient.
  Ras activates PI3 kinase to produce PIP3, which leads not only to the recruitment
  of proteins involved in modifying the actin cytoskeleton, such as SCAR/WAVE and
  Rac, but also a Ras GEF, which could potentially generate a positive feedback loop.
  PTEN localizes at the sides and rear of the cell to spatially restrict the distribution
  of PIP3 within the plasma membrane. Two other second messenger systems have important
  roles in directional sensing, PLA2 and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which produce
  arachidonic acid metabolites (AA) and cGMP, respectively. Contractile actomyosin
  forces at the sides and rear together with actin-driven protrusions at the front
  drive migration. (B) Neutrophil chemotaxis. An extracellular gradient of the bacterial-derived
  peptide fMLP, interacting with a GPCR (FMP2), leads to activation of an associated
  Gi and PI3 kinase. The PIP3 produced recruits DOCK2 to activate Rac, which can activate
  PI3 kinase and set up a positive feedback loop. Sustained recruitment of DOCK2 also
  requires localized generation of phosphatidic acid (PA) through activation of PLD.
  Another G protein, G12/13, activates Rho and ROCK at the rear of the cell to promote
  actomyosin contractility. The lipid phosphatase SHIP1 is required to maintain spatially
  localized PIP3. (C) Collective migration in vitro. After scratching a monolayer
  of primary embryo-derived fibroblasts, cells migrate into the free space collectively
  as a sheet. Cell–cell contacts (N-cadherin) are maintained during migration. Cdc42
  is activated at the leading edge of front row cells and, via PAK kinase, serves
  to localize Rac activity such that actin polymerization and protrusive activity
  are restricted to the front of the migrating cell. Through another effector, the
  Par6–aPKC complex, Cdc42 causes the microtubule cytoskeleton to reorganize such
  that the centrosome and Golgi face the direction of migration. Par6–aPKC leads to
  the inhibition of GSK-3 specifically at the front of the cell, through a pathway
  that involves Wnt5a and Disheveled (data not shown), and causes the tumour suppressor
  protein APC to associate with and stabilize the plus ends of neighbouring microtubules.
  (D) Collective migration in vivo. Border cells (yellow) in the Drosophila ovary
  delaminate from the follicular epithelium (brown) and migrate as a group through
  nurse cells (white/grey) towards the oocyte. PVR and EGFR receptors in the border
  cells recognize a gradient of extracellular cues (PVF1 and Spitz) from the oocyte,
  and activate Rac through the Rac GEF, Mbc, to induce forward facing protrusion in
  cells at the front of the group. Cell–cell interactions (through E-cadherin) are
  required to be maintained throughout migration, though cells continuously reorganize
  within the group.
