caption: Two distinct DC semi-maturation pathways induce different types of regulatory
  T cells. Immature tissue-resident DCs or in vitro generated BM-DCs that are triggered
  through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway or proinflammatory cytokines become semi-mature
  DC with migratory potential to T cell areas. Upon induction of IL-10 production
  by the DCs as observed via intranasal antigen application Tr1 cell generation from
  naive T cells is favored. Alternatively, repetitive injections of IL-10-deficient
  semi-mature DC also lead to Tr1 cell generation. Different, only incompletely understood
  maturation pathways activate tissue-resident DC into RelB/p52+ semi-mature DCs homing
  to the T cell areas of peripheral lymph nodes. Transport of soluble and cell-associated
  antigens have been observed for ssmDCs. By using TGF-β and retinoic acid naive T
  cells are converted into Foxp3+ Tregs by ssmDCs.
