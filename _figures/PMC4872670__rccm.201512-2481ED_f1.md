caption: Under physiological conditions, Hb compartmentalization into red cells creates
  a number of biophysical and biochemical barriers (cell-free zone, intrinsic membrane
  barrier, and unstirred layer) that slow down dioxygenation reactions between Hb
  and endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO). These barriers are disrupted by hemolysis,
  with the released Hb (tetramers and dimers) in the intra- and extravascular space
  rapidly oxidizing NO to nitrate, leading to inhibition of NO signaling. This pathway
  has been demonstrated in various pathologic situations, including hemolytic and
  critically ill diseases and toxicity associated with cell-free Hb therapeutics and
  transfusion with stored red cells. Schaer and colleagues show that haptoglobin prevents
  free Hb-dependent increases in blood pressure via binding to Hb dimers and sequestering
  these complexes in the vascular lumen (i.e., preventing diffusion of Hb into the
  vessel wall) and suggest the potential for therapeutics that prevent Hb extravasation
  (). EC = endothelial cell; NOS = nitric oxide synthase; OxyHb = oxygenated hemoglobin.
