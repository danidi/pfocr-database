caption: Representation of metabolic pathways of two lactate shuttles within the central
  nervous system. (1) The astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS; green pathway) operates
  under normal physiological conditions with astrocytes responding to glutamatergic
  activation by increasing their rate of glucose utilization and release of lactate
  in the extracellular space, making the lactate available for neurons to sustain
  their energy demands. (2) The astrocyte–microglia lactate shuttle (AMLS; red pathway)
  proposed for tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Astrocytes respond to signaling from
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected microglia by increasing glucose mobilization,
  leading to increased extracellular lactate, reflected in increased cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) lactate levels. Lactate used by microglia as an additional energy source
  for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production aimed at destroying the invading Mtb.
