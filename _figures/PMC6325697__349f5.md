caption: Pervasive feedback regulation of insulin-like signaling. daf-2/InsR antagonizes
  daf-16/FoxO via the PI3K pathway (). daf-16 activates expression of three pathway
  components to produce negative feedback, and it represses expression of two components
  to produce positive feedback. daf-16 also represses its own expression, producing
  negative feedback, and it represses expression of skn-1/Nrf (not depicted). daf-16
  represses expression of eight putative insulin-like peptide agonists of daf-2 and
  activates five putative antagonists, producing positive feedback in each case. daf-16
  also activates six putative agonists and represses four putative antagonists, producing
  negative feedback. Food activates expression of agonists and represses expression
  of antagonists (by definition with corroboration from functional analysis; ), independent
  of daf-16 and insulin-like signaling. Nutrient availability also affects daf-2 expression
  independent of insulin-like signaling activity (not depicted). Dashed arrows reflect
  putative function of insulin-like peptides as agonists or antagonists of daf-2,
  reflecting cell-nonautonomous effects of daf-16 and nutrient availability. Inferred
  positive feedback is depicted in green and negative feedback in red. Numbers next
  to colored arrows indicate the number of genes represented by each arrow.
