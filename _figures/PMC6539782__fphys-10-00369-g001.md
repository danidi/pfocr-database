caption: 'Carbohydrate and protein metabolisms. Red: lncRNAs; green: proteins; blue:
  transcriptor factors; brown: nuclear receptors. PPARγ promoter binds directly Ftx
  increasing the transcription. PPARγ is phosphorylated through AMPK pathway and it
  enhances the transcription of leptin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), glucose channel
  4 (GLUT4) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). In turn, AMPK activity is
  enhanced by the binding to NBR2. H19 influences the transcription of pyruvate kinase
  M2 probably by the inhibition of PKM2 miRNAs, however, more studies are necessary
  to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is blocked
  by Gas5 which interacts to GR DNA binding domain resulting in an inhibition of 6-phosphoglucanase
  (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PFKFB2). LINC00092 stabilizes phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-phosphatase
  2 (PFKFB2) mRNA allowing its synthesis. LINC00116 encodes the microprotein mitoregulin
  (Mtln) which acts into mitochondrial inner membrane increasing the formation of
  supercomplexes, calcium intake and reducing ROS formation. The alteration of LINC00116
  generate dysfunctional of low levels of Mtln. As-SLC7A11 binds SLC7A11 mRNA inhibiting
  the translation of cysteine/glutamine transporter, meanwhile plasmacytoma variant
  translocation 1 (PVT1) enhance the synthesis of AA transporter through the binding
  of miR-126 which is a suppressor of SCL7A5 mRNA.'
