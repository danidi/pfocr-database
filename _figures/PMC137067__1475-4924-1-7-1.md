caption: The Hedgehog signaling pathway. (a) In the absence of Hedgehog ligands, Patched
  protein inhibits the activity of Smoothened, which resembles G-protein-coupled receptors.
  (b) On activation by a ligand of the Hedgehog family, the inhibition of Smoothened
  by Patched is relieved and Smoothened is freed to trigger an intracellular signaling
  cascade; this ultimately leads to transcriptional regulation by transcription factors
  of the Gli family.
