caption: S-glutathionylation in the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. This diagram outlines
  the sequential steps involved in ubiquitination/proteasome-mediated protein degradation.
  S-glutathionylation steps for E1, E2, and proteasome (-SSG) have been indicated.
  This redox-regulated post-translational modification leading to inhibition of protein
  degradation could differentially influence cancer development and cancer prevention,
  depending on the function of the substrate protein in specific signaling pathways.
