caption: Proposed IL-1β-induced promatrilysin expression signaling model. IL-1β-induced
  promatrilysin expression is mediated by synthesis of IL-6 through a NFκB-dependent
  pathway. In this model, IL-1β ligand binding to its receptor initiates the signaling
  cascade that results in degradation of IκB allowing nuclear translocation of the
  active NFκB heterodimer. Once in the nucleus, NFκB binds cis elements and induces
  transcription of IL-6 and other downstream effectors, which, in turn, result in
  transcription of the matrilysin gene. IL-6-mediated promatrilysin expression may
  be mediated through both autocrine and paracrine pathways depending on whether the
  IL-6 binds to the IL-6 receptor on the cell from which it was secreted or binds
  the IL-6 receptor on a neighboring cell that could be of a different type. STAT3
  is activated in response to IL-6, and dominant negative STAT3 inhibits IL-6-mediated
  promatrilysin expression to baseline levels, which strongly indicates that STAT3
  is involved in transcriptional regulation of IL-1β- and IL-6-induced promatrilysin
  expression.
