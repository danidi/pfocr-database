caption: Model for Subolesin/Akirin function in immune response pathways. A simplified
  annotation of the downstream components of the arthropod IMD and mammalian TNF/TLR
  pathways (; ; ; ; ). (A) After activation of the arthropod IMD pathway, the TGF-β
  (TAK1), Tak1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and the I-KB kinase (IKK) complex are recruited,
  which leads to phosphorylation of the NF-κB transcription factor, Relish. After
  phosphorylation, the N-terminal domain of Relish (N-Rel) is cleaved by Caspase-8
  homolog Dredd or a similar Caspase and is translocated to the nucleus. Subolesin/Akirin
  may be post-translationally modified and translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  N-Rel interacts with Subolesin/Akirin through unknown proteins to drive the production
  of anti-microbial peptides and other effector genes. In ticks, N-Rel and Subolesin
  may be reciprocally regulated. (B) In mammals, the activation of the TNF/TLR signaling
  pathways also results in the recruitment of the TAB2-TAK1 and IKK complexes, which
  results in the phosphorylation of the inhibitory regulator of NF-kB, IkB, resulting
  in the NF-kB translocation to the nucleus. As in arthropods, Akirin2 may be post-translationally
  modified and translocated to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, NF-kB interacts with
  Akirin2 through unknown proteins for the activation of gene expression. In both
  arthropods and mammals, Subolesin/Akirin are involved in the regulation of genes
  that are Relish/NF-kB independent.
