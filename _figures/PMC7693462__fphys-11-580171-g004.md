caption: Hypothesized role of NAA in cancer cells as an alternative source of acetyl-CoA
  for specific transcription factor acetylation in place of citrate. We propose that
  some transcription factors use the NAT8L-ASPA-ACSS2 pathway (“NAA pathway”) preferentially
  over the citrate-ACLY pathway. Activation of the hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha
  (HIF-2α) transcription factor during hypoxia is shown as an example. Citrate synthesis
  is reduced due to the Warburg effect (possibly by direct NAA inhibition of ACLY)
  and NAA can act as an alternative acetyl-CoA source by the sequential actions of
  ASPA and ACSS2 (orange pathway). Both ASPA and ACSS2 have been shown to shuttle
  between the cytoplasm and nucleus. This general mechanism could be involved in a
  number of transcription factor signaling pathways. For example, transcription factor
  EB (TFEB), which controls autophagy, is responsive to NAA. See figure and text for
  additional details. ACLY, ATP citrate lyase; ACSS2, acyl-CoA short chain synthetase
