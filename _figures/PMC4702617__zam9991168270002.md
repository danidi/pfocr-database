caption: Effects of deletion of the RIM15 gene on the metabolic profile of a laboratory
  strain during alcoholic fermentation. The metabolic profiling data (number of picomoles
  per 107 cells; except for UDPG and T6P, the data for which are represented by the
  relative peak area per 107 cells) for glucose metabolites in BY4743 wild-type (green
  bars) and rim15Δ (orange bars) cells were mapped onto known pathways, including
  glycolysis and alcoholic fermentation (gray arrows), the pentose phosphate pathway
  (blue arrows), glycerol biosynthesis (purple arrows), and the UDPG and carbohydrate
  anabolic pathway (pink arrows). Cells were cultured in YPD medium containing 20%
  glucose at 30°C, and metabolites were extracted when the fermentation rate was maximized
  (1 day after inoculation) and analyzed by CE-TOFMS. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P,
