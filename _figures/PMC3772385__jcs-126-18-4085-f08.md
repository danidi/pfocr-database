caption: Model describing the relationship of osteoblast-produced Bmp2 and connections
  to VegfA production and increased microvascularization that serves as a major niche
  for mesenchymal stem cells. Bmp2 from osteoblasts (Bmp2ob) in an autocrine or cell
  autonomous manner stimulates osteoblasts to differentiate, produce VegfAob and increase
  Bmp2ob protein. VegfAob in combination with Angiopoietin 1 stimulates new stable
  microvascular structures with associated vascular MSCs. Bmp2ob stimulates Bmp2 expression
  (Bmp2msc) in a paracrine manner in the associated MSCs leading them to differentiate
  into mature osteoblasts. Endothelial cells could be a source for Bmp2 expression
  induced by Bmp2 and other BMPs in the bone marrow environment and that increased
  BMP signaling in endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors could contribute
  in a physiological manner to new MSCs through mechanisms similar to that observed
  in heterotopic ossification pathologies (). Primarily, we propose that Bmp2ob stimulates
  endogenous Bmp2msc, which collectively drives the MSC to osteoblast differentiation
  pathway in an intracrine or unconventional secretory mechanism (USM) pathway. VegfA
  contributes to this lineage commitment of the MSCs into mature osteoblasts ().
