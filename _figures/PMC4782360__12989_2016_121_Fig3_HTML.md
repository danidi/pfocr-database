caption: Pathway analysis illustrating the link between PM2.5-associated miRNAs in
  extracellular vesicles and biological pathways related to cardiovascular disease.
  Selected miRNAs (in red) associated with long-term ambient PM2.5 levels and their
  experimentally validated mRNA targets (in green) as identified by the Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software. The biological pathways involved in cardiovascular disease
  (CVD) for all miRNA-mRNA interactions are also shown here. Solid lines represent
  a direct interaction and dotted lines represent an indirect interaction
