caption: Schematic diagram of the four shRNAs designed to target the Ugcg gene in
  mESCs. (A) Biosynthetic pathway of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids and
  gangliosides. Glucosylceramide synthase is the enzyme in the biosynthetic first
  step for the synthesis of most gangliosides and glycosphingolipids. (B) shRNAs vector.
  Four shRNAs (cloned 1-4) designed to inhibit expression of the mouse Ugcg gene (UDP-glucose
  ceramide glucosyltransferase; GenBank. Accession No. NM_011673, SuperArray Bioscience
  Corp., Frederick, MD).
