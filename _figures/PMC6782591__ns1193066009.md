caption: 'Signal transduction pathways operating in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
  This schematic diagram, which places components postsynaptically for the convenience
  of presentation, diagrams several of the signal transduction pathways documented
  as operating in hippocampal area CA1. Although a static diagram is presented, it
  should be kept in mind that the effects that are described can be divided into two
  broad temporal categories: (1) short-term effects caused by second messenger-dependent
  protein kinase activation and (2) longer-term effects caused by the generation of
  persistently activated second messenger-independent forms of PKC and CaMKII, such
  as occurs in LTP. Although all of the ultimate effectors of these various pathways
  are not known, nor have the genes downstream of CREB been identified, several candidate
  categories are documented, e.g., glutamate receptors, K+ channels, and cell surface
  molecules. As indicated, multiple receptor subtypes are coupled to a variety of
  downstream kinases, and the kinase cascades may interact extensively with each other.
  In many cases the interactions may serve as a signal amplification mechanism, as
  multiple upstream regulators converge on final common effectors such as MAPK and
  CREB. The convergence on final common effectors has an interesting implication:
  the capacity of multiple cascades to elicit the activation of the same downstream
  effectors may provide strong stimuli with a fail-safe mechanism wherein the failure
  of one pathway may be compensated for by the functionally redundant pathway. Finally,
  signal amplification may not be limited to the simultaneous activation of two pathways.
  Because termination of kinase activation is not instantaneous, temporally spaced
  stimuli may serve to amplify each other, allowing for temporal integration. A/K,
  AMPA/KA receptors; CaM, calmodulin; DAR, dopamine receptor D1/D5; βAR, β-adrenergic
