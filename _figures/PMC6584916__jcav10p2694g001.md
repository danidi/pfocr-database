caption: 'Structure of the Slit/Robo protein family and their interaction. (A). Structure
  of the human Slit protein. Slits consist of five regions as follows: one N-terminal
  signal peptide, four leucine-rich domains (LRR, D1-D4) in tandem with disulfide
  bonds, six epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domains, an Agrin-Perlecan-Laminin-Slit
  (ALPS)/Laminin-G-like domain, three epidermal growth factor-likedomains, and a C-terminal
  cysteine-rich knot. Slits are proteolytically cleaved between EGF-like domains.
  (B). Structure of the human Robo protein. The extracellular domains of the Robo1-3
  proteins have the same structures, including 5 immunoglobulin domains, 3 fibronectin
  domains and one transmembrane domain. The Robo4 extracellular domain has only 2
  immunoglobulin domains, 2 fiber connexin domains and one transmembrane region; the
  Robo1 and Robo2 intracellular region contains four conserved proline-rich domains,
  referred to as CC0-CC3. The Robo3 intracellular domain contains CC0, CC2 and CC3,
  and Robo4 only contains CC0 and CC2.'
