caption: A schematic model of the regulation of the ASK1/P38 signal pathway by Trx-1.
  (a) The Trx-1 system contains NADPH, TrxR-1, and Trx-1. The oxidized Trx-1 (inactive
  form) is transformed to the active and reduced form of Trx-1 by receiving electrons
  from NADPH coenzyme in the presence of TrxR-1. Prxs reduce H2O2 to H2O using electrons
  from the active Trx-1. The active Trx-1 also regulates redox signals by reducing
  many other target proteins with disulfide bonds. ASK1 constantly forms an inactive
  complex with reduced Trx-1 under normoxic conditions. (b) Exposure of BMSCs to hyperoxia
  leads to elevated ROS and H2O2 production, which leads to oxidative stress. However,
  oxidized Trx-1 is dissociated from ASK1 in response to oxidative stress and subsequent
  activation of ASK1. Activated ASK1 in turn activates the p38 pathway and induces
  various cellular responses, including cell apoptosis and differentiation inhibition.
  Trx-1 overexpression promoted BMSC survival under hyperoxic conditions through elevation
  of antioxidant activities, reduction of ROS and H2O2 generation, and subsequent
  inhibition of the ASK1/P38 signaling pathway.
