caption: (A) After synthesis Notch receptors are cleaved by a Furin-like convertase
  in the trans-Golgi (S1 cleavage) to produce heterodimeric receptors containing an
  intra- and extracellular domain. Notch receptors are exocytosed to the cell surface
  of the signal-receiving cell where Notch signaling is initiated upon binding to
  Notch ligands belonging to the Delta or Jagged family expressed on neighboring signal-sending
  cells. Steady state levels of non-ligand bound Notch receptors are controlled by
  E3 ligases and several proteins such as Numb and α-Adaptin that control Notch turnover
  by recycling or lysosomal degradation. Notch ligand-receptor binding enables proteolytic
  cleavage of the Notch extracellular domain by ADAM10/TACE metalloprotease (S2 cleavage)
  that remains bound to its ligand and is further subjected to lysosomal degradation
  in the signal-sending cell. The remnant receptor is then cleaved by the γ-secretase
  complex within its transmembrane domain at site 3 (S3 cleavage) to allow release
  and nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) where it associates
  with RBP-Jκ, a DNA-binding adaptor protein mediating the corpus of canonical Notch
  signals. In the absence of NICD, RBP-Jκ forms a co-repressor complex (red) with
  many proteins including histone deacetylases (HDACs) and SHARP. NICD binding to
  RBP-Jκ enables displacement of the co-repressor complex and binding of the adaptor
  protein Mastermind-like (MAML) that recruits other proteins to form a co-activator
  complex (green) resulting in the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.(B)
  Some effects of Notch signaling were found to be independent from canonical ligands
  and/or from RBP-Jκ-mediated transcription that may or may not require cleavage of
  Notch (‘non-canonical’ Notch signaling). Furthermore, at virtually all stages of
  the Notch signaling cascade, interactions of components of multiple other signaling
  pathways are found that may influence Notch turnover, non-nuclear signaling, or
  modulate RBP-Jκ-dependent or –independent transcriptional pathway activity (, ).
  The best-characterized ligand/RBP-Jκ-independent Notch pathway involves the regulation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathway have long been known
  to interact in multiple and even opposing ways. In a very simplified view, the synergistic
  interactions between Notch and Wnt/β-catenin depend on RBP-Jκ-mediated canonical
  signaling, whereas the antagonistic effects are mediated by ligand/RBP-Jκ-independent
  Notch signaling. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this non-canonical
  mechanism, including binding and degradation of activated β-catenin by plasma membrane-bound
  Notch involving interaction with proteins such as Numb, Numb-like, and α-Adaptin.
