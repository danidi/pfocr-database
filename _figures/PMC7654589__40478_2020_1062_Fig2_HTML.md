caption: The canonical PINK1/PARKIN pathway. a and b In healthy mitochondria, PINK1
  is constitutively imported via translocase of the outer membrane (TOM)/translocase
  of the inner membrane (TIM)23 complexes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM),
  cleaved by two proteases (mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and presenilin-associated
  rhomboid-like (PARL)) and retro-translocated to the cytosol. Cleaved PINK1 is then
  degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. While Parkin remains inactive in the
  cytosol. (a and c) PINK1 is also present at the mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) interface, where it interacts with the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein
  degradation (ERAD) machinery. At the ER, PINK1 degradation by the proteasome is
  controlled by the ERAD E3 ubiquitin ligases HRD1 and gp78 and by the ERAD-associated
  proteins VCP, UFD1, andUFD2A
