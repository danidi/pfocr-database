caption: Schematic model of receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL)
  and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) signalling during osteoclastogenesis and inflammation
  induced bone loss. X, a pathway other than IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB that is activated
  by RANKL binding to RANK and is essential for production of functional osteoclasts.
  IKKα function in RANK signalling is dispensable. TNFR1, TNF receptor 1.
