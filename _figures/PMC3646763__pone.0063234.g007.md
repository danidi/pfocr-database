caption: CNBP regulatory genetic relationships were obtained using Biotapestry software
  from data achieved in this work (*) as well as previous data from our group  and
  others , . Blue lines indicate upstream while red lines indicate downstream CNBP
  genetic relationships. Black lines indicate other genetic relationships relevant
  to the CNBP pathway. Arrows indicate positive regulation while break lines indicate
  negative regulation.
