caption: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and possible involvement
  of rare diseases in the pathway. Stimulants such as insulin-like growth factor bind
  to tyrosine kinase receptors, which leads to the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) []. A cascade of subsequent phosphorylation events results in the
  activation of protein kinase B (AKT), which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits
  the TSC1/TSC2 complex, a negative regulator of mTOR that is directed against the
  positive regulator Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb). As a result, inhibition
  of the TSC1/TSC2 complex results in the activation of mTOR [–]. NF1-encoded neurofibromin
  and NF2-encoded Merlin proteins also act as negative regulators of the mTOR pathway.
  Neurofibromin functions as a Ras-GTPase activating protein that inhibits the actions
  of Ras on PI3K [], while Merlin acts directly on mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) []. Sirolimus
  and everolimus both bind to and form complexes with FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12),
  resulting in the inhibition of mTORC1 activity []. While mechanisms are complex
  and not fully clear in Leigh and Down syndrome, evidence has shown a relationship
  between mTOR activity and ATP (Leigh syndrome), and decreased autophagy with increased
  protein production and oxidation with mTOR hyperactivation (Down syndrome) [, ,
