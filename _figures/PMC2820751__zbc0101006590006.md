caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of insulin resistance. In unstressed cells,
  insulin triggers the activation of PI3-kinase, which in turn activates Akt2 and
  mediates GLUT4 translocation to the PM. In cells that are made resistant with chronic
  exposure to insulin or dexamethasone, the readdition of acute insulin induces PI3-kinase
  activation. We propose that PI3-kinase activates an inhibitory pathway that is normally
  silenced in unstressed conditions to inhibit signaling downstream of Akt and GLUT4
  translocation to the PM.
