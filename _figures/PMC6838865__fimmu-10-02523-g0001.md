caption: 'Overview of canonical and non-canonical mammalian autophagy processes. In
  response to reduced nutrient availability, the AMPK protein is activated, leading
  to the repression of mTOR. The ULK1-ATG13-FIP200-ATG101 complex is then activated,
  which triggers the autophagic pathway. Macroautophagy can be divided into a series
  of coordinated and consecutive events. In the first stage, denominated nucleation,
  proteins are recruited to form the phagophore, a double-membraned structure. The
  main proteins involved in this early stage of autophagosome formation are VPS34,
  Beclin-1, Atg14, and p150. The expansion/elongation of the phagophore occurs concurrently
  with the nucleation process. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are involved
  in the expansion of the phagophore: the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 and LC3 systems. Lastly,
  autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to became autophagolysosomes, in which acid hydrolases
  degrade the sequestered materials and released the degraded products into the cytoplasm.
  In xenophagy, intracellular pathogens are ubiquitinated and recognized by autophagic
  adapters (e.g., OPTN, NDP52, p62, TAX1BP1). These adapters then deliver pathogens
  to autophagosomes by directly binding with LC3-II. As in macroautophagy, the autophagosomes
  fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. Pattern recognition receptors (e.g.,
  TLRs, Fc receptors, and CLEC7A/dectin-1) can trigger LAP. In this process, Rubicon
  associates with the PI3K class 3 complex, formed by VPS34, VPS15, UVRAG (UV radiation
  resistance-associated gene), and Beclin-1, resulting in the stabilization of NOX2.
  Subsequently, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by NOX2, leading to LC3
  recruitment to single-membrane vacuoles. Finally, the LAPosome fuses with lysosomes.
  In microautophagy, cytoplasmic components are directly engulfed by the lysosomal
  membrane. In chaperone-mediated autophagy, chaperones recognize soluble proteins
  with pentapeptide motifs (KFERQ) and deliver them to lysosomes for degradation.'
