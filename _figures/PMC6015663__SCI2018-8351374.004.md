caption: SHP2 plays a key role in NSC proliferation, differentiation, and migration.
  During NSC proliferation, several essential signaling branches, such as FGF/FGFR
  and VEGF/VEGFR, transmit the signal to adaptor proteins, for example, Grb2, and
  subsequently activate SHP2 as well as ERK pathway. Cell cycle-associated genes are
  considered as the target genes, for example, Bmi-1 is responsible for SHP2-mediated
  NSC proliferation. Besides, for NSC differentiation, it seems like SHP2 either regulates
  neurogenesis via ERK signaling or promotes astrogliogenesis through STAT3 signaling.
  On the other hand, SDF1/CXCR4 is responsible for migration of NSCs and their progenitors.
