caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia. Amyloid-β (Aβ) interacts with different
  receptors present on microglia. Impaired triggering receptor expressed in myeloid
  cells 2 (TREM2) leads to impaired mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.
  Impaired mTOR pathway increases autophagy and decreases population of mitochondria
  which further decrease the production of ATP. Aβ interaction with P2X7 activates
  NF-κB and leads to activation of NLRP3 and release of cytochrome c (cytc) from mitochondria
  (mechanism not clear) and apoptosis. Aβ gets phagocytosed through different receptors
  such as TREM2, toll-like receptors (TLRs), receptor for advanced glycosylation end
  products (RAGE), and CD36, and internalized Aβ interacts with mitochondrial calcium
  uniporter (MCU) on mitochondria leading to cell cytotoxicity. Through unknown receptors
  (?), Aβ decreases mitophagy and also increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
  All these mechanisms contribute to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathogenesis through
  inflammation or other mechanisms which are still under investigation.
