caption: Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates bile acid (BA) synthesis in a tissue-specific
  manner. In the intestine, FXR activation induces fibroblast growth factor (FGF)15/19,
  which can go to the liver and activate the FGFR4/β-klotho dimer to activate signaling
  pathways in order to inhibit the expression of genes in the classical BA synthesis
  pathway. Hepatic FXR activation also inhibits BA synthesis, albeit to a smaller
  degree.
