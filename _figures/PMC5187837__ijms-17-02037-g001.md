caption: 'Schematic representation of the integrin outside-in signaling. Through the

  increases, leading to the formation actin stress fibers and stimulates actomyosin
  contractility via its downstream effector Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) [];
  (2) Integrin mediated FAK activation triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase

  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase/AKR
  mouse thymoma kinase (PIP3K/AKT) pathway cross-talk with the Hippo pathway via Yes-associated
  protein (YAP). YAP is a transcription factor that can induce for example expression
  of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and Bcl-xL []. (Of note, there are a plethora
  of cross-talks between all these pathways that are not discussed here for simplication
  purposes). Arrows: interaction with another protein or promotion of a specific cell
