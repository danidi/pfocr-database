caption: Simplified scheme of the p53 pathway and regulation by HDM2. HDM2 keeps p53
  expression levels low, however, upon cellular stress, HDM2 can be regulated by complexing
  with p14ARF, removing HDM2 mediated inhibition of p53. Moreover, kinases can coordinate
  the p53 response to stressors by inducing post-translational modifications that
  result in methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination
  of p53 occasioning in stability and transcriptional activation of this protein,
  maintaining genome integrity.
