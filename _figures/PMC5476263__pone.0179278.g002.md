caption: DSBs are recognised by the MRN complex (i.) which binds to the blunt DNA
  ends, holding them in close proximity. The exonuclease activity of MRE11A (or EXO1
  in concert with BLM) is able to resect blunt ends, creating a 3’ ssDNA overhang,
  which becomes coated by the single-strand binding protein RPA (ii.), signalling
  for cell-cycle checkpoint arrest via ATR. RPA is displaced by RAD51 (iii.) to allow
  for HR. Alternatively, the MRN complex can be replaced by KU78/KU80 complex (iv.),
  protecting DNA ends from resection and promoting NHEJ through the binding of the
  DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). DSBs formed as a consequence of replication
  fork collapse require HR for their repair. Fork stalling, following replication
  stress for example, activates the FA pathway in an attempt to stabilise and protect
  the fork (v.). The FA core complex recognises the stalled fork and ubiquitinates
  the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer. Stalled forks can be further processed by structure
  selective endonucleases to restore the replication fork (vi.) or cleave the fork
  to produce a DSB (vii.). Alternatively, the post-replication machinery can bypass
  damaged bases at stalled forks. One such pathway leads to template switching in
  a HR-mediated pathway.
