caption: (1) AhR pathway activation alters expression of both the uPA protease and
  PAI-1/2. TCDD induces expression of PAI-1 in mouse hepatoma cells and in the rat
  ovary (,). PAI-2 expression is enhanced by AhR-ligands in human breast epithelial
  cells, endometrial cells, lymphocytes, as well as in HEPG2, U937 monocytic and SCC-13
  keratinocyte cell lines (–). (2) Expression of both uPA and tPA (tissue plasminogen
  activator) are increased by TCDD exposure in a rat model of ovulation (). (3) Several
  MMPs are targets of the AhR pathway, including MMP-1 in normal human keratinocytes
  and A2058 melanoma cells(,), MMP-2 and -9 in A2058 melanoma cells (), MMP-2, -9and
  -13 in the murine fetal heart (,) as well as in the regenerating zebrafish tailfin
  (). TCDD exposure also induced MMP-1, 3 and 13 in U937 macrophages and correlated
  with increased cell migration (), and in human endometrial cells (), and MMP-9 expression
  is induced in prostate cancer cells (). Further, in AhR−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts,
  MMP-2 activity is reduced (). (4) AhR regulates TGF-β levels as demonstrated in
  AhR−/− MEF where the total TGF-β levels were elevated resulting in decrease proliferation
  and increased apoptosis respectively. It has been recently determined that LTBP-1
  (latent TGF-β binding protein) mediates the increase in TGF-β1 in AhR−/− MEF cells
  and is also responsible for activity of two proteases involved in TGF-β release,
  plasmin and elastase. Reduction in LTBP-1 increases the MMP-2 protease. (5) Two
  cathespins are down regulated in response to AhR activation. Cathespin B expression
  is reduced by TCDD in porcine thyrocytes (). Both TCDD exposure and a constitutively
  active AhR inhibits estrogen-induced cathespin D expression in MCF-7 cells.(,).
