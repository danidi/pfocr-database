caption: Posited mechanistic frameworks implicating dietary carbohydrates and cancer
  risk. Simple and complex carbohydrates have different mechanisms that induce variable
  signaling pathways, which may affect cancer risk. Simple carbohydrates may increase
  risk by activating the insulin-IGF-1 axis and by employing aerobic glycolysis as
  the primary energy-harvesting pathway (known as the Warburg effect). On the contrary,
  complex carbohydrates may reduce the risk by disrupting the insulin/IGF-1 axis,
  quenching bioavailable androgenic and estrogenic factors, increasing fecal excretion
  of carcinogens, and modulating the gastrointestinal microbiota. Black arrows indicate
  the stimulation of a pathway, dotted lines indicate the inhibition of a pathway,
  and broken lines indicate a negative feedback
