caption: 'The C. parvum nucleotide biosynthetic pathway is a phylogenetic mosaic.
  Enzymes labeled in red show strong phylogenetic association with eubacteria, those
  in green show association with plants and algae. Metabolic reconstruction and phylogenetic
  analyses presented here are based on the C. parvum type 2 IOWA genome [analysis
  of the type 1 data set () yielded identical results]. Supporting comparative genomic
  analyses are provided in . Two arrows indicate two or more enzymatic steps. Most
  nucleoside mono- and diphosphate kinase and phosphorylase steps have been omitted
  for simplicity. A complete set of these genes is present in the genome. The membrane
  topology of the feeder organelle () has been schematized. *, Transporter: the localization
  of nucleoside transporters is hypothetical, a localization outside the feeder organelle
  is equally possible. 1, adenosine transporter; 2, AK; 3, adenosine monophosphate
