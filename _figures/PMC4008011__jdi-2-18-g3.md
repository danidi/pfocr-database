caption: 'Tissue‐specific regulation of polyol pathway and its metabolic cascade to
  diabetic neuropathy. Major regulating enzymes of the polyol pathway are differentially
  expressed in the epineurial artery and endoneurial tissues. Aldose reductase (AR)
  is strongly expressed in both the endoneurium and the wall of the epineurial artery,
  whereas expression of sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) is equivocal in the endoneurium,
  but clearly positive for the wall of the epineurial artery (see , with kind permission
  from Springer Science + Business Media: Virchows Arch, Vol. 439, 2001, page 48.
  Enhanced in situ expression of aldose reductase in peripheral nerve and renal glomeruli
  in diabetic patients; Kasajima H, Yamagishi SI, Sugai S, Yagihashi N, Yagihashi
  S, ). Hence, hyperglycemia in nerve tissues exerts conversion from glucose to sorbitol
  by AR, thereby causing the depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) and nitric oxide
  (NO) consequent from the overconsumption of nicotinamide adenine di‐nucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH). Concurrently, intracellular myo‐inositol is depleted to cause phosphatidylinositol
  (PI) depletion, which further suppresses diacylglycerol (DAG) production and finally
  protein kinase C (PKC) activity. As a consequence, Na,K‐ATPase activity will be
  reduced to result in functional and structural changes of neuropathy. In contrast,
  the second portion of the polyol pathway regulated by SDH is activated in the vascular
  wall in the hyperglycemic condition. As a result of redox changes of NAD/NADH, conversion
  from glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate (Glycer‐3P) to phosphatidic acid will be promoted.
  Then enhanced synthesis of DAG results in increased PKC activity. In our studies,
  major isoforms that underwent changes in the diabetic condition are PKCα in the
  nerve and PKCβ in the epineurial artery ().'
