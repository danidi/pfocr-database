caption: 'Anabolic and catabolic routes of ceramide metabolism. Ceramide, shown in
  blue, the aliphatic backbone of sphingolipids, can be converted to sphingomyelin,
  ceramide 1-phosphate, and glucosylceramide. Ceramide, a tumor suppressor, induces
  apoptosis. Glycosylation (conversion to GC) is a prominent metabolic pathway in
  multidrug resistant cancer cells; glycosylation as well leads to ceramide resistance.
  If ceramide is hydrolyzed by ceramidase, sphingosine and free fatty acid are generated.
  The sphingosine can be metabolized to sphingosine 1-phosphate, a mitogenic entity,
  by sphingosine kinase. Various points in ceramide metabolism can be activated or
  inhibited, providing a useful strategy for studying ceramide-related events. GC,
  glucosylceramide. Note: arrows to designate several of the back-reactions are not
  included in this figure; for example, beta-glucocerebrosidase, also known as D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine
  glucohydrolase, which catalyzes cleavage by hydrolysis of the beta-glucosidic linkiage
  of glucosylceramide.'
