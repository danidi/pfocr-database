caption: Under stress conditions, GR pathway is activated, response to stress hormone
  and induces MTOC amplification and chromosomal instability. It would be one of putative
  tumorigenic mechanism for stress-induced cancer. However, unlike ER- α pathway,
  GR is not regulated by VHL. Since Rare ginsenoside, CSH1 possesses steroid-like
  backbone, it blocks GR as well as ER-α pathway-induced MTOC amplification and Taxol
  sensitivity. So, it would be used as anti-cancer drugs as well as cancer prevention
  strategy.
