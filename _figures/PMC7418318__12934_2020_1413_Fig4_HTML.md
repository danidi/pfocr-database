caption: Impact of environmental and genetic perturbation on the spectrum of short-chain
  CoA thioesters and free coenzyme A in different microbes. The data show direct correlations
  in absolute CoA thioester levels between different strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum
  (a, b), Streptomyces albus (c, d), and Pseudomonas putida (e, f), and between glucose
  and glycerol grown Yarrowia lipolytica (g, h). The analysis comprised C. glutamicum
  LYS-9 and its succinyl-CoA synthetase deletion mutant LYS-9 ∆sucCD, which achieved
  a higher l-lysine yield, due to flux coupling of the l-lysine pathway with the disrupted
  TCA cycle (a, b) []. In comparison to the wild type S. albus J1074, the recombinant
  producer J1074/R2 formed the polyketide pamamycin from CoA thioester building blocks
  malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, ethylmalonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA (c,
  d) []. In addition, the data comprise Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and its glucose
  dehydrogenase deficient mutant KT2440 ∆gcd (e, f) [], and Yarrowia lipolytica Po1h::Af4
  using glucose and glycerol as sole carbon source (g, h) []. The statistical significance
  for observed differences in CoA thioester levels (t-test p < 0.05) is marked by
  an asterisk. n = 3
