caption: ATR is activated in response to single-stranded DNA generated by replication
  stress (stalled replication forks) or resected DSBs. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
  is coated by the tripartite replication protein A (RPA) complex, which recruits
  the ATR regulator ATRIP. ssDNA-RPA also recruits the Rad17/RFC complex to the replication
  fork, which loads the 9-1-1 complex (RAD9-HUS1-RAD1). Rad9 then interacts with TopBP1,
  which plays a critical role in activating ATR. Claspin recruitment to the complex
  allows ATR to phosphorylate Chk1 (p) and other downstream effectors, which mediate
  cell cycle arrest to allow for DNA damage repair.
