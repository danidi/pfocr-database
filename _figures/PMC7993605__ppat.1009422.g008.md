caption: During infection with Lgy parasites, the NRF2 pathway is activated independently
  of LRV1 by the production of oxidative species by NOX2. NOX2 activation triggers
  PKCδ phosphorylation by SFK resulting in the release of NRF2 from its negative regulator
  KEAP1. Stabilized NRF2 translocates to the nucleus favoring the antioxidant response.
  Concomitantly, stabilized NRF2 blocks the induced pro-inflammatory response activated
  by LRV1. Thus, NRF2 activation results in activation of the antioxidant response
  and restriction of the pro-inflammatory response in Lgy infection.
