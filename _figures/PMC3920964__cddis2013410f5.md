caption: CyPA promotes neurodegeneration. ApoE2 and ApoE3 secreted by astrocytes,
  but not ApoE4, stimulates the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
  (LRP1) on pericytes. This event suppresses the pro-inflammatory pathway orchestrated
  by CyPA that leads to NF-kB and MMP-9 activation. As a consequence, the MMP-9-mediated
  degradation of tight junction and basement membrane proteins that causes BBB breakdown
  and neuronal dysfunction is inhibited
