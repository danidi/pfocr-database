caption: Targets and structure of compstatin. (A) Simplified schematic representation
  of the human complement system showing initiation via the classical (CP), lectin
  (LP) or alternative (AP) pathway, amplification via C3/C3b and effector functions.
  C3 convertase complexes are underlined in blue. Complement inhibition by compstatin
  analogs is indicated by cross marks, and binding targets are highlighted in red.
  (B) Binding site of compstatin in the co-crystal structure with C3c (right; PDB
  2QKI) and schematic view of the cyclic peptide sequence of compstatin analog Cp20.
  The traditional numbering scheme is shown in blue, and positions changed in this
  study (Xaa0, Xaa1) are indicated in red. (C) Peptide sequences of previous lead
  compounds, which are used as standards and references in this study. Residues that
  have been improved between each optimization cycle are marked in red. Analog 4(1MeW)
  has also been designated as POT-4 and AL-78898A in ongoing clinical trials.
