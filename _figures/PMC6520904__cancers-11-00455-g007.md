caption: The proposed model of CXCR7-EGFR crosstalk and its effect on the MAPK signaling
  pathway. EGFR-ERK and CXCR7-ERK signaling pathways promote tumor cell development
  (left). Ablation of EGFR leads to overexpression of CXCR7/CXCL12 and subsequently
  stimulates the ERK pathway, resulting in tumor cell survival (middle). Dual inhibition
  of EGFR and CXCR7 further suppresses ERK signaling and synergistically inhibits
  tumor growth (right). Thickness of the arrow shows strength of the signaling. The
  number of solid dots (in red or green) shows the amount of the endogenous epidermal
  growth factor (EGF) or CXCL12.
