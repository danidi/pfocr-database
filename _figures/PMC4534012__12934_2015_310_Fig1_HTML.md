caption: Correlation biosynthetic pathway of l-Arg and possible signaling cascade
  involved in the regulation of ODHC specific activity under Tween 40 addition by
  C. crenatum (Brief). Red thick arrows indicate increased fluxes by overexpressing
  the corresponding genes. Dot-dashed lines represent decreased or cut off fluxes
  by reducing relevant enzyme activity and knocking out relevant genes, respectively.
