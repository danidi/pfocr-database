caption: 'The suppression of the RNA silencing machinery of plants by pathogen-encoded
  RNA Silencing Suppressors: (a) The known effectors that affect host RNA silencing
  in P. syringae. AvrPto inhibits the association of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-associated
  receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) and FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2), which results in the
  stabilization of pre-miRNAs and reduces miRNA abundance []. HopT1-1 interferes directly
  with the RNA silencing machinery by inhibiting the function of AGO1 []. Nucleotide-binding
  site-leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRRs), TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1) and
  COP1-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) are known targets of miRNAs that are affected
  by RNA silencing suppressors of P. syringae. (b) The known RNA silencing suppressors
  of Phytophthora sp. PSR1, a P. sojae-specific RNA silencing suppressor, interacts
  with PIP1. PIP1 is required for the correct assembly of the Dicing-bodies, which
  are the protein complexes that include DCL1. The destabilization of the Dicing-body
  results in reduced miRNA accumulation. PSR2 is conserved in several Phytophthora
  species. [,]. It binds and inhibits DRB4. DRB4 acts in the phasiRNA pathway, and
  PSR2 specifically reduces phasiRNAs that are secreted—likely via extracellular vesicles.
  These phasiRNAs have a target in Phytophthora and targeting impacts the virulence
  and sporulation of the pathogen []. (c) The function of the recently identified
  RNA silencing suppressor of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt). PgtSR1 (SR1)
  negatively regulates siRNA biosynthesis and affects miRNA biogenesis. The miRNAs
  that were affected had targets that are associated with plant defense signalling,
  including several defense-associated transcription factors [].'
