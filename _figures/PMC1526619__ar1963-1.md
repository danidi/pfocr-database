caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In resting cells, glycogen synthase kinase
  3 (GSK3β) is in a complex with CK1, β-catenin, axin and adenomatous polyposis coli
  protein. In this state, β-catenin is primed for phosphorylation by GSK3β. The phosphorylated
  β-catenin is degraded by ubiquitination. In the activated state (upon Wnt binding
  to Fz), Wnt-Fz and LDL receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP) coordinate Dvl (disheveled,
  an adaptor protein) activation, which results in recruitment of axin to the plasma
  membrane. This leads to dissociation and inactivation of GSK3β, which can no longer
  phosphorylate β-catenin. Free β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and induces
  gene expression in a complex with LEF-1/T cell factor (TCF) family transcription
  factors, down regulating E-cadherin genes and initiating epithelial mesenchymal
  transition. (Adapted from [8].)
