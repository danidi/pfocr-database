caption: This figure represents a simplified model of the interferon-β signaling pathway.
  (A) Shows this pathway represented using the mEPN scheme and parameterised ready
  to run a simulation, (B) when imported into BioLayout Express3D and visualised using
  the mEPN 3D notation scheme, (C) as exported from BioLayout as an SBGN-ML file and
  loaded in the Vanted software, and (D) the same set of interactions represented
  as a Petri net, illustrating the similarity to mEPN diagrams.
