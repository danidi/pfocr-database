caption: '(A) The chemotaxis pathway in R. sphaeroides as currently understood, including
  the forward chemotaxis pathway previously proposed . MCP: transmembrane methyl accepting
  chemotaxis protein, Tlp: cytoplasmic methyl accepting chemotaxis protein, A: CheA
  histidine protein kinase, W: CheW a linker protein between receptors and CheA, Y:
  the response regulator CheY, B: the response regulator CheB, R: the methyltransferase
  CheR. P indicates a phosphoryl group. The number in subscript denotes one of the
  multiple homologues in R. sphaeroides. The flagella motor is shown at the right
  of the figure. (B) The possible de-methylation feedback structures for the phosphorylated
  proteins CheB1-P and CheB2-P in R. sphaeroides. Each possible connection is denoted
  by a (red) thick solid, dashed or dotted line. Possible models involve combinations
  of these four lines. Interactions from the phosphotransfer network are shown in
  (black) thin dashed arrows, receptor activation/de-activation is denoted by (black)
  thin solid lines.'
