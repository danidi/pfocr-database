caption: 'Transcriptional changes of genes involved in fatty acid catabolism, MVA
  formation, and energy metabolism by ΔYPL062W, whose reactions mainly occur in the
  peroxisome (A), cytoplasm (B), and mitochondrion (C), respectively. The key metabolites
  in each pathway are marked in bold. Transcriptional data are boxed next to each
  gene. Strain names are abbreviated as follows: C, SyBE_Sc14C10, and Δ, ΔYPL062W
  strain SyBE_Sc14C02. Strains were cultured under both 2% (mass/vol) (2% G) and 4%
  (mass/vol) (4% G) glucose conditions. The time reading after the “@” symbol in the
  legend indicates the sampling time within the glucose consumption phase (i.e., 4 h)
  or the ethanol consumption phase (i.e., 12 h). The relative transcription level
  for each gene is indicated as Δ/C, which is the ratio of the transcription level
  in the ΔYPL062W to that in the control strain. Genes that are significantly upregulated
  and downregulated and genes without significant transcriptional differences are
  colored red, blue, and gray, respectively.'
