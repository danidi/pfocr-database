caption: This illustrates the PANSS total computer-based model that was based upon
  the neuroarchitecture and neurophysiology of the ventral striatum for a direct pathway
  medium spiny neuron (MSN), whose activation is driven by afferent projections from
  the cortex (further modulated by the D2 receptor), and background gating signals
  from hippocampus and amygdala and modulated by dopamine afferents from the ventral
  tegmental area through the D1 receptor. We combine this model with a similar model
  for the indirect pathway where postsynaptic D2 receptors modulate the excitability
  of the MSN. Serotonergic and noradrenergic tone is determined by dorsal raphe and
  locus coeruleus activity, while the cholinergic activity is derived from tonically
  active interneurons. Pharmacological agents can affect the model in a number of
  different ways . We calculate the effect of the drug dose-combinations in the receptor
  competition model (as an example here the Dopamine DA receptor competition model),
  a set of differential equations that simulates the competition between neurotransmitter
  and active drug moiety under physiologically realistic conditions of presynaptic
  neuronal firing and autoreceptor coupling (see text for more details). Ten biological
  coupling parameters are fixed by optimizing the correlation outcome of this model
  for a large number of antipsychotic drug-dose combinations (43) and their reported
  clinical efficacy on PANSS total score (Rec = Receptor).
