caption: Model of Pin1-mediated restriction of DNA-end resection. During S/G2 phase
  of the cell cycle, CtIP is phosphorylated at residue T315 by CDK2 and/or CDK1. This
  priming phosphorylation event is necessary for Pin1 binding to CtIP. Upon DSB formation,
  CtIP is further phosphorylated at residue S276 by an as-yet-unknown proline-directed
  kinase (e.g., MAPKs) and subsequently isomerized by Pin1. This conformational change
  promotes CtIP polyubiquitination, leading to its proteasomal degradation. In this
  way, Pin1 counteracts DNA-end resection and hence HR, thereby facilitating NHEJ.
  Our proteomics screen revealed that 53BP1 and BRCA1 could be additional Pin1 substrates.
  Due to their opposite roles in the regulation of DSB repair pathway choice, it will
  be interesting to determine whether Pin1-mediated isomerization may positively (53BP1)
  or negatively (BRCA1) modulate their functions in NHEJ and HR, respectively.
