caption: Mechanisms of 15d-PGJ2 actions. 15d-PGJ2 may interact with a surface receptor(s)
  to initiate activation of signalling pathways (A). CRTH2 (chemokine receptor in
  T helper 2 cell) is expressed in Th2 cells and eosinophils. 15d-PGJ2 can interact
  with CRTH2 on eosinophils to trigger an increase in intracellular calcium resulting
  in activation of a signalling cascade. 15d-PGJ2 may additionally bind to a yet undefined
  PGD2-like receptor on the surface of neutrophils and Type 1 T (or NK) cells to increase
  cAMP and PKA activity. 15d-PGJ2 can also directly affect intracellular pathways
  (B) in a PPAR-γ-dependent and/or -independent manner. Intracellular 15d-PGJ2 can
  be generated either from the endogenous synthesis pathway () or by entry through
  an unknown transporter or passive diffusion. 15d-PGJ2 may react with cysteinyl residues
  in IKKβ and p65 as well as p50 to repress NK-κB-mediated transactivation activity.
  15d-PGJ2 can also bind PPAR-γ, and the ligand/receptor complex interacts with RXR
  to form a heterodimer that recognizes PPRE in the promoter region of target genes
  leading to active transcription. In addition, PPAR-γ can compete with other transcription
  factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB for sequestering essential cofactors such as p300/CBP
  through protein– protein interactions. Furthermore, 15d-PGJ2 affects other signalling
  pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway through undefined mechanisms.
