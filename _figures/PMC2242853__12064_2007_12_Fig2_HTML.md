caption: The Jacob and Monod Model of the operon. In the bacterial operon, several
  coding sequences (cistrons) are coupled together to secure a metabolic pathway as,
  e.g., in case of the lac operon. When activated, such an operon is transcribed as
  a unit and, prior to termination of transcription, a polyribosome is formed on the
  mRNA, and the products, the enzymes Z and Y as well as an acetylase are made. DNA,
  mRNA and the translation machinery form, hence, a tightly linked physical complex;
  therefore (as in a timepiece), arrest at any level stops the entire machinery. In
  the repressed state, in the upstream operator/promoter sequence where the RNA polymerase
  attaches and transcription has to start, the repressor may attach on the basis of
  a sequence-specific protein–DNA interaction, prohibiting transcription. The repressor
  is the product of a distant gene coding for a polypeptide. Once attached to the
  DNA, the repressor may become the target of an inducer, in the case cited a small
  Mr chemical compound reducing the affinity constant of the DNA-repressor interaction.
  Regulation operates thus primarily at transcriptional level, controlling types and
  amounts of polypeptides formed; in this case it acts in a negative manner via the
  repressor, but positive regulation via peptides acting as inducers exists as well.
  Note that the operon arrangement implies already an expression program including
  the operator in the sense of the genon concept
