caption: Simplified schematic diagram showing putative regulation of B. glabrata hemocyte
  H2O2 production stimulated by BSA-gal and PMA. Both pathways appear to involve the
  MAPKs ERK and p38, however their precise signaling pathways and exact role in regulating
  oxidative reactions are unknown as yet. It is possible that MAPKs and the other
  signaling kinases (e.g., PKC) may function in the direct phosphorylation and membrane
  translocation of cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits, or, are acting through other
  pathway signaling components. Also, PI3 kinase and PLA2 appear to regulate downstream
  of BSA-gal only, but their specific function and position in this pathway is unknown.
  The regulation of B. glabrata hemocyte H2O2 production is expected to be more complex
  than depicted in this simplified diagram and include additional signaling molecules.
  Gray circled proteins indicate cytosolic and membrane-associated NADPH oxidase subunits.
  Solid-lined arrows indicate evidence supporting involvement of the signaling molecule
  in downstream events. Dash-lined arrows indicate that interactions may exist, but
  presently are unknown.
