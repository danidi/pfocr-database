caption: Sensing and regulation of intracellular L-Phe levels through the target of
  rapamycin (TOR) pathway. The TOR signalling cascade includes the EGOC complex, TOR
  complex 1 (TORC1), and downstream effectors (Tap42-PPase and Sch9). Intracellular
  L-Phe is sensed by the EGOC complex, and TORC1 can be inhibited. However, upon rapamycin
  treatment or in the presence of a poor nitrogen source, the activity of TORC1 can
  be restrained, which results in the dephosphorylation of Tap42, freeing it from
  the vacuole membrane. Gln3 is dephosphorylated by freed Tap42 and is freed from
  Ure2; then, it targets the nucleus and binds to the GATAA/G motif of nitrogen catabolite
  repression (NCR)-sensitive genes, activating the transcription of NCR-sensitive
  genes. In the presence of glutamate, TORC1 is activated and Gln3 cannot be dephosphorylated
  and resides in the cytoplasm, which represses the expression of NCR-sensitive genes.
