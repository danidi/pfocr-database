caption: 'Comparison of the known purinergic signaling pathways of animals to a hypothetical
  pathway in plants. Several aspects of the cellular responses caused by purinergic
  stimuli are shared between mammals and plants such as elevation of cytosolic free
  calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt), ROS, NO, and membrane conductance changes. In
  mammals, signaling occurs via P2X ionotropic receptors and P2Y metabotropic receptors
  via heterotrimeric G protein (Gαβγ) and phospholipase C (PLC) (and occasionally
  mediated by adenylate cyclase, integrins, and growth factor receptors [,]), whereas
  in plants the purinergic receptor(s) and the exact role of the heterotrimeric G
  protein have not been identified but are clearly different than in animals. Abbreviations:
  Cyt, cytoplasm; ECM, extracellular matrix; PM, plasma membrane.'
