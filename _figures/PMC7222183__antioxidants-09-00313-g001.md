caption: Main mechanisms in ferroptosis. (A) General process of ferroptosis. Balanced
  levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant activity maintains
  an inactive ferroptosis cell death pathway; however, some disturbance in the players
  of this equilibrium could produce a ferroptosis activation. Two important components
  of ferroptosis are the process of transferrin (TF)-iron import and ferroportin (FPN1)
  export. Changes in iron uptake or iron export produce a suppression or activation
  of ferroptosis since the free iron pool is fundamental [,]. Ferroptosis may be enhanced
  through the process of ferritinophagy, by which ferritin is targeted by nuclear
  receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) and delivered to the lysosome for degradation in
  autophagosome [,,]. Consequently, a large quantity of iron can be rapidly released.
  Currently, it has been suggested that ferroptosis initiation might be triggered
  by an increase in free iron levels itself []. Iron increase/or accumulation induces
  the Fenton reaction which increases the production of ROS. Furthermore, the action
  of iron-dependent oxidases [], specifically lipoxygenase activity of 15-LOX (ALOX15)
  that oxidizes polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) phospholipids (PUFA-PLs) containing
  arachidonate or adrenate moieties, triggers the ferroptosis pathway [,]. In addition,
  increased activity of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), an
  enzyme that preferentially activates arachidonic (AA) and adrenoic acids (AdA),
  has been reported to increase ferroptosis [,]. Inhibition of glutathione peroxidase

  Controversial studies are reporting either normal or increased iron levels in the
  nervous system of FRDA patients (reviewed in []). Recently a study in FRDA patients,
  using magnetic resonance imaging, showed increased iron concentration in the extrapyramidal

  autophagic processes are related to FRDA in different models of disease [,], but
  there is no information about ferritinophagic activity. Further studies should be

  cells. All these ferroptotic characteristics observed in FRDA may indicate that
  this kind of cell death may have a role in the physiopathology of this disease.
