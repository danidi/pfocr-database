caption: The increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation has
  been shown to be regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway involving protein kinase
  A (PKA), receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, and by the nonreceptor protein tyrosine
  kinase pathway. cAMP has been shown to activate PKA, which in turn regulates protein
  tyrosine phosphorylation. The binding of PKA regulatory subunit to the AKAP family
  of proteins promotes an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm proteins by
  indirect activation of Tyrosine kinases (TKs). In human sperm, AKAPs proteins, namely
  AKAP3 and FSP95, are the most prominent tyrosine phosphorylated proteins during
  capacitation. Receptors TK is transmembrane proteins having an extracellular ligand
  binding domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Upon extracellular ligand
  binding, a receptor TK are activated and then phosphorylates it (autophosphorylation)
  or other proteins. By contrast, nonreceptor protein TK lacks a transmembrane domain,
  most are soluble intracellular proteins located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, or anchored
  to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Tyrosine and protein phosphorylation
  of the sperm flagellar proteins leads to capacitation of human sperm.
