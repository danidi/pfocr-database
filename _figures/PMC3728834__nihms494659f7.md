caption: A proposed model illustrating the effects of reduced TH in thyroid cancer
  development in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice. In ThrbPV/PV thyroid tumor cells, TRβPV directly
  interacts with PI3K to activate AKT signaling pathway (). By suppression of TH in
  these cells, the membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 was downregulated. In addition,
  the PTEN activity was activated, which decreased the formation of PIP3. The reduction
  of PIP3 decreased the p-AKT and its downstream β-catenin and GSK3β signaling cascades
  to inhibit cell proliferation. The solid arrows indicate the direction of signaling
  cascade. The broken arrows mark the up and down changes.
