caption: NLRP3 is the key PRR involved in the identification of JEV intracellularly
  in a microglia. The NLRP3 interacts with an adaptor molecule, ASC and recruits pro-caspase-1
  forming a biochemical complex termed as inflammasome. In response to JEV, NLRP3
  cleaves pro-caspase-1 into its active form, caspase-1. Caspase-1 then cleaves the
  inactive pro-forms of IL-1β and IL-18 to their mature forms which are then secreted
  out. ROS and K+ efflux are the host derived danger signals that are critical for
  the formation of NLRP3 biochemical complex during JEV infection.
