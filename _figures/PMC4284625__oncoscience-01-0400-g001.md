caption: 'Three distinct parallel pathways are implicated in CRC pathogenesis: Chromosomal
  Instability (CIN), Microsomal Instability (MSI), and Serrated Pathway. The sequential
  genetic and epigenetic changes occurring in each pathway are simplified. (A) The
  CIN pathway is driven by inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such
  as the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and activating mutations in proto-oncogenes,
  such as KRAS etc. which lead to increased clonal expansion of the cells. Subsequent
  loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the long arm of chromosome 18 (18q) and loss of
  tumor suppressor TP53 confer these expanding cells with additional growth advantages
  which ultimately leads to invasive cancers. (B) The MSI pathway is driven by the
  loss of APC gene, and is characterized by inactivation of the mismatch repair (MMR)
  genes, such as MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) etc. The inactivation of MMR genes mostly is
  caused by epigenetic silencing via promoter hypermethylation. The failure of MMR
  genes subsequently leads to mutations in specific target genes involved in proliferation
  and cellular differentiation such as transforming growth factor β receptor II (TGFβRII);
  proteins involved in apoptosis regulation such as BAX and others, ultimately leading
  to microsatellite unstable invasive tumors. (C) The Serrated Pathway is driven by
  hypermethylation of genes and is characterized by presence of proto-oncogene BRAF
  mutation which causes increased MAPKs/ERKs signaling, leading to increased cell
  proliferation. Subsequent methylation of other genes and loss of tumor suppressor
  genes such as TP53, p16 etc. will lead to CRC.'
