caption: In hepatocytes, Cyp7a1 initiates bile acid synthesis from cholesterol to
  form cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in human liver. Bile acids
  activate FXR to induce the repressor SHP, which inhibits H19 expression. In cholestasis,
  bile acids induce H19, which represses the repressor zinc finger E box-binding homeobox
  1 (ZEB1). ZEB1 binds to and represses epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)
  involved in fibrosis. This negative regulatory loop mediates bile acid-induced liver
  fibrosis. In this study, bile duct ligation induced Cyp7a1 but inhibited Shp mRNA
  expression. AAV8-H19 restored Cyp7a1 and Shp involved in bile acid synthesis. The
  anti-apoptotic factor Bcl1 suppresses SHP by promoting SHP decay and reduces H19
  expression to protect against liver fibrosis. In hepatocytes and cholangiocytes,
  taurocholic acid activates the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)/ERK1/2
  pathway to induce H19. TGR5 is activated by secondary bile acid lithocholic acid
  and deoxycholic acid and is expressed in cholangiocytes and Kupffer cells, but not
  in hepatocytes. Differential regulation of these bile acid receptors may modulate
  H19 levels in hepatocytes. H19 may be shuffling between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes
  via the cholehepatic shunt to cause inflammation and cholestatic liver disease.
  Hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells, and stellate cells (HSC) maybe also be involved
  in H19-mediated fibrosis. In bile duct-ligated mice and Mdr2−/− mice, bile acids
  induced H19 levels. Bile acid activation of TGR5 signaling may protect against cholestasis.
  The “?” indicates that the underlying mechanism is not clear and needs to be further
  studied.
