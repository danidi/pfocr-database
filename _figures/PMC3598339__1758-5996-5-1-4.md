caption: Network related to cell cycle and cell death in islets cultured at 23 mM
  glucose concentration. For the explanation of the symbols and letters, see the legend
  to Figure . A total of 33 differentially expressed focus genes were brought into
  this network with a highly significant score of 60. The three nodes Tnf, Myc and
  Lipe were identified by the pathway analysis as part of the network, and their differential
  gene expression was determined subsequently by qRT-PCR.
