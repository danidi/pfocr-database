caption: Redox-regulated inflammatory signaling during macrophage activation. Recognition
  of certain PAMPs by TLRs on either the cell surface or within the endosome will
  activate either MyD88-mediated (TLR2, 4, 7, 8, 9) or TRIF-mediated (TLR3) NF-κB
  pathway activation (A). This includes phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal
  degradation of IκBα, in turn allowing for the phosphorylation and heterodimerization
  of NF-κB-p65 with phosphorylated NF-κB-p50 subunit. The p50/p65 heterodimer then
  translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of inflammatory genes. Also
  on pathogen recognition, the NOX2 complex becomes activated at the membrane, and
  initiates a superoxide-derived oxidative burst, producing free radicals that enhance
  phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB-p65 to enhance signaling. SUMO4 negatively regulates
  signaling by stabilizing IκBα activity and inhibiting NF-κB-p50 DNA binding. Inflammatory
  IFNγ in the local milieu initiates the STAT1 pathway to activate the inflammatory
  M1 macrophage response (B). After IFNγ/IFNGR interaction, phosphorylation and activation
  of Jak1/Jak2 then phosphorylate and activate STAT1, allowing for homodimerization
  and nuclear translocation to initiate an M1 transcriptional profile. Production
  of free radicals on activation can enhance STAT1 signaling by oxidizing and inhibiting
  the activity of several PTPs that can dephosphorylate and inactivate STAT1. IκBα,
  NF-kB inhibitor alpha; IFN, interferon; IFNGR, IFNγ receptor; JAK, janus kinase;
  PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase;
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like
  modifier; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-beta.
