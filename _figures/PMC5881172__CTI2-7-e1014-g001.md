caption: Unfolded protein response. During ER stress, the stress sensors dissociate
  from GRP78 and transduce signals. Cleaved ATF6 translocates to the nucleus to regulate
  the expressions of UPR target genes. Activation of IRE1 leads to its phosphorylation
  and oligomerisation, which induces translation of spliced XBP1 to facilitate protein
  folding, while long‐term IRE1 activation stimulates RIDD signalling to decrease
  ER protein folding load. Finally, activation of PERK pathway decreases ER protein
  load by initiating global translational inhibition through eIF2α. ATF4 gene can
  escape from the translational suppression and translocate to the nucleus to control
  expressions of UPR target genes. Moreover, prolonged activation of UPR leads to
  the expressions of inflammatory genes as shown by the dotted arrows.
