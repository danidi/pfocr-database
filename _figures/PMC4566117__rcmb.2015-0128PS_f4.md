caption: Surfactant metabolism. NKX2–1 (TTF-1) is a transcription factor critical
  for differentiation of type II epithelial cells and regulation of expression of
  Abca3, Slc34a2 (a phosphate transporter), and the surfactant proteins. Newly translated
  surfactant proteins (SPs) (proSP-B and proSP-C) and lamellar body proteins (ABCA3)
  traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi and subsequently to the
  multivesicular body (MVB); in contrast, SP-A and SP-D are constitutively secreted
  by the type II epithelial cells (dotted green arrows). Fusion of the MVB with the
  lamellar body (LB) is accompanied by proteolytic processing of SP-B and SP-C proproteins
  to their mature peptides. Newly synthesized surfactant phospholipids (DPPC, PG)
  are likely transported directly from the ER to the LB by lipid transfer proteins.
  The contents of the LB are secreted into the alveolar space, where they interact
  with SP-A to form tubular myelin and, ultimately, a phospholipid-rich film (surfactant)
  at the air–liquid interface. Cyclical expansion and compression of the bioactive
  film result in incorporation (green arrow) and loss (red arrows) of lipids/proteins
  from the multilayered surface film. Alveolar surfactant lipids and proteins are
  cleared through a granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor–dependent pathway
  that regulates alveolar macrophage differentiation and function. Surfactant remnants
  are also taken up by the type II epithelial cell and recycled to the LB via the
  MVB for resecretion, and a portion is degraded in lysosomes. SP-D plays an important
  role in regulating alveolar surfactant pool size, likely by enhancing its reuptake
  by type II epithelial cells; Gpr116 also regulates alveolar surfactant pool size
  by an unknown mechanism. The MVB integrates surfactant synthesis, secretion, recycling,
  and degradation pathways in the type II cell. Green arrows indicate biosynthetic
  pathways; red arrows indicate degradation and recycling pathways. Dotted arrows
  represent trafficking routes of proteins and lipids.
