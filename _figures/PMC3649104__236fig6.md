caption: Metabolic pathways related to de novo lipogenesis. A liver cell is shown,
  with VLDL secretory pathway and fructose uptake; otherwise, the pathways also apply
  in adipocytes. Circled minus sign, inhibitory action. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  CF'T-1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1; CL, ATP:citrate lyase; FAS, fatty acid
  synthetase; OAA, oxaloacetate; P, phosphate; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TCAC,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle. Reproduced from () with permission.
