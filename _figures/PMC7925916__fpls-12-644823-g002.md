caption: 'Integration of the different components of ethylene, cytokinin, ABA and
  light signaling in multistep phosphorelay during drought and osmotic/salt stress.
  (A) Drought stress stimulates ABA and ethylene content while reducing the endogenous
  levels of cytokinins. Both cytokinin-responsive HKs AHK2, AHK3, and AHK4 as well
  as cytokinin-independent AHK1 and AHK5 contribute to the drought-regulated MSP activity.
  Strong crosstalk (mostly mutually negative) occurs between MSP and canonical ABA
  signaling. Ethylene response factors (ERFs) are also induced and play mostly positive
  role in stress responses. (B) Like drought, osmotic/salt stress also stimulates
  ABA and ethylene production, thus activating ABA and ethylene signaling components,
  while downregulating cytokinin levels and the expression of its downstream signaling
  components. Also, expression of ETR1 is reduced, enabling the continued activity
  and participation of downstream components of ethylene signaling (EIL1, EIN3, and
  ERFs) in the activation of different response factors necessary for the osmotic/salt
  stress response. Phytochromes are also implicated to be involved in drought and
  osmotic/salt stress responses, particularly phyB which was shown to enhance osmotic
  and drought tolerance. See the main text for a detailed description of each signaling
  pathway and their crosstalk in response to stress. Color code: MSP signaling is
  depicted in green, ethylene signaling in blue, light signaling in ochre, abscisic
  acid in purple. The His/Asp phosphorylation is depicted by circled P in bright yellow,
  Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation in orange. Created with BioRender.com.'
