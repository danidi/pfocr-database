caption: During inflammation, SphK1 is moderately expressed. This results in a low
  activation of S1PR1, an increase in lung endothelial barrier permeability and exacerbation
  of ALI (left). During GC treatment of ALI, SphK1 expression in macrophages is synergistically
  induced by the GR- and LPS-triggered signalling via activation of TLR4 p38 MAPK–MSK1.
  This leads to an elevation of S1P, which acts on S1PR1 to decrease lung endothelial
  barrier permeability. This enhanced S1P level is a prerequisite to limit ALI (right).
