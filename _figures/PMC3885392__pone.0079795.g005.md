caption: PI3K-Akt pathway that mediates anti-apoptotic signal is suggested to play
  an important role in the regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells. However, molecular
  mechanisms by which Akt signal regulates autophagy are largely unknown. In this
  study, we demonstrated that the presence of both Akt and Phafin2 on the lysosome
  is critical in the induction of autophagy via interaction of lysosomal PtdIns(3)P
  in mammalian cells. Akt-Phafin2 functional interaction not only clarifies the molecular
  basis of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in the regulation of autophagy, but also
  shows how 3-MA (3-methyladenine), a widely used autophagy inhibitor, inhibits autophagy
  in mammalian cells at molecular levels. It has been suggested that Akt activation
  prevents induction of autophagy, however, the roles of Akt in the regulation of
  autophagy induction is not clear. Hence, the current studies add a new twist to
  the molecular regulation of autophagy via PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in mammalian
  cells.
