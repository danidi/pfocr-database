caption: Small molecule activation of the unfolded protein response improves the folding,
  trafficking, and function of folding compromised secreted proteins. Small molecule
  activation of one or more arms of the unfolded protein response stress responsive
  signaling pathway () in patient-derived fibroblasts partially restores mutant enzyme
  folding, trafficking and lysosomal activity in the case of mutated, misfolding-prone
  enzymes associated with distinct lysosomal storage diseases. Chaperones and folding
  enzymes, increased in concentration in response to activation of the unfolded protein
  response, bind to folding intermediates and transition states of proteins undergoing
  folding, resculpting the folding free energy diagrams of misfolding-prone enzymes
  so as to maximize the population of the folded ensemble, while minimizing misfolding
  and aggregation–increasing the concentration of properly folded mutant enzyme that
  can traffic to the acidic environment of the lysosome, the environment in which
  these enzymes were evolved to function. (Figure adapted from  and reprinted, with

  description: Small molecule activation of the unfolded protein response improves
    the folding, trafficking, and function of folding compromised secreted proteins.
    Small molecule activation of one or more arms of the unfolded protein response
    stress responsive signaling pathway () in patient-derived fibroblasts partially
    restores mutant enzyme folding, trafficking and lysosomal activity in the case
    of mutated, misfolding-prone enzymes associated with distinct lysosomal storage
    diseases. Chaperones and folding enzymes, increased in concentration in response
    to activation of the unfolded protein response, bind to folding intermediates
    and transition states of proteins undergoing folding, resculpting the folding
    free energy diagrams of misfolding-prone enzymes so as to maximize the population
    of the folded ensemble, while minimizing misfolding and aggregation–increasing
    the concentration of properly folded mutant enzyme that can traffic to the acidic
    environment of the lysosome, the environment in which these enzymes were evolved
    to function. (Figure adapted from  and reprinted, with permission, from Elsevier
