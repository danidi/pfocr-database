caption: Mutations of Pkd1 or Pkd2 is associated with increased expression of c-Myc.
  c-Myc binds to miR-17∼92 promoter and enhances its transcription in cystic kidneys.
  The miR-17∼92 primary transcript is processed to yield the individual mature miRNAs.
  In the cytoplasm, the mature miRNAs (miR-17 and miR-19) bind to Pparα 3′-UTR. PPARα
  is known to regulate the expression of key metabolic genes involved in mitochondrial
  OXPHOS pathway. miR-17 and miR-19 binding to Pparα 3′-UTR lead to reduced Pparα
  expression, which in turn affects mitochondrial metabolism in kidney epithelial
  cells.
