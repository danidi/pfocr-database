caption: p120catenin regulation of Rho-GTPase signalling. Depending on its localization,
  p120catenin shows distinct modes of regulation of Rho-GTPases. Cytosolic p120catenin
  regulates Rho-GTPases by direct association with RhoA. p120catenin functions as
  a RhoGDI, inhibiting RhoA by sequestering it in its inactive form (RhoA-GDP). Membrane-associated
  p120catenin inhibits RhoA by interacting with p190RhoGAP, a protein which increases
  RhoA GTPase activity. In parallel, cytosolic p120catenin activates Cdc42 and Rac1
  by associating with the exchange factor Vav2, which promotes the GTP loading on
  these two GTPases. Moreover, p120catenin can indirectly decrease RhoA activity via
  Rac1. GTP-bound Rac1 activates p190RhoGAP via a pathway involving reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases (LMW-PTPs).
  Moreover, p120catenin regulates Rho-GTPase signalling by interacting with downstream
  targets. For instance, cytosolic p120catenin interacts with N-WASP to enhance Cdc42-dependent
  actin polymerization. It also inhibit myosin phosphatase rho-interacting protein
  (Mrip), an antagonist of Rho/ROCK signal.
