caption: Model based on the findings of , , , , and . An alternative arrangement,
  in which GOA-1 acts through EAT-16, is equally consistent with the available data
  (). Arrows denote activation. Bars at the end of a line denote inhibition. Proteins
  that promote or activate synaptic transmission are shown in green blocks. Reducing
  the function of these proteins results in aldicarb resistance and reduced locomotion
  rates. Proteins that inhibit synaptic transmission are shown in red blocks. Reducing
  the function of these proteins results in aldicarb hypersensitivity and hyperactive
  locomotion. Neurotransmitter inputs into this pathway are not specified.
