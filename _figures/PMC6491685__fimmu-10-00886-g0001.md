caption: The complement system. The complement system can be activated by three pathways.
  The classical (CP) and lectin (LP) pathways involve recognition of target-bound
  antibody or pathogen-specific carbohydrates by C1q or MBL, respectively. In the
  alternative pathway (AP), continuous, low-level activation of C3 by spontaneous
  hydrolysis of the internal C3 thioester, or C3 cleavage by plasma proteases, generates
  C3(H2O) or C3b. Activation by any of the three pathways leads to the generation
  of C3 convertase complexes (C4b2a in the CP/LP and C3bBb in the AP) that cleave
  C3 into C3a and C3b. Additionally, the AP C3 convertase can bind properdin (P),
  a positive regulator that stabilizes the enzyme, extending its half-life more than
  10-fold. The C3b generated can, in turn, forms more AP C3 convertase, allowing amplification
  of complement activation. The binding of a new C3b molecule to the C3 convertases
  creates the C5 convertases (C4b2aC3b or C3bBbC3b), which cleave C5 into C5a and
  C5b. C5b then initiates the terminal complement pathway, which eventually leads
  to the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) and lysis of the target
  cells. Complement activation is controlled at various levels by different soluble
  and membrane regulatory proteins (indicated within boxes).
