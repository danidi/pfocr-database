caption: 'A diagram representing the interactions between the sensory nerves, skin,
  and arterioles. Antidromic sensory nerve stimulation results in an electrical impulse
  firing towards the spinal cord and axon reflex to the peripheral vasculature, where
  CGRP is released from the nerve terminals acting on the arterioles, causing vasodilatation.
  CGRP can mediate this response by: 1) directly activating its receptors on the vascular
  smooth muscles and mediating relaxation via the Gαspathway; and 2) activating receptors
  on endothelial cells to enhance NO production, which can diffuse into the vascular
  smooth muscles to mediate vasorelaxation via GC activation. CGRP is also released
  from the central projections of DRG neurons where it may play a role in central
  sensitization. AC, adenylyl cyclase; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; GC,
  guanylyl cyclase; NO, nitric oxide; PKA, protein kinase A; PKG, protein kinase G;
  VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell.'
