caption: 'SAM serves as the methyl donor for numerous methylation reactions, including
  DNA methylation and synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. During methyl group donation,
  SAM is converted into SAH, a potent competitive inhibitor of many methyltransferases
  including DNMTs. Demethylated SAM then is further processed to Hcy, which in turn
  is converted back to methionine either through a folate-dependent mechanism (the
  folate cycle on the right side of the schematic, in which 5-mTHF is the methyl donor
  in the MS pathway) or a folate-independent mechanism (in the left side of the schematic,
  in which betaine is the methyl donor in the BHMT pathway). MAT: Methionine adenosyltransferase;
