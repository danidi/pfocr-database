caption: 'The HIF1 pathway in normoxia (A) and hypoxia (B). (A) HIF1α hydroxylation
  and degradation in the presence of oxygen involves: (1) the independent oxidation-reduction
  reactions of ascorbate (Asc) and iron (Fe); (2) and (3) prolyl hydroxlyase 2 (PHD2)
  binding to Fe, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), and O2; (4a) PHD2 hydroxylation of HIF1α, involving
  (4b) production of the by-products succinate and CO2; (5) unbound hydroxylated HIF1α
  moving in the cell cytoplasm; (6) the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) - Elongin B (EB) -
  Elongin C (EC) complex ubiquitinating HIF1α; and (7) HIF1α degradation. A color
  change in HIF1α indicates addition of a hydroxyl group. (B) In hypoxia, HIF1α enters
  the nucleus, where hydroxylation, but no degradation occurs. (1) and (2) PHD2 binding
  to Fe, 2OG and Asc, but not O2. (3) The protein inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4) binding
  to PHD2 may regulate HIF1α transcriptional activity and (4) block HIF1α-HIF1β binding.
  (5) When HIF1α-HIF1β binding occurs, the HIF1 dimer can transcriptionally activate
  genes at the hypoxia response element (HRE) site. Activated HIF1-dependent genes,
  where protein levels are upregulated, include PHD2 (6a) and HIF1α (6b). (C) Schematic
  of a potential mechanism for adaptation during chronic hypoxia. Three feedback loops
  govern HIF1α hydroxylation; HIF1α synthesis; prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) synthesis;
  and succinate production inhibition. Succinate is also a metabolic product of the
  TCA cycle.'
