caption: A Proposed Model Illustrating the Ethylene Signaling Pathway That Requires
  EIN2 and EBF1/EBF2 to Regulate the Functions of EIN3 and EIL1.The ethylene signal
  is perceived by a linear pathway involving the receptors, CTR1, EIN2, and EBF1/EBF2,
  to ultimately activate EIN3 and EIL1 transcription factors. Ethylene acts to promote
  the proteasomal breakdown of EBF1/EBF2, which form the SCF complex to target EIN3/EIL1
  for proteolysis. Both EIN2 and EBF1/EBF2 are indispensible for ethylene-induced
  EIN3/EIL1 accumulation. EIN3 and EIL1 act cooperatively but differentially in the
  ethylene response pathway. The MKK4/MKK5- and MKK9-activated MPK3/MPK6 kinases are
  believed to enhance ethylene production by upregulating ACS abundance, although
  MKK9-MPK3/MPK6 were reported to directly phosphorylate EIN3 and modulate its stability
  (). Several ethylene signaling components (ETR2, EIN2, EBF1/EBF2, and EIN3/EIL1)
  are subject to ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, with the responsible E3
  ligases for the receptors and EBF1/EBF2 remaining unidentified. Arrows and bars
  represent positive and negative regulations, respectively. The solid lines indicate
  direct regulation, whereas the dotted lines indicate either indirect regulation
  or regulation in an unknown manner.
