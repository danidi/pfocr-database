caption: 'Workflow. Workflow of miRTrail. User submits two RNA sets (one is the set
  of deregulated miRNAs, the other is the set of deregulated mRNAs, both for the same
  disease). Orange color represents information flow of miRNA-related information:
  For each provided miRNA, the target mRNAs are determined (based on microCosm predictions
  or custom, uploaded interactions). This information then is used by miRTrail, indicated
  by the red arrow. In general, red color represents flow of mRNA-related information:
  The uploaded mRNA set as well as the miRNA targets are used in GeneTrail to perform
  ORAs as described in the "Methods"-section. Blue color represents information flow
  of results-related information, e.g. for the overlap of pathway sets. Finally in
  the results, the network analysis allows for targeted inspection of the provided
  information, based e.g. on miRNA families-related subnetworks. The modular design
  of miRTrail becomes visible here, also allowing for convenient extension of future
  analyses and usage for a diversity of different organisms.'
