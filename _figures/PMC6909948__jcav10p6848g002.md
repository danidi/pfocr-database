caption: ADCY1 can participate in abundant cellular signaling pathways and contributes
  to physical behavior through the regulation of cAMP. ADCY1 can catalyze the formation
  of cAMP to modulate a series of signaling pathways. The major downstream effectors
  of cAMP including CNGs, EPACs and PKAs, which can regulate various cellular activities.
  And the mistaken control of ADCY1 as the upstream modulator can contribute to complex
  disorder of these regulation. The complicated signaling pathway indicate the probable
  association between ADCY1 and lung cancer.
