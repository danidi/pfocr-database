caption: Model illustrating CD40-induced signals that mediate the expression of VEGF
  in endothelial cells. Our previous report () demonstrated that the ligation of CD40
  mediates VEGF expression through the Ras and PI3K signaling pathway. In these studies,
  we found a critical role for mTOR and Rictor (mTORC2) in CD40-induced phosphorylation
  of Akt (arrow 1), a function for Akt in VEGF expression (arrow 2) and a function
  for mTORC2 in CD40-induced expression of VEGF (arrow 3). In addition, following
  activation with a dominant active construct of Akt, we found that a pharmacological
  mTOR inhibitor did not block VEGF expression. Rather, inhibition of mTORC1 via knockdown
  of raptor resulted in an increased phosphorylation of Akt (arrow 4) and an increase
  in endogenous expression of VEGF (arrow 5). Our data provide for a model in which
  mTORC1 activity provides negative feedback for endogenous VEGF expression, but CD40-inducible
  expression is dependent on mTORC2-Akt signaling.
