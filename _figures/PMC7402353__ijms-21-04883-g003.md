caption: 'Schematic representation of the 13 major receptor groups involved in itch
  and their endogenous pruritogens. Each receptor is colored based on two parameters:
  First, GPCR signaling (blue button) or non-GPCR signaling (white button) and second,
  ion channel signaling pathway. TRPA1/TRPV1 signaling is represented by a blue sector,
  TRPV1 signaling is represented by a yellow sector and TRPA1 signaling is represented
  by an orange sector. The arrows indicate the type of contribution of the receptor
  and its endogenous pruritogens to itch sensation. White arrows represent itch modulators
  and grey arrows represent itch mediators.'
