caption: 'Comparison of pathways of the rod (A) and the cone (B) visual cycles. A:
  Pathways of the classical rhodopsin visual cycle in the retina and RPE of the eye
  (see sections A-1 and A-2 for details). B: Pathways of the novel cone visual cycle
  in the cone-dominated retina. (see Section C-4 for details). Enzymes that have been
  characterized with apparent kinetic constants in the cone visual pathway are indicated
  with bold font and they include Isomerase II (), 11-cis and all-trans retinyl ester
  hydrolase (REH) (), 11-cis Acyl CoA Retinol Acyl Transferase (ARAT) (; ) and retinyl
  dehydrogenase (RDH-oxidase) (). Uncharacterized enzymes are indicated with normal
  font; these include all-trans retinyl dehydrogenase (RDH-reductase) in the cone
  outer segment, all-trans retinyl ester synthase, and 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase
  in the M端ller cell. The retinoid binding proteins IRBP and CRBP/CRALBP have been
  located in the interphotoreceptor matrix and M端ller cells, respectively (; ; ).'
