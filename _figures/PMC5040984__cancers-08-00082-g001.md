caption: 'Patents and clinical trials involving the Wnt signaling pathway. Only the
  components of the Wnt pathway relevant to the patent or clinical trial searches
  are shown. Patents refer to novel compounds, peptides or proteins that modulate
  some aspect of the Wnt pathway. Red and green hued Wnt signaling components refer
  to the endogenous function of the protein as an inhibitor or activator of Wnt signaling,
  respectively. Grey transparent circles identify the space related to the percentage
  of patents or clinical trials occupying that space: Extracellular domain, cytoplasmic
  domain, nuclear domain or Wnt secretion domain. Percentages are relative to the
  total number of P/PA identified (103) or the number of clinical trials (34). See  for
  details on the enhancers and inhibitors in the different compartments. For the clinical
  trials, there are two unspecified targets and two that are targeting the epigenome,
  which together account for 11% of all clinical trials. Note that an absence of patent
  information for the Secretion and Nuclear domains does not mean there are no patents
  in these domains, just that they were not recovered from this search.'
