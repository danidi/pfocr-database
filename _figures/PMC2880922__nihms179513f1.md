caption: 'Pathways involved in ascorbic acid biosynthesis and regeneration in plants
  and their interaction with other metabolic networks. The pathways shown are: the
  mannose/galactose (Man/Gal) route, the gulose (Gul) shunt, the galacturonase (GalU)
  pathway, and the myo-inositol (MI) route [reviewed in ]. The proposed “VTC2 cycle”
  [] is also shown. This cycle that links photosynthesis, ascorbate and cell wall
  biosynthesis was proposed based on the fact that VTC2 is able to use glucose-1 phosphate
  and GDP-D-glucose as substrates and also on the existence of a GDP-D-mannose-2′-epimerase
  activity in plants. A purple acid phosphatase with phytase activity has been shown
  to channel phytate to the MI pathway to ascorbate [], while VTC4 has been shown
  to also use L-myo-inositol-1 phosphate and contribute to both myo-inositol and ascorbate
  metabolisms[]. Genes encoding enzymes highlighted in red are induced in response
  to MeJA or wounding according to data from Genevestigator and results herein and
  []. As indicated by the gray minus symbol, multiple genes in the Man/Gal route are
  negatively regulated by AMRI (ascorbic acid mannose pathway regulator 1), an F-box
  containing protein []. Intermediates highlighted in green that participate in the
  Man/Gal and MI pathways are also involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall components,
  while dehydroascorbate is the precursor of tartaric, oxalic and threonic acids.
  Enzymes: 1 phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9); 2 phosphomannose isomerase (PMI,
  EC 5.1.3.1.8); 3 phosphomannose mutase (PMM, EC 5.4.2.8); 4 GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase
  (VTC1, EC 2.7.7.13); 5 GDP-mannose,3′,5′-epimerase (GME, EC 5.1.3.18); 6 GDP-galactose
