caption: Illustration of the strain-dependent alterations in STEP phosphorylation
  and proteolysis following mechanical stretch injury via the NMDAR and calcineurin
  pathways. Under physiological conditions, the phosphorylation state of STEP is regulated
  by a balance of PKA and calcineurin (CaN) signaling. Once activated (STEP★), STEP
  can proceed to affect numerous downstream pathways. After 50% sublethal stretch
  injury, calcium influx through the synpatic/NR2A-containing NMDARs results in increased
  STEP phosphorylation that is dependent on calcineurin through an unknown mechanism.
  After 80% lethal stretch injury, calcium influx through the extrasynaptic/NR2B-containing
  NMDARs causes STEP dephosphorylation and proteolysis via a non-calcineurin-mediated
  pathway (STEP, striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate;
  PKA, protein kinase A; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases).
