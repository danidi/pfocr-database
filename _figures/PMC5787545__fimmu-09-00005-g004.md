caption: Tryptophan mediates the bacteria–immune crosstalk. When induced by proinflammatory
  cytokines, the majority of tryptophan is metabolized through the kynurenine (Kyn)
  pathway mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Kyn can serve as agonists
  for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and act on dendritic cell (DCs) to inhibit
  DCs maturation. Through AhR, Kyn can cause T cell energy loss and apoptosis, promote
  the proliferation of Treg and Th17 cells, and also decrease the differentiation
  of highly inflammatory Th17 cells and enhance the generation of IL-22 and IL-10.
  Tryptophan can be degraded to 5-HT by the aid of Tryptophan hydroxylase gene (TPH1).
  Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli can also synthesize
  5-HT themselves from tryptophan. Spore-forming bacteria (Sp) can regulate the concentration
  and synthesis of 5-HT. Melatonin can be then secreted after 5-HT, which can affect
  the differentiation of Th17 cells in the intestine.
