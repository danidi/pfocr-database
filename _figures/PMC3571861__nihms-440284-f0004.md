caption: Metabolic engineering of E. coli for long-chain alcohol production. (a) Synthetic
  operons for gene expression in threonine overproducer to produce linear chain alcohols.
  Overexpression of ThrABC and IlvA drives the carbon flux toward 2-ketobutyrate.
  Engineered protein H97A/S139G/N167G/P169A/G462D EcLeuA (LeuA*) enables EcLeuA*BCD
  to catalyze recursive elongation of natural metabolite 2-ketobutyrate (n = 1) to
  2-ketooctanoate (10). Decarboxylation and reduction of 2-ketononanoate by Kivd and
  Adh6 results in 1-octanol (11). (b) Synthetic operons for gene expression in phenylalanine
  overproducer. LeuA* enables the elongation of phenylpyruvate (12) into homophenylpyruvate
  (13). Decarboxylation and reduction of 2-ketononanoate by Kivd and Adh6 result in
  phenylpropanol (14).
