caption: Schematic of Hedgehog signaling pathway. The initially insoluble Hedgehog
  (HH) ligand precursor undergoes a series of intracellular modifications before reaching
  an active, multimeric form. Following release from the membrane by Dispatched (DISP),
  the morphogen binds to Patched (PTCH), which releases Smoothened (SMO) from constitutive
  inhibition by PTCH. This activates the Gli2/3 complex, which goes on to promote
  gene expression of Gli1, while repressing the transcriptional repressor Gli3.
