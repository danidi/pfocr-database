caption: The CD28 pathway ranked fifth in significance and fourth by differential
  expression (p-value = 1.07×10−10) using Metacore pathway analysis. Pathway analysis
  also determined the CTLA-4 pathway to be differentially affected (p-value = 1.18×10−8).
  CTLA-4, CD86 and CD80 mRNA levels were significantly increased while CD28 and TCR
  signaling-related mRNA levels were decreased. Red genes represent significant increases
  in mRNA levels and blue genes represent significant decreases in mRNA levels in
  thymus tissue following LPS treatment. Mean fold changes are given. Green arrows
  indicate positive influence and red T-bars indicate negative influence. Arrows may
  represent multiple steps. Plasma membranes are shown in gray. Nuclear membrane is
  shown as dotted line. A detailed version of the original Metacore pathways are in  and
  . A full legend of all GeneGo pathway map symbols is in  or at http://www.genego.com/pdf/MC_legend.pdf.
