  transferase; tpiA, triosephosphate isomerase; pykA, pyruvate kinase; in pentose
  phosphate pathway: gnd, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; talB, transaldolase; in
  Entner-Duodoroff pathway: edd, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase; in gluconeogenesis:
  pckA, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; and in the TCA cycle: sdhB, succinate dehydrogenase;
  fumC, fumarate hydratase; frdA, fumarate reductase. (From, Alteri, Christopher J.,
