caption: 'Apoptosis pathways. Intrinsic stress (e.g., DNA damage and metabolic stress)
  induces the expression and/or activation of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, which
  either suppress antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins or directly activate BAX and
  BAK (). BAX and BAK induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).
  Upon MOMP, cytochrome c (Cyt. c) is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space. The release of cytochrome c triggers the formation of apoptosome in the cytoplasm,
  which recruits and activates caspase-9. Active caspase-9 cleaves and activates effector
  caspases, caspases-3 and -7. Intrinsic stress also engages the formation of PIDDosome
  which is composed of PIDD, RAIDD, and caspase-2. Through proximity-induced activation,
  casapse-2 becomes active and cleaves BID. Once cleaved, BID (tBID: truncated BID)
  becomes an active BH3-only protein. Extrinsic stress (e.g., TNF and TRAIL) is mediated
  through the death receptor, which forms the DISC (Death Inducing Signaling Complex)
  with FADD and caspase-8. Active caspase-8 directly cleaves and activates effector
  caspases or triggers the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through BID cleavage. TNF;
  tumor necrosis factor, TRAIL; TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.'
