caption: Zika virus life cycle. ZIKV, an enveloped RNA virus, enters cells by receptor-mediated
  endocytosis and fuses its membranes by an acidic-pH-triggered mechanism in the endosome
  (via cell surface receptors such as AXL, Tyro3, DC-SIGN and TIM-1) to release the
  viral RNA. The ssRNA is then translated, and the resulting polyprotein is further
  cleaved into various structural and non-structural proteins (C, prM, E and NS proteins).
  Replication takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surface. Transcription
  and replication of the dsDNA results in the formation of new viral mRNA and ssRNA,
  respectively. Virus assembly takes place in the ER membrane and leads to the formation
  of immature virions, which are transported through the exocytic pathway. The prM
  protein is cleaved and the virus is rendered mature. Finally, the mature virus exits
  the cell via exocytosis.
