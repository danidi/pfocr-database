caption: Mechanism of endocytic downregulation of RTKs. The figure illustrates RTK
  downregulation, with EGFR as an example. Ligand binding triggers receptor autophosphorylation
  via receptor dimerization. c-Cbl associates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated RTK
  and mediates its multi-ubiquitination. This facilitates endocytosis of the receptor
  via clathrin-coated pits. Proteins such as Epsin, Eps15 and Hip1 may be involved
  in cargo recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. Clathrin polymerization is catalysed
  by AP-180/CALM, and vesicle formation is facilitated by Dynamin and Endophilin.
  The endocytic vesicle uncoats (facilitated by Synaptojanin) and fuses with an early
  endosome, by a mechanism catalysed by the small GTPase Rab5 and its effectors. At
  the early endosome, the ubiquitinated RTK is sorted into a ‘bilayered' clathrin
  coat, probably by associating with ubiquitin-binding proteins such as Hrs and STAM.
  From here, the RTK is sorted into intraluminal vesicles of the endosome, in a process
  mediated by ESCRT-I (whose subunit Tsg101 binds Hrs as well as ubiquitin), ESCRT-II
  and ESCRT-III. The RTK is probably dephosphorylated and deubiquitinated during this
  sorting step. From the early endosome, a multivesicular body (MVB)/endosomal carrier
  vesicle is formed in an Annexin-II-dependent fashion (), which ultimately fuses
  with a late endosome or a lysosome. Intraluminal vesicles with their content are
  then degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. Ubiquitin-binding/monoubiquitinated proteins
  are in red, proteins found as oncogenic fusion proteins (see ) are in italics, and
  proteins experimentally implicated in cancer (see ) are in bold. A recycling pathway
  from the early endosome to the plasma membrane, which is followed by non-ubiquitinated
  membrane proteins, is indicated by dashed arrows. For simplicity, a number of known
  components of the endocytosis machinery, including specific lipids (), have been
  omitted from the figure. Note that RTKs can also be endocytosed from other invaginations
  than clathrin-coated pits, but the significance of this alternative internalization
  in RTK downregulation is not known ().
