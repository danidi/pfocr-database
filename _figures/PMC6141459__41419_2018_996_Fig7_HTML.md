caption: MNNG or OGD/reoxygenation induces the generation of ROS, which can directly
  lead to parthanatos or target ER calcium channels (IP3R), leading to the release
  of calcium from the ER into the cytosol. As a result, mitochondria take up Ca2+,
  which leads to mitochondrial depolarization, and in turn promotes mitochondrial
  ROS production. Mitochondrial ROS can lead to parthanatos or further increase Ca2+
  release from ER, resulting in a vicious feedback cycle. Besides, Propofol can inhibit
  the generation of ROS and Ca2+, which in turn inhibits parthanatos
