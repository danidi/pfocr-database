caption: Complement system and complement regulatory proteins (CRegs). The complement
  system can be activated through three pathways and complement activation triggers
  a sequence of biological reactions which result in the generation of effector molecules
  (e.g., C3a, C3b, C5a, MAC) with potent immunological activities. The classical pathway
  can be activated by antigen-antibody complexes or by substances such a C-reactive
  protein. C1, C2, C4, and C3 are the components of the classical pathway. Activation
  of the alternative pathway does not require the presence of an antibody; C3, factor
  B, factor D, and properdin are the components of the alternative pathway. Like the
  alternative pathway, the activation of the lectin pathway is also antibody independent
  and can be achieved by interaction of serum lectins (e.g., mannose-binding protein,
  MBL), with sugar residues present on the bacterial cell wall. All three pathways
  converge on a common reaction that results in the formation of an enzyme—C3 convertase.
  This enzyme cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b forms C5 convertase that ultimately
  leads to the formation of membrane attack complex (MAC). The complement cascade
  is regulated at different check points (shown with black blocks) by CRegs. The soluble
  CRegs are shown in white boxes and the membrane-bound CRegs are shown in gray boxes
