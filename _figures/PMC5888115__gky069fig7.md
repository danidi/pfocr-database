caption: Expanded regulatory roles of Cra with its overriding effect on CRP regulation.
  Cra redirects the flux of the glycolysis pathway towards gluconeogenesis with a
  reduced amount of flux, and increases the reaction flux of the glyoxylate shunt
  pathway. For those pathways, the overriding regulatory effect of Cra over CRP ensures
  the optimal growth of E. coli. In addition, the previously unknown regulation by
  Cra on the components of the respiratory chain enables converting between energy
  molecules, balancing increased flux through TCA cycle, and decrease flux through
  gluconeogenesis.
