caption: Involvement of the Notch signaling pathway during endocrine cell differentiation.
  The Notch ligand Delta is first up-regulated in differentiating endocrine cells.
  It binds to Notch on neighboring non-endocrine cells, which results in release of
  the Notch intracellular domain (Notch IC). Notch IC translocates into the nucleus
  and interacts with RBP-Jκ to activate target genes such as Hes1. Hes1 then inhibits
  proendocrine bHLH transcription factors such as Ngn3.
