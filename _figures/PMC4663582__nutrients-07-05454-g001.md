caption: Pathophysiology of “Metabolic NAFLD”, which causes and consequences resemble
  those of the insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome (MetS). Overeating and physical
  inactivity predispose to both conditions. Excess glucose, fructose and amino acids
  are converted to triglyceride (TG) in the liver via de novo lipogenesis (DNL), which
  pathway is increased in NAFLD []. Alterations in gut microbiota in obesity increase
  gut permeability to bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which
  may contribute to inflammation in both adipose tissue and the liver []. Overeating
  leads to adipose tissue expansion, hypoxia, increased fibrosis and cell death. Dead
  adipocytes are surrounded by macrophages, which produce cytokines such as tumor-necrosis
  alpha and chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. This impairs the
  ability of insulin to inhibit lipolysis i.e., inhibit release of free fatty acids
  (FFA) and leads to deficiency of the insulin-sensitizing cytokine adiponectin. The
  latter two changes promote synthesis of intrahepatocellular TG. The ability of insulin
  to suppress glucose and VLDL production is impaired resulting in mild hyperglycemia
  and hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia (TG↑) and a low HDL cholesterol concentration
  (HDL chol↓). The fatty liver also overproduces many other factors such as the liver
  enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyltransferase
  (GGT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and coagulation factors [].
