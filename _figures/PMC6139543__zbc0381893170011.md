caption: Proposed alternative metabolic/antidotal pathway of atRAL in the retina.
  In the visual (retinoid) cycle, after light exposure, atRAL is released from rhodopsin
  into the cytoplasm of photoreceptor cells. Subsequently, atRAL is reduced into atROL
  (also called vitamin A) and transported from ROS into RPE cells with the help of
  IRBP. Next, all-trans-retinyl ester is generated by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase
  (LRAT)-mediated esterification of atROL and then undergoes isomerization to produce
  11-cis-ROL with the action of RPE65. RDH5 oxidizes 11-cis-ROL into 11-cis-RAL, which
  is transported back into the ROS and binds to free opsin to regenerate fresh rhodopsin.
  However, when clearance of atRAL in the visual (retinoid) cycle is disrupted, atRAL
  is overaccumulated and causes toxicity to both photoreceptor and RPE cells. Accordingly,
  we propose an alternative detoxification module or metabolic pathway of atRAL in
  the retina. Excess atRAL provokes the formation of atRAL-dimer in both ROS and RPE
  in an undefined manner. Phagocytosis of shed ROS by RPE cells on a daily basis translocates
  atRAL, all-trans–NR-PE, atRAL-dimer, and photocleavage products of atRAL-dimer resident
  in the ROS into the RPE. It should be mentioned that an additional source of atRAL
  in the RPE is all-trans–NR-PE decomposition. Light-mediated fragmentation of atRAL-dimer
  does not cause damage to RPE cells and produces low-molecular-weight cleavage products
  that may readily pass through membranes to enter the intercellular matrix, thereby
  being metabolically eliminated.
