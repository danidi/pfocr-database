caption: Regulatory network required for Casparian strip formation in Arabidopsis.
  CASPs act as a local scaffold to recruit RBOHF, PER64, and ESB1 to help local lignin
  polymerization. MYB36 is a master regulator of activation of the expression of CASP1,
  ESB1, and PER64. The expression of MYB36 depends on SCR, a direct target of SHR.
  SHR only expresses in stele and moves to the endodermal cell via the symplastic
  pathway. To precisely restrict CS distribution on the cell membrane, two receptor-like
  kinases, SGN1 and SGN3, need to play a combinatorial role. The stele derived small
  peptides, CIFS move to endodermis by apoplastic pathway to bind directly to SGN3
  to promote the intact CS. With the coordinative regulation of these components,
  A. thaliana can ensure the precision of spatiotemporal formation of CS in the endodermis
  directly contacting the stele.
