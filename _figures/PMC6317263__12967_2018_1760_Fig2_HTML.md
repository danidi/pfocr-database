caption: Milk exosomes and allergy prevention. Human breast milk and dairy milk exosomes
  transfer miR-148a and miR-29b, which both suppress DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1).
  DNMT1 controls the methylation status of the Treg-specific demethylation region
  (TSDR) on the FOXP3 promoter. DNMT1 suppression (TSDR hypomethylation) increases
  FoxP3 expression. Milk exosome-derived miR-155 inhibits suppressor of cytokine signaling
  1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway that increases the expression
  of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) promoting FoxP3 expression.
  Milk exosome-derived transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) enhances SMAD5 signaling
  that further increases FoxP3 expression, especially in the thymus. Milk exosomes
  thus promote the induction of FoxP3, the master transcription factor of regulatory
  T cells (Tregs), the potential mechanism preventing allergy development by breast
  feeding or raw farm milk consumption during early infancy
