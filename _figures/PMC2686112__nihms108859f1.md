caption: The VHL gene complex targets hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) for ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation. When there is a mutation in the VHL gene in clear cell kidney cancer,
  in either the elongin binding or the HIF binding domain (A), HIF is not degraded
  and this protein over-accumulates. Increased HIF levels lead to increased transcription
  of a number of downstream pathway genes that are thought to be important in kidney
  cancer, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the glucose transporter,
  GLUT1, and transforming growth factor _ (TGF_) (B). Targeted approaches to therapy
  currently include tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the downstream gene receptors
  (C). Other approaches being developed to target the VHL-HIF pathway in clear cell
  kidney cancer include the development of small molecules or other agents which block
  HIF transcription. Reprinted from Linehan et al. [].
