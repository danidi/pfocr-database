caption: Simplified signal transduction pathway diagrams for representative NLRs and
  STAND proteins. Signalling of NLR proteins is complex and occurs in a family-dependent
  manner. One of the earliest-characterized NLRs, NOD1 (nucleotide oligomerization
  domain protein 1), directly interacts with MAMPs such as LPS and activates the transcription
  factor NF-κB, resulting in the of release pro-inflammatory cytokines (; ). The NLRC
  (NLR family, CARD containing) and NLRP (NLR family, PYD containing) family members
  have also been demonstrated to release pro-inflammatory cytokines through the activation
  of caspase-1, mediated by CARD/PYD domain interactions directly with caspase-1 or
  through the ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) adaptor
  protein (; ). However, there is a large body of evidence suggesting there is no
  direct interaction between these proteins and their stimuli. Members of the NAIP
  family of NLRs function as sensors in cooperation with NLRC proteins, which act
  as adaptors (; ; ). The cooperation of NAIP proteins with NLRP proteins is yet to
  be determined, but has been speculated (). NLRP and NLRC proteins have been implicated
  in the activation of pyroptosis through ASC-dependent and independent caapase-1
  activation (; ; ). Activation of NLRP and NLRC proteins results in the formation
  of large oligomeric assemblies termed inflammasomes (; ; ; ; ). The NOD-containing
  apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) has been demonstrated to activate
  caspase-9-mediated apoptosis through direct interaction with cytosolic cytochrome
  c, released from a disrupted mitochondrial matrix (; ). Like NLRC proteins, activated
  APAF-1 forms a large oligomeric assembly, the apoptosome, but in a 1:1 stoichiometry
  with cytochrome c (; ). Little is known about the signalling pathways of plant NLRs
  in comparison with their animal counterparts. What is clear is that stimulus detection
  can occur in a direct or indirect manner, and that self-association of N-terminal
  signalling domains is vital for NLR signalling (Bernoux et al., ; ; ,). However,
  upstream and downstream signalling partners for most plant NLRs remain elusive.
