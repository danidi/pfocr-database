caption: Model for EtOH-induced BK channel internalization via Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  When the Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway is “off,” as under control conditions
  (naive), the APC/Axin/GSK-3β-complex leads to a pattern of β-catenin phosphoryation
  (yellow), resulting in its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We hypothesize
  that GSK-3β is responsible for the phosphorylation of both BK and β-catenin, resulting
  in direct association of the channel with β-catenin. This association supports stable
  BK surface expression. EtOH is likely inhibiting GSK-3β phosphorylation and potentially
  directly associating with the BK channel. The inactivation of GSK3 is itself an
  important step during Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Activation of the pathway starts with
  Wnt associating with its receptor resulting in the GSK-3β-complex being sequestered
  by the protein Dishevelled (Dsh) into a receptor complex restricting β-catenin phophorylation
  (green) and presumably BK phosphorylation. This has two important consequences.
  First, β-catenin is protected from ubiquitination/degradation. This is followed
  by β-catenin accumulation and translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to LEF/TCF
  transcription factors supporting the transcription of Wnt target genes. Second,
  the association between β-catenin and BK is severed, resulting in internalization
  of the BK channel.
