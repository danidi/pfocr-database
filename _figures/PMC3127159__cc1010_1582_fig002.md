caption: TPO signaling pathway. In unstimulated cells (A), Mpl (in yellow) exists
  as a monomer, and signaling molecules, such as JAK2 and STATs, are inactive. Upon
  TPO binding (B), Mpl dimerizes. This conformational change results in phosphorylation
  of its associated JAK2 molecules, which leads to phosphorylation of Mpl and activation
  of downstream signaling pathways, including STATs, the MAPK pathway and the PI3K
  pathway. JAK2 can phosphorylate STAT3 and STAT5 in response to TPO signaling, which
  results in their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus. There transcription
  is initiated, and the integration of these pathways leads to the downstream effect
  of TPO. STATs also induce transcription of SOCS proteins, which are generally not
  expressed, resulting in negative feedback and downregulation of JAK2 and Mpl activation.
