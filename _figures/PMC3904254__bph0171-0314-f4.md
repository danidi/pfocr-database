caption: 'Schematic representation of possible orexinergic mechanisms in synaptic
  signalling. (A) Postsynaptic orexin signalling mechanisms. Ion fluxes are not shown.
  The PLC pathway may be active as suggested by some PKC-dependent effects as well
  as release of the endocannabinoid 2-AG, although there is little direct evidence
  for IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from ER in neurons. Inhibition of leak/inward rectifier/voltage-gated
  K+ channels (2P/Kir/Kv) (‘KC’) at least sometimes utilizes the Gq−PLCβ−PKC pathway.
  PKC could also be involved in the activation of NCX, but NCX may also act passively,
  driven by Ca2+ elevation (influx or release from ER; forward mode) or Na+ elevation
  (reverse mode). There also is some evidence for PKC-dependent activation of postsynaptic
  L-type VGCCs. The putative role of PIP2 is not depicted in the figure: PIP2 is required
  by NCX, some K+ and other channels, and PLD and cPLAα, and thus hydrolysis of PIP2
  (by PLC) would lead to inhibition of these while elevated PIP2 (via, e.g. the PLD
  pathway) would stimulate these. Different NSCCs may be positively or negatively
  regulated by PIP2. (B) Presynaptic orexinergic modulation of glutamate- or GABAergic
  terminal signalling by orexinergic enhancement of VGCC-mediated Ca2+ influx. Indirect
  evidence suggests that orexin stimulation may be able to trigger transmitter release
  by depolarization or other means (depicted as NSCC, although not directly identified
  in this response).'
