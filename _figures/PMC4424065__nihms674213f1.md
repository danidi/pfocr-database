caption: HLA crosslinking by antibodies of any subclass causes intracellular signaling
  leading to endothelial cell (EC) activation. Activated ECs express P-selectin, which
  promotes recruitment of leukocytes via interactions with PSGL-1. Recruited monocytes
  differentiate into CD68+ macrophages, which can be detected histologically in the
  capillaries and subendothelial space. Crosslinking of HLA molecules also enhances
  EC immunogenicity to recipient CD4 T cells, which proliferate and differentiate
  in response to alloantigen HLA class II. Complement activating antibodies trigger
  the classical pathway through binding of C1q, resulting in production of anaphylatoxins
  C3a and C5a, which have the potential to directly augment leukocyte recruitment
  and T cell alloresponses. Complement activation can be detected by immunohistochemical
  staining for C4d. Monocytes, neutrophils and NK cells also express FcγRs, which
  can interact with the heavy chain of HLA antibodies bound to donor ECs. FcγR functions
  augment leukocyte recruitment, and mediate phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular
  cytotoxicity. Taken together, the pleiotropic functions of HLA antibodies on the
  allograft ECs cause microvascular inflammation characteristic of antibody-mediated
  rejection. Antibodies in the figure with the same coloration of the Fc region are
  of the same subclass, whereas the varied colors within the F(ab′)2 denote unique
  antigenic specificities.
