caption: Moco pathway and proposed functions of MoaA and MoaC. (A) Overview of the
  Moco biosynthetic pathway. The symbols on GTP and cPMP indicate the source of the
  carbon and nitrogen atoms in cPMP as determined by isotope labeling studies–. (B
  and C) Previously proposed functions of MoaA and MoaC with a single step mechanism
  (B) and stepwise mechanism– (C). (D) Our proposal using 3′,8-cH2GTP as the product
  of MoaA and substrate for MoaC.
