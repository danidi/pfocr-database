caption: p110δ PI3K mediates the effects of CSF-1 or EGF via RhoA and PTEN in macrophages
  and some solid tumor cells. Activation of p110δ leads to increased activity of p190RhoGAP
  (through PYK2/Src activation) and to cytoplasmic accumulation of p27 (which is mediated
  by the increased Akt activity). p190RhoGAP induces the inactivation of RhoA whereas
  p27 prevents the activation of RhoA both thus leading to reduced RhoA activity and
  consequently to decreased PTEN activity. Inactivation of p110δ by IC87114 reverses
  these pathways leading to PTEN activation which then opposes the PI3K reaction of
  the remaining active p110 isoforms. The p190RhoGAP-driven mechanism almost solely
  keeps RhoA activity low under basal whereas that of p27 contributes upon stimulated
  conditions. Arrows with dashed lines represent alterations in activity or location
  in the presence (red) or in the absence (black) of IC87114.
