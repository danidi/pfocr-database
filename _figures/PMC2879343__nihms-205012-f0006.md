caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway to GV and shunt pathways to GE and defuco-GV
  after inactivation of GilOIII and GilGT, respectively. Homo-UWM6 and structures
  labeled with one letter (W–Z) are proposed main pathway intermediates; Y’ is a proposed
  shunt pathway intermediate. All other compounds are fully characterized intermediates
  or shunt products. Defuco-GE branches off from Y’ (not shown).
