caption: Novel concepts of tumor microenvironment-targeted therapies or immunotherapies
  (1) Tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) represent a highly abundant cell
  type in BrM with known roles in mediating tumor cell BBB transmigration and tumor-supportive
  functions that foster metastatic outgrowth. Strategies for TAM-targeted therapies
  include the reduction of tumor cell BBB transmigration (e.g., by Wnt antagonists,
  protease inhibitors, or blockade of chemokines/chemokine receptors). Blockade of
  CSF1-CSF1R signaling represents another strategy to target TAMs by inhibiting a
  central pathway for macrophage differentiation and survival. The CSF1-CSF1R signaling
  axis can be inhibited by (i) CSF1 blocking antibodies (with no effects on IL34 mediated
  CSF1R activation), (ii) CSF1R blocking antibodies, or (iii) ATP competitive small
  molecule inhibitors. Consequences of CSF1R inhibition on TAMs in established BrM
  (depletion vs. re-education) remain to be elucidated. An alternative strategy might
  be the inhibition of Pi3K by BKM130 to prevent the activation of pro-tumor TAMs.
  (2) Tumor-infiltrating T cells in BrM show signs of T cell exhaustion mediated by
  immune checkpoints (e.g., PD1-PDL1) or immune-suppressive cytokine milieus. Blockade
  of immune checkpoints e.g., by anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 reactivates T cells and reinstates
  tumor cell killing by cytotoxic T cells. (3) Astrocytes represent a highly plastic
  cell type in BrM and their function was associated with pro- and anti-tumor activity.
  Inhibition of serpins could re-activate sFasL-mediated tumor cell killing and thereby
  prevent early metastatic colonization. Blockade of gap junctions by meclofenamate
  or tonabersat was shown to inhibit tumor cell-astrocyte crosstalk that supports
  proliferation and protects tumor cells from chemotherapy. Targeting of STAT3+ astrocytes
  by silibinin represents a strategy to block the induction of pro-proliferative functions
  of TAMs and reduce astrocyte-mediated inactivation of T cells. (4) Brain metastatic
  tumor cells adopt neuronal features to integrate into the neuro-glial niche and
  to exploit brain specific energy sources e.g., glutamate (Gln). GABA antagonists
  were shown to reduce GABAergic signaling in tumor cells. Furthermore, blockade of
  Gln influx into tumor cells by GAD1 inhibition could represent a promising therapeutic
  strategy.
