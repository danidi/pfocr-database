caption: 'Restriction factors block multiple stages in the influenza virus life cycle.
  (A) Virus attachment and entry. The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) attaches
  to host cell receptors that contain terminal α2,6-linked or α2-3-linked sialic acid
  moieties, and the virus enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Cleavage
  of HA by cellular proteases is required to expose the HA peptide that is responsible
  for the fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane. Acidification
  of the endocytic vesicle opens the M2 ion channel, resulting in acidification of
  the inside of the virion, a process that is required for proper uncoating of the
  viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes that contain the viral genome. Acidification
  of the endosome also triggers the pH-dependent fusion step that is mediated by the
  HA and results in the cytoplasmic release of the vRNP complexes; (B) Genomic transcription
  and replication. vRNPs translocate to the nucleus, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
  transcribes and replicates the negative-sense viral RNA ((−)vRNA), giving rise to:
  (i) complementary positive-sense RNA ((+)cRNA), which is used as a template to generate
  more vRNA; and (ii) viral mRNAs, which are exported to the cytoplasm for translation;
  (C) Virus assembly and budding. Viral proteins that are needed in replication and
  transcription are translocated back to the nucleus, and progeny vRNPs are then exported
  to the cytoplasm for packaging. Viral HA, NA and M2 are transported by the trans-Golgi
  secretory pathway to the plasma membrane, where M1 assists in the formation of mature
  virus particles. Virions then bud from the surface of infected cells and are released
  by the enzymatic activity of the viral neuraminidase (NA), which cleaves sialic
  acid from cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. Examples of cellular restriction
  factors with known antiviral activity against influenza viruses are shown in orange.'
