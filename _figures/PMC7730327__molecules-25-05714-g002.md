caption: TAp63α acts as the central integrator for DNA damage signaling in oocytes.
  Detection of either double-strand breaks or single-strand breaks activates the ATM/CHK2
  or the ATR/CHK1 pathway, respectively. Phosphorylation of TAp63α on S582 by CHK2
  or CHK1 recruits a second kinase, CK1, which adds four more phosphates. This leads
  to opening of the closed dimeric state. In its active tetrameric conformation, TAp63α
  acts as a transcriptional activator resulting in the expression of PUMA and NOXA
  which, in turn, activate Bax.
