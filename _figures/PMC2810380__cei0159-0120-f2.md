caption: The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription/suppressor
  of cytokine signalling (JAK/STAT/SOCS) axis. Cytokine engagement of their cognate
  receptors (a) leads to receptor dimerization, which activates JAK kinases. Activated
  JAKs phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor (b), creating docking sites
  for Src-homology-2 (SH2)-domain-containing proteins such as STATs (c). Docked STATs
  are activated by JAKs, dissociate from the receptor and dimerize (d). Dimerized
  STATs migrate to the nucleus and associate with specific STAT binding sites (e)
  and (positively or negatively) regulate expression of STAT-responsive genes, including
  suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins. SOCS proteins also contain an
  SH2-domain and feed back to inhibit this pathway through competition with STAT proteins
  for SH2-domain-docking sites (f), SH2-recruitment to the receptor cytoplasmic domain
  followed by JAK inhibition (g) or direct inhibition of JAK activity (h). In addition,
  SOCS proteins contain a SOCS box motif which contains an E3 ubiquitin–ligase complex,
  through which the SOCS protein can ubiquitinate JAK proteins and target them for
  proteosomal degradation (i).
