caption: (a) Direct interlink was found between GOGAT and Mal-2OG transporter. 8.5
  unit of 2OG always entered into the chloroplast by the Mal2OG transporter and same
  unit of 2OG is consumed in GOGAT. The flux through GOGAT is also 8.5 throughout.
  Flux values marked in blue are the ones that were found to be same throughout the
  simulation under Rubisco carboxylase activity. When the flux through the chloroplastic
  ammonia transporter (ex_ammonia_tx) was set to zero (flux values marked in black
  under this condition) then 4.0 unit of flux passed through the cytosolic ammonia
  transporter (NH3_tx), chloroplastic Glu-Gln shuttle and the cytosolic GS. Further,
  when the flux through the chloroplastic ammonia transporter was increased by 1.0
  unit (flux values marked in orange under this condition) consequently the flux through
  cytosolic ammonia transporter, chloroplastic Glu-Gln shuttle and the cytosolic GS
  decreased by 1.0 unit. The increase in the chloroplastic ammonia by 1.0 unit also
  increased the flux through the GS2 by 1.0 unit. The results indicated that the activity
  of chloroplastic Glu-Gln transporter and source of chloroplastic ammonia was coupled.
  (b) As the activity of the chlroplastic ammonia transporter was increased the flux
  through the NH3_tx, cytosolic GS and chloroplastic Glu-Gln shuttle decreased. Thus,
  when chloroplastic ammonia transporter was fixed at 4.0 unit (flux values marked
  in pink under this condition) the NH3_tx, Glu-Gln transporter and cytosolic GS carried
  zero flux. The total chloroplastic ammonia in this case was 8.5 unit and was consumed
  in the GS2. Metabolites. Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate; Mal, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  CIT, citrate; 2OG, Oxoglutarate, Gly, glycine; Ser, serine; Pyr, pyruvate. Enzymes.
