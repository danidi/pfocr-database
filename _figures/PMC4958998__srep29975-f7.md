caption: In vascular restenosis, the functional balance of calpastatin and calpains
  was disturbed, leading to the activation of MMP2/TGF-β1 signalling. It is well known
  that the MMP2/TGF-β1 pathway is closely related to the proliferation and migration
  of VSMCs and collagen synthesis. Using TG mice, specific siRNAs against calpain-1/2,
  AdMMP2, and simvastatin, we revealed that calpastatin induction and calpains inhibition
  suppress the expression of MMP2/TGF-β1, subsequently preventing the proliferation
  and migration of VSMCs and collagen synthesis, finally attenuating vascular restenosis.
  Most importantly, calpain-1 is the major molecule in the development of vascular
  restenosis by influencing all aspects. In contrast, calpain-2 only played an auxiliary
  role in restenosis processes by enhancing VSMC migration. Moreover, simvastatin
  may inhibit the expression of calpain-1/2 by accelerating HIF-1α degradation to
  attenuate vascular restenosis. TG, calpastatin transgene; VSMCs, vascular smooth
