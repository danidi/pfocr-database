caption: Terpenoid metabolism in engineered tobacco trichomes for triterpene production
  in the cytosol. The gray pathway represents the normal biosynthetic route for triterpenes
  and sterols. The enzymes are targeted to the cytosol to enhance the cross talk and
  sink the plastids from its precursors. Overexpressed enzymes are denoted in dark
  blue. New products deriving from the engineering metabolism are denoted in light
  blue. CYP450, Cytochrome P450; FDS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; FPP, farnesyl
  diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; OSC, 2,3-oxidosqualene
  cyclase; SQE, squalene epoxidase; SQS, squalene synthase.
