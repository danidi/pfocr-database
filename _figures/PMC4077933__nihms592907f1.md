caption: Pathways of isoprenoid biosynthesis and utilization in Bacillus subtilis.
  Isopentenyl diphosphate is synthesized via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP)
  pathway (). UppS adds eight consecutive isopentenyl diphosphate groups to the C15
  farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to generate undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP=C55-PP),
  a key intermediate in the synthesis of cell wall components (). The heterodimeric
  enzyme HepST also functions as a prenyltransferase and adds four isoprenyl units
  in head-to-tail condensation with FPP to generate the C35 intermediate, heptaprenyl
  diphosphate (C35-PP) (). The C35-PP intermediate is a substrate for YtpB, catalyzing
  the committed step in the synthesis of sesquarterpenes (). The sesquarterpene shown
  has recently been named baciterpenol A (). C35-PP is also a substrate for MenA,
  a central enzyme of the menaquinone-7 biosynthesis pathway (). Depending on the
  growth conditions, MenA activity can be limited by the availability of the co-substrate
  1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) (see text for details), a metabolite derived
  from the central branch point intermediate chorismate.
