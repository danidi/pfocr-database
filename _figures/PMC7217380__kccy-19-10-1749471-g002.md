caption: PPI network and module analysis of HCC. (a) PPI network of all DEGs via the
  information of the STRING protein query with a maximum number of interactors ≤ 5,
  confidence score ≥ 0.4 which consists of 88 nodes and 112 edges based on STRING
  database. The top 10 DEGs with high degree of connectivity were selected as the
  hub genes of HCC. (b-d) PPI networks of Module 1–3. The top three gene modules were
  significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, mineral absorption, and cell cycle,
  respectively.
