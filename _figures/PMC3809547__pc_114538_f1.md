caption: Scheme of Carotenoid Biosynthetic Pathway in P. patens.The genes identified
  in this study, lycopene b-cyclase (LCYB), lycopene ε-cyclase (LCYE), β-hydroxylase
  (CYP97A3. CHY), ε-hydroxylase (CYP97C1), ZEP, VDE, and the putative NSY, are indicated.
  The reaction of neoxanthin synthase is indicated by a question mark (NSY1?; NSY2?)
  because its catalytic activity has not yet been verified in vitro (). Unknown genes
  could participate to β-hydroxylase activity and are here indicated by two question
  marks (??). The dashed box includes the xanthophyll cycle.
