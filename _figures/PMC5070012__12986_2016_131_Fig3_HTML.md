caption: 'Metabolic pathway of U87 cells profiling data. A combined metabolic pathway
  is presented, including glycolysis, the pentose-phosphate pathway, the TCA cycle
  and branched chain amino acid degradation. Intracellular metabolite abundances (Fig. )
  are shown as bar diagrams depicting the relative abundance which is the: ratio between
  the abundance of a metabolite (the peak area) normalized to total protein (μg) compared
  to the abundance at 25 mM glucose (normalized to protein) set as 1. Direct reactions
  without intermediates are presented as straight lines and reactions involving several
  steps are presented as dotted lines. Metabolites which were not determined are labeled
  in Grey. All experiments have been conducted in 6-tuplicate and statistical significance
  was determined by Student’s t-test with: *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.005; ***: p < 0.0005.
  An extended version of the figure including extracellular metabolite concentrations
  is available in the (Additional file : Figure S2). Abbreviations: GA3P: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Glu: glutamate; aKG: α-ketoglutarate'
