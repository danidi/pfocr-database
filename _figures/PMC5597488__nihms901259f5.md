caption: VTA-NAc mesolimbic pathway is the major “reward pathway” in the brain. Dopaminergic
  dysregulation in this pathway is implicated in palatable food associated reward
  and binge eating [, ]. A reduced Drd2 expression in the NAc, and a trend for increase
  in the VTA TH expression was associated with binge eating prone rats. Intact reversal
  learning is important for establishing adaptive responses or flexibility to altered
  contingencies []. Serotonin and dopamine systems in the OFC seems to be crucial
  in maintaining reversal learning behavior [, ]. We speculate that an increase in
  5-HT2C expression, and decrease in Drd1 and Drd4 expression in the OFC region may
  have, at least in part, impaired spatial reversal learning in BEP rats. Furthermore,
  the interactions between the cortical-hippocampal regions are essential for intact
  cognitive performances [, ]. Bdnf-TrkB signaling disruption was observed in the
  HPC-PFC axis of BEP rats. Specifically, reduced TrkB and IR expression in the CA3
  region of HPC were correlated with the impaired performance on novel object recognition
  task. Thus, alterations in expression of the genes regulating reward and cognition
  were accompanied with the impaired cognitive phenotype of shortening bingeing rats.
