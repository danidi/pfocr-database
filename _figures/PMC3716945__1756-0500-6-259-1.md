caption: 'Pathway of transsulfuration and methionine synthesis in Neurospora crassa.
  Cystathionine β-lyase, encoded by the met-2+ gene, is shown in its role in the conversion
  of cystathionine to homocysteine. Cystathionine γ-lyase (encoded by cys-16+), which
  converts cystathionine to cysteine, has been characterized previously []. Abbreviations:
  SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine.'
