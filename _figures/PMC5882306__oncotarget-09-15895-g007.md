caption: '1. Induction of cell stress (red arrows): Imiquimod enters the cell and
  disrupts oxidative phosphorylation at the mitochondria via a TLR7-independent mechanism.
  ROS is produced and shuttles between the ER and mitochondria to disrupt cellular
  homeostasis and activate the UPR. Ca2+ is depleted from the ER upon activation of
  ER stress, and is taken up by the mitochondria where it further disrupts oxidative
  phosphorylation in a stress-induced cycle. 2. Attenuation of protein translation
  and cell cycle arrest (orange arrows): PERK is activated by the UPR and phosphorylates
  EIF2a, resulting in attenuation of regular protein translation and suppression of
  oncogenic pathways. EIF2a induces cell cycle arrest through preferential translation
  of cyclin inhibitors such as p21CIP1. 3. Activation of autophagy (green arrows):
  PERK stimulates the expression of genes required for stress responses via ATF4,
  including autophagic genes. IRE1 is activated via the UPR and stimulates JNK via
  ASK1. Increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ activates m-calpain, which further stimulates JNK
  activity via ASK1. JNK phosphorylates BCL2, resulting in its dissociation from beclin-1,
  and allowing beclin-1 to induce autophagy. 4. Inhibition of apoptosis (blue arrows):
  Activation of autophagy inhibits apoptosis, in part through the release of BCL2.
  BCL2 inhibits the XIAP inhibitor DIABLO and cytochrome C release. DFTD cells survive
  in this state for up to 72 h. 5. Activation of apoptosis (purple arrows): Prolonged
  cell stress induces the expression of pro-apoptotic CHOP via the PERK-ATF4 axis.
  JNK activates pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family such as BIM. CHOP, JNK and
  BIM cooperated to inhibit anti-apoptotic molecules including BCL2. Inhibition of
  BCL2 activates DIABLO, which inhibits anti-apoptotic XIAP. Cytochrome C is released
  from the mitochondria, and stimulates the caspase cascade. M-calpain supports the
  activation of this pathway through cleavage of caspase 12. ENDOG is also released
  from the mitochondria in response to prolonged oxidative stress and promotes DNA
  degradation in a caspase-independent manner. DFTD cells undergo apoptosis.'
