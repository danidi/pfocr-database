caption: Under low actin tension, STXBP4 assembles a protein complex comprising α‐catenin,
  AMOT, LATS, and YAP to promote YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention. When
  actin cytoskeleton tension increases, the STXBP4‐centered protein complex is dissembled,
  resulting in YAP's dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation as well as the subsequent
  cancer development.
