caption: Antiviral innate immunity, interactions with viral suppressors and bacterial
  PTI (1). Under normal, resting conditions, NSP-interacting kinase 1 (NIK1) is bound
  to the flagellin receptor FLS2 (Flagellin-sensitive 2) and coreceptor BAK1 (Brassinosteroid
  insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1) to prevent autoimmunity. (2) Upon bacterial
  infection, the bacterial PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern) flg22 is sensed
  by FLS2, inducing its oligomerization with BAK1, which results in phosphorylation-mediated
  activation of the immune complex to initiate PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), activating
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and inducing defense genes.
  (3) Activated BAK1 also phosphorylates NIK1 at Thr-474, which in turn inhibits further
  PTI (4) and activates the NIK1-mediated antiviral signaling pathway, mediating ribosomal
  protein 10 (RPL10) phosphorylation. (5) Phosphorylated RPL10 is translocated to
  the nucleus, where it interacts with L10-interacting Myb domain-containing protein
  (LIMYB) to repress protein ribosomal (RB) genes and translational factors, suppressing
  global translation. (6) In infected cells, the geminivirus particles are disassembled
  in the cytoplasm and the CP-viral ssDNA complex is directed to the nucleus where
  (7) the viral ssDNA is converted into dsDNA for replication and transcription of
  the viral genome. (8) Begomoviruses-derived nucleic acids also function as viral
  PAMPs inducing NIK1 dimerization with itself or an unidentified viral PAMP recognition
  receptor (PRR) to transduce the antiviral signal that culminates in translational
  suppression. Then, viral mRNA is not efficiently translated impairing infection.
  (9) The begomovirus nuclear shuttling protein (NSP) counters the activation of this
  defense pathway by binding to the NIK1 kinase domain and, hence, prevents phosphorylation
  and transduction of the antiviral signal that otherwise would impair infection.
  (10) In resistant genotypes, NSP may also function as an avirulence (AVR) factor
  to activate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) via resistance (R) protein recognition,
  inducing hypersensitive response (HR) and cell death. (11) The PTI and ETI products
  (ROS, SA, JA, NO, H2O2) can induce defense genes and systemic acquired resistance
  (SAR). Geminivirus suppressors of innate immunity include (12) C4 that inhibits
  PTI by interacting and inhibiting FLS2 and along with Rep inhibits SA- and ROS-dependent
  signaling; C4 and C2 inhibit HR and cell death. (13) Furthermore, the betasatellite
  βC1 inhibits the MAP kinase cascade. The question marks indicate either events not
  well clarified or unknown. See  for the designations of the viral proteins. The
