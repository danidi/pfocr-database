caption: Paracrine stromal–epithelial interactions for progesterone and retinoid action
  in endometrium and endometriosis. Deficient genes and pathways in endometriosis
  are indicated by arrows and dotted lines. Blood vessels deliver progesterone (P4)
  to endometrial stromal cells, which express PR; activation leads to the production
  of paracrine factors, including RA. RA acts in a paracrine manner to stimulate differentiation
  and oppose estradiol (E2)-dependent proliferation in endometrial epithelial cells.
  Moreover, RA stimulates HSD17B2, which converts biologically active E2 to estrogenically
  weak estrone (E1). Endometriotic stromal cells express lower levels of PR, which
  leads to lower RA formation. As a result, paracrine signaling to neighboring epithelial
  cells is lost, and these cells do not differentiate or express HSD17B2, leading
  to excess E2. The mechanisms supporting retinoid transport between endometrial stromal
  and epithelial cells are not fully understood. The retinoid cell surface receptor
  stimulated by RA-6 (STRA6) in endometrial stromal cells binds retinol binding protein
  (RBP)–bound retinol in the circulation for cellular uptake of retinol. Retinol is
  converted to RA and transported to nuclear RARs by the shuttling protein cellular
  RA binding protein-2 (CRABP2). RA-bound RAR stimulates endometrial stromal cell
  differentiation and apoptosis. PR induces stromal STRA6 and CRABP2 expression. In
  endometriosis, this pathway is disrupted by a deficiency of PR, STRA6, and CRABP2
  as abnormal expression of the RA-metabolizing enzymes CYP26B1 and CYP26A1 in stromal
  and epithelial endometrial cells. 4OH-RA, 4-hydroxy-RA. [Reproduced from Kim JJ,
