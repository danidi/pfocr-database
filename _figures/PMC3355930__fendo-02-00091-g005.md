caption: Prostaglandin E2 acts as a gliotransmitter to stimulate GnRH neuron electrical
  activity. Neuronally released glutamate (Glu) (1) co-activates metabotropic glutamatergic
  (mGluR) and AMPA glutamatergic receptors (GluR) in astrocytes (2), stimulating the
  activity of zinc-dependent matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) of the ADAM (a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase) family (3). The MMPs catalyze ectodomain shedding of the
  pro-EGF ligands pro-TGFα and pro-NRG (pro-neuregulin). In particular, the processing
  of pro-TGFα has been shown to involve the metalloproteinase ADAM17, also known as
  tumor necrosis factor α converting enzyme (TACE). The subsequently released mature
  TGFα and NRG activate erbB1/erbB2 and erbB4/erbB2 heterodimers, respectively (Dziedzic
  et al., ). The co-activation of glutamatergic receptors induces the recruitment
  of erbB1, erbB4, and their pro-ligands to the cell membrane, where multiprotein
  complexes form, as demonstrated by the direct physical association of glutamatergic
  and erbB receptors (not shown). The activation of erbB receptors in hypothalamic
  astrocytes promotes profound morphological changes, including the retraction of
  cytoplasm, stellation of cells and the elongation of processes (see Figure G–I)
  (4′). The activation of erbB receptors also promotes the release of PGE2 (Ma et
  al., , ; Dziedzic et al., ) (4), which stimulates a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)
  pathway in GnRH neurons through the mobilization of EP2 receptors (EP2; Clasadonte
  et al., ) (5). Activation of this signaling pathway induces a reversible membrane
  depolarization of GnRH neurons leading to the initiation of spike firing via a postsynaptic
  effect involving the activation of a non-selective cation current (Clasadonte et
  al., ) (6).
