caption: General carotenoid metabolic pathway in horticultural crops. PSY catalyzes
  the first committed condensation step from GGPP to produce the first C40 carotene,
  phytoene. Following several desaturation and isomerization steps, lycopene is produced.
  The next cyclization yields the α-carotene and β-carotene branches. A wide range
  of carotenoids are degraded by CCDs or NCEDs to produce apocarotenoids. IPP, isopentenyl
  diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate;
  IPI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; GGPPS, GGPP synthase; PSY, phytoene synthase;
  PDS, phytoene desaturase; Z-ISO, ζ-carotene isomerase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase;
  CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase; LCYE, lycopene ε-cyclase; LCYB, lycopene β-cyclase;
  CHYB, β-carotene hydroxylase; CYP97C, cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase 97C; ZEP,
  zeaxanthin epoxidase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; CCS, capsanthin-capsorubin
  synthase; NXS, neoxanthin synthase; CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; NCED,
  9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase. Metabolites are bolded and colored according
  to their compound colors, whereas black indicates no color. Enzymes and regulators
  are not bolded. Solid arrows indicate biosynthesis and dashed arrows indicate degradation
  PSY regulators are colored in blue. Dotted rectangles separate different groups
  of carotenoids.
