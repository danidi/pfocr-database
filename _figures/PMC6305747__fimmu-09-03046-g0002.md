caption: 'Pentraxins-expanded network of complement activation and regulation. Classical
  pathway (CP) activation mainly occurs by immune complexes, but also mediated through
  antibody-like features of the pentraxins in complex with C1q. In addition to the
  traditional activating fashion as depicted above, lectin pathway (LP) is also indirectly
  activated by PTX3, CRP, or SAP upon recruitment of MBL or the ficolins. Cross-activation
  of the CP and LP initiates when heterocomplexes are created on target surfaces between
  PTX3 (or CRP) and MBL (or ficolin-2) and C1q. Two additional activation pathways
  emerge to boost complement amplification. The amplification pathways comprise the
  avenue open to the sequence below: target → PTX3 (or CRP) → ficolin-2/MASPs → C4
  → C3 → formation of membrane attach complex (MAC) (amplification 1); target → MBL
  (or ficolin-2/MASPs) → PTX3 (or CRP) → C1q → C4 → C3 → formation of MAC (amplification
  2) (). Alternative pathway (AP) activation often occurs independently regardless
  of trigger by spontaneous C3 activation in solution, and rapidly propels nascent
  C3b binding to nearby target surfaces covalently. In addition, it is hypothesized
  that surface-bound collectin-12 (CL-12) mediates CP activation by crosstalk with
  PTX3, CRP or SAP. A recent emerging activation avenue follows relatively specific
  sequence that involves pattern recognition and opsonization by soluble CL-12 → recruitment
  of properdin → de novo C3 convertase assembly → C3 amplification loop → generation
  of downstream effector molecules → induction of immune signaling (). Despite its
  diverse avenues, overarching concept of complement activation focuses on sensing
  and eliminating potential danger signals through immunesurveillance and immune effector
  mechanisms. The pentraxins recognize major fluid-phase complement regulators, C4BP
  and fH, resulting in down-regulation of complement-mediated inflammation.'
