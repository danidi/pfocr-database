caption: Role of the circadian clock in integration of abiotic stress signals. The
  white and shaded rectangles illustrate the day and night intervals of the circadian
  cycle. Oscillator components are listed within these boxes and their position in
  the rectangles gives an indication of the timing of their expression relative to
  each other and to dawn and dusk. The top part of the diagram illustrates the effects
  of different types of abiotic stress on expression of the clock genes. The bottom
  part of the diagram shows the effects of oscillator components on abiotic stress
  response pathways. Genes are indicated in boxes and hormones in ovals. Solid blunt
  and pointed arrows indicate transcriptional activation and repression, respectively.
  Dotted lines indicate induction of alternative splicing. Dashed lines indicate regulation
  of hormonal pathways. These lines have no sign because regulation of opposite sign
  may occur at different levels of the hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathway
  and the net effect of this regulation is not known.
