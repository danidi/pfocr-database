caption: (A) Functional network of proteins in stage 2 breast cancer samples, (confidence
  level = 0.150). (B) Molecular pathway of proteins as predicted by STRING. Schematic
  representation of potential protein-protein interactions. This is predicted directly
  by DAVID, each ellipse represents a protein, and the representation suggests the
  interaction pathway. In this case, MOB1A interacts independently with FKBP9 and
  FKBP10.
