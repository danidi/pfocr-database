caption: Model of Gata4 transcriptional regulation in atrial septation. Gata4 acts
  upstream of both Hh signaling and the Pten/Cdk4/Cyclin D2 pathways. These pathways
  appear to be independent, and rescue of either pathway prevents CHDs in Gata4 heterozygote
  knockouts, supporting a model in which combined deficiency of both pathways is required
  for CHD pathogenesis.
