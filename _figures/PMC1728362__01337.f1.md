caption: Potential strategies to hamper lymphoaccumulation by targeting defective
  T cell apoptosis in animal models of Crohn's disease. (A) Interleukin 12 (IL-12),
  produced by macrophages (M) in response to putative environmental factors, promotes
  differentiation of Th1 cells, which in turn upregulate macrophage IL-12 synthesis
  by releasing interferon γ (IFN-γ). Antibodies to IL-12 exert their therapeutic properties
  by reinduction of T cell apoptosis. (B) Soluble receptor of interleukin 6 (sIL-6R),
  released by macrophages, may complex with IL-6 and stimulate gp130 on the T cell
  surface, leading to a STAT-3 dependent cascade of antiapoptotic genes (Bcl-2 and
  Bcl-xL) and then to apoptosis resistance. Antibodies to IL-6R prevent this antiapoptotic
  pathway. (C) Tolerance induction following oral antigen administration may result
  in T cell production of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) which mediates apoptotic
  deletion of T cells thus avoiding lymphoaccumulation.
