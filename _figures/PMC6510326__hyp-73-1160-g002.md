caption: 'Synthesis, activation, secretion, and downstream actions of MGP (matrix
  Gla protein). Endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells express MGP. Step 1:
  After translation in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), vitamin K activates MGP by
  stimulating γ-carboxylation. Step 2: dp-cMGP (desphospho-carboxylated MGP) can sequester
  intracellular calcium, thereby providing protection against injury caused by calcium
  deposition. Step 3: A Golgi-associated casein kinase phosphorylates the serine residues
  of dp-cMGP to p-cMGP (phosphorylated-carboxylated MGP), thereby facilitating secretion.
  Step 4: p-cMGP is secreted into the extracellular matrix or the circulation to inhibit
  soft tissue calcification, VSMC (vascular smooth muscle cell) trans-differentiation
  into OPC (osteochondrogenic progenitor cells) and signaling via the BMP (bone morphogenetic
  protein) pathway. Step 5: Inactive dp-ucMGP (desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP), a biomarker
  reflecting poor vitamin K status, escapes from cells into the blood stream but does
  not inhibit calcification. Copyright © 2018, Wei et al. This is an open access article
