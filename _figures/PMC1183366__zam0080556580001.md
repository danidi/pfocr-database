caption: Metabolic pathways for monomers derived from nonrelated and related carbon
  sources. (A) Production of SCL and MCL monomers from fatty acid biosynthesis via
  the overproduction of genetically engineered FabH proteins and PHA synthase. 1.
  Fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. 2. FabH catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-ACP
  and acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-ACP. 3 and 4. FabH mediates the transacylase
  reaction. 5. PhaC catalyzes the PHA polymerization reaction. (B) The production
  of SCL and MCL monomers from the β-oxidation pathway. 1. The β-oxidation pathway
  of E. coli. 2. PhaJ catalyzes the conversion of enoyl-CoA to (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA.
  3. FabG catalyzes the reduction of 3-ketoacyl-CoA to (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. 4. PhaC
  catalyzes the PHA polymerization reaction.
