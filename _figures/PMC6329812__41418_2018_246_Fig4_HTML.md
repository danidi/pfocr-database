caption: A schematic view of therapeutic opportunities targeting mutp53 and the homeostatic
  mechanisms it coordinates in cancer cells. Cancer cell addiction to mutp53-dependent
  stress support mechanisms can be exploited for therapeutic purposes by implementing
  pharmacologic strategies aimed at disrupting the balance of pro- and anti-survival
  signaling, in combination with molecules that directly target mutp53 and/or the
  mechanisms leading to its cancer-specific activation. PRIMA-1 is paradigmatic of
  small molecule compounds restoring mutp53 to its wild-type conformation and leading
  to its degradation. Destabilization of mutp53 by inhibition of the Heat-shock protein
  (Hsp) chaperone machinery can be obtained by different compounds, including inhibitors
  of Hsp90-Hsp40 and HDAC inhibitors (SAHA). Molecules inhibiting different steps
  of the Mevalonate-RhoA axis, including statins, Zoledronic Acid (ZA) and geranylgeranyl-transferase
  inhibitors (GGTI) can indirectly block Hsp90 activation and mutp53 stabilization,
  also blunting other oncogenic effects of this metabolic axis. Similarly, Pin1 inhibitors
  such as ATRA/ATO and KPT-6566 prevent mutp53 oncogenic activation in tumor cells.
  Metformin could block glucose-dependent mutp53 stabilization, and mTOR inibitors
  such as Everolimus curb tumor cell survival. Therapeutic approaches can be aimed
  to inhibit the stress support pathways sustained by mutp53 (sensitization), or to
  exacerbate stress conditions to overcome stress support pathways (stress overload).
  E.g. proteasome inhibitors blunt a major proteotoxic stress response pathway; inhibitors
  of the thioredoxin system (e.g. Auranofin) block antioxidant mechanisms; DDR kinase
  inhibitors and PARP inhibitors prevent responses to genotoxic stress; PRIMA-1 and
  the Pin1 inhibitor KPT-6566 increase ROS levels in cancer cells
