caption: Schematic Overview of Pyrimidine de Novo Synthesis, Salvage, and Degradation.Nucleotides
  synthesized de novo enter the nucleotide pool and become further converted to nucleic
  acids and other metabolic intermediates. Breakdown of nucleotides to uridine and
  uracil may lead to complete degradation or the resynthesis of UMP in the salvage
  pathway. Increasing the activity of URH in overexpressor mutants leads to marked
  stimulation of pyrimidine degradation but not of salvage pathway activity or de
  novo synthesis. This is illustrated by the insensitivity of mutants with enhanced
  URH activity toward 5-FO, 5-FD, and 5-FU. 1, Carbamoyl phosphate synthase (CPSase);
  2, Asp transcarbamoylase (ATCase); 3, dihydroorotase (DHOase); 4, dihydroorotate
  dehydrogenase (DHODH); 5, UMP-synthase (UMPSase); CP, carbamoyl phosphate; CA, carbamoyl
  aspartate; DHO, dihydro-orotate; OA, orotic acid.
