caption: 'The hippocampus regulates DA neuron responsivity based on context. (A) The
  ventral hippocampus (vHipp) activates the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to inhibit the
  ventral pallidum (VP), driving VTA DA neuron tonic population activity. Pedunculopontine
  tegmentum (PPTg) input acts on tonically active DA neurons to generate phasic bursts
  of firing: this constitute the behaviorally salient rapid DA response. (B) If an
  organism is in a benign context where rapid reactions are not necessary, the number
  of DA neurons firing is kept low and the PPTg will only activate phasic bursting
  in a small population of neurons. As a result, a salient stimulus will trigger a
  calm orienting response. (C) In contrast, if the organism is in a threatening environment,
  the vHipp-NAc-VP pathway causes a large population of DA neurons to be active, increasing
  vigilance to the environment. Now the same salient stimulus will cause a larger
  phasic response, driving the organism to rapidly orient to the stimulus to prepare
  an appropriate response. (D) In schizophrenia, DA neuron population activity is
  in a constant high-activity state. Hence, most of the stimuli the organism encounters
  will lead to maximal dopamine output, resulting in the attribution of strong behavioral
  importance to stimuli, even to stimuli that should be safely ignored.'
