caption: (A) Steady glutamate recycling. Glutamate cycling and MAS are stoichiometrically
  balanced. The two pools of intracellular glutamate (i.e. derived either from EAATs
  in astrocytes, PAG in neurons or cAAT in both cell types) might eventually undergo
  mixing. (B) Net glutamate synthesis. Pyruvate generated by glycolysis or glycogenolysis
  in astrocytes is transported inside mitochondria by monocarboxylate transporter
  (MCT). Pyruvate is then converted by PC to oxalacetate, whose carbons exit TCA cycle
  as AKG. Intramitochondrial AKG is exchanged with malate via oxoglutarate carrier
  (OGC). Subsequent countertransport of malate with phosphate through dicarboxylate
  carrier (DIC) ensures net AKG shuttle across mitochondria without net transfer of
  malate. Once in the cytosol, AKG is transaminated to glutamate by branched-chain
  aminotransferase (BCAT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALAT). Glutamate is aminated
  to glutamine by GS and exported to neurons. Dashed arrows show the alternative pathway
  requiring glutamate/hydroxyl carrier (GC). (C) Net glutamate oxidation. Cytosolic
  glutamate enters mitochondria via AGC1, though not directly, but after two transamination
  steps mediated by BCAT or ALAT and cAAT (the alternative pathway using GC is showed
  with dashed arrows). Carbons from intramitochondrially generated AKG exits TCA cycle
  as malate or oxalacetate, which are then converted to pyruvate. Transport of malate
  via dicarboxylate carrier (DIC) is required for net glutamate entry and exit to
  and from mitochondria (unless GC is operative, dashed arrows). Note that activity
  of mitochondrial GDH requires GC to balance stoichiometry.
