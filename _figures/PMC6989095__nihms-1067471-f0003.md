caption: Proteolytic regulation of lipid transfer proteins in yeast. When CL levels
  are low, Ups1/Mdm35 transfers PA across the IMS to be converted to CL by a multistep
  biosynthetic pathway. When CL levels are high, Ups1/Mdm35 is sequestered at the
  IM by CL and Ups1 is degraded by Yme1 and Atp23. These proteases also degrade uncomplexed
  Ups1. The dynamic association of Ups1/Mdm35 is important for PA transport, and it
  is unclear after how many rounds of lipid transfer Ups1 dissociates from Mdm35 and
  is degraded. Similarly, Ups2/Mdm35 transfers PS across the IMS to be converted to
  PE by Psd1. Uncomplexed Ups2 is also degraded by Yme1, and the number of lipid transfer
  events of which the complex is capable has also yet to be determined. CL sequestration
  of Ups1/Mdm35 at the IM has yet to be formally tested in vivo.
