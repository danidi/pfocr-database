caption: Interaction between two previously unlinked PRRs, CRP and ficolin suggests
  cross-activation of the classical and lectin-mediated complement pathways. The model
  shows that pathogen-bound CRP activates the classical pathway and cross-activates
  the lectin pathway via interaction with ficolin. Conversely, pathogen-bound ficolin,
  which activates the lectin pathway, may potentially activate the classical pathway
  via interaction with CRP. This ensures full activation of the complement armaments.
  The evolutionarily ancient status of CRP and CL5 (ficolin homologue) suggests that
  CRP:ficolin crosstalk represents part of an ancient complement activation pathway
  that is entrenched in the immune system of organisms that predated the divergence
  of the protostome and the deuterostome.
