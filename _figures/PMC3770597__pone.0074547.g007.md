caption: SIM treatment to SH-SY5Y cells promotes retention of cell surface cholesterol
  (CSC) which regulates cellular function by stabilizing lipid raft signaling and
  maintenance of neurite outgrowth. Simultaneously, depletion of cholesterol by SIM
  activates an intracellular phosphatase i.e. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) which
  inactivates AMPK by dephosphorylating at Thr 172. This is followed by activation
  of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) through dephosphorylation at Ser-79. New fatty acids
  get synthesized which act as precursors for neurites during elongation process.
