caption: Proposed model for the impact of targeted therapeutics, vemurafenib (PLX)
  and trametinib (TRA) on differentiated/pigmented phenotype of melanoma cells. (a)
  Drug-naïve melanoma cells show patient-related variability in MITF-M level and execution
  of differentiation/pigmentation program. This is reflected in the predominance of
  either dedifferentiated phenotype (high percentages of MITFlow cells, marked in
  green) or differentiated phenotype (high percentages of MITFhigh cells, marked in
  red). Acute exposure to vemurafenib or trametinib could lead to increased expression
  of pigmentation-related genes in MITF-Mhigh melanoma cell lines. Contrary to effects
  of acute treatment, acquired drug resistance developed by MITF-Mhigh cells was not
  unidirectional and was accompanied either with enhanced level of MITF-M and expression
  of pigmentation-related genes or opposite, with dedifferentiation process. This
  dedifferentiation process can be either reversible or irreversible as demonstrated
  by changes induced by drug removal (“drug holiday”) followed by reexposure to drugs.
  In this study, MC1RR151C  +/+ variant was harboured exclusively by irreversibly
  dedifferentiated MITF-Mlow melanomas, either drug-naïve or resistant to vemurafenib
  (both marked in green). (b) Simplified schematic illustration of the signalling
  pathway contributing to expression of pigmentation-related genes in melanoma. Receptor
  MC1R on melanocytes is activated by α-MSH mainly synthesized by keratinocytes in
  response to UV light, but on melanoma cells autocrine activation of MC1R can occur.
  Activated MC1R increases cAMP level causing activation of CREB, which is one of
  transcription factors regulating MITF-M expression. MITF-M induces expression of
  pigmentation-related genes, MLANA, PMEL, TYR, and DCT, among others. Our results
  strongly suggest that this pathway is not active in drug-naïve cells carrying MC1RR151C  +/+
  variant and drug-resistant melanoma cells that acquired a corresponding homozygous
  mutation. WT, nonmutated MC1R.
