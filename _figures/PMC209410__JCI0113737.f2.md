caption: A working model of mammalian bone development. Hypothetical representation
  of the growth plate during endochondral bone formation (adapted from ref. ). Prehypertrophic
  chondrocytes (pre) localized within the growth plate produce a cell signaling molecule,
  Ihh, which diffuses to the receiving cells via HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) that are
  glycosylated by EXT1 and EXT2 HS-Pol activity. By analogy with what is known about
  the Hh signaling cascade in Drosophila, it is likely that signaling is initiated
  when Ihh binds to a two-component receptor/signal transducer complex on the surface
  of a responding cell, which is composed of both Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo).
  When Ihh binds to Ptc, Smo is de-repressed and additional intracellular components
  of the signaling pathway are activated (reviewed in ref. ). Recent work suggests
  that there may be an additional member in this cascade, Hedgehog-interacting protein
  (Hip), which could act to attenuate Ihh signaling. In bone, Ptc is expressed on
  the osteogenic cells of the perichondral region, and Ihh binding induces chondrocyte
  proliferation by upregulating a second signaling molecule, PTHrP. PTHrP binds to
  the PTH/PTHrP receptor on a subpopulation of proliferating (pro) and prehypertrophic
  chondrocytes, thereby inducing production of Bcl-2, a well known antiapoptotic protein.
  In the absence of negative feedback, chondrocytes differentiate into hypertrophic
  chondrocytes (hyp), which undergo apoptosis and are then replaced by bone-forming
  osteoblasts. According to this model, hereditary exostosis formation would occur
  when a chondrocyte bearing a germline mutation in either EXT1 or EXT2 develops an
  inactivating “hit” in the second copy of the same gene, thereby abrogating HS expression.
  Clonal expansion of this mutant chondrocyte would then lead to a local perturbation
  in Ihh diffusion with, as a result, release from negative feedback control. The
  neighboring population of proliferating chondrocytes would therefore undergo premature
  chondrocyte differentiation, apoptosis, and subsequent ossification.
