caption: Two major intracellular pathways cause apoptosis. (A) Binding of FasL to
  CD95 (Fas receptor) leads to recruitment and activation of procaspase 8, which subsequently
  activates caspase 3. Activated caspase 3 is responsible for induction of several
  events that lead to apoptosis. A second apoptotic pathway is initiated by leakage
  of cytochrome C from the mitochondria, which together with caspase 9 and APAF1 forms
  the apoptosome that can activate caspase 3. The integrity of the mitochondrial membrane
  is regulated by proteins of the Bcl-2 family, Bax and Bak being proapoptotic, Bcl-2
  and Bcl-xl antiapoptotic. (B) Apoptosis resistance in ulcerative colitis results
  from overexpression of FLIP, leading to impairment of the caspase mediated pathway
  of apoptosis. The mitochondrial pathway is intact. (C) In contrast, in Crohn’s disease,
  Fas induced apoptosis is normal but the mitochondrial pathway is affected by an
  imbalance of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. As a consequence, activation
  induced apoptosis of T cells is impaired.
