caption: 'Model of skin immune response in dermatophytosis. Dermatophyte fungi invade
  the stratum corneum and release proteases (P) that degrade keratin for fungal growth
  and facilitate tissue invasion. Extracellular vesicles (EV) loaded with fungal virulence
  factors might be also released during infection. Host recognition of dermatophytes
  is mainly through CLR and TLR on myeloid cells and keratinocytes. The adapter protein
  CARD9 is a key molecule in fungal sensing that signals downstream various CLR and
  mediates cross-signaling of other innate receptors (TLR and NLR). Keratinocytes
  (KC) sense fungal hyphae and consequently release: 1) antimicrobial peptides (AMP;
  including cathelicidin and β-defensin) that are effector molecules promoting fungal
  clearance, 2) proinflammatory mediators (IL-6, CXCL8, TNF) that further stimulate
  inflammation and neutrophil recruitment or 3) immunosuppressive proteins, such as
  TSG-6, particularly in human infections with anthropophilic dermatophytes. Also,
  IL-6, IL-17, and IL-22 further stimulate KC activation. Neutrophils recognize fungi
  and trigger the intracellular activation of MAPK and NFκB pathways leading to proinflammatory
  cytokines/chemokines release that also enhance KC activation, recruit more inflammatory
  leukocytes and, probably, promote IL-17 producing-lymphocytes through IL-23 release.
  Neutrophils also secrete reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular
  traps (NETs) that kill dermatophytes. The role of macrophages has not been directly
  evaluated during skin infections but these cells might also kill dermatophytes by
  IFN-γ-induced ROS and nitric oxide (NO) production or even resolve inflammation
  through phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils with production of anti-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g.: IL-10). As for adaptive immunity, Langerhans cells (LC) are located
  in the epidermis and sense dermatophytes, migrate to skin draining lymph nodes and
  promote Th17 differentiation (ref. 51). Whereas in the dermis, different subsets
  of dendritic cells (DC) are probably involved in sensing fungal molecules and producing
  cytokines that drive IL-17- or IFN-γ- mediated immunity. IL-17A produced by adaptive
  Th17 cells and innate lymphocytes (γδT or ILC) boosts KC activation/proliferation
  and inhibits superficial fungal growth. Upon binding to IL-17RA/IL-17RC in KC, IL-17A
  activates Act1-TRAF6-NFkB/MAPK or STAT-3 intracellular pathways and induce cytokines/chemokines
  and AMP production. Furthermore, the IL-17/IL-17RA pathway transactivates epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) which promotes KC proliferation. During mild superficial
  experimental infection with M. canis, type 17 immunity restricts both fungal growth
  and an exacerbated type 1 (IFN-γ mediated) inflammation (ref. 51). Conversely, IFN-γ
  mediated-response suppresses cytokines related to the IL-17 pathway leading to an
  increased fungal burden. During T. benhamiae experimental infection both Th1 and
  Th17 phenotypes are induced and control the cutaneous mycoses (ref. 120). Dotted
  lines and question marks refer to mechanisms not directly demonstrated in the context
  of skin dermatophytosis. CARD9 signaling might be involved in various skin cells
  populations of the antifungal defense. KC, keratinocyte; LC, Langerhans cell; DC,
