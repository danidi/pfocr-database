caption: Signaling pathways modulated by SCD1 activity and levels. Black arrows are
  signals of cell proliferation or associated with high SCD1 expression or activity,
  while red arrows are signals linked to cell death or decreased SCD1 expression or
  activity. Inflammatory pathway is shown in green. SCD1 inhibition reduces the pro-inflammatory
  environment and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) signaling to reduce cell proliferation,
  while NFκB signaling activation promotes transcription factors binding to SCD1 promotor
  and gene expression. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is related to cell proliferation
  and it is shown in orange. High SCD1 levels are linked to increased β-catenin signaling
  and increased levels of wingless-related integration site (Wnt) ligands to induce
  cell proliferation. Hippo pathway is a β-catenin-related signal cascade, which is
  associated with cell proliferation, and SCD1 inhibition has been demonstrated to
  be associated with decreased levels of Hippo target genes. This pathway is shown
  in dark orange. The SCD1 peptides from proteolytic controlled degradation activate
  androgen receptor (AR) signaling to promote cell proliferation. This pathway is
  shown in dark blue. The autophagy cell death pathway is a protein cascade which
  is upregulated after SCD1 inhibition. Some central elements of this pathway are
  shown in light blue. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signal pathway is shown
  in red. This cascade is linked to misfolded and unfolded proteins to induced cell
  death. SCD1 inhibition has been linked to the upregulation of the elements of the
  ER pathway to promote cell death. SCD1 is also ubiquitinated by this pathway to
  promote protein degradation. However, light ER pathway activation has also been
  related to cell survival (dashed black arrows). Apoptosis is a programmed cell death
  shown in grey that is activated after SCD1 inhibitor treatments. Increased ceramides,
  mitochondrial effector pathway, caspases, and other pathway effectors have been
  detected after treatments. Ferroptosis is another cell death mechanism (yellow)
  that has been shown to be activated after SCD1 Inhibition. Finally, SCD1 inhibition
  has been demonstrated to induce cell cycle arrest in different checkpoints to promote
  cell death. Molecules in parentheses are SCD1 inhibitors used in the literature
  to elucidate the SCD1-related pathways.
