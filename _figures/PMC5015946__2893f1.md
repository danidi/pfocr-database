caption: The cell wall, the cell integrity pathway, and the HACS complex (adapted
  from ). Fks1 and Fks2 (green transmembrane proteins) are responsible for β-glucan
  synthesis {illustrated by black [β-(1,3)-d-glucan] and gold [β-(1,6)-d-glucan] bars}
  and are the targets for caspofungin action. The glucans form the inner cell wall.
  Mannoproteins are attached to the glucan layer and form the outer cell wall. Note
  that, in reality, the cell wall is closely apposed to the plasma membrane, containing
  the stress sensors, the three Wsc proteins, Mid2, and Mtl1. The chitin synthases,
  Chs1, Chs2, and Chs3 (dark blue), synthesize the chitin polymer that is found primarily
  at the bud neck between mother and daughter cells, and at bud scars on mother cells.
  Proteins of the cell wall integrity pathway, initiated by activation of the monomeric
  G protein Rho1, are illustrated in the center of the cartoon, resulting in activation
  of the transcription factors, Rlm1, and Swi4/Swi6. The plasma membrane complex for
  high affinity Ca2+ uptake, Cch1, Mid1, and Ecm7 is also illustrated here (dark purple).
