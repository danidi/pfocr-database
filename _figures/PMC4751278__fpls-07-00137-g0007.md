caption: The proposed signal transduction pathway for the Hik2-based two-component
  system in cyanobacteria. The autophosphorylation activity of Hik2 is regulated by
  signals from the photosynthetic electron transport chain and by sodium ions (Na2+).
  The red arrow indicates an inhibitory effect. A black arrow indicates activation.
  Autophosphorylated (active) Hik2 transfers phosphoryl groups to Rre1 and RppA. Phosphorylated
  Rre1 and RppA activate genes encoding the photosynthetic machinery. In addition,
  the phosphorylated form of Rre1 acts as a negative regulator for salt/osmotic tolerance
  genes. Under high salt/osmotic condition, Na2+ inhibits the autophosphorylation
  of Hik2. Phospho-Rre1 becomes dephosphorylated, which in turn removes the repression
  of salt/osmotic tolerance genes.
