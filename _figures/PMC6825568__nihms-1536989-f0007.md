caption: In response to gemcitabine-induced DNA replication stress, TopBP1/ATR/ATRIP
  (not shown) complexes are recruited to stalled replication forks where ATR can fully
  activate Chk1 leading to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In the presence of 9-ING-41,
  TopBP1 protein levels are destabilized thus abrogating the full activation of ATR
  leading to reduced Chk1 phosphorylation and ultimately impaired cell cycle arrest
  and likely DNA repair. Circle with red P indicates phosphorylation. Dashed rectangle
  with red X indicates TopBP1 degradation.
