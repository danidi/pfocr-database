caption: Conjectural model of the role of CSP in activation of linoleic acid/omega6
  fatty acid-diacylglycerol pathway upon xenobiotic insecticide or juvenile hormone
  exposure. (1) Some insect cells have the ability to synthesize linoleic acid (C18:2)
  de novo using fourteen-eighteen carbons-fatty acids (C14–C18) and specific desaturases.
  (2) C18:2 is fuel molecule for omega6 fatty acid pathways. Molecules such as arachidonyl-CoA
  ((Z5,Z8,Z11,Z14)-Icosatetraenoyl-CoA or C20:4) are products of a ∆5 desaturase reaction
  from eicosatrienoyl-CoA (C20:3) as a direct substrate. (3) Synthesis of these fatty
  acid metabolites leads to phosphatidic acid and therefore to the formation of diacylglycerol
  (DAG) through the biosynthetic pathway of glycerol-phosphatydilcholins. (4) DAG
  is a relay molecule in intracellular cascades activated by the binding of regulatory
  chemical ligand (labelled by a black triangle) to G-protein coupled receptor. This
  triggers the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and DAG by PLC (phospholipase
  C). In turn, IP3 releases the calcium ions (Ca++) from intracellular stocks in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). (5) DAG (with Ca++) activates (+) protein kinase C (PKC),
  which in turn induces specific cellular responses by phosporylating a particular
  set of cellular proteins (ion channels, myosin, cytochrome P450, desaturase enzymes,
  etc.). Applying xenobiotic insecticide and/or juvenile hormone (JH) activates (+)
  the DAG pathway and thereby protein phosphorylation (red symbol P) via increased
  concentrations of C18 and C20 fatty acids on cell growth performance and/or immune
  response of various tissues, organs and organ systems. The green arrow means that
  the concentration of C18:2, C18:3 and DAG increases with increasing concentration
  of xenobiotic insecticides and/or JH. The central role for CSP in ∆12-fatty acid
  pathway associated with transport of C18:2 for multifunction, immunity, cell development,
  tissue growth and neuronal plasticity is shown in red.
