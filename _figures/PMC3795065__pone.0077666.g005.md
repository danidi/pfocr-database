caption: (A) Wild-type and (B) rad5∆ cells are compared following treatment with CP
  (80 μM), NSC109268 (0.7 µM) or the combination thereof. The indicated time in minutes
  to reach 40% G2/M phase cells is selected as a measure to compare S-phase extension
  in the different cultures. See  for individual FACS profiles.
