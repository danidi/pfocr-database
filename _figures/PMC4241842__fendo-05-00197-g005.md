caption: Interference with the addition of O-GlcNAc (1) results in elevation of UDP-GlcNAc
  and UDP-GalNAc (UDP-HexNAc) levels (2). Compensatory metabolic changes include increased
  flux into some complex glycans (3). Feedback inhibition of GFAT (4) is insufficient
  to fully normalize UDP-HexNAc levels in the absence of OGT-1. In addition, with
  increased nucleotide sugar pools, there are changes in upstream complex sugar levels
  (5) and decreased macronutrient storage (6). These changes in cellular nucleotide
  sugar pools are associated with altered transcriptional regulation of genes encoding
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and macronutrient storage enzymes (see text). Metabolite
  levels are increased (green), decreased (red), remain the same (gray), or were untested
  (black). Glc, glucose; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  GluN, glutamine; GlcN-6-P, glucosamine-6-phosphate; GlcNAc-6-P, N-acetylglucosamine-6-P;
  GlcNAc-1-P, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate; acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A.
