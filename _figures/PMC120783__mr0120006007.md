caption: GPI biosynthetic pathways in T. brucei BF and Leishmania promastigotes. The
  T. brucei pathway has been reviewed in reference  and incorporates data from recent
  studies (). The L. mexicana pathway is from references  and . The protein anchor
  pathway is not as well characterized in L. mexicana, and it is unclear whether inositol
  acylation is required for addition of the terminal ethanolamine phosphate (indicated
  by “?”). The final lipid composition of these GPIs reflects the initial incorporation
  of distinct PI molecular species (indicated by PIA, etc.) and/or fatty acid remodeling
  reactions. The fatty acid remodeling steps involve the removal of a fatty acid from
  the sn-1 or sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone and transfer of a new fatty acid
  from an acyl-CoA donor. All GPI intermediates in T. brucei BF contain a diacylglycerol
  lipid, and both fatty acids are remodeled. In contrast, GPI intermediates in most
  Leishmania spp. contain alkylacylglycerol lipids (the alkyl group is indicated by
  a prime) and only the sn-2 acyl group is remodeled. All the reactions shown here,
  with the exception of those involved in the assembly of the LPG anchor and phosphoglycan
  chains, occur in the ER. This figure was adapted from reference .
