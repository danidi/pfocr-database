caption: Four main participants of the methionine metabolic pathway are methionine,
  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and homocysteine. Methionine
  adenosyltransferase (MAT) converts methionine to SAM, which then serves as a methyl-group
  donor substrate for many diverse methyltransferase-catalyzed reactions. The other
  product of these reactions is SAH, which is hydrolyzed to adenosine and homocysteine
  by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). The methionine cycle is completed when
  homocysteine is remethylated back to methionine by B12-dependent methionine synthase
  (MS) using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF) as a substrate. Homocysteine
  can also be remethylated to methionine by an alternate pathway in the liver via
  betainehomocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT)-catalyzed reactions with the formation
  of dimethylglycine (DMG). The methyltransferase, phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase
  (PEMT) catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) and Glycine–N methyltransferase (GNMT) catalyzes the synthesis of sarcosine
  from glycine. Low level of proteasome inhibition down regulates several enzymes
  of the methionine metabolic pathway, thus reducing trans-methylation reactions.
