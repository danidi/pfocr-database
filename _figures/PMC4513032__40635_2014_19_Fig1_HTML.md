caption: 'Melatonin: the ‘master biological clock’. Non-visual effects of light are
  mediated through specific retinal ganglion cells which subsequently activate SCN
  neurons. As a result, SCN inhibits the pineal production of melatonin during daytime
  through a polysynaptic pathway including paraventricular nucleus (PVN), superior
  cervical ganglia, and preganglionic sympathetic neurons of the lateral horn of the
  spinal cord. The pineal melatonin is considered the master biological clock that
  synchronizes the circadian rhythms of different clock genes throughout the body
  with different external ‘timekeepers’, such as light/dark cycles. Furthermore, the
  SCN-PVN network is responsible for 24-h period fluctuations of both sympathetic
  and parasympathetic tone, estimated with heart rate variability analysis, and for
  circadian oscillations of immunity and endocrine function. During inflammation,
  circadian rhythms of different hormones are disrupted, whereas immune cells in the
  periphery suppress melatonin''s nocturnal surge through TNF-α and produce melatonin
  themselves. This extrapineal melatonin acts on a paracrine manner and exhibits both
  pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, depending on time phase and severity of stress.
