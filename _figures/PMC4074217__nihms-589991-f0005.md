caption: Comparison of apoptotic pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The left
  panel represents the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Death receptors trigger the
  movement of pro-caspase-8 to the mitochondria, where its activation is dependent
  upon the translocation of cardiolipin from the inner to the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. This translocation follows the generation of ROS and is accompanied by
  the oxidation of cardiolipin by cytochrome c (cyt c), resulting in the loss of cardiolipin–cyt
  c association, with cyt c remaining in the intermembrane space. Active caspase-8
  cleaves Bid to tBid, which in turn triggers mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP). Cyt c diffuses into the cytosol through the MOMP, where it binds to APAF-1,
  resulting in assembly of the apoptosome and inducing cell death. The right panel
  depicts a proposed model for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3 agonists cause
  mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in the generation of mitochondrial ROS. It
  is postulated that increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ occur through voltage-dependent
  anion channels (VDAC) and the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU). This results in
  a transient loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). It is unclear if the
  mitochondrial dysfunction induced by NLRP3 agonists proceeds to MOMP. Cardiolipin,
  miofusin 2 (Mfn2), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) have been
  implicated in the association of NLRP3 with the mitochondria and are required for
  efficient inflammasome activation.

  description: Comparison of apoptotic pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
    The left panel represents the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Death receptors
    trigger the movement of pro-caspase-8 to the mitochondria, where its activation
    is dependent upon the translocation of cardiolipin from the inner to the outer
    mitochondrial membrane. This translocation follows the generation of ROS and is
    accompanied by the oxidation of cardiolipin by cytochrome c (cyt c), resulting
    in the loss of cardiolipin–cyt c association, with cyt c remaining in the intermembrane

    outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Cyt c diffuses into the cytosol through
    the MOMP, where it binds to APAF-1, resulting in assembly of the apoptosome and
    inducing cell death. The right panel depicts a proposed model for NLRP3 inflammasome
    activation. NLRP3 agonists cause mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in the generation
    of mitochondrial ROS. It is postulated that increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ occur
    through voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) and the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter
    (MCU). This results in a transient loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm).
    It is unclear if the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by NLRP3 agonists proceeds
    to MOMP. Cardiolipin, miofusin 2 (Mfn2), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling
    protein (MAVS) have been implicated in the association of NLRP3 with the mitochondria
