caption: Schematic diagram of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Insulin or insulin growth
  factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulation is shown to represent growth factor signaling. Upon
  activation the insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS),
  which activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which in turns phosphorylates
  phosphoinositides to generate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3).
  Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) can dephosphorylate PIP3 to regulate activity
  of the signaling pathway. AKT is activated by binding PIP3 to it the amino terminal
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which promotes translocation of AKT to the plasma
  membrane (represented by a dotted line) where the carboxyl terminal Thr308 is phosphorylated
  by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), and Ser473 is phosphorylated by mTORC2.
  AKT regulates several cellular processes such as survival and cell proliferation
  through a variety of downstream proteins, including BAD (Bcl-2-antagonist of cell
  death), FOXO (Forkhead Box O), NFćB, and GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta),
  among others. AKT can directly phosphorylate and inactivate a 40kDa, proline-rich
  protein (PRAS40), to relieve the inhibitory regulation on mTORC1 activity. AKT also
  can phosphorylate and inactivate the tuberous sclerosis (TSC) tumor suppressor protein
  complex, which acts as a GTPase-activating protein for the RAS-related small G protein
  (Rheb) to regulate its activity. Retention of the Rheb-GTP form activates mTOR.
  mTOR is complexed with other proteins including Raptor, mLST8 and Deptor in complex
  I (mTORC1) and Rictor, mLST8, Deptor, Sin1 and Protor in complex II (mTORC2). mTORC1
  regulation is mediated through a variety of environmental signals, which are mediated
  by proteins such as REDD (regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1),
  Sestrin 3 (Sesn3), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Rag GTPases. mTORC1 phosphorylates
  downstream p70S6 kinase (S6K) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein
  (4E-BP1), which releases it from inhibiting eIF4E so that 40S ribosomal subunit
  can be recruited to the 5’ end of mRNAs to initiate protein translation. S6K phosphorylates
  ribosomal protein S6, which is also involved in regulating protein translation through
  the 40S ribosomal subunit. mTORC1 is also instrumental in regulating autophagy through
  ULK1 and ATG13 (autophagy related 13 homolog). In contrast, mTORC2 regulation is
  still being investigated, although it is known to be activated by growth factor
  signaling pathways. mTORC2 phosphorylates a different set of proteins, including
  serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), protein kinase C (PKC) and the
  guanine nucleotide exchange factor Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-Triphosphate-Dependent
  Rac Exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) to regulate Rac mediated cytoskeleton changes. Importantly,
  mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT as a feedback into the pathway. Phosphorylation of S6K
  downstream of mTORC1 is a negative feedback to inhibit IRS signaling and Rictor
  phosphorylation. The growth factor mediated activation of the RAS/Raf/MEK/ERK/RSK1
  pathway is another mechanism whereby there can be crosstalk regulation of the AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway.
