caption: Proposed model for the accumulation of BRCA1 complexes at DSB sites. BRCA1
  constitutes three distinct protein complexes with Abraxas/RAP80, FANCJ, and CtIP
  through its tandem BRCT domains. In response to DSBs, the RAP80 complex accumulates
  at chromatin regions flanking DSBs through RNF8/RNF168‐induced polyubiquitin chains.
  This accumulation fine tunes the length of ssDNA by suppressing excess DNA end resection
  and plays critical roles in S and G2 phase checkpoints. The 53BP1/RIF1 complex,
  which is recruited by the same RNF8/RNF168 pathway, mediates NHEJ. In contrast,
  FANCJ and CtIP are accumulated at the DSB through an alternative pathway involving
  HP1 interactions with Lys9‐methylated histone H3. The BRCA1 complexes in this pathway
  mediate HR. me, methylation; Ub, ubiquitin.
