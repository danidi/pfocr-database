caption: Schematic view of the relevant subcellular localization of the proteins involved
  in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), Autosomal Recessive Polycystic
  Kidney Disease (ARPKD), and Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Liver Disease (ADPLD).
  The two ADPLD proteins glucosidase IIβ (GIIβ) and Sec63p are localized in the ER
  and are involved in protein translocation (Sec63p) and folding (GIIβ). The proteins
  associated with ADPKD, polycystin-1 (PC-1, encoded by PKD1) and polycystin-2 (PC-2,
  encoded by PKD2), in addition to the ARPKD protein fibrocystin/polyductin, (FPC,
  encoded by PKHD1) are all ciliary transmembrane proteins which need to go through
  the co-translational translocation pathway (see ) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
  which Sec63p and GIIβ are integral members of, in order to be properly folded and
  trafficked to Golgi and onto their final physiological destination, the primary
  cilia.
