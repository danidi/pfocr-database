caption: Immune pathogenesis of gastric mucosa damage in H. pylori infection. In the
  absence of H. pylori infection, there are very few T cells infiltrating into the
  gastric mucosa, which do not induce apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. In contrast,
  in the presence of H. pylori infection, H. pylori induce inflammation and production
  of chemokine CCL20 to recruit CCR6 expressing activated CD4+ T cells infiltrated
  to the sites of inflammation in the gastric mucosa. The TRAIL expressing T cells
  subsequently induce apoptosis in the H. pylori-infected gastric epithelia cells.
  Meanwhile, immune cells constituting MALTs migrate to and infiltrate the site of
  H. pylori infection in the gastric mucosa, and in such circumstances, CagA may be
  injected into lymphocytes as well as gastric epithelial cells. When CagA is transloacted
  into B lymphocytes, it may induce activation of B lymphocytes to proliferate. The
  molecular mechanism of H. pylori-induced susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
  in gastric epithelia cells is shown in the lower inlet of the figure. In the absence
  of H. pylori infection, TRAIL engagement with death receptors on gastric epithelial
  cells induces only weak activation of caspase 8, and is not able to activate the
  caspase 8 downstream signals to trigger cell death. In contrast, in the presence
  of H. pylori infection, H. pylori enhance the assembly of TRAIL death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC) after TRAIL engagement, to augment the activation of caspase 8 and
  to convey the death signal to mitochondria via cleavage of Bid, leading to activation
  of mitochondrial pathway and breaking the apoptosis resistance. CagA, cytotoxin-associated
  gene A; FADD, Fas-associated protein with death domain; MALT, mucosa-associated
  lymphoid tissue; TRAIL, tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.

  description: Immune pathogenesis of gastric mucosa damage in H. pylori infection.
    In the absence of H. pylori infection, there are very few T cells infiltrating
    into the gastric mucosa, which do not induce apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells.
    In contrast, in the presence of H. pylori infection, H. pylori induce inflammation
    and production of chemokine CCL20 to recruit CCR6 expressing activated CD4+ T
    cells infiltrated to the sites of inflammation in the gastric mucosa. The TRAIL
    expressing T cells subsequently induce apoptosis in the H. pylori-infected gastric
    epithelia cells. Meanwhile, immune cells constituting MALTs migrate to and infiltrate
    the site of H. pylori infection in the gastric mucosa, and in such circumstances,
    CagA may be injected into lymphocytes as well as gastric epithelial cells. When
    CagA is transloacted into B lymphocytes, it may induce activation of B lymphocytes
    to proliferate. The molecular mechanism of H. pylori-induced susceptibility to
    TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in gastric epithelia cells is shown in the lower inlet

    receptors on gastric epithelial cells induces only weak activation of caspase
