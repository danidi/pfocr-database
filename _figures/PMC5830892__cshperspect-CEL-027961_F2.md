caption: FERM-binding partners of Crumbs3. Through its FERM-binding domain (rectangle),
  Crumbs3 can connect to FERM domain-containing proteins. Crumbs3 can connect the
  apical membrane to the actin cytoskeleton and regulate the cell cortex via ezrin–radixin–moesin
  (ERM) proteins. Crumbs3 also binds Yurt family proteins, which negatively regulate
  Crumbs polarity signaling. Crumbs3 interacts with FERM domain proteins that regulate
  the Hippo/Yap pathway to control cell proliferation.
