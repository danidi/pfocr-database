caption: '(A) HptB is activated (i.e. phosphorylated) via either one of three orphan
  sensor kinase hybrids: PA1611, ErcS’ (PA1976) or SagS (PA2824) [–]. When phosphorylated,
  HptB transfers a phosphoryl group to the HsbR receiver domain (HsbR-P), thus repressing
  HsbR kinase activity while activating its phosphatase activity. HsbR-P dephosphorylates
  the anti-anti-sigma factor HsbA. Dephosphorylated HsbA leads to dissociation of
  the HsbA-HsbR complex and a subsequent stable sequestration of the anti-sigma factor
  FlgM by HsbA []. The interaction HsbA-FlgM induces flagellar genes expression, by
  allowing the release of the FliA sigma factor (σ28) []. When HptB is inactive (dephosphorylated
  or in an hptB mutant), swimming and swarming are no longer supported. Instead, the
  HsbR kinase phosphorylates HsbA (HsbA-P) and HsbA-P interaction with HsbD leads
  to an increase of c-di-GMP and RsmY levels. The activation of HsbD strengthens swarming
  repression and results in hyper-biofilm and hyper-twitching phenotypes. This cascade
  of events is in agreement with the waves of regulatory actions that cause bacteria
  progression from an early surface attachment and colonization (swimming and swarming)
