caption: (A) Illustration of the mating pathway, initiated by pheromone stimulations,
  and the filamentous growth pathway, activated by nutrient starvation. Shared components
  are colored in yellow and details of the interactions can be found in the text.
  (B) Schematic representation of the core of our model with forward processes indicated
  in red, backward processes in green, and degradation processes in blue. As input,
  the model takes the Fus3∗ and Kss1∗ levels. These input variables, called x and
  y here, activate Ste12 and Tec1, leading to the dimers Ste12-Ste12 (S2) and Ste12-Tec1
  (T2), the output of our model. The specificity-determining parameters are indicated
  and include q, controlling the relative heterodimerization rate of T1 and S1; w,
  the relative degradation rate of the dimers; Fλ, tuning the Fus3∗-dependent degradation
  rate of Tec1; FS, adjusting the positive feedback of the gene expression on Ste12;
  and FT, determining the genetic positive feedback of Tec1.
