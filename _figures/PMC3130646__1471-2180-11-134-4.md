caption: Expression of genes involved in cellodextrin transport and catabolism during
  cellulose fermentation. Schematic representation of cellulose degradation by cell
  surface attached cellulosomal complex, transport of cellodextrin hydrolysis products
  into the cell by ABC sugar transporters and intracellular catabolism of glucose
  to various metabolic end-products. Heat plot representation of transcript expression
  [as Log2 (array signal intensity)] for genes (known and putative) involved in cellodextrin
  transport and hydrolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glycolytic conversion of glucose
  to pyruvate and anaerobic fermentation of pyruvate to organic acids (formate, lactate,
  acetate) and ethanol, over the course of Avicel® fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum
  ATCC 27405. Cellulosome schematic is an adaptation of the image from the U.S. Department
  of Energy Genome Programs website image gallery (http://genomics.energy.gov; []);one
  black circle - Cthe0506 is pfl-activating enzyme; two black circles - Cthe0423 encodes
  a bi-functional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme involved in direct conversion
  of acetyl-CoA to ethanol; open diamond - Microarray data is not available.
