caption: Under normal culture conditions, growth factors (GF) interact with RTK, which
  then activates the Rho GTPase-JNK signaling pathway required for cell migration
  and invasion (left). Following vandetanib treatment, the fibroblastic morphology
  of Calu-6 cells is altered to a ‘cobble-stone'-like phenotype, and the capacity
  for cell migration and invasion is suppressed through inhibition of Rho GTPase-JNK
  signaling. Vandetanib also increases ROS levels, inducing autophagy and leading
  to chemoresistance. NAC or autophagy inhibitors enhance the chemosensitivity of
  cells to vandetanib (right).
