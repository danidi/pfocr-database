caption: (A) Heparin-bound Anosmin 1 binds to a pre-formed FGF2/FGFR1 complex, promoting
  its assembly and resulting receptor activation. FGFR signaling induces expression
  of FLRT3 and SEF via transcriptional activation and translation. (B) FLRT3 complexes
  with FGFR to promote downstream signaling of the MAPK/ERK pathway via its intracellular
  domain. (C) SEF complexes with FGFR and blocks receptor phosphorylation and activation
  of the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling cascades. (D) EGFR signaling induces MIG6
  expression via transcriptional activation and translation. MIG6 accumulates in the
  cytoplasm where it binds directly with the ligand-activated ErbB kinase domain to
  inhibit auto-phosphorylation. This interaction can direct trafficking of the MIG-bound
  EGFR from the plasma membrane to late endosomes, targeting the receptor for lysosomal
  degradation. Dashed lines connecting the human congenital disorder with the protein
  in the pathway encoded by the causative mutated gene. Syndromes noted in the text
  and/or . HH, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with or without anosmia; KS, Kallmann
  syndrome; FGFR, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor; GF, growth factor; HS, heparin-sulfate;
  P, phosphorylation; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
