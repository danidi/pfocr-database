caption: 'The aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway is depicted with 3,3′-diindolylmethane
  as a model agonist. Upon binding to a ligand, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) sheds
  its cytosolic chaperones and translocates to the nucleus to heterodimerize with
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). This complex binds to the
  xenobiotic response element (XRE) within the genome and drives transcription of
  cytochrome P450 detoxifying enzymes. Proposed avenues of cross-talk with inflammatory
  bowel disease pathology are listed. IBD : Inflammatory bowel disease.'
