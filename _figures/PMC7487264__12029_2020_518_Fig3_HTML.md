caption: Activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway by VacA. PI 3 kinase is associated
  through its SH2 domain in the activated receptor tyrosine kinase. PI 3kinase phosphorylates
  the 3 position of inositol, converting phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to
  phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5- triphosphate. Akt binds to plasma membranes by binding
  to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. It is then activated as a result of
  phosphorylation by two other protein kinases (PDK1 and mTORC2) that also bind PIP3.
  The GSK-3 is inhibited by Akt phosphorylation. Inactivated GSK3β is inactivated
  and leads to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. In the presence of
  VacA, GSK3β is inactivated and conducts to the accumulation of β-catenin in the
  cytoplasm. The β-catenin enters the nucleus where it acts as a coactivator TCF and
  LEF transcription factor for activating transcription of β-catenin-dependent genes
  such as cyclin D1. High expression of cyclin D1 is associated with cancer.
