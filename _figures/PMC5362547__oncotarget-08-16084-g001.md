caption: A. The phosphorylation cascades of Hippo core components reduce the activation
  of the transcriptional co-activator YAP. Phosphorylated YAP is sequestered in the
  cytoplasm by 14-3-3 and recruits SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, which ultimately
  leads to YAP degradation. B. Impaired or attenuated activity of Hippo core components
  results in the dephosphorylation of YAP and translocation of YAP from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, YAP cannot bind to DNA directly and TEAD family
  transcription factors, which are characterized by the presence of a TEA/ATTS DNA-binding
  domain, are key partners of YAP for DNA binding and transcriptional activation.
