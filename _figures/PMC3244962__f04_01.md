caption: Connections of praline metabolism to other pathways.Connections of proline
  synthesis to nitrogen assimilation by GS and GOGAT; the N-acetyl-glutamate pathway
  (chloroplast); the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (chloroplast); GABA metabolism
  (cytoplasm and mitochondria); and, ornithine-arginine metabolism (mitochondria).
  Note that in this illustration, proline synthesis is depicted solely in the chloroplast;
  however, cytoplasmic proline synthesis is also possible. Dashed lines indicate reactions
  that have not been experimentally observed in Arabidopsis. Transport steps are drawn
  merely as the most direct route as transporters for these steps remain mostly unidentified.
  Note that many of these reactions are catalyzed by multiple isozymes with different
  compartmentation; not all of the possible isozymes/localizations are shown. Arabidopsis
  gene identification numbers and gene name abbreviations are given in .
