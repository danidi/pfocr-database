caption: Metabolic PathwaysCell-cycle effect on the stability of protein components
  of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). On the left-hand side, the PPP is shown
  along with related pathways colored by average stability across the stages from
  early S to S/G2. On the right-hand side, the same constellation is shown. It is
  colored in stability values derived from mitosis (left) and G1 phase (right) for
  each protein. TKT and TALDO1 are two enzymes of the PPP that become significantly
  destabilized upon the onset of mitosis.See also  and .
