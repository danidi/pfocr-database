caption: 'A hypothetical schematic representation of the synergistic anticancer effects
  of the combination of PPAR ligands plus other agents. When PPARs are activated by
  ligand binding, they are able to heterodimerize with RXR and activate the target
  gene expression by binding to the PPRE element.  Therefore, the retinoids which
  bind to RXR may be the most preferable partner for the PPAR agonists (A).  However,
  in some types of cancers, the MAPK pathway phosphorylates RXRα, and the accumulated
  nonfunctional p-RXRα interferes with the function of the remaining normal RXRα,
  thereby promoting the growth of cancer cells. The activation of RTKs by their specific
  ligands (growth factors) can play a critical role in the stimulation of the MAPK
  pathway. Therefore, the agents which target the activation of RTKs (B) and/or the
  MAPK pathway  (C) restore the function of RXRα as a master regulator of nuclear
  receptors in cancer cells and this will support the synergistic growth inhibition
  by PPAR and RXR ligands in cancer cells. The HDACs enforce a tight chromatin structure
  and thereby repress the transcription of target genes controlled by PPAR/RXR.  Therefore,
  the combination of a PPAR agonist plus an HDAC inhibitor is more efficient to inhibit
  the growth of cancer cells (D). Finally, the conventional chemotherapeutic agents
  also cause synergistic or enhancing effects to inhibit cancer cell growth by the
  combination of PPAR ligands (E). L: ligand.'
