caption: Canonical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways. The canonical NF-κB
  pathway responds to signals from diverse receptors, including pattern-recognition
  receptors (PRRs) present on cell surface or intracellular environment, TNF receptors
  (TNFRs), other cytokine receptors, as well as T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor
  (BCR). The noncanonical NF-κB pathway is activated by a selective subset of TNFR
  superfamily members. Canonical NF-κB signaling involves activation of the trimeric
  IKK complex by the MAP3 K TAK1, IKK-mediated IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent
  degradation, and nuclear translocation of the prototypical NF-κB heterodimer RelA/p50.
  Noncanonical NF-κB signaling relies on NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK), which together
  with IKKα mediate phosphorylation and processing of p100, causing generation of
  p52 and nuclear translocation of p52/RelB complex. Compared with the pleotropic
  roles of canonical pathway, noncanonical NF-κB has more specific functions. PRR
  pattern-recognition receptors, TNFR TNF receptor, TCR T cell receptor, BCR B cell
  receptor, NIK NF-κB inducing kinase
