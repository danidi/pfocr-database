caption: 'Photoperiodic regulation of FT expression by CO, and FT protein movement.
  A, Arabidopsis plants possess multiple regulatory components to specifically induce
  FT expression in the afternoon in long days. During the morning, the abundance of
  CO protein and its activity are decreased through interactions with various proteins.
  These mechanisms inhibit CO-dependent activation of FT in the morning. CO protein
  is destabilized through phyB, using two different E3 ubiquitin ligases, HOS1 and
  ZTL. Red light absorbed by phyB induces formation of the phyB-HOS1 complex that
  degrades CO. Together with GI protein, ZTL also destabilizes CO. In addition to
  protein stability regulation, transcriptional activity of CO is also directly suppressed
  by two B-BOX-containing proteins, BBX19 and miP1a. Both proteins are highly expressed
  in the morning to reduce the amount of active CO protein. MiP1a-dependent suppression
  of CO activity is attained by direct recruitment of TPL cotranscriptional repressor.
  Two AP2-domain transcription factors, TOE1 and TOE2, can also form a complex with
  CO to suppress CO activity in the morning. DELLA protein, the key repressor of the
  GA signaling pathway, interacts with CO to prevent its function potentially by interrupting
  its interaction with NF-Y. The RING domain protein, BOI, inhibits DNA binding activity
  of CO protein to the FT promoter. In the afternoon, CO protein is stabilized by
  two classes of blue-light photoreceptors: crys and FKF1 protein. Crys negatively
  regulate the function of the COP1-SPA complexes that degrade CO. The FKF1-GI complex
  binds to CO to stabilize it through unknown mechanisms. TOE1 may counteract the
  FKF1-dependent stabilization of CO by competing with CO for the same interacting
  domain of FKF1. Far-red light absorbed by phyA also contributes to stabilization
  of CO in the afternoon. Once CO is stabilized in the afternoon, CO activates transcription
  of FT. The NF-Y complex enhances the binding of CO protein to the FT promoter. CO
  also activates transcription of the FT transporter gene, NaKR1, in long-day afternoons.
  During the night, the COP1-SPA complexes actively degrade CO protein. Therefore,
  FT levels decline during the night. CO symbols drawn with the dotted line indicate
  a lower abundance of CO protein. B, Long-distance transport of FT protein is mediated
  by its interacting partners. FT is transported from companion cells of leaf phloem
  tissues (where it is synthesized) to the shoot apical meristem. Two transporter
  proteins are important for FT movement. FTIP1 is localized in the plasmodesmata
  that connects companion cells to the sieve elements, and is required for transport
  of FT from companion cells to sieve elements, whereas NaKR1 is responsible for long-distance
  movement of FT through sieve elements to the SAM. CCs, companion cells; SAM, shoot
  apical meristem; SEs, sieve elements.'
