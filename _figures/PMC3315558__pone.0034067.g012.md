caption: AmpR positively regulates resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by upregulating
  expression of the amp genes, nagZ and downregulating creD. In addition, AmpR affects
  fluoroquinolone resistance by negatively regulating expression of mexT, the positive
  regulator of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump. Expression of the virulence and stress
  response sigma factor, RpoS and QS-regulated acute virulence factors is downregulated
  in PAOΔampR, indicating positive AmpR regulation. AmpR also negatively regulates
  biofilm formation via an unknown mechanism. AmpR modulates levels of the small RNA
  rsmZ, whose levels are lower in PAOΔampR with a corresponding enhanced expression
  of RsmA. Downregulation of some of the T3SS genes in the ampR mutant is possibly
  by regulating ptrB expression, via PrtR. Further, two major regulators of the alginate
  biosynthetic pathway, AlgT/U and AlgB are negatively regulated by AmpR, thereby
  potentially also regulating alginate production. Whether these AmpR interactions
  are direct or indirect needs to be investigated.
