caption: Activation of the Snf1-dependent glucose repression and Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 (SRR)
  signaling pathways do not repress the HXT2 transcription by RNAP II. We propose
  Ssn6-Tup1 complex as a HXT2 transcription coactivator in rpc128-1007. Under high-glucose
  conditions, Mth1 degradation occurs. Rgt1, which is phosphorylated by PKA, dissociates
  from the HXT2 promoter. Mig1, which is bound to the regulatory region, recruits
  Ssn6-Tup1. The complex transforms into a coactivator complex due to an unidentified
  intracellular signal and the expression of HXT2 is induced. Under non-fermentable
  growth conditions in the strain with low RNAP III activity, the Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 (SRR)
  pathway transduces the signal for unfavorable external conditions to Mth1, preventing
  its degradation. The Rgt1 and Tup1 corepressor complex transforms into an activator
  complex and strongly induces HXT2 expression.
