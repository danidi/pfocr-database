caption: 'Pathways involved in GSIS. A Diagrammatic representation of processes linking
  glucose uptake to insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells. The diagram represents
  processes taking place in the presence of extracellular glucose. Glucose is imported
  into the β cell and undergoes glycolysis. The primary product of glycolysis is pyruvate,
  which is imported into mitochondria. Malate, an intermediate product of glycolysis
  and NADH, also a product of this pathway, may also be imported into mitochondria
  via the NADH shuttles. Malate is converted to fumarate, which is also a product
  of the TCA cycle fed by pyruvate and is a substrate of the respiratory chain, whose
  end product is ATP. Imported NADH can also feed into the respiratory chain. Pyruvate
  may also be recycled from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm via the pyruvate
  cycling pathway. ATP interacts with the KATP channel to block it, resulting in an
  increase in intracellular K+ and depolarization of the cell membrane. This in turn
  leads to activation of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, influx of Ca2+, and activation
  of insulin granule exocytosis. B Overview of the kinetic network modeled. Reactions
  are represented as arrows (which may be uni- or bidirectional) and labeled v1 to
  v44. Metabolites, which are transformed by the reactions, are labeled according
  to their cellular location: metabolites in the cytoplasm and intermembrane space
  are labeled in blue, and metabolites in the mitochondrial matrix are labeled in
  black. Enzymes catalyzing reactions are labeled in brown. Abbreviations are as in
  Table'
