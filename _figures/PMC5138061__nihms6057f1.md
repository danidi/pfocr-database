caption: 'Schematic representation of hypothesized cholesterol/phospholipid recycling
  mechanisms in the injured CNS. Degenerating terminals are initially internalized
  and degraded by surrounding astrocytes. Inside astrocytes, free cholesterol (FC)
  is used for the assembly of an apoE/cholesterol/lipoprotein complex via the ABCA1
  (1) or converted into cholesterol esters (CE) for storage purposes. The newly formed
  apoE/cholesterol/lipoprotein complexes are then directed (a) toward the circulation
  presumably through the ependymal cells surrounding the ventricles and/or (b) to
  specific brain cells requiring lipids. ApoE complexes are apparently internalized
  by the neuronal LDLR pathway (2) and cholesterol is released for dendritic proliferation
  and/or synaptogenesis (4). Within neurons, this free cholesterol can also be stored
  as CE and serves as a lipid pool for eventual needs or be hydroxylated and excreted
  for elimination (7). As a consequence of the internalization process, cholesterol
  synthesis in neurons (via the HMGCoAR Pathway) becomes progressively repressed (5).
