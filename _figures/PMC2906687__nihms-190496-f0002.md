caption: Working model of adenosine mediated intracellular signaling in corpus cavernosum.
  Adenosine induces synthesis of both, cGMP and cAMP, in corpus cavernosum. cAMP induction
  is mediated through A2B receptor on smooth muscle cells. Induction of cGMP by adenosine
  is most possibly mediated by activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in endothelial
  cells through A2B receptor signaling. NO upon diffusing into smooth muscle cells
  may induce cGMP. Both, cAMP and cGMP, activate their downstream kinases, PKA and
  PKG, respectively, which in turn phosphorylate their downstream targets resulting
  in a decrease in intracellular Ca+2 concentration that leads to smooth muscle relaxation.
  PKG also phosphorylates RhoA and inhibits RhoA-Rho kinase signaling pathway, thereby
  contributing to smooth muscle relaxation.
