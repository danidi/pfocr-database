caption: The Notch pathway is active in proliferating Pax7+/MyoD+ cells derived from
  Pax7+ quiescent satellite cells. Upon exit from the cell cycle, Notch signaling
  is down-regulated in Pax7+/MyoD+ cells that later become Pax7−/MyoD+, progress into
  differentiation, and eventually fuse to give rise to myofibers. The level of Notch
  activity (shown as the yellow gradient) is maintained (or up-regulated) in Pax7+/MyoD−
  cells that replenish the pool of satellite cells. The balance between Pax7+/MyoD−
  and Pax7+/MyoD+ cells is maintained by Dll1 shedding by ADAM proteases in a stochastic
  and cell density-dependent manner. Dll1 shedding in a pool of cells leads to ligand
  depletion and down-regulation of Notch signaling in neighboring cells, maintenance
  of MyoD expression, and eventually loss of Pax7 expression. Cells in which Dll1
  cleavage takes place acquire higher level of Notch activity than their neighbors,
  leading to down-regulation of MyoD and sustained Pax7 expression.
