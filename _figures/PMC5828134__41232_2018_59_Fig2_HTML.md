caption: Schematic diagram of ca2+ signal transduction pathway and other miscellaneous
  pathways activate in response to the electrical and mechanical stimulations. The
  mechanical stimulation on piezoelectric scaffold will result in the electrical signal
  generation and which will stimulate the voltage-gated ca2+ channel. Further increase
  in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration activates the calmodulin (an abbreviation
  of the calcium-modulated protein) and which will further activate the calcineurin
  (calcium and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase). The activated
  calcineurin dephosphorylates the NF-AT and it will translocate to the nucleus, where
  it acts in conjunction with other associated proteins as transcription factors.
  Also the mechanical stimulation itself can activate the mechanoreceptors present
  in the membrane and which will lead to the activation of PKC and MAPK signaling
  cascades. These cascades will result in the synthesis of proteoglycan and inhibition
  of IL-1, responsible for the breakdown of proteoglycan
