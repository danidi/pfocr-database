caption: 'Schematic illustration of the proposed intracellular translocation pathway
  of different liposomes, endosome escape, bacillus Calmette–Guérin cell wall skeleton
  (BCG-CWS) release, and the resulting cascade of the immune response. The intracellular
  uptake behavior varied according to the type of liposomal nanocarrier: The uptake
  of naked BCG-CWS or plain liposomes (CWS-L) was limited or poor. However, functionalization
  enabled uptake enhancement via FR-mediated endocytosis (FA-modified) or transient
  perturbation/penetration (Pep1-modified). The BCG-CWS released into the cytosol
  triggered a cascade of immune response via cytokine production and immune cell recruitment,
  thereby exhibiting antitumor efficacy.'
