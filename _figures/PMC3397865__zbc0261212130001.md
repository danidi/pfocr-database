caption: A, distribution of normal prostate steroidogenic and UGT isozymes according
  to the publications cited. Based on the studies cited, prostate DHT synthesis and
  its metabolism are summarized in a schematic. Electron micrographs show 1:1 stratification
  of human prostate basal/luminal cells with intervening gap junction structures that
  likely allow movement of small molecules between the two cells (). Structural integrities
  allow the transport of the steroid precursor DHEA () from blood to basal cells,
  and not to luminal cells. Appropriate steroidogenic enzymes for DHEA conversion
  to testosterone are in basal cells (, ). The fact that 5α-SR-2 is detected primarily
  in luminal cells () suggests that testosterone is transported to luminal cells via
  gap junctions to undergo reduction to DHT to support DHT occupation of the androgen
  receptor to carry out prostate-specific functions. Whereas 2B15 is distributed in
  luminal cells () and it metabolizes the active DHT (), it is likely that 2B15 generates
  both DHT- and 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol-glucuronides (ADT DIOL-G), which exit via
  gap junctions to basal cells for excretion into blood for facilitated excretion.
  Moreover, the entry of luminal cell-reduced testosterone (DHT) to basal cells allows
  2B17 (, ) to participate in DHT metabolism. B, a recently described testosterone
  bypass pathway in cell lines () and intratumoral tissue () shows that 4-androstenedione
  (4-AD) is reduced consecutively by 5α-SR-1 and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (17βHSD) to DHT. Both 5α-androstanedione and DHT are interconvertible by 3α-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenases (3αHSD) to androsterone (ADT) and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (ADT
  DIOL), respectively. 5α-Androstanedione and DHT, as well as androsterone and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol,
  are also interconvertible by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 2 and 3, respectively.
