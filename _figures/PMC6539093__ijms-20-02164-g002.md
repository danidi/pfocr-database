caption: Schematic view of the ERK pathway in response to growth factors, hormones,
  and mechanical stress. The prototypical activation of ERK cascade is initiated at
  the plasmamembrane by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in response to growth factors.
  Activated RTKs promote RAS stimulation through recruitment of SOS exchange factor.
  RAS facilitates the activation of MEK-ERK cascade through serial phosphorylation.
  Once activated, ERK translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates transcription
  factors, modulating the transcription of hundreds of genes. In cardiac myocytes
  under stress (aortic stenosis and hypertension), ERK is activated in response to
  G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and/or “stretch-sensitive” sensors, such as
  membrane bound integrins, and the sarcomere. The activation of ERK cascade is regulated
  by scaffold proteins (KSR, Shoc2, Erbin, β-arrestin, IQGAP, Melusin, FHL1, and ANKRD1),
  which bind components of the RAF-MEK-ERK module, facilitating their functional interaction
  and subcellular localization. Scaffolds also link the ERK activation to specific
  upstream signal and affect the duration of the signal.
