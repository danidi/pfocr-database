caption: Top two networks constructed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showing
  interactions between the top 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the dendritic
  cells (DCs) from patients with allergies. (A) The network with the highest score
  of 36, comprising amphiregulin (AREG), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2),
  colony-stimulating factor (CSF), protein kinase B (Akt), was associated with cell
  death/survival, cancer, and organismal injury/abnormalities. (B) The second-highest
  scoring network with a score of 18, comprising filamin B (FLNB), tyrosylprotein
  sulfotransferase1 (TPST1), and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), was associated
  with cell-to-cell signaling/interaction, cellular movement, and cardiovascular system
  development/function. The downregulated genes in allergic patients are colored in
  green, and the upregulated genes are colored in red. The gradient of the colored
  shape indicates DEG strength.
