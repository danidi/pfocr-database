caption: 'Regulation of muscle mass. The maintenance of muscle mass is the result
  of a tight equilibrium between hypertrophic and atrophic signaling pathways. A major
  advance in the understanding of the regulation of muscle proteolysis was the identification
  of two muscle-specific E3 ligases, atrogin-1 and Muscle Ring Finger protein 1 (MuRF1),
  that are directly involved in several atrophic conditions. These E3 ligases act
  as the substrate recognition component of the ubiquitination system, therefore preventing
  nonspecific protein degradation by the proteasome complex. Of note, the ubiquitin-proteosome
  (UbP) is unable to degrade native and intact contractile structures. Preliminary
  steps aimed at disrupting the myofibrillar assembly are necessary before contractile
  protein degradation can be initiated. Among them, the autophagy/lysosomal pathway
  is receiving a great deal of attention, because it may be the most important proteolytic
  pathway in some experimental models of muscle atrophy. The activation of the muscle-specific
  E3 ligases is under the control of various pathways: (1) the Forkhead box O (FOXO)
  class of transcription factors enhances the nuclear transcription of MuRF1 and atrogin-1
  unless they are phosphorylated and inactivated by AKT. Conversely, depressed AKT
  activity and reduced FOXOs phosphorylation will allow FOXOs nuclear translocation
  and the induction of MuRF1 and atrogin-1; (2) proinflammatory cytokines can activate
  the nuclear factor (NF)-κB, which in turn can also induce atrophy through the activation
  of MuRF1; (3) the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway can be triggered
  by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been implicated in the activation of the
  UbP pathway and in the initiation of the cachectic process in rodent and cell models
  of muscle atrophy. Among the various members of the MAPK family, p38 MAPK has received
  considerable attention because it stimulates the expression of atrogin-1, whereas
  its inhibition prevents muscle atrophy. JNK MAPK has also been implicated in the
  atrophying process in some experimental models, although its role is less convincing
  compared with p38. Myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass, is able to halt
  muscle growth by direct inhibition of the kinase activity of AKT or, through the
  SMAD signaling pathway, by inhibiting satellite cell replication and differentiation
  by blocking the activity of myogenic differentiation factor-D (MyoD). Myostatin
  is also able to enhance the proteasomal-dependent degradation of contractile protein
  by increasing the transcriptional activity of FOXO-1. Activation of the atrophic
  cascade is opposed by the hypertrophic response. In this regard, the importance
  of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway to promote muscle growth has
  been appreciated for some years. The protein synthesis response to IGF-1 is mediated
  through AKT. On phosphorylation, AKT phosphorylates several proteins whose activation
  (mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] and 70-kD ribosomal S6 protein [p70S6] kinase)
  or inhibition (glycogen synthase kinase-3β [GSK3β]) will enhance protein synthesis.
  IGF-1 may also suppress protein degradation by down-regulating atrogin-1 again via
  the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as FOXOs phosphorylation and entrapment in the cytoplasm.'
