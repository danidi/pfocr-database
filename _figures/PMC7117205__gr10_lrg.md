caption: 'Schematic diagram of the PEDV-induced apoptosis signalling pathway. PEDV
  infection increased ROS accumulation and further promoted p53 activation and transfer
  of p53 to the nucleus. PEDV infection promoted apoptosis by increasing Bax expression
  and inhibiting Bcl-2 expression. Inhibition of activated p53 and ROS reduced the
  ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and apoptotic rate, thus ROS and p53 participated in PEDV-induced
  apoptosis. PEDV infection activated p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK signal pathway whereas
  p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK activation had nothing to do with PEDV-induced apoptosis.
