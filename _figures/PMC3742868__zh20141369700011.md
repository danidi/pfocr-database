caption: Proposed scheme for the role of mTOR in p53-induced kidney cell injury. HIV
  enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in multiple ways, including kidney
  cell activation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and phosphorylation of p66ShcA;
  the latter phosphorylates Akt. HIV can also phosphorylate Akt through the activation
  of kinases. Akt-induced phosphorylation of Foxo3A deactivates the redox-sensitive
  stress program in the form of attenuated generation of SOD and catalase (Cat), leading
  to accumulation of ROS. Phosphorylation of Akt enhances activation of mTOR, which
  enhances expression of p53 and associated activation of p66ShcA. ROS-induced DNA
  damage also activates the p53 pathway, which may lead to the expression of inhibitors
  of the cell cycle (p21, p27, and GADD45) and proapoptotic molecules such as Fas.
