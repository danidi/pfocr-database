caption: 'Convergent adaptation of different pathogens is evident at the pathway and
  functional levels (a) Flagella pathway. A schematic illustration of the bacterial
  flagella. Parts that include genes that underwent adaptive change or loss of function
  in different bacterial species are denoted. (b) Rifampicin resistance. Locations
  of mutations in the RRDR of RNAP in TB, PA, and SA strains are denoted. The numbers
  denote the corresponding residues on the RpoB of TB, which were affected by the
  mutations. Color indicates rifampicin treatment: dark green—confirmed treatment
  by rifampicin; bright green—likely treated by rifampicin based on conventional medical
  indications for the use of the drug; light orange—likely not treated by rifampicin
  based on conventional medical indications for the use of the drug; dark orange—not
  treated by rifampicin. (c) Glycerol-3-phosphate synthesis. Genes involved in glycerol-3-phosphate
  synthesis that underwent change/loss of function in a large fraction of the strains
  in different bacterial species. X marks the gene encoding the relevant protein that
  underwent adaptive change or loss of function, with the color of X indicating the
  species. PRPP: phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. Names of bacterial species are as in
  . Shapes represent chemical compounds: orange circle—phosphate, blank circle—glycerol,
  blank square—glycerone, blue pentagon—imidazole, blank triangle—ribose or ribulose,
  and blank ellipse—formimino group + AICAR group.'
