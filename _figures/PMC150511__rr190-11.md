caption: Apoptosis signaling and pathways. (A) Schematic model for apoptosis pathways
  in the perinatal alveolar epithelium. Exposure to ascending ΔpO2 regimen and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), a process referred to as chemioxyexcitation, triggers a signaling
  mechanism that could lead to either apoptosis or activation of NF-κB. NF-κB conveys
  a protective effect by amplifying Bcl-2 through the antagonism (anti-apoptotic)
  survival loop. Whereas thiols such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and γ-glutamylcysteinyl-ethyl
  ester (γ-GCE) promote the survival loop, sulfasalazine (SSA), a selective inhibitor
  of NF-κB, confers negative regulation favoring apoptosis. Glutathione depletion
  by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) upregulates the expression of Bax and p53
  through activation of the agonism (pro-apoptotic) death loop, an effect that is
  mimicked by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). The likely 'executioners' implicated
  in apoptosis are the caspases, the final effectors in the death machinery. (B) Schematic
  model for apoptosis pathways in the perinatal developing lung. The transition from
  placental to lung-based respiration during the birth transition period constitutes
  a potential signaling mechanism in the lung. This represents a relative hyperoxic
  shift, which allows the differential expression of signaling cofactors involved
  in apoptosis. The downstream pathway mediates suppression of Bcl-2 with pulmonary
  oxygenation, a phenomenon accompanied by down-regulating Bax. The major participant
  in regulating cell death ex utero is p53, which switches off the induction of Bcl-2
  and rather predominates Bax in controlling apoptosis within the perinatal lung.
  This reinforces the presumption that signaling pathways mediating apoptosis in response
  to oxygenation in the developing lung are p53-dependent. The (+) sign indicated
  positive modulation (up-regulation) and (-) sign indicates negative modulation (down-regulation).
