caption: The hypotheses to explain the paradox of the LKB1-AMPK pathway and the CAMKK2-AMPK
  pathway in cancer. a The LKB1-AMPK pathway. Partial activity of AMPK in the absence
  of LKB1 may be sufficient to trigger metabolic adaptation, while insufficient to
  inhibit mTORC1 in the tumor microenvironment. b The LKB1-AMPK pathway. Additional
  mutations that could compensate for the loss of LKB1-induced metabolic adaptation
  may exist in LKB1-deficient cancer. c The CAMKK2-AMPK pathway. Unlike to LKB1 induced
  activation of AMPK, AR-CAMKK2 induced activation of AMPK can only activate metabolic
  adaptation signaling but not growth inhibitory signaling. See text for details.
  Arrows denote activation, whereas horizontal bars indicate inhibition
