caption: Schematic diagram of the regulatory effects of melatonin on BBB integrity
  and permeability. IL-1β induced NOTCH3 (NICD) expression which activated NF-κB/p65
  expression. NF-κB/p65 translocated to the nucleus to induce MMP-9 expression, and
  MMP-9 disrupted BBB integrity and permeability. When melatonin, DAPT, PDTC, and
  SB-3CT were added respectively, NOTCH3 expression was significantly inhibited, leading
  to decreased NF-κB/p65 and MMP-9 expression, which protected BBB integrity and permeability.
