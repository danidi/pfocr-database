caption: Schematic diagram depicting the proposed mechanism for HPV 16/18 E6-induced
  CC progression from the perspective of “EV-shuttled Wnt7b acts on β-catenin signaling”.
  In the TME, HPV 16/18 E6 upregulated Wnt7b expression in both HPV 16/18-positive
  CC cells and their EVs. These Wnt7b mRNA-enriched EVs could be transferred to and
  internalized by recipient HUVECs and then modulate HUVECs toward more proliferative
  and proangiogenic behaviors by acting on β-catenin signaling, eventually facilitating
  CC progression
