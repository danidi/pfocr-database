caption: Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Apoptosis can be triggered by
  the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway or through the extrinsic pathway involving the
  death receptors. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated in response to various
  stimuli such as DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, or hypoxia. This
  pathway is mainly modulated through differential interactions between the antiapoptotic
  (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL), the proapoptotic (Bax, Bak), and the BH3-only proteins (Bad, Bid,
  Bim…). Bax, Bid, and Bim are initially inactive and must translocate to the mitochondria
  to induce apoptosis, either by binding via BH3 domains to Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and antagonizing
  their antiapoptotic functions or through the permeabilization of the mitochondrial
  membrane. Permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane releases apoptogenic proteins,
  among which the cytochrome c is leading to the formation of the apoptosome, activation
  of caspase 9, and ultimately to the activation of effector caspases. In the extrinsic
  pathway, ligands (TNF, FASL, or TRAIL) bind to their specific death receptors, which
  lead to their oligomerization, recruitment of procaspase 8, and a specific adaptor
  protein (FADD and TRADD). The formation of the DISC induces autocatalysis of procaspase
  8 into its active form, which in turn leads to the activation of the effector caspases.
