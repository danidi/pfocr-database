caption: Both DNGR-1 and Mincle signal via Syk kinase in response to encounter with
  necrotic cells. Mincle/Syk signalling triggers the CARD9 axis that results in NF-κB
  activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In contrast,
  Syk signalling downstream of DNGR-1 does not couple to NF-κB in DC for reasons that
  remain unclear but have to do in part with the aminoacid composition N-terminal
  to the tyrosine in the hemITAM motif []**. Detection of apoptotic cells by Mgl1
  can result in an anti-inflammatory response via an unknown signalling pathway.
