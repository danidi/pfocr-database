caption: 'Selected glucose metabolic genes and their potential roles in tumor development.
  PPP: pentose phosphate pathway. Hexokinases (HK) 2 and GCK/HK4 phosphorylate glucose
  to produce glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6P), the first step in most glucose metabolism
  pathways including glycolysis . GPI (phosphoglucose isomerase) catalyzes the reversible
  isomerization of Glucose-6P and fructose-6P, and guide the glucose flow to the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) . GPI also functions as an autocrine motility factor (AMF),
  secreted from the tumor cells to promote progression . GFPT1 is the first and rate-limiting
  enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and controls the flux of glucose
  into the hexosamine pathway. OGT is a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition
  of a single N-acetylglucosamine in O-glycosidic linkage to serine or threonine residues.
  O-linked glycosylation plays a role in controlling gene expression, fuel metabolism,
  cell growth, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization .'
