caption: Potential regulatory pathways and candidate genes associated with fatty acid
  synthesis in B. napus . a, the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway; b, the phospholipid
  synthesis and other pathways; c, the triacylglycerol and fatty acid degradation.
  The black characters indicate genes detected in previous studies and also in this
  study, the red characters indicate genes not found in this study but in previous
  studies. The colored arrows indicate genes underlying a QTL which affects traits
  with additive effect, up-arrows indicate QTLs with positive additive and down-arrows
  a negative additive effect. The double-headed arrows indicate genes underlying different
  QTLs which affect the same trait with opposite additive effect at the same time
  based on the WinQTLcart2.5 and QTLNetwork_2.0 results (not combined results of the
  two). Different colors denote different traits as the bar shown at the lower right
  corner of the picture. The abbreviations of gene name are same with the following
  reference papers [,,].
