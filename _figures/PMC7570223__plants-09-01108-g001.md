caption: 'Transcriptomic reconfiguration of pathways involved in energy metabolism
  in response to O2 deficiency. Through a comparative analysis between two genotypes
  of Prunus rootstocks, the hypoxia-tolerant ‘Mariana 2624’ (‘M26′) and the hypoxia-sensitive
  ‘Mazzard F12/1’ (‘F12′), the changes in the transcript levels of genes belonging
  to the routes typically related to energy metabolism (starch/sucrose, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  and lactic/ethanolic fermentations) and that are expressed in a contrasting way
  between the genotypes are described. Along with these routes, their connections
  to TCA cycle, GABA shunt and the GS/GOGAT cycle are presented. The differential
  transcript levels of the genes of the last two pathways show clear differences that
  point to the favoring of one or another metabolic pathway in a genotype-dependent
  manner. In addition, the steps where the regeneration of NAD+, consumption of excess
  H+ (regulation of cytoplasmic pH) and assimilation of NH4+ take place are shown.
  The data included in this re-analysis were obtained through a de novo approach via
  RNAseq data retrieved from NCBI BioProjects PRJNA215360 and PRJNA215068 [], corresponding
  to P. cerasifera × P. munsoniana ‘Mariana 2624’ and P. avium ‘Mazzard F12/1’, respectively.
  Quality control of the libraries was performed with FastQC and the AfterQC tool
  []. Consecutively, all libraries were merged into one unique file to perform a de
  novo assembly with Trinity []. The resulting fasta file was depurated to obtain
  unigenes using Transdecoder with the pFam database [] and CD-HIT-EST [,]. This output
  was used as a reference to perform an alignment using Hisat2 []. Transcript assembly
  was performed through StringTie []. DEGs were obtained using EdgeR from Bioconductor
  []. Genes with adjusted p-value < 0.05 and LogFC > 2 & < −2 were used for further
  analysis. The annotation was performed using GO FEAT [] and KEGG []. DEGs included
