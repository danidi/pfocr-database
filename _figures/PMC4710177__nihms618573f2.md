caption: The p53 tumor suppressor coordinates a complicated network of signaling pathways
  to prevent aberrant cell growth and proliferation. Under normal conditions, the
  p53 protein expression is tightly regulated and maintained at a low level by murine
  double minute 2 (MDM2) and MDMX. MDM2 has E3 ligase activity, and mediates the attachment
  of a ubiquitin (Ub) moiety to p53, which targets it for proteasomal degradation.
  MDM2 also binds p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity. MDMX lacks the E3
  ligase, but forms a heterodimeric complex with MDM2 to stimulate MDM2-mediated p53
  degradation. MDMX also suppresses the transcriptional activity of p53 through its
  direct interaction with p53. In turn, p53 controls the transcription of MDM2 through
  a negative feedback loop. MDM2 also targets MDMX for ubiquitination and proteosomal
  degradation. In response to stress stimuli, the inhibitory effects on p53 are removed
  through distinct mechanisms, allowing p53 to be activated. For instance, exposures
  to radiation (ionizing and ultraviolet light) and DNA-damaging agents activate several
  kinases, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and
  Rad3 related (ATR), which modify the phosphorylation states of p53, MDMX, and MDM2,
  leading to conformational changes in these proteins that block their interactions,
  resulting in p53 stabilization. Oncogenic signals stimulate the production of alternative
  reading frame (ARF), which binds to MDM2 and stabilizes p53. Defective ribosome
  biogenesis causes the release of several RPs, which bind to MDM2 and suppress its
  E3 ligase activity, resulting in p53 accumulation and activation. The consequence
  of p53 protein activation is the transactivation of several downstream genes. Depending
  on the cell type and the stressors, the outcome can be cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
  DNA repair, or senescence.
