caption: Molecular pathways by which WNT-β-Catenin and FGF regulate lung mesenchymal
  development. (1) At early stages of lung development (E10–E12), FGF9 is produced
  by lung mesothelium and epithelium and signals to mesenchymal FGFR1c and FGFR2c
  to maintain mesenchymal proliferation (; ). In the absence of Fgf9, expression of
  the mesenchymal WNT-β-Catenin pathway ligand, Wnt2a, and target gene, Lef1, was
  down-regulated. When FGF9 was overexpressed in airway epithelium, Wnt2a, and the
  β-Catenin target gene, Lef1, were both up-regulated. This suggests a signaling pathway
  in which mesenchymal FGFR activation regulates Wnt2a expression (2) and mesenchymal
  WNT-β-Catenin signaling. (3) Inactivation of mesenchymal β-Catenin resulted in decreased
  expression of Lef1 mRNA and protein, decreased expression of CyclinD1 and decreased
  mesenchymal proliferation, suggesting that mesenchymal WNT signaling could mediate,
  in part, FGF regulated mesenchymal proliferation. (4) Inactivation of mesenchymal
  β-Catenin also resulted in decreased expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in lung mesenchyme,
  suggesting that feedback through FGFR signaling may contribute to the ability of
  mesenchymal WNT signaling to regulate proliferation (5) and Wnt2a expression (2).
  (6) Wnt7b is expressed in airway epithelium and likely signals to mesenchyme to
  regulate WNT-β-Catenin signaling. Red stippled area represents the Wnt2a expression
  domain in the sub-mesothelial mesenchymal compartment.
