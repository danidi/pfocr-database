caption: Role of GPR161 receptor in connection with GLI-Kruppel family member proteins
  and Shh signaling. A, GPR161 acts in the Shh signaling pathway; it is a regulator
  of the PKA-dependent basal repression machinery and functions by increasing cAMP
  levels. This eventually leads to proteolytic processing of Gli transcription factors
  (GLI2 and GLI3) into Gli repressor forms, which repress the Shh signaling pathway.
  B, p.Leu19Gln is predicted as “probably damaging” by Polyphen2; p.L19Q occurs at
  the extracellular region of the protein potentially assisting ligand binding. GPR161's
  protein structure was modeled by GPCR-I-TASSER server.
