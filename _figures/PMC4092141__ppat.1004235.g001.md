caption: 'Dauer entry in C. elegans is regulated by four signaling pathways: a cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway, an insulin/IGF-1-like signaling
  (IIS) pathway, a dauer transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway, and
  a DAF-12 nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) regulated by dafachronic acid (DA) steroid
  ligands. Unfavorable conditions stimulate dauer entry (left panel) by down-regulating
  cGMP production, increasing expression of antagonistic insulin-like peptides that
  down-regulate IIS, decreasing expression of the dauer TGFβ ligand, and inhibiting
  production of DAs. When dauer larvae encounter favorable conditions, these pathways
  are hypothesized to act in reverse. Dotted lines signify down-regulated signaling
  through the pathway, while black lines signify up-regulated signaling through the
  pathway. Colored proteins are active; grayed out proteins are inactive. Grayed out
  ligands are absent. Adapted from , , , .'
