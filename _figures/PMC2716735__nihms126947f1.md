caption: Model of how glucocorticoids could modulate adipocyte cell fate and differentiation
  at multiple stages in the pathway. Myostatin (mstn) induces the formation small
  adipocytes (M-adipocytes) with low levels of lipid and favorable metabolic profile.
  Dexamethasone induces the formation of larger adipocytes with more lipid (D-adipocytes)
  that confers unfavorable effects on metabolism.
