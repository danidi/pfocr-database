caption: Solid lines indicate the proposed mechanisms as supported by experimental
  evidence from literature. The two black dashed lines indicate the drug effects.
  The red dashed line indicates the relationship is existed but the direction is unknown.
  The arrows beside the gene names or biological processes indicate the metformin
  effects. Up-arrows indicate the corresponding genes or processes are up-regulated
  while the down-arrows indicate the corresponding genes or process are down-regulated.
