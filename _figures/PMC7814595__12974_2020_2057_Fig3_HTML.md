caption: Different T cell subsets infiltrate the injured brain. Th1 cells secrete
  proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, to promote M1 polarization.
  M1 microglia also induce and recruit Th1 cells by secreting IL-12 and TNF-α and
  expressing chemokines, such as CXCL9 and CXCL10. Moreover, Th2 cells secrete anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13, to promote M2 polarization, and M2 cells
  can induce and recruit Th2 cells by secreting IL-4, CCL17, CCL22 and CCL24. Th40
  cells, which are proinflammatory, secrete both IFN-γ and IL-17A and infiltrate the
  injured brain in the early stage after brain injury. γδ T cells secrete proinflammatory
  IL-17 to aggravate brain injury. Moreover, γδ T cells and Th17 cells activate proinflammatory
  microglia by modulating the FasL/PTPN2/TNF-α signalling pathway, which aggravates
  ischaemic brain injury. Treg cells interact with microglia and modulate microglial
  polarization from the M1 phenotype into the M2 phenotype via IL-10, and they also
  regulate astrogliosis by producing the cytokine amphiregulin (Areg). CD8+ T cells
  can recruit CD4+ mononuclear cells via the cytokine IL-16 after femoral artery ligation,
  and CD4+ T cells contribute to the imbalance in M1 and M2 polarization
