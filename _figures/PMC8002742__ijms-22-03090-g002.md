caption: 'Activation of type I interferon production via endosomal Toll-like receptors
  and RNA sensor signaling pathway in Sjögren’s syndrome. Endosomal Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), RNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene-5 (MDA5) expressed in salivary gland epithelial and infiltrating cells such
  as plasmacytoid dendritic and B cells in Sjögren’s syndrome induce mainly the production
  of type I interferon (IFN) via downstream molecules. The balance between TLR7 and
  TLR9 responses is controlled by Unc93B1, a protein responsible for trafficking TLR7
  and TLR9 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endosome, where TLR7 and TLR9 recognize
  nucleic acids. Disruption of this control may activate TLR7 signaling and lead to
  the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN. TLR7 ligand stimulation
  also enhances the expression of RIG-I and MDA5, synergistically producing a type
  I IFN signature. The overproduction of type I IFN specifically induces polyclonal
  B-cell expansion and B-cell differentiation into autoantibody-producing plasma cells.
  In addition, type I IFN-induced signaling can induce B-cell activating factor (BAFF)
  production and promote the activation and survival of B cells. The salivary gland
  epithelial cells in Sjögren’s syndrome are one of the source cells that produce
  BAFF after the stimulation of type I IFN. Abbreviations: BAFF: B cell-activating
