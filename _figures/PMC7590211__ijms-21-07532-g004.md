caption: 'Effects of TRIMs on proinflammatory STAT3 (A) and NF-κB (B) signaling cascades
  in CRC. (A) TRIM14 promotes colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion mainly
  through induction of SPHK1 which by increasing the synthesis of S1P promotes activation
  of STAT3 and induction of STAT3-repsonsive genes through extracellular binding to
  the type-1 S1P receptor. However, the detailed mechanism of SPHK1 activation by
  TRIM14 is still unknown. TRIM27 can induce formation of JAK1/STAT3 containing complexes
  through physically interacting with the retromer complex VPS35 thereby facilitating
  STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine (pY). Instead, TRIM29 may enhance the constitutively
  active JAK2/STAT3 pathway presumably upstream of JAK2/STAT3 (question mark). By
  contrast, TRIM52 activates STAT3 signaling indirectly via promoting polyubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation of Shp2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in
  the negative regulation of STAT3. TRIMs with a stimulatory effect on STAT signaling
  are marked in green. G: G-protein; IAP2: inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2; JAK:
  Janus kinase; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; SPHK1: human sphingosine kinase 1;
  S1P: sphingosine 1-phosphate; S1PR: S1P receptor; VEGF: vascular endothelial derived
  growth factor. (B) Overexpression of TRIM31 in CRC promotes invasion and metastasis
  of CRC cells through an activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway which leads to
  an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, TRIM40 inhibits NF-κB
  mainly through promoting neddylation of IKKγ (synonym: NEMO) resulting in the stabilization
  of the IκBα protein and subsequently to the induction of NF-κB-responsive gene promoters
  e.g., those of diverse chemokines encoding genes. TRIM14 can activate the non-canonical
  NF-κB pathway and induction of RelB/p52 target genes by preventing p100/p52 from
  the autophagy-mediated degradation. Mechanistically, the direct physical interaction
  of TRIM14 with p100/p52 induces the recruitment of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14
  which cleaves K63-linked ubiquitin chains of p100/p52 preventing its autophagic
  degradation. TRIMs with a stimulatory effect on NF-κB signaling pathways are marked
  in green; TRIMs with an inhibitory effect are depicted in red. COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2;
  IKK: inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit γ; IL: interleukin; LTβR: Lymphotoxin β-receptor;
  NEMO: NF-κB essential modulator; NIK: NF-κB inducing kinase; TAK1: TGFβ activated
  kinase 1; TNFα: tumor necrosis factor α; TNFR: TNF-receptor; USP14: ubiquitin-specific
  protease 14.'
