caption: PCR array results from 200-day human xenografts given both an initial and
  secondary treatment of estrogen demonstrate changes that coincide with the PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway, depicting the stage of hyperplasia. This is a transitional stage
  from normal prostate epithelium to the formation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
  (PIN) lesions. There is a reduction in the gene expression of the critical tumor
  suppressor, PTEN (−1.29) and NKX3.1 (−2.04, non-significant), and an increase in
  PKB/Akt that inhibits, via phosphorylation (+P), expression of both CASP9 (−6.54)
  and CDKN1A (−1.45; also referred to as p21). This results in the inhibition of apoptosis,
  concurrent with an increase in cell cycle progression. Genes circled in red are
  down-regulated, while those circled in green are up-regulated. Analysis was performed
  (n = 4, age of human fetal prostate prior to implantation was 16–21.5 weeks gestation)
  using a LIMMA statistical test, with the circled genes found to be significant (p<0.05).
