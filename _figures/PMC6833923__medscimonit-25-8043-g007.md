caption: Potential mechanism of osteogenesis associated with the culture of adipose
  tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) using the three-dimensional (3D) printed titanium
  (3DTi) scaffolds. Cells produced insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that was released
  into the matrix and bound to IGF-1R on the cell membrane, which further activated
  the downstream AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway to enhance gene expression.
