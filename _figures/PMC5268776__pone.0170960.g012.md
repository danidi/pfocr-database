caption: In the bile acid synthesis pathway, bile acid intermediate 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one
  can take one of the two routes in subsequent steps. If the intermediate is acted
  upon by AKR1D1, the ultimate product is CDCA. If the intermediate is acted upon
  by CYP8B1, followed by AKR1D1, the ultimate product is CA. In this study, we demonstrated
  that CDCA and CA regulated AKR1D1 through a negative and positive feedback mechanism,
  respectively. In addition to bile acid synthesis, AKR1D1 is also involved in steroid
  hormone metabolism. 5β-reduction by AKR1D1 is a common transformation and major
  deactivation pathway for many steroid hormones. Therefore, AKR1D1 plays a critical
  role in regulating and maintaining the homeostasis of steroid hormones. Thus bile
  acids crosstalk with steroid hormone signaling pathways through modulating AKR1D1
  expression. Plus (+) and minus (-) indicated positive and negative feedback regulation,
  respectively.
