caption: 'Variable content and enzyme activities associated with the phenylpropanoid
  metabolism pathway in tobacco-P. nicotianae interaction. The annotation of metabolites
  was based on comparison of accurate mass to the Scripps database (with 5 PPM of
  tolerance). The color scale represents the relative compound abundance and enzyme
  activities; columns represent the four treatments from left to right: non-inoculated
  Gexin 3 (R), non-inoculated Xiaohuangjin 1025 (S), inoculated Gexin 3 (Ri), and
  inoculated Xiaohuangjin 1025 (Si). PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CoA, coenzyme A. The enzyme activity data were obtained
  after 3 days of pathogen inoculation.'
