caption: Terpenoids are naturally synthesized via one of two possible routes – the
  mevalonate (MVA) pathway or the non-mevalonate or 2-methyl-(D)-erythritol-4-phosphate
  (MEP) pathway. The MVA pathway commences with the co-condensation of acetyl-CoA
  to form acetoacetyl-CoA. The MEP pathway, on the other hand, commences with the
  condensation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate with pyruvate to yield 2-methyl-(D)-erythritol-4-phosphate.
  Both pathways culminate in the production of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and
  dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) – the universal, 5-carbon terpenoid precursors.
  IPP then successively condenses with DMAPP and the products of its condensation
  reactions therewith to yield a homologous series of allylic pyrophosphates that,
  in turn, serve as precursors to specialized terpenoid producing pathways. The cyclized
  and branched derivatives of the de-phosphorylated allylic pyrophosphates then undergo
  a variety of substitution reactions such as hydroxylations and esterifications to
  yield individual terpenoid molecules.
