caption: Model for Dixdc1 function during cortical development. Top, During early
  cortical development, Dixdc1 binds DISC1 and together they synergistically regulate
  neural progenitor proliferation via modulation of Wnt-GSK3β/β-catenin signaling.
  Bottom, During later embryonic development, Dixdc1 integrates DISC1 into a pathway
  independent of Wnt-GSK3β/β-catenin signaling. In this neuronal migration pathway,
  Cdk5 phosphorylates Dixdc1, which regulate the formation of the DISC1/Dixdc1/Ndel1
  complex that is essential for neuronal migration.
