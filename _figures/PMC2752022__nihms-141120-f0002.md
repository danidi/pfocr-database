caption: The role of FoxO factors in endothelial cells. Left panel, FoxO nuclear localization
  can be conferred by incubating ECs in low serum media or by inhibiting PI3K/Akt
  signaling. Nuclear localization of FoxO has been frequently recapitulated in cultured
  ECs by means of ectopic expression of a mutant FoxO isoform mutated at the 3 conserved
  Akt sites (FoxO-TM). On nuclear localization, FoxO can activate or repress the transcription
  of several target genes as illustrated at the bottom. The overall effect of FoxO
  activation in ECs is a suppression of angiogenesis. Right panel, The classical route
  for FoxO nuclear exclusion involves shear stress or the stimulation of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway by different agonists. FoxO gene-targeting in mice has been also used to
  dissect their functions in vivo. FoxO inhibition is generally associated with angiogenesis.
  The generic term FoxO is used to describe properties identified in 1 or more of
  FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4. See the text for details on isoform specific properties
  of the FoxO factors or the paradoxical synergism between FoxO and VEGF signaling.
