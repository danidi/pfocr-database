caption: A schematic of the mechanisms by which A29-V40 peptide activates Nox2. The
  Nox2 catalytic unit gp91phox is located on cell membranes together with the p22phox
  unit. In a resting status, gp91phox retains an inactivated conformation, and other
  components of Nox2 including p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and small GTPase Rac stay
  in the cytosol. When exposed to the A29-V40 α-Syn peptide (or similar peptides with
  critical amino acid sequence), microglial gp91phox is bound to this peptide, which
  possibly initiates a conformational change in gp91phox and directly primes Nox2
  to produce O2• −. Superoxide (O2• −) is readily converted to H2O2, either spontaneously
  or catalyzed by SOD. As a cell membrane-permeable chemical, H2O2 is able to diffuse
  into cytosol, oxidizing cysteine residues in the protein kinase Src and activating
  it. This process further activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway
  to phosphorylate p47phox and p67phox. As a result, Nox2 activity is further enhanced
  and more superoxide ions are produced, establishing a positive feedback loop to
  amplify Nox2 activation. This response includes (1) an “outside to inside” step
  which begins with the binding of A29-V40 α-Syn peptide and gp91phox and leads to
  activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway; (2) an “inside to
  outside” step which is referred to Erk1/2-induced p47phox and p67phox phosphorylation
  and the ensuing amplified Nox2 activation
