caption: 'Simplified diagram of the dynamic and interconnected DNA damage response
  network orchestrated by the signal transducing kinases ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs: (A)
  Tip60 acetylates ATM at lysine residue 3016, resulting in auto phosphorylation and
  activation of ATM kinase monomers. ATM phosphorylation of Chk2 and P53 leads to
  induction of cell cycle arrest, while ATM phosphorylation of Brca1 initiates double
  stranded DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR). Chk2 phosphorylation
  of P53 independent of ATM leads to apoptosis. (B) ATR and TopBP1 localize to sites
  of DNA Damage and replicative stress, where ATR phosphorylates effectors substrates.
  ATR mediated activation of Chk1 and P53 induce cell cycle arrest, while phosphorylation
  of Brca1 augments DNA end resection and single stranded DNA break repair by HR.
  Phosphorylation of P53 by activated Chk1 further augments cell cycle arrest. (C)
  DNA-PK stabilizes P53 in response to excessive genotoxic stress, inducing apoptosis.
  The ku70 and Ku80 subunits of the DNA-PK complex act as scaffolding adaptors for
  DNA-PKcs and recruitment to dsDNA lesions, where DNA-PKcs facilitates DNA repair
  through the error prone non-homologous end joining pathway.'
