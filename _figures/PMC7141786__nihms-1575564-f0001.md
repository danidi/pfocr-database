caption: A proposed model for the molecular events and mechanisms underlying the protection
  of autophagy against alcoholic liver disease. Alcohol is mainly metabolized in the
  liver through a major oxidative pathway. In this pathway, alcohol is catalyzed by
  alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which converts alcohol into highly reactive metabolite,
  acetaldehyde. A small portion of alcohol can also be oxidized into acetaldehyde
  by cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily E, polypeptide 1 (Cyp2E1) and catalase. Acetaldehyde
  is further metabolized by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) into more
  harmless acetate. Alcohol consumption leads to mitochondria damage due to increased
  reactive oxygen species, lipid accumulation and formation of protein aggregates.
  Autophagy can be induced as an adapted protective mechanism to remove damaged mitochondria,
  accumulated lipid droplets and protein aggregates. The removal of damaged mitochondria
  is through selective mitophagy, which is mediated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway that
  promotes mitochondrial ubiquitination. However, chronic alcohol drinking inhibits
  the activity of transcription factor EB, which is a master regulator of lysosomal
  biogenesis and autophagy, leading to insufficient autophagy. Pharmacological induction
  of autophagy (Torin 1 or rapamycin) or inhibition of autophagy (Leupeptin, CQ or
  3-MA) protects or exacerbates alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis, respectively.
