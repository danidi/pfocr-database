caption: Schematic representation of the potential mechanisms by which AICAR regulates
  cardiac metabolism and protects HL-1 cardiomyocytes from the HP/HI-induced lipotoxicity
  and insulin resistance. HP/HI stimulation induces insulin resistance by promoting
  the intramyocellular lipid build-up, which in turn inhibits the insulin signalling
  pathway and the AKT-mediated GLUT4 membrane translocation and glucose uptake. AICAR
  treatment takes part in the regulation of the cardiac metabolic adaptation at several
  levels. First, AICAR short-term stimulation promotes the inhibition of ACC, thereby
  reducing the levels of the allosteric inhibitor of CPT-1 malonyl-CoA and regulating
  the fatty acid mitochondrial β-oxidation. In addition, AICAR-induced AMPK activation
  promotes GLUT4 membrane translocation through non-insulin dependent mechanisms.
  Finally, AICAR stimulation induces the three PPARs mRNA levels and controls the
  expression of some key PPAR-target genes, such as Acadvl and Glut4, involved in
  both glucose and fatty acid cardiac metabolism. Therefore, through these different
  mechanisms, AICAR is able to regulate both the acute metabolic response and the
  long-term metabolic adaptation in cardiac cells.
