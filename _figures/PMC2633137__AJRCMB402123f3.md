caption: Platelets have activities that span the continuum from acute inflammation
  to adaptive immune responses. (A) Activated platelets can mediate inflammatory and
  immune responses using a variety of molecular mechanisms, including release of stored
  chemokines (β-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, ENA-78, Gro α, RANTES, SDF1α,
  and others), cytokines (HMBG1), and growth factors (PDGF, others). Activated platelets
  also synthesize lipid mediators including thromboxane A2 and PAF, which have inflammatory
  and immune activities. The spectrum of inflammatory factors released from activated
  platelets is reviewed in Refs.  and . (B) In addition to lipid mediators, platelets
  rapidly synthesize IL-1β. This occurs via a regulated post-transcriptional pathway.
  IL-1β can then remain cell associated or be released in solution or in association
  with microvessicles. When synthesized by activated platelets in vitro, IL-1β is
  deposited in fibrin clots; if this occurs in vivo, clots and thrombi may act as
  local reservoirs for the cytokine. Platelet-derived IL-1β can signal human endothelial
  cells, leading to synthesis of adhesion molecules and chemokines that mediate PMN
  accumulation and activation (). Platelets can also induce inflammatory responses
  by display of CD40 ligand (CD40L), which is recognized by CD40 on the surfaces of
  endothelial cells (). (C) Activated platelets display P-selectin, which can mediate
  their adhesion to monocytes by binding to PSGL-1 on the leukocyte surfaces. P-selectin
  acts in concert with other adhesion molecules on the platelet plasma membrane and
  with chemokines and cytokines released by the platelets to mediate intercellular
  signaling and inflammatory gene expression by the target leukocytes. Activated platelets
  can also bind to PMNs (see ) and lymphocytes and alter their responses (reviewed
  in Refs.  and ). (D) Activated platelets can signal functional changes in dendritic
  cells using multiple molecular pathways, and can potentially also influence differentiation
  of monocyte precursors to dendritic cells or macrophages (reviewed in Ref. ). This
