caption: Potential role of mitochondrial apoptosis in aging of long-lived cells. During
  aging, mitochondrial ROS production steadily increases, leading to DNA damage and
  the activation of a p53-mediated transcriptional response. p53 transcriptional targets
  include pro-apoptotic genes such as Bak and Bax. p53 also directly triggers mitochondrial
  apoptosis by binding to and promoting the oligomerization of pro-apoptotic Bak protein
  in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Chronic activation of this pathway is likely
  to negatively impact tissues dependent on non-regenerating long-lived cells, such
  as the cochlea, brain, and heart.
