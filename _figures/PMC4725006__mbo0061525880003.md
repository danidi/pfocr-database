caption: STRING analysis reveals an impact of Pka1 regulation on a diverse set of
  proteins as well as a prominent influence on translation and on the ubiquitin proteasome
  pathway. STRING was used to visualize predicted protein-protein interactions for
  the identified 300 Pka1-regulated proteins (http://string-db.org) using the corresponding
  proteins from C. neoformans strain JEC21 in the database (). Several clusters were
  identified from the network mapping, and examples include (i) proteins associated
  with ribosomes and translation, including small-subunit ribosomal protein S13e (CNAG_01153)
  and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F (CNAG_06563); (ii) proteins
  associated with the proteasome, including 26S proteasome regulatory subunit N2 (CNAG_06175)
  and nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit α (CNAG_04985); and (iii) diverse
  proteins associated with metabolism, phosphorylation, and virulence, including urease
  (CNAG_05540) and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) C-acetyltransferase (CNAG_02918). Nodes
  directly linked to the input are indicated with colors other than white, and nodes
  of a higher iteration/depth are indicated with white. Edges or predicted functional
  links consist of up to eight lines, with a different color representing each type
  of evidence (e.g., neighborhood, gene fusion, cooccurrence, coexpression, experiments,
  databases, text mining, and homology).
