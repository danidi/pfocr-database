caption: EGFR forms a homodimer after ligand activation, which results in phosphorylation/activation
  of the intra-cellular kinase domain and a cascade of downstream signaling including
  activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK and phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways that
  are associated with cell growth, differentiation, survival, and invasion. Monoclonal
  antibodies used to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer including cetuximab
  and panitumumab bind to the extracellular portion of EGFR and inhibit signaling
  in some patients. Activating mutations in KRAS occur in ~40% of colorectal cancers
  and are thought to confer resistance to these drugs by bypassing the need for upstream
  EGFR signals. Activating mutations in BRAF – the direct downstream effector of KRAS
  – occur in ~10% of colorectal cancers and also probably confer resistance to anti-EGFR
  monoclonal antibodies. Emerging evidence supports an additional role of oncogenic
  aberrations in the PI3K pathway in cetuximab and panitumumab resistance.
