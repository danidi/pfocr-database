caption: 'Our model of the BRAF mutation positive mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) pathway signaling mechanisms. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  leads to stimulation of SOS1 through GRB2 and SHP2, and consequently triggers RAS
  signaling; in contrast neurofibromin 1 (NF1) can inactivate RAS. RAS activation
  leads to rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) stimulation, and in turn MEK and
  ERK activation. A negative feedback loop can then inhibit RAS signaling. Class I
  BRAF mutations induce a strong activation of the RAF kinase, independent of RAS
  signaling. Combined RAF (dabrafenib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibition was shown to
  effectively lower MAPK signaling and yielded a 64% response rate in non-small-cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Class II BRAF mutations have similar characteristics,
  inducing intermediate to high levels of RAF kinase activation, independent of RAS.
  In this study we have shown that dual RAF and MEK inhibition yielded synergistic
  results at median drug concentrations, while being antagonistic at either low or
  high concentrations. In addition, trametinib or dabrafenib treatment combined with
  SHP2 inhibition (SHP099 or RMC-4550) indicated synergistic interactions. The class
  III BRAF mutations often co-occur with RTK overexpression, RAS activating mutations,
  and/or NF1 loss-of-function mutations, indicating that cell growth depends on RAS
  signaling. For this reason, class III mutations are sensitive to single SHP2 inhibition,
  and combining trametinib or dabrafenib with SHP2 inhibitors showed strong synergy.
  RTKs: receptor tyrosine kinases.'
