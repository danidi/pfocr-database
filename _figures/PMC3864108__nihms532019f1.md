caption: Schematic diagram showing the interaction between NW arenaviruses and host
  innate immune response. Arenavirus NPs possess 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and are
  proposed to degrade viral dsRNA or ssRNA to reduce the exposure of viral RNA to
  RIG-I and MDA-5. Z protein of the New World arenavirus, but not of the Old World
  arenavirus, inhibits RIG-I signaling cascade probably as a result of its direct
  binding to RIG-I protein. NP further interacts with IKKε and inhibits TBK-1/ IKKε
  activation to interfere with phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3 or IRF-7. NP
  prevents activation of NF-κB. It is still unclear whether suppression of TBK-1/
  IKKε complex by NP could directly lead to inhibition of NF-κB activation. On the
  other hand, New World arenavirus JUNV GP is recognized by TLR2 pathway and triggers
  IFN and cytokine production in mouse macrophages.
