caption: T cells and macrophages are separately localized in different zones in the
  spleen. OPN expression is upregulated by LPS in RPMs, and sOPN is secreted from
  LPS-stimulated RPMs in the first 3 h after LPS stimulation. sOPN is detected by
  integrin αv on the CD4+ T cell surface; and T cells start migrating towards macrophages.
  T cells then interact with macrophages to stimulate macrophage CD40 signaling pathway,
  in which intracellular osteopontin (iOPN) is essential for downregulation of macrophage
  TNF production ().
