caption: 'The role of cGAS-STING pathway in anti-tumor immunity. The cGAS-STING pathway
  upregulates multiples steps in cancer-immunity cycle. DNA leakage not only activates
  STING pathway in tumor cell, but also promotes STING activation in dendritic cell
  by DNA uptake or cGAMP transfer. In tumor microenvironment, cGAS-STING in DC plays
  an important role in the cross-presentation and priming of tumor-specific CD8+ T
  cell. Tumor-derived DNA could be taken up by DC like protein antigen, resulting
  in the following upregulation of type I IFN. Type I IFN contributes to most biological
  effects of cGAS-STING pathway on immune cells. Firstly, type I IFN reinforces the
  cross-presentation of DC by promoting antigen retention and CD8α+ DC survival. Besides,
  DC cultured with type I IFN shows increased expression of CCR7 which indicates improved
  lymph node-homing capability. In addition, type I IFN upregulates the expression
  of multiple Th1 chemokines including CXCL9 and CXCL10 which is important for the
  homing of APC and trafficking of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Abbreviations: cGAMP,
  cytosolic GMP-AMP; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  protein 4; CXCL9, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9; IFN, interferon; MHC, major
  histocompatibility complex; PD-1/PD-L1, anti-programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand
  1; TA, tumor antigen; TCR, T cell receptor; Treg, regulatory T cell'
