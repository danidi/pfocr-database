caption: Interaction between glia and neurons may lead to neuron damage and death.
  LPS activates microglia from a resting state to an activated one, probably through
  the CD14 and the TLR4 receptors; this signalling pathway, mediated by different
  molecular adaptors, kinases, and MAP kinases, activates NF-κB with the consequent
  transcription of specific genes leading to microglial activation. Then, activated
  microglial cells release several compounds, as proinflammatory cytokines, radical
  oxygen species (ROS), and NO that may eventually lead to neuronal death. Within
  dopaminergic neurons, the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be affected by several
  substances, leading to energy failure, production of ROS, and reduction of the neurons
  viability. ROS can act as signal for the activation of microglia, indicating that
  neurons are not healthy. DA can exert a toxic action through the ROS formed in its
  oxidative metabolism; it may also forms complexes with cysteine, inhibiting the
  respiratory chain and producing more ROS. The reduction/elimination of microglial
  induction could ameliorate neuronal damage.
