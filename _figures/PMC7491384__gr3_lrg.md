caption: Protein and Essential Amino Acid Restriction Induces the Transsulfuration
  Pathway and the Integrated Stress Response to Regulate Immune ResponseInduction
  of the transsulfuration pathway leads to production of byproducts such as hydrogen
  sulfide, which can reduce NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation and promote and
  maintain regulatory T cell differentiation. Low amino acid availability leads to
  the interaction of amino acid sensors such as Sestrin 2 and SAMTOR with GATOR2 and
  GATOR1, respectively, to restrict mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, sensing of uncharged
  amino acids by GCN2 and lack of glutathione by PERK further inhibits mTORC1 and
  leads to the activation of eIF2α, stress response genes, and autophagy, inhibiting
  NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation and Th17 responses.
