caption: (A) Moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) increases intracellular
  calcium (Ca2+) levels in neurons through the NMDA receptor. Intracellular Ca2+ increases
  the activity of calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII), triggering the activation
  of the MAPK/ERK/MSK cascade signaling, resulting in the increase of the expression
  and phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Finally, CREB
  enhance the Bdnf transcription. This molecular mechanism described above result
  in a higher BDNF protein, the neurotrophin is released by the neuron to induce transcription
  of cognitive genes. The present model is based on Gomez-Pinilla’s studies (). (B)
  MICT enhances the mitochondrial activity in neurons. Higher mitochondrial activity
  increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) from complexes I and III. The change in
  ROS levels modify and regulate a wide of signaling process including the CREB-BDNF
  signaling pathway. Once activated, BDNF regulates a positive feedback mechanism
  to induce the cognitive genes transcription. Additionally, the aerobic exercise
  increases the calcium concentration in neurons; this ion through the calpain and
  xanthine oxidase increases the ROS that consequently increase the CREB’s activation
  and Bdnf expression. (C) Exercise performed at high intensity (≥80% HRmax) activates
  several metabolic pathways in muscle (including glycolysis), this condition generates
  a higher systemic blood lactate concentration reaching the brain, this metabolite
  can be oxidized by astrocytes or neurons to produce glucose (). In addition, experimental
  evidence indicates that lactate increase NMDA activity and intracellular Ca2+ levels
  in neurons. Indeed, it is possible that the lactate in neurons enhance the CaMKII
  activity and the MAPK/ERK/MSK signaling to induce the CREB’s activation and Bdnf
  expression. Finally, the BDNF activate a positive loop to induce the expression
  of cognitive genes ().
