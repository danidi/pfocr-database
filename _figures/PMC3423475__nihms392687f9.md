caption: Animal oral and veg1 ectodermal GRN for sea urchin embryogenesis. Linkages
  identified in this study are incorporated into the current GRN model. Eight genes
  (except vegfr) were included in the network. The figure was created using the Biotapestry
  program. The not gene plays an essential role in replaying nodal signaling pathway
  and patterning of ectodermal gene expression. Not can function both as an activator
  and repressor. It drives the expression of the nk1 and gsc in the veg1 and animal
  ectoderm, restricting target genes in the oral ectoderm. On the other hand, not
  represses the wnt5 and vegf3 genes, clearing their expression from the oral territory.
  nodal and not inputs to downstream genes can be synergistic, as both are required
  form the positive regulation of gsc expression. Additionally, the Nodal signaling
  pathway (through Smad) and not function antagonistically in regulating not and vegf3
  expression.
