caption: Illustration of the proposed role of DNAJA1 and DnaK on the JNK pathway and
  c-Jun phosphorylation. The activation of DNAJA1 through the interaction with DnaK
  appears to suppress the JNK pathway, thus keeping c-Jun in the inactive state. However,
  inhibiting binding of DNAJA1 to DnaK, as TIM16 does, would allow for the hyperphosphorylation
  of c-Jun, which has an anti-apoptotic effect.
