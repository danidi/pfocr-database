caption: 'Fate of 13C and 15N from fully labeled glutamine through the TCA cycle and
  ACL-ME pathway. Redrawn from ref (). Red: 13C fate from glutamine in the first forward
  TCA turn; Light green: 15N; light blue: 13C derived from the glutamine tracer via
  the ATP-citrate lyase (ACL)-malic enzyme (ME) pathway in the cytoplasm; orange:
  13C labeling of citrate+5 from reductive carboxylation (RedC); Green: 13C labeling
  of TCA cycle intermediates catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase (PC); double headed
  arrows: reversible reactions; dashed arrows: multiple step reactions; not all possible
  13C isotopologues of the cycle intermediates are shown; the 13C isotopologues of
  malate, fumarate, and succinate depicted include those from the reverse direction
  of OAA to succinate.'
