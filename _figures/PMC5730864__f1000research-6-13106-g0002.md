caption: The PED compounds CA (with adjacent or “ ortho-” position hydroxyl groups)
  , , ,  and ZO (with hydroxyl groups located directly across the ring, in the “ para-”
  position) ,  become oxidized to the electrophilic quinone form. CA and ZO quinones
  undergo nucleophilic attack by a critical KEAP1 cysteine thiol. The reaction forms
  a KEAP1-CA or KEAP1-ZO adduct. This results in release of NRF2 from KEAP1/NRF2 complexes,
  accumulation of NRF2 in the nucleus, and subsequent transcriptional activation of
  phase II enzymes , . Phase II anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes reduce
  reactive oxygen species and thus improve the resilience of neurons. Importantly,
  the oxidation of hydroquinone (PED) to quinone (EP) is triggered by oxidative stress,
  which is then combatted by this transcriptional activity, as described in the text
