caption: Hypothetical pathways through which albumin overload promotes renal fibrosis
  via epigenetic regulation of miR-184. Albumin reduces binding of MeCP2 to miR-184
  promoter and fosters histone lysine acetylation (Ac), favouring accessibility of
  NF-κB-p65 to its recognition sequence on the miRNA promoter. This results in miR-184
  upregulation and repression of the downstream target LPP3, which in turn upregulates
  Pai-1 transcription through the β-catenin (β-Cat)–TCF signalling pathway in a cAMP
  response-element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP)-dependent fashion
