caption: Eukaryotic cellular systems targeted by phytopathogenic type III secreted
  effectors (T3SEs). Bacterial phytopathogens use T3SEs (yellow boxes) to inhibit
  upstream signalling components such as targeting FLS2 for proteasome degradation
  (AvrPtoB), prevent the phosphorylation of BAK1 (AvrAC and AvrPto), or degrade BIK1
  (HopAR1). In addition, phytopathogen T3SEs can inhibit the phosphorylation of downstream
  signalling components such as the MAPKKs (HopF2) and MAPKs (HopAI1). Two nuclear-localized
  T3SEs, AvrBs3 and XopD, bind to DNA and alter transcription in plant cells. Specifically,
  AvrBS3 is a transcription activator that binds to the UPA box of its target genes.
  XopD represses the activities of a eukaryotic transcription factor, MYB30, which
  consequently suppresses the transcription of plant immune response genes. HopU1
  targets RNA-binding proteins such as AtGRP7, which alters RNA processing in the
  plant host. HopM1 targets a plant ARF–GEF (AtMIN7) for degradation by the proteasome
  and consequently inhibit the secretory pathway. HopZ1a is the first bacterial phytopathogen
  T3SE shown to bind to plant tubulin and causes microtubule destruction. In addition,
  HopZ1a inhibits the plant secretory pathway. Lastly, the HopAR1-elicited plant immune
  response requires an actin regulator, ADF4. However, the link between HopAR1 and
  ADF4 or HopAR1 and actin is currently unclear.
