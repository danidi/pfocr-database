caption: 'Schematic presentation of the pathways of glycolysis modified from Ref.
  (). The main points of the glycolysis chains involved in Tarui disease and McArdle
  disease are presented. The pathways may pass forward or backward. The black arrow
  indicates that glycolysis disrupted by Tarui disease can continue through pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) at glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate. The dotted arrow: fructose
  6-phosphate accumulates because of Tarui disease, and its metabolism may continue
  in the PPP pathway, from where it may enter in protein or nucleic acid synthesis.
  Increase of synthesis of proteins or nucleotides means also increase of products
  of their metabolism, increasing, e.g., the production of ammonia. Some enzyme names
  and products of the glycolysis chain have been left away to get the figure more
  feasible to the present purpose. UDPG, uridine diphosphoglucose.'
