caption: 'Signaling pathways of the main cytokines involved in cardiovascular diseases.
  Four main cytokines have been extensively investigated in cardiovascular diseases:
  tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-10. The intracellular
  signaling pathways of TNF-α and IL-1 (panel A) converge on two main transcription
  factors: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
  and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Their overall effect is pro-inflammatory. The receptor
  of TNF-α has two isoforms (TNFR1 and -2). The transduction of signal of TNFR1 is
  driven by the TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which activates the
  mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs), namely the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases
  1 and 2 (ERK 1/2), the cJun-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38. In turn, the MAPKs
  activate c-Jun and phosphorylate the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), determining the activation
  of NF-κB and AP-1. TNFR1 can also activate the protein-kinase C (PKC), that is a
  Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase, that promotes the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton
  and blunts the contractility of sarcomeres in cardiomyocytes. The transduction of
  signal of TNFR2 is driven by the TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and the endothelial/epithelial
  tyrosine kinase (ETK). TRAF2 activates the IκB kinase α (IKKα), which phosphorylates
  IκB and activates NF-κB through the non-canonical pathway, having a final immune-modulatory
  effect, whereas the canonical pathway leads to apoptosis, increase of oxidative
  stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling. ETK activates the adaptor protein Akt through
  the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), and eventually activates NF-κB through the
  non-canonical pathway. IL-1 has two main isoforms, IL-1α and IL-1β, which interact
  with the same receptor. The intracellular signaling pathway of IL-1 is driven by
  the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), which activates multiple kinases,
  named interleukin-1-associated kinases (IRAKs), which in turn activate multiple
  IKKs and the activation of NF-κB through the canonical pathway. The intracellular
  signaling pathways of IL-6 and IL-10 (panel B) converge on two main transcription
  factors: NF-κB and the family of signal transducers and activators of transcription
  (STAT). The overall effect of IL-6 is pro-inflammatory, whereas IL-10 is the main
  anti-inflammatory cytokine in humans. IL-6 receptor α (IL-6Rα) can be bound to the
  cell membrane or free in a soluble form (sIL-6Rα). The transduction of signal is
  initiated by the binding of the receptor with the glycoprotein 130 (gp130), and
  it may follow two main pathways: the Janus kinase (JAK) pathway and the Ras pathway,
  through the adaptor proteins Shc. and Son-of-sevenless (SOS). Ras activates the
  MAPKs’ cascade (namely Raf, MEK 1/2, and ERK 1/2), which activates NF-κB through
  the canonical pathway. Ras can also activate the PI3K/Akt cascade and NF-κB through
  the non-canonical pathway. JAK phosphorylates Akt, which in turn promotes migration
  of STAT inside the nucleus, where it can exert its transcriptional function. The
  activation of STAT has an overall anti-inflammatory effect, and it inhibits the
  JAK signaling through a negative feedback mechanism, mediated by the suppressor
  of cytokine signaling (SOCS). The signaling of IL-10 can be mediated by JAK, through
  the pathway described above, or through the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). Both pathways
  converge on STAT'
