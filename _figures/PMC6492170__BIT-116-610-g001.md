caption: Schematic representation of iron metabolism in the yeast model. Pathways
  and metabolites are represented by uppercase and lowercase letters, respectively.
  Directionality of the fluxes through the pathway is specified by arrows (for single
  reaction steps) and block arrows (for lumped consecutive reaction steps). Metabolic
  enzymes are shown in teal colour. The cell and organelle boundaries are represented
  as double dashed lines; the mitochondrion, nucleus, vacuole and ER have cartoon
  representations. The minimal representation of iron metabolism in the existing Yeast
  7.6 model is provided in (a). The details on the reductive, non‐reductive and xenosiderophore‐bound
  iron uptake, intracellular transport and storage of iron, haem and sirohaem biosynthetic
  and degradation pathways are provided in (b). Details regarding the biogenesis of
  Fe‐S clusters in the mitochondrion (ISC machinery), and the maturation of apoenzymes
  (A) into Fe‐S cluster‐bound holoenzymes (H) in the mitochondrion (ISC machinery),
  in the cytosol and in the nucleus (CIA machinery) are provided in (c). An empty
  scaffold (ES) and its sulphonylated form (SS) were introduced as pseudometabolites
  in the Fe‐S cluster formation mechanism. The regulation of iron uptake via the iron
  regulon, employing the negative feedback from Fe‐S cluster biogenesis, is demonstrated
  in (d). The shuttling of the signals representing the availability of mitochondrial
  iron (PS) and its depletion (AS) were introduced as pseudo‐metabolites to modulate
  and activate the reductive iron uptake routes. For simplifications of the function
  and activity of the iron regulon, see text [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
