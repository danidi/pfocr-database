caption: Model of HOG activation by heat-shock. Heat-shock stimulates glycerol efflux
  by at least two paths. One, independent of the glycerolporin Fps1, might be directly
  through the phospholipid bilayer. The other, Fps1-dependent, requires the activation
  of the CWI Pkc1-Slt2 pathway. Efflux increases when there is a large chemical gradient
  driving glycerol out, which happens when yeast grow in high osmolarity medium. Glycerol
  efflux causes reduced turgor pressure what in turn stimulates the Sln1 branch (Ssk1)
  of HOG. Activated Hog1 induces gene expression (PSTL1-YFP) and glycerol synthesis,
  which maintains a high chemical gradient, closing the circle.
