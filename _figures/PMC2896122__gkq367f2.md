caption: The example of the further mapping onto metabolic pathways. An area, where
  the compounds similar with C05431 (neurosporene) have been frequently found, can
  be easily detected by the red colored compounds (indicated by the dashed line in
  this figure). This means that a neurosporene and its derivatives are likely to be
  located around the gateway of the ‘Carotenoid biosynthesis’ pathway (map00906).
  Actually, they are important intermediates for generating carotenoids.
