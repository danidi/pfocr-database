caption: 'Proposed underlying mechanism for the effect of SCE on drug metabolizing
  enzymes and drug transporters via Nrf2-mediated signaling pathway. Taken together,
  our findings have shown that pretreatment of human hepatocellular liver carcinoma
  cell line cells with SCE increased Nrf2 stability and half-life, mainly via downregulation
  of Keap1 and inhibition of Nrf2 degradation.Abbreviations: SCE, Schisandra chinensis
  extract; Nrf2, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1; ARE, antioxidant response element; NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
  1; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; GSTA4, glutathione S-transferase A4; GCLM, glutamate–cysteine
  ligase, modifier subunit; GSTs, glutathione S-transferases; P-gp, P-glycoprotein;
  MRPs, multidrug resistance-associated proteins; OATP, organic anion transporting
  polypeptide.'
