caption: A cartoon illustrates genomic and nongenomic actions of VDR signaling in
  inhibition of human CYP7A1 gene transcription in human hepatocytes. VDR ligands,
  1α,25(OH)2-D3, or LCA stimulate intracellular translocation of VDR to both the plasma
  membranes. VDR ligands induce tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation of VDR and activate c-Src.
  VDR interacts with c-Src in the plasma membrane. Membrane VDR signaling activates
  c-Raf, probably through activation of the Shc/Grb2/Sos complex and Ras (data not
  shown), which then activates c-Raf and subsequently the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 MAPK pathway.
  VDR is also translocated to the nucleus through interaction with a heat shock protein
  70, independent of the tyrosine kinase pathway. ERK1/2 is translocated to the nucleus
  and subsequently phosphorylates the serine/threonine (S/T) residues on nuclear VDR,
  RXRα, and HNF4α. The VDR/RXRα recruits corepressor NCoR-1 or SMRT to the BARE to
  displace the HNF4α/VDR/PGC-1α or SRC-1 complex and results in inactivating the CYP7A1
  gene. It should be noted that NCoR-1/SMRT is recruited to RXRα that dimerizes with
  ligand-activated VDR. VDR interacts with HNF4α and prevents HNF4α from dimerization
  and binding to the BARE.
