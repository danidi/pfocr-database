caption: Mechanisms of bile acid and cytokine inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription.
  Bile acids induce IL-1β synthesis and release from Kupffer cells. These cytokines
  activate JNK pathway in hepatocytes. The JNK pathway inhibits CYP7A1 via three possible
  mechanisms. 1) JNK inhibits HNF4α mRNA and protein expressions. 2) JNK phosphorylates
  HNF4α and reduces its DNA binding and trans-activation activity. 3) JNK induces
  c-Jun, which interacts with HNF4α and blocks HNF4α interaction with PGC-1α and results
  in inhibition of CYP7A1.
