caption: Schematic illustrating how Nrf-2 activation regulates phenotypic modulation.
  Under oxidative-stimulating conditions, Nrf-2 is activated and translocates into
  the nucleus. Nrf-2 signal pathway activation promotes expression of VSMC-specific
  markers SM22α and αSMA. The underlying mechanism may be that Nrf-2 upregulates expression
  levels of its downstream antioxidant enzymes and inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines
