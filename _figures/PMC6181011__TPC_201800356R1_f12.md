caption: Schematic Model of Sugar Supply to Pollen Tubes. Sucrose delivered into cells
  of the stigma or transmitting tissue of the style from source tissues is unloaded
  into the apoplast via SWEET9/SWEET10 or cleaved by intracellular invertases. Sucrose
  can either be taken up into pollen tubes via SUC transporters or its monosaccharide
  components are taken up after cleavage by cell wall invertases (cwINV) through PMTs
  and STPs. Sucrose and monosaccharides derived from extracellular invertase activity
  contribute to pollen tube growth as signaling molecules, osmotic components or substrates
  for glycolysis and cell wall synthesis. Release of additional glucose from pistil
  cells via SWEET1 increases the glucose to fructose ratio in the apoplastic space.
  After uptake into pollen tubes via STPs glucose activates a signaling pathway through
  HXK1 localized at mitochondria or in the nucleus. Eventually, this results in the
  deceleration of pollen tube growth. Activated HXK1 additionally downregulates expression
  of STP4, STP8, and STP10. In the equimolar presence of glucose and fructose, the
  glucose signaling pathway is repressed.
