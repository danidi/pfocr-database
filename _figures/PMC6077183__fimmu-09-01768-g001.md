caption: Ontogeny of Langerhans cells (LCs) during steady state. The first wave of
  LCs that reside in the skin are from the yolk sac (YS) progenitors (green). They
  populate the skin but are unable to mature fully. At embryonic stage, LCs are immature
  due to the lack of signals from keratinocytes such as interleukin-34 (IL-34) and
  transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). LCs have shown to have the capability to produce
  TGF-β. TGF-β derived from LCs acts directly on LCs through the autocrine/paracrine
  signaling pathway. At around E11.5, fetal liver progenitors (purple) start to populate
  the skin and, similar to the YS progenitors, they are still immature and sparsely
  distributed. Differentiation into LC has been observed from E18.5 onward, at the
  same time when keratinocytes start to fully differentiate. Upon birth, LCs have
  been observed to proliferate to form LC network. During steady state, LCs maintain
  their network by the low level of proliferation without much contribution from monocytes
  derived from the bone marrow. Figure adapted from Ginhoux et al. ().
