caption: In the event of single stranded breaks or fork stalling ATR is activated
  and RPA (Replication Protein A) binds to the exposed strands. ATR then phosphorylates
  RAD17, the 9-1-1 complex and TopBP1 (Topoisomerase IIβ Binding Protein 1), as well
  as CHK1 which amplifies the signal and mediates cell cycle arrest via Cdc25a. At
  double strand breaks (DSBs) the chromatin structure surrounding the break is dynamically
  re-structured, exemplified by ATM dependent phosphorylation of H2AX and modification
  of adjacent chromatin. The sensing of the DSB by the MRN complex triggers targeting
  of downstream mediators and activation of DNA repair pathways. The key event is
  the ATM dependent activation of CHK2 and p53, inducing arrest in G1 and G2/M phases
  of the cell cycle. Failure to repair results in permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence
  or apoptosis.(B) DNA Repair Pathways. The two primary pathways for the DNA repair
  are NHEJ and HR. NHEJ is the major pathway as it functions throughout the cell cycle.
  NHEJ requires sensing of the lesion by Ku70/80, activation of the DNA-PK (DNA dependent
  Protein Kinase) complex and 3’-5’ endonucleolytic resection of the break site. The
  break is then filled in by DNA Polymerases υ and λ and the repaired ends are fused
  by DNA Ligase IV. However, NHEJ is error-prone and defects in NHEJ are frequently
  linked with cancer. If DNA is damaged during S-phase the cell employs the error
  free HR pathway. ATM and MRN mediate recognition and resection of the break, the
  ssDNA overhang is detected by ATR and RPA, which promote association of RAD51/RAD52.
  The HR machinery mediates the synthesis of a new DNA strand using the overhang sequence
  as template. This mechanism ensures that the original DNA sequence can be faithfully
  restored and genetic integrity is maintained.
