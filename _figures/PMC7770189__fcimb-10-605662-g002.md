caption: Pan and CoA antimetabolites. (A) Pantoyltaurine 13 and its amides 14 were
  some of the first Pan antimetabolites tested for antibacterial activity. (B) The
  fungal natural product CJ-15,801 15 is a Pan antimetabolite that is activated via
  phosphorylation by PanK; its phosphate 16 subsequently inhibits PPCS. (C) Pan antimetabolites
  that are structurally similar to the CoA degradation product PantSH 6 can hijack
  the CoA salvage pathway enzymes to be transformed into CoA antimetabolites. For
  example, the pantothenamide N7-Pan 17 is phosphorylated by PanK to form 18, which
  is then converted into 19 by PPAT and DPCK. These compounds can inhibit the biosynthesis
  of CoA in several ways, e.g., by competing with the natural substrates for access
  to the biosynthetic enzymes, by causing the build-up of biosynthetic intermediates
  that may regulate the enzymes through feedback inhibition, and by causing such feedback
  inhibition directly by mimicking the structures of the intermediate. Meanwhile,
  the CoA antimetabolites themselves can inhibit any CoA-dependent enzyme.
