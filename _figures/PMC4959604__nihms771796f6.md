caption: Canonical Notch signaling was activated through cleavage by TACE and γ-secretase
  and release the Notch intracellular fragments (NIC). NIC translocated to the nucleus
  and then binded with CSL to direct target genes expression. LKB1, one kind of upstream
  AMPK phosphorylating kinase initiated AMPK activation and AMPK phosphorylated ACC,
  whose process keeps the balanced between the Fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis
  during myocardial ischemia. Crosstalk between Notch and AMPK can occur through binding
  of LKB1 to NIC and activation of ACC. Collectively, these findings shed light on
  the new strategies for prevention of ischemic heart disease.
