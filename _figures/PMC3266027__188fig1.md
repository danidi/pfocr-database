caption: Activation of EGFR signaling in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can occur
  via disruption of several different components at multiple levels of the pathway.
  (A) Different proteins in the EGFR pathway can be activated (red) or inactivated
  (blue) by underlying genetic or epigenetic changes at the DNA level, leading to
  aberrant pathway activity and oncogenic signaling in NSCLC. Examples of key oncogenes
  affected include EGFR, RAS, PIK3CA, and AKT. Conversely, examples of tumor suppressors
  that are inactivated include PTEN and RASSF1. (B) Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms
  responsible for the disruption of genes in the EGFR signaling pathway in NSCLC include
  DNA copy number alterations (amplification or deletion), point mutations, and DNA
  methylation changes. Thus, it is important to consider multiple aspects of the genome
  and epigenome simultaneously to elucidate the mechanisms driving pathway deregulation.
