caption: 'A working model of Lhx2‐induced tumor progression. Canonical TGFβ signaling
  induces the expression of Lhx2 in tumor cells. Concomitantly, PDGFRβ expression
  in tumor cells is upregulated independently of Lhx2 by non‐canonical TGFβ signaling.
  Lhx2 directly induces expression of PDGF‐B which in turn activates PDGFRβ signaling
  via two mechanisms: (i) tumor cell‐produced PDGF‐B binds to PDGFRβ on tumor cells
  and promotes tumor cell migration and invasion in an autocrine signaling pathway
  and (ii) PDGF‐B binds PDGFRβ expressed on pericytes in a paracrine manner and promotes
  blood vessel maturation and functionality leading ultimately to an improved delivery
  of oxygen and nutrients and thus to increased tumor growth.'
