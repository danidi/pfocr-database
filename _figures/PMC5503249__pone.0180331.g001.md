caption: 'This pathway catabolizes D-glucose (Glc) to pyruvate (Pyr) and has two distinct
  branches: the semi-phosphorylative (spED) in blue and the non-phosphorylative (npED)
  in green. Both branches incorporate regulatory mechanisms (red lines). Black lines
  represent the common branches of the network and gray lines represent ADP/ATP phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  and NADP/NADPH redox-reactions.'
