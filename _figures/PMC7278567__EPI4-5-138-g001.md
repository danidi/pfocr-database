caption: Neurodegenerative pathways in acquired epilepsy. A brain insult triggers
  a cascade of mechanisms that may be involved in the development of acquired epilepsy,
  and five neurodegenerative pathways implicated in the development of acquired epilepsy,
  (1) AMPA mechanisms, (2) tau‐based mechanisms, (3) amyloid‐β pathways, (4) mTOR
  pathway, and (5) neuroinflammatory mediators, are reviewed in this manuscript as
  they represent potential targets for drug development
