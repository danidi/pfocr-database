caption: Nerve growth factor (NGF) and its Tyrosine Kinase A receptor (TRKA) are involved
  in several signaling pathways in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Ovarian cancer
  cells express and secrete NGF. Through TRKA activation, NGF induces angiogenesis
  by directly stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and migration. NGF also regulates
  angiogenesis in an indirect manner through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  production by epithelial cancer cells. This mechanism involves TRKA activation and
  the Mitogen-activated protein kinase/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK)
  signaling pathway. Besides, NGF increases ciclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) levels, a proinflamatory
  molecule that induces protaglandine-2 (PGE-2) production; COX-2 and PGE-2 have been
  associated with invasion in cancer cells. NGF can also increase calreticulin (CRT)
  levels (Red Arrow), an endoplasmic reticulum resident whose levels have been found
  to be elevated in several cancers, where it participates in cell survival and invasion.
  Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), a proteinase,
  also seems to be regulated by NGF-TRKA activation. ADAM17 cleaves the p75 receptor,
  which is then cleaved a second time by γ-secretase. The biological effects of these
  cuts remain unknown. ADAM 17 can also cleave TRKA, leaving its intracellular domain
  active, which contributes to cancer progression through the MAPKs and PI3K/Akt pathways.
