caption: The cofilin pathway is activated in tumour cells by stimuli in the microenvironment,
  such as epidermal growht factor (EGF), detected by the EGF receptor (EGFR) and an
  unidentified subunit of the ErbB family, which could be either ERBB2 or ERBB3. In
  animal models ERBB2 has been shown to have a large potentiating effect on EGF-stimulated
  protrusion and cell migration in mammary tumours. EGFR heterodimers, with either
  ERBB2 or ERBB3, can activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and then a group
  of small G-proteins (Rho, CDC42 (cell division cycle 42) and Rac) and their cofilin-regulating
  kinases (ROCK1 and Pak). These kinases stimulate LIM kinase (LIMK) to phosphorylate
  cofilin (P-cofilin), thereby inactivating it. And phosphatases such as slingshot
  (SSH), chronophin, type 1, 2A and 2B phosphatases, can dephosphorylate cofilin upon
  activation making it potentially active (if not bound to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) and if the pH is above 7.0). Although SSH can be activated by F-actin binding
  and phosphorylation by PAK4 in vitro, the mechanism for chronophin activation, is
  currently unknown. In addition, EGFR–ERBB2 can activate phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)
  which is proposed to activate cofilin by the hydrolysis of PIP2 (REF. ), thereby
  releasing cofilin from the cell membrane. Cofilin activated by either path severs
  mother filaments (older pre-existing filaments) to produce free barbed ends leading
  to the elongation of newly polymerized actin filaments that are preferred for dendritic
  nucleation by the ARP2/3 complex () and G-actin resulting from the depolymerization
  of pointed ends produced by the same severing reaction. In invasive tumour cells,
  subunits of the ARP2/3 complex are coordinately overexpressed along with genes of
  the cofilin pathway,, thereby potentially increasing the synergistic interaction
  between the cofilin and ARP2/3 complex to cause dendritic nucleation, which pushes
  on the cell membrane to cause cell protrusion,. The ARP2/3 complex is activated
  by members of the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family, including WAVE2
  and NWASP. NWASP is known to be activated in invadopodia, under the regulation of
  CDC42 and Rho and/or Src-mediated phosphorylation. The cofilin pathway is coordinately
  regulated in invasive tumour cells during cell migration in vivo (genes that are
  upregulated in rat mammary tumours are highlighted in bold), suggesting that the
  cofilin pathway (which is shown in red boxes and circles) has a direct role in determining
  the invasive and metastatic phenotype.
