caption: 'Five domains of T-cell dysfunction. Clockwise from top left—Senescence:
  a Repetitive T-cell proliferation/activation and DNA damage events cause telomere
  shortening, decreasing the proliferative capacity of effector T-cells. b Thymic
  involution develops prematurely in patients with GBM, reducing T-cell output from
  the thymus. Tolerance: Gliomas induce T-cell apotosis via the FasL-Fas pathway,
  as well as generate proliferation of Tregs, which have suppressive effects on effector
  T-cells. Exhaustion: After repeated exposure under suboptimal conditions, T-cells
  end up expressing inhibitory immune checkpoints, with the major ones shown here.
  The degree of exhaustion is correlated with expression of specific checkpoints.
  Anergy: T-cell anergy can be caused by two broad mechanisms: insufficient co-stimulation
  leading to clonal anergy and impairment of T-cell activation, and continuous low
  level antigen exposure, leading to adaptive tolerance and reduced T-cell proliferation.
  Ignorance: T-cell ignorance is the result of fully functional T-cells that are prevented
  from antigen exposure by anatomical barriers or insufficient antigen expression
  levels, such as is the case with the blood brain barrier and T-cell sequestration.
