caption: Mtb-infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis express annexin1 on the cell
  surface, which acts as an engulfment ligand. Bystander macrophages recognize this
  ligand and engulf apoptotic cells/vesicles containing live bacteria via efferocytosis
  to eliminate Mtb. Similarly, DCs recognize annexin1 and uptake apoptotic vesicles
  containing mycobacterial antigens. Mtb antigens are processed and loaded on MHC-I
  via cross-presentation. The presence of annexin1 on efferosomes, as well as in cytosol,
  may facilitate cross-presentation by increasing the availability of antigens in
  efferosomes to MHC-I, either via proteasome-ER–dependent pathway or/and vacular-dependent
  pathway (effero-lysosome). This will result in CD8+ T cell activation and expansion
  to control Mtb infection.
