caption: Schematic diagram of IL-6 signalling events. IL-6 specifically binds to IL-6
  receptor α (IL-6Rα), and recruits a homodimer of the gp130 signal-transducing protein
  (). This in turn leads to association of the JAK kinases JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 with
  gp130, and the autophosphorylation of these kinases (). JAK1 is of particular importance
  in IL-6 signalling, and cells deficient in this kinase exhibit substantial signalling
  impairment (; ; ). Following JAK activation, gp130 is phosphorylated on multiple
  tyrosine residues, enabling recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT family transcripton
  factors. STAT3 is the major transcription factor acting downstream of IL-6 signalling,
  and dimerises upon phosphorylation and translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription
  of an array of target genes (; ). IL-6 also activates the MAPK pathway, via JAK
  phosphorylation of SHP2 (SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase). SHP2
  is thought to recruit either the Grb2-SOS (growth factor receptor-bound protein/Son
  of Sevenless) complex and/or Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder 1) to gp130. Recruitment
  of SOS then enables activation of Ras and subsequently the MAPK (mitogen-associated
  protein kinase) pathway, although the importance of this pathway is currently unclear
  (; ).
