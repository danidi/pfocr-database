caption: '(A) Synthesis and release of active TGF-β (adapted from ()). In the endoplasmic
  reticulum, each pro-TGF-β molecule is assembled into a dimer via three interchain
  disulfide bonds. Following cleavage by the endoprotease Furin, the C-terminal fragment
  remains non-covalently associated with the disulfide-linked LAP homodimer. This
  molecule is termed the small latent complex. Three main mechanisms of release of
  active TGF-β are represented: (i) Extracellular protease cleavage of LAP domain.
  (ii) Tethering of small latent complex to extracellular matrix through LTBP1 and
  release of active TGF-beta by integrin-transmitted tension upon cell contraction.
  (iii) Tethering of small latent complex to GARP on the cell surface and release
  of active TGF-beta by integrins. (B) Signal transduction by TGF-β. The fundamental
  steps of ligand-induced formation of a paired-kinase receptor complex, and receptor-mediated
  phosphorylation of R-SMAD proteins for the formation of a trimeric receptor complex
  are shown. The accessory receptor proteoglycan Betaglycan (BG) presents TGF-β to
  the signaling receptors. In the nucleus, the activated SMAD heterotrimeric complex
  binds to target cis-regulatory sites as determined by interactions with lineage-determining
  transcription factors (LDTFs) and other signal-driven transcription factors (SDTFs).
  CDK8 and CDK9 phophorylate SMADs in this complex for further activation and eventual
  degradation. SMAD phosphatases (not shown) reverse these phosphorylation, and PARP-mediated
  parylation causes SMAD dissociation from DNA. The inhibitory SMAD7 recruits SMURF
  ubiquitin ligases to target the receptor for degradation, whereas ubiquitin specific
  peptidases USP11 and USP15 counterbalance this process.'
