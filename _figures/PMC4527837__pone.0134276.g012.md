caption: 'Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) consist of a protein core and heparan
  sulfate (HS) chains consisting of linear carbohydrate chains of repeating disaccharide
  units. Dependent on the HSPG core protein, HSPGs are found at the cell surface (1),
  in the extracellular matrix (2), or in secretory vesicles []. Essential for their
  function in cell signaling, the HS chains undergo extensive post-translational modifications,
  including sulfation on the 6-O- position of glucosamine []. By removing 6-O-sulfates
  on HS chains and mobilizing protein ligands from HSPG sequestration in the extracellular
  environment (3), the SULF-2 can increase the solubility of a variety of growth factors
  (e.g. PDGF) (4) thus increasing the activation of PDGFR-α and downstream signaling
  pathways in tumor cells (5) []. Similarly to SULF2, decorin is also associated to
  the PDGFRα pathway. Interestingly, decorin does not co-localize with PDGFRα, but
  binds directly to its natural ligand PDGF, directly blocking the activity of PDGFRα
  (6) []. Our current data showed that OKN-007 was able to decrease the immunoexpression
  of SULF2 (7) and PDGFRα (8), and increase the expression of decorin (9) in IC3752
  pGBM tumor bearing mice, which may be also associated to the inhibition of tumor
  angiogenesis and cell proliferation (10) also observed in OKN-007 treated animals.
