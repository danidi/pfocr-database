caption: Schematic representation of the possible approaches for MASTL therapeutic
  targeting and the expected biological outcomes from each strategy. (A) Inhibition
  of MASTL kinase activity could lead to decreased MASTL autophosphorylation [] and
  attenuation of the MASTL- Endosulfine alpha (ENSA)/ cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein
  19 (ARPP19)- Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) pathway, cell proliferation, and tumor
  growth. (B) Targeted degradation of MASTL could lead to decreased cancer cell invasion
  and metastasis via reduced Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (GEF-H1) expression
  and myocardin related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) activity. (C) Inhibition of
  the interaction between MASTL and MRTF-A could lead to decreased MRTF-A activity,
  and, thus, reduced cancer cell motility.
