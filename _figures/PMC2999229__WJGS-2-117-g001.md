caption: 'Hypothetical model for the molecular signaling pathways of vasculogenic
  mimicry in tumors and anti-vasculogenic mimicry (VM) therapy strategies. (1) The
  down-regulation of BMP-4 activity can lead to reduce expression of EphA2 and VE-cad;
  (2) TEL regulate VM by synergizing with signaling pathways downstream of RAS; (3)
  Celecoxib, COX-2 inhibition, may inhibit vascular channel formation, which is abrogated
  by addition of PGE2; (4) cAMP inhibits VM by activating Epac/Rap1 which produces
  Rap1-GTP; (5) Activation of Nodal signaling supports VM and expression of the VE-cad.
  Inhibition of the Nodal signaling pathway results in a reduction in keratin and
  VE-cad; (6) Knockdown of Id2 expression can inhibit VE-cad expression and abrogate
  the formation of tubular networks; (7) Gal-3 silencing can result decrease of VE-cadherin
  activities due to enhanced recruitment of EGR-1; (8) The decreasing in Gal-1 expression
  can provoke a marked decrease in BEX2, which impairs vasculogenic mimicry channel
  formation; (9) Over-expression of Mig-7 increased γ2 chain domain III fragments.
  Laminin 5 is the only laminin that contains the γ2 chain, which following cleavage
  into promigratory fragments, the domain III region, causes increased levels of MMP-2,
  and MT1-MMP cooperate to cleave γ2 chain into fragments that promote tumor cell
  VM; (10) Hypoxia→VEGF→EphA2→MMPs→VM; (11) VE-cadherin can promote the interaction
  between FAK and EphA2, phosphorylated EphA2 can form an interaction with FAK, which
  would lead to phosphorylation and activation of FAK. The signal transduction pathways
  activated through VE-cad and EphA2 can converge, resulting in activation of PI3K;
  (12) PI3K regulates MT1-MMP activity, which promotes the conversion of pro-MMP into
  its active conformation through an interaction with TIMP-2. Both enzymatically active
  MT1-MMP and MMP-2 may then promote the cleavage of the laminin 5(Ln-5) γ2 chain
  in pro-migratory γ2, and γ2x fragments, the deposition of these fragments into tumor
  extracellular milieu may result in VM formation; (13) Blockade of TFPI-2 is able
  to suppress MMP-2 activation and prevent VM formation. Moreover, TFPI-1 has anticoagulant
  function of relevance for perfusion of VM; (14) Several drugs express specific anti-VM
  effects. Genistein inhibits VE-cad expression; COL-3 inhibits VE-cad, MMP-2 and
  MT1-MMP expression respectively. Doxycycline inhibits MMP-2 expression. Thalidomide
  inhibits MMP-2 and VEGF expression. In addition, forskolin inhibits VM formation
  through MAPK and PI3K pathway. VM: Vasculogenic mimicry; COX: Cyclooxygenase; VE-cad:
  Vascular endothelial-cadherin; MMPs: Matrix metalloproteinase; EphA2: Epithelial
