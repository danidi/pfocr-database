caption: Proposed pathways of CA-mediated protective effect on PTX-induced proliferative
  inhibition in NSCLC cells. PTX is well-known for inducing the disturbance of mitosis,
  and PTX inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells in the study. Pre-treatment of
  CA facilitates the increased level and nuclear translocation of transcription factor
  NF-κB. The activation of NF-κB up-regulates the expression of its downstream genes
  Bcl-2 and survivin. On the contrary, p53 may antagonize the protective effect of
  NF-κB, and therefore attenuates the expression of Bcl-2 and survivin. Eventually,
  the increased proteins of Bcl-2 and survivin play protective roles in PTX-treated
  cancer cells, and attenuate the anti-proliferation effect of PTX on lung cancer
  cells.
