caption: DSBs induced by ionizing radiation (IR) or chemotherapeutic agents are recognized
  by the Ku70/80 heterodimer which then recruits DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase,
  catalytic subunit) resulting in activation of the latter. Activated DNA-PKcs phosphorylates
  itself and other proteins involved in repair or damage signaling. Following DNA-end
  processing by nucleases (such as Artemis and WRN) and DNA polymerases (such as pol
  λ and pol μ), the ends are ligated together by a complex of XRCC4 (X-ray repair
  complementing defective repair in Chinese-hamster cells 4), DNA ligase IV, and XLF
  (XRCC4-like factor, also called Cernunnos). The exact choreography of events at
  a break and the precise nature of the protein sub-complexes that participate in
  the repair process may be flexible. As the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is essential
  for NHEJ, small molecule inhibitors that bind to and block the kinase domain of
  DNA-PKcs are very potent radiosensitizers.
