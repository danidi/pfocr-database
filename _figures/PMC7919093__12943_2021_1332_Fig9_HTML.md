  of representative resected tumors from four groups of xenografted nude mice on the
  36th day. b Tumor volumes were monitored during the 36-d time course. c The expression
  levels of circWAC, miR-142 and WWP1 in tumor tissues were determined by qRT-PCR.
  d The levels of WWP1 and pS473-AKT in tumor tissues were detected by Western blotting.
  e H&E staining was performed to evaluate tissue morphology, and IHC was performed
  to visualize WWP1 and pS473-AKT. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
