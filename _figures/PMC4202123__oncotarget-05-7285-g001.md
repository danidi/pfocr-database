caption: Ras signaling is involved in numerous cellular functions, including cell
  proliferation, apoptosis, migration, fate specification, and differentiation. A
  key Ras effector pathway is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Raf-MEK-ERK
  pathway. EGF binds to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The signal is transmitted through the
  transmembrane domain resulting in EGFR dimerization and activation. Activated EGFR
  recruits the son of sevenless (SOS), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF),
  to its phosphorylated C-terminal tail via the adaptor proteins, SH2-adaptor protein
  (SHC) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). GEF exchanges GDP by GTP,
  activating Ras. Active, GTP-loaded Ras dimerizes and binds Raf, thereby promoting
  Raf dimerization and activation. Active Raf dimer phosphorylates and activates mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2), which induces ERK1/2 activation. Transcription
  factor Elk-1 is among ERK1/2 many downstream phosphorylation targets. Elk-1 binds
  to its cofactor, a dimer of serum response factor (SRF), leading to transcription
  activation and cell proliferation. Active GTP-bound Ras regulates a number of signaling
  pathways; among these is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K is a heterodimer
  with a regulatory (p85) and catalytic (p110) subunits (not shown here). RTKs recruit
  the p85 subunit of PI3K. Ras activates p110 independently of p85 []. PI3K phosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), a process which can be reversed by the action of phosphatase and tensin
  homologue (PTEN). PIP3 recruits Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) that
  phosphorylates a serine/threonine kinase, Akt (also known as PKB, protein kinase
  B) in the plasma membrane. This further induces the activation of mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) complex, one of the major pathways leading to cell growth. This
  pathway plays important roles in Ras-mediated cell survival and proliferation.
