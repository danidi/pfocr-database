caption: Schematic representation of the mammalian canonical Hh signaling pathway.
  (A) In the absence of Hh, PTCH1 localizes in the cilia and thus prevents the membrane
  localization and activation of SMO. SMO then internalizes in the membrane of intracellular
  endosomes and degrades. The full-length GLI (GLIFL) is modified by protein kinases
  protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), casein kinase 1 (CK1),
  and the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP, which is then proteolytically cleaved into the
  transcriptional repressor form GLIR. The active form of GLI (GLIA) is suppressed
  by SUFU. After that, GLIR translocates to the nucleus and inhibits the expression
  of its target genes. (B) Binding of Hh to PTCH1 results in its internalization as
  well as the ciliary translocation and activation of SMO. GLIFL maintains its full
  length and bypasses the phosphorylation by PKA, GSK3, and CK1, which leads to the
  formation of activated GLI (GLIA). GLIA then translocates to the nucleus where it
  induces the expression of Hh target genes. Interestingly, Kif7 not only participates
  in the movement of GLIFL within the cilia but also inhibits Sufu which usually suppresses
  the formation of GLIA from GLIFL.
