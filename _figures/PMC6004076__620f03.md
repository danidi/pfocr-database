caption: Mitotic errors can trigger activation of p53. (A) Lagging chromosomes that
  become damaged in the cleavage furrow or in micronuclei can elicit the canonical
  DNA damage repair pathway that activates p53. In addition, aneuploidy can also cause
  increased reactive oxidative species that lead to activation of DNA damage signaling.
  (B) Cytokinesis failure has been proposed to activate p53 through two distinct pathways.
  (1) Activation of the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway kinase LATS2 is activated
  in a tetraploid cell, leading to the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration
  of the transcription factor YAP. In addition, LATS2 binds and inactivates MDM2,
  a negative regulator of p53 stability. Inhibiting MDM2 allows for the increased
  accumulation of p53, which up-regulates p21 to elicit a growth arrest. (2) Activation
  of PIDDosome signaling. Tetraploid cells activate the PIDDosome, a multiprotein
  complex comprised of PIDD and RAIDD that in turn activates Caspase-2 (CASP2). Caspase
  2 cleaves and inactivates MDM2, allowing p53 stabilization.
