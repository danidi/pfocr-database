caption: Summary of SEPT6-regulated Hippo/YAP signaling pathway in HCC. SEPT6 expression
  was upregulated in HCC, which inactivated Hippo signaling, dephosphorylated and
  stabilized the downstream effector YAP and upregulated YAP expression. Subsequently,
  active YAP was translocated to the nucleus and promoted transactivation of cyclin
  D1 and MMP2, resulting in HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. SEPT6, septin 6;
  YAP, yes-associated protein; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; MMP2, matrix metallopeptidase
  2; TEAD, TEA domain transcription factor; p, phosphorylated
