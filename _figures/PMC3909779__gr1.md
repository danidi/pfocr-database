caption: EGCG-activated eNOS pathways that improve cardiovascular function and anti-cancer
  effect in the presence of PDE5 inhibitor. EGCG elevates cGMP levels through a specific
  receptor 67LR that stimulates the Akt/eNOS pathway. This pathway leads to vasodilation
  which contributes to improvement of cardiovascular function. In cancer cells, inhibition
  of PDE5 by treatment with Vardenafil leads to sustained elevations of cGMP levels.
  This elevated cGMP activates PKCδ/acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM) that contributes
  to apoptosis.
