caption: Stepwise participation of HGF/MET signaling in MMP development. A vertebrate
  phylogeny and a hypothetical scenario of the participation of HGF/MET signaling
  in MMPs. A stem osteichthyan acquired Met expressions in MMPs and Hgf expressions
  in fin buds, and established the delamination (and possibly the migration) of fin
  MMPs by HGF/MET signaling. A mouse ancestor gained Hgf expressions in the migration
  route of HBM and evolved HGF/MET signal pathway in HBM development. HBM, hypobranchial
  muscle

  muscle precursors during vertebrate evolution.
