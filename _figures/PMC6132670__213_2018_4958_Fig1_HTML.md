caption: The antidepressant melatonergic pathway. Duloxetine, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine
  were all found to increase DA, NE, and 5-HT neurotransmission by inhibiting their
  reuptake. BP was found to increase only DA and NE neurotransmission, but it was
  also found to inhibit nAChRs in the pineal gland. nAChR activation has been shown
  to inhibit MT synthesis, which is diminished in depression and can elicit antidepressant
  effects when enhanced. The proposed melatonergic role in depression is consistent
  with the fact that 5-HT is in the biosynthetic pathway of MT and that NE release
  from superior cervical ganglion neurons stimulates MT synthesis and release
