caption: Key mutational and therapeutic targets in melanoma. The RAS signaling network
  is rife with cancer-associated mutations. BRAF is the most commonly activated oncogene
  in cutaneous melanomas (cut mels), followed by NRAS. Upstream of RAS, the c-KIT
  receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is amplified or activated in a substantial fraction
  of acral and mucosal melanomas. It thus seems that the RTK–NRAS–BRAF–MEK–ERK cascade
  represents a central axis (highlighted in green) that is activated in nearly all
  melanomas. Parallel to this axis is the PI3-K pathway, which is also activated in
  melanomas either through loss of PTEN or activation of AKT3. In addition, it has
  recently been shown that GNAQ and GNA11, which are transducers of the endothelin
  receptor signal (ETR), are mutated in ocular melanomas. These heightened signaling
  events lead to both increased transcription of survival genes (such as MITF) and
  enhanced pro-survival factors in mitochondria through the regulation of BCL2 family
  proteins (red, pro-apoptotic; green, pro-survival). MITF, which is a master regulator
  of melanocyte survival, is also amplified in melanomas and a target of the EWS-ATF1
  fusion protein described in clear cell sarcomas (so-called melanoma of the soft
  parts). Drugs known to inhibit the central axis and with a potential therapeutic
  impact on melanoma are listed in the purple boxes.
