caption: Depicted here is the biochemical pathway of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
  hydroxylation through a combination of α-ketoglutarate (αKG), molecular oxygen (O2),
  one or more of the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) isoenzymes and the asparaginyl hydroxylase
  factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) in normoxia. In normoxia, the von Hippel–Lindau disease
  tumour suppressor protein (VHL)-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase recognizes the α-subunit
  of HIFs and targets the subunit for polyubiquitylation and subsequent degradation.
  Regulation of the E3 ligase is maintained by the covalent modification of the ubiquitin-like
  protein NEDD8. The functional E3 ligase requires the COP9 signalosome to bind NEDD8
  to CUL2. When oxygen becomes limited (hypoxia), the α-subunit is no longer hydroxylated
  and becomes stabilized. In the nucleus, the α-subunit binds to the HIF1β subunit
  and the complex becomes transcriptionally active upon binding to the hypoxia-response
  element (HRE) consensus sequence on DNA. This binding results in the transcriptional
  activation of genetically controlled survival pathways, which are central to the
  regulation of inflammatory outcomes. HIF activation can be elicited pharmacologically
  using PHD inhibitors, thereby promoting normoxic HIF stabilization and concomitant
  alterations in gene expression. Similarly, targeting of cullin 2 (CUL2) neddylation
  (for example, inhibition of NEDD8-activating enzyme) results in CUL2 deneddylation
  and a loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity with concomitant stabilization of HIFα.
