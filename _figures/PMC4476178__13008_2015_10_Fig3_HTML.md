caption: Viruses can target the Sumo pathway to disrupt PML-NBs. a, Several components
  of PML-NBs are targets of Sumo, and multiple Sumo-SIM interactions may promote complex
  stability. b, The HSV viral protein ICP0 can function as a STUBL to degrade sumoylated
  PML, thereby disrupting structural integrity of PML-NBs
