caption: β- and γ-secretase inhibitors. βAPP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is responsible
  for β-secretase activity and a complex of presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, Pen-2, and
  γ-secretase activity. A major research effort is aimed at reducing amyloid beta
  (Aβ) production with BACE1 inhibitors and γ-secretase inhibitors and modulators.
  Inhibition of BACE1 terminates the β-cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP),
  subsequently causing the α- and γ-cleavage of APP. By reducing presenilin, nicastrin,
  and Aph-1, Pen-2 activity prevents cleavage at the γ position of APP. Both mechanisms
  force the system towards the nonamyloidogenic pathway.
