caption: The reversed  retro  –pathway for nucleoside synthesis beginning with Gla–3P
  and acetaldehyde was studied by J. Raap and co–workers [, ]. The authors described
  a one–pot two–step enzymatic reaction involving glycosylation of thymine or uracil
  (labeled by 13C and 15N atoms) using 2–deoxy– α –  D  –ribofuranose–1–phosphate
  (  (48)  ;  also 13C–labeled at the different carbon atoms) and commercially available
  thymidine phosphorylase (TP). Synthesis of 1–phosphate (  48  ) was performed using
  2–deoxy–  D  –ribofuranose–5–phosphate (  78  ) by stereospecific phosphate C5 →
  C1 translocation catalyzed by partially purified recombinant phosphopentomutase.
  The 13C–labeled 5–phosphates were enzymatically prepared from chemically synthesized
  dihydroxyacetone monophosphate (  81  ) in the presence of an excess of acetaldehyde
  using deoxyriboaldolase (DERA) and commercially available triose phosphate isomerase
  (TRI; from baker’s yeast). The  (78)  →  (48)  transformation and condensation with
  thymine or uracil were carried out in a one–pot system, and the respective 2 ′ –deoxyribonucleosides
  were then isolated in yields of 50–60% (). It should be stressed that the great
  excess of acetaldehyde is necessary to prevent the cleavage of Gla–3P and to direct
  the metabolic reaction in the reverse synthetic direction.
