number: Figure 1
caption: The PERK pathway. PERK oligomerizes and trans-autophosphorylates by detecting
  unfolded proteins in the ER, inactivates eIF2α by phosphorylation, and induces translation
  of ATF4. According to the current allosteric model of UPR induction, the ATPase
  domain of BiP interacts with the luminal domain of PERK that dissociates when an
  unfolded protein binds to the canonical substrate binding domain of BiP. ATF4 enhances
  transcription of genes involved in amino acid transport, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.
  Phosphorylated eIF2α is dephosphorylated by CReP, GADD34, and P58IPK. AARE, amino
  acid response element; ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; CHOP, C/EBP-homologous
  protein; CReP, constitutive repressor of eIF2α phosphorylation; eIF2α, eukaryotic
  translational initiation factor 2; GADD34, growth arrest and DNA damage 34; PERK,
  PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; P58IPK, 58 kDa-inhibitor of protein kinase.
