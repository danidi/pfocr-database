caption: Iron treatment in HEY cells leads to an imbalance in redox levels since ROS
  levels are increased and GSH (antioxidant) levels are decreased. Via IRP1/2 translational
  regulation of key targets involved in iron metabolism, FAC leads to increased ferritin
  and decreased CD71 protein levels. Iron leads to loss of OMM proteins (TOM20 and
  TOM70) in a MAPK and mitochondrial calcium uniporter-dependent manner. This was
  demonstrated via the use of U0126 (MAPK inhibitor) and Ru360 (MUC inhibitor). Activation
  of aconitase activity as well as increased mitochondrial damage contributes to cell
  death in HEY cells. Lysosomal and autophagic events are located downstream of the
  mitochondrial events.
