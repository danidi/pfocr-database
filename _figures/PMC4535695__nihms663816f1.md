caption: Classical pathway for T cell activation. Antigen presenting cells, including
  dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages and others process foreign antigens to peptides
  and present these in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). MHC-I present to
  CD8+ T cells, while MHC-II present to CD4+ T cells. The peptide/MHC complex is recognized
  by a unique T cell receptor (TCR), representing signal 1. In addition, other receptor/ligand
  interactions occur which together with the TCR/MHC interaction for the immunological
  synapse. One such signal is the co-stimulatory interaction between CD28 and the
  B7 ligands, referred to as Signal 2. In the absence of this interaction full T cell
  activation does not occur. T cells possess numerous accessory receptors that modify
  response to Signals 1 and 2, proliferation and cytokine production (Signal 3).
