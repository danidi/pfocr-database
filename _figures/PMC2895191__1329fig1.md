caption: Loss of RB function triggers CIN by several mechanisms. Inactivation of RB
  and its family members, p107 and p130, results in deregulated activation of E2F
  transcription factors. Targets of E2F include MAD2, a critical regulator of the
  spindle assembly checkpoint in mitosis, as well as enzymes that modify the structure
  of the DNA, such as the DNMT1 methyltransferase. In addition, loss of RB function
  may alter the activity of some of its binding partners involved in the control of
  chromatin structure, such as SUV4-20H. Similarly, loss of RB affects the function
  of complexes, such as condensin II complexes, involved in mitotic chromosome assembly.
  Finally, loss of RB family function may lead to the accumulation of DSBs due to
  defects during DNA replication, including under stress conditions. Altogether, this
  defines a complex regulatory network of transcriptional and post-transcriptional
  elements by which the RB pathway controls chromosomal stability at the G2/M transition
  of the cell cycle.
