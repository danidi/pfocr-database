caption: Implications of 15‐LOX‐1 in angiogenesis in different models. 15‐LOX‐1 has
  been implicated as a factor that both activates and inhibits angiogenesis. Expression
  of 15‐LOX‐1 in ECs reduced angiogenesis by reducing VEGF‐A, VEGF‐R2 and eNOs mRNA,
  and NO bioactivity, in vitro. In vivo, down‐regulation of VEGFR‐2 expression was
  via the upregulation of PPAR‐γ. 13‐HODE produced by 15‐LOX‐1 expressing cancer cells
  was shown to inhibit angiogenesis through enhanced expression of thrombospondin‐1
  (TSP‐1) and ICAM‐1 in ECs. Increased ICAM‐1 expression may increase the recruitment
  of leukocytes and reduce endothelial cell anergy. On the other hand, 15‐HETE was
  shown as a tumourigenic factor in epithelial cells, and a pro‐angiogenic factor
  in ECs by activating the PI3K pathway. 15‐HETE was also found to mediate EC migration,
  tube formation and angiogenesis through enhanced ATF‐2 activity via the mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase (MAPK, Src, Rac1, MEK1, JNK1) cascade. The other PUFA metabolites
  generated by 15‐LOX‐1 activity need to be determined in order to clarify the context‐dependent
  action of the enzyme
