caption: Model for LLO-mediated L. monocytogenes entry. L. monocytogenes secretes
  the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO), which binds to the cholesterol-rich
  plasma membrane and oligomerizes into a prepore complex. The prepore complex then
  transitions into a transmembrane pore, which permits the influx of extracellular
  Ca2+. A rise in cytosolic Ca2+ results in the translocation and activation of a
  conventional PKC at the plasma membrane. Activated PKC promotes the activation of
  the Rho GTPase Rac1, which transduces the signal down to induce Arp2/3-mediated
  F-actin remodeling at the plasma membrane leading to L. monocytogenes entry. The
  influx of extracellular Ca2+ also induces a membrane resealing pathway.

  cPKC/Rac1/Arp2/3 signaling pathway that promotes Listeria monocytogenes internalization
  independently of membrane resealing.
