caption: One-carbon metabolism. (1) Folic acid, arising from fortified foods or nutritional
  supplements, is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF) by dihydrofolate
  reductase. (2) Serine hydroxymethyl-transferase transfers 1-carbon units from serine
  to THF, with PLP as a coenzyme, forming 5,10-methylene-THF and glycine. (3) 5,10-methyl
  THF reductase can reduce 5,10-methylene-THF to 5-methyl-THF. 5,10-methylene-THF
  can also generate DHF during the synthesis of thymidylate. After absorption from
  the GI tract, dietary folates can also enter the one-carbon metabolic pathway as
  5 methyl THF. (4) In a reaction catalyzed by methionine synthetase and utilizing
  vitamin B12 as a cofactor, the methyl group of 5-methyl-THF is transferred to homocysteine
  (Hcys), generating methionine and THF. Alternatively, betaine can donate a methyl
  group for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine in a reaction catalyzed
  by betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). (5) Methionine adenosyltransferase
  activates methionine to form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). (6) SAM is a methyl donor
  for a variety of acceptors, including guanidinoacetate (GAA—precursor to creatine),
  DNA, and As, in reactions that involve a number of methyltransferases. (7) The byproduct
  of these methylation reactions, s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), is hydrolyzed to generate
  Hcys. (8) Hcys is either used to regenerate methionine or is directed to the transsulfuration
  pathway.
