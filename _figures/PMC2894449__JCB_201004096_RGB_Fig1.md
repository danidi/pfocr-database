caption: Stages of apoptotic cell engulfment and associated cell signaling events
  that regulate each stage. The four stages of apoptotic cell clearance are shown,
  with some of the specific key signaling players identified. The “find-me” step occurs
  when apoptotic cells release soluble chemoattractants that promote chemotaxis of
  phagocytes via corresponding receptors on the phagocyte. The broken line from LPC
  to G2A indicates uncertainty of direct ligand–receptor interaction. The “eat-me”
  stage is characterized by the appearance of ligands on the surface of the dying
  cell that mark it as a target to be engulfed by phagocytes bearing appropriate DAMP
  or PtdSer recognition receptors. The “engulfment” stage occurs when signaling downstream
  of the apoptotic cell recognition receptors stimulates Rac-dependent cytoskeletal
  rearrangement and formation of the phagocytic cup around the target and subsequent
  internalization. Once fully internalized, the cell corpse undergoes “processing”
  through the phagolysosomal pathway that results in the degradation and reprocessing
  of the dead cell material. DAMP, damage-associated molecular patterns; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine;
  MBL, mannose-binding lectin; PS, phosphatidylserine.
