caption: Molecular control of palatal shelf growth and patterning. (A) Signaling interactions
  controlling anterior palatal growth. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in the oral
  epithelium and binds to its receptor patched 1 (Ptc) in the underlying mesenchyme
  to permit smoothened (Smo) activation of palatal cell proliferation. Fibroblast
  growth factor 10 (Fgf10) is expressed in the palatal mesenchyme and binds to its
  receptor Fgfr2b in the palatal epithelium to regulate cell proliferation and survival.
  Fgf10 and Shh signaling maintain expression of each other to drive palatal outgrowth.
  Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling through the Bmpr1a receptor in the mesenchyme
  regulates palate growth and expression of Msx1 and Shox2. Bmp signaling is also
  involved in maintaining Shh expression in the palatal epithelium. Anterior palatal
  outgrowth is controlled additionally by ephrin B1 (EfnB1) signaling through its
  receptors EphB2 and EphB3. (B) Genes involved in development of the posterior palate.
  Mn1, Tbx22, Meox2 and Barx1, which are expressed specifically in the posterior part
  of the palatal mesenchyme, regulate posterior palatal outgrowth, with Tbx22 acting
  downstream of Mn1. (C) Pathways responsible for mediolateral patterning of the palatal
  shelves during vertical outgrowth. Osr1 expression is restricted to the lateral
  mesenchyme whereas Osr2 is expressed at high levels within the lateral part of the
  mesenchyme but also in the medial mesenchyme. The expression of both Osr1 and Osr2
  is dependent on Shh signaling. An additional pathway involving Dlx5-Fgf7 signaling,
  which is able to repress Shh signaling, also controls outgrowth along the mediolateral
  axis. Although not marked in A and B, the mediolateral patterning pathways function
  throughout the AP axis of the developing palatal shelves; in C we have illustrated
  the AP axis (dashed line) in the middle palate. Illustrations represent the palatal
  shelves at specified positions along the AP axis at E13.5. Arrows represent inductive
  relationships, solid lines represent direct physical interaction, and blunt arrows
  indicate inhibition.
