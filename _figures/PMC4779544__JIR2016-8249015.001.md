caption: Proposed pathway connecting HMGB1, TLR4, TLR2, MyD88, and TRIF signaling
  to inflammation and regeneration following muscle ischemia. We have shown that HMGB1
  is released from ischemic myocytes and TLRs 2 and 4 have opposing roles following
  hindlimb ischemia. This proposed mechanism demonstrates the interplay between TLR4,
  TLR2, MyD88, and TRIF in response to skeletal muscle ischemia.
