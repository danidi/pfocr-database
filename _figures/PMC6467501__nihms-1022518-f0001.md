caption: (A) Separate lists of genes for females and males are visualized with a Venn
  diagram illustrating unique and common genes expressed in women (pink) and men (blue)
  3–10 days after YFV-17D vaccination. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis of innate immunity
  genes identified as being important predictors of adaptive responses to YFV-17D
  vaccination (adapted from  and Supplemental document 2 from Gaucher et al. 2008)
  and the changes in expression specific to female (B) and male (C) study participants
  (2-way ANOVA with FDR p < 0.05). In the pathway analysis, node colors indicate fold
  change of gene expression (red = 2 to 18 fold upregulation; green = −1.2 to −2.3
  downregulation; white = n.s. change from baseline) between Day 0 and 7 in women
  (n = 11) and men (n = 5). Illumina microarray data (GSE13699) were imported into
  Partek Genomics Suite and a 2-way ANOVA was conducted using time post-vaccination
  (i.e., Days 0, 3, 7, and 10) and sex (male and female) as the independent variables.
  Contrast analyses were conducted as described in the original paper (Gaucher et
  al. 2008) to compare gene expression values at 3, 7, and 10 days post-vaccination
  to Day 0 (i.e., pre-vaccination) values for females and males separately. Lists
  of genes were generated after establishing the False Discovery Rate p < 0.05 and
  using a fold-change cut off of ≥2. Analyses were conducted on the Montreal dataset;
  one woman was omitted because the overall gene expression Principle Component Analysis
  (PCA) revealed she was an outlier (YF019) and one man from Lausanne (YF10) was included
  in our analyses because the PCA analysis revealed that expression levels of genes
  from this man were similar to those from the 4 Montreal men.
