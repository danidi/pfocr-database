caption: 'Simplified scheme of the pathways of complement activation. Patternrecognition
  molecules such as Clq, MBL (mannose-binding lectin), or ficolins bind to surface
  structures and initiate the formation of the classical C3 convertase. The alternative
  C3 convertase results from spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 (tick-over). C3 convertases
  cleave C3 into C3b and C3a. Deposition of C3b leads to the generation of additional
  C3 convertases (self-amplification) and the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into
  C5a and C5b. In the terminal pathway, interactions between components C5b, C6, C7,
  C8, and C9 lead to the formation of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC). The
  C3b degradation fragments iC3b and C3d participate in phagocytosis and are linked
  to adaptive immune responses. While the C3b and its degradation fragment iC3b participate
  in both phagocytosis and in adaptive immune response, the C3dg fragment is only
  involved in adaptive immune responses. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a trigger immune
  reactions upon binding to their receptors (C3aR, C5aR, C5L2). Complement regulators
  (indicated in red) prevent unwanted complement activation (C1INH: CI inhibitor;
  C4BP: C4 binding protein; FI: Factor I; FH: Factor H).'
