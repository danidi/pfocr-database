caption: Metabolic origin and fate of GDH/ScyA and ALS/ScyB and scytonemin biosynthesis.
  AroG and AroB participate in the synthesis of chorismate, an intermediary that is
  transformed in the precursors leading to ScyA substrates, i.e. l-tryptophan and
  prephenate. The reaction catalysed by ScyB converting tryptophan into indole-3-pyruvate
  is similar to the conversion of l-glutamate into 2-oxoglutarate, catalysed by GDH
  (square with a solid outline). ScyA catalyses the decarboxylation of indole-3-pyruvate
  and p-hydroxy-phenyl-pyruvic acid (p-HPP) to form a dipeptide that serves as a scytonemin
  precursor. This reaction is analogous to the decarboxylation of two pyruvates by
  the original ALS enzyme (rectangle with a dotted outline). ScyC performs a cyclization
  followed by oxidation and dimerization steps that conclude with the scytonemin pathway.
  Enzymes in the scytonemin BGC devoted to synthesis of precursors are coloured in
  brown and scytonemin biosynthetic enzymes are coloured in blue.
