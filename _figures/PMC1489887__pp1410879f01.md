caption: Pathway of hydrolytic and phosphorolytic starch degradation. The products
  of the hydrolytic pathway are maltose and Glu, which are exported to the cytosol
  to make Suc. The product of the phosphorolytic pathway is G6P, which is used by
  the pentose phosphate pathway at night and may be used to regenerate Calvin cycle
  intermediates during the day. Hatched arrows indicate steps that are currently uncertain.
  PWD, Phosphoglucan water dikinase; PGI, phosphoglucoisomerase; MEX1, maltose transporter;
  pGlcT, Glu transporter; DPE2, cytosolic glucanotransferase.
