caption: Proposed phenanthrene degradation pathway in candidate Desulfatiglans TRIP_1.Names
  below the arrows indicate the genes identified in the genome of this bacteria potentially
  involved in the respective reaction. Stars indicate that gene expression was detected
  by proteomic analyses, whereas triangles indicate that gene expression was detected
  by transcriptomics. Lightning bolt and underline compounds represent enzymatic activity
  and metabolites detected by Himmelberg et al.,  respectively.
