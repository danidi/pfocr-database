caption: Role of IFN-β in host–pathogen interaction in Mtb infection. Mtb gains access
  to the host cytosol and leads to mitochondrial stress and release of mtDNA. This
  mtDNA and some other unknown factors indicated by “?” trigger the cGAS–STING–TBK1–IRF3–IFN-β
  pathway. On the other hand, Mtb also induces NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes resulting
  in IL-1β synthesis. These two pathways have opposite roles and outcomes in the host
  defense against Mtb. In addition to direct inhibition of IL-1β, IFN-β can also inhibit
  or diminish the production of IL-1β through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasomes and
  the augmented induction of IL-10. Reciprocal inhibition of IFN-β has been reported
  through IL-1β-induced PGE2. A recent study demonstrated that AIM2 could also inhibit
  IFN-β induction by interfering with the STNG–TBK1 pathway []. IL-1β is recognized
  as beneficial for host cells with anti-mycobacterial activity while IFN-β is considered
  largely detrimental for host cells having pro-bacterial and replication-promoting
  properties.
