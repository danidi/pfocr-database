caption: The proposed model for UPR pathways of the pathogenic Cryptococcus species
  complex. (a) C. neoformans Ire1 controls environmental stress responses, differentiation,
  and virulence in Hxl1-dependent and -independent manners. The Ire1-Hxl1-dependent
  UPR pathway governs responses to ER and cell wall/membrane stress, azole drug resistance,
  and thermotolerance through controlling expression levels of KAR2. In capsule production,
  the transcription factor Rim101 acts as a downstream factor of Ire1. The unidentified
  downstream factors of Ire1 regulate DNA damage response, sexual differentiation,
  and melanin production. (b) C. deuterogattii (R265) Ire1 regulates environmental
  stress responses and virulence in Hxl1-dependent and -independent manners. The Ire1-Hxl1-dependent
  UPR pathway mainly controls cell wall/membrane integrity, azole drug resistance,
  and ER stress. Ire1 mostly regulates thermotolerance, and melanin synthesis. ERS,
  ER stress; CWI, cell wall/membrane integrity; THT, thermotolerance; VIR, virulence;
  DDR, DNA damage response; AZR, azole drug resistance; CAP, capsule production; SEX,
  sexual differentiation; MEL, melanin synthesis; OXR, oxidative stress response.
