caption: 'β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation—known to culminate in cardiac hypertrophy—rapidly
  lowers endogenous levels of H2S in cardiomyocytes. H2S is intrinsically linked (directly)
  to G6PD activity (and production of NADPH), via multiple processes, and this phenomenon
  is causally involved in suppression of cardiac hypertrophy (by H2S) in both cellular
  and animal model systems. Progression of cardiac hypertrophy and ensuing dysfunction
  is, per se, known to be associated with modulation of glucose utilization pathway.
