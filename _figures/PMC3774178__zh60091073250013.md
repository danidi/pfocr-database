caption: 'Schematic of a hypothetical model of the entry and nucleocytoplasmic pathway
  of OGF including the cell cycle and downregulation of cell proliferation. A: OGF
  enters by active transport by Clath-dependent uptake, binds to the OGF receptor
  (OGFr) at the outer nuclear envelope, courses in the paranuclear cytoplasm, and
  enters to nucleus by the NLS-karyopherin β1/Ran system. Kap, karyopherin; NLS, nuclear
  localization signal. B: subsequent events related to the effects of OGF-OGFr activation
  on the signaling pathways related to the cell cycle. Cdk 4/2, cyclin-dependent kinase
  4/2; p16/p21 proteins 16 and 21; Rb, retinoblastoma; G1 to S, gap phase1 to synthesis.'
