caption: Subtype-dependent bimodal response to semaphorins is distinguished by protein
  synthesis requirement. Protein synthesis-dependent and -independent pathways are
  activated by different concentrations of Sema3f in both cervical and brachiothoracic
  motor neurons. In contrast, the low protein synthesis-dependent Sema3a pathway is
  observed only in brachiothoracic motor neurons, while both populations of neurons
  are responsive to high Sema3a (in a protein synthesis-independent manner). The cervical
  motor neurons appear to lack the receptors or the components of the transduction
  cascade linking low concentration of Sema3a to the protein translation machinery.
  Collapse induced by ephrin-As at all tested concentrations is independent of the
  protein synthesis pathway. prot., Protein.
