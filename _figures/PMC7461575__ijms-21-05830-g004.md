caption: Schematic representation of the integrates stress response (ISR) in the context
  of muscular disorders. Stressor-specific response pathways converge into a unified
  pathway by means of ISR. Central mechanism of the ISR is the phosphorylation of
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), leading to the translational
  inhibition of the preinitiation complex. The non-translating complexes are incorporated
  into stress granules together with other RNA-binding proteins (e.g., TIA1 and G3BP1).
  In muscle diseases, both an impaired stress granule formation, as well as altered
  stress granule dynamics, have been identified as pathogenic mechanisms. Furthermore,
  a defective stress granule degradation via autophagic pathways has been considered
  to contribute to disease progression.
