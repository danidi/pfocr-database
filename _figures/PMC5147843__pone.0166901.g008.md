caption: After LTα1β2 expressed by activated B and T cell binds to LTβR, stromal cells
  up-regulate the secretion of chemokines (e.g. CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13) and the expression
  of adhesion molecules (e.g. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1). This further attracts LTα1β2
  expressing cells and establishes a positive feed-back loop that is essential for
  the development and maintenance of secondary lymphoid organs (left side, green).
  The present study now indicates that ligation of the LTβR also leads to production
  of growth inhibitory factor(s) which upon binding to unknown receptors expressed
  by not yet characterized cells might counteract the positive feed-back loop. Interference
  with stromal cell turnover and/or angiogenesis might be possible targets (right
  side, red). When reaching a threshold level, LTβR dependent supportive and suppressive
  activities are in balance and secondary lymphoid organs homeostasis is achieved.
