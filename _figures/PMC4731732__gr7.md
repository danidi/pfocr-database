caption: 'Generation of 3-hydroxy-tetradecenoic acid as mediator of pancreatic β-cell
  bioenergetics failure. Long-chain acyl-CoA is transferred into mitochondria via
  the carnitine cycle with CPT-1/2 and the AC transpoter (1) and is oxidized to 2-enoyl-CoAs
  by three chain length specific acyl-CoA DHs (2). There are two parallel, chain length
  specific, pathways for metabolism of enoyl-CoAs: a) via the mitochondrial trifunctional
  protein (MTP branch (3)), catalyzing the entire sequence of reactions for long-chain
  acids; and b) via a sequence of three medium/short-chain enzymes (crotonase, hydroxyacyl-CoA
  DH and ketoacyl-CoA thiolase) (the crotonase branch (4)). At high concentrations
  of palmitoyl CoA/oleoyl-CoA, the pathway is overloaded : its flux drops and metabolites
  accumulate due to competition between acyl CoAs of different chain lengths for a
  set of acyl-CoA DHs with overlapping substrate specificity, resulting in accumulation
  of CoA-esters, in case of islet tissue of 3-hydroxytetradecenoic acid (3-OH-C14:1),
  which inhibits/uncouples oxidative phosphorylation (10). Glucose synergizes in 3-OH-C14:1
  accumulation by increasing the mitochondrial [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio and inhibiting
  3-hydroxyacyl-CoA DH in the MTP (3) and crotonase (4) branches. Acetyl-CoA (C2)
  and reductive cofactors (6 and 9) are generated by FA oxidation and also from glucose
  (5) glutamine (Q) or leucine (L) (7). High glucose (5) or amino acids (7) increase
  anaplerosis of the citric acid cycle (CAC, 8) and efflux of citrate, oxaloacetate,
  malate, aspartate from mitochondria associated with an energy wasting proton leak
  into the mitochondria via UCP-2. Cytosolic citrate is converted into the CPT-1 regulator
  malonyl-CoA, tightly controlled by 5′AMP and citrate. Glucose is a far more powerful
  reductant of NAD+ and FAD (the latter via the α-glycero-P shuttle) than Q plus L,
  explaining, in part, its critical contribution to lipotoxicity as a result of the
  unbridled feeder enzyme and glucose sensor glucokinase (GK, 5). High Glucose also
  enhances the glycerolipid/FAs cycle (11), an energy wasting process. Note that the
  possible participation of peroxysomal lipid metabolism is not considered here for
  lack of reliable information and for the sake of simplicity.'
