caption: The role of thiamine-dependent enzymes in brain cell glucose metabolism.
  Glucose is the starting material, or substrate, for the pentose phosphate pathway
  and the citric acid cycle. The pentose phosphate pathway is a series of chemical
  reactions involved in the synthesis of lipids and of myelin (i.e., the substance
  comprising the sheaths around nerve cell axons). An intermediate product of the
  pentose phosphate pathway, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, is also the substrate for
  the citric acid cycle, which generates most of the energy needed to maintain cellular
  functions. The citric acid cycle takes place in the mitochondria, small organelles
  that also are called the cells’ “energy factories.” The figure shows some of the
  intermediate substances in the two pathways that are substrates and products of
  the reactions mediated by the thiamine-dependent enzymes transketolase, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.
