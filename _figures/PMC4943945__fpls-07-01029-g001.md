caption: A schematic model of the transcriptional regulation of different TFs playing
  key roles in cellular dehydration in plants. PP2C-PYR/PYL/RCAR complex positively
  regulates AREB/ABF-SnRK2 pathway. SnRK2s further modulate other TFs downstream including
  AREB/ABFs, FBH3/AKS1, and SNS1 during stress as well as seed maturation. Phosphorylated
  AREB/ABF TFs, AREB1, AREB2, ABF3, and ABF1 bind to the promoter region of target
  genes and activate their expression in response to dehydration stress. GRF7 suppresses
  the expression of DREB2A, which is a key TF in ABA-independent gene expression.
  Broken lines indicate possible roles. PP2C-PYR/PYL/RCAR, pyrabactin resistance1/PYR1-like/regulatory
  components of ABA receptors; PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; CE, coupling element;
  GTE, GRF7-targeting cis element; HSE, heat shock element; TFs, transcription factors.
