caption: Concept diagram depicting the potential transcriptional regulation of Nox
  by transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms in vascular/immune cells in response
  to cardiovascular risk factors. Activation of specific protein kinases/phosphatases
  leads to the activation of specific pro-inflammatory transcription factors (e.g.,
  NF-kB, AP-1, STAT1/3, and C/EBP) that regulate the expression of various Nox subtypes
  by direct and indirect mechanisms. Enhanced Nox-derived ROS formation induces oxidative
  stress that triggers pro-inflammatory and oxidative processes in the vasculature.
  Alternative to the classical pro-inflammatory pathway of Nox activation, various
  lipid peroxidation products (e.g., 4-HNE, 4-HDDE) generated via enzymatic or non-enzymatic
  mechanisms may function as natural endogenous ligands for PPARs. Activated PPARα
  or PPARβ/δ act as negative regulators of pro-inflammatory pathways by interfering
  with NF-kB, AP-1 or STAT1/3 signalling. PPAR-mediated Nox up-regulation and ROS
  formation contribute to the generation of lipid peroxidation products with PPARα
  or PPARβ/δ-activating functions. Activation of PPARs by synthetic agonists may compensate
  the exacerbated pro-inflammatory and oxidative reactions in response to vascular
  insults. The diagram illustrates that several epigenetic mechanisms namely, histone
  acetylation (hyperacetylation of nucleosomal histones or acetylation of pro-inflammatory
  transcription factors) and micro RNA (i.e., down-regulation of miRNA-25) differentially
  regulate Nox4 expression and activity.
