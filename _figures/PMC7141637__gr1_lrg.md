caption: Proposed model for SARS-CoV-2-associated diarrhea. SARS-CoV uses ACE2 and
  the serine protease TMPRSS2 for entry in lung AT cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not
  only expressed in lung, but also the small intestinal epithelia. ACE2 is expressed
  in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. ACE2 is also necessary for the surface
  expression of amino acid transporters of the small intestine. Amino acids, like
  tryptophan, regulate the secretion of antimicrobial peptides by Paneth cells via
  mTOR pathway activation. Antimicrobial peptides impact the composition and diversity
  of the microbiota. Disturbance of this pathway could drive inflammation (enteritis)
  and ultimately diarrhea. SARS-CoV-2 rendering courtesy of Centers for Disease Control
