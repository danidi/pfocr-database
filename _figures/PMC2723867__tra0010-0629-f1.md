caption: Engagement of B and T cell immune receptors triggers the activation of Src-family
  tyrosine kinases that lead to the phosphorylation of ITAMs within the cytoplasmic
  domains of immune receptor subunits and to the further recruitment of adaptor and
  signaling molecules, forming signaling platforms that involve lipid microdomains.
  A) T cell activation, initiated by TCR engagement with MHC–peptide complexes, activates
  Lck and Fyn, which results in phosphorylation of CD3 ITAM modules, leading to the
  sequential activation and recruitment of signaling proteins, such as ZAP70, LAT
  and SLP-76. B) In B cells, BCR recognition of Ag, most likely in a membrane-bound
  form, leads to the activation of Lyn, which phosphorylates the ITAM motifs on the
  Igα/Igβ BCR subunits, an event that further determines the recruitment and phosphorylation
  of Syk, Btk and adaptors, such as BLNK and CD19. In both cases downstream effectors
  of receptor signaling lead to intracellular calcium release and production of secondary
  messengers, such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3),
  which activate PKC -θ in T cells and PKC in B cells, determining effector functions.
  The main pathway of TCR-dependent actin remodeling involves signaling through LAT
  and SLP76, AKT and Vav-1, which are activated and stabilized at the IS. Vav-1, a
  GEF for Rho-GTPases triggers the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1, which promote actin
  polymerization by Wasp and WAVE2, respectively. The BCR-mediated spreading and contraction
  of B cells depend on actin cytoskeleton, which also rely on activation of Rac1 and
  2. Additionally, in B and T cells, Rap1 activation through LFA-1 engagement promotes
  actin polymerization, most likely in a cooperative manner with Rho-GTPases.
