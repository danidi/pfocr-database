caption: The Hedgehog signalling pathway. Positive regulators of the Hedgehog (Hh)
  pathway are shown in green, whereas negative regulators are shown in red. Although
  many of the components seem to have both positive and negative activities under
  different conditions, the component is colour-coded according to its predominant
  activity. Components of the pathway that do not seem to be conserved between Drosophila
  and mammals are shown in ovals. This figure is intended to summarize the key concepts
  about Hh signalling discussed at this workshop, and is not intended to represent
  all the known components of the pathway. Akt; cellular homologue of the transforming
  gene of the AKT8 provirus; β-TrCP; β-transducin repeat-containing protein; CDK11;
