caption: 'The chart represents the RPKM pattern at 25°C under LD (blue lines) and
  LL (red lines) at 6, 16, 30, 40 and 54 hours. Compounds include: Glucose-6P, Glucose-6-phosphate;
  Glucose-1P, Glucose-1-phosphate; ADP-glucose, Adenosine diphosphate-glucose. Starch
  synthesis enzymes include: PGM, phosphoglucomutase; AGPase, ADP-glucose phosphorylase;
  SS, soluble starch synthase; GBSSI, granule bound starch synthase I; BE, 1,4-alpha-glucan
  branching enzyme; ISA, isoamylase; Pullulanase and HXK, Hexokinase. Starch degradation
  enzymes include: α-GWD, alpha-glucan water dikinase; α-AMY, alpha-amylase; O 1,6G,
  oligo-1,6-glucosidase; BAM, beta-amylase. Disproportionating enzymes include: DPE1
  (plastid isoform) and DPE2 (Cytosolic isoform), α-1,4 glucanotransferases. Transporter
  include: MEX1, Maltose transporter 1. Expression data for the transcripts used in
  the pathway are provided in ().'
