caption: Scheme of apoptosis pathways. There are two key apoptosis signaling pathways,
  i.e., the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway and the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway.
  Stimulation of death receptors by their cognate ligands leads to activation of caspase-8,
  which either directly activates downstream caspases or initiates the mitochondrial
  pathway by cleaving Bid. Engagement of the intrinsic pathway results in the release
  of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c or Smac into the cytosol, which in
  turn promotes activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis.
