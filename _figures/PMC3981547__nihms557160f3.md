caption: Structures of human IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 hexameric complex (a), mouse LIFR in
  complex with human LIF (b), and human CNTF/CNTFRα/LIFR/gp130 (c) assembled from
  known crystallographic, biochemical, and electron microscopic data. In (a) the model
  shown was derived from the crystal structure of the IL-6 hexamer headpiece () together
  with the single-particle reconstruction of the entire extracellular complex ().
  IL-6 signaling is mediated through homodimerization of gp130 in a symmetric hexameric
  arrangement with a nonsignaling IL-6Rα receptor. In (b) the model shown derives
  from the 4 Å crystal structure of the LIF/LIFR complex () missing the membrane-proximal
  domains that are depicted as cartoons. In (c), the quaternary LIFR/gp130/CNTF/CNTFRα
  complex is derived from a combination of the crystal structures of LIF/gp130 (),
  CNTF (), and a single-particle reconstruction of the entire quaternary complex ().
  CNTF signals through the asymmetric heterodimerization of gp130 and LIFR and the
  nonsignaling CNTFα receptor. In panel (d), the assembly pathway for IL-6 signaling
  is depicted as elucidated from References , . IL-6 first engages IL-6Rα through
  a site I interaction to form a composite interface (site II) that recruits gp130.
  This trimeric structure can then engage a second trimer through two site III interfaces
  to form a productive signaling complex.
