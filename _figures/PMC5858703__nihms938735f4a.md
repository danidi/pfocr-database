caption: A. The formation of RORγt agonists by the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway
  leads to activation of RORγt, which is required for Th17 differentiation and the
  expression of target genes, such as Il17, Il21, and Il23R. The HMG-CoA reductase
  inhibitors, statins, inhibit the generation of RORγt agonists resulting in reduced
  RORγt activation and Th17 differentiation. Statins also reduce RORγt expression
  and Th17 differentiation by inhibiting STAT3, which is required for RORγt transcription.
  The scavenger receptor CD5L is expressed at high levels in nonpathogenic Th17 cells,
  where it suppresses cholesterol biosynthesis and the formation of RORγt agonists.
  It becomes expressed at low levels in pathogenic Th17 cells leading to increased
  cholesterol biosynthesis, generation of RORγt agonists, and pathogenicity of Th17
  cells. B. Inhibition of CYP51A1 by azoles, deficiency in CYP51A1 or FDFT1 inhibit
  cholesterol biosynthesis, thereby reducing the availability of RORγ agonists and
  RORγt activation. Statins and CD5L have a negative effect on cholesterol biosynthesis
  and RORγt activation. This subsequently reduces Th17 differentiation and Il17 expression,
  and suppresses the development of inflammatory disease. Other mechanisms that affects
  the generation of RORγt agonists are CYP27A1 deficiency, which reduces the generation
  of 27-hydroxycholesterol. Induction of ABCG1/A1 expression by LXRs increase cholesterol
  efflux and potentially reduce the availability of RORγt agonists and Il17 expression,
  whereas ApoE-deficiency and high fat/cholesterol diet (HFD) have the opposite effect
  by increasing cholesterol levels.
