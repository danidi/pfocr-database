caption: LPS up-regulates the PhT2 signaling pathway. LPS is specifically recognized
  by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the membrane to form a complex consisting of CD14,
  TLR4, and MD2, which signals TIRAP-MyD88 adaptors to activate NF-κB and up-regulate
  the expression of inflammatory cytokines and PhT2. The LPS complex is also endocytosed
  through one or more dynamin-dependent pathways. In endosomes, a second phase of
  TRAM-TRIF-mediated signaling is initiated, which leads to further NF-κB signaling
  and the production of inflammatory cytokines and PhT2. Endosomes are fused with
  lysosomes for degradation of the LPS complex, which utilizes transporters on the
  lysosomal membrane to help antigen presentation.
