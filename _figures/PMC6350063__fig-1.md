caption: Effects of TNFα on NSPC activity. TNFα treatment results in disparities in
  differentiation because of the subtype of TNFR (TNFR1 or TNFR2) and the age/brain
  region of the NSPCs. In the adult dentate gyrus (DG), TNFα induces increased neurogenesis
  in NSPCs through TNFR2 binding. No changes in differentiation are observed when
  TNFα binds to TNFR1 in the same model. In postnatal SVZ NSPCs, TNFα activates the
  SAPK/JNK pathway through TNFR1, resulting in increased neurogenesis. Many studies
  do not address the relative roles of TNFR1/TNFR2 specifically, but rather focus
  on intracellular signaling pathways that are activated by TNFα. In embryonic hippocampal
  NSPCs, TNFα results in astrogliogenesis through the activation of Hes1, an antineurogenic
  transcription factor. Chronic TNFα treatment results in increased expression of
  the proapoptotic protein, Bax, which is accompanied by activation/cleavage of caspase-3
  in NSPCs. In contrast, acute TNFα treatment results in increased proliferation through
  NF-κB signaling. TNFα also leads to the release of LIF that activates STAT3 signaling
  through LIFR and promotes astrogliogenesis in NSPCs. Solid lines represent pathways
  that are defined in the literature, and the dotted line represents a proposed pathway.
