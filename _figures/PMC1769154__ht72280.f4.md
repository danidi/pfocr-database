caption: Organisation of MAP kinase cascades. MAP kinase cascades are exemplified
  by the “classical” MAPK cascade. In this signalling pathway ligand binding to a
  GPCR triggers activation of the cascade by promoting the generation of second messengers
  and by recruiting adaptor molecules and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This results
  in activation of a MAPK kinase kinase kinase and subsequent phosphorylation and
  activation of raf, a MAPK kinase kinase. Raf can then phosphorylate the dual specificity
  kinase MEK (an MAPK kinase) which directly phosphorylates ERK1/2 (a MAPK). Negative
  feedback then allows for signal dampening or desensitisation. Within the “classical”
  MAPK cascade ERK1/2 promotes the induction of dual specificity MAPK phosphatases
  (MKP-1 and-2), thus initiating its own deactivation and limiting cellular responses
  in the absence of continued stimulus input. There is also growing evidence of crosstalk
  between the different MAPK pathways. For example, it is thought that the proliferative
  effect of vascular endothelial growth factor on endothelial cells requires the sequential
  activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs. These studies have been strongly influenced by the
  availability of selective pharmacological tools that block the MAPKs themselves
  or target upstream components of the various cascades.
