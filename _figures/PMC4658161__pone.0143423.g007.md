caption: (A) SHARPIN inhibits integrin activation by binding to the α-integrin cytoplasmic
  domain and preventing binding of the integrin activator TALIN. In addition, SHARPIN
  is part of LUBAC, which is required for activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway.
  We now demonstrate that integrin and RNF31 binding are mutually exclusive as they
  are mediated by partially overlapping binding sites within the SHARPIN UBL domain.
  (B) An overview of SHARPIN interactions and how these interactions affect diverse
  signaling pathways. SHARPIN is depicted schematically with its functional domains
  (an N-terminal PH domain, a central UBL domain and a C-terminal NZF domain). The
  UBL domain is a multi-faceted protein interaction hub that has been shown to interact
  with a number of proteins, highlighted in yellow bars. These interactions each have
  specific functional consequences, highlighted in green bars. In addition, the N-terminal
  PH domain of SHARPIN mediates SHARPIN homodimerization and the C-terminal NZF domain
  is required for LUBAC function.
