caption: 'Potential HMGB1 receptor and possible signaling pathways. A: HMGB1-RAGE
  interaction leads to phosphorylation of MAP-kinases p38, p42/p44, and c-jun NH2-terminal
  kinase, resulting in NF-B activation. B: HMGB1 binds to many membrane molecules
  such as heparin, proteoglycans including syndecan-1, sulfoglycolipids, and phospholipid
  and mediate phosphorylated of extracellular regulated kinase-1 and -2. that involves
  signaling via an unidentified Gi/o protein. C: HMGB1 through RAGE can activate two
  different cascades, one involving the involves the Ras-mitogen-activated protein
  (MAP) kinase pathway and a second that involves a small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 leading
  to cytoskeletal reorganization and subsequent nuclear factor (NF)-B nuclear translocation-mediating
  inflammation. D: RAGE is also expressed on mononuclear phagocytes where its interaction
  with AGEs enhances cellular oxidant stress and generation of thiobarbituric acid
  reactive substances and activation of NF-B. RAGE signaling has also been shown to
  stimulates an inflammatory response when AGE-modified β2 microglobulin binds RAGE
  in mononuclear phagocytes to mediate monocyte chemotaxis and induce TNF release.'
