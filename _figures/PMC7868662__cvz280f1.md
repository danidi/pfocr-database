caption: Mechanisms of Notch1-associated calcification. H19 has previously been shown
  to suppress p53-driven transcription of Notch1 by preventing the binding of p53
  to the Notch1 promoter (A). Toshima et al. showed that miR-34a, itself a p53-dependent
  transcript, directly binds to the Notch1 transcript to suppress Notch1 signalling
  (B). Both pathways of Notch1 suppression lead to increased expression of cadherin-11
  and calcification of the aortic valve (C). These findings reaffirm the role of Notch1
  suppression in CAVD, describe a novel pathogenic molecule, and highlight the need
  for further work targeting this pathway in CAVD. CAVD, calcific aortic valve disease.
