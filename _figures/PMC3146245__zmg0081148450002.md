caption: 'Genetic model for nuage assembly and piRNA pathway genes in mice. Many of
  the proteins involved in piRNA production are conserved between Drosophila and the
  mouse (). Overall, two major types of piRNA granules are present: the MILI and MIWI
  granules are exclusively localized to the cytoplasm whereas the MIWI2 granules shuttle
  between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Whereas the cytoplasmic granule alone can produce
  primary piRNA (sense orientation), both granules are necessary for the production
  of secondary piRNA (antisense orientation) characteristic of the ping-pong amplification
  cycle. Three protein domains necessary for piRNA granule assembly that recur within
  the pathway components are the PIWI (green), TUDOR (red), and RNA helicase domains
  (blue). Mutual dependencies are represented by double-headed arrows. Components
  with insufficient evidence to assign a position within the pathway are listed at
  the bottom. See  for more detailed description of orthologous components.'
