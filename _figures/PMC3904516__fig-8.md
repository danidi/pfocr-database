caption: Cartoon describing the possible crosstalk between TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and BMP/Smad
  signaling. BMP-2 induces osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs through activation
  of Smad1/5/8 signaling, characterized by up-regulation of ALPase activity and the
  expression of osteoblastic genes such as ALP, COL1A1, OCN, OPN, Runx2 and osterix.
  LPS activates NF-κB by increasing IκBα phosphorylation via a TLR4-MyD88-dependent
  pathway. Meanwhile, inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, both of which
  are secreted in the LPS-triggered inflammatory environment, create a cytokines-NF-κB
  loop to potently stimulate NF-κB activity. Ultimately, activated NF-κB inhibits
  Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, resulting in down-regulation of osteogenic markers and
  suppression of osteogenic differentiation. Color images available online at www.liebertpub.com/scd
