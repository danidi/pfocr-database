caption: 'Bone-derived growth factors (GFs) such as insulin-like growth factors (IGF)
  and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis
  and stimulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and production of bone-modifying
  cytokines such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP), prostaglandin E2
  (PGE2) and interleukin-11 (IL-11) in bone-colonizing cancer cells, representing
  the concept of “Seed and Soil” theory proposed by Paget []. These bone-modifying
  factors further stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption via activation of receptor
  activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANKL)/RANK pathway in osteoblasts and osteoclasts,
  thereby further increasing release of bone-stored growth factors, thus establishing
  “vicious cycle” between bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-colonizing cancer cells
  [, , ]. Bone-colonizing cancer cells reside in stromal cell niche via cell-cell
  contact that is mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and stay dormant or undergo
  EMT and acquire further aggressiveness. Role of osteocytes in bone metastasis and
  CABP needs to be elucidated. CAM: cell adhesion molecule, EMT: Epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition, RANK: receptor activation of NF-κB, RANKL: receptor activation of NF-κB
