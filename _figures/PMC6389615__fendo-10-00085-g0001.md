caption: 'Schematic representation of genes involved in osteoclast-poor and osteoclast-rich
  osteopetrosis. In red are indicated genes involved in the pathogenesis of ARO. MCSF
  and RANKL, cytokines secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes, are necessary for the
  differentiation of osteoclast precursors into mature and resorbing osteoclasts.
  When these signals are absent (TNFSF11 gene mutations) or the pathway is interrupted
  by the lack of cytokine receptors (TNFRSF11A and CSF1R gene mutations), osteoclast
  precursors are not able to differentiate into mature osteoclast causing osteoclast-poor
  forms of osteopetrosis. Alternatively, if osteopetrosis is caused by mutations in
  genes encoding for protein necessary for bone resorption, the disease is defined
  as osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis. On the right of the figure, are indicated genes
  involved in bone resorption activity with different roles: i.e., acidification of
  resorption lacunae and pH regulation (TCIRG1, CLCN7, OSTM1, and CAII), vesicular
  trafficking and sorting of protein complex to the membrane (SNX10 and PLEKHM1),
  cytoskeletal rearrangement for ruffle border formation (FERMT3 and LRRK1). Other
  molecules involved in different signal transductions, essential for osteoclast functions
  (MITF, LRP5, and IKBKG) are reported.'
