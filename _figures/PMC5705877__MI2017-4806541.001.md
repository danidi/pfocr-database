caption: Biosynthesis of ceramide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and ceramide-1-phosphate
  (a). Chemical structures of sphingolipids (b). Ceramide is the central sphingolipid
  molecule of sphingolipid metabolic pathways. Three major pathways are responsible
  to produce ceramide. Ceramide is produced by de novo pathway in the ER with a series
  of enzymatic reactions. Ceramide is produce from SM by SMase action. The salvage
  pathway generates ceramide from sphingosine that generates from the metabolism of
  complex sphingolipids. Ceramide is now can be converted to C1P by CERK enzyme. Ceramide
  can be converted to sphingosine by ceramidase. Sphingosine is now phosphorylated
  by sphingosine kinases to form S1P. S1P can be converted back to sphingosine by
  SPPase or can be irreversibly broken down by sphingosine phosphate lyase (SPL) to
  ethanolamine phosphate and 2-trans hexadecenal for phosphatidylethanolamine and
  glycerolipids, respectively.
