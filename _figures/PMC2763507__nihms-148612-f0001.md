caption: 'Cell-surface receptors transduce extracellular signals such as neurotransmitters
  and neuropeptides into the interior of the cell. Most neurotransmitters and neuropeptides
  communicate with other cells by activating seven-transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs). As their name implies, GPCRs activate G proteins, which are composed
  of α and βγ subunits. Two families of proteins turn off the GPCR signal and might,
  therefore, represent attractive targets for new medication development. G-protein-coupled-receptor
  kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate GPCRs, thereby uncoupling them from their respective
  G proteins. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs, also called RGS or regulators of G-protein-signaling
  proteins) accelerate the G-protein turn-off reaction (an intrinsic GTPase activity).
  Two major signaling cascades that are activated by GPCRs are the cAMP-generating
  second-messenger system and the PI system. cAMP activates PKA, a pathway that has
  been implicated in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants. Among the potential
  targets for the development of new antidepressants are phosphodiesterases (PDEs)
  that catalyze the breakdown of cAMP. Thus, PDE inhibitors are expected to sustain
  the cAMP signal and might represent an antidepressant-augmenting strategy. Activation
  of receptors coupled to PI hydrolysis results in the breakdown of phosphoinositide
  4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers, inositol 4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores, whereas DAG
  is an endogenous activator of PKC, which is also activated directly by Ca2+. PKC,
  PKA and other Ca2+-dependent kinases either directly or indirectly activate several
  transcription factors, including CREB, CREM, ATF-1, c-Fos, c-Jun, Jun-D and ΔFos
  B. Endogenous growth factors such as BDNF utilize different types of signaling pathways.
  BDNF binds to and activates its tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB), which facilitates
  the recruitment of other proteins (SHC and SOS) and results in the activation of
  the ERK–MAP kinase cascade (via sequential activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, Erk and
  Rsk). In addition to regulating several transcription factors, the ERK–MAP kinase
  casade, via Rsk, down-regulates BAD, a pro-apoptotic protein. Enhancing the ERK–MAP
  kinase cascade might have similar effects to endogenous neurotrophic factors; one
  potential strategy is to utilize inhibitors of MAP kinase phosphatases (to inhibit
  the turn-off reaction) as potential drugs with neurotrophic properties. In addition
  to utilizing GPCRs, many neurotransmitters (e.g. glutamate and GABA) produce their
  responses via ligand-gated ion channels. Although these responses are very rapid,
  they bring about more stable changes via regulation of gene transcription. One pathway
  that is gaining increasing attention in adult mammalian neurobiology is the Wnt
  signaling pathway. Wnts are a group of glycoproteins that are active in development
  and play important roles in the mature brain. Binding of Wnts to the Wnt receptor
  (WntR) activates an intermediary protein, Disheveled, which regulates GSK-3β. GSK-3β
  exerts many cellular effects; it regulates cytoskeletal proteins, including tau,
  and has an important role in determining cell-survival/cell-death decisions. GSK-3β
  has been identified recently as a target for the action of lithium. GSK-3β also
  regulates the phosphorylation of β-catenin, a protein that, when dephosphorylated,
  acts as a transcription factor at lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) sites. Additional
  abbreviations: CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; Rq and Rs, extracellular
  GPCRs that are coupled to stimulation and inhibition of adenylate cyclases, respectively;
  Rq/11, GPCR coupled to activation of PLC; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine rich C kinase
  substrate, which is associated with several neuroplastic events; PLC, phospholipase
