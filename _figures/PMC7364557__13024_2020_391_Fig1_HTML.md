caption: A model for Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and glial response in AD. a APP processing
  and Aβ generation. Aβ is generated by APP cleavage in acidified compartments such
  as late endosomes, and subsequently released from neurons. Extracellular Aβ sequentially
  assemble into Aβ oligomer aggregates (oAβ), fibrils, and ultimately amyloid plaques.
  b Aβ-mediated neuronal dysfunction. oAβ can disrupt synaptic function through LTP
  impairment and LTD enhancement. A variety of potential neuronal Aβ receptors such
  as EphA4, PrPc, EphB2, NMDAR, and LiLRB2 have been shown to bind Aβ and transduce
  synaptotoxicity. SORLA can inhibit EphA4-mediated synaptic and cognitive dysfunction
  with oAβ exposure. Fyn kinase is an important regulator for NMDAR-mediated oAβ neurotoxicity.
  oAβ also can alter mitochondria function to induce caspase-3 activation, ATP reduction
  and ROS upregulation, thereby aggravating synaptic dysfunction. c Effects of Aβ
  on microglia. oAβ may activate microglia through binding to the putative Aβ receptors
  such as TREM2, LRP1, RAGE, TLR4 and CD36. Specifically, the binding of Aβ to TREM2
  activates SYK pathway through DAP12, an adaptor protein for TREM2, and leads to
  the degradation of Aβ. d Aβ-dependent microglia/astrocyte interactions, and Aβ-mediated
  astrocyte dysfunction. APOE released from the astrocytes binds Aβ, which enhances
  Aβ/APOE interactions with LRP1. Activated microglia release proinflammatory such
  as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, which can activate astrocytes. In addition, oAβ
  can potentially activate astrocytes directly through α7-nAchR, CaSR, CD36, CD47
  and AQP4. Activated astrocytes may damage neurons through extracellular glutamate
  dyshomeostasis/excitotoxicity, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6
