caption: 'A) Biosynthetic pathway for pyochelin production. PchA, an isochorismate
  synthase, and PchB, an isochorismate pyruvate lyase, convert chorismate to salicylate.
  PchD-G consists of 12 different domains constituting three NRPS modules with three
  tailoring domains. Together, they assemble pyochelin from salicylate and two l-cysteines,
  with co-substrates AdoMet, ATP, and NADPH. AdoMet = S-adenosylmethionine, AdoHcys
  = S-adenosylhomocysteine. PchD is a stand-alone adenylation domain (A; blue). PchE
  has N- and C-terminal thiolation domains (T; yellow), a cyclization domain (Cy;
  grey), an adenylation domain (A; blue) and a stuffed epimerase domain (E; purple).
  PchG is a stand-alone NADPH-dependent reductase. PchF is a full-NRPS module consisting
  of 5 different domains: a cyclization domain (Cy; grey), adenylation domain (A;
  blue), stuffed methyltransferase tailoring domain (M; red), thiolation domain (T;
  yellow), and thioesterase domain (TE; green). B) PchF-FL refers to the “full-length”
  protein, whereas PchF-AMT only includes the stuffed adenylation methyltransferase
  didomain and the thiolation domain. G667I-PchF-AMT has a mutation to the proposed
  AdoMet binding domain of the variant PchF-AMT. C) The proposed order of chemistries
  performed by PchF. PchF incorporates l-cysteine to the growing peptide chain. The
  Cy-domain of PchF continues chain elongation by generating a peptide bond between
  l-cysteine and the upstream hydroxyphenyl-d-thiazoline moiety of PchE (an intermediate
  attached to the Ppant of the T-domain of PchE). The Cy-domain then cyclizes the
  cysteine to form a hydroxyphenyl-(d)-thiazoline-(l)-thiazoline intermediate. PchG
  (green) reduces the terminal thiazoline of the hydroxyphenyl-bis-heterocycle to
  thiazolidine using NADPH. The stuffed methyltransferase domain of PchF catalyzes
  the AdoMet-dependent methyl transfer (highlighted in red) onto the nitrogen of the
  newly reduced thiazolidine ring before transferring the complete heterocyclic siderophore
  to the TE-domain releasing the fully mature pyochelin by hydrolysis in the TE-domain.

  in the sequence of biosynthesis are shown in . D) During reconstitution assays,
  premature hydrolysis releases peptidyl intermediates during biosynthesis. Intermediates
  previously recovered by Walsh and colleagues are noted with an asterisk. Intermediate
  analogs used as potential substrates in this study are surrounded by a square. Nomenclature
  of intermediates is as follows: HP, hydroxyphenyl; Tox, thiazole; T, thiazoline;
  Tred, thiazolidine; CO2- carboxyl; Et, ethyl; Me/M, methyl.'
