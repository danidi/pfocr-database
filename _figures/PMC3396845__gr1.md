caption: 'Schematic representation of metabolic fluxes upon different carbon sources.
  Glucose uptake results in fermentation processes via activation of high efficient
  Pyk1p and thus a rapid turnover of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Inhibition of the
  pentose phosphate pathway by triose phosphate isomerase causes an increase in NADP+,
  but not in NADPH. High glucose activates Adh1/3/4/5p which forces the formation
  of ethanol upon fermentation processes. Additionally, glucose represses Adh2p and
  thus inhibits the vice-versa production of acetaldehyde from ethanol. Ethanol, galactose
  and glycerol stimulate expression of the less active Pyk2p, which furthermore enhances
  intracellular levels of PEP. Enhanced PEP leads to an activation of the PPP, increases
  respiratory metabolism via pyruvate and acetyl-CoA intermediates. Malate is converted
  to pyruvate by mitochondrial Mae1p and thereby reductive NADPH is synthesized. Upon
  strict carbon starvation metabolic fluxes are restricted. At the same time, stress
  response mechanisms and autophagy are induced, which ultimately results in longevity.
  Factors and processes involved in the promotion of cell death or exerting pro-survival
  functions are marked in red and green, respectively. Abbreviations: Ac-CoA, acetyl
  coenzyme A; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Gal1P, galactose 1-phosphate; G1P,
  glucose 1-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; Gly3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; GSH,
  glutathione; NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle.'
