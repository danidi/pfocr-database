caption: ATRA is synthesized from retinol (Vitamin A) in a two-step oxidation process
  which takes place in the cytoplasm. To induce transcription, retinoic acid receptors
  (RARs) need to be activated by ATRA binding, and both RARs and retinoid X receptors
  (RXRs) need to bind retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in the vicinity of target
  genes. Several CYP26 isoforms are responsible for ATRA degradation. Due to its small
  size and hydro- and lipophilic properties, ATRA is able to cross cell membranes
  and thus act in other cells.
