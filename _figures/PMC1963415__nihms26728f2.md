caption: Geranyl-pyrophosphate and farnesyl-pyrophosphate, generated by condensation
  of the mother carbon skeleton of isopendenyl pyrophosphate, modify membrane-coupled
  Rac and Ras, respectively, leading to their activation. Subsequently, MAP kinase
  pathways are employed to activate specific transcription factors, which then bind
  to their elements in the iNOS promoter and transactivate them. iNOS expression blockers
  may impede this pathway by interfering at specific points in the cholesterol synthesis
  pathway. Furthermore, activation of Rac also leads to activation of the NADPH complex.
  Thus, ROS is generated, which diffuses back into the cell to mediate its own signal
  is augmenting iNOS expression.
