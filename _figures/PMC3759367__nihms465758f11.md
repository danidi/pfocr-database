caption: Signaling pathway and proposed sites of arsenite perturbation. Illustrated
  is the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 by the liganded BMP receptor, a phenomenon partially
  suppressed by arsenite (As) and EGF. The resulting induction of DUSP2 and DUSP14
  (the latter possibly indirect) by Smad transcription factors is also shown as a
  site of arsenite intervention. Arsenite inhibition of DUSP dephosphorylation of
  ERK is possible but was not tested. Active ERK (phosphorylated) suppresses FOXN1
  mRNA levels and Notch1 activation. The latter may occur at least in part by reduced
  FOXN1 binding to response elements reported in the upstream promoter region of Notch1
  (), not shown for simplicity. It is not known whether FOXN1 and activated Notch1
  (NICD) bind directly to keratin gene promoters or instead regulate the expression
  of other factors affecting keratin gene transcription.
