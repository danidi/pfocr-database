caption: Proposed model describing the signaling cascades leading to HAECs cytoskeleton
  remodeling following either thrombin stimulation or HLA class I ligation. Thrombin
  stimulation at 1 U/ml signals through PAR1 and activates G12/13 to induce RhoGTP
  and ROK. ROK activation leads to MLCP phosphorylation, which results in its inactivation.
  In addition, thrombin at 1 U/ml utilizes Gαq to induce an [Ca2+]i increase, which
  promotes MLCK phosphorylation. Both of these pathways, activated by thrombin (1
  U/ml), culminate in MLC phosphorylation (Thr18/Ser19) and stress fiber formation.
  When the dose is lowered, thrombin (1 mU/ml) utilizes PAR1 and activates, primarily,
  G12/13 to induce ROK. Low-dose thrombin depends on ERK1/2 activation and we forecast
  that this may occur via the Gβγ subunit, which activates Rac to induce PAK, MEK,
  and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Thr202/Tyr204) and then promotes MLCK activation. Thrombin
  (1 mU/ml) utilizes these two G-protein pathways to activate MLC and induce stress
  fiber formation. HLA class I ligation mimics a pattern comparable to thrombin at
  1 mU/ml, but does not occur via PAR1. Thus we postulate that HLA class I ligation
  induces the translocation of mTORC2 and inactive ERK1/2 to the plasma membrane.
  Rac is then activated to induce PAK and MEK activation induces ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204)
  where it is released from mTORC2 at the membrane. Phospho-ERK1/2 activates one pathway
  to induce RhoGTP and ROK signaling and another pathway, which promotes the induction
  of MLCK. Together, these two ERK1/2-mediated signaling cascades elicit stress fiber
  formation following class I ligation.
