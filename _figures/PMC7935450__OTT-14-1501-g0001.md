caption: The cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Exogenous and endogenous DNA activate cGAS
  to generate second messenger 2ʹ,3ʹ-cGAMP. After 2ʹ,3ʹ-cGAMP binds to the downstream
  receptor protein STING, STING transfers to golgi body and polymerization occurs,
  and then, TBK1, IRF3 and NF-κB were recruited. This promotes the phosphorylation
  of IRF3 and NF-κB and facilitates their entry into the nucleus, finally, the transcription
  of genes associated with inflammatory factors is activated.
