caption: In this model, PsrA represses PA0506 (fadE) which allows acyl-CoA to be available
  for the PQS biosynthesis pathway. Long chain fatty acids (LCFA) relieve this repression.
  When PsrA is mutated, the expression of PA0506 is greatly elevated and excess PA0506
  will rapidly convert acyl-CoA to enoyl-CoA. This apparently causes a shortage of
  the octanoyl-CoA needed for PQS synthesis and therefore PQS production greatly decreases.
