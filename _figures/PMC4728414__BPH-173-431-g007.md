caption: Scheme illustrating the proposed HNO‐TRPA1‐CGRP signalling pathway at meningeal
  arteries innervated by trigeminal afferent nerve fibres (Aδ/C). NO mainly produced
  by the endothelial NOS (eNOS) diffuses into perivascular nerve fibres, where HNO
  is formed together with H2S produced in the presence of neuronal CBS. HNO activates
  TRPA1 channels leading to Ca2+‐induced CGRP release. CGRP activates its receptors
  in arterial smooth muscle cells causing vasodilatation upon up‐regulation of the
  AC‐cAMP and other pathways. Experimentally used NO and H2S donors (NONOate, Na2S)
  and blockers of the NO and H2S generation (L‐NMMA, oxamic acid), as well as blockers
  of TRPA1 channels or CGRP receptors (HC030031 and CGRP 8‐37) are indicated in italics.
