caption: Schematic representation of the 5-Lipoxygenase enzyme metabolic pathway.
  Arachidonic acid is released from diacyglycerol or membrane phospholipids via the
  action of Phospholipase A2. Once free, arachidonic acid is oxidized by 5-lipoxygenase
  (5-LO), which has been activated by the Five-Lipoxygenase-Activating-Protein (FLAP),
  at carbon 5 to form the unstable 5-hydroxy-peroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5HPETE),
  which is promptly metabolized into the more stable 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraneoic acid
  (5HETE). The 5HETE can then be converted in leukotriene A4 (LTA4), which can serve
  either as an intracellular intermediate in the synthesis of LTB4 and LTC4, or may
  be released extracellularly and subsequently be taken up by adjacent cells devoid
  of 5-LO activity but expressing LTA4-hydrolase and/or LTC4 synthase.
