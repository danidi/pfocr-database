caption: Proposed model of hypoxia-induced changes to purinergic signalling. Our findings
  are in red, while those of other studies examining the impact of hypoxia on platelet
  signalling are in blue. Our data suggest that hypoxia up-regulates the basal level
  of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, a key determinant
  of platelet aggregation downstream of the P2Y 12 receptor. Other work demonstrating
  increased nitric oxide (NO) levels at altitude provides a possible mechanism for
  this finding.  Phosphorylated-VASP (VASP-P) inhibits the expression of active α
  IIb β 3 expression, which links to Kiouptsi et al's finding that hypoxic platelets
  have lower expression of active α IIb β 3 in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).  Increased
  P2Y 1pathway activity would be consistent with Tyagi et al's finding that calpains
  are up-regulated by hypoxia.  Since we found no change in overall sensitivity to
  ADP, it may be that the changes produced by hypoxia in these two pathways counteract
  one another. AC, adenylate cyclase; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine
