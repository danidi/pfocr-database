caption: The inter-relationships of genes associated with apoptosis differentially
  expressed in the lacrimal glands of C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice. The inter-relationships
  were created by Pathway Studio Version 5.0 software using the ResNet mammalian database.
  Interactions identified were manually validated and collated for final pathway visualization.
