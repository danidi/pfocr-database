caption: Schematic diagram of the endocytic pathway and the role of retromer in sorting
  APP and SorL1. The SorL1 protein associates with APP. The cargo-selective retromer
  complex interacts with SorL1 to direct the APP-SorL1 complex into an endosome-to-Golgi
  retrieval pathway. Aberrant APP localization to late endosomal compartments increases
  processing to the neurotoxic Aβ peptide.
