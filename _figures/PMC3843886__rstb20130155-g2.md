caption: Schematic of common signalling pathways underlying activity-dependent and
  leptin-dependent synaptic plasticity. During LTP, activation of NMDA receptors stimulates
  PI 3-kinase and subsequent inhibition of GSK3β at hippocampal CA1 synapses. Activation
  of this pathway promotes delivery of AMPA receptors to synapses which in turn results
  in a persistent increase in the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission (LTP).
  In a similar manner, following leptin binding to leptin receptors, the activity
  of PI 3-kinase is increased resulting in AMPA receptor exocytosis and a sustained
  increased in synaptic efficacy (leptin-induced LTP). Although neuronal leptin receptors
  are capable of inhibiting GSK3β, via PI 3-kinase, it is unclear if GSK3β plays a
  role in leptin-induced LTP. During LTD, stimulation of NMDA receptors activates
  PP1 leading to increased GSK3β activity and subsequent AMPA receptor endocytosis
  and LTD. Activation of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway has also recently been implicated
  in NMDA receptor-dependent LTD. Although the JAK2-STAT3 pathway is a key downstream
  target of neuronal leptin receptors, it is not known if this pathway plays a role
  in leptin-dependent synaptic plasticity. (Online version in colour.)
