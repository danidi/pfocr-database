caption: P. putida reactions for growth on 1,2,4-TCB. The reaction network used to
  integrate the degradation products of 1,2,4-TCB into P. putida metabolism and the
  cellular processes involved in generating the required reducing power (electrons
  and/or NADH) are shown. Central carbon metabolism includes the Entner-Doudoroff
  pathway, gluconeogenesis, and the TCA cycle. The acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating)
  reaction, involved in toluene metabolism, was also used to generate NADH. The overall
  reactions for eight different pathways were implemented individually; the reaction
  network resulting from implementation of overall reaction [K] is given here. Reaction
  networks for all eight overall reactions studied are shown in Additional File .
  The units for the flux values are mmol/gDW/h. Compound abbreviations are given in
  the appendix.
