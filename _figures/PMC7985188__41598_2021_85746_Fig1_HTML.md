caption: Overview of the data, methods (a) and results (b) for TBNC network identification
  (A) Workflow of the proposed computational approach. It consists of 6 steps. (1)
  identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between basal and normal
  samples from TCGA data, (2) pathway enrichment analysis. In this step we identified
  the pathways enriched with DEGs, (3) construction of a classifier to distinguish
  basal versus normal samples using a metric able to reveal the interactions among
  pathways, (4) the classifier was evaluated using Area Under Curve (AUC) in the training
  and testing test, (5) we selected the pairs of pathways that achieved the best AUC
  values, (6) we applied an integration algorithm between miRNA and pathway in order
  to identify miRNAs regulating pathway network in basal breast cancer. (B) miRNAs
  regulating pathway network. The figure shows the top 10 pairs of pathways that achieved
  the best performance in the classification of basal versus normal samples and miRNAs
  regulating this network.
