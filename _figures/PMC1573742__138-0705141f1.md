caption: Mechanisms of agonist-induced smooth muscle cell contraction. Smooth muscle
  contraction is triggered by an elevation in intracellular calcium (↑[Ca2+]i) which
  catalyses the interaction between the cellular actin and myosin filaments. Under
  resting conditions an intracellular environment with a high potassium concentration
  and a low calcium concentration exists with potassium ions moving along their concentration
  gradient to the extracellular media via calcium, voltage and ATP-sensitive potassium
  channels (KCa, KV and KATP) in the membrane, generating a resting membrane potential
  of −60 mV. (A) Addition of mM concentrations of extracellular KCl disrupts the potassium
  concentration gradient, preventing the intracellular to extracellular movement of
  potassium ions, which are instead retained intracellularly. Depolarization of the
  membrane potential ensues, activating voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs)
  and triggering extracellular calcium influx (). BAY K8644 acts as a direct activator
  of VOCCs (). (B) Noradrenaline (NA) elicits smooth muscle contraction via alpha-1
  adrenoceptor stimulation, which results in a G-protein coupled activation of phospholipase
  C (PLC) with subsequent generation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol
  (DAG) from the membrane phospholipid phosphatidyl inositol biphosphate (PIP2). IP3
  acts at its receptor (IP3R) located on the intracellular membrane of the sarcoplasmic
  and endoplasmic reticulum, triggering calcium release from these stores whereas
  DAG activates VOCCs through modulation of chloride channels (). In contrast, prostaglandin
  F2α (PGF2α) acts at prostanoid receptors gated directly to receptor-operated calcium
  channels (ROOCs) (). NA is also reported to activate ROCCs in smooth muscle (),
  the proportion of the response attributed to this additional pathway varying between
  vascular beds. (C) Caffeine and carbachol trigger smooth muscle contraction through
  stimulation of calcium release from discrete intracellular stores. Carbachol activates
  the intracellular IP3 receptors whilst caffeine activates intracellular ryanadine
  receptors (RyrR) (). (D) Thapsigargin (Thap) triggers contraction via its inhibitory
  action on the calcium pumps of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA).
  Under normal conditions a cycling of calcium occurs between these intracellular
  stores and the cytoplasm, calcium being released from the endoplasmic reticulum
  and then actively pumped back into these stores via the SERCA. In the presence of
  thapsigargin the SERCA are irreversibly inhibited but the passive calcium release
  from intracellular stores is unaffected. Consequently an emptying of the intracellular
  calcium stores ensues, resulting in the activation of store operated calcium channels
  (SOCCs) and extracellular calcium entry ().
