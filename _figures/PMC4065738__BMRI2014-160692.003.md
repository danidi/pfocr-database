caption: Regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway by SUMO. Multiple signal transduction
  molecules of NF-κB pathway, such as IκBα, NEMO, RelA, and P100, can be modified
  by SUMO. After SUMO-1 conjugated to NEMO, the IKK would be activated, similarly,
  SUMOylation IκBα conjugated to the SUMO-1, and this would lead to the degradation
  of IκBα and activation of the NF-κB pathway. And the SUMOylation of RelA and P100
  was in accord with NEMO.
