  description: Parameters in the WB-PBPK model for irinotecan and the metabolites.
    Parameters are shown in the WB-PBPK model for irinotecan and the metabolites.
    a The kinds of parameters other than the metabolites in liver are same among irinotecan
    and the metabolites. Indicated are the blood flow (Q), the volume (V), the tissue-plasma
    partition coefficient (Kp), renal clearance (CLr), biliary clearance to transit

    for the transit from large intestine to feces (kfeces), hepatic artery (H.A.)
    and hepatic vein (H.V.). The metabolic pathway of irinotecan and the metabolites
    in liver are represented b. Indicated are metabolic clearance of CPT-11 by CES2
    to form SN-38 (CLCES,1), metabolic clearance of NPC by CES2 to form SN-38 (CLCES,2),
    metabolic clearance of CPT-11 by CYP3A4 to form APC (CL3A4,1), metabolic clearance
