caption: This figure depicts the major type of nuclear DNAdamages (by stressors) and
  repair pathways involved in eukaryotic cells including damage recognition, lesion
  excision;, processing, synthesis of new bases and ligation (left panel). The major
  repair processes include the mismatch DNA repair (MMR), double strand break repair
  (DSBR), base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER) and single-strand
  breaks repair (SSBR). Key players of each step include damage recognition by proteins
  like glycosylases, lesion excision by nucleases, synthesis of new bases by polymerases
  and ligation of nicks by ligases. Double strand breaks (DSB) on DNA caused by stressors
  like UV and ionizing radiation are specifically recognized and repaired by the players
  of the DSB repair (DSBR) pathway, that includes either non-homologous end joining
  (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), depending on the cell-type and stages of
  cell cycle involved.
