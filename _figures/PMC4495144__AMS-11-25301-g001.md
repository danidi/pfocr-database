caption: The insulin pathway in a sensitive and an insulin resistant state. Insulin
  exerts its activity after binding to the α-subunit of the insulin receptor (IR)
  at the extracellular surface of the sarcolemmal membrane. This, in turn, causes
  the autophosphorylation of the IR β-subunit, which has tyrosine kinase (TK) activity,
  and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular adapter proteins, such
  as IR substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2). Tyrosine- phosphorylated IRS-1 or IRS-2
  bind to the src-homology 2 (SH2) domain of intracellular proteins. One of these
  proteins is the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase).
  The interaction between the p85 subunit and the phosphorylated IRS promotes activation
  of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. The final result of this cascade is
  activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway by insulin, which promotes glucose transport
  through the stimulation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) to the cell surface. Activation
  of the PI 3-kinase pathway has also been linked to nitric oxide (NO) production
  partially due to an increase in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene
  expression. PI 3-kinase downregulation may lessen the vasodilator effect of insulin
  via NO production and promote endothelial dysfunction. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc
  and IRS proteins can also lead to activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
  kinase signaling pathway. Increased insulin activity through the MAP kinase pathway
  plays an accelerating role in the development of diabetes-related complications,
  such as inflammation, proliferation and atherosclerosis
