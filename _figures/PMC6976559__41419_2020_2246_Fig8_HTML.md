caption: In vivo, persistent low-dose Cd exposure induces male rat reproductive lesions
  via eliciting oxidative stress, damaging the morphology of seminiferous tubule,
  lowering testicular marker enzymes activity in Sertoli cell and germ cell, and decreasing
  sperm motility and counts. Meanwhile, Cd induces autophagy and apoptosis in testicular
  cells via restraining mTOR pathway in rats. After one cycle of spermatogenesis 8
  weeks without Cd exposure, some reproductive injury has recovered, which indicates
  that the testis has some self-repair function. In reparative phase, autophagy is
  significantly diminished. These results suggest that this may be due to the fact
  that strong autophagy promotes apoptosis and kills cells during Cd exposure period,
  while mild autophagy antagonizes apoptosis and protects cells during self-recovery
  period. In vitro, Cd-induced GC-2/TM3/TM4 cells autophagic apoptosis could be rescued
  by PI3K inhibitor 3-MA inhibiting autophagy; but Cd inhibits autophagy and induces
  apoptosis in GC-1 cells, and 3-MA protects against Cd-induced GC-1 cell apoptosis
  by inhibiting autophagy flux. However, mTOR signaling was not linked with GC-1/GC-2/TM3/TM4
  cells autophagy. Together, we provide the relationships among autophagy, apoptosis,
  Cd exposure, spermatogenesis dysfunction, and infertility. These results suggest
  that cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis regulates testicular injury/recovery
  induced by cadmium via PI3K with mTOR-independent pathway, especially in SCs and
  LC.
