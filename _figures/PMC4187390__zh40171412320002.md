caption: 'Proposed effects of EO on the arteries (A) and heart (B). The well-documented
  acute action of EO (inhibition of α2 Na+ pumps), but not its chronic effect (α2
  Na+ pump-mediated activation of the C-Src, ERK1/2, MAPK, and protein kinase cascade),
  is mimicked by digoxin. Sustained elevation of plasma EO leads, apparently via the
  protein kinase cascade, to increased expression of several arterial Ca2+ transporter
  proteins. These include Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-1 (NCX1), transient receptor potential
  cation channel, subfamily C, member 6 (TRPC6; component of receptor-operated channels),
  and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase pump-2b (SERCA2b). These chronic
  effects of EO are blocked by digoxin (, , ), as indicated; digoxin may either mimic
  (not shown) or antagonize the acute effect of EO, depending upon the relative concentrations
  (). (Note: ouabain-digoxin antagonism has been demonstrated in arteries and neurons,
  but not yet in heart, as indicated by the question marks in B.) Chronically elevated
  plasma EO may also increase NCX1 expression in the heart by a C-Src-activated protein
  kinase cascade (, ). Acute Na+ pump inhibition by EO raises the cytosolic Na+ concentration
  ([Na+]CYT). This reduction in the Na+ electrochemical gradient, in turn, promotes
  net Ca2+ gain via NCX1, and a rise in both cytosolic and SR calcium concentrations,
  [Ca2+]CYT and [Ca2+]SR, respectively, and, thus enhances Ca2+signaling and contraction
  in both the heart and arteries [acute (green) pathways in A and B]. With increased
  NCX1 expression due to chronically elevated plasma EO, however, the heart and arteries
  apparently respond differently. The main role of NCX1 in the heart is to mediate
  Ca2+ extrusion and promote relaxation during diastole (), whereas in arteries, its
  main role seems to be to mediate Ca2+ entry and maintain tone (). Thus NCX1 upregulation
  in the heart should decrease contractility (B, chronic pathway), but in arteries
  it should increase contractility (A, chronic pathway). In other words, the acute
  and chronic effects of EO should be synergistic in arteries but antagonistic to
  one another in the heart. See text for further details.'
