caption: Model for the internalization and recycling of Wls. Newly synthesized Wls
  is transported by the anterograde transport pathway from the TGN to the cell surface.
  At the cell surface Wls is recruited into clathrin-coated pits by interaction of
  the adaptor AP2 with the YEGL motif in the third intracellular loop of Wls. Internalization
  of Wls by clathrin-mediated endocytosis requires dynamin I. Internalized Wls is
  then recycled to the TGN by retrograde transport from the early endosomes. Mutation
  of the YEGL motif in the third intracellular loop of Wls results in an internalization-defective
  Wls which accumulates on the cell surface and is blocked in recycling.
