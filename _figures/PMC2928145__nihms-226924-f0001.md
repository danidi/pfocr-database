caption: 'Lung cancer cells predominantly express ERβ. The full-length ERα, the primary
  functional receptor in breast cancer cells, is not expressed in most lung cancer
  cells and tissues. Instead, they express a variant of ERα that lacks the exon 4
  at the amino terminus (which contains the nuclear localization signal. As a result,
  ERα is expressed in the cytoplasm of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and
  tissues, while ERβ predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm and is believed to mediate
  the transcriptional effects of estrogen in NSCLC. Estrogen (17-β estradiol or E2β)
  present in the extracellular space diffuses through the cell membrane and binds
  to cytosolic ERs, α or β. The ERs in the cytoplasm are normally kept inactive by
  binding of a complex containing HSP90. Binding with estrogen causes the inhibitory
  complex to dissociate, thereby activating the receptor. The ligand-bound receptor
  then either dimerizes and is imported into the nucleus (classical pathway [I] mediated
  by ERβ) or translocates to the cell membrane where it associates with receptor tyrosine
  kinases like the EGFR (alternate pathway [II] mediated by either ERα and/or ERβ).
  The ER proteins have been shown to colocalize in caveolae, which are plasma membrane-associated
  lipid rafts that provide the appropriate environment for interaction with cell surface
  receptors like EGFR. This interaction with EGFR forms the basis of employing EGFR
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors in combination with anti-estrogens (e.g., fulvestrant,
  a competitive antagonist of estrogen binding to the ER) for the treatment of lung
  cancer. In the case of ERα, palmitoylation of a cysteine residue (Cys477) is crucial
  for its localization to the plasma membrane. The activation of EGFR by ERα or β
  (bound to the ligand E2β) leads to phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc, which
  in turn associates with the GRB2–SOS complex, activating the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway.
  The activated ERK (p44/p42 MAPK) then migrates to the nucleus where it activates
  the transcription of genes that promote proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells.
  In addition, the ligand-bound ERβ receptor, upon translocating to the nucleus, binds
  directly to gene promoters containing the ERE where it recruits the p160 coactivator
  GRIP1/TIF2 and thus activates genes that promote cell cycle progression (Id-2 and
  cyclin D1) and therefore induces proliferation of NSCLC cells.EGFR: EGF receptor;
  ER: Estrogen receptor; ERE: Estrogen response element; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; GRB: Growth factor receptor-bound protein; GRIP: Glutamate receptor interacting
  protein; HSP: Heat-shock protein; SOS: Son of sevenless.'
