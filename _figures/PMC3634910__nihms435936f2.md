caption: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a metabolic checkpoint under
  nutrient starvation conditions, translating signals to mTORC1 through direct phosphorylation
  of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) and Raptor and inhibiting cell growth. The
  phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 by liver kinase B1 (LKB1) in the activation
  loop is essential for AMPK activation. LKB1 is in a complex with STRAD and MO25.
  AMPK phosphorylates and activates TSC1/2 by phosphorylating TSC2, which inhibits
  mTORC1. AMPK also phosphorylates regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor)
  in a parallel pathway on sites that induce Raptor-14-3-3 binding and inhibition
  of mTORC1. RTK denotes receptor tyrosine kinase. P represents phosphorylation.
