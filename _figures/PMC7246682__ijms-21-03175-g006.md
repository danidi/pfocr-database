caption: Mechanism of action of fractalkine on JEG-3 trophoblast cells Fractalkine
  binds to its cognate receptor on the surface of trophoblast cells activating MAPK
  and AKT pathways. MAPKs can phosphorylate PR on serine amino acid residue increasing
  its activity. Secreted activin may bind to activin receptor on the surface of trophoblast
  cells activating SMAD2/3 transcription factors that are also the targets of the
  BMP2/BMPR signalling pathway. SMAD2/3 transcription factors can upregulate MMP2
  and MMP9 expressions. MAPKs are activated by fractalkine signal transduction pathway,
  act positively on MMP2 and MMP9 transcription. PR influenced by fractalkine can
  also affect MMP2 synthesis.
