caption: 'Based on the finding that the expression of the two molecules is upregulated
  during Ca++ depletion condition, it is proposed that these proteins are involved
  in the development of the precursor sclerocytes to the functionally active catabolic
  sclerocytes. OSTF forms with Cbl and Src a triple complex that stimulates the membrane-associated
  PI-3K and lipid metabolism. This metabolic chain is initiated by clustering integrins.
  These processes finally result in an increased mobility/migration of the catabolic
  sclerocytes and in an increased expression of the carbonic anhydrase gene. The latter
  enzyme generates protons that dissolve spicular CaCl2 (ACC), and causes spicule
  resorption. Presumably occurring pH shifts within the cells are counterbalanced
  by a vacuolar H+-transporting adenosine triphosphatase and the release of Cl− via
  the chloride/bicarbonate exchanger (see: ). In analogy to the differentiation pathway
  of mammalian osteoclasts it is proposed that also in sponges the differentiation
  of sclerocytes is under control of, hitherto unknown, differentiation factors and
  their receptors acting similar like OPG, RANKL and RANK in mammals.'
