caption: Working model of the combined trans- and cis-acting elements that regulate
  expression of leuO. When the cell receives a signal such as cFP, ToxR-signal transduction
  ensues. cFP binds to the periplasmic domain of ToxR, leading to a conformational
  change in the cytoplasmic domain of ToxR such that it binds to the ToxR box upstream
  of leuO. A curve in the region between the ToxR binding site and the promoter allows
  ToxR to directly interact with RNA polymerase and recruit it to the poor promoter
  sequence. High level of expression of LeuO leads to feedback inhibition of its own
  transcription, possibly through binding to the five sites in the upstream region
  and displacing ToxR and/or RNA polymerase. Alternatively, full occupation of the
  LeuO binding sites may interfere with DNA bending such that ToxR can no longer recruit
  RNA polymerase.
