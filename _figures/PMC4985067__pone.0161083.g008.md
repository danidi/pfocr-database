caption: (A1) In the first pathway alcohol abuse or metabolic alterations associated
  with obesity in the context of human alcoholic or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
  (ASH or NASH), and DDC or griseofulvin administration in mice trigger the upregulation
  of keratins (K8 and K18) with, increased K8:K18 ratio and cross β-sheet conformation
  of K8, which leads to the formation of small ‟early” MDBs with filamentous ultrastructure
  and MM120-1 antigen positivity. (A2) The coalescence of small MDBs to form large,
  compact ‟mature” MDBs occurs via incorporation of p62. Binding of p62 to MDBs also
  promotes the recruitment of NBR1 and other proteins to MDBs. (B1) In the second
  pathway (found in hepatocellular carcinoma and idiopathic copper toxicosis) p62-containing
  IHBs, which are negative for keratin and do not show cross β-sheet conformation,
  may progress to (B2) hybrid inclusions (showing mixed features of both IHBs and
  MDBs) by incorporation of keratins (K8 and K18). (B3) The hybrid inclusions may
  transform to ‟mature” MDBs upon further incorporation of K8 and K18.
