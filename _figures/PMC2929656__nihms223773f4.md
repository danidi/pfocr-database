caption: The metabolism of cholesterol, methyl-branched fatty acids and odd-chain
  length lipids will raise the intracellular levels of the C3 compounds propionate
  or propionyl-CoA, which Mtb finds highly toxic. The bacterium has developed three
  different strategies to detoxify propionyl-CoA. Isocitrate lyase activity has been
  suborned to fulfill the function of methylcitrate lyase in the last step of the
  methyl citrate cycle to generate the TCA cycle intermediate succinate. The methylmalonyl
  pathway has also been mobilized to metabolize propionyl-CoA to produce succinyl-CoA
  via the VitB12-dependent activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Finally, intermediates
  from the methylmalonyl pathway can be incorporated directly into the abundant, methyl-branched
  lipids of the bacterial cell wall, such as PDIM and SL-1.
