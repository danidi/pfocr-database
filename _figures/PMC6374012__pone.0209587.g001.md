caption: The key steps of the pathway in response to IFN-α are highlighted here. IFN
  binds to the receptor and activates JAK1 and TYK2, which subsequently activate the
  STATs in the cytoplasm, all by phosphorylation. The phosphorylated STATs and IRF9
  form the transcription complex ISGF3, which translocates to the nucleus, where it
  activates hundreds of ISGs, including IRF9, Mx2 and SOCS1.
