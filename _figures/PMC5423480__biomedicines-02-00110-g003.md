caption: Overview of the induction of an innate immune response to Ad-based vectors.
  (A) General adenoviral infection pathway and typical pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) contribute to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines after infection
  of Ad-based vectors. After binding on the cell surface receptor (e.g., Coxsackievirus-adenovirus
  receptor), a clathrin-coated vehicle containing the Ad particle is formed, and clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis occurs. Naked capsid released from endosome interacts with microtubules
  and dynein motors. Capsid docks at nuclear pore and passes viral DNA (vector DNA)
  through nuclear pores; (B) Amplification of innate cytokine induction through IL-1
  receptor and/or IFNα receptor. Cytokines (IL-1, type I IFN) induced through PRRs
  bind to their receptors and amplify the induction of multiple cytokines and other
  anti-viral molecules.
