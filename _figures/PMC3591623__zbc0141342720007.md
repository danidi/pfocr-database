caption: Model for the putative mechanism by which Fsk-cAMPi negatively regulates
  IL-2R signaling in human T-cells. Multiple targets for Fsk-cAMPi regulation are
  shown. Fsk prevents the association of IL-2Rγ and β chain (a) as well as Jak3 activation
  and kinase activity (b). Stat5 activation (c), nuclear translocation (d), and DNA
  binding (e) are prevented, resulting in severe reduction in IL-2R signaling and
  T lymphocyte proliferation.
