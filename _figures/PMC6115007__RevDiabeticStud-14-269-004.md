caption: 'Iron (inorganic and hem-bound) is absorbed from the intestine, and enters
  the LIP in cytoplasma. Iron is excreted through ferroportin, oxidized by hephestin,
  and released into the circulation. Iron is transported in the bloodstream bound
  to transferrin (TF), ensuring controlled delivery of iron to the recipient cell
  (here beta-cell). On the cell surface, the TF-iron complex binds to transferrin
  receptor 1 (TfR1) and is internalized into endosomes. Via acidification, iron is
  released from TF and transported by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) into the
  labile iron pool (LIP). The unbound TF is released into the bloodstream. In case
  of iron overload, TF-binding capacity may be exceeded and non-transferrin-bound
  iron (NTBI) will be present. NTBI is taken up by and transported into the beta-cell
  in a nonregulated process via ZRT/IRT-like protein 14 (ZIP14) or a ZIP14-independent
  pathway. Excess iron is stored as ferritin or excreted via ferroportin, but may
  also cause ROS formation and beta-cell damage (not shown). Hepcidin, secreted by
  hepatocytes and beta-cells, inhibits iron release by breaking down ferroportin.
  On the hepatocyte, TF-iron complex binds TfR2 and HFE protein, and by mechanisms
  not completely understood involving bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BmP6), hemojuvelin
  (HJV), and mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD)-mediated intracellular signaling,
  production of hepcidin is upregulated. In the beta-cell, hepcidin is secreted with
  insulin and inhibit iron release via ferroportin. Abbreviations: BmP6 - bone morphogenetic
  protein 6, BMPR - bone morphogenetic protein signaling receptors type 1 + 2, DMT1
