caption: The shikimate pathway is comprised of several pathways that are controlled
  by several regulatory enzymes, including 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate
  synthase, chorismate synthase, chorismate mutase, prephenate dehydrogenase, arogenate
  dehydratase and anthranilate synthase, to name a few. Tyrosine and phenylalanine
  share a common branching pathway from chorismate through arogenate. Tryptophan derives
  from a separate branching pathway from chorismate through anthranilate.
