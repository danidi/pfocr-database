caption: Schematic representation of FLO-induced cytotoxicity in L cells. The exposure
  of FLO inhibited mitoribosome and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and structural
  alterations. Subsequently, cellular ATP biosynthesis was decreased and induced AMPK
  phosphorylation. The phosphorylated AMPK inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR and
  p70S6K, which inhibited cell growth and proliferation. The activation of AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K
  pathway and inhibition of cell proliferation could be partly reversed by the AMPK
  inhibitor compound C. The damaged mitochondria also generated more harmful ROS,
  which elevated the levels of p53 and p21, and contributed to cell cycle arrest and
  cell proliferation inhibition. The elevation of p53 was also speculated inhibited
  recruitment of Parkin to the damaged mitochondria and further impaired mitophagy,
  which caused damaged mitochondria accumulation and induced cellular senescence.
  The expression of p53, inhibition of Parkin recruitment, accumulation of damaged
  mitochondria and inhibition of cell proliferation could be partly reversed by the
  ROS scavenger NAC.
