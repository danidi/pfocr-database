caption: The bipotential gonad differentiates into male or female in response to a
  signaling pathway that involves anti-Müllerian hormone/Müllerian inhibiting substance
  (AMH/MIS), a member or the TGF-β family. In males, the sex-determining region of
  chromosome Y (SRY) expression activates AMH/MIS expression, which signals via ALK-3/BMPRIA
  and Smad1, 5, and/or 8. This leads to differentiation of Leydig cells and expression
  of testosterone, resulting in the regression of the Müllerian ducts. In the absence
  of SRY, AMH/MIS, and testosterone, Wolffian duct regression occurs, resulting in
  Müllerian duct maintenance and development of a female reproductive tract.
