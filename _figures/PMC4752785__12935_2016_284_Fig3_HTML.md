caption: Scheme of the molecular mechanisms that systematic exposure to cigarette
  smoke can influence during carcinogenesis of the mammary gland. Different components
  of cigarette smoke can induce mechanisms, at transcriptional level, that promote
  the expression of anti-apoptotic and mitotic checkpoints genes. Solid lines indicate
  a mechanism or pathway established experimentally. Dashed lines indicate a mechanism
  or pathway not determined yet. Arrowheads indicate upregulation and flattened heads
  indicate downregulation
