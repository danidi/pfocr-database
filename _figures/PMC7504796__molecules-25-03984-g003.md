caption: 'Interdependence of CAT:MST axis, glutathione (GSH) bioavailability and cysteine
  metabolism. (A) Glutathione (GSH) bioavailability depends on de novo synthesis and
  recycling. GSH is synthesized by the sequential action of two enzymes: Glutamate
  cysteine ligase (GCL), which links glutamate (Glu) to cysteine (Cys), and glutathione
  synthase (GS) that links the Glu-Cys dipeptide to glycine (Gly), forming GSH. Cysteine
  degradation by CAT:MST is dependent on GSH consumption, since CAT uses Cys and α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) to produce 3-mercaptopyruvate (3MP), which will be further used by MST to
  produce pyruvate (Pyr). In this reaction, MST becomes persulfidated (MST-CysSSH)
  and reacts with a thiol-containing or disulfide acceptor (e.g., GSH) that becomes
  persulfidated and ultimately releases hydrogen sulfide (H2S). (B) GSH synthesis
  depends on cysteine bioavailability, and Cys transport and metabolism depend on
  glutamine (Gln). Gln gives rise to Glu and Gly, two components of GSH. Glu is also
  needed for Cys uptake mediated by antiporters, while Gly supplies the folate cycle
  belonging to one-carbon metabolism together with the methionine cycle, from which
  homocysteine may originate Cys through the transsulfuration pathway (TSP), by the
  sequential action of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE).
  Cys degradation and production of H2S by the CAT:MST axis requires Glu-derived α-KG
  and GSH. Cys can also be catabolized by CBS and CSE through a number of alternative
  reactions involving different substrate (S) combinations, releasing H2S and various
  products (P) (reviewed e.g., in []. GSH is a relevant source of Cys. The oxidized
  GSH (GSSG) export and degradation is mediated by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)
  and it generates Glu and cysteinylglycine (CysGly) dipeptide, which will be further
  degraded, releasing Cys and Gly. The three amino acids are afterwards imported by
  specific transporters. GSH can also be degraded in the cytosol by glutathione-specific
  γ-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 and 2 (CHAC1 and CHAC2) isoenzymes, releasing Glu and
  Cys-Gly that will be again converted in Cys and Gly.'
