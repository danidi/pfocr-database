caption: Proteins that regulate HPV RNA processing are controlled by extracellular
  stimuli and cellular responses. HPV activates the DNA damage response (DDR), the
  Akt signaling pathway and the ERK signaling pathways upon infection. These activations
  may affect HPV RNA processing in different ways. The DDR is activated by HPV E1
  and E7 by an unknown mechanism to replicate the HPV DNA in differentiating cells
  []. DDR activation also affects HPV mRNA processing by (1) dissociating Fip1 and
  CPSF30 from HPV16 early UTR, (2) inducing hnRNP C binding to the HPV16 early UTR,
  thereby alleviating suppression of HPV16 late splice site SD3632 and reducing the
  activity of HPV16 pAE. As a consequence, the activation of the DDR induces HPV16
  late gene expression []. The activity of Akt is restricted to epithelial basal cells
  and Akt is inactivated during epithelial cell differentiation [] or HPV E7 expression
  [], but is often overexpressed in cervical cancer []. Inactivation of Akt reduces
  hnRNP L phosphorylation, which alleviates the silencing of HPV16 late splice sites
  SD3632 and SA5639. Thus, inhibition of the Akt kinase activates HPV late gene expression
  at the level of RNA processing []. The ERK signaling pathway is activated by HPV
  E6 [], and ERK activity affects HPV RNA splicing by controlling E6 exon inclusion
  via ERK-responding splicing factors Sam68, Brm, and hnRNP A1 [].
