caption: Life Cycle of the Phagosome. Phagosomes are formed on demand when professional
  phagocytes encounter target particles such as, opsonized bacteria or apoptotic cells.
  Following internalization of a phagocytic target, the nascent phagosome is transformed
  into a microbiocidal vacuole through successive fusion and fission events within
  the endocytic pathway. During this maturation process, the lumen of the phagosome
  is acidified by the action of v-ATPase, and also acquires hydrolases and other antimicrobial
  proteins. Key steps in the maturation process include the conversion from a Rab5-positive
  early phagosome to a Rab7-positive late phagosome; the acquisition of LAMP and v-ATPase;
  the conversion of PI3P to PI3,5P2; and the appearance of PI4P. Once the particle
  within the phagolysosome has been degraded, PI4P- and Arl8b-dependent membrane tubulation
  and budding events breakdown the organelle, reforming lysosomes consumed in the
  maturation process. EEA1, early endosomal antigen 1; LAMP, lysosome-associated membrane
  protein; PI3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PI3,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-
  bisphosphate; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; Arl8b, ADP-ribosylation factor-like
  protein 8B.
