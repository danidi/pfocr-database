caption: A model of 5-HT biosynthesis and metabolism in peripheral tissues. 5-HT synthesis
  is dependent on the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH); the released 5-HT is controlled
  by the autonomous nervous system and released locally into the circulatory system,
  and most of them are stored in platelets. Reuptake of 5-HT is mediated by SERT.
  The effects of 5-HT are mediated through 14 serotonergic receptors that have been
  grouped into seven broad families. All 5-HTRs are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),
  except 5-HT3 that is a ligand-gated cationic channel. 5-HT GPCRs were coupled to
  all three canonical signaling pathways through Gαi/O, Gαq/11, and Gs that are involved
  in the cAMP pathway and allow this receptor family to modulate several biochemical
  signaling pathways.
