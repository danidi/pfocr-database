caption: A schematic presentation of the mechanisms triggered by HAS3-induced EVs
  in target cells. HAS3-EVs from melanoma cells are possibly interacting with receptors
  such as CD44 present on the surface of recipient cells. As shown in the figure,
  direct fusion with the plasma membrane and endocytosis are also possible mechanisms
  of interaction. IHH present in the EVs activates the HH signaling cascade in the
  recipient cells, leading to the activation of c-Myc and claspin expression. This
  signaling cascade leads to an increase in proliferation and EMT in the recipient
  cells
