caption: In the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is released
  owing to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization mediated by the pro-apoptotic
  effector proteins BAX (BCL-2-associated X protein) and BAK (BCL-2 antagonist/killer).
  Released mtDNA binds to the DNA sensor cGAS (cGAMP synthase), which signals through
  its adaptor STING, TBK1 and IRF3 to activate type I interferon and interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs) , . Cytochrome c is also released by mitochondria, which is sensed
  by the sensor APAF1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1). APAF1 and caspase
  9 assembles the apoptosome to activate effector caspases 3 and 7 (Refs -). During
  apoptosis, caspases 3, 7 and 9 prevent signal transduction by the cGAS-STING pathway
  leading to type I interferon production through an as-yet-undefined mechanism ,
  . The RNA sensor RIG-I recognizes the dsRNA viruses Sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis
  virus (VSV) or the synthetic dsRNA ligand poly(I:C). RIG-I interacts with the adaptor
  mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) at the mitochondria, where the
  kinase RIPK1 is recruited and undergoes K63-linked polyubiquitylation at site Lys-377.
  Mitochondria-associated polyubiquitylated RIPK1 induces activation of antiviral
  responses via TBK1 and IRF3. Following activation of IRF3, polyubiquitylated RIPK1
  is cleaved by caspase 8, whereby cleaved RIPK1 inhibits RIG-I signalling . Caspase
  8 also suppresses activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome . Upon stimulation of Toll-like
  receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4 in dendritic cells, caspase 8 and FADD inhibit the ripoptosome
  composed of the kinases RIPK3 and RIPK1. In the absence of caspase 8 or FADD, the
  ripoptosome signals through the effector MLKL and the mitochondrial serine/threonine-protein
  phosphatase PGAM5 to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome . Caspase 8 and FADD have also
  been proposed to directly interact and inhibit NLRP3. There is also evidence to
  suggest that caspase 8 mediates cleavage of RIPK3, RIPK1 and the deubiquitylating
  enzyme CYLD as a mechanism to inhibit necroptosis and inflammation -.
