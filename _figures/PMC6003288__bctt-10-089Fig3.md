caption: 'Luteolin-mediated extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in breast cancer.Notes:
  Illustration abridging the involvement of luteolin (green) in purposed apoptotic
  pathways. Luteolin sensitized the DR, activated caspase 8, and induced caspase 3-mediated
  apoptosis. Decreased FAS activity directly or indirectly by luteolin leads to apoptosis
  through an unknown mechanism. Inhibition of Akt or ERK leads to increased activity
  in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Circumstantially, luteolin acts as an antioxidant
  or drives ROS-mediated apoptosis. Intracellular proteins color-coded as protein
  kinases (blue), TCFs (gray), and other proteins (brown). Dashed line represents
  possible luteolin interaction.Abbreviations: DR, death receptor; Lu, luteolin; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; TCFs, transcription factors.'
