caption: Schematic diagram of metabolic pathways controlling activation and lineage
  specification in the immune system. Depicted surface receptors and intracellular
  transducers exemplify those that operate in T cells, regulate or are regulated by
  metabolic pathways, and exhibit genetic linkage with systemic lupus erythematosus
  (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. Characteristics of mitochondrial dysfunction
  include blocked electron transport chain (ETC) activity, elevated mitochondrial
  transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) or mitochondrial hyperpolarization, and diminished
  mitophagy, which contribute to accumulation of oxidative stress–generating mitochondria
  and depletion of ATP and glutathione (GSH). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated
  by electron (E) transfer to O2 at complex I. These metabolic changes underlie the
  activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which promotes
  glycolysis in CD4+ T cells, further enhancing the accumulation of mitochondria in
  necrosis‐prone, proinflammatory double‐negative (DN) T cells and depleting Treg
  cells. Thus, key metabolic features of T cell dysfunction in SLE are balancing of
  energy production between the mitochondrial ETC and glycolysis, and securing of
  amino acids during starvation through autophagy of proteins and organelles while
  mitochondria are selectively retained. The direction of signaling is indicated by
  arrows (red = increase, blue = decrease). Drugs that affect metabolism are shown
  in green. IL‐6 = interleukin‐6; NAC = N‐acetyl‐cysteine; Drp1 = dynamin‐related
  protein 1; HCQ = hydroxychloroquine; TCA = tricarboxylic acid; 2DG = 2‐deoxyglucose;
  Acetyl‐CoA = acetyl‐coenzyme A; VLDLR = very low‐density lipoprotein receptor; MMF
  = mycophenolate mofetil; LDLR = low‐density lipoprotein receptor; G6P = glucose‐6‐phosphate;
  PPP = pentose phosphate pathway; G6PD = glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGL
  = 6‐phosphogluconolactonase; GSSG = oxidized glutathione; TAL = transaldolase; 6PG = 6‐phosphogluconate;
