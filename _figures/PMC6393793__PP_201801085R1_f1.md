caption: THI4-mediated synthesis of the thiamin thiazole precursors and their possible
  relationship to MVT. A, In the plant thiazole synthesis pathway, THI4 forms the
  adenylated thiazole precursor ADT from NAD+, Gly, and a sulfur atom stripped from
  an active-site Cys residue, which is changed to dehydro-Ala (DHAla). The inactive
  DHAla form of THI4 is degraded. ADT is cleaved to give cThz-P, the direct precursor
  of thiamin. MVT could theoretically be derived from ADT or cThz-P by decarboxylation
  and elimination of ADP or phosphate, respectively (hypothetical reactions shown
  in blue). B, In thiazole synthesis in Methanococci, sulfide (as HS-) serves as the
  sulfur donor, and the THI4 enzyme is not inactivated in the reaction. The pathway
  is otherwise the same as in plants. C, Partial sequence alignment showing the active
  site Cys in Arabidopsis THI4 and its replacement by His in Methanococcus jannaschii
  THI4.
