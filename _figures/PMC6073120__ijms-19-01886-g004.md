caption: Endocytic trafficking of PAR1. PAR1 undergoes constitutive and agonist-activated
  internalization induced by thrombin cleavage of the N-terminus or by the peptide
  agonist SFLLRN. Unactivated PAR1 is constitutively internalized by AP-2 recognition
  of a distal tyrosine-based motif within the cytoplasmic C-terminus of PAR1. Internalized
  PAR1 is then sorted to early endosomes and then recycled back to the cell surface
  via a Rab11B-dependent pathway, whereas a small pool of receptor escapes recycling
  and is sorted by Rab11A to lysosomes and degraded. In contrast, agonist activation
  of PAR1 results in rapid phosphorylation and ubiquitination and internalization
  through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway mediated by AP-2 and epsin-1.
  AP-2 binds the phosphorylated distal C-terminus of activated PAR1 rather than the
  tyrosine-based motif to regulate activated PAR1 internalization. PAR1 activation
  also promotes epsin-1 deubiquitination, facilitating the ability of epsin-1 to bind
  activated PAR1 to facilitate internalization. Internalized PAR1 is then sorted sequentially
  at early endosomes by engaging AP-3 and SNX1 followed by ALIX, which requires ARRDC3
  and WWP2-mediated ALIX ubiquitination and dimerization. ALIX, ARRDC3 and WWP2 are
  essential for targeting PAR1 to intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs)/late
  endosomes via ECSRT-III charged MVB protein 4 (CHMP4) and AAA-ATPase vacuolar protein
  sorting 4 (Vps4). Degradation of PAR1 in lysosomes is ultimately required for signal
  termination.
