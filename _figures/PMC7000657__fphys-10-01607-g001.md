caption: Pathways linking local obesity-induced inflammation to systemic insulin resistance.
  Obesity results in the activation of the inflammatory signaling pathways mediated
  by JNK and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Once activated, these pathways induce
  the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipocytes, which contribute
  to insulin resistance and pro-inflammatory macrophages infiltration. Activation
  of the JNK signaling pathway starts the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes
  and inhibits the insulin signaling pathway through the insulin receptor substrate-1
  (IRS-1) inhibitory serine phosphorylation, which reduces the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) signaling pathway. Instead, NF-κB signaling
  pathway activation culminates in the increased expression of several NF-κB target
  genes such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte
  chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), which leads to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, therefore
  preventing insulin signaling. The inflammatory mediators including free fatty acids
  (FFA), IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 also spread through systemic circulation and activate
  JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways in the liver and skeletal muscle, inhibiting systemic
  insulin signaling. GLUT4, glucose transporter type 4.
