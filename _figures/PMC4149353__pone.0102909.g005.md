number: Figure 5
caption: (a) Overlap between proteins and differentially expressed genes in striatum,
  as measured by mass spectrometry and microarray technologies. The overlap of upregulated
  proteins/genes is shown on the left, the overlap of downregulated proteins/genes
  on the right. (b) Overlap between proteins and differentially expressed genes in
  PD cortex, as measured by proteomics and microarray technologies. The overlap of
  upregulated proteins/genes is shown on the left, the overlap of downregulated proteins/genes
  on the right. (c) Oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The most significantly enriched
  upregulated pathway for PD cortex based on proteomics data. Red thermometers represent
  proteins with increased abundance. (d) Regulation of CDK5 in presynaptic signaling.
  The most significantly enriched downregulated pathway for PD cortex based on proteomics
  data. Blue thermometers represent proteins with decreased abundance.
