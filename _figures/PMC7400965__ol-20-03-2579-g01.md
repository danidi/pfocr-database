caption: Difference between SHARPIN presence and absence in regulating the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. (A) Presence of SHARPIN promotes canonical NF-κB signaling activation.
  Once stimulators bind with the receptors, associated molecules are recruited to
  activate the IKK complex. The complete LUBAC is involved in this process that serves
  a role in ubiquitination and fully activates the IKK complex. Subsequently, the
  phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IKBα contributes to the degradation of IKBα,
  which generates dimers. The dimers translocate into the nucleus and mediate target
  gene transcription. (B) Absence of SHARPIN attenuates canonical NF-κB signaling
  activation. When SHARPIN is absent, the LUBAC attenuates the phosphorylation and
  ubiquitination of IKBα, resulting in reduced IKBα degradation and inhibiting dimer
  translocation into the nucleus. Therefore, transcription of the target genes is
  inhibited. SHARPIN, shank-associated RH domain interactor; IKK, inhibition of κB
  kinase; LUBAC, linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex; TNF, tumor necrosis factor;
  TNFR1, TNF receptor 1; TRADD, TNFR type 1-associated DEATH domain protein; TRAF2,
  TNFR-associated factor 2; RIP1, receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase
  1; cIAP1/2, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1/2; FADD, FAS-associated death
  domain protein; HOIL-1L, heme-oxidized IRP2 ligase 1L; HOIP, HOIL-1 interacting
  protein; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; p, phosphorylated; Ub, ubiquitinated.
