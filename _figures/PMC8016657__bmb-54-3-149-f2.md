caption: Roles of Epac in synaptic plasticity, neurodevelopment, and cell death. (A)
  Effects of 8-CPT-induced activation and gene deletion of Epac. The 8-CPT activates
  both Epac1 and Epac2 in neural tissues. Note the stronger effect of 8-CPT on Epac1
  activation (thick arrow) than Epac2 (thin arrow). Activation of Epac protein including
  Epac1 and Epac2 isoforms contributes to LTP maintenance via extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2 (ERK) activation, PACAP-mediated LTD induction via activation of p38
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), apoptosis by p38 MAPK-induced upregulation
  of Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator known as a Bcl-2 like protein 11), and inhibition
  of mTOR-independent autophagy activation through Rap2B/PLCε/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) signaling pathway. However, effects of 8-CPT-induced Epac activation on neurite
  outgrowth and synaptic glutamate release are quite different and are not determined
  yet in neural tissue. (B) Role of Epac1 in neurite and axonal growth. Epac1 is involved
  in axonal growth through Rap1/ERK/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) signaling
  pathway. In Rap-independent manner, Epac1 plays a role in enhancement or inhibition
  of neurite growth via Rit/CREB activation or accumulation itself near plasma membrane
  regardless of binding to cAMP, respectively. (C) Role Epac2 and Epac2A isoform in
  neural tissues. Epac2 involves in adult neurogenesis and glial differentiation,
  apoptotic cell death and induces synaptic spine shrinkage and neurite outgrowth.
  The asymmetric expression of Ras/Epac2/Rap in dendritic compartments of cortical
  neurons affects the distribution of phosphorylated BRaf (p-BRaf) in dendrites and
  then maintenance of basal dendrite complexity in cortical neurons. However, the
  effect of Epac2 on LTP induction and maintenance is a controversial issue showing
  different results according to neural tissues. Epac2A isoform is required for LTD
  induction but not LTP in the hippocampus and astrocyte differentiation during development.
  LTP, long-term potentiation; LTD, long-term depression.
