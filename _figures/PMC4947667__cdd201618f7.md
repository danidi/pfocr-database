caption: In the presence of TAp73 (right panel) and following TGF-β receptor activation
  by TGF-β, SMAD-dependent pathway is activated, promoting tumor-suppressive functions
  including BGN secretion, which traps TGF-β within the ECM. In the absence of TAp73
  (left panel), the presence/activity of SMADs proteins are limited favoring, after
  TGF-β stimulation, the induction of the oncogenic SMAD-independent pathway leading
  to EMT. As a consequence, BGN expression/secretion is reduced, limiting TGF-β trapping
  within the ECM, which creates a positive loop that reinforce the oncogenic impact
  of SMAD-independent pathways
