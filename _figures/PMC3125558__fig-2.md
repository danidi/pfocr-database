caption: KEGG pathway diagrams containing significantly altered metabolites. Significant
  urinary metabolites are shown on KEGG pathway diagrams with direction of change
  indicated. For completeness, identified metabolites with nonsignificant changes
  are also shown. Gray circles represent unobserved metabolites in this study, but
  in the KEGG pathway libraries. (a) Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. (b) Benzoate
  degradation via hydroxylation. (c) Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism.
