caption: 'Neddylation pathways influencing NF-κB and HIF-1α. Left, NF-κB pathway:
  Pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS, facilitate the phosphorylation of IκB, leading
  to the recognition of p-IκB by the Cul-1–Nedd8–βTRCP complex, culminating in its
  polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The conjugation of Nedd8 to Cul-1
  is required for polyubiquitination and is achieved through a multi-enzyme process
  wherein DEN-1 cleaves the Nedd8 precursor to its mature form, allowing for conjugation
  to cullin proteins. Loss of DEN-1, or pharmacological inhibition of Nedd8 conjugation
  by MLN4924 through inhibition of the Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE), prevents the
  activation of Cul-1, preventing the liberation of NF-κB from IκB and quenching pro-inflammatory
  signaling. The binding of adenosine to adenosine receptors (AdoR) also results in
  deneddylation of Cul-1. Studies are ongoing regarding a potential regulation of
  DEN-1 activity by adenosine and AdoR. Right, HIF-1α pathway: In contrast to NF-κB,
  HIF-1α in its hydroxylated form is degraded by the proteasome after ubiquitination
  via the Cul-2–Nedd8–pVHL complex. Pharmacological inhibition of Cul-2 neddylation
  using MLN4924 stabilizes cellular HIF-1α levels, leading to increased transcription
  of pro-resolving HIF target genes. Loss of DEN-1 also positively influences barrier
  function of intestinal epithelial cells.'
