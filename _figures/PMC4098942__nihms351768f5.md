caption: Increased activity or ectopic expression of proteins in green boxes promotes
  mitotic proliferation. In the case of glp-1(gf) mutants, this results in germline
  tumor formation. Decreased activity of proteins in red boxes, either alone or in
  combination, also induces hyperproliferation and tumor formation. For simplicity,
  only a subset of known germline regulators is shown. In some cases genes depicted
  to act in parallel to GLP-1, such as TEG-4 and METT-10, may integrate their functions
  more directly within the GLP-1 pathway. Note the high degree of regulatory cross-talk
  between the core factors (gray lines). Dashed lines and question marks indicate
  predicted regulatory connections and missing components, respectively.
