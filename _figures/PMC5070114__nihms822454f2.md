caption: Biochemical/molecular pathway by which maternal hyperglycemia may cause birth
  defects. Excess glucose transported to the embryo is metabolized. Increased glycolytic
  flux stimulates glucosamine-6-PO4synthesis (GN-6-P), which inhibits G6PD activity,
  which decreases NADPH synthesis, which decreases GSH synthesis. Increased glycolytic
  flux also stimulates the DAG/PKC pathway, which may also inhibit NADPH and GSH synthesis.
  Increased glucose metabolism, some of which is aerobic, increases oxygen consumption
  faster than it can be delivered, which stimulates superoxide production. Increased
  superoxide production increases hydrogen peroxide production, which, due to decreased
  GSH availability, leads to increased production of the hydroxyl radical, rather
  than water. The resulting oxidative stress inhibits expression of critical regulatory
  genes (such as Pax3), which leads to derepression of a cell cycle regulator (such
  as p53), which leads to apoptosis. Loss of a critical mass of progenitor cells by
  a newly forming organ or structure will lead to a birth defect.
