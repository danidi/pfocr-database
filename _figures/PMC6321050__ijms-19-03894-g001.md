caption: Summary of the proposed mechanisms of maternal cognitive impairment associated
  with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The red ‘X’ and dashed arrows indicate
  inhibition and negative regulation respectively. Four mechanisms of GDM-induced
  cognitive impairment are covered here, which are hyperglycemia, insulin resistance,
  oxidative stress, and inflammation. In hyperglycemic condition, advanced glycation
  end products (AGEs) are overproduced, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation,
  and dysfunction of cerebral flow. Dysfunction of cerebral flow can lead to cognitive
  dysfunction through disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport mechanism
  that transport important molecules such as choline into the brain and clears unwanted
  molecules such as amyloid-β (Aβ) protein. In cases of insulin resistance, the insulin-signaling
  pathway is inactivated primarily through serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor
  substance (IRS-1). This inactivates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase
  B (PI3K/AKT) signaling cascade, which blocks the translocation of glucose transporter
  4 (GLUT4), decreasing glucose uptake. Additionally, glycogen synthase kinase 3β
  (GSK3β) is also activated causing the hyperphosphorylation of τ proteins and overexpression
  of Aβ proteins. Instances such as overexpression of AGEs, insulin resistance and
  mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to oxidative stress, which cause the overexpression
  of Aβ. Free fatty acid (FFA) triggers activation of the microglia via nuclear factor
  kappa β (NF-κB) signaling production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis
  factor α; TNF-α, interleukin 1β; IL-1β, interleukin 6; IL-6) additionally, Aβ induces
  the production of Nuclear factor-kappa β; NF-κβ, which also releases pro-inflammatory
  cytokines.
