caption: Schematic of the UPR cycle. The UPR encompasses at least three pathways that
  are activated by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. The PERK pathway
  is one of these and is activated by phosphorylation of the eIF2α protein to suppress
  global protein synthesis while activating expression of a series of transcription
  factors, including ATF4 and CHOP. CHOP expression is an important marker of PERK
  pathway activation, but our data suggest that it is unlikely to be a rate-limiting
  step. Nonetheless, CHOP expression is an obligatory step, which induces GADD34 expression,
  leading to dephosphorylation of phospho-eIF2α and the resumption of global protein
  synthesis. At this point of rekindled ribosome assembly, stochastic processes, such
  as the loss of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum stores, ATP depletion, redox changes/oxidative
  stress, or increased metabolism mediated by extrinsic growth factor signaling through
  cell surface receptors, may render cells transiently vulnerable to cell death as
  they attempt to restore normal cell function, leading to context-dependent and cell
  type-specific demise. In the event that cells reestablish homeostasis, subsequent
  metabolic events, such as the expression of a mutant protein in the case of rsh
  mice, cause protein aggregation and drive another UPR cycle and another period of
  stochastic vulnerability as the cell emerges from the UPR. Such periodic entry and
  exit from successive UPR cycles may continue for days or weeks or until the cell
  succumbs to apoptosis. Further, the more rapid or severe the accumulation of mutant
  proteins, the more frequently the cell activates the UPR and the greater the cumulative
  risk for apoptosis.
