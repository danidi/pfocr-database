  lactate dehydrogenase (ISCW013290, B7QA60); GDG, Glutamate dehydrogenase; PEPCK,
  Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; OAA, oxaloacetic acid.
  Accession numbers are listed for genes/proteins that did not change in expression/representation
  between infected and uninfected tick cells; the remaining accession numbers are
