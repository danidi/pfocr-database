caption: Hypothetical model to depict the role of Trpc1 channels in linking the inhibition
  of BMP pathway by noggin, and the activation of Cav1.2 channels in ectodermal cells.
  During gastrulation, the cells of the embryonic ectoderm have the choice between
  two fates; they can give rise to either epidermal or neural progenitors. In the
  plasma membrane, the molecular components involved in this choice are BMP receptors
  type I (BmprI) and type II (BmprII), Trpc1 and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Cav1.2).
  The membrane potential in the ectoderm is ~−60 mV; i.e., the interior is negatively
  charged. (A) Induction of the epidermis occurs through a signalling cascade, which
  involves the binding of Bmp4 to its receptor, and then the transphosphorylation
  of BmprII by BmprI. This is followed by the activation of Smads, which translocate
  into the nucleus to form active transcriptional complexes to control the expression
  of epidermal genes. In this scenario, there is no interaction between Trpc1 and
  BmprII, and Cav1.2 remains inactive. (B) During neural induction, noggin binds to
  BMP4, and thus prevents the activation of the BMP pathway. As a consequence, it
  induces a physical interaction between BmprII and Trpc1 channels. This interaction
  leads to the activation of Trpc1, which either alone or associated with other Trp
  channels (e.g., Trpv4), triggers an influx of cations (Ca2+ and Na+). This influx
  of cations depolarizes the membrane (i.e., there is more positive charge inside)
  up to a threshold sufficient to open the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, Cav1.2. As
  we have previously shown,, the resulting influx of Ca2+ is then sufficient to activate
  the expression of downstream neural specific genes, such as prmt1b, zic3 and sox2.
