caption: 'This figure illustrates our understanding of signaling from the A1 receptor
  to smooth muscle contraction. Adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) are sensitive to CCPA
  and coupled to phospholipase C (PLCX) by G-proteins (GX). Candidates for PLCX include
  PLCβ1, PLCβ3, and PLCγ1, while candidates for GX include Gi, Go, Gq, G11 as well
  as G-βγ subunits (, ). PLCX produces two second messengers from phosphatidylinositol
  4,5 bisphosphate: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3, which
  releases Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; SR). DAG can be metabolized by di-
  and monoacylglycerol lipases to produce arachidonic acid (AA). CYP4a metabolizes
  AA into 20-HETE, which activates PKC-α (DAG is also an activator; PKC- β and γ isoforms
  are also expressed (). The ERK1/2 pathway is activated downstream of PKC-α. The
  culmination of this signaling is to contract smooth muscle through effects on, e.g.,
  myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), and thin
  filament regulatory proteins. Inhibiting CYP4a with HET0016 blocks CCPA-induced
  smooth muscle contraction (). Gö6976 and PD98095, which inhibit PKC-α and ERK1/2,
  inhibit smooth muscle contraction in response to 20-HETE ().'
