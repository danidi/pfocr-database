caption: Proposed involvement of FGF9/FGFR2 signalling in human fetal gonad development.
  A model illustrating the interaction between key factors involved in early gonad
  development. SRY upregulates SOX9 in Sertoli cells of the developing testes resulting
  in the self-promoting expression of SOX9, which is followed by expression of additional
  testis-promoting factors, including FGF9. FGF9 signals through FGFR2 to inhibit
  the pro-ovarian factor WNT4 (and the RSPO1/β-catenin pathway). The present study
  confirmed the FGF9-mediated inhibition of meiotic entry in female germ cells previously
  demonstrated in human fetal ovaries (). Additionally, this study suggests the involvement
  of FGF9/FGFR2 in the expression of SOX9 in human fetal testes. Finally, the present
  study suggests involvement of FGF9/FGFR2 signalling in supporting germ cell survival
  in both sexes.1 Reviewed in .
