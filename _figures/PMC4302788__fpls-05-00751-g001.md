caption: 'Metabolic pathway of sulfur assimilation in Arabidopsis. The illustration
  shows subcellular partitioning of sulfate assimilation and APS/PAPS metabolic pathways
  in plastids and cytosol in Arabidopsis. Cys, Met, and GSH biosynthetic pathways
  are simplified in this diagram to describe their connections downstream of the reductive
  sulfate assimilation pathway. The names of enzymes and transporters are indicated
  in bold italicized letters. Closed and open circles indicate sulfate transporter
  and PAPS transporter, respectively. Cytosolic ATP sulfurylase (cyt-ATPS2) forms
  by alternative translational initiation (). Abbreviations of metabolites: APS, adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate;
  Cys, cysteine; GLS, glucosinolate; GSH, glutathione; Met, methionine; PAP, 5′-phosphoadenosine
  3′-phosphate; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate. Abbreviations of enzymes
  and transporters: APK, APS kinase; APR, APS reductase; ATPS, ATP sulfurylase; FRY1,
  inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (FIERY1); PAPST1, PAPS transporter; SiR, sulfite
  reductase; SOT, sulfotransferase; SULTR, sulfate transporter.'
