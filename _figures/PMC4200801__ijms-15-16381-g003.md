caption: Current strategies to generate tolDCs. (A) Metabolic control of different
  cellular processes such as inhibition of mitochondiral phosphorylation (Dexamethasone-
  Dex), glycolysis, lipid metabolism (PPARγ agonists such as rosiglitazone) and cell
  cycling (rapamycin); (B) Drug intervention to promote the induction of tolDCs is
  mainly achieved by drugs, which interfere with NF-κB signaling pathway (Dex-dexamethasone,
  VD3-vitamin D3, aspirin, BAY11-7082). NF-κB signaling pathway is a crucial event
  during DC activation and maturation process; (C) Biological compounds such as the
  anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β are powerful tolerogenic agents which
  induce tolDCs with the capacity of secrete high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines;
  (D) The modification of DCs with RNAi and lentivirus (or adenovirus) vectors offers
  new approaches to generate tolDCs. By the transduction of RNAi specific for pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL12, IL23) or co-stimulatory molecules (CD40 and CD86), the immunogenicity
  of DCs is severely affected. In contrast, the transduction of lentiviral (or adenoviral)
  vectors containing anti-inflammatory genes, such as heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) or IL-10,
  could also induce the generation of tolDCs which keep the capacity of produce anti-inflammatory
  cytokines with a low expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Generally, independent
  of the protocol used to induce the tolerogenic phenotype, tolDCs are resistant to
  pro-inflammatory stimuli. Remarkably, when tolDCs interact with T cells, they prevent
  cellular activation, proliferation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-4, IL-17 and IFNγ while inducing (or no effect on) the production of
  IL-10. In addition, tolDCs could also interact with B cells reducing activation,
  plasma cell differentiation and the production of immunoglobulins. All these data
  promote tolDCs as a potential approach for the treatment of systemic autoimmune
  diseases in which both T and B cells responses are deregulated. Black arrows indicate
  inflammatory pathways. Grey arrows indicate anti-inflammatory pathways. Blunted
  lines indicate inhibition.
