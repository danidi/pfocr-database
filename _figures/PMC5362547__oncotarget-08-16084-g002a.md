caption: A. Modulation of the actin cytoskeleton affects YAP activity. Extracellular
  matrix stiffness, cell geometry, cell-cell contacts, and F-actin-modulated proteins
  regulate YAP and TAZ activity. Rho family small GTPases play a key role in actin
  cytoskeleton organization. LPA- and S1P-activated Gα12/13-protein-coupled receptors
  inhibit Lats1/2 kinase activity, whereas glucagon- and epinephrine-activated Gαs-protein-coupled
  receptors stimulate Lats1/2 kinase activity. Gαq/11 protein can either activate
  or inhibit YAP activity. B. In mammals, apical domain protein NF2 and Kibra act
  as upstream regulators of Hippo core components. To activate the Hippo signaling
  pathway, NF2 and Kibra may require Tao-1 kinase activity. The junctional proteins
  AMOT, 14-3-3, and PTPN14 interact with YAP directly and inhibit its activity. The
  basolateral domain protein Scribble acts downstream of the tumor suppressor LKB1
  and MARK to regulate the Hippo signaling pathway. C. PDK1 associates with Mst and
  Lats kinase through Sav, and these complexes induce YAP-S127 phosphorylation. Epidermal
  growth factor-mediated PI3K activation triggers the dissociation of PDK1 and Hippo
  core components that fail to promote YAP phosphorylation. Nuclear YAP and TAZ promote
  SHP2-dependent dephosphorylation of parafibromin. The phosphorylated parafibromin
  interacts with β-catenin and activates Wnt target gene transcription. However, cytoplasmic
  YAP and TAZ inhibit the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin as integral components
  of the Wnt signaling pathway. TAZ, YAP, SMAD2/3, and TEAD physically interact in
  the nucleus and share a transcriptional program. D. Glucose deprivation leads to
  AMOTL1 phosphorylation by AMPK. Phosphorylated AMOTL1 is more stabilized and promotes
  YAP-S127 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion. AMPK also inhibits the transcriptional
  activity of YAP through direct phosphorylation. The mevalonate pathway can promote
  Rho GTPase activity through geranylgeranylation, thus enhancing YAP and TAZ activity.
  Under hypoxic conditions, a positive feedback loop may be established to enhance
  HIF1, YAP, and TAZ activity.
