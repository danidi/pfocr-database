caption: Schematic overview of presynaptic proteins that were altered in AD. The “synaptic
  vesicle pathway” (hsa04721) was modified from KEGG (), and the proteins with altered
  expression in AD in our MS dataset were highlighted in different shades of green
  according to their ratio. The proteins with dashed line were added to the original
  pathway.

  description: Schematic overview of presynaptic proteins that were altered in AD.
    The “synaptic vesicle pathway” (hsa04721) was modified from KEGG (), and the proteins
    with altered expression in AD in our MS dataset were highlighted in different
    shades of green according to their ratio. The proteins with dashed line were added
    to the original pathway.
