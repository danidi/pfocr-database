caption: Schematic of glycolysis and ancillary glucose metabolism pathways. Once glucose
  enters the cell, it can enter the polyol pathway or it can be phosphorylated to
  form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which isomerizes to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P).
  The F6P is then phosphorylated by phosphofructokinase (PFK)—the major rate-limiting
  and committed step in glycolysis—to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP). These
  reactions comprise the preparatory phase of glycolysis and use ATP. In addition,
  glycolytic metabolites in this phase of glycolysis serve as precursors to the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), and the glycogen
  synthetic pathway. The payoff phase commences with the splitting of F-1,6-BP into
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). DHAP is
  a precursor for the glycerolipid pathway (GLP), important for the synthesis of glycerophospholipids.
  GAP is oxidized and phosphorylated to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The formation of
  3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) then provides precursors for the serine biosynthesis pathway
  (SBP), which yields serine and glycine and intersects with one-carbon metabolism
  to regulate the abundance of epigenetic modifiers such as methyl donors and α-ketoglutarate.
  HK indicates hexokinase; OAA, oxaloacetate; PC, pyruvate kinase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PFK, phosphofructokinase; and PKM, pyruvate kinase M.
