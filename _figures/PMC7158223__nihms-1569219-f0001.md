caption: Proteome content can be regulated by RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis,
  signaling pathways and protein degradation. RNA splicing can produce mRNAs that
  code for distinct protein isoforms, introduce premature stop codons, or cause UTR
  variation that alters translational efficiency. mRNA methylation can alter transcript
  stability, localization and translational efficiency. Methylation and pseudouridylation
  of rRNA and tRNA can impact ribosome biogenesis, polysome assembly, translation
  fidelity and tRNA stability. RNA editing can alter miRNA biogenesis and alter mRNA
  coding or UTR sequence to alter translational efficiency. The mTOR signaling pathway
  can promote protein synthesis by enhancing the translation of ribosomal protein
  mRNAs via phosphorylation of Larp1, ribosome biogenesis via phosphorylation and
  activation of S6K, and translation initiation via phosphorylation and inhibition
  of 4E-BPs. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a major cellular degradation system
  that contributes to maintaining proteostasis in stem cells by regulating both the
  content and quality of the proteome through the normal turnover of proteins and
  the degradation of misfolded proteins.
