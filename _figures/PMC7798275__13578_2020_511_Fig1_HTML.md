caption: A simplified summary of CNS glucose metabolism, and commonly observed defects
  in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Glucose enters into neurons via glucose
  transporter (GLUT3) and via GLUT1 into astrocytes. In this figure, the astrocyte
  foot process is shown wrapping around the capillary. Then, glucose is phosphorylated
  by hexokinase (HK) to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). G6P can be converted by glucose
  6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) to 6-phospho gluconolactone to enter the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), where it is converted by a series of enzymatic reactions
  to subsequent PPP intermediates, such as R5P (ribose 5-phosphate) which later can
  enter the glycolytic pathway via glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) or provide nucleotide
  backbones. G6P may also be converted to glucose 1-phosphate which is utilized for
  glycogen synthesis. If G6P continues through glycolysis, it is converted into F6P
  (fructose 6 phosphate) and later to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16BP) by phosphofructokinase
  (PFK). F16BP is further metabolised to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), phosphoenol
  pyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate, by a series of enzymatic processes including pyruvate
  kinase (PK) which converts PEP into pyruvate. Pyruvate can be reduced to lactate
  by lactate dehydrogenase or enters mitochondria via mitochondrial pyruvate carrier
  (MPC) and gets converted into acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Acetyl-CoA
  condenses with oxaloacetate to citrate and thereby enters the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle generates different TCA cycle intermediates, including
  α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) from which glutamate can be synthesized. During neurotransmission,
  glutamate is released from the presynaptic vesicles into the synapse where it is
  taken up by glutamate transporters in astrocytes and then converted into glutamine
  (Gln) by glutamine synthetase (GS). Gln can also be transferred into neurons and
  gets converted into Glu by phosphate activated glutaminase (PAG), completing the
  Glu-Gln shuttle. In GABAergic neurons, Glu is converted into GABA by glutamate decarboxylase
  (GAD) enzyme. The TCA cycle also generates reducing equivalents such as nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide, which transfer electrons
  to oxygen via the enzyme complexes of the electron transport chain, ultimately resulting
  in the generation of ATP. In ALS, numerous metabolic defects (shown in red) at various
  steps in the glucose metabolism pathway that alter glucose metabolism and overall
  ATP generation have been described. This include impairments in glucose transport
  (changes in glucose transporter expression or HK activities), glycolysis (reduced
  activities of pyruvate kinase and phosphoglycerate kinase, reduced levels of lactate
  and reduced activities of PK), and PPP (reduced activities of G6PDH and reduced
  levels of R5P), increased glycogen accumulation, reduced entry of pyruvate into
  the TCA cycle (increased protein levels of PDH kinase 1, which downregulates PDH
  activity; reduced activities of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH)), mitochondrial
  dysfunction, reduced mitochondrial ATP production, increased reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production, as well as abnormal neuronal-glial interactions (reduced transfer
  of glutamate to glutamine, and glutamate excitotoxicity)
