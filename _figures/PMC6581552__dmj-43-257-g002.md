caption: . Bile acid synthesis, enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, and bile
  acid transport. In human hepatocytes, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes
  the first and rate-limiting step in the classic pathway of bile acid synthesis in
  which cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are synthesized from cholesterol.
  Sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) is required for synthesis of CA, and without this
  enzyme CDCA is synthesized. The alternative pathway is initiated by sterol 27-hydroxylase
  (CYP27A1), which catalyzes steroid side-chain oxidation, followed by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7B1), which synthesizes the oxidized sterols that form CA and CDCA in hepatocytes.
  CYP7A1 is liver-specific, while CYP27A1 and CYP7B1 are expressed in extrahepatic
  tissues and macrophages. Bile acids are conjugated to the amino acids taurine (T)
  or glycine (G) for secretion into bile via bile salt export pump (BSEP). Bile acids
  are reabsorbed in the ileum via apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT)
  in enterocytes, where gut bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) de-conjugates bile
  acids and 7α-dehydroxylase removes a hydroxyl group to form the secondary bile acids,
  deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) from CA and CDCA, respectively.
  Bile acids are effluxed to portal blood via organic solute transporter α and β (OSTα/OSTβ)
  dimers and are transported to hepatocytes via Na2+-dependent taurocholate co-transporting
  peptide (NTCP) where they inhibit bile acid synthesis. Bile acids activate hepatic
  farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to induce small heterodimer partner (SHP), which inhibits
  CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 gene transcription. In enterocytes, bile acid activation of FXR
  induces fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). FGF19 is transported to hepatocytes
  to activate FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4)/β-Klotho complex, which activates EKR1/2 signaling
  to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription. Bile acids activate Takeda G protein-coupled
  receptor 5 (TGR5) in intestinal L-cells, leading to secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1
  (GLP-1), which stimulates insulin secretion from β-cells. In adipose tissue, activation
  of TGR5 stimulates cAMP/cAMP response element binding protein (CREBP) to induce
  thyroid hormone deiodinase type 2 (DIO2), which converts thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine
  (T3) and stimulates energy metabolism. ERK1/2, extracellular regulated kinase 1
  and 2; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; GCA, glycocholic acid;
  GCDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid; TCA, taurocholic acid; TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic
  acid.
