caption: Scheme depicting role of HORMAD1 in DSB signaling and repair. Our immunofluorescence
  microscopy analyses (Fig. ) show that formation of CtIP, RAD51 and RPA p34-containing
  IRIF is reduced in HORMAD1-depleted cancer cells (whereas 53BP1 and p95/NBS1 foci
  remain intact in the absence of HORMAD1). We infer that HORMAD1 contributes to HR
  pathway activation at (or prior to) the CtIP-mediated resection step, but does not
  affect the proximal stages of DSB signaling. HORMAD1-depletion leads to attenuation
  of DR-GFP/HR reporter activity (Fig. ), prolonged IR-induced ATM signaling (Fig. ),
  and radiosensitivity (Fig. ), further demonstrating that HORMAD1 promotes the HR
  pathway.
