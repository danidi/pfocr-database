caption: Cellular entry of HCV particles. HCV virion is associated with lipoproteins
  to form a complex particle that has been called lipoviroparticle (LVP). It initiates
  its life cycle by binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Then the virus can follow
  either a productive or a non-productive pathway. In the non-productive pathway,
  the lipoprotein component of the viral particle interacts with the LDL receptor
  (LDL-R) and the virion is rapidly internalized and potentially sent to a degradation
  pathway. The productive pathway is a complex multistep process involving a series
  of specific cellular entry factors, which include SRB1, CD81, tight-junction proteins,
  CLDN1 and OCLN, as well as other cellular factors not represented in this figure.
  After binding to several components of the host cell, HCV particle is internalized
  by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and fusion takes place in early endosomes.
