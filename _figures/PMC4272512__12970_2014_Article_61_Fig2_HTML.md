caption: 'Immune, antioxidant and inflammatory targets that L-glutamine, L-arginine
  and BCAA are involved. From L-glutamine, glutamate (GLU) is produced through glutaminase
  activity (GLS), releasing ammonium ion (NH4+). Inside of mitochondria or in the
  cytosol, glutamate from L-glutamine, L-leucine (LEU) or L-arginine (ARG) is an important
  fuel (ATP) and/or precursor for the synthesis of intermediate metabolism of amino
  acids such as ornithine (ORN), antioxidant defenses such as glutathione (GSH), anabolic
  signals through mTOR cascade, and cell repair system such the as the heat shock
  proteins (HSPs). HSPs are modulated by the heat shock factor 1, which is activated
  by the glucosamine pathway, sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and human antigen R (Hur), also known
  as nutrient sensors. De novo L-glutamine synthesis can occur through L-glutamine
  synthetase (GS), using glutamate, ATP and ammonia (NH3). L-glutamine is transported
  inside the cell trough active transport with sodium (Na+) potassium (K+) ATPase,
  which augment the absorption of water, altering the volume of the cell and stimulate
  the resistance to damage. L-arginine availability is important to NO production
  through nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) and citrulline (CIT). Other Abbreviations:
  heat shock elements (HSEs); oxidized GSH (GSSG); GSH-S reductase (GSR); glutamate
  dehydrogenase (GLUD); alpha-ketoglutarato (α-KG).'
