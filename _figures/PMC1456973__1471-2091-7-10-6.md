caption: The role of aspartate and aspartate transport in the pathway of prostate
  citrate production. Aspartate via mAAT provides the four-carbon source of oxalacetate
  that condenses with acetyl coA for citrate synthesis. The oxidation of citrate via
  the Krebs cycle is prevented by the inhibition of m-aconitase by zinc. The utilized
  aspartate is replenished by the transport of aspartate from interstitial fluid by
  the EAAC1 aspartate transporter. Note the extremely high concentration of citrate
  in prostatic fluid secretion that requires a substantial and continuous supply of
  aspartate. mAAT = mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase; GDH = glutamic dehydrogenase;
  CS = citrate synthase; ACON = mitochondrial aconitase; PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase.

papertitle: EAAC1 is expressed in rat and human prostate epithelial cells; functions
  as a high-affinity L-aspartate transporter; and is regulated by prolactin and testosterone.
