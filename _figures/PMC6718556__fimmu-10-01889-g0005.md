caption: 'Several metabolic mechanisms may provide an advantage to Tregs in the tumor
  microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment poses several hurdles to T cells, like
  hypoxia, glucose restriction, and acidosis. Tregs resist to these obstacles through
  several mechanisms, which involve both glycolysis (blue) and/or mitochondrial metabolism
  (red). First, intratumoral Tregs capture glucose at high rates (, ), thanks to GLUT1
  upregulation, and display a glycolytic program and activity ex vivo (): thus, Tregs
  may suppress the glycolytic metabolism in effector T cells (light blue) in the tumor
  microenvironment also through glucose sequestration (). The usage of GCK instead
  of hexokinase in glycolysis may endow Tregs to resist in a low-glucose environment
  (). Hypoxia triggers HIF1α activation in Tregs, which promotes glycolysis and thus
  indirectly fosters the oxidation of fatty acids captured through CD36 and other
  translocators (). Tregs are more resistant to lactate overload, based on their ability
  to convert lactate into pyruvate thanks to the modulation of LDH by Foxp3 (). Mitochondrial
  metabolism plays a key role in tumor-Treg expansion and function: indeed, mitochondrial
  complex III (RISP) dictates the ability of Tregs to suppress anti-tumor immunity
  (). We have found that intratumoral effector Tregs, expressing TNFR superfamily
  members, performed fatty acid synthesis through ACC and this pathway was involved
  in their expansion and function (). Whether TNFRSF signals can impact on glycolytic
  and/or mitochondrial metabolism in Tregs remains to be elucidated.'
