caption: Fast‐evolving and positively selected genes, as well as genes from expended
  gene families in plant‐pathogen interaction pathway. Plants have evolved an immunity
  system with multiple‐layers of protection against invading pathogens including pathogen‐associated
  molecular pattern triggered immunity (PTI) and effector‐triggered immunity (ETI)
  (Boller and He, ; Zipfel, ). The CNGC and FLS2 play an important role in the PTI,
  while the Pti1 and Pti6 are critical immune genes in ETI (Chinchilla et al., ; Gu
  et al., ; Jia et al., ; Ma et al., ; Zhou et al., , ). CNGC and FLS2 are involved
  in signal perception (Chinchilla et al., ; Ma et al., ), while Pti‐1 and Pti‐6 and
  CPK act in downstream signalling and transcriptional cascades (Gu et al., ; Jia
  et al., ; Zhou et al., , ). The calcium‐dependent protein kinase (CPK) is involved
  in abscisic acid‐activated signalling pathway, intracellular signal transduction
  and plant immunity (Harmon et al., ; Kadota et al., ). RPM1 specifically recognizes
  the AvrRpm1 type III effector avirulence protein and triggers defense responses
  including the hypersensitive response (Grant et al., ). Red solid circles represent
  positively selected genes, blue solid circle represent fast‐evolving genes, and
  cyan‐blue solid circles represent the genes from expended gene families.
