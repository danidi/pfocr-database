caption: A. Schematic of structure of the HEF1/NEDD9/CasL protein. Human HEF1 is 834
  amino acids; key functional domains include an amino-terminal SH3 domains, which
  binds FAK; a “substrate domain” (SD) containing multiple embedded SH2 binding sites,
  analogous to the mechanosensing domain of p130Cas recently described by Sawada et
  al.; a likely four-helix bundle, based on molecular modeling of primary sequence
  of HEF1 against the crystal coordinates for the conserved region of p130Cas (results
  not shown); and an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal domain, which binds Src family
  kinases and other proteins (indicated with a “?” as details of structure remain
  unknown). B. HEF1 (indicated in bright yellow, with “H”) is a component of the integrin
  dependent Src-FAK-Crk migration signaling cascade; influences cellular homing through
  CHAT/CXCR4; engages in crosstalk with the Ras pathway; is an intermediate in TGF-β-dependent
  signaling; activates the centrosomal Aurora-A/Ajuba/TPX2 machinery governing mitotic
  entry and cytokinesis; and activates Aurora-A/HDAC6 at the basal body to initiate
  ciliary disassembly. C. Curated online resources (based on experimentally well-validated
  protein interaction data) indicate numerous direct HEF1 interactions with cancer-related
  signaling pathways. Blue lines indicate protein interactions; many HEF1 partners
  also take part in extensive self-interactions within functional clusters that are
  likely augmented by increased HEF1 levels. Clusters shown in rose are particularly
  relevant to FAK/Src/integrin; in green, to CHAT/Rap1; in blue, to Aurora A; in gold,
  to TGF-β/SMADs; in yellow, all others. All HEF1-only interactions present in online
  databases are shown as blue lines; for contrast, common interactions of BCAR1/p130Cas
  are also shown as dashed pink lines. Interactions between all other proteins (including
  functional as well as physical interactions) are shown in green. For clarity, only
  interactions relevant to the discussion in this review are shown. Data on protein-protein
  interactions were collected in Cytoscape (http://cytoscape.org/), combining data
  from a Bionet plugin (http://err.bio.nyu.edu/cytoscape/bionetbuilder/), and EMBL
  String (string.embl.de/), with each retrieving information from several databases,
  including DIP (http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/), BIND (http://www.bind.ca/), KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/),
  Prolinks (http://mysql5.mbi.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/functionator/pronav), HPRD (http://www.hprd.org/),
