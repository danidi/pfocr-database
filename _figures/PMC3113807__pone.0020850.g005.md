caption: Upon binding of the insulin-like ligand to the DAF-2 receptor, the AGE-1
  kinase is activated and phosphorylates membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2 ), leading to the formation of phosphatidylinositiol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)
  and recruitment of kinases PDK-1 and AKT-1/AKT-2/SGK-1 complex to the membrane.
  PDK-1 subsequently phosphorylates and activates the AKT/SGK complex, leading to
  further phosphorylation and inactivation of the FoxO transcription factor DAF-16.
  In the absence of phosphorylation, DAF-16 enters the nucleus to induce transcription
  of genes implicated in stress resistance and longevity. Our results indicate that
  overexpression of the protein repair enzyme PCM-1 leads to down-regulation of the
  insulin-like signaling pathway and subsequent activation of DAF-16, leading to increased
  transcription of longevity genes. Our results also show that, although absence of
  PCM-1 activity leads to increased accumulation of protein damage, its overexpression
  might not decrease the level of isoaspartyl-containing proteins beyond wild-type
  levels. This suggests that PCM-1 might control lifespan in C. elegans through a
  regulatory signaling function rather than through its role in bulk protein repair.
