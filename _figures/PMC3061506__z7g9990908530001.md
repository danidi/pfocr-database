caption: Integration of the identified proteins into the canonical pathway of TLR
  signaling. Using the bioinformatics analysis tools (Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge
  Base), the TLR signaling pathway was defined among the canonical pathways significantly
  associated with our high-throughput human proteomic data (right-tailed Fisher's
  exact test; P < 0.05). Proteins shown in blue are those identified by the LC-MS/MS
  analysis of human retinal proteins, which exhibited an upregulation or were detectable
  only in glaucomatous samples (detailed information for abbreviated proteins is available
  at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein).
