caption: 'Resumption of Xenopus oocyte meiosis. G2-arrested oocytes contain pre-MPF,
  i.e. inactive Cdk1-Cyclin B complexes in which Cdk1 is inhibited by T14 and Y15
  phosphorylation. Progesterone initiates a signalling pathway that leads to T14-Y15
  dephosphorylation of Cdk1. MPF promotes the breakdown of the nuclear envelope (GVBD
  for germinal vesicle breakdown, identified by a white spot at the pole of the brown
  hemisphere) and formation of the metaphase I spindle. After extrusion of the first
  polar body, the metaphase II spindle is organized and the oocyte arrests at this
  stage, until fertilization. Top: two pictures of Xenopus oocytes, G2 arrest (left)
  and GVBD (right)'
