caption: Endothelial dysfunction and endothelial insulin resistance co-exist in the
  state of insulin resistance including metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes.
  Almost all factors that cause metabolic insulin resistance also induce endothelial
  dysfunction and vascular insulin resistance. The term “vascular insulin resistance”
  can be misleading in that within endothelial cells resistance to insulin action
  is pathway selective (–). While insulin responses through the PI3-kinase/Akt/eNOS
  pathway are attenuated, its action via the MAPK pathway remains intact or even enhanced
  in the insulin resistant state. As a result, the net effect of insulin acting on
  the vasculature is increased production of adhesion molecules and ET-1 and decreased
  production/bioavailability of NO, tilting the balance towards pro-atherogenic and
  vasoconstrictive responses (; –). Markedly increased insulin concentrations which
  can accompany metabolic insulin resistance may contribute to this process by activating
  the IGF-I and/or insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors. Combined, pathway selective insulin
  resistance and hyperinsulinema-driven MAPK signaling could handily explain why patients
  with diabetes have accelerated atherosclerosis and are prone to hypertension and
  tissue hypoxia (). However, evidence supporting this selective insulin resistance
  mainly stemmed from in vitro cell culture studies and ex vivo studies using isolated
  blood vessels. Convincing in vivo evidence remains scant.
