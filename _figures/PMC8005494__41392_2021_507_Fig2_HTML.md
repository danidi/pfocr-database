caption: Molecular mechanism of pyroptosis. In the canonical pathway, PAMPs and DAMPs
  receive intracellular signaling molecule stimulation and assemble with pro-caspase-1
  and ASC to form inflammasomes and active caspase-1. Cleaved-caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD
  and pro-IL-1β/18. N-GSDMD perforates the cell membrane by forming nonselective pores,
  further causing water influx, lysis, and death. In addition, IL-1β and IL-18 are
  secreted from the pores formed by N-GSDMD. In the noncanonical pathway, cytosolic
  LPS activates caspase-4/5 and caspase-11, triggering pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMD.
  However, oxPAPC competes with LPS to bind caspase-4/1, thus inhibiting pyroptosis.
  In addition, the cleavage of GSDMD results in efflux of K+, ultimately mediating
  the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18.
  The activated caspase-11 also cleaves Pannexin-1, inducing ATP release and P2X7R-related
  pyroptotic cell death. In the caspase-3-mediated pathway, active caspase-3 cleaves
  GSDME to form N-GSDME, inducing pyroptosis. In the caspase-8-mediated pathway, inhibiting
  TAK1 induces the activation of caspase-8, which cleaves GSDMD, resulting in pyroptosis.
  In addition, under hypoxia conditions, PD-L1 is transferred to the nucleus and regulates
  the transcription of GSDMC together with p-Stat3, resulting in the conversion of
  apoptosis to pyroptosis after TNFα-activated caspase-8. In the granzyme-mediated
  pathway, CAR T cells rapidly activate caspase-3 in target cells by releasing GzmB,
  and then GSDME- was activated, causing extensive pyroptosis. In adittion, GzmA and
  GzmB in cytotoxic lymphocytes enter target cells through perforin and induce pyroptosis.
  GzmA hydrolyzes GSDMB, and GzmB directly activates GSDME
