caption: Part of the proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of Ara4N-lipid A (, ).
  The pathway starts with UDP-Glc being oxidized by Ugd/PmrE to form UDP-glucuronic
  acid. UDP-GlcA is then oxidatively decarboxylated by the ArnA decarboxylase domain
  () to yield UDP-4-ketoarabinose (UDP-Ara4O). UDP-Ara4O is transaminated by ArnB,
  yielding the novel sugar nucleotide UDP-4-amino-4-deoxyarabinose (UDP-Ara4N). The
  N-terminal domain of ArnA can formylate UDP-Ara4N and has been proposed to help
  displace the reaction catalyzed by ArnB toward UDP-Ara4N synthesis and generate
  a transiently formylated product ().
