caption: Schematic representation of the interplay between cytosolic and chloroplastic
  processes in isoprenoid synthesis as influenced by bisphosphonate (alendronate and
  zoledronate) inhibitors and fosmidomycin. Isoprenoid precursors in chloroplasts
  are derived from recent photosynthates and partly from cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP). Chloroplastic isoprenoid synthesis also requires energetic and reductive
  equivalents that in light are provided by photosynthetic electron transport chain.
  Bisphosphonate inhibition blocks synthesis of isoprenoids with larger molecular
  mass (≥C10), whereas fosmidomycin blocks formation of  from . Bisphosphonate inhibition
  leads to a certain activation of transport of cytosolic isoprenoid pathway precursors
  into chloroplasts at the level of . A number of secondary effects are induced by
