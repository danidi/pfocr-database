caption: A, Outline of the aerobic (Glycolysis and Krebs cycle) and anaerobic (lactic
  acid fermentation) respiratory pathways depicting the down‐regulation of enzymes
  involved (shown in red downward arrow) in severe and moderate apnea when compared
  to control. The down‐regulated enzymes with an asterisk represents the findings
  from the 1‐D proteomic results, enzymes with two asterisks represent the findings
  from the current 2‐D proteomic results and the enzymes with a plus sign are found
  to be down‐regulated in both 1‐D and 2‐D proteomic analysis. B, Depiction of the
  β‐oxidation pathway and electron transport chain showing all the enzymes down‐regulated
  (shown in red downward arrow) in severe and moderate apnea condition when compared
  to control. The down‐regulated enzymes with an asterisk represents the findings
  from the 1‐D proteomic results, enzymes with two asterisks represent the findings
  from the current 2‐D proteomic results and the enzymes with a plus sign are found
  to be down‐regulated in both 1‐D and 2‐D proteomic analysis
