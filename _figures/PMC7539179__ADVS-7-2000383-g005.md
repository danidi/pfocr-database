caption: Mechanisms underlying the bone damage mediated by iron deficiency and iron
  overload. Both iron deficiency and iron overload can cause detrimental effects on
  bone metabolism upon heavy metal exposure. The HRI‐eIF2αP‐ATF4 signaling pathway
  might be involved in bone damage under iron deficiency via regulation of stress
  erythropoiesis. Dysregulated hepcidin, BMP, and IGF signaling pathways could be
  involved in bone damage observed under iron overload. The induction of oxidative
  stress, dysregulated microRNA and histone deacetylation by iron overload could contribute
  to dysregulated osteogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. RBC, red blood cell; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; DMT‐1, divalent metal transporter 1; IGF‐1, insulin‐like growth
  factor 1; BMPs, bone morphogenetic proteins.
