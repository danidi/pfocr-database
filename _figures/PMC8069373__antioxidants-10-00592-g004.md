caption: Potential signalling mechanisms linked to the MIA pathway. (A) Links between
  Mia40/CHCHD4 and iron–sulfur clusters (ISCs). Mia40/CHCHD4 has been previously reported
  to bind a rhombic 2Fe-2S cluster in a dimer form and to play a role in the export
  of ISCs. However, the role of IMS and in particular redox-regulated Mia40 in ISCs
  biogenesis remains to be fully detailed. (B) Links between Mia40/CHCHD4 and calcium
  signalling. Mia40 has been reported to be responsible for introducing an intermolecular
  disulphide bond, which links MICU1 to MICU2. This mixed disulphide between Mia40
  and MICU1 was found only when mitochondrial membrane potential was intact. Overall,
  this interaction with Mia40 links the regulation of calcium uptake by mitochondria
  to the redox-regulated folding machinery in the IMS.
