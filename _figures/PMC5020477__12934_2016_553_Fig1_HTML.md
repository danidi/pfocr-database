caption: Metabolic pathway design for the production of 5-aminovalerate and glutarate
  in Corynebacterium glutamicum starting from the pathway precursor l-lysine. Heterologous
  genes (davBA) from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 were used to reconstruct the 5-aminovalerate
  pathway comprising lysine monooxygenase (DavB) and 5-aminovaleramidase (DavA). Genes
  under control of the constitutive tuf-promotor were integrated in the bioD locus
  of the genome of C. glutamicum LYS-12. Glutarate production from 5-aminovalerate
  via the activity of 5-aminovalerate transaminase (GabT) and glutarate semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase (GabD) relied on endogenous reaction with no or promiscuous gene annotation.
  Potential candidates were identified by BLASTX search using sequence information
  of the P. putida genes gabT (davT, PP_0213)a and gabD (davD, PP_0214)b
