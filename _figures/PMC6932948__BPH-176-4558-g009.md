caption: Scheme of the signalling pathway involved in the effect of catalpol on adriamycin‐induced
  nephrocyte injury in vitro. Catalpol acts on inflammation, apoptosis and podocyte
  structure. Furthermore, catalpol down‐regulates the level of TRPC6 channels to decrease
  the level of Ca2+ in cells and up‐regulates MRP2 expression to reduce the intracellular
  accumulation of adriamycin by inducing the expression of SIRT1. CAT, catalpol; MRP2,
  multidrug resistance‐associated protein 2; SIRT1, sirtuin 1; TRPC6, transient receptor
  potential canonical channel 6
