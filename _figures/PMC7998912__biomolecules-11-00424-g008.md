caption: Model of cross-talk between mitochondrial ETC proteins and centrosomal kinases/proteins
  for centrosome function and bipolar spindles assembly. After nocodazole treatment,
  at M phase four inhibitors (two ETC inhibitors, ROT and AA; two Drp1 inhibitors;
  Mdivi-1 and Dynasore) were added to induce mitochondrial dynamic imbalance. AKAP1
  is believed to be a scaffold protein that recruits PKA to modulate mitochondrial
  function at Drp1-Ser637 (also see ). In summary, upon normal conditions, during
  mitosis mitochondria are fragmented to facilitate segregation of this organelle
  to daughter cells. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation
  and activation of Drp1-Ser616 []. Proper partitioning of mitochondria is required
  for inheritance during cell division, and then proceeds to the next cell cycle.
  However, upon inhibitor insulting conditions, mito-Drp1-Ser637 drives mitophagy
  via activated PKA during mitotic arrest. Dynamic Drp1-Ser637/Ser616 ratio affects
  the PINK1/Parkin pathway and promotes more efficient mitophagy while inducing multipolar
  spindles formation simultaneously. It appears that mito-Drp1-Ser637 induces mitochondrial
  fission to drive mitophagy and induces multipolar spindles formation to cause cell
  aneuploidy or cell death.
