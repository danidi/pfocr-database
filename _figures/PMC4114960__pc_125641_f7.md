caption: 'Rewiring of Host Metabolism during Lytic Viral Infection.Viral replication
  in E. huxleyi depends on the host metabolic machinery to provide building blocks
  for viral progeny formation (e.g., sphingolipids, fatty acids, and sterols in the
  lipid membrane). During the early stage of viral infection, upregulated glycolysis
  shuffles energy to fatty acid biosynthesis, bypassing the . Concomitantly, overexpression
  of viral encoded sphingolipid genes induces de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. During
  the onset of lytic infection demands for nucleotide biosynthesis are met via upregulation
  of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). These processes result in assembly of progeny
  viruses and finally lead to host cell death. (Inset: graph of virion based on ).
  Downregulation of fatty acid, terpenoid, and sterol biosynthesis in addition to
  induction of host-derived sphingolipid catabolic reactions in the late phase of
  viral infection may facilitate host resistance responses.'
