caption: Cell migration induced by EGF via regulated alternative splicing of the Rho
  GTPase Rac1. (A) Alternative splicing of Rac1 is positively regulated by SR proteins
  and negatively regulated by hnRNP A1. The inclusion or skipping of the alternative
  exon 3b generates Rac1 or Rac1b, the latter of which is arrested in the GTP-bound
  form. (B) EGF signaling to modulate the activities of key splicing regulators. Via
  the Akt pathway, EGF activates SR protein kinases (SRPK1/2), which in turn phosphorylate
  and activate SR proteins to induce Rac1b splicing. The present study by Hui and
  colleagues demonstrates that EGF also induces the E3 ligase adaptor SPSB1, which
  facilitates hnRNP A1 polyubiquitylation by the Elogin B/C-Collin E3 ligase. This
  modification attenuates RNA binding of hnRNP A1, thereby de-repressing Rac1b splicing.
  Based on the literature information, it is possible that Rac1b further activates
  the stress kinase p38, which phosphorylates hnRNP A1, resulting in the accumulation
  of a fraction of hnRNP A1 in the cytoplasm. This cellular restriction may also contribute
  to de-repressed Rac1b splicing.
