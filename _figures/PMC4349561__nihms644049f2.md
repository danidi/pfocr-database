number: Figure 2
caption: Pathway analyses of direct interactions among transcripts mediated by P4
  in the ovary. Also included in the figure are both the membrane-bound and the nuclear
  progesterone receptors to better elucidate the effects of P4 on gene expression.
  Red is indicative of an increase in mRNA abundance and blue is indicative of a decrease
  in mRNA abundance. CACNA1C, calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1C
  subunit; CD59, CD59 molecule, complement regulatory protein; CDKN2A, cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor 2A (melanoma, p16, inhibits CDK4); FOXA1, forkhead box A1; IQGAP1,
  IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1; MYH9, myosin, heavy chain 9, non-muscle;
  PAK1, p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 1; PGR, progesterone receptor; PGRMC1,
  progesterone receptor membrane component 1; PKM2, pyruvate kinase, muscle; SNX9,
  sorting nexin 9; UNC45A, unc-45 homolog A (C. elegans); SPEN, spen homolog, transcriptional
  regulator (Drosophila); TRAF4, TNF receptor-associated factor 4; SRC, v-src sarcoma
  (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (avian).
