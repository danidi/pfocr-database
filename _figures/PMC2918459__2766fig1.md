caption: Biosynthetic pathway of ω3 and ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Fatty
  acids are obtained from the diet or by de novo FA synthesis (upper left), which
  builds saturated fatty acids (SFA) by 2-carbon unit increments to the 18-carbon
  stearic acid (C18:0; i.e., 18 carbons with no double bonds) and takes place in all
  organisms. Stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1(SCD1) initiates fatty acid desaturation
  and generates the precursors of the ω-7 and ω-9 series fatty acids (upper left).
  The lack of Δ-12 and Δ-15 desaturase (dashed box) in animals renders linoleic acid
  (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) essential fatty acids (**) and thus must be obtained
  from the diet, generally from plant-derived sources. The synthesis of ω-9 (derived
  from oleic acid, 18:1ω9; series not shown), ω-6 (from LA, 18:2ω6) and ω-3 (from
  ALA, 18:3ω) PUFAs proceeds in parallel, with the activity of Δ-6 desaturase (FADS2)
  thought to be the rate-limiting step in PUFA synthesis. In animals and organisms
  at the base of the food chain, LC-PUFAs are synthesized by alternating actions of
  elongases (red arrows) and desaturases (blue arrows). In mammals, a variety of enzymes
  (green arrows) generate numerous bioactive derivatives from ω-6 (DHGLA and AA) and
  ω-3 (EPA, DHA) PUFAs that have numerous targets and functions throughout the body.
  With the exception of the series-1 prostaglandins (PG), thromboxanes (TX), and leukotrienes
  (LT) derived from DHGLA, the ω6-derived lipid mediators (series-2 and -4) tend to
  have proinflammatory actions. Like the series-1 lipid mediators, the series-3 and
  -5 metabolites of ω3 PUFAs generally exhibit less inflammatory to anti-inflammatory
  properties. AA, arachidonic acid; DHGLA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid; EPA, eicosapentanoic
  acid; FADS, fatty acid desaturase.
