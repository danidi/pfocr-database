caption: In M. oryzae, cAMP signaling is the secondary messenger for surface sensing
  to initiate appressorium formation. Although their exact relationship is not clear,
  surface sensing signals must be transduced from the cAMP signaling to the Pmk1 MAP
  kinase pathway, which regulates appressorium development and plant penetration.
  Ras2 functions upstream both Pmk1 and cAMP signaling. Cap1 directly interacts with
  Mac1 and plays a role in the activation of Mac1, which may function downstream of
  Ras or MagB. In cells lacking Cap1, Mac1 cannot be fully activated, which leads
  to the reduced intracellular cAMP level and reduced appressorium formation. Exogenous
  cAMP partially suppresses the phenotype of Δcap1 mutant. Reduced intracellular cAMP
  may somehow affect the proper activation of Pmk1, which can explain the formation
  of subapical swollen bodies in the Δcap1 mutant. Cap1 may also interact with actin
  and is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization during appressorium morphogenesis.
  In addition, it is likely that Cap1 is involved in the feedback inhibition of Mac1
  and Ras2 signaling by the activated Pmk1. Deletion of CAP1 may affect this process
  and result in the formation of branched germ tubes. The AB domain may play a critical
  role in the feedback inhibition by directly interact with Pmk1 or by being phosphorylated
  by Pmk1. Meanwhile, the Cap1ΔAB protein may be hyperactive in activating Mac1 via
  Ras2. Therefore, exogenous cAMP may overstimulate Ras signaling in the CAP1 ΔAB-GFP
  transformant and result in the inappropriate activation of the Pmk1 pathway, which
  may be responsible for the formation of melanized conidium compartments and appressoria
  in the absence of visible germ tubes.
