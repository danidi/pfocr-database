caption: NOTCH signaling in B cell development. In bone marrow-residing CLPs, NOTCH1
  signaling must be switched off to allow proper B cell development. On the contrary,
  after migration of immature B cells to the spleen, interaction of DLL1 with NOTCH2,
  with the involvement of recombinant signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kJ
  region (RBPJk), induces NOTCH signaling in transitional B (T2) cells to specify
  marginal zone B cells, as opposed to follicular B cells. NOTCH2 signaling is also
  necessary for CLPs to differentiate toward B1 cells.
