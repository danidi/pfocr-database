caption: Model of the allosteric effects of losartan-bound AT1R on its protomer D1R.
  As previously shown, AT1R and D1R form a dimer that is disrupted by agonist binding
  to either AT1R or D1R. In contrast, antagonist binding to AT1R strengthens the interaction
  between the protomers. Binding of the antagonist losartan to the AT1R should result
  in an allosteric modification of the receptor. Results from this study indicate
  that this allosteric modification is transferred to D1R and that it will trigger
  a coupling of D1R to its signaling pathway.
