caption: A proposed mechanism highlighting the role of AM in the development of morphine
  tolerance and morphine-associated hyperalgesia. Morphine binds to opiate μ-opioid
  receptors (μOR) in DRG neurons and activates the PKC, but not PKA, signaling transduction
  pathway, leading to the upregulation of the synthesis of AM. In turn, AM binds to
  AM receptors (AMR) expressed in DRG neurons to stimulate the production of AM and
  CGRP through autocrine and/or paracrine mechanism(s). Accordingly, a chronic morphine
  treatment can induce the synthesis of both AM and CGRP, leading to the development
  of hyperalgesia and tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia.
