caption: TLR signaling pathways in cerebral IT. (A) Preconditioning through TLRs may
  be afford by exposure with low dose of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs)
  molecules (Mallard, ). TLRs are localized either at the outer cell surface (TLR1,
  TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6) or within endosomes (TLR7 and TLR9) (Marsh et al., ). TLR2
  dimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 and is activated upon binding of PAMPs such as the synthetic
  lipopeptide Pam3CysSerLys4 (Pam3CSK4), the non-peptide ligand lipoteichoic acid
  (LTA) or peptidoglycans (PGN). TLR4 predominantly recognizes lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria. TLR7 and TRL9 can be activated by the synthetic
  imidazoquinoline Gardiquimod (GDQ) or small DNA such as non-methylated cytosine-guanosine
  (CpG), respectively (Wang et al., ). Preconditioning of TLRs will favor the activation
  of the myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway. Upon binding
  of ligands, MyD88 is activated either directly (TLR7/9) or via the toll-interleukin
  1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor protein TIRAP (TLR2/4). The latter further
  mobilizes members of the IL-1R-associated kinase family (IRAK) leading to the subsequent
  binding/activation of TNF receptor associated factor-6 (TRAF6), the inhibitor of
  κB kinase (IKK) complex (composed of IKKα and IKKβ) and IκB. Once IκB is phosphorylated
  and degraded by the proteasome, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) translocates to the nucleus
  leading to low level of pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, such as TNF-α. TLR
  PC also induces the production of several negative inhibitors of TLR signaling,
  targeting mainly MyD88 and NF-κB pathways. Induction of proinflammatory cytokines
  and activation of such inhibitors are required to induce a state of ischemic tolerance
  (Marsh et al., ; Vartanian and Stenzel-Poore, ; Wang et al., ). In addition to activating
  the MyD88-dependent pathway, TLR4 signals through the MyD88-independent pathway
  to activate IRF3 by sequential recruiting of the adaptor molecule TIR inducing interferon
  β (TRIF) and IKKε resulting in expression of anti-inflammatory type I interferon
  (IFN) genes, including IFNβ (Marsh et al., ). Type I IFNγ genes are also induced
  by TLR7/9 activation through the TRAF6/IKKα pathway (Hoshino et al., ). (B) Damage-associated
  molecular pattern (DAMPs) molecules are endogenous ligands of TLRs produced in response
  to ischemic injury (Vabulas et al., ). Following preconditioning, activation of
  TLR4/7/9 by DAMPs will fail to activate MyD88 and the subsequent signaling molecules,
  such as IRAK and NF-κB. Indeed, several inhibitors produced during the first exposition
  of TLRs to exogenous stimuli will block the signaling of TLRs to NF-κB. Whether
  pro-inflammatory cytokines are suppressed or up-regulated is controversial and might
  be model specific (Marsh et al., ; Vartanian and Stenzel-Poore, ). On one hand,
  TLR preconditioning induces a down-regulation of NF-κB. On the other hand, it has
  been shown that neuroprotection following cerebral ischemia is achieved by an up-regulation
  of the TLR-IRF axis generating an increase of TGF-β, IL-10, IFNα, and IFNβ anti-inflammatory
  cytokines (Stevens et al., ; Leung et al., ). Thus, TLR preconditioning induces
  a reorganization of the TLR signaling pathways after cerebral ischemia toward TRIF/IRF
  signaling that may confer protection of the brain against ischemic damage.
