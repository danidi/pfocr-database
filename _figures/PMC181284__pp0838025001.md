caption: A, Metabolic pathway for the synthesis of MAs, based on existing data. A  dioxymugineic
  acid synthase gene was recently cloned from barley (Hordeum  vulgare). B, Nicotianamine
  synthase (NAS) catalyzes  S-adenosyl-Met (SAM) trimerization and ring formation
  to synthesize  NA. Bold lines indicate the unit incorporated into NA.
