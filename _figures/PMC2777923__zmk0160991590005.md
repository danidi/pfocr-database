caption: A new model for the regulation of the ASK1-dependent signaling pathway by
  H2O2. In untreated cells, ASK1 oligomers are associated with other interactors (triangle)
  in a complex of 1500 to 3000 kDa called the ASK1 signalosome. In this complex, Cys32
  of Trx1 binds to and masks Cys250 of ASK1 likely via a slower thiol reductase activity
  (see text for details). Stimulation of cells with H2O2 induces the formation of
  the active ASK1 signalosme (<3000 kDa) in which ASK1 is phosphorylated (P). This
  occurs simultaneously with the lost of thiol reductase activity of Trx1 and its
  dissociation from Cys250. This cysteine is essential for JNK activation after H2O2
  treatment. The exact role of Cys250 in this mechanism is unknown. One possible scenario,
  illustrated in this figure, shows the Cys250-dependent association of a H2O2-specific
  interactor (Factor X) with ASK1. In addition, H2O2 induces an association between
  Cys32 of Trx1 on Cys22,30 of ASK1, also via a slower thiol reductase activity, like
  on Cys250 of ASK1. Moreover, disulfide-bonded (thick curved line) multimers of ASK1
  are formed and are reduced by Trx1.
