caption: 'HSPs and the DNA damage response (DDR). Complex processes and signaling
  pathways take place in the cell in response to DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) and
  double strand breaks (DSBs). SSBs are detected by RPA and DSBs by the MRN complex
  (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1). RPA and MRN mediate the recruitment of ATM and ATR, respectively.
  ATR is bound by the ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), which interacts with RPA. Both
  ATM and ATR can phosphorylate (P) the histone variant H2AX on Ser139 (γH2AX) in
  the damaged DNA region. p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) participates in the nuclear
  foci organization, promotes ATM activation, and facilitates the phosphorylation
  of specific substrates by ATM. The DNA damage signaling cascade continues with the
  phosphorylation of the cell cycle checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2, which activate
  the downstream effectors: the tumor suppressor protein p53 or the CDC25 protein
  phosphatase. As a result, cell cycle progression is interrupted to allow DNA repair,
  senescence, or, in cases where DNA damage is too severe, apoptosis. The solid arrows
  show the DDR activation pathway. The dotted lines indicate the relationship between
  DDR and HSPs'
