caption: Canonical pathways identified from protein co-expression network. Canonical
  pathways identified from protein-protein co-expression analysis. Many pathways that
  were earlier not known in cachexia such as Th1 and Th2 activation pathways, natural
  killer cell pathways were identified. Some of the well-studied pathways such as
  IL-6 signaling and protein ubiquitination pathway were also identified.
