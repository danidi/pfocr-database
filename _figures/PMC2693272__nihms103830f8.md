caption: Proposed pathway for the interaction between ERα and growth factor (GF) signaling
  pathways and regulation by estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). The ERα is activated
  by classical E2 binding and/or by phosphorylation at serine 118 by activated MAPK.
  Activated ERα then activates gene transcription and translation of a GF. The GF
  will bind to its receptor (GFR), and the activated GFR will in turn activate the
  MAPK pathway, which can result in proliferation and also possible phosphorylation
  of ERα at serine 118. E2 can up-regulate GFs and GFRs with an increase in downstream
  MAPK activation and possible ERα-phospho-Ser118 phosphorylation, whereas P4 can
  decrease or increase ERα, GF, and GFR production, which in turn results in up- or
  down-regulation of activated MAPK and ERα-phospho-Ser118 expression
