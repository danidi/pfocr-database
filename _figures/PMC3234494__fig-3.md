caption: Cytosolic RNA sensors. RNA in the cytoplasm is primarily sensed by the helicases
  RIG-I (RNA with uncapped 5′-triphosphates or short dsRNA) and MDA5 (long dsRNA).
  Ligand binding induces ATP-dependent conformational changes that allow CARD/CARD
  homotypic interactions between these helicases and the signaling adaptor IPS-1 localized
  on either peroxisomes or mitochondria. Engagement of peroxisomal IPS-1 promotes
  a transient IFN-independent response, whereas at the mitochondrial membrane, the
  engaged IPS-1 relays a signaling cascade that leads to transcription factor activation
  and expression of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. RIG-I signaling also
  requires the participation of the ER-associated STING and is enhanced by the interaction
  with ZAPS as well as by TRIM25-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination (U) of CARDs,
  although unanchored ubiquitin chains also promote RIG-I activation. Another helicase,
  LGP2, lacks CARDs and appears to facilitate RNA binding to RIG-I and MDA5. In addition,
  NOD2, a CARD-containing member of the NLR family mostly dedicated to the detection
  of the peptidoglycan component muramyl dipeptide (MDP) found in both Gram-positive
  and Gram-negative bacteria, can also recognize ssRNA in the cytosol and promote
  type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine production through an IPS-1-mediated pathway.
