caption: Inhibition of the ceramide synthesis pathway by FB1. In normal physiology,
  the amino group of Sphinganine (Sa) and Sphingosine (So) can form an amide bond
  with fatty acid carboxyl to produce a ceramide. Mycotoxin FB1 can bind to the catalytic
  site of ceramide synthase, resulting in an inhibition of the reduction of Sa with
  fatty acyl CoA forming dihydroceramide. Furthermore, re-acylation of So, derived
  from breaking down sphingolipids to form ceramide, is also inhibited by FB1 (red
  line) [,,,,,,].
