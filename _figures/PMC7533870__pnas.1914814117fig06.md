caption: Proposed model depicting the mechanism behind Wolbachia-mediated blocking.
  Flavivirus infection results in FA-CoAs (activated fatty acids) being converted
  to acyl-carnitines for transport into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. Mitochondrial
  β-oxidation results in production of ATP (energy that might be redirected to produce
  novel virions) and acetyl (C2)-CoA (that can be recycled to synthesize longer chain
  FA-CoA at site of viral replication). Such elevated energetic demands might lead
  to the accumulation of acyl-carnitines due to mitochondrial overload. Increased
  levels of acyl-carnitines are important and necessary for efficient virus replication.
  When Wolbachia is present, acyl-carnitine levels are modulated, driving the metabolic
  force in the opposite direction. This is likely due to Wolbachia redirecting the
  energy source for either the production of bacteria-specific lipids or Wolbachia-driven
  energy production. This immense reduction in acyl-carnitines caused by wMel renders
  virus replication highly inefficient in the presence of Wolbachia as downstream
  β-oxidation is dramatically reduced. Black arrows depict the scenario during virus
  infection, and red arrows depict the pathway altered in the presence of Wolbachia.
