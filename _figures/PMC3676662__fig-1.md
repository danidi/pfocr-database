caption: The components of the trimolecular complex and therapeutic approaches for
  targeting. The trimolecular complex consisting of a T cell receptor (TCR)–peptide–human
  leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule. In order to block interactions, (1) a small molecule
  can occupy a pocket in a specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) peptide
  binding groove, blocking peptide presentation to T cells, (2) a small molecule,
  such as glyphosine, can bind the MHC molecule and with an appropriate peptide induce
  a protective interleukin (IL)-10 response, (3) a monoclonal antibody can bind a
  specific peptide/MHC complex, thereby blocking T cell activation, or (4) a monoclonal
  antibody targets a specific TCR.
