caption: Metabolites highlighted in yellow were significantly reduced in B50 cells
  following 1 and/or 10 Hz LI-rMS, compared to control B50 cells. The level of glucose
  (highlighted in green) was measured in our experiments and found to be unchanged
  by LI-rMS. The observed changes are proposed to result from increased de novo GABA
  synthesis (pathway a) that results in depletion of TCA cycle intermediates and precursors
  (pathways b, c, d). Suspected point of interference by LI-rMS is noted with ‘ X’.
