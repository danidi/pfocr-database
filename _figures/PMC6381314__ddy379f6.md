caption: Proposed in vivo model of Pc1-c-Myc regulatory loop mechanism. Pc1 dosage
  dysregulation leads to c-Myc upregulation likely via several signaling pathways
  including Wnt canonical cascade. In the latter pathway, activation of β-catenin
  expression can directly promote c-Myc expression (RNA and protein). In addition,
  β-catenin was also shown in vitro to stimulate Pkd1 promoter. This upregulation
  of c-Myc in turn can lead to a feed-forward regulation on Pkd1 gene. In ADPKD patients,
  the germline and/or somatic allele of PKD1 gene could respond and attempt to induce
  a compensatory mechanism. In the adult cystic stages however, the uncontrolled c-Myc
  functions and consequently downstream targets may exacerbate PKD severity.
