caption: 'Some common metabolic features of adult stem cells are essential for the
  maintenance of their quiescence, number, proliferation potential, and differentiation
  ability. Among these metabolic features are carbohydrate metabolism mainly through
  aerobic glycolysis in the cytosol, suppressed carbohydrate oxidation in mitochondria,
  mitochondrial network fragmentation into globular and immature mitochondria with
  underdeveloped cristae, and stimulated ROS detoxification in several cellular locations.
  Enzymes, metabolites and processes whose activities, concentrations and rates are
  increased or decreased in quiescent adult stem cells (as compared to their fully
  differentiated progeny) are displayed in red or green color, respectively. The red
  one-way arrows and the red two-way arrows define irreversible and reversible (respectively)
  chemical reactions whose rates are increased in quiescent adult stem cells. The
  red inhibitory bars define inhibitory effects whose intensities are increased in
  quiescent adult stem cells. The green arrows define chemical reactions or processes
  whose rates or intensities are decreased in quiescent adult stem cells. The black
  arrow defines the irreversible chemical reaction whose rate is not changed in quiescent
  adult stem cells. See text for more details. Abbreviations: ATP syn, ATP synthase;
  CAT, catalase; DRP1, dynamin-related protein 1; ENO, enolase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLR, glutathione reductase; GPX1, glutathione peroxidase
  type 1; HIF-1α and HIF-2α, transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and
  2α, respectively; HK, hexokinase; IF1, inhibitory factor 1; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
