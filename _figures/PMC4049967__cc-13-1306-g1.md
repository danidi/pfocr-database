caption: 'Figure 1. IL-15 signaling in CTCL (A) Left: In normal T cells, IL-15R activates
  the Jak3/STAT3 pathway, which can result in specific cytokine secretion. The specific
  cytokine(s) expressed depends on the activation and differentiation status of the
  T-cell type in question. Right: In malignant T cells from Sézary syndrome patients,
  IL-15 activates the Jak3/STAT3 signaling pathway, which, in turn, initiates transcription
  of the gene encoding IL-17A. (B) In MF it is unknown whether (1) the constitutive
  activation of the Jak3/STAT3 is induced by IL-15; and (2) STAT3 drives the constitutive
  transcription of IL-15. In other words, whether IL-15 is part of an autocrine stimulation
  loop involving the Jak3/STAT3 pathway and downstream target genes IL-17F and IL-15.'
