caption: IL-6 induced classical and trans-signaling pathways. Shown is a schematic
  view of classical IL-6 signaling via the IL-6Rα receptor and gp130 for a representative
  hepatocyte. IL-6Rα bound to the IL-6 ligand results in complex formation with gp130,
  activating tyrosine kinase activity, including and culminating in tyrosine phosphorylation
  of STAT3. The IL-6 trans-signaling pathway is diagrammed at top, using a representative
  endothelial cell. Circulating IL-6∙IL-6Rα engages with gp130 expressed on cells,
  enabling activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway in cells lacking IL-6Rα. See text
  for further details.
