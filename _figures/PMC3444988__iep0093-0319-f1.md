caption: Sequence of events proposed to occur prior to heterotopic ossification within
  tendons. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-stimulated release of substance P (SP)
  leading to mast cell recruitment is likely to be a key event. Following surgical
  trauma, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells may be the source of BMPs required
  to initiate this pathway, whereas in overuse tendinopathy increased intratendinous
  PGE 2, which in turn promotes BMP production by tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs),
  may be the initiator. Mast cells recruited by stimulated sensory neurons may cause
  accumulation of more inflammatory cells in addition to releasing progenitor cells
  from neural tissue. Both of these events may predispose the development of ossification.
  BMPs may also be chemotactic for mononuclear cells, further amplifying the inflammatory
  response to surgical trauma.
