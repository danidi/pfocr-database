caption: Hypothetical scheme showing separate circuits in basal ganglia (BG) that
  control saccades in different contexts. (A) In visual 1DR, the immediate initiation
  of a saccade after cue onset is caused by the cue-induced inhibitory response of
  “immediate-type” SNr neurons, which leads to a disinhibition of SC saccadic neurons.
  This is mediated by the direct pathway (red arrow; CD-SNr-SC). (B) In memory 1DR,
  withholding an immediate saccade after cue onset is caused by the cue-induced excitatory
  response of “delayed-type” SNr neurons, which leads to an enhanced inhibition of
  SC saccadic neurons. This is mediated by the indirect pathway (blue arrow; CD-GPe/subthalamic
  nucleus (STN)-SNr). (C) To initiate a delayed saccade in memory 1DR, pre-saccadic
  inhibition of “delayed-type” SNr neurons causes a disinhibition of SC saccadic neurons.
  This is mediated by the direct pathway (orange arrow). “Immediate-type” and “delayed-type”
  SNr neurons receive the direct pathway inputs from different populations of CD neurons
  (see “Discussion” Section).
