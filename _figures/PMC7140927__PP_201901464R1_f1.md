caption: 'Sensing mechanisms for abiotic stress in plants. The five major abiotic
  stress conditions described in this article are sensed by separate sensing mechanisms.
  Key proteins in cold temperature sensing are COLD1 in rice (Oryza sativa) and the
  OST1 pathway in Arabidopsis. COLD1 interacts with RGA1 during cold temperatures,
  resulting in increased GTPase activity, which activates an unknown calcium influx
  channel. OST1 is activated upon NMT1-mediated myristoylation of its interactor EGR2
  in response to cold temperatures. OST1 is first autophosphorylated, after which
  it phosphorylates ICE1, leading to the induction of COR gene expression. High temperatures
  are sensed through recognition of denatured proteins by HSPs, which subsequently
  release HSE to induce heat-related gene expression. Alternatively, temperature is
  perceived by the known red/far-red light receptor phyB. High temperatures increase
  the speed of conversion of activated phyB (Pfr) into inactive phyB (Pr), resulting
  in increased PIF4 stabilization and hence repression of light-induced gene expression.
  Flooding sensing is mediated mainly by ethylene accumulation and decreased NO/oxygen
  levels. Reduced oxygen levels lead to reduced N-terminal Cys oxidation of ERFVII
  by PCO1/2. This prevents degradation of C-ERFVII, which can relocalize to the nucleus
  to mediate expression of genes containing hypoxia-responsive elements to mediate
  flooding tolerance. Drought is likely sensed by a number of transmembrane proteins.
  OSCA1 is hypothesized to be activated by increased membrane tension occurring during
  osmotic stress, resulting in the influx of Ca2+ to mediate downstream signaling
  responses. A homolog of OSCA1, called CSC1, is also described as an osmotic stress-regulated
  calcium channel. The TSC contains a membrane-localized signaling kinase (SK) domain
  attached to a His kinase (HK) domain in which the His residue is phosphorylated
  upon osmotic stress. The His kinase subsequently phosphorylates the Asp of a regulator
  domain, which initiates the signaling cascade in response to drought and/or osmotic
  stress. Osmotic stress leads to dissociation of the plasma membrane from the cell
  wall, which is sensed by RLKs localized in the plasma membrane that contain a sensory
  domain protruding into the cell wall. High salinity is sensed by binding of monovalent
  cations to the negatively charged GlcA of the GIPC sphingolipids. Upon Na+ binding,
  an unknown calcium influx channel is activated, which results in the activation
  of the SOS pathway to exclude excess Na+ from the cell. P, Phosphate; Myr, Myristoylation;
  C2H4, ethylene; PGB1, phytoglobin1; ERFVII, ethylene response factor7; Cox-ERFVII,
  ERF7 containing the oxidized Cys; MC: monovalent cations.'
