caption: The tryptophan-kynurenine-niacin pathway in the intestinal mucosa. Dietary
  tryptophan is metabolised to kynurenine by IDO—whose activity is increased in settings
  of inflammation. Adverse effects of elevated IDO activity relate to modulation of
  the immune response, decreased activity of mTOR in producing antimicrobial peptides
  and decreased tryptophan for protein synthesis. Intervention with nicotinamide ameliorates
  some of these effects in preclinical models; in the current study, we hypothesise
  that intervention with nicotinamide will increase linear growth via normalisation
  of the tryptophan-kynurenine-niacin pathway and restored enterocyte activity. Both
  nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are considered dietary forms of niacin. IDO, indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
