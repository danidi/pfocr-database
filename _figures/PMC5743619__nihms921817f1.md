caption: A schematic presentation of different pathways involved in PCa disparity.1.
  In the cytoplasm, testosterone is reduced to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the presence
  of 5α-reductase and binds to the androgen receptor (AR). The DHT/AR complex migrates
  to the nucleus and binds to androgen responsive elements (ARE) that further stimulates
  the activation of gene transcription. 2. After ligand interaction, receptor tyrosine
  kinase such as EGFR/PDGF/IGF stimulates its phosphorylation and subsequently actives
  PI3K and Akt pathway which further leads to the activation and migration of mTOR
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, activated mTOR induces initiation of gene transcription,
  which results in proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. 3. Binding of cytokines
  such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) to its receptor initiates several cellular events including
  activation of Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activating of transcription
  3 (STAT3). Activated STAT3 forms homodimers that move to the nucleus and stimulates
  gene transcription. In brief, activation of; 1. androgen receptor, 2. receptor tyrosine
  kinase, and 3. Cytokine, induced downstream activation of responsive genes which
  are critical for PCa cells existence.
