caption: 'Proteins: The first step in protein metabolism is to break it into its constituent
  amino acids. The second step is to break down amino acids into their constituent
  parts. One important amino acid is glutamine. Mitochondrial utilization of glutamine
  begins with a two-step conversion of glutamine to 2-oxogluterate, typically by glutaminase
  and glutamate dehydrogenase. 2-Oxogluterate can be either oxidized to succinate
  (standard TCA cycle) or reductively carboxylated (reverse TCA cycle) to isocitrate
  and then to citrate. Glutamine-derived malate can then be transported to the cytoplasm
  through the process of glutaminolysis to generate pyruvate and lactate. This reverse
  TCA cycle generates glutamine-derived citrate that can then be transported to the
  cytoplasm to generate acetyl CoA for anabolic processes such as fatty acid synthesis.
  Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are made out of simple sugars such as glucose. The
  first step of carbohydrate metabolism is glycolysis. It is the metabolic process
  that converts glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. The second step of carbohydrate
  metabolism occurs in the mitochondria. Here pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA and
  CO2 by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells
  and in the cytosol of prokaryotes. In a third step, when oxygen is present, the
  mitochondria will undergo aerobic respiration, which leads to the TCA cycle. Fat:
  Once the fatty acids have been transported to the mitochondrial matrix via the carnative
  pathway β-oxidation of fatty acyl-CoA occurs in a four step process. Assuming an
  even numbered carbon chain fully saturated fatty acid each cycle of β-oxidation
  produces one FADH2, one NADH and one acetyl-CoA (which produces one FADH2 and three
  NADH through the TCA cycle). This gives a total of two FADH2 and four NADHs inputs
  per cycle of β-oxidation or a FADH2/NADH ratio of approximately 0.5. But the very
  last pair of carbon atoms in a saturated fat already comprises acetate attached
  to CoA, so they can simply enter the TCA as acetyl-CoA (producing one FADH2 and
  three NADH).'
