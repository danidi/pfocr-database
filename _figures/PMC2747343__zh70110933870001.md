caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis shows 17 genes from the 180 genes associated
  with the NF-E2-related factor-2 (NRF-2)-mediated oxidative stress response pathway.
  A network of genes are associated with the transcription factors JUN and activating
  transcription factor 4 (ATF4). The network has been overlaid with the links between
  palmitic and oleic acid [the major nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) produced as
  a result of negative energy balance (NEB)] and superoxidase dismutase (SOD1) and
  ATF4. The network is displayed graphically as nodes (gene/gene products) and edges
  (the biological relationship between nodes). The node color intensity indicates
  the expression of genes: red upregulated, green downregulated in severe negative
  energy balance (SNEB) vs. mild negative energy balance (MNEB) spleen. The fold value
  is indicated under each node. The shapes of nodes indicate the functional class
  of the gene product and the lines indicate the type of interaction (Supplementary
  Fig. S2).'
