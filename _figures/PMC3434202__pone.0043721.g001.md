caption: Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) substitutes NXS/T sites of proteins in the
  rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), transferring the pre-assembled glycan from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pp-dolichol
  to the Asn. Glycoproteins traffic to the Golgi where the N-glycans are remodeled,
  and the structural details depend on enzyme expression and UDP-GlcNAc supply. The
  branching enzymes Mgat1, Mgat2, Mgat4, and Mgat5 differ in Km values for UDP-GlcNAc
  “D” and for glycoprotein acceptor “A”. The pathway has evolved for pathway ultrasensitivity
  to UDP-GlcNAc. The epitopes are completed in the trans-Golgi (small box) where efficient
  substitution with Gal generates the LacNAc epitope, and can be extended by poly-LacNAc.
  Further extension with galactose generates epitopes for galectin binding, with effects
  on receptor dynamics, interactions and trafficking.
