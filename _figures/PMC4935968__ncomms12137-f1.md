caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways from norlaudanosoline, 12, to noscapine, 1, proposed
  according to in situ virus-induced gene silencing experiments in P. somniferum (green),
  in vitro characterization (blue) and pathway reconstitution in yeast (yellow). Solid
  colour: proposed major biosynthetic pathway to noscapine; faded colour: putative
  side reaction due to enzyme promiscuity; solid arrow: characterized enzymatic step;
  dashed arrow: unverified enzymatic step.'
