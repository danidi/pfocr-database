caption: Upon stimulation by ligands, both TLR5 and TNFα receptor recruit adaptor
  molecules leading to activation of NFκB and mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) signaling
  pathways, which result in distinct expression patterns of immune/inflammatory genes.
  Also PI3K/AKT pathway is required to initiate host immune response and p38 acts
  upstream of PI3K. p53 can enhance TLR5 inflammatory response through increase in
  the receptor levels, by direct enhancement of transcription or via increased activation
  of the aforementioned signaling pathways. Induction of cell cycle arrest due to
  activation of p53 can increase ligand-dependent TLR5 activity. Increased cytokine
  secretion generates a secondary wave of expression of inflammatory genes through
  the STAT3 pathway. Solid arrows stand for known interactions and dashed arrows stand
  for proposed interactions.
