caption: (A) IL-2 signals are essential to lower the integrin-cAMP-NFAT signaling,
  and in facilitating optimal KLF1 and EpoR expression, which results in normal erythropoiesis
  in the BM. (B) Deficiency in IL-2 or of any component of IL-2 signaling pathway
  leads to upregulated integrin-cAMP-NFAT signaling as well as suppressed Klf1 and
  Epor expression. Both these defects combinedly result in enhanced cell death of
  immature erythrocytes leading to the development of severe anemia in IL-2 signaling-deficient
  mice. Grey dashed arrow represents lack of Epo signaling.
