caption: Overview of the GO-induced cytokine response and autophagy mediated by the
  TLR4/TLR9 signaling pathway. GO treatment led to the activation of TLR4 and TLR9,
  which relayed signals through MyD88-TRAF6-NF-kB and ultimately gave rise to cytokine
  expression. However, GO-induced TLRs signaling neither elicited IFN-b expression
  nor activated IRF3, suggesting that TRIF and IRF3 were dispensable in the inflammatory
  response. Conversely, GO-induced TLR4-MyD88-TRAF6 and TLR4-TRIF signaling cascades
  signaled through Beclin 1 to initiate autophagy. GO engagement of TLR9 also activated
  MyD88 and TRAF6, leading to Beclin 1 and LC3 activation and subsequent autophagy.
