caption: 'A model for multiple signaling pathways in podocyte injury: Is a multidrug,
  synergistic therapy the answer to proteinuria? A synthesis of work by many groups
  suggests that multiple signaling levels are involved in the Ang II–mediated regulation
  of podocyte function in health and disease. Level 1 consists of the binding of Ang
  II, whose availability is limited by ACE inhibitors, to AT1Rs, which are blocked
  by ARBs. Subsequent activation of TRPC5 and TRPC6 channels on level 2 results in
  Ca2+ influx into podocytes. TRPC5-driven signaling may predominate under pathologic
  conditions of excess Ang II and/or Rac1 activity. TRPC5-targeted agents may therefore
  be a novel therapeutic approach to proteinuria. On level 3, Ca2+-activated phosphatases
  (calcineurin) or kinases (PKA and CamKII) battle for downstream effects on their
  mutual targets, synaptopodin and NFAT (level 4). Synaptopodin-preserving agents
  such as CsA exert their antiproteinuric effect by blocking the calcineurin-initiated
  degradation of synaptopodin. Stabilization of synaptopodin protein abundance or
  inhibition of NFAT signaling may be another therapeutic approach to proteinuria.
  On level 5, Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 battle for downstream effects on the actin cytoskeleton.
  Inhibition of Rac1 has an antiproteinuric effect in vivo, perhaps because of the
  decreased activity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), similar to treatment with
  Eplerenone (level 6). Synergistic mechanisms on level 6 include (a) the Rac1-driven
  insertion of TRPC5 channels in the plasma membrane (level 6), which potentiates
  the activity of Rac1 in a positive feedback loop, and (b) the effects of Rac1 on
  the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in maladaptive podocyte foot process motility,
  which correlates with proteinuria (level 6). RhoA and Cdc42 also affect the actin
  cytoskeleton (level 6). NFAT promotes TRPC6 transcription (level 6). Although AngII
  and AT1Rs are centrally important in podocyte Ca2+signaling, inputs from many other
  pathways are likely to modulate the molecular events in each of the signaling levels,
  for example, signaling through the Nephrin pathway. This model also offers an explanation
  why the combined inhibition of several levels is necessary for effective and sustained
  antiproteinuric treatment (TLRs, toll-like receptors; RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases).'
