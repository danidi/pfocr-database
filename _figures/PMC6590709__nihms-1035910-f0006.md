caption: N-glycans with terminal α2,6-sialylation are synthesized by the β-galactoside
  α−2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GalI). Both upregulation of ST6GalI and increase in
  α2,6-sialylation are observed in many types of cancers and are associated with negative
  patient outcomes. In fact, α2,6-sialylation is involved in the regulation of many
  key proteins that are known to contribute to cell survival and metastasis in cancer.
  a | Hypoxia increases the expression and activity of ST6GalI, leading to enhanced
  α2,6-sialylation; in turn, increased sialylation upregulates HIF1α and the expression
  of pro-survival HIF1α target genes, such as growth factors and glucose transporters.
  b | The death receptor FAS, also known as CD95, is a target of ST6GalI, and its
  sialylation inhibits the initiation of apoptotic signalling and subsequent receptor
  internalization. Increased expression of ST6GalI prevents FAS ligand (FASL)-induced
  apoptosis through FAS. c | Increased expression of ST6GalI in cancer cell lines
  enhances the α2,6-sialylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which
  increases its tyrosine kinase activity and the phosphorylation of its targets. α2,6-Sialylation
  enhances the activity of EGFR, both at baseline and after cell activation, and leads
  to increased activation of pro-growth and survival genes. Moreover, cells in which
  ST6GalI is overexpressed, leading to enhanced α2,6-sialylation, are protected against
  cell death induced by the anticancer drug gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor. d | In cells
  with low ST6GalI expression and reduced α2,6 sialylation, prolonged activation of
  tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1) by TNF leads to receptor internalization,
  caspase activation and cell death. This apoptotic cell death pathway is prevented
  by enhanced α2,6-sialylation of TNFR. e | α2,6-Sialylation of β1 integrin in the
  Golgi apparatus by ST6GalI results in hypersialylation, which inhibits β1 integrin
  binding to matrix proteins such as type I collagen and fibronectin and prevents
  downstream signalling. These signals maintain cell quiescence, and their disruption
  due to enhanced sialylation leads to increased cell motility and invasion, which
  promotes cancer cell metastasis.
