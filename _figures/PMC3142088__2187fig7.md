caption: External stimuli (hyperglycemia, inflammation resulting from trauma, infection,
  or other injury) activate certain cells (e.g., endothelial cells, osteoblasts) to
  release RANKL. When the RANKL/OPG ratio is high as in CN (A), RANKL binds to its
  receptors (RANK) on VSMCs to activate NF-κB and cause downstream cell signaling
  cascades, resulting in osteoblastic differentiation and deposition of mineralized
  matrix leading to MAC. However, when the OPG levels are low or the RANKL/OPG ratio
  is not elevated (B), OPG acts as a decoy receptor mopping excess RANKL and preventing
  human VSMCs from undergoing osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization. SMC,
  smooth muscle cell.
