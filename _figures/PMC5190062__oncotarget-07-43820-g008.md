caption: TMZ activates the DNA damage response pathway due to the generation of DNA
  double strand breaks. If the breaks are repaired, the cells survive; if not, cells
  undergo apoptosis. JLK1486 induces ER stress. If ER stress is resolved, cells survive;
  if not, cells undergo apoptosis through ATF4 mediated up-regulation of CHOP. TMZ+2
  μM JLK1486 treatment prolongs ER stress, activates the DNA damage response, and
  causes unresolved DNA DSBs that result in apoptosis due to decreased RDA51 levels,
  possibly mediated by ER stress induced ATF4 expression. GBM cells generate resistance
  to TMZ through several mechanisms, including increased expression of methyl guanine
  methyl transferase (MGMT), which removes alkyl groups from O6 guanine residues,
  and mutations of the mismatch repair (MMR) system, allowing aberrant cells to enter
  and complete the cell cycle.
