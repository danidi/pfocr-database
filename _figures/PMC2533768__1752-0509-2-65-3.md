caption: Glycolytic Pathway in T. pallidum. Glycolytic pathway in T. pallidum consisting
  of 13 metabolites and 25 fluxes (reversible reactions are shown by double arrows).
  The starting metabolite is α-D-Glucose-1P and the target product is phosphoenolpyruvate
  respectively. The bold (black) arrows represent the optimal pathway obtained by
  the present method and the bold (white) arrows represent the optimal pathway obtained
  by the extreme pathway analysis.
