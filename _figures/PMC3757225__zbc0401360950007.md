caption: Mechanistic model of strain-induced fetal type II cell differentiation via
  integrin-TACE pathway. Conformational changes of α6β1 integrin by mechanical strain
  will enhance binding of these mechanoreceptors to disintegrin domain of ADAM17 (green)
  with subsequent increase of metalloprotease activity (pink) and cleavage of HB-EGF
  and TGF-α. Released ligands will bind to EGFR and induce phosphorylation of this
  receptor, activation of ERK pathway, and increased type II cell differentiation.
