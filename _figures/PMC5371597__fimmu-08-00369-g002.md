caption: Differential functions of different isoforms of NKp30 and NKp44. Immunostimulatory
  NKp30a and NKp30b isoforms interaction with ligands on tumor target cells or immature
  DCs (iDCs) to stimulate degranulation responses and interferon (IFN)-γ production.
  Inhibitory NKp30c isoform instead produces inhibitory cytokine IL-10 upon engagement.
  NKp30c is also less tightly associated with TCR-ζ and triggers stronger activation
  of p38 MAP kinase. The NKp44-1 isoform contains a cytoplasmic ITIM that can transduce
  inhibitory signals when engaged with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ligand
  on target cell surface (pathway “A”), leading to decreased cytotoxicity and IFN-γ
  production. In contrast, all three NKp44 isoforms can engage with NKp44L to transduce
  activation signaling through DAP12 (pathway “B” for NKp44-1) that triggers cytotoxicity
  and IFN-γ production.
