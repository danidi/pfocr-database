caption: Proposed pathogenic sequences in muscle of the G93A mouse model. During ALS
  progression, both accumulation of mutant SOD1 protein and motor axonal withdrawal
  could promote muscle autophagy, a cytoprotective process. At later stage, axonal
  withdrawal becomes not compensable and triggers apoptosis, which leads to caspase‐mediated
  cleavage of autophagy‐related proteins, especially Beclin‐1. The cleavage of Beclin‐1
  inhibits autophagy pathway and further promotes apoptosis. This unbalanced interplay
  between autophagy and apoptosis forms a vicious cycle that could promote muscle
  degeneration and disease progression.
