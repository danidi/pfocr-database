caption: An overview of the regulatory interactions that control SE induction. Treating
  explants with auxin (mostly 2,4-D) activates a number of the TF genes that have
  a regulatory function in embryonic development, including the LEC1 and LEC2 of the
  LAFL group, BBM (PLTs), AGL15 and WUS/WOX genes. The down-stream targets include
  the genes of the TAA1/YUC of the auxin biosynthesis pathway, the PINs that control
  auxin transport and the core regulators of auxin signalling (AUX/IAAs and ARFs).
  Other regulatory elements of the SE-network also involve miRNAs and the epigenetic
  regulators (PKL, VALs, HDACs). The arrows and circle-shaped ends indicate the activation
  or repression of gene expression, respectively. The solid and dashed lines indicate
  the experimentally validated and suggested regulatory interactions, respectively.
  The red and green lines indicate the regulatory interaction between LEC2 and LECs,
  respectively [,,,,,].
