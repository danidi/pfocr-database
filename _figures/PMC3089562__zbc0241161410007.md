caption: Proposed model of how endocardial Jarid2 expression regulates myocardial
  development. A, in the wild type mouse at later stages of development, Jarid2 represses
  Notch1 by binding to the Notch1 +1150-bp locus. Notch1 signaling to the myocardium
  ceases, and there is a decrease in trabecular proliferation and normal terminal
  differentiation. B, in the Jarid2 KO mouse at later stages of development, Jarid2
  does not bind to the +1150-bp Notch1 locus, and Notch1 remains active. The prolonged
  activation of the Notch1 pathway results in increased trabecular proliferation and
  defective terminal differentiation.
