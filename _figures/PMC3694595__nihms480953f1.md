caption: Trigger factors such as allergens, bacteria, mechanical injury, and exogenous
  proteases induce the release of IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)
  from keratinocytes. IL-33, alone or in combination with other cytokines and chemokines,
  activates mast cells, dendritic cells, and (potentially) lymphocytes of innate lineage
  in inflamed skin. Activation of mast cells regulates the function of dendritic cells,
  eosinophils, T cells, and nerves (not shown) via release of cytokines, chemokines,
  growth factors, proteases, and leukotrienes, for example. Via the IL-33–induced
  release of IL-25 and IL-18, dendritic cells regulate the function of T helper type
  2 (Th2) cells and B cells (early) and (probably later) Th1 cells. Via IL-33 induction,
  innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) regulate Th2-driven immune responses in various organs.
  The role of these potentially important cells in Th2 regulation has not been verified
  in skin. ILCs have been described to be important in the early stage of immune signaling
  and probably enhance the Th2 immune response pathway in the skin. The arrows illustrate
  the interaction among the various immune cells and their cell-specific secretion
  products involved in inflammatory skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis. Thus,
  IL-33 may be involved in orchestrating early inflammatory responses in the onset
  and perpetuation of atopic dermatitis. His, histamine; Lkt, leukotriene; OX40 (gp34),
  a member of the TNF superfamily; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α (Modified from ).
