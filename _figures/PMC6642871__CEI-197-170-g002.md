caption: Schematic illustration of the glycolytic switch in different cell types.
  The hypoxic conditions of the synovial joint drives hypoxia‐inducible factor 1‐alpha
  (HIF‐1a)‐induced glycolysis in some of the major cell types of the synovium. HIF‐1a
  induces expression of some of the key molecular switches to encode proinflammatory
  and pro‐glycolytic mechanisms. Specifically, 6‐phosphofructo‐2‐kinase/fructose‐2,6‐biphosphatase
  3 (PFKFB3) is up‐regulated in endothelial cells and synovial fibroblasts in response
  to hypoxia. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is also involved in
  synovial fibroblast activation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PKM2) plays a central role
  in the metabolic switch observed in inflammatory macrophages and activated monocytes.
  DC metabolism can be directed by protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathways in early
  activation while mTOR‐mediated induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
  is important during later stages of DC activation, while glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) and PFKFB3 are key players in the metabolic switch observed in effector T
  cells.
