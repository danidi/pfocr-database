caption: Normal and abnormal adrenal steroidogenesis in the zona fasciculata. The
  normal pathway is shown on the left. Loss of function mutations in CYP21A2 (steroid
  21-hydroxylase) lead to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH; right), resulting in
  a massive increase in 17-hydroxyprogesterone. This 17-hydroxyprogesterone and upstream
  precursors are metabolized to androgens, probably via several distinct pathways.
