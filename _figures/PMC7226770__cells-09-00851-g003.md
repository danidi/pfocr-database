caption: 'The blood–brain barrier, theoretically a motorway for a melting-pot of EXOs.
  Five routes have been described for EXOs interacting with a receiving cell: (1)
  association with a protein G-coupled receptor on the cell surface, inducing a signaling
  cascade; (2) adhesion to the cell surface and fusion, releasing the EXOs content
  in the cytoplasm, which can lead to several types of events, including cell signaling;
  (3) macropinocytosis; (4) nonspecific/lipid raft; or (5) receptor-mediated transcytosis,
  leading to its entry into the cell through the endocytic pathway and its storage
  in the MVB. Then, three outcomes remain possible for EXOs: (i) degradation by lysosomes;
  (ii) signaling induction through a backfusion event in the MVB releasing its content
  in the cytoplasm; or (iii) trafficking from the MVB to the plasma membrane as neoformed
  ILVs in the receiving cell. It is worth noting that except in pathological models,
  under TNF-α treatment [], EVs and EXOs have not been described to cross the BBB
  through the paracellular pathway. Abbreviations: AJs: Adherens Junctions; EC: Endothelial
