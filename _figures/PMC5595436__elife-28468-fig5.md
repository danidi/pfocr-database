caption: The question marks indicate unidentified enzymes. The blue colored acyl chains
  are positioned on the sucrose molecule based on results of positive mode fragmentation
  characteristics, co-elution assays, and comparisons with purified acylsugars. Main
  activities are shown in solid arrows and potential alternate activities - where
  acylation positions and enzymatic activities are hypothesized based on in vitro
  and in vivo findings - are shown in dashed arrows. An asterisk (*) next to the acylsugar
  names indicates no NMR structure is available for the acylsugar in Salpiglossis
  or Petunia, and the acyl chain positions are postulated based on their fragmentation
  patterns in positive and/or negative mode, and on hypothesized enzyme activities
  as described in the main text.
