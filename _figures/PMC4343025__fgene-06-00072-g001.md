caption: Genome organization and biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNA genes are
  interspersed in the genome with various possible locations as depicted on top. The
  figure summarizes the steps of the canonical miRNA biogenetic pathway, including
  the production of a primary transcript (pri-miRNA) by RNA polymerase II or III (Pol
  II or III), nuclear and cytoplasmic processing, loading into the miRISC complex,
  and the degradation of mature miRNAs. The function of miRNAs is exerted in the cytosol
  at the level of the miRISC, where miRNAs induce target gene repression by various
  mechanisms, including inhibition of protein synthesis and mRNA destabilization.
