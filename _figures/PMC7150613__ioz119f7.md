caption: Summary figure representing the proposed pathway of OS-induced p38MAPK-GSK3β-mediated
  signaling in amnion cells. Oxidative stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  activates p38MAPK and mediates the inactivation of GSK3β by phosphorylating Ser9.
  Inactivation of GSK3β effects downstream targets Nrf2 and β-Cat. In response to
  OS, there is increased translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus likely as an antioxidant
  response. Active GSK3β degrades β-Cat, while OS-induced GSK3β inactivation allows
  for the accumulation of β-Cat in the cell. AEC β-Cat does not get translocated to
  the nucleus; instead, β-Cat is likely packaged within exosomes and cargoed out of
  the cell.
