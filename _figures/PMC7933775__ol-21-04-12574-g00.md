caption: Hippo signaling pathway. In response to high cell density, NF2 and WWC1 activate
  the Hippo signaling pathway by binding to LATS1/2 to facilitate their activation
  by MST1/2. In turn, MST1/2 bind to the cofactor, SAV1, to form an enzymatic complex
  that phosphorylates and activates the LATS1/2 kinases, and the MOB1A/B regulatory
  subunits of LAST1/2. Subsequently, LATS1/2 phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivators,
  YAP and TAZ, which in turn translocate in the cytoplasm and get inactivated. In
  cancer, the Hippo signaling is abnormally inactivated and LATS1/2 are not activated
  by MST1/2. The YAP/TAZ complex translocates to the nucleus and binds with TEAD to
  activate the transcription of its target genes, including CTGF, CYR61, Gli2 and
  AREG. NF2, neurofibromatosis type 2; WWC1, WW And C2 domain containing 1 gene; LATS1/2,
  large tumor suppressors 1 and 2; MST1/2, upstream sterile 20-like kinase 1 and 2;
  SAV1, Salvador homologue 1; MOB1A/B, MOB kinase activator 1A and B; YAP, Yes-associated
  protein; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif; TEAD, transcriptional
  enhancer factor domain; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; CYR61, cysteine-rich
  angiogenic inducer 61; Gli2, glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 2; AREG,
  amphiregulin.
