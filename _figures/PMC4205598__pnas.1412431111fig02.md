caption: QS-dependent changes in the levels of metabolites involved in central carbon
  metabolism. The levels of metabolites of the Entner–Doudoroff and pentose phosphate
  pathways were plotted on pathway maps. The x and y axes refer to two different incubation
  times and show metabolite concentrations (in pmol per 109 cells), respectively.
  Red, blue, and black lines indicate wild-type BGR1, the tofI mutant BGS2, and the
  qsmR mutant BGS9, respectively. Blunt arrows in red indicate QsmR-mediated repression
  of target genes. Each value is an average of data from three independent experiments,
  and statistical analysis of the data are presented in .
