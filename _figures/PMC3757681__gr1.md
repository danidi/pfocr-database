caption: Consequences of oxidative stress on proteins, the proteasomal system and
  transcription factors. (A) The 26S proteasome is highly susceptible to inactivation
  during oxidative stress (figured as flash symbol) leading to an excessive accumulation
  of polyubiquitinated proteins. (B) Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has the ability
  to sense and bind ubiquitinated proteins via the BUZ (bound to ubiquitin zinc finger)
  domain which induces the dissociation of a complex formed out of Hsp90, HSF-1, p97/VCP
  and HDAC6 . Following the liberation of HDAC6 and p97/VCP , the latter uses either
  its ATP dependent segregase activity to dissolve the bond between Hsp90 and HSF-1
  directly or p97/VCP stimulates the Hsp90 ATPase activity, which results in the release
  of HSF-1 and the consequence up-regulation of several heat shock proteins, such
  as Hsp70 and Hsp 27 . Beyond up-regulation of classical Hsps upon proteasome inhibition,
  HDAC6 is also involved in an induction of HO-1 after proteasome inhibition . Initiation
  of this pathway is also the detection of ubiquitinated proteins and the release
  of HDAC6 and mediated by a p38/MAPK-dependent activation of Nrf-2, which is the
  most important transcriptional activator of HO-1 gene translation [171]. Further
  HDAC6 has the ability to favor the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in
  cellular aggresomes by interaction with ubiquitin and dynein motors. Aggresomes
  are inclusion bodies next to the nucleus at the proximity end of the microtubule
  organizing center, finally eliminated by an autophagy-mediated mechanism. (C) Furthermore,
  a pivotal regulatory protein function is disrupted by 26S proteasomal inhibition,
  the transcription factor NFϰB. This factor binds to multiple DNA sequences, initiating
  the transcription of gene products including various cytokines, angiogenesis factors,
  cell adhesion molecules, enzymes and antiapoptotic factors . NFϰB is located in
  the cytoplasm in an inactive form, bound to an inhibitor molecule IϰB. Stimulation
  of cells through a variety of mechanisms triggers a cascade of signaling events
  resulting in the degradation of IϰB by the proteasome. This degradation releases
  active NFϰB, which then translocates into the nucleus and binds to specific DNA
  sequences on its target genes . Proteasomal inhibition blocks NFϰB activation and
  leads among others to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and apoptosis.
  (D) The activity of the 20S proteasome, which is mostly responsible for the degradation
  of oxidized proteins and less susceptible to direct oxidative stress, can be nevertheless
  diminished by aggregated oxidized proteins. These protein aggregates are formed
  under stress conditions as complexes of unfolded proteins which do not normally
  interact with each other. It might require several steps depending on the nature
  of the initial conditions, leading to unfolding and aggregate formation. Due to
  the complex process of intermolecular interactions, such as during physiological
  aging, the process of aggregation is slow . The aggregate is independent from the
  original structure of the protein and introduces a new toxic element into cellular
  metabolism, partly by inhibiting 20S proteasome. (E) Another side effect of proteasome
  inhibition is leading to a higher amount of phosphorylated c-Jun leading to an activation
  of AP-1, known to control the expression of MMP-1  and numerous other genes. Subsequently
  increased extracellular protein degradation can be assumed, as observed in skin
  aging. (F) When proteolytic capacity declines below a critical threshold of activity
  required to cope with oxidative stress, the final consequence is the accumulation
  of aggregated proteins which may, instead, cross-link with one another or form extensive
  hydrophobic bonds. This material might undergo further reactions and finally form
  the age pigment lipofuscin which has toxic properties and accumulates in the lysosomal
  system.
