caption: The anti-inflammatory mechanism of omentin. Omentin activates AMPK, which
  further blocks E-selection and reduces endothelial inflammation. AMPK also activates
  eNOS, which has vasodilation effect and blocks JNK signaling. JNK activates inflammation
  through TNFα mediated COX2 effect. Moreover, omentin inhibits NF-κB signaling pathway
  and thus inhibits inflammation. Under obese state, the production of omentin is
  lower which is associated with worse proinflammation and possible lung injury.
