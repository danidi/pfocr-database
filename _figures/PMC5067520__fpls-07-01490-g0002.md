caption: 'Plant sphingolipid synthesis. (A) The four classes of plant sphingolipids
  (from Cacas et al., ). The left panel displays the nine molecular species of long-chain
  bases found in plants, from top to bottom: sphinganine/dihydrosphingosine, d18:0;
  sphingosine/sphing-4(trans)-enine, d18:1Δ4(E); sphing-8(trans)-enine, d18:1Δ8(E);
  sphing-8(cis)-enine, d18:1Δ8(Z); sphinga-4,8(trans, trans)-dienine, d18:1Δ4, 8(E,
  E); sphinga-4,8(trans, cis)-dienine, d18:1Δ4, 8(E, Z); phytosphingosine/4-hydroxysphinganine,
  t18:0; 4-hydroxysphing-8(trans)-enine, t18:1Δ8(E); 4-hydroxysphing-8(cis)-enine,
  t18:1Δ8(Z). On the right panel (from top to bottom) are showed a ceramide (sphing-4(trans)-enine-N-octadecanoic
  acid), a glucosylceramide (Glucosyl-O-β-ceramide (sphing-4(trans)-enine-N-octadec-9(cis)-enoic
  acid)) and a glycosyl-inositolphosphoryl-ceramide (N-acetylglucosamine-glucuronic
  acid-inositolphosphoryl-ceramide (4-hydroxysphing-8(cis)-enine-N-tetracosanoic acid)).
  (B) In situ simplified view of the plant sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. Except
  for the serine and palmitoyl-CoA precursors, sphingolipid metabolites appear in
  colored rectangles: green for long-chain bases, orange for ceramides and red for
  final products like glucosylceramides (GluCer) and glycosyl-inositolphosphoryl-ceramides
  (GIPC). Nomenclature for ceramide is as follows: for instance, d18:0-16:0 indicates
  that the long-chain base corresponds to sphinganine and the fatty acid is a palmitoyl
  moiety, respectively. Enzymes are written in red. Abbreviations: CerS, ceramide
  synthase; DAG, diacylglycerol; FAHase, fatty acid hydroxylase; GCS, glucosylceramide
  synthase; GTase, glycosyl-transferase; IPCS, inositolphosphoryl-ceramide synthase;
  IPUT1, INOSITOLPHOSPHORYL-CERAMIDE GLUCURONOSYL-TRANSFERASE 1; LCB, long-chain base;
  LCB DESase, LCB desaturase; LCB OHase, LCB hydroxylase; LCFA, long-chain fatty acid;
  LOH, LAG ONE HOMOLOG; PI, phosphatidylinositol; SPT/FBR11, serine palmitoyl-CoA
  transferase/FUMONISIN-RESITANT 11; SLD1,2, SPHINGOLIPID LCB Δ8 DESAUTRASE 1,2; UDP-Glc,
  uridine diphosphate-glucose; VLCFA, very-long-chain fatty acid.'
