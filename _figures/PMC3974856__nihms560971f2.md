caption: (A) pDC are recruited into the tumor microenvironment via multiple receptor-ligand
  interactions. Interaction of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1/CCL12 with CXCR4
  on pDC can upregulate very late Ag (VLA)-5 for transendothelial migration via VCAM-1
  and can protect pDC from IL-10-induced apoptosis []. CCL20 binding to CCR6 on pDC
  can recruit pDC to the tumor site []. Factors produced within the tumor microenvironment
  can modulate IFNα production via TLR9 stimulation. pDC cultured with tumor cells
  can induce IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells and CD8+ Treg [, ]. (B) CD19+ pDC in
  tumor-draining LN (TDLN) produce high levels of IDO which can activate mature Treg
  via activation of the general control non-depressive kinase 2 (GCN2) pathway of
  protein synthesis inhibition []. Activated Treg can then activate other DC, leading
  to upregulation of PD-L1 which suppresses anti-tumor T cell responses. pDC-produced
  IDO and activated Treg can also convert naïve T cells into new Treg. IDO acts in
  an autocrine manner to suppress pDC production of IL-6, which prevents the conversion
  of Treg into IL-17-producing Th17 pro-inflammatory cells []. IDO also downregulates
  IFNα production by pDC [].
