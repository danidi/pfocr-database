caption: Schematic representation of overlapping molecular mechanisms involved in
  the onset and progression of DM and AD that can be modulated by the specific action
  of phenolic compounds. Decreasing levels of insulin (and/or insulin action), a characteristic
  of DM, contribute to the decrease in IGF that causes a decrease in acetyl-CoA levels
  which, consequently, causes a decrease in ACh levels, leading to cognitive decline.
  In addition, the high levels of ROS (increased due to the dysregulation of glucose
  metabolism caused by decreased insulin levels and/or insulin action) activate the
  caspase-dependent pathway that results in cellular apoptosis and, consequently,
  destroys nerve cells. ROS also oxidize thioredoxin, which increases the expression
  of the BACE1 and PS1, genes responsible for β-amyloid peptide production. Convergently,
  the production of this peptide is also enhanced by the release of inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, promoted by ROS. Increased β-amyloid peptide production
  is characteristic of AD and inhibits autophosphorylation of insulin receptors, contributing
  to increased insulin resistance (characteristic of DM), and therefore, to hyperglycaemia.
  Phenolic compounds can act in some of the mechanisms previously described, having
  a positive effect in DM and AD. For instance, EGCG is able to increase insulin secretion,
  and thus, ameliorate hyperglycaemia. Catechins (namely EC, ECG, EGC and EGCG), theaflavins
  and quercetin can delay or inhibit the hydrolysis of ACh, preventing the decrease
  of ACh levels. Several phenolic compounds, such as genistein, resveratrol, EC, EGC,
  EGCG, gallic acid, luteolin, curcumin and quercetin can act as antioxidants, reducing
  ROS levels, and therefore reducing the activation of mechanisms of pathogenesis
  progression. Furthermore, genistein, resveratrol, EGCG and gallic acid are capable
  of modulating caspase 3, while luteolin can down-regulate PS1 expression, and resveratrol,
  curcumin and luteolin can decrease inflammatory cytokines release, and so, these
  compounds can have an inhibiting effect on apoptosis and/or β-amyloid peptide formation
  besides through ROS modulation. Upwards arrows and downwards arrows (grey) represent
  increase and decrease, respectively. Arrow-headed lines and bar-headed lines (black)
  represent activation and inhibition, respectively. The ball-headed lines (grey)
  represent the effect of the phenolic compounds. Acetyl-CoA - Acetyl-coenzyme A;
