caption: A hypothetical model for the proposed signaling network involved in E2-BSA-induced
  ESC migration. E2-BSA increases FAK activity as well as EGFR phosphorylation via
  c-Src. Membrane ER-dependent FAK and EGFR-dependent N-WASP/cdc42/TOCA-1 signaling
  pathways stimulated profilin-1 expression and cofilin-1 phosphorylation, which increased
  F-actin expression levels. E2-BSA is estradiol-6-O-carboxymethyloxime-BSA.
