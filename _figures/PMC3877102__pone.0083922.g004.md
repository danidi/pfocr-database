caption: First, a signaling network is launched by CellDesigner. The identities of
  proteins involved in the network are retrieved by the CellDesigner plugin API to
  look up corresponding protein structures in 3D through a protein identity-to-structure
  mapping system. Second, users submit test compounds for docking simulation. After
  docking simulation using three docking tools, machine learning system A is then
  applied to re-score generated binding modes based on features of binding interactions
  and the test compound's molecular properties, after which, it ranks them. Machine
  learning system B is subsequently to select a binding mode with the greatest reliability
  from the three top-score modes. Screening is iterated to assess the next protein
  until all pathway proteins have been tested. Finally, docking scores are converted
  into a white-to-red color scale to interpret binding strength, and are projected
  on the network map for a comprehensive inspection.
