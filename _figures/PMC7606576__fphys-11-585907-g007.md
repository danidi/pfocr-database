caption: Simplified model of the role of CCCs in the modulation of pain perception.
  The high NKCC1 to KCC activity ratio in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) primary sensory
  neurons sets the [Cl–]i at high levels (∼40 mM) (). Thus, in these cells, the ECl–
  is less negative than the Vm and stimulation of GABAAR located in their synaptic
  terminals by GABA released from terminals of inhibitory interneurons leads to Cl–
  efflux and primary afferent depolarization (PAD). PAD inhibits glutamate release
  preventing excitation of dorsal horn neurons. This mechanism is known as pre-synaptic
  inhibition. In contrast, dorsal horn neurons, like other CNS neurons, have a low
  [Cl–]i due in large part to a high KCC2 activity. Thus, GABA released from terminals
  of inhibitory interneurons stimulate GABAAR on the post-synaptic membranes of dorsal
  horn neurons and this leads to GABAAR mediated Cl– influx and hyperpolarization
  of the post synaptic membrane, reducing its excitability. This mechanism is known
  as post-synaptic inhibition. Pre- and post-synaptic inhibition are particularly
  important mechanisms for the modulation of spinal nociceptive processing, and thus,
  altered function of NKCC1 or KCC2 can lead to phenotypes of altered pain perception.
