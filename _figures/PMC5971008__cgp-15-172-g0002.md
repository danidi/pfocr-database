caption: . LMO1 regulates a LIMS1/ILK pathway. In this study, RLN2, RSU1 and LIMS1
  genes are identified as LMO1’s regulatory targets. RSU1 and LIMS1 proteins act as
  a complex with ILK protein in focal adhesion, which is known to transduce several
  oncogenic signals. A cell proliferation inhibition effect of an ILK inhibitor Cpd22
  is demonstrated in this study.
