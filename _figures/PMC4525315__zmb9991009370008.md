caption: Model representing the implication of the GSK-3/β-catenin axis in IRF3-regulated
  RLR-dependent antiviral innate immunity. Virus infection activates TBK1 through
  MAVS, leading to IRF3 phosphorylation. In addition, it activates GSK-3 to phosphorylate
  β-catenin, which in turn is recruited to the IRF3 holocomplex for optimal DNA binding
  of IRF3 and activation of antiviral genes. The model was created with Servier Medical
  Art templates licensed under a CC BY 3.0 license.
