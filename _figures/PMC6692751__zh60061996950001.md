caption: Mechanism of ammonia utilization and myostatin inhibition in avian myotubes.
  The present study is designed to determine if ammonia is used by the enzyme glutamine
  synthetase to produce glutamine (GLN) from glutamate (GLU) in avian myotubes compared
  with mammalian myotubes. Previous studies have reported that GLN can reduce myostatin
  (MSTN) expression by inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.
