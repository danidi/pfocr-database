caption: 'Means to enhance the immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
  To counteract the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-mediated downregulation of immune
  response, two main approaches can be utilized: (A) blocking of immunosuppressive
  effect; (B) triggering MSC to be immunostimulant rather than immunosuppressive.
  (A) MSC can downregulate immune response through several soluble factors such as
  indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) prostaglandin E2 and TGF-β. In turn, TGF-β from
  MSC, tumor cells, and bystander cells in TME can support tumor cell growth and dissemination.
  This latter event is linked to epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) that triggers
  the generation of metastasis. The blockade of MSC immunosuppression can be obtained
  by several means: (a) drugs that inhibit the activity or the generation of molecules
  involved in immunosuppression such as inhibitors of IDO, HO, TGF-β, hepatocyte growth
  factor (HGF), PGE2, NOS, and ARGI–II; (b) antibodies directed either to MSC growth
  receptors, as the epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
  or to the fibroblast activation protein (FAP). It is of note that some of these
  receptors are shared by tumor cells; thus, human or humanized antibodies-based therapy
  can target both MSC and cancer cells. These antibodies act inhibiting the effect
  of a given growth factor but also impairing the function of the target molecule.
  In addition, they trigger complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) elicited by Fcγ receptor-expressing cells, including
  natural killer (NK) cells and γδ T cells. These antibodies can be a portion of antibody–drug
  conjugates (ADC), which join the antibody-mediated effect to that of a cytotoxic
  drug, leading to a strong inhibition of tumor cell growth or MSC-mediated functions.
  (c) cytotoxic T cells equipped with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for
  FAP (FAP-CAR T cells) that can recognize FAP+ cells; (d) drugs affecting the mevalonate
  pathway that is essential for both MSC and tumor cell metabolism; unfortunately,
  mevalonate is relevant also for the development of an optimal immune response; they
  should therefore be used carefully; (e) inhibitors of sheddases, as matrix metalloproteinase
  and a disintegrin and metalloproteinases, which can inhibit tumor cell growth limiting
  the generation of growth factors in a suitable form to trigger proliferation; furthermore,
  these inhibitors should impair the generation of decoy molecules, reducing the competition
  between membrane and soluble ligands for activating receptors on effector lymphocytes;
  (f) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) which block the activity of MSC besides hindering
  tumor cell growth. (B) Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), among which thalidomide,
  pomalidomide, lenalidomide, and avadomide can trigger the innate and the adaptive
  immune responses, besides hampering angiogenesis in the tumor. Aminobiphosphonates
  (N-BPs), such as zoledronic acid, can interfere with the mevalonate pathway strongly
  enhancing the production of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate
  (DMPP). These small pyrophosphates can trigger the expansion of γδ T cells of the
  Vδ2 subset, a cell population with potent anti-tumoral capabilities. Furthermore,
  Vδ2+ T cells express the FcγR involved in ADCC, reinforcing the anti-tumor effect
  of human/humanized antibodies.'
