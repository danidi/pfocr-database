caption: Treatment of a Fanconi mouse model with metformin partially suppresses cancer
  predisposition and rescues HSC defects. Under conditions of stress, HSCs are recruited
  into active cell cycling, leading to altered metabolism with the production of additional
  ROS and potentially an increase in aldehyde production. Metformin may have a metabolic
  effect on HSCs to reduce the production of these toxic molecules. Metformin can
  also react with aldehydes, directly rendering them inert and acting as a scavenger
  for excess aldehydes. Metformin leads to decreased levels of DNA damage circumventing
  the need for an intact Fanconi DNA repair pathway.
