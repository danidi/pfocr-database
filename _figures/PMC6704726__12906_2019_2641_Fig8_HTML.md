caption: The schematic for JZG decreasing the sensitivity of NAFLD to liver injury.
  The schematic of proposed function mechanism for JZG was drew according to the results
  of this study. Various stimuli induce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the
  ER and up-regulate the expression of GRP78 to improve the situation. However, the
  binding of GRP78 with unfolded proteins results in its dissociation with PERK and
  IRE1, causing the activation of these proteins and triggering ERS. PERK is activated
  by autophosphorylation and then phosphorylate EIF2α which promote the activation
  of NFκB. The activation of IRE1α could also mediate the further activation of NFкB
  through TRAF2. JZG could decrease the sensitivity of NAFLD to liver injury in rat
  through regulating ERS signaling pathway GRP78/PERK/EIF2α/NFκB, however, JZG did
  not affect the IRE1/TRAF/ NFκB pathway
