caption: The liver-specific overexpression of soluble human biglycan leads to its
  release into the bloodstream followed by its distribution to the kidneys. Biglycan
  acts as an endogenous ligand of TLR2 and TLR4 in macrophages and triggers CXCL1,
  CXCL2 and CCL2 production through the MyD88 pathway and CCL5 production through
  the TRIF pathway. As a consequence of chemoattractant production, neutrophils, macrophages
  and T cells are recruited to the kidney. hBGN, human biglycan gene; CS/DS, chondroitin
  sulfate/dermatan sulfate; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
