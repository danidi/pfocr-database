caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathway proposed for the AhR-dependent
  control of cell migration. The regulation of c-Src and β1-integrin through the AhR
  target gene Cbp/Pag1 has been reported in our previous study []. Here we propose
  that a certain amount of cytosolic AhR locates in the vicinity of the plasma membrane
  during cell migration. This membrane-related AhR associates into a common protein
  complex with Cav1 and favors its enrichment in DRMs of the plasma membrane. It is
  likely that this functional relationship between AhR and Cav-1 helps establish a
  suitable Cav-1 distribution at the leading edge of directionally migrating fibroblasts.
  Cholesterol probably has a relevant role in this mechanism because it is a major
  lipid in defining DRM regions in the plasma membrane and because its levels are
  controlled by AhR. The importance of phosphorylation in determining the localization
  of Cav-1 is not yet clearly defined despite being a target of c-Src kinase in T-FGM
  fibroblasts [].
