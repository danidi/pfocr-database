caption: The Sterol Biosynthetic Pathway and Sterol Contents in the Wild Type and
  brd2.Proposed biosynthetic pathways of the wild type (left) and brd2 (right) are
  shown. The end products of the Dim/dwf1-requiring pathways are enclosed in boxes
  with solid lines, and those of the Dim/dwf1-free pathway are enclosed in boxes with
  dashed lines. Sterol levels were measured by two independent experiments. The level
  of DS was not corrected by an internal standard. The number of arrows does not represent
  the number of chemical reaction steps. nd, not detected.
