caption: 'The Unfolded Protein Response in the ER. Several environment alterations
  including changes in the cellular redox state, calcium concentration, ATP concentration,
  and inhibition of protein glycosylation affect the protein folding capacity of the
  ER. Three transmembrane ER receptors, IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, sense unfolded proteins
  in the lumen of the ER and promote the transcription of genes whose protein products
  increase the folding capacity of the cell: ER chaperones [BIP, calnexin, protein
  disulfide isomerase (PDI), and calreticulin], ER biosynthetic machinery, and components
  of the ERAD degradation pathway.'
