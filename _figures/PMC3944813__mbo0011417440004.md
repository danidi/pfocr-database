caption: 'Depletion of the NAD cofactor leads to suppression of metabolic flux over
  numerous essential NAD-dependent pathways. A stronger early response was observed
  in pathways where multiple consecutive steps required NAD(P) cofactors as illustrated
  by several examples from [13C]glucose (13C-Glc) labeling and GC-MS metabolite profiling
  studies (for additional data, see  in the supplemental material). In a simplified
  diagram of central metabolism, metabolites are shown by abbreviations in circles
  as follows: 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; Asp, aspartate; Thr, threonine; Ile, isoleucine;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Tyr, tyrosine; Phe, phenylalanine; Ser, serine; Gly, glycine;
  Ac-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA); KG, α-ketoglutarate; Cit, citrate; Suc,
  succinate; Fum, fumarate; Mal, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate; Glu, glutamate; Glc, glucose;
  C16, C16:0 fatty acid; C24, C24:0 fatty acid. Redox reactions utilizing NAD(H) or
  NADP(H) cofactors are marked by a red arrow. Dashed lines reflect multiple reactions.
  In graphs A to E, the percentages of de novo synthesis from glucose versus other
  biosynthetic, salvage, or recycling fluxes are compared for samples without (white
  bars) and with (gray bars) knockdown of NadD. Analyzed samples were typically obtained
  at 6 h postinduction by ATc (except for C16 and C24, where measurements at 6 and
  8 h are indicated) when the growth rates of induced and noninduced cells remained
  comparable (as described for the lower panel in ). Induction of NadE typically showed
  similar effects. (A) Chorismate pathway. (B) Serine and glycine synthesis. (C) Amino
  acids derived from aspartate. (D) Fatty acid synthesis. (E) tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle.'
