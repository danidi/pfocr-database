caption: Molecular mechanisms that control AII amacrine cell coupling. Changes in
  steady-state coupling are accomplished by opposing actions of an activity-dependent
  phosphorylating mechanism and a diffusible cue-dependent dephosphorylating mechanism.
  Non-synaptic NMDA receptors associated with the Cx36 gap junctions are activated
  by spillover glutamate derived from On pathway bipolar cells in response to any
  light (left side). NMDA receptor activation in turn activates CaMKII and phosphorylates
  Cx36 to enhance coupling. In the presence of bright light (right side), dopaminergic
  amacrine cells secrete dopamine, which activates D1 dopamine receptors on AII amacrine
  cells and many other targets. Gs signaling from D1 receptors activates adenylyl
  cyclase, increasing PKA activity. PKA activity in turn activates PP2A, which dephosphorylates
  Cx36 to reduce coupling. PP1 inhibits the pathway and is presumed to dephosphorylate
  PP2A. The light thresholds for these two pathways differ by several orders of magnitude,
  imparting a biphasic pattern of electrical coupling that adapts the AII amacrine
  cell to operate in different light regimes.
