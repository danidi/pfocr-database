caption: Hippo pathway activity and breast cancer cell stemness. Different mechanisms
  responsible for Hippo pathway inactivation are illustrated in this figure. miRNA125
  targets the Hippo pathway activator LIFR and induces TAZ activity. Also, TAZ was
  found to activate the expression of α5 subunit of laminin (LM) 511 and the formation
  of a LM511 matrix. Reciprocally, LM511 activates α6Bβ1 integrin that activated TAZ.
  Finally, TWIST increases PAR1 expression which consequently inhibits the Hippo pathway
  and induces TAZ function. TAZ activation through all these mechanisms increases
  the expression of breast cancer cell stemness related genes.
