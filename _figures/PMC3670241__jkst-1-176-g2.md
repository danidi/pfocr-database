caption: 'Figure 2. The adult midgut. (A) Homeostasis: absorptive polyploid enterocytes
  (ECs, blue) comprise the majority of the intestinal epithelium. Interspersed are
  hormone-producing enteroendocrine (ee) cells (green). Intestinal stem cells (ISCs)
  (yellow) are found close to the basement membrane (BM, red line). Visceral muscle
  cells (VM, dark green) reside under the basement membrane. ISCs express high levels
  of the Notch ligand Delta (red circles). Yorkie (Yki) activity is repressed in ISCs
  and ECs by the Hippo (Hpo) pathway. Notch signaling is prominent in enteroblasts
  (EBs, orange), the ISC daughter cell that gives rise to EC and ee cells. Activity
  of the JAK-STAT pathway (denoted pSTAT) is highest in EBs. STAT92E function is required
  in EBs for differentiation (arrows from pSTAT to EC and ee cells). Whether ISCs
  require JAK-STAT signaling for self-renewal is still controversial, as is the cellular
  source of upd (see text for details). (B) Regeneration: under a variety of conditions,
  including basement membrane damage (DSS), bacterial infection or bleomycin, ISC
  proliferation rate is dramatically increased as a regenerative response in the intestinal
  epithelium. In ECs, JNK signaling is activated while Hpo is inactivated. This leads
  to the nuclear accumulation of Yki, which directly or indirectly induces upd genes,
  in particular upd3. Upd ligands act non-cell-autonomously on ISCs and activate STAT92E
  (pSTAT) in these stem cells, which rapidly increases their proliferation rate. Upd
  can also be produced by ISCs, which then acts in an autocrine manner to stimulate
  ISC mitoses. Some groups have reported that Yki is activated in ISCs during regeneration
  and that this drives ISC proliferation in parallel to JAK-STAT signaling.'
