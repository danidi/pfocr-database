caption: Increased sensitivity of mutant huntingtin striatal cells to glutamate and
  dopamine receptor activation involves enhanced Cdk5 activity. Hypothetical model
  to depict the link between neurotoxicity induced by dopamine and glutamate receptor
  activation and the Cdk5 pathway in HD. Enhanced activation of NMDAR and D1R induced
  by mutant huntingtin leads to deregulation of calcium homeostasis (; ; ; ). Increased
  intracellular calcium in turn leads to higher calpain activity that results in enhanced
  cleavage of p35 into p25 (). In addition, as our data demonstrate, activation of
  NMDAR may potentiate D1R-mediated phosphorylation of Cdk5 at Tyr15, which has been
  shown to regulate Cdk5-induced neurotoxicity (). The generation of p-Cdk5/p25 complexes
  implies Cdk5 hyperactivation that is responsible for the phosphorylation of new
  substrates such as tau protein. Now, hyperphosphorylation of tau in concert with
  unknown yet down-stream p25/Cdk5 effectors might contribute to striatal cell death
  and dysfunction and therefore to HD neuropathology. The model is supported by the
  capacity of roscovitine, a Cdk5 inhibitor, to prevent cellular death induced by
  NMDAR and D1R activation.
