caption: 'Multiple Smad phosphoisoforms exist. (A) The canonical TGF-β and Ras-activated
  MAPK pathways. Following phosphorylation (p) of their C-termini by TβRI, Smad2 and
  Smad3 partner with the common mediator Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus. TGF-β
  also activates the Ras/MAPK pathway; the MAPK pathway induces the phosphorylation
  of a variety of TFs that co-operate with nuclear Smads in mediating TGF-β-induced
  transcriptional responses. SBE, Smad-binding element; TBE, transcription factor-binding
  element. (B) Schematic representation of phosphorylation sites in Smad2 and Smad3.
  Catalytically, active TβRI phosphorylates COOH-tail serine residues. ERK, JNK, p38
  MAPK and CDK4 alternatively phosphorylate Smad2/3 at specific sites in their middle
  linker regions as lines indicate. Several other kinases such as glycogen synthase
  kinase-3β also phosphorylate Smad2/3 at the specific sites in the linker segments.
  (C) Three Smad phosphoisoform types: pSmad2C and pSmad3C; pSmad2L and pSmad3L and
  pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L/C. TβRI and Ras-associated kinases differentially phosphorylate
  Smad2/3 to create three phosphorylated forms (phosphoisoforms): C-terminally phosphorylated
  Smad2/3 (pSmad2C and pSmad3C); linker phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pSmad2L and pSmad3L)
  and dually phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L/C). Except for cytoplasmic
  localization of pSmad2L, the other phosphoisoforms localize to cell nuclei.'
