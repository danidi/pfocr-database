caption: Interplay between the ribosomal stress-ribosomal proteins-p53-MDM2 pathway
  and the ribosomal stress-ribosomal proteins-c-Myc pathway. In response to nucleolar
  stress, several ribosomal proteins (RPs) as well as NS and C23 not only associate
  with MDM2 and inhibit its activity toward p53, consequently activating p53, but
  also suppress c-Myc transcriptional activity and c-Myc mRNA expression. As a concerted
  outcome, cells undergo growth arrest, senescence, and apoptosis.
