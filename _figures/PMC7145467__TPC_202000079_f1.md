caption: A Novel Pathway Links GA Signaling with Cold Stress Response in Arabidopsis.Members
  of the GRF transcription factor family are transcriptionally regulated by GA and
  DELLAs during cold stress. New data indicating that GRF5 represses CBF gene expression
  suggests crosstalk between the GA pathway in the cold and broader cold stress-induced
  transcriptional changes. (Reprinted from , Figure 9A.)
