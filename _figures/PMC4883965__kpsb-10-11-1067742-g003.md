caption: Model of role of AgNO3 in primary, linear and suggested secondary, lateral
  ethylene signaling pathway. Secondary ethylene pathway (responsible for transduction
  of signal of S deficit) is presented on the left, primary on the right. The most
  speculative parts of pathway (including 3 distinct possibilities of signal transduction
  from ethylene receptors to EIL3 (also known as SLIM1) is light gray. AHP1 (histidine-containing
  phosphotransmitter1), ARR2 (2-component response regulator ARR2), MAPK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase), MEK also known as MAPKK (MAPK kinase).
