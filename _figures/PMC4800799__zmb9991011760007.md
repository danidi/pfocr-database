caption: Model depicting the proposed effect of starvation on microRNA in cancer cells.
  Initially, when placed under starvation conditions, cancer cells increase protein
  expression of the stress response protein PLD. The enzymatic product of PLD, PA,
  subsequently serves to signal miRNA gene expression, thereby regulating PLD protein
  translation in a negative-feedback pathway. The model compiles the repertoire of
  miRNAs that suppress PLD translation in response to an elevated PA level. The elevated
  PLD level results in a rise of the cellular PA level, therefore inducing expression
  of miRNAs that suppress PLD translation. PLD gene, protein, and activity are enhanced
  specifically in cancer cells under conditions of cellular stress frequently occurring
  at the tumor core, such as hypoxia, starvation, or overconfluence. This elevation
  of PLD activity results in an increased expression of multiple miRNAs in low-invasive
  tumor cells leading to feedback inhibition of PLD expression. However, high-invasive
  tumor cells lose the ability to induce these miRNAs, resulting in an uncontrolled
  PA level and the subsequent inhibition of apoptosis through the mTOR pathway.
