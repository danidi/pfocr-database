caption: 'UPR signaling pathways in mammalian cells. The UPR is mediated by three
  ER-resident transmembrane proteins that sense ER stress through Grp78/BiP binding/release
  to their luminal domains and/or through direct interaction with unfolded proteins.
  The kinase PERK (double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase) is
  activated by dimerization and phosphorylation. Once activated, it phosphorylates
  eIF2α (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2). This inhibits protein translation,
  reducing the overload of misfolded proteins. This pathway also selectively enhances
  translation of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) that induces the expression
  of CHOP. In ER-stressed cells, IRE1α (inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and
  endonuclease) multimerizes and autophosphorylates, setting in motion its RNAse activity.
  Activated IRE1α initiates the unconventional splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcriptional
  factor XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1) to produce sXBP1, a more stable form of XBP1
  with a potent transactivator domain that enhances transcription of genes involved
  in protein folding, secretion, and ER-associated degradation. Another ER stress
  sensor is ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6). This is a type II ER transmembrane
  protein whose cytosolic domain contains a bZIP transcriptional factor. ATF6 is transported
  to the Golgi where it is processed within the transmembrane domain to release the
  cytosolic domain, which translocates to the nucleus and induces expression of the
  ER chaperone Grp78/BiP and XBP1. GADD34, a protein phosphatase upregulated by the
  PERK pathway, dephosphorylates eIF2α to restore global protein synthesis. ERSEs:
  ER stress responsive elements.'
