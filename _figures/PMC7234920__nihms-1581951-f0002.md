caption: 'CoA released in the bloodstream from digested food, cell damage or exocytosis
  (globally referred to as ‘Recycled cellular content’) is degraded to PanSH by the
  combined activity of promiscuous phosphatases and pyrophosphatases. PanSH is then
  specifically hydrolyzed to Pan and cysteamine by the action of the VNN enzymes (VNN1
  and 3 in mice and VNN1–3 in humans). Pan is taken up in each cell from the bloodstream
  through SMVT and used to synthesize CoA. Mouse PANK2 resides in the cytosol, while
  human PANK2 resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. In spite of the different
  subcellular localization of the PANK1–3 isoforms, Pan is likely released into the
  cytosol. The localization of COASY, the last enzyme in the CoA biosynthetic pathway,
  is still debated; thus, the subcellular compartment where CoA is synthesized is
  presently unclear. Major subcellular pools of CoA and acyl-CoAs exist in the cytosol,
  mitochondria and peroxisomes. The pools of free CoA in the mitochondria and peroxisomes
  are in part created by the existence of dedicated transporters that can exchange
  CoA for another adenine-containing substrate, including 3’,5’-ADP. Unlike human
  SLC25A42 and SLC25A17, the activity of SLC25A16 has not been reconstituted in vitro
  and this putative CoA transporter is in parenthesis. Peroxisomes can also directly
  import a variety of acyl-CoAs through the ABCD1–3 transporters. Intracellular reactions
  that hydrolyze (acyl-)CoA are currently known to occur in the lysosomes, peroxisomes,
  and mitochondria. In the lysosomes, CoA can be dephosphorylated to dPCoA, likely
  by the action of LAP. Long-chain acyl-CoAs could be first hydrolyzed to CoA plus
  a non-esterified fatty acid by the lysosomal enzyme PPT, followed by dephosphorylation
  of CoA by LAP. Export of lysosomal dPCoA to the cytosol is expected to require a
  transporter, but none is currently known. Overall, the presence of CoA metabolites
  inside the lysosomes could be the result of intracellular scavenging processes,
  such as autophagy, which can recycle metabolites for a cell-autonomous use or export
  them in the extracellular milieu by fusion with the plasma membrane. Peroxisomes
  and mitochondria contain the (acyl-)CoA-degrading enzymes NUDT7, NUDT19 and NUDT8,
  which hydrolyze CoA and acyl-CoAs to PPanSH or its acylated derivative (acyl-PPanSH),
  respectively, and 3’,5-ADP. Acyl-PPanSH produced in the peroxisomes could be hydrolyzed
  to PPanSH by acyl-CoA thioesterases, possibly ACOT3 and ACOT8, and released in the
  cytosol. Cytosolic PPanSH could directly re-enter the CoA biosynthetic pathway downstream
  of the regulated step catalyzed by the PANKs; alternatively, PPanSH could be dephosphorylated
  to PanSH by an intracellular phosphatase. An inactive human PANK isoform, PANK4,
  has been shown to possess this activity in vitro. With respect to (acyl-)CoA degradation
  in the mitochondria, it remains to be confirmed whether NUDT8 and COASY co-localize
  to the matrix, where PPanSH produced by degradation could be recycled to CoA. Furthermore,
  the ability of mitochondrial ACOTs to hydrolyze acyl-PPanSH to PanSH remains untested.
  Dotted lines indicate unresolved issues, such as the ability of PPanSH to diffuse
  across membranes and the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial ACOTs, which have
  not been experimentally confirmed. Questions marks are used to specify that the
