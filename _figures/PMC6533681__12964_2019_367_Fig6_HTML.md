caption: The total signaling pathway. ERα-induced estrogen effects promoted the expression
  of NOTCH1 by binding NOTCH1 promoter at − 1364 and − 1188 bp, EZH2 was recruited
  by ERα and acts as a cofactor to assist ERα-induced estrogen effects in regulating
  NOTCH1 in PCa. The ERα-induced estrogen effects may promote CD49fHi EMT-PCBSLCs
  metastasis to other organs
