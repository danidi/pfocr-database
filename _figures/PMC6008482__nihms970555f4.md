caption: A) Schematic of the bifurcation of pyruvate metabolism that is prevalent
  in the mammalian cells (green and red arrow) and bacteria (blue arrow). The green
  arrow denotes the predominant fate of pyruvate in normal functioning mammalian cells.
  The red arrow denotes the glycolytic phenotype exhibited by most malignant tumors
  and the blue arrows indicates the primary pathway of wild type bacterial cells.
  B) C1 and C2 labeled co-polarized pyruvate was injected into mammalian cells or
  E. coli. The top spectrum is that of E. coli, a representative gram Gram-negative
  pathogen. The bacterial cell metabolism clearly depicts the formation of acetate.
  In contrast, the bottom two spectra corresponding to renal cell cancer and activated
  macrophages do not have any acetate signal. Furthermore, characteristic mammalian
  cell metabolism is demonstrated by the lactate signal arising from the C1 pyruvate
  representative of glycolysis.
