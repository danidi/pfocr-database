caption: mTORC1 signaling promotes the main steps of adipogenesis, including lineage
  commitment, clonal expansion and terminal differentiation of preadipocytes to mature
  adipocytes, through S6K, C/EBP-β and -δ, 4E-BP, Lipin1, and PPAR-γ, respectively.
  mTORC2 stimulates adipogenesis by activating Akt1 and inhibiting FoxC2. mTORC1 may
  regulate endocrinal function of adipose tissue via promoting production of Leptin,
  Adiponectin and other adipokines. Similarly, mTORC2 may also be involved in adipokine
  synthesis and/or secretion. mTORC1 controls lipogenesis through multiple effectors
  including SREBP-1, Lipin 1, and PPARγ. mTORC2 stimulates lipogenesis in adipose
  tissue and may regulate SREBP-1 levels. mTORC1 suppresses lipolysis by inhibiting
  phosphorylation of HSL as well as reducing ATGL expression through suppression of
  4E-BP regulated Egr1 translation. Moreover, mTORC2 suppresses lipolysis by regulating
  PKA activity. Inhibition of lipolysis and free fatty acid production by mTOR signaling
  may lead to reduced UCP1, and thermogenesis. mTORC2 is localized to MAM and may
  regulate mitochondrial respiration and thermogenesis. Dashed arrows represent unclear
  or hypothetical signaling pathway. Solid arrows represent well-established signaling
  pathway.
