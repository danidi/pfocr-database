caption: (A) Scheme of the actions of mitochondrial poisons such as DNP and CCCP.
  These compounds reduce ATP production and thus increase the AMP/ATP ratio, activating
  AMP kinase and promoting glucose uptake. AICAR is an activator and compound C is
  an inhibitor of AMP kinase. (B) Proposed scheme for the actions of DIF. By uncoupling
  mitochondrial activities, DIF may disturb ATP production and activate AMPK, which
  may then induce GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake. It
  is generally unknown how AMPK activation induces GLUT1 translocation, whereas AMPK
  activation may inhibit GLUT1 internalization (endocytosis) to promote glucose uptake
  by triggering the degradation of TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein), a stimulator
  of GLUT1 endocytosis [,]. Note that DIF may induce GLUT1 translocation partly via
  an AMPK-independent pathway, but it remains to be elucidated how DIF induces GLUT1
  translocation. Glucose may be metabolized immediately via glycolysis and via the
  TCA cycle.
