caption: The CAD enzyme and its role in the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. A, CAD
  catalyzes the conversion of cinnamyl aldehydes to alcohols using NADPH as its cofactor.
  p-Coumaryl aldehyde and alcohol, R1 and R2 = H; caffeoyl aldehyde and alcohol, R1
  and R2 = OH; coniferyl aldehyde and alcohol, R1 = H and R2 = OCH3; sinapyl aldehyde
  and alcohol, R1 and R2 = OCH3. B, A simplified model of the lignin biosynthetic
  pathway where CAD catalyzes the final step in monolignol biosynthesis.
