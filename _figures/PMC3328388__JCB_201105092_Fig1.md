caption: An ATXN1 cellular pathway. ATXN1 is phosphorylated at S776 in the cytoplasm
  upon which it forms a complex with 14-3-3. Association with 14-3-3 blocks dephosphorylation
  of pS776 and transport of ATXN1 to the nucleus. Thus, nuclear transport of ATXN1
  requires dissociation from 14-3-3, the regulation of which has yet to be determined.
  In the nucleus, ATXN1 is involved in alternative splicing by virtue of its interaction
  with RBM17 when phosphorylated on S776, or with U2AF65 after dephosphorylation of
  pS776. ↑[Q]n indicates that an increased interaction of expanded polyQ ATXN1 with
  RBM17 is hypothesized to be critical for driving disease in cerebellar Purkinje
  cells.
