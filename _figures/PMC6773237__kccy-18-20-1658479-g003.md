caption: 'Eph signaling regulates mitotic spindle orientation: working model. Both
  a reverse and a forward Eph signaling would be operating between neuroepithelial
  cells in the Drosophila optic lobe. A forward signaling activates Rok/ROCK, which
  (1) inhibits PI3K-Akt1 signaling pathway and hence proliferation and (2) phosphorylates
  and activates myosin II Sqh/RLC. A reverse signaling at the level of SA activates
  aPKC, which fully activate P-Sqh/P-RLC and this, in turn, impacts on spindle orientation
  by contributing to the correct cortical localization of intrinsic cue regulators,
  such as Cno/Afadin, Dlg1, and Mud/NuMA. SA: SubApical region; AJs: Adherens Junctions;
  BL: Basolateral region. (Adapted from Franco and Carmena, 2019).'
