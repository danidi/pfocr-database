caption: PTEN is the lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K signaling
  pathway. PI3K is induced as a result of receptor binding and activation of receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTK). PI3K phosphorylates the membrane lipid PIP2 to form PIP3.
  PTEN, the lipid phosphatase removes the phosphate and reduce PIP3 levels in the
  cell. By this action, PTEN blocks the receptor binding signal from propagating downstream.
  These downstream signals include a number of kinases that contain the pleckstrin
  homology (PH) domain such as PDK1 and AKT as well as others. Binding of PIP3 to
  the PH domain allows the exposure of residues on AKT that is critically needed for
  its activation. Binding of PIP3 to the PH domain also adds lipid moiety to the molecules
  and allows their association with membranes. The phosphorylation of AKT by PDK1
  leads to its full activation. AKT, a proto-oncoprotein when activated acts as a
  central control for proliferation, cell survival, translation, cell size, and cell
  metabolism. AKT, being a serine/threonine kinase directly phosphorylates and regulates
  the molecules involved in these processes. Phosphorylation of GSK3α/β blocks their
  inhibitor activity on glycogen synthase and β-catenin. Phosphorylation of TSC2 blocks
  its ability to inhibit mTOR, thus allowing the downstream translational events to
  propagate. A prominent function of AKT on cell survival is mediate by its direct
  phosphorylation and negative regulation on caspases 3 and 9 as well as BAD, a proapoptosis
  factor. Phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO blocks the ligand
  dependent cell death as well as having an effect on cell proliferation. Phosphorylation
  of MDM2 by AKT leads to its cytoplasmic translocation and thus blocks its effects
  on p53 degradation. This is believed to be one of the mechanisms for PTEN and p53
  to interact. AKT also has direct effect on cell cycle regulators like p21, p27 and
  cyclin D.
