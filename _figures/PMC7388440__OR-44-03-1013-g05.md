number: Figure 6
caption: RA pathway model. The proposed proliferation and differentiation modulation
  pathway of RA. RA binds to RAR in the cytoplasm and migrates into the nucleus to
  act on RARE regions. Normal transcription and translation result in increased ROR1
  and Wnt5a synthesis and the ROR1 signaling pathway cascades to synaptophysin as
  a node of differentiation as well as β-catenin-related growth and proliferation
  factors. The image was created using BioRender. RA, retinoic acid; ROR1, receptor
  tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1; RAR, RA receptor; RARE, RA response element.
