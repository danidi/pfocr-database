caption: Identification of a functional network and laryngeal cancer-associated DEGs
  from the red-green overlapping DEGs. (A) GO term interactions among overlapping
  DEGs. (B) KEGG pathway interactions among overlapping DEGs. (C) Venn diagram of
  laryngeal cancer associated DEGs downstream of MYCT1 from the GSE123275, GSE6631,
  and TCGA datasets. The blue circle represents the unique DEGs in the GSE6631 green
  module. The yellow circle represents the DEGs in the TCGA-HNSCC red modules. Large
  nodes represent GO terms (A) or KEGG pathways (B), whereas small nodes represent
  the DEGs. The colors of the nodes represent different GO terms or KEGG pathways
  in each network diagram. The red circle represents the DEGs downstream of MYCT1
  in Hep2 cells. In the middle area, 13 genes were distinguished out of three datasets.
