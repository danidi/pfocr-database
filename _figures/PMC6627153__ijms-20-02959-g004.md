caption: PCOS–disease subnetwork 26. Shared proteins and shared pathway (antigen processing
  and presentation) between PCOS and schizophrenia were identified from this subnetwork.
  Different coloring of nodes and lines represents PCOS-related proteins (red), shared
  proteins (orange), PCOS–disease interactions (blue), and protein–pathway interactions
  (green). Shape of nodes denotes PCOS-related proteins (circle), disease (triangle),
  and pathway (square).
