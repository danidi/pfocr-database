caption: The pathway of starch degradation in (A) leaves and of starch synthesis in
  (B) storage organs. (A) Starch is degraded through a series of enzymatic steps to
  maltose and glucose. These are transported from the chloroplast by either the maltose
  export (MEX) or plastidial glucose transport (pGlcT) proteins. Within the cytosol,
  they are converted to sucrose for further transport. (B) There are two pathways
  of starch synthesis in vascular plants. One is shared in all plants (blue arrows),
  while the other is present only in cereal endosperm (red arrows). Sucrose is degraded
  to glucose 6-phosphate, which is transported into amyloplasts by the glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate
  transporter (GPT). The ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase step within the amyloplast
  utilizes ATP, which is imported into the amyloplast by the plastidial ATP/ADP transporter
  (NTT). Within cereal endosperm, ADP-glucose is synthesized extraplastidially and
  is imported into amyloplasts by the Brittle-1 transporter.
