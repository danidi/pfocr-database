caption: Molecular Mechanisms of EndoMT. The diagram shows the TGF-β, ET-1, NOTCH,
  CAV-1, Wnt, NOX4, and HIF-1α pathways that may participate in the EndoMT process.
  The most important pathway is initiated following TGF-β-binding and subsequent activation
  of Smad-dependent and Smad-independent TGF-β intracellular signaling. TGF-β causes
  a direct stimulation of NOX4 expression that results in Snail1 mediated EndoMT.
  ET-1 induces a synergistic stimulation of TGF-β-induced EndoMT involving the canonical
  Smad pathways. Hypoxia also induces EndoMT through the effects of Hif1α activation
  of Snail1. Snail1 has emerged as a crucial regulatory molecule in EndoMT and its
  levels are modulated by GSK3-mediated phosphorylation as phosphorylated Snail1 undergoes
  proteasomal degradation. Cav1 exerts an inhibitory effect owing to the internalization
  of TGF-β receptors and their subsequent degradation. Morphogen pathways including
  Wnt, Sonic Hh, and NOTCH also may modulate EndoMT. The ultimate effect of these
  complex intracellular signaling events is the activation of a mesenchymal cell specific
  transcriptional gene regulation program leading to the increased production of various
  myofibroblast-specific and profibrotic macromolecules including α-SMA, COL1, COL3,
  FN, COMP, and the MMP-inhibitor TIMP. These events are accompanied by the repression
  of EC-specific gene products such as CD31/PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, and von Willebrand
  Factor (not shown in the diagram) resulting in the phenotypic conversion of EC into
  myofibroblasts, the cells ultimately responsible for the fibrotic process.
