caption: MicroRNA genes are transcribed from intergenic or intragenic regions of noncoding
  RNA transcripts mediated by RNA polymerase II, called primary miRNAs (pri-miRNA).
  These long pri-miRNAs are processed by the DROSHA-DGCR8 complex to form precursor
  miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) of approximately 60 nucleotides in length. EXPO5 mediates the
  export of these pre-miRNAs to the cytoplasm for further processing by DICER. DICER
  is a ribonuclease, which cleaves pre-miRNAs to form mature miRNAs of approximately
  20 nucleotides in length. One of the strands of mature miRNA (guide strand) gets
  incorporated into RISC (RNAi induced silencing complex) involving DICER and AGO2
  enzymes to target mRNAs to cause degradation or translational suppression of gene.
  The canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway is significantly perturbed in cancer by several
  proteins at various stages, as highlighted. At the gene level, transcripts are altered
  in cancer by transcription factors such as MYC or by epigenetic modifications. DROSHA
  mediated miRNA processing is suppressed in cancer by hypoxia, involving ETS1/ELK1
  transcriptional repression of the DROHSA gene. Several studies have highlighted
  DICER downregulation in cancer mediated by several factors such as TAP63, hypoxia-mediated
  epigenetic changes, and miR-103/107. EGFR has been reported to bind to AGO2, resulting
  in phosphorylated AGO2 with decreased association to RISC. TRBP is TAR RNA binding
  protein.
