caption: Upon binding to their (small grey oval) cognate ligands most GPCRs are phosphorylated
  by a GRK, which forms a binding site for β-arrestins. β-arrestins may serve as an
  adaptor for an E3 ubiquitin ligase which covalently links ubiquitin to lysine residues
  located in the intracellular domains of the GPCR. The E3 ligase may also interact
  directly with and ubiquitinate a GPCR without the need for an adaptor protein. The
  ubiquitinated receptor is then internalized onto endosomes where the ubiquitin moieties
  may be removed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) resuling in GPCR recycling to
  the plasma membrane and resensitization of receptor signaling. Alternatively, the
  ubiquitin moieties may not be removed, allowing for GPCR recognition and inclusion
  into the ESCRT pathway. The ubiquitin moiety interacts with the ubiquitin binding
  domains of ESCRT-0, which then recruits ESCRT-I, followed by ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III,
  plus accessory factors. In most cases, the ubiquitin moiety is removed from cargo
  by DUBs before incorporation into ILVs of MVBs. The ubiquitin is then recycled and
  used for subsequent functions.
