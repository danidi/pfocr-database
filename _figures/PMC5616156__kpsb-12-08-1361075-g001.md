caption: 'Putative model of CIPK modulation by glutamine. Under NH4+ supply, an over-accumulation
  of glutamine occurs in the root cells of sorghum, especially in salt-stressed plants.
  The signal from glutamine* is suggested to specifically modulate CIPK proteins at
  the allosteric, transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Upon activation of
  CIPK proteins, the operation of the SOS pathway is augmented, activating Na+ extrusion
  by an SOS1 exchanger. Otherwise, NO3− nutrition may also modulate CIPK proteins,
  albeit at a lower intensity. Abbreviations: Ca2+, calcium; GS, glutamine synthetase;
  Na+, sodium; NH4+, ammonium; NiR, nitrite reductase; NO2−, nitrate; NO3−, nitrate;
  NR, nitrate reductase; SOS1, Salt Overly Sensitive 1, a plasma membrane-binding
  Na+/H+ antiporter; SOS2, Salt Overly Sensitive 2, also referred to as CBL-interacting
  protein kinase (CIPK); SOS3, Salt Overly Sensitive 3, also referred to as calcineurin
  B-like protein (CBL).'
