caption: Schematic depiction of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. The
  NER pathway can carry out repair of most nucleotidic damage and lesions that cause
  distortion of the DNA double helix. The DNA damage is recognized by the XPC-Rad23B
  complex, and the helicase activity of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), consisting
  of XPB and XPD, carries out strand unwinding at the damage site. The first incision
  is carried out by the endonuclease XPG 3′—to the lesion, and the second incision,
  5′—to the damage—is performed by the XPF/ERCC1 complex. After removal of the damaged
  nucleotide sequence, the remaining gap is filled by a DNA polymerase, and the nick
  is sealed by a DNA ligase.
