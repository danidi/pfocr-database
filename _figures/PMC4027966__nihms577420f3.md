caption: '(A) ‘Nonthiopurine pathway’ genes. (B) Thiopurine pathway genes. Cytotoxicity
  curves after gene knockdown followed by drug treatment are shown for top candidate
  genes that showed consistent ‘shifts’ in at least two cell lines. In this screening
  test best fit parameters of a four parameter nonlinear regression model were calculated
  and statistical significance was calculated. p-values are indicated if they were
  <0.05. In cases where the curves did not fit the model (GNG2 and KCNMA1 in U87M
  cells and NME1 in U251 cells, all for 6-TG cytotoxicity) the curves could not be
  compared therefore p-values could not be calculated although a clear curve shift
  can be observed.6-MP: 6-mercaptopurine; 6-TG: 6-thioguanine.'
