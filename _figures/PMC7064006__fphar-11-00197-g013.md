caption: Possible metabolic pathway maps associated with the lipid biomarkers in dampness-heat
  induced diarrhea and dampness-heat induced diarrhea with PD treatment. Biomarkers
  in blue are those increased in the control-model. Biomarkers in red are those decreased
  biomarkers in the control-model. The up arrows represent biomarkers which were significantly
  increased after PD treatment. The down arrows represent the biomarkers which were
  significantly decreased after PD treatment. The circles represent biomarkers which
  were not significantly changed after PD treatment.
