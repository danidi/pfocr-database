number: Figure 9
caption: In response to CS and pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as TNFα, NIK phosphorylates
  IKKα, and triggers the IKKα-mediated histone modifications. NIK is accumulated into
  the nucleus and is recruited on the pro-inflammatory gene promoters, resulting in
  increased transcription of NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory genes, though IKKβ is
  not required for this pathway. IKKβ activation leads to translocation of NF-κB dimers
  into the nucleus and bind to κB sites on the promoters, which is independent of
  NIK-IKKα activation. P, phosphorylation; Ac, acetylation.
