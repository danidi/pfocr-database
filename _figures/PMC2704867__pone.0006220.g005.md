caption: 'Several intracellular changes, including down-regulation of PKA-RIIα, PKIγ
  and PTG (green arrows) and up-regulation of t-Darpp (red arrow) work coordinately
  to enhance PKA activity. PKA, in turn, either activates the PI3K/Akt pathway (possibly
  through EGFR or the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K) or promotes sustained phospho-Akt
  levels by activating the PP-1 inhibitory activity of Darpp-32. This activity is
  stimulated via a phosphorylation event at Thr-34, which is absent from t-Darpp.
  A second phosphorylation event, at Thr-75, activates Darpp-32 as a PKA inhibitor.
  We speculate that t-Darpp may interfere with this PKA inhibition via a dominant
  negative mechanism. Dashed lines indicate activities that are down-regulated in
  BT/HerR cells relative to BT474 cells. Question marks indicate hypothetical pathways
  that are activated in BT/HerR cells. All other pathways represent well established
  activities associated with the indicated proteins and enzymes. Abbreviations not
  already cited: PDK1/2, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1/2; Pten, phosphatase
  and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate.'
