caption: 'Overview of pre-miRNA processing. (i) Canonical pre-miRNA processing pathway,
  beginning with DROSHA processing of polycistronic or single miRNA transcripts and
  ending with formation of RISC complex with DICER1-processed mature miRNA. The polycistronic
  pre-miRNA intervening RNA (ppiRNA) and flanking pre-miRNA (fpRNA) products of DROSHA
  processing are further processed into miRNA offset RNA (moRNA) by undetermined mechanisms
  (dashed arrows). (ii and iii) Potential processing pathways involving LIN28A-like
  regulatory factor association: (ii) LIN28A blocks DICER1 uptake and recruits the
  polyuridyltransferase ZCCHC11 leading to 3′ poly(U) tail formation and pre-miRNA
  degradation and (iii) LIN28A or other factor association coinciding with AGO2 association
  leads to AGO2-mediated single-stranded hairpin cleavage followed by repeated polyuridylation
  and exonuclease activity restricted to the −20 nt position by factor binding (iii).
  While the let-7 family is most strongly affected by the process beginning at (iii),
  consistent with the low frequency of 3′ arm-derived let-7* sequences observed in
  miRBase (), a wide range of additional loci are also affected (Supplementary Table
  S5). (iv) The end products of (iii) could either be RNAi-active, capable of binding
  target mRNA sequences, or could regulate pre-miRNA activity by sequestering inactivated
  hairpins. (v) On relatively rare occasions, the pre-miRNA hairpin could be processed
  through polyuridylation and subsequent polyuridylation activity after factor disassociation
  to lengths consistent with DICER1-processed mature sequences (Supplementary Figure
  S19 and S20). (vi) Mirtrons excised from mRNA transcripts via the splicing machinery
  may result in hairpins with 5′ overhangs (Supplementary Figure S13). 3′ polyuridylation
  could provide 3′ overhangs for cytoplasmic export. (vii) Some pre-miRNA loci are
  subject to 5′ cleavage, possibly processed by single-nick DICER1 activity (Supplementary
  Figure S15).'
