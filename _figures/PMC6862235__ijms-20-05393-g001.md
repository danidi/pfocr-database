caption: CNS entry pathways and stages during the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis.
  Bacterial pathogens can cross the BBB or BCSFB paracellularly between neighboring
  cells, in a “Trojan horse” fashion inside infected host macrophages, or transcellularly
  by invading epithelial or endothelial cells. Cellular entry can be launched by the
  zipper mechanism involving binding to host cell receptors or by the trigger mechanism
  (see main text for details). During this process, activation of signal transduction
  pathways can cause initiation of actin rearrangements. Activation of signal transduction
  can also be triggered during the transcellular pathway or the “Trojan horse” mechanism,
  but is not indicated in the figure for reasons of clarity. Once in the cytoplasm,
  the pathogens need to survive inside the cells for further disease progress. Activation
  of host genes causes an inflammatory response that can lead to disruption of tight
  junctions.
