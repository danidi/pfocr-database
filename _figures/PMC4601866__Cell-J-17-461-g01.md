caption: Myogenesis through the IGF/AKT/mTOR pathway. IGF is thought to initiate an
  autocrine signaling cascade through the IGF-I receptor, and IRS 1 and 2 that activate
  PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). PI3K activates AKT, however,
  either PI3K or AKT is sufficient for myoblast differentiation and fusion. PI3K and
  AKT drive differentiation by increasing the transcriptional activity of MyoD and
  activating the mTOR pathway. mTOR expression and activity increases during differentiation
  leading to an increase in the activity of its downstream target, follistatin, which
  prevents myostatin (the most powerful inhibitor of muscle growth) from executing
  its inhibitory effect on muscle development. AKT; RAC-beta serine/threonine-protein
  kinase, ERK1/2; Extracellular-signal-regulated kinases1/2, IGF; Insulin-like growth
  factor, IRS; Insulin receptor substrates, mTOR; Mammalian target of rapamycin, MyoD;
  Myogenic differentiation, PI3K; Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Raf; Rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma and Ras; Rat sarcoma.
