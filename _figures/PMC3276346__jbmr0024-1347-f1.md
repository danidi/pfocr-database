caption: Regulation of osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling by HIF and VEGF. Mature
  osteoblasts located on the bone surface express HIFs and respond to HIF activation,
  which may be induced in response to low oxygen tensions in the bone and marrow environment.
  Cell-autonomous effects of HIF may affect bone formation (osteogenesis), but a critical
  effect of HIF stabilization in mature osteoblasts is the increased accumulation
  of VEGF. VEGF can act through its receptors (VEGFR) on endothelial cells to induce
  angiogenesis and thereby indirectly increase the supply of oxygen and nutrients
  required for osteogenesis. Increased vascularization may also lead to a higher input
  of putative skeletal stem cells and/or (pre)osteoblasts and to elevated levels of
  endothelium-derived osteogenic growth factors or anabolic signals. In addition,
  VEGF can affect osteogenesis through direct interactions with osteoblasts that also
  express VEGF receptors. Altogether, the HIF–VEGF pathway is likely to be critically
  important in coupling the processes of angiogenesis and osteogenesis.
