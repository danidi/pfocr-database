caption: Apoptosis is morphologically characterized by chromatin condensation, cleavage
  of chromosomal DNA into internucleosomal fragments, cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing
  and formation of apoptotic bodies without plasma membrane breakdown. Typically apoptotic
  cells release “find me” and “eat me” signals required for the clearance of the remaining
  corpses by phagocytic cells. At the biochemical level, apoptosis entails the activation
  of caspases, a highly conserved family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific
  proteases. Necrosis is morphologically characterized by vacuolization of the cytoplasm,
  swelling and breakdown of the plasma membrane resulting in an inflammatory reaction
  due to release of cellular contents and pro-inflammatory molecules. Classically,
  necrosis is thought to be the result of pathological insults or be caused by a bio-energetic
  catastrophe, ATP depletion to a level incompatible with cell survival. The biochemistry
  of necrosis is characterized mostly in negative terms by the absence of caspase
  activation, cytochrome c release and DNA oligonucleosomal fragmentation. Autophagy
  is characterized by a massive vacuolization of the cytoplasm. Autophagic cytoplasmic
  degradation requires the formation of a double-membrane structure called the autophagosome,
  which sequesters cytoplasmic components as well as organelles and traffics them
  to the lysosomes. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion results in the degradation of the
  cytoplasmic components by the lysosomal hydrolazes. In adult organisms, autophagy
  functions as a self-digestion pathway promoting cell survival in an adverse environment
  and as a quality control mechanism by removing damaged organelles, toxic metabolites
  or intracellular pathogens.
