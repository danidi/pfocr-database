number: Figure 6
caption: Schematic of the metabolic defects in amino acid biosynthesis of Dehalobacter
  sp. strain CF inferred from genome annotation. THF, tetrahydrofolate; 5,10-MTHF,
  5,10- methylene-tetrahydrofolate. A red X on a pathway means the gene encoding the
  enzyme was not found. The Figure shows that either glycine, cysteine, or serine
  is needed because all other routes for serine biosynthesis are missing.
