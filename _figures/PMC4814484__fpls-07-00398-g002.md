caption: Overview of a proposed model for chloroplast retrograde regulation of heat
  stress responses. Thylakoid membranes are the primary susceptible targets of thermal
  damage in plants. Heat stress induces disturbance on the photosynthetic machinery
  and defects in plastid gene expression (PGE), leading to generation of ROS and accumulation
  of tetrapyrroles such as Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-ProtoIX) and heme. The resulting
  ROS and disturbance of redox homeostasis in chloroplasts could serve as retrograde
  signals to activate downstream signal cascades via GLKs, HY5, or ABI4 in the nucleus.
  Ca2+, sequestered from chloroplasts under heat stress, via calmodulin activates
  calmodulin-binding protein kinase 3 (CBK3) and also activates protein kinase C (PKC),
  which via phosphorylation regulates MAP kinase (MAPK). The stressed chloroplasts
  may sequester Mg-ProtoIX, that binds to HSP90, which can form a complex with ROF1
  (AtFKBP62), a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase. The resulting ROF1-HSP90 complex
  mobilizes into the nucleus with the help of the heat stress transcription factor
  HsfA2, which could allow them to drive the transcription of target genes such as
  HSPs required for establishing cellular heat tolerance. A possible retrograde regulatory
  pathway has also been proposed under heat stress in which PTM, a chloroplast envelope-bound
  plant homeodomain transcription factor, is cleaved during signaling transduction
  and the amino-terminal PTM is transferred into the nucleus, where histone modifications
  to the ABI4 promoter occur.
