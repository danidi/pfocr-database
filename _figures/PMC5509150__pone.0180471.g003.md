caption: 'The initial reaction in the LOX pathway can be carried out by 5-LOX, 12-LOX,
  or 15-LOX, with each LOX synthesizing its own corresponding HpETE. Subsequent reduction
  of these HpETEs generates HETEs. However, 5-HpETE and 15-HpETE can undergo other
  reactions as well. More specially, 5-LOX further metabolizes 5-HpETE to LTA4 that
  serves a precursor for LXs, LTB4, or cysteinyl leukotrienes. 5-LOX can also act
  on 15-HpETE to synthesize LXs. LOX-derived eicosanoids are color coded to indicate
  their effect on tumors. Blue metabolites are anti-tumorigeneic, green metabolites
  are pro-tumorigenic, and gray metabolites are unknown. Abbreviations are as followed:
  arachidonic acid (AA), hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HpETE), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (HETE), leukotriene A4 (LTA4), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and lipoxins (LXs).'
