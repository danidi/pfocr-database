caption: The upregulation of COX-2 is associated with EBV lytic cycle reactivation.
  Inhibition of COX-2 with specific inhibitor NS-398 blocks lytic reactivation. The
  up regulation of COX-2 enzyme results in increased production of the effector molecule
  PGE2 which has autocrine and paracrine action facilitated through EP1, EP2, EP3
  and EP4 receptors. The EP1 and EP4 receptors are also upregulated in response to
  LPS induction and their inhibition directly reduces EBV lytic reactivation suggesting
  their possible involvement in transition from the latent to lytic cycle in response
  to inflammatory signals. Also, PGE2 released from inflamed EBV negative epithelial
  cell can act via a paracrine mode of action and lead to EBV lytic reactivation from
  latently infected cell.
