caption: A developmental model for genetic predisposition to stress susceptibility.
  (A) Stress hormones cause detrimental effects on the brain, such as decreased dendritic
  arborization, reduced density of synaptic spines, and decreased regional brain volumes,
  which are seen in schizophrenia. Stress also activates EGR family immediate early
  genes, which mediate numerous beneficial processes, such as growth factor response,
  vascularization, synaptic protein expression, and synaptic plasticity. The balance
  between these processes protects the brain from damage under stressful conditions.
  (B) Individuals carrying genetic variants that impair the activation of pathway
  proteins may be fine under normal conditions. However, in the context of stress,
  the damaging effects override the insufficient protective response, resulting in
  neurotoxic insults which, if sustained or repeated, may result in the neuropathology
  that gives rise to symptoms of schizophrenia. In this manner, genetic variations
  in genes of the proposed pathway create a predisposition to develop schizophrenia
  in a manner dependent upon the stress history of an individual.
