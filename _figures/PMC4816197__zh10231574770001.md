caption: Signaling schematic depicting our hypothesis of how 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME)
  regulates human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) cell-cycle proliferation. Extracellular
  mitogens activate classical signal transduction pathways that ultimately phosphorylate
  (and thus activate) ERK1/2 and Akt. ERK1/2 is well known to increase expression
  of cyclin D (G1 phase cyclin). Phosphorylated Akt activates a signal transduction
  pathway that stabilizes Skp2, which is the F-box protein of SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase
  that polyubiquitinates p27Kip1 and thus accelerates the degradation of p27Kip1.
  Removal of p27Kip1 deinhibits cyclin D activity. Cyclin D activates cyclin-dependent
  kinase-4 and -6 to hyperphosphorylate retinoblastoma protein (Rb), thus releasing
  the transcription factor E2F and allowing increased expression of downstream cyclins,
  resulting in the progression of the cell cycle toward mitosis. Mitosis requires
  the organization of tubulin to construct the mitotic spindle and achieve proper
  orientation of chromosomes during metaphase and their separation during anaphase.
  Our previous studies show that 2-ME inhibits mitogen-induced phosphorylation of
  both ERK1/2 and Akt and, in addition, inhibits tubulin organization (which blocks
  mitosis). In the current study, we propose yet a third site of action, i.e., inhibition
  of the RhoA/ROCK pathway, which is required for contractile ring function leading
  to cytokinesis. Taken together with our past results, the present study indicates
  that 2-ME blocks cell proliferation by interfering with mitogenesis, mitosis, and
  cytokinesis.
