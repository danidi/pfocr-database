caption: Shown are representative examples of germline piRNA sources and targets originating
  from the 2nd chromosome (drawn at the top). Colored boxes show primary piRNA biogenesis
  from cluster 42AB (yellow), the adaptive module of the target dependent ping-pong
  amplification loop (red), expression and silencing of a typical active LTR-retrotransposon
  (Max-Element; blue) and the contribution of maternally inherited piRNAs (green).
  (yellow box) Cluster 42AB contains transposon fragments in both orientations and
  is bi-directionally transcribed. During primary piRNA biogenesis, cluster transcripts
  (red) presumably generate sense and antisense piRNAs. Unknown mechanisms parse the
  long piRNA precursor transcripts into shorter fragments that are loaded onto PIWI
  family proteins (Piwi, probably Aub and potentially AGO3). Piwi and Aub probably
  select RNA fragments with a 5’ Uridine (1U). Subsequently, the 3’ tail of pre-piRNAs
  are trimmed and 2’OH-methylated to generate mature piRNAs. piRISCs with antisense
  piRNAs are competent to silence sequence complementary transcripts of active transposons.
  Primary piRNA biogenesis in the germline is likely similar to the one in somatic
  cells. The blue box shows an active copy of the Max-Element (LTR-retrotransposon)
  and its transcribed sense transcript that is silenced by complementary piRISCs.
  The red box summarizes the ping-pong cycle. An Aub complexed piRNA (red) that is
  antisense to an active sense Max transcript (dark blue) guides slicing (scissors)
  of the transposon RNA, precisely 10nt downstream of its 5’ Uridine. The sliced Max
  transcript is predicted to be loaded onto AGO3 and typically has a profound bias
  for an Adenine at position 10 (10A). The AGO3 bound pre-piRNA is 3’ trimmed and
  2’-OH methylated. This mature AGO3-piRNA complex in turn cleaves complementary cluster
  transcripts and triggers production of an Aub-loaded antisense piRNA, whose sequence
  is identical to the initiating piRNA. It is currently impossible to experimentally
  distinguish between Aub-piRNA complexes generated via primary piRNA biogenesis or
  via ping-pong. Weak ping-pong signatures exist between AGO3 and Piwi and could indicate
  that Piwi (besides primary biogenesis) also receives piRNAs via AGO3 mediated target
  slicing. (green box) At the end of oogenesis, mature Aub- and Piwi-piRNA complexes
  (to a lesser extent also AGO3) are efficiently loaded into the oocyte. Maternal
  Aub and to a lower extent also Piwi localize to the posterior pole of the mature
  egg, where the future germline will form. Maternal piRNAs might serve important
  roles in the starting phase of the pig-pong cycle.
