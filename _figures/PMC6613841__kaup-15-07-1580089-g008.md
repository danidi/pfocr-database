caption: Schematic diagram of proposed mechanisms underlying the regulation of innate
  immune response by influenza virus H5N1/HM M2 protein. Proton channel activity of
  M2 protein was essential for the increase of Ca2+ entry into cytoplasm from extracellular
  with a subsequent elevation in ROS production. On one hand, the increase level of
  ROS directly or indirectly led to the activation of ATG5 and inhibition of AKT and
  MTOR activity through the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway, thereby triggering M2-induced autophagy
  process. One the other hand, M2 protein anchored to the mitochondria, increased
  the mitochondrial number and accelerated the mitochondria fusion, which resulted
  in increasing ROS-dependent MAVS aggregations. The MAVS aggregates can be packed
  into the autophagosome and be degraded by the lysosomal enzyme in the process of
  autolysosome formation. LC3B and ATG5 interact with MAVS in this process, thereby
  attenuating MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. However, M2 physically interacted
  with MAVS and sequestered the MAVS-ATG5 and MAVS-LC3B complexes formation, thus
  leading to the release of MAVS aggregates from the ATG5-MAVS and LC3B-MAVS complexes.
  Furthermore, M2 protein inhibited the autolysosome formation, which suppressed the
  MAVS aggregates degradation. The released MAVS aggregates from ATG5-MAVS and LC3B-MAVS
  complexes in turn participated in the MAVS-mediated innate immune response, which
  resulted in subsequent amplification of IFN and inflammatory cytokine signaling
  by RLR signaling.
