  MAS/sHLH picture is associated with viral and other infections that does not have
  a special tropism for pulmonary tissues. The hyper-activation of T-cells is associated
  with lymphoid organ hyperplasia with hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy. The resulting
  excessive reticuloendothelial system activity manifests as bone marrow haemophagocytosis
  and deranged liver function tests, deranged lipid profiles as a result of liver
  Kupffer cell dysfunction. Systemically circulating activated macrophages contribute
  to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A similar picture can develop in
  primary HLH that represents a rare group of immunodeficiency, linked to impaired
  cytolytic activity due to perforin pathway loss of function, with expansion of immune
  cells and the lymphoid organs that house them. In primary HLH, cytokine antagonism
  used with anti-microbial therapy may temporarily help prior to definitive bone marrow
  transplantation. Pulmonary involvement may be a feature of both pHLH and sHLH.Panel

  lymphoid tissue and is associated with ARDS development. Pulmonary haemophagocytosis
