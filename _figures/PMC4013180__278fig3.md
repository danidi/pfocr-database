caption: Multiple pathways can stimulate β-cell replication in obesity, and there
  is overlap of many of the downstream activators. GLP-1 signals through the GLPR
  (red arrow) and leads to increased intracellular cAMP, which activates PKA. PKA
  then phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor CREB. Glucose metabolism
  (green arrows) increases cAMP levels and can activate the same pathway. PKA also
  inhibits GSK3-β, which is an activator of the cell cycle inhibitor p27. Glucose
  metabolism (green arrows) results in production of ATP and membrane depolarization,
  which leads to an influx of calcium ions. These calcium ions activate CAMK4, which
  then also phosphorylates and activates CREB. CREB stimulates transcription of IRS-2,
  which then provides IRS-2 protein necessary for insulin signaling. Insulin signals
  through the insulin receptor to phosphorylate and activate IRS-2 (purple arrow),
  leading to activation of PI3K and Akt. Akt inhibits GSK3-β. Akt is also necessary
  to phosphorylate the inhibitory transcription factor FoxO1 and promote its exclusion
  from the nucleus. When FoxO1 inhibition is released, transcription of Pdx1 and other
  genes promoting cell growth can be expressed. GLP-1 signaling can also transactivate
  EGFR (yellow arrow) and lead to activation of PI3K, ultimately signaling through
  the same pathways. HGF signaling through its receptor c-Met also stimulates PI3K
  (orange arrow). Therefore, there is great overlap in the downstream pathways that
  are involved in signaling in response to GLP-1, glucose metabolism, insulin, and
  HGF. The cAMP/PKA, GSK3-β, CREB, and IRS-2/PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 pathways are used by multiple
  upstream mitogenic signals (blue arrows). This overlap suggests that perhaps multiple
  activators must be present to trigger β-cell proliferation physiologically, but
  additionally highlights the challenges of interpreting the importance of 1 upstream
  factor when a downstream target is manipulated experimentally. CAMK4, calcium/calmodulin-dependent
