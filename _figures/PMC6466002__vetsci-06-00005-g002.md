caption: 'Duck RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family signaling pathway. The duck RLR family
  consists of three cytoplasmic receptors: RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. RIG-I and MDA5 detect
  viral RNA species and initiate interferon signaling. LGP2 does not possess a signaling
  domain and may act as a positive or negative regulator of the other two. RIG-I recognizes
  5′-triphosphorylated RNA “panhandle” structures formed by the complementary ends
  of each influenza genome segment. MDA5 recognizes long double-stranded RNA. Ligand
  recognition leads to oligomerization of the receptors and releases the N-terminal
  caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD) domains (shown as yellow rectangles)
  from repression by the C-terminal regulatory domain. Cytoplasmic zinc-finger antiviral
  protein (ZAP) protein may interact directly with RIG-I to stabilize RNA-bound tetramers.
  Short K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains synthesized by tripartite motif-containing
  protein 25 (TRIM25) stabilize the RIG-I CARD domain oligomers, which interact with
  similar CARD domains on mitochondrial MAVS. Duck Riplet appears to be missing its
  catalytic domain and likely cannot synthesize polyubiquitin chains. 2′-5′-oligoadenylate
  synthase-like protein (OASL) may stabilize RIG-I CARD domain oligomers with its
  own C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains in the absence of TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination.
  Activation of MAVS proteins leads them to multimerize in turn, and to serve as an
  assembly platform for a kinase cascade, which terminates in the phosphorylation
  of the transcription factor IRF7. A unique duck TRIM gene, TRIM27-L, promotes RIG-I
  signaling through an undefined interaction downstream of MAVS. Phosphorylated IRF7
  dimerizes and is translocated to the nucleus where it initiates transcription of
  type I and type III interferon and interferon-stimulated genes. The expressed interferon
  is secreted to induce an antiviral state in the neighbouring cells and can also
  amplify RLR signaling in a positive feedback loop, since the pathway components
  are themselves interferon-inducible. RIG-I signaling activates stimulator of interferon
  gene (STING), an adaptor protein involved in sensing DNA viruses, which cross-talks
  with the RIG-I pathway. STING activation, in turn, prolongs the type I IFN response.'
