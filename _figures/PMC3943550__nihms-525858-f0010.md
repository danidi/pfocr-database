caption: A sulfiredoxin (Srx1) in C. neoformans has two-independent roles in oxidative
  stress response and fludioxonil-mediated cell death, both of which are mediated
  by the HOG pathway, consisting of the two-component phosphorelay system containing
  histidine kinases (Tco proteins), a phosphotransfer protein (Ypd1), and a response
  regulator (Ssk1), and the MAPK module containing the Ssk2 MAPKKK, the Pbs2 MAPKK
  (may act as a scaffolding protein), and Hog1 MAPK. In response to peroxide, Tco2
  and other unknown sensors appear to activate the HOG pathway and induce SRX1 expression
  in a dose-dependent manner (). Srx1 is required for recycling of a peroxiredoxin,
  Tsa1, which plays a key role in detoxifying incoming peroxide. The oxidized, sulfenic
  acid (SOH) of Tsa1 is reduced back to the cysteine residue (SH) by the thioredoxin
  system (Trx1). In the absence of Srx1, Tsa1 can be inactivated by hyperoxidation
  upon exposure to high levels of peroxide and eventually degraded, which make cells
  more vulnerable to peroxide stress. Another peroxiredoxin, Tsa3, plays a minor role
  in defending cells against certain oxidants, including superoxide anions and diamide,
  and antifungal drugs. The HOG pathway is involved in peroxide adaptation without
  involvement of Srx1. In response to fludioxonil, which is a phenylpyrrole class
  of fungicide, Tco1 and Tco2 activate the HOG pathway (), which activates expression
  of its target genes, including GPD1 () and HRK1 (), and triggers over-accumulation
  of intracellular glycerol. Upon the increased internal turgor pressure, cells become
  swollen, which causes cytokinesis defect and growth arrest (). In addition, the
  HOG pathway activates expression of SRX1, which promotes cell swelling without controlling
  intracellular glycerol synthesis.
