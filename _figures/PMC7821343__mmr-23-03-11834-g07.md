caption: Tentative hypothesis for the mechanisms via which Cur and GB slows cysts
  development. It was proposed that the cyst structure may be formed as a result of
  central area cell apoptosis mediated by JNK and surrounding area cell proliferation
  mediated by ERFR/ERK, p38 and PI3K/mTOR. Cur is more effective compared with GB
  in inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway, which leads to thick-walled cysts after
  treatment with Cur and thin-walled cysts after GB treatment. Moreover, Cur combined
  with GB induces cysts to form round shaped cell colonies. Cur, curcumin; GB, ginkgolide
  B.
