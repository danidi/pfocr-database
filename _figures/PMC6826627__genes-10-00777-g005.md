caption: The inferred regulatory network of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in
  the chrysanthemum. CmMYB4 and CmMYB5 negatively (marked by green with dashed line)
  regulate the expression of structural genes CmCHS, CmF3H, CmDFR, and CmANS, and
  correspondingly suppress the biosynthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins in the
  chrysanthemum capitulum. On the contrary, the expressions of CmCHS, CmCHI, CmF3H,
  CmDFR, and CmANS are positively regulated by CmMYB6 and CmMYB7 (marked by red with
  full line) and therefore promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins.
