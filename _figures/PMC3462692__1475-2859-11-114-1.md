caption: Schematic diagram showing a putative GSH system and its role in LAB. A putative
  GSH system in LAB is illustrated in the figure. Every component may or may not be
  present in every genus and species of LAB. Genes or proteins whose activity is not
  yet established in LAB are shown with dotted circle. Glutathione (GSH) is made-up
  of three amino acids viz. glutamic acid (E), cysteine (C) and glycine (G). The enzymes
  of glutathione system are γ-glutamylcystiene synthetase (GshA), glutathione synthetase
  (GshB), glutathione bifunctional fusion protein (GshAB/GshF), glutathione reductase
  (GshR/Gor), and glutathione peroxidase (Gpo). GshA catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine
  from glutamic acid and cysteine. Some LAB have only GshA homologs making γ-glutamylcysteine
  as the major thiol. This molecule also serves as antioxidant in some species. The
  classical two step biosynthesis of glutathione is absent and it is carried by bifunctional
  fusion protein GshF in some LAB like S. thermophilus. Some other LAB also have this
  fusion protein. Besides its possible de-novo synthesis, GSH is also imported from
  the medium possibly by CydDC, a heterodimeric ATP-binding cassette type transporter.
  Gpo and GshR are the two main enzymes involved in metabolism of glutathione. Former
  catalyzes the conversion of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized form (GSSG) and
  the latter enzyme regenerates the reduced form. Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs)
  are a class of enzymes which are involved in cellular detoxification of xenobiotics
  (X) using reduced glutathione. The exact cellular role of GST in LAB is not yet
  established. GSH also carries glutathionylation of key proteins of EMP pathway (e.g.
  GAPDH) and helps to maintain ATP production at required levels during stress conditions.
  GSH supplementation upregulates activity of enzymes like β-phophoglucomutase (β-Pgm),
  phosphate acetyltransferase (Pat) etc. during stress conditions []. Both synthesized
  as well as imported GSH is involved in protection of cells from various stress conditions.

  description: Schematic diagram showing a putative GSH system and its role in LAB.
    A putative GSH system in LAB is illustrated in the figure. Every component may
