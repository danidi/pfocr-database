caption: The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT)
  pathway in the fruit fly and the mouse. (A) The D. melanogaster JAK/STAT cytokine
  receptor, Domeless (Dome) is activated upon binding the Unpaired (Upd) cytokines,
  which causes the JAK tyrosine kinase Hopscotch (Hop) to phosphorylate itself and
  the cytoplasmic tail of Dome. The signal-transducer and activator of transcription
  at 92E (Stat92e) bind to the phosphotyrosines on the receptor, and are phosphorylated
  by Hop. Stat92e dissociate from the receptor, dimerize, move to the nucleus, and
  induce the transcription of Thioester-containing protein genes (Teps) and Turandot
  (Tot) stress genes. (B) In Mus musculus, interleukin-6 (IL-6) binds to its receptor
  (IL-6R) and activates the Glycoprotein GP130 via the JAK1/JAK2 kinases. STAT3 activation
  is dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation, which induces dimerization via reciprocal
  phosphotyrosine-SH2 (Src homology domain 2) interaction between two STAT3 molecules.
  Activated STAT3 transcription factors translocate into the nucleus where they bind
  to consensus promoter sequences and cause the transcriptional induction of target
  genes, such as B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1),
  cytochrome c oxidase II (Cox2), ILs [IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, Suppressor of cytokine
  signaling (Socs)].
