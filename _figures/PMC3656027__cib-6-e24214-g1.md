caption: Figure 1. Endosomal trafficking and signaling dysregulation as a potential
  pathogenic mechanism in CMT and other diseases that involve SIMPLE dysfunction.
  (A) Domain structure of SIMPLE and mutations found in CMT1C patients. PSAP, predicted
  TSG101-binding site; PPSY, predicted NEDD4-binding site; C-rich domain, cysteine-rich
  domain; TMD, predicted transmembrane domain. The locations of CMT1C-linked SIMPLE
  mutations are indicated on the domain structure. (B) Potential pathogenic roles
  of SIMPLE dysfunction in CMT, cancer, obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases. Our
  recent work suggests a pathogenic pathway by which CMT1C-linked SIMPLE mutations-
  cause demyelinating peripheral neuropathy by disrupting endosome-to-lysosome trafficking
  and signaling attenuation of NRG1-activated ErbB2/ErbB3 receptors and consequently
  prolonging their signaling to downstream pathways in Schwann cells (colored in pink).
  Downregulation of SIMPLE expression found in several types of cancer- may contribute
  to the process of malignant transformation by impairing endosome-to-lysosome trafficking
  and signaling attenuation of mitogenic signaling receptors (colored in lavender).
  Upregulation of SIMPLE expression found in obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases
  may contribute to the pathogenesis or progression of these diseases by altering
  endosomal trafficking and intracellular signaling (colored in blue).
