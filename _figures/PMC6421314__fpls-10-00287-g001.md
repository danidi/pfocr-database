caption: Relationship between Fe deficiency responses in dicots and responses to pathogens
  (necrotrophs or biotrophs that elicit SAR) or to beneficial microbes that elicit
  ISR. Microbes can produce Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs) or Pathogen-Associated
  Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), like flagellin, that are perceived by PRRs, or other
  elicitors, like Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), or siderophores, that are perceived
  by Rs (some of them unknown). In some cases, microbes themselves can produce hormones,
  like auxin, that are perceived by HRs. After the perception of the eliciting or
  hormonal signals by receptors, there is activation of signaling pathways including
  hormones that lead to the activation of the different responses. In the case of
  Fe, BTS binds Fe (probably a chelated form of Fe) and, in this way, blocks the signaling
  pathway leading to the activation of Fe deficiency responses. In several of these
  pathways (responses to necrotrophs, ISR and Fe deficiency) ET plays a key role.
  Roots can also release different metabolites, like coumarins, that can shape the
  rhizosphere microbiome. In gray are components whose participation in the process
  is not yet clear. BTS (Brutus protein), def. comp. (defensive compounds), ET (Ethylene),
