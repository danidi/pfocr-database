caption: Distribution of Actinidia ESTs in the quinate biosynthetic pathway. Previously
  published sequences in GenBank belonging to the quinate biosynthetic pathway []
  were used to identify genes in the Actinidia EST database. The number of ESTs found
  in the Actinidia EST database for each step of each pathways is shown. Dehydroquinate
  dehydratase and shikimate dehydrogenase are two activities of a single bifunctional
  enzyme encoded by one gene [].
