caption: The β-catenin/TCF pathway is activated at an early stage in colorectal cancer
  by mutations in APC. Subsequently further mutations characterize the progression
  through to aggressive disease. In late stage disease the β-catenin target genes
  snail and snail 2 are elevated and suppress VDR expression. Activation of the innate
  immune response due to infections of the GI tract leads to inflammatory bowel disease.
  Low circulating levels of vitamin D increase susceptibility to pre-cancerous conditions
  such as inflammatory bowel disease. Analogs of vitamin D or β-catenin that direct
  the activation of the non-classical β-catenin-VDR pathway are predicted to act as
  both chemopreventatives and therapeutics at progressive stages of colorectal cancer
  by suppressing both the β-catenin-activated and immune response-mediated intersecting
  pathways.
