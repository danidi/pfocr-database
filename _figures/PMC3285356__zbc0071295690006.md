caption: Schematic presentation of the ROS-DAPK-PKD1-GLUT4 axis as a novel pathway
  involved in contraction-induced glucose but not LCFA uptake. Upon contraction, both
  GLUT4 and CD36 are translocated from intracellular stores to the sarcolemma through
  a vesicle-mediated process. Whereas contraction-induced GLUT4 translocation depends
  on both AMPK and PKD1 activation, contraction-induced CD36 translocation requires
  AMPK, but not PKD1 activation. AMPK and PKD1 are activated upon contraction via
  separate signaling pathways. An increase in the AMP/ATP ratio enables LKB1 to activate
  AMPK. Additionally, AMPK activation is supported by ROS formation. Furthermore,
  increased ROS production and DAPK binding to PKD1 are upstream events for PKD1 activation.
  Remarkably, not only is PKD1 directly activated by a tumor suppressor (i.e. DAPK),
  but also LKB1, the upstream kinase of AMPK, is known to be a tumor suppressor. Hence,
  there is a striking symmetry in AMPK and PKD signaling toward GLUT4 translocation.
  Specifically, inactivation of LKB1 is involved in the development of the Peutz-Jeghers
  syndrome ().
