caption: The schematic cardiolipin biosynthesis and remodeling pathway. CDP-DAG is
  used in the mitochondria to form the metabolic intermediate PG phosphate for the
  synthesis of PG through a dephosphorylation activity. Newly synthesized cardiolipin
  (immature cardiolipin) is formed by the condensation of PG and CDP-DAG. Immature
  cardiolipin is then deacylated to form monolysocardiolipin and then reacylated using
  acyl chains from acyl CoA or the sn-2 acyl chain of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine.
  This remodeling process yields mature cardiolipin.
