caption: The model depicts most identified components of the Drosophila Hpo pathway,
  grouped into modules as discussed in the text. These include the Hpo kinase cassette
  (outlined in green), the Mer-ex complex (outlined in purple), the Fat branch of
  the pathway (outlined in orange), and transcription factors (within nucleus, shaded
  grey). Arrows depict key regulatory connections, pointed arrows show activating
  effects, block arrows show inhibiting effects.
