caption: Upper boxes, up-regulation of genes in the mitochondrial function pathways
  in patients with CAD compared with healthy control subjects. Lower boxes, down-regulation
  of genes in the mitochondrial function pathways following the cardiac rehabilitation
  programme. All genes were differentially expressed in microarray experiments (for
  details see Supplementary Table S4 at http://www.clinsci.org/cs/119/cs1190335add.htm).
  P values and fold changes (FC) in the boxes refer to results from qRT-PCR experiments
  (for details see Figures S1 and S2 at http://www.clinsci.org/cs/119/cs1190335add.htm).
  NDUFA1 and CASP3 are predicted targets of hsa-miR-92a and hsa-miR-92b, whose expression
  was increased following the cardiac rehabilitation programme (see ).
