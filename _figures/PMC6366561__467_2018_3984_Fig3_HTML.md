caption: The role of mtDNA in activating the innate immune response. Ischaemic damage-induced
  loss of membrane potential and mitochondrial swelling can lead to opening of a non-selective
  permeability transition pore (MPTP) in the mitochondrial inner membrane that releases
  mitochondrial molecules, like cytochrome c, ATP, ROS, N-formyl peptides and mtDNA,
  into the cytosol. Released mitochondrial components can act as mitochondrial damage
  associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs). When released, they function as signals
  for injury in cells and activate the innate immune response. MtDNA, due to its similarity
  to bacterial DNA, can activate the TLR9 dependent immune response and in turn stimulate
  activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and therefore expression of the cytokine
  IL-6, which is released from the cell and functions as a stimulus for immune cells.
  In addition, mtDNA is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome that
  senses cytosolic DNA and stimulates the caspase-1-dependent release of IL-1β and
  IL-18. Furthermore, the ER-linked STING pathway can be activated inducing the expression
  of interferon type 1 and its inflammatory signalling pathways
