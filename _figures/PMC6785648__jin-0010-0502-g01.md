caption: Schematic representation of important factors involved in the pathogenicity
  of septic shock caused by LPS from gram-negative bacteria. LPS from gram-negative
  bacteria are recognized by TLR4 on immune cells and activate the transcription of
  genes encoding the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFNα, and IL-8) released
  in the circulation. LPS may reach the cytosol of immune cells (likely mediated by
  an unknown endocytic pathway). LPS is then recognized by inflammatory caspases that
  activate the inflammasome, resulting in the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Proinflammatory
  cytokines activate neutrophils, platelets, and NET formation that generate DAMPs
  (histones, HMGB1, and cell-free DNA). DAMPs are recognized by TLR4 that further
  stimulates a proinflammatory response. Activated platelets and neutrophils lead
  to increases in TF and ROS that contribute to changes in endothelial cells (coagulation
  activation with clot formation, decreases in blood flow, and the upregulation of
  iNOS, ICAM, and VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. There is also upregulation of adhesion
  molecules in leukocytes (selectins and integrins). DAMPs also contribute to these
  effects on endothelial cells by the activation of immune cells, and further release
  of proinflammatory cytokines. Increased vascular permeability, interstitial edema,
  and capillary leakage cause tissue hypoxia that can progress to organ dysfunction
  and death. Intestinal dysfunction occurs mostly by the impairment of intestinal
  tight junctions and apoptosis, which lead to increases in intestinal permeability,
  bacterial translocation, and transcytosis. Anti-inflammatory cytokines that are
  also released into the circulation during sepsis may cause CARS and/or immune suppression.
  Both, in conjunction with the intestinal alterations in sepsis, contribute to increased
  rates of secondary and opportunistic hospital-acquired infections and hospital readmissions,
  factors associated with sepsis-associated late deaths. Alternatively, LPS can be
  sequestered within lipoprotein fractions in a process mediated by lipid transfer
  proteins such as LBP and PLTP. Initially, LPS is transferred to HDL and then from
  HDL to other lipoprotein fractions, such as LDL (again mediated by lipid transfer
  proteins such as LBP, PLTP, CETP, and possibly BPI). LPS within LDL is taken up
  by the LDLR and gets cleared from the body through the bile duct. Major pathways
