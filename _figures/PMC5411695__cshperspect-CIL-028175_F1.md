caption: The backbone of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway. The core of
  the Hh signaling pathway is conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates. In the
  absence of ligand, the Hh receptor Patched (PTCH1) keeps the pathway off by inhibiting
  the activity of the seven transmembrane-domain protein Smoothened (SMO). When SMO
  is inactive, the GLI/Ci (glioblastoma/Cubitus interruptus) transcription factors
  are proteolytically processed to make a transcriptional repressor that binds to
  Hh target genes and blocks their transcription. Binding of Hh to PTCH1 inhibits
  its activity, relieving the repression of SMO, which promotes conversion of full-length
  GLI/Ci into a transcriptional activator. In vertebrates, cilia are required for
  the production of both GLI-repressor and GLI-activator.
