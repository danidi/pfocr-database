caption: Yellow boxes indicate key sphingolipids and fatty acyl CoAs (FACs) included
  in our model. Two circles, DHCs and PHCs, represent distinct species of dihydroceramide
  and phytoceramide, respectively. The reversibility of reactions is indicated by
  thick, double-headed arrows, which are accompanied by thin unidirectional arrows
  and the names of the catalyzing enzymes. Details specifically associated with ceramides
  are given in . The overall pathway shown here is a simplification of sphingolipid
  metabolism, which we have discussed and modeled elsewhere in great detail [, ].
