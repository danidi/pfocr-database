caption: These images represent the evolving picture of medicine that is driving the
  development of nanotechnologies for the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment
  of cancer. (a) A mammogram exemplifies traditional, phenomenological, single-parameter
  cancer diagnostic techniques. (b) The “cancer pathways” model for understanding
  the differential response of certain cancers to molecular therapies. Each pathway
  is comprised of a cascade of interacting proteins (circled in yellow). Genetic mutation
  of a protein within a pathway can lead to cancer. Identifying which pathway is altered
  typically involves the analysis of multiple mRNAs and proteins from the cancerous
  tissue. If the altered pathway is correctly diagnosed, then that information can
  lead to the appropriate prescription of drugs. (c) A dynamic network model of disease.
  This model, compared to the cancer pathways model, more accurately reflects the
  complex interrelationships between various proteins within a biological system.
  It is thus a truer reflection of the molecular nature of the disease, but it also
  can be mined for biomarkers that can be diagnostic for the progression of the disease.
  Such biomarkers can potentially be harnessed for detecting disease prior to the
  emergence of clinical symptoms (dynamic network model images courtesy of Leroy Hood.
