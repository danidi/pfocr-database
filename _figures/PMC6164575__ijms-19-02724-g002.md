caption: 'Structure and functions of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4). NG2/CSPG4
  is a type 1 transmembrane protein composed of (1) an extensive 2225-residue N-terminal
  ectodomain (amino acids 1–2221), (2) a small 25-residue transmembrane domain (amino
  acids 2222–2246), and (3) a short 76-residue C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (amino
  acids 2247–2322). The extracellular ectodomain can be further divided into three
  subdomains: domain 1 (D1), domain 2 (D2), and domain 3 (D3). D1 is a N-terminal
  globular domain (amino acids 1–640) stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds
  and containing two laminin G-type motifs (L1 and L2) involved in the ligand binding
  at the extracellular matrix (ECM). D2 is a central large domain (amino acids 641–1590),
  containing 15 CSPG repeats that are the attachment sites for the chondroitin sulfate
  chains, collagens II, V and VI. D2 interacts with integrins and ECM proteins, and
  binds and presents growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases. D3 is a globular
  juxtamembrane domain (D3, amino acids 1591–2221) containing N-linked oligosaccharides
  that bind galectin-3 and α3β1 integrin, and putative protease cleavage sites of
  NG2/CSPG4, leading to its shedding from the cell surface. The cytoplasmic tail,
  rich in proline and threonine residues, interacts with different proteins and functions
  as a phosphoacceptor site for the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2),
  respectively. The PDZ domain is implicated in protein scaffolding functions. NG2/CSPG4
  is, thus, implicated in cellular signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway, through the receptor tyrosine kinase-ERK1/2 axis and the
  focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway, through the ECM–fibronectin–integrin axis.
  All may promote migration, proliferation, survival, and cytoskeletal reorganization,
  resulting in enhanced motility, invasiveness, and angiogenesis.'
