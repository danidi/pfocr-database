caption: The Notch pathway. Binding of the extracellular domain of the Notch receptor
  to Delta and Serrate/Jagged/LAG-2 (DSL) ligand on an adjacent cell induces a conformational
  change in Notch that exposes an extracellular ADAM10/TACE cleavage site. A subsequent
  intramembranous proteolytic cleavage by γ-secretase, releases the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus. NICD complexes with coactivators
  (CoA) and Mastermind (Mam) to replace corepressors (CoR) that occupy CBF1/Su(H)/LAG-1
  (CSL)-bound Notch target gene promotors. An important group of target genes is the
  Hairy/enhancer of split (Hes) genes. Hes inhibits the expression of achaete-scute
  genes such as Ascl1 (Mash1) in cells receiving Notch signals. In cells not receiving
  Notch signals, Mash1 is expressed, which up-regulates the expression of Notch ligands
  (DSL).
