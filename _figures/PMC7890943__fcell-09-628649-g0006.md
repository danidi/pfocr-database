caption: A schematic representation of the proposed mechanism by which Y217N mutation
  in PATL2 impairs oocyte meiotic process. The mutation p.Y217N in PATL2 decreased
  its ubiquitination level and led to its abnormal accumulation. Then, increased PATL2
  repressed translational activity of Mos and impaired oocyte meiotic maturation.
  Addition of the activator of subsequent MAPK signaling partially rescued the impairment
  of meiotic maturation in PATL2 mutated oocytes. Further, it was speculated that
  some other mechanisms still remained in defect oocyte maturation influenced by PATL2
  mutation.
