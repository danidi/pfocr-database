caption: 'Generation of ROS as a result of incident radiation affecting the mitochondrion.Notes:
  ROS have been shown to form oxidative DNA adducts, such as 8-OHdG, which in turn
  can lead to base modifications and transversions, such as GC to TA. Any strand break
  would ensue the activation of a repair pathway via the repair kinases ATM or ATR.Abbreviations:
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; OHdG, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine.'
