caption: Schematic presentation of the single biosynthetic pathway starting with cholesterol
  and leading to progesterone, its metabolites, and their main signaling mechanisms.
  Enzymes are shown as numbers in italics next to the arrows indicating metabolic
  steps. Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone inside the steroidogenic mitochondria
  by cytochrome P450scc (1). Carbons are numbered as shown. Pregnenolone is then converted
  to progesterone by the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (2) and progesterone to
  5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP) by the 5α-reductases (3). Both progesterone and
  5α-DHP bind to intracellular PRs, which regulate gene transcription inside the nucleus,
  but also interact with membrane-associated kinases in extranuclear compartments.
  The conversion of 5α-DHP to 3α,5α-THP (allopregnanolone) by the 3α-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase (4) is a reversible reaction. In contrast to progesterone and 5α-DHP,
  3α,5α-THP does not bind to PR, but is a positive modulator of GABAA receptors. The
  interconversion of 20-keto-pregnanes to 20α-hydroxy-pregnanes, considered as biologically
  inactive, is also reversible and catalyzed by a 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (5).
