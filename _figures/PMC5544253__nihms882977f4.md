caption: (A) Venn diagram showing significant overlap of gene sets that are stress-induced
  and JQ1-suppressed across the TAC and MI models (χ2 < 0.001). A common set of 193
  genes was identified as being shared targets of BET bromodomain inhibition (gene
  list is provided in ). (B) Gene ontology analysis using DAVID for the Venn overlap
  genes shown in (A). A false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 was considered statistically
  significant. (C and D) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The common gene set was analyzed
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. These analyses revealed two dominant signaling networks
  that were highly enriched in the set of genes suppressed by JQ1. (C) A large TGF-β
  network (P < 1.0 × 10−76). Each target gene is shown in red, with the darkness of
  red shading designating the relative degree of inhibition by JQ1 of that particular
  gene. Although the legend includes a green color scale for JQ1–up-regulated genes,
  there are no green-shaded genes on this diagram because all genes were selected
  a priori to be those that are suppressed by JQ1. TGFB1 as a central node gene is
  shown in orange. (D) JQ1 suppressed genes enriched for a network of innate immune
  signaling nodes with strong convergence on NFκB transcriptional responses (P < 1.0
  × 10−48). Keys for the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis color shading and line formatting
  schemes are provided in the figure.

    The common gene set was analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. These analyses
    revealed two dominant signaling networks that were highly enriched in the set
    of genes suppressed by JQ1. (C) A large TGF-β network (P < 1.0 × 10−76). Each

    relative degree of inhibition by JQ1 of that particular gene. Although the legend
    includes a green color scale for JQ1–up-regulated genes, there are no green-shaded
    genes on this diagram because all genes were selected a priori to be those that
    are suppressed by JQ1. TGFB1 as a central node gene is shown in orange. (D) JQ1
    suppressed genes enriched for a network of innate immune signaling nodes with
    strong convergence on NFκB transcriptional responses (P < 1.0 × 10−48). Keys for
