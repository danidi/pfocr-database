caption: Model of the signaling pathway of EpCAM complex proteins in the regulation
  and enhancement of OSKM-mediated pluripotency reprogramming. EpCAM and OSKM are
  able to cross-regulate the expression of each other and form a positive feedback
  loop to enhance the reprogramming efficiency. Step 1, exogenous OSKM factors activate
  the expression of endogenous OSKM genes, and EpCAM as well as Cldn7. Step 2, EpCAM
  and Cldn7 are transported to plasma membrane and associate with other members of
  the complex. Step 3, EpCAM is cleaved by Psen2 and Adam17 to relieve EpICD, which
  is subsequently transported into the nucleus. Step 4, EpICD forms a complex with
  other proteins to directly or indirectly enhance the expression of endogenous OSKM
  genes, such as Oct4 and c-Myc; on the other hand, EpICD-containing complex may down-regulate
  the expression of p53 and its downstream genes, such as p21. It has been shown that
  p53 can bind the promoter of EpCAM and inhibit its activity (). Therefore, EpICD
  can positively regulate its own expression. Red lines, findings in this study; dashed
  lines and question marks, a possible but unproved effect.
