caption: PD-1 blockade could result in the “in situ” expansion of tumor-specific T
  cell clones already within the tumor microenvironment (left). This expansion and
  activation is largely driven by PD-L1– and PD-L2–expressing dendritic cells in the
  tumor. Tumor-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) may represent naïve
  T cells or T cells that have already been “primed” to tumor antigen () before PD-1
  pathway blockade. In addition, tumor antigen–containing DCs originating in the tumor
  pick up tumor antigens and traffic to the tumor-draining lymph nodes, where they
  present antigens either ineffectively or in a tolerogenic fashion to tumor-specific
  T cells. PD-1 blockade could act at this point, enhancing productive stimulation
  of tumor-specific T cells or partially reversing tolerance induction. Activated
  T cells enter the circulation by way of efferent lymphatics and then egress into
  tissues.
