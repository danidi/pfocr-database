caption: 'Redding’s summary of RT and/or chemotherapy (CT)-induced oral mucositis
  pathobiology (). Redding has summarized the pathobiology phases of radiation-induced
  oral mucositis induced by RT and/or CT. In brief, initiation phase with RT and/or
  CT results in direct and lethal DNA damage, which leads to release of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) from epithelial, vascular endothelial, fibroblasts, and tissue macrophages
  with cycles of amplifications. Within such primary damage response, the DNA damage
  and ROS lead to three major steps: (1) fibronectin breakdown that activates macrophages
  ending with stimulation of matrix metalloproteinase; (2) nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  activation that stimulates the gene expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  e.g., TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6; and (3) ceramide pathway through sphingomyelinase
  and ceramide synthase. The result will be more tissue injury and stimulated apoptosis.
  During the signal amplification phase, there is restimulation of tissue damage and
  apoptosis by the major pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), NF-κB-mediated
  gene expression, and ceramide and caspase pathways. During the ulceration and loss
  of the protective barrier, secondary infection adds more pro-inflammatory reactions
  and complicates the already existing inflammation before the healing phase starts
  by matrix signaling to basal epithelial cells to migrate, proliferate, and differentiate.
