caption: 'The binding of ligand to a receptor leads to the recruitment and activation
  of an IKK complex which phosphorylates IkB-α leading to degradation by the proteasome.
  NF-kB then translocates to the nucleus to activate target genes regulated by kB
  sites, such as that of IL-12 p40. I-152, reducing intracellular GSH, may inhibit
  the enzymatic activity of IKK complex by glutathionylation; as a consequence IkB-α
  degradation and NF-kB nuclear translocation are inhibited as well. GSH-C4, increasing
  intracellular GSH, may maintain in a reduced state the cysteine located in the DNA-binding
  loop so favouring and prolonging NF-kB DNA binding. SCF: SCF complex, Skp, Cullin,
  F-box containing complex: multi-protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.'
