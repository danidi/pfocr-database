caption: (a) The positive feedback loop is formed by miR-192, MDM2 and p53. (b) The
  positive feedback loop is formed by miR-34a and p53, mediated by SIRT1 or YY1 plus
  MDM2. (c) The positive feedback loop is formed by miR-29a and p53, mediated by CDC42,
  Wip1, or Wip1 plus MDM2. Note that blue arrows represent activation while the red
  lines with a hammerhead represent inhibition. Note that the inhibition and activation
  signs here indicate the regulatory role of a regulator on its target. That is, if
  the regulation is of an activating (or inhibitory) nature, we use an activation
  (or inhibition) sign.
