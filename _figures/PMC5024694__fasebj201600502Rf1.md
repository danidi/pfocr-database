caption: Simplified model of the canonical Wnt pathway and inhibitors. The Wnt–β-catenin
  pathway consists of secreted glycoproteins (WNT ligands) and Frizzled family of
  transmembrane receptors or LRP5/6 transmembrane receptors. In the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) of WNT producing cells, the membrane bound O-acyltransferase, Porcupine, acylates
  the WNT protein. This lipid modification is necessary for secretion of the WNT ligand.
  The secreted WNT ligand can be sequestered by secreted Frizzled-related protein
  (sFRP) family of secreted proteins to prevent Wnt ligand binding to receptors. DKK1,
  another secreted Wnt inhibitor prevents binding of WNT ligand to LRP5/6 receptors.
  In the absence of extracellular WNT glycoproteins, a destruction complex—including
  the proteins APC, GSK3β, CK1α, and AXIN—phosphorylates β-catenin, targeting it for
  ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. When WNTs bind to the Frizzled and LRP5/6
  coreceptors, Disheveled helps phosphorylate and sequester AXIN to the LRP5/6 receptor,
  causing disassociation of the β-catenin degradation complex. The stabilized β-catenin
  enters the nucleus, binds to the TCF family of transcription factors and activates
  transcription of target genes. Distinct coactivators of transcription such as CBP,
  the E1A-associated protein p300, Pygopus (PYGO), BCL-9, and Brahma-related gene
  1 (BRG1) are involved in the transcription of specific target genes. Independent
  of TCF, β-catenin can also associate with the FOXO family of transcription factors
  to activate transcription of genes primarily involved in aging. In the cytoplasm,
  inhibition of GSK3β activity by WNT ligand binding can simultaneously activate mTOR
  complex 1 signaling, which results in mRNA translation into proteins. Inhibitors
  of the pathway and their respective targets are shown in red font on yellow tabs
  and are further described in .
