caption: Map depicting the pathway of metabolites in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), and glutathione pathway in cultured MKN45 cells under normoxic and
  hypoxic (1% O2 and 5% CO2) conditions. Cells (at 80% confluence) were incubated
  for 24 hours under normoxia and hypoxia and subjected to metabolomic analyses. White
  and dark gray boxes represent the relative ratio of metabolite concentrations under
  normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. The graph represents enhanced lactic acid, mitigated
  reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and reduced
  glutathione (GSH) under hypoxia. Error bars represent SD (n = 3). P < .05 indicates
  statistical significance and is represented as ⋆.
