caption: Two current models of Hh signaling. A, one-complex model. B, two-complex
  model. See text for details. PM, plasma membrane; VM, vesicular membranes; MT, microtubules;
  and HSC, Hedgehog signaling complex consisting of Fu, Cos2, and Ci. The various
  activities of components are indicated by color (red, repressor; green, activator),
  and CiACT refers to a highly activated state. Sufu (not depicted) is predicted to
  be cytosolic by these models.
