caption: Role of fructose in lipogenesis. Glyceraldehyde-3-P continues downstream
  in the glycolysis pathway forming pyruvate which enters the mitochondria and is
  further metabolized to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase. Acetyl-CoA enters the
  citric acid cycle by combining with oxaloacetate to form citrate. In the well fed
  state, citrate can be transported to the cytosol, providing CoA necessary for lipogenesis.
