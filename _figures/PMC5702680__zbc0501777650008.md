caption: Proposed schematic representation showing mechanism of action of carbofuran
  and its effect on neurogenesis. On the basis of our experimental studies, we found
  that carbofuran induces TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Binding of TGF-β ligands with TGF-βRII
  recruits and phosphorylates TGF-βRI, forming a heterotetrameric complex. Activated
  TGF-βRI causes phosphorylation of SMAD-2/3, which binds with SMAD-4, forming a complex.
  This complex translocates to the nucleus, which binds to transcription promoters/co-factors
  and acts as a transcription factor for the regulation of genes involved in NSC proliferation
  and differentiation and apoptosis. SMAD-7 acts as inhibitory SMAD, which inhibits
  the phosphorylation of SMAD-2/3 by binding with TGF-βRI. Carbofuran activates TGF-β/SMAD
  signaling in neural progenitors due to an elevation in the level of TGF-β1 in the
  neurogenic niche of the hippocampus. It leads to an increase in phosphorylation
  of SMAD-2/3 and a decrease in levels of SMAD-7, resulting in up-regulation of the
  TGF-β pathway. The blockage of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling (through SMAD-3 siRNA and
  SB431542) reversed carbofuran-mediated inhibition of NSC proliferation, neuronal
  differentiation, and cognitive deficits.
