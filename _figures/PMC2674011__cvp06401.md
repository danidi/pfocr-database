caption: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-mediated regulation of vascular tone. The figure
  shows a schematic representation of how stimulation of the vascular wall with S1P
  may lead to modulation of vascular tone. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) express
  sphingosine kinases (SphK) that catalyse ATP-dependent phosphorylation of sphingosine
  (Sph) to produce S1P. S1P phosphatases dephosphorylate S1P back into sphingosine.
  Endothelial cells actively produce and release S1P into blood stream and appear
  to represent a major source of S1P in vivo, with red blood cells, and to a lesser
  extent, blood platelets also producing significant quantities of S1P. S1P metabolized
  by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may modulate vascular tone as well. In blood,
  S1P is highly protein-bound and can be found in lipid–protein complexes with high-density
  lipoproteins (HDLs) or serum albumin. S1P binds to and activates S1P receptors expressed
  on endothelial cell surface, including S1P1 as well as S1P3 receptor subtypes. In
  other cell types, S1P has been found also to have intracellular sites of action,
  but cell surface receptors appear to modulate the principal responses to S1P in
  vascular cells. Ligand binding of endothelial cell S1P receptors modulates numerous
  downstream effect or molecules as summarized in the main text, under the control
  of the small GTP-binding cytoskeleton signalling protein Rac1. These S1P receptor-activated
  signalling events can lead to the activation of the endothelial isoform of nitric
  oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to the synthesis of the important vascular messenger
  molecule nitric oxide (NO). Endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide diffuses to vascular
  smooth muscle cells, where it binds with and activates the soluble isoform of guanylate
  cyclase (sGC), which in turn produces the messenger molecule cGMP. cGMP is the key
  determinant of the vasorelaxation responses evoked by S1P actions in the endothelium.
  In contrast, S1P is also able to bind with and activate S1P receptors expressed
  on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells, including the S1P2 as well as S1P3
  receptor subtypes. In vascular smooth muscle cells, ligand binding of S1P receptors
  leads to the activation of the small G-protein RhoA and its effector molecules,
  including Rho-associated protein kinase (ROK), as well as some isoforms of protein
  kinase C (PKC). Activation of the RhoA/ROK/PKC pathway by vascular smooth muscle
  cells S1P receptors ultimately leads to vasoconstriction responses by mechanisms
  summarized in the main text. Thus, the overall effects of S1P of blood vessels in
  regulation of vascular tone take place in a highly context-dependent manner based
  on the balance responses modulated by endothelial cells vs. vascular smooth muscle
  cells, and the differential roles of Rac1/NO/cGMP vs. RhoA/ROK/PKC pathways. The
  effects of S1P on vascular tone can vary significantly between different vascular
  beds and different animal species; key experimental variables can influence S1P-mediated
  vascular responses, as vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation responses can be importantly
  affected by the S1P concentrations being studied, the specific S1P receptor subtype
  expression profiles present under different conditions, as well as other factors.
