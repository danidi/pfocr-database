caption: WFS1 is a key element of the ER stress activated signalling cascade, called
  the unfolded protein response (UPR). WFS1 regulates ATF6 protein through the ubiquitin-proteasone
  pathway, stabilizing and enhancing the function of its E3 ligase, HRD1 and acts
  as a negative regulator of this pathway. The E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 is found in
  the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated
  degradation. In response to ER stress, the cleaved form of ATF6 translocates to
  the nucleus. The non-cleaved form of ATF6 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway to prevent the hyperactivation of the UPR.
