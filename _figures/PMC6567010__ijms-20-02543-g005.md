caption: Gene net correlated to JA, ABA and other hormone biosynthetic, signaling
  and response pathway under water stress. The key elements of pathway are displayed
  in web-like network and are connected by arrows. A previously established link among
  IAA, ABA, Ethylene, CTK and cell elongation and growth is indicated. The red and
  overstriking words represent differentially expressed genes induced by COR in microarray.
  Arrows and t-bars represent positive and negative effects, respectively. Solid lines
  indicate effects that occur through direct interaction, whereas dotted lines indicate
  effects that have not yet been shown to occur through direct interaction.
