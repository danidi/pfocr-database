caption: The TOL metabolic and regulatory network drawn using SBOL Visual 2. (a) Structure
  of the TOL network of Pseudomonas putida with focus on the two master regulators,
  XylR and XylS, along with their cognate expression (Pr:XylR and Ps:XylS) and activation
  (m-xylene and 3MBz) systems. Modules are used to abstract away specifics of the
  upper and meta pathways. (b) Detail of meta pathway where the XylS’ target, promoter
  Pm, is explicitly drawn. Pm’s downstream operon is abstracted using a composite
  glyph. (c) Regulatory circuit from Goni-Moreno et al. inserted into the chromosome
  (at the attTn7 site) using components of the TOL network. For all panels, structural
  formulae of small molecules (i.e., m-xylene, 3MBz and acetate) do not follow SBOL
  Visual glyphs.
