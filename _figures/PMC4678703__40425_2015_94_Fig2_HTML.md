caption: Potential mechanism of combinatory synergism between three methods of immune
  checkpoint blockade. PD-1 or CTLA4 signaling inhibits proliferation of effector
  T cells. In addition, some studies have suggested that Tregs are also partly activated
  by PD-1 or CTLA4 signaling []. IDO signaling induces tumor immune tolerance by both
  suppressing effector T cells and activating Tregs. Therefore, if PD-1 or CTLA-4
  signaling blockade is combined with an IDO inhibitor, effector T cells may be further
  activated and Tregs may be further suppressed. The result could be more effective
  reversal of immune tolerance and enhanced anti-tumor immune response. APC, antigen-presenting
  cell; PD-1, programmed cell death-1; PD-L1, programmed cell death-ligand 1; CTLA4,
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4; B7-1/2, peripheral membrane proteins
  found on activated APCs
