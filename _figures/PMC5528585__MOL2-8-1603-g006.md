caption: A simplified model for the effect of ATM inhibitor on GICs which have limited
  NHEJ repair. Post‐surgical radiotherapy triggers ATM and DNA‐PKcs activation during
  early DNA DSB responses and initiates a signalling cascade. While NPC relies primarily
  NHEJ to repair DNA DSB, GICs employ HR through ATM activation. The presence of ATMi
  renders G2‐checkpoint activation ineffective and prevents HR repair in GICs. Whilst
  allowing NPCs to compensate through NHEJ repair. GICs relatively low NHEJ activity
  prevents them from DNA DSB repair compensation. Consequently the ATMi treatment
  results in the increased cell death of GICs.
