caption: The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. In response to DNA double-strand breaks
  (DSBs), ATM and related PIKKs (phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related protein kinases)
  phosphorylate H2AX (γH2AX), creating a platform for the assembly of DDR proteins.
  Localization of MDC1 to sites of damage by binding to γH2AX and its subsequent phosphorylation
  by ATM are required for the recruitment of the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF8. RNF8, with
  the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and HERC2, synthesizes K63-linked ubiquitin
  on histone H2A and its variants. RNF168, another RING (Really Interesting New Gene)
  domain ubiquitin ligase, recognizes the ubiquitin conjugates synthesized by RNF8/Ubc13,
  leading to its recruitment to sites of damage and to further synthesis of K63-linked
  ubiquitin. RAP80 (Receptor Associated Protein 80) specifically binds to K63-linked
  ubiquitin, recruiting a protein complex including Abraxas, MERIT40, BRCC36, BRCC45,
  and BRCA1 to sites of damage.
