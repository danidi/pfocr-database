caption: 'The complement-induced inflammation pathway: an important mediator of neuroinflammatory
  processes from M4 onwards. This functional network was designed using the text-mining
  software, PredictSearch, based on more stringent criteria than for the above figure:
  only upregulated DEGs (with a FC > 1.5) found in both the cortex and hippocampus
  and at consecutive time points (M4/M6; M6/M9 or M4/M6/M9) were considered for analysis.
