caption: Observe that Pitx2 insufficiency leads deregulation of Zfhx3 and Wnt signaling,
  which subsequently leads to microRNA and ROS signaling deregulation and thus ion
  channel impairment. In HTD but not in HTN, Pitx2>Wnt>ROS signaling is also impaired.
  Furthermore, in vitro gain- and loss-of-function analyses (brown arrows) further
  support a complex retroactive gene regulatory network.
