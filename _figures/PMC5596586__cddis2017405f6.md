caption: Diagram showing the mechanisms of CHAC2. The downregulated CHAC2 can be degraded
  by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in gastric and colorectal cancers. CHAC2 induces
  UPR and promotes the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by releasing cyto c which further
  activates caspase-dependent signaling. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded
  protein response

papertitle: CHAC2, downregulated in gastric and colorectal cancers, acted as a tumor
  suppressor inducing apoptosis and autophagy through unfolded protein response.
