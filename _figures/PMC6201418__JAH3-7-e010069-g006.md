caption: VPO1 signaling in vascular smooth muscle cell. VPO1 modulates vascular smooth
  muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic switch through H2O2/VPO1/HOCl/ERK1/2 signaling pathway,
  which characterized by downregulation of SMC differentiation markers, such as SM‐22α,
  α‐SMA as well as an increase in migration. AAA indicates abdominal aortic aneurysm;
  HOCl, hypochlorous acid; KLF4, Krüppel‐like factor 4; p, phosphorylated; MMP‐2,
  matrix metalloproteinase‐2.
