caption: 'Targeting the interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway. IL-17RC and IL-17RA
  are subunits of the IL-17 receptor, which is present on various cell types including
  keratinocytes, dendritic cells, dermal fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Secukinumab,
  a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig)G1κ monoclonal antibody, and ixekizumab, a humanized
  IgG4 monoclonal antibody, target the cytokine IL-17A. These agents prevent inflammatory-mediated
  effects by neutralizing IL-17 and therefore inhibit the binding of IL-17A to its
  receptor. Brodalumab is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-17RA,
  thereby blocking signaling of IL-17 via its receptor. Another agent, RG7624, is
  a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against both IL-17A and IL-17F. All four
  agents are in clinical development for the treatment of psoriasis, with secukinumab
  and ixekizumab being the furthest along (–). Reprinted by permission from Macmillan
