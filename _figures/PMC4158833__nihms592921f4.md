caption: 'The establishment of PCP across the organ of Corti requires a three-tiered
  regulation: (1) upstream factors for directional information along the mediolateral
  axis of the cochlea; (2) core PCP proteins form polarized complexes along the mediolateral
  axis of the cochlea; (3) unknown cellular mediators link polarized core PCP complexes
  to the machinery that builds the “V”-shaped stereocilia in individual hair cells
  and orient the vertices of the “V”-shaped stereocilia toward the periphery of the
  spiraling cochlea, establishing uniformly oriented stereocilia across the organ
  of Corti. The identity and the role of the upstream factors were hypothesized; and
  the role of Pk and Ankrd6/Diversin in inner ear was hypothesized based on their
  role in PCP signaling in Drosophila and in CE in zebrafish. Several core PCP proteins
  are observed at the boundaries between supporting cells and between hair cells and
  supporting cells in a polarized manner along the mediolateral axis of the cochlea.
  Their localization to one or both cells at the boundaries has not been determined
  unequivocally.'
