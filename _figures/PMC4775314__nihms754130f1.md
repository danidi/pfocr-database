caption: Schematic displays the fundamental principles that govern signal transduction
  within the tyrosine-based (left) and G protein-based (right) signaling pathways.
  Within each pathway, signals are triggered, propagated or terminated by an independent
  set of ‘writers’, ‘readers’ and ‘erasers’, respectively. The unusual coexistence
  of a GEF motif (which triggers G protein signaling) and a SH2-like domain (which
  propagates tyrosine-based signals) in GIV’s C-terminus allows GIV to trigger G protein
  signaling in response to tyrosine-based signals. The schematic on the right is adapted
  after significant modification from Pincus D., et al. ().
