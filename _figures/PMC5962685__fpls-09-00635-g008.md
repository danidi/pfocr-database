caption: Regulation manners among ALA metabolic pathway of cucumber under NaCl stress.
  The metabolic pathway downstream of ALA in higher plants can mainly fall into Fe-branch
  and Mg-branch, for heme biosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis, respectively.
  Results showed that (1) Fe-branch was enhanced under salt stress to form more heme,
  this could be conjectured as an adaptive or against response in plants; (2) The
  accumulation of heme under stress condition feed-back inhibited the biosynthesis
  and metabolic of endogenous ALA; (3) Application of exogenous ALA under stress enhanced
  the Mg-branch to produce more chlorophyll and kept the Fe-branch enhanced at the
  same time.
