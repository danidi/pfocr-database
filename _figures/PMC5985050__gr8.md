caption: 'Proposed mechanisms by which PPARβ/δ regulates VLDLR levels and hepatic
  steatosis.Pparβ/δ deficiency may result in an increase in VLDLR levels and hepatic
  steatosis through several mechanisms. The activation of HRI caused by Pparβ/δ deficiency
  (reference ) and by activators of this kinase (BTdCPU) may increase the levels of
  VLDLR through the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway. ER stress can also activate the eIF2α-ATF4
  pathway leading to an increase in the expression of VLDLR and FGF21. This hormone
  suppresses the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway through a negative feedback mechanism and thereby
  it also regulates the levels of VLDLR. ER stress also enhances the activity of Nrf2,
  a transcription factor reported to upregulate the expression of Fgf21 (reference
  ). Fructose feeding increases the levels of ROS and the activity of Nrf2 providing
  a mechanism for the increase of the levels of VLDLR. All these mechanisms may result
  in an increase in the levels of VLDLR causing hepatic steatosis. TG: triglyceride.'
