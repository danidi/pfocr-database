caption: 'A proposed revised model of mammalian DNA damage response. We hypothesize
  that there are two separate pathways involved in the recruitment and accumulation
  of DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins at DSBs. One of them is the H2AX-independent
  pathway, which requires the MRN complex and probably limits the localization of
  these checkpoint and repair proteins at or closer to sites of DNA breaks. We speculate
  that this pathway is mainly geared toward DNA repair but also initiates ATM activation
  and cell cycle checkpoint. The second pathway is the well studied H2AX-dependent
  pathway, which allows the accumulation of DNA repair proteins and the spreading
  of DNA damage signaling proteins to larger chromatin regions surrounding the damaged
  sites. This H2AX-dependent pathway carries out at least two functions: one is to
  facilitate DNA repair, and the other is to promote the amplification of DNA damage
  signals, which lead to a full checkpoint activation and allow time for the completion
  of DNA repair.'
