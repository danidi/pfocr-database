caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the specific cascade and signalling pathway
  in LPS-primed macrophages stimulated with nanoparticles. LPS priming induces transcription
  of pro-IL-1β gene upon activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (1). Nanoparticle
  uptake (2) leads to the active release of intracellular ATP (3) through pannexin/connexin
  hemichannels (4). This extracellular ATP (eATP) may activate ATP-gated P2X7 receptor
  (P2X7) to amplify ATP release in a P2X7-dependent way (5). ATP or its derived catabolism
  products act through on other P1 or P2 (P2X and P2Y) purinergic receptors. In particular,
  ATP via P2Y2 and ADP through P2Y1 activate PLC-β, which promotes NLRP3 inflammasome
  via modulation of cellular Ca2+ and K+ flux (6). Adenosine (Ado), another hydrolysed
  product of ATP, activates P1 receptors (A2A, A2B and A3) leading to NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation (7). After NLRP3 receptor activation via signalling through multiple
  purinergic receptors, NLRP3 inflammasome builds up and matures pro-IL-1β (9) into
  IL-1β, which is secreted by macrophages (10). In case of extracellular Ado accumulation,
  equilibrative nucleotide transporters (ENTs) regulate adenosine through its cellular
  reuptake, which may be inhibited by the ENT inhibitors MBMPR and/or 5-Iodotubercidin
  (a). Metabolisation of intracellular Ado into ATP by adenosine kinase (AK) renews
  ATP stock (b) and may be inhibited by the AK inhibitor 5-Iodotubercidin. Increased
  intracellular ATP contents may lead to ATP release (4), NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  (9) and IL-1β secretion (10)
