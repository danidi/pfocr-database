caption: Proposed model for hypertrophy induced by Herpud1 silencing. Herpud1 plays
  a role in the regulation of Ca2+ levels in cardiomyocytes, possibly by modulating
  IP3R degradation. Reduction in Herpud1 protein levels allows for activation of pro-hypertrophic
  signaling cascades such as the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. This new evidence suggests
  an alternative model for the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and
  a novel putative pharmacological treatment target.
