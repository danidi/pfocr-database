caption: The Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-IR) is a transmembrane protein composed
  of two alpha (α) and two beta (β) subunits. The conventional view was that the IGF-IR
  was exclusively a tyrosine kinase receptor and that the binding of IGF-I to the
  IGF-IR started the intracellular downstream signal cascade. In this model IGF-I
  or IGF-II binding to the IGF-IR promotes tyrosine kinase activity and autophosporylation
  of the beta subunit of the IGF-IR. Intracellularly the activated IGF-IR receptor
  recruits phosphorylated substrates Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) and SH2 containing
  collagen-related proteins (SHC). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRSs and SHC proteins
  induces downstream signaling activation through the PI3K-AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk
  pathways. It was further thought that activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway had predominantly
  metabolic effects whereas activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway had predominantly
  mitogenic effects.
