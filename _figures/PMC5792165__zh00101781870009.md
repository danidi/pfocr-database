caption: Proposed signaling pathway between TRPC6 activation and TRPC5 externalization.
  Ca2+ entry through TRPC6 activates a kinase, leading to ERK phosphorylation. ERK
  then phosphorylates p47phox, leading to NADPH oxidase activation and production
  of ROS, which contribute to the phosphorylation of MLCK that is required for externalization
  of TRPC5. The components of this process may be localized in a “signalsome” of the
  plasma membrane (PM).
