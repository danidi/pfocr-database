caption: The glycolytic intermediate 3-phophoglycerate (3-PG) is metabolized to serine
  in a three-step pathway where the first step is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which can be inhibited by NCT-503 and CBR-5884. Serine metabolism
  to glycine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) transfers a one carbon unit
  to tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form N5,N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF). CH2-THF
  is the methyl donor for thymidine nucleotides, or it can be converted to N10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate
  (CHO-THF) for purine biosynthesis or to N5-methyl-THF (CH3-THF) to support methionine
  production and numerous methylation reactions via the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)
  cycle.
