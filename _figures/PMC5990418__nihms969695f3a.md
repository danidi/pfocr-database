caption: When stress stimuli induce the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, the Bak or
  Bax members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family are activated to promote apoptosis.
  However, activation of the PI3K pathway promotes cell survival by preventing steps
  in the apoptosis pathway. PI3K activation leads to conversion of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3). This
  step is also negatively regulated by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The
  conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 leads to the activation of Akt protein. Akt can inhibit
  the forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) transcription factor from translocating into
  the nucleus to induce pro-apoptotic target genes, preventing apoptosis. Additionally,
  Akt inhibits the pro-apoptotic protein Bad from inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
  members like Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which in turn is inhibited from activating Bak or
  Bax thereby also preventing apoptosis.A) Pathways leading to cell survival. Anti-apoptotic
  HIV proteins (shown in red) expressed early in the virus life cycle that can promote
  cell survival include Nef, Tat and Vpr. Nef can bind PI3K proteins to increase the
  conversion of PIP2 to PIP3. This leads to an increase in Akt protein that subsequently
  leads to inhibition of pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bad from activating apoptosis
  thereby promoting cell survival. Additionally, Nef can prevent p53 from activating
  the pro-apoptotic molecule PUMA which directly inhibits Bcl-2 to prevent apoptosis.
  HIV Tat protein can inhibit PTEN, thereby promoting the PI3K/Akt pathway to promote
  cell survival. Tat can also directly inhibit FOXO1 transcription factors to prevent
  the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, preventing apoptosis. Tat also prevents
  the pro-apoptotic molecule PUMA from inhibiting Bcl-2. HIV Vpr can lead to the increase
  of anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in addition to inhibiting the pro-apoptotic Bak
  molecule.B) Pathways leading to cell death. When activated, Bax proteins form pores
  in the mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome C and second
  mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) into the cytosol. Cytosolic cytochrome
  C leads to the formation of the apoptosome that activates caspase-9. Caspase-9 then
  cleaves pro-caspase -3, -7 into their active caspase-3 and caspase-7 forms, which
  lead to apoptosis. Multiple HIV proteins (shown in green) can interact with the
  members of the apoptosis pathway later in the viral life cycle, leading to increased
  apoptosis. Nef can inhibit both the anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Higher
  expression of HIV Vpr can bind and lead to the upregulation of Bak to initiate apoptosis.
  Higher expression of Tat also leads to the upregulation of Bax, resulting in the
  release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria and subsequent activation of the caspase
  cascade. HIV Env protein can inhibit the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 to favour
  apoptosis. The HIV protease protein also cleaves caspase-8 to the pro-apoptotic
  Casp8p41 peptide to promote apoptosis. It is likely that the balance of pro-apoptotic
  versus anti-apoptotic cellular and viral proteins decide the fate of infected cells.C)
  Modulation of apoptosis pathways using compounds. Compounds (in light blue) that
  act on different cellular proteins in these pathways could potentially be used to
  tip the balance toward apoptosis of HIV infected cells. PI3K inhibitors block the
  conversion of PIP2 to PIP3, decreasing active Akt within a cell to stop Akt from
  inhibiting apoptosis. Akt inhibitors directly decrease active Akt to prevent Akt
  from inhibiting apoptosis to ultimately induce apoptosis. Bcl-2 inhibitors such
  as Venetoclax inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 to sensitize the cells towards apoptosis.
  Smac mimetics competitively bind inhibitors of apoptosis proteins like X-linked
  inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) to promote apoptosis. Retinoic acid-inducible gene
  I (RIG-1) detects viral RNA as well as activating pro-apoptotic Bak/Bax proteins,
  leading to apoptosis. In addition to viral RNA, RIG-1 inducer compounds like the
  retinoic acid derivative acitretin can also trigger apoptosis.
