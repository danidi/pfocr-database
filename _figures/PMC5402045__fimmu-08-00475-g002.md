caption: ST2/IL-33 signaling pathway. IL-33 either binds to the ST2/IL-1 receptor
  accessory protein (IL-1RAP) heterodimer, recruiting MyD88 to its intracellular domain,
  or the sST2 decoy receptor, which does not signal. MyD88 binding recruits IL-1R-associated
  kinase (IRAK) and TRAF6, leading to either the NF-κB or AP-1 pathway being activated.
  NF-κB and AP-1 activations promote inflammatory cytokine expressions. On regulatory
  T cells (Tregs), ST2/IL-33 signaling has been shown to promote Foxp3 and GATA3 expressions,
  while also promoting Treg function and expansion through enhancing TGF-β1-mediated
  differentiation though a p38-dependent mechanism. It has recently been shown that
  IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 1, which can be activated through MyD88 signaling, can
  inhibit Tregs by binding to the Foxp3 promoter and preventing Foxp3 transcription.
