caption: Collaborative effects between pRb family proteins and p53 in invasive urothelial
  tumorigenesis. a Ablation of pRb specifically in urothelium leads to E2F1 over-expression
  which in turn up-regulates the p53 pathway and pRb family protein p107 along with
  transcriptional repressor E2F4. These compensatory urothelial defenses cause urothelial
  cells to undergo cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. b Additional ablation of p53 in
  urothelial cells lacking pRb effectively blunted apoptotic response, resulting in
  late-onset hyperplasia and nuclear atypia. c Treatment of urothelial cells lacking
  both pRb and p53 with bladder carcinogen BBN down-regulates p107 and triggers invasive
  urothelial tumorigenesis. This model emphasizes the collaborative effects among
  pRb family proteins and p53 in invasive urothelial tumor initiation. This figure
