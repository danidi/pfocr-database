caption: 'Summary of factor H recognition functions and interactions. Briefly, factor
  H is essential for fluid phase alternative pathway complement control, as well as
  for protection of host cells. Normal recognition of cell surfaces is required for
  effective protection. Thus, mutations and polymorphisms in factor H can result in
  inadequate protection and disease. Unwanted protection from factor H can result
  from efficient binding to certain pathogens and cancer cells. Interaction of factor
  H with other molecules is also shown. Abbreviations: AP, alternative pathway; fH,
  factor H; MPGN II/DDD, dense deposit disease; ARMD, age-related macular degeneration;
  aHUS, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.'
