caption: The diagram of rGal3C regulating NDRG1 through integrin/FAK/SRC pathway.
  rGal3C binds to the extracellular integrin, thereby resulting in the destruction
  of integrin clustering. Disintegrated integrin cannot induce phosphorylation of
  FAK/SRC to forming transient FAK-SRC signaling complex, and this may result in decreased
  expression of NDRG1 and attenuated migration and invasion of HCC.
