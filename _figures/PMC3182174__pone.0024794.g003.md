caption: 'The model integrates findings on protein abundance from the low strain control
  bees and metabolic connections described in the literature (see text for details).
  Plus sign: higher abundance in 9-day-old vs 11-day-old bees. Minus sign: lower abundance
  in 9-day-old vs 11-day-old bees. Solid arrows: enzyme (shown in orange) showed age-dependent
  abundance differences. Dashed arrows: no evidence found in the present data but
  connections are supported by vertebrate studies. The model proposes a shift from
  lipogenesis to lipid degradation and higher oxidative phosphorylation with increasing
  age. SDH: sorbitol dehydrogenase; ADH: alcohol dehydrogenase; DHAkinase: dihydroxyacetone
