caption: We postulate that inhibition of Pyk2 activity increases ERα degradation via
  the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, which leads to an increase in ERK signaling and
  OB proliferation, and consequently promotes OB differentiation and mineralization
  activity. E2-stimulation, most likely acting through ERβ, has an additive effect
  on ERK signaling, which further promotes OB activity, leading to an increase in
  bone formation.
