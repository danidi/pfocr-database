caption: 'The core components of the MAPK signaling pathway. The MAPK pathway transduces
  signals from external stimuli (e.g. when testicular cells are exposed to environmental
  toxicants, such as cadmium, or cytokines, such as TGF-β3) to cells (e.g. Sertoli
  and/or germ cells) so that appropriate physiological responses can occur. When induced
  by external stimuli, as shown in the left-hand box, there is a sequential activation
  of MAP4Ks and MAP3Ks (e.g. MEKK, TAO, Mos, Raf); see the right-hand box, which shows
  examples of members of the MAPK cascade and some commonly used inhibitors. Phosphorylated
  MAP3Ks will activate MAP2Ks (e.g. MEK4/7, MEK3/6, MEK1/2, MEK5). Upon activation
  by MAP3Ks, dual-specificity MAP2Ks (e.g. MEK4/7, MEK3/6, MEK1/2, MEK5) will in turn
  activate MAPKs (e.g. JNK1–3, p38 MAPKα–δ, ERK1/2, ERK5) directly through phosphorylation
  of both a Tyr and a Ser or Thr residue. Different stimuli affect different components
  of the MAPK pathway, and different effectors of MAPK will be activated for different
  physiological responses. Some of the commonly used inhibitors that block specific
  MAPKs are shown. Inhibitors that are shown in red are used mostly for basic research
  because their therapeutic developments were not continued due to undesirable side
  effects. The chemical names of the inhibitors listed are as follows: SP600125, anthra[1–9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one;
  SB202190, 4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]phenol; SB203580,
