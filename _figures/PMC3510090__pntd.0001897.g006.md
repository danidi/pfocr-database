caption: '). Aerobic pathways are indicated by black arrows and anaerobic pathways
  by red lines; enzymes or pathways found in the E. granulosus transcriptome are in
  yellow and additional components identified in E. multilocularis, in grey ; end
  products of fermentation routes are in black with white letters (acetate and propionate
  are also marked because they have been observed as excreted end products of E. granulosus
  metabolism ; although enzymes for their generation were not found in our dataset).
  Mitochondrial fermentation via malate dismutation branches out from glycolysis at
  the level of PEP, which is converted into oxalacetate and the latter into malate.
  In the mitochondria, malate is dismutated to pyruvate and succinate, a conversion
  first catalyzed by the TCA enzyme fumarase, and then by the membrane-associated
  fumarate reductase. This is an electron transport-complex, which oxidizes rhodoquinol
  to rhodoquinone; the latter is recycled to rhodoquinol by complex I. Since fumarate,
  which is the final electron acceptor, is generated endogenously, the whole pathway
  is fermentative, although it is sometimes considered as anaerobic respiration. It
  produces 4–5 mol ATP/mol glucose (depending on whether succinate is further catabolyzed
  to propionate), more energy than that obtained from glycolysis (2 mol ATP/mol glucose).
  If aerobic glycolysis was also involved in energy production, some pyruvate would
  enter the TCA cycle, whereas a majority would be converted to lactate, thus generating
  ∼4 mol ATP/mol glucose . Abbreviations: AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; ASCT acetate:succinate
  CoA-transferase; C, cytochrome c; CI-IV, complexes I to IV of the respiratory chain;
