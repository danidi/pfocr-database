caption: Taurocholate, cAMP and AICAR enhanced ABCB11 trafficking to the canalicular
  membrane of hepatocytes. Canalicular delivery of ABCB11 was greatly reduced in the
  LKB1-decficient cell. The accelerating effects of taurocholate and AICAR were prevented
  by the disruption of LKB1. In contrast, addition of cAMP augmented ABCB11 trafficking
  even in the LKB1-deficient cells. Activation of Epac by CTP-cAMP also led to enhanced
  canalicular trafficking, however, its effect was LKB1-dependent. Specific activation
  of PKA by 6-Bnz-cAMP results in increased canalicular trafficking of ABCB11 independently
  of LKB1. The accelerating effect of cAMP was blocked by specific inhibition of PKA
  in LKB1-deficient cells, suggesting a PKA-dependent regulatory pathway in control
  of ABCB11 trafficking. PP2C – Protein phosphatase 2C, the major phosphatase dephosphorylating
  phospho-AMPK.
