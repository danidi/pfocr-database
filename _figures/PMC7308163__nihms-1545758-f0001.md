caption: (A) MCTRs biosynthetic pathway. Healthy and diseased lung tissues were extracted
  and lipid mediators along with internal standards for quantitation. Representative
  MS/MS spectra of MCTR1 (B), MCTR2 (C), and MCTR3 (D) (m/z, mass/charge ratio) identified
  using characteristic diagnostic ions.
