caption: Overview of autophagy process, apoptosis process and the site of action of
  sauchinone. Autophagy process starts with energy depletion which leads to the activation
  of AMPK which is modulated by liver kinase B1 (LKB1), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) and transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 (TAK1).
  AMPK stimulates p27 gene that manufactures autophagy proteins, also inhibits mTORC1
  (inhibitor of autophagy related protein 13) and activation of Beclin-1 through modulations
  of ULk1, ATG 13 and FIP200. Similarly Hypoxia promotes Beclin-1 and PI3K class III
  interaction that leads to induction of phagopohre, a building block of autophagosome.
  This interaction is also promoted by increased Ca2+ and ROS. Similarly RTK coupled
  activation of Grb2/SOS leads to activation in succession of Ras, Raf, MEK, MAPK
  and finally ERK1/2 which subsequently leads to regulation of DNA and synthesis of
  proteins as well as new cell turnover. These proteins are used for phagophore synthesis.
  Then by series of steps involving many mediator proteins, phagophore elongates and
  engulfs target organelles. After which the fully formed autophagosome transports
  the cargo upto the lysosome where fusion of its membrane with lysosomal membrane
  occurs with subsequent release of lysosomal degradative enzymes and breakdown of
  autophagosome as well as the contents into simpler sugars, fatty acids, amino acids
  and constitutive proteins, all of which are recycled back. Simultaneously, hypoxia
  and ischemia activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis with generation and activation
  of different proteins like Bax, Bak, Bcl-xl, Bcl-2. Bax after activation increases
  mitochondrial outer wall permeability with release of cytochrome c and subsequent
  activation of caspase 9 that ultimately activates caspase 3, the final effector
  of apoptosis. Also the extrinsic pathway can activate caspase 3 through activation
  of caspase 8. [Note-Red arrows and black arrows are the site of stimulatory and
  inhibitory actions respectively, Green arrows are the flow of reaction, red blunt
  arrow are the inhibitory pathway].
