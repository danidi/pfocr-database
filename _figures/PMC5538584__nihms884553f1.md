caption: Post-replication repair pathways that operate in gap-filling. A. Homologous
  recombination is initiated by RecFOR promoted RecA binding to ssDNA gaps. The RecA
  filament on ssDNA signals induction of the SOS DNA damage response and initiates
  strand invasion of the gap with the duplex DNA of the sister chromosome. Resolution
  of a double Holliday junction by RuvABC restores an intact chromosome. B. Translesion
  synthesis involving the exchange of Pol II, IV or V for the replicative Pol III
  polymerase can fill gaps, especially those caused by template lesions. C. A cross-fork
  template switch pathway can provide an alternative template for nascent strands.
  Due to mispairing of nascent strands in the annealing step, this pathway can lead
  to RecA-independent rearrangements between tandem direct repeats. This mechanism
  can also lead to crossovers between sister chromosome (see ).
