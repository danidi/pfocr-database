caption: Proposed VEGF-C/D cell signaling pathway to transduce LAM cell proliferation.
  After VEGF-R3 binding and activation, Akt is phosphorylated and as is in turn mTOR,
  which by itself or through S6, induces cell proliferation. TSC2 does not appear
  to have a significant inhibitory effect on VEGF-R3 signaling but does play a modulatory
  role, and Akt may also have a direct modulatory effect on TSC2. Erk is also used
  by VEGF-R3 to induce LAM proliferation. LDC-LEC cross talk serves as an activating
  mechanism for LAM-VEGF-R3 through autocrine production of VEGF-C/D. The potential
  mechanisms of LDC-LEC cross talk resulting in release of VEGF-C from LDC include
  soluble factor production and/or cell-cell contact.
