caption: Multiple interactions among the components involved in floral signal transduction
  in response to sugar-hormone interplay. Components of the pathways are grouped into
  those that promote (↓) and those that repress (⊥) floral signal transduction. Sugars
  affect the vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition through their function as
  energy sources, osmotic regulators, signaling molecules, and by their interaction
  with mineral and phytohormone networks (Ohto et al., ; Lloyd and Zakhleniuk, ; Matsoukas
  et al., ). Starch metabolism-related events have a key role in developmental phase
  transitions (Corbesier et al., ; Matsoukas et al., ). The actions of all pathways
  ultimately converge to control the expression of a small number of so-called floral
  pathway integrators (FPIs), which include FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT; Kardailsky et al.,
  ; Kobayashi et al., ) and SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1; Yoo et al., ). These act
  on floral meristem identity (FMI) genes such as LEAFY (LFY; Lee et al., ) and APETALA1
  (AP1; Wigge et al., ; Yamaguchi et al., ), which result in floral induction. The
  main components and interactions are depicted in the diagram, but additional elements
  have been omitted for clarity. Comprehensive reviews are available (Smeekens et
  al., ; Depuydt and Hardtke, ; Huijser and Schmid, ; Andres and Coupland, ; Matsoukas
  et al., ) and should be referred to for additional pieces of information.
