caption: Based on the data accrued in the current studies we propose that incubation
  of isolated β-cells to either PA [but not oleate] or C2-CER [but not DHC] leads
  to Tiam1-mediated activation of Rac1, which is a key member of the NOX assembly.
  In addition, PA or C2-CER promotes the expression of p47phox in these cells. Together,
  these signaling steps promote the assembly and activation of NOX holoenzyme leading
  to the production of superoxides and lipid peroxides. These, in turn, exert damaging
  effects on the mitochondria including reduction in MMP leading to the onset of mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Appropriate sites of inhibition of these signaling steps by FB-1, NSC23766
  and DPI are also indicated in the figure.
