caption: a. Illustration of dewetting transitions. A liquid deposited on a surface
  can wet completely the surface and form a liquid film on top of it. The liquid can
  dewet and form a drop with a contact angle with the substrate. Wetting is controlled
  by surface tension.b. Model for spontaneous budding of a TG droplet from a bilayer
  based on dewetting transition. Accumulation of TG inside a bilayer can lead to spontaneous
  emulsification of a TG drop in a low-surface tension environment. The expulsion
  of the TG LD corresponds to a dewetting state that is energetically favored. Different
  surface lipids can modulate such process.c. Origins of different LD populations.
  Evidence suggests that two populations of basic LDs exist. Smaller LDs bud from
  the ER (e.g., from the enzymatic products of ER enzymes such as DGAT1). Such LDs
  pathway has a characteristic size that likely depends on the surface surfactants.
  A second population of cytosolic LDs, called expanding LDs, acquires enzymes of
  the GPAT4/DGAT2 TG synthesis pathway. These enzymes can locally synthesize TG at
  the LD from local substrates.
