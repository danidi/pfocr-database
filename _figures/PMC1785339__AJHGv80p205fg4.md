caption: Human and mouse mutations and the cognitive disorders affecting specific
  NRC/MASC signaling pathways and other postsynaptic proteins. The NMDA receptor subunits
  (NR1 and NR2) are linked to MAGUK proteins (SAP102 and PSD-95) that bind SynGAP,
  which regulates the Ras-ERK-RSK pathway. This pathway regulates transcription (e.g.,
  CREB), cell adhesion (via L1CAM), and AMPA receptors. MAGUKs, including DLG3/SAP102,
  coordinate the postsynaptic signaling response to NMDA receptor (NR1 and NR2) activation.
  The MAP kinase pathway is an important limb of this response, leading to changes
  in transcription factors such as RSK2, which, in turn, send feedback to modify AMPA
  receptor function and thus produce synaptic plasticity. Note that FMRP, encoded
  by the FMR1 gene, does not belong to this complex but is involved in the regulation
  of PSD-95 translation via mGluR activation. Note that the NRC/MASC–associated signaling
  pathway is involved in MRX as well as MRXS. The molecules are shaded in yellow if
  there is a known mouse mutation that results in cognitive dysfunction, and red letters
  indicate if mutation is in a human gene.
