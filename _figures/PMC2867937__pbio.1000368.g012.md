caption: The NB 5–6 lineage is generated in all CNS segments, but the genetic pathway
  leading to Ap cluster formation is only triggered in the NB 5-6T lineages. Three
  separate mechanisms act to ensure this segment-specific event. In abdominal segments,
  the Pbx/Meis genes hth and exd act with Bx-C Hox genes to truncate the NB 5-6A lineage
  by triggering neuroblast cell cycle exit within an early temporal (Pdm) window.
  This occurs prior to generation of Ap cluster cells, and prior to progression into
  the Cas/Grh late temporal window. In thoracic segments, the absence of Bx-C expression
  in the NB 5-6T neuroblast allows it to progress further and generate a larger lineage,
  thereby generating the Ap cluster cells. Importantly, this also allows for the lineage
  to progress into the Cas/Grh late temporal window. Combined with the expression
  of the thoracic Hox gene Antp, and increasing levels of Hth, this allows for integration
  of anteroposterior and temporal cues and the specification of Ap cluster cells into
  Ap cluster neurons, primarily by the activation of the critical Ap cluster determinant
  col. Grh plays a postmitotic role in specifying the Ap4/FMRFa cell fate. In anterior
  segments, the NB 5–6 lineage, although varying in size when compared to thoracic
  segments, does contain a Cas window. However, the absence of Antp expression, coupled
  with weak or absent expression of the late temporal gene grh, prevents specification
  of Ap cluster neurons.
