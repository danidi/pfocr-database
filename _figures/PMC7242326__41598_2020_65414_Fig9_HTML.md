caption: Summary of the role of AHR ligands in blocking TGFβ induced collagen deposition
  and myofibroblast formation in Thyroid eye disease. TGFβ signaling induces collagen
  1 expression and myofibroblast formation in orbital fibroblasts. However, in the
  presence of an AHR ligand like FICZ, AHR binds to its ligand and then translocates
  to the nucleus. There, it heterodimerizes with its binding partner, ARNT. This complex
  activates transcription of the interstitial collagenase, MMP1. MMP1 is secreted
  into the extracellular matrix and degrades fibrous collagen in the extracellular
  space of the orbit.
