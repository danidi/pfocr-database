caption: . Scheme of melanocyte-induced proliferation, migration and differentiation
  through GLI1 activation. In the human vitiligo skin, bulge-specific genes GJB6,
  THBS1, TNC, and FZD7 (blue shapes) are expressed in the melanocyte precursors in
  the bulge at similar levels before () and after NBUVB-treatment (). These genes
  are proposed to be involved in cellular adhesion and in maintaining stemness in
  the bulge melanocyte precursors through β-catenin signaling. Epidermal melanocytes
  are absent in the interfollicular epidermis (IE) of untreated vitiligo skin, illustrated
  by the decreased height of all triangles, and their absence in the IE in . In contrast,
  TYR (brown triangles) is expressed at low levels in both untreated and NBUVB-treated
  bulge melanocyte precursors, and is expressed at significantly higher levels in
  the regenerated epidermal melanocytes of NBUVB-treated vitiligo skin, indicating
  active melanogenesis. GLI1 expression (red triangles) is significantly higher in
  the NBUVB-treated bulge melanocytes of vitiligo skin compared to untreated vitiligo
  skin, suggesting a role for GLI1 in the repigmentation process. We identified SOX9
  constitutively expressed by the melanocytes precursors in the human bulge of normal
  and vitiligo skin (). Activation of FZD7 (a Wnt receptor) was associated with reduced
  phosphorylation of β-catenin and its nuclear accumulation (). Gli1 can induce the
  accumulation of transcriptionally active β-catenin in cell nuclei (). β-catenin
  can enhance the transcriptional activity of GLI1 (; ; ). GLI1 induction in the bulge
  melanocyte and keratinocyte precursors by NBUVB is supposedly influenced by nuclear
  translocation of β-catenin, and by interaction with SOX9, with a shift in the balance
  of maintaining stemness to greater differentiation, proliferation, and migration.
  Cross-talk activation between β-catenin and GLI1 under NBUVB. β-catenin can enhance
  the transcriptional activity of GLI1 () likely through regulation of the β-catenin
  key downstream targets, IGF2BP1 (CRD-BP) and myc (). Once activated by β-catenin,
  IGF2BP1 and myc can activate GLI1 likely by binding to the GLI1 mRNA coding region
  (; ). GLI1 also regulates β-catenin at the transcription level, through its targets,
  SNAIL, WNT, and SFRP1 (). GLI1 can induce SNAIL expression which then interacts
  with β-catenin and stimulates its expression activity at transcription level (),
  and at protein level (). SFRP1 and Wnt have opposite effects on β-catenin signaling,
  as a negative feedback, or as a control mechanism after GLI1 induction, to prevent
  over-activation of WNT/β-catenin pathway. SFRP1 is a melanocyte stem gene that we
  identified upregulated in the bulge of NBVUB-treated vitiligo skin and normal skin
  ().Experimental evidence used for this figure was generated in either human models,
  or Gli1 transgenic mice, or on in vitro experiments performed on rat kidney cells,
  murine LLC-11 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, human stomach, colon, and lung cancer
