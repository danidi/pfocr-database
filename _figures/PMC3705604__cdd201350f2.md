caption: Glycans and glycan-binding proteins are integral components of the autophagy
  and apoptosis machineries. Interaction of galectins with various intracellular proteins
  either in a glycan-dependent or -independent manner may control cell death in diverse
  subcellular compartments. In tBid- or LND-treated mitochondria, as well as in untreated
  mitochondria, intracellular galectin-3 and galectin-7 form heterodimers with Bcl-2,
  which modulate cellular apoptosis. Galectin-7–Bcl-2 complex promotes release of
  cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO factors, facilitating the intrinsic death pathway.
  In contrast, endogenous galectin-8 is a cytoprotective intermediate protein that
  restrains Salmonella proliferation and inflammation by neutralizing bacteria-damaged
  SCV in human host cells. Host galectin-8 binds glycans expressed on the SCV, recruits
  and forms complexes with NDP52 and LC3, which lead to encapsulating SCV into an
  autophagosome. Finally, the unwanted cargo is degraded in the lysosome. It is not
  clear whether galectin-8 binds to N-glycans or to O-glycans of the SCV. The cargo
  proteins, mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) in the ER and hydrolase α-mannosidase,
  as well as accumulation of N-glycans in the ER are involved in cell death. Whereas
  EDEM facilitates the removal of envelope glycoprotein of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected
  cells in an autophagy-dependent manner, the absence of the phosphatase PTP-1B impairs
  EDEM transcription and suppresses apoptosis. Defective mannose-6 phosphate targeting
  mechanism impairs transportation of α-mannosidase and of many glycan-metabolizing
  enzymes from the secretory pathway to the lysosome. Such impairment causes the accumulation
  of polyubiquitinylated protein aggregates and LC3-II and unchanged expression of
  Beclin-1, which together inhibit autophagy. Golgi architecture protein GMAP210 has
  been also involved in cell death signaling programs. Deficiency of this protein
  promotes ER stress accompanied by abnormal glycosylation, accumulation of perlican
  in the Golgi and cell death. Whether intermediates of Golgi glycosylation are involved
  in cell death is still not clear. tBid, truncated Bcl-2 homology-3 (BH3)-interacting
  domain death agonist; LND, lonidamine; Smac/DIABLO, second-mitochondria-derived
  activator of caspases; SCV, Salmonella-containing vacuole; EDEM, ER degradation-enhancing
  α-mannosidase-like protein; PTP-1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; GMAP210, Golgi-associated
  microtubule-binding protein 210
