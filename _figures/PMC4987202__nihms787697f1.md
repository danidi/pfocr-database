caption: Axotomy activates the Wallerian degeneration pathway for the selective elimination
  and degeneration of severed axons. This mechanism of axon degeneration occurs in
  response to the physical severing of axons from their cell bodies. Wallerian degeneration
  occurs independently of NGF signaling and the presence of NGF is illustrated in
  this context only for contrast with the axon apoptosis and axon pruning pathways.
