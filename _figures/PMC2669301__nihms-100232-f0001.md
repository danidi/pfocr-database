caption: Antigen-induced aggregation of IgE-occupied FcεRI induces activation of the
  Src family tyrosine kinase, Lyn, whereas SCF-induced KIT dimerization induces activation
  of its intrinsic KIT kinase activation. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within
  the receptor chains thus allows recruitment of SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules.
  In the case of FcεRI, Syk is recruited via ITAMs contained in the γ chain-cytoplasmic
  domains. Resulting activation of Syk, following its phosphorylation, leads to consequential
  phosphorylation of the transmembrane adapter molecules LAT1 and LAT2 (NTAL/LAB).
  Upon phosphorylation, these proteins serve as scaffolds for multimolecular signaling
  complexes comprising various cytosolic adaptor molecules such as Gads, Grb2, SLP76,
  and SHC, GTP exchangers including Sos and Vav1 and the signaling enzymes PLCγ1 and
  PLCγ2. PLCγ catalyzes the hydrolysis of PtdIns2 to yield diacylglycerol (DAG) and
  IP3, which, respectively, result in the activation of PKC and the liberation of
  intracellular calcium. Following depletion of the intracellular calcium stores,
  the calcium signal is maintained by store operated calcium entry (not depicted).
  These signals lead to mast cell degranulation and eicosanoid generation and also
  contribute to activation of transcription factors required for cytokine and chemokine
  production. In parallel to this pathway, PI3K is activated following binding to
  Gab2 upon the phosphorylation of this cytosolic adapter molecule by Fyn and/or Syk,
  phosphorylation of the p85α adapter subunit of PI3K, and activation of the catalytic
  subunit by small GTP-binding proteins. In the case of KIT, the p85α subunit directly
  binds to the phosphorylated molecule. The subsequent formation of membrane associated
  PtdInsP3 results in the recruitment of PH domain-containing signaling molecules
  such as Btk, PLD, and potentially others. PI3K-regulated pathways serve to enhance/maintain
  LAT/PLCγ1-regulated degranulation and, as depicted for KIT, regulate mast cell growth,
  differentiation, survival, migration, adhesion, and cytokine production. KIT- and
  FcεRI-mediated activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway following Sos- and Vav-regulated
  GDP-GTP exchange of Ras also contributes to these processes. The MAPK ERK1/2 also
  regulates PLA2 activation, which leads to the liberation of arachidonic acid for
  the generation of eicosanoids (not depicted). The role of LAT2 in mast cell activation
  is still enigmatic; however, it has been proposed to both upregulate and downregulate
  antigen-mediated responses. It does appear to be required for the ability of KIT
  to enhance FcεRI-dependent degranulation. Due to the complexity of the signaling
  cascades depicted, some of the intermediary steps involved in these processes could
  not be illustrated in this figure. For further details, readers are referred to
  other recent review articles (,,).
