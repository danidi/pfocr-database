caption: G1 cell cycle control by the pRB pathway. Many cellular signaling events
  are intrinsically linked to G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is controlled by the
  RB pathway. Signaling to the RB pathway and thus G1 control by different cellular
  processes is achieved mainly through the regulation of cyclins and CDK inhibitors
  (CKIs). In mammalian cells, mitogenic signals first induce the synthesis of D-type
  cyclins, leading to activation of cyclin-D-dependent CDK4 and CDK6, and then induce
  E-type cyclins to activate CDK2. Cyclin-D–CDK4/6 and cyclin-E–CDK2 cooperatively
  phosphorylate RB-family proteins, derepressing E2F to allow transcription of E2F-target
  genes, thereby promoting the G1/S transition. The INK4 proteins specifically inhibit
  CDK4 and CDK6, whereas the p21 (CIP/KIP) family of CKIs inhibits multiple CDKs.
  Although the schematic illustration is based on mammalian cells, the regulation
  of both G1 cyclins and CDK inhibitors is evolutionarily conserved.
