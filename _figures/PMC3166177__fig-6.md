caption: HIF-dependent alteration of gene expression during hypoxia. Under normoxic
  conditions, hydroxylation of proline residues within the α-subunit promotes HIF-α
  association with the von Hippel Lindau gene product, leading to HIF-α destruction
  via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. This is achieved by oxygen-sensing PHDs. In
  addition, hydroxylation of an asparagine residue by FIH blocks association with
  coactivators (e.g., p300). In hypoxia, substrate availability for PHDs and FIH is
  decreased, thereby preventing hydroxylation-dependent destruction of HIF-α, and
  allowing coactivator binding. Thus, HIF-α subunits (both HIF-1α and HIF-2α) escape
  proteolysis, dimerize with HIF-1β, recruit coactivators, and activate transcription
  via binding to the promoter region of hypoxia-responsive genes (hypoxia-responsive
  elements). This leads to the transcriptional activation of genetically controlled
  survival pathways, including angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, metabolism, mitochondrial
  functions, or adenosine generation and signaling. FIH, factor inhibiting HIF; HREs,
  hypoxia-responsive elements; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; PHDs, prolyl-hydroxylases;
  pVHL, von Hippel Lindau gene product. (To see this illustration in color the reader
