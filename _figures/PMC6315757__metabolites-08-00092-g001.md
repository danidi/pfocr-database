caption: Metabolic pathways likely contributing to symptoms and pathology in OA. (A)
  Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase compete for arginine, which is reduced
  in the OA metabolome, to generate nitric oxide (NO) and l-orninithe, contributors
  to inflammation and fibrosis, respectively. (B) Secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2)
  catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylcholine (PC) analogues to lysoPC analogues.
  Subsequent metabolism of lysoPCs via autotaxin generates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),
  a signaling molecule known to promote pain. Furthermore, generation of endocannabinoids
  from phosphatidylethanolamines requires PC analogues, also contributing to lysoPC
  production. Resulting endocannabinoids function to reduce pain. (C) Branched chain
  amino acids (BCAAs) induce mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which
  inhibits intracellular autophagy, a mechanism that protects cartilage homeostasis.
  Overall this leads to cartilage destruction and increased chondrocyte cell death.
  (A–C) Text size indicates concentration/activity of individual factors. Arrow/block
  arrow thickness indicates the likely relative contribution of each pathway in OA
  symptom and pathology development.
