caption: Proposed mechanistic scheme of MUC13 regulating NF-κB activation, related
  to , ,  and . (a) Role of MUC13 in the membrane-associated TNFR complex. Connection
  between the proteins shows their ability to bind directly. Given that human colorectal
  cancers and some colorectal cancer cell lines aberrantly overexpress MUC13 while
  exhibiting low expression of TNFR1 ( and ), we propose that binding of MUC13 to
  TNFR1 increases clustering of the TNFR1 signaling complex, thereby amplifying the
  efficiency of TNF-induced signaling. In this context, MUC13 is a key to the appropriate
  organization at the cell membrane of the complex that forms around TNFR1. Following
  TNF stimulation, TNFR1 engages receptor adaptor proteins (TRADD, TRAFs and RIPK1),
  and MUC13 then facilitates the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase cIAP1 to the
  TNF-receptor signaling complex, resulting in K63-linked ubiquitination of RIPK1.
  Polyubiquitylated RIPK1 provides docking sites to recruit NEMO that precedes TAK1-IKK-IκB
  phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. (b) Role for MUC13 in regulating NF-κB activation
  in response to genotoxins. DNA-damaging agents induce MUC13 cytoplasmic and nuclear
  translocation and/or retention (), allowing MUC13 to accumulate in the cytosol or
  nucleus where MUC13 promotes the phosphorylation of ATM (). In addition, MUC13 induces
  the SUMOylation of NEMO by increasing the expression of PARP1, which in turn acts
  as a DNA damage sensor and catalyses the formation of polyADP-ribose on target substrates,
  including on PARP1 itself. Auto-modified PARP1 promotes NEMO SUMOylation in the
  nucleus by assembling a signaling complex. Given that MUC13 interacts with cIAP1,
  MUC13 may recruit cIAP1 or other E3 ligases to NEMO, leading to its enhanced ubiquitination.
  As a consequence, ubiquitination of NEMO and activation of ATM ultimately lead to
  activation of IKKs and NF-κB to promote cell survival after DNA damage.
