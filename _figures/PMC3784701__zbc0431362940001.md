caption: 'NAD+ in S. cerevisiae is synthesized from NA via the salvage pathway and
  from tryptophan through the de novo pathway. NA and tryptophan imported from the
  growth medium serve as precursors of NAD+. A gray box indicates the activity of
  sirtuins (Sir2p and Hst1p-4p), NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, which hydrolyze
  NAD+ into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose, in a reaction coupled with protein/histone
  deacetylation. The enzymes involved in the salvage pathway for NAD+synthesis are
  primarily localized in the nucleus (, ), whereas the enzymes in the de novo pathway
  are distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm (). The de novo pathway converts tryptophan
  to nicotinic acid mononucleotide in a series of reactions catalyzed by Bna1p–6p.
  Nicotinic acid mononucleotide is the point of convergence for the de novo and salvage
  pathways for NAD+ biosynthesis. Abbreviations used are as follows: NAD+, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; NA, nicotinic acid; NAM, nicotinamide; NaMN, nicotinic acid
  mononucleotide; NaAD, deamido-NAD.'
