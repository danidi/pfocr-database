caption: 'Model for how APC mutations affect insulin-induced dynein movement toward
  MT minus ends. (A) WT cells in the absence of insulin or serum factors: GSK-3β (orange
  star) near the membrane (gray) is phosphorylated on Y216 and active. Nearby dynein
  motors are phosphorylated, rendering them more likely to bind to APC than to Ndel1.
  Here phosphorylated dynein (pDyn, red oval) is shown bound to an APC homodimer (purple
  ovals) at sites of MT (green line) capture at the plasma membrane. Unphosphorylated
  dynein (Dyn) may be bound to Ndel1 (yellow triangle) and actively translocating
  (arrow). (B) Insulin (dark orange circle) binds to receptors, activating a signaling
  pathway that locally and transiently inactivates GSK-3β by S9 phosphorylation. Dynein
  becomes locally and transiently dephosphorylated, is released from APC, binds to
  Ndel1, and then moves toward MT minus ends. The increase in number of processive
  dyneins results in minus-end accumulation at centrosomes (not shown). (C) MIN cells
  in the absence of insulin or serum factors: GSK-3β is active, but there is a reduced
  pool of dynein associated with FL-APC because MIN APC blocks the interaction. MIN
  APC also forms aggregates in the cytoplasm. (D) Normal inhibition of GSK3β occurs
  in response to insulin signaling but as the APC-bound, insulin-sensitive pool of
  dynein is reduced, the net effect of insulin on motor distribution is minimal.'
