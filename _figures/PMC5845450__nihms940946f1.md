caption: Central metabolic pathways of Geobacillus LC300 based on the genome annotation.
  EC numbers of identified enzymes are shown. No gene encoding for 6-phosphogluconolactonase
  (EC 3.1.1.31) was identified. However, this reaction is also known to proceed spontaneously,
  so the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway was considered complete.

  xylose-utilizing bacterium.
