caption: 'A prime signaling cascade that mediates changes in [Ca2+]cyt (cytosolic)
  initiates with the activation of plasma membrane (PM) receptors (ex-GPCR, G-protein
  coupled receptor). This leads to generation of the diffusible messenger - IP3 (inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate) which releases the [Ca2+]ER by activating IP3R (IP3 receptor).
  Depletion of the ER/SR(endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum) stores induces clustering
  of STIM proteins (stromal interaction molecule1 and 2) and the STIM1 clusters/puncta
  then facilitate Ca2+ influx via the store operated Ca2+ channels. Besides this other
  significant Ca2+ influx routes such as, receptor operated (ROCC), voltage gated
  (VGCC), ligand gated (LGCC), and second messenger regulated (SMCC) calcium channels
  also contribute to increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Other components that are also known to
  regulate [Ca2+]cyt include - undefined (?) source such as Ca2+ leaks/diffusion,
  ER translocon and debatable components such as CIF (Ca2+ influx factor) and PM IP3R.
  In addition to Ca2+ buffering by proteins such as calmodulin, calreticulin etc.,
  the steady-state levels of [Ca2+]cyt is achieved by its extrusion into cells exterior
  and/or by sequestration into organelles. The major components that bring about this
  homeostasis of Ca2+ includes Ca2+ ATPases of the PM (PMCA), ER (SERCA pump), golgi
  (SPCA – secretory pathway Ca2+ ATPase), nucleus (NPC - nuclear pore complex), NCX
  (sodium Ca2+ exchangers), VDAC (voltage dependant anion channel) and the mitochondrial
  uniporter. The PM Ca2+ receptor (CaR) is known to act via sensing the extracellular
  [Ca2+] whereas the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex (PTP) regulates
  the change in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) in response to mitochondrial
  [Ca2+]. In aggregate, the resultant increase in [Ca2+]cyt, via various PM Ca2+ channels,
  would engage (to list a few) a variety of short-term (ex-phosphorylation, secretion)
  and long-term (ex-gene regulation, proliferation, death) cellular functions thereby
  translating extracellular cues into observable physiological changes. Other abbreviations:
  RTK – receptor tyrosine kinase, PLC – phospholipase C, PIP2 – phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate, DAG – diacylglycerol, PLN –phospholamban, NFAT (nuclear factor
  of activated T cells), NFkB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells).'
