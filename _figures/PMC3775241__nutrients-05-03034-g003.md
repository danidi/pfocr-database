caption: Regulation of hepatic hepcidin induction at the cellular level. Transferrin
  bound iron (Tf-Fe) is monitored by an “iron sensing complex”, which consists of
  the transferrin receptors (TfR) 1 and 2, HFE, and HJV. HJV is a glykosylphosphatidylinositol
  (GPI)-linked membrane associated protein that functions as a BMP coreceptor, and
  enhances bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Binding of one of the more
  than 25 known BMP ligands (such as BMP6) to type I and II BMP receptors induces
  the type II receptor to phosphorylate and activate the BMP type I receptor. There
  are four BMP type I receptors (called ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6), and three BMP
  type II receptors (BMPR2, ActRIIA, and ActRIIB). The activated BMP type I receptor
  leads to phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules called receptor associated
  SMAD proteins (R-SMADs). Phosphorylated R-SMADs transfer together with SMAD 4 to
  the hepatocyte nucleus and induce hepcidin transcription. SMAD6 and SMAD7 are inhibitory
  SMADs. BMPER, the BMP endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator inhibits BMP
  signaling and decreases hepatic hepcidin expression. MicroRNA 122 is activated by
  HFE or HJV and inhibits the latter in a negative feedback regulatory loop. The transmembrane
  serine protease (TMPRSS6) cleaves HJV and thereby decreases BMP-mediated hepcidin
  induction. Neogenin, a transmembrane protein known to interact with HJV, can also
  interact with TMPRSS6 to enable HJV cleavage in transfected cells. Soluble HJV is
  generated by proprotein convertase activity and has been proposed to sequester BMPs.
  Inflammatory stimuli such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) induce hepcidin transcription
  via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. A SMAD- and a STAT-binding element have been
  identified in the hepcidin promoter.
