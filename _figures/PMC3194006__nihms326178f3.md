caption: A model of APLP2’s effect on MHC class I internalization is shown. MHC class
  I molecules, at the surfaces of cancer cells, present tumor antigens to cytotoxic
  T lymphocytes (not shown to scale) and induce lysis of the malignant cells. Cancer
  cells (especially pancreatic cancer cells over-express APLP2. APLP2 first interacts
  with the MHC class I molecule in the area of the plasma membrane. By clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis, APLP2 is internalized, and diverts the MHC class I molecule into the
  same pathway. In addition, APLP2 reduces MHC class I recycling by routing the internalized
  MHC class I molecules to lysosomes.
