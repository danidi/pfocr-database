caption: Folate enters the cell through receptor-mediated (folate receptor alpha [FRα],
  gene FOLR1; beta [FRβ], gene FOLR2; or gamma [FRγ]) or carrier-mediated (solute
  carrier family 19, member 1 [SLC19A1]) transport mechanisms. Folic acid is reduced
  to dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). Serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) catalyzes the conversion of serine and THF to 5:10 methylene-THF, which can
  be used for nucleotide synthesis via methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD)
  or thymidylate synthetase (TYMS). Alternatively, 5:10 methylene-THF can be converted
  to 5-methyl THF (5mTHF) by methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The methyl
  group from 5mTHF is transferred to Hcys via methionine synthetase (MTR), a cobalamin-dependent
  enzyme, which generates methionine (Met) and THF. Betaine can also serve as the
  methyl donor for the remethylation of Hcys to Met in a reaction catalyzed by betaine-homocysteine
  S-methyltransferase (BHMT). Met is activated to form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),
  the methyl donor for the methylation of InAs and MMA, yielding MMA and DMA, respectively,
  and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is hydrolyzed to regenerate Hcys, which can
  be remethylated to Met or directed toward the transsulfuration pathway by cystathionine-β-synthase
  (CBS). Excess intracellular Hcys can be exported extracellularly. Genes with SNPs
  examined in the current study are displayed in orange.
