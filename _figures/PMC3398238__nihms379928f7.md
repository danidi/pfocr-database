caption: The first pathway is replication-independent and controlled by the RNF8-FAAP20
  cascade. In keeping with the literature on the activation of the DNA damage response
  by DSBs, ICLs may activate ATR, which can phosphorylate MDC1 and FANC proteins.
  RNF8 and UBC13 are recruited to initiate K63-linked polyubiquitination of histone
  H2A and other substrates (marked by “X”) in surrounding chromatin, which are recognized
  by the UBZ domain of FAAP20 to trigger the recruitment of FA core complex. The FA
  ID complex is recruited possibly by interacting with the FA core complex. The second
  pathway is replication-dependent and governed by FANCM-MHF-FAAP24 complex. In S-phase,
  FANCM-MHF-FAAP24 complex recognizes ICL-stalled replication forks, activates ATR
  (), and recruits the FA core complex by direct protein-protein interactions. Both
  pathways lead to FANCD2 monoubiquitination, the key step of the FA network (see
  also ).
