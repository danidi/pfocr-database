caption: A Simplified Schematic Showing Some of the Known Anatomical and Functional
  Connections Between the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), Basolateral
  Amygdala (BLA), and Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc). Neurons within the BLA may serve as
  a primary integration center for emotional and/or motivational signals with incoming
  cortical sensory. However, PFC neuronal subpopulations also encode emotionally salient
  conditioned associations, and this process requires active BLA inputs., In addition,
  descending inhibitory influences from PFC to the BLA can strongly modulate both
  the acquisition of emotional learning in the amygdala and the extinction of learned
  conditioned associations. It is presently not known whether learned emotional associations
  and memories are first integrated within the amygdala and then transferred to higher
  cortical regions for long-term storage or if both regions may simultaneously encode
  these associations. Converging outputs from BLA, VTA, and PFC may integrate the
  behavioral output or motivated response selections mediated by the NAcc.
