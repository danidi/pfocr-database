caption: Pathway Diagram and Network Map of Benzoxazinoid Biosynthesis in Maize.Diagram
  of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis and associated pathways in maize (A). Of the three
  indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthases (*), only GRMZM2G106950 is significantly coexpressed
  with benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes (B). Similarly, each of the indole-3-glycerol
  phosphate lyases (†) are assigned to nonoverlapping modules for the production of
  benzoxazinoids (B), tryptophan (C), and volatile indole (D). Network maps were constructed
  as described in . Nodes and gene names are colored according to their known or putative
  function. Benzoxazinoid genes not recovered in modules are colored black.
