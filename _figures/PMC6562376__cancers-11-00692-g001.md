caption: β1 integrin induces EGFR- or HER (ErbB2)-targeted therapy resistance. In
  sensitive cells, the inhibition of the ErbB receptor family by either antibodies
  or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) blocks Erk and Akt pathway activation leading
  to cell death and cell growth inhibition. In resistant cells, β1 integrin or its
  associated extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are often overexpressed, leading
  to the activation of β1-downstream pathways such as PI3K or FAK/Src. These pathways
  converge to activate the serine kinase Akt that promotes cell survival and cell
  growth. Alternatively, β1 integrin can be activated by coreceptors such as neuropilin-1
  (NRP-1) to trigger EGFR-targeted therapy resistance independently of integrin-mediated
  cell adhesion.
