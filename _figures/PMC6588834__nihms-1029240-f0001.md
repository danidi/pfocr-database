caption: 'Examples of RRNPP pheromone signaling. (Left) Pheromone source genes, secretion
  pathways, and processing enzymes. (Right) Cells receive pheromones along one or
  more regulatory pathways. (a) Rap–Phr systems. Phr peptides are encoded by small
  open reading frames (sORFs), translocated by the Sec-dependent secretion system,
  and matured by serine proteases. The oligopeptide permease (Opp) complex imports
  Phr peptides into the cell, as is true for all RRNPP pathways (, ). Rap proteins
  modulate three main signal transduction pathways: sporulation, integrative and conjugative
  element (ICE) transfer, and competence. RapA, B, E, H, and J are each capable of
  dephosphorylating Spo0F, thus interrupting the phosphorelay from membrane kinases
  KinA–E to Spo0A, which is a transcriptional regulator of sporulation genes (). RapI
  increases ImmA-dependent degradation of ImmR, promoting ICEBs1 excision and transfer
  (). RapC, F, H, and K bind to the DNA-recognition domain of ComA, preventing its
  ability to regulate transcription of competence-dependent genes (). In each case,
  Phr binding to the corresponding Rap protein disrupts the ability of Rap proteins
  to engage their protein targets. (b) PlcR–PapR systems. As seen for Phr peptides
  above, PapR pheromones are encoded by sORFs and thought to be secreted by the Sec-dependent
  pathway. Upon binding PapR, PlcR undergoes a conformational change to favor DNA
  binding and transcriptional activation of genes associated with virulence (, ).
  (c) NprR–NprX systems. NprX peptide maturation proceeds along the Sec-dependent
  pathway, and in Bacillus cereus, processing occurs by the NprB neutral protease
  (). Upon entering the cell, NprX binds NprR and promotes the receptor to adopt a
  tetrameric structure that enables DNA binding and transcriptional activation of
  genes necessary for a necrotrophic phase of growth (, , ). In the absence of NprX,
  NprR forms dimers and does not bind to DNA; instead, like Rap, it functions as a
  phosphatase of Spo0F (, ). (d) PrgX–sex pheromone systems. Pheromones that induce
  conjugation, labeled c (light blue), are integral components of lipoproteins that
  are processed by Signal Peptidase-II and Eep and are exported by the ABC-type transporter
  PptAB. Inhibitory peptides, labeled i (red), are encoded by sORFs and are also transported
  and processed by PptAB/Eep (, ). PrgZ, a homolog of the OppA substrate-binding lipoprotein,
  enhances pheromone importation through the oligopeptide transporter (). PrgX regulates
  the conjugative transfer of plasmid pCF10 by acting as a transcriptional repressor
  of conjugation genes. Repression is favored when i is bound to PrgX, which forms
  PrgX–iCF10 tetramers and binds at two sites to form a DNA loop that occludes RNA
  polymerase. Repression is disrupted when c binds to form PrgX–cCF10 tetramers, thus
  altering PrgX’s conformation and allowing transcription to proceed (, ). (e) Rgg–pheromone
  systems. Several Rgg pathways have been described, but only two are illustrated
  here. Rgg pheromones are encoded by sORFs and follow a maturation path like that
  of Enterococcus sex pheromones, by way of the PptAB/Eep transport system (, ). Short
  hydrophobic peptides (SHPs) are degraded by the endopeptidase PepO, which is the
  first described pheromone-degradation enzyme for RRNPP systems (). Two pheromones
  of Streptococcus pyogenes, SHP2 and SHP3, are functionally equivalent; either can
  bind to Rgg2 or Rgg3 (). Rgg3, without bound ligand, is a transcriptional repressor
  of genes that affect the surface characteristics of S. pyogenes and cause enhanced
  lysozyme resistance and cellular aggregation (, , ). When SHP2 or SHP3 binds to
  the receptors, Rgg3 is displaced from DNA, allowing access for Rgg2 to serve as
  a transcriptional activator. In other species, Rgg2 and Rgg3 orthologs regulate
  expression of various behaviors, including production of a cyclical peptide in Streptococcus
  thermophilus and virulence genes in Streptococcus agalactiae (, , ). Another Rgg
  system is ComR–ComS. The sORF comS encodes the mature pheromone called XIP, which
  when bound to ComR, induces transcription of the alternative sigma factor gene sigX,
  which controls expression of competence-related genes (, , ).'
