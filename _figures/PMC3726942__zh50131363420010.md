caption: Roles of the autocrine angiotensin system in ER stress-induced apoptosis
  of alveolar epithelial cells. Induction of ER stress activates cathepsin D (CAT-D),
  one of the enzymes capable of producing ANGII by cleaving angiotensinogen (AGT)
  synthesized by either AECs or underlying myofibroblasts (). ER stress also decreases
  ACE-2, the primary pathway for ANGII degradation that normally generates the antiapoptotic
  heptapeptide ANG1–7. ER stress-induced apoptosis of AECs in response to either proteasome
  inhibition (MG132) or the SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S () can be prevented by
  either ANG receptor blockade (saralasin) or by administration of ANG1–7. Activation
  of the ANG1–7 receptor mas reduces ANGII receptor-mediated JNK phosphorylation by
  unknown mechanisms (??) that are currently under investigation.
