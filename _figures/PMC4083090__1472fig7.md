caption: A model of the role for ATRIP SUMOylation in the ATR pathway. ATRIP SUMOylation
  potentiates DNA damage signaling by enhancing multiple protein interactions in the
  ATR pathway. The SUMO-mediated protein interactions of ATRIP stabilize the ATR–ATRIP
  complex, promote the localization of ATR–ATRIP to RPA-ssDNA, facilitate the stimulation
  of ATR–ATRIP by TopBP1, and enable the function of MRN in ATR activation. In the
  absence of ATRIP SUMOylation, multiple steps of ATR activation are compromised,
  leading to severely defective Chk1 activation.
