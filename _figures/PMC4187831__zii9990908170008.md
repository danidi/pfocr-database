caption: Impact of bile acids on HIF-1 signaling. GER-associated bile aspiration frequently
  occurs in patients with CF, leading to the presence of physiologically active concentrations
  of BAs in the lower respiratory tract of these patients. Although aspirated BAs
  are known to modulate components of the immune response, the host regulators underpinning
  this remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that (i) BAs and particularly
  unconjugated CDCA and DCA destabilize HIF-1α protein levels through the 26S proteasome
  machinery via the PHD pathway. Moreover, we demonstrate that (ii) CDCA represses
  the HIF-1α protein induced upon infection with P. aeruginosa, one of the main pathogens
  associated with CF disease. Finally, we show that (iii) CDCA modulates the proinflammatory
  cytokine gene expression profile under basal conditions and in response to infection.
  These findings are highly significant in light of two recent reports showing that
  BAs influence respiratory pathogens toward a chronic lifestyle () and that the P.
  aeruginosa PQS signal molecule, triggered by bile, can also directly repress HIF-1α
  protein (). Therefore, (iv) bile aspiration and PQS may adversely impact the immune
  response through dual or synergistic repression of HIF-1α. Taken together, repression
  of HIF-1 signaling by BAs and/or PQS and the resultant perturbation of the cytokine
  profile may have a significant effect on the progression of CF disease by promoting
  and/or maintaining infections.
