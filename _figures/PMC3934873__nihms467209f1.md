caption: Holo-Tf binds TfR1 on the cell surface; the complex internalizes in endosomes,
  where acidification promotes iron release from Tf. Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by Steap3,
  and then transported out of endosomes into the cytosol through DMT1 and Zip14. Both
  Tf and TfR1 return to the cell surface, where at neutral pH iron-depleted Tf is
  released from TfR1 and TfR1 is ready to bind more iron-laden Tf for another round
  of endocytosis. CD163 is a receptor for uptake of extracellular Hb bound to Hp.
  LRP/CD91 represents the pathway for uptake of heme–Hx complexes. Entocytosed heme
  can be further metabolized into bilirubin, Fe and carbon monoxide.
