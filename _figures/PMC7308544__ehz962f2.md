caption: Model of the metabolic interrelationships between low-density lipoprotein
  (LDL) subfractions and their hepatic precursors. The liver produces apolipoprotein
  (apo)B100-containing particles ranging in size from large triglyceride (TG)-rich
  very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 1, through small VLDL2 and intermediate-density
  lipoprotein (IDL) to LDL. The hepatic TG content (TG pool) affects the profile of
  the secreted particles. Secreted VLDL undergoes lipolysis and remodelling to form
  remnants/IDL; LDL is then formed via the actions of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hepatic
  lipase (HL), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). (A) In people with population
  average TG levels, about half the lipolytic remnants (which correspond to IDL based
  on density and size) in this pathway are cleared relatively efficiently and the
  remainder are converted mainly to LDL-II, which has higher LDL receptor affinity
  and shorter residence time than the LDL arising from VLDL1.,,, The composition of
  IDL-derived LDL is modulated both by CETP-mediated transfer of cholesteryl esters
  (CE) from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and by CETP-mediated transfer of TG from
  VLDL and their remnants., (B) In individuals with low plasma TG, LDL-I and -II predominate.
  Clearance of these lipoproteins is rapid and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and apoB concentrations
  are low. (C) Individuals with elevated plasma TG levels overproduce VLDL1 and have
  reduced lipolysis rates due in part to inhibition of LPL activity by their abundant
  content of apoC-III, an LPL inhibitor. Very low-density lipoprotein 1 remodelling
  gives rise to remnants within the VLDL size range that are enriched in apoE; such
  circulating remnants can be removed by several mechanisms, primarily in the liver,
  including the LDL receptor-related protein, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and LDL
  receptor. Hepatic clearance of VLDL1-derived remnant particles may, however, be
  slowed by enrichment with apoC-III. Very low-density lipoprotein 1 and VLDL2 are
  targeted by CETP, which exchanges core CE in LDL for TG in both VLDL1 and VLDL2.
  Hydrolysis of TG by HL action then shrinks LDL particles to preferentially form
  small, dense LDL-III in moderate hypertriglyceridaemia, or even smaller LDL-IV in
  severe hypertriglyceridaemia; such small dense LDL exhibit attenuated binding affinity
  for the LDL receptor, resulting in prolonged plasma residence (Box ). Together,
  this constellation of lipoprotein changes, originating in increased levels of large
  VLDL1 and small dense LDL, represents a lipid phenotype designated atherogenic dyslipidaemia,,,,,
  a key feature of metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes., Typical LDL subfraction
  patterns are indicated together with relevant plasma lipid and apoB levels. Note
  that when small dense LDL is abundant, apoB is elevated more than LDL-C. The width
  of the red arrows reflects the quantity of apoB/particle production and release
  from the liver, while the width of the blue arrows depicts relative lipolytic efficiency.
