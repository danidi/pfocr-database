caption: Proposed models of Ang II-induced apoptosis signaling in PAEC. Schematic
  of the physiological AMPKβ1/2-Cdk4 complex for apoptotic signaling upon Ang II stimulation.
  Ang II binds to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) AT2 receptor to transduce
  downstream signaling pathway for cell growth/differentiation, inflammation, and
  apoptosis (). In untreated cells, AMPKβ1/2 is associated with Cdk4. Upon treatment
  with Ang II treatment, Cdk4 is dissociated from AMPKβ1/2, coincidentally with AMPKβ1
  phosphorylation. Cdk4-mediated hyperphosphorylation of Rb renders release of E2F1
  from Rb. Free E2F1 binds to the promoter region of the proapoptotic Bim protein
  for transcriptional activation. At the same time, Ang II treatment suppresses antiapoptotic
  signaling by the Akt pathway by suppressing basal Akt phosphorylation. MOMP, mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization.
