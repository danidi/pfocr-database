caption: SnoN stimulates axon growth in postmitotic neurons in the mammalian brain.
  SnoN associates with the histone acetyltransferase p300 to induce the transcription
  of actin-binding and signaling scaffolding gene Ccd1. The protein Ccd1, which localizes
  to axon terminals, plays a critical role in the growth of axons. The ability of
  the SnoN-p300-Ccd1 pathway to stimulate axon growth is restricted by the TGFβ-Smad
  pathway which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cdh1-APC to SnoN leading to its ubiquitination
  and consequent degradation.
