caption: The interplay between autophagy and apoptosis, and the regulation of autophagy
  and apoptosis by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection. Autophagy and apoptosis
  are essential physiological responses to maintain cell and body homeostasis. The
  relationship between autophagy and apoptosis is complicated under various stimulus,
  they promote the activation of each other in some conditions, but also inhibit each
  other in in some special conditions. Bcl-2 binds to Beclin-1 and separates Beclin-1
  from Class III P13K complex, leading to the inhibition of autophagy. Caspase-3 inhibits
  autophagy and activates apoptosis by cleavage of Beclin-1. Caspase-6 disrupts autophagy
  by induction of ATG5 and Beclin-1 cleavage. The interaction between caspase-9 and
  ATG7 promotes the formation of LC3-II and activation of autophagy, but inhibits
  the caspase-9 apoptotic activity. The cleaved ATG5 catalyzed by cathepsin migrates
  from cytoplasm to mitochondria, and then interacts with Bcl-XL to promote the release
  of Ccyt-C and activation of caspases. Uncoupled ATG12 positively regulates mitochondrial
  apoptosis by binding to Bcl-2 and inhibits the function of Bcl-2. ATG12 promotes
  the up-regulation of Bax and enhances the release of Cyt-C. FMDV infection is highly
  associated with autophagy and apoptosis. FMDV VP1 interacts with the integrin receptor,
  which activates the caspases 3, 8 and 9, and down-regulates the expression of Bcl
  2, leading to the release of Cyt-C, and finally induces the apoptosis. VP1 colocalizes
  with LC3 to induce the formation of LC3 punctate, contributing to autophagy and
  promoting FMDV replication. FMDV 3Cpro degrades ATG5-ATG12 and suppresses the occurrence
  of autophagy. FMDV activates PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway and promotes the
  phosphorylation of eIF2α, and then induces the expression of autophagy gene, resulting
  in the activation of autophagy that promotes the multiplication of FMDV. The interaction
  between Beclin-1 and 2C prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes which
  leads to the inhibition of autophagy. FMDV 2B protein inserts itself into the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), acting as an ion channel protein that forms a hole in the ER, which
  damages the homeostasis of Ca2+ and affects the mature of autophagosome membrane.
