caption: Graphical illustration of proposed DEX-mediated preservation of mitochondrial
  fusion and fission involved in regulating HIF-1a/HO-1 pathway. When LPS was administrated
  to C57BL/6J mice or NR8383 alveolar macrophages, DEX activated HIF-1a/HO-1 pathway,
  led to HIF-1a translocated into nuclear, heterodimerization with HIF-1β, which binds
  to hypoxia-response elements (HREs) to induce target gene of HO-1 expression. Meanwhile,
  pretreatment with DEX upregulated the expressions of mitochondrial fusion proteins
  Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1, yet downregulated the expressions of mitochondrial fusion proteins
  Drp1, Fis1, accompanied with improved mitochondrial morphology and dysfunction in
  HIF-1a/HO-1 dependent pathway. Of note, DEX as a specific agonist of α2-adrenoceptor
  exerted efficacy of decreased sympathetic tone while increased vagal tone, thus,
  further studies were needed to validate the upstream mechanism of HIF-1a/HO-1pathway
  that DEX aimed at, and the relationship between HIF-1a/HO-1pathway and sympathetic
  or vagal tone in this area of research.
