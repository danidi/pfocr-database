caption: 'Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways leads to apoptosis via cytochrome c and
  “apoptosome.” Extrinsic pathway: Fas-Fas L binding leads to the death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC) where DISC-caspase-8 complex is activated, leading to caspase-3 activation.
  Intrinsic pathway: Pro-apoptotic Bcl proteins (Bad, Bid, Bik, Bim) become activated
  and translocate to the mitochondria, where they bind or inactivate Bcl proteins
  or form pores in the mitochondrial membrane, which facilitates the release of cytochrome
  c into cytosol. Once cytochrome c accumulates in the cytosol, it complexes with
  apocaspase-9 and Apaf-1 to form the “apoptosome,” which, in turn, activates caspase-3.
