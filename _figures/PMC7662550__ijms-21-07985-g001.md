caption: Signal transduction pathway of budding yeasts in response to mating pheromones.
  Mating pheromones, a-factor and α-factor, are secreted from MATa and MATα cells,
  respectively. Binding of the mating pheromones to a seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR) on the cell-surface, leads to activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins
  composed of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ. The activated G-proteins subsequently dissociate into
  Gα and a Gβγ dimer, and then Gβγ dimer induces activation of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, resulting in mating-responsive gene expression.
