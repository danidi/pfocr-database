caption: 'Reactions marked in red are the essential reactions (including transporters).
  For reactions numbered 1–15 refer  online. The three compartments, i.e. chloroplast,
  mitochondria and the cytosol were found to be involved in chlorophyll synthesis
  pathway. When Rubisco oxygenase activity comes into play, the peroxisome is also
  involved in the process, wherein a few of the photorespiratory reactions are also
  found to be essential. Bold purple arrow heads indicate the reactions involved when
  Rubisco carboxylase and oxygenase was set at 3:1, broken purple arrows indicate
  peroxisomal transporters. Methyl cycle is found to be essentially linked with chlorophyll
  synthesis. Intermediates: 3-P-HydP, 3-P-HYDROXYPYRUVATE; 3-P-Ser, 3-PHOSPHO-SERINE;
