caption: 'Epigenetic modulation of noncoding RNAs regulate cancer biology. Epigenetic
  modifications affect the metabolism and sublocation of ncRNA. m6A and m5C of lncRNA
  manipulate its stability and the binding with proteins and miRNAs (ceRNA). m6A of
  pri-miRNA regulates its processing procedure. As shown, the epigenetic modifications
  of ncRNA play crucial roles in regulating phenotypes of cancer cells by targeting
  members of various pathways. Moreover, lncRNA targets m6A eraser ALKBH5 to induce
  its ubiquitination and degradation, which means a cross-regulation between ncRNA
  and m6A pathway. A: adenosine, C: cytidine, me: methyl group'
