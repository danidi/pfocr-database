caption: Functional annotations and bioinformatic characterization of unique DEGs
  in P815 cells infected with H1N1 virus compared with H7N2 virus. (A,B) The GO biological
  process terms, GO cellular component terms and GO molecular function terms of unique
  DEGs in P815 cells infected with H1N1 virus and H7N2 virus were analyzed, respectively.
  Orange bar chart represented cellular classification of the IAV-regulated unique
  DEGs in P815 cells. Green bar chart represented molecular classification of the
  IAV-regulated unique DEGs in P815 cells. Blue bar chart represented biological classification
  of the IAV - regulated unique DEGs in P815 cells. Purple bar chart represented KEGG
  pathways of the IAV- regulated unique DEGs in P815 cells. (C) The regulation changes
  of DEGs involved in IAV signaling pathway. Red represented up-regulated DEGs. Yellow
  represented down-regulated DEGs.
