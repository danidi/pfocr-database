caption: 'TumorMap framework and application to the analysis of the TCGA Pan-Cancer-12
  Dataset. A, The TumorMap is a publicly available web portal. B, Outline of the TumorMap
  construction workflow. Data from individual molecular platforms (“Omics” Data) are
  provided as input from which pairwise similarities between samples are calculated
  to produce “Similarity networks”; these networks are standardized using the Reciprocal
  Significance of Similarities (RSS; see ) to create a coherent space of standardized
  similarity networks. Map layouts are created with the OpenOrd algorithm using coherent
  sample networks. Integrated multiplatform maps are created from several coherent
  networks, combined before input to OpenOrd layout procedure. Shown is an mRNA-based
  gene expression map; colors represent tissue of origin. Attributes such as clinical,
  molecular, phenotype, or outcome metadata, annotate samples using colors and color
  gradients based on groupings that can be defined by the user. C, TumorMap rendering
  of the Pan-Cancer-12 Dataset, an integrated cross-cancer TumorMap based on six molecular
  data platforms. Several previously reported groups of interest are shown including:
  (i) BRCA tumors cluster into two major groups, with basal samples grouping with
  squamous tumors; (ii) LAML tumors separate into two major groups, with one group
  significantly enriched for favorable cytogenetic risk; (iii) separation of endometrioid
  UCEC tumors into two major groups, one of which is characterized by a 1q chromosome
  amplification event. A novel group was also detected; (iv) an integrated pan-cancer
  cluster, defined by tumors from nine different tissues of origin, exhibits a strong
  immune signature. D, Pathway diagram of immune signaling-related genes with higher
  inferred activity among samples belonging to the integrated pan-cancer cluster (shown
  in C) compared with samples outside of it; networks include genes from both the
  innate and adaptive immune systems.'
