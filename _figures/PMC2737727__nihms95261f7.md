caption: A model for ubiquitin’s involvement in U4/U6-U5 triple snRNP accumulation
  and pre-mRNA splicing. The upper cycle depicts U4/U6-U5 triple snRNP assembly and
  disassembly. The Brr2 ATPase promotes triple snRNP disassembly by catalyzing the
  unwinding of the U4 and U6 snRNAs,,,. Our results indicate that the recognition
  of a Prp8-ubiquitin conjugate within the U4/U6-U5 triple snRNP suppresses Brr2-catalyzed
  disassembly. The lower cycle depicts a hypothetical model for ubiquitin’s involvement
  in the complete pre-mRNA splicing pathway,,. The U4/U6-U5 triple snRNP associates
  with the U2 snRNP-containing pre-spliceosome, and Brr2 can block this step by catalyzing
  triple snRNP disassembly; our results indicate that the recognition of a Prp8-ubiquitin
  conjugate suppresses Brr2 activity at this stage, allowing the triple snRNP to stably
  engage the pre-spliceosome. Once the spliceosome is assembled, the suppression of
  Brr2 activity is relieved (perhaps in part by the disruption of ubiquitin recognition),
  leading to U4/U6 unwinding and catalytic activation of the spliceosome. Upon spliceosome
  activation, Brr2 activity must once again be suppressed, to inhibit premature spliceosome
  disassembly probably due to Brr2-catalyzed U2/U6 unwinding. We speculate that ubiquitin
  recognition is again involved in Brr2 inhibition at this stage. Once the splicing
  reaction is complete, the suppression of Brr2 activity is again overcome (perhaps
  in part by the disruption of ubiquitin recognition), leading to U2/U6 unwinding
  and spliceosome disassembly (ref. ; E.C.S. and J.P.S., unpublished data). The points
  at which ubiquitin enters and exits the triple snRNP and spliceosome cycles are
  not known and are therefore omitted from the figure for clarity.
