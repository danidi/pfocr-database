caption: Synaptic NMDARs are capable of signaling through the CaMKs and the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk/Rsk2
  pathway to phosphorylate CREB and initiate transcription of a variety of pro-survival
  genes. Additionally, synaptic NMDAR activation of CaMKK and CaMKIV leads to the
  activation of Akt and subsequently the phosphorylation and nuclear export of the
  transcription factor FOXO3, thereby inhibiting transcription of various cell death-inducing
  genes. In contrast, activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs opposes the effects of synaptic
  NMDAR activation. Activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs inhibits the activation of
  Erk1/2, thereby reducing CREB phosphorylation. Additionally, extrasynaptic NMDARs
  induce the nuclear import of FOXO3 and the subsequent transcription of pro-death
  genes; this is potentiated by DAPK1. Subunit composition can also lend specificity
  to synapse-to-nucleus signaling by NMDARs. NR2A-containing NMDARs are capable of
  interacting with and selectively activating Ras-GRF2; activation of NR2B-containing
  NMDARs leads to the activation of CaMKII and the subsequent phosphorylation of SynGAP.
  While NR2B-containing NMDARs have also been shown to interact with Ras-GRF1 (not
  shown), how that signal is integrated with SynGAP activation remains to be determined.
  The EphB2 receptor has been shown to interact with the NR1 subunit and potentiate
  NMDAR-mediated calcium influx and downstream signaling cascades by phosphorylating
  the NR2B subunit. Lastly, the scaffolding protein Yotiao can bind to NR1 splice
  variants containing the C1 cassette and tether PKA and PP1 to the channel complex.
  While it is not known if this tethering is important for PKA-mediated NMDAR signaling
  (not shown), this interaction could mediate PP1-dependent signaling to the nucleus
  and dephosphorylation of CREB.
