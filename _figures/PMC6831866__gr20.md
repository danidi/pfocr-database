caption: 'Continuation of the processes described in A. After sufficient inactivation
  of catalase molecules, the concentration of free H2O2 is sufficiently high to allow
  for HOCl formation through peroxidase (POD) (#1 - #3). HOCl then interacts with
  superoxide anions, resulting in the generation of hydroxl radicals (#4). This leads
  to lipid peroxidation (#5), which, at this points remains still without apoptosis-inducing
  effect due to the activity of glutathione peroxidase/GSH (#6). Due to extensive
  inactivation of catalase (#7), continuous intrusion of H2O2 causes further depletion
  of GSH (#7, #8). Under certain conditions, NO/peroxynitrite signaling will lead
  to lipid peroxidation (#9 - #12).B. As soon as the intracellular GSH level is sufficiently
  depleted by constant influx of H2O2, lipid peroxidation has a chance to trigger
  the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (#1 - #7), as described in Bauer, 2017 a.
  Sphingomyelinase (SMAse), cytochrome C (Cyt c), APAF and procaspases/caspases-9
  and -3 have essential functions during execution of apoptosis.In vivo, the completion
  of these steps has a good chance to act as immunogenic cell death and to trigger
  a subsequent T cell-dependent antitumor mechanism.'
