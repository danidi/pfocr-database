caption: The II S and TOR-signaling pathway in Drosophila. The II S pathway is shown
  in cyan, the TOR-signaling pathway is shown in magenta, and the AMPK signaling pathway
  is shown in green. Variation in nutrition influences the release of dILPs, possibly
  by the action of sNPFs and AKH. dILPs bind to Inr which initiates a signal transduction
  cascade involving the phosphorylation of multiple intermediate proteins. Downstream
  growth affectors include dFOXO, which is deactivated by II S via phosphorylation
  by AKT, and S6K, which is activated by II S via PDK1. S6K is also a target of TOR,
  which also restricts the effects of dFOXO by inhibiting one of dFOXO’s transcriptional
  targets, 4EBP. TOR is also regulated indirectly by II S via the action of AKT on
  TSC1/2. TOR also responds to amino acids, by an unkown mehchanism, and glucose,
  via the AMPK pathway. Both FOXO and TOR regulate the activity of multiple growth
  inhibitors and promoters, respectively. Data from references 37, 43 and 50. Dotted
  lines are putative relationships.
