caption: LT pathways and functions in PAH. LTs are synthesized from the arachidonic
  acid (AA) pathway, where 5-LO works together with FLAP on the perinuclear membrane
  that converts AA to LTA4. LTA4 is quickly metabolized to LTB4 by LTA4H, or is converted
  to LTC4 by LTC4S. LTC4 undergoes sequential peptide cleavage of the glutathione
  moiety to form LTD4 or LTE4. LTB4 may function as a transcriptional regulator in
  the nucleus or is transported out from the source cell and binding to its cognate
  receptors (BLT1 and BLT2) to initiate the downstream signaling. In PAH, elevated
  LTB4signaling around the disease arteriole results in the recruitment of the leukocytes.
  Recent data demonstrate that LTB4 may also cause vascular remodeling by inducing
  the PAEC apoptosis and PASMC proliferation
