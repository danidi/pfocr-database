caption: Mechanism of EA-induced analgesia. A rat BPRA model was established, and
  EA treatment was applied to the model rat 1 week after surgery for 2 months. The
  infiltration of CD4+ T cells was increased after EA stimulation, which subsequently
  promoted the release of IL-17 probably by inhibiting MDSCs. Then, IL-17 in turn
  promoted the secretion of β-endorphin via activating the NF-κB signaling pathway
  in CD4+ T cells. In summary, IL-17–CD4+ T cell–β-endorphin axis played a vital role
  in EA-induced analgesia of BPRA rats.
