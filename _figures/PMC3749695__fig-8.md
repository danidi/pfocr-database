caption: Cumulative scheme adapted from the data published in (, –, , , , , ) showing
  components of pathways implicated in regulating the life span in Drosophila and
  their interactions. Potential redox-sensitive targets are circled in dashed red,
  and established redox modifications are circled in red. Components with life span-extension
  effects are indicated by red letters. Genes involved in redox homeostasis may act
  as redox sensors and modulators of signaling pathways implicated in longevity. InS,
  TOR, JNK, and NRF2 pathways are experimentally determined to extend the life span
  in Drosophila and other organisms. TOR signaling is activated by the upstream kinases
  PIP3 and Akt, which respond to different signals mediated via InS. Two TOR effector
  targets are kinase S6 and 4E-BP, an initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein. GTPase
  Rab1 and the phosphatases Prtp61F and PP2A are modulators of the TOR pathway and
  affect phosphorylation of kinase S6. JNK activity is modulated by the phosphatase
  Puckered. TOR, InS, and JNK signaling integrate at FOXO, and both FOXO and JNK signaling
  affects the Drosophila immune response. PTEN modulates both InS and TOR signaling
  and thus constitutes another key regulatory site sensitive to redox. NRF2 activity
  (CNC in Drosophila) is regulated by PI3K and JNK kinases among others and through
  its interaction with redox-sensitive protein KEAP1. InS, insulin signaling. To see
  this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web version of this article
