caption: The JAK/STAT signaling pathway and domain structure of JAK and STAT proteins.
  (A) Various cytokines bind to their corresponding cytokine receptor and activate
  receptor-associated JAKs, leading to recruitment of STATs. JAKs then tyrosine phosphorylate
  STATs, promoting their activation. STATs dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and
  bind to regulatory elements to induce transcription of target genes. (B) JAK and
  STAT protein domain structure. JAK proteins contain 7 JH domains including the pseudo-kinase
  domain (JH2) and the kinase domain (JH1). Trans- and autophosphorylation of tyrosine
  residues in the C-terminal kinase domain lead to the recruitment and activation
  of STATs. STAT protein structure consists of an amino-terminal domain, a coiled-coil
  domain, a DNA-binding domain, a linker domain, an SH2 domain, and a transactivation
  domain. Phosphorylation in the C-terminal transactivation domain by JAKs leads to
  STAT activation and dimerization. JAK/STAT, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; JH, JAK homology.
