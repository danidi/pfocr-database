caption: 'Redox-sensitive steps in hypothetical redox signaling pathways. Accumulated
  research from multiple investigators provides evidence for complex spatial and temporal
  redox events that can be combined in hypothetical signaling pathways with multiple
  redox sensitive steps. Evidence is collected from experiments using different cell
  lines and under different conditions so that the combined reactions should not be
  considered validated reaction pathways, but rather, as evidence that redox signaling
  involves so many redox-sensitive sites that the regulation is likely to have evolved
  a functional design that is coordinated through a smaller number of control nodes.
  Sites sensitive to changes in thiol-disulfide redox state are indicated by an “-SH/-SS-”
  balance. A: in early proinflammatory signaling in endothelial cells, redox-dependent
  signaling includes 1) extracellular Cys/CySS redox potential (); 2) cell surface
  thiol sensor (); 3) kinase/phosphatase regulation (); 4) mitochondrial oxidant generation
  from mitochondrial electron transport (Mito ET) (Go and Jones, unpublished); 5)
  H2O2 (); 6) NF-κB activation involving IκB phosphorylation and degradation (); 7)
  NF-κB binding to DNA (); 8) translation (); 9) processing of proteins in the secretory
  pathway (, ); and 10) cytoskeletal/surface structure (, , ). B: in receptor-mediated
  signaling, redox-sensitive steps include 1) metalloprotease-sensitive growth factor
  release (); 2) metalloprotease-sensitive degradation of growth factor inhibitor
  (); 3) redox-dependent activation of receptors (, ); 4) H2O2-dependent Ca2+ influx
  and Nox-5 activation (); 5) active-site Cys residues required for phosphatase activity

  H2O2 production through Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4 (, )] (, , ).'
