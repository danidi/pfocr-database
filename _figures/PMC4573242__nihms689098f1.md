caption: Classical (genomic) and non-classical (non-genomic) mechanisms of E2 action.
  In the classical mechanism (left), E2 binds to ERα and ERβ in the cytoplasm, and
  then the E2-ER complex translocates into the nucleus and binds to an estrogen response
  element (ERE) on the DNA. Together with histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and other
  co-regulators (Co), the ERs facilitate gene transcription. Non-classical mechanisms
  (right) involve action at or near the plasma membrane. ERα and ERβ in the dorsal
  hippocampus interact with metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a (mGluR1a) to rapidly
  activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cell signaling, which triggers
  epigenetic alterations such as histone acetylation, local protein synthesis via
  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cell-signaling pathway, and gene expression
  via the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). NMDA
  receptor activation in the dorsal hippocampus is also necessary for E2 to activate
  ERK. G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) rapidly activates c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) cell signaling in the dorsal hippocampus, although E2 does not appear
  to mediate this effect. Effects of GPER activation on epigenetic processes, gene
  expression, and protein translation are not yet known.
