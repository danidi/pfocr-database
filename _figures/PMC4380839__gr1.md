caption: Fibroblast–myofibroblast differentiation is initiated by environmental factors,
  such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and mechanotransduction,
  and is mediated via the Rho-ROCK–myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) signaling
  pathway. These initial signaling events result in the polymerization of G-actin
  to F-actin and the formation of contractile fibers, a characteristic of myofibroblasts.
  Polymerization of F-actin frees the transcription factor MRTF, normally sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by association with G-actin, to translocate to the nucleus, initiating
  transcription of several profibrotic and antiapoptotic genes. CCG-203971 exerts
  its antifibrotic effect by inhibiting MRTF nuclear translocation, thereby preventing
  the up-regulation of gene expression. α-SMA, α smooth muscle actin; Bcl-2, B cell
  lymphoma 2; FN, fibronectin; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; SRF, serum
  response factor; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apotosis.
