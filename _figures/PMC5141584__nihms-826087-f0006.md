caption: Metabolic pathway map showing the biosynthesis of lipids that are included
  in groups in wheat genotypes Ventnor and Karl 92. The map is based on , , , ), ,
  , , and . The dashed arrows indicate that those conversions involve multiple steps
  in terms of metabolism. ACP – acyl carrier protein, CoA - Coenzyme A, FA - fatty
  acid, G3P - glycerol-3-phosphate, and UDP - uridine diphosphate. MGDG(x/18:3) in
  Group 9 indicates MGDG(18:4-O/18:3) or MGDG(19:3/18:3).
