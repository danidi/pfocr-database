caption: Schematic illustration of the Osteopontin signaling pathway and effects during
  obstructive nephropathy. UUO induces increased Angiotensin II (Ang II) levels which
  up-regulated Osteopontin (OPN) expression through AT1 receptor. This effect can
  be inhibited by statins. UUO also increases tubular expression of the CD44, a receptor
  of OPN. OPN actions may be mediated by uPAR, which reduces tubular apoptosis and
  interstitial fibrosis through reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
  but promotes macrophage infiltration in the obstructive nephropathy. Discontinuous
  arrow connecting OPN and uPAR means that, although the relationship between them
  has been demonstrated "in vitro" (ref. 126 and 127), no direct relationship has
  been demonstrated in experimental or clinical models of obstructive nephropathy.
