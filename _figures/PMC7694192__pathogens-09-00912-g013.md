caption: 'Schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle within host cells
  and virus-induced host immune response and possible targets of anti-COVID-19 drugs.
  The left section represents the infection stage wherein, SARS-CoV-2 infects the
  host cells. Telmisartan and losartan are ACE2 blockers that inhibit viral binding
  to it. Convalescent plasma has antibodies against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, dampening
  S protein–ACE2 interaction. Camostat mesylate inhibits TMPRSS2 and prevents S protein
  priming for binding to ACE2. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ouabain inhibit
  viral fusion with host cell membranes and endocytosis. Lopinavir/ritonavir is an
  inhibitor of 3CL protease, blocking proteolysis of viral polypeptide chains. Favipiravir,
  remdesivir, and ribavirin are inhibitors of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
  which is required for the replication of the viral genome. The right section depicts
  the host immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the pulmonary and systemic
  level. Here, iNO reduces pulmonary hypertension by inducing vasodilation. Heparin
  is an anticoagulant that blocks thrombus formation. Toclizumab and sarilumab are
  monoclonal antibodies that prevent IL-6-mediated inflammation. Baricitinib inhibits
  the JAK/STAT signaling pathway involved in the inflammatory response. Corticosteroids
  also work to reduce inflammation. Abbreviations: S protein: spike protein; ACE2:
  angiotensin converting enzyme 2; TMPRSS2: type 2 transmembrane serine protease;
  ssRNA: single-stranded RNA; Nsp: non-structural proteins; RdRp: RNA-dependent RNA
  polymerase; iNO: inhaled nitric oxide; IL: interleukin; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.'
