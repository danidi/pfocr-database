caption: SHP-1 and SHP-2 are phosphatases that can play opposite roles in the regulation
  of signalling pathways. (A). In cancer, a SHP-2 activating mutation or SHP-2 stimulation
  by oncogenic signals results in the activation of oncogenic pathways such as the
  RAS/ERK and SRC pathway. (B) Inhibitors that specifically target SHP-2 or have higher
  affinity for SHP-2 than for SHP-1 can lead to inhibition of these pathways, shifting
  the balance towards tumour suppression.
