caption: Current understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating spermatogonial stem
  cell (SSC) self-renewal in mice. Glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
  is the only growth factor demonstrated to have an essential role in regulating SSC
  self-renewal, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or epidermal growth factor
  (EGF) enhances this influence. GDNF binds to a receptor complex consisting of c-Ret
  tyrosine kinase and the GPI (glycosyl phosphatidylinositol)-anchored binding molecule
  Gfrα1 (GDNF family receptor alpha 1). This interaction activates PI3K (phosphoinositide
  3-kinase) and Src family kinase (SFK) intercellular signaling mechanisms, leading
  to downstream activation of Akt signaling, which influences general cellular functions
  such as survival and proliferation. SFK signaling also elicits a second pathway
  leading to the regulation of specific gene expression levels that are important
  for SSC self-renewal. The transcription factor–encoding genes bcl6b (B cell CLL/lymphoma
  6, member B; also termed bazf), etv5 (Ets variant gene 5; also termed erm), and
  lhx1 (Lim homeobox protein 1; also termed lim1) are regulated through the SFK-activated
  pathway and are important for the maintenance of self-renewing SSC cultures. Five
  of the eight known mammalian SFK isoforms—c-Src (Rous sarcoma oncogene), Yes (Yamaguchi
  sarcoma viral oncogene), Fyn (Fyn proto-oncogene), Lyn (Lyn tyrosine kinase), and
  Hck (hemopoietic cell kinase)—are expressed in mouse SSCs. Additionally, observations
  of disrupted spermatogenesis in null mutant mice have pointed to an essential role
  of the transcription factors Plzf (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein) and
  Taf4b [TATA box–binding protein (TBP)-associated factor 4b] in mouse SSC self-renewal.
  However, GDNF does not influence the expression of either Plzf or Taf4b in cultured
  SSCs, and the importance of either molecule in SSC self-renewal in vitro has not
  been determined. To date, mechanisms by which bFGF or EGF influences the self-renewal
  and survival of SSCs have not been reported.
