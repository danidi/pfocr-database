caption: Schematic model for the induction of NO and CXCL10 production in macrophages
  in response to RV virions. The model is based on the data in the present study and
  previous publications (see the text for appropriate references). RV virions may
  be taken up by macrophages via endocytosis, and this process precedes the RV-induced
  activation of the cellular signaling mediated by the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. The
  acidic environment of endosomal-lysosomal compartments is essential for inducing
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is inhibited by neutralization of cytoplasmic vesicles
  with lysosomotropic drugs, NH4Cl, and BA1. Phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 promote
  the expression of the iNOS and CXCL10 genes, leading to the induction of NO and
  CXCL10 production through the activation of MEK1/2, which is inhibited by specific
  inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126. However, RV stimulation has little or no effect on
  the activity of p38 MAPK, a member of the stress-activated MAPKs.
