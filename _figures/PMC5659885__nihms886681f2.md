caption: (A) Schematic depicting the interiors of a cell in a pre-stretch condition.
  The RhoGAP SPV-1 is attached to the membrane via its F-BAR domain and actively inhibits
  RhoA, calcium levels in the cells are low, myosin II is primarily inactive and the
  level of F-actin is low because of little polymerization and severing by cofilin.
  (B) Schematic depicting activation of the integrin-mediated pathway, RhoA-mediated
  pathway and calcium-mediated pathway, in response to stretch. Activation of integrins
  results in assembly of focal adhesions, Src and FAK phosphorylation, redistribution
  of zyxin, VASP and alpha-actinin to reinforce stress fibers and recruitment of RhoGEFs.
  Activation of RhoA activates downstream pathways resulting in phosphorylation and
  activation of myosin. In parallel, actin polymerization is enhanced by RhoA-mediated
  activation of formins and inhibition of the actin-severing activity of cofilin.
  Activation of calcium(Ca2+)-mediated signaling induces calcium-dependent steps ultimately
  resulting in myosin activation through MLCK. Filamin functions as a link between
  calcium influx and actin. All three pathways converge at activation of the actomyosin
  contractile machinery and consequently increase intracellular tension.
