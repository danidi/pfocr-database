caption: Samples and clinical data are collected at point of care (red box). Patient
  data is loaded into RedCap and samples are processed according to optimized protocols
  and shipped to the Sample and Tissue Repository for distribution to the technical
  sites. Proteomic analyses, CYTOF and scRNAseq are each performed at different technical
  sites (blue box) and data analyses and integration (green box) are performed by
  the scientific groups. Examples of analyses and integration methods are shown in
  the bottom panel. Profiled cells are grouped into clusters sharing similar gene
  expression patterns (Step 1) (). The dimensionality of the expression data of these
  genes is reduced using PCA (principal component analysis) and the resulting low-dimensional
  data analyzed using graph-based clustering (Step 2a). Further subclustering reveals
  cell subtypes (Step 2b). Cluster labeling is performed by taking into account the
  distribution of known lineage markers across clusters; the identity of genes specifically
  upregulated in each cluster; and by comparing the gene expression data of each cluster
  to those of published datasets of reference samples (Step 2c). Individual gene expression
  (violin plot) in each cell subtype can be generated (Step 3). Pathway enrichment
  analysis using curated databases and gene ontology analysis provides information
  about which genes are active in each pathway (Step 4). Developmental trajectories
  are constructed by linking cell types to progenitor populations (Step 5) and regulatory
  relationships can be inferred between genes using cellular interdependency networks
  (Step 6). Cluster analysis of CyTOF data-displayed as a tSNE plot (Box). Phase 2
  will integrate multimodal data to address the goals shown in  and to generate hypotheses.
