caption: Control of endotoxin tolerance by AhR. TDO2 expression induced by LPS in
  a TLR4-dependent manner results in the production of L-Kyn and the activation of
  AhR in cells of the innate immune system. AhR activation induces IDO1 expression
  through its genomic signaling pathway, and also triggers IDO1 phosphorylation as
  a result of c-SRC activation through its non-genomic signaling pathway, resulting
  in the establishment of endotoxin tolerance.
