caption: 'The metabolic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis. The classical “neutral
  pathway” with chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid as end products is the main
  pathway in adults. In children, the alternative “acidic pathway” with chenodeoxycholic
  acid as major product is more active. The end products are exported as glycine or
  taurine conjugates into the bile canaliculi. Known metabolic blocks are displayed
  as bars and the specific defects in italic script. CTX: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.'
