caption: The activation and inhibition of the AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasome in SLE,
  Ps, AD, and vitiligo. (A) In SLE, the AIM2 inflammasome can be activated by apopDNA
  in the patients. In psoriasis (Ps), the self-DNA in patients, dA:dT (after primed
  by IFN in keratinocyte) activate, while TLR-7/8/9, EFLA 945, and EGCG can inhibit
  the AIM2 inflammasome in Ps mice model or cultured cell lines. (B) In SLE, several
  NLRP3 activators (Nuclear dsDNA or dsDNA antibody, U1-snRNP, NETs, LL-37), and inhibitors
  (PCB2) have been identified in mice model or cell lines. In Ps, PlxnB2/ligand and
  miRNA155 activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, while BAY 11-7082, Rosmarinic acid, Cycloastragenol
  and EPD inhibit this inflammasome. In AD, activators (γ-hemolysins, D pteronyssinus,
  UVB eye irradiation) and inhibitors (α-toxin, Th2 milieu) of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  have been reported. In vitiligo, monobenzone, and H2O2 activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  (C) The active IL-1β and IL-18 might play multiple functions in immune skin disorders.
  Here, we showed their potential roles in the disease pathogenesis. In SLE, autoantibody
  binds with apopDNA, and generates immune complex. The immune complex might cause
  kidney damage, skin butterfly erythema and vasculopathy when it is deposited into
  different tissues. In Ps, IL-1β activates IL23/Th17 pathway, inducing a large number
  of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Neutrophils, Th17 cells, macrophages,
  and some other kind of immune cells infiltrate into skin. These immune cells crosstalk
  with keratinocytes and finally cause hyperproliferation in epidermis. In AD, the
  inflammasome regulates disease mainly through Th2 milieu. The typical symptoms include
  chronic, pruritic eczematous skin and the elevated serum concentrations of IgE.
  In vitiligo, the disease is regulated by IFN-γ-CXCR3–CXCL9/10 axis. The skin-resident
  melanocytes-specific CD8+ cells kill melanocytes, and finally cause depigmented
  skin patches.
