caption: HOG pathways operating in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. Activation of the
  MAPKK Pbs2 can occur through at least two distinct upstream osmosensing mechanisms.
  One branch links the osmosensing protein Sln1 via Ypd1, Ssk1, and the MAPKKKs Ssk2
  and Ssk22 to Pbs2. In the other branch, Sho1 functions to link an as yet unidentified
  osmosensor to the downstream components Cdc42, Ste20, Ste50, and the MAPKKK Ste11.
  Activated Pbs2 phosphorylates the MAPK Hog1, which in turn activates a variety of
  transcription factors. As indicated, Ssk22 does not exist in C. glabrata, and ATCC
  2001 contains the ssk2-1 allele, encoding a truncated and nonfunctional Ssk2 version.
