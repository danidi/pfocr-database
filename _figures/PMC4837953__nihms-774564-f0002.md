caption: Characteristics of the interplay among RIPPLY2, TBX6, and MESP2 and their
  relation in the notch signaling pathway and L/R axis determination. RIPPLY2 is negatively
  regulating TBX6 via transcriptional repression and protein elimination. TBX6 is
  proposed to regulate asymmetric nodal expression through DII1 expression and notch
  signaling. This scheme was prepared based on the functional data provided by  and
  . Green arrows represent activation and red lines represent inhibition.
