caption: In melanoma, the mutation of BRAF (V600E) constitutively activates the down–stream
  kinase MEK1/2, which phosphorylates ERK2. Phosphorylated ERK2 activates RSK2, which
  transmits a signal downstream to transcription factors, such as AP-1, NF-κB and
  STAT3, and induces their transcriptional activity to express cyclin D1. Silybin
  inhibits this oncogenic signaling pathway by direct regulation of MEK1/2 and RSK2.
