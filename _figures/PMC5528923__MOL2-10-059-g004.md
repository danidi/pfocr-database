caption: Subtype‐specific GP pathway enrichment networks. A) Luminal A carcinomas
  only. B) Basal‐like carcinomas only. An edge in the network represents a significant
  association between the GP and the connected pathway. Red edge indicates a significant
  correlation between the GP and the pathway genes, and a blue edge indicates a significant
  anti‐correlation between the GP and the pathway genes. Glycan structures contributing
  to each peak are listed, underscoring the structure contributing most to the peak.
