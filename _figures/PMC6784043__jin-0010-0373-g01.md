caption: Novel insights into the dectin-1 signaling pathway. Following dectin-1 engagement,
  Src-dependent phosphorylation of the dectin-1 ITAM results in Syk activation. The
  E3 ubiquitin ligase CBLB ubiquitinates dectin-1 and Syk inhibiting downstream immune
  responses. Downstream of Syk, PKCδ phosphorylates CARD9 and promotes the assembly
  of the CARD9/Bcl10/MALT1 complex, which subsequently activates the canonical NF-κB
  pathway to induce proinflammatory cytokines. Dectin-1 also activates NF-κB via the
  Raf-1 signaling cascade. Vav proteins and the ubiquitin ligase TRIM62 are newly
  identified molecules that can regulate CARD9 activation. CD23 is a recently described
  CLR that is upregulated upon dectin-1 engagement and leads to nitric oxide production.
  Activatory signals are in blue, inhibitory signals are in red.
