caption: Binding of M-T5 to cellular Akt induces phosphorylation of Akt and is a key
  restriction determinant for MYXV permissiveness in type II human cancer cells. Phosphorylation
  of Akt at residue Thr308 by PDK1 induces a conformational change to Akt, which allows
  M-T5 to bind. Binding of M-T5 to the hemi-phosphorylated Akt promotes the subsequent
  phosphorylation of Ser473 by mTORC2. Once fully phosphorylated, Akt activates various
  downstream signaling cascades important for MYXV replication in the human cancer
  cells. Type I cells are constitutively in conformation IV and are permissive for
  both wild-type MYXV and vMyxT5KO. Type III cells are constitutively trapped in conformation
  I and are nonpermissive for both wild-type MYXV and vMyxT5KO.
