caption: Proposed model for the role of lauric and myristic acids with PsrA at a higher
  level of regulation of pathogenicity in P. aeruginosa. (A) In late logarithmic growth
  phase PsrA binds to the promoters of fadBA5 and PA056, repressing β-oxidation through
  the fadBA5 pathway (; ; ) and allowing the synthesis of PQS by blocking the expression
  of FadE (). Similarly, PsrA maintains a negative self-regulation over its psrA promoter
  region (), but positively regulates rpoS transcription which prevents early activation
  of Rhl and Las QS systems (; ). In this scenario, PsrA maintains a positive regulation
  over the exsCEBA operon needed to transcribe the T3SS genes () and for the secretion
  of ExoU, a lipase that will favor an increase in the concentration of lauric and
  myristic acids in the microenvironment of the host cell saponifiable lipids ().
  (B) We suggest that an increase in the concentration of lauric and myristic acids
  (signal molecules) in the stationary phase will favor the formation of a PsrA-LCFA
  complex that removes the repression of the fadBA5, PA056, and rpoS promoter regions
  (; ; ), activating β-oxidation through the fadBA5 pathway and the production of
  virulence factors regulated by the Rhl and Las QS systems (; ). Meanwhile the PsrA-LCFA
  complex prevents the binding of PsrA with the promoter region of exsCEBA stopping
  the transcription of the T3SS genes (). At this stage, some microenvironment or
  host factors (e.g., an unknown activator) could reactivate expression of the T3SS.
