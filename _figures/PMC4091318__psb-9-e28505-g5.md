caption: Figure 5. Models proposed in this study. (A) Schematic representation of
  the EC nighttime repressor-mediated temperature responses of the clock transcriptional
  circuitry. Details are given in the text. Briefly, both temperature signals (i.e.,
  changes in temperature and differences in growth temperature) feed into the clock
  transcriptional circuitry through the EC nighttime repressor so as to regulate its
  direct targets, namely, PRR9, PRR7, GI, LUX, and LNK1 in such a manner that a warm
  temperature antagonizes EC activity, whereas a cool temperature stimulates it. These
  findings may be relevant to the longstanding problems referred to as temperature
  compensation and entrainment. Such a temperature signal also feeds as far as the
  PIF4/PIF5-mediated output pathway, thereby leading to the temperature-adaptive control
  of hypocotyl elongation. (B) Schematic illustration is shown to propose a hypothetical
  view that imply the importance of temperature-adaptive EC nighttime repressor to
  properly track seasonal changes in photo-cycles and thermo-cycles. Details are given
  in the text.
