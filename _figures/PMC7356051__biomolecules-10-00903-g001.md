number: Figure 1
caption: 'The mammalian Arg/N-degron pathway. N-terminal residues are indicated by
  single-letter abbreviations for amino acids, and the rest of a protein substrate
  is represented by orange spheres. “Primary”, “secondary”, and “tertiary” denote
  mechanistically distinct subsets of destabilizing N-terminal residues. C* denotes
  oxidized N-terminal Cys, either Cys-sulfinate or -sulfonate. The mammalian N-recognins
  UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5 (EDD) have multiple substrate-binding sites that recognize
  internal and terminal N-degrons and target them to the proteasome. MetAPs: methionine
  aminopeptidase, NTAN1: N-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase, and NTAQ1: N-terminal
  glutamine amidohydrolase (adapted from []).'
