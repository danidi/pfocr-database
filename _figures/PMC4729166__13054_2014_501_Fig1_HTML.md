caption: Schematic illustration of the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor
  pathway by liposaccharide (LPS), TNF-α, high mobility group (HMG)B1, and polymicrobial
  sepsis. LPS binding to Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) is dependent on its interaction
  with circulating LPS-binding protein (LBP) and the subsequent interplay of this
  complex to membrane bound CD14 []. This LPS-LBP-CD14-TLR-4 complex is thus anchored
  to various cells within the kidney (especially within the apical brush border of
  proximal tubules) [], where it initiates intracellular signaling cascades. CD14
  gene expression is upregulated by LPS [] in human kidney proximal tubular epithelial
  cells and by TNF-α [] in mouse renal interstitial and tubular epithelial cells.
  Activated TLR-4 via LPS stimulates the MyD88 pathway [,,], and ultimately induces
  phosphorylation of IκB by IκB-kinase-β (IKKβ; tan-colored) within the IKK complex
  []. Phosphorylated IκB is then released from NF-κB, allowing NF-κB to migrate to
  the nucleus to modulate transcription of various cytokines as shown. HMGB1 activation
  of TLR-4 activates NF-κB via an alternative mechanism whereby both IKKα and IKKβ
  (tan-colored) are implicated [,]. In cecal ligation and puncture models of sepsis,
  MyD88 has been shown to be activated independent of TLR-4 by unknown upstream cell
  surface receptors [,]. IRAK, interleukin receptor-associated kinase; MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; TRAF, TNF receptor associated factor.
