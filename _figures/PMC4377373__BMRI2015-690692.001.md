caption: Simplified diagram of eicosanoid synthesis. The α-linolenic and linoleic
  acids are substrates for the synthesis of AA, EPA, and DHA which are added at the
  sn-2 position to lysophospholipids (via the Lands cycle) or to glycerophospholipids
  (via the Kennedy pathway). The AAs, EPAs, and DHAs that were released from glycerophospholipids
  by the PLA(2) are substrates for COX, LOX, cytochrome (CYP), and other enzymes involved
  in the eicosanoid synthesis.
