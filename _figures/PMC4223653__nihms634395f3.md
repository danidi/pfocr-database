caption: 'The small inset at the top depicts the physiological regulation of mTOR
  signaling by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Downstream of mTOR, several
  cellular processes are regulated, including protein synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis
  and autophagy.A. Neurodevelopmental disease: The larger box depicts how loss of
  NF-1, TSC1/2, or PTEN, or environmental stimuli such as inflammation, epilepsy,
  or hypoxia may stimulate mTOR-dependent protein synthesis result in in a host of
  cellular, structural and physiological responses that culminate in clinical symptoms.B.
  Neurodegenerative disease: The larger box models how changes in these factors may
  result in dysregulation of mTOR-dependent cellular processes, most notably autophagy,
  mitochondrial function and protein synthesis. Dysfunctional autophagy has been widely
  associated with neurodegenerative disease.'
