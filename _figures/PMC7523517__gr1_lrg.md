caption: Key Figure. Reoviruses Rely on Host Machinery for Cell Entry and Egress.Reoviruses
  enter cells via uptake of virions or infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs) into
  vesicular compartments after macropinocytosis (i), clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  (ii), or caveolar endocytosis (iii). Reovirus entry by a particular uptake route
  may be dictated by receptor binding to initiate distinct signaling pathways or cellular
  preference for a particular uptake mechanism. The formation and transport of virus-containing
  vesicles after internalization depends on coordination by cellular components. Vesicles
  can be transported long distances before acidification results in virion-to-ISVP
  conversion and release of transcriptionally active cores into the cytoplasm. Progeny
  virions are assembled from newly translated viral proteins in viral factories (VFs),
  which are tubulovesicular membrane networks derived from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). After replication, reoviruses are released from cells by nonlytic or lytic
  means. Nonlytic egress of reovirus appears to be more common with polarized cell
  types. Progeny virions exiting cells without lysis are recruited to a lysosome-like
  sorting organelle (SO) and shuttled to the cell surface by smaller membranous carriers
  (MCs) to be released by membrane fusion. Lytic egress can be mediated by an NF-κB-dependent
  apoptotic pathway. Figure prepared using BioRender.
