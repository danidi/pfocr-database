caption: 'A number of mechanisms involved in neural tube closure (NTC) are depicted.
  (1) Transcriptional regulation: Grhl2 (grainyhead-like 2) regulates the expression
  of E-cadherin and Cldn4 (claudin 4) in non-neural ectoderm (NNE) cells during mouse
  cranial neurulation. (2) Protrusions: NNE cells display Rac1-dependent protrusions
  that make the first contact during neural fold (NF) fusion in the mouse spinal region.
  (3) Proteases: a pathway involving membrane-bound serine proteases (e.g. protease-activated
  receptor 2, Par2) is active in NNE cells. (4) Interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM):
  nuclei migrate apically to divide, with daughter nuclei returning to a basal position
  for S phase. As neuroepithelial cell cycles are not synchronized, the neural plate
  (NP) is a pseudostratified epithelium. (5) Dorsolateral hinge point (DLHP) regulation:
  the formation of DLHPs is regulated by antagonistic interactions between bone morphogenetic
  protein 2 (BMP2), sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Noggin. (6) BMP and transforming growth
  factor (TGF) signalling: active BMP (detected by pSMAD1/5/8) and TGFβ (detected
  by pSMAD2/3) signalling are found along the neural ectoderm (NE) in a cell-cycle
  dependent manner. Antagonism between the pathways is important for the formation
  of the median hinge point (MHP) in chick midbrain, by affecting the localization
  of apical (e.g. PAR3) or basolateral (e.g. lethal giant larva; LGL) junctional proteins.
  (7) Planar polarized actomyosin contraction: planar cell polarity (PCP)-controlled
  apical constriction (actin fibres in red) causes bending along the mediolateral
  axis in the cranial neural tube of the chick. Basal nuclear localization causes
  wedge-shaped cells in the midline NP of both chick and mouse embryos. (8) Actomyosin
  turnover and extracellular matrix (ECM): the assembly and disassembly of apical
  actin filaments is under ROCK/RhoA regulation. ECM proteins (e.g. fibronectin, perlecan,
  glypican 4) and their receptors (e.g. integrins) affect NTC.'
