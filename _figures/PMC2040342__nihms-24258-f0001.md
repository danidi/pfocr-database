caption: Proteins are co-translationally inserted into the ER, where they associate
  with chaperones such as BiP and undergo core N-glycosylation. Once in the ER, those
  proteins enter successive rounds of folding/refolding associated with deglucosylation/glucosylation
  reactions, known collectively as the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. If properly folded,
  proteins traffic to the Golgi and beyond, to other compartments of the secretory
  pathway, the plasma membrane and/or for secretion. If, however, the proteins fail
  to fold after several attempts, they are demannosylated, recognized by specific
  lectins and retrotranslocated to the cytosol, where they are ubiquitinated and degraded
  by the 26S proteasomes, a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). While
  the classic model of ERAD assumes the need for VCP associated with the Ufd1-Npl4
  dimer as the core retrotranslocation motor, many proteins are efficiently degraded
  without the requirement for VCP. On the other side, VCP controls – either directly
  or indirectly – multiple aspects of ER structure and function (not shown) and therefore
  may affect degradation rates of proteins without directly interacting with them.
  Co-translational insertion of nascent proteins into the ER as well as their retrotranslocation
  to the cytosol may proceed through the same channel composed of Sec61 or through
  different channels.
