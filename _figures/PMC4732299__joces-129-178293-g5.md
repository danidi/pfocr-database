caption: Alterations in the levels of metabolites and mRNA transcripts that are crucial
  to energy metabolism in NAF-1(−) MCF-7 cells. Metabolic pathway maps showing the
  metabolites and transcripts that are substantially altered in NAF-1(−) MCF-7 cells
  and that are involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis
  and β-oxidation, the TCA cycle and the urea cycle. Altered metabolites are outlined
  with blue ovals with the alteration indicated with arrows, and the percentage or
  fold change is given below each. Genes whose transcription is altered are outlined
  with a green box with the alteration indicated by arrows, and the percentage or
  fold change is given below each. Only metabolites and transcripts that showed a
  significant change (*P<0.05) in NAF-1(−) compared to negative controls are shown.
  Reactions that are potentially increased due to increases of metabolite or transcription
  are indicated by heavier arrow weights. Reactions that are potentially decreased,
  as indicated by decreases in metabolites or transcription are indicated by lighter,
  dashed arrow weights. Results indicate increased glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism,
  with possible dysfunction of the TCA cycle requiring utilization of glutamine (with
  possible glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation) and consequently increased
  flux through the urea cycle. The inset in the figure showing graphs is a comparison
  of the AMP:ATP, GMP:GTP and NAD+:NADH ratios between MCF7 NAF-1(−) and MCF7 scrambled-vector
  controls.
