caption: Distinct activation pathways for different CDKs. In this model of the mammalian
  cell cycle, only a single CAK, Cdk7, is required, because of its ability to support
  distinct activation pathways for effector CDKs needed at different times. Prior
  to passage of the R point in G1, cell-cycle progression is reversible and dependent
  on continuous mitogenic signaling. Both Cdk4/cyclin D and Cdk2/cyclin E are required
  for R-point passage, and both might follow predominant activation pathways that
  are “reversible” by a cellular phosphatase (PPase). Cdk7 can overcome this opposition
  to activate Cdk2 by virtue of a faster rate of T-loop phosphorylation on monomeric
  substrates; I hypothesize a similar rate enhancement to allow activation of Cdk4/cyclin
  D complexes (see text; Cdk6 is omitted for clarity). Cdk2 also functions downstream
  of the R point, when progression through the cell cycle becomes mitogen-independent
  and irreversible; it has priority over Cdk1 in binding cyclin A because of its phosphorylation-first
  activation pathway. In the case of Cdk1, cyclin-binding and T-loop phosphorylation
  are mutually dependent and must occur in concert, coupled with inhibitory phosphorylations
  by kinases such as Wee1 and Myt1. This makes Cdk1 activation at the G2/M boundary
  dependent on removal of inhibitory Tyr phosphorylation by Cdc25, which is held in
  check by Chk1.
