caption: Model for downstream signaling pathways that mediate the inhibitory effects
  of FGFR3 signaling on bone growth. The MAPK pathway mediates inhibition of hypertrophic
  chondrocyte differentiation, whereas Stat1 mediates inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation.

papertitle: Constitutive activation of MEK1 in chondrocytes causes Stat1-independent
  achondroplasia-like dwarfism and rescues the Fgfr3-deficient mouse phenotype.
