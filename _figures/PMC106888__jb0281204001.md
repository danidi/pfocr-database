caption: Role of LpxA in lipid A biosynthesis in E. coli. LpxA catalyzes the first
  step of lipid A biosynthesis (, ). The transfer of an R-3-hydroxyacyl group from
  R-3-hydroxyacyl–ACP to UDP-GlcNAc is very selective for R-3-hydroxymyristoyl–ACP
  in the case of E. coli LpxA (, ). UDP-GlcNAc acyltransferases from other gram-negative
  bacteria have specificity for ACP thioesters of different acyl chain lengths ().
  Biosynthetic intermediates and known genes encoding the enzymes of the rest of the
  E. coli pathway are shown (, ). Chemical hydrolysis of lipopolysaccharide or of
  whole cells at pH 4.5 in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate cleaves the 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic
  acid (Kdo)-lipid A linkage without disturbing the phosphates (, ). The released
  lipid product is designated lipid A throughout this paper. The 10-carbon-specific
  Pseudomonas LpxA can replace the 14-carbon-specific E. coli enzyme in living cells
  without interfering with the functioning of the other enzymes of the pathway.
