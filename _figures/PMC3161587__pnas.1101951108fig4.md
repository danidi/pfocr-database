caption: Model for the role of HLTF in remodeling protein-covered stalled replication
  forks. (A) Stalled replication fork at an unrepaired DNA lesion has to undergo severe
  remodeling such that it can clear up most of its protein content, allowing other
  DNA repair machinery to get access to the DNA. We suggest that one such mechanism
  through which a fork can clear up its protein content can be facilitated by HLTF.
  HLTF can have dual functions because it can not only clear up the proteins, but
  also can give rise to a four-way junction intermediate called chicken foot. This
  four-way junction can then be used by other subsequent repair pathways like (i)
  Holliday junction resolvases, which can resolve a four-way junction through their
  nuclease activity, (ii) template switch-dependent DNA synthesis, where a DNA polymerase
  extends the 3′ OH end of the leading nascent strand by copying from the nascent
  lagging strand, (iii) nucleotide excision repair pathway, where a short ssDNA segment
  is removed creating a single-strand gap in the DNA, which is subsequently filled
  in by DNA polymerase using the undamaged strand as template. Once the lesion is
  repaired or bypassed, the stalled replication fork readopts its original structure
  and the progression of DNA replication is reestablished.
