caption: a | Regulation of microRNA-1 (miR-1) and miR-133 by sereum response factor
  (SRF). SRF activates transcription of a bicistronic miRNA cluster encoding miR-1
  and miR-133 (REFS ,). miR-133a inhibits SRF expression, establishing a precisely
  titrated feedback loop to modulate SRF activity. There are two clusters of miR-1
  and miR-133a genes in mammalian genomes, which are expressed specifically in cardiac
  and skeletal muscle cells. A third homologous pair of miRNAs, miR-206 and miR-133b,
  is expressed specifically in skeletal muscle independently of SRF. Genetic deletion
  of miR-1 results in phentoypes that suggest it has a role in mesoderm formation.
  Genetic deletion of the two miR-133a genes results in perinatal lethality owing
  to cardiac defects. miR-1 and miR-133a also repress neuroectoderm and endoderm genes
  and promote mesoderm gene expression. miR-1 can substitute for SRF to regulate downstream
  genes involved in mesoderm development by an undefined mechanism. b | Regulation
  of miR-143 and miR-145 by SRF. SRF activates transcription of a bicistronic miRNA
  cluster encoding miR-143 and miR-145, which are expressed specifically in cardiac
  and smooth muscle cells,. These miRNAs, regulate the expression of numerous mRNAs
  encoding regulators of actin signalling and myocardin-related transcription factor
  (MRTF)–SRF activity, thereby establishing an elaborate series of feedback loops
  to modulate the actin–MRTF–SRF signalling pathway. Targets of miR-143 or miR-145
  include the zinc-finger proteins krueppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and KLF5 (which inhibit
  SRF), MRTF-B, slingshot 2 phosphatase (SHH2; which controls actin polymerization
  by cofilin phosphorylation), adducin 3 (which promotes actin polymerization) and
  Slit-Robo Rho GTPase-activating protein 1 (SRGAP1) and SRGAP2 (which inhibit Rho
  signalling). This pathway has been shown to be essential for vascular remodelling
  in response to injury. In the absence of miR-143 and miR-145, actin stress fibre
  formation is disrupted, rendering smooth muscle cells insensitive to mechanical
  stimuli that typically cause vascular stenosis.
