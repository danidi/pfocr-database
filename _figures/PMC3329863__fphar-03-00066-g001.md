caption: Mechanisms of corticostriatal long-term depression (LTD). Four, one second
  bouts of afferent (corticostriatal, CTX) stimulation at 100 Hz (high frequency stimulation,
  HFS) synchronized with postsynaptic medium spiny neuron (MSN) depolarization (depol.)
  to 0 mV every ten seconds induces endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated LTD (eCB-LTD).
  Induction of eCB-LTD involves metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation
  as well as suppression of cholinergic tone that requires dopamine (DA) D2 receptor
  activation on tonically active cholinergic interneurons (TANs). Relief of cholinergic
  tone on M1 acetylcholine (ACh) receptors, coupled with postsynaptic depolarization,
  enhances activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) resulting in
  calcium influx (Ca2+). This triggers eCB production and subsequent liberation of
  eCBs that signal retrogradely to activate presynaptic cannabinoid type 1 receptors
  (CB1), resulting in a persistent suppression of glutamate release. Adenosine A2A
  receptors also play a role in eCB-LTD, with current evidence indicating the location
  of action on both TANs and D2 receptor expressing (indirect pathway) MSNs. A balance
  between A2A and D2 receptor activation may govern downstream effectors modulating
  eCB production, including PKA/cAMP and RGS4, which in turn regulate mGluR5-induced
  signaling. The role of A2A receptors on presynaptic terminals is presently unclear.
  Serotonin (5-HT) modulation of substantia nigra pars compacta DA cell firing and
  excitation of TANs likely influences this form of plasticity. Moreover, serotonergic
  activation of corticostriatal 5-HT1b receptors induces LTD that is mutually occlusive
  with eCB-LTD. Thus, a complex interplay of several neurotransmitter systems orchestrates
  the fine tuning of the corticostriatal synapse.
