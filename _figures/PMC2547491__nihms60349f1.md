caption: IL-6 signaling and therapeutic targets in CCA. A schematic overview of IL-6
  signaling and its downstream effectors as well as examples of potential therapeutic
  interventions is depicted. IL-6 binds to its receptor, which consists of the common
  receptor unit gp130 and the IL-6–specific subunit gp80. Activation of this receptor
  complex results in downstream activation of the JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK signaling
  pathways. Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway results in nuclear translocation of
  phosphorylated STAT3 and transcriptional up-regulation of target genes, including
  the antiapoptotic Mcl-1. In addition, IL-6 increases EGFR expression by decreasing
  its promoter methylation. Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) results
  in phosphorylation and activation of Akt kinase, which in turn inhibits proapoptotic
  factors and facilitates cell growth. Activation of p38 MAPK decreases negative cell
  cycle regulators and is critical for CCA proliferation. Inhibitors of IL-6 receptor,
  Akt, MAPK, or JAK signaling, as well as bcl-2 protein inhibitors, have the potential
  of inhibiting these pathways.
