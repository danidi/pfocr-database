caption: Targeting BCR signaling attenuates homing, survival, EMDR and MRD of malignant
  B cells. The BCR is a transmembrane protein located on the outer surface of B cells.
  It is a heterodimer composed of heavy-chain and light-chain Igs, CD79A and CD79B.
  Upon ligation by antigen, the immune receptor tyrosine activation motif domains
  of CD79A and CD79B are phosphorylated by the src-family tyrosine kinase, LYN, and
  spleen tyrosine kinase, SYK. BCR phosphorylation facilitates recruitment of additional
  kinases and adapter proteins including Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), B-cell linker
  (BLNK) and other adapter proteins forming a large protein multimer or signalome.
  CD79A/CD79B, LYN, SYK, PLCγ2, PI3Ks and BTK comprise the core intrinsic signaling
  determinants of BCR. The data discussed in this review indicate that the BCR is
  a central hub for the integration between the extrinsic B-cell microenvironment
  and the intrinsic signaling pathways, thereby playing a central role in malignant
  B-cell homing, survival and EMDR. To this end, targeting the BCR pathway will attenuate
  growth and survival signals emanating from both B-cell intrinsic abnormalities and
  from the TME. BCR-targeting strategies using SYK inhibitor fosamatinib, the BTK
  inhibitor ibrutinib and the PI3Kδ inhibitor GS1101/idelalisib revealed that patients
  with malignant B-cell disorders are particularly sensitive to inhibitors of BCR-associated
  kinases.
