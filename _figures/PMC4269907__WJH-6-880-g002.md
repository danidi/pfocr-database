caption: 'Routes for in vivo glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end-products
  synthesis. The glycolytic intermediate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) is usually
  catabolized (glycolysis) by the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH). However, reductions in GAPDH activity lead to the intracellular accumulation
  of G3P. As a result, G3P metabolism starts to occur via an alternative pathway,
  leading to a rise in the concentration of glyceraldehyde, which promotes the synthesis
  of TAGE. Fructokinase phosphorylates fructose to fructose 1-phosphate, which is
  then broken down into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde by aldolase
  B (fructolysis). The resultant glyceraldehyde is transported (or leaks passively)
  across the cell membrane. Glyceraldehyde promotes the formation of TAGE both intracellularly
  and extracellularly. AGEs: Advanced glycation end-products; TAGE: Toxic AGEs (glyceraldehyde-derived
  AGEs); HFCS: High-fructose corn syrup; AR: Aldose reductase; SDH: Sorbitol dehydrogenase;
  FK: Fructokinase; G6P: Glucose 6-phosphate; F6P: Fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6DP: Fructose
  1,6-diphosphate; F1P: Fructose 1-phosphate; P-NH2: Free amino residue.'
