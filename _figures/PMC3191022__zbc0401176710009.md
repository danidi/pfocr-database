caption: Proposed mechanism for negative regulation of IL-12p40 expression by hyperactivation
  of ERK1/2 in the presence of LPS, corticosterone, and MW. Key mediators downstream
  of the LPS signaling pathway lead to expression of IL-12p40 (solid lines). MW in
  the presence of corticosterone inhibits LPS-induced IKK activation, and subsequent
  phosphorylation of IkBα therefore decreases translocation of p65 and p50. At the
  same time, inhibited IKK inactivates PP2A recruitment and its phosphatase activity,
  thereby promoting hyperactivation of MEK1/2 and subsequently ERK1/2 hyperactivation
  (dotted lines). Inhibition of PP2A activity hyperactivates ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  and down-regulates IL-12p40 message levels. GC, glucocorticoid.
