caption: Activation of Parkin is mediated by the accumulation of mitochondrial outer
  membrane protein kinase PINK1, and oxidation of Parkin which subsequently reduced
  by MsrB2 that has been released from a damaged mitochondrion. Ubiquitination of
  MsrB2 by Parkin would then proceed, enabling the formation of the Parkin/MsrB2/LC3II
  complex and the autophagosome leading to mitophagy. This pathway signals the destruction
  of a damaged mitochondrion and is accentuated in environments with high levels of
  ROS (like in diabetes), while reduced in Parkinson's disease.
