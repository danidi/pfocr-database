caption: Model of how UFD-2 integrates HR repair and apoptotic signalling. UFD-2 forms
  hubs late after IR (additionally containing proteolytic factors as CDC-48 and the
  proteasome (not shown)) that are dependent on active repair and apoptotic CEP-1
  signalling. UFD-2 hub formation is balanced by the E3 ligase HECD-1 and the DUB
  ATX-3. In accordance with hub formation at later stages after DSB induction, UFD-2
  supports RAD-51 dissociation from DSB site at advanced time points and mediates
  signal to apoptosis pathway.
