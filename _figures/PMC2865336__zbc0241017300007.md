caption: Role of Rad9A in the G2 decatenation checkpoint. Inhibition of Topo II by
  ICRF-193 prevents catenated chromosomes from being resolved following replication.
  Catenated chromosomes induce a G2 checkpoint delay, mediated by ATR. ATR acts upstream
  of both BRCA1 and Plk1 (not illustrated) in a pathway that results in exclusion
  of Cyclin B1 from the nucleus and delay in mitotic progression. Rad9A may play a
  role in this pathway as a substrate of ATR or through interactions with Topo-binding
  protein 1 (TopBP1), which also binds Topo II. ATM is also activated, as indicated
  by autophosphorylation at Ser1981. ATM phosphorylates Rad9A Ser272 and Chk2 Thr68
  in response to catenated chromosomes. Rad9A and Chk2 both function to prevent re-replication
  and cut-like phenotypes, and ATM may function in a redundant manner to prevent cell
  cycle progression in cancer lung cells.
