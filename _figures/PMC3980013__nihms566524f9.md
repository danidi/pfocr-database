caption: Brief priming with LPS induces ERK1 phosphorylation that likely induces changes
  in either the localization or interaction of ASC with an NLR component of the inflammasome.
  This step 1 (priming event) can be blocked by UO126 and is controlled by reactive
  oxygen species and the proteasome. It seems that LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation
  leads to an ERK-dependent posttranslational modification of one or more of the key
  proteins involved in inflammasome function. DUBs may work downstream or parallel
  to the ERK pathway. Step 2 (provided by ATP in our experiments) lowers intracellular
  potassium levels. Step 2 is dependent upon this rapid signaling process since ATP
  without priming does not activate caspase-1.
