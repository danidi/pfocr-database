caption: Model of IL23 mediated resistance to apoptosis of mucosal CD4+ T cells in
  anti-TNF refractory Crohn’s disease patients. In anti-TNF refractory patients, TNFR2
  bearing gut CD4+ T cells express the IL23R. Heightened production of IL23 from CD14+
  macrophages leads to binding to the IL23R on CD4+TNFR2+ T cells and induction of
  STAT3 activation. This activation leads to the expansion of CD4+IL23R+TNFR2+ T cells
  that are resistant to apoptosis induction by anti-TNF antibodies, resulting in the
  perpetuation of mucosal inflammation.
