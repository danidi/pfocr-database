caption: 'Flux distribution for P. putida KT217 during exponential growth on gluconate.
  The flux values (values in boxes) are expressed as percentages of the specific gluconate
  uptake rate. It is thought that malic enzyme uses NAD as a cofactor. Gluconeogenetic
  reactions and the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate cycle are not shown.
  Abbreviations: EDP, Entner-Doudoroff pathway; EMP, glycolysis; FS, fatty acid biosynthesis;
  GC, glyoxylate cycle; GNG, gluconeogenesis; PPC, pentose phosphate cycle; TCC, citric
  acid cycle; A, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; B, malic enzyme; C, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  D, malate synthase; E, isocitrate lyase; F, isocitrate dehydrogenase; G, 2-oxoglutarate
  synthase; T3P, triose 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate; ACoA,
  acetyl-CoA; OAA, oxaloacetate; GLY, glyoxylate; ICI, isocitrate; SUC, succinate;
  MAL, malate. FADH2 is treated like NADH.'
