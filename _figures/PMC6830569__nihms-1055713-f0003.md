caption: As illustrated, the Keap1-independent regulation of Nrf2 protein stability
  may occur via two pathways. One pathway is that GSK-3β phosphorylates Nrf2 enabling
  it to be recognized by β-TrCP and ubiquitylated by the β-TrCP-Cul1 E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex for the eventual proteasomal degradation. The other pathway is dependent
  on Hrd1, an E3 ligase that ubiquitylates Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation. Hence,
  both pathways are negative regulators of Nrf2 protein stability, and inhibition
  of these pathways would cause Nrf2 activation and increased antioxidant gene expression.
