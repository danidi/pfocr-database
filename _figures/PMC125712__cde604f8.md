caption: Fig. 8. Ang1-mediated migration. A schematic representation of the signaling
  pathways mediated through Ang1/Tek signaling that promote cell migration. Ang1 regulates
  two pathways that mediated cell motility, the first being through activation of
  the PI3-kinase pathway and the second involving the phosphotyrosine-dependent recruitment
  of Dok-R, Nck and activation of Pak at the cell membrane. PI3-kinase comprises a
  p85 regulatory subunit, which binds the p110 catalytic subunit. Wort (wortmannin)/LY
  (LY294002) are pharmacological inhibitors of PI3-kinase.
