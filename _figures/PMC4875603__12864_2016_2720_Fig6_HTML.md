caption: 'Expression of genes that function in leukocyte activation in uninfected
  fetuses. Expression of differentially expressed genes from the UNINF v CON contrast
  in fetus that are annotated with the term ‘activation of leukocytes’ in Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA). Gene color indicates strength and direction of expression
  change: red color represents upregulation of gene expression in UNINF group; green
  color represents downregulation of gene expression in UNINF group. Arrow color indicates
  whether the observed direction of expression for that gene and its potential effect
  on leukocyte activation is consistent with what would be expected based on experimental
  evidence curated in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. An orange line indicates that
  the direction of expression of that gene is consistent with activation. A yellow
  line indicates that the direction of expression of that gene is consistent with
  inhibition. A grey line indicates no known relationship. The predominance of orange
  arrows reflects the fact that this function exhibited a tendency to be activated
  by biological function analysis in IPA (Z score of 1.967)'
