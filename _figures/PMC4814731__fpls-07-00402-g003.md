caption: Pathway for ABA accumulation and catabolism in anthers under cold stress.
  Less amount of ABA accumulated in cold-stressed cold-tolerant anthers compared to
  susceptible ones, owing to reduced synthesis and increased degradation of ABA. Though,
  no evidence so far in anthers, ethylene, in plant leaves, positively regulate synthesis
  of ABA8ox1, 2, and 3, the enzymes required for ABA catabolism. Dotted lines indicate
  several chemical reactions; the ? Indicates absence of knowledge in anthers; the
  ∗∗ indicates evidence from leaves; the arrows show the increased and the blocked
  lines the decreased expression. ABA, abscisic acid; ZEP1, zeaxanthin epoxidase 1;
  NCED3, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase3; ABA8ox1, ABA8′-hydroxylase 1; ABA8ox2,
  ABA8′-hydroxylase 2.
