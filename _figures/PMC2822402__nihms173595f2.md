caption: 'Compensatory increase in glucose utilization in astrocytes during sensory
  stimulation with blockade of glycogen phosphorylase. Schematic diagram of glucose
  metabolic pathways illustrating the three major pathways for utilization of glucose-6-phosphate
  (glc-6-P) in astrocytes: the glycolytic pathway to form pyruvate, the pentose phosphate
  shunt pathway to generate NADPH and pentose phosphates (most of which re-enter the
  glycolytic pathway after transformation by the transketolase/transaldolase reactions)
  and the glycogen pathway (for more details, see ). Note that glc-6-P feedback inhibits
  hexokinase (negative sign) and activates the glycogen synthesis pathway (plus sign).
  Inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase with CP-316,819 during brain activation renders
  blood glucose the sole source for glc-6-P via the hexokinase reaction, which is
  specifically measured with the [14C]deoxyglucose (DG) method (see text). CP-316,819-induced
  compensatory changes in utilization of blood-borne glucose (hatched symbols) at
  the hexokinase step are quantified by means of changes in the rate of [14C]DG phosphorylation,
  from which rates of glucose utilization are calculated.'
