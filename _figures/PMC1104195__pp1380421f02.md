caption: Betalain biosynthesis. In this scheme, a general overview of the main steps
  proposed by several authors is provided. For an in-depth review, see . Steps 10
  to 13 are proposed here and imply a major role for tyrosinase and the fusion of
  the routes leading to betaxanthins and betacyanins.
