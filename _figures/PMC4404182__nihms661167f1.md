caption: A. In vivo C3 is commonly activated to C3b via the C3 convertases following
  which it can covalently attach to a target. The resulting C3b may either participate
  in an amplification loop or be inactivated via regulatory proteins. B. In vitro
  C3 activation may occur during exposure to plasticware, improper storage, freeze-thaw
  cycles or activity of clotting or other proteolytic enzymes. In vitro activation
  leads to more C3b generation and then this may be amplified. See Introduction for
  further explanation. AP, alternative pathway; CP, classical pathway; LP, lectin
  pathway; red line, covalent bond.
