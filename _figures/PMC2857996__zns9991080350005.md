caption: A proposed mechanism relating the transition to chronic pain and the loss
  of analgesic efficacy. A, In a nociceptor (purple) in the hindpaw of a naive animal,
  a proinflammatory cytokine (PGE2), causes acute pain (hyperalgesia lasting <4 h)
  that is mediated by activation of a Gs-protein-coupled receptor for prostaglandin
  (EP-R) causing increased adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and activation of PKA, ultimately
  leading to increased membrane excitability and nerve activity, which underlies acute
  pain. In the naive animal, μ-opioids act at their receptor (μ-R) to inhibit the
  second messenger pathway mediating acute pain (μ-R activates a Gi/o protein which
  inhibits AC). B, The transition to chronic pain and loss of analgesic efficacy is
  due to a change in second messenger signaling in the nociceptor (priming). This
  change can be induced by exposure either to a proinflammatory cytokine or to an
  opioid analgesic. In this primed state, both the prostaglandin and opioid receptors
  become coupled to PKCε (via Gi/o) and can produce prolonged hyperalgesia, a model
  of chronic pain and opioid tolerance and dependence.
