caption: The significance of bioactive sphingolipids in neurodegeneration. The ‘sphingolipid
  rheostat’ model assumes antagonistic roles of ceramide and S1P in the regulation
  of cellular survival and death. Although exceptions have been identified, the tendency
  towards accumulation of ceramide and reduced levels of S1P still should generate
  strong neurodegenerative impulse. Potential downstream mechanisms include not only
  inhibition of survival signaling mostly mediated by the PI3K-Akt pathway, but also
  modulation of AβPP metabolism, and alteration of S1PR-dependent immune response—the
  latter capable of exerting either beneficial (Aβ clearance) or detrimental outcome
  (damage to neurons).  symbol denotes the ambiguous role of immune activation in
  neurodegenerative disorders (clearance of extracellular aggregates of misfolded
  proteins and debris from dying cells vs. creation of neurotoxic environment that
  accelerates the loss of neuronal connectivity and ultimately death of further neurons).
  S1P is known to modulate the immune response, but the possible outcome of the resulting
  reaction in the diseased brain is highly unclear
