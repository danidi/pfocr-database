caption: Examples of biological networks (A) Protein-protein interaction. The edges
  are detected from experiment for physical interaction. (B) Co-expression network.
  The edges are inferred from the expression data of a group of samples, as dichotomized
  correlation or partial correlation matrix. (C) Gene regulatory network. The Octagons
  indicate protein activity and the ovals indicates gene expression. The dash line
  between g3 and a3 indicates a3 is the activity of the protein that is encoded by
  g3. (D) Signaling pathway. EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is a receptor
  located at cell surface that can be activated by epidermal growth factor. The symbol−P
  arounds a protein indicates a phosphorylation of the corresponding protein.
