caption: Proposed model for the role of the IGF-1R/NFκB signaling pathway in regulating
  the caspase-3 differentiation initiation signal. In the differentiation of lens
  epithelial cells, low level activation of caspase-3 has an essential role in differentiation
  initiation. Caspase-3 activation for this differentiation pathway was shown previously
  to be downstream of the intrinsic canonical mitochondrial death pathway. Here, we
  show now that caspase-3 activation was maintained at the low levels at which it
  functions as a differentiation initiator through an IGF-1R signal that activates
  NFκB, a transcription factor required for the expression of survival proteins in
  the Bcl-2 (Bcl-2, p-Bad Ser-112, and Bcl-XL) and IAP (ch-IAP-1, X-IAP, and survivin)
  families. These survival proteins can regulate caspase-3 activity to maintain it
  at the low level required to signal lens differentiation initiation; in their absence
  caspase-3 is deregulated and instead signals apoptotic cell death. This is a novel
  role for the IGF-1R/NFκB signaling pathway in lens epithelial cell differentiation.
