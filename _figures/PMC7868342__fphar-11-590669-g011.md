caption: Potential signaling pathways involved in rhFGF20-mediated protection against
  BBB disruption both in vivo in TBI mice and an in vitro in a TNF-α-induced HBMEC
  model. rhFGF20 upregulates junction proteins via the AKT/GSK3β pathway and inhibits
  proinflammatory cytokine expression by suppressing the JNK/NFκB pathway, eventually
  protecting against BBB disruption.
