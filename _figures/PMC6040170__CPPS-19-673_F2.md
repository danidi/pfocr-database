caption: Metabolic pathway of taurine synthesis. Endogenous taurine synthesis occurs
  in the liver via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway. The metabolic reaction involves
  a first oxidation of the sulfhydryl group of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid
  by the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase. Cysteine sulfinic acid is then decarboxylated
  to hypotaurine by the cystyeine sulfinate decarboxylase. Taurine is synthesized
  through the hypotaurine dehydrogenase-dependent oxidation of hypotaurine.
