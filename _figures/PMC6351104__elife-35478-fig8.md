caption: (A) NHL-2 interacts with the miRNA pathway in the soma, where it may regulate
  the translation of let-7 and lsy-6 targets. The NHL RNA binding domain of NHL-2
  may help to reinforce target selection of miRISC in this pathway. (B) In the germline,
  NHL-2 interacts with the 22G-RNA pathway, specifically via genetic and physical
  interactions with the RdRP helicase DRH-3. In this capacity, NHL-2 could impact
  the processivity or reloading of the RdRP complex on mRNA templates, and/or could
  aid in target mRNA selection via its RNA binding capacity. Owing to its genetic
  and physical interaction with CSR-1, NHL-2 could also be involved in the handoff
  of 22G-RNAs from the RdRP complex to Argonaute. If NHL-2 mediates gene regulation
  via 22G-RNAs, it is likely to be at the level of translation. (C) The intrinsic
  RNA binding capacity of NHL-2 could enable it to regulate a large number of transcripts
  in the soma and germline, both positively and negatively. This activity could be
  influenced by additional binding partners, and we speculate that it may occur in
  P bodies (soma) and P granules (germline) based on the localization pattern of NHL-2.
