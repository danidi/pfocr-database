caption: The expression of HRI increases during erythroid differentiation from BFU-E
  to reticulocytes. HRI is the major eIF2α kinase in the erythroid lineage, and is
  indispensable to coordinate heme and globin synthesis. Additionally, HRI activate
  ATF4 signaling pathway to mitigate oxidative stress in nucleated erythroblasts.
  This HRI-ATF4 pathway is activated during erythropoiesis and is necessary to promote
  erythroid differentiation. At the earlier stages of erythropoiesis before basophilic
  erythroblasts, other eIF2α kinases and HRI are both required for the proliferation
  of the erythroid precursors.
