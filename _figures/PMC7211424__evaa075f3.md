caption: '—Schematic representation of immune pathways expressed under parasitoid
  attack in G. pusilla at different time points after parasitoid attack: (A) 1 h,
  (B) 4 h, and (C) 12 h. Dashed-line circles correspond to proteins known to be in
  the pathway in Drosophila but which were not detected as being expressed in Galerucella.
  Upper half illustrates pathways associated with recognition and signaling pathways,
  whereas the lower half represents genes involved in hemopoiesis. Purple circles
  represent genes that were upregulated in the infected samples compared with noninfected
  ones, whereas green colors correspond to downregulated DEGs. Gene names are presented
  in (A).'
