caption: 'Proposed unified model of the pathophysiology of CD representing the different
  known and suggested mechanisms involved in that disease. HHV-8–infected cells secrete
  vIL-6a, which in turn enhances the production of VEGF by the nonlymphoid or plasma
  cellb. VEGF induces vascular proliferation, a major component of MCD. The endothelium
  itself is a source of IL-6 production,c thereby contributing to the systemic manifestations
  of MCD and further enhancing lymphocytic and vascular proliferation. In HHV-8− CD
  patients, an undefined upstream stimulus might be responsible for IL-6 production.d
  We believe that the IL-1e production by many cells, such as macrophage or follicular
  dentritic cells,f induces the generation of IL-6 through the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Dysregulation at any level can lead to overproduction of IL-6, which has a pivotal
  impact on the disease. Several key molecular functions may provide potential therapeutic
  targets in the management of Castleman''s disease (i.e., siltuximab targeting IL-6,
  tocilizumab targeting IL-6R, steroid and bortezomib targeting the NF-κB pathway,
  rituximab targeting CD20+ lymphocytes, ganciclovir targeting HHV-8, cetuximab targeting
  EGFR on follicular dentritic cells, bevacizumab targeting VEGF receptor, anakinra
  targeting the IL-1 receptor). Of note, the black arrows represent an activation
  function, whereas the purple arrows represent blocking function.Abbreviations: CD,
