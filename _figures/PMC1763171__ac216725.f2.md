caption: (A) The inflammatory, coagulation, and fibrinolytic pathways are linked at
  many levels, leading to organ failure and eventually death. (B) The coagulation
  and fibrinolytic pathways rely on the function of endothelial proteins and protein
  complexes. Dysfunctional regulatory mechanisms in meningococcal disease include
  endothelial (protein C pathway) and plasma (TFPI, antithrombin, PAI) factors.
