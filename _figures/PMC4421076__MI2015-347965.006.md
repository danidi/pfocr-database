caption: 'IL-1R1 signal transduction and negative regulation of GR-induced genes with
  known functions in inflammation and apoptosis: evidence of split GCR under sustained
  IL-1β conditions and proposed association with chemo- and GC-resistance phenotypes
  and EMT. (a) Signaling through the TAK1 and AKT parallel transduction nodes under
  normal IL-1R1 signaling conditions []. In the right node, TAK1 activates the three
  MAPK signaling cascades, including the JNK-AP1 pathway and the classical NFκB pathway.
  In the left node, AKT transiently promotes survival by inhibiting p53 and Bak/Bax-mediated
  apoptosis (thin black inhibition arrows) and also triggers a separate NF-κB/AP1
  activation pathway (thin blue arrows) []. The schematic superimposes the most prominent
  effects mediated by the 6 selected GC-inducible genes (FKBP51, GILZ, DUSP1, TTP,
  IRF8, and IGFBP1, highlighted in green) in the regulation of IL-1R1 signaling under
  noninflammatory conditions. The level of wild-type FKBP51 contributes to low transient
  AKT activity, while IRF8 increases Bax expression and Bax/Bak pathway activities
  (bold arrows) which counteracts the AKT and IGFBP1 upstream survival regulation.
  GILZ, DUSP1, and TTP exert their regulatory functions as indicated by the bold inhibition
  arrows [, –]. (b) Under sustained IL-1β conditions, GC-driven transcription of FKBP51
  is significantly reduced, which allows sustained AKT signaling (bold blue lines),
  which in turn has been associated with apoptosis- and chemo- and GC-resistance [,
  ]. IRF8 knockdown (in faded green) would reinforce the antiapoptotic AKT effects
  due to lower Bax expression and weak inhibition of other activities in the same
  pathway that lead to Bax-Bax pore formation (faded gray arrows) [, ]. The IGFBP1
  overexpression would reinforce the antiapoptotic effects of AKT by further inhibiting
  activities that lead to Bak-Bak pore oligomerization [] in the alternative pathway
  (faded and crossed-out). While GILZ and DUSP1 expression is unaffected in the IL-1β-induced
  split GCR model, sustained AKT activation might still reinforce the expression of
  the proinflammatory secretome via the noncanonical NF-κB/AP1 pathway (bold blue
  arrows) []. The latter might be potentiated by the reduction in TTP expression (2/3
  less), a knockdown that has been also associated with EMT [, ].'
