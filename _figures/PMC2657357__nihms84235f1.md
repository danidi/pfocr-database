caption: Major pathway of the conversion of propionyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA. The precursors
  are indicated with their approximated contribution to whole body propionate metabolism.
  The biotin-dependent enzyme, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, converts propionyl-CoA into
  D-methylmalonyl-CoA that is then racemized into L-methylmalonyl-CoA and isomerized
  into succinyl-CoA, a Krebs cycle intermediate. The location of the D-methylmalonyl-CoA
  hydrolase is indicated as are minor pathways of propionyl-CoA metabolism, such as
  the glycine conjugation pathway and 2-methylcitrate formation. The L-methylmalonyl-CoA
  mutase reaction requires adenosylcobalamin, an activated form of vitamin B12. The
  formation of adenosylcobalamin requires intracellular metabolism as outlined in
  the next figure.
