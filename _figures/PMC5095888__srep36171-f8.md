caption: Under normal conditions, p53 is strictly maintained at low levels by MDM2,
  and CSIG predominantly localizes to the nucleolus in a RNA-dependent manner (left
  panel). In response to nucleolar stress, CSIG translocates into the nucleoplasm,
  where it interacts with MDM2 and inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation
  (right panel). The nucleoplasmic CSIG is degraded gradually. Decreased levels of
  CSIG allow p53 to return to basal levels.
