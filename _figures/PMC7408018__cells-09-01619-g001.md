caption: 'Diagram of the autophagy pathway including the convergence of the endocytic
  pathway. Autophagy is regulated by three protein complexes: ULK1, comprising of
  ULK1, ATG13, RB1CC1/FIP200 and ATG101; class III PtdIns3K, comprising of ATG14,
  BECN1, PIK3R4/VPS15 and PIK3C3/VPS34 and ATG16L1, comprising of ATG16L1, ATG5 and
  ATG12. Under starvation conditions, MTOR is inactivated allowing ULK1 complex formation,
  and activation of the PtdIns3K, which creates the PtdIns3P-rich regions on the surface
  of the omegasome. WIPI proteins recognize these domains and recruit the ATG16L1
  complex, which facilitates lipidation of LC3-I to form LC3-II. Receptors such as
  SQSTM1/p62 bind to ubiquitinated cargo and LC3-II to facilitate selective autophagy.
  Cytoplasmic cargo includes damaged mitochondria, organelles, proteins, nucleic acids,
  intracellular bacteria, etc. Expansion of the phagophore through membrane addition
  sequesters a portion of the cytoplasm and upon closure forms the autophagosome.
  These autophagosomes are decorated with RAB7, which leads to the fusion with lysosomes
  to form the autolysosomes, where the cargo is degraded. The endocytic pathway (used
  by some viruses) and autophagy converge, resulting in the formation of an amphisome,
  which also fuses with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. The pink color indicates
  acidic compartments. Abbreviations: AMPK, AMP activated protein kinase; BCL2, BCL2
  apoptosis regulator; BECN1, beclin 1; LAMP2, lysosomal associated membrane protein
  2; MAP1LC3/LC3, microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MTOR, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin kinase; PE, phosphoethanolamine; PIK3C3/VPS34, phosphatidylinositol
