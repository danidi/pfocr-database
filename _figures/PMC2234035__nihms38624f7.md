caption: Model of FAK FERM-mediated p53 turnover and cell survival. FAK can function
  with integrins and growth factor receptors to promote cell survival through signaling
  cascades such as Akt that can activate ubiquitin E3-ligases such as Mdm2 to maintain
  low p53 levels. This canonical survival pathway involves FAK kinase activity (left).
  Under reduced integrin adhesion or conditions of cellular stress, FAK leaves focal
  contacts sites. This increases the cytoplasmic pool of FAK and enhances FAK nuclear
  accumulation via FAK-FERM-mediated targeting. Nuclear FAK acts as a scaffold to
  stabilize a p53-Mdm2 complex, leading to p53 polyubiquitination, and subsequent
  p53 degradation by nuclear or cytoplasmic proteasomes. This regulatory connection
  between FAK and p53 is dependent on the FAK FERM domain, but does not require FAK
  kinase activity (right).
