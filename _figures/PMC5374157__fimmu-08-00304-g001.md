caption: 'Type I interferons (IFNs) and different other cytokines are essential for
  natural killer (NK) cell homeostasis and function. Although type I IFNs are in focus
  of this review, additional cytokine pathways such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL12, IL15,
  IL18, and IL21 are schematically indicated here as important mediators of NK cell
  function. Cytokine receptor binding triggers downstream signaling pathways such
  as the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  or nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway. The respective activated transcription
  factor complex—IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (type I IFNs), STAT dimers (IL2,
  IL15, IL21, and IL12), and NFκB (IL18)—translocates into the nucleus and induces
  target gene transcription leading to expression of genes that are crucial for survival,
  proliferation, differentiation, and cytotoxic function of NK cells. For reasons
  of simplicity, IL2R, IL15R, and IL21R were summarized in this graph. The receptor-specific
  subunit(s) in case of IL2R and IL15R refer to the β- and high-affinity α chain and
  for IL21R only to one specific subunit. Of note, IL15Rα chain is mainly expressed
  by other cells such as DCs, which is not displayed here. Abbreviations: ISRE, interferon
  stimulated response element; γc, common gamma chain; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88; TRAF6, TNF receptor associated factor 6; IKK, I kappa B kinase;
  NFκB, nuclear factor kappa B.'
