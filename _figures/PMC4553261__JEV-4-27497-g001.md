caption: Data slicing and pathway enrichment analysis. This illustration is based
  on a hypothetical example of sequencing-based exRNA profiling of cerebrospinal fluid
  (CSF) from a brain tumour patient. Based on metadata about the selected samples,
  (a) “data slice” is extracted for further downstream analysis using pathway/network
  modules to detect activation of a metastatic brain tumour pathway. Panel b details
  selection of samples for profiling and inclusion in the exRNA Atlas using sample
  (CSF) and disease (CNS neoplasm) ontology traversals. Panel c details sequencing
  assay selection process using assay and experiment ontology traversals. The highlighted
  ontologies “CNS neoplasm” and “sequencing assay” are examples of terms that occur
  within an “ontology slim.” Ontology traversal in panel d identifies RNA species
  of interest. (a) “Data slice” defined by selections (b–d) is analysed to obtain
  a set of exRNA genes that show a pattern of coordinated changes. The metastatic
  brain tumour pathway (www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2249) in panel e
  shows enrichment for the exRNA genes overexpressed in this hypothetical case.
