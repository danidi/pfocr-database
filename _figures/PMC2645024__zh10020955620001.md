caption: 'The Skp1-Cullin1-F-box transport inhibitor response protein 1 (SCFTIR1)
  ubiquitin ligase functions as the receptor for the plant hormone auxin. A: chemical
  structures of the natural auxin, 2 auxin analogs [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
  (2,4-D) and 1-naphthalene acetic acid (1-NAA)], and jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile).
  B: the role of SCFTIR1 ubiquitin ligase in the auxin-signaling pathway in plants.
  In the absence of auxin, auxin/indole-3-acetic acids (AUX/IAAs) repress the expression
  of auxin response genes (AuxRE) by binding to the transcription activator auxin
  response factors (ARFs) (left). In the presence of auxin, the multisubunit SCFTIR1
  ubiquitin ligase recognizes the hormone and promotes the polyubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation of AUX/IAAs in a hormone-dependent manner (middle). Auxin-induced
  degradation of AUX/IAAs frees ARFs, which activate the transcription of auxin response
  genes (right). U, ubiquitin protein.'
