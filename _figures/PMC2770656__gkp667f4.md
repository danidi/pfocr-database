caption: The tyrosine metabolism pathway where the differentially expressed genes
  of lung cancer were annotated. The enzymes identified in all genes of Homo sapiens
  were colored green. The enzymes identified in the submitted genes were colored red.
  The results show that these genes were mostly concentrated in local areas of the
  pathway such as the right-bottom part of the figure.
