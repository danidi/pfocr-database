caption: Model proposing the attenuation of the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway by small molecules
  that stabilize the inhibitory RAF/14-3-3 complex. (A) In unstimulated cells, RAF
  is sequestered by 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm in an inactive conformation.
  After dephosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser233 and Ser259 in C-RAF), 14-3-3
  dissociates from RAF, which can then be recruited to the plasma membrane by activated
  Ras. At the plasma membrane, RAF is itself activated and phosphorylates MEK. Via
  activating phosphorylation of ERK transcription factors such as Elk1, Ets and Sp1
  stimulate genes whose expression leads to cell proliferation and, in cancers, to
  metastasis and angiogenesis. Furthermore, as the examples of Noonan syndrome and
  LEOPARD syndrome show, an overstimulation of this pathway can result in developmental
  defects. (B) The overactivation of the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway observed in many
  cancers and in developmental disorders can be neutralized by small molecules that
  stabilize the inhibitory RAF/14-3-3 complex, thereby preventing RAF plasma membrane
  recruitment by activated Ras.
