caption: A proposed mechanism for ERα signaling. A, Many of estrogen's rapid actions
  are mediated by PTX-sensitive G proteins. B, Ligand-activated ERα receptors cause
  dissociation of Gαi and Gβγ subunits from the receptor and activation of their downstream
  effector systems. E2-induced Gβγ protein activation increases the phosphorylation
  of GRK2 and β-arrestin-1. C, Activation of ERα initiates the recruitment of β-arrestin-1
  and activation of ERK pathway components. D, Formation of an ERαβ-arrestin-1 receptor/signaling
  complex leads to internalization of the receptor.
