caption: Potential pathological roles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD). Neurons release EVs containing Aβ monomers and oligomers (oAβ) and
  miRNAs. Microglia take in Aβ-associated EVs, then degrade Aβ using the lysosomal
  system. Exosome-associated Aβ can produce neurotoxic amyloid plaques (AP) outside
  the cells, when microglia-mediated clearance does not work properly. On the other
  hand, the EVs enter adjacent neurons by clathrin-mediated endocytosis or pinocytosis.
  Then, miRNAs promote the Aβ-generating pathway by targeting the mRNAs which are
  involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing directly or indirectly. Conversely,
  hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) is transferred from microglia to neurons through
  EVs. Altogether, EVs may act as a main pathway in the propagation of protein aggregates
  between cells in the central nervous system. MVB, multivesicular body; NFT, neurofibrillary
  tangle.
