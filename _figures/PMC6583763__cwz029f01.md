caption: N-linked glycosylation in the ER. The multimeric oligosaccharyltransferase
  (OST) complex facilitates transfer of a lipid-linked glycan chain (G3M9GlcNAc2-)
  to suitable asparagine residues (N-X-S/T) of newly synthesized polypeptides via
  the STT3A/B catalytic subunit. (A) In the co-translational pathway, preassembled
  glycan chains are covalently attached to the growing nascent chain (via STT3A) as
  it emerges from the luminal side of the ER translocon (cf. ). (B) In the strictly
  post-translational pathway completed precursor proteins transit the Sec61 translocon
  and are N-glycosylated during or after complete translocation into the ER lumen
  (via STT3B). Once attached to the polypeptide chain, N-glycans (G3M9) undergo a
  series of trimming reactions in the ER lumen (C) catalyzed by α-glycosidase enzymes
  which sequentially remove glucose and mannose residues. In the first instance, cleavage
  of the terminal α-1,2-glucose residue by α-glucosidase I (α-Glu I) liberates a di-glucosylated
  N-glycan (G2M9) which associates with a membrane-bound lectin called malectin whilst
  the polypeptide associates with the OST subunit ribophorin I (Rpn1) (). Following
  malectin-association, α-glucosidase II (α-Glu II) sequentially removes the two inner
  α-1,3-glucose residues. After the first cleavage by α-Glu II, resultant mono-glucosylated
  N-glycans (G1M9) are recognized by the ER luminal chaperones calreticulin (CRT)
  and calnexin (CNX) (not shown for simplicity), each in complex with the co-chaperone
  ERp57 () which helps prevent aggregation and aids in polypeptide folding. The second
  cleavage by α-Glu II removes the innermost glucose residue generating an N-glycan
  comprised only of mannose residues (M9). Removal of this final glucose residue precludes
  further N-glycan-mediated binding to the CNX/CRT complexes but selective re-glucosylation
  by UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) regenerates a G1M9 glycoform
  capable of rebinding CNX/CRT. Whilst exit from the CNX-CRT cycle is not fully understood,
  ER α-mannosidase I (ER Man I) removes a mannose residue (M8B) and, if the polypeptide
  has reached its native conformation, glycoproteins bearing M8B N-glycans are exported
  from the ER (which may be assisted by the lectin ERGIC-53) and progress through
  the secretory pathway. Terminally misfolded proteins, however, remain in the ER
  and are processed further by ER Man I and ER degradation-enhancing mannosidase-like
  proteins (EDEMs) (); i) ER Man I and/or EDEM2 recognize terminally misfolded proteins
  and trim a mannose residue to yield a M8B glycoform, ii) further mannose trimming
  of M8B by EDEMI together with EDEM3 and/or ER Man I generates M7, M6 and M5 N-glycans.
  Glycoproteins bearing these extensively trimmed N-glycans (assisted by the lectin
  OS9) are then targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (). Monosaccharide symbols
  follow the SNFG (Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans) system ().

  description: N-linked glycosylation in the ER. The multimeric oligosaccharyltransferase

    removes the two inner α-1,3-glucose residues. After the first cleavage by α-Glu
