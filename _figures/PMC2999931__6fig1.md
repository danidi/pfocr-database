caption: 'Presqualene cholesterol synthetic pathway. Cholesterol is synthesized from
  acetate in a series of enzymatic reactions. The biosynthetic pathway can be divided
  into two components. The presqualene cholesterol synthetic pathway is depicted in
  this figure. In addition to cholesterol, isoprenoid precursors are used to synthesize
  heme A, dolichol, and ubiquinone. Protein prenylation is a post-translational modification
  that involves the addition of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl. Protein prenylation
  plays a role in localizing proteins to cellular membranes. Formation of squalene
  represents a commitment to sterol synthesis. Squalene undergoes cyclization to form
  lanosterol, the first sterol in the cholesterol synthetic pathway. PP: pyrophosphate.'
