caption: Schematic representation showing that melatonin attenuates VSMC calcification
  through an AMPK/Drp1 signalling pathway. Melatonin activates AMPK expression, which
  in turn decreases Drp1 expression and, subsequently, inhibits mitochondrial fission.
  Suppression of mitochondrial fission reduces apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation
  and osteogenic differentiation. These effects subsequently inhibit VSMC calcification
