caption: A schema graph for the critical roles of KCs in the pathogenesis of ALD.
  Chronic ethanol exposure increases the gut permeability, resulting in translocation
  of gut endotoxin/LPS to liver. In liver, LPS leads to KCs activation via activating
  NOX and the TLR-4 pathway. Activated KCs produce a large amount of ROS, pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, and chemokines and induce the infiltration of other inflammatory cells.
  The ROS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the infiltration of other inflammatory
  cells finally cause liver injury. DPI, a NOX inhibitor, can significantly block
  ethanol-induced oxidative stress and the liver injury. In addition, chronic ethanol
  exposure can also sensitize the LPS-induced toxicity by increasing the half-life
  and cell surface receptor number of TNF-α, the expression of TLR-related co-receptors,
  and forming oxidative stress-related pro-inflammatory adducts, such as MAA adducts
  (MDA reacts with acetaldehyde and proteins to form hybrid protein adducts).
