caption: Summary of TNFR signalling. TNF-α has two receptors TNFR1 (R1) and TNFR2
  (R2) which are co-expressed on both neuronal and glial membranes. Activation of
  TNFR1 predominantly results in the initiation of caspases involved in apoptosis.
  For this reason, this receptor is known as the 'death receptor'. However, association
  of the death domain of this receptor with TRAF-2 can lead to the activation of NFkB
  gene transcription and upregulation of neuroprotective mediators such as the calcium
  chelator, calbindin, and the superoxide scavenger, manganese superoxide dismutase
  (MnSOD). This pathway is also shared with TNFR2 downstream signalling.
