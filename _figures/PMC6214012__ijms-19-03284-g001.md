caption: Transcriptional regulation by TH signaling. (A) Four major categories of
  gene regulation by TH. TH regulates gene transcription by a classical direct mechanism
  (Type 1 regulation), where liganded THRs heterodimerize with other nuclear receptors
  such as RXR, and recruit co-activators or co-repressors to directly activate or
  repress gene transcription, respectively. However, in Type 2 regulation, THRs do
  not bind directly to DNA and tether onto DNA by protein-protein interaction with
  other transcription factors. In Type 3 regulation, THRs do not require any binding
  to DNA and activate other transcription factors via non-genomic actions. In Type
  4 regulation, TH binds to protein receptors other than THRs and activates gene transcription
  by other transcription factors. (B) Alternative mechanisms for gene regulation by
  TH. THR interaction with other proteins (such as SIRT1) leads to its post-translational
  modification and activation of gene transcription (subtypes of Type 1, 3). Metabolic
  activation of upstream regulator proteins such as SIRT1 by TH leads to the activation
  of other downstream transcription factors such as FOXO1 (subtype of Type 1). The
  TH-PGC1α-ERRα pathway that regulates mitochondrial turnover can be considered a
  special subset of Type 1 transcriptional regulation with the addition of secondary
  (PGC1α) and tertiary (ERRα) transcription factors and nuclear hormone receptors
  serving as the primary, secondary, and tertiary mediators of transcription. THR-mediated
  regulation of microRNAs shows post-transcriptional regulation and comes under Types
  1, 2, or 3 depending on whether the mechanism involves the direct or indirect regulation
  of miRNA transcription.
