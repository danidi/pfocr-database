caption: Proposed signaling mechanism controlling COX-2 protein expression during
  ischemic PC. A sublethal ischemic stress (PC stimulus) induces phosphorylation of
  STAT1 and STAT3 on both Tyr and Ser residues. Tyr phosphorylation of STAT1/3 is
  mediated by a JAK-dependent mechanism, whereas Ser phosphorylation of these transcription
  factors is modulated by p44/42 MAPKs via PKCε-dependent activation of the Raf-1–
  MEK-1/2–p44/42 MAPK pathway during PC ischemia. On activation, phosphorylated STAT1/3
  translocate to the nucleus, where they promote transcription of the COX-2 gene,
  leading to the synthesis of COX-2 protein that is necessary for the development
  of delayed protection against myocardial infarction.
