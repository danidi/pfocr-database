caption: The pathway map of Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, and Tryptophan Biosynthesis (map
  00400) predicted in S. sclerotiorum and the DEGs enriched in the pathway induced
  by C. minitans. The italics are the genes putatively involved in the phenylalanine,
  tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis process. The numbers in the green block are
  the EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers in enzyme nomenclature databasehttps://enzyme.expasy.org/
  and were predicted to be encoded by genes presented near the green box. During the
  early interactional stages of S. sclerotiorum induced by C. minitans, the gene expression
  identified in the biosynthesis process was detected in the interactional transcriptome
  and confirmed by using qRT-PCR. In bar charts, the lines show the relative expression
  from RNA_seq and the bars represent the data from qRT-PCR. The gene expression of
  0 hpi was set as 1 and the error bar was calculated with three replications. The
  KEGG pathway of map00400 was download from https://www.kegg.jp/ and the gray oval
  frames are predicted to be the related pathways of the phenylalanine, tyrosine,
  and tryptophan biosynthesis process.
