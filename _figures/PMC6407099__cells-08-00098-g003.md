caption: Role of Itch in canonical Hh pathway. (A) Model of the Numb/Itch-dependent
  regulation of GLI1 activity. Numb binds WW2 domain of Itch, releases Itch from its
  close-inactive conformation, thus allowing the recruitment of GLI1 and its degradation.
  In cancer, loss of Numb impairs this process enhancing GLI1 activity and promoting
  cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. (B) Model of the β-arrestin2/Itch-dependent
  regulation of the SuFu function. Itch, in complex with β-arrestin2, binds and ubiquitylates
  SuFu. This event does not lead to SuFu degradation but increases the association
  between SuFu and GLI3 promoting the generation of GLI3 repressor form (GLI3R) and
  inhibiting Hh signalling. Alterations in this mechanism, caused by SuFu mutations
  that make it insensitive to Itch-dependent ubiquitylation, are responsible for MB
  development.
