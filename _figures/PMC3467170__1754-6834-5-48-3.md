caption: 'Different metabolic pathways for metabolism of glycerol. Production of 1,3-PDO
  by Enterobacteriaceae family members is shown in red. DHA production by G. oxydans
  is shown in blue. Ethanol and formate production pathways in the fermentative utilization
  of glycerol by E. coli are shown in gray. Proposed pathway for the conversion of
  glycerol to glyceric acid is shown in green. Dashed lines indicate multiple steps
  or unknown enzyme(s) (GA pathway). Main products are highlighted in color- filled
  boxes. Abbreviations: GLY, glycerol; GLY-Dhd, GLY dehydrogenase; DHA, dihydroxyacetone;
  DHA-Kin, DHA kinase; DHAP, DHA phosphate; PYR, pyruvate; GLY-Dht, GLY dehydratase;
  3HPA, 3-hydroxyapropionaldehyde; 1,3-PDO-Dhd, 1,3-PDO dehydrogenase; GLY-DhdE, membrane-bound
  GLY-Dhd; GLY-Kin, GLY kinase, G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate, G3P-Dhd, G3P dehydrogenase;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; mAdh: membrane-bound
  alcohol dehydrogenase.'
