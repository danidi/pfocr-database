caption: Schematic for MSCs polarisation under TNF-α stimulation; a) TNF-α binding
  to TNFR-1, then activating NF-κβ and ERK signalling which produces COX2 and (b)
  upregulate TLR-4 expression leading to polarise MSCs into MSCs type-1 that exhibit
  proinflammatory profile; c) COX-2 upregulation resulting in the increase of PGE2
  secretion. The binding accumulation of PGE2 to EP2 and EP4 receptors of MSCs triggering
  the shift of MyD88-dependent proinflammatory (MyD88-independent pathway) to TRIF-TRAM
  mediated anti-inflammatory signal by a P110δ isoform of the PI3k kinase, then repolarise
  to MSCs type 2 (anti-inflammatory phenotype) and inducing TRAF3-IRF3 resulting in
  IL-10 secretion. IL-10 inhibit NF-κβ/IKκβ cytoplasmic and NF-κβ nucleic then control
  the inflammatory milieu leading to the strong TGF-β secretion
