caption: B cell-derived cytokines direct the ensuing immune response. Antigen-specific
  immune responses are perpetuated by collaboration of T and B cells in germinal centers,
  the formation of which is dependent on production of lymphotoxin α and TNF by activated
  B cells. The cytokines present during antigen presentation to T cells determine
  their effector phenotype. In the presence of IL-4, T cells follow the Th2 maturation
  pathway, which is involved in allergic responses and protective in MS. Expression
  of IL-12 or TGFβ and IL-6 by APCs lead to differentiation of proinflammatory Th1
  and Th17 cells, respectively, which are pathogenic in animal models of MS. These
  proinflammatory cells can be inhibited by IL-10, produced by APCs and a subset of
  regulatory T cells.
