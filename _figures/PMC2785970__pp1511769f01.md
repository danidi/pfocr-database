caption: Suggested pathways of starch synthesis in leaves, redrawn from Muñoz et al.
  (2006). A, Classical model. Starch synthesis is directly linked to the Calvin cycle.
  All enzymatic reactions to convert triose-P to ADPGlc take place in the chloroplast.
  Suc synthesis proceeds in the cytosol starting with triose-P exported from the chloroplast.
  Starch synthesis and degradation do not occur simultaneously. B, New model. Suc
  is an intermediate of starch synthesis. ADPGlc is primarily synthesized by SuSy.
  Starch is continuously synthesized and degraded. Plastidial enzymes including PGM
  function to recycle Glc released by degradation back into starch synthesis. Dashed
  arrows indicate more than one enzymatic step. HXK, Plastidial hexokinase; ESD, enzymes
  of starch degradation.
