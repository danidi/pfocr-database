caption: Signaling pathways that modulate amino acid, insulin/IGF-I, and resistance
  exercise–induced activation of mTORC1 signaling. Hormones such as insulin and IGF-I
  signal to mTORC1 through Akt- and ERK1/2-dependent inactivation of TSC1/2 GAP activity,
  leading to enhanced GTP-loading of Rheb at late endosomal/lysosomal membranes. Amino
  acids promote GTP loading of RagA/B by both inhibiting Ragulator GAP activity and
  stimulating GATOR GEF activity. Ragulator also acts to localize the Rag complex
  to the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane. The binding of mTORC1 to the Rag complex
  allows it to interact with Rheb-GTP and become active. The signaling pathway or
  pathways through which resistance exercise acts to stimulate mTORC1 signaling is
  less clear, with Akt, ERK, and phosphatidic acid all playing possible roles. c7orf59,
  chromosome 7 open reading frame 59; ERK, extracellular-regulated protein kinase;
  GAP, GTPase activator protein; GATOR, GAP activity toward Rags; GEF, guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; mLST8, lethal with SEC13 protein
  8; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; mTORC, mTOR complex; Rag, Ras-related
  GTP binding; raptor, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, complex 1; Rheb, ras
  homolog enriched in brain; Sec13, secretory 13; TBC1D7, ubiquitin specific peptide
  6 (Trc-2)/budding uninhibited by benzimidazole/cell division cycle; TSC, tuberous
  sclerosis complex.
