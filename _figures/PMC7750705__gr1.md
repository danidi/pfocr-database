caption: Roles of MGO in modulating cell signaling pathways, host immunity, and antiviral
  activity. MGO induces autophagy through activating AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) [, ]. Autophagy and autophagy associated proteins might play anti-viral and
  proviral roles in viral replication and pathogenesis [, ]. NF-κB and iNOS could
  be activated by the treatment of MGO in retinal pericytes []. NF-κB associated proteins
  regulate cell survival, division, and proliferation thereby modulates various aspects
  of innate and adaptive immune responses []. Besides, NF-κB activation may contribute
  to the antiviral immune pathway []. MGO effectively inhibits the influenza virus
  replication in the cell culture system, can induce apoptosis by inhibiting c-FLIPL
  expression through decreasing of p65 [,]. Influenza virus-infected apoptotic mouse
  cells were engulfed by macrophages and neutrophils which proved the involvement
  of the apoptosis process in antiviral innate immune mechanism [].
