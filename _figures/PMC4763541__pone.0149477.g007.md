caption: In the absence of Shh signaling (left), Ptch1 localizes to the PC and suppresses
  Smo translocation to PC. The proteolytically processed repressor forms of Gli (GliR)
  accumulate and enter the nucleus to inhibit target gene expression. In the presence
  of Shh (right), Pifo and Gprasp2 rapidly form a Smo ciliary targeting complex. This
  can be transported to the PC from 1. intracellular pools or 2. via lateral plasma
  membrane transport or 3. via the recycling endosome pathway. Smo transport into
  the PC is mediated through the kinesine II motor complex leading to accumulation
  of Gli activator forms (GliA) in the cytoplasm and nucleus for Shh target gene activation.
