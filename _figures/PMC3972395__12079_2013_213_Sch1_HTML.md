caption: Diagram outlining the sequential reactions on a SERCA catalytic and transport
  cycle as explained in the text above. The solid lines indicate the optimal pathway
  of a well coupled ATP utilization and net Ca2+. The dotted lines indicate a short
  cut of the enyme cycle, whereby ATP utilization is uncoupled from net Ca2+ transport,
  as explained in the text above

  the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase.
