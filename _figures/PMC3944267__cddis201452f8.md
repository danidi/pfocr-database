caption: Proposed mechanism for the differential response of tenocytes to oxidative
  stress under different extracellular glucose concentrations. Oxidative stress results
  in upregulation of both FOXO1 as well as HIF1α. Under high-glucose conditions, miR28-5p
  levels are also upregulated, particularly in oxidative stress-exposed cells. miR28-5p
  directly inhibits expression of the p53 deacetylase sirtuin 3, allowing accumulation
  of acetylated p53. FOXO1 promotes transcription of bim, the gene product of which
  is a proapoptotic protein. p53 inhibits expression of miR17-92, a cluster of miRNAs
  including the bim repressor miR17-5p. Downregulation of miR17-92 by p53 coupled
  with increased bim transcription by FOXO1 allows accumulation of bim RNA levels
  and increased bim-mediated apoptosis. Under low-glucose conditions, however, the
  miR28-5p–sirt3-p53 pathway is not stimulated. Instead, p38 MAPK is activated and
  acts on both FOXO1 and HIF1α, resulting in the inhibition of FOXO1 transcriptional
  activity and activation of HIF1α. HIF1α promotes the expression of sox9 and scleraxis,
  two genes whose products are essential for tenocyte differentiation
