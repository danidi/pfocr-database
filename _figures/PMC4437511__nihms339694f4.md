caption: Proteins from known pathways localized to the Trichomonas vaginalis hydrogensome.
  A) Iron-Sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly pathway. Proteins involved in Fe-S cluster
  assembly were identified in the hydrogenosome proteome (dark grey); some proteins
  not present in the proteome have been identified in the genome (light grey). B)
  Proteins involved in oxygen stress response were also identified in the hydrogensome
  proteome (dark grey). Only one protein, TrxR (light grey), known to be involved
  in this pathway, was not found in the proteome.

papertitle: The Trichomonas vaginalis hydrogenosome proteome is highly reduced relative
  to mitochondria, yet complex compared with mitosomes.
