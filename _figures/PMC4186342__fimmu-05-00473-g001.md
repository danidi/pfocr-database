caption: Trafficking of TLR4. A simplified schematic of TLR4 trafficking in the early
  secretory and endocytic pathways. (1) Upon translation, folding, and glycosylation
  of the protein in the ER, nascent TLR4 is recognized by TMED7 cargo receptor to
  be trafficked anterogradely in COP II-coated vesicles toward the Golgi complex ().
  (2) Following maturation within the Golgi complex, mature TLR4, along with MD2 (not
  shown in diagram), is transported to the cell surface via vesicular trafficking
  that is Rab10 dependent (). (3) Alternatively, mature TLR4 can be translocated to
  endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) where it forms a distinct intracellular pool
  of receptors that can recognize phagocytosed Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli
  (). From here, activated TLR4 can mount innate immune responses intracellularly
  independent of the cell surface receptor. It is likely that the ERC also act as
  a recycling organelle for new and old receptors back to the cell surface to resensitize
  the cell. (4) Finally, upon receptor activation on the cell surface, receptor is
  endocytosed into early endosome where TRIF/TRAM pathway is initiated. Eventually,
  the early endosome matures into late endosome fuse with the lysosome where the receptor
  will be degraded to terminate the signaling. This process is Rab7b-dependent.
