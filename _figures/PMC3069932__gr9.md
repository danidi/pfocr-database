caption: 'Proposed role of Nodal in human placental development and mechanism of Nodal-regulated
  trophoblast invasion. A: In normal placenta, high expression of Nodal/ALK7 during
  the first trimester of pregnancy inhibits trophoblast proliferation and invasion
  and may also play a role in syncytialization. The subsequent decrease in Nodal/ALK7
  levels will allow higher proliferation and invasion of trophoblast cells. The pathway
  may interact with other stimulatory and inhibitory signaling pathways to ensure
  normal placentation. In preeclamptic placenta, Nodal and ALK7 are overexpressed.
  The aberrant up-regulation of this pathway may result in limited trophoblast invasion
  and excessive apoptosis, thereby contributing to the development of preeclampsia.
  B: Nodal acts through the ALK7 and Smad2/3 pathway to induced TIMP-1 secretion,
  which, in turn, inhibits MMP-2/9 activity, leading to a decrease in cell invasion.
  Other pathways involved remain to be identified. ActRII, activin receptor II.'
