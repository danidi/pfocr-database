caption: 'Major in vivo approaches for tolerance induction and suppression of inhibitor
  formation in hemophilia. (A) Administration of the widely used clinical immunosuppressant,
  rapamycin, results in the selective deletion of CD4+ T-helper cells and enrichment
  of FoxP3+regulatory T cell (Treg), exploiting differential use of the mTOR pathway.
  (B) Oral tolerance by lettuce encapsulated clotting factor leads to the suppression
  of inhibitors by at least two subsets of Treg: CD4+CD25−LAP+FoxP3− and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+
  Treg. Antigen presentation by gut resident CD103+ dendritic cell (DC), as well as
  plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), supports Treg induction. (C) Hepatic gene transfer by adeno-associated
  viral (AAV) or lentiviral vector induces tolerance by multiple mechanisms, which
  include programmed cell death of CD4+ T-helper cells and the induction of FoxP3+
  Treg. An important role for initial antigen presentation in the liver draining portal/celiac
  lymph nodes by professional as well as liver resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
  is indicated.'
