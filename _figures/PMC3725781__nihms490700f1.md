caption: Multipotent mesenchymal precursors in condensed mesenchymes differentiate
  into Sox9-expressing osteochondroprogenitors, which segregate into chondrocytes
  that express high levels of Sox9, and preosteoblasts that express high levels of
  Runx2 and low level of Col1a1 and Akp. Osx expression is needed to accomplish the
  differentiation of preosteoblasts to mature and functional osteoblasts that express
  high levels of osteoblast markers including Col1a1, Akp, Bsp, and Oc. Osx controls
  the genetic program of osteoblast differentiation (shown in light blue area). Functional
  osteoblasts produce extracellular matrix molecules which form a calcified bone matrix.
  Osx-null cells are arrested in their differentiation and acquire chondrocytes phenotype
  by expressing chrondrocyte markers. The molecular control of Osx is depicted in
  light yellow area. Expression of Osx mRNA and protein is positively regulated by
  signaling pathways (BMP2, MAPK, Igf1), Runx2, Dlx5, ER-stress pathway (IRE1a/XBP1),
  and negatively regulated by DNA methylation and microRNAs, p53, and TNF. The transcriptional
  activity of Osx is documented by NFATc as positive regulator and by NO66 histone
  demethylase as negative regulator.
