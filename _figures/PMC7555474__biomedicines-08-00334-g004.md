caption: Rap1 regulates integrin-dependent biological processes in cancers. Integrin,
  the main cell adhesion receptor for the extracellular matrix (ECM), exists in different
  conformational states, and thus leads to the difference in its receptor affinity.
  An inactivated integrin (bent and closed) is associated with a low affinity for
  ECM ligand, whereas the active form (open) integrin is capable of binding to the
  ligand and clustering on the plasma membrane (adhesion). Integrin adhesion activates
  signaling pathway such as Src/FAK to promote cytoskeletal remodeling, tumor migration,
  invasion, and metastasis. Integrin activation can be inhibited by Rap1GAP directly
  or indirectly. Solid arrow indicates direct causative effect while dotted arrow
  indicates indirect causative effect.
