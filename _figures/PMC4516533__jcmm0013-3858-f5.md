caption: Proposed model for EGFR-related signal transduction pathways regulating Snail
  in Ishikawa (A), Ishikawa ER- (B) and primary human endometrial tumours (C). EGF
  stimulates pathways leading to Snail’s localization into the nucleus as well as
  pathways involved in reduced degradation of the protein. Snail shuttles into the
  nucleus after phosphorylation on Ser 246 by an unknown pathway, possibly with involvement
  of p38 MAPK, AKT, ERK1/2 and/or PAK1. After phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Serin 9
  by AKT, GSK-3β is unable to phosphorylate and tag Snail for ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation. Our data clearly demonstrate that cell lines cannot fully reflect the
  activation status of signalling pathways in primary cancers. In the future, novel
  cancer treatments should target not only one but several signalling pathways.
