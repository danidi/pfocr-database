caption: 'Gene sets with significantly different mRNA expression in skeletal muscle
  after 36 h fasting vs control study (horizontally) and in LBW vs NBW men (vertically).
  Metabolism KEGG pathways are coloured by subgroup: Energy (dark blue), Carbohydrate
  (light blue), Amino acid (purple), Glycan biosynthesis, Cofactors and vitamins and
  Terpenoids and polyketides (grey). Human diseases pathways are not included in the
  figure. *Pathway regulated in the same direction in response to fasting in LBW and
  NBW men. LBW, low birth weight; NBW, normal birth weight.'
