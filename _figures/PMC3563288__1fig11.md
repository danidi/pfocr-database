caption: The cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway involved in germination of spores
  in A. nidulans. The presence of a carbon source is sensed by a GPCR that activates
  the Gα subunit GanB. GanB-GTP activates adenylate cyclase CyaA that produces cyclic
  adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA (PKAR),
  thus releasing the catalytic subunit PkaA. Active PkaA phosphorylates downstream
  targets resulting in swelling, germ tube formation and trehalose degradation. PkaA
  and PkaB have an overlapping role in spore germination in the presence of glucose
  but an opposite role in germination in the absence of a carbon source.
