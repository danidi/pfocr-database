caption: Stalk cells use fatty acid oxidation and amino acid metabolism for biomass
  synthesis. Like all endothelial cells, stalk cells rely heavily on glycolysis for
  ATP production. Fatty acid oxidation and amino acid metabolism are required to produce
  the macromolecules necessary for stalk cell proliferation. Carbon derived from fatty
  acid oxidation and glutamine catabolism contribute to nucleotide synthesis while
  glutamine and asparagine catabolism contribute to both protein synthesis and maintenance
  of redox homeostasis. The intracellular serine synthesis pathway links glucose metabolism
  with amino acid metabolism in stalk cells for the production of NTPs as well as
  heme synthesis, which maintains mitochondrial function and controls ROS production.
