caption: NK cells show diversified responses in the presence of IL-10. (A) Alone,
  reduced expression of IFN-γ and granzyme B, in addition to its ability to prevent
  apoptosis via STAT3 signaling pathway. (B) In combination with IL-15, increased
  expression of IL-10. (C) The virokine cmvIL-10 mediates NK cells activation which
  resulted in enhanced IFN-γ expression.
