caption: (A) Cell type and molecular regulation. DAF-16 promotes intestinal PUFA biosynthesis
  through increased expression of fat genes and inhibits yolk lipoprotein complex
  formation required to transport PUFAs to oocytes. Increased DAF-16 activity shifts
  the PG balance, favoring those PGs requiring de novo PUFA synthesis over those requiring
  PUFA transport to distant sites. Yolk provides oocytes with PUFAs for synthesizing
  F-series PGs that promote sperm guidance. PUFAs negatively regulate DAF-16 to promote
  oocyte yolk endocytosis and PG synthesis. See text for additional details.(B) Prostaglandin
  synthesis machinery in mammals and predicted C. elegans pathway. The C. elegans
  genome encodes homologs of mammalian enzymes that synthesize and modify PGs, with
  the lone exception being PG G/H synthase. Red color indicates steps required for
  sperm guidance, based on genetic or biochemical studies (this study and ). Red arrows
  indicate biochemically conserved steps. See text for additional details.
