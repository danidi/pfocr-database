caption: Enterohepatic circulation of the bile. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol
  in the hepatocytes. CYP7A1 regulates the rate-limiting step in the classic bile
  acid biosynthetic pathway. Bile acids are secreted into the gallbladder via BSEP.
  Phospholipids are transported via MDR2, and cholesterol is transported by the ABCG5/G8
  transporters into the bile. In the gallbladder, bile acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol
  form mixed micelles to solubilize cholesterol and to reduce bile acid toxicity.
  After meal intake, gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine where bile
  acids facilitate the absorption of dietary lipids and vitamins. At the terminal
  ileum, most of the bile acids are reabsorbed by ASBT into the enterocytes, and secreted
  into the portal circulation via basolateral bile acid transporters Ostα/Ostβ. At
  the basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes, bile acids are taken up by the NTCP
  transporter for resecretion into the gallbladder.
