caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of NOX4 contribution in
  psoriatic plaque formation. Healthy primary fibroblasts, as well as fibroblasts
  obtained from visibly unaffected skin of psoriatic patients, activate ERK1/2, increase
  intracellular total ROS level and accelerate cell cycle progression in healthy primary
  keratinocytes in co-culture through the redox signalling mediated by NOX4. Fibroblasts
  obtained from unaffected and lesional skin of psoriatic patients differ from healthy
  fibroblasts by elevated mitochondrial superoxide anion production and decreased
  total antioxidant capacity. Moreover, lesional fibroblasts display significantly
  higher levels of intracellular •NO, Ca2+ and lipid peroxidation as well as elevated
  NOX4 activity and extracellular ROS production. Lesional fibroblasts induce significantly
  higher levels of intracellular ROS and ERK activation in healthy keratinocytes with
  respect to healthy and unaffected psoriatic fibroblasts. Moreover, co-culture with
  lesional fibroblasts induced •NO and Ca2+ accumulation in keratinocytes and significant
  activation of p38 molecular pathway. The result of these metabolic alterations is
  keratinocytes hyper-proliferation. Hence, dermal fibroblasts may trigger keratinocytes
  proliferation through NOX4-mediated redox signalling.
