caption: Interaction of Leptospira interrogans with the innate immune system. (A)
  L. interrogans are diderm bacteria. Their cell wall is composed of an inner membrane
  (IM) and an outer membrane (OM) containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In between
  the membranes, the periplasmic space (PS) contains the peptidoglycan (PG) layer,
  the periplasmic flagella (PF) that extends from each pole of the cell inside the
  PS and lipoproteins such as LipL32. Notably, leptospires contain in their OM a broad
  repertoire of lipoproteins and a glycolipoprotein (GLP) (). (B) Host cells have
  a variety of mechanisms to detect microbes. One of them involves a subset of receptors
  collectively known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense conserved
  and ubiquitously expressed microbial components. The latter are known as microbial-associated
  molecular patterns (MAMPs). Recognition of MAMPs by PRRs triggers the immune response.
  In blue, leptospiral MAMPs and MAMP sensing in human (left side panel) and mouse
  (right side panel) cells are shown. TLR2 is the main receptor for sensing leptospires,
  which is common in humans and mice. TLR2 heterodimerizes with TLR1 and detects triacylated
  lipoproteins. A major difference between sensitive humans and resistant mice is
  the specific sensing of the leptospiral LPS (), a major leptospiral MAMP and virulence
  factor (). Mouse TLR4 but not human TLR4 is able to detect it (–). However, the
  stimulation of mouse TLR4 by leptospiral LPS is only partial, since only the MyD88
  pathway but not the TRIF pathway is activated. This results in only minimal production
  of antimicrobial components such as nitric oxide (). Due to the presence of PF in
  leptospires, live leptospires also escape TLR5 recognition. However, once leptospires
  are killed by antimicrobial peptides that expose PF, leptospiral flagellins are
  recognized by human (and bovine) TLR5 but not by mouse TLR5 (). Leptospires have
  been described to induce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in both humans and
  mice. In mice, activation of the inflammasome requires 2-step signaling involving
  LPS and lipoprotein signaling through TLR4 and TLR2, respectively, in combination
  with the downregulation of a Na/K pump (a danger signal) by GLP (). In humans, NLRP3
  activation is mediated by bacteria-induced ROS (). Finally, PG from leptospires
  escapes host recognition by NOD1 and NOD2 due to the lipoprotein LipL21, which is
  tightly attached to the PG. In addition, human but not murine NOD1 can detect leptospiral
  PG in the absence of LipL21 ().
