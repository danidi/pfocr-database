caption: The mTOR pathway regulates signal-dependent translation in human neutrophils
  activated via the PAF receptor. (A) Freshly isolated PMNs were activated with 100
  nM PAF for 30 min followed by staining for mTOR. (B) The peptide immunogen against
  which the anti-mTOR antibody was raised completely quenched the immunofluorescent
  staining. (C) Components of the mTOR pathway in human neutrophils activated by PAF
  (also see ). S6K1 and related members of this family are also called p70S6 kinases.
  In other cell types, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) lies upstream of mTOR
  and may also mediate parallel signaling to S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (), but this has not
  been formally demonstrated for signaling to the mTOR pathway via the PAF receptor.
