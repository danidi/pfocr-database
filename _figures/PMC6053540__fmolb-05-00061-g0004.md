caption: Biogenesis of miR-451. (A) Sequence and secondary structure of human pre-miR-451.
  The location of Drosha and Ago2 cleavage are noted. Uridylation and 3′ trimming
  ultimately give rise to mature miR-451 as denoted in red font. (B) Biogenesis of
  miR-451 compared to canonical miRNA biogenesis. Compared to the canonical pathway
  wherein pre-miRNA is processed by Dicer, miR-451 undergoes Ago-2 cleavage that allows
  for processing to yield mature miR-451 independently of Dicer.
