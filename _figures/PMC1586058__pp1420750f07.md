caption: Possible involvement of PLDζ1/2 in the PC hydrolysis and DGDG accumulation
  during phosphorus starvation. In this scheme, DAG is shown to be generated by three
  pathways, the PLD pathway, the PLC pathway, and the de novo pathway. In the PLD
  pathway, PC is hydrolyzed by PLDζs to PA, and then PA is further hydrolyzed by purple
  acid phosphatase (PAP) to DAG and inorganic phosphorus under severe phosphorus-limited
  conditions. Under moderate phosphorus deficiency conditions, PLDζ1 and PLDζ2 might
  function to modulate root growth for better nutritional absorption by increasing
  PA to stimulate root growth. In the PLC pathway, PC is hypothesized to be hydrolyzed
  to DAG. DAG can be used as a substrate by MGD2/3 to produce MGDG, from which DGDG
  is synthesized by DGD1/2.
