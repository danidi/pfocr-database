caption: Working hypotheses to trigger nuclear Ca2+Different pathways to generate
  nuclear Ca2+ signals have been proposed. In 1 (left), the binding of an agonist
  to its transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) produces InsP3 (IP3) in the
  cytosol. IP3 diffuses to the nucleus and binds to the high-affinity, type II InsP3R
  (IP3R-II), located along the nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR), to release Ca2+ in the
  nucleoplasm. In 2 (middle), the binding of a growth factor to a receptor tyrosine
  kinase (TKR) may result in the translocation of the receptor to the nucleus to generate
  nuclear IP3. IP3 binds to the IP3R to release Ca2+ in the nucleoplasm. The topology
  of internalized TRK is not known, and the cartoon shows TKR as being inside the
  vesicle merely for simplicity. In 3 (right), another putative pathway is initiated
  following the binding of a hormone to GPCR at the plasma membrane. The IP3 generated
  within the cytosol can release Ca2+ from the endo-/sarcoplasmic reticulum, and Ca2+
  may reach the nucleus to trigger Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release by activating the ryanodine
  receptor (RyR) in the NR.
