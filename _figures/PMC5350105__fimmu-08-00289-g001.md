caption: 'M1 macrophage metabolism. M1 macrophage metabolism is characterized by enhanced
  aerobic glycolysis, converting glucose into lactate. M1 macrophages have an increased
  flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), generating NADPH, used for the
  generation of the anti-oxidant glutathione (GSH) and the inflammatory mediators
  nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In M1 macrophages, the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle is broken in two places, leading to the accumulation of succinate
  and citrate. While the accumulation of succinate leads to HIF-1α stabilization and
  the transcription of pro-inflammatory and glycolytic genes, citrate is used for
  the generation of fatty acids, NO, ROS, and the synthesis of itaconate. Another
  aspect of M1 macrophage metabolism is the conversion of l-arginine to NO and l-citrulline.
  All important metabolic reactions present in M1/M2 macrophages are shown in black,
  reactions shown in gray are absent or less pronounced. The metabolic pathways strongly
  upregulated by M1/M2 macrophage polarization are highlighted by a colored shadow,
  the width of the shadow illustrates the weight of a particular pathway in the macrophage
  activation state. All metabolic enzymes are indicated in green. Dotted lines represent
  impaired metabolic reactions. Abbreviations: α-KG: α-ketoglutarate; AASS: aspartate–arginosuccinate
