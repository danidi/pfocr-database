caption: microRNAs (miRNAs) function during differentiation of epidermal stem cells
  into cells of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE). miR-205 and miR-125 promote self-renewal
  of epidermal stem cells but are downregulated during differentiation. miR-205 suppresses
  multiple inhibitors of the PI3K–AKT pathway, thereby promoting AKT signalling. By
  contrast, miR-203, upregulated during differentiation, targets genes that encode
  proteins that promote cell cycle progression (SKP2, p63, MSI2 and VAV3) thereby
  inducing cell cycle exit. miRNAs highly expressed in stem cells and differentiated
  progeny are outlined in orange and red, respectively.
