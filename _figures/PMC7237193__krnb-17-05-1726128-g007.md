caption: Regulatory network of let-7 is associated with the metabolism of glucose,
  fatty acids and amino acids in the silk gland. (A) Trehalose enters the silk gland
  cells and is converted into glucose. (B) let-7 knockout led to enhanced pentose
  phosphate pathway. (C) Knockout of let-7 promoted Embden-meyerhof pathway. (D) 3-phosphoglyceric
  acid was partly converted into amino acids as raw material for protein synthesis.
  (E) TCA cycle was promoted. (F) Gluconeogenesis pathway was weakened. (G) OAA and
  acetyl-CoA were replenished by CP cycle. (H) Synthesis metabolism of fatty acids
  was enhanced. (I) Fatty acid beta oxidation was enhanced. The red arrow shows the
  up-regulated gene and the blue arrow means the down-regulated gene. The abbreviations
  of Fig.7 are detailed in Table S3.
