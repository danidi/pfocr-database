caption: Schematic representation of the central role of C1 inhibitor in various plasma
  systems.,  Upon contact with negatively charged surfaces factor XII (FXII) is (auto‐)
  activated to activated factor XIIa (FXIIa). FXIIa activates the circulating complex
  of plasma prekallikrein (PK) with high‐molecular‐weight kininogen (HK). FXIIa activates
  PK to kallikrein (KK), which in turn can activate FXII to generate more FXIIa (positive
  feedback). Prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) has also been shown to activate PK to KK.
  FXIIa can activate the classical pathway of complement as well as FXI from the intrinsic
  pathway of coagulation. KK is able to cleave single chain HK to two‐chain HK (tc‐HK)
  thereby releasing bradykinin (BK), which causes angioedema. In addition, KK can
  directly activate plasminogen (Plg) to plasmin (Pl) or indirectly by the activation
  of urokinase‐type plasminogen activator (u‐PA). C1‐inhibitor (C1‐Inh) occupies central
  regulatory roles in these processes as it inhibits FXIIa and KK, respectively. In
  addition it regulates the classical pathway of complement (via C1s/r), coagulation
  via FXIa and fibrinolysis via plasmin, respectively
