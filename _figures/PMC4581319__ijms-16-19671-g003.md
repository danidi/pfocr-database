number: Figure 3
caption: Proposed model of the complex interplay between hormones and cellular growth
  regulators during root growth. In each zone of the root, hormones induce specific
  regulatory processes that influence cell cycle progression or cell expansion (see
  main text for details). Bar 50 µm.
