caption: The ethanol-induced decrease in α-MSH drive and its impact on glial inflammation
  and hemichannel/pannexon-dependent gliotransmission. (A) At one end, ethanol reduces
  the brain levels of α-MSH (1), decreasing the MC4R-mediated anti-inflammatory drive
  of melanocortin (MC) system on microglia (2). In parallel, ethanol stimulates TLR4Rs
  (3), resulting in the activation of NF-κβ pathway and further autocrine/paracrine
  release of TNF-α, (which acts upon its receptor TNFR1 (4). The latter leads to the
  activation of glutaminase and the consequent release of glutamate through Cx32 hemichannels
  (HCs) (5). Similarly, NF-κβ signaling promotes the autocrine/paracrine release of
  IL-1β, which stimulates its receptor as well as accessory proteins (IL1RI and IL1RAcP)
  (6), resulting in iNOS activation, NO production, COX activation and PGE2 production
  via unknown mechanisms. PGE2 released by microglia binds to the EP1 metabotropic
  receptor (not depicted) to elicit Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (7). This
  release increases [Ca2+]i, which is known to open Cx43 HCs and Panx1 channels (CHs)
  and subsequently the release glutamate and ATP through them. Furthermore, protein-to-protein
  interactions between Panx1 CHs and P2X7Rs trigger the signaling that activate the
  inflammasome (9), perpetuating the cycle of maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory
  mediators (e.g., IL-1β), as well as the uncontrolled release of gliotransmitters
  during ethanol consumption. (B) As with microglia, decreased levels of α-MSH caused
  by ethanol (1), blunt the MC4R-mediated anti-inflammatory drive of MC system on
  astrocytes (2). At the same time, ethanol activates TLR4Rs (3) and NF-κβ pathways,
  establishing the interrelated autocrine/paracrine release of TNF-α (4) and IL-1β
  (5), similar to what described for microglia. The latter results in the activation
  of p38 MAP kinase and NO production, as well as the opening of Cx43 hemichannels
  via s-nitrosylation of Cx43 and release of taurine and glutamate (6). Increases
  in [Ca2+]i, which is known to open Panx1 CHs may also evoke the release glutamate
  through them. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines released from microglia could
  potentiate the activation of these pathways, perpetuating the dysfunctional release
  of gliotransmitters during ethanol consumption (7).)
