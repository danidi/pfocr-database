caption: KCNQ1OT1 regulates CMEC injury and inflammatory response by RUNX3 through
  DNMT1-dependent methylation after MI. KCNQ1OT1 is highly expressed in MI mice. KCNQ1OT1
  recruits DNMT1 to RUNX3 promoter region to promote RUNX3 methylation and down-regulate
  RUNX3 expression, thereby activating Notch signaling pathway, causing inflammation,
  inhibiting the proliferation of CMECs, and promoting the injury and apoptosis of
  CMECs. CD, coding sequence.
