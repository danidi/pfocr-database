caption: Under conditions of normoxia, the majority of cellular oxygen consumption
  occurs in the mitochondria during the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation,
  although some spare non-mitochondrial oxygen is available. Non-mitochondrial oxygen
  is utilized by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylase enzymes to hydroxylate
  HIFα, resulting in its repression through targeted ubiquitylation by the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase von Hipple–Lindau disease tumour suppressor (pVHL), which results in proteasomal
  degradation and transcriptional repression by factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) (left
  side). In hypoxia, the absence of non-mitochondrial oxygen results in hydroxylase
  inhibition, the derepression of HIF and the activation of an adaptive transcriptional
  response (right side). CBP, CREB-binding protein; HRE, hypoxia response element;
  p300, histone acetyltransferase p300; PHD, prolyl hydroxylation domain; pO2, partial
  pressure of oxygen; Ub, ubiquitin.
