caption: MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway and its regulation by Smad proteins.
  (A) The miRNA biogenesis pathway. The biogenesis of a miRNA is a stepwise process
  that includes (1) transcription of a primary transcript (pri-miRNA), (2) nuclear
  cropping to produce the precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA), (3) export to the cytoplasm,
  and (4) cytoplasmic cropping to a double-stranded (ds) miRNA precursor. miRNA genes
  are generally transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as long, 5′-capped and 3′-polyadenylated
  transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that are processed by the RNase III enzyme, Drosha, in
  the microprocessor complex to generate hairpin-loop RNAs, known as pre-miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs
  are recognized by the exportin 5 (Xpo5)/Ran-GTP transporter and exported to the
  cytoplasm, where another enzyme of the RNase III family, Dicer, catalyzes secondary
  processing (“dicing”) to produce miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. Dicer, TRBP, and Argonaute
  (Ago) proteins mediate the processing of pre-miRNAs and the assembly of the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC) in mammalian cells. Ago proteins associate with Dicer in
  both the cropping and RISC assembly steps (). (From ; adapted, with permission,
  from the authors.) (B) Transcription of miRNA genes can be regulated by TGF-β and
  BMP signaling pathways either by a direct binding of Smad complex (R-Smad/co-Smad)
  to Smad-binding element (SBE) in the promoter regions of miRNA genes or by transcriptional
  regulation of other transcription factors, which, in turn, modulate the transcription
  of miRNA genes. (C) Pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA processing of a subset of miRNAs catalyzed
  by Drosha and its cofactors p68 and p72 is positively regulated by transcription
  factors, such as R-Smad and p53, and negatively regulated by YAP, a signal transducer
  of the Hippo pathway. Specific binding of R-Smads to a dsRNA sequence motif located
  in the pre-miRNA provides specificity of this regulation. TF, Transcription factor.
