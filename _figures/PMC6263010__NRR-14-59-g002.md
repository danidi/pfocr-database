caption: 'Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-dependent morphological, cellular and molecular alterations
  in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Ptch1+/– mice.Schematic model in which Shh pathway
  activation positively feeds into the activities of the Notch signaling pathway resulting
  in upregulation of TLX, a direct target of Notch1/recombining binding protein suppressor
  of hairless (RBPJ), positively regulated by Sex determining region Y (SRY) box 2
  (Sox2) and overexpressed in the DG of Ptch1+/– mice. TLX is a critical transcription
  factors for balancing neural stem cells (NSCs) maintenance with neuronal differentiation
  and its upregulation is likely to promote neurogenic division and repress terminal
  differentiation, leading to tumor antigen presenting (TAP) cells accumulation and
  depletion of newborn neurons and astrocytes. The outcomes of this dysregulation
  are cellular and molecular defects in the hippocampus of Ptch1+/– mice associated
  with DG elongation, and alterations in mouse behaviour. Significantly up- and down-regulated
  genes are indicated in red and blue, respectively. Activation (arrow lines); inhibition
  (cut lines). Modified from Antonelli et al. (2018). GFAP: Glial fibrillary acidic
  protein; RGL: radial glia-like cells; DCX: doublecortin; Ptch1: Patched1.'
