caption: SARM1-mediated signaling in C. elegans and humans. In C. elegans, Sarm1/Tir-1
  has been shown to regulate left–right asymmetric expression of odorant receptor
  genes in olfactory neurons via association with Unc43 (homolog to the mammalian
  CamKII), which leads to downstream activation of the NSY/MKK/JNK signaling pathway.
  In mammals, Sarm1 was shown to play multiple roles in controlling neuronal morphology.
  Sarm1 physically interacts with transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-2
  (Sdc2) and mediates the function of Sdc2 to control dendritic arborization. In addition,
  Sarm1 also regulates microtubule stability, establishment of neuronal polarity and
  axonal outgrowth. These functions are likely mediated through the MKK4/JNK pathway.
