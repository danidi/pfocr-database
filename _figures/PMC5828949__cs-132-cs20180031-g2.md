caption: 'DPP-4 inhibition suppresses the TGF-β signaling pathway, resulting in the
  induction of miR-29. miR-29 could suppress DPP-4, integrin β1, and interferon-γ.
  Suppression of interferon-γ results in the induction of FGFR1; subsequently, miR-let-7
  is induced. Increased levels of miR-let-7 are associated with suppression of the
  TGF-β receptor-1, resulting in much higher induction of miR-29s. Therefore, miR-29
  and miR-let-7 comprise positive feedback loops of anti-EndMT programs. Abbreviations:
