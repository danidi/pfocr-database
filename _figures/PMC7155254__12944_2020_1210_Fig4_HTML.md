caption: ERS and oxidative stress in patients with NAFLD and the generation and crosstalk
  of ROS signalling connecting these pathways. Excess accumulation of FFAs in hepatocytes
  induces ERS and oxidative stress, both of which are linked by ROS and Ca2+. a) When
  the UPR reaction fails to solve protein errors or unfolding, the ERS response may
  be delayed or insufficient, and hepatocyte apoptosis may be induced by ER and mitochondrial
  stress responses or other independent pathways. b) ROS and oxidative stress disrupt
  ER function, and Ca2+ release from the ER depends on ROS. Excess Ca2+ induces OMM
  permeabilization, which in turn increases mitochondrial ROS release. The increases
  in ROS levels will further increase intracellular Ca2+ levels. c) In this complex
  situation, ERS can induce apoptosis through a number of mechanisms, including mitochondrial
  damage leading to the production of apoptotic factors, cytochrome release, apoptotic
  body formation, and sequential activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. IRE-1 recruits
  TRAF-2 to activate ASK-1 and JNK in a potential proapoptotic pathway that is further
  maintained by ROS or caspase-12. Activation of PERK and ATF6 (p90) leads to activation
  of ATF4 and ATF6, respectively (nuclear translocation of p50), and upregulation
  of CHOP expression, which inhibits Bcl-2 expression and promotes apoptosis
