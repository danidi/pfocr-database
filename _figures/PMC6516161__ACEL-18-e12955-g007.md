caption: Diagram illustrating the proposed pathway mediating the effects of NAD+ generation
  on the quality control of aged oocytes. Loss of NAD+ content and NMNAT2 protein
  results in the meiotic abnormalities and metabolic dysfunction in oocytes from old
  mouse. NA supplement and SIRT1 overexpression/activation could partly rescue the
  defective phenotype of these aged oocytes
