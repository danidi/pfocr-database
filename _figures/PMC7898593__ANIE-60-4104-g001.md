caption: Closthioamide biosynthesis gene cluster and proposed routes to diaminopropane
  incorporation. A) Structure of closthioamide (CTA) with diaminopropane (DAP) core
  colored red. B) CTA biosynthesis gene cluster. PHBA; p‐hydroxybenzoic acid. C) Proposed
  CTA biosynthetic pathway. Steps that have been previously characterized are outlined
  in a green box while the uncharacterized portion of the pathway is outlined in a
  gray box. Two possible routes (i and ii) for DAP formation and incorporation are
  displayed.
