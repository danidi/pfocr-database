caption: Immune signaling pathways related to ACK1/TNK2. (A–D) RNA-seq analysis after
  the silencing of the ACK1/TNK2 gene of A549 cells. Differentially expressed genes
  were involved in the T cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway,
  JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and Toll-like signaling pathways. (E) Dissection of
  ACK1-associated immune signaling pathways by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of 188
  lung cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database.
