caption: The mevalonate pathway for biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate. Three
  acetyl-CoA units are linked successively by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA
  synthase to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA). Reductive deacylation
  of HMG-CoA by HMG-CoA reductase forms mevalonate, which undergoes three phosphorylations
  catalyzed by mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, and diphosphomevalonate
  decarboxylase, forming IPP. Isomerization of IPP to di-methylallyl diphosphate,
  catalyzed by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (data not shown) provides the “building
  blocks” for the synthesis of all isoprenoids.
