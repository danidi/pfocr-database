caption: Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and increased accumulation is a characteristic
  of malignant cells(–). Therapeutic strategies have developed in targeting cancer
  cells by photodynamic therapy and killing these malignant cells by blocking tetrapyrrole
  biosynthesis and irreversible damage to the mitochondria where these reactions mostly
  occurs(ref). IPA analysis showed pathway of increased biosynthesis of tetrapyrrole
  compounds in GBM cells in contrast to normal Astrocytes ().
