caption: Model of PD-L1 induction on tumor cells by CD11b-positive BM. BM cells adhere
  to the surface of tumor cells through CD11b interaction with an unknown receptor
  on the tumor cell surface. This interaction activates the p38 signaling pathway
  and induces PD-L1 expression, both intracellular and on the tumor cell surface.
  Overexpressed PD-L1 may play a role in metastasis, immune evasion, and drug resistance.
