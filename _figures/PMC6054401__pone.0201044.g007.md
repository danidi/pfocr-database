caption: 'Panel A, basal condition: HSCs express high levels of both Nrf2 and its
  target genes (e.g. Nqo1), thereby controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) level.
  Nrf2 also inhibits Smad pathway by binding directly to Smad protein or through the
  action of phosphatases []. In these conditions, the TGF-β1/Smad pathway has a low
  activity, resulting in low level of αSMA, collagens and TGF-β1. Thus, HSC cells
  exhibit a quiescent phenotype. Panel B, Nrf2 knockdown: we have found out that Nrf2
  knockdown, with a consequent decrease of its target genes, induces stellate cells
  activation. Decrease in Nrf2 was in fact associated with an increase in the levels
  of Extracellular matrix (ECM) components as well as αSMA and TGF-β1. TGF-β1 further
  induces the expression of ATF3, which acts as functional repressor of Nrf2. We found
  out that this siNrf2-induced stellate cell activation may be regulated by the Smad
  inhibitors SB-431542 hydrate (SB43) and SB-525334 (SB52), confirming the role of
  Nrf2 in relation to the Smad pathway.'
