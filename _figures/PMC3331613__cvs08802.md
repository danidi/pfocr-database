caption: Major signalling pathways identified in ischaemic postconditioning (PostC).
  Several autacoid substances (adenosine, bradykinin, opioids, TNFα) are produced
  endogenously and act as triggers in PostC. These autacoids bind to G-protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCR) and stimulate RISK pathway which recruits PI3K/Akt and ERK, activates
  PKCɛ through eNOS/NO/PKG, and phosphorylates (inhibits) GSK3β, thereby delaying
  opening of mPTP. PKCɛ may stimulate ROS generation through activating mKATP channels,
  and consequentially inhibit mPTP opening. The RISK pathway also induces some other
  anti-apoptosis and anti-necrosis pathways. An alternative SAFE pathway recruits
  TNFα, which binds to TNF receptor resulting in STAT3 activation. STAT3 targets CYP-D
  leading to mPTP inhibition. PostC also inhibits the Na+/H+ exchanger in a PKG-dependent
  fashion and reduces Ca2+ accumulation, because the sarcolemmal Na+/H+ exchanger
  and the Na+ bicarbonate co-transporter are activated at the onset of reperfusion,
  which causes intracellular Ca2+ accumulation through reverse activation of the Na+/Ca2+
  exchanger and induces cell apoptosis and necrosis. CYP-D, cyclophilin-D; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; ERK, p42/p44 extracellular-regulated kinase; GPCR, G-protein-coupled
  receptor; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore; mKATP, mitochondrial KATP channel; NBC, Na+ bicarbonate co-transporter; NCE,
  Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; NHE1, Na+/H+ exchanger; NO, nitric oxide; PKCɛ, protein kinase
  C subtype ɛ; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; STAT3,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription-3; TNFR, TNF receptor.
