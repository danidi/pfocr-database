caption: Notch signalling controls proliferation of cardiac stem cells and of immature
  cardiomyocytes. In terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes Notch signalling is
  switched off and it becomes transiently activated following an ischemic insult,
  conferring apoptosis protection. Prolonged activation of Notch in mature cardiomyocytes
  lead instead to apoptosis.
