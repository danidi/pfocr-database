caption: (A) Treg cell depletion in LCMV chronically infected mice triggers an increase
  in B7 and PD-L1 molecules on APCs (partially dependent on activation of auto-reactive
  CD4 T cells). Increased net positive signals on APCs activate virus-specific CD8
  T cells, and cytokines produced by activated CD4 T cells may further contribute
  for rescue of exhausted CD8 T cells after Treg cell depletion. However, the majority
  of LCMV infected cells is comprised of non-hematopoietic cells that express PD-L1
  but no B7 molecules. Therefore, even though exhausted CD8 T cells are activated,
  expand and recover function after Treg cell depletion, when they interact with non-hematopoietic
  target cells, PD-1 negative signals prevail and inhibit cell-mediated cytotoxic
  activity. Thus Treg cell ablation during chronic LCMV infection rescues virus-specific
  CD8 T cells but there is no reduction in viral burden. (B) When PD-L1 blocking antibodies
  are combined with Treg cell depletion, virus-specific CD8 T cells receive positive
  signals from the APCs without PD-1 negative signaling, resulting in optimal T cell
  rescue. In addition, blockade of the PD-1 pathway now enables rescued LCMV-specific
  CD8 T cells to kill PD-L1 expressing infected cells at effector sites. As a result,
  combining Treg cell ablation to blockade of the PD-1 pathway during chronic LCMV
  infection results in optimal rescue virus-specific CD8 T cells that can reduce viral
  burden [].
