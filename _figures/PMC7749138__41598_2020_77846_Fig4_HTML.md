caption: A schematic illustration of the major pathways involved in the unique response
  of Ethanol Red to supra-optimal growth temperature (39 °C). Under anaerobic conditions,
  the TCA pathway operates as an oxidative branch and a reductive branch. Broken grey
  lines represent the point at which the cycle may be interrupted. The precise step
  of interruption in yeast cells is not yet identified. The proteins are highlighted
  in green (upregulated) or red (downregulated), indicating their enhancement or repression
  compared to the levels observed at control temperature (30 °C). In this figure only
  the proteins are shown which were significantly altered exclusively in the Ethanol
  Red strain. Altered proteins common to other strains are not shown.
