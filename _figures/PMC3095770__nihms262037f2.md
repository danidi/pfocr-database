caption: Diagram showing the interaction of the leptin and insulin signaling pathways
  in both the transcriptional regulation of Pomc and in the regulation of POMC procesing
  and the enzymes responsible for POMC procesing. Leptin (via STAT3) stimulates Pomc
  gene transcription but also stimulates the genes Psck1 and Psck2 for the procesing
  enzymes, PC1/3 and PC2. The transcription factor, Nhlh2, also stimulates Psck1 and
  Psck2. FoxO1, part of the insulin signaling pathway, inhibits Pomc gene transcription
  and also inhibits the processing enzyme, CPE which is responsible for the generation
  of α-MSH from ACTH 1–17 and for the C-terminal cleavage of β-EP 1–31 to β-EP 1–27/1–26.
  CPE also serves as a sorting receptor that sorts POMC to the regulated secretory
  pathway. PRCP is an enzymes responsible for the degradation of α-MSH. (EP = Endorphin;
  PC1/3 and PC2= Prohormone convertases 1/3 and 2; CPE= Carboxypeptidase E; PRCP =
  Prolylcarboxypeptidase; nhlh2= nescient helix-loop-helix2).
