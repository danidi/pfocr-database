caption: Differential signaling pathways activated by β1ARs and β2ARs in cardiomyocytes.
  Following SNS catecholamines (Norepinephrine-NE) stimulation, activated β1ARs and
  β2ARs induce the production of cAMP through Gs activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC).
  Next, cAMP activates PKA resulting in positive chronotropic and inotropic effects.
  Secondarily, β1AR through Gs and Calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMKII) dependent
  pathway can induce myocyte apoptotic responses after increased catecholamine stimulation.
  In contrast, β2ARs can induce the activation of Gi dependent cell survival and anti-apoptotic
  signaling through Akt. Both β ARs are regulated by GRK2 phosphorylation causing
  the dampening of G protein activation and chronically this leads to receptor down-regulation
  and the loss of inotropic reserve. Heightened GRK2 activity, as seen in human HF,
  appears to have a net pro-death effect due, at least in part to desensitization
  of β2ARs (Brinks et al., ) and also due to novel GPCR-independent mitochondrial
  targeting (Chen et al., ).
