caption: Major trends in mRNA expression at 56 days on experimental diets and summary
  network analysis among genes. The complete network including currently-known relationships
  among genes in non-ruminants from the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® knowledge base
  is available in Additional File . The PPARG relationships depicted are based on
  the relative responses found in the present study and do not represent actual fold-changes
  in expression as those are depicted in Figure 2–4. Relationships dealing with insulin
  and glucose signaling via INSR, SLC2A4, IRS1, and their link with PPARG were from
  the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® knowledge base and have been discussed to some extent
  in the review by Fernyhough et al. []. Other relationships from the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis® knowledge base include those encompassing genes associated primarily with
  energy metabolism. Genes with black-colored background had fold-changes in mRNA
  expression ≥ 2-fold in at least one time point in all groups. Genes with grey-colored
  background appear central for transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis and energy
  metabolism. Together with clustering analysis (Additional File ), data suggest that
  PPARγ activity through up-regulation of FABP4, DGAT2, FASN, and SCD is crucial for
  adipogenesis. The transcription factor THRSP was dramatically up-regulated by the
  high-energy diet regardless of steer type and might constitute an important transcription
  regulator of adipogenesis.
