caption: The mouse (A) ping-pong cycle is reversed as compared to Drosophila (B).
  In Drosophila primary processing of long transcripts derived from piRNA clusters
  produces both sense and antisense piRNAs that enter a ping-pong cycle that involves
  AGO3 and AUB. AGO3 primarily binds sense secondary piRNAs and AUB binds primary
  antisense piRNAs. In mouse piRNA clusters are not the major source of primary piRNAs
  (). mRNAs of active transposable elements likely represent the substrate for primary
  processing resulting in sense piRNAs that preferentially associate with MILI. In
  prenatal testis both MILI and MIWI2 participate in the amplification cycle. MIWI2
  is specifically enriched in secondary antisense piRNAs as compared to MILI. Antisense
  piRNAs guide DNA methylation of transposable elements sequences in the nucleus probably
  through recognition of nascent transposon transcripts. After birth, when MIWI2 is
  no longer expressed, MILI continues to operate the cycle alone. If DNA methylation
  of transposon sequences is impaired due to downstream mutations in methyltransferase
  proteins, overexpression of transposon transcripts boosts primary processing and
  increases the fraction of primary sense piRNAs.
