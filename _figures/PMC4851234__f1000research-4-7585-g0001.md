caption: 'Negative regulation at the levels of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL have been reported
  to attenuate necroptotic signalling. Not only is necroptosis by definition a caspase-independent
  process, but caspase-8 negates cell death, potentially by proteolytically-cleaving
  CYLD, RIPK1 and RIPK3. Reversible tuning of the pathway is accomplished by introduction
  or removal of post-translational modifications, including: ubiquitylation of RIPK1
  by IAPs; deubiquitylation of RIPK3 on Lys5 by A20; and dephosphorylation of mouse
  RIPK3 at S231/T232 by Ppm1b. Whether an analogous phosphatase exists to dephosphorylate
  activated MLKL and inhibit necroptosis is not clear. However, other regulators of
  MLKL have been proposed, such as TRAF2. It is currently unknown what factors might
  govern phospho-MLKL assembly into higher order oligomers on the membrane, although
  a role for additional factors in mediating death is suggested by the lag between
  MLKL membrane translocation/oligomerisation and cell death . Abbreviations: 4HB,
  four-helix bundle; CYLD, cylindromatosis; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins;
  MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain-like; RHIM, RIP homotypic interaction motif; RIPK,
  receptor interacting protein kinase; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; TRADD, TNFR1-associated
  death domain; TRAF2, TNF receptor associated factor 2.'
