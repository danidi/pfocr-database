caption: Complement is activated through the classical, lectin and alternative pathways,
  which lead to the formation of two C3 convertases. One C3 convertase (C4b2a) is
  associated with both the classical and lectin pathways, whereas the other (C3bBb)
  is associated with the alternative pathway. The two C3 convertases generate copious
  amounts of C3b, after which the pathways converge to generate large amounts of C3bBb.
  As more C3bBb forms, the terminal pathway is activated, primarily by generation
  of C3bBbC3b, a C5 convertase that cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. However when the
  classical and lectin pathways are activated, C4b2aC3b, the C5 convertase of the
  classical and lectin pathways, is also formed. Complement activity results in generation
  of two potent anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a (pink). In the majority (>90%) of patients
  with C3 glomerulopathy, dysregulation of the alternative pathway occurs in the fluid
  phase and in the glycocalyx overlying the glomerular endothelial pores (shown at
  the bottom of the figure). In the remainder (<10%) of patients with C3 glomerulopathy,
  dysregulation occurs at the level of the classical and/or lectin pathways. As a
  result of dysregulation, C3b deposited on the glycocalyx can serve as a substrate
  for C3 convertase formation and ultimately C5 convertase formation. Driving dysregulation
  are genetic changes (not shown) and/or autoantibodies to various pathway components
  and complexes. The targets of therapeutic agents currently under development are
  indicated by pink stars (the purple star is the site of action of eculizumab, which
  has already received approval); however, the complexity of the complement system
  and the heterogeneity of C3 glomerulopathy raise the possibility that no single
  treatment will be universally appropriate.

  description: Complement is activated through the classical, lectin and alternative
    pathways, which lead to the formation of two C3 convertases. One C3 convertase
    (C4b2a) is associated with both the classical and lectin pathways, whereas the
    other (C3bBb) is associated with the alternative pathway. The two C3 convertases
    generate copious amounts of C3b, after which the pathways converge to generate

    primarily by generation of C3bBbC3b, a C5 convertase that cleaves C5 into C5a
    and C5b. However when the classical and lectin pathways are activated, C4b2aC3b,
    the C5 convertase of the classical and lectin pathways, is also formed. Complement
    activity results in generation of two potent anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a (pink).
    In the majority (>90%) of patients with C3 glomerulopathy, dysregulation of the
