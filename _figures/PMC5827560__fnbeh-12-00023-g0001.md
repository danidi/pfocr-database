caption: 'Model for a biological pathway regulating memory, synaptic plasticity and
  schizophrenia risk. Numerous schizophrenia-risk associated proteins act either upstream
  or downstream of immediate early genes EGR3 and ARC. Red labels indicate proteins
  encoded by genes that map to the 108 loci for schizophrenia risk. Both EGR3 and
  ARC are activated by environmental events, such as stress, via activity-dependent
  activation of NMDARs. The resulting influx of Ca++ triggers Calcineurin/(CN) nuclear
  factors of activated T-cell (NFAT) signaling which can induce EGR3 expression. EGR3
  positively regulates, and maintains expression of, ARC. NGFI-A Binding Protein 2
  (NAB2), which is a transcriptional target of EGR3 and EGR1, binds to EGR proteins
  (EGR1, 2 and 3) to co-regulate expression of target genes. This action includes
  feedback inhibition of EGR1 and EGR3, and NAB2 itself, a critical element of the
  temporal regulation of activity-dependent genes. Additional proteins that interact
  in the pathway include NRG1 which, via binding to ERBB receptors, maintains expression
  of EGR3 (in muscle spindles), and has been shown to activate NMDARs. BDNF, via binding
  to Trk-B receptors, regulates EGR3-mediated expression of NMDAR subunit NR1. EGR3,
  in turn, is required for activity-dependent expression of BDNF. SRF is a transcription
  factor required for memory formation and long-term depression (LTD), which regulates
  expression of EGR3 (and EGR1). Perturbations in any components of this biological
  pathway are expected to result in deficient induction of EGR3, and its target genes,
  in response to neuronal activity, including that triggered by stress. Insufficient
  activation of this pathway in response to stimuli may result in poor memory formation
  and contribute to cognitive deficits. Deficient activation of the pathway in response
  to stress may also result in insufficient neuroprotective processes and thereby
  contribute, over time, to the neuropathology that gives rise to schizophrenia (see
  Figure ). Note that many interactions represented are taken from literature on studies
  in immune system and have yet to be validated in the brain. The shared roles of
  these proteins in the immune system may contribute to association between schizophrenia
  and immune dysfunction. Abbreviations: NMDAR, N-methyl d-aspartate receptor; NFATC3,
  nuclear factor of activated T-cells; EGR1, 3, Early growth response 1, 3; ARC, Activity-regulated
  cytoskeleton-associated protein. Additional potential contributing proteins are
  indicated in gray include: SRF, serum response factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic
