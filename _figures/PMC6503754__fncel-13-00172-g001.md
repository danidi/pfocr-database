caption: Glycolytic inhibition via 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). 2DG decreases glycolytic
  flux, reduces cell energy production and produces anti-seizure effects. Glucose
  (Gluc) and 2DG enter the cytoplasm via glucose transporters (GLUT3 in neurons or
  GLUT1 in glia). During glycolysis, glucose is first phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate
  (G-6-P), which is then converted into fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P). F-6-P is converted
  into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and ultimately to pyruvate via multiple steps.
  Pyruvate is the final product of glycolysis; it enters mitochondria to participate
  in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for oxidative ATP production. G-6-P also enters
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), generating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione (GSH), which attenuates cell damage caused by
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, GSH may have antiseizure properties.
  Once inside the cell, 2DG is phosphorylated to 2DG-6-P, which cannot be further
  metabolized. 2DG-6-P is trapped and accumulates in the cell, competitively inhibiting
  phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI, primary effect) and hexokinase (HK), limiting the
  conversion of G-6-P to F-6-P and glucose to G-6-P, two of the rate-limiting steps
  in glycolysis. Increased FBP (e.g., by exogenous administration) may also enhance
  PPP activity and produce an antiseizure effect (plus sign). The chemical structures
  of glucose and 2DG are indicated at the top of the figure. Modified from , with
