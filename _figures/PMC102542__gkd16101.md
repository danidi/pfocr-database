caption: Biosynthetic pathway for co-translational selenocysteine incorporation. SelC,
  the opal codon-specific Sec tRNA, is first charged with serine. ATP-dependent SelD
  catalysis transforms environmental selenite to an activated Se-phosphate species.
  This species is utilized by SelA to displace the serine hydroxyl with a selenol
  moiety, forming a Sec-charged tRNA that recognizes the UGA opal codon. In the presence
  of GTP, the SelB elongation factor effects Sec translation by binding both the Sec-tRNA
  and the mRNA SECIS.
