caption: Nuclear receptors LXRs, FXR, and PXR as central regulators of renal lipid,
  inflammation and oxidative stress. Increase in inflammatory response, glucose concentration,
  and oxysterols or LXR agonist stimulate LXR and increases renin gene expression
  in vivo, suggesting a link between cholesterol and lipid metabolism, the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
  system and blood pressure regulation. Bile acids or FXR agonist reduces the renal
  expression of SREBP-1, prevents the progression of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis,
  the renal accumulation of triglycerides, and the increased expression of profibrotic
  growth factors, NADPH oxidase. In addition, FXR agonist negatively interferes with
  the inflammatory response by antagonizing the NFκB signaling pathway, to support
  its role as a modulator of inflammation. Activation of PXR in the kidney stimulates
  the expression of ABCA1, as well as the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI),
  which are both involved in the exchange of cholesterol between HDL lipoproteins
  and cells, increasing the renal cholesterol clearance. This is important since lipid
  abnormalities in ESRD are characterized by reduced serum apo A-1 and HDL concentration,
  this in turn promotes an influx of ox-LDL in macrophages and resident cells in the
  artery wall and facilitates foam cell formation and atherosclerosis
