caption: Proposed model depicting the molecular mechanisms regulating the early events
  of germination by carbon source sensing in A. nidulans. Sensing of an external carbon
  source triggers activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein GanB(Gα)-SfaD(Gβ)-GpgA(γ),
  which in turn initiates the early events of conidial germination through activation
  the cAMP/PKA pathway. The Gα-subunit (GanB) appears to be the primary signaling
  element responsible for activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway. The Gβγ-dimer SfaD-GpgA
  is necessary for proper activation of GanB by carbon source sensing. RgsA is involved
  in downregulation of cAMP-PKA-dependent germination through inhibition of the GanB
  activity.
