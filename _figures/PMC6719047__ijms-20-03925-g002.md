caption: 'RTT-related protein known functional interaction networks. (A) Chromatin
  modulation: Red for chromatin modifying enzymes, blue for proteins involved in MECP2-mediated
  transcriptional regulation and green for histone deacetylases (HDACs). (B) Ubiquitination
  processes: Red for proteins linked to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, green for
  proteins involved in ubiquitin-like modifier conjugation pathway and blue for ubiquitination
  and proteasome degradation proteins. (C) Synapsis: Red for proteins involved in
  GABAergic synapses, dark blue for proteins involved in glutamatergic synapses, light
  green for proteins involved in dopaminergic synapses, yellow for proteins involved
  in the synaptic vesicle cycle, pink for proteins in the calcium signalling pathway,
  dark green for potassium channels, light blue for proteins in the Ras signalling
  pathway, orange for proteins related to circadian entrainment and purple for neurotransmitter
  receptors and postsynaptic transmission proteins.'
