caption: 'Violacein is produced through a 5-step enzymatic process followed by a single
  non-enzymatic step. Potential side products are shown. The strains constructed in
  this work typically produced a mixture of violacein (~85–95%) and, the unavoidable
  side product, deoxyviolacein (~5–15%) with very low to not detectible (Limit of
  detection: 1 mg/L) production of both other products.'
