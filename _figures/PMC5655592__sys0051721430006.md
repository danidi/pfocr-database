caption: Genes affected concordantly within the ileum and meta-analysis data sets
  formed biofunctional clusters of overlapping pathways. Each node depicts a significantly
  enriched biological pathway, and each edge depicts overlapping genes that were significantly
  affected by germ status. Pathways were classified as upregulated if the annotation
  enrichment was found to be maximally significant by analyzing only the upregulated
  genes and as downregulated if the annotation enrichment was found to be maximally
  significant by analyzing only the downregulated genes. (A) The concordant[T,M] network
  (≥4 overlapping genes per edge) formed three clusters related to cancer (top left),
  metabolism (top right), and the immune system (top left and bottom center). (B)
  The concordant[T,P,M] network (with at least one instance of overlapping genes per
  edge) formed two independent clusters, one composed of downregulated immune system
  pathways (left) and the other of upregulated metabolic pathways (right).
