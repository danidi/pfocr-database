caption: S. cerevisiae signal transduction pathways regulated by LCBs. LCBs transiently
  increase during a heat stress and are hypothesized to activate Pkh1 and Pkh2. As
  discussed in the text, Pkh2 is probably more dependent upon LCBs than is Pkh1 although
  this has not been defined for each cellular response. Kinase assays with purified
  proteins suggest that LCBs can directly trigger a small increase in Ypk1, Ypk2 and
  Sch9 activity (indicated by a dotted line). Pkh1/2 phosphorylate Ypk1, Ypk2, Sch9
  and Pkc1 in their activation loop (PDK1 site) but the proteins are not enzymatically
  active. To become active they also need to be phosphorylated in a hydrophobic region
  (PDK2 site) and in a turn motif in their C-terminus. Phosphorylation of these sites
  in Ypk2 is mediated by TORC2 and for Sch9 phosphorylation is mediated by TORC1.
  Ypk1/2 and Pkc1 are shown working in parallel pathways to control cell wall integrity,
  but data also support an alternative pathway in which Ypk1/2 work upstream of Pkc1.,  Adapted
  from ref.
