caption: Cleavage of L1 can be triggered by PMA and proceeds predominantly at the
  cell surface, leading to a rapid increase of soluble L1 in the extracellular space.
  This cleavage is mediated by ADAM17. A second pathway of cleavage is initiated in
  endosomes/MVBs and is triggered by calcium influx. This causes enhanced cleavage
  and release of L1 in the form of exosomes. After exosome release from the cell,
  further cleavage can also occur. Enhanced cleavage and release are also seen in
  response to MCD and APMA (not shown). Cleavage in exosomes is predominantly mediated
  by ADAM10. ER, endoplasmic reticulum, TGN, trans-Golgi network.
