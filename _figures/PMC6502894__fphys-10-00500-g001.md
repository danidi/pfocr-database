caption: Diagram showing the main paracrine and dichotomic autocrine functions of
  the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle
  physiological contraction induces IL-6 release (black arrows), with paracrine effects
  on other organ metabolism. Upon injury or in DMD, IL-6 is released (orange arrows)
  following the inflammatory response and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway promotes muscle repair
  by activating pro-myogenic genes (such as MyoD) that allow MuSC differentiation
  and fusion into new or existing myofibers. In catabolic conditions, IL-6 levels
  are elevated (red arrows) and induce muscle size loss, by activation of different
  pro-atrophic pathways in myofibers. In neurogenic atrophy, FAPs activate the IL-6/JAK/STAT
  pathway. In response to acute exercise, IL-6 is highly produced (blue arrows) and
  IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway is activated, inducing pro-proliferation and pro-fusion genes
  that control contribution of MuSC to myofiber growth. In the box, the IL-6/JAK/STAT3
  signaling model is shown. IL-6 binds the IL-6r-Gp130 receptor complex and activates
  the JAK tyrosine kinases. Once activated, JAK proteins dimerize, phosphorylate,
  and activate their primary substrates, the STAT proteins. Phosphorylated STAT proteins
  dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate different target protein-coding
  genes.
