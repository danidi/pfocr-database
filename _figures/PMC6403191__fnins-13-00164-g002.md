caption: 'The biogenesis of mature, secreted clusterin involves the traditional secretory
  pathway common to other secreted proteins. CLU is transcribed into the mRNA NM_001831.3,
  containing exons 1–9. Within exon 2 is a 22-amino acid signal peptide that targets
  the preproprotein (NP_001822.3) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi
  apparatus. This immature preproprotein undergoes a series of modifications including
  phosphorylation, cleavage, and extensive glycosylation. Finally, mature secreted
  clusterin (sCLU) is produced and secreted from cells. Although traditionally referred
  to as a secreted protein, a number of reports have shown the existence of clusterin
  inside the cell, referred to as intracellular clusterin. In comparison to secreted
  clusterin, which has a well described biogenesis, the origin and production of intracellular
  clusterin is much less clear. Although originally believed that intracellular clusterin
  arose from a distinct CLU mRNA transcript to sCLU, it is now extensively believed
  that these two proteins share the common mRNA transcript NM_001831.3 and that intracellular
  clusterin may exist due to altered localization of secreted clusterin. Stress may
  impair a cell’s ability to secrete sCLU, resulting in its localization within the
  cell. Alternatively, sCLU may not undergo canonical biogenesis, resulting in incomplete
  glycosylation and/or cleavage, and this may lead immature sCLU to escape the secretory
  pathway and remain inside the cell. Additionally, secreted clusterin may be taken
  into cells by uptake mechanisms resulting in the presence of mature, glycosylated
  sCLU within the cell. Alternative theories suggest that CLU mRNA may undergo stress-induced
  alternative splicing and non-canonical translation to produce a truncated, non-glycosylated
  clusterin protein that lacks exon 2 and therefore does not become secreted, but
  instead accumulates within the cell. Research from oncology indicates a pro-survival
  function of secreted clusterin and a pro-apoptotic function of intracellular clusterin.
  Secreted clusterin interacts with the BAX-Ku70 complex, stabilizing it thereby inhibiting
  the translocation of BAX to the mitochondria where it would promote apoptotic pathways.
  In contrast, intracellular clusterin competes with BAX for binding with Ku70 and
  thereby inhibiting their complex formation, resulting in increased free BAX that
  can translocate to the mitochondria. Secreted clusterin is also thought to interact
  with Bcl-xl proteins promoting its anti-apoptotic function, whereas intracellular
  clusterin interacts with this same protein to reduce its anti-apoptotic function.
  Intracellular clusterin has also been shown to interact with DNA-PK complexes and
  thereby inhibit DNA repair, resulting in DNA damage and cell stress and death. This
