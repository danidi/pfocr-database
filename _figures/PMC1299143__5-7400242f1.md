caption: Pathways of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3synthesis. (A) Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) is
  the basic building block of phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PIs). The inositol
  head group can be phosphorylated in the 3-, 4- and 5-positions to generate derivatives
  of PtdIns, which are listed on the right. (B) Schematic for receptor-driven PtdIns
  (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) production. Agonist stimulation (tyrosine
  kinase or G-protein-coupled receptors) activates class I PI 3-kinase to induce phosphorylation
  of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on the 3-position of the inositol group. (C) The proposed new pathway
  for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast enzymes
  are shown in blue. Their mammalian counterparts are depicted in turquoise. PIP 5-K,
  phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue.
