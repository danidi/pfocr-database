caption: Genetic pathways involved in the regulation of the Mesp2 pathway. (A) Mesp2
  expression is activated by Notch signaling and Tbx6. Mesp2 then activates its downstream
  target genes such as Ripply2, EphA4, and L-fng. Ripply2 is involved in the suppression
  of Tbx6, which also leads to the suppression of Mesp2 transcription. EphA4 is implicated
  in the segregation process in the segmental border. L-fng acts on the Notch receptor,
  resulting in the repression of NICD. Mesp2 also acts on Maml1 to destabilize this
  protein. (B) The molecular mechanism of rostral–caudal patterning. Notch activity
  is required to confer caudal property on a somite. In the rostral compartment, Notch
  activation is suppressed by a Mesp2 function that destabilizes MamL1. S + 1, somite
  number 1; S0, forming somite; S − 1, somite number −1; PSM, presomitic mesoderm,
  CoR, transcriptional repressor complex; Mam, mastermindlike proteins.
