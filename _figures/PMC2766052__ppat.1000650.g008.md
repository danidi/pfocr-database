number: Figure 8
caption: At early times after RNA virus infection (4–8h), MAVS interacts with TRAF3
  via its TRAF interacting motif (TIM); TRAF3 is subject to Lys63 polyubiquitination,
  leading to recruitment of the downstream kinases TBK1/IKKε and production of type
  I IFN. Subsequently, DUBA removes Lys63 polyubiquitination from TRAF3 which dissociates
  the TRAF3-TBK1 signaling complex. At late times after infection (12–16h), Triad3A
  physically associates TRAF3 via its TIM which promotes Lys48 polyubiquitination
  of TRAF3, and subsequent proteasomal degradation.
