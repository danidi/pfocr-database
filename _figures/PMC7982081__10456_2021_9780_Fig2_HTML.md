caption: Development of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Multiple source may give
  rise to liver EC, but a unifying concept of LSEC specification is still missing.
  a Genetic in vivo studies have shown that hepatoblasts in the septum transversum
  mesenchyme coordinate LSEC development through the VEGF signaling pathway. b Recent
  fate mapping studies have indicated a pivotal role of cardiac endothelial progenitor
  cells in establishing the liver vasculature. Sinus venous-derived NFATC1+ and NPR3-
  endothelial progenitors may contribute to liver endothelium. c LSEC may also be
  derived from hemangioblasts and/or erythro-myeloid progenitors
