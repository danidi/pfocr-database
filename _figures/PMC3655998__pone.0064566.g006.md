caption: Previously, we had published that the collagen microenvironment induced HMGA2
  expression [Dangi-Garimella S et al, ]. We now demonstrate that PDAC cells in the
  collagen microenvironment induce HMGA2-dependent HAT expression and histone H3 acetylation,
  suggesting that the collagen microenvironment promotes euchromatin formation. This
  signaling pathway allows PDAC cells to resist the effects of gemcitabine in the
  collagen microenvironment.
