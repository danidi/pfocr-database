caption: Scheme of the c-Myc-mediated KPNA2-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) in EOC cells. KPNA2 induces EMT, which subsequently contributes to invasion
  by EOC cells. In addition, KPNA2 also transports c-Myc into the nucleus and triggers
  the Akt/GSK-3β/Snail pathway, which is required for KPNA2-induced EMT.
