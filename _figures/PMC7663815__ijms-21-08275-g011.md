caption: Schematic representation of the crosstalk between androgen and Notch signaling
  pathways in rodent Sertoli cells. Notch signaling in Sertoli cells may be induced
  by Delta-like or Jagged ligands expressed either in Sertoli or germ cells. In Sertoli
  cells, the action of testosterone via both AR and ZIP9 increases Notch1/N1ICD expression
  and transcriptional activity of RBP-J. AR signaling is involved in the up-regulation
  of Hey1 expression, whereas ZIP9-mediated pathway controls Hes1 expression. Green
  arrows indicate interactions revealed in the present study. Black arrows indicate
  established steps of androgen and Notch signaling pathways. Red open arrows—up-regulation.
  AR—nuclear androgen receptor; GC—germ cells; DLL/JAG—Delta-like/Jagged ligands;
  N1ICD—Notch1 intracellular domain; RBP-J—Recombination signal binding protein; SC—Sertoli
  cells; T—Testosterone; ZIP9—Zrt- and Irt-like protein 9.
