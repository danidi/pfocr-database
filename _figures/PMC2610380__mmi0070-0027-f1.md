caption: Postulated siderophore biosynthetic pathway of A. fumigatus. Biosynthesis
  of both TAFC and FC starts with N5-hydroxylation of ornithine. Subsequently, the
  hydroxamate group is formed by the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-coenzyme
  A (CoA) derivatives to N5-hydroxyornithine. Here the pathways for biosynthesis of
  TAFC and FC split due to the choice of the acyl group with acetyl for FC and anhydromevalonyl
  for TAFC. Assembly of the cyclic siderophores fusarinine C and FC is catalysed by
  different non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). TAFC and hydroxyferricrocin
  are formed by N2-acetylation of fusarinine C and hydroxylation of FC respectively.
  With exception of the acetyl transferase required for FC biosynthesis all A. fumigatus
  genes encoding respective enzyme activities have been identified and are indicated
  (; ).
