caption: Folate- and vitamin B-12–mediated one-carbon metabolism. One-carbon metabolism
  is required for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate (dTMP), and methionine. The
  hydroxymethyl group of serine is a major source of one-carbon units, which are generated
  in the mitochondria in the form of formate via SHMT2 or in the cytosol through the
  activity of SHMT1 or SHMT2α. Mitochondria-derived formate can enter the cytoplasm
  and function as a one-carbon unit for folate metabolism. The synthesis of dTMP occurs
  in the nucleus and mitochondria. At the S phase, the enzymes of the thymidylate
  (dTMP) synthesis pathway undergo SUMO-dependent translocation to the nucleus. The
  remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by MTR requires vitamin B-12. The one-carbon
  is labeled in bold type. The inset shows the thymidylate synthesis cycle, which
  involves the enzymes SHMT1, SHMT2α, TYMS, and DHFR. AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine;

  description: Folate- and vitamin B-12–mediated one-carbon metabolism. One-carbon
    metabolism is required for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate (dTMP), and methionine.
    The hydroxymethyl group of serine is a major source of one-carbon units, which
    are generated in the mitochondria in the form of formate via SHMT2 or in the cytosol
    through the activity of SHMT1 or SHMT2α. Mitochondria-derived formate can enter

    vitamin B-12. The one-carbon is labeled in bold type. The inset shows the thymidylate
