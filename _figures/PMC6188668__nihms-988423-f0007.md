caption: Upon IL-17 stimulation, Arid5a expression is increased and this RNP is recruited
  to TRAF2. Arid5a promotes the mRNA stability of multiple genes, including cytokines
  and chemokines as well as the transcription factor Nfkbiz (IκBξ). Additionally,
  Arid5a enhances the translation of Nfkbiz and Cebpb, transcription factors that
  in turn regulate downstream genes such as Lcn2, which are not intrinsically unstable.
  Thus, Arid5a is a central player in the post-transcriptional IL-17 signaling cascade.
