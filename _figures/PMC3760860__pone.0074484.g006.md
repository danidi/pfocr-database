caption: The Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls the proliferative and molecular patterning
  of the snake dental lamina allowing the ordered emergence of tooth germs. In control
  cultures, Wnt/β-catenin signalling via Lef1 is concentrated at the successional
  lamina (tip of the dental lamina). This region proliferates and elongates, regulating
  organized emergence of the tooth germs. In GSK3β inhibitor treatment Lef1 expression
  is expanded and proliferation increases in the rest of the dental lamina, which
  becomes wider and shorter. The dental lamina becomes odontogenic and ectopic tooth
  germs and epithelial projections appear.
