caption: (A) Adaptive immunity was evolved in vertebrates about 500 million years
  ago with agnathans (jawless vertebrates) and gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) utilizing
  distinct toolboxes to generate antigen-specific receptors. TGF-β sensu stricto was
  evolved in early Deuterostomes with definitive orthologues present in Echinoderms.
  Foxp3 emerged in jawed vertebrates with its acquisition of a TGF-β-regulated CNS1
  element in Eutherians (placental mammals). (B) Due to the stochastic process of
  antigen receptor generation, autoreactive T cells (Taut) can be produced from T
  cell progenitors (Tp). In ancestral vertebrates, including jawless vertebrates,
  TGF-β signaling might represent the primordial mechanism to keep autoreactive T
  cells in check. In non-Eutherian jawed vertebrates, thymic Treg cells (tTreg), whose
  development is supported by TGF-β signaling via repression of T cell clonal deletion,
  emerged as a cell-extrinsic pathway working in concert with TGF-β signaling to suppress
  autoreactive T cells. In placental mammals, the CNS1 element was acquired in the
  Foxp3 gene locus, which mediated TGF-β-induced peripheral Treg cell (pTreg) differentiation
  to suppress allogenic T cells (Tallo) reactive to paternal antigens expressed in
  fetuses as well as commensal microbiota-reactive T cells (Tcom).
