caption: Signaling by PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. In an unstressed condition, GRP78, the
  primary sensor of ER stress binds to transmembrane ER proteins, PERK, IRE1, and
  ATF6, preventing their activation. The accumulation of unfolded proteins leads to
  dissociation of GRP78 from PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. GRP78, however, binds to the unfolded
  protein. GRP78 dissociation leads to PERK and IRE1 oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation
  of their cytosolic domains. The active phosphorylated PERK (p-PERK, active) in turn
  phosphorylates eIF2α (p-eIF2α, inactive), leading to attenuation of global protein
  synthesis. Under these conditions, selected mRNAs, such as ATF4, are translated,
  which induces the expression of genes involved in restoring ER homeostasis. ATF4
  can activate GADD34, which recruits a phosphatase to dephosphorylate p-PERK and
  reverse translational attenuation. ER-resident p58IPKs is an inhibitor of PERK.
  Phosphorylation of IRE1 (p-IRE1) activates its endoribonucleolytic activity, which
  then excises an intron of the XBP1 mRNA to generate a mature XBP1 mRNA, which then
  encodes for the active protein, XBP1. The XBP1 protein then translocates into the
  nucleus and supports the ER stress response. Interaction of p-IRE1 with TRAF2 can
  elicit the activation of the JNK pathway and caspases leading to apoptosis. GRP78
  release from the dimeric ATF6 leads to the translocation of its monomeric form to
  the Golgi, where it undergoes proteolytic processing by the proteases (S1P and S2P).
  The cleaved ATF6 then translocates to the nucleus where it activates the ERSR genes
  and chaperones. Alternatively, CHOP/GADD153 can be activated by ATF4, ATF6, or XBP1,
  which promotes apoptosis by decreasing the levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 in the
  cell. The dotted arrows denote translocation. XBP1 (a) denotes the mature XBP1 mRNA,
  while XBP1p denotes the protein product of XBP1 (a). The “+” sign signifies activation.
