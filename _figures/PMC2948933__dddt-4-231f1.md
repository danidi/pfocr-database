caption: 'Schematic display of potential biomolecular targets of vanadium compounds
  within the human cell. The metabolic pathway of the insulin cascade is depicted.
  A double line symbolizes the cellular membrane, with the extracellular part above
  and the intracellular part below.Abbreviations: Letter V, possible vanadium target;
  P/PY, tyrosine residue phosporilated/nonphosphorylated; RPTK, receptor protein tyrosine
  kinase (positive regulator); PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase (negative regulator);
  Y-prot, nonphosphorylated cytosolic protein; PY-prot, phosphorylated cytosolic protein;
  SRI-1, substrate 1 for the insulin receptor; Cyt-PTK, cytosolic protein tyrosine
  kinase.'
