caption: Drug actions in the heme degradation pathway. HO-1 (inducible) and HO-2 (constitutive)
  cleave free heme or denatured heme proteins to generate CO, ferritin, and biliverdin,
  which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. CO has both
  anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties [, , , ]. Ferritin is essential
  for cellular redox reactions [–]. Serum bilirubin levels are positively linked with
  a decreased risk of CVD and protection against diabetes and vascular dysfunction
  [, ]. Drugs focused on the heme degradation pathway predominantly induce HO-1 activity,
  possibly by interacting with the gene promoter. Biliverdin reductase functions via
  a direct increase of HO-1 or an increase in bilirubin levels to promote a reduction
  in oxidative species [, ], and mesobiliverdin enhances β-cell function in the pancreas
  through its antioxidant properties []. This pathway provides the basis for multiple
  pharmaceutical and genetic agents that can protect against CVD by increasing HO-1
  expression.
