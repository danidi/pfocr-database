caption: Different regulation of DSB repair pathways in somatic cells and XY body.
  (A) In response to double-strand breaks after ionizing radiation in somatic cells,
  histone H2AX is phosphorylated redundantly by ATM, ATR, and DNAPK and recruits MDC1
  and RNF8. RNF8 and its partner RNF168 promote protein ubiquitination on histone
  H2AX, H2A, and other substrates. The ubiquitin signals recruits a numbers of proteins
  to DSB sites including RAD18, 53BP1, and BRCA1-A complex, which facilitates the
  loading of RAD51 to replace RPA on single-stranded DNA. RAD51 then promotes strand
  invasion and HR repair. ATR and its activator TopBP1 participate in a unique pathway
  that is important for the HR repair during replication stress. Proteins not discussed
  in this review are omitted for simplicity. (B) In the XY body, H2AX is mainly phosphorylated
  by ATR. H2AX-MDC1-RNF8-dependent protein ubiquitination regulates the recruitment
  of RAD18 and 53BP1 to chromosome loops, but not the recruitment of BRCA1-A complex
  and RAD51 at chromosome axes.
