caption: A model for the BR signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. Arrows and bars represent
  actions of promotion and inhibition, respectively. BR binds to the extracellular
  domain of the BRI1 receptor kinase to increase its kinase activity and induce dimerization
  with and phosphorylation of the BAK1 receptor kinase. The signal is transduced through
  an unknown mechanism to inhibit BIN2 kinase or activate BSU1 phosphatase, leading
  to dephosphorylation of BZR1 and BZR2/BES1 (denoted together as BZR1/2). BIN2 phosphorylation
  of BZR1/2 (pBZR1/2, phosphorylated BZR1 or BZR2/BES1) inhibits its DNA binding,
  targets it for proteasomal degradation, and increases its cytoplasmic retention
  by promoting binding to the 14-3-3 proteins. BR-induced dephosphorylation increases
  nuclear accumulation and DNA binding activity of BZR1 and BZR2/BES1, leading to
  BR-responsive gene expression and growth responses ().
