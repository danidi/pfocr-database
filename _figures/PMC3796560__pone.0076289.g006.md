caption: Ang II induces Col 1 synthesis in, and secretion from, HSCs through AT1,
  so does TGF-β1 through TGFR I and II. LPS doesn't induce Col 1 synthesis and secretion
  in HSCs directly through TLR4, but LPS-TLR4 interaction down-regulates BAMBI expression,
  which is a TGF-β1 pseudo-receptor. Then the pro-fibrogenic function of TGF-β1 is
  enhanced. Ang II up-regulates TLR4 expression and enhances the activity of LPS-TLR4
  signal pathway in HSCs, resulting in further down-regulation of BAMBI expression
  and up-regulated pro-fibrogenic function of TGF-β1. ↑ represents upregulation; ↓
  represents downregulation; + represents enhancement.
