caption: A) Normal Human BACE1 activity. BACE1 in brain processes amyloid precursor
  protein (APP, red) at the β-cleavage site, producing a secreted/soluble form of
  APP, sAPPβ. This is followed by cleavage in the cell membrane by γ-secretase complex
  to produce Aβ (black) and βCTF (white). The predominant APP processing pathway is,
  however, by α-secretase, which produces sAPPα, P3 fragment, and αCTF. In liver,
  BACE1 is the primary enzyme catalyzing cleavage of β galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase
  (ST6Gal I, blue) into secreted ST6GAL I (sST6Gal I) and other products. The sST6Gal
  I sialylates appropriate proteins, resulting in reduction of reactive oxidizing
  species (ROS) and other age and environment-related damage. ROS/environmental damage
  need not be extracellular to be effected by sialylated proteins. Paralogous activity
  from BACE2 or CTSD (stippled light green), while present, would be directed towards
  other physiological processes. B) Effects of sudden organism-wide reduction of BACE1
  activity in adult humans. Drugs administered late in life should immediately reduce
  BACE1 activity in both brain and liver. In brain, BACE1 processing of APP becomes
  sufficiently infrequent that little to no Aβ or sAPPβ are produced, while α-secretase
  is unchanged. In liver, sudden depletion of BACE1 enzymatic activity results in
  severe reduction or even loss of ST6Gal I processing, ultimately combining with
  accumulated environmental damage to produce an apparently “toxic” result. The loss
  of BACE1 activity is not properly compensated for by potential paralogues due to
  the abrupt nature of BACE1 inhibition.
