caption: Beneficial effects of hepatic CAV‐1 on atherosclerosis protection in DKO
  mice. Atherosclerosis is mainly driven by high circulating cholesterol concentration,
  low HDL‐C and high LDL‐C. In plasma of DKO mice fed WD, the low levels of LDL‐C
  can be attributed to increased SREBP2 in the liver, which increases LDLR expression
  and LDL‐C uptake. CAV‐1 is also associated with the LDLR and the process of influx
  of LDL from the circulation to the liver. In DKO mice, SHP is downregulated, suppressing
  the inhibitory effect on SREBP1c and CYP7A1 as well as increasing TG and BA biosynthesis.
  The increased hepatic CAV‐1 expression appears to provide additional beneficial
  effects in promoting hepatic TG accumulation via increased DGAT expression and increasing
  hepatic gene expression of lipogenic markers (ACC and FAS). Pparγ was also increased
  in DKO mice and correlated positively with Cav‐1 mRNA expression, supporting its
  role in upregulating CAV‐1. The lower TNFα, in combination with higher CAV‐1 expression
  in the liver further supports the potential anti‐inflammatory role for CAV‐1. In
  the absence of 27‐OHC in DKO mice, the rate‐limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis,
  HMGR is suppressed and cholesterol production is increased. Cholesterol is still
  metabolized to BA via the classical pathway of BA synthesis initiated by CYP7A1.
  The reduced transhepatic BA flux in DKO mice results in lower circulating LDL‐C,
  higher HDL‐C and TG concentrations; this leads to reduced atherosclerotic plaque
  formation. Green and red boxes represent up‐ and downregulation respectively.
