caption: Inhibition of mitochondrial Hsp90s activates apoptosis via opening of the
  permeability transition pore (PTP) and release of cytochrome c (Cyto c) in the cytosol.
  When titrated at non-lethal proteotoxic stress, this pathway results in induction
  of compensatory, pro-survival autophagy, stimulation of an endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) and changes in gene expression with suppression
  of NFκB-dependent transcription. Potential proposed regulators of these mechanisms
  are indicated. PQC, protein quality control.
