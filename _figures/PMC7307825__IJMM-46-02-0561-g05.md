caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway in which miR-93 attenuates LPS-induced
  acute lung injury. AgomiR-93 injection attenuated LPS-induced inflammation in a
  model of ALI by blocking the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ALI, acute lung injury; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation primary response 88.
