caption: Proposed model for how CCL2 signaling through CCR2 signaling regulates survival
  and motility of breast cancer cells. CCL2 binds to CCR2 to stimulate Smad3 and p42/44MAPK
  pathways. In one pathway, CCL2 induces MEK signaling through p42/44MAPK independently
  of Smad3 to promote cell survival. In addition, CCL2 activates Smad3, which cooperates
  with the MEK-p42/44MAPK pathway to regulate cell motility and survival through RhoA-dependent
  mechanisms.
