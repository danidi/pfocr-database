caption: A-B. Interphase Golgi membrane fusion mediated by NSF (A) and p97/p37 (B).
  Vesicles or Golgi membranes are tethered by the p115/GM130 complex, which facilitates
  SNARE-mediated fusion. The SNARE complexes are disassociated by NSF or p97 by ATP
  hydrolysis to allow next round vesicle fusion.C-D. Ubiquitin-mediated post-mitotic
  Golgi fusion by NSF (C) and p97/p47 (D). During mitosis, GM130 phosphorylation interrupts
  its interaction with p115 and facilitates Golgi vesiculation. After mitosis, ubiquitination
  operates as a general mechanism for Golgi cisternae regrowth. In the NSF pathway
  (C), GATE-16, a ubiquitin-like protein, recruits NSF onto the membranes. NSF then
  catalyzes GATE-16 to form a complex with GS28 and inhibits GS28-syntaxin 5 interaction
  in an ATP-hydrolysis independent manner. GATE-16 is released from the membrane by
  an unknown mechanism to allow SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion. In the
  p97/p47 pathway (D), HACE1 attaches ubiquitin onto unknown substrates on the Golgi
  membranes during mitosis; ubiquitination of these Golgi proteins may inhibit vesicle
  fusion. In late mitosis, the ubiquitin bound to a Golgi protein interacts with the
  UBA domain of p47 and recruits the p97/p47/VCIP135 complex onto Golgi vesicles.
  VCIP135 removes ubiquitin from Golgi proteins and allows p97/p47 to fuse the Golgi
  fragments into new cisternae. How p97/p47 regulates SNARE pairing and membrane fusion
  in this process is still unclear.E. Ubiquitin is not involved in post-mitotic Golgi
  fusion by p97/p37. During mitosis, p37 is phosphorylated and thus membrane fusion
  is inhibited. After mitosis, dephosphorylation of p37 allows membrane fusion similar
  to that in interphase (B). In this pathway, SNARE complex is disassembled by p97
  ATP hydrolysis, while the p97/p37 complex is disassembled by VCIP135.
