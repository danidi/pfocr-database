caption: During migration to the lumen, tumour cells suppress glucose uptake. Consequently
  NADPH and ATP levels decline. The decline in NADPH level increases the intracellular
  level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause cell death. The decline
  in ATP level induces the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which
  in turn inhibits fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and induces fatty acid oxidation (FAO).
  The inhibition of FAS reduces NADPH consumption, and the induction of FAO could
  generate malate independently of pyruvate. The conversion of malate into pyruvate
  regenerates NADPH. Therefore NADPH homeostasis is maintained to reduce the elevated
  ROS. A similar scenario may occur in circulating metastatic cells. ANT, adenine
  nucleotide translocator; CPT1, carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  OXPHO, oxidative phosphorylation; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel.
