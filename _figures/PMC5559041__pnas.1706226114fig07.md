caption: A working model depicting the regulation of the EBF1/2-PIF3 module in the
  expression of CBF genes under different conditions. At a warm temperature (22 째C),
  PIF3 protein is degraded by EBF1/2 through the 26S proteasome pathway in the light,
  whereas EBF1/2 proteins are degraded and PIF3 protein is stabilized in darkness.
  Under cold stress (4 째C), EBF1/2 proteins are degraded regardless of the light conditions,
  which increases the protein stability of PIF3. PIF3 directly binds to the promoters
  of CBF genes and represses their expression. It was shown that CCA1, LHY, PIF4/7,
  and PRRs are involved in circadian- or photoperiod-mediated regulation of CBF genes.
  In response to cold stress, ICE1 and CAMTA3 (CM3) play key roles in activating CBF
  gene expression.
