caption: SLP-76–dependent signaling pathways in NK cells stimulated through ITAM-bearing
  receptors. SLP-76 is recruited to the plasma membrane by LAT1/LAT2 indirectly through
  Gads in the canonical signaling pathway. In addition, the SH2 domain of SLP-76 is
  necessary for recruitment via ADAP to the plasma membrane through an unknown mechanism.
  The strength of downstream signals generated by the LAT family-dependent or ADAP-dependent
  SLP-76 pathway alone is sufficient for phosphorylation of AKT and ERK and for NK
  cell proliferation. However, both pathways are necessary for optimal IFN-γ production
  and cytotoxicity. Although depicted in the figure, note only LAT1, not LAT2, cooperatively
  binds PLC with SLP-76.
