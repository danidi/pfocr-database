caption: Model of mechanisms of repression of Mash1 by BMP-2/Id1. (A) In differentiating
  neurogenic precursors, Mash1 heterodimerizes with E proteins, which promotes phosphorylation
  of Mash1 on Ser152, increasing further heterodimer interaction. (B) Activation of
  the BMP signaling pathway leads to increased levels of Id proteins. Id proteins
  sequester E proteins away from Mash1, which leads not only to transcriptionally
  inactive complexes but also enhances degradation of Mash1 monomers.
