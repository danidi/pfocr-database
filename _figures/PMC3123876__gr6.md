caption: 'Profiling experiments and pathway analysis. A: 96 tumor cell spheroids (of
  defined cell numbers) and 2 × 105 fibroblasts were cultured for 3.5 days in collagen
  gels either as co-cultures or as individual cultures. The whole lysates from LS174T
  monocultures were mixed with fibroblast monoculture lysates (mix), thereby ensuring
  the same amount of tumor and fibroblast components present as in the co-culture
  experiments. The SFs (BJ-1), NCFs (CCD18-Co), and CAFs (12051CAF, 13388CAF; CAF1
  and CAF2, respectively) were used. All experiments were performed in biological
  triplicates. RNA extracted from the mixed and from the co-culture experiments was
  processed for Affymetrix GeneChip analysis (see  at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). A:
  Sammon blot. B: From GSEA the core genes of statistically significant gene sets
  were used to calculate PCA plots. A clear-cut segregation of the co-culture and
  the mixed monoculture experiments can be made (dotted line). Activation of ras oncogenic
  signaling detected in the c2-curated gene sets is shown. C: A 35-gene network clustering
  around NF-κB revealed by pathway analysis (Ingenuity). In this network, regulation
  (up: red; down: green) by distinct fibroblast origins is indicated. Dashed blue
  circles indicate gene expression changed by the presence of colon fibroblasts; genes
  altered by CAFs are boxed by dashed orange squares. Genes regulated by the presence
  of any fibroblast type are not encircled.'
