caption: 'Two logic circuit regulatory pathways targeting the PPIL2 gene, an important
  cyclophilin member in immunological suppression, are found by Loregic: 1: PPIL2
  is co-regulated by HDAC2 and SP1 forming the triplet of (RF1 is HDAC2, RF2 is SP1,
  T is PPIL2), which is consistent with the “T = ~RF1+RF2” gate (the ORN gate[]),
  and SP1 is co-regulated by EGR1 and NFYA forming the triplet of (RF1 is EGR1, RF2
  is NFYA, T is SP1), which is consistent with the “T = ~RF1*~RF2 (the NAND gate);
  2: PPIL2 is also co-regulated by BRF1 and NFE2 forming the triplet of (RF1 is BRF1,
  RF2 is NFE2, T is PPIL2), which is consistent with OR gate, and NFE2 is co-regulated
  by TAL1 and GATA2 forming the triplet of (RF1 is TAL1, RF2 is GATA2, T is NFE2),
  which is also consistent with OR gate. We replace the triplets on these pathways
  using matched logic gates, and depict the pathways using logic circuits to summarize
  the regulatory logics targeting PPIL2 at the pathway level.'
