caption: 'Left: Dectin-1 is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages, and recognizes
  molecules called β-glucans (dark green circles) on fungal cell walls. This recognition
  triggers the signaling pathways that activate transcription factors including IRF5
  and NF-κβ (), which cause anti-fungal genes to be expressed. Right: Chiba et al.
  found that Dectin-1 can also recognize N-glycan structures expressed on certain
  tumor cell lines. Recognizing these tumor cell signals activates IRF5 and perhaps
  other unidentified pathways, which causes tumoricidal action by natural killer (NK)
  cells. At least part of the mechanism for natural killer cell mediated tumor killing
  involves increasing the expression of the Inam gene. It would be interesting in
  the future to determine if Dectin-1 recognizes N-glycan structures as a proxy for
  the increased activity of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in tumor cells.'
