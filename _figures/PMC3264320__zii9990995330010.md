caption: Proposed mechanistic role of VimA in virulence modulation. VimA is an acetyl-CoA
  acetyltransferase found to be involved in the isoleucine degradation pathway, leading
  to acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA substrate can be used in fatty acid elongation, an
  important step in lipid A synthesis. PG1343 (lipoate protein ligase) and PG1948
  (lipoprotein) could be involved in binding of protein to the lipid A by means of
  lipoylation (PG1343) and N-terminal linkages (PG1948) (). In addition, lipoprotein
  PG1948 could also be C-terminally linked with the LPS associated with the peptidoglycan.
  Alteration in these linkages could affect the integrity of these structures, resulting
  in the lack of anchoring of the gingipains () and hence their appropriate biogenesis.
  It is also likely that the lipid A-associated proteins are important in gingipain
  biogenesis. Acetylation via acetyl-CoA, which is known to affect protein function
  in bacteria (), could control various protein functions, such as gingipain activation,
  thus leading to virulence modulation.
