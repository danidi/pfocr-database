caption: Hic-5, which is induced by TGF-β through a mechanism that is yet to be resolved,
  binds to and inactivates both Smad3 and Smad7. Inactivation of Smad7 through its
  degradation relieves the inhibitory action of Smad7 on TGF-β receptors, which leads
  to phosphorylation and thus activation of Smads 2 and 3. Depletion of Smad7 frees
  up Hic-5 and is expected to enable further binding to and suppression of Smad3.
  We thus propose that the overall effect of Hic-5 on TGF-β signaling is inhibition
  of Smad3-dependent pathway and enhancement of Smad2-dependent or Smad-independent
  pathway.
