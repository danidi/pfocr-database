caption: Effect of p32 knockdown (kd) on central carbon metabolism. The relative flux
  through the Embden-Meyerhof pathway (A, left) and the pentose phosphate pathway
  (A, right) and into the TCA cycle (B) was determined by [U-13C]glucose tracking
  and isotopomer analysis. Results are reported as the SD of triplicate integrations.
  (A) The 13C labeling pattern of alanine was used to determine glycolysis and PPP.
  Examples of labeling patterns are shown for glucose and pyruvate, where the open
  circles represent 12C and the filled circles represent 13C. Flux of glucose through
  glycolysis produces pyruvate that is either uniformly 12C or 13C labeled, while
  the rearrangements of the pentose phosphate pathway result in the loss of label
  at C-3. (B) Effect of p32 knockdown on TCA cycle entry and flux. Pyruvate can enter
  the TCA cycle through either pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) or pyruvate carboxylase
  (PC), which results in different patterns of glutamate labeling (gray circles represent
  either 12C or 13C). Determining the ratio of 13C at C-4 versus C-3 yields the ratio
  of PDH activity to PC activity. Knockdown of p32 results in a shift of pyruvate
  flux from PDH to PC (right graph). The relative level of succinate in each cell
  line was determined by integrating the peak volumes of succinate carbons C-3 and
  C-4 compared to glutamate carbons C-3 and C-4. Succinate pool size increased sevenfold
  following p32 knockdown (left graph). (C) Quantification of PDH enzymatic activity
  from control and p32 knockdown MDA-MB-435 cell lysates. The results are representative
  of four independent experiments and are expressed as percentages of PDH activity
  (±SD), with PDH activity in control cells as 100%. P was <0.001.
