caption: Web-accessible GnRHR pathway navigator. This selected part of the GnRHR-signaling
  pathway map notably displays the promoters of the gonadotropin β-subunit genes (FSHβ
  and LHβ subunits), their response elements, and transcription factors that bind
  to them and regulate gene transcription. Indirect regulators of gene transcription
  are also illustrated. Entities are clickable, such that corresponding annotations,
  namely the interactions in which those entities are involved, and the related PubMed
  references are displayed in the bottom left-hand frame. Additionally, other frames
  include an interaction list, a protein list, a gene list, and an RNA list. Hyperlinks
  to the relevant NCBI Entrez Gene page(s) and GnRH wiki pages are also provided.
  A zoom rectangle located in the upper left corner of the image facilitates navigation
  through the pathway ().
