caption: Genome-based metabolic model for cable bacteria with emphasis on electron
  flow and energy conservation during oxygen and nitrate-dependent sulfide oxidation.
  One anodic cell (Left) and one cathodic cell (Right) are shown. Electron transport
  between anodic and cathodic cells is indicated by red arrows. Gray dotted arrows
  indicate putative reactions with an unclear enzymatic foundation. Proteins detected
  in the proteome of Ca. Electronema sp. GS are indicated in purple boldface. Only
  marine cable bacteria possess the genetic potential for propionate assimilation.
  Apr, Adenosine phosphosulfate reductase; CA, carbonic anhydrase; CydA, membrane-bound
  cytochrome bd quinol oxidase–subunit A; CytB, cytochrome bc complex–subunit B; DCT,
  DsrC-trisulfide; Dsr, dissimilatory bisulfite reductase; MacA, cytochrome c peroxidase;
  Nap, periplasmic nitrate reductase; pCC, periplasmic cytochrome C; pMHC, periplasmic
  multiheme cytochrome (nitrite reductase); PolyP, polyphosphate; PpK, polyphosphate
  kinase; Psr, polysulfide reductase; Q(ox/red), quinone (oxidized or reduced); Qmo,
  quinone-interacting membrane-bound oxidoreductase complex; Rdh, rhodanese; Rieske,
  Rieske Fe-S domain protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Sat, ATP sulfurylase;
  SQR, sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; tHB, truncated
  hemoglobin; tHb-Cyt, truncated hemoglobin-cytochrome domain fusion protein; TusA,
  sulfur transferase; WLP, Wood–Ljungdahl pathway. Periplasmic enzymes include superoxide
  reductase and hydrogen peroxide reductase; cytoplasmic enzymes include catalase.
  Asterisk indicates an unknown molecular structure of the conductive fiber. We hypothesize
  that PilA (or possibly c-type cytochrome) monomers align along a periplasmic structure
  to form an electrically conductive fiber. Further details are provided in the main
  text and SI Appendix, SI Discussion.
