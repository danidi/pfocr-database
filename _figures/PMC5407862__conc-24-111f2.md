caption: Algorithm for the management of EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
  Molecular testing is recommended at multiple points along the treatment pathway
  for this patient population. Additional challenges arise because of the known benefits
  of treating oligometastatic disease, especially in the brain, and treating beyond
  classical radiologic progression. Clinical trials should be considered at all steps
  along the treatment path. aIf oligo-progression (such as isolated brain metastasis)
  occurs, consider local therapy and continuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor. bRe-biopsy
  currently required. Biopsy of growing lesion is recommended if possible. Testing
  can be performed on histology or cytology cell block. Consider testing plasma free
  DNA as an alternative if clinically available. cClinical trials are preferred at
  all treatment steps, if available. EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; TKI
  = tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
