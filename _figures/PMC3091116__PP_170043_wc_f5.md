caption: Protein factors and signaling pathways involved in photosynthetic redox control
  of plastid transcription. The photosynthetic electron transport chain and its protein
  complexes are depicted as in . The sketch refers to light conditions which preferentially
  excite PSII. Under these conditions the PQ pool becomes reduced, hence, activating
  the thylakoid-bound kinase STN7. This kinase is oppositely regulated at its lumenal
  side by a reduction signal from the Trx system that is not active under these conditions
  (). STN7 provides an input signal that presumably is integrated within a subsequent
  phosphorylation network targeted to the control of the PEP. PEP-associated proteins
  (PAPs) are given in yellow and described in text. One group of PAPs is mediating
  the phosphorylation signal, another one appears to integrate a second signal originating
  from the Trx system. Both signals together contribute to the transcriptional activation
  of the psaA/B operon (a mixed operon encoding a ribosomal subunit at its end [rps14,
  given in light pink]). The pathway by which Trx-z is reduced is unknown to date
  (question mark).
