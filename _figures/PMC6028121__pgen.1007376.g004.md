caption: (A) SparCC analysis of the microbial abundances of the taxa identified by
  LEfSe for tumors with LoF mutations in APC (left) and without mutation (right) produce
  distinct patterns of correlations (edges) between a common set of taxa (nodes).
  Direct correlations are indicated as red edges and inverse correlations as blue
  edges (SparCC R > = 0.25, P < = 0.05 for displayed edges). (B) SparCC analysis was
  run simultaneously for all taxa identified by LEfSe when predicting interactions
  with mutations in PID pathways. There are interactions (dashed edges) between the
  taxa (grey nodes) associated with mutations across sets of PID pathways (green nodes).
  The solid edges indicate SparCC R-values (red for direct and blue for inverse correlations).
  The grey taxon nodes are scaled to the average abundance of the taxa in the associated
  tumor set. Edge color indicates the direction of the interaction, red for negative
  and blue for positive. Note that while several of the pathways (green nodes) have
  closely related general functions (e.g. “Canonical Wnt signaling pathway” and “Degradation
  of beta-catenin”), the underlying gene sets that comprise these pathways are distinct
  and result in independent correlations with microbial taxa.
