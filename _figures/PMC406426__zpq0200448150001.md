caption: 'What is the role of mTLR7 in the antiviral response? Many ssRNA viruses
  (including VSV and influenza viruses) engage host cell receptors that trigger endocytosis.
  Once within endosomes, these enveloped virions fuse with the membrane to release
  their capsids into the cytosol. However, maturation and acidification of the endosomal
  vesicle may damage some viral particles, leading to ssRNA release. Human TLR8 (hTLR8)
  and mouse TLR7 (mTLR7), which are only expressed within endosomal membranes, recognize
  ssRNA [especially poly(U) and poly(U/G) motifs in the case of hTLR8], which triggers
  activation. Their associated signaling pathways involve myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88), IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), and tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which lead to NF-κB activation and
  inflammatory cytokine production. mTLR7 and hTLR8 might also activate a MyD88-independent
  pathway involving IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), or perhaps another IRF family
  member. This activation leads to the expression of type I IFNs. mTLR7 may also recognize
  ssRNA derived from viruses that release directly their capsids into the cytosol
  through plasma membrane fusion (data not shown). The mechanism by which ssRNA would
  find its way to the endosome in this case is not clear. TLRs 3 and 9 are also activated
  by viral nucleic acids: dsRNA- and DNA-bearing unmethylated CpG motifs, respectively.'
