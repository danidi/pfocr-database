caption: Domain structure of Sina/Siah and its regulation in Drosophila and mammals.
  (A) Domain structure of Siah E3 ubiquitin ligase. (B) Schematic of the signaling
  pathway regulating the specification of the R7 photoreceptor. Sina is placed epistatically
  downstream of the drosophila Ras–MAPK cascade. Boss, bride of sevenless; Sev, sevenless;
  Grb, growth factor receptor bound protein; Sos, son of sevenless; Phyl, phyllopod;
  Ttk88, tramtrack88. (C) Schematic of the transcriptional and post-translational
  pathways involved in regulating Siah1b in mammals. In mice, Siah1b is regulated
  by p53 while human SIAH1 basal transcription is regulated by Sp1. Post-translationally,
  Siah1b is regulated through phosphorylation by JNK or ATM/ATM during events of cellular
  stress like apoptosis and DNA damage. (D) Schematic of the transcriptional and post-translational
  pathways involved in regulating Siah2 in mammals. Estrogen signaling and hypoxia
  upregulate Siah2 transcriptionally. Twist1 and Ets2 are transcription factors reported
  to activate transcription of Siah2. Post-transcriptionally, activity of Siah2 is
  regulated by phosphorylation by multiple kinases – Dryk2, p38, MAPK, and HIPK2,
  or via physical interaction with USP13. This figure is all original content.
