caption: An overview of Notch maturation, activation and processing. Before integration
  into the plasma membrane, Notch receptor is decorated with different glycans by
  a complex series of enzymatic reactions occurring within the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) or the Golgi network. Post-translational adducts determine a differential responsiveness
  of Notch-expressing cells to the ligands. Thereafter, Notch receptor is cleaved
  at the level of the S1 cleavage site (S1) by a furin-like convertase residing in
  the trans-Golgi network. The cleavage results in the formation of a heterodimeric
  receptor, consisting of a Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and a Notch transmembrane
  domain (NTMD) held together by Ca2+-dependent ionic bonds [, ]. Similarly, also
  Notch ligand undergoes a “maturation process” consisting in its endocytosis, ubiquitination
  by the Neuralized and Mindbomb E3 ubiquitin ligases and “recycling” to the plasma
  membrane []. Notch ligands belong to the Delta/Serrate/LAG2 (DSL) protein family.
  After ligand binding, the mature Notch receptor is subjected to two successive proteolytic
  cleavages (S2 and S3 cleavage). The first cleavage is exerted by an ADAM metalloprotease
  (e.g. ADAM17) close the transmembrane domain to generate the Notch extracellular
  truncation (NEXT) fragment (S2 cleavage). The second is operated by the γ-secretase
  complex within the transmembrane domain of the NEXT fragment (S3 cleavage) or in
  endosomes, to dump into the cytoplasm the biologically active Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) (reviewed in []). In the cell nucleus, NICD forms a trimeric complex
  with RBPJ and MAML1, which initiates transcription of Notch downstream target genes
