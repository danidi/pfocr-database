caption: (A) Core components of the STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complex (striatin, Mob3,
  catalytic and scaffold subunit of the phosphatase PP2A, and STRIP proteins and the
  respective homologs) are depicted in green, putative homologs of the cortactin-binding
  protein CTTNBP2 are shown in red, putative homologs of SLMAP in light blue and putative
  SIKE/FGFR1OP2 in dark blue. STRIPAK GCKs and the associated CCM3 protein are indicated
  in violet. The arrangements of the subunits in the respective are deduced from [,
  , –]. (B) Components of the Hippo pathway in D. melanogaster and mammals are indicated
  in orange and green, respectively. Homologous components of the S. cerevisiae (Sc)
  MEN and RAM network and the corresponding S. pombe (Sp) SIN and MOR network are
  shown in the left and right boxes. Components from the filamentous fungus N. crassa
  (Nc) are shown in red according to []. The figure was modified from [].
