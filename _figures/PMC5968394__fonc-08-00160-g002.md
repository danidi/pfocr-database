caption: 'PI3K/Akt signaling facilitates ROS detoxification and redox homeostasis.
  The concomitant increase in the cellular antioxidant response is necessary for redox
  homeostasis, and this is largely mediated through NRF2 signaling, glutathione metabolism,
  and production of NADPH. AKT facilitates the activation of NRF2 by inhibiting the
  interaction with KEAP1 and alleviating the negative regulation imposed by GSK3-β.
  Functional NRF2 translocates to the nucleus and transcriptionally activates genes
  involved in the antioxidant response such as glutathione S-transferase and superoxide
  dismutase, as well as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which produces NADPH.
  Glutathione biosynthesis is an important antioxidant, which is regulated in a PI3K/Akt/Nrf2-dependent
  mechanism, and the conversion of glutathione between reduced (GSH) and oxidized
  (GSSG) forms is dependent on PPP-derived NADPH. Finally, Akt-independent signaling
  axes through SGK-1 may also promote ROS detoxification. Abbreviations: HK, hexokinase;
