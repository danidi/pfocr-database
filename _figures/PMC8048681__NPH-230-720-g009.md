caption: Working model of the MoSwa2‐mediated secretion pathway. During clathrin‐mediated
  endocytosis (CME), clathrin‐coated vesicles (CCV) mainly function in extracellular
  material uptake from the surface into intracellular compartments, endosomes or vacuole
  (V) for degradation (McMahon & Boucrot, ). The uncoating process of CCV is regulated
  by auxilin‐like protein Swa2, allowing the detached and uncoated vesicle to move
  to and fuse with its target endosome (Fotin et al., ; Xing et al., ). During the
  early secretory pathway, the COPII‐associated process mainly functions in cargo
  transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (G). The COPII
  coat consists of an inner shell (Sec23/Sec24) that sorts cargo and an outer shell
  (Sec13/Sec31) (Gurkan et al., ). There are two distinct secretory pathways for effector
  proteins secretion in Magnaporthe oryzae, Cytoplasmic effectors are delivered into
  the host via BIC and apoplastic effectors are secreted into the EIHM. Both pathways
  rely on vesicle transport initiated from ER (Khang et al., ; Giraldo et al., ).
  Here, MoSwa2 functions as an uncoating factor for CCV coats via phosphorylation
  by actin‐regulating kinase MoArk1, which displays conserved functions important
  in endocytosis via substrate phosphorylation in thee CME process (X. Li et al.,
  ). MoSwa2 also functions as an uncoating factor for COPII in the early secretory
  pathway, via interacting with COPII subunits MoSec24‐2 to mediate cytoplasmic and
  apoplastic extracellular effector secretion to inhibit the host immune response.
