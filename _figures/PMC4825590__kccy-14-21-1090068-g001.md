caption: Crosstalk between cell cycle regulators and cellular metabolism. (A) Transitions
  between phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2 and M) are orchestrated by cell cycle
  activators and inhibitors. In particular, the transition from G1 to the S-phase
  is of high importance for the regulation of proliferation and is controlled by cyclins
  (cyclinD), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, E2F family of transcription
  factors and the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) family members and E3 ubiquitin ligases
  (see panels B and C). At late G1, a nutrient-sensitive cell growth checkpoint (labeled
  as R) controls progression to S phase, and enables the cell to complete cell division,
  but only when sufficient nutrients are available. The glycolytic activator 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
  3 (PFKFB3) is transiently upregulated at this checkpoint (symbolized by higher intensity
  red color). Similarly, glutaminolysis is also critical for G1-to-S transition and
  in addition is also important for S to G2-M progression (symbolized by higher intensity
  blue color reflecting glutaminase1 (GLS1) activity). Furthermore, anaphase-promoting
  complex (APC/C) (purple) and Skp1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) (green) control the activities
  of PFKFB3 and GLS1 during the different stages of the cell cycle. (B) In response
  to mitogens, signaling pathway kinases convey proliferative signals to activate
  expression of cyclins. Enzymatically active complexes of cyclins and CDKs sequentially
  phosphorylate pRB family members. Binding of non-phosphorylated pRb to E2F prevents
  the transition from G1 to S-phase, induces cell quiescence and represses expression
  of genes involved in mitochondria biogenesis and function. However, phosphorylation
  of pRB releases its binding from E2F and thus inhibitory function and allows entry
  into S-phase. Activation of E2F not only leads to transcription of genes involved
  in cell cycle progression (e.g., cyclin E) but also enzymes involved in glucose
  metabolism (PFKFB). (C) Further crosstalk from the cell cycle back to metabolism
  is exemplified by the observation that APC/C, which is active during the M and G1
  phase (indicated in the cell cycle scheme in panel A by a purple inner line) promotes
  the proteasomal degradation of PFKFB3 and glutaminase 1 (GLS1), while the ubiquitin
  ligase SCF, active during G1 and S phase (indicated in the cell cycle scheme in
  panel A by a green inner line), targets only PFKFB3.
