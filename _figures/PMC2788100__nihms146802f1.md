caption: The CD24-Siglec G (mouse) or -Siglec 10 (human) pathway discriminates between
  Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) from Danger-Associated Molecular
  Patterns (DAMPs) by selective repression of the host response to DAMPs. We propose
  that DAMPs (but not PAMPs) bring CD24-Siglec G/10 into the proximity of TLR/NLR,
  thus allowing Siglec G/10-associated phosphatases such as SHP1 to repress the DAMP-initiated
  TLR/NLR signaling. Dysfunction of this pathway might contribute to the etiology
  of autoimmune disease.
