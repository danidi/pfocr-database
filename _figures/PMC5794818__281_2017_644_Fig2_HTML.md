caption: T cell activation induces autocrine and intracellular complement activation
  that regulates T cell metabolic function and inflammasome formation. T cell activation
  by TCR/CD28 results in the intracellular generation of C5a and the cathepsin L-mediated
  cleavage of intracellular C3 to C3a and C3b. Intracellular C5a activates cytosolic
  C5aR1, in addition to being translocated to the plasma membrane allowing interaction
  with the cell surface C5aR2. Activation of C5aR1 leads to an increase in intracellular
  ROS generation, which in turn results in the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  complex. Activation of C5aR2 by cell secreted C5a negatively regulates this process.
  Lysosomes containing the C3 cleavage products C3a and C3b are shuttled to the cell
  membrane leading to C3a and C3b mediated autocrine activation of C3aR and CD46,
  respectively. Activation of cell surface C3aR results in decreased expression of
  the regulatory T cell transcription factor FOXP3 and increased Th1 effector functions
  and IFNγ secretion. Cell surface CD46 forms a complex the Notch signaling activator
  Jagged1. Upon interaction of C3b to CD46, CD46 extracellular region is cleaved by
  metalloproteases and its intracellular cytoplasmic domains further cleaved by a
  presenilin-gamma secretase complex. Cleavage releases Jagged1 resulting in activation
  of the Notch signaling pathway. Translocation of the CD46 cytoplasmic tail to the
  nucleus results in increased expression of GLUT1 and LAT1 nutrient transporters,
  mTOR, and the NLRP3 inflammasome
