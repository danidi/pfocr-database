caption: 'This adapted figure from  is used to illustrate an example of a theoretical
  systems model showing genes involved in alcohol metabolism and alcohol’s effect
  on the brain’s reward pathway. Note that for the sake of simplicity, the figure
  does not represent all of the pathways involved, for example, projections from the
  ventral tegmental area to the amygdala and hippocampus. The figure depicts each
  of the three components of addiction (intoxication, withdrawal, and Preoccupation),
  which are mediated by different neurotransmitters and systems that are compromised
  by alcohol; solid and dotted lines indicate glutamatergic projections, dashed arrows
  represent dopaminergic projections. Abbreviations. Acb - nucleus accumbens; BNST
  - bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; CeA - central nucleus of the amygdala; CRF
  - corticotropin-releasing factor; DGP - dorsal globus pallidus; NE - norepinephrine;
  SNc - substantia nigra pars compacta; VGP - ventral globus pallidus; VTA, ventral
  tegmental area. Based on the segments shown, the presence of alcohol in the system
  is limited by the genetic profile of the metabolic system, while alcohol’s effect
  on the reward pathway is limited by variation in GABAergic transmission, glutamate
  transmission, and dopamine transmission. Gene names shown in italics indicates possible
  sources of variation in the system. Adapted by permission from Macmillan Publishers
