caption: Models for the interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment
  in the brain. a The STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways play key roles in tumor-associated
  astrocytes in brain metastases. (a) Reactive astrocytes show phosphorylation of
  STAT3 and expression of PD-L1, which may contribute to the suppression of CD8+ T
  cell function []. (b) Reactive astrocytes positive for STAT3 activation increase
  the number of CD74+ microglia-macrophages in brain metastases through production
  of the CD74 ligand MIF and consequent activation of the MIF-CD74 axis []. (c) The
  NF-κB pathway is activated in CD74+ microglia-macrophages []. (d) Cross talk between
  microglia-macrophages and astrocytes contributes to establishment of an immunosuppressive
  environment in primary brain tumors []. (e) Cancer cells transfer cGAMP to astrocytes
  through Cx43-PCDH7 gap junctions, resulting in activation of the cGAS-STING pathway
  in the latter cells []. (f, g) Production of IFN-α and TNF-α by astrocytes induces
  activation of STAT1 and NF-κB pathways in cancer cells and thereby supports brain
  metastasis []. b. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway plays a key role in brain metastases
  of breast cancer cells. (h) PI3K activation up-regulates PD-L1 and CTLA4 expression
  in cancer cells []. (i) Cross talk between cancer cells and macrophages results
  in activation of PI3K and CSF1-CSF1R signaling in macrophages []. (j) PI3Kγ signaling
  in macrophages inhibits NF-κB activation and promotes immune suppression in head
  and neck cancer []. (k) Loss of PTEN expression in cancer cells is induced epigenetically
  by exosomal miRNAs released from astrocytes []. (l, m) PTEN loss results in increased
  expression of the chemokine CCL2 and activation of NF-κB signaling in cancer cells
  as well as in the consequent CCR2-dependent recruitment of macrophages []
