caption: Effects of anthocyanins on neuroinflammation. Inflammatory stimuli, such
  as deposits of aggregated proteins, cause activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4),
  and downstream induction of extracellular regulated signal kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2),
  Akt, and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK), which subsequently activate
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in microglia and astrocytes. NF-κB then translocates to
  the nucleus and initiates transcription of pro-inflammatory genes including, but
  not limited to inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
  NADPH-oxidase-2 (NOX-2), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). It is thought that
  anthocyanins inhibit this pathway by blocking activation of TLR4, ERK1/2, Akt, and
  p38-MAPK.
