caption: 'Altered proteins that are involved in metabolism processes related to de
  novo lipid synthesis: aconitase 2 (ACO2) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), which
  participate in tricarboxylic acid cycle (TAC) (i) decreased; ATP-citrate synthase
  (ACLY), the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA
  (ii) decreased; 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-1 (PRKAA1)
  that repress the synthesis of malonyl-CoA (iii) by phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase increased; glucose 1-dehydrogenase/6-phosphogluconolactonase (H6PD),
  the rate-limiting enzyme in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (iv) decreased; 6-phosphofructokinase
  type C (PFKP) that acts as the rate-limiting enzyme, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
  C (ALDOC), which are involved in glycolytic pathway(v) decreased.'
