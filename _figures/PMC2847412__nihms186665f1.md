caption: This schematic diagram of the ERSR pathway includes how expression levels
  of several of the genes encoding ERSR proteins are altered during EAE. EAE was induced
  by priming SJL mice with proteolipid protein (PLP) 139–151 peptide emulsified in
  Freund’s complete adjuvant. At the peak of disease, lesion and peri-lesion regions
  of spinal cords from EAE mice, as well as comparable regions from the spinal cords
  of naïve SJL mice, were collected by laser dissection, and a gene array was performed.
  The color and direction of the arrows indicate which genes were up- or down-regulated
  for each region in comparison to the others. Lesions consist of multiple cell types
  and therefore these data may not give an accurate picture at a cellular level, and
  it is quite clear that the changes in gene expression within the pathway are heterogeneous.
  However, a trend for upregulation of genes that are important in activating pro-apoptotic
  signals such as ATF4 and ATF6 was evident within EAE lesion compared to peri-lesion
  and naive controls. Many of the genes in the PERK part of the ERSR pathway were
  downregulated in lesions. Further work at a protein level is required to confirm
  these data.
