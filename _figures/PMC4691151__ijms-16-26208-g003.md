caption: 'Proposed diosgenin biosynthetic pathway. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  is converted to mevalonate by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) enzyme.
  This is the major rate limiting step of isoprenoid pathway. Mevalonate is converted
  to isopentenyl pyrophosphate via series of multiple reactions. Then, diosgenin is
  produced from squalene by two routes: via cholesterol from lanosterol and via sitosterol
  from cycloartenol to sterol 3-β-d-glucoside. Finally, the latter is converted to
  diosgenin by sterol 3-β-glucosyl transferase (STRL) enzyme (dashed lines indicate
  multiple steps involved in the pathway; arrows indicate the flow of reaction in
  pathway).'
