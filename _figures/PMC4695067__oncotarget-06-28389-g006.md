caption: 'The cartoon shows the proposed scenario: the tumor microenvironment (VEGF-A,
  FGF-2 and EGF provided by the cancer cells and stroma) triggers and sustains the
  expression of trypsinogen 4 by the endothelium. Upon secretion and activation, trypsinogen
  4 cleaves TFPI-2, particularly rich in the endothelial ECM. The displacement of
  TPFI-2 permits EC migration and hence favors angiogenesis and blood vessel remodeling.
  The mechanism of release and activation of trypsinogen 4 remains to be elucidated,
  although there is evidence indicating its activation by cathepsin B [].'
