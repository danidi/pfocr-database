caption: Molecular model for the regulation of wheat lamina joint development by TaSPL8.
  TaSPL8 directly binds to the TaARF6 and TaD2 promoters to activate their expression.
  TaARF6 mediates the auxin signaling pathway, whereas TaD2 is involved in BR biogenesis.
  Both hormones are well known for regulating cell elongation, lamina joint development,
  and leaf angle. WT, wild type.
