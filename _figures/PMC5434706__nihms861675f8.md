caption: Schematic model of NUMB6-induced EMT in the regulation of cancer cell migration
  and invasion. The interaction of NUMB6 with Akt signaling pathway by unknown mechanism
  mediates induction of Slug transcription factor, ultimately leading to EMT. We found
  that EMT activation by NUMB6 overexpression triggered DB-7 cells migratory and invasive
  behavior. Because Akt pathway has been shown to affect cancer cell migration and
  invasion, we showed that chemical inhibition of the Akt phosphorylation abolished
  Slug expression in NUMB6 DB-7 cells, which in turn displayed reduced migration and
  invasion in vitro.
