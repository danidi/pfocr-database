caption: 'The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a multisystem, endocrine
  cascade that regulates electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure through actions
  on the kidney and heart. RAAS overactivation is pathologic, and multiple pharmacologic
  agents have been devised, both in experimental phase (white ovals) and in clinical
  use (shaded ovals), to target various levels of RAAS activation. Heart failure treatment
  is multimodal with combinatorial pharmacologic agents including inhibitors of RAAS
  as well as of other neuroendocrine systems that become pathologically overactivated
  in heart disease. Aldosterone is the terminal effector of the RAAS pathway, and
  advantages of targeting aldosterone synthesis or its receptor activation include
  specificity and avoidance of the aldosterone escape phenomenon. While the two mineralocorticoid
  receptor blockers (MRBs), spironolactone and eplerenone, have emerged to the front-line
  of heart failure therapy, the aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASIs) such as FAD286
  and LCI699 are still currently in experimental phase (). Other abbreviations: ACEI=angiotensin
  converting enzyme inhibitor, ARB=angiotensin receptor blocker, AT1R=angiotensin
  II receptor, CYP11B2=aldosterone synthase.'
