caption: Different stages in the RNA polymerase II CTD cycle. Physical or functional
  interactions are shown as black arrows, enzymatic activities with red arrows. Phosphorylations
  are shown as small pink (low level) or large red (high level) crosses. A. In the
  preinitiation complex (PIC), transcription activators (ACT) recruit RNApII by interacting
  with the Mediator (MED). Once in the PIC, Mediator stimulates the TFIIH kinase (H),
  which phosphorylates CTD Ser5 and Ser7. CTD phosphorylation then triggers Mediator
  dissociation. B. In early elongation, CTD Ser5P helps recruit mRNA capping enzymes,
  the H3K4 methyltransferase, and the yeast early termination pathway machinery. Ser7P
  (or 5P/7P) also recruits Integrator to mammalian snRNA genes. Early CTD Ser2 phosphorylation
  is triggered by association of the Cdk9/Bur1 kinase with Ser5P and/or capping enzymes.
  This kinase also phosphorylates the Spt4/5 elongation factor, which then contributes
  to elongation and nucleosome methylation via the PAF complex. Spt4/5 may also interact
  with mRNA capping enzymes (not shown). C. In late elongation, the yeast Ctk1/Lsk1
  or mammalian Cdk9 kinases more extensively phosphorylate Ser2. This modification
  helps recruit Spt6 and the H3K36 methyltransferase to co-transcriptionally modify
  chromatin. Ser2P also interacts with polyadenylation and termination machinery at
  mRNA 3′ ends.
