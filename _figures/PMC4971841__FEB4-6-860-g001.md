caption: Schematic of the biosynthetic pathway of the post‐translational modification
  hypusine. Hypusine is formed within two subsequent steps. In the first step DHS
  transfers an aminopropyl moiety from the triamine spermidine to a specific lysine
  residue in the EIF‐5A precursor protein to form the deoxyhypusine intermediate.
  DOHH introduces a hydroxyl group into the side chain and thus completes hypusine
  formation. Targeting was performed for the eIF‐5A precursor protein and the DHS.
