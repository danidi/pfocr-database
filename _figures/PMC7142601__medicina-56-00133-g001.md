caption: 'The four step working pathway to calculate the direct aggregated pharmaceutical
  costs for one attempt “outpatient” non-bismuth eradication therapies of Helicobacter
  pylori (Hp). All prototypes and generics drugs included in both first- and second-line
  treatment regimens were collected to calculate the overall cost per therapeutic
  choice. * Data regarding drug prices were collected and double-checked using two
  databases; a governmental website of the Greek National Organization for Medicines
  (https://www.eof.gr/web/guest/home) and a commercial, routinely used medical platform
  (https://www.galinos.gr/). PPI: proton pump inhibitor.'
