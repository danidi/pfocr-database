caption: Receptor signalling pathway for all-trans retinoic acid (at-RA). Cellular
  retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABP) protect at-RA from non-specific degradation
  and transport it to the nucleus. Retinoid receptors recognise and bind to a DNA
  sequence motif termed a retinoic acid response element (RARE). This motif is composed
  of two repeats of a hexameric motif, separated by a variable number of nucleotides
  (N)—in this schematic we show a five-nucleotide separator sequence (DR5-RARE) as
  highlighted in red. Once at-RA is liganded to a receptor, this initiates a signalling
  cascade in the canonical mechanism whereby nuclear co-activators are recruited.
  Expression of proximal genes to the RARE sequence is upregulated via the action
  of the co-activators which alter chromatin availability, for example, histone acetylation
