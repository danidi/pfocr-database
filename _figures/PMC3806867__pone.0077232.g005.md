caption: The most significantly altered upstream regulator in xenograft compared to
  2D according to IPA; the HER2 pathway with arrows pointing to the top five changing
  genes shown in Table 1. Genes in red were upregulated in xenografts, and genes in
  green were downregulated. The 200 most upregulated and the 200 most downregulated
  genes in the xenografts compared to the 2D cultures were subjected to IPA analysis
  using the log-fold differences in expression as comparison values.
