caption: Summary of the current model of the GET pathway. Sgt2 is the most upstream
  factor identified thus far that captures nascent TAs after completion of protein
  synthesis (step 1). Sgt2 transfers TA to Get3, and this step is stimulated by the
  Get4/5 complex that bridges between Sgt2 and Get3 (step 2). Get3 further delivers
  TA to the Get1/Get2 receptor complex, which mediates the insertion of TA into the
  ER membrane (step 3).
