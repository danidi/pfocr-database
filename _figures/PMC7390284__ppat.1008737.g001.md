caption: ORF1a/1b encode a polyprotein, which is proteolytically processed into Nsp1–16,
  represented in blue. Structural proteins, including S, E, M, and N proteins are
  in green. Accessory proteins encoded at the 3′ end of the viral genome comprise
  ORF3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, 9c, and 10 and are colored in orange. Untranslated
  extremities of the genome (5′-UTR and 3′-UTR) are also represented. In red are depicted
  SARS-CoV-2 proteins that interfere with IFN induction pathway as well as their known
  or hypothetic target [, , ]. E, envelope; IFN, interferon; M, membrane; MAVS, mitochondrial
  antiviral-signaling protein; N, nucleocapsid; Nrdp1, neuregulin receptor degradation
  protein-1; Nsp, nonstructural protein; ORF, open reading frame; RNF41, ring finger
  protein 41; S, spike; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2;
  TANK, TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1;
  Tom70, translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70; UTR, untranslated region.
