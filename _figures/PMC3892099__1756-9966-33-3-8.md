caption: Summary of parthenolide-induced signaling pathway in NSCLC cell lines. Briefly,
  PTL induces ER stress response and eventually results in up-regulation of DDIT3
  which could increase the expression of TNFRSF10B and PMAIP1 by binding to their
  promoter sites as a transcription factor. As the critical members of extrinsic and
  intrinsic apoptotic pathway respectively, TNFRSF10B and PMAIP1 consequently activate
  these two pathways to induce apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.
