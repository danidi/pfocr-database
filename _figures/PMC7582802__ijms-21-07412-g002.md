caption: Dual role of p38 activation during preconditioning and ischemia–reperfusion
  injury. Activation of p38β during preconditioning triggers pro-survival signaling
  pathways, whereas decreased p38α activation during the ischemic episode leads to
  cardioprotection. On the other hand, ROS-induced p38α activation during the ischemic
  insult triggers HIF1-α stabilization; increases (↑) fibrosis, arrhythmias, and inflammation;
  and disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis. SB203580 administration during preconditioning
  increases myocardial injury, whereas administration during ischemia–reperfusion
  improves cardiac outcome. Indirect p38 downregulators, such as gamboge, statins,
  and antioxidants, seem to have beneficial effects when administered during or after
  the ischemia. Further research is needed to determine the precise reciprocity of
  ROS–p38 regulation. ↑ increase.
