caption: Citrate generate in TCA cycle is exported to the cytosol to fuel the mevalonate
  and fatty acid (FA) synthesis pathways by conversion to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate
  lyase (ACLY). Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases (ACAT) is the first enzyme of cholesterol
  synthesis pathway that converts acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA, which functions
  as a substrate for the synthesis of mevalonate by HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS), followed
  by the reductase (HMGCR). The latter is the rate-limiting step for the production
  of cholesterol, which is the precursor to androgens. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC)
  initiates the first committed step to FA synthesis to produce malonyl-CoA. Seven
  malonyl-CoA molecules are added to acetyl-CoA by fatty acid synthase (FASN) to produce
  palmitic acid, a 16-carbon saturated FA (SFA). Palmitic acid can be further elongated
  to form long SFAs and/or desaturated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and by
  other desaturases to produce monounsaturated FA (MUFAs). The reducing factor nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is essential for FA synthesis, is
  provided by pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), by malic enzyme (ME1), which produces
  pyruvate from malate (shunt malate-pyruvate), and by cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH1) to produce α-ketoglutarate (αKG) from isocitrate (shunt isocitrate αKG).
