caption: Proposed mechanisms of LPS-induced suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis
  in the renal cortex. Systemic LPS exposure leads to activation of TLR4, which, in
  turn, initiates signaling through the TPL-2/MEK/ERK pathway via phosphorylation
  (P). ERK1/2 activation contributes to multiple downstream effects of LPS, including
  renal dysfunction, suppression of PGC-1α, and subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis
  and production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β. Disruption
  of PGC-1α and MB leads to progressive renal dysfunction and prevents recovery after
  sepsis-induced AKI (). TNF-α production also contributes to renal dysfunction and
  decreases PGC-1α transcription to further amplify LPS-mediated effects (; ).
