caption: 'The NF-κB Signaling system may be described in terms of two interconnected
  networks: the NF-κB network (left) that depicts monomer expression (inducible in
  green arrows), pre-cursor processing and other regulated steps (blue), and dimer
  formation (black arrows); and the IκB network which depicts IκB synthesis (green
  arrows), IκB interactions with NF-κB dimers (black inhibitory connectors), and IκB
  degradation (blue arrows). Understanding how the kinetic mechanisms in each network
  combine to control the activity of multiple NF-κB dimers in different cell types
  remains an important future goal.'
