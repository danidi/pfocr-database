caption: A MetaCyc superpathway. Superpathways are composed of several smaller pathways
  and are used to provide a more comprehensive view of a metabolic process. In this
  example, multiple pathways that relate to chorismate metabolism (e.g., chorismate
  biosynthesis, tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis, enterobactin biosynthesis) are integrated
  into a single diagram. Since superpathways can be very large, Pathway Tools automatically
  displays them at a lower detail level, trying to fit the full diagram on the screen.
  In this example, enzymes, genes, and even some of the metabolite intermediates are
  not displayed. The user can click the “More Detail” button at the top to increase
  the detail level incrementally, adding all intermediates, enzymes, and finally metabolite
  structures to the display.
