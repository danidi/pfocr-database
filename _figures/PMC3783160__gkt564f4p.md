caption: Model of the interactions of Rrp1 and Rrp2 with the mediators of two branches
  of HR DNA repair pathway and helicases Rqh1 and Srs2. Adapted from (). See text
  for details. CO = crossing over, DSBR = double-strand break repair, GC = gene conversion,
  SEC = second end capture, SDSA = synthesis-dependent strand annealing.
