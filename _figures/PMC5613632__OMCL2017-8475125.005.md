caption: 'The nucleoredoxin-like 1 gene encodes for a superthioredoxin system. (a)
  In the absence of RdCVF signaling mediated by the complex BSG1/GLUT1, the reduction
  of oxidized RdCVFL in cones by thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) and NADPH is limited
  by glucose uptake rate. (b) The extracellular truncated thioredoxin RdCVF accelerates
  glucose uptake by its interaction with the BSG1/GLUT1 complex at the surface of
  cones. The concentration of NADPH produced by the pentose phosphate pathway is increased.
  Consequently, the reduction of RdCVFL is ameliorated so that the combination of
  extracellular RdCVF and intracellular RdCVFL constitutes a superthioredoxin system.
  Glc: glucose, lact: lactate, and ROS: reactive oxygen species. Circles represent
  metabolites and their diameters and their concentrations. Yellow: glycolysis, Orange:
  triglyceride synthesis, and purple: pentose phosphate pathway.'
