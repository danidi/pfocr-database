caption: 'Notch-Delta-Jagged signaling. (A) The Notch pathway is activated when the
  Notch receptor of one cell interacts with the ligand of a neighboring cell leading
  to cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and its release into the cytoplasm.
  NICD acts as a transcription factor and controls the expression of many genes, including
  Notch receptors and ligands. However, while it directly activates the expression
  of Notch receptors, the Jag1 ligand, and transcription factor Hes1 (which acts as
  an inhibitor of any gene expression), it indirectly inhibits Dll1 expression through
  Hes1. The special family of fringe proteins (Lfng and Mfng) increases the Notch
  receptor’s affinity to bind to Dll1 and decreases it for Jag1, thus promoting lateral
  inhibition over lateral induction. (B) Jag1/Notch signaling forms a double positive
  feedback loop between the two neighboring cells and forces them to adopt the same
  fate/phenotype: high expressions of the Notch receptor, Jag1, Hes1, and low Dll1
  expression. The Jag1/Notch cells both send (due to Jag1 ligands) and receive (due
  to Notch receptors) signals [a so-called hybrid Sender/Receiver (S/R) phenotype].
  The mechanism that promotes this phenotype is known as lateral induction. (C) Dll1/Notch
  signaling causes a double-negative feedback loop between the two neighboring cells
  promoting them to acquire two opposite fates/phenotypes (a “salt-and pepper” pattern):
  Sender (S; high Dll1; low Notch, Hes1, and Jag1) and Receiver (R; high Notch and
  Hes1; low Dll1 and Jag1). The mechanism that promotes the two opposite fates/phenotypes
  is known as lateral inhibition.'
