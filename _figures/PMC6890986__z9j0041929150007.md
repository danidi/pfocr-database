caption: Overview of pyroptosis. The sentinel event in pyroptosis is the creation
  of pores in the plasma membrane by gasdermin D (GSDMD). GSDMD is activated through
  cleavage by inflammatory caspases (caspases-1, -4, and -5 in humans). Procaspase-1
  is activated in response to diverse stresses including infection, toxic insults
  impinging on the cell, and multiple intracellular stresses [e.g., reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), cytosolic DNA, and others]. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) resulting from these stresses
  promote assembly of inflammasomes, which are subcellular multiprotein complexes
  in which procaspase-1 activation takes place. This involves the sensing of PAMPs
  and DAMPs by pattern recognition receptors such as NOD-like receptor (NLR) pyrin
  domain (PYD) containing receptor 3 (NLRP3). NLRP3 subsequently recruits ASC, which
  recruits and activates procaspase-1 (see text for details). Other proteins besides
  NLRP3 can also function as the “apical” protein in inflammasome assembly. Inflammasome
  formation is “primed” through transcriptional and nontranscriptional mechanisms
  (see text for latter). Transcriptional priming occurs downstream of Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) and TNFR1 through NF-κB-mediated increases in NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase-1
  expression. In addition, the expression of downstream effectors in this pathway
  including the cytokines pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18 are also transcriptionally
  upregulated. Noncanonical activation of procaspase-4 and -5 can also take place
  through their binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytoplasm. Once activated,
  inflammatory caspases cleave and activate GSDMD as noted above and process pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 to their mature forms, which escape through GSDMD-generated pores.
  Interaction of NLRP3 with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and cardiolipin
  facilitate inflammasome assembly and activation.
