caption: Inflammation-derived oxidative stress leads to a vicious cycle inside the
  damaged neurons and causes neuronal death. Sustained release of neurotoxic factors
  from activated microglia continually bombards neurons and increases neuronal oxidative
  stress during chronic neuroinflammation. The oxidative stress causes mitochondria
  dysfunction, which could upregulate the expression of neuronal NOX, produce more
  ROS and lead to progressive neurodegeneration.
