caption: DNA damage induces DNA replication arrest and DSB repair in the germline.
  First, stalled replication forks in mitotic dividing cells induce the S-phase cell
  cycle checkpoint via activation of the ATL-1- and CHK-1-dependent pathway. Second,
  programmed meiotic DSBs will be repaired by homologous recombination, whereas persistent
  unrepaired DSBs and/or aberrant recombination intermediates will be removed by apoptosis
  via activation of the CEP-1/p53-mediated DNA damage checkpoint. ZTF-8 participates
  both in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and in DSBR. We propose that
  ZTF-8 acts via the 9-1-1 complex in transducing DNA damage signaling for repair
  of both mitotic and meiotic DSBs and meiotic germ cell apoptosis.
