caption: Schematic representation of the linkage between SAMe, SAH, sarcosine metabolic
  pathway and methionine cycle. Sarcosine can either be taken up or formed from dimethylglycine
  (DMG) by DMGDH (EC 1.5.8.4). Alternatively, sarcosine can be formed from glycine
  by GNMT (EC 2.1.1.20). Sarcosine can be N‐demethylated by SARDH (EC 1.5.8.3) or
  PIPOX (EC 1.5.3.1) to glycine with the latter providing the methyl‐donor, SAMe,
  in the methionine cycle. Finally, SAMe is demethylated into SAH, which is associated
  with the methylation of an acceptor (R) into RCH 3. EC, enzyme classification number
  of the International Union of Biochemistry.
