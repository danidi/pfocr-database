caption: A) Box plots showing mRNA and protein expression of DNMT1, in untreated and
  treated J82 cells with NNK (p<0.005) and their quantification. B) The role of DNMT1
  in methionine pathway. C) Isotopic distributions of 13C labeled methionine pathway
  metabolites showing down regulation of SAM and upregulation of SAH upon treatment
  with NNK and reverse with NNK followed by AZA in J82 cells. D) Correlation of DNMT1
  expression with EMT scores from multiple public cohorts. F, G) mRNA and protein
  expression of N-cadherin, E-Cadherin and vimentin in J82 cells treated with NNK
  and BaP (p <0.005) and their quantification. β-actin was used as the loading control.
  I) Working model showing the alterations in BLCA associated with smoking.
