caption: Diagram on chromosomal engineering for mevalonate production. Relevant metabolic
  reactions include glycolysis pathway, mevalonate pathway, and TCA cycle. Red line
  indicates that ATP inhibits glycolysis, while the green arrow represents that the
  ATP-limiting condition stimulates glycolysis. The red X represents deletion of the
  sucA gene, and the black Xs represent homologous recombination of pathway genes.
  Pi, inorganic phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; DHAP,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglyceric
  acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvic acid; PYR, pyruvate.
