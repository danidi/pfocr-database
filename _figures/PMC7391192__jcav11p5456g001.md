caption: The relationship between the p53 gene and expression of the IGF-I-R gene
  by contrasting the outcomes of pathways regulated by functioning, wild type p53
  gene and mutant, non-functional p53 gene. As demonstrated above a mutant p53 cannot
  suppress the expression of the IGF1R gene, leading to tumor growth while diverging
  from the apoptosis pathway .
