caption: NVP would block NMDA receptors in GABA interneurons, thus inducing a disinhibition
  of glutamate release. Glutamate would evoke a rapid stimulation of AMPA receptors
  (AMPAR) localized to plasma membrane of pyramidal cells, which would result in a
  rapid intracellular activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II that
  would eventually activate mTOR pathway. On the other hand, the direct blockade of
  NMDA receptor-induced synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by NVP could also activate
  mTOR pathway. Downstream mediators of mTOR would be responsible for the induction
  of protein synthesis, thus increasing the dendritic synthesis of GluA1. Further,
  the rapid release of BDNF accounted for by the increased intracellular Ca2+ would
  possibly be responsible for the rapid antidepressant-like action of NVP
