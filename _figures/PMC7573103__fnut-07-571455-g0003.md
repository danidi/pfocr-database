caption: Signaling pathways in TNBC targeted by multiple components of the MD oils.
  Signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway facilitates cell proliferation, invasion,
  and survival. Growth factor receptors (e.g., insulin receptor, human epidermal growth
  factor receptors) activate PI3K, which activates Akt and subsequently mTOR. Components
  from the MD shown to have inhibitory effects on this pathway include DHA from fish
  oil in addition to oleocanthal and oleanolic acid from olive oil. COX2 is involved
  in BC initiation, inflammation, invasion and metastasis. Under basal conditions
  NF-κB (p65 and p50) is sequestered in the cytosol by inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins.
  Activation of inflammatory cytokine receptors (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
  receptor) activates inhibitory κB kinase (IKK) complexes, which phosphorylate IκB
  proteins for degradation leading to stabilization and nuclear translocation of NF-κB.
  In the nucleus, NF-κB activates a myriad of target genes, such as Ptgs2, the gene
  encoding the COX2 protein. MD components that inhibit this signaling pathway include
  the fish oil ω-3 fatty acids in addition to oleuropein, oleanolic acid and oleocanthal
  from olive oil. Finally, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway increases TNBC cell
  proliferation, migration and chemoresistance. Under normal conditions, β-catenin
  is sequestered and degraded in the cytosol by a destruction complex containing axin,
  adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3)β and casein
  kinase (CK1). Interaction of Wnt ligands with receptor complexes (e.g., low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)5/LRP6/frizzled) leads to dissociation
  of β-catenin from the destruction complex, which leads to its stabilization and
  nuclear accumulation. Both DHA from fish oil and hydroxytyrosol from olive oil have
  inhibitory effects on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
