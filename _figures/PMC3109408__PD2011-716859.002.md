caption: 'Simplified diagram of Kynurenine pathway: during neuroinflammation, 95%
  of the dietary tryptophan is metabolized along the KP within the brain. The remaining
  5% serves as a precursor to the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin. IDO
  catalyses the initial and rate-limiting step in the degradation of tryptophan through
  KP that ultimately leads to the production of nicotinamide.'
