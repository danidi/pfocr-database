caption: Feed-forward relay for decoding signal duration. Recent studies by Blenis
  and co-workers have elucidated a potential mechanism for decoding the duration of
  a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) response [,]. The decoder essentially
  works as a feed-forward relay system. Activated MAPK induces transcription of intermediate-early
  genes such as c-fos. After c-fos is transcribed and translated, it can be degraded
  by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway or stabilized by MAPK-1,2 interaction and phosphorylation.
  If the duration of MAPK activation is short compared with the lag associated with
  c-fos transcription and translation, there will be little activated (MAPK*) to phosphorylate
  the newly synthesized c-Fos protein, and c-Fos is ubiquitinated (c-Fos–Ub) and degraded.
  However, if the duration of MAPK activation is longer than the time required for
  transcription and translation of c-fos, MAPK* can bind to and phosphorylate c-Fos
  (c-Fos–P) and protect it against degradation. In turn, the stable c-Fos stimulates
  the transcription of Fos-dependent genes, even after MAPK is deactivated and, thus,
  the initial signal is propagated across time scales.
