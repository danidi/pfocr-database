caption: Evasion of the DNA-sensor-mediated IFN-I signal pathway by HSV-1. Cytosolic
  DNA sensors, such as cGAS, IFI16, DDX41, and DAI, recognize double-stranded DNA
  in the cytosol and trigger IFN-I production through transmission of a series of
  signals. Multiple steps in the DNA-sensor-mediated IFN-I signal pathway can be targeted
  by HSV-1 proteins, including both DNA-sensor-mediated viral recognition and subsequent
  signaling. Solid lines indicate confirmed interactions between host molecules and
  HSV-1 proteins. Dashed lines indicate uncertain interactions that need to be studied
  further. CBP, CREB-binding protein; P, phosphate; Ub, ubiquitin.
