caption: Three major branches of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling pathway
  and their interconnections. Under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions,
  damaged proteins accumulate within the ER lumen and bind to binding immunoglobulin
  proteins (BiPs), which in turn dissociate from transmembrane complexes with activating
  transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α) and the protein
  kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) in attempt to refold the
  proteins. As a result, three branches of the UPR become activated and trigger adequate
  stress responses. ATF6, after cleavage in Golgi apparatus, enters the nucleus to
  activate cytoprotective genes. It also upregulates X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1)
  mRNA, which is subsequently spliced by IRE1α to enhance the pro-survival effect.
  The main downstream target of PERK, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α
  (eIF2α), inhibits the global protein synthesis, with the exclusive translation of
  specific mRNAs such as activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Both nuclear factor-like
  2 (Nrf2) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO) proteins, directly phosphorylated by
  PERK, are responsible for antioxidant and cell survival mechanisms. Additionally,
  PERK may act on FOXO indirectly via phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt)
  signaling pathway. Apoptosis may be induced either by IRE1α, via c-Jun N-terminal
  kinases (JNKs) signaling pathway, or by PERK-mediated C/EBP homologous protein transcription
  factor (CHOP).
