caption: A schematic pathway for miRNA biosynthesis and the degradation of target
  mRNA. (A) Primary miRNAs are formed by polymerase II that folds back to form a hairpin
  structure. Splicing and further processing in the nucleus include the interactive
  role of different proteins and the CAP-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80. Further
  processing occurs by DCL1 and forms miRNA-miRNA* duplexes, which are methylated
  by HEN1 and transported to the cytoplasm. The mature miRNA is unwound to yield a
  22-nt single-strand and incorporated into AGO1-containing RISC (RNA-induced silencing
  complex) and other regulatory proteins that directly inhibit the translation or
  cleavage of the target mRNA transcript. (B) Leaf development is a complex biological
  process with multiple regulatory networks regulated by miRNA and their target genes.
  The leaf development consists of different stages such as establishment, transition,
  modification, and senescence. The miRNAs play important roles in each stage. The
  miR160 and miR165/166 control leaf initiation; leaf polarity is determining by miR165/166
  and miR390; leaf morphology is regulating by miR164 and miR319; phase initiation
  is determined by miR156 and miR172; leaf senescence is determined by miR164 and
  miR319 (the arrows indicate positive and T-shaped indicate negative regulation).
