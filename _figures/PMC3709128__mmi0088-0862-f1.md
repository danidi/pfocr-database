caption: The siderophore biosynthetic pathway of A. fumigatus and A. nidulans. The
  enzymes boxed in purple are described in the text. Enzymes transcriptionally upregulated
  during iron starvation are marked by red arrows. The enzymes identified in this
  study to localize to peroxisomes are framed in yellow. Adapted from Haas ().
