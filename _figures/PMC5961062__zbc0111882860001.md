caption: 'Oxidation and reduction reactions and their relationship to biosynthesis.
  A, NADPH is used to reduce oxidized precursors, and NADPH can be regenerated from
  NADP+ by the oxidative pentose pathway, malic enzymes, and other reactions. B, NAD+
  is used to oxidize reduced precursors in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and biosynthetic
  pathways. NAD+ is regenerated from NADH by lactate dehydrogenase and by the electron
  transport chain, which reduce pyruvate and oxygen, respectively. C, transamination
  reactions involve a change in redox state for the substrates and products. Oxidation
  of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate reduces NAD+ to NADH or transaminates an α-keto
  acid to an amino acid. For all panels, the half-reactions in red are reduction reactions,
  and those in blue are oxidations. Abbreviations used are: αKG, α-ketoglutarate;
  pentose-P, pentose phosphate.'
