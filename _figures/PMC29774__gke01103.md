caption: Excerpt from a UM-BBD generated  metabolic pathway. This pathway was generated
  starting from the  reaction from dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethyl sulfide. In the
  original  all enzyme and compound names are hyperlinked to UM-BBD reaction  and
  compound pages, respectively. The complete generated pathway page  is available
  at http://umbbd.ahc.umn.edu/cgi-bin/page.cgi?ptype=p&reacID=r0207.
