caption: Signalling pathways leading to the phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). The following scheme is a simplification of the events
  and only the salient features of the pathways are outlined. Receptor protein tyrosine
  kinase (RPTK) agonists (for example, insulin) stimulate the activity of phosphoinositide
  3′ kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PtdInsP3). PtdInsP3 remains in the plane of the membrane, activating 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1) and also causing translocation of protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt)
  to the membrane where it is phosphorylated on Thr308 and partially activated by
  PDK1. Phosphorylation of PKB/Akt(Ser473) by the mammalian target-of-rapamycin complex
  2 (not shown) fully activates the kinase. PKB/Akt subsequently phosphorylates the
  two GSK3 isoforms on a Ser-residue in each of their N-terminal domains to inhibit
  their activities (see ). Gq-protein-coupled receptor (GqPCR) agonists (for example,
  endothelin-1 (ET-1)) stimulate phospholipase Cβ which hydrolyses PtdIns(4,5)P2 to
  produce diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The former is the physiological
  activator of the diacylglycerol-regulated protein kinase C isoforms (which can also
  be activated by the tumour-promoting phorbol esters), whereas the latter is important
  in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ movements. Protein kinase C activates the
  extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade, which involves the
  small guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras. Conversion of Ras.GDP to its biologically
  active form, Ras.GTP, leads to the hierarchical activation of three levels of protein
  kinases. Raf phosphorylates and activates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases
  1/2 (MKK1/2), which then phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2. The signalling pathway
  then diverges. One consequence of activation of ERK1/2 is their phosphorylation
  and activation of the p90-ribosomal subunit S6 kinases (RSKs), which phosphorylate
  and inhibit GSK3. Some RPTK agonists (for example, epidermal growth factor, EGF),
  in addition to activating PKB/Akt (), activate the ERK1/2 cascade by stimulating
  GTP/GDP exchange on Ras via the Grb2/Sos guanine nucleotide exchange factor system,
  and thus activate Ras. In addition, PKB/Akt also activates the mammalian target-of-rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTOR). This leads to phosphorylation and activation of p70/p85-ribosomal
  subunit S6 kinases (S6Ks), thence to phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3. Agents
  that raise cyclic AMP concentrations and activate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
  A (PKA) may bring about phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3, though the physiological
  significance of this mode of regulation is somewhat obscure.
