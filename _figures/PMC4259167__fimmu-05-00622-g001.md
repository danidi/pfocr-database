caption: Anti-tumor functions of γδ T cells. (A) γδ T cells can recognize tumor cells
  through interaction with (i) TCR ligands, such as phosphoantigens (P-Ags), F1-ATPase,
  BTN3A1, EPCR, …, and (ii) innate receptor ligands, such as ULBP, MICA/B, and nectin-like
  5. Following sensing of tumor antigens or stress signals, γδ T cells are activated
  and can kill tumor cells through cytotoxic mechanisms that rely on the perforin/granzyme
  pathway, the death receptor pathway in response to TRAIL or Fas-L expression, and
  ADCC in the presence of tumor-specific antibodies. (B) γδ T cell activation leads
  to TNF-α and IFN-γ production and CD40-L expression that promote DC maturation and
  T cell differentiation into Th1 cells. IL-17-producing γδ Th17 cells favor Th17
  effector cell development. Th1 and Th17 effector T cells display anti-tumor functions
  to control tumor development. (C) Through a trogocytosis mechanism, activated γδ
  T cells can capture and express CD1d molecules and then promote iNKT cell activation.
  Activated γδ T cells can also display APC functions (MHC I and II, CD40, CD83, and
  CD86 expression) and activate both naive and effector T cells with cytotoxic activity
  against tumor cells. (D) Activated γδ T cells can provide a co-stimulatory signal
  to NK cells through CD137L expression to promote their anti-tumor activity. (E)
  In the presence of specific signals, activated γδ T cells can display a Tfh profile
  (i.e., IL-4, IL-10, and CXCL13 production and CD40-L expression) to help B cell
  antibody production. Although not yet demonstrated, production of antibodies against
  specific tumor antigens could be involved in the humoral anti-tumor response.
