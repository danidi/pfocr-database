caption: 'Classic basal ganglia model representing (A) normal condition, (B) Parkinson’s
  disease, and (C) Parkinson’s disease with LID.Notes: Normally dopaminergic input
  from SNc facilitates motor movement through excitatory response on direct pathways
  via D1 receptors and reduces motor movements through inhibitory response on indirect
  pathways via D2 receptors. Loss of dopaminergic input from SNc influences both direct
  and indirect pathways. There is underactivity of the direct pathway and overactivity
  of the indirect pathways, resulting in decreased glutamatergic output from the thalamus,
  causing hypokinetic movements. Chronic levodopa therapy overstimulates both D1 and
  D2 receptors, with opposite influence on direct and indirect pathways leading to
  increased thalamo-cortical glutamatergic output causing LID. Green arrows indicate
  inhibitory, GABA connections; red arrows, excitatory Glut (glutamatergic) connections.Abbreviations:
  GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GPe, globus pallidus externa; GPi, globus pallidus interna;
  L-DOPA, levodopa; LID, levodopa-induced dyskinesia; PD, Parkinson’s disease; SNc,
  substantia nigra pars compacta; SNr, substantia nigra pars reticulata; STN, subthalamic
