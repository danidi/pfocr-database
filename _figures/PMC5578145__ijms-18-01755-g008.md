caption: Changes in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, Calvin cycle, and
  biosynthesis pathway of sucrose and starch in response to rapid changes in temperature
  in M. baccata leaves. The red box represents a protein only upregulated at 20 °C
  as compared to that at 5 °C. Green boxes indicate proteins only downregulated at
  0 °C as compared to that at 5 °C. Oxford blue boxes indicate proteins downregulated
  at both 20 and 0 °C as compared to that at 5 °C. The light blue box indicates a
  protein only downregulated under calcium treatment at 0 °C. The orange box represents
  a protein upregulated at both 20 °C as compared to that at 5 °C, and under calcium
  treatment at 0 °C. AGPase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; Cytb6, cytochrome b6;
  Cytf, cytochrome f; FNR, ferrdoxin-NDAP + reductase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; GBSS, granule-bound starch synthase; LHCI, PSI light-harvesting complex;
  OEC, oxygen-evolving complex; PC, plastocyanin; Pheo, pheophytin; PQ, plastoquinone;
  PQH2, plastoquinol; PRK, phosphoribulokinase; and UGPase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.
