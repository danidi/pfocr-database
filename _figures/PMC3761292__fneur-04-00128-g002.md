caption: (A) The basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops involved in motor control. The
  internal globus pallidus (GPi) is the main output nucleus of the basal ganglia and
  it has inhibitory projection to the thalamus. The direct pathway projects from the
  striatum to the GPi. Inhibition of the GPi facilitates movement by increasing thalamocortical
  projections. On the other hand, the indirect pathway through the external globus
  pallidus (GPe), subthalamic nucleus (STN), GPi, and thalamus inhibits the excitatory
  thalamocortical output. The hyperdirect pathway through cortico-subthalamic nucleus
  projection is considered to suppress motor programs through facilitation of the
  GPi. (B) Schematic diagram showing the center facilitation surround inhibition model.
  The direct pathway shown in the center facilitates the movement whereas the indirect
  pathway in periphery of the projection inhibits the competing motor patterns for
  the specific movement. STN modulates the cortex through both the hyperdirect and
  the indirect pathways.
