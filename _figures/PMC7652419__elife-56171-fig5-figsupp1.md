caption: 'Metabolism of [1,6-13C2]glucose in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons produces
  GluC4, which is then decarboxylated to GABAC2 by GAD enzyme in GABAergic neurons.
  The glutamate–glutamine and GABA-glutamine cycle operating between neurons and astrocytes
  produce GlnC4. Other versions of 13C-labeled glutamate (GluC4) and GABA (GABAC4)
  are produced in the subsequent metabolism of GluC4 and GABAC2. In the astrocytes,
  PyruvateC3 can enter the TCA cycle via the pyruvate carboxylate pathway and subsequently
  produce the 13C-labeled metabolites namely GlnC2, GluC2, and GABAC4. Only the first
  round of TCA cycle is depicted here for simplicity. Abbreviations: αKG: α-ketoglutarate;
