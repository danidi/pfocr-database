caption: Mechanism of the TNF-α and collagen mediated activation of pro-MMP-9 in human
  dermal fibroblasts. Based on our results and those of others, we propose the following
  pathway for pro-MMP-2 activation, showing the role of TNF-α and the interplay between
  molecules involved in the pro-MMP-2 activation cascade. Binding of TNF-α and type
  I collagen to their receptors activates the NF-κB signaling pathway by inducing
  the breakdown of IκB, the cellular inhibitor of NF-κB. NK-κB then translocates from
  the cytosolic compartment into the nucleus. Binding of NF-κB to the NF-κB responsive
  cis-element in the promoter of the mt1-mmp gene triggers the transcription of mt1-mmp.
  Elevated levels of MT1-MMP mRNA generate MT1-MMP protein, which then translocates
  to the plasma membrane and forms a functional complex with TIMP-2. In contrast,
  mmp-2 gene transcription is constitutively active in fibroblasts and pro-MMP-2 accumulates
  in the extracellular environment. Increased MT1-MMP protein on the cellular membrane
  promotes cleavage of the N-terminal pro-domain of the 72 kDa pro-MMP-2, increasing
  the amount of the 62 kDa active form of MMP-2.
