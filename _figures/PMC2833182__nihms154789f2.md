caption: Classification of metabolic reactions. (A) Examples of Similar (S), Connected
  (C), and Unrelated (U) reactions from the Arginine and Lysine biosynthesis pathways.
  ArgB and LysC share a co-substrate (ATP) that undergoes the same transformation
  (to ADP + Pi). Similarly, ArgC and Asd transform NADPH to NADP+. By these criteria,
  both pairs are classified as Similar (S). At the same time, reaction pairs ArgB/ArgC
  and LysC/Asd are adjacent in the pathway, since the product of the first reaction
  is the substrate for the next. These reaction pairs are classified as Connected
  (C). All other pairs of reactions (ArgB/Asd, ArgC/LysC) are classified as Unrelated
  (U). In this example, only the enzymes classified as similar (ArgB/LysC and ArgC/Asd)
  have the same fold. (B) Detailed information on the enzymes in subpanel A. (C) Bars
  representing the relative number of pairs with the same fold in each category of
  reactions.
