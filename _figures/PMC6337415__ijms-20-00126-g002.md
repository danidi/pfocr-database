caption: Effects of acidosis on insulin sensitivity and release. Low extracellular
  pH may interfere with insulin sensitivity and release in different ways. (a) Acidosis
  switches the cellular metabolism from glycolysis to other metabolic pathways, like
  glutamine metabolism via the Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) deacetylase activity that deacetylates
  hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) proteins, or via the inhibition of the expression
  of glycolytic enzymes or through the increase of monocarboxylate transporter MCT1/MCT4
  pathway; (b) acidosis induces the transcription and the protein expression of TGF-β
  that, in turn, inhibits insulin release at the systemic level; (c) acidosis reduces
  at least 40% the binding affinity between insulin and IR; (d) acidosis interferes
  with the recycling process of both IR and insulin, by modifying the lysosome intraluminal
  pH and the number of lysosomes (blue arrow, the route of protons, black arrows,
  the route of insulin/IR complexes; T-bar, inhibition).
