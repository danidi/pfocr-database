caption: The Notch signalling pathway. Notch is a contact dependent signalling pathway.
  When a Notch ligand contacts a Notch receptor this initiates a cleavage event through
  the enzyme γ-secretase, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD
  then translocates into the cell nucleus, where it pulls down various proteins, such
  as MAML, and associates with the Notch effector, CBF1. This association turns on
  transcription, with the Hes and Hey family of genes prominent examples of genes
  transcribed by this cascade. The γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT is able to prevent activation
  of the Notch signalling pathway as the NICD is unable to be cleaved.
