caption: '. Illustration of the key proposed mechanisms of tissue cell injury induced
  by DOM with photographs of target sites. The diagram shows the interaction between
  the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminal. Glutamate receptors in target tissues
  such as the hippocampus are activated by EEAs such as DOM, which at the same time
  induces the release of glutamate. The figure shows vesicular release of glutamate
  into the synaptic space, activation of the post synaptic receptor systems, re-uptake
  into the pre synaptic terminal, and surrounding glia cells (astrocytes). DOM and
  glutamate activate the various glutamate receptors present in the postsynaptic membrane,
  inducing cellular injury through a common injury pathway, a process known as excitotoxicity.
  This process can be separated into several overlapping components:1)The iGluRs are
  ion-gated channels selective to Na+, K+ and Ca+2 and any sustained stimulation of
  these receptors may results in osmotic tissue damage. Hence, neuronal cell swelling
  reflects the influx of extra cellular Na+, Cl− and water. Focal swellings along
  the dendrites called varicosities are early structural changes and are viewed as
  a hallmark of excitotoxic neuronal injury. 2) Activation of iGluRs triggers the
  influx of Ca+2 from the extra cellular environment to the synaptic cleft. This stage
  is marked by delayed cell degeneration. The accumulation of Ca+2 is the crucial
  determinant of injury. This elevation of Ca+2 triggers the activation of several
  enzymes: calmodulin (CAM), protein kinase (PKC), nitric oxide synthase (NO synthase),
  phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Evidence indicates that
  the mitochondrion plays a central role in the processes of excitotoxic neuronal
  cell degeneration with a web of interactions between Ca+2 homeostasis, ATP production,
  and the generation and detoxification of ROS. 3) GluRs are found localized at the
  synapse within electron dense structures known as postsynaptic density (PSD), mediating
  the binding of GluRs to sub membrane proteins such as actin and PDZ containing proteins.
  These proteins mediate protein-protein interactions. GluRs PDZ-containing proteins
  bind to numerous signal molecules including nitric oxide synthase, providing a mechanism
  for clustering GluRs with the corresponding signalling transduction protein. These
  GluRs associated proteins and excitotoxic signalling result in a free radical cascade
  and activation of enzymatic processes causing extensive damage of cell structures
  and ultimate cell death. 4) Astrocytes, as do neurons, express GluRs providing the
  binding effectors site for DOM and show degenerative structural changes in response
  to DOM exposure. Failure of astrocytes to remove extra cellular glutamate is one
  of the key compounding mechanisms implicated in DOM neurotoxicity. (Diagram - modified
