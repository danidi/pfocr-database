caption: The mechanism of IDO1 regulation on viral infectious diseases. Innate defense
  occurs when pathogens contact or invade host cells and elicit the production of
  cytokines and chemokines, which in turn induce an influx of immune cells that affect
  pathogen clearance. Type I IFNs are critical mediators of innate immunity and limit
  disease caused by many viruses [, ]. The enhancement of TRP breakdown by IDO1 regulates
  the signal pathway for IFNs production, and TRP metabolites might contribute to
  the function of IFNs producing cells.
