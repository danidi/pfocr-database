caption: A model illustrating the N-end rule pathway in the modulation of autophagy.
  Cytosolic misfolded proteins are normally degraded through ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation (Steps 1 and 2). Some misfolded proteins (e.g., mHTT) may be prone to
  aggregation (Step 3) and, thus, are difficult to be degraded by the proteasome.
  In neurodegenerative diseases, these proteasome-resistant oligomeric aggregates
  grow into fibrillar forms and large inclusions (Steps 4 and 5). In protein quality
  control, cells sense the accumulation of such misfolded proteins and their aggregates,
  inducing Nt-arginylation of ER-residing proteins, such as BiP (Steps 6 and 7). Nt-arginylated
  ER proteins accumulate in the cytosol. Cytosolic R-BiP is associated with misfolded
  protein cargoes (Step 8) and binds the ZZ domain of p62 through its Nt-Arg (Step
  9). Upon binding to Nt-Arg, p62 undergoes a conformational change, exposing PB1
  and LC3-interaction domain (Step 10). This accelerates self-polymerization of p62,
  resulting in the formation of cargo–R-BiP–p62 protein aggregates (Step 11). The
  binding with Nt-Arg also enhances p62 interaction with LC3 on autophagic membranes
  (Step 11), leading to the delivery of cargo–R-BiP–p62 complexes into autophagosomes
  (Step 12). In this study, we developed small molecule ligands to p62 ZZ domain.
  Our results suggest that ligand-bound p62 acts as an autophagic inducer (Steps 14
  and 15) by enhancing the synthesis of LC3-I and its conversion into LC3-II and promoting
  the formation of autophagosomes
