caption: Schematic of the kynurenine pathway with relevant regulatory components,
  summarizing gene expression and metabolite changes previously identified for schizophrenia
  in the frontal and anterior cingulate cortex. The significant changes that had been
  identified for bipolar disorder (not shown) were limited to increased kynurenine
  and increased mRNA for the HM74 receptor (; ). TDO2, HM74A and HM74 had been analyzed
  in previous studies for mRNA (RT-PCR [&; ] and protein (via quantitative Western
  blots or semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (,; ) and several of the remaining
  enzymes had been analyzed for mRNA expression only (RT-PCR, ). The metabolites had
  been quantified by HPLC (, ). Enzymes are presented in boxes and denoted with their
  HUGO identifier. Not all steps are depicted, e.g. the signaling cascades for the
  receptors. The models (see Discussion) for the relevant points of potential interaction
  between the melanotropin receptors and the kynurenine pathway genes, gene products
  or metabolites are denoted models 1, 2, and 3. Note that the regulatory role of
  the niacin receptor genes for the kynurenine pathway can only be inferred from the
  fact that administration of niacin does not allosterically inhibit TDO2 to any significant
  extent, but by some other means, leads to remission of the kynurenine-mediated de-novo
  synthesis of NAD from tryptophan in pellagra patients (). Niacin treatment of schizophrenia
  patients has been reported to result in remission of psychosis ().
