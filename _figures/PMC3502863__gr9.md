caption: Lipid raft–mediated CD44 and ezrin interaction model. The CD44 cell migration
  pathway reconstructed using immunoprecipitation experiments and logical modeling.
  Horizontal arrows indicate the resulting flux when transiting from a stationary
  to migratory cell phenotype. Our model suggests that the transit between a stationary
  and migratory state is associated with release of CD44 from lipid rafts (possibly
  via depalmitoylation), whereupon nonraft CD44 can bind phosphorylated (active) ezrin
  to initiate migration.
