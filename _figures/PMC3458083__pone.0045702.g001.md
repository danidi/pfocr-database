caption: Alanine is biosynthesized through the action of the ALT1-encoded aminotransferase
  (1). It is proposed that alanine is also synthesized through the irreversible action
  of glutamine aminotransferase (2), which belongs to the ω-amidase pathway, this
  enzyme catabolizes glutamine to α-ketoglutaramate leading to the formation of NH4
  and α-ketoglutarate (3). Dashed lines indicate that TCA cycle enzymes are inactive
  when grown on glucose as the sole carbon source, except those leading to the replenishment
  of α-ketoglutarate.
