caption: Schematic pathway of the protective effects of the D2R on renal inflammation.
  The protective effects of the D2R on renal production of inflammatory factors are
  exerted at least in part through enabling Akt dephosphorylation by PP2A. Decrease
  or lack of D2R function leads to enhanced Akt phosphorylation. Downregulation of
  the D2R is also associated with decreased expression of the PP2A regulatory subunit
  PPP2R2C that physically interacts with the D2R, indicating that the D2R is required
  for normal renal PP2A activity, termination of Akt signaling (Akt dephosphorylation),
  and inhibition of NF-κB.
