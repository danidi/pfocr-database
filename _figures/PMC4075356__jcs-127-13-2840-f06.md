caption: An Irf6-dependent pathway regulating keratinocyte migration. IRF6 regulates
  Arhgap29, a GTPase-activating protein that promotes the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP,
  thus returning RhoA to an inactive state. In the absence of IRF6, Arhgap29 levels
  are decreased, leading to increased activity of RhoA, increased prominence of stress
  fibers and impaired cellular migration. Blocking the Rho-associated protein kinase
  ROCK rescues IRF6-dependent migration. IRF6 could also negatively regulate E-cadherin
  to promote migration.
