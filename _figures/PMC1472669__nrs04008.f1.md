caption: In cells not expressing the oncoprotein v-ErbA (top), TR (green) and RXR
  (blue) are actively imported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complexes
  (NPC). In the nucleus, TR is phosphorylated (red circle), which may serve to modify
  its activity and enhance nuclear retention. In the nucleus, TR and RXR bind to DNA
  response elements as homodimers or heterodimers, and modulate transcription of T3-responsive
  genes (green arrows). Although TR and RXR are shuttling proteins, the balance between
  nuclear import, nuclear retention, and nuclear export is such that these two receptors
  are almost entirely localized in the nucleus at steady state. Their nuclear export
  may be mediated by calreticulin, but this requires further evaluation. In contrast,
  in the presence of the oncoprotein v-ErbA (red symbol) (bottom), RXR and TR either
  dimerize with v-ErbA on some response elements, or are blocked from DNA binding
  sites by competition with v-ErbA monomers. In both cases, this interferes with the
  normal transcriptional activity of T3-responsive genes (red crossed arrows). In
  addition, a significant fraction of RXR and TR exits the nucleus “piggyback” style
  by a CRM1-dependent pathway in association with v-ErbA and its viral NES. TR and
  RXR may be actively anchored in the cytoplasm by the retroviral Gag moiety of v-ErbA.
  The mislocalization of TR, RXR and possibly other coactivators by v-ErbA blocks
  these transcription factors from their normal function in the nucleus. Together,
  all these mechanisms contribute to cellular transformation by v-ErbA, resulting
  in cancer.
