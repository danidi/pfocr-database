caption: Mechanism and function of PARP and PARP inhibitors. The catalytic function
  of PARP1 is activated through binding to the SSBs site cuased by alkylating agents.
  Activated PARP1 undergo PARylation and recruitment of a serials of key DNA repair
  effectors involved in BER to repair DNA lesion. Finally, PARP1 release from DNA
  and regain inactive state. PARP inhibitors binds the catalytic site of PARP and
  impaired of the enzymatic activity of PARP which “trap” PARP1 on DNA, results in
  suppression of the catalytic cycle of PARP1 and BER. Trapping PARP1 on DNA lesion
  also collapses DNA replication fork, therefore transforming SSBs into genotoxic
  DSBs. This type of DNA lesion would normally induce HR for repairing damaged DNA.
  However, if HR-defective exist in tumor cells, including BRCA1/2 deficiency or mutation,
  another less effective and error-prone DSBs repair pathway NHEJ or alt-NHEJ could
  be utilized, which causing genomic instability, chromosomal fusions/translocations
  and subsequently inducing cell death. SSBs, single-strand breaks; DSB, double-strand
  break; BER, base excision repair; alt-NHEJ, alternative nonhomologous end joining;
  NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; HR, homologous recombination repair.
