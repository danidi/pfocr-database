caption: 'The Nrf2/Keap1/ARE pathway in type II diabetes mellitus. (A) Under nonstressed
  conditions, the Nrf2 transcription factor is covalently bound to cysteine residues
  on its native repressor Keap1 in the cytoplasm. This results in the constitutive
  ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2 in the proteasome and inhibition of the anti-oxidant
  response. (B) Under conditions of electrophilic or oxidative stress, cysteine residues
  on Keap1 are modified, resulting in the stabilization and translocation of Nrf2
  into the nucleus, where it can bind to the promoter region of the ARE and initiate
  the transcription of various cytoprotective enzymes which function to promote cellular
  survival through a variety of mechanisms, including the upregulation of antioxidant
  function, inflammatory inhibition, and the transport of toxic metabolites. These
  cellular adaptations have been shown to improve a wide array of tissue damage underlying
  the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes. (B) There are three major mechanisms
  of Nrf2 induction by small molecule activators. (I) Upstream kinases such as Akt
  and Erk phosphorylate Nrf2 at specific sites, favoring its release by Keap1 and
  nuclear translocation. (II) Modification of Keap1 cysteine residues disrupts the
  Nrf2-Keap1 complex, favoring dissociation of Nrf2 and subsequent nuclear translocation.
  (III) Inhibition of Nrf2 ubiquitination by Keap1 and degradation by the proteasome
  augments Nrf2 availability, thus favoring nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Ub: ubiquitination;
  P: phosphorylation.'
