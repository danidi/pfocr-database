caption: 'Schematic illustrating how TNF acts via the Wnt pathway leading to the development
  of the myofibroblast phenotype. [1] In the resting state, cytoplasmic β-catenin
  is phosphorylated by GSK-3β. This modification targets β-catenin for ubiquitination
  and proteosomal degradation. [2] Ligation by Wnt of the receptor complex comprising
  Frizzled and LRP5/6 leads to phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3β. Thus, β-catenin
  escapes modification and subsequent degradation, leading to accumulation of cytoplasmic
  β-catenin, which participates in cell–cell adherens junctions and also translocates
  to the nucleus. Here it binds to the transcription factors TCF/Lef and promotes
  the expression of genes typically associated with myofibroblasts: COL1 and α-SMA.
  Subsequent cytoskeletal assembly of α-SMA protein produces the contractile apparatus
  of the cell, with attachments to neighboring cells via cadherins and the matrix
  via integrins. Wnt ligand–receptor binding is competitively inhibited by Dkk-1,
  leading to resumption of β-catenin degradation. SB-216736 is a small molecule that
  increases the phosphorylation and thus specifically inhibits the activity of GSK-3β.
  [3] In palmar dermal fibroblasts from patients with Dupuytren''s disease, TNF binding
  to TNFR leads to GSK-3β phosphorylation and inhibition, thereby releasing β-catenin
  from degradation and enabling the transcription of COL1 and α-SMA genes and assembly
  of an α-SMA–rich cytoskeleton. Li ions restore GSK-3β activity in these fibroblasts,
  thus enhancing β-catenin degradation and reversing the effect of TNF activation.
  [4] Binding of TGF-β1 to TGF-β1R1/2 leads to Smad2/3 phosphorylation and activation.
  The latter recruits Smad4 and, on entering the nucleus, leads to transcription of
  the same genes as the β-catenin TCF/Lef complex, namely COL1 and α-SMA. The interaction
  of TGF-β1R1/2 with Smad2/3 is selectively inhibited by SD-208.'
