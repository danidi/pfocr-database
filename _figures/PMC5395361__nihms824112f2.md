caption: Intrinsic and extrinsic signals received by the upstream control sequences
  1 through 4 (UCS1-4) of the IME1 regulatory region. Nutrient signaling and the transcriptional
  regulators a1/α2 and Rme1 are essential to maintaining expression patterns of IME1.
  In diploids, the a1/α2 heterodimer, encoded by the MATa/MATα locus releases Rme1-mediated
  repression of IME1. In haploid cells, Rme1 promotes the expression of the lncRNA
  IRT1 from this region. Histone methyltransferases Set1 and Set2 are recruited co-transcriptionally
  and their respective methyl marks promote HDAC containing complexes Set3C and Rpd3C(L)
  chromatin association, repressing IME1 expression. Tup1 is also postulated to repress
  IME1, potentially as a parallel pathway promoting HDAC recruitment, however its
  precise role is unknown. IME1 expression initiates a transcriptional cascade, including
  inducing NDT80, which leads to the sporulation-specific gene expression program
  required for the meiotic divisions and spore formation.
