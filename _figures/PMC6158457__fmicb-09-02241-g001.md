caption: The native and heterologous metabolic pathway for salicylate 2-O-β-D-glucoside
  (SAG) biosynthesis established within E. coli. The native TyrA, PheA, Pgm, and GalU
  steps were either deleted or over-expressed (bold); whereas the heterologous Irp9
  and Ugt74F1 steps were introduced from Yersinia enterocolitica and Arabidopsis thaliana,
  respectively.
