caption: Oncogenic signals regulate each stage of translation. Oncogenic stimuli (red)
  such as PI3K-AKT-mTOR, Myc, and Ras promote protein synthesis by coordinating the
  regulation of ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation, and translation elongation.
  The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway promotes ribosome biogenesis through both enhanced
  rRNA synthesis and enhanced ribosomal protein production (; ; ). This signaling
  pathway stimulates translation initiation predominantly through mTORC1-dependent
  hyperactivation of eIF4E. In the absence of signaling, hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs
  bind to and inhibit eIF4E, blocking its ability to interact with eIF4G. PI3K-AKT
  signaling activates mTORC1, initiating a series of phosphorylations that release
  4E-BPs from eIF4E. This allows for eIF4G binding to eIF4E and the subsequent recruitment
  of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Furthermore, S6K1/2 downstream mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) affects the efficiency of translation initiation and elongation
  (). In addition, Ras-MAP kinase signaling up-regulates eIF4E activation via phosphorylation
  at serine 209. Myc promotes protein synthesis by increasing the transcription of
  multiple translational components including eIF4E mRNA. Together, these oncogenic
  stimuli regulate the multiple stages of translation to drive both global changes
  in protein synthesis as well as selective changes in the translation of specific
  mRNAs. Multiple approaches (blue) are used to therapeutically target the translational
  apparatus including rapamycin, ATP-active site inhibitors of mTOR, MNK1/2 kinase
  inhibitors, 4EGI-1, and eIF4E antisense oligonucleotides (ASO).
