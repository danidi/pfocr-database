caption: Expression changes in genes of the TGF-β signaling pathway in lungs of mice
  exposed to nickel as measured by oligonucleotide microarray and reverse transcriptase–polymerase
  chain reaction (RT-PCR). (A) Changes in gene expression are expressed using the
  GenMAPP format. Genes that were increased atleast 1.5-fold over control values and
  had a significance value of p ⩽ 0.05 are labeled in red. Those genes that were decreased
  atleast 1.5-fold from control values and had a significance value of p ⩽ 0.05 are
  labeled in green. Those genes that did not meet the aforementioned criteria are
  labeled in gray, and those genes that were not on the array are labeled in white.
  (B) RT-PCR analysis of mRNA for genes that are activators of TGF-β after 24, 48,
  or 72 h of exposure. Data are presented as fold changes over control values (n =
  5 mice/group, means ± SEM) and are normalized to ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) expression.
  * Denotes significant difference from nonexposed control group, p < 0.05. ITGAV
  = integrin αV; THBS1 = thrombospondin 1. (C) RT-PCR analysis of mRNA for genes that
  are activated by TGF-β after 24, 48, or 72 h of exposure. Data are presented as
  fold changes over control values (n = 5 mice/group, means ± SEM) and are normalized
  to Rps2 expression. * Denotes significant difference from nonexposed control group,
  p < 0.05. SPP1 = secreted phosphoprotein 1; TIMP1 = tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
  1; TNC = tenascin C.
