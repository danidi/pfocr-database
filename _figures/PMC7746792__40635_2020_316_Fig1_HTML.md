caption: 'ATP-producing metabolic pathways in distinct immune cell subsets. Glucose
  oxidation to pyruvate via glycolysis is a fast reaction generating 2 mol of ATP

  further metabolic precursor molecules and is involved in ROS production. Pyruvate
  can be converted to lactate or can be further oxidized to acetyl-CoA entering the
  mitochondrial TCA cycle (yellow box). The TCA cycle (red box) generates reducing
  equivalents NADH and FADH2 which are utilized in the mitochondrial respiratory chain
  to build up the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane by complexes
  I–IV of the respiratory chain. As a by-product, ROS and RNS are produced. Oxidative
  phosphorylation produces larger amounts of ATP (36–38 mol/mol glucose) by complex
  V. Immune cells are also able to utilize substrates such as glutamine, which enters
