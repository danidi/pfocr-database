caption: HSP27 mediated suppression of apoptosis promotes tumorigenesis. (A) Schematic
  representation of conformational structural switching between different states.
  HSP27 exists as large oligomers when unphosphorylated and performs their chaperonage
  activities. Upon phosphorylation at specific serine residues by activated mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, HSP27 switches to smaller oligomers losing their
  chaperonage activities, but gaining their pro-oncogenic functions. Green arrow represents
  activation via phosphorylation and red arrow represents deactivation via dephosphorylation.
  (B) HSP27 has important functions in regulating protein folding, actin cytoskeleton,
  decreasing oxidative stress and suppression of apoptosis and other forms of cell
  death. Hyperactivation of HSP27 can induce blockage at multiple steps of apoptosis
  as shown in the figure. Upregulation of HSP27 is a critical survival mechanism for
  the stressed cell and is co-opted by the malignant cell to adapt to and survive
  cellular stress. Phosphorylation status determines the importance of some of HSP27’s
  interactions, however, for simplicity, it is not addressed in this figure. Green
  arrows indicate the activation steps involved in apoptosis. Red arrows originating
  from HSP27 represent induction of different processes.
