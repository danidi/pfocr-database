caption: Model for the regulation of transporter endocytosis by intracellular signaling
  through arrestin-related protein activation. When yeast cells are grown in lactate
  medium, Snf1, the yeast AMPK homologue, is active and phosphorylates Rod1 to inactivate
  it (red arrows). Glucose addition triggers Jen1 endocytosis, which depends on Rod1
  activation through its PP1-mediated dephosphorylation and subsequent Rsp5-mediated
  ubiquitylation, which are coordinated by 14-3-3 proteins (green arrows). The subcellular
  compartment at which Rod1 acts on Jen1 endocytosis may be the plasma membrane, or
  internal compartments (dashed lines). See the Discussion for details. Noteworthy,
  the Snf1/PP1 pathway also controls the transcriptional reprogramming of cells in
  response to glucose fluctuation, including the expression of the JEN1 gene (), illustrating
  a robust physiological regulation in which transcriptional and post-translational
  events are coordinated.
