caption: Autophagy within antigen donor cells and cross-priming. (A) The process of
  autophagy within stressed or dying cells has been demonstrated to enhance recruitment
  of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and phagocytosis. For example, in response to
  chemotherapy, autophagy within cancer cells favors the release of ATP and enhances
  the recruitment of cDC and T cells into the tumor micro-environment (Michaud et
  al., ). In addition, the release of ATP triggers the exposure of “eat-me” signal
  (e.g., PS) and the release of “come-get-me” signal (e.g., LPC), an essential feature
  of efficient capture of dying cells by APC (Qu et al., ; Mellen et al., ). Autophagy
  can also be involved in the release of other “immunogenic proteins” known to support
  the cross-priming (e.g., HMGB1). The mechanism by which autophagy regulates the
  release of HMGB1 remain to be determined. (B) Free autophagosome containing antigen
  – passively released following cell death or actively secreted – may be recognized
  directly by APC, inducing a signal transduction pathway that leads to increased
  cross-presentation. One example includes DRibbles-derived antigen cross-priming
  that is partially dependent of CLEC9A (Li et al., ). These data suggest that autophagosome
  express the ligand of CLEC9A, which is recognized by APC to enhance cross-priming.
  (C) Blocking autophagic flux in antigen donor cells – using pharmacological inhibitor
  or during influenza A infection – favors antigen cross-priming (Uhl et al., ). In
  this context, it is possible that inhibition of lysosomal fusion serves to protect
  epitope within the autophagosome of dying cells and facilitates delivery of intact
  or partially processed antigen to APC. In addition, the capture of intact autophagosome
  could enhance cytokine production (e.g., type I interferon) and cDC activation.
