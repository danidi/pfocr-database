caption: RLR signaling pathway. During viral infection, PAMPs in the cytoplasm are
  recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 leading to their activation. RIG-I and MDA5 interact
  with IPS-1 adaptor protein located on the mitochondria via its CARD domain. This
  interaction results in downstream activation of TRAF3, followed by the K63 polyubiquitination
  (Ub) of TBK1 and IKKi/IKKε, which phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7, leading to the production
  of type I IFNs. IPS-1 also activates NF-κB via FADD and RIP1 dependent pathways.
  FADD and RIP1 form a complex followed by the recruitment of IKKα and IKKβ. This
  transcription factor complex mediates the translocation of NF-κB (p65/p50) into
  the nucleus, which initiates the production of inflammatory cytokine. ‘P’ indicates
  phosphorylation.
