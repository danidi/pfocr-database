caption: The graphic summary of this study. The silence of miR-10b-5p up-regulates
  the expression of PTEN and blocks the secretion of TGFβ1 in GC cells. Exosomal miR-10b-5p
  increased the proliferation of GC cells. The overexpression of miR-10b-5p down-regulates
  KLF11 expression and elevates TGFβR1 expression in fibroblasts. The up-regulated
  exosomal miR-10b-5p is involved in the interaction of GC cells and fibroblasts in
  tumor microenvironment via participating in the regulation of TGFβ signaling pathway.
