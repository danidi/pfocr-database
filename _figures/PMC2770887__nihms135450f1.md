caption: ER stress-induced signaling pathways that mediate autophagy. During induction
  of autophagy, the ubiquitin-like modification complexes of ATG12 and ATG8 (LC3)
  play critical roles in the dynamic changes in membranes that coalesce to form autophagosomes.
  These two ubiquitin-like proteins are targeted to the membrane through interaction
  with ATG5 and ATG16, or lipidation with phosphatidyle-thanolamine (PE), respectively.
  The ATG5—ATG12-ATG16 complex promotes conversion of LC3-I (cytosolic soluble form)
  to LC3-II (membranous lipidated form). In response to ER stress, PERK-mediated phosphorylation
  of eIF2α induces transcription of ATG12.5 In addition, ER stress-induced activation
  of the IRE1-JNK pathway is required for recruitment of LC3-II to the autophagosome.
  Our results show that PKCθ activation is also critical for ER stress-induced autophagy.
  ER stress induces Ca2+ release from the ER that is required to increase PKCθ phosphorylation.
  The phosphorylated form of PKCθ is targeted to LC3-II-containing punctate membranes
  in the cytosol.  As PKCθ is a member of the novel PKC family, it is unlikely that
  Ca2+ directly activates PKCθ. It is also proposed that Ca2+ release from the ER
  stimulates a CaMKK/AMPK-dependent pathway that inhibits mTORC1 to induce autophagy.
