caption: The pathway was proposed based on the genes that were up-regulated in conidia.
  The locus ID and the predicted functions of these genes are listed (bold). The fatty
  acid molecules are degraded via beta-oxidation to produce acetyl-coA units. Two
  molecules of acetyl-coA are used in the glyoxylate cycle. The malate and oxaloacetate
  produced in the glyoxylate cycle can participate in gluconeogenesis and the succinate
  can be used to replenish the citric acid cycle. Alternatively, the acetyl-coA can
  be transported to mitochondria as acetyl-carnitine and enter the citric acid cycle.
  The fumarate produced in the citric acid cycle can then be used for gluconeogenesis.
  *Propionyl-coA is a secondary product of beta-oxidation of fatty acids with even
  numbers of carbon.
