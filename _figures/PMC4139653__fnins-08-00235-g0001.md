caption: Activation or inhibition of a cell by Fc receptor ligation of IgG immune
  complexes. (A) Cross linking of activating FcγRs by IgG immune complexes results
  in the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic ITAM motifs. This allows the recruitment of
  SH2 domain containing kinases of the SYK family. These kinases activate pathways
  such as the RAS and PI3K pathways resulting in increased cellular calcium and activation
  of the cell. (B) The cross linking of an inhibitory receptor to an activating receptor
  results in the phosphorylation of an ITIM, leading to the recruitment of the phosphatase
  SHIP1. SHIP1 removes the 5'phopshate from PiP345 inhibiting downstream PI3K signaling,
  and also interacts with other adaptor proteins to inhibit other pathways. (C) Aβ
  binds with high affinity to the inhibitory FcγRIIb (KD = 5.67 × 10−8 M). Through
  an unknown signaling pathway, the ligation of Aβ causes the loss of FcγRIIb expressing
  neurons. (D) FcγRI possesses an extra immunoglobulin like domain compared to other
  FcγRs. This allows the high affinity binding of monomeric IgG, ligation of monomeric
  IgG by FcγRI expressing neurons, facilitating antibody uptake.
