caption: Overview of Ethylene Biosynthesis and Signaling Pathways in Arabidopsis and
  Environmental Factors That Modulate Ethylene Signaling. Ethylene is synthesized
  from the amino acid methionine by a three-step pathway (). Synthesis of the intermediate
  product 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by ACS enzymes is rate-limiting
  and controlled by numerous environmental conditions including biotic, osmotic, and
  drought stress. Ethylene biosynthesis is also diurnally regulated by the red:far-red
  light ratio. Light-activated PHYB (PHYBFR) binds to and degrades PIF4/5, which can
  no longer induce ACS transcription. Shading by neighboring plants also influences
  the PHYB–PIF4/5 pathway. The direct ethylene precursor ACC can be transported through
  the xylem via the LHT1 transporter or can be conjugated into malonyl-ACC (Ma-ACC)
  or jasmonyl-ACC (JA-ACC), which are also transported through the xylem. In the destination
  organ, ethylene targets ethylene receptors, and thus relieves CTR1 inhibition of
  EIN2. EIN2 activation triggers the stabilization of EIN3 and EIL1, primary transcription
  factors that further control the expression of the downstream ERFs ().
