caption: Schematic representation of β3AR signaling activation in cardiomyocytes.
  β3ARs are coupled to both stimulatory G proteins (Gs) and inhibitory G proteins
  (Gi). Although the Gs pathway induces the generation of cAMP and cGMP which, in
  turn, activates the PKA and PKG, respectively, the activation of Gi signaling pathway
  is able to stimulate only the generation of cGMP and the activation of PKG. PKA
  has multiple roles in cardiomyocytes and is able to induce the phosphorylation of
  several key factors involved in the regulation of contractility, such as cardiac
  troponin I (cTnI) and phospholamban (PLN). The latter affects Ca2+ cycling to the
  contractile proteins. Furthermore, PKA can phosphorylate the L-type Ca2+ channel
  (LTCC) increasing the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Importantly, PKA can also activate
  protein kinase B (Akt) with the subsequent activation of the endothelial NO synthase
  (eNOS). Of note, eNOS activation increases the generation of NO which, in turn,
  activates the soluble guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP and PKG activation. Similar
  to PKA, PKG is able to phosphorylate PLN and cTnI. However, PKG can induce the inactivation
  of LTCC, thus reducing the extracellular Ca2+ influx. Moreover, cGMP can stimulate
  phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2), reducing the cAMP levels and the activation of PKA.
  Of note, after the Gi signaling pathway activation, the β3AR is able to give rise
  to NO through both eNOS and neuronal NOS (nNOS) located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  (SR).
