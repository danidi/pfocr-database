caption: Figure 3. Scheme of the salt stress response pathway that includes salt homeostasis
  control. The question marks in red point at the stages in salt stress signaling
  that are poorly understood, including the perception of the salt stress signal (question
  (Q)1), the mechanism that links MT disassembly with the intracellular increase in
  [Ca2+] (Q2), and the function of MT reassembly in salt stress tolerance (Q3).
