caption: Outline of the Taxol biosynthetic pathway illustrating the cyclization of
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate to taxadiene, the hydroxylation to taxadien-5α-ol, acetylation
  to the ester, and subsequent 10β-hydroxylation and 13α-hydroxylation of the appropriate
  intermediates. The large X indicates that the illustrated reaction did not occur
  with the noted enzyme. The broken arrows signify undefined steps.
