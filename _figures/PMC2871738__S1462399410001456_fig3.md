caption: 'Role of the major PD-associated genes in mitochondrial dysfunction. Many               genes
  associated with Parkinson disease (PD) implicate a role for mitochondria in the               pathogenesis
  of the disease. The serine protease HTRA2–OMI is synthesised as               an
  inactive precursor containing a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (MTS). In response               to
  the activation of the MEKK3–p38 stress-kinase-signalling pathway,               HTRA2/OMI
  is phosphorylated by p38 in a PINK1-dependent manner and imported into the               intermembrane
  space (IMS), where it has been reported to bind to the               Bcl-2-family-related
  protein Hax-1 (Ref. ). Despite the fact that this interaction is controversial (Ref.
  ), it has been suggested to promote the               proteolytic processing of
  HTRA2/OMI by the mitochondrial protease PARL. Active               HTRA2/OMI is
  thought to be involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins present               in
  the IMS (Ref. ) and to prevent the               oligomerisation of the activated
  form of BAX on the outer membrane (OM), thus avoiding               apoptosis (Ref.
  ). Under oxidative stress               conditions, PINK1 also interacts with the
  mitochondrial molecular chaperone TRAP1.               Once phosphorylated, TRAP1
  inhibits oxidative-stress-induced cytochrome c (Cyt C)               release, prevents
  misfolding and promotes the correct assembly of mitochondrial               proteins.
  DJ-1 is a cytosolic oxidative-stress-regulated chaperone, which               redistributes
  from the cytosol to the mitochondria upon oxidation of specific cysteine               residues.
  In the cytoplasm, DJ-1 prevents the aggregation and toxicity of               α-synuclein
  (α-syn); in mitochondria, it has been suggested to               protect respiratory
  complex I (cI) from oxidative-stress-mediated inactivation (Ref.                 ).
  Another protein involved in the               mitochondrial stress response is Parkin,
  a cytosolic E3-ubiquitin ligase, which is               selectively recruited to
  uncoupled or dysfunctional mitochondria, targeting them for               autophagy
  (Ref. ). A model is illustrated               whereby PINK1, acting upstream of
  Parkin, might regulate mitochondrial function by               sensing mitochondrial
  damage, recruiting Parkin and inducing mitophagy. Abbreviations:               ADP,
