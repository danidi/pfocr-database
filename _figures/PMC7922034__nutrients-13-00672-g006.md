caption: Antioxidant protection and metabolic actions of polyphenol supplementation.
  Polyphenols (PLPs) may protect against oxidative stress (OxS) through either direct
  or indirect antioxidant mechanisms. In the former, PLPs can scavenge and neutralize
  ROS before the occurrence of oxidative damages to lipids, proteins and DNA. Moreover,
  PLPs have also the capacity to promote protection by regenerating additional exogenous
  antioxidants such as tocopherol and ascorbic acid. Solubilization and transport
  of PLPs by lipoproteins such as chylomicron or high-density lipoprotein/low-density
  lipoprotein particles may specifically prevent OxS derived from dyslipidemia (DLP)
  and cardiometabolic complications, notably atherosclerosis. Indirectly, PLPs stimulate
  endogenous antioxidants, including the regulatory KEAP-ARE-NRF2 pathway, in order
  to enhance the synthesis of phase 2 cytoprotective enzymes (e.g., γ-glutamylcysteine
  synthetase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase,
  NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, catalase and
  superoxide dismutase). Furthermore, PLPs can stimulate the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway
  for prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
  ARE, Antioxidant response element, KEAP, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein; NR-F2,
  nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2; PGC1-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT1, sirtuin
