caption: 'Hypothetical model of lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation (LIP)
  in response to T cell depletion. Rabbit polyclonal anti-thymocyte globin ATG (rATG)
  and alemtuzumab are the two biologics most frequently used in T cell depleting protocols
  to reduce the frequency of alloreactive T cells from the T cell repertoire of patients
  immediately after transplantation. This clinical intervention aims at preventing
  early episodes of acute graft rejection and permits post-transplant tapering of
  immunosuppression. Whole-body irradiation of the recipient is also applied in allogeneic
  bone marrow transplantation to allow the engraftment of donor stem cells that also
  depletes the peripheral compartment of T cells. In the depicted hypothetical model,
  repopulation of the peripheral T cell repertoire occurs via thymus output of recent
  thymic emigrants and peripheral expansion of predominantly residual effector/memory
  T cells along with a very small population of naïve T cells resistant to T cell
  depletion or irradiation. Two waves of T cell repopulation occur in response to
  lymphopenia to restore a depleted lymphoid peripheral compartment rich in growth
  factors and space to repopulate. First, the few remaining residual naïve T cells
  and more abundant residual effector/memory T cells quickly proliferate (fast spontaneous
  proliferation). After this initial repopulation wave, a second wave of slow T cell
  proliferation starts. In the presence of an intact thymus, recent thymic emigrants
  actively exit the thymus and enter the peripheral compartment, in which they are
  converted into effector/memory T cells while replicating. This wave of thymic output
  also contains thymic Tregs (tTregs) that, along with pTregs converted from naïve
  T cells under the influence of TGF-β, configure the Tregs peripheral pool. Thymic
  emigration is paramount to regulate the rate of recovery of the peripheral T cell
  pool through a process termed lymphopenia-induced slow proliferation. During this
  phase of in vivo T cell reconstitution, expansion of Tregs can be favored by the
  administration of IL-2/anti-IL-2 immune complexes that, combined with agonist signaling
  through TNFR, provides an advantage to Tregs over alloreactive T cells and tips
  the balance towards regulation instead of aggressive response. Through this approach
  of selective expansion of Tregs during T cell repopulation, a more effective modulation
  of effector alloreactive T cell responses can be achieved in conditioning regimens
  that require mild T cell depletion in the peri-transplant period. The predominant
  pathway in the presence of thymic activity is slow proliferation that restores a
  complete T cell repertoire with sufficient TCR diversity and protects from autoimmunity.
  Red zigzag arrow: irradiation and blued dotted arrow at the balance indicates the
  increase in weight of Tregs expansion.'
