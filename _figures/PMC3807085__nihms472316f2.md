caption: Rho protein cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state.
  Inhibition of the mevalonate synthesis by statins prevents memrbane targeting of
  Rho and its subsequent activation of ROCK. The inhibition of the Rho/ROCK pathway
  may mediate some of the pleiotropic effects of statins on the vascular wall.
