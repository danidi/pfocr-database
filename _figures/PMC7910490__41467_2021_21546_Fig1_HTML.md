caption: Common steps between potato and tomato are shaded green. Steps specific to
  tomato or potato are indicated by red or yellow shade, respectively. White and dashed
  black arrows represent characterized and uncharacterized reactions, respectively.
  The reaction step characterized in this work, by DPS (Dioxygenase for Potato Solanidane
  synthesis), is shown in red arrow. PGA POTATO GLYCOALKALOID BIOSYNTHESIS, GAME GLYCOALKALOID
