caption: 'Blocking the myostatin pathway. Myostatin (M) activation requires stepwise
  proteolytic cleavages of the precursor protein. After the signal peptide (SP) is
  removed, a second cleavage event leaves two fragments: an N-terminal propeptide
  domain of ≈28 kD and C-terminal domain of 12.5 kD destined to become the active
  myostatin protein. Parallel fragments of the myostatin C-terminal are linked through
  a disulfide bond, referred to as the myostatin C-terminal dimer that remains noncovalently
  complexed to the N-terminal propeptide. This noncovalent complex circulates in the
  blood maintaining the myostatin C-terminal dimer in a latent, inactive state. A
  third cleavage at amino acid 76 affects the ability of the propeptide to bind the
  active C terminal domain. Myostatin can be found in the serum or locally in an inactive
  state when bound to follistatin (FS), follistatin-related gene (FLRG), and growth
  and differentiation factor-associated serum protein-1 (GASP-1). These peptides block
  the activation of the myostatin pathway. If the pathway is not inhibited, the active
  myostatin dimer binds to the activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB), which then recruits
  and activates by transphosphorylation the type I receptor (ALK4 or ALK5). Smad2
  and Smad3 are subsequently activated and form aggregates with Smad4 and then are
  translocated to the nucleus, activating target gene transcription.'
