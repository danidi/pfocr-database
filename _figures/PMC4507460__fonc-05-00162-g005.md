caption: CCK and therapeutic opportunities in Ewing sarcoma. CCK is an EWS/FLI1 target
  gene and its expression is elevated in Ewing sarcoma cells. Functionally, inhibition
  of CCK expression impairs growth and migration in Ewing sarcoma cells. It still
  remains to be addressed if CCK is a direct EWS/FLI1 target or not (1) and which
  is the exact signaling pathway that takes place once CCK binds to its receptors
  in the cells (2). Also it is still unknown whether CCK binds exclusively to its
  canonical CCKRs or if there are other receptors (3) or even if it can enter directly
  into the cell through some yet unknown mechanism (4). Therapeutically, it may be
  interesting to further test receptor antagonists other than devazepide (D) that
  could interfere with CCK binding to its receptors in Ewing sarcoma cells (5). Also,
  from a diagnosis point of view, it could be useful to test radiolabeled CCK derivatives
  (CCKd) to be used in imaging technologies (6). All in all, more studies are needed
  to define the principal components and pathways that are involved in the CCK-autocrine
  loop.
