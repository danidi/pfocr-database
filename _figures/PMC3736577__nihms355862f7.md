caption: A. Pro-survival TNF-α signaling. Secreted TNF-α molecules bind to the death
  receptor TNFR1. Associated with the cytoplasmic portion of TNFR1 are several adaptor
  molecules including TRADD, TRAF2 and the serine/threonine kinase RIP1. Upon TNF-α
  stimulation, RIP1 is poly-ubiquitinated (orange circles) by cIAP2, which enables
  RIP1 to interact with and activate the kinases IKK and TAK1. These kinases then
  phosphorylate the inhibitory protein IκBα, which targets it for ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation. In the absence of IκBα, the newly released NF-κB molecule, p65/p50,
  is free to move into the nucleus and induce the expression of genes that mediate
  pro-survival. In particular, NF-κB upregulates the expression of cIAP2, which poly-ubiquitinates
  RIP1 during pathophysiological conditions to ensure that TNF-α signaling promotes
  a pro-survival pathway. B. Pro-apoptotic TNF-α signaling. TNF-α binds to TNFR1,
  which interacts with TRADD, TRAF2 and RIP1. Immediately before and after TNF-α binding,
  RIP1 remains poly-ubiquitinated, and perhaps competent to activate IKK and/or TAK1,
  since IκBα still undergoes proteolytic degradation. However, in the absence of p65
  and a transcriptionally active NF-κB complex, cIAP2 fails to be expressed. As a
  consequence of this, the levels of poly-ubiquitinated RIP1 rapidly diminish (light
  orange circles) and pro-caspase 8 interacts with and becomes activated by hypo-ubiquitinated
  RIP1. Once activated, caspase 8 activates additional caspases, which execute the
  ensuing phases of apoptosis.
