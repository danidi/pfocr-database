caption: Topography and signaling pathways triggered by selectin ligands in neutrophils.
  (A) Topography of selectin ligands on neutrophils. Based on biochemical and electron
  microscopic evidence, PSGL-1 is thought to be concentrated in lipid rafts on the
  tips of microvilli. Electron microscopy places (some of) ESL-1 on microvilli, but
  not necessarily the tips, whereas CD44 is concentrated in the valleys between microvilli.
  LFA-1 and Mac-1 are thought to be mostly on the cell body. (B) Signaling pathways
  of selectin ligands in neutrophils. Engagement of PSGL-1 by P-selectin or E-selectin
  or engagement of CD44 by E-selectin induces activation of the SFKs Fgr, Hck, and
  Lyn., The activated SFKs phosphorylate the ITAM domains of DAP-12 and FcRγ, enabling
  them to recruit spleen tyrosine kinase Syk. Knocking out Fgr or knocking out both
  Hck and Lyn blocks this signaling pathway., Direct physical association between
  PSGL-1, CD44, and the SFKs has not been demonstrated. Syk activity is needed to
  activate Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk), which leads to phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2)
  activation, providing diacylglycerol (DAG) for the activation of CalDAG-GEFI, an
  exchange factor for the small G protein Rap-1. Rap-1 drives LFA-1 extension through
  other signaling intermediates (not shown). Engagement of ESL-1 by E-selectin has
  been shown to activate Mac-1, but the signaling pathway is unknown.
