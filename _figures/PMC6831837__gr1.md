caption: Mechanism of MicroRNA Processing and Their Inhibitory MechanismThe microRNA
  (miRNA) processing pathway begins with transcription of their genes with the help
  of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) or polymerase III (Pol III) to produce pri-miRNAs
  in the nucleus. Then a microprocessor complex, composed of RNA-binding protein DGCR8
  and type III RNase Drosha, cleaves pri-miRNA into a ∼85-nt stem-loop structure called
  pre-miRNA. The exportin 5-RAN/GTP complex mediates the transport of pre-miRNA from
  the nucleus into the cytoplasm. The RNase DICER in complex with double-stranded
  RNA-binding protein TRBP cleaves the pre-miRNA hairpin to a ∼20- to 22-nt miRNA/miRNA
  duplex. After the duplex is unwound, the functional strand of the mature miRNA (the
  guide strand) is loaded into the miRISC-containing DICER1, TRBP, and Argonaute (AGO)
  proteins. This miRISC silences/inhibits the target mRNAs expression/function through
  mRNA cleavage, translational repression, or deadenylation. The passenger strand
  of the miRNA is degraded. AGO, Argonaute proteins; DGCR8, DiGeorge syndrome critical
  region gene 8; m7G cap, 7-methylguanosine; miRISC, miRNA-induced silencing complex;
  miRNA, microRNA; pre-miRNA, miRNA precursor; pri-miRNA, primary miRNA; RAN-GTP,
  Ras-related nuclear protein coupled with guanosine-5′-triphosphate; TRBP, transactivating
  response RNA-binding protein.
