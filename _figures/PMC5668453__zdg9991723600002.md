caption: Pathways of iron and oxygen homeostasis. Iron-response proteins (IRPs) orchestrate
  cellular responses to intracellular iron levels. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
  pathway orchestrates cellular responses to oxygen levels. Hypoxia inhibits the degradation
  of IRP2 and upregulates the expression of the HIF-target genes, transferrin receptor
  1(TfR1) and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which encode proteins of iron uptake.
  Reduced intracellular iron induces the HIF pathway by inhibiting the HIF prolyl
  hydroxylase enzymes (PHDs). In addition, HIF2α is subject to translational repression
  by IRP1 in response to iron deficiency. HIF2α controls the transcription of erythropoietin
  (EPO) in response to hypoxia. In turn, EPO induces erythroferrone (ERFE) production
  in the bone marrow, which inhibits hepcidin expression in the liver. Hepcidin targets
  the iron-export protein ferroportin (FPN) in the gut. As well as being regulated
  by IRPs and hepcidin, FPN in gut enterocytes is upregulated HIF2α in response to
  hypoxia. Responses shown in the gray box are ubiquitous to all cell types. Responses
  shown in yellow boxes are organ specific and relate to systemic iron homeostasis.
