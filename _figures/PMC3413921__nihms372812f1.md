caption: The schematic depicts regulatory some of connections within the Hippo pathway,
  and between Hippo signaling and other pathways discussed in the text. The Drosophila
  names of pathway components are used, and the schematic is over-simplified in that
  many Hippo signaling pathway components are not shown. Interactions with other pathways
  depicted include 1) Within the nucleus, Yki/Yap/Taz promotes the expression of ligands
  for other signaling pathways. 2) Yki/Yap/Taz interacts with Smad proteins (Mad)
  and β-catenin, which are transcription factors of TGF-β and Wnt pathways. When Yki/Yap/Taz
  is cytoplasmic this interaction inhibits transcriptional activation by these pathways,
  but when its nuclear they cooperate to promote transcription of downstream genes.
  3) Fj and Ds expression are regulated by the Notch, Dpp, and Wg signlaing pathways
  in the Drosophila wing, at least some of this regulation is mediated through Vg
  (not shown). 4) Wounding, apoptosis, or infection (“stress”) can activate the Jnk
  pathway, which can lead to Yki activation.
