caption: Hypothetical pathway involved in general cerebellum-mediated motor learning.
  Model is based on classical delay eye-blink conditioning (adapted from  in ), and
  so it may not precisely apply to fear conditioning and/or gross motor (rotarod)
  learning. The tone (conditioned stimulus, or CS) and shock (unconditioned stimulus,
  or US) signals are conveyed to and converge on the Purkinje cell via the mossy fiber
  (green arrows) and climbing fiber (red arrows) pathways, respectively. Signal integration
  occurs within the Purkinje cell, and conjunctive arrival of the two signals can
  result in depression of the GC-PC synapse (LTD). Conditioned response (CR) memory
  is stored in the deep cerebellar nuclei, possibly at the mossy fiber synapse. The
  Purkinje cell controls the rate of acquisition and asymptote of the CR. As shown
  in the inset to the right of the PJ cell, increased PJ cell activation (or increased
  [L7]) results in decreased nuclear cell activation and slower association of the
  CS and US. In contrast, LTD (or decreased [L7]) would result in faster association.
  The model could be altered to account for the possibility that LTP and not LTD at
  the GC-PC synapse may be the memory correlate in the case of fear conditioning ().
  In this case increased [L7] could be facilitatory, even though our data show that
  L7 gene inactivation causes no detectable effect on fear memory. Nevertheless our
  data suggest that acquisition, or tone-shock association, is facilitated by L7 gene
  inactivation, possibly due to PC depression.
