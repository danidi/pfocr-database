caption: NO regulates VfHaHK and SiliHaHK autophosphorylation activity and may ultimately
  influence their symbiotic relationships with their respective eukaryotic hosts.
  (A) In V. fischeri, Fe(II)-NO bound H-NOX may inhibit VfHaHK autophosphorylation
  activity which not only leads to a change in phosphate flow in the predicted signaling
  network but also influences its symbiosis with Euprymna scolopes, the Hawaiian bobtail
  squid. (B) In Silicibacter sp. TrichCH4B, SiliHaHK autophosphorylation activity
  and phosphate flow within the pathway remain unchanged in the absence and presence
  of Fe(II) and Fe(II)-CO bound SiliH-NOX. NO bound SiliH-NOX has been shown to decrease
  SiliHaHK autophosphorylation activity while increasing SiliHaHK phosphatase activity.
  This causes a decrease in phosphate flow within the SiliHaHK signaling pathway leading
  to increased biofilm formation, and influences Silicibacter sp. TrichCH4B symbiosis
  with Trichodesmium erythraeum, an algal symbiont.
