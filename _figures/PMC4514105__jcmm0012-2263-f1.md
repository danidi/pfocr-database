caption: Mechanisms of cell death. See text for details. (A) Necrosis is characterized
  by loss of ATR which leads to cell lysis and release of cellular contents into the
  extracellular environment. (B) Apoptosis induction involves different pathways leading
  to caspase activation. In the extrinsic pathway ligand binding to death receptors
  {e.g. Fas) induces their trimerization and recruitment of caspase-8 through death
  domain-containing adaptor proteins (e.g. FADD). This leads to auto-activation of
  caspase-8, which can directly activate effector caspases. Alternatively in some
  cells Bid cleavage by caspase-8 is required for death. Truncated Bid translocates
  to the mitochondria and activates the intrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is
  activated by toxins or conditions that cause stress to the mitochondria or endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). Such stresses often alter the levels of, or cause post-translational
  modification of, Bcl-2 family proteins, initiating the release of cytochrome c from
  the mitochondria. For example, ER stress up-regulates the unfolded protein response
  (UPR), which increases expression of BimEL, a BH3-only protein that antagonizes
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, permitting Bax-mediated cytochrome c release. Once in the cytosol,
  cytochrome c stimulates formation of the apoptosome complex, leading to caspase-9
  activation. Initiator caspases (e.g. caspase-8 and -9) are shown in yellow, downstream
  effector caspases (e.g. caspase-3) are shown in red. (C) Excitotoxicity is caused
  by the influx of Ca2+ through the NMDA receptor. This can result in apoptosis, necrosis,
  or cell death that exhibits apoptotic nuclear morphology without caspase activation,
  suggesting a continuum of death patterns. (D) Autophagic cell death may be due to
  excessive autophagic digestion, as a result of dysregulation of the pathway by unknown
  mechanisms.
