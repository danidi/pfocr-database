caption: Biosynthetic pathways leading to kauralexin and zealexin compounds in maize.
  Enzymes indicated in bold and reactions represented by solid arrows have been established
  empirically, while dashed arrows indicate gaps in our knowledge. Enzymes and reactions
  in greyscale have been predicted in silico. Pathway adapted from Plant Metabolic
  Network (PMN), on www.plantcyc.org, August 2015. The general pathway structure is
  proposed based on the order of enzymatic conversions observed in other terpenoid
  biosynthetic pathways, such as in rice []
