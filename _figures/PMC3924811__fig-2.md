caption: Mechanosensors FAK and integrins. (A) Schematic representation of heterodimers
  of alpha and beta subunits of integrin connecting the ECM to cytoskeleton via binding
  to fibronectin. After perception of mechanical signals, integrins attach to actin,
  recruiting paxillin, talin, and vinculin in the focal adhesions and transmit the
  force to the cytoskeleton. This requires FAK phosphorylation and PYK2 and Src activation.
  The integrins and focal adhesion complexes lead to activation of RAS/Raf and MAPKs,
  resulting in ERK1/2 and p38 activation with subsequent transcription of Jun/fos
  and bone associated transcription factors. Integrin activation also induces NF-κB
  activation, leading to COX2 production required for osteoblast proliferation. (B)
  Mechanosome pathway of integrin-mediated mechanotransduction showing that shear
  stress triggers activation of NOS, sGC and PKGII complex via NO production and cGMP-mediated
  activation of PKGII, respectively. This leads to phosphorylation of SHP-1 and subsequent
  activation of Src, which is required for the activation of the MEK pathway activating
  ERK1/2. ERK is known to activate osteoblast proliferation and differentiation via
  transcription of fos and other osteogenic genes. The wide (yellow in online version)
  arrows indicate the known steps affected by mechanosignaling in the integrin and
  FAK signaling cascades. cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; COX2, cyclooxygenase
  2; ECM, extracellular matrix; ERK1/2, extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2;
  FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinases; MEK, mitogen
  activated protein kinase kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; NO, nitric oxide;
  NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PKGII, protein kinase GII; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase;
