caption: In hypertension, small resistance arteries are exposed to stimuli, such as,
  an increased level of sympathetic stimulation, an increased exposure to angiotensin-II
  and other components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and/or an augmented
  level of intraluminal pressure. These stimuli induce vasoconstriction though processes
  that involve the synthesis and activation of MMPs, the production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), and a ROS-dependent activation of MMPs. Prolonged vasoconstriction
  in turn induces inward eutrophic remodeling via mechanisms that involve the activation
  of tissue-type transglutaminase (TG2) and the repositioning of smooth muscle cells.
  It remains to be determined whether a prolonged activation of MMPs and ROS is associated
  with the activation of TG2 and whether it participates in allowing smooth muscle
  cells to move within the vascular wall to increase their overlap and each occupy
  a greater proportion of the wall circumference.
