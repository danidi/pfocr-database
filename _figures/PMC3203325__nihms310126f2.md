caption: Schematic overview of the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway. Damaged
  DNA is recognized by either initial factors of the Global Genome Repair (a.o. Xpc)
  or Transcription Coupled Repair (CSA and CSB), which constitute the two different
  repair pathways in NER. After DNA damage recognition the repair route progresses
  along the same way. After helix unwinding and verification of the damage incisions
  are made to remove the faulty stretch of DNA. Finally, DNA synthesis and subsequent
  ligation reproduce the correct DNA sequence.
