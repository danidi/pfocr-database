caption: Metabolic pathways that support T cells. ATP is the molecular currency of
  energy in the cell. It can be derived from glucose through two integrated pathways.
  The first of these, glycolysis (green), involves the enzymatic breakdown of glucose
  to pyruvate in the cytoplasm. The TCA cycle (orange) encompasses the second pathway,
  where pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria and shuttled through
  several enzymatic reactions to generate reducing equivalents to fuel OXPHOS (brown).
  Other substrates can also be metabolized in the TCA cycle, such as glutamine via
  glutaminolysis (purple) or fatty acids via β-oxidation (FAO; gray). These connected
  biochemical pathways can also provide metabolic precursors for biosynthesis. Intermediates
  from glucose catabolism during glycolysis can shuttle through the pentose phosphate
  (dark blue) and serine biosynthesis pathways (red) to fuel nucleotide and amino
  acid production. Oxaloacetate from the TCA cycle can similarly be used to generate
  aspartate for use in nucleotide synthesis. Precursors for amino acid and nucleotide
  biosynthesis can be obtained from glutamine. Citrate from the TCA cycle can be exported
  from the mitochondria and converted to acetyl-CoA for FAS (light blue). ROS generated
  from the ETC during OXPHOS can also act as secondary signaling molecules.
