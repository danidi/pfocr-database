caption: A signaling model for hypoxic activation of HIF-1. Based on our current findings
  we propose that hypoxia stimulates oxidant production within mitochondria. These
  oxidants interact with an unknown protein “X” in the cytosol to activate MKK3/6
  and p38α MAPK. The activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway results in the decrease
  in hydroxylation of the HIF-1α protein at proline and asparagine residues resulting
  in the activation of HIF-1. By contrast, anoxia or iron chelators (DFO) during normoxia
  inhibit hydroxylation directly by limiting the availability of oxygen as a substrate
  and iron as a cofactor, respectively. Thus, anoxia or DFO does not require signaling
  pathways for the activation of HIF-1. Hypoxia and anoxia have distinct signaling
  mechanisms to activation HIF-1.
