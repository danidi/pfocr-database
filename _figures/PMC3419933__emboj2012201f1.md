caption: '(A) DP1 regulates the Wnt pathway both negatively and positively. Under
  conditions of low Wnt signalling, cytoplasmic DP1 prevents Dvl to bind Axin and
  thus keeps the β-catenin degradation complex maximally active. When Wnt signalling
  is high, DP1 shuttles by an yet undefined mechanism into the nucleus, where it sequesters
  the kinase NLK away from TCF, thus preventing TCF phosphorylation and inactivation.
  This ensures efficient DNA binding and transcriptional activity of the β-catenin–TCF
  complex. (B) DP1 dual activity refines patterning of the neuroderm during early
  Xenopus development: a coarse gradient is established by Wnt factors produced in
  the posterior part of the embryo, counteracted in the anterior region by secreted
  Wnt inhibitors. Cytoplasmic DP1 further represses the weak Wnt-β-catenin activity
  in the front of the future nervous system. In the trunk/posterior region, DP1, which
  has accumulated in the nucleus under the influence of high Wnt signalling, boosts
  β-catenin accumulation and β-catenin–TCF transcriptional activity. This results
  in stabilization of the extreme conditions, as well as a steeper effective gradient
  of activity in the median region and thus a sharpening of the pattern.'
