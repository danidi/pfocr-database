caption: A supposed schematic of regulation between IFNγ2 and toll-like receptor (TLR)
  pathway in Epinephelus coioides. TLRs recognized the components of bacterial, then
  triggered the inflammatory response mediated by NF-κB signal, which induced the
  expression of pro-inflammatory factors, including IFNγ2. In E. coioides, subsequently,
  the expression of miR-146a was activated by NF-κB (the data were not shown) and
  IFNγ2. Upregulation of miR-146a reduced the expression of TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6, which is a signal transduction component in the TLR signaling pathway.
  Then the NF-κB signal was regulated. Meanwhile, how does E. coioides IFNγ2 activate
  the transcription of miR-146a and whether IFNγ receptor is involved in this regulation
  still remain unclear in E. coioides.
