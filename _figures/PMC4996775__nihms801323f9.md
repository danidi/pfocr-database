caption: 'Left panel (blue), based on published results (1) The BL domain of polarized
  RPE cells abuts the Bruch’s membrane that separates the RPE cell monolayer from
  fenestrated choroidal capillaries. Iron released from plasma Tf is captured by locally
  synthesized Tf [] and endocytosed by the Tf/TfR pathway through clathrin-coated
  pits. (2) Tf-bound iron is released in acidic sorting endosomes and transported
  to cytosolic ferritin across DMT1. Vesicles containing iron depleted Tf/TfR complex
  are recycled back to the respective plasma membrane domain. This constitutes the
  fast recycling pathway, and α-syn facilitates different steps of vesicular trafficking
  by interacting with clathrin, SNARES, and the Rab family of proteins [, , ]. (3)
  Some vesicles are transported to CREs that are accessible to AP and BL recycling
  vesicles. Iron depleted Tf/TfR complex is recycled to the AP or BL plasma membrane
  domain from this pool by the slow recycling pathway [, , ]. (4) Tf binds ferric
  iron, and the Tf/TfR complex starts another cycle of endocytosis and recycling []).
  Note: The fast and slow recycling pathways are not restricted to a specific plasma
  membrane domain; such a depiction in this figure is only for the sake of clarity.Right
  panel (white), hypothetical model based on our data. Absence or knock-down of α-syn
  or the presence of mutant α-syn-A53T impairs several steps in the trafficking of
  Tf/TfR pathway, resulting in the accumulation of Tf/TfR complex in CREs and/or MVBs.
  This interferes with the release of iron from Tf and recycling of the Tf/TfR complex
  back to the plasma membrane. Consequently, levels of total iron, ferritin, and TfR
  fall significantly, creating a phenotype of iron deficiency.RPE: retinal pigment
