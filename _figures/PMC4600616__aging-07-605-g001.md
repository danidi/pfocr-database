caption: To characterize Hh function in SCLC and to evaluate the therapeutic potential
  of Hh inhibitors in this cancer, we have investigated the possibility of a direct
  interaction between Hh and BN/GRPR signaling pathways. According to our initial
  observations, Cyclopamine, an inhibitor of Smo, attenuated BN induced cell proliferation.
  In support of these data, RNA interference for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), upstream activator
  of Smo, reduced BN stimulated growth, matrigel spreading and soft agar colony formation
  []. Surprisingly, when testing the activation of Gli transcription factor upon BN
  stimulation, we revealed the existence of a direct crosstalk between the two pathways.
  In order to dissect the signaling molecular events mediating this interaction, we
  discovered that BN, through its G protein coupled receptor (GRPR) linked to Gαq/Gα12/13
  large G proteins, and their downstream target, the Rho small GTPase, was able to
  stimulate NFkB-mediated transcription of Shh, thus initiating an autocrine signaling
  loop that links BN/GRPR pathway to production of Shh ligand, and the autocrine Hh
  signaling activation (Figure , left panel) [].
