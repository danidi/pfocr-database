caption: HSF1 was activated through S326 phosphorylation by mTOR. Activated HSF1 then
  led to increased HuR expression, which in turn promoted the translation of CTNNB1
  mRNA into β-catenin. A concerted mTOR> HSF1> HuR> pathway appeared to be upstream
  of β-catenin expression in normal and malignant mammary derived cells.
