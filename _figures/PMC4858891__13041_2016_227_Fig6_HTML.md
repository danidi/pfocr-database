caption: Proposed signaling pathway for histamine-induced resetting of the circadian
  pacemaker in the SCN. ① A subset of SCN neurons are loaded with Cl− by the action
  of the Cl− importer NKCC1. ② H1R stimulation by histamine at early night results
  in the production of activated Gβγ protein in these cells. ③ The activated Gβγ protein
  stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC) to produce cAMP from ATP. ④ PKA activated by cAMP
  opens the Cl− channel CFTR. ⑤ The efflux of Cl− through CFTR down the electrochemical
  gradient results in membrane depolarization. ⑥ In response to this membrane depolarization,
  the CaV1.3 L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) is activated. ⑦ The resulting
  Ca2+ influx through CaV1.3 VGCC induces Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) through RyR. ⑧ The consequent increase in [Ca2+]i leads to phase delay of the
  circadian clock
