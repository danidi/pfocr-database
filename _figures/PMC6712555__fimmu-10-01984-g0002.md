caption: Vascular inflammation during tumor cell extravasation and metastasis. (A)
  Inflammatory macrophages and monocytes induce the expression of ICAM1 and (B) E-selectin
  via APBA3-HIF1 signaling in endothelial cells. This enhances tumor cell attachment.
  (C) Tumor cells mimic the endothelium by upregulating VCAM1, which tethers them
  to β1 integrin-expressing macrophages and enhances metastatic seeding. (D) Similarly,
  tumor cells can upregulate ICAM1, and tethers to β2-integrin expressing neutrophils.
  This interaction is mediated by IL8 produced by tumor cells, which promotes neutrophil
  recruitment. (E) Neutrophil-tumor cell clusters enhance attachment to the endothelium
  via ICAM1 under flow conditions. (F) Some positive effects of vascular inflammation
  include enhanced recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), through upregulation
  of VCAM1 and ICAM1. This pathway can be negatively regulated, for example via FasL
  and ETBR, such that blocking these factors can improve TIL delivery to tumors. (G)
  CCR2+ monocytes are attracted to the metastatic niche in response to CCL2 expressed
  by tumor cells, where they produce VEGFA to increase vascular permeability. CCL2
  can also act directly on the endothelium by dephosphorylating VE-cadherin, disrupting
  junctional integrity, and increasing tumor cell transmigration. (H) Angiopoietin
  2 (Ang2) expression by endothelial cells reduces pericyte coverage and promotes
  the recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes, which promote permeability. (I) Neutrophils
  produce proteolytic and inflammatory factors (e.g., ROS, IL1β, MMP8, MMP9) to disrupt
  endothelial junctions and increase vascular permeability in cancer models.
