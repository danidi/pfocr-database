caption: In vivo reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway. Modified low-density
  lipoproteins (LDLs) are recognized by scavenger receptor A (SRA) and taken up by
  macrophages, which lead to the formation of a foam cell. Apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI)
  or nascent high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) promote the cholesterol efflux from
  foam cells by interacting with ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC1) ABCA1 or
  ABCG1. Free cholesterol in HDLs is esterified into cholesteryl ester (CE) by lecithin
  cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) to produce the mature HDL. Liver scavenger receptor
  class B type I (SR-BI) is responsible for recognition of HDLs and promotes the uptake
  of cholesterol. CE is de-esterified and converted into bile acid, which is secreted
  into the bile. In humans, CE can be transported onto ApoB by cholesterol ester transport
  protein (CETP) and leads to the formation of LDLs or very low-density lipoproteins
  (VLDLs).
