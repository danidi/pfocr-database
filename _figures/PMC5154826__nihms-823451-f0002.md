caption: It is accepted that the major cause of chronic inflammation in the normal,
  acid-secreting stomach is H. pylori colonization. Upon H. pylori infection, Shh
  is induced by NFκB and IFNγ, and acts as a chemokine for the recruitment of macrophages
  to the stomach and the development of gastritis. Cytokines including IL- 1β and
  TNFα, leads to the loss of Shh, possibly as a consequence of parietal cell atrophy.
  Based on the Correa model for the development of gastric cancer [84], it is known
  that inflammation caused by H. pylori infection progresses through the development
  of atrophic gastritis, metaplasia, dysplasia and eventually cancer. The Hedgehog
  signaling pathway is aberrantly activated during gastric cancer. MSCs recruited
  from the bone marrow to the tumor site are a major source of Shh and provide a proliferative
  stimulus for the epithelium.
