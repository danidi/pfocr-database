caption: Molecular clock control of the TGFβ signaling cascade modulates brown adipogenesis.
  The opposing transcriptional regulators of the molecular clock circuit, Bmal1 and
  Rev-erbα, exerts positive and negative transcriptional regulations of key components
  of the TGFβ signaling pathway, through their specific E-box and RORE elements, respectively.
  This regulation of TGFβ pathway, a key inhibitory mechanism of brown adipocyte development,
  leads to suppression and promotion of mesenchymal commitment to the brown lineage
  and its subsequent mature differentiation to mature adipocyte by Bmal1 and Rev-erbα,
  respectively.
