caption: 'Toyocamycin and sangivamycin are produced by a cluster of genes in S. rimosus.
  Organization of gene cluster (a) and putative biosynthetic pathway for production
  of sangivamycin and toyocamycin (b). Radiotracer experiments () have shown that,
  during the conversion of purines to toyocamycin, carbon 2 (orange) is retained and
  carbon 8 (green) is lost and that the pyrrole carbons in toyocamycin (red) are derived
  from the ribose on the nucleoside precursor (.) Predicted functions of gene products
  are based on hits in PSI-BLAST analysis. The putative functions of the proteins
  are as follows: toyA, LuxR transcriptional regulator; toyB, 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin
  synthase; toyC, radical SAM family protein; toyE, GMP reductase; toyF, adenylosuccinate
  lyase; toyG, adenylosuccinate synthetase; toyH, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate transferase;
  toyI, phosphatase; toyK, QueC related protein. Functions of ToyD (GTP cyclohydrolase
  I) and ToyJKL (toyocamycin nitrile hydratase) were demonstrated biochemically in
  this study.'
