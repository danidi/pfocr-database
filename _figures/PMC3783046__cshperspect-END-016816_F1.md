caption: Organization of the endosomal pathway. In mammalian cells but perhaps not
  in yeast, the endocytic pathway can be divided into two functional territories,
  recycling/reutilization vs. degradation, which are linked by membrane transport.
  The plasma membrane and early endosomal elements belong to the recycling/reutilization
  territory through which large amounts of fluid or membrane are trafficked, ∼30%
  of the cell volume and the surface area of the plasma membrane per hour (; ; ),
  or perhaps more (). In early endosomes, cargo is sorted for recycling/reutilization
  or degradation. In the latter case, transport to late endosomes occurs via endosomal
  carrier vesicles/multivesicular bodies (ECVs/MVBs), where RAB5-to-RAB7 conversion
  may occur (). This transport step ensures that recycling and degradation pathways
  remain well segregated. Importantly, the reutilization/recycling and degradation
  compartments not only fulfill distinct functions but also show different protein
  and lipid compositions. Regulatory short-lived phosphoinositides mediate dynamics
  of endosomal elements in the reutilization/recycling pathway. Less is known about
  the role of regulatory phosphoinositides at late stages of the degradation pathway,
  where degradation-resistant LBPA (lysobisphosphatidic acid) membranes may mediate
  intraendosomal dynamics and cholesterol export. Importantly, the endosomal pathway
  also serves as an input or output for other membrane trafficking pathways, as indicated.
