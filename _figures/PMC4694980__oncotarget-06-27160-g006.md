caption: Ingenuity Analysis interactome linking ERK and PKCs with protection against
  oxidative stress, mitochondrial electron transport and NADPH oxidase activity, the
  pentose phosphate pathway and ROS generation. Regulatory kinases are encircled in
  blue. Nodes in red, up-regulated proteins. Nodes in green, down-modulated proteins.
  In white, predicted protein nodes; A, activation; B, binding; C, causes/leads to;
  CC, chemical-chemical interaction; CP, chemical-protein interaction; E, expression;
  EC, enzyme catalysis; I, inhibition; L, proteolysis; LO, localization; M, biochemical
  modification; MB, group/complex; P, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation; PD Protein-DNA
  binding; PP Protein-Protein binding; PR Protein-RNA binding; RB Regulation of Binding;
  RE Reaction; RR RNA-RNA Binding; T Transcription; TR Translocation. Dash arrows,
  indirect interactions.
