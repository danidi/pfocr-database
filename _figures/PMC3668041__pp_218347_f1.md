caption: Diterpene biosynthesis. Schematic of proposed pathways leading from  1 to
  pseudolaric acid B 2, cis-abienol 3, triptolide 4, oridonin 5, carnosol 6, marrubiin
  7, forskolin 8, grindelic acid 9, ingenol-3-angelate 10, and jatrophone 11. These
  diterpenes are formed by bifunctional class I or class I/II enzymes or pairs of
  monofunctional class II and class I , catalyzing the cycloisomerization of  into
  distinct diterpene scaffolds. Products of  can undergo various functional modifications
  primarily through the activity of  enzymes. Considering the modular organization
  of diterpene specialized metabolism (e.g. ), we showed the variable  and  enzyme
  modules as “LEGO-like” blocks. This is conceptually modified from , who referred
  to the five-carbon units of terpenoids as “LEGO” blocks. Here, the different colors
  of the  modules indicate variations of the γβα three-domain structure of plant ;
  a red “X” indicates loss of function of class I or class II activity. Recombining  and  enzyme
  modules of diterpene pathway may allow for production of known and new diterpenes
  through metabolic engineering or synthetic biology.
