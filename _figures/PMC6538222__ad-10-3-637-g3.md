caption: The Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Under physiological conditions, Nrf2 is restricted
  in the cytoplasm via its association with Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 complex. In response to
  oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 translocates to the nucleus and heterodimerizes
  with one of the small Maf (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog) proteins.
  This complex activates the ARE-dependent gene expression of a series of antioxidative
  and cytoprotective proteins.
