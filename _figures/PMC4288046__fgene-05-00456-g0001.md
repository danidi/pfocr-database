caption: BMP9/10 are ligands of the ALK1-Endoglin receptor complex and activate the
  Smad pathway in endothelial cells. BMP9/10 bind to a heterotetrameric complex composed
  of two type I receptors (ALK1) and two type II receptors (BMPR2, ActR2A, or ActR2B).
  Endoglin is a co-receptor of this complex and enhances signaling. Following ligand
  binding, receptors are phosphorylated and propagate signal through R-Smad 1, 5,
  8 phosphorylation. The R-Smads then associate with Smad4 to regulate target gene
  transcription in the nucleus.
