caption: The model depicts two NIMROD transmembrane proteins SIMU and Draper with
  their extracellular EGF-like NIM repeats (purple ovals) and EMILIN-like (EMI) protein
  interaction domains. Kurant et al. demonstrate that the novel glial cell membrane
  protein SIMU tethers apoptotic cells for efficient phagocytic clearance of apoptotic
  neurons in the developing Drosophila CNS. SIMU also is in the same pathway as Draper
  and appears to function upstream of Draper, and the authors suggest an additional
  role for Draper in corpse degradation. Others have found a role for Draper in corpse
  recognition (binding to an unknown ligand) and internalization via the cytoplasmic
  adapter dCED-6), thus the arrows indicate that Draper may also directly recognize
  apoptotic cells via an unknown ligand. How SIMU talks to Draper is not known, but
  one speculation would be that the EMI domains of the two proteins play a role in
  their communication. Since SIMU appears to be involved in the initial recognition
  and uptake steps but lacks an intracellular signaling domain it is possible that
  SIMU interacts with another engulfment receptor(s) to transmit signals necessary
  for cytoskeletal rearrangement and corpse internalization.
