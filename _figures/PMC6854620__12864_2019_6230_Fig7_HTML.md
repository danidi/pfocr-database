caption: Running young is more effective than running at midlife. a Depiction of transcriptional
  changes occurring in a young mouse due to running, including upregulation of collagens
  and laminins from astrocytes, pericytes and endothelial cells, as well as induction
  of the VEGFA-KDR-DLL4 angiogenesis pathway. b Depiction of molecular changes occurring
  in midlife mice due to running, including downregulation of collagens and laminins,
  and a trend for induction of early angiogenesis genes from astrocytes (MMP14, VEGFA)
  but an attenuated downstream angiogenesis response (FLT-1, DLL4, NOTCH1) in endothelial
  cells
