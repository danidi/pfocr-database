caption: Schematic representation of regulatory mechanisms that control the switch
  from PKM1 to PKM2. The diagram shows the region of the PKM gene that contains mutually
  exclusive exons 9 and 10, which are included in PKM1 and PKM2 transcripts, respectively.
  Recognition of exon 9 is inhibited by hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, and PTB/hnRNP I that bind
  to regulatory elements flanking the exon. Several mechanisms contribute to increase
  skipping of exon9 and hence PKM2 production. The MYC oncogene exerts its influence
  by increasing the expression of the three hnRNP proteins. NEK2 kinase, whose expression
  is under the positive control of MYC (), promotes PKM2 specific splicing through
  an interaction with hnRNPA1 and A2. In addition, phosphorylation of Ser6 of hnRNPA1
  by S6K2 of the mTOR pathway facilitates hnRNPA1 binding to the splicing site of
  the PKM gene. Finally, selection of exon10 is promoted by splicing factor SRSF3.
  PKM1 production, in contrast, is induced by RBM4 that, upon binding to exon 8, inhibits
  the interaction of PTB/hnRNP I with regulatory elements controlling exon 9 splicing.
