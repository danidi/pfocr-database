caption: 'The signaling pathway changes triggered by HLJDD and its three principals.
  Red arrow represents the increased metabolites in MCAO rats and blue arrow represents
  the decreased metabolites in MCAO rats, as determined by 1H NMR. HLJDD and its three
  principals greatly improved the damaged energy metabolism and significantly increased
  cellular antioxidants to scavenge overgenerated ROS during I/R. Autophagy could
  be induced by the inactivation of GSK-3β, which in turn was regulated by Akt. Upon
  the treatment of HD, Ber, and Jas, GSK-3β was inactivated via the regulation of
  the Akt, a positive regulator of p-GSK-3β (arrow: positive regulation; blunt-ended
  line: negative regulation). Similarly, the level of p-GSK-3β was increased by HD,
  Ber, and Jas. HD, Ber, and Bai treatments inactivated p65 by regulation of IKK or
  PI3K/Akt. COX2 and iNOS are downstream of the p65-active signaling pathway. As a
  result, inflammatory responses were inhibited.'
