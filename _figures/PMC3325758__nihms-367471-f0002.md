caption: Common mechanisms for PLCε regulation of CICR in cardiac myocytes and pancreatic
  β cells downstream of Gs-coupled receptors. A) Common upstream components regulate
  of PLCε by Gs coupled receptors in adult cardiac myocytes and isolated pancreatic
  β cells [,]. B) Signaling downstream of PLCε. In red are components found to be
  involved in regulation of CICR in both cardiac myocytes and pancreatic β cells [,].
  An alternative pathway has also been proposed and is depicted in black and may operate
  in β cells as well [].
