caption: Examples of redox regulation of specific transcription factors. Pdx1 gene
  is negatively regulated by redox-sensitive transcription factors FOXO and CBP. Localization
  and transcription activity of FOXO is negatively regulated by PI3K-PKB/AKT signaling
  and positively regulated by the JNK signaling pathway. Activated by oxidative stress/cytokine
  stimuli, JNK enables FOXO nuclear localization. Concurrently redox-sensitive PKB
  is inhibited by H2O2-induced intramolecular disulfide bond formation. Redox sensitive
  NRF2/KEAP1 system regulates expression of key antioxidant enzymes upon ARE region.
  Under oxidizing conditions, the cytoplasmic complex dissociates, NRF2 enters the
  nucleus and functions as a transcription factor. Redox-sensitive cysteines in PAX
  transcription factors directly regulate their DNA-binding ability. ARE—antioxidant
  response elements, CBP—p300/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-binding
  protein, FOXO—forkhead box O protein, IGF—insulin-like growth factor, JNK—c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase, KEAP1—Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, NRF2—nuclear factor
  erythroid 2-related factor 2, PAX4/6—paired-homeobox genes, PDX1—pancreas/duodenum
  homeobox protein 1, PI3K—phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PP2A—protein phosphatase 2A,
  PKB—protein kinase B.
