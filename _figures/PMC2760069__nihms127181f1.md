caption: In response to sonic hedgehog secreted by the notochord, VEGF is secreted
  by adjacent somite leading to arterialization of the dorsal aorta. VEGF up-regulates
  Notch pathway including Notch-1 and its ligand, Delta-like-4 in nearby endothelial
  cells through activity of the transcription factors Foxc1 and Foxc2. Subsequently,
  there is expression of gridlock (in zebrafish) and hesr1/hesr2 (in mice) which,
  in addition to the synergistic action of Sox7 and Sox18 leads to arterial specification
  presumably via EphrinB2 activation. In the cardinal vein, COUP-TFII is required
  for strong expression of EphB4 and venous differentiation.
