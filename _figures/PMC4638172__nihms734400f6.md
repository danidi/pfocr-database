caption: A model for modulation of the gastric mucosal glycophenotype during Helicobacter
  pylori chronic infection and implications in bacterial adhesion and pathogenesis.
  In healthy gastric mucosa, H. pylori adhesion to the epithelial cells is mainly
  mediated by BabA recognition of H-type 1 (H1) and Lewis b (Leb) structures present
  on glycoproteins (mainly mucins) expressed on gastric surface epithelium. This glycan-mediated
  adhesion favors translocation of bacterial virulence factors, such as CagA and peptidoglycan
  (PGN), through the type IV secretion system (T4SS) into the host cells, leading
  to the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways that culminate in
  activation of transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-8 and TNF-α.
  We propose that during chronic infection and gastric mucosa inflammation, the increased
  levels of TNF-α result in stimulation of the NF-κB canonical pathway, with translocation
  of p65 to the nucleus and activation of B3GNT5 gene transcription. Although not
  depicted in this illustration, it cannot be excluded direct activation of NF-κB
  pathway by bacterial products (CagA, PGN) or activation by TNF-α secreted by recruited
  inflammatory cells. The up-regulation of β3Gnt5 activity leads to increased biosynthesis
  of terminal sialylated type 1/2 structures in glycosphingolipids, resulting in a
  remodeling of the gastric epithelial cells glycophenotype. The increased expression
  of the inflammation-associated sialylated structures, recognized by the sialic acid
  binding adhesin (SabA), promotes a closer membrane attachment of H. pylori to inflamed
  gastric mucosa, an important feature for infection chronicity.
