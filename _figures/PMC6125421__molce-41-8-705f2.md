caption: ER-resident proteins IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 sense ER stress and deliver distinct
  signals from the ER to the cytosol. Under normal conditions, Grp78 binds to the
  ER luminal domains of sensor proteins and inhibits their activation. However, Grp78
  dissociates from the sensors in response to ER stress and binds to unfolded proteins,
  leading to activation of the sensors. (A) IRE1 pathway; IRE1 has Ser/Thr kinase
  and RNase domain in the cytoplasmic region, and ER stress induces IRE1 oligomerization
  and autophosphorylation of the kinase domain. The RNase domain of activated IRE1
  performs unconventional splicing and cleaves 26 intronic nucleotides from XBP1 mRNA
  in mammalian cells. This splicing induces a translational frame-shift, and the truncated
  XBP1 mRNA encodes XBP1s, which contains a new carboxyl terminus. As a transcription
  factor, XBP1s activates UPR-related genes including ER chaperones, ERAD components,
  and lipid-biosynthetic enzymes. (B) PERK pathway; PERK is a protein Ser/Thr kinase
  that undergoes oligomerization and autophosphorylation of the kinase domain under
  conditions of ER stress. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α at serine 51, resulting
  in general inhibition of protein translation. However, phosphorylated eIF2α selectively
  increases the translation of ATF4, which upregulates CHOP and GADD34 mRNA. As a
  negative feedback mechanism, GADD34 promotes dephosphorylation of eIF2α to restore
  protein synthesis following elimination of ER stress. However, failure to alleviate
  ER stress leads to CHOP-mediated apoptosis. (C) ATF6 pathway; ATF6 has a bZIP domain
  in the cytosol and translocates from the ER to the Golgi apparatus under ER stress.
  ATF6 is then cleaved by the proteases S1P and S2P to produce the aminoterminus of
  ATF6 (ATF6-N), which then migrates to the nucleus and upregulates target genes encoding
  ER chaperones, ERAD components, and XBP1. RNase, endoribonuclease; XBP1, X-box binding
  protein 1; eIF2α, α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2; ATF4,
  activating transcription factor 4; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; GADD34, growth
  arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34; S1P, site-1 protease.
