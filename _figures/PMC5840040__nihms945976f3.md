caption: 'Thermodynamic description of the eIF2B catalytic cycle. (A) Thermodynamic
  description of the pathway of eIF2B-catalyzed recycling of eIF2-GDP to the TC and
  ribosome binding. Solid arrows indicate progression along the path, with steps labeled
  as follows: (I) displacement of eIF5 from eIF2-GDP by eIF2B, (II) eIF2B-promoted
  dissociation of GDP from eIF2, (III) binding of GTP to eIF2B-bound apo-eIF2, (IV)
  binding of Met-tRNAi to form the TC on eIF2B, and (V) displacement of eIF2B from
  the TC by eIF5. Dashed arrows represent steps off the main pathway. Red crosses
  mark steps that can be safely ignored because of either off rates being too slow
  on the time scale of translation or the equilibrium being shifted too far away from
  the product. Dissociation constants (KDs) are provided for each step and represent
  either experimentally determined values reported in the literature (black) or calculated
  (blue) or estimated (red) values based on thermodynamic coupling considerations
  (see ). The ratios of KDs and resulting equilibria for the relevant steps are shown
  in the table on the right. (B) Thermodynamic description of how phosphorylation
  blocks catalysis by inhibiting eIF2B-mediated nucleotide exchange. The color and
  overall scheme are identical to those presented in panel A. KDs affected by phosphorylation
  are underlined. Because the affinity of eIF2B for apo-eIF2(α-P) (reaction intermediate)
  is the same as that for eIF2(α-P)-GDP (substrate), the enzymatic driving force is
  removed and eIF2B has no effect on GDP dissociation. (C) Activation energies for
  nucleotide exchange on eIF2 when free, in the presence of eIF2B, and when phosphorylated.'
