caption: After allograft liver transplantation, IL-22 was secreted by multiple cell
  sources (and possibly αβ T cells, γδ T cells, NKT cells and ILCs) stimulated by
  the acute injection process. Through activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway,
  IL-22 plays a dual role towards regulating graft survival. IL-22 may make a protective
  contribution at IRI in allograft liver transplantation by promoting regeneration
  and proliferation, anti-apoptosis and repair of injury functions for the graft.
  Meanwhile, persistent over-expression of IL-22 would lead to pathogenic functions
  for the graft at AR stage, because IL-22 can also induce the inflammatory response,
  increasing chemokines, recruiting inflammatory factors like Th17, and reducing Treg
  cells.
