caption: 'A. Complement activation on diseased host surfaces involves diverse recognition
  molecules and initiation mechanisms that underlie three distinct activation pathways
  operating either in parallel or independently of each other. Briefly, binding of
  C1 to antigen-antibody complexes (e.g. in autoimmune pathologies) triggers the classical
  pathway (CP), while binding of MBL/ficolin or properdin to target surfaces, via
  recognition of distinct molecular patterns, initiates the lectin pathway (LP) and
  alternative pathway (AP), respectively. Irrespective of their initiating trigger,
  all pathways converge at the proteolytic activation of C3, the central component
  of the cascade. Assembly of C3 convertases via any of the three aforementioned activation
  pathways promotes surface opsonization by C3 fragment deposition mainly through
  an AP-mediated amplification loop, and also leads to effector generation (e.g. C3a
  anaphylatoxin release). C3 activation is the prerequisite for the downstream activation
  of the lytic pathway that begins with the cleavage of C5 and culminates in the assembly
  of the cell-perforating MAC. Both fluid-phase and surface-bound complement regulators
  (e.g. factor H, CR1, MCP) promote the factor I-mediated degradation of C3b into
  bioactive fragments that mediate a plethora of immunomodulatory functions in health
  and disease (including inflammatory signaling, phagocytic activation and modulation
  of adaptive immune responses). Cleavage of the central complement components C3
  and C5 by their respective convertases results in the generation of the anaphylatoxins
  C3a and C5a that, through interaction with their cognate receptors (C3aR, C5aR1),
  trigger potent inflammatory signaling and chemotactic responses in a variety of
  myeloid and non-myeloid cell types. B. Therapeutic modulation of complement using
  the peptidic C3-targeted inhibitor compstatin: Compstatin acts as a highly selective
  protein-protein interaction inhibitor. Binding of compstatin to native C3 and also
  to C3b-containing convertases results in potent and broad complement inhibition
  through abrogation of C3 activation and AP-mediated amplification of C3 cleavage.
  The lack of C3b deposition also prevents C5 convertase assembly and downstream effector
  generation (e.g. C5a, MAC). The complement inhibitory action of compstatin is exerted
  regardless of the upstream trigger or complement pathway (CP, LP, AP) involved.
  C. Therapeutic intervention at different steps of the complement cascade affords
  distinct benefits and limitations to each targeting approach. Intervention at the
  early stages of complement initiation, such as inhibition of C1s and MASPs by C1-INH,
  affords effective blockade of the CP and LP, while letting the alternative pathway
  operate and preserve its homeostatic and immune surveillance functions. However,
  upstream inhibition may also still allow amplification of potentially harmful activation
  on diseased tissue. C3 interception using peptidic inhibitors of the compstatin
  family results in abrogation of C3 activation by the convertases, inhibition of
  AP-mediated amplification and downstream effector generation. However, compstatin
  does not affect initial activation of the AP through the ‘C3 tick-over’ mechanism
  and also allows for C4b generation through upstream activation of the CP and LP.
  Therefore compstatin treatment may still allow for residual opsonic activity and
  complement-mediated immune surveillance. Finally, C5 blockade selectively targets
  the lytic pathway of complement abrogating C5 activation and generation of detrimental
  downstream effectors (i.e. C5a, MAC), while leaving intact upstream activation pathways
  including C3 activation and the AP-mediated amplification loop.Abbreviations: BCR,
