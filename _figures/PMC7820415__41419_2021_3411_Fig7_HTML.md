caption: In cervical cancer, loss of HOXB4 upregulated β-catenin and its downstream
  gene c-Myc, which contributed to the enhancement of the cell cycle and promoted
  tumor progression. In HOXB4-overexpressing cervical cancer cells, HOXB4 was accessed
  to the nucleus and transcriptionally repressed β-catenin expression, leading to
  impaired nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which subsequently contributed to the
  inhibition of tumor progression.
