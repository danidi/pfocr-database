caption: A model of cnxPg action. (A) In the early Xenopus embryo, XTCF3 appears to
  repress the ventral expression of dorsalizing genes (e.g., Siamois); on the dorsal
  side of the embryo, increased levels of β-catenin act to suppress the repressive
  action of XTCF3. cnxPgs stabilize β-catenin through interactions with components
  of the β-catenin turnover system, i.e., APC and Axin. They can also act directly
  on TCFs by sequestering them in the cytoplasm. (B) In Drosophila, tethered armadillo
  inhibits the armadillo turnover system, leading to increased levels of armadillo,
  interactions with pangolin/dTCF (Pan/dTCF), and altered gene expression. Tethered
  armadillo has been shown to interact strongly with DE-cadherin (). In the absence
  of wild-type armadillo, the interaction between tethered armadillo and cadherins
  would be expected to increase, thereby suppressing the ability of tethered armadillo
  to interact with Pan/dTCF. In contrast, cnxPg does not appear to interact significantly
  with E-cadherin in A6 cells (see Figure , A and B). The idea that cnxPg could sequester
  TCFs in the cytoplasm of vertebrate cells is similar to the pathway (C) proposed
  for Wnt signaling in the early C. elegans embryo by  and . Based on the data presented
  here, we suggest that cnxPg can contribute to the induction of dorsal mesoderm by
  stabilizing β-catenin and sequestering XTCFs or other negatively acting factors.
