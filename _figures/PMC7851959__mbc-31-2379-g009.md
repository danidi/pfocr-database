caption: Model of Rho1 activation. Various signals including ligand–GPCR interactions,
  integrin, and adherens junction signaling converge on Rho1 signaling (; ; ; ). RN-tre
  is a known Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that was shown herein to regulate
  Rho1 signaling by regulating the amount of active Rho1 in Drosophila S2 cells. Inactive
  GDP-bound Rho1 is activated by a multitude of guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  (GEFs), including RhoGEF2, Dp114RhoGEF, and Pebble (), that exchange GDP for GTP.
  Rho1-GTP can activate Rho kinase (Rok), which phosphorylates regulatory light chain
  (RLC, encoded by the Drosophila gene spaghetti squash or sqh) of nonmuscle myosin
  II (NMII). Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and citron kinase are additional minor
  contributors to NMII activation. When the RLC is phosphorylated on an inactive autoinhibited
  NMII hexamer, NMII becomes uninhibited and takes a conformation more favorable to
  binding actin and making higher-order oligomers. More active NMII contributes to
  increased actomyosin contractility. The myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit MYPT-75D
  targets Flapwing (Flw; PP1β9C) to NMII where Flw dephosphorylates the RLC, and it
  is postulated that PP1c has dephosphorylation activity for RLC as well, it being
  trafficked by the myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit myosin-binding subunit (MBS)
  (). Various Rho GAPs (including RhoGAP18B, RhoGAPp190, RhoGAP100F, Conundrum, and
  Crossveinless c) inactivate Rho1 by facilitating the dephosphorylation of GTP bound
  to Rho1 (; ; ; ; ). Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) dampens
  Rho1 signaling by sequestering both active and inactive Rho1 (; ).
