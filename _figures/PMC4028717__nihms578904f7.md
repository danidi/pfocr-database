caption: Triptolide treatment sensitizes cells to TRAIL-induced death by down-regulation
  of c-FLIP and up-regulation of DR5. Finally, in the presence of triptolide, low
  concentration of TRAIL activated the death receptor pathway, resulting in LMP and
  MOMP mediated pancreatic cancer cell death.
