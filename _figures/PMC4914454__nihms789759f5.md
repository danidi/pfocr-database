caption: Nuclear translocation of GRK5 occurs via stimulation of the Gαq pathway following
  pathologic stimulus such as transaortic constriction (TAC) or phenylephrine (PE)
  stimulation. This occurs following activation of calmodulin (CaM) by calcium (Ca2+)
  and subsequent binding to the N-terminus of GRK5. CaM binding causes GRK5 to dissociate
  from the plasma membrane and translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, GRK5
  phosphorylates HDAC5 leading to its nuclear export and derepression of the transcription
  factor MEF2. In parallel, CaM also binds to and activates the phosphatase calcineurin
  which dephosphorylates NFAT leading to its nuclear translocation. At the level of
  the DNA, GRK5 potentiates NFAT:DNA binding and enhances the transcription of hypertrophic
  genes and subsequent maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy. Adapted from Hullmann et.
  al. “GRK5-Mediated Exacerbation of Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy Involves Facilitation
  of Nuclear NFAT Activity”, Circ Res (2014) [].
