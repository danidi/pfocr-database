caption: 'a | The role of autophagy in the elimination of microorganisms is shown.
  An incoming microorganism can induce autophagy by competing for nutrients or by
  stimulating innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). When the
  microorganism is taken up by phagocytosis and remains in an intact vacuole, an autophagic
  process termed LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) can promote the maturation of autophagosomes
  into autolysosomes. Xenophagy of pathogens that enter the cytosol can be initiated
  by sequestosome 1-like receptors (SLRs) or other mechanisms, including nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2)–autophagy-related protein 16-like
  1 (ATG16L1) interactions. b Several examples of the role of autophagy in the control
  of pro-inflammatory signalling (see also ) are shown. Failure to remove SLRs by
  autophagy can increase the levels of these receptors and the levels of pro-inflammatory
  signalling. Autophagy can deliver cytoplasmic pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) to endocytic TLRs and can stimulate their activity. NOD-like receptors (NLRs;
  such as NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3)) and RIG-I-like
  receptors (RLRs; such as absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)) show complex positive and
  negative co-regulation with autophagy: the ATG5–ATG12 complex inhibits retinoic
  acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signalling, and autophagy limits inflammasome activation
  by removing damaged mitochondria, which then release the inflammasome activators
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial DNA. c The role of autophagy in
  adaptive immunity is shown. Autophagy can increase the MHC class II presentation
  of cytoplasmic antigens, including self or viral antigens, as well as promoting
  the citrullination of antigens. LAP can enhance the processing of particulate antigens
  for MHC class II presentation. NOD2 enhances autophagic antigen presentation. Autophagy
  may directly or indirectly affect MHC class I presentation by competing with the
  proteasome for substrates, by influencing the peptidome pools through the control
  of levels of components of microRNA (miRNA) machinery (for example, argonaute (AGO)
  and DICER), or by supporting unconventional MHC class I presentation. In addition,
  autophagy affects the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), B1 cell
  development, plasma cell survival and IgG secretion. Autophagy affects T cell survival
  following T cell receptor (TCR) activation, and it destabilizes the immunological
  synapse. It also controls innate immune cell (such as macrophage) signalling through
  the release of interleukin-1α _(IL-1α)_ _and IL-1β, which influence the polarization
  of T cells into T helper 17 (TH17) cells. Autophagy also affects naive T cell repertoire
  selection in the thymus and the survival and function of maturing T cells by removing
  the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus ensuring calcium homeostasis.
  d The role of autophagy in the secretion of immune mediators is shown. Autophagy
  affects the quality of regulated secretion from pre-stored granules. Autophagy affects
  the quality and the quantity of the output of the constitutive secretory pathway
  (which is the conventional pathway of protein secretion via the ER, the Golgi apparatus
  and the plasma membrane). Autophagy supports a form of unconventional secretion
  that captures cytoplasmic proteins for extracellular release. Note that secretory
  protein cargo in the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways contains conventional
  leader peptides for co-translational import into the ER lumen, whereas protein cargo
  that enters the unconventional secretory pathway lacks leader peptides and does
  not enter the ER. Dashed arrow indicates that this pathway remains to be defined.
