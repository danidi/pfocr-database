caption: 'A brief overview of the autophagy pathway, which is a catabolic process
  that includes a specific intracellular cargo, such as organelles or endosomal contents
  that are intended for degradation. The autophagy process is initiated by an extracellular
  stimulus or cargo recognition that prompts the formation of the phagophore. The
  cargo is then engulfed within a double-membrane vesicle (an autophagosome). Increased
  initiation to engage phagophores for autophagy involves the activation of the ULK1
  complex that further induces the nucleation complex, which includes PtdIns3K, PIK3,
  and BECN1. Later, LC3 is conjugated to the phagophores and is responsible for their
  maturation and elongation. Upon maturation, the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome,
  with its content being released and degraded by lysosomal enzymes. Recent evidence
  suggests that PFKFB3 induces autophagy through increased Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) production. However, some dissertations suggest an opposite relationship—insufficient
  PFKFB3 activity results in lower Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) availability and
  reduced autophagy. Mitochondrial damage increases ROS and decreases cellular ATP
  levels. ROS may activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which positively regulates
  autophagy through phosphorylation of BECN1. Abbreviations: ULK1 complex—unc-51 like
  autophagy activating kinase 1 complex, PIK3C3—phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic
  subunit type 3, PIK3R4—phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 4, BECN1—Beclin
  1, PtdIns 3K—phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, LC3—Microtubule-associated proteins
