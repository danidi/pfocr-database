caption: Proposed model for enhanced cytotoxicity due to combination of P-gp and proteasome
  inhibitors. Multiple mechanisms of chemoresistance such as upregulated drug efflux,
  drug metabolism, NF-κB pathway could be targeted by combining P-gp inhibitors with
  proteasome inhibitors. Additionally, inhibition of calcium channels might also contribute
  to the breast cancer cells chemosensitization to proteasome inhibitors.
