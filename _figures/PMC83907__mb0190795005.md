caption: Diagram depicting components of the signaling pathway hypothesized to play
  a role in cellular stress-mediated induction of type B CA-VI. Cellular stress leads
  to the induction of the chop gene and accumulation of CHOP protein. The latter forms
  a dimer with a member of the C/EBP family, and this activates the type B CA-VI promoter.
  Intracellular accumulation of CA-VI is predicted to increase the proton concentration
  in the cell by promoting the hydration of CO2 produced by the metabolic activity
  of the cell.
