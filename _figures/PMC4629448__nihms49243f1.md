caption: 'Regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Ligand-induced receptor oligomerization
  activates JAKs which subsequently phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic
  portion of the receptor. The quiescent STAT monomers are then recruited to the activated
  receptor complex via the interaction of the SH2 domains with phosphotyrosine docking
  sites. STATs are phosphorylated by the JAKs on a conserved tyrosine residue in the
  c-terminal domain to form STAT homo- or heterodimers. STATs dissociate from the
  receptor after the dimerization and translocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  STATs bind to specific response elements and induce gene transcription. Signaling
  is inhibited by four different mechanisms: SHP dephosphorylates activated JAKs and
  STATs, SOCS inhibits JAKs and STATs, and PIAS and SLIM inhibit transcriptional activities.'
