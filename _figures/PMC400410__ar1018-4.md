caption: Functional associations of hypervariable (HV) genes in patients with juvenile
  rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Tabular data from the HV gene analysis was analyzed
  using Pathway Assist software. The graphical output delineating a functionally related
  network of genes is shown. Genes that displayed increased variation in expression
  in JRA patients are represented as red ovals. Major biologic processes related to
  these genes are represented as yellow rectangles. JRA is represented as a yellow
  square to delineate genes directly associated with pathology. Intracellular objects
  upon which a given set of genes acts are represented as yellow ovals. White ovals
  represent genes that are functionally related to the genes used for analysis. White
  hexagons represent organelles functionally associated with the genes analyzed. Orange
  hexagons represent classes of small molecules associated with the genes analyzed.
  Green squares signify that a defined regulatory relationship exits between genes.
  Blue squares signify that a putative regulatory relationship between genes has been
  identified but not biochemically defined. +, positive regulation; -, negative regulation.
