caption: Result pathway diagram. Diagram of a result pathway for a query from erythrose
  4-phosphate (E4P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to phenylalanine (Phe). Source and
  target metabolites are drawn in green and yellow, respectively. For clarity, pathway
  has been split into two parts, with 5-O-(1-Carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate repeated
  in both parts.
