caption: Possible mechanism for epigenetic silencing of Lgr5 and induction of senescence
  in intestinal epithelial organoids derived from aged mice. The stem cell marker
  Lgr5 is substantially expressed in young intestinal epithelial organoids, but is
  epigenetically silenced by histone H3K27 trimethylation in organoids from aged intestinal
  epithelium. Since Lgr5 is an activator of the Wnt signaling pathway, epigenetic
  silencing of Lgr5 results in suppression of Wnt signaling, which may lead to decreased
  cell proliferation and activation of senescence-associated genes such as p21 due
  to suppression of DNA methylation
