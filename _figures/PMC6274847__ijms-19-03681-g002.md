caption: 'Proline, ornithine, and arginine metabolism and transport in plants. An
  illustration of the components of the proline (Pro) and arginine (Arg) metabolic
  pathways that have been identified to date. Data were taken from previously published
  papers [,,,,,]. Most data were obtained from the model plant A. thaliana, but it
  is hypothesized that this pathway is the same in related plant species. The Pro
  metabolic pathway is depicted by black lines, the blue lines show the Arg pathway,
  and the green line shows the ornithine (Orn) pathway, which is further described
  in . Solid lines show cellular pathways while the dotted lines show the intracellular
  transport of metabolic products. Enzyme transporter proteins are depicted in blue.
