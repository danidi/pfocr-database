caption: Reported genetic modifications that significantly improve flux to and through
  the shikimate pathway in the respective context. Only feedback-resistant enzymes
  and overexpression targets are included, knockouts have not been respected. Highlighted
  in blue are yeast (in most cases S. cerevisiae) genes, green E. coli genes, orange
  C. glutamicum genes, and purple Z. mobilis genes. With the exception of aroL (applied
  in S. cerevisiae), tyrC (applied in E. coli) and aroGfbr (applied in C. glutamicum)
  the respective overexpression targets have not been applied outside their native
  organism. Major enzymes are indicted to the left of the linear part of the pathway;
  DAHPS, 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase; DHQS, 3-dehydroquinate
  synthase; DHQ, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase; SDH, shikimate 5-dehydrogenase; SK,
  shikimate kinase; EPSPS, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase; CS, chorismate
  synthase.
