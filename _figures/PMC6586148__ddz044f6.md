caption: Proposed mechanism of SHP2–ERK1/2 inhibition and STAT3 activation by Sunitinib.
  In response to muscle injury, gp130 mediated by Jak2 can activate both ERK1/2 and
  STAT3. (A) Upon gp130 receptor dimerization in response to growth factor binding,
  constitutively bound Jak2 is activated and trans-phosphorylates gp130 at several
  tyrosine residues (Y). P-Y759 recruits SHP-2 that is phosphorylated by Jak2 and
  signals via Grb2-Sos-Ras–Raf and MEK to activate ERK1/2. Once activated, ERK1/2
  has been shown to directly phosphorylate STAT3 at a serine residue, thus preventing
  phosphorylation at tyrosine residues and nuclear translocation (). ERK1/2 becomes
  the predominant signaling pathway promoting the proliferation of myogenic cells.
  (B) Sunitinib inhibits the activation of ERK1/2, potentially by (1) preventing the
  association of SHP-2 with gp130 and (2) preventing the phosphorylation of SHP-2
  by Jak2. Non-phosphorylated ERK1/2 no longer phosphorylates STAT3 at its serine
  residue, thus allowing tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 by Jak2.
  Dimerized STAT3 translocates into the nucleus where it promotes the transcription
  of the transcription factor MyoD1 that can subsequentially promote the transcription
  of myogenin (Myog). Both MyoD1 and MYOG can then promote the transcription of integrin
  α7 (Itga7). Integrin α7 promotes differentiation and fusion of myofibers, enhancing
  muscle regeneration.
