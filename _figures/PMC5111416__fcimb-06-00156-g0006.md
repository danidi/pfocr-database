caption: A potential mechanism by which iMAC, acting as a ppGpp-dependent metabolic
  switch, induces inviability of V. cholerae. In the presence of glucose, V. cholerae
  normally metabolize glucose by the mixed acid fermentation during early stages.
  As growth proceeds, the environmental pH decreases as a result of the accumulation
  of organic acid metabolites. The glucose metabolic pathway then switches to acetoin
  fermentation to avoid lethal acidification. Previous work demonstrates that intracellular
  (p)ppGpp has a critical role in this glucose metabolic switch. Here, iMAC is characterized
  in terms of its potential role in inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular (p)ppGpp.
  Overall, iMAC successfully prevents the ppGpp-dependent glucose metabolic switch
  by inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular ppGpp. As a result, cells lose their
  viability as their environment becomes acidified as a result of uncontrolled organic
  acid fermentation in glucose-enriched conditions.
