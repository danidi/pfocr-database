caption: NLR-dependent regulation of MHC class I antigen presentation. (A) NLRC5 induces
  chromatin remodeling and recruitment of transcription factors, leading to the transactivation
  of MHC class I, and other related genes in the MHC class I antigen-presentation
  pathway, including LMP2, LMP7, TAP1, and β2-microglobulin. (B) Activation of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome and its effector caspase-1 acts on the NADPH oxidase NOX2 to
  induce phagosome acidification in response to microbial infection. This process
  negatively impacts cross-presentation. (C) NOD1 and NOD2 activation by peptidoglycan
  (PGN) significantly augments DC-mediated cross-presentation via upregulation of
  intracellular components, such as TAP, SEC61, and calnexin, for MHC class I dependent
  antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules expression. In addition, early
  activation of NOD2 signaling alone or in combination with TLR2 may be required for
  stabilisation of the immunoproteasome and promote cross-presentation during an early
  phase of pathogen handling. (D) PGN pre-treatment, prior to antigen encounter, leads
  to progressive inhibition of cross-presentation over time, with almost complete
  inhibition after 18 h.
