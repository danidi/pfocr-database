caption: Under normal (steady-state) conditions, ASMase is located in lysosomes (CAV1-proficient
  EC, upper panel, left). Upon stress induction by ionizing radiation (IR), ASMase
  is translocated to the plasma membrane, presumably facilitated by CAV1-abundant
  regions (lower panel, left). Thereby, IR leads to a rapidly increased ASMase activity,
  followed by ceramide generation (specifically of C16 and C24), which goes along
  with formation of large lipid platforms, and altered signal transduction directly
  affecting the p38/HSP27/MK2/AKT axis. The IR-induced remodeling of plasma membrane
  prior signaling implicates that CAV1 and ASMase-dependent ceramide generation are
  essential for stress-responsive cell-fate decisions like survival and/or cell death.
  CAV1 downregulation or absence in EC caused a constitutively upregulated ASMase
  activity that facilitates the increased generation of ceramide and specifically
  of the ceramide species C16 and C24 (upper panel, right). The resulting increase
  in (stable) large lipid platform formation permanently alters then the ceramide-dependent
  signaling of the p38/HSP27/MK2/AKT axis pathway finally priming EC apoptosis. Upon
  IR-induced stress, increased ceramide levels further increased membrane remodeling
  resulting in an amplified LLP/signalosome signaling finally leading to increased
  HSP27 activation, AKT deactivation, and then EC apoptosis (lower panel, right).
  Elevated ASMase/ceramide signaling in CAV1(−) EC might impact on adjacent tumor
  cell’s survival and growth in a negative manner.
