caption: Model depicting the potential roles of Hrq1 in NER-based lesion processing.
  Cisplatin- and UV-induced intrastrand lesions are processed by one of two primary
  pathways. In PRR, Ubc13-dependent polyubiquitination of PCNA initiates either template
  switching at the lesion, which proceeds via HR, or translesion synthesis. Alternatively,
  global genome (GG) or transcription-coupled (TC) branches of NER excise the lesion
  and resynthesize the missing nucleotides across the resultant gap, processes that,
  in the absence of PRR, require the helicase activity of Hrq1. Interstrand lesions
  that cannot be bypassed by PRR are also repaired by an NER-dependent excision process,
  in a currently enigmatic repair pathway facilitated by Hrq1.
