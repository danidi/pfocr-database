  Tool 2.0. Hsa_circRNA_102610 promotes TGFβ1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  by sponging hsa-miR-130a-3p and blocking the inhibitory effect of hsa-miR-130a-3p
  on Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4. The expression of CyclinD1, Vimentin
  and N-Cadherin is promoted, while the expression of E-Cadherin is inhibited. SMAD4:
  Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4; TGF-β1: Transforming growth factor-β1.'
