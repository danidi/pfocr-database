caption: Possible involvement of ASK1 in insulin resistance and pancreatic β cell
  apoptosis. a) The ASK1-JNK pathway is involved in insulin resistance. In liver cells,
  TNFα activates the ASK1-JNK pathway through ROS production, which induces serine
  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and subsequent inhibition
  of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS, thereby inducing insulin resistance. b) ASK1
  is involved in TXNIP-dependent pancreatic β cell apoptosis. In pancreatic β cells,
  TXNIP is localised mainly in the nucleus. Upon oxidative stress, TXNIP translocates
  into the mitochondria, binds to Trx2, and dissociates Trx2 from ASK1, leading to
  ASK1-dependent apoptosis.
