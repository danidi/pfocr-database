caption: Conventional and alternative MHC class I processing pathways. Cytosolic proteins
  are broken down by the proteasome and transported into the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) where they are loaded on nascent MHC class I molecules and exported for display
  at the cell surface (a). Bacterial proteins are proteolytically degraded in the
  phagolysosome, resulting in generation of MHC class I binding epitopes which are
  then regurgitated from the cell where they load onto MHC class I molecules by displacing
  peptides already loaded through the classical pathway (b). Alternatively these epitopes
  can intercept and bind MHC class I molecules trafficking to and from the cell surface
  in post-Golgi compartments (c).
