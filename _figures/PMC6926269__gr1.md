caption: ECGC induces IL-10 production and M2 macrophage polarization to suppress
  ALD development. Alcohol-induced liver injury is mediated through TLR2 but inhibited
  by TLR3 signaling. ECGC can effectively suppress alcohol-induced liver injury by
  inducing IL-10 expression and M2 polarization. The ECGC-mediated inhibitory effect
  on alcohol-induced liver injury is mediated by activating TLR3 and inhibiting TLR2
  in Kupffer cells.
