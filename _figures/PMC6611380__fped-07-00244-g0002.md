caption: Schematic depicting possible mechanisms of KD pathogenesis. Various infectious
  agents produce superantigens (SAgs) and pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs/MAMPs). SAgs non-specifically activate T cells, probably including potentially
  autoreactive T cells. PAMPs/MAMPs also stimulate immune cells [e.g., macrophages
  (Mϕ), dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes (MCs)] and endothelial cells (ECs) through
  cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (e.g., TLRs, NOD1, Dectin-1/-2). This
  stimulation up-regulates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and
  reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/NOS), leading to a systemic inflammatory reaction.
  On the other hand, PAMPs/MAMPs also activate the complement lectin pathway through
  soluble PRRs (e.g., ficolin-1, mannose binding lectin-2). Activated complement pathways
  can elicit inflammatory vascular damage through recruitment of innate inflammatory
  cells and direct injury to ECs. The extent of the inflammatory reaction is influenced
  by the genetic backgrounds of the individuals, resulting in a limited number of
  children developing KD in response to infectious stimuli.
