caption: Lysosomal, lipid, and cellular mechanisms leading to α-synuclein and Lewy
  body pathology. a Under normal conditions α-synuclein is a natively structured protein
  with synaptic and vesicular functions. In addition to monomeric α-synuclein, α-synuclein
  can exist as physiological α-synuclein multimers (tetramers). α-Synuclein is normally
  transported to intracellular sites, including the synapse, where it participates
  in synaptic release functions. b Several pathways are involved in the degradation
  of α-synuclein and maintenance of its steady-state levels, including the ubiquitin-proteasome
  system (UPS), and c endo-lysosomal pathways. Overexpression of the ubiquitin ligase,
  Nedd4, can rescue α-synuclein toxicity in animal models through increased degradation
  of α-synuclein through the endo-lysosomal pathway (see text). c GBA haploinsufficiency,
  or deficiencies in other lysosomal enzymes, chaperones or transport proteins, can
  cause dysfunction of the lysosome in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia
  (LBD). Increased expression or function of lysosomal enzymes including GBA and Lamp1
  reduce α-synucleinopathy and can rescue midbrain dopamine neuron degeneration in
  α-synucleinopathy preclinical models. d Damaged mitochondria are degraded through
  the mitophagy pathway, which can also be disrupted in aging and in familial PD and
  increases autophagic lysosomal load. e As described in this review, the structural
  similarity of α-synuclein with apolipoproteins suggests an additional role for α-synuclein
  in lipid transport. An aberrant accumulation of lipids, including glycosphingolipids
  in aging and in PD, are associated with abnormal lipidation of α-synuclein, and
  eventually accumulation of α-synuclein into insoluble high molecular weight forms.
  Mutations in, overexpression of, and loss of function of α-synuclein, contribute
  to cellular toxicities and pathology, including perturbation of lipid-vesicle trafficking
  and axonal transport. Recent advanced microscopic evidence shows that the Lewy body
  is composed of a large lipid core also including cellular organelles including mitochondria,
  lipids and protein aggregates. ER (endoplasmic reticulum), Lys (lysosome), Mt (mitochondria),
  Ub (ubiquitin), Ves (vesicle)
