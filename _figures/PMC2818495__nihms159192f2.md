caption: Prl binding brings the PrlR-associated Jak2 molecules into close proximity
  and subsequent activation. Cytoplasmic Stat5a/b proteins are recruited to the activated
  Prl-receptor-Jak2 complex, and Jak2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues Y694 and Y699
  of Stat5a and Stat5b, respectively, leading them to homo- or heterodimerize through
  a phosphotyrosine SH2 domain interaction. Phosphorylated Stat5a/b dimers translocate
  from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where they bind to DNA to regulate transcription.
