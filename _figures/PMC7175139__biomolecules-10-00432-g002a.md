caption: 'Mechanisms of mechanotransduction. Graphical summary of the current knowledge
  on the transduction of mechanical signals into a cellular response. A) Mechanical
  strain applied to the cell and (the resulting) fluid flow activate receptors and
  channels and their downstream signaling cascades. In a tissue context, strain is
  transmitted between cells via a series of adhesion molecules such as integrins,
  cadherins, and tight junctions. Transcription factors become nucleotropic and address
  DNA regulatory elements such as repressors, enhancers, and their specific DNA response
  elements. Adaptive transcription and translation are initiated and lead to changes
  in transcriptome, proteome, and especially the secretome to communicate with neighbors
  and distant tissues. The expression and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins
  as parts of the secretome are upregulated. As a consequence, the incoming forces
  and the resistive response to external forces are enhanced, and a new homeostasis
  situation is produced. Similarly, the production of proteins of the cytoskeleton
  is enhanced, the cytoskeleton is also becoming stiffer, and the contractile proteins
  generate even more active forces. B) Fluid flow is sensed by the primary cilium.

  sequences to be continuously released into the extracellular environment and subsequently
  the circulation. The release of vesicles upon exercise-related calcium flux into
  the cell has been demonstrated to be a candidate mechanism for the release of proteins
