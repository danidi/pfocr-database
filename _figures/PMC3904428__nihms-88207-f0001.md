caption: RalGTPases may be activated by a variety of stimuli, including guanidine
  nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs) activated by upstream activation of Ras or
  independent of Ras activation. Also, several other stimuli have been identified
  that activate Ral, perhaps independently of either of these factors. These include
  processes known to be hyperactive in cancer cells, including oxidative damage, calcium
  signaling, and androgen withdrawal []. Once activated by exchange of GDP for GTP,
  Ral GTPases are able to associate physically with several known (and likely other
  uncharacterized) effector proteins, to mediate diverse cellular effects.
