caption: Schematic outline representing the acute effect of Aβ (1-42) on cholesterol
  dyshomeostasis-induced neurotoxicity and its possible protection through quinovic
  acid. The proteotoxic Aβ (1-42) increased p53 expression, then later increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase (HMGCR) of cholesterol synthesis (mevalonate pathway). The upsurge in
  cholesterol increased oxidative stress and disrupted the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway
  in the brain. This, in turn, leads to increased neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction,
  cell death, and neurodegeneration. However, quinovic acid treatment upregulated
  the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, protecting the brain from Aβ (1-42)-induced neurotoxic
  effect.
