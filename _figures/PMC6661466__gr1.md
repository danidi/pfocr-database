caption: Pathways for 2-KGA synthesis from glucose in Gluconobacter. There exist two
  synthesis pathways for 2-KGA accumulation. One is catalysed by a membrane-bound
  dehydrogenase in the periplasm, in which glucose is directly oxidized to D-GA and
  further oxidised to 2-KGA and 2,5-KGA. The other is catalysed by an intracellular
  dehydrogenase, in which glucose transported into the cytoplasm is oxidised to D-GA,
  and further oxidised to 2-KGA or 5-KGA, or metabolised by the PP pathway. GDH, glucose
  dehydrogenase; GA2DH, gluconate-2-dehydrogenase; GA5DH, gluconate-5-dehydrogenase;
  2KGADH, 2-keto-gluconate dehydrogenase; 5KGADH, 5-keto-gluconate dehydrogenase;
  PP, pentose phosphate.
