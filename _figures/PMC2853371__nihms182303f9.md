caption: The CD28 costimulation, IL-2 signaling, and mTOR pathway regulate Otub1 and
  GRAIL expression, controlling proliferation in primary naive CD4 T cells. CTLA4-Ig,
  anti-IL-2, and Rapamycin regulation of Otub1 and GRAIL expression controls naive
  CD4 T cell proliferation. A, Productive activation of naive CD4 T cells leading
  to proliferation comes about through TCR engagement and CD28 costimulation, IL-2
  production, signaling through the IL-2R leading to phosphorylation of Akt and activation
  of mTOR, expression of Otub1 protein, and subsequent GRAIL degradation, allowing
  proliferation to occur. B, CTLA4-Ig blocks CD28 costimulation, does not allow IL-2
  production, thus prevents Akt phosphorylation, mTOR is inactive, and Otub1 protein
  is absent, leading to the maintenance of GRAIL, inhibiting proliferation. C, Anti-IL-2
  blocks IL-2R engagement, thus preventing Akt phosphorylation, mTOR is inactive,
  and Otub1 protein is absent, leading to the maintenance of GRAIL, inhibiting proliferation.
  D, Rapamycin blocks the activity of mTOR, prevents protein expression of Otubain-1,
  leading to the maintenance of GRAIL, inhibiting proliferation.
