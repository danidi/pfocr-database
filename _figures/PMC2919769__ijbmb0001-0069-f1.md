caption: De novo fatty acid synthesis. The de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway functions
  in both cancers and lipogenic tissues. In both cases, excess glucose goes through
  glycolysis and TCA cycle, and exits mitochondria as citrate which is then converted
  to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase. Carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA is
  catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). FASN condenses one acetyl-CoA and seven
  malonyl-CoA into palmitate which can be then modified into various lipids such as
  phospholipids.
