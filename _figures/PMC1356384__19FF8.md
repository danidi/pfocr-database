caption: FIGURE 8. Schematic diagram illustrating the major pro-apoptotic components
  of the caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways as well as the
  sites where they are inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk. Caspase-dependent apoptosis occurs
  either through the death receptor or the mitochondrial-mediated pathway. In the
  death receptor pathway, the initiator caspase, caspase-8 is activated while, in
  the mitochondrial pathway, the initiator caspase, caspase-9 is activated. Both caspase-8
  and caspase-9 ultimately turn on the effector caspase arm of the pathway as reflected
  in activated caspase-3. In caspase-independent apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane
  permeabilization triggers the release of death-promoting factors such as AIF or
  the serine protease Omni/htra2, which cause caspase-independent death signaling
  downstream from the mitochondria. As illustrated, z-VAD-fmk, the pan-caspase inhibitor,
  blocks both caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways at multiple sites. However, it
  has no effect on the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. The results of the current
  study indicate that T/HS lymph-induced HUVEC apoptosis is occurring through all
  3 apoptotic pathways and thus involves caspase-dependent and caspase-independent
  processes.
