caption: Contribution of BBB breakdown and dysregulated BBB transport to AD pathophysiology
  based on findings in animal models, as shown in  and . BBB breakdown (left) leads
  to perivascular accumulation of blood-derived neurotoxic products in the brain,
  such as red blood cell (RBC)–derived hemoglobin (Hb) and free iron (Fe2+) generating
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidant stress to neurons; potentially toxic plasma
  proteins such as fibrin(ogen), plasmin(ogen), thrombin, and/or autoantibodies, which
  could lead to neuronal injury, cell death, and inflammatory response; and albumin
  contributing to the development of edema, hypoperfusion, and tissue hypoxia. Pericyte
  detachment, degeneration, and loss leads to BBB breakdown. Apolipoprotein E (APOE)
  isoforms differentially regulate pericyte metabolism and BBB integrity. APOE2 and
  APOE3, but not APOE4, act via low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein-1
  (LRP1) on pericytes to inhibit the proinflammatory cyclophilin A (CypA)–matrix metallopeptidase-9
  (MMP-9) pathway. When activated by APOE4, this pathway leads to MMP-9–mediated degradation
  of BBB tight junction and basement membrane proteins causing BBB breakdown. Dysregulated
  BBB transport (right) leads to a loss of equilibrium between Alzheimer’s amyloid
  β (Aβ) efflux and influx across the BBB, which is a key mechanism that maintains
  brain Aβ homeostasis. Aβ efflux is normally mediated via its receptors on brain
  endothelium, including LRP1, which works closely with phosphatidylinositol-binding
  clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) to clear Aβ monomers, oligomers, and aggregates
  from brain across the BBB; LRP2, which clears Aβ in a form of complexes with APOJ
  (clusterin); and P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which mediates active efflux of Aβ from brain
  endothelium to blood. LRP1 and Pgp BBB levels are reduced in AD models before Aβ
  deposition, which contributes to Aβ accumulation in the brain. Aβ influx from blood
  to brain is mediated by the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE),
  which also triggers an inflammatory response. RAGE expression at the BBB is increased
  in AD models, which contributes to Aβ accumulation in the brain and inflammatory
  response. APOE isoforms differentially regulate Aβ clearance. Aβ complexes with
  human APOE2 and APOE3 isoforms are cleared across the BBB by LRP1. APOE4 has lower
  affinity for LRP1 and binds to the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR),
  which slowly transports its ligands across the BBB, including the APOE4–Aβ complex,
  causing its accumulation in the brain. BBB GLUT1 transporter delivers glucose to
  the brain across the BBB and is down-regulated in AD models. Its reduction accelerates
  BBB breakdown and Aβ pathology and leads to tau pathology and neuronal loss. BBB
  MFSD2a (major facilitator superfamily domain–containing protein 2) transports essential
  ω-3 fatty acids into the brain, which is essential for brain development, cognition,
  and maintenance of BBB integrity. Aβ can also accumulate in the perivascular space
  (PVS) between astrocyte end-feet and the vessel wall because of inefficient drainage
  along the perivascular route.

    pathophysiology based on findings in animal models, as shown in  and . BBB breakdown

    Apolipoprotein E (APOE) isoforms differentially regulate pericyte metabolism and

    (right) leads to a loss of equilibrium between Alzheimer’s amyloid β (Aβ) efflux
    and influx across the BBB, which is a key mechanism that maintains brain Aβ homeostasis.
