caption: Complexity of GAL/SPX and receptor systems and pharmacological properties
  of SG2A. The natural ligand GAL binds to GAL1 receptor and GAL2 receptor with high
  affinity but shows relatively low affinity to GAL3 receptor. SPX has high potency
  to activate GAL2 receptor and GAL3 receptor but does not activate GAL1 receptor
  (). The synthetic ligand SPX-based GAL2 receptor agonist (SG2A) exhibits exclusive
  selectivity toward GAL2 receptor but not GAL1 receptor and GAL3 receptor (Reyes-Alcaraz
  et al.,2016). GAL receptors have a wide range of physiological functions through
  subtype-specific signaling pathways. Upon stimulation by a ligand, GAL1 receptor
  and GAL3 receptor induce inhibitory Gisignaling, whereas GAL2 receptor triggers
  stimulatory Gqsignaling. The GAL-induced GAL2 receptor activation induces Gq-coupled
  signaling followed by the β-arrestin (βA)-mediated pathway, including receptor desensitization/internalization
  and initiation of an alternative signaling. Thus, GAL behaves as a classical agonist
  equally inducing Gq-coupled and β-arrestin-mediated pathways. Unlike GAL, SPX and
  SG2A exhibit a biased GAL2 receptor agonism toward the Gq-coupled pathway over β-arrestin-mediated
  pathway such that they induce receptor internalization much less than GAL ().
