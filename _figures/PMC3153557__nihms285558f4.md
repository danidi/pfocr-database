caption: A proposed model. The SE ligand, expressed on antigen presenting cells or
  lymphocytes interacts with cell surface CRT. In DCs this interaction promotes Th17
  polarization, which in healthy individuals could be advantageous against pathogens.
  In RA, due to environmentally-triggered non-genetic changes, the affinity of SE-CRT
  interaction could increase with resultant aberrant activation of the SE pathway,
  excessive Th17 polarization and disease development. IL-17 has been previously shown
  to promote autoimmunity through its effect on many target tissues. In addition to
  its Th17 polarizing effect through activation of DCs, the SE could conceivably directly
  activate functional consequences in other cell systems (shown in italics) known
  to contribute to RA pathogenesis.
