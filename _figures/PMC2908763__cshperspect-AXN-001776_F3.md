caption: Olfactory sensory neuron projections along the anterior–posterior axis in
  the mouse olfactory system. Each OR is thought to generate a unique level of cAMP
  signaling, which is converted to relative expression levels of axon guidance molecules
  such as Nrp1 and Sema3A via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response
  element binding protein (CREB). An axon guidance receptor, Nrp1, and its repulsive
  ligand, Sema3A, are expressed in a complementary manner in OSNs and regulate pretarget
  sorting of axons. This axon sorting mechanism may be important to establish the
  topographic order in the OB based on the relative expression levels of guidance
  molecules expressed by axons. Once OSN axons are sorted, they need to be oriented
  along the correct axis before projecting onto the OB. This probably requires an
  intermediate cue, possibly encoded by Sema3A derived from the target or along the
  pathway between the OE and OB. A, anterior; P, posterior.
