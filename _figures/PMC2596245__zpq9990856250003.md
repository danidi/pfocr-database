caption: EET- or sEHI-mediated antihyperalgesia occurs through 2 distinct mechanisms.
  Several cytochrome P450 family enzymes naturally produce EETs by oxidation of the
  unsaturated bonds of arachidonic acid to result in 4 regioisomers with pleiotropic
  biological activities. These are degraded by sEH, which introduces a water molecule
  opening the epoxide moieties to their corresponding diols or DHETs. The DHETs are
  widely assumed to be less active. EETs have little effect on the expression of the
  COX2 gene in normal animals but down-regulate induced COX2 possibly through an NF-κB-related
  pathway (). Thus, increased EETs can mimic antiinflammatory and analgesic effects
  of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs but as transcriptional regulators rather
  than enzyme inhibitors. EETs also up-regulate StARD1 gene expression in the presence
  of elevated cAMP levels. The StARD1 gene expression leads to an acute increase in
  steroid/neurosteroid synthesis, which then results in analgesia through an agonistic
  activity on GABA channels. This results in analgesia in both inflammatory and neuropathic
  pain states. Paradoxically, COX2 that is repressed by EETs is responsible for producing
  prostaglandins that through EP receptor activation lead to a rapid rise in intracellular
  cAMP levels, which appear important for EET-mediated analgesia. The dashed arrows
  indicate the novel, hypothesized steps in this cascade.
