caption: Schematic illustration of the main hedgehog (Hh) pathway components. The
  Hh pathway is activated when Sonic Hh ligand binds to the Patched 1 (PTCH1) membrane
  receptor, thereby relieving the inhibitory effect of PTCH1 on Smoothened (SMO).
  Activated SMO is released into the cytoplasm and accumulates in the primary cilium,
  which, in turn, facilitates the dissociation of the glioma-associated oncogene (GLI)
  transcription factors from suppressor of fused (SUFU). The GLI transcription activators
  translocate to the nucleus, where they promote the transcription of Hh target genes,
  including GLI1, PTCH1, snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAIL), snail family
  transcriptional repressor 3 (SNAI3), and cyclin D1.
