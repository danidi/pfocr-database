caption: Proposed SPB duplication pathway, showing the requirement for CDC37 function
  in timing and execution of this event (adapted from ). CDC28 and MPS1 act at nearly
  the same time in the early stages of duplication. The cdc37-1 mutant phenotype may
  result from effects on both kinases, and CDC37 might also affect CDC28 function
  later in the cell cycle. The “+” signs indicate both genetic and biochemical links
  but do not necessarily imply physical interaction between the gene products. Note
  that the requirement for CDC37 function in SPB duplication occurs later than the
  requirement for CDC37 in the execution of Start. The aberrant SPB structures in
  mps2 and cdc37 strains are shown branching off from the pathway at the same point.
  Because mps2 cdc37 double mutant strains display a synthetic phenotype rather than
  a clear epistatic relationship, the execution points of these two genes cannot be
  ordered relative to one another.
