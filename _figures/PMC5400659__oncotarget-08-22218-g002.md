caption: In synthetic lethality two different pathways participate to sustain a cellular
  function. In the case shown in the figure, single strand DNA repair is accomplished
  by the action of PARP. In case the lesion progresses to a double strand break, it
  can be repaired by the action of BRCA1. In case one of the pathways is impaired
  (e. gr. by loss of function of BRCA1), the cellular function is still supported
  by the action of the other pathway. An alteration in a base, or a single strand
  break is usually repaired by the base excision repair mechanism, in which PARP proteins
  play an essential role. If inhibitors of PARP are used, then the single strand alteration
  may evolve to double strand breaks. The repair of lesions depends on the integrity
  of BRCA proteins. In patients whose tumors are defective in BRCA activity, the PARP
  inhibitors create DNA double strand breaks that are not repaired, leading to cell
  death.
