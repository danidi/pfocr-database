caption: Signal transduction pathways and transcriptional regulators affecting the
  filamentous growth of dimorphic pathopoiesis fungus in response to environmental
  conditions, which were reconstructed based on the predicted morphological shift
  in C. albicans [, , , ]. The red and blue colors highlight the homologous genes
  significantly up- and down-regulated in T. cutaneum B3. Genes related to hyphae
  development might be activated by the transcription factor CPH1 thought the CEK1
  MAPK pathway (MAPKK kinase CST20 and MAPK kinase HST7) or other two MAPK pathways
  through kinase MKC1 and HOG1. Oxidative and osmotic stresses are sensed by a two-component
  system with sensing proteins SLN1 and SSK1, which in turn suppress kinases SSK2
  and PBS2 to trigger the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathways. Nitrogen starvation
  is sensed by RHB1, a homologs of the small G protein RHEB with the RAS superfamily,
  which in turn activates the protein kinase PKC1 and MAPK kinase MKC1 in the MKC1
  MAPK pathways. MEP2, a methylamine permease, may also sense nitrogen starvation
  to activate both the MAPK pathway and the cAMP-PKA pathway. Adenylyl cyclase (CYR1)
  not only responds to RAS1/RAS2 under nitrogen starvation condition, it is also activated
  in response to G-protein GPR1, which are activated by glucose deficiency and the
  presence of methionine. Protein kinase A (PKA) comprises of regulatory (BCY) and
  catalytic subunits (TPK), and TPK suppresses the transcription factor RGT1 and in
  turn suppresses the expression of hyphal-inducing genes
