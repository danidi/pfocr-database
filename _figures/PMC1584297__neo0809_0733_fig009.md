caption: Proposed mechanism of cross-talk between the NFκB and the STAT3 pathways.
  Constitutive activation of NFκB leads to the production and secretion of cytokines
  such as IL-6, which acts on the gp130 cytokine receptor family in an autocrine/paracrine
  manner and causes the consequent activation of STAT3 in an EGFR-independent fashion.
  Inhibition of NFκB by IκB S32/36A diminishes the secretion of those molecules, thereby
  blocking the activation of the STA T3 pathway.
