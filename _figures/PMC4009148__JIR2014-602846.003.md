caption: Signaling mechanism of IL-17F expression in bronchial epithelial cells. Bronchial
  epithelial cells are a novel cell source of IL-17F. The expression of IL-17F is
  induced by IL-33. IL-33 binds to its receptor, ST2, and then the ERK1/2-MSK1 signaling
  pathway is activated. However, other stimuli inducing IL-17F and their signaling
  pathways are largely unknown.
