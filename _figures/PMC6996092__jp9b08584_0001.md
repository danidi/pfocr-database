caption: Schematic illustration of streaming effects in response to a pressure-driven
  flow in a channel with negatively charged walls. (a) If an external low-resistance
  electrical pathway exists, here represented by two reference electrodes and an ammeter,
  an uncompensated streaming current istr flows along the channel. (b) If no external
  pathway exists, charge accumulates at the inlet and outlet and a streaming potential
  develops across the channel that can be measured externally. The streaming potential
  drives a reverse migration current through the channel (the backflow current, iback)
  that cancels the streaming current. More complex situations arise when electrodes
  are present in the channel since streaming potentials can drive electrochemical
  reactions while streaming currents can compensate for ohmic drops by carrying (parts
  of) the faradaic currents.
