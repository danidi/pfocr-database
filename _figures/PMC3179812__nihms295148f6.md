caption: The binding of HA to CD44 (step 1) promotes a complex formation between Nanog/Stat-3
  (also tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3, p-Stat-3) and CD44 (step 2). Both Nanog and
  Stat-3 (p-Stat-3) then translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus and interacts
  with the Stat-3-binding sites located at the upstream promoter/enhancer region of
  miR-21 (step 4), resulting in miR-21 gene expression and mature miR-21 production
  (step 5). The resultant miR-21 then functions to downregulate the tumor suppressor
  protein (PDCD4) (step 6a, indicated by the arrow with solid lines) and promote HNSCC
  activation leading to IAP (c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2 and XIAP) expression, HNSCC cell anti-apoptosis/survival
  and chemoresistance (step 7a, indicated by the arrow with solid lines).In direct
  contrast, treatment of HNSCC cells with an anti-miR-21 inhibitor induces tumor suppressor
  protein (PDCD4) upregulation (step 6b, indicated by the arrow with dash lines).
  Subsequently, these changes result in HNSCC cell inactivation including inhibition
  of IAP (c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2 and XIAP) expression (Fig. 7b, indicated by the arrow with
  dash lines), stimulation of apoptosis and enhancement of chemosensitivity in HNSCC
  cells. This newly-discovered Nanog/Stat-3 signaling pathway leading to miR-21 functioning
  should provide important drug targets for sensitizing tumor cell apoptosis and overcome
  chemoresistance in HA/CD44-activated head and neck cancer cells.
