caption: 'PLB regulates cell cycle at G2/M checkpoint in SCC25 cells.Notes: SCC25
  cells were treated with 5 μM PLB for 24 hours and the protein samples were subject
  to quantitative proteomic analysis. Red indicates upregulation; green indicates
  a downregulation. The intensity of green and red molecule colors indicates the degree
  of down- or upregulation, respectively. Solid arrows indicate direct interaction.Abbreviations:
  PLB, plumbagin; UV, ultraviolet.'
