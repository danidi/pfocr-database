caption: Model for the role of Bur1-Bur2 in the DNA replication stress response. During
  S phase, stalled replication forks expose ssDNA, which is recognized by RPA. Stalled
  replication forks are transiently stabilized by the Mec1-dependent S phase checkpoint,
  which suppresses untimely initiation of homologous recombination at the replication
  fork. In the absence of MEC1, stalled replication forks collapse, and the Rad52
  recombination protein is recruited as evidenced by the formation of Rad52 foci.
  Both the Rad52 and Mec1 pathways are controlled by RPA. Mutation of BUR1 leads to
  an increase in Rad52 foci during replication stress, suggesting that the Bur1-Bur2
  complex contributes to stabilization of stalled replication forks. The suppression
  of Δmec1 HU sensitivity by bur1 mutation indicates that Bur1 directs stalled replication
  forks down the Mec1-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the synergistic MMS sensitivity
  of bur1 mutations with Δrad52, Δxrs2, and Δmec1 indicates that Bur1 also plays a
  role in directing repair of MMS-induced lesion by the base/nucleotide excision repair
  (BER/NER) pathways rather than by homologous recombination.
