caption: Regulation of the FoxO1/3 activity by phosphorylation. FoxO transcription
  factors, including FoxO1/3, are tightly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
  events. Upon insulin stimulation, AKT is activated by the upstream signaling pathway
  IR → IRS → PI3K → PDK1/mTORC2. The activated AKT kinase regulates numerous target
  proteins including FoxO1 and FoxO3a through phosphorylation. The Akt phosphorylation
  of FoxOs, especially at Ser256 (FoxO1) and Ser253 (FoxO3a), is inhibitory. Phosphorylated
  FoxOs are subject to binding with 14-3-3 scaffold proteins and nuclear exclusion.
  When SCP4 has access to phosphorylated FoxO1/3a (Ser256/Ser253) that are not bound
  by 14-3-3, FoxO1/3a can be dephosphorylated and reactivated in the nucleus. As a
  result, hepatic gluconeogenic genes, including PEPCK and G6PC, are induced. It is
  also expected that other FoxO-regulated processes are activated by SCP4 as well.
