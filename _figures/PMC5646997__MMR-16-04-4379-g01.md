caption: Schematic representation of the effects of glutamate excitotoxicity, energy
  metabolism deficiency and axonopathy in ALS pathogenesis. Dysfunction of glial cells
  results in the decreased expression of glutamate transporters, including GLT-1 and
  GLAST, leading to glutamate excitotoxicity. Although excitotoxicity can induce axonopathy
  and neuronal degeneration, interventions aimed at increasing BDNF production can
  attenuate excitotoxicity, enhance axonal repair and regrowth and eventually ameliorate
  the degeneration of motor neurons. Furthermore, glial cell dysfunction results in
  the downregulation of MCTs, thus impairing the axonal energy supply, which leads
  to axon loss and motor neuron degeneration. The BDNF signaling pathway is also implicated
  in MCT expression; however, further studies are required to investigate the molecular
  mechanisms that are involved. In addition, class 3 semaphorins are involved in oligodendroglial
  migration, and their dysregulation is implicated in remyelination impairments and
  axonopathy. ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; GLT, glutamate transporter; GLAST,
  glutamate aspartate transporter; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; MCT, monocarboxylate
  transporter; Sema, semaphorin.
