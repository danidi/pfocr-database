caption: The wnt signaling pathway. Wnts bind to their frizzled receptors (FZ) and
  coreceptors LRP in the membrane. This binding can be blocked by dickkopf (Dkk) or
  soluble frizzled related proteins (sFRP). Activation of FZ by wnt results in phosphorylation
  of disheveled (Dvl) which induces the disruption of the axin/APC/GSK-3β complex
  and recruitment of axin to the membrane. When active, this complex phosphorylates
  β-catenin, leading to its proteosomal degradation. However, following wnt stimulation,
  β-catenin is no longer degraded and can enter the nucleus, where in combination
  with members of the LEF/TCF family, it can induce expression of its target genes
  such as cyclin D1. β-Catenin also binds to the E-cadherin complex in the plasma
  membrane, a complex stabilized by calcium, where it may play a role in differentiation.
