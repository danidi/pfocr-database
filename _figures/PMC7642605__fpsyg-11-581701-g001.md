caption: Possible pathway to understanding sociochemistry using machine learning (ML).
  The different steps denote past/present (Step 1 and 2) and proposed (Step 3) approaches
  to elucidate human social communication via smell. The steps are increasingly data-intense
  and complex and go from uni- to multidisciplinary research. Although there is no
  strict order, Step 1 and 2 can form initial building blocks for sociochemistry (Step
  3), by testing psychological correspondence between senders and receivers in traditional
  ways (Step 1; chemical medium “remains” black box); and by decoding psychological/clinical
  information from the sender’s smell (Step 2; the receiver’s response and therefore
  the social chemosignal remains “black box”). Controlling for various factors (e.g.,
  genotype, culture, gender, hygiene, diet) is recommended here to initially isolate
  the signal and/or its psychological effect. However, true chemical communication
  (e.g., of emotions like fear) involves (i) studying behavioral/physiological/brain
  response patterns in senders and receivers, while (ii) identifying the molecules
  that link two humans (i.e., the social (chemo)signal in human-human interaction),
  (iii) under ecologically valid conditions (i.e., including “noise” factors like
  dietary and hygiene habits) (Step 3), to eventually develop artificial intelligence-based
  sensors that could be applied in the real world for senders (e.g., diagnosis) and
  receivers (e.g., facilitating well-being by blocking the signals from entering the
  nose). This is an example of fear chemosignaling (vs. neutral), using faces obtained
  from the Radboud Faces Database ().
