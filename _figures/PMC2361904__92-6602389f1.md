caption: The figure shows the proposed mechanisms by which we hypothesise that absence
  of the IGF1 19-repeat allele in combination with hormone exposure would increase
  the breast volume and the risk of early-onset breast cancer. References to the steps
  that have been previously explored are indicted. The risk of early-onset breast
  cancer after hormone exposure may be partially modified through the IGF-1 pathway.
