caption: Two parallel pathways are required for Abl-dependent cell detachment. Activation
  of Abl kinase by ephrin-A1 disrupts the CrkII–C3G complex to lower the levels of
  Rap1-GTP and thus reduces the affinity of β1 integrin. In parallel, serum factors
  such as LPA strongly activate the Rho–ROCK1 pathway to stimulate cellular contractility.
  The combination of a reduced level of cell adhesion and a high level of cellular
  contractility causes cell detachment from the extracellular matrix.
