caption: Driver genetic lesions in papillary thyroid carcinoma. In both panels, colored
  and gray proteins indicate activated or non-activated proteins, respectively. Line
  thickness is proportional to the extent of activation. (A) As depicted, BRAF exerts
  its activity via MEK1 and MEK2 proteins, which in turn activate ERK1 and ERK2. Activated
  proteins translocate into the nucleus where activate distinct nuclear transcription
  factors, enhancing gene transcription. BRAFV600E mutation, common in PTCs as well
  as other epithelial-derived tumors, leads to the constitutive activation of BRAF
  protein, which leads to the hyper-activation of downstream effectors of the MAPK
  pathway, as well as to non-responsiveness to ERK inhibitory feedback on BRAF itself.
  PTC patients with RET gene fusions (namely RET/PTC) show a phenotype - and a gene
  expression profile - that is similar to BRAFV600E PTCs. (B) RAS protein(s) operates
  upstream the MAPK and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specific somatic
  mutations in RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS and NRAS) maintain RAS protein in a constitutive
  active state. Such hyper-activation mediates its cellular effects either by the
  activation of the MAPK cascade and the PI3K pathway, while PAX8-PPARg gene fusion
  leads to the inhibition of the PTEN inhibitory effect and to the activation of PI3K
  signaling. Modified from Pathway Central (Qiagen).
