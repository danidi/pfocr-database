caption: The NER pathway. (A) During GG-NER, a helix-distorting lesion (yellow star)
  is recognized by Rad4-Rad23-Rad33 and Rad7-Rad16 complexes. Rad7-Rad16-Abf1 has
  chromatin-remodeling activity, whereas Rad7-Rad16-Elc1-Cul3-E2 has Ub ligase activity,
  which modifies Rad4 and additional factors (“X”). These reactions allow efficient
  recognition of lesions by Rad4, its proper positioning, and opening of the helix
  ∼10 bp. (B) TFIIH (components are in blue), Rad14, and RPA are recruited to form
  a pre-incision complex that verifies the lesion and further unwinds DNA. Rad4-Rad23-Rad33
  and Rad7-Rad16-Abf1 are released. (C) The structure-specific endonucleases Rad1-Rad10
  and Rad2 are positioned to incise 5′ and 3′ of the lesion, respectively. (D) A lesion-containing
  oligonucleotide (25–30 nt) is released from the duplex, followed by repair synthesis
  and ligation.
