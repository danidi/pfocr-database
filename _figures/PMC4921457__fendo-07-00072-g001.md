caption: 'Mechanisms responsible for aldosterone synthesis in zona glomerulosa cells
  under normal physiological conditions and excess production in primary aldosteronism.
  The strongly negative resting membrane potential of zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells
  under resting physiological conditions is maintained by the concentration gradient
  of K+ between the intracellular and extracellular space, which is generated by the
  activity of the Na+, K+-ATPase. Angiotensin II and increased K+ lead to cell membrane
  depolarization, which opens voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, Angiostensin
  II acts through the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) inducing Ca2+ release
  from the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, the increase in intracellular Ca2+
  concentration activates the calcium signaling pathway, which triggers activation
  of CYP11B2 transcription. The role for ACTH in the regulation of aldosterone secretion
  whether in normal physiology or in PA is in part determined by the level of expression
  of ACTH receptors (MC2R) in ZG cells. MC2R which is a GPCR coupled to the stimulatory
  Gsα subunit may induce an increase of intracellular cAMP concentration which activates
  protein kinase A thereby increasing CREB phosphorylation and CYP11B2 transcription.
  Aberrant expression of other GPCR may also be responsible for aldosterone excess
  despite a suppressed renin angiotensin system: eutopic GPCR include those for serotonin
  (5-HT4R); ectopic GPCR include those for glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide
  (GIPR), luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (LH–hCG R), β-adrenergic
  receptors (β-AR), vasopressin (V1-AVPR) glucagon (glucagon receptor), TRH (TRH R),
  and Endothelin-1 ETA and ETB receptors. Other mechanisms implicated in PA involve
  somatic and germline mutations in ion channels genes regulating intracellular ionic
  homeostasis and cell membrane potentials: increase intracellular Na+ concentrations
  and cell membrane depolarization result from KCNJ5 gain-of-function mutations affecting
  GIRK4 and ATP1A1 mutations of the Na+, K+-ATPase. Direct increase of intracellular
  Ca2+ concentrations could also result from mutations in ATP2B3 encoding for the
  plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, mutations in CACNA1D affecting the Cav1.3 subunit of
  the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel or CACNA1H affecting the Cav3.2 subunit
  of the voltage-gated calcium channel. Finally dysregulation in cellular proliferation/apoptosis
  accelerating adenoma formation could be due either to activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway or to gene mutations such as ARMC5 although the mechanism of the latter
  mutation is not fully elucidated.'
