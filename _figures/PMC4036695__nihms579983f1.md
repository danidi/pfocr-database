caption: A model for nutrient signaling, acetate-dependent acetyl-CoA synthesis, epigenetic
  modifications, autophagy, and longevity. In yeast acetyl-CoA is produced through
  the mitochondrial pathways (Ach1 or Mpc1 dependent) and through the Acs2-dependent
  nucleo-cytoplasmic pathway. The hyper-activation of the Acs2-pathway by high levels
  of acetate results in increased levels of nucleo-cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA, which,
  in turn, leads to hyperacetylation of histones, reduced expression of ATG genes,
  autophagy inhibition, and shortened lifespan. However, relatively high levels of
  ketone bodies are associated with longevity extension in mutants lacking Tor-Sch9
  or Ras-PKA signaling, indicating that, similarly to ketone bodies, this carbon source
  can promote either toxic or protective effects depending on the signaling state
  of cell. In this model, solid arrows indicate known pathways while dashed arrows
  indicate putative pathways based on current knowledge.
