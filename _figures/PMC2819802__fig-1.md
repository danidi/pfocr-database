caption: Activation of apoptotic and survival pathways by TNF. The pleiotropic biologic
  effects of TNF can be attributed to its ability to activate apoptotic and survival
  pathways simultaneously. The apoptotic pathway is initialized by the formation of
  complex I, which is eventually internalized to form complex II. Complex II activates
  caspase-8, which cleaves Bid to tBid, which translocates to mitochondria and permeabilizes
  the mitochondrial outer membrane to allow cytochrome c release and possibly to increase
  mitochondrial ROS generation. The newly released cytochrome c can further activate
  other caspases, which can target mitochondria, leading to a positive-feedback loop,
  resulting in extensive caspase activation and ROS generation and ultimately apoptosis.
  TRAF-2 in complex I also activates the MAP kinase cascade [ASK-1, MKK4/7 (not shown)],
  leading to the activation of JNK, important in mediating apoptosis in some cells.
  After activation, JNK translocates to mitochondria and promotes cytochrome c release,
  mitochondrial permeability transition, and possibly increased ROS generation. Because
  JNK can be activated by ROS, a positive-feedback loop may ensue in which JNK translocation
  to mitochondria causes increased ROS generation, which activates more JNK molecules.
  The survival pathway is mediated by NF-κB transcription of survival genes that block
  many proteins involved in apoptosis. Complex I will activate IKK, which phosphorylates
  IκB-α, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. The degradation of IκB-α releases
  NF-κB, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and promote transcription of
  survival genes. Consequently, the transcription of NF-κB–regulated proteins, not
  apoptosis, is the major response to TNF in hepatocytes and other primary cells,
  under normal conditions.
