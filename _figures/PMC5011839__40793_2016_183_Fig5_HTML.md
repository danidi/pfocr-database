caption: The proposed methanogenesis pathway in ISO4-H5 growing with hydrogen and
  methanol, mono-, di-, tri-methylamine, or methyl-3-methylthiopropionate. Two methyl
  groups are needed from the methyl donors for every two methane formed. Methyl groups
  from methanol (MeOH), monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine
  (TMA) and methyl-3-methylthiopropionate (M3MTP) are transferred onto methyl-binding
  corrinoid proteins CH3-MtaC, CH3-MtmC, CH3-MtbC, CH3-MttC and CH3-MtsB by specific
  corrinoid methyl transferases MtaB, MtmB, MtbB, MttB and MtsA respectively. The
  methyl groups are then transferred from the corrinoid proteins to CoM by CoM methyltransferase
  MtaA, MtmA, and bifunctional MtsA. Methyl-CoM is reduced to methane by the methyl
  coenzyme M reductase Mrt complex with cofactor HS-CoB. Heterodisulfide reductase
  complex Hdr and hydrogenase complex Mvh couple electron bifurcation to cofactor
  regeneration, and are coupled to the Fpo-like complex to generate a membrane potential
  for ATP production. The H+ (or Na+) ratio to ATP is not known, and the reconstruction
  of the pathway is based on the schemes proposed by Lang et al. []. The presence
  or absence of each gene or the complete pathway for coenzyme M synthesis, in members
  of Methanomassiliicoccales is highlighted by colored circles; a white circle indicates
  absence in a genome. The fpoF and fpoO genes that are not found in members of Methanomassiliicoccales
  but exist in M. barkeri are represented by dotted red circles in the Fpo-like complex
