caption: Schematic representation of Wnt pathway involved in the osteogenic and adipogenic
  differentiation of huAFMSCs. Our paper demonstrates that osteogenic commitment of
  these cells is linked to the stimulation of Wnt signal leading to the final transcriptional
  activation of early osteogenic markers such as RUNX-2 and ALP, mediated by β-catenin.
  DKK1 is a secreted Wnt antagonist that may be used as a drug to inhibit Wnt signal.
  In contrast, adipogenic commitment involves early inhibition of Wnt pathway leading
  to ubiquitination/degradation of β-catenin. This results in the transcription of
  PPARγ and FABP4, considered as the main initiators of adipogenesis. APC, adenomatous
  polyposis coli; βcat, β-catenin; CK1, casein kinase 1; DKK1, dickkopf 1; Dvl, Dishevelled;
  GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; LRP5/6, low density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5/6
