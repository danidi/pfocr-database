caption: Molecular pathways involved in pancreas and liver differentiation from hES
  cells. Four main pathways regulate the early stages of pancreas differentiation
  from definitive endoderm and control the acquisition of hepatic vs. pancreatic fate.
  Hedgehog signaling is well characterized as a potent inhibitor of pancreatic initiation
  (a) that is expressed in the hepatic domain (b) under the influence of FGF signaling.
  It functions in the establishment of organ domains. This pathway can be blocked
  by treatment with the alkaloid cyclopamine. Retinoic acid is expressed in the developing
  pancreas and participates in the induction of PDX1 expression (c). It is also suggested
  to contribute to hepatic gene expression to a certain degree (d). An inhibitory
  effect of retinoic acid on Smad1-5-8 phosphorylation (e) was demonstrated on hES-derived
  definitive endoderm seeded at low density, which contrasts with the early studies
  indicating activation of BMP signaling by retinoic acid. BMP is well described as
  an inhibitor of early pancreas development (f) in contrast to its requirement for
  hepatic initiation (g). This potent inhibitory effect at early stages gets reverted
  afterward and pancreatic progenitors require BMP signaling (f). The inhibition of
  BMP signaling in the pancreatic domain is under the control of Noggin (h). As for
  BMP pathway, FGF signaling via ERK/MAPK also controls early pancreas induction with
  high concentration being inhibitory (i) whereas low concentrations are required
  (j). In late stages, FGF plays in the proliferation of pancreas progenitors (j).
  On the contrary, this pathway represents an amplification signal (h) for the ALB+AFP+
  hepatoblast. The markers displayed in the progenitors recall the current status
  of protein detection from differentiated hES cells.
