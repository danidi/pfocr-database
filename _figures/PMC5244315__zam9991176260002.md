caption: Part of the metabolism of M. extorquens AM1, including the oxidation of methanol,
  the serine cycle, and the ethylmalonyl-CoA (EMC) pathway overlapping the PHB pathway.
  The conversion of (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA into PHB or 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA by
  heterologously expressed (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA-specific coenzyme B12-dependent
  mutase is indicated. MxaF, methanol dehydrogenase; H4F, tetrahydrofolate; H4MPT,
  tetrahydromethanopterin; MtdB, methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase; MtdA, methylene-H4F
  dehydrogenase; FDH, formate dehydrogenase; GlyA, serine hydroxymethyl transferase;
  PhaA, beta-ketothiolase; PhaB, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; CroR, crotonase; ECM,
  ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase; MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; PhaC, PHB synthase; RcmAB,
  (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA-specific mutase; MeaH, G protein chaperone associated with
  RcmAB; TCC, tricarboxylic acid cycle; QH2, reduced quinone; cyt c (red), reduced
  cytochrome c.
