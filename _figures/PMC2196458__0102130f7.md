caption: Schematic representation of the relevant components of the Fas-signaling
  pathways in relation to the cytoskeletal networks, the Golgi-sorting compartment,
  and the surface membrane. In simple epithelial cells like hepatocytes K8/K18, IFs
  and fibrillar actin (FA) are largely localized underneath the surface membrane,
  whereas microtubules (MT) extend throughout the cytoplasm. The Golgi compartment
  (GC), next to the nucleus (N) and the endoplasmic reticulum (not shown), is involved
  in the sorting out of the newly synthesized receptors, such as Fas and EGF Receptor
  (EGFR), before their targeting to appropriate membrane portions, via a microtubule-dependent
  process. A look at the steps of Fas-mediated apoptosis indicates that, once the
  receptor has properly reached the surface membrane, the intensity of the Fas activation
  becomes dependent on the density of the receptor and on its degree of clustering,
  an actin-dependent process. Stimulation by FasL leads to Fas trimerization and death-inducing
  signaling complex formation, which in turn can activate two distinct caspase-signaling
  pathways classified as type I and type II, respectively. Hepatocytes correspond
  to type II cells, and accordingly, a large part of the death signaling occurs via
  the release of cytochrome C (Cyto C) and subsequently the activation of procaspase-9,
  and so on. EGF provides protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis via an activation
  of the Akt pathway that leads to the inhibition of caspase-9. c-FLIP, a labile protective
  protein homologous to caspase but exhibiting an inactive catalytic site, regulates
  death receptor–mediated apoptosis. Significantly, the results reported here suggest
  that K8/K18 largely modulate the Fas density at the hepatocyte surface, in a manner
  that depends on the participation of microtubules. This dynamic interplay may involve
  a contribution of plectin, a known integrator of the cytoskeletal networks in many
  cell types.
