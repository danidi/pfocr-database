caption: Ghrelin signaling and cancer anorexia–cachexia. Hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing
  factor (CRF) neurons are activated by cytokines through serotonin (5-HT) and the
  5-HT 2c receptor (5-HT2cR), which shows functional divergence. Our data demonstrate
  the existence of a novel 5-HT-CRF neuronal pathway that inhibits ghrelin secretion
  and has a pathogenetic role in cancer anorexia–cachexia syndrome. The traditional
  herbal medicine rikkunshito improves anorexia, weight loss, gastrointestinal (GI)
  dysmotility, anxiety-related behavior and survival. Rikkunshito and its active component
  hesperidin stimulate ghrelin secretion from stomach by interrupting this 5-HT-CRF
  pathway via 5-HT2cR antagonism. Another active component atractylodin potentiates
  the action of ghrelin by presumably allosterically sensitizing the GHS-R on the
  vagal afferent terminals of stomach or neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons of the hypothalamic
  arcuate nucleus (ARC). The 5-HT2cR antagonist improved anorexia–cachexia in the
  short term, but failed to improve survival. Thus, both the release of ghrelin and
  the potentiation of ghrelin/GHS-R signaling are important for mitigating ghrelin
  insufficiency and resistance, which are characteristics of cancer anorexia–cachexia
  syndrome.
