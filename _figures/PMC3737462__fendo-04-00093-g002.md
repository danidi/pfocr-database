caption: 'Accumulation of monocytes/macrophages in adipose tissue and liver, and activation
  in the tissues. Trafficking: During obesity, adipocytes exhibit hypertrophy, while
  liver incorporates substantial FFAs, both of which cause tissue inflammation, activation
  of NF-κB, and AP1 signaling, leading to increased secretion of inflammatory chemokines
  and cytokines, including CCLs and TNFα. Elevated secretion of CCLs (e.g., MCP-1)
  elicits the accumulation of CCR-positive monocytes to the site of inflammation,
  particularly CCR2+ for adipose and liver, but CCR5+ for adipose tissue. In situ
  activation: In a lean state, resident tissue macrophages display the M2 phenotype,
  which is achieved and sustained through the JAK/STAT6 pathway in response to IL-4
  or IL-13 stimuli. These stimuli are derived from resident TH2 cells, Treg cells,
  eosinophils, and mast cells. PPARs and KLF4 also induce M2 activation. In turn,
  obesity and subsequent elevation of tissue FFA or inflammatory cytokines stimulate
  NF-κB and AP1 signaling, which causes switching of the phenotype to M1, leading
  to further secretion of TNFα. Signal from inflammasome also activates M1 activation.
  M1 activation of macrophages can be suppressed by endothelial NO/cGMP signaling.
  M2 macrophages contribute to insulin sensitivity in neighboring parenchymal cells,
  while M1 induces insulin resistance, with the M1/M2 balance determining tissue and/or
  systemic insulin sensitivity.'
