caption: Pathway analysis tools can use biological knowledge to focus the number of
  genetic markers for association analysis from millions of potential variants to
  a few thousand tightly focused on the trait under study. The initial hypothesis,
  based upon a known gene and/or a biological process, forms the basis for selecting
  Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), which are used to mine both the published literature
  and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) databases. This list is supplemented
  with genes that are differentially expressed in the setting of the tissue or trait
  of interest identified from analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray
  datasets. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING)
  facilitates this process by identifying likely pathway-related genes based on a
  wide array of knowledge-based interrelationships, including protein interaction,
  known co-regulation, and comparative genomics. These data-mining steps serve to
  generate a primary list of genes deemed biologically relevant to the trait under
  study. Analysis of pathway relationships further builds out the gene list as well
  as stratifies the gene list by identifying molecular relationships and key partners.
  All genetic markers present on fixed genotype platforms that are also contained
  within or nearby pathway genes (e.g., in upstream or downstream regulatory sequences)
  are then identified. Pathway SNPs that provide similar overall information content
  by virtue of being in high LD are removed to focus the list of markers and reduce
  the overall testing penalty. Finally, the refined list of Pathway SNPs is used to
  test genotype-phenotype associations in novel or dbGAP-derived datasets. ENG, endoglin;
  TGFB1, transforming growth factor–beta 1; DPM1, dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase
  polypeptide 1; GCLC, glutamate-cysteine ligase; TNMD, tenomodulin; TSPAN6, tetraspanin
