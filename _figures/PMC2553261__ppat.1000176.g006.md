caption: PFTs at the cell surface of epithelial cells activate p38 MAPK that activates
  IRE-1 that induces splicing of xbp-1, which then turns on defense against PFTs.
  Residual activation of xbp-1 targets in the absence of the p38 MAPK pathway suggests
  there might be p38-independent activation of the ire-1-xbp-1 pathway in response
  to PFT as well (not shown). Independent of IRE-1 activation, p38 MAPK can also activate
  TTM-2 and other PFT defenses. Tunicamycin, which causes the accumulation of unfolded
  proteins in the ER, activates IRE-1 via a mechanism independent of the PFT and p38
  MAPK.
