caption: Potential pathways involved in the rapid antidepressant effects of nitrous
  oxide. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase is localized to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
  by the PDZ-domain adapter protein postsynaptic density protein 95. Nitric oxide
  (NO) acts intracellularly through different mechanisms such as nitrosylation and
  denitrification. The role of the NO pathway in neuroprotection has also been associated
  with decreased calcium influx and consequent inhibition of cell death, also increasing
  downstream neuroprotective proteins such as protein kinase B, cyclic AMP response
  element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and activity-regulated
  cytoskeleton-associated protein. NO diffuses into adjacent cells, where it activates
  guanylyl cyclase and long-term potentiation of protein kinase G, controls blood
  flow and neuronal transmission, and regulates pain (and possibly mood). The NO pathway
  plays a key role in cellular resilience, and NO and nitrous oxide have dual concentration-dependent
  effects. Physiologic levels induce plasticity, and higher concentrations activate
  lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. The reactions of nitrification
  and denitrification involve electron transport systems and are linked to cellular
  energetics and adenosine triphosphate production. Arc, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated
