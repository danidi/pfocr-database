caption: 'Modulation of host AKT pathway by L. donovani for successful survival. L.
  donovani activates host AKT by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues,
  which in turn imparts a dual effect on the downstream signaling pathway: 1. Inactivation
  of GSK-3β by phosphorylation at Ser9 residue resulting in inhibition of Ser33/37
  phosphorylation-mediated degradation of β-catenin and 2. Phosphorylation of β-catenin
  at Ser552 leading to its nuclear localization with concomitant inactivation of FOXO-1
  by phosphorylation at Ser256 causing its cytosolic translocation. Overall these
  effects help parasite survival by inhibiting host cell apoptosis on one hand and
  modulating inflammatory responses on the other'
