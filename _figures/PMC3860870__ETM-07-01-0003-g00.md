caption: 'Modulation of apoptosis by HPV early proteins: A number of the interactions
  of viral oncoproteins with cellular proteins and their effects on apoptosis. E2
  protein is able to induce apoptosis by downregulating the transcription of E6/E7
  mRNA and by binding with p53, respectively. E5 impairs the formation of the death-inducing
  signaling complex triggered by FasL and TRAIL. E6 protein inhibits apoptosis by
  targeting proapoptotic proteins, including p53 and Bax, for proteolytic degradation.
  E6 protein also protects cells from death receptor-induced apoptosis by blocking
  apoptotic signal transduction and inducing the expression of IAPs. E7 oncoprotein-expressing
  cells are usually predisposed to undergo apoptosis, in part due to degradation of
  the antiapoptotic protein pRb and E2F-1 binding. Downwards arrow, degradation of
  cellular proteins; inhibition arrow, inhibition status of the pathway; upwards arrow,
  upregulation of proteins. HPV, human papillomavirus; FasL, Fas ligand; TNF, tumor
  necrosis factor; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; IAP, inhibitor of
  apoptosis; TNFR, TNF receptor; FADD, Fas-associated protein with death domain.'
