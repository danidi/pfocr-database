caption: Schematic diagram of the possible regulation network of miR-21-induced glioma
  cell migration and invasion. miR-21 was upregulated by HIF-1 under hypoxia and miR-21,
  in turn, activating the Sox2 and β-catenin signaling pathway, which resulted in
  the high migration and invasion potential of glioma cells. HIF, hypoxia-inducible
  factor; HRE, hormone response element; miR, microRNA; Sox2, SRY-box 2.

  of Sox2 and β-catenin signaling.
