caption: Schematic model of NMDAR-mediated signaling in GBM cells. GBM cells secrete
  Glu via the Glu/Cyss co-transporter system Xc−. Glu activates NMDARs, which mediate
  Ca2+ influx into the cell. The increased Ca2+ concentration leads to the activation
  of the cAMP-responsive element binding transcription factor (CREB) at the enhancer/promoter
  region of the early response genes (cFos), probably via the phosphorylation of Ser133
  by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) or the MEK-MAPK pathway. Top2β
  is enriched at CREB binding sites [] and activated by Ca2+ (or via an unknown signaling
  pathway, or both) indicating an overlap of Top2β activity with CREB-mediated gene
  regulation. Upon activation, Top2β induces a DSB in the promoter region of the cFos
  gene, reducing the topological constraints of the DNA, which allows the pausing
  of Pol II to start transcription. Finally, the expression of cFos improves the survival
  and radio resistance of GBM cells.
