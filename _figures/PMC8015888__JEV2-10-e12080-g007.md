caption: Model of immune detection, inflammatory signaling and intracellular fate
  of MVs produced by Gram‐positive bacteria. MVs produced by Gram‐positive bacteria
  can interact with PRRs expressed on the surface of epithelial cells. Interaction
  of S. aureus MVs with epithelial cells results in the activation of TLR2 located
  at the host cell surface. Furthermore, upon entry into host epithelial cells, MV‐associated
  RNA, DNA and peptidoglycan cargo is detected by the endosomal PRRs TLR7, 8 and 9,
  and the cytoplasmic receptor NOD2, respectively. Activation of surface and cytoplasmic
  host PRRs by MV‐associated cargo results in the activation of NF‐κB and the production
  and release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to facilitate pathogenesis
  in the host. Furthermore, intracellular detection of MVs leads to their sequestration
  into autophagosomes and their subsequent degradation via the host cellular degradation
  pathway of autophagy to enable clearance of MVs from host cells.
