caption: Summary of nonenzymatic effects of cell surface tTG on RhoA activity. Activation
  of RhoA by integrin-associated tTG is mediated by formation of integrin clusters
  and down-regulation of the Src-p190RhoGAP signaling pathway. The light, gray, and
  dark ovals, rectangles, and squares for Src, p190RhoGAP, and RhoA reflect their
  relative activities in the order of increase.
