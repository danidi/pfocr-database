caption: 'Data from the present study and from Dendrou and colleagues () suggests
  that the rs12722495IL2RA susceptibility genotype may influence two distinct immunophenotypes:
  less IL-2 production from conventional memory T cells and a reduced sensitivity
  to IL-2 signaling in Tregs resulting in lower levels of pSTAT5a and reduced expression
  levels of FoxP3. We propose that that these two immunophenotypes could act synergistically
  to reduce Treg function.'
