caption: In active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), expression of the
  markers of the alternative pathway of macrophage differentiation parallels expression
  of negative regulators of innate immune responses including SOCS3 and IL-10. SOCS3
  interacts with JAK/STAT signaling pathways leading to decreased responsiveness of
  monocytes/macrophages to IFN-γ. Altered responsiveness to IFN-γ combined with the
  presence of IL-10 may skew differentiation of monocytes towards the scavenger macrophages,
  which exhibit increased phagocytic activity and are CD163+. The presence of cytolytic
  dysfunction in SJIA patients that appears to be caused by both genetic and acquired
  factors may be another contributing factor.
