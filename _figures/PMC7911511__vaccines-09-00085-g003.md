caption: The immunological nature of cancer-germline antigens. The expression of cancer-germline
  antigens (CGAs) is normally limited to reproductive tissues. The presence of the
  blood-testis barrier makes testis an immune-privileged zone, which means CGAs expressed
  in germ cells do not interact with the immune system. Furthermore, due to the lack
  of HLA class I molecules on the surface of germ cells, CGAs cannot be presented
  on their cell surface, making germ cells unrecognizable for CGA-specific immune
  cells. These features make CGAs foreign when exposed to the immune system and endow
  them with a strong capability to induce a robust immune response. Aberrant expression
  of CGAs can be detected in various cancers. These antigens, being expressed in malignant
  cells, will be processed and presented on the surface of malignant cells, including
  the HLA class I pathway. Once recognized by immune cells, CGAs will be targeted
  by the immune system, leading to the destruction of CGA-expressing malignant cells.
