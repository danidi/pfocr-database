caption: The integration of signals from peripheral tissues in the hypothalamus is
  fundamental to the regulation of energy homeostasis. Distinct neuronal populations
  propagate the signaling of various molecules to control food intake and satiety.
  POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus are activated by leptin and insulin and produce
  α-MSH, which then activates the MC4R receptor in the paraventricular nucleus, resulting
  in a satiety signal. The downstream roles of SIM1, BDNF, and TKRB are currently
  being explored. In contrast, a separate group of neurons expressing NPY and AGRP
  produce molecules that act as potent inhibitors of MC4R signaling. A dysfunction
  in these pathways will disrupt energy homeostasis. AGRP, agouti-related protein;
  α-MSH, alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotropic
  factor; GHR, ghrelin receptor; ISR, insulin receptor; LepR, leptin receptor; NPY,
  neuropeptide Y; PC1 and 2, proconvertase 1 and 2; POMC, proopiomelanocortin; SIM1,
  single-minded homolog 1 (Drosophila); TRKB, tyrosine kinase receptor.
