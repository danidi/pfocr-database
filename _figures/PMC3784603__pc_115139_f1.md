caption: Aliphatic and Indolic GS Biosynthetic Pathway in A. thaliana.The biosynthesis
  of Met-derived aliphatic and Trp-derived indolic GSs is depicted. A. thaliana genes
  involved in distinct and common steps are indicated as well as genes involved in
  primary sulfate assimilation. MYB TFs known to regulate the expression of aliphatic-
  or indole- genes are indicated in blue. Genes in red were differentially expressed
  between  and myc234 plants (this study). The figure is adapted from  and .
