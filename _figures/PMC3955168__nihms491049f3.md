caption: The unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and its chemical modulators.
  Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen activate the three UPR signal
  transducers ATF6, PERK and IRE1. This results in the production of transcription
  factors that migrate into the nucleus and activate UPR target genes that cause attenuation
  of protein synthesis and increase both the ER folding-capacity and ER-associated
  degradation.
