caption: The subcellular location of genes in the canonical pathway, termed as “Signaling
  by Rho Family GTPases”, as determined via IPA analysis to compare transcriptomes
  in the APs of pre- and post-ovulation heifers. Note that the IPA software shows
  gene names as normal font and not italics. The solid lines and dotted line indicate
  direct or indirect biological relationship between genes, respectively. The bold
  grey lines indicate the border between the extracellular space, cytoplasm, and nucleus.
  The purple indicates the upregulated genes identified in this experiment. This figure
  includes the results of molecule activity predictor (MAP), and the predicted stimulated
  genes are shown in orange, and the predicted inhibited genes are shown in blue.
  In total, 236 genes constituted the canonical pathway, and 9 of these genes (ACTA2,
  CDH10, ELK1, GNA14, LIMK1, LIMK2, RHOC, SEPT5, and WIPF1) were identified in the
  bovine APs used in this study. In this figure, F-actin represents ACTA2, Cadherin
  represents CDH10, Gα represents GNA14, LIMK represents both LIMK1 and LIMK2, Rho
  represents RHOC, Septin5 represents SEPT5, and WIP represents WIPF1.
