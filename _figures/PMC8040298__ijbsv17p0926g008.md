caption: A proposed model illustrating IR-induced abscopal antitumor effect driven
  by macrophages and T cells. After radiotherapy, the irradiated cells release DAMPs
  to active DC-T cells (blue arrows)  and macrophages (red arrows) which would kill
  tumor cells systematically. HMGB1, one of important DAMPs, promote macrophages to
  secret TNF-α through TLR-4 pathway and further inhibited the proliferation and migration
  of non-irradiated cancer cells by PI3K-p110γ suppression.
