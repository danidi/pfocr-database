caption: Specifically, during microbial infection, HECTD2 (R397) targets PIAS1 for
  its ubiquitination at K30; this process is facilitated by GSK3β phosphorylation
  of PIAS1 at S17. In this pathway, WT HECTD2 potently activates cytokine-driven inflammation,
  whereas we identified a naturally occurring, mislocalized, hypofunctional variant
  of HECTD2 (A19P) that lowers the amount of cytokine secretion. A small-molecule
  HECTD2 inhibitor, BC-1382, decreased inflammation in an animal model of ARDS by
  antagonizing the actions of HECTD2 on PIAS1, allowing PIAS1 to continue to suppress
  cytokine signaling.
