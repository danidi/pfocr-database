caption: The Rho A signalling cascade is often targeted to induce neurite outgrowth
  in vitro. In vitro stem cell–based models of neurite outgrowth have provided an
  opportunity to study the molecular pathways that induce neurite inhibition within
  a variety of neurological disorders. It is now thought that in the glial scar that
  forms following damage to the spinal cord chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs)
  activate Rho A signalling through a receptor-dependent mechanism which ultimately
  results in the activation of downstream Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). Activation
  of this signalling pathway in turn results in the stabilisation of actin filaments
  inducing growth cone collapse and neurite retraction. In vitro neurite outgrowth
  models have allowed for the screening of potential inhibitors of this pathway and
  have resulted in the identification of compounds that can induce recovery of neurite
  growth in an inhibitory environment. These include inhibitors of Rho A such as C3
  transferase and ibuprofen and also inhibitors of ROCK such as Y-27632 and fasudil.
