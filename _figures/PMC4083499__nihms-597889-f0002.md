caption: At least two pathways may be involved in sensing the presence of aggregates
  and directing them to the autophagosome. In the gray pathway, aggregates are sensed
  / bound by HSPB / BAG3 complexes and directed to the autophagosome. In the black
  pathway, aggregates are recognized by the ubiquitin E3 ligase parkin that sees aggregated
  proteins, polyubiquinates them and leads to the formation of the aggresome. Aggresomes
  are translocated to the autophagosome located at the microtubule organizing center
  (MTOC). The polyubiquitin chains on the aggresome are then recognized by p62 which
  interacts with LC3 and triggers autophagy. Responses to stresses such as hyperthermia
  may involve a combination of the two pathways.
