caption: 'Working model of chronic morphine-induced adaptations in ventral tegmental
  area (VTA) dopamine neurons. Chronic morphine decreases VTA dopamine (DA) soma size
  yet increases neuronal excitability, while dopamine transmission to the nucleus
  accumbens is decreased. The net effect of morphine is a less responsive reward pathway,
  ie, reward tolerance. Downregulation of IRS2-AKT signaling in VTA mediates the effects
  of chronic morphine on soma size and electrical excitability; the effect on excitability
  is mediated via decreased γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A currents and suppression of
  K'' channel expression. Morphine-induced downregulation of mTORC2 activity in VTA
  is crucial for these morphine-induced morphological and physiological adaptations
  as well as for reward tolerance. In contrast to mT0RC2, chronic morphine increases
  mTORCI activity, which does not influence these morphine-induced adaptations. BDNF,
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor; IRS, insulin receptor substance; mTORC, mTOR
