caption: Model of vFLIP effect of cellular survival. We propose that vFLIP may inhibit
  apoptosis via a direct mechanism, by disrupting activation of the DISC complex,
  and an indirect pathway by forming part of a signaling complex that induces IKK
  phosphorylation (via an unknown kinase or kinases), IκB degradation, and NF-κB activation.
  In turn, activation of NF-κB up-regulates expression of genes that inhibit apoptosis,
  which include cFLIP, cIAP1, and cIAP2. We do not know if TNF receptors (active or
  inactive) are part of the vFLIP-containing complex and whether this complex is located
  in membrane lipid rafts in proximity to TNF receptors.
