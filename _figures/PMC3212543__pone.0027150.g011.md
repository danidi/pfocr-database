caption: (A) A highly simplified schematic of S1P metabolic pathway. Sphingosine (Sph)
  is catalyzed by Sphingosine kinase 1 or 2 (Sphks) to form S1P. S1P can be degraded
  reversibly by Sphingosine phosphatase 1 or 2 (Sgpps) back to sphingosine or irreversibly
  by Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (Sgpl) into ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal.
  Sphingosine can be converted to ceramide (Cer) by Ceramide synthase, the reverse
  reaction is catalyzed by Ceramidase. Cumulative evidence from the literature suggests
  that S1P favors cell proliferation and promote survival while ceramide and sphingosine
  tend to drive cells into apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. (B) In wild type embryo
  where there is equilibrium of sphingosine/ceramide and S1P, cell death and survival
  are kept in balance. In the Sphk1−/−;Sphk2−/− double mutant, not only is there an
  overall decrease in sphingolipids including sphingosine and ceramide, S1P is completely
  absent. This results in a distortion of the sphingosine/ceramide to S1P ratio in
  the cells, which can tip the scale towards cell death and decrease in cell proliferation.
