caption: 'Summary of oxidative stress triggers and HO-1 related cellular responses.
  BV: biliverdin, BR: bilirubin; otherwise abbreviations are as defined in the text.
  Oxidative stresses trigger ROS which in turn trigger the MAPK pathway as well as
  HO-1 via MAPK dependent and independent mechanisms. MAPK further signals through
  STAT3 to upregulate HO-1 transcription. HO-1 produces free iron which is sequestered
  into ferritin, biliverdin which is converted into bilirubin, and CO which is stable
  and diffuses readily. CO production further increases HO-1 levels. In addition,
  CO influences multiple other signaling pathways to decrease apoptosis and inflammation.'
