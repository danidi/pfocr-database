caption: Proposed role of molecular and small molecule chaperones in proteostasis.
  At baseline, Hsp90 is bound to HSF-1, maintaining its inactive state. In the presence
  of proteotoxic stress, or the addition of Hsp90 inhibitors (i.e., geldanamycin,
  17-AAG, and SNX compounds), active HSF-1 dissociates from Hsp90 and translocates
  into the nucleus where it induces Hsp70 expression. Inducible Hsp70 family members
  direct proteasomal degradation through a pathway mediated by CHIP, Parkin, and other
  E3 ligases. This process is inhibited by BAG family members and promoted by small
  molecule HSF-1 activators including celastrol and carbenoxolone. In response to
  proteotoxic stress, chaperones also direct misfolded proteins for degradation via
  the autophagy-lysosome system, through interactions with various cochaperones (chaperone-mediated
  autophagy). Chaperone/cochaperone complexes can also function to disaggregate already
  formed protein aggregates. The pharmacological chaperones, ambroxol, and isofagomine
  increase glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity in the lysosome to further promote
  the process of chaperone-mediated autophagy. Chaperone functions within the endoplasmic
  reticulum and mitochondria are regulated by the specific members of the Hsp70 family,
  HSPA5 and HSPA9, respectively.
