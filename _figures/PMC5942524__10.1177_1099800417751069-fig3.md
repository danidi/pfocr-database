  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Network. Genes colored gray are among the 27 genes
  we are exploring in this review; those colored blue have potential for future research.
  Bright blue relationships are drawn to or from the review genes to highlight relationships.
  (Readers viewing the paper version of this article are referred to the online version
  to view the figure in color.) Reviewed genes included in this network are APOE =
  apolipoprotein E gene; CRP = C-reactive protein gene; IL6 = interleukin 6 gene;
  IL10 = interleukin 10 gene; IL1A = interleukin 1 alpha gene; IL1B = interleukin
  1 beta gene; IL1RN = interleukin 1 receptor antagonist gene; TNF = tumor necrosis
  factor gene. Figures produced from IPA are available under an open-access CC-BY
  license for purposes of publication.
