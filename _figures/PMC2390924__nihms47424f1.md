caption: The β-catenin degradation complex. This complex is assembled by Axin, and
  containsβ-catenin, APC, GSK3 and CK1. PP1 and WTX may also associate with the Axin
  complex. β-catenin phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3 results in β-catenin recognition
  by β-Trcp, thereby triggering its degradation (1). Note that CK1 and GSK3 also phosphorylate
  Axin and APC, and in general these phosphorylation events result in tighter association
  of Axin and APC with β-catenin. PP1 dephosphorylation of Axin (at sites phosphorylated
  by CK1) reduces/releases GSK3-binding to Axin, which should not only result in less
  β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3, but also less Axin phosphorylation by GSK3, thereby
  releasing β-catenin from Axin as well (2). APC has a role in Axin degradation (3)
  in addition to β-catenin degradation (1), thus plays dual functions in the Wnt pathway.
