caption: a A total of 101 nonredundant unigenes are involved in the BIA biosynthetic
  pathway according to the tblastn results. Highlighted compounds are those previously
  reported in C. yanhusuo. Red numbers after each enzyme are the number of unigenes
  blasted to their homologs with an identity over 60%. Enzymes catalyzing reactions
  with blue arrows have not been identified in the Papaveraceae family. b Expression
  profile of all BIA biosynthesis candidate genes. Three biological replicates from
  the leaf (L) and tuber (R) were plotted individually. Unigenes labeled by red asterisks
  are DEGs predominant in tubers, while those marked by blue asterisks are predominant
  in leaves. TyDC tyrosine/dopa decarboxylase, 3-OHase tyrosine 3-hydroxylase, TyrAT
  tyrosine aminotransferase, 4-HPPDC 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate decarboxylase, NCS norcoclaurine
  synthase, 6OMT (S)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase, CNMT (S)-coclaurine N-methyltransferase,
  NMCH (S)-N-methylcoclaurine 3ʹ-hydroxylase; 4ʹOMT (S)-3ʹ-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine
  4ʹ-O-methyltransferase, N7OMT norreticuline 7-O-methyltransferase, BBE berberine
  bridge enzyme; SOMT scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase, CAS canadine synthase, STOX
  (S)-tetrahydroxyprotoberberine oxidase, CoOMT Columbamine O-methyltransferase, CFS
  cheilanthifoline synthase, SPS stylopine synthase, TNMT tetrahydroprotoberberine
  N-methyltransferase, MSH methylstylopine hydroxylase, P6H protopine 6-hydroxylase,
