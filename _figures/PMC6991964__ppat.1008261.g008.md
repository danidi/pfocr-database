caption: The breakdown of the blood-brain barrier during blood-stage PbA infection
  begins with parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) in the schizont stage traveling
  through the bloodstream and adhering to various receptors expressed on brain microvascular
  endothelial cells including EPCR, ICAM-1, and other unknown receptors that have
  yet to be identified (1). Signaling through these receptors leads to endothelial
  activation (2) and release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
  The cytokine LT-α can act on proximal endothelial cells to induce upregulation of
  the receptor EphA2 (3) while TNF-α induces upregulation of ephrin-A1 ligand (4)
  which can be cleaved by metalloproteinases and released into the bloodstream (although
  this monomeric form is not believed to signal). Chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL2
  recruit circulating immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, to the brain to the site
  of inflammation (5). Upon entry into the brain microvasculature, CD8+ T cells expressing
  ephrin-A1 ligand bind to EphA2 expressed on brain endothelial cells leading to clustering
  and activation of EphA2. Forward signaling cascades from the EphA2 receptor lead
  to activation of the NFκB pathway (6) which results in various downstream consequences
  including disruption of endothelial cell junctions due to both internalization and
  shedding of different adherens and tight junction protein components (7). Once brain
  endothelial cell junctions are disrupted, contents of the vasculature can leak into
  the brain parenchyma (8) leading to vascular leakage, brain edema, and the development
  of other neurological symptoms associated with PbA infection. In the absence of
  EphA2 upregulation or activation (i.e. EphA2 deficiency, PbNK65 infection, therapeutic
  targeting), this endothelial junction disruption does not occur and the blood-brain
  barrier remains intact.
