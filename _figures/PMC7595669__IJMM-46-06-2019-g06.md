caption: 'Lipid metabolic pathway analysis of the identified differential lipid species.
  (A) Analysis of liver lipid metabolic pathways of the identified differential lipid
  species in SH rats upon treatment with oleanolic acid. The pathways are numbered
  as follows: 1, sphingolipid metabolism; 2, glycerophospholipid metabolism; 3, glycerolipid
  metabolism; and 4, linoleic acid metabolism; 5, α-linolenic acid metabolism; 6,
  glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis; 7, phosphatidylinositol signaling
  system; 8, arachidonic acid metabolism. (B) Quantitative enrichment analysis performed
  using metabolite set enrichment analysis. (C) Lipid metabolic changes in the development
  of hypertension. Upregulated metabolites are shown in red, whereas metabolites shown
  in blue represent downregulated metabolites in the SH group compared with in the
  NC group (n=10/group). The treatment with OA (OA group) reversed both the up- and
  down- regulated lipid species. NC, normal control; SH, spontaneously hypertensive;
  LacCer, lactosylceramide; TriCer, trihexosylceramide; GluCer, glucosylceramide;
  SM, sphingomyelin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PA, phosphatidic
  acid; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PS, phosphatidylserine; lysoPC, lysophosphatidylcholine;
  lysoPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; CMP-PA, cytidine monophosphate-phosphatidic
  acid; CL, cardiolipin; DG, diglyceride; TG, triglyceride; LDL, low-density lipoprotein;
  sPLA2, secretory phospholipase A2; FAS, fatty acid synthase.'
