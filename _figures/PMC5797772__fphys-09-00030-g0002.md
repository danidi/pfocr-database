caption: The potential pathway of trehalose synthesis in insects and other invertebrate
  animals. Trehalose are mainly synthesized by the pathway of TPS and TPP in many
  kind of invertebrates, but it also be synthesis by TPS only in some species from
  Insecta and Crustacean. (TPS, Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; TPP, Trehalose-6-phophate
  phosphatase; TRE, Trehalase).
