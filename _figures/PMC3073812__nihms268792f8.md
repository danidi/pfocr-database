caption: Based on the data described herein and our previously published data [, ],
  we propose a model for potential involvement of ARNO as a GEF for Arf6 in promoting
  GSIS in pancreatic β-cells. We propose that glucose activates islet endogenous ARNO
  to facilitate the conversition of inactive GDP-bound Arf6 to its GTP-bound biologically
  active conformation. Essential nature for ARNO in this signaling cascade was demonstrated
  via the use of molecular biological [E156 mutant and siRNA-ARNO] and pharmacological
  approaches [e.g., secinH3]. A role for Arf6 in GSIS was confirmed via molecular
  biological [i.e., Arf6-T27N mutant and siRNA-Arf6] approaches. These data confirm
  the original observations of Lawrence and Birnbaum []. We propose that the activation
  of ARNO/Arf6 signaling pathway leads to the activation of PLD [] leading to the
  generation of fusigenic lipids [e.g., PA], which in turn, promote dissociation of
  Rac1/GDI complexes leading to the activation and membrane association of Rac1 [,
  ]. Our time course studies also suggest that ARNO-mediated activation of Cdc42 [within
  1 min] is unstream to Rac1 activation [15-20 min] together suggesting that ARNO
  facilitates sequential activation of Arf6, Cdc42 and Rac1 to promote insulin secretion.
  Potential mechanisms underlying Arf6 mediated activation of Cdc42 remain to be determined.
  It might include dissociation of Cdc42/GDI complex by biologically-active lipids
  as in the case of Rac1 [, ] or inhibition of GAP activity specific for Cdc42 by
  ARNO/Arf6 signaling pathway [see Discussion]. These aspects are being investigated
  in our laboratory currently.
