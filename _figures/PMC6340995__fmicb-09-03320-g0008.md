caption: 'SNO profile of inflammation and immune responses network in Chagas disease.
  As in Figure , PBMC SNO proteome of ChD clinically asymptomatic (ChD CA, n = 25)
  and ChD clinically symptomatic (ChD CS, n = 28) patients and of normal healthy controls
  (NH, n = 30) was developed as described in section Materials and Methods. The RoR
  values for protein spots that were differentially SNO-modified (normalized to change
  in protein abundance) at p-value of <0.05 were uploaded in the ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA) software, and proteins that changed in RoR at fold change: |≥ 1.2|
  were included in biological modeling by IPA. Shown are molecules that are predicted
  to be associated with proliferation and recruitment of immune cells and fibroblasts
  and that were significantly changed in RoR values in (A) ChD CA patients vs. NH
  controls, (B) ChD CS patients vs. NH controls, and (C) ChD CS vs. ChD CA patients.
  In the networks, the intensity of red and green colors show the extent of decrease
  and increase in protein SNO modification, respectively. Brownish orange node/lines
  and blue node/lines show predicted activation and inhibition, respectively, of a
  pathway. Gray and yellow lines are used when the putative effect is not completely
  understood.'
