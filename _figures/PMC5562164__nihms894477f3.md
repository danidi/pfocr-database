caption: 'Pathogen-containing vacuoles (PVs) are marked by Ub, galectins (Gals), autophagy
  adaptors (e.g. p62) and LC3/GABARAP proteins. These markers can trigger xenophagy,
  but also recruitment of IFN-regulated GTPases, activating inflammasomes. The IFN
  response sensitizes cells to the action of IRGs/GBPs and inflammasome induction
  by transcriptional up-regulation. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of galectins,
  p62, LC3/GABARAP proteins and autophagy regulatory proteins have the potential to
  change their interacting partners and may participate (as indicated by question
  marks) in checkpoint mechanisms that distinguish a xenophagic pathway to pathways
  that induce cell death and inflammation. A speculative interaction between an unknown
  guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and LC3/GABARAP proteins is also indicated
  by a question mark. In addition, particular orthologs of ATG8 (e.g. Gabarapl2/Gate-16)
  may be more specifically involved in recruiting interferon-regulated GTPases to
  PVs (not illustrated here). GEF: Guanine nucleotide exchange factor; BECN1: Beclin-1;
  LC3: ATG8 orthologs (LC3/GABARAPs).'
