caption: Model illustrating the role of PKR/FADD/caspase-8 in mediating the proapoptotic
  cleavage of HuR. In this study, we found that in response to severe stress (here,
  1 μm STS was used), HuR is cleaved in a manner dependent on the PKR/FADD/caspase-8
  pathway, leading to the activation of caspases-3 and -7, which we previously showed
  to be necessary for the cleavage of HuR. The data obtained in this study as well
  as those published () have led us to suggest that the cleavage of HuR enables it
  to promote apoptosome-mediated cell death, acting as an amplification signal.
