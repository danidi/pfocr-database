caption: Multiple PRRs can detect the presence viral PAMPs including nucleic acids
  and glycoproteins. TLR2, located on the cell surface, can detect viral glycoproteins,
  while cytosolic RNA detection is mediated by RIG-I and MDA5, and endosomal RNA detection
  is mediated by TLR3 and TLR7. TLR9, also located in endosomes, and cGAS, IFI16 and
  DAI, located in the cytoplasm, can mediate DNA detection.These PRRs then signal
  through distinct adaptor molecules. Toll-like receptors signal through MyD88 except
  TLR3 which signals through TRIFF. Cytosolic DNA sensors predominately signal through
  STING while cytosolic RNA sensors signal through MAVS. These adaptor proteins then
  mediate phosphorylation of the transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 and NFκB, leading
  to Type I IFN production, which is then secreted. IFN can act in an autocrine manner
  or through paracrine signaling to uninfected cells. Engagement of the IFN receptor
  leads to JAK phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT1 and upon nuclear
  localization, results in the production of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) which establish
  the antiviral state of the cell. Among these ISGs include PKR which can halt translation,
  Mx1 which can degrade incoming capsids, and Oas/RNaseL which can mediate RNA degradation.
  HSV-1 can counteract this pathway at multiple stages and details of the major genes
  involved can be found in .
