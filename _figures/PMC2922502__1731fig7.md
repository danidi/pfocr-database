caption: Model of paracrine-mediated tumor enhancement and maintenance of glioma heterogeneity.
  (Top panel) Cells expressing ΔEGFR (stippled) secrete elevated levels of IL-6 family
  cytokines IL-6 and/or LIF, which promote the in vivo growth of cells with high levels
  of wtEGFR (dark grey), thus maintaining the heterogenic composition of the tumor.
  At the molecular level, IL-6 and LIF bind to their respective receptors, IL-6R and
  LIFR, which form oligomeric complexes with two or one subunits, respectively, of
  the common signal transducer gp130. Upon ligand binding, gp130 complexes recruit
  and activate JAK kinases (not shown), which phosphorylate gp130, LIFR, and STAT3
  at Tyr705, inducing its transcriptional activation function. Activated gp130 interacts
  with and transactivates EGFR, leading to receptor-mediated signaling pathway activation
  (Akt and MAPK activation). (?) The participation of IL-6R and LIFR, as well as their
  ligands, in gp130:EGFR complexes has yet to be determined. Coordinate activation
  of STAT3, Akt, and MAPK enhance the survival and proliferation of cells expressing
  amplified wtEGFR.
