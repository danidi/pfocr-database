caption: Schematic signalling pathway of valsartan to inhibit tissue factor (TF) expression
  and inflammatory cytokines in high glucose (HG) condition. High glucose (HG) can
  be uptaken inside the cell, where it activates NF-κB and protein kinase C (PKC)
  by phosphorylation. The activated PKC then stimulates phosphorylation of ERK1/2
  MAPK which regulates transcription of Egr-1. On the other hand, the activated NF-κB
  moves into nucleus and induces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 IL-1β
  etc. In the nucleus, Egr-1 and NF-κB bind to TF promoter and induces TF expression.
  Valsartan induces phosphorylation of AMPK viaLKB1 activation. The activated AMPK
  directly inhibits Egr-1 transcription, independent of PKC/ERK signal, so that TF
  expression is inhibited in HG condition. In addition, valsartan inhibits NF-κB translocation
  in HG condition, which reduces production of NF-κB-based pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Thus, administration of valsartan, independent of AT1R, may inhibit pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and TF expression in diabetic conditions in vitro and in vivo, thus it
  reduces inflammation and other complications associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
