caption: Proposed mechanism of vascular wall resident Sca-1+ progenitor cell migration
  in response to chemokines and lipoproteins. Sca-1+ vascular progenitor cells are
  resident in the vessel wall. Chemokines, such as CCL2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand)
  and CXCL1 (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand), are released by activated smooth muscle
  cells (SMCs) and act on the Sca-1+ cells by binding to their respective receptors,
  CCR2 (C-C chemokine receptor type) and CXCR2. As a result, downstream pathways are
  activated, which include GTPAses Rac1 and Cdc42, p38 is phosphorylated and cytoskeleton-related
  proteins upregulation (FAK [focal adhesion kinase], vinculin, paxillin). Adipocytes
  also release signals, such as leptin, which bind to the corresponding receptors
  expressed in Sca-1+ cells. Consequently, Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated, leading to
  ERK (extracellular signal–regulated kinase) phosphorylation. Leptin also activates
  Stat3 pathway and the expression of cytoskeleton-related proteins. Together, the
  activation of the mentioned signaling pathways leads to either transcription of
  migration-related genes or direct activation of the cytoskeleton to promote cell
  migration. Furthermore, lipid particles, such as low-density lipoprotein or cholesterol,
  may be incorporated by Sca-1+ cells and lead to increased migration by activating
  relevant migration pathways and inducing the expression of matrix degradation proteins
  by the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9.
