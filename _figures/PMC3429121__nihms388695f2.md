  blue arrows highlight the major flux of substrates through the purine salvage pathway
  as deduced from genetic and biochemical experiments. The minor activities are represented
  by black arrows, and the dashed line indicates that the phosphoribosylation of guanine
  most likely does not occur under physiological conditions in Leishmania. Abbreviations:
