caption: 'Only the classical role of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway in the repair
  of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) is depicted, which involves highly coordinated
  protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions in the nucleus. Other reported functions
  of the FA pathway in replication stabilization, origin firing, and cytokinesis are
  not shown, but are reviewed in detail in []. In response to ICL formation, the FA
  core complex (pink circles), including Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group (FANC)
  A (FANCA), assembles near the lesion, and this activation drives the ubiquitination,
  by FANCL, of two central pathway components FANCD2 and FANCI (yellow squares), and
  their recruitment. These initial steps require the activity of the ataxia-telangectasia
  mutated (ATM) and ataxia-telangectasia and Rad-3 related (ATR) DNA damage sensor
  kinases. The formation of the central "ID" complex is followed by the activity of
  endonucleases and translesion polymerases (grey squares) for ICL unhooking and bypass.
  Finally, the recruitment of homologous recombination proteins (blue diamonds) completes
  the repair process. Some examples of HPV interactions with the FA pathway are depicted
  in grey. Pink bar: interstrand cross link in the DNA double helix. Arrow: activation,
  hatched line: inhibition, hexagon: HPV, hexagon with circular arrow: HPV replication.
  LOF: loss of function. BRCA: Breast cancer susceptibility protein; PALB: Partner
  and localizer of BRCA2; BRIP: BRCA interacting protein; RFWD: ring finger and WD
  repeat domain protein; XRCC: X-ray repair cross complimenting protein; UBE2T: Ubiquitin
  conjugating enzyme E2 T; REV7: DNA polymerase zeta processivity subunit also known
  as MAD2L2 (mitotic arrest deficient 2 like 2); SLX: structure specific endonuclease
  subunit; ERCC: excision repair 1 protein.'
