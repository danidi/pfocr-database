caption: 'The roles of NLRPs and TLRs pathways in atherosclerosis pathophysiology.
  a At first, cholesterol and LDL deposit on vascular walls. Endothelial cells are
  stimulated through TLRs and resulted in ROS and PLA2 production. The ROS and PLA2
  enzymes affected on accumulated LDL and cholesterol and produced ox-LDL and CCs.
  The ox-LDL and CCs ultimately, active endothelial cells and produce adherent molecules
  such as VCAM-1, which they evoke the monocular cells to the vascular wall. The ox-LDL
  and CCs as DAMPs are linked to NLRs and TLRs on phagocytized but they are resistant
  to macrophage lysosomal enzymes thus leads to the accumulation in macrophages and
  formats the foam cells which produce the wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  The IL-1β is one of the most important cytokines in atherosclerosis plaque and it
  has many roles such as increases the expression of adhesion molecules, which causes
  immune cells migration to the atherogenic site, smooth muscle cells proliferation,
  and MMPs activation, which lead to plaque rupture and obstructive thrombosis. b

  pro-IL-1β, and the second signal is oligomerisation of activated NLRP3, and then
