caption: Global gene expression profile and non-canonical transcriptome networks in
  human breast cancer cell lines. (A) Heat map representing the unsupervised cluster
  analysis of global gene expression in MCF-7 (), MCF-7DNP53 (), and vMCF-7DNp53 1GX
  () cells. The genes were selected based on 2-fold change cut-off. Data set used
  for hierarchical clustering were normalized by standardizing the expression level
  of each gene and each sample to mean = 0 and variance = 1. The diagram shows consistent
  changes between two separate analyses. (B) Venn diagram showing gene expression
  comparison between MCF-7, vMCF-7DNp53 and vMCF-7DNp53 1GX cells. (C and D) Non-canonical
  transcriptome network maps identified in the comparison between vMCF-7DNp53 and
  vMCF-7DNp53 1GX cells. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis program identifed major functional
  gene networks with important implications for breast cancer progression showing
  key nodal genes involved in tumor self-renewal (SOX), chemoresistance and metastases
  (p38MAPK signaling pathway) were overexpressed in vMCF-7DNp53 1GX cells compared
  to the vMCF-7DNp53 parental cells.
