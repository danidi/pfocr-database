caption: 'Outline of p-menthane monoterpene metabolism in peppermint glandular trichomes.
  The following enzymes are involved in this pathway: indicated by “(),” (−)-limonene
  synthase; indicated by “(),” (−)-limonene 3-hydroxylase; indicated by “(),” (−)-trans-isopiperitenol
  dehydrogenase; indicated by “(),” (−)-trans-isopiperitenone reductase; indicated
  by “(),” (+)-cis-isopulegone isomerase; indicated by “(),” (+)-menthofuran synthase;
  indicated by “(7a),” (+)-pulegone reductase [(−)-menthone-forming activity]; indicated
  by “(7b),” (+)-pulegone reductase [(+)-isomenthone-forming activity]; indicated
  by “(8a),” (−)-menthone: (−)-menthol reductase [(−)-menthol-forming activity]; indicated
  by “(8b),” (−)-menthone: (−)-menthol reductase [(+)-neoisomenthol-forming activity];
  indicated by “(9a),” (−)-menthone: (+)-neomenthol reductase [(+)-neomenthol-forming
  activity]; indicated by “(9b),” (−)-menthone: (+)-neomenthol reductase [(+)-isomenthol-forming
  activity]. The subcellular compartmentation of p-menthane metabolic enzymes is color-coded:
  Cyt (blue), cytosol; ER (orange), endoplasmic reticulum; Lpl (green), leucoplasts;
  Mit (red), mitochondria. The inhibition of PR by (+)-menthofuran, as demonstrated
  in the present manuscript, is indicated by a red arc with an orthogonal red line.'
