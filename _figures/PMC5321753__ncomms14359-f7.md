caption: Signalling molecules affected in FXS, translation of direct FMRP mRNA targets
  (including Adcy1), and translation under control of Adcy1–ERK1/2 signalling are
  marked in maroon font. The loss of FMRP-dependent suppression of Adcy1 mRNA translation
  results in overexpression of ADCY1 on synaptic membrane, which leads to exaggerated
  ERK1/2 signalling (possibly cross talks with PI3K pathway), increased S6K1 activity
  and enhanced protein synthesis in FXS neurons. A possible feed forward loop, in
  which ADCY1-mediated ERK1/2 over-activation further enhances Adcy1 mRNA translation,
  may amplify exaggerated neuronal signalling and translation dysregulation in FXS.
  The homoeostasis of cAMP is maintained by the balance between multiple ADCYs and
  PDE, whose activity can be up-regulated by cAMP, ERK1/2 and PI3K. It is unclear
  whether the elevated ERK1/2 activity caused by ADCY1 overexpression is solely mediated
  by cAMP production. Insights about how FMRP-dependent translation impinges on the
  feedback network among these signalling molecules require further investigation.
