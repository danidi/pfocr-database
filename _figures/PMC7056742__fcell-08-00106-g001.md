caption: 'Activation of inflammasome requires two signals: signal I is PAMPs or DAMPs
  close to the cell, sensed by TLRs or NLRs, and activate MAPK or NF-kB signaling
  pathway, which in turns produces pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Signal II is K+, H+ or
  Ca+ efflux, or oxidative stress activation by ROS, or lysosomal rupture, leading
  to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. ASC recruits pro caspase-1, which is then
  is cleaved into active p20 and p10 fragments, followed by the maturation of IL-1β
  and IL-18, as well as the cleavage of GSDMD, leading to cell pyroptosis. Both of
  these signals are called the canonical pathway of inflammation activation. When
  signal II is mediated by caspase-11/caspase-4, it is called the non-canonical activation
  pathway of inflammasome.'
