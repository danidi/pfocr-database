caption: The similar activation process of autophagy and NF-κB pathway in response
  to Salmonella. Upon exposed in cytosol, Salmonellae were Ub coated and following
  the recruitment of HOIP, HOIL, and Sharpin. The combination of HOIP, HOIL, and Sharpin
  is termed as LUBAC, which can synthesize the M1-linked Ub chains. Ultimately, the
  M1-linked linear poly-Ub coated on Salmonellae recruit OPTN and NEMO to initiate
  autophagy and NF-κB signaling pathways, which play crucial roles in restrict proliferation
  of Salmonellae independently. OTULIN is a DUB which inhibits the recruitment of
  NEMO and ultimately NF-κB pathway by restraining the formation of M1-linked Ub chains.
