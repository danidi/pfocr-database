caption: Hub genes associated with Interleukin-3-mediated signaling pathway. (A) Subnetwork
  1 and (B) Subnetwork 2 protein-protein interaction network. Specifically, “green”
  and “purple” indicate the nodes are up- and down-regulated, respectively. The progressive
  color changing represents the expression levels. The areas of the nodes indicate
  the degrees that the nodes connect to others. The node sizes represent ranking of
  significant genes in terms of degree centrality i.e., the greater quantity of neighbors
  a node has.
