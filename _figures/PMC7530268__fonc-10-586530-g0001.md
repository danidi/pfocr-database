caption: The ferroptotic cascade. Accumulation of free iron is a key initiator of
  ferroptosis. After loading onto Tf, the Fe3+/Tf complex binds to TFR1, and iron
  is thereafter released into endocytosis vesicles under lower pH conditions, where
  Fe3+ is reduced into the ferrous form Fe2+ under the action of ferrireductase STEAP3.
  Iron then exits into the cytosol via DMT1 to form the labile iron pool (LIP). The
  LIP represents a very slight per se, whereas most iron is either stored in FTH,
  either used as a cofactor for several iron-containing enzymes, or for the synthesis
  of heme. Excess iron is carried in the extracellular space through FPN after being
  reoxydized by hephaestin. FTH autophagic degradation, a process termed ferritinophagy,
  is mediated by NCOA4, a cargo receptor that binds to the heavy chain of FTH delivering
  it to the early-stage autophagosome, inducing the subsequent release of iron into
  the cytosol. Iron release from heme through HO-1 is another way to increase the
  LIP. Inside mitochondria, CISD1 modulates mitochondrial iron uptake and respiratory
  capacity and mitigates ferroptosis. The hormone hepcidin, mostly secreted by hepatocytes
  in the systemic circulation, triggers ferroportin lysosomal degradation, thus hindering
  iron exit. AA or AdA are key membrane phospholipids esterified by ACSL4 and LPCAT
  to generate PE-AA/ AdA, and further oxidized to phospholipid hydroperoxides (PE-AA/AdA-OOH)
  by LOXs. Free iron can also interact with ROS, specifically hydrogen peroxide, to
  form hydroxyl/peroxyl (LOH/LOOH) toxic radicals via the Fenton reaction. Therefore,
  iron can then abstract a hydrogen atom from PUFAs, forming a lipid radical which
  promptly reacts with oxygen to generate a lipid peroxide (PUFA-OOH). In a steady
  state, lipid peroxides and their degradation products are neutralized by GSH-based
  redox reactions. The xCT antiporter (consisting of two subunits SLC7A11 and SLC3A2)
  exports glutamine and imports cystine into the cell. Inside the cell, cystine is
  reduced to cysteine by cystine reductase and then GCL and GSS add L-glutamate and
  glycine respectively, to produce GSH. Another way to generate cysteine is via the
  trans-sulfuration pathway converting methionine in homocystein, and later cysteine
  by CBS. Many redox enzymes use GSH, including GPX4, which reduces reactive lipid
  peroxydes to their alcohol counterparts. Additionally, CoQ10, a byproduct of the
  mevalonate pathway, acts as a complemental RTA to mitigate ferroptosis. CoQ10 is
  reduced to CoQ1O-H2 by FSP1, enabling its activity. GPX4 and SLC7A11 are target
  genes of the master antioxidant regulator NRF2, as well as the enzymes contributing
  to GSH synthesis, GCL, GSS, and CBL. NRF2 additionally mediates iron metabolism
  by upregulating the transcriptional level of FTH, FPN, and HO-1. In the absence
  of redox stress, NRF2 is downregulated by the E3-ubiquitine ligase KEAP1. If the
  key redox regulator is genetically disrupted or pharmacologically inhibited, lipid
  peroxides and their degradation products accumulate, and thereby initiate ferroptosis
  through a yet unknown mechanism involving membrane destabilization, cytoskeletal
  changes, and cell death. AA, arachidonic acid; AdA, adrenic acid; ACSL4, acyi-CoA
