caption: Schematic overview of the elements of the cAMP signal transduction pathway
  in cardiac myocytes. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the β-adrenergic
  receptor activate Gαs causing a stimulation of cAMP production by adenylate cyclase
  (AC). Other GPCRs such as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor couple with GαI
  causing an inhibition of AC. cAMP production is highly controlled in a spatiotemporal
  manner. Main control of compartmentalization is through the rapid degradation of
  cAMP by phosphodiesterases (PDE) which hydrolyzes cAMP to adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP). PDE are often present in close neighborhood with protein kinase A (PKA) through
  association with A kinase anchor proteins (AKAP) proteins, which are responsible
  for localizing PKA to different compartments in the cell. Other cAMP-binding domain
  (CNBD) containing proteins are the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated
  (HCN) channels, which play a major player in cardiac pacemaking. The exchange factor
  directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which
  modulates Ras related protein 1 (Rap1), a small GTP-binding protein. The Popeye
  domain containing (Popdc) proteins represent yet another class of cAMP-binding proteins,
  which play an important role in cardiac pacemaking. Popdc proteins interact with
  the two-pore potassium ion channel TWIK related K-1 (TREK-1) and Caveolin 3 (Cav-3)
  [,]. For each cAMP effector protein a few examples of functions in striated muscle
  tissue are given in the white boxes adjacent to each molecule. It becomes apparent
  that the cAMP-binding proteins display significant functional overlap. It should
  also be mentioned that different cardiac muscle cells differ in the level of expression
  of some the depicted effector proteins. For example, the sinuatrial (SAN) and atrioventricular
  (AVN) nodes express higher levels of HCN1 and HCN4 and Popdc1 and Popdc2 than atrial
  and ventricular muscle cells.
