caption: 'Lytic cycle proteins contribution to tumor initiation and tumor maintenance
  through enhanced survival, inflammation and immunomodulation. BHRF1 & BALF1, two
  viral orthologues of cellular Bcl-2, display anti-apoptotic functions protecting
  infected cells from death signals. Immunoevasion occurs through several mechanisms:
  BCRF1 (encoding a viral IL-10) and BARF1 contribute to reduced natural killer (NK)
  and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses as well as suppression of T cell activity
  through inhibition of IFN-γ. BILF1, BGLF5 and BNLF2a deregulate the HLA pathway
  to evade elimination of EBV infected cells. Also, BILF1 displays an interfering
  regulatory role upon CXCL12-dependent activation of CXCR4. Viral reactivation genes
  also importantly contribute to inflammation. Zta directly or indirectly enhances
  levels of IL-13, IL-8, CXC chemokine GRO, CCL4, IL-6, and IL-10. IL-6 and IL-10
  are also increased by Rta. BLLF3 increases secretion of pro-inflammatory Th1 and
  Th17 cytokines and of IL-10. The resulting inflammatory microenvironment promotes
  tumor growth through autocrine/paracrine stimulation.'
