caption: Comparison of the TCA cycle in five metabolic pathway databases. Map illustrating
  the (lack of) consensus for the TCA cycle. Metabolites are represented by rectangles,
  genes by rounded rectangles, and EC numbers by parallelograms. Color indicates how
  many of the five databases agree on a specific entity (gene, EC number, reaction).
  We first matched reactions based on their metabolites. Genes and EC numbers were
  matched within matching reactions. Color of an arrow indicates the number of databases
  that agree upon an entire reaction, i.e., all its metabolites (except H+ which was
  matched separately). 'x' denotes a missing EC number. Areas labeled A-D highlight
  the reactions that are discussed in the running text as examples of differences
  caused by a disagreement on pathway definition.
