caption: Upon stimulation of NMDA receptors SGK3 is transcriptionally upregulated.
  SGK3 in turn phosphorylates/activates PIKfyve, which leads to local production of
  PI(3,5)P2 in PIKfyve-containing recycling vesicles. PI(3,5)P2 in turn stimulates
  Rab11-dependent plasma membrane-directed trafficking of GluA1-containing vesicles.
