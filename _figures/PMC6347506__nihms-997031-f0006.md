caption: a | Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) regulates the differentiation of lung epithelial
  cells through repression of the Dlk1-Dio3 and miR-17–92 microRNA (miRNA) clusters.
  Increased expression of miRNAs represses genes in the transforming growth factor-β
  (TGFβ) signalling pathway, leading to defective extracellular matrix formation and
  failure of alveolar cell spreading. Defects in cell spreading and flattening impair
  lung sacculation and aίveoίogenesis. b | In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs),
  HDAC3 is required for maintenance of the epithelial barrier that separates the gut
  lumen from the systemic circulation, ensures Paneth cell survival, controls cell
  proliferation and protects against enteric bacteria. HDAC3 in IECs prevents enteric
  infection by signalling to intraepithelial CD8+ T lymphocytes (IELs) to mount a
  protective interferon-γ (IFNγ) immune response. c | Late in the day, at pre-dusk
  hours (Zeitgeber time (ZT) 10–12), HDAC3 and REV-ERBα repress branched-chain amino
  acid (BCAA) catabolism and the purine nucleotide cycle (PNC) pathway through repression
  of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, mitochondrial (BCAT2) and AMP deaminase
  3 (AMPD3), respectively, to promote glucose utilization during the upcoming feeding
  cycle when glucose supply is abundant. At pre-dawn hours (ZT 22–24), when REV-ERBα
  and HDAC3 do not bind, increased BCAT2 and AMPD3 expression promotes the utilization
  of protein and lipid fuels over glucose to supply metabolic intermediates to the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Muscle utilization of protein and lipid fuels during
  periods of daily fasting preserves glucose supplies for the brain and other vital
  organs. Ac, acetyl group; GPS2, G protein pathway suppressor 2; IL-18, interίeukin-18;
  NCoR, nuclear receptor co-repressor 1; NR, nuclear receptor; RORE, ROR response
  element; SMRT, silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor;
  TBL1X, transducin β-like 1, X-linked; TBL1XR1, TBL1-reίated protein 1; TF, transcription
  factor.
