caption: IL-6 synthesis and regulation of IL-6 mRNA stability by Arid5a. Pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns are recognized by pathogen-recognition receptors to induce proinflammatory
  cytokines; in this figure, TLR4 recognizes LPS and induces IL-6 mRNA via activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Regnase-1 promotes IL-6 mRNA degradation, whereas
  Arid5a inhibits destabilizing effects of regnase-1. The balance between Arid5a and
  regnase-1 is important for the regulation of IL-6 mRNA. MD2, myeloid differentiation
  protein 2; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; IκB, inhibitor of
  NF-κB.
