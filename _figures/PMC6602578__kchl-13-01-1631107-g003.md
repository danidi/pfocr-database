caption: Diagram summarizing the role of glia connexin changes in demyelinating disorders.
  a. The top panel shows intracellular communication via connexin gap junctions between
  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes under normal conditions, and the possible effects
  of oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells (OPCs) on the blood-brain barrier
  (BBB) integrity, either directly through signaling or indirectly through the still
  to be clarified effects on astrocytes modifying their responses. b. The bottom panel
  demonstrates how the loss of oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte-astrocyte (O/A)
  GJs may result in the disruption of BBB and exacerbated neuroinflammatory response.
  Loss of the O/A Cx47-Cx43 channels is likely to lead on one hand to impaired homeostasis
  in oligodendrocytes and to accelerate demyelination and oligodendrocyte apoptosis
  under stress conditions. On the other hand, the disconnection of astrocytes from
  oligodendrocytes may alter the regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways within astrocytes,
  including the NFkB pathway, with further dysregulation of BBB and increased CNS
  inflammation and demyelination.
