caption: (A) The Notch receptor is processed sequentially by three enzymatic activities.
  In the Golgi compartment, Notch is cleaved by furin to produce two covalently linked
  fragments, which form the mature protein. After reaching the cell surface, Notch
  is activated and processed following the interaction with a ligand and an ADAM protease
  to release its ectodomain into the extracellular matrix. This shedding event renders
  the truncated membrane-bound Notch remnant accessible to the action of the γ-secretase
  complex, which cuts Notch within the confines of the lipid bilayer to release the
  Notch intracellular domain, NICD. This gene regulatory fragment then moves to the
  nucleus where it interacts with various co-activators, including CSL and MAM to
  regulate target gene expression. (B) The growth regulator dMyc is a target of the
  Notch pathway. One of the targets regulated by dMyc is the translation initiation
  factor eIF4E, which acts as a cell growth mediator. The dMyc/eIF4E regulatory loop
  functions to control cell growth and cell fate choices in type II neuroblast lineages
  (based on []).
