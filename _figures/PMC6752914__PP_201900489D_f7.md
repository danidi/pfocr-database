caption: Models depicting the regulatory roles of the CrPIF1-CrGATA1 module in light-induced
  vindoline biosynthesis. Left, CrPIF1 is likely accumulated in the dark and represses
  the expression of CrGATA1, T16H2, and DAT by binding to their promoters. Repression
  of CrGATA1 results in down-regulation of vindoline pathway genes, T16H2, T3O, T3R,
  D4H, and DAT, leading to limited vindoline production and increased tabersonine
  accumulation. One or more unknown TFs (TF?) mediates the low (basal) expression
  of CrGATA1 despite CrPIF1 repression. Right, CrPIF1 is possibly degraded upon exposure
  of C. roseus seedlings to light, which is mediated by the red light sensed by phytochrome.
  Derepression of CrGATA1 results in the activation of vindoline pathway genes and
  vindoline accumulation. The seven genes involved in the conversion of tabersonine
  to vindoline are listed in the inset box. Genes in red are responsive to light induction.
