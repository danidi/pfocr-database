caption: Illustration of the conservation of core apoptosis regulatory genes within
  Drosophila, An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti. The unrooted trees were built using neighbor
  end joining, complete deletion, p-distance with full amino acid sequences. The pathway
  illustrated is based on information obtained from studies using Drosophila. In Drosophila,
  thread inhibits Nc and Ice, while thread itself is inhibited by the IBM-containing
  proteins rpr, W, and grim. The initiator caspase Nc is responsible for cleaving
  and activating effector caspases including Ice and Dcp-1. Nc is activated by Ark,
  which for simplicity is not shown but which is also conserved in Ae. aegypti.
