caption: 'Mechanisms of tumor progression and tumor microenvironment‐mediated immune
  evasion in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Left: Programmed cell death ligand 1
  (PD‐L1) normally binds PD‐1 on T cells and regulates their activity. Centre: In
  cHL, PD‐L1 is also expressed by Hodgkin Reed‐Sternberg (HRS) cells. In these cells,
  PD‐L1 binds PD‐1 on CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells and suppresses T‐cell effector
  function. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the PD‐1: PD‐L1 pathway are both critical
  to terminating immune responses. Tregs lead to inhibition of the activity of conventional
  T cells. Right: Infiltration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by myeloid‐derived
  suppressor cells (MDSC) and CD163 + M2 macrophages inhibit immune surveillance in
  cHL. Inflammatory and immune cells infiltrating the TME also express ligands (eg,
  CD30L and CD40L) that bind receptors on HRS cell membranes. In some cases, Epstein‐Barr
  virus infects the tumor clone, and the viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) both
  augments HRS cell PD‐L1 expression and helps HRS cells resist apoptosis. In red,
  therapeutic agents targeting signals that allow HRS cells to evade immune surveillance
  and to resist apoptosis. Asterisks indicate U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
  agents'
