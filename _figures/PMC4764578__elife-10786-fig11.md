caption: '(A) We propose a model in which pre-TCR and Notch signaling both activate
  PI3K to produce PIP3 in DN3/DN3-4 cells. PIP3 then recruits and activates Akt to
  increase glucose metabolism via the Akt/mTOR pathway. This is required for DN3-to-DP
  cell differentiation. However, pre-TCR signaling also activates Itpkb to produce
  IP4, which competes with PIP3 for Akt PH domain binding and limits Akt recruitment,
  Akt and mTOR activation in pre-TCR expressing DN3/DN3-4 cells. IP4 may have additional
  effectors, indicated by the question mark. By limiting downstream glucose metabolism,
  this "IP4 brake" delays the kinetics of β-selection and renders this process dependent
  on Notch costimulation. (B) Without Itpkb, IP4 no more dampens Akt activation and
  pre-TCR signaling alone sufficiently activates Akt/mTOR signaling to trigger DP
  cell development in the absence of Notch engagement. (C) In the presence of Notch-signals,
  Akt is now hyperactivated and causes an accelerated DN3-to-DP cell differentiation.DOI:
