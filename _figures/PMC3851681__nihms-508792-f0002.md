caption: In M-Mac, there is no block to the HIV-1 life cycle and HIV-1 viral DNA is
  able to integrate into the host genome. Genes encoding spectrin (SPTBA1 and SPTBN1
  for example) are normally transcribed and the cells have a normal cytoskeletal structure
  with actin being anchored to the plasma membrane by spectrin. The actin cytoskeleton
  may be also important for the HIV-1 viral cycle. In I-Mac, IL-27 leads to TAK1 activation
  via gp130 and activates the MAP Kinase pathway which in turn down-regulates SPTBN1.As
  SPTBN1 is a key component of spectrin, the normal cytoskeletal structure close to
  the plasma membrane is lost as actin is unable to bind to spectrin. The HIV life
  cycle is halted prior to completion of reverse transcription. In addition IL-27
  mediated activation of the JAK/STAT pathway leads to the induction of interferon
  stimulated genes (ISG) which may also mediate anti-viral properties.
