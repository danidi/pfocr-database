caption: 'The FA pathway comprising 20 proteins is grouped into two classes: class
  I defines an upstream ubiquitin signalling module, and class II consists of downstream
  DNA repair proteins. The FA core complex is activated by stalled replication forks
  and co-operates with the E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2T (T) to monoubiquitinate the
  heterodimer FANCI-FANCD2 (I-D2). The RING E3 ligase FANCL (L) is the catalytic subunit,
  with associated FANCB (B) and FAAP-100 (F-100). Recruitment to stalled forks is
  mediated by FANCM (M), FAAP-10, -16, and -24. Monoubiquitinated I–D2 then promotes
  DNA repair by coordinating TLS (translesion synthesis) polymerase, nucleases, and
  HR-dependent pathways.'
