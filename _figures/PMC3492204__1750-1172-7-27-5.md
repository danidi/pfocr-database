caption: 'A simplified scheme to illustrate the dual roles played by KIF7 in Indian
  Hedgehog (IHh) signaling and chondrocytes development. In chondrocytes Hedgehog
  (Hh) signaling pathway is initiated by the IHh ligand binding to PTC, which releases
  the inhibition of SMO. KIF7 positively modulates IHh pathway activity during development
  through downregulation of SUFU (indicated by thin straight line). SUFU is a known
  negative regulator of IHh pathway that prevents GLI-mediated transcription for the
  genes responsible for chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation during development.
  In the absence of KIF7, SUFU becomes uninhibited and exerts higher levels of suppression
  on GLI-mediated transcription (indicated by thick straight line). In the absence
  of SUFU, KIF7 negatively regulates IHh signaling to a lesser extent by inhibiting
  GLI-mediated transcription by undefined mechanism (indicated by dashed line). ECM:
  extracellular matrix. Adapted from Hsu et al.[].'
