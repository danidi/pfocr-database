caption: Figure 1. Model for RACK1 function in the plant and metazoan miRNA pathway.
  (A) RACK1 influences different steps of miRNA biogenesis and action. Green = plant
  proteins, Blue = Metazoan proteins, Grey = Common factors. (B) Exogenous or endogenous
  signals may affect the miRNA pathway by either modulating RACK1 abundance or function.
  This may lead to changes in miRNA expression and function in response to different
  stimuli.
