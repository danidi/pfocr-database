caption: '(A) The regulation of MUC2 expression in PK-8 cells was predominantly mediated
  by the GPCR pathway, with synergistic effects of the MAPK pathway and additive effects
  of the PI3K pathway. Minimal interactions existed among the 3 signaling pathways
  themselves. (B) MUC2 expression in PCI-35 cells was regulated predominantly by the
  MAPK pathway and additively by the PI3K pathway, whereas the GPCR pathway was antagonistic.
  Active interactions existed among the signaling pathways: cAMP was upregulated by
  active MAPK and downregulated by active PI3K. (C) MUC5AC expression in PK-8 cells
  was regulated predominantly by the GPCR pathway, the MAPK pathway was antagonistic,
  and the PI3K pathway played a weak role. (D) MUC5AC expression in PCI-35 cells was
  regulated predominantly by the MAPK pathway, whereas both the PI3K and GPCR pathways
  were antagonistic.'
