caption: The proposed mechanism for the indirect pathway of allorecognition in the
  T cell areas of the spleen and LNs. Numbers in red (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12) are
  confirmed findings and those in blue (3, 5, 8, 10) are suggestions. 1. Migration
  of injected donor T cells to the T cell areas. Pertussis toxin (PTX) inhibits this
  process. 2. Clustering of donor T cells with recipient DCs. 3. Secretion of NK-recruiting
  chemokines by recipient DCs. 4. Recruitment of NK cells to the T cell areas. Anti-asialo
  GM1 antibody (Ab) inhibits this process. 5. Killing of donor T cells by NK cells.
  6. Fragmentation of T cells in the T cell area. 7. Phagocytosis of donor T cell
  fragments by XCR1+ DCs, which was associated with upregulation of CD40 in these
  cells. 8. Transfer of captured antigenic information by XCR1+ DCs to resident XCR1−
  DCs in the T cell areas. 9. Cluster formation of both XCR1+CD103+ and XCR1−CD103+
  DCs in the T cell area. 10. Presentation of donor MHCI peptides to CD4+ T cells.
  11. Proliferative response of CD4+ T cells in the cluster (). 12. Antibody-forming
  cell response with production and secretion of donor-specific transfusion (DST)
  antibodies (). Blue cells and green cells are donor and recipient cells, respectively.
  Red nuclei indicate proliferating cells. AFC, antibody-forming cell; Th, CD4+ T
  cell.
