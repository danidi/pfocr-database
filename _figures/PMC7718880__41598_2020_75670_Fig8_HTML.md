caption: The schematic diagram illustrates the mechanism for the effect of the oxalate/LCN2/ERK
  and p-ERK and the expressions of LCN2, PTGS1, GPX3 and MMD axises on renal epithelial
  cell damage during kidney stone formation. Activation of ERK1/2 by oxalate stimulation
  promotes the expressions of LCN2 and other proteins. Then LCN2, in turn, activates
  the ERK signaling pathway through its receptor.
