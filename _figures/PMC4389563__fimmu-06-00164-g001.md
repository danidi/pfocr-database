caption: Time-resolved metabolic reprograming during pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization.
  This model illustrates the activation of a macrophage as a function of time and
  is based on the literature discussed in the main text. LPS-induced activation can
  be grouped into an initiation-, an early metabolic-reprograming,- and an amplification-phase.
  The initiation phase of the metabolic response is characterized by an increase in
  glucose consumption and in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). The early
  metabolic reprograming phase depicts the increase and rerouting of carbon flux through
  glycolysis and the PPP, events which also regulate the cellular redox-state. In
  this setting, the mitochondrial association of hexokinase-II (HKII) appears to provide
  sufficient levels of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), while the downregulation of sedoheptulose
  kinase (Shpk, previously known as CARKL) appears to be necessary to maintain appropriate
  carbon flux at the interface of glycolysis and the PPP. During the amplification
  phase, this pro-glycolytic metabolic-phenotype is further strengthened. A switch
  toward the more active 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2) enzyme PFKFB3 produces higher
  levels of fructose 2-bisphosphate [F2,6bP], thus allosterically activating PFK1
  and enhancing glycolytic flux. Dimers of the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), as well
  as accumulating succinate further augment metabolic reprograming by supporting HIF-1α
  dependent transcriptional induction of glycolytic genes. In the amplification phase,
  also the export of intracellular glycolysis-derived lactate through monocarboxylate
  transporter 4 (MCT4) becomes obligatory, which may otherwise inhibit PFK1. These
  initial events lead to more prominent metabolic changes observed 24 h after macrophages
  have encountered the pro-inflammatory stimuli. However, further time-resolved data
  is required to refine these processes and our current perspective, how cellular
  metabolism of macrophages adapts during activation.
