caption: Signaling pathways mediating the dual roles of senescence-associated inflammatory
  cytokines in cancer development. The senescence stimuli, such as telomere attrition,
  activated oncogenes, DNA damage, initially activate C/EBPβ, NF-κB, and p38 through
  mechanisms yet to be identified, leading to increased expression of IL-6. IL-6 in
  turn induces the expression levels of other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  including those binding to the CXCR2 receptor. The senescence signals also induce
  the expression level of CXCR2, which is activated in the presence of the increased
  amount of CXCR2 ligands. The induced CXCR2 activates the senescence effectors, such
  as p15INK4B, p16INK4A and the p53/p21WAF1 circuit, triggering cellular senescence.
  Within the pathway, C/EBPβ and IL-6 form a positive feedback loop, as C/EBPβ mediates
  the increased expression of TL-6, and the induction of C/EBPβ requires TL-6. Moreover,
  C/EBPβ directly stimulates the transcription of not only IL-6, but also the cytokines
  that are induced by IL-6. While the function of IL-6 in the execution of senescence
  is mainly mediated by an autocrine effect, a paracrine pathway at least partly contributes
  to the role of IL-8 and other CXCR2 ligands in senescence. The inflammatory cytokines
  secreted to the extracellular compartment by senescent cells also have paracrine
  functions. They mediate the clearance of tumors by recruiting host immune cells
  to tumor tissues. In addition, the inflammatory cytokines provide a cancer-promoting
  microenvironment for nearby tumors by enhancing angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation
  and survival, and tumor invasion and metastasis.
