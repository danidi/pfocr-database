caption: A model depicting the cooperation between PP2B and PP1α to dephosphorylate
  Cdk9 T-loop and release P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP for transcription in response to Ca2+signaling.
  UV/HMBA triggers Ca2+ influx through the L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC) in the plasma
  membrane. Coupled to Ca2+ entry, activation of calmodulin (CaM) results in the nuclear
  import of activated PP2B, which targets a yet-to-be identified component of 7SK
  snRNP (indicated by a question mark [?]; the depiction of HEXIM1 as a target is
  purely hypothetical) and alters the conformation of the complex. This facilitates
  the dephosphorylation of Cdk9 at T186 by PP1α, which is activated by UV/HMBA via
  a separate, as-yet-undefined signaling pathway. As a result of the sequential and
  cooperative actions of PP2B and PP1α, P-TEFb is released from 7SK snRNP. This process
  is blocked at various stages by the indicated pharmacological inhibitors. The released,
  unphosphorylated P-TEFb is transferred to Brd4, which recruits it to the PIC. After
  the synthesis of a short RNA, Cdk9 is rephosphorylated at T186 by an unknown kinase
  to become transcriptionally active. Upon completion of transcription, the excess
  amount of active, pT186-containing P-TEFb is reassembled into 7SK snRNP to maintain
  a functional equilibrium for optimal growth.
