caption: Regulation of PTPase catalytic activity by oxidation, conjugation, and reduction
  of the catalytic cysteine residue.A key feature of PTPases in the regulation of
  signal transduction is the modulation of their activity by alterations of the oxidation-reduction
  state of the enzyme catalytic center. The catalytic cysteine of the PTPases is especially
  reactive because of the low pKa of the sulfhydryl that favors a relatively ionized
  state of the cysteinyl hydrogen (), and stepwise oxidation of the catalytic cysteine
  residue of PTPases by reactive oxygen species to more inert forms is a major source
  of enzymatic regulation in vivo (, , ). Oxidation of the catalytic thiol to the
  sulfenic (—SOH) form is reversible. Higher order oxidation to sulfinic (—SO2H) and
  sulfonic (—SO3H) forms can lead to irreversible PTPase inactivation. Mildly oxidized
  PTPases can undergo disulfide conjugation in the cell with glutathione (). A novel
  sulfenyl-amide derivative of PTP1B has been shown to undergo GSH conjugation or
  direct biochemical reduction with DTT (, ). Active enzyme can be regenerated from
  glutathiolated enzyme by cellular GSH reductases. Whereas the sulfonic-acid derivative
  of the active site cysteine is felt to be irreversible, the sulfinic-acid derivative
  may be reduced by a novel class of recently described sulfiredoxin enzymes () to
  a conjugated form that precedes the regeneration of the active enzyme. These mechanisms
  of PTPase regulation are an active area of current research. See text for further
  discussion and references.
