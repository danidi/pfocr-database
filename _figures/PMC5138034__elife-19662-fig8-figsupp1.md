caption: 'Cell death induces release of actin that is detected by an unknown sensor,
  which then promotes ROS production by Nox in the fat body. Nox-derived ROS activate
  Src42A and phosphorylate either the sensor or another receptor, allowing Shark-dependent
  signalling. This leads to the production of Upd 3, which engages Domeless and activates
  STAT, leading to induction of downstream genes such as TotM. Upd three is depicted
  as acting in a paracrine manner for ease of visualisation but is expected to also
  act in an autocrine fashion. Note that this model is speculative and will require
  further validation, for example to formally show that Src42A is upstream of Dome.DOI:
