caption: 'Plain arrows represent flux through the indicated enzymatic process. Dotted
  arrows represent flux through the indicated multistep metabolic pathway. Circles
  represent the carbon backbone of the molecule. Filled black circles indicate the
  location of the 13C label upstream of PC and PDH. Filled green and purple circles
  indicate the location of the 13C label after metabolism through PC or PDH, respectively,
  and the first turn of the TCA cycle. Half-filled green and purple circles indicate
  the locations of the 13C label after metabolism through the second and subsequent
  turns of the TCA cycle on a population level (i.e.: may or may not be on the same
  molecule). The boxes represent the glutamate/glutamine molecules detected in the
  MR spectra. Adapted from Brekke et al. . PC = pyruvate carboxylase, PDH = pyruvate
  dehydrogenase, TCA = tricarboxylic acid, α-KG = α-ketoglutarate.'
