caption: Overview of folate-homocysteine metabolism pathway and possible causes of
  folate deficiency. Humans can obtain folate from food or food supplements, FA and
  5-Me-THF. Folates from food are polyglutamates and have to be hydrolized to monoglutamates
  in the intestine prior to absorption by the enzyme GCPII. FA and 5-Me-THF are absorbed
  directly without modification. Dietary folate and FA also need enzymatic activation;
  after entry through receptors in the cell membrane, folates are polyglutamated by
  FPGS and reduced to DHF and THF by DHFR. The latter enters the folate cycle (violet),
  which includes numerous other enzymes, MTHFD1, MTHFR, MTR, and MTRR, and is tightly
  connected to the methionine cycle (green), where homocysteine is re-methylated back
  to methionine. FOL-PG folate polyglutamate, GCPII glutamate carboxypeptidase II,
  FOL-MG folate monoglutamate, FA folic acid, SLC19A1 reduced folate carrier protein,
