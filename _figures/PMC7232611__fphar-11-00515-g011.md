caption: Overview of the mechanistic basis for Gent-mediated treatment of rheumatoid
  arthritis. Stimulation of cells with TNF-α leads to both NF-κB activation and ROS
  production, thereby driving NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, and pro-IL-1β upregulation.
  In response to the above signal, the NLRP3 inflammasome then undergoes assembly
  and cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to yield an active form of this protein, thus forming
  the NLRP3 inflammasome which then cleaves pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β that is subsequently
  secreted from stimulated cells. This IL-1β subsequently promotes RA progression.
  Gent was able to inhibit ROS-NF-κB activation and to disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome
  assembly, thereby reducing IL-1β secretion. This in turn resulted in decreased RA-FLS
  migration and proliferation, thus significantly decreasing the severity of RA immunopathological
  injury.
