caption: Schematic figures of metabolic alterations in HCC. (a) The schematic figure
  showing the metabolic alteration as liver disease progresses from normal liver,
  chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, to well- and poorly differentiated HCC. Glycolysis
  and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were increased and the TCA cycle and β-oxidation
  were decreased throughout the disease progression course. FA synthesis and uptake
  were gradually increased until HCC development, while those of well-differentiated
  HCC were the highest and decreased as the degree of differentiation progressed.
  (b) Comprehensive schematic figure showing the metabolic features in the well-differentiated
  HCC. The thick arrows represent increased biochemical reactions indicated by gene
  expression analysis. GK, glucokinase; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PEP,
  phosphoenolpyruvate; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PK, pyruvate kinase;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; IDH, isocitrate
  dehydrogenase; ACC, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; PPAR,
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase;
  HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; CPT,
  carnitine palmitoyltransferase; LCAD, long chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase;
  HADH, hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase.
