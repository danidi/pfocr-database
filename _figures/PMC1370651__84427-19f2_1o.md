caption: The proposed biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of cmo5U and mcmo5U.
  The dashed reaction arrows indicate the link between the synthesis of cmo5U and
  chorismic acid. The arrow denoted A is according to  and the arrows denoted B and
  C are the suggested link between chorismic acid and the synthesis of cmo5U34 according
  to present results. (X?) A possible unknown derivative of chorismic acid. (U) Uridine,
  (ho5U) 5-hydroxyuridine, (mo5U) 5-methoxyuridine (cmo5U) uridine-5-oxyacetic acid,
  (mcmo5U) uridine-5-oxyacetic acid methyl ester.
