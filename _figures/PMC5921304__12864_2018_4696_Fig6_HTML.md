caption: Schematic representation of metabolic enzymes belonging to the most divergent
  group (protein sequence identity) in the context of carbohydrate metabolism. Enzymatic
  mediators (italics) that were found in the divergent group in at least one Triatoma
  species (< 86% protein identity with putative R. prolixus orthologs, Rprc3.2_mapped
  dataset) are shown in green. Mediators that were not in the divergent group are
  in black, whereas those not found are labeled in grey. The glycolytic pathway is
  shown in orange. Gluconeogenesis is shown in purple, the oxidative phase of the
  pentose phosphate pathway is shown in red. The non-oxidative phase of PPP is shown
  in blue. Metabolites are shown in non italics gray. A full description of metabolic
  enzyme coding genes is described in Additional file
