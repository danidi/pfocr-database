caption: 'EGF-induced migration signaling network in (a) A431 cells, (b) EC109 cells,
  and (c) TT cells. The threshold was set at ±50% from positive control. The edge
  color is decided based on the sign of edges; red indicates positive signaling, and
  blue indicates negative signaling. The size of the node indicates the number of
  connecting edges. The color of the node indicates the number of output pathways:
  a gradient color scale from green to red, interpolated over yellow.'
