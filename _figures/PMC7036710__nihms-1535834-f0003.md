caption: Redox is a critical modality in biology. (a) Energy harvesting in respiration
  occurs through a redox pathway in which individual electrons are transferred to
  membrane components that can be switched between reduced (with electrons) and oxidized
  (without electrons) states. (b) Biosynthesis often involves the transfer of electrons
  via diffusible electron carriers (NAD(P)H) to generate more-reduced cell components.
  (c) In the inflammatory response, damaging reaction oxygen species (ROS) are generated
  by enzymatic electron transfer to partially-reduce O2. (d) Diffusible redox-signaling
  molecule (H2O2) can engage cellular signal transduction mechanisms.
