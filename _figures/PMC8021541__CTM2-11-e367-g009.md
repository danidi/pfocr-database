caption: 'In lung cancer, lncRNAs regulate chemosensitivity through various mechanisms.
  A, LncRNAs regulate chemosensitivity through different signaling pathways. P: phosphorylated.①②
  LncRNAs regulate EMT‐mediated chemosensitivity by MAPK/ERK signaling pathways.④⑤⑥
  LncRNAs regulate cancer cell stemness, EMT and chemosensitivity by regulating Wnt/β‐catenin
  signaling pathway. ③⑧ LncRNAs regulate chemosensitivity by modulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and NF‐κB signaling pathway.⑦ LncRNAs regulate chemosensitivity through modulating
  STAT3 signaling pathway.⑨⑩ LncRNAs also regulate chemosensitivity through crosstalk
  between apoptosis and autophagy. Beclin‐1 doesn''t produce two fragments named “N”
  and “C.” Beclin‐1 is activated and can induce autophagy and inhibit apoptosis regulated
  by mitochondrial pathway.②⑥⑦⑨⑩ LncRNAs sponge miRNAs and then regulate downstream
  signaling pathways. (Note: The lncRNA‐miRNA complex is regarded as a whole, and
  the arrows emitted by the complex in the figure represent that the complex promotes
  the expression of microRNA target genes. B, LncRNAs regulate autophagy‐mediated
  chemosensitivity. The process of autophagy is divided into the following five different
  stages: ①Autophagy initiation; ②Nucleation; ③Elongation; ⑤Fusion with the lysosome;
  and ⑤Degradation. LncRNAs bind to miRNAs, or directly target autophagy protein Beclin‐1
  or ATG family proteins or LC3 to regulate autophagy, thereby affecting chemosensitivity.
  C, LncRNAs regulate chemosensitivity by modulating MDR‐related genes. The ABC transporters
  not only excrete intracellular chemotherapy drugs, but also mediate lysosomal sequestration
  of chemotherapy drugs, then reducing the concentration of intracellular chemotherapy
  drugs, which makes lung cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy. LncRNAs bind to
  miRNAs or directly regulate MDR through modulating the expression of MDR‐related
  genes (MDR1, MRP1, and MRP7)'
