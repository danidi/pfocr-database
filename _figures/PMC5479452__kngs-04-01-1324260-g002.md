caption: (a-c) Drosophila neural stem cells in the central brain (a) undergo a type
  I lineage (b) or a more elaborate type II lineage (c). (e-g) Epigenetic regulation
  of Drosophila neural stem cells alters their ability to respond to Notch signaling,
  which is normally present in stem cell progeny but suppressed by Brm (e) or Osa
  (f,g), Eyeless (i,j) or other Notch pathway repressors (h).
