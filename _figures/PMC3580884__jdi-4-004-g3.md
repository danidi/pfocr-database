caption: The relationship between binding of ligands to the pattern recognition advance
  glycation end‐product receptor (RAGE), and inflammation, gene expression, oxidative
  and nitrosative stress, and damage to the macro‐ and microvasculature. Elevated
  levels of glucose bind to proteins and form advance glycation end‐products (AGEs),
  which bind to RAGEs. RAGE signaling activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate‐oxidase and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS
  increases advance oxidation protein products (AOPPs), more AGEs and AGE‐modification
  of oxidized low‐density lipoprotein (oxLDLs). Furthermore, increased ROS might deplete
  glutathione, thereby suppressing glyoxalase I activity, a mechanism favoring further
  AGE accumulation. AGEs, AOPPs, macrophage glycoprotein (MAC‐1) and AGE‐oxLDL ligands
  of RAGE sustain stimulation of RAGE, and these processes, together with increased
  ROS, activate key transcription factors, such as nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) and Egr‐1,
  which increase gene transcription factors and activate inflammatory mechanisms.
  The consequences include increased migration and activation of RAGE‐expressing neutrophils,
  monocytes, macrophages, T‐cells and dendritic cells. This results in the release
  of the pro‐inflammatory RAGE ligands S100/calgranulins and high‐mobility group protein
  box‐1 (HMGB1). In this inflammatory environment, further AGEs might be formed as
  well. Through interaction with RAGE, these ligands magnify activation of NF‐κB,
  epidermal growth factor 1 (Egr‐1) and other factors, thereby amplifying cellular
  stress and tissue damage leading to neurovascular dysfunction. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE)
  formed from cleavage of RAGE by disintegrins, such as ADAM 10, a metalloproteinase,
  and β‐ and γ‐secretases. sRAGE or a spliced variant (esRAGE) compete for binding
  of ligands to RAGE, and a deficiency could theoretically initiate the sequence of
  events activating an inflammatory cascade with an increase in the expression of
  pro‐inflammatory cytokines (E‐selectin, endothelin‐1 tissue factor, vascular endothelial
  growth factor, interleukin‐6 and tumor necrosis factor‐α) and damage to neurons,
  kidney, eye, the vasculature, and even bone. Increasing sRAGE or its administration
  could competitively reduce activation of the AGE/RAGE pathway and it consequences.
  In addition, endogenous and exogenous ligands bind to Toll‐like receptors (TLR)
  also targeting NF‐κB, as well as inducing the secretin of pro‐inflammatory cytokines,
  which activate afferent sensory neurons reaching the brainstem through axons in
  the vagus. This in turn activates the cholinergic anti‐inflammatory efferent arc,
  which inhibits response in cytokine‐producing immune cells and signals through the
  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit α7 (α7nACHR). This in turn inhibits NF‐κB
  activation. Thus, the pathways of AGE/RAGE activation of the inflammatory cascade
  and the inflammatory ligands target activation of an inflammatory cascade that can
  be abrogated by either competing with the binding of ligands to RAGE or by vagal
  activation of the anti‐inflammatory reflex. Thus, central to curtailing unbridled
  activation of the inflammatory cascade is the integrity of parasympathetic autonomic
  function or balance between the two arms of the autonomic nervous system. Reproduced

  description: The relationship between binding of ligands to the pattern recognition
    advance glycation end‐product receptor (RAGE), and inflammation, gene expression,
    oxidative and nitrosative stress, and damage to the macro‐ and microvasculature.
    Elevated levels of glucose bind to proteins and form advance glycation end‐products
    (AGEs), which bind to RAGEs. RAGE signaling activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
    phosphate‐oxidase and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS
    increases advance oxidation protein products (AOPPs), more AGEs and AGE‐modification
    of oxidized low‐density lipoprotein (oxLDLs). Furthermore, increased ROS might
    deplete glutathione, thereby suppressing glyoxalase I activity, a mechanism favoring
    further AGE accumulation. AGEs, AOPPs, macrophage glycoprotein (MAC‐1) and AGE‐oxLDL
    ligands of RAGE sustain stimulation of RAGE, and these processes, together with
    increased ROS, activate key transcription factors, such as nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB)
    and Egr‐1, which increase gene transcription factors and activate inflammatory
    mechanisms. The consequences include increased migration and activation of RAGE‐expressing
    neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T‐cells and dendritic cells. This results
    in the release of the pro‐inflammatory RAGE ligands S100/calgranulins and high‐mobility
    group protein box‐1 (HMGB1). In this inflammatory environment, further AGEs might
    be formed as well. Through interaction with RAGE, these ligands magnify activation
