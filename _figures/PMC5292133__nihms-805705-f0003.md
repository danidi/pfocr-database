caption: Network of the genes related with post-translational modification, cancer,
  and tumor morphology. Ingenuity® bioinformatics pathway analysis tool was used to
  build a gene network relative to post-translational modification, cancer, and tumor
  morphology by using all relevant genes listed from  and . Symbols for genes representing
  specific categories of cellular molecules as well as interactive relationships are
  depicted in the legend. Color gradations are based upon gene regulation at the fold
  change level. Red color represents the genes overexpressed in highly aggressive
  ovarian cancer cell lines. Green color represents the genes overexpressed in moderately
  aggressive ovarian cancer cell lines. No color represents the genes that did not
  show any differences between two cell groups
