caption: 'PSMA: A versatile tool for prostate cancer therapy. PSMA is expressed with
  high specificity at the membrane of prostate cancer cells. Through its unique position
  and enzymatic function, it constitutes a notable target for radiolabeling. Because
  of its strict correlation with AKT expression, it could prove to be the ideal tool
  for diagnosis and patient stratification. Moreover, targeting PSMA inhibits PI3K
  signaling in prostate cancer cells; thus, combinatorial approaches with androgen
  pathway inhibitors and PSMA inhibitors could lead to a powerful therapeutic tool,
  overcoming the off-target toxic effects associated with other therapies, such as
  PI3K inhibitors. Combining these two applications may pave the way toward innovative
  PSMA-targeted theranostic approaches.'
