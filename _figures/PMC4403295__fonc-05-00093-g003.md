caption: Role of the ER lipid signaling pathway. In the ER, glycerophospholipids and
  phosphatidylinositol are synthesized. Phosphatidylinositol is converted to highly
  phosphorylated forms. Conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 is promoted by PI3K, resulting
  in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell differentiation
  through the induction of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Sphingosine is also synthesized
  on the cytosolic surface of the ER through the de novo biosynthesis of ceramide.
  Both ceramide and sphingosine inhibit Akt activity via the activation of PKCδ and
  protein phosphatase 2A. Conversely, C1P and S1P antagonize the effects of ceramide
  and sphingosine and activate Akt, consequently contributing to cell survival, cell
  proliferation, and inflammation. Pro-oncogenesis-related lipids are indicated in
  red. Anti-oncogenesis-related lipids are indicated in blue.
