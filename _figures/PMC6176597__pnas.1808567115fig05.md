  the initial resveratrol producer (BTY5 harboring pTY13-HisTAL and pTacCDF-VvSTS-At4CL1m)
  on resveratrol production. The gene names written along the x axis represent the
  knockdown gene targets. CT, control (without sRNA), is noted as the gray bar. Six
  knockdown gene targets displayed as deeper red bars are selected for further experiments

  bold letters surrounded by yellow box) indicates that the corresponding gene was
  knocked down. Gray dotted lines indicate omitted pathways. Thick black arrows along
  with genes written in bold letters denote overexpressed metabolic fluxes. Red dotted
