caption: Process flow diagram of signaling pathway. Specific accumulation of ceramide
  in astrocytes can be induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), of which activation
  of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) by the A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR)/p38
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) pathway is the major mechanism for ceramide
  production. Meanwhile, the binding of the TNF-αR-RACK1-EED complex via their WD
  repeat domains with nSMase2 can initiate its activity only in part. More importantly,
  the ischemia-induced accumulation of ceramide in astrocytes can upregulate the generation
  of proinflammatory factors such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis
  factor α (TNF-α) mediated by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), leading to secondary damage
  of hippocampal neurons.
