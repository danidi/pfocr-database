caption: One of the networks of genes commonly induced in both dendritic cells and
  macrophages when infected by bacteria, in both human and mouse. The network was
  constructed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (www.ingenuity.com). The gray-colored
  nodes are genes identified by our method. White-colored nodes are genes interacting
  with commonly induced genes. Note the large fraction of the pathway recovered by
  our method. Many known immune response genes are present in this network. IL1 is
  an important mediator of inflammatory response and involved in cell proliferation,
  differentiation, and apoptosis (Mizutani et al., ; Bratt and Palmblad, ). ETS2 is
  an important transcription factor for inflammation. CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 are chemokines
  that recruite and activate leucocytes (Wolpe et al., ). The profiles for one of
  these genes, CCL5, are shown in .
