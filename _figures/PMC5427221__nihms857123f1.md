caption: The various roles of C3 in complement activation and effector functions.
  (A) Schematic representation of the complement cascade. Initiation of classical
  and lectin pathway (CP, LP) via pattern recognition molecules, and of the alternative
  pathway via tick-over or adsorption, leads to the formation of initial C3 convertases,
  which activate C3. C3 can also be cleaved directly by extrinsic proteases. Independent
  of the activation route, the cleavage product C3b can form new convertases after
  engagement of factor B and D (FB, FD), thereby fueling an amplification loop that
  leads to rapid opsonization of the target surface with C3b. Increasing C3b densities
  facilitate the formation of C5 convertases that initiate the terminal pathway with
  generation of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC) and the potent anaphylatoxin
  C5a. At the same time, C3 fragments exert direct effector functions. Although C3a
  binds to the anaphylatoxin receptor C3aR, C3b and its degradation products iC3b
  and C3dg interact with a variety of complement receptors (CR) to mediate immune
  adhesion, phagocytosis, and adaptive immune stimulation. Properdin (factor P, FP)
  enhances convertase stability, but regulators of complement activation (RCA) promote
  its decay and enable the degradation of C3b. (B) C3-induced complement initiation
  via hydrolysis in solution and physical adsorption on surfaces (i.e. “tick-over”)
  or via proposed capturing by bridging molecules such as properdin or P-selectin.
  (C) Amplification of the initial complement response, driven by the formation of
  C3bBb complexes via interaction of C3b with FB to form the pro-convertase C3bB and
  subsequent activation by FD. (D) Examples of major effector functions of C3 fragments,
  including chemotaxis and cell activation via C3a, phagocytosis of opsonized particles,
  immune adhesion and shuttling, and adaptive modulation via B-and T-cell stimulation.
  (E) Induction of the terminal pathway by increasing densities of C3b, leading to
  the generation of C5a and MAC. Ab, antibody; Ag, antigen; BCR, B-cell receptor;
