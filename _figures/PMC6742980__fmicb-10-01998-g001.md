caption: 'Strategy for modular engineering of sesquiterpenoid production in R. capsulatus.
  (A) The intrinsic terpene biosynthesis of R. capsulatus (black arrows) and implementation
  of recombinant terpene biosynthetic steps (gray arrows) is shown, schematically
  grouped in modules: The native DXP module, including the formation of name-giving
  DXP, synthesizes C5 building blocks IPP, and DMAPP from pyruvate and GAP. IPP and
  DMAPP are further naturally converted to elongated prenyl phosphates yielding GPP,
  FPP, and GGPP, and the latter represents the substrate for the formation of specific
  C40 carotenoid scaffolds of R. capsulatus. Recombinant sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis
  can be installed by conversion of FPP via respective terpene synthases (TPS) such
  as the patchoulol or valencene synthase. To increase the synthesis of plant sesquiterpenoids,
  the MVA pathway, including the formation of name-giving MVA, can be recruited as
  additional C5 building module. Here, R. capsulatus intrinsically uses acetyl-CoA
  to provide acetoacetyl-CoA, which can be converted to IPP/DMAPP by heterologous
  enzymes (of Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens). In addition, the DXP as well as the
  prenyl phosphate modules can be tuned by overexpression of typical bottleneck enzymes
  DxS, Idi and IspA (highlighted in blue). (B) Schematic representation of the plasmid
  system for the modular Pnif-based co-expression of ispA, dxs, idi and/or the MVA
  gene cluster along with the TPS genes. Length of genes is indicated in kilo base
  pairs (kb). (C) Engineering of the R. capsulatus chromosome by integration of the
  MVA gene cluster in place of the nifHDK operon under control of Pnif. See list of
  abbreviations.'
