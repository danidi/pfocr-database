caption: (A) A variety of extracellular stimuli activate NF-κB signaling via the canonical
  or non-canonical signaling pathway. The canonical pathway is activated in response
  to engagement of membrane-bound receptors of various cytokines or pathogens, such
  as TNFα, IL-1β and LPS. One characteristics of the canonical pathway is the activation
  of NEMO-containing IKK complex which can directly phosphorylate NF-κB-bound IκB
  proteins, resulting in their β-TrCP-SCF ligase –dependent polyubiquitination and
  subsequent proteasomal degradation. The activation of IKK is mediated by collaboration
  of polyubiquitin chains with a variety of linkages, including K63-, K11- and linear/M1-linkages.
  Degradation of IκBα releases NF-κB which then translocates into the nucleus and
  regulates gene transcription. The non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is activated
  by a smaller group of stimuli such as lymphotoxin-β and CD40 ligand. The engagement
  of these stimuli with their receptors leads to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
  of RING ligase TRAF3, and consequently inhibits TRAF3-dependent proteasomal degradation
  of NIK. The NIK is constitutively active and stabilization of NIK leads to activation
  of IKKα homodimer, which in turn phosphorylates p100. Phosphorylated p100 then undergoes
  proteasome-mediated partial processing, yielding the p52-RelB dimer. Subsequently,
  P52-RelB translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. (B) Genotoxic
  agents can induce nuclear DNA damage which initiates a genotoxic NF-κB signaling
  pathway from the nucleus. DNA damage may induce formation of nuclear PIDDosome and
  activation of PARP1, which both facilitate E3 PIASy-dependent sumoylation of NEMO.
  NEMO sumoylation enriches NEMO in the nucleus where it can associate with, and be
  phosphorylated by, the apical DNA damage responsive kinase ATM. Phosphorylation
  of NEMO promotes its monoubiquitination, which is required for NEMO-ATM complex
  export from the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, NEMO-ATM complex further recruits ELKS
  and facilitates K63-linked and M1-linked polyubiquitination on ELKS and NEMO, respectively,
  resulting in subsequent activation of IKK and NF-κB. Alternatively, ATM may be independently
  exported into the cytoplasm, where it associates with TRAF6 and promotes TRAF6 K63-linked
  polyubiquitination, also leading to activation of IKK and NF-κB.
