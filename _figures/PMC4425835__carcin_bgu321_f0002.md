caption: Different pathways of NF-κB activation. Classical NF-κB pathway is activated
  through phosphorylation of IκB by IKKβ. Proteasomal degradation of IκB after ubiquitination
  allows translocation of the p65/p50 dimer to the nucleus and transactivation of
  target genes. The alternative pathway utilizes NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) to activate
  IKKα, which induces proteolytic processing of p100 to p52 followed by translocation
  of RelB/p52 to the nucleus and transactivation of target genes. The atypical pathways
  include IκB degradation either through casein kinase 2/calpain- or through ATM and
  subsequent ubiquitination of NEMO to activate NF-κB-mediated transcription. Adapted
  from Hoesel and Schmid () and Godwin et al. ().
