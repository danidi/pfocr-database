caption: Accompanying NGF, BDNF, and RA, Wnt7a activated the canonical/β-catenin pathway
  via receptor Frz5 to promote neurogenesis and trigger synaptic marker (SYN1) expression.
  Furthermore, Wnt7a also triggered differentiations of cholinergic and dopaminergic
  neurons, but this effect was induced by another non-canonical/JNK pathway through
  Frz9 receptors. In this study, we showed that Wnt7a utilized two pathways to promote
  hMSC neurogenesis.
