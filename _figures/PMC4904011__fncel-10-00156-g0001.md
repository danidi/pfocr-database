caption: Protein pathway driving the migraine process at the tripartite synapse. The
  illustration depicts different proteins at the tripartite synapse possibly involved
  in glutamatergic dysfunction in migraine (see text for details). Cav2.1 (CACNA1A;
  red) dysfunction at presynaptic terminals of glutamatergic neurons leads to altered
  Ca2+ influx and enhanced glutamate release by vesicles into the synaptic cleft,
  favoring the activation and propagation of cortical spreading depression (CSD) in
  familial hemiplegic migraine 1 (FHM1). Na+/K+-ATPase (ATP1A2; green) at the astrocyte
  plasma membrane utilizes ATP hydrolysis to exchange Na+ for K+ ions, generating
  a Na+ gradient that helps to modulate the glutamate re-uptake by glial excitatory
  amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1; SLC1A3; yellow) and EAAT2 (SLC1A2; cyan). Loss-of-function
  of Na+/K+-ATPase (FHM2), as well as of EAAT1, slows the clearance of glutamate leading
  to increased cortical excitability that favors the initiation and propagation of
  CSD. The activity of EAAT2 also contributes to glutamate clearance, and is downregulated
  by mutations in astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) (MTDH; dashed line), one of the
  candidate genes emerging from genome-wide association (GWA) studies. NaV1.1 channels
  (SCN1A, FHM3; purple) are essential for the generation and propagation of action
  potentials. FHM3-associated mutations can reduce firing of inhibitory interneurons,
  or accelerate the recovery of the channel after fast inactivation, causing high-frequency
  firing of presynaptic glutamatergic neurons. PRRT2 (pink) also affects the glutamate
  signaling pathway, through defective interaction with SNAP25 (forest green) and
  the ionotropic glutamate receptor AMPA1 (termed GRIA1; gray with pale pink border),
  resulting in increased glutamate release. Defective membrane expression of the Na(+)-HCO(3)(-)
  cotransporter NBCe1 (SLC4A4; orange) may affect the uptake of HCO3- into astrocytes
  leading to altered activity of pH-sensitive NMDA receptors (gray). Both AMPA and
  NMDA receptors are also directly modulated by LRP1 (dark pink), which is cleaved
  by a metalloproteinase that is encoded by another migraine-susceptibility gene,
  MMP16 (fluorescent green). Synaptic activity is also influenced by other proteins
  thought to contribute to migraine pathophysiology, such as the nuclear transcription
  factors MEF2D and FHL5, the serine-threonine kinase TGFBR2 (aquamarine), and ASTN2
  (fuchsia), a protein related to ASTN1 (pale lilac) and thought to influence neuronal
  migration. All these mechanisms, when defective, may affect the glutamate signaling
  pathway, possibly leading to neuronal hyperexcitability predisposing to migraine.
  The illustration also shows the pathway that starts from the CSD-driven opening
  of PANX1 channels (lilac) and triggers the inflammatory cascade and subsequent trigeminovascular
  sensitization. Signaling to PANX1 leads to caspase 1 activation that, in turn, stimulates
  the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) proteins and the activation of
  the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in astrocytes. This may lead
  to local increase in vasoactive inflammatory mediators and sensitization of pain-relevant
  brainstem regions.
