caption: 'ATAs and topo I: Reinforcement of pathological functions. (A) The combination
  of TOPO I and fibroblasts could be suppressed by using brefeldin A, and oxidized
  TOPO I may have increased the antigenicity. The potential intracellular signaling
  pathway stimulated by TOPO I was the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1, c-Raf,
  ERK-1/2, and p38 MAPK, which stimulated the migration of fibroblast. Cytokine-like
  effects of TOPO I in the pathway could be inhibited by CCL21. (B) TOPO I bound to
  HS proteoglycans on the fibroblast surface, as well as the accumulation of TOPO
  I on cell surfaces by ATAs could contribute to the initiation of an inflammatory
  cascade stimulating the fibrosis. The effect could be inhibited by heparin through
  the interference with TOPO I binding and the consequent accumulation of TOPO I-ATA
  ICs could be restrained with decreased monocyte adhesion, proinflammatory factors,
  and fibrosis.'
