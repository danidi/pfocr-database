caption: The yellow frames and lines represent stage II HCC, while the dark green
  frames and lines represent stage III HCC. Blue nodes represent DNA methylation.
  Dark lines and frames represent components observed in both stage II and stage III.
  The green and red ovals represent transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs, respectively.
  The upward yellow arrowhead represents miRNA upregulation during stage III HCC,
  compared to that in stage II. The downward blue arrowhead represents miRNA downregulation
  in stage III compared to that in stage II. TRAF2, MAP2K4, MAP4K2, NFKB1, MAPKAPK2,
  DAXX, TAB2, DIT3, CDC25B, FOS, JUN, JUND, IKBKG, HSPB1, PPP3CA, and NFATC2 are involved
  in the MAPK signaling pathway during stage II HCC. The transcription factors DDIT3,
  JUN, and NFKB1 are activated by a number of stress signals including the MAPK signaling
  pathway, which induces cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. TRAF2, TNFRSF1A,
  FOS, HRAS, PDGFB, JUN, IKBKG, RAP1A, NFKB1, NFKB2, and DAXX are involved in the
  MAPK signaling pathway, whereas E2F4, GDF6, SMAD6, PPP2CB, and BMPR1B regulate the
  TGF-β pathway during stage III HCC. The transcription factors JUN, NFKB1, and E2F4
  are activated by stress signals, including the MAPK signaling and TGF-β pathways,
  inducing cellular responses such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell
  survival, and metastasis. miRNA and DNA methylation dysregulation may contribute
  to the perturbation of the MAPK and TGF-β pathway, resulting in aberrant cellular
  responses and HCC progression from stage II to stage III. Obviously, the perturbation
  of the MAPK pathway and the activation of the TGF-β pathway owing to the differences
  in epigenetic miRNA regulation and DNA methylation may be the major mechanism of
  HCC progression from stage II to stage III. DDIT3, PDGFB, and JUN were selected
  as potential drug targets to prevent the progression of HCC from stage II to stage
  III.
