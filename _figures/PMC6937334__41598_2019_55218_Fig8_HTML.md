caption: Theoretical schematic view of the synthesis of methionine and cysteine in
  Phytophthora and effects of DMTS (red) and MMTS (green). In plants, sulfide is incorporated
  by the cysteine synthase into O-acetylserine to produce cysteine (C = cysteine pathway).
  In fungi, the main pathway involves the synthesis of cystathionine from O-acetylhomoserine
  as substrate for the homoserine O-acetyltransferase. From cystathionine, the activity
  of the cystathionine γ lyase in the reverse trans-sulfuration pathway (R) results
  in cysteine production. The methionine synthesis pathway (M) involves the γ cystathionine
  synthase and the cystathionine β lyase, which synthetize homocysteine, the precursor
  for methionine. Methionine can be synthetized from homocysteine by the methionine
  synthase using folate as methyl donor or by the homocysteine S-methyltransferase
  using homocysteine and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). All reactions depicted in this
  schema are controlled by enzymes annotated in the KEGG for P. infestans. The thiosulfate
  pathway does not seem to exist in Phytophthora. Also highlighted is the significance
  of cysteine as substrate for cysteine desulfurases to produce important cofactors
  (molybdenum cofactor, Fe-S clusters) and to thiolate tRNA (MST = mercaptopyruvate
  sulfurtransferase). Glutathione, coenzyme A, taurocyamine are also important sulfur
  compound produced from cysteine in Phytophthora. Methionine, besides being an important
  amino acid for proteins, is metabolized to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which participates
  in the methylation of nucleic acids or histones, or the synthesis of polyamines.
  Modifications in protein amounts observed upon sVOC treatments are shown in red
  (DMTS) and green (MMTS).
