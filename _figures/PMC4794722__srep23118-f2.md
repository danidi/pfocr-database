caption: (A) The liver DEG interacting networks (after microarray transcriptome analysis
  of liver tissue from global Kcne2─/─ versus Kcne2+/+ mice, n = 8 mice per group)
  with the highest consistency score included beta-oxidation of fatty acids, glucose
  concentration and hepatic steatosis, with predicted hierarchical control by PPARGC1A
  (IPA software, Qiagen). (B) Real-time qPCR does not detect Kcne2 transcript expression
  in Kcne2+/+ mouse liver. Kcne2+/+ stomach tissue was used as a positive control,
  Kcne2─/─tissue as a negative control; n = 3–4 mice per group, each quantified in
  triplicate. (C) The first-ranked disease process/biological function gene set altered
  by Kcne2 deletion was Inborn error of lipid metabolism, identified by Ingenuity
  pathway analysis of hepatic transcriptome changes quantified by microarray analysis
  as in panel A (P = 5.1 × 10−7, n = 8 per genotype).
