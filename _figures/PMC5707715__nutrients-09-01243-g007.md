caption: 'Proposed mechanism of action of the phytochemical compounds of tucum-do-cerrado
  in the prevention of aging, by the upregulation SIRT1-Nrf2 pathway, attenuating
  oxidative stress and inflammation, in the liver. Tucum-do-cerrado is a source of
  phytochemical compounds, which might enter the cells and act directly as anti-inflammatory
  molecules and/or reducing agents, promoting the upregulation of the longevity protein
  SIRT1. The upregulation of SIRT1 may causes the deacetylation of Nrf2, making it
  stable and active. Nrf2 migrates to the nucleus and induces antioxidant enzymes
  and its own transcription, rising the cell antioxidant capacity. Then, by reduction
  of the ROS generation, the oxidative damages to protein and lipids are lowered and
  the inflammatory response is attenuated. The effect of tucum-do-cerrado in SIRT3
  remains to be elucidated. Ac: acetylation; IL-6: interleukin-6; Keap1: Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1; MDA: malondialdehyde; Nqo1: NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone
  1; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  SIRT1: sirtuin 1; SIRT3: sirtuin 3; SOD: superoxide dismutase; TNF-α: tumor necrosis
