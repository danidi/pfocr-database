caption: Pathway analysis of genes that changed expression before and after treatment
  with MP in resistant and in sensitive Molt-4 ALL cells. Arrows indicate genes discussed
  in the text. Forty-three probe sets (28 unique genes) were differentially expressed
  between resistant and sensitive Molt-4 ALL cells or changed expression before and
  after treatment with MP in resistant compared to sensitive Molt-4 ALL cells. These
  genes served as the input for the pathway query. Two networks were found that included
  the input genes (Network 1 shown in (A) and Network 2 in (B), respectively), genes
  labelled in green if expression decreased after MP treatment and red if expression
  increased after MP treatment and the number below the gene indicates the fold-change.
