caption: Proposed OTA biosynthetic pathway, including intermediate metabolites and
  catalytic enzymes. The process of OTA biosynthesis was confirmed as follows. Starting
  from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate was biotransformed by the
  OtaA enzyme (a polyketide synthase); then it was catalyzed to OTβ (ochratoxin β)
  by OtaC. OTβ was linked with another substrate, l-phenylalanine, by the nonribosomal
  peptide synthetase OtaB to form OTB (ochratoxin B) as the penultimate biosynthetic
  step. Finally, OTB was chlorinated by the halogenase OtaD to produce OTA.
