caption: In normal cells, p53 suppresses glycolysis by inducing expression of TIGAR
  and inhibiting expression of glycolytic genes such as hexokinase II, phosphoglycerate
  mutase, and glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3). p53 also inhibits the diversion of glucose
  flux to the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by binding to and inhibiting
  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Loss-of-function of p53 in tumor cells
  increases glucose uptake, aerobic glycolysis, and PPP flux. PPP flux produces reducing
  agents for macromolecule biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) neutralization.
  2∼5% glucose is shunted to the HBP that produce UDP-GlcNAc, a substrate for OGT.
  OGT inhibits ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53 by direct O-GlcNAcylation. OGT
  also potentiates NF-κB signaling by O-GlcNAcylation and activation of IKKβ, which
  triggers phosphorylation of IκBα and releasing of NF-κB to the nucleus to promote
  transcription of glucose transporters and HIF-1. HIF-1 increases expression of glycolytic
  genes to promote tumor growth. Finally, O-GlcNAcylation of the critical glycolytic
  enzyme PFK-1 reduces its enzyme activity (red arrow) and redirects glucose flux
  through the PPP, thereby conferring a selective growth advantage on cancer cells.
