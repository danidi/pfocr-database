caption: Hunger-based control of feeding circuits. (a) In adult flies, hunger modulates
  GRNs (orange, green and red) and SEZ neurons (light blue) to promote food intake.
  Starvation increases the release of NPF, which indirectly activates the dopaminergic
  TH-VUM neurons that in turn potentiate sweet taste-responsive Gr5a neurons via the
  dopamine receptor DopEcR. Starvation also increases the release of AKH, which indirectly
  activates sNPF-releasing LNCs. sNPF then activates as yet unknown GABAergic neurons
  that inhibit the bitter taste-responsive Gr66a neurons. The same GABAergic neurons
  may also inhibit OA-VL neurons that can potentiate Gr66a neurons by releasing tyramine
  (TA) and octopamine (OA). In addition, starvation potentiates yeast taste-responsive
  Ir76 neurons, Fdg command neurons, cholinergic IN1 neurons, and AKHR-expressing
  ISNs to promote food intake. Starvation also positively regulates DH44 neurons that
  promote feeding (via DH44R1-expressing neurons) in response to post-ingestive amino
  acid and nutritious sugar signals. Dashed lines indicate the regulation is indirect
  or its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. a.a., amino acids. (b) In the
  adult central brain, protein starvation (and particularly lack of glutamine) activates
  dopaminergic DA-WED neurons, which activate FB-LAL neurons to promote protein intake
  while inhibiting PLP neurons that promote sugar consumption. (c) In fly larvae,
  hunger increases feeding tolerance through an NPF pathway, while also enhancing
  feeding rate via OA neurons. Two populations of OA neurons, OA-VUM1 and OA-VUM2,
  act, respectively, through OAMB- and Octβ3R-expressing neurons to contrastingly
  regulate feeding rate. Additionally, DILPs (release of which is inhibited by hunger)
  also negatively regulate feeding tolerance and feeding rate. DILPs regulate feeding
  tolerance via NPFR neurons, but whether they regulate feeding rate through the OA
  neurons remains to be determined.
