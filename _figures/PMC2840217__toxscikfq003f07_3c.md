caption: Changes in cell cycle regulation in response to MG132 (A), methylmercury
  (MeHg, B), and cadmium (Cd, C) in MEF cells. Cell cycle regulation pathway was modified
  from KEGG in GenMAPP program. Differential gene expression was based on treatment
  versus control expression change (1.5-fold and p ≤ 0.05, t-test). Red indicates
  a higher level of expression in the treatment. Green indicates decreased level of
  expression in the treatments. Gray indicates that the selection criteria were not
  met, but the gene is represented on the array. White boxes indicate that the gene
  was not present on the chip. Both Cd and MG132 treatment in MEF cell induced significant
  upregulation of Mdm2, Skp2, and Gadd45 and downregulation of genes mainly involving
  in G2/M phase transition, such as cyclin B1/B2, cyclin A2, Cdk1, Cdc20, Cdc25c,
  Cdc25b, Chk2, Mad2l1, and Bub1.
