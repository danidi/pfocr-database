caption: A. Pathways in cell lines with and without constitutive pAKT expression.
  The left column shows pathway activation in AKT OFF cell lines and the right column
  in AKT ON cell lines. The phosphorylation of S6 was equally strong in AKT ON and
  AKTOFF cell lines. In the AKT OFF cell lines, both MEK and PI3K/mTOR mediate pS6
  phosphorylation. In the AKT ON cell lines, the AKT pathway is dominant and MEK pathway
  has a lesser effect.B. Regulation of two phosphorylation sites on S6 by MEK. Inhibition
  of MEK affected both phosphorylation sites in AKT OFF cell lines (thick red bars).
  In AKT ON cell lines, U0126 was more effective at the Ser235/236 site than the Ser240/244
  site (thin and dotted red bars, respectively), but overall U0126 was less effective
  in AKT ON compared to AKT OFF cell lines.
