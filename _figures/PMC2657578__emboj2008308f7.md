caption: The p18–MEK–ERK pathway in the intracellular organelle dynamics. A schematic
  model of p18 function. p18 serves as a lipid raft anchor for p14–MP1–MEK1 signalling
  components on late endosomes. The loss of p18 function or the inhibition of MEK
  activity causes defects in membrane dynamics, including Rab11-mediated endosome
  recycling and lysosome processing. From these observations, it is suggested that
  the p18–MEK–ERK pathway anchored to intracellular lipid rafts takes part in controlling
  intracellular membrane dynamics potentially by regulating organelle interactions
  and/or transports along cytoskeletons. MTOC, microtubule organizing centre; PNRC,
  perinuclear recycling compartment.
