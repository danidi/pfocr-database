caption: Schematic diagram of GA metabolism and signaling pathways in rice. Bioactive
  GAs are shown in black rectangles. For each step in the metabolic pathway, the reaction
  is highlighted in color. GA7 (13-nonhydroxy GA3) is biosynthesized from GA9 in a
  similar pathway to the synthesis of GA3 from GA20, but it is not shown here. EUI
  is a P450 designated as CYP714D1 that preferentially epoxidizes the 16,17-double
  bond of non-13-hydroxylated GAs, including GA4, GA9, and GA12, to deactivate them,
  and only the reaction on GA4 is shown here. Bioactive GAs are perceived by the soluble
  GA receptor GID1 (). SLR1, a DELLA protein, acts as a negative regulator of the
  GA responses (). SLR1 within the GA-GID1-SLR1 complex is degraded through the SCFGID2
  complex, resulting in GA responses (; ). Apart from these signaling factors, the
  α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (Gα) is suggested to function as a positive
  regulator of GA signaling (). GGDP, Geranylgeranyl diphosphate.
