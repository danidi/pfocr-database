caption: The Toll, Imd and JAK-STAT immune signaling pathways. Upon the recognition
  of bacteria or Plasmodium, the Toll pathway is stimulated by the binding of the
  ligand Spätzle with the Toll transmembrane receptor. This triggers a series of molecular
  events that culminate in the activation and translocation of Rel1 into the nucleus,
  upregulating the transcription of immune genes that are responsible for microbial
  killing. Numerous studies conducted in Anopheles have highlighted the Imd pathway
  as the most efficient immune pathway in the defense against the human malaria parasite,
  P. falciparum. The Imd pathway is stimulated when the transmembrane PGRP-LC receptor
  recognizes bacteria or Plasmodium. This leads to a signaling cascade that will result
  in the cleavage of Rel2-F and the translocation of active Rel2-S into the nucleus,
  upregulating the transcription of immune genes. The JAK-STAT immune signaling pathwayhas
  been implicated in antibacterial, antiviral and antiplasmodial defense in mosquitoes.
  The JAK-STAT pathway is initiated by the binding of the cytokine ligand UPD to the
  transmembrane receptor DOME. This then leads to the eventual nuclear translocation
  of STAT and transcriptional activation of immune effector genes.
