caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanism by which NKILA regulates
  osteogenesis. During osteogenesis of MSCs, the lncRNA NKILA is induced and plays
  a critical positive role in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation. As a crucial
  repressor of NF‐κB signalling, NKILA can block the recruitment of NF‐κB to promoter
  of the osteogenic regulator RUNX2 and subsequently restrains NF‐κB‐mediated HDAC2
  deacetylation modification at H3K27 site, epigenetically activating RUNX2 gene transcription.
  On the other hand, NKILA is involved in the regulation of RXFP1/AKT signalling pathway.
  NKILA can positively regulate RXFP1 expression, therefore elevating the activity
  of its downstream regulator AKT, a crucial positive signalling during osteogenesis.
  Overall, NKILA promotes osteogenic differentiation, at least in part, via NF‐κB
  and RXFP1/AKT signalling
