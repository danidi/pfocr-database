caption: Model of the effect of ethylene on the alleviation of chilling injury via
  ERF signaling pathway. The genes, enzymes and processes in red denote promotive
  effects of ethylene, with those in green refer to inhibitive effects, as indicated
  by difference analysis for gene expression and metabolites using one-way ANOVA.
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PL, phospholipid. Other abbreviations are defined in
  the legends to , ,  and .
