caption: Changes in the purine pathway associated with CE grown (14 days) in different
  levels of lead acetate. The metabolites not measured are grayed-out in smaller font.
  The measured metabolites from the nematode populations are in larger black font.
  If there is no significant change in the metabolite when compared to the untreated,
  the color remains unchanged (black). If the metabolite concentration is blue it
  denotes a decrease in concentration compared to the untreated nematodes. A red metabolite
  concentration denotes an increase in concentration compared to the untreated nematode
