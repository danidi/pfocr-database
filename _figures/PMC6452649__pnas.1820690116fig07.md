caption: Schematic model depicting RARα’s involvement in regulation of intracellular
  signaling, protein synthesis, and synaptic plasticity in postsynaptic neurons. In
  addition to its known function in suppressing GluA1 protein synthesis, RARα, through
  an unknown mechanism, clamps the ERK/mTOR activation pathway in response to intracellular/extracellular
  inputs triggered by environmental enrichment, thus stabilizing LTP. In the absence
  of RARα, GluA1 protein synthesis is derepressed. Moreover, the ERK/mTOR pathway
  is overactivated by environmental enrichment, leading to enhanced GluA1 and GluA2
  synthesis and greater LTP. Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain.
