caption: Pexophagy in yeast and mammals. (A) In yeast, Atg37 positively regulates
  the formation of RPC. Atg30 selectively degrades peroxisomes in a Pex3 and Atg37
  dependent manner, by recruiting Atg8 and Atg11 to the RPC. Moreover, Atg30 is phosphorylated
  by Hrr25 kinase, and this phosphorylation can be regulated by Pex3 and Atg37, negatively
  and positively, respectively. Since Atg37 also functions as an Ac binding protein,
  Ac might regulate the Atg30-Atg37 interaction, hence affects the recruitment of
  Atg11 to the pexophagic RPC. (B) Pexophagy in mammals. Under normal conditions,
  a low PEX2 expression level is maintained via the mTORC1-mediated proteasome pathway.
  (1) Increased PEX2 during starvation conditions leads to the ubiquitination of PEX5
  and PMP70, and ultimately induces pexophagy in an NBR1-dependent manner. On the
  other hand, USP30 counteracts PEX2 by deubiquitinating its substrates to prevent
  pexophagy. (2) ATM serine/threonine kinase is the first responder to peroxisomal
  ROS. The activated ATM kinase activates TSC2, and the activated TSC2 suppresses
  mTORC1. (3) ATM also phosphorylates PEX5 at Ser141, which triggers ubiquitination
  of PEX5 at Lys209. Ubiquitinated PEX5 is then bound by P62/NBR1 to induce pexophagy
  in response to ROS. The dashed box represents ubiquitin-dependent recognition of
  peroxisomes for pexophagy. The pexophagy target is PEX5 mono-ubiquitinated on Cys11.
  After cargo delivery, PEX1 and PEX6 (anchored on peroxisomes via PEX26) will remove
  ubiquitinated PEX5 from the peroxisomal membrane. ACBD5 is the only pexophagy-specific
  protein known to date. ACBD5 might be involved in the recruitment of pexophagy-specific
  receptors or adapters.
