number: Figure 1
caption: The figure summarizes the potential diet—epigenetic axis in T1DM development.
  The intake of unhealthy diet may lead to T1DM development through epigenetic modifications
  (DNA methylation, miRNA, and histone modifications). Diet nutrients can contribute
  to the hypermethylation and subsequent downregulation of IRS-2 leading to insulin
  deficiency. In addition, diet can contribute to the up- and down-regulation of certain
  miRNAs activates NF-kB pathway and the activation of the inflammatory response.
  The role of histone modification in T1DM is explicated mainly through elevating
  the expression of H3K9Ac and H4 in the promoter region of Foxp3. Finally, unhealthy
  diet affects the gut microbiota and its metabolites, such as SCFA. The failure of
  SCFA binding to the free fatty acid receptors 2/3 (FFAR2 and FFAR3) due to its absence
  or reduction, leads to the activation of histone deacetylase (HDAC1, HDAC3) and
  the inflammatory cascade that contribute to β-cell depletion and T1DM development
  (Created using Biorender.com).
