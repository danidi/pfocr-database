caption: 'Functional significance of several key genes from four KEGG pathways differentially
  expressed in female and male magpies. The proteins encoded by genes marked in blue
  were upregulated in female birds, whereas genes upregulated in male birds are in
  red. a The relationship between the key DEGs and stress resistance excerpted from
  the FOXO signaling pathway (ko04068) shown in Additional file : Figure S2; the JNK
  stress resistance gene was upregulated in females, and the SIRT1 stress resistance
  gene was upregulated in males. b The relationship between the key DEGs and energy
  metabolism excerpted from the AMPK signaling pathway (ko04152) shown in Additional
  file : Figure S3; females enhanced AMPK and G6Pase to regulate energy metabolism.
  c The relationship between the key DEGs and the immune system excerpted from the
  Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathway (ko04658) and the Th17 cell differentiation
  pathway (ko04659) shown in Additional file : Figure S4A and S4B, respectively; females
  upregulated MHC II, JNK, and SMADs to promote the differentiation of Th1/Th2 and
  Th17 cells, whereas males inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells through Th1
  cells. d The relationship between key DEGs and longevity excerpted from the longevity
  regulating pathway (ko04211) and the longevity regulating pathway worm (ko04212)
  shown in Additional file : Figure S5A and S5B, respectively; females regulated longevity
  through the AMPK energy metabolism and JNK stress resistance pathways, whereas males
  regulated longevity through CREB and SIRT1 stress resistance genes. Boxes represent
  signal pathways or gene products (i.e., proteins or RNA); solid arrows represent
  interactions and relationships between molecules; dotted arrows represent indirect
  or unknown relationships; the double helix represents DNA, circles represent molecules
  as indicated, and + P represents the process of phosphorylation. JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
