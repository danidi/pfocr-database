caption: 'T-cell polarizing factors. T-cell receptors (TCRs) on the naïve T-cell (Th0)
  bind to antigen presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which leads to the
  tyrosine phosphorylation of immuno-receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs).
  This induces the release of adaptor molecules [e.g. linker for activated T cells
  (LAT), protein kinase C], which results in the sequential activation of GTPases,
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which
  induces T-cell proliferation (a) Upon T-cell activation, phospholipase C (PLC) activity
  is induced, which breaks down membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate
  (PIP2) into the intracellular second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces calcium release, which results in cytokine
  expression, and DAG stimulates protein kinase C and causes T-cell activation through
  the MAPK pathway. The type of cytokine expressed is the most important factor influencing
  the phenotype of the developing T cells. Cytokines bind to their receptors on Th0
  cells and activate Janus kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription
  (JAK-STAT) pathways. Different combinations of JAK and STAT molecules are generated
  in response to different cytokines and induce different signaling cascades, which
  drive the development of the specific T-cell phenotype. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and
  interleukin (IL)-12 induce JAK1/2 and STAT1/3/4 to stimulate T-bet and further IFN-γ
  production, resulting in a T helper type-1 (Th1) response, whereas IL-4 triggers
  JAK1/3 and STAT6 to activate GATA-3 and a T helper type-2 (Th2) response. Features
  of Th1 cells: Th1 cytokines; increased Ca2+, IFN-γ and IL-12; decreased protein
  kinase C and GATA-3 (IFN-γ and IL-12 mediated). Features of Th2 cells: Th2 cytokines;
  increased monocytic chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and protein kinase C; decreased
  Ca2+. CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated
  T cells.'
