caption: The broken arrow indicates possible stimulatory pathways that signal maturation.
  The consequences of Ca2+signaling are presently unknown. Although AKT is involved
  in cell survival, the function in granulosa cells is still unclear. An inhibitory
  pathway indicated by a question mark and leading to decreased cGMP, is inferred
  from the data shown in .
