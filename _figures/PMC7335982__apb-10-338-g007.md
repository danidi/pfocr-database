caption: Preservation of CSCs in the tumor, depends on the microenvironment of cancer
  and recently it is defined as a novel pharmaceutical target. Indeed, a suitable
  niche has been provided by (a) immune cell secretion, conclude in chronic inflammation,
  (b) perivascular space involved in proliferation and differentiation and, (c) finally
  routine hypoxia which is known as a critical issue in the growth of CSCs (). The
  Stat3/ NF-κB signaling pathway is activated by secreted cytokines such as IL-1β,
  IL-6 and IL-8 and modification in a positive way leads to CSCs stemness preservation,
  neovascularization and metastasis., Molecular modification of the tumor microenvironment
  can block the growth of CSCs. Repertaxin as an inhibitor of IL-8 increase chemotherapy
  efficiency and diminishing tumor size. Here also combinatorial therapy makes the
  curing process more effective than before multiple biological approaches by using
  IL-6 and IL-8 inhibitors or HIF pathway blocking. It seems there is more detail
  information about signaling pathways needed to overcome CSCs microenvironment suitability.
