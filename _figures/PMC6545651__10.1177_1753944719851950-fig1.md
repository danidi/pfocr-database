caption: An overview of the proposed mechanism by which inflammation promotes the
  development of both depression and cardiovascular disease in women.Risk exposures
  promote the disruption of several biological systems, including the HPA axis, RAAS,
  and serotonin/kynurenine metabolism pathway, which leads to inflammatory changes.
  It is hypothesized that women experience a greater amount of risk exposures, and
  when coupled with altered biological systems, produces a heightened pro-inflammatory
  state that contributes to the development and reinforcement of a cycle linking depression
  and cardiovascular disease.CRP, C-reactive protein; CVD, cardiovascular disease;
  HPA, hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal; IFN, interferon; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
  system; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
