caption: A model for Src-induced tumorigenesis by JNK-dependent Hippo pathway regulation.
  A cell with elevated Src expression activates the Rac-Dia and the Ras-MAPK pathways,
  which cooperate to cause Yki activation through the Hippo pathway. At the same time,
  Src activates JNK signalling that causes propagation of Yki activity to neighbouring
  cells (left, non-autonomous growth). Blocking JNK signalling in a Src-expressing
  cell cancels the propagation of Yki activity and leads to autonomous activation
  of Yki (right, autonomous growth). See text for details. MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.
