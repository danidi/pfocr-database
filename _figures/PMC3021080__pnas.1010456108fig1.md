caption: Strategy for simultaneous cofermentation of cellobiose and xylose without
  glucose repression. (A) A strain improvement strategy to engineer yeast capable
  of fermenting two nonmetabolizable sugars (cellobiose and xylose). The cellodextrin
  assimilation pathway consists of a cellodextrin transporter (cdt-1) and an intracellular
  β-glucosidase (gh1-1) from the filamentous fungus N. crassa. The modified xylose
  metabolic pathway utilizes xylose reductase isoenzymes (wild-type XR and a mutant
  XRR276H), xylitol dehydrogenase (XYL2), and xylulokinase (XKS1) from the xylose-fermenting
  yeast P. stipitis. (B) Schematic fermentation profile of a sugar mixture containing
  glucose and xylose by the engineered S. cerevisiae. Glucose fermentation represses
  xylose fermentation completely so that xylose fermentation begins only after glucose
  depletion (analogous fermentation result shown in A). (C) Schematic fermentation
  profile of a sugar mixture containing cellobiose and xylose by the engineered S.
  cerevisiae. Cellobiose and xylose are simultaneously utilized, as neither carbon
  source represses consumption of the other (analogous fermentation result shown in
  B).
