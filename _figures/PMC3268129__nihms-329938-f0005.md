caption: Grey arrows indicate information from gene neighborhoods and blue arrows
  indicate information derived from domain architectures. The direction of the arrows
  shows the order of genes in operons from 5′ to 3′, or order of domains from N-terminal
  to C-terminal. Domains that share the same fold are shown in the same shape and
  color. Thus, ATP-grasps are colored magenta, glutamine synthetases green, tranglutaminases
  orange, M20 peptidases purple, NTN hydrolase fold peptidases blue, Flavodoxin fold
  GAT-I family red, and Mur ligases olive green. The shape of the domains corresponds
  to their functional role. For example, peptidases are shown as colored hexagons
  and the PLPDE-dependent enzymes in colored octagons. Domains are further grouped
  in two distinct themes. The principal domains that share a common fold are enclosed
  in colored oval shapes with light background and dotted lines and the corresponding
  nodes in darker shades of the same color. Further domains involved in a common pathway
  are enclosed within a grey background and dotted lines. Standard abbreviations have
  been used for gene names. The  gives a full list of the abbreviations.
