caption: Proposed signal transduction cascade of PAR-1, PAR-2 and PAR-3 in Adult HCAECs.
  In adult HCAECs, PAR-1 and PAR-2 couple to both Gq and G12/13 to regulate the signaling
  pathways that phosphorylate eNOS and cause NO production. A Ca2+-dependent-mediated
  mechanism, which is coupled to Gq, leads to the phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser-1177
  and causes an increase in NO production. A ROCK-dependent pathway, which is coupled
  to G12/13, leads to eNOS-Thr-495 phosphorylation and a decrease in NO production.
  PAR-3 activation is coupled to G12/13 and the ROCK signaling pathway, which leads
  to a suppression of NO production via phosphorylation of eNOS-Thr-495. (A color
  version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
