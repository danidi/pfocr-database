caption: The process diagram of the EPO-induced JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway model
  is shown according to Systems Biology Graphical Notation. The binding of the ligand
  EPO to its cognate receptor results in the phosphorylation of first JAK2 and then
  of the EPOR (pEPORpJAK2). STAT5 is recruited by pEPOR and phosphorylated by pJAK2
  and translocates to the nucleus where it induces the transcription of the negative
  feedback regulators CISH mRNA and SOCS3 mRNA. Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)
  regulates the dephosphorylation of the EPOR-JAK2 complex.
