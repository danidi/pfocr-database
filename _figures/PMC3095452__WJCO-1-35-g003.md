caption: Proposed mechanism of procathepsin D/cathepsin D function in cancer progression.
  The over-expressed procathepsin D (pCD) escapes the physiological intracellular
  targeting pathways and is secreted by the cancer cells. Small part of secreted pCD
  is bound and internalized via M6PR pathway, the rest by a yet unidentified receptor.
  The receptor-pCD interaction activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
  pathway with subsequent changes in expression of numerous cancer-promoting genes
  including NFKB2 and some cytokines. Interaction of pCD with endothelial and stromal
  cells is also involved.
