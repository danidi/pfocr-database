caption: Proposed mechanisms involved in the anti-fibrotic activity of ellagic acid.
  Ellagic acid can reduce the myeloperoxidase activity and collagen content. Moreover,
  it attenuates the expression of TGF-β1 as well as modulates its downstream signaling
  pathway. The amount of α-SMA and macrophages monocytes (ED)-positive cells is decreased
  after treating with ellagic acid, and it inhibits ROS production that is stimulated
  by TNF-β1 and PDGF. Other than these, ellagic acid can downregulate α-SMA and collagen
  genes (α1(I) procollagen and α1(III) procollagen). In PC cells, ellagic acid can
  decrease the NF-κB transcriptional activity and stimulate apoptosis and reduce cell
  proliferation.
