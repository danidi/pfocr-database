caption: Putative PGC-1-mediated mechanism of cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting.
  In this model, significant down-regulation of PGC-1ß expression causes dysregulation
  of mitochondria, resulting in reduced ATP synthesis and increased ROS production,
  most likely due to PGC-1-dependent upregulation of UCPs. Meanwhile, reduced PGC-1ß
  gene expression levels result in a failure to down-regulate expression of FoXO3α,
  which normally suppresses atrogen expression and proteolysis. Insulin-stimulated
  IGF-1/AKT pathway signaling is also significantly attenuated. Thus, AKT does not
  phosphorylate FoXOs and, consequently, favors further upregulation of atrogenes,
  thus leading to skeletal muscle wasting. Moreover, reduced IGF-1/AKT signaling further
  facilitates protein translation inhibition due to mTOR inactivation which also results
  in cachexia. Meanwhile, PGC-1ß may affect IGF-1 and IRS-1 expression thereby producing
  insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1; IGF-1,
  insulin-like growth factor 1; PGC-1s, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
  coactivators-1; UCPs, uncoupling proteins; FoXOs, forkhead box O proteins; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB.
