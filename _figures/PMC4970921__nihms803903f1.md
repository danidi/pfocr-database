caption: Microarray and bioinformatics analysis of tendon fibroblasts treated with
  PRP or PPP. (A) Microarray analysis identified 3296 genes of 36685 that were significantly
  different (P<0.05) between PRP and PPP treated cells. Of the 3296 genes that were
  significantly different, 315 genes were greater than 1.5 fold upregulated and 460
  genes were greater than 1.5 fold downregulated in PRP treated cells compared to
  PPP. (B) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified two pathways that were predicted
  to be highly activated in cells treated with PRP compared to PPP, the TNFα pathway
  (P=6.6×10−6) and the NFκB pathway (P=9.5×10−19). The merged pathways are presented.
