caption: The Role of Intact and Impaired Efferocytosis in Prostate CancerMFG-E8-mediated
  efferocytosis can induce M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages through
  the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway. Additionally, cytokines CXCL5 and IL-6 enhance M2 polarization,
  leading to tumor growth and bone metastasis of prostate cancer. Impairing efferocytosis
  by trabectedin administration or CXCL5 deficiency can suppress tumor size and bone
  metastasis.
