caption: Schematic model of the study. Infection of H. pylori enhanced Nurr1 expression
  by PI3K/AKT-Sp1 signaling pathway and Sp1 directly transcriptionally activated Nurr1
  expression. Nurr1 bound to the promoter of CDK4 and increased its expression. In
  this study, we revealed the mechanism through which Nurr1 was upregulated and how
  Nurr1 promoted GC cells proliferation. Therefore, Nurr1 might be a new target for
  the diagnosis and treatment of GC.
