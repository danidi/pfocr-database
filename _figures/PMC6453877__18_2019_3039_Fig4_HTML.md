caption: HIF-mediated regulation of mitochondrial mass. The HIF pathway reduces mitochondrial
  number in the cell by suppressing mitochondrial biogenesis and increasing mitochondrial
  degradation through mitophagy. Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by the PGC-1α
  pathway, which upregulates mitochondrial proteins required for expression of genes
  encoded by the mitochondrial genome, such as TFAM and POLRMT. This is achieved through
  HIF-dependent upregulation of two negative regulators of PGC-1α activity, namely
  MXI1, which inhibits C-MYC-directed PGC-1α expression, and DEC1, which inhibits
  PGC-1α transcription by binding to its promoter. HIF signalling also upregulates
  the expression of two related proteins expressed on the mitochondrial outer membrane,
  namely BNIP3 and NIX (BNIP3L). These proteins flag mitochondria for degradation
  by the autophagy pathway
