caption: 'Corresponding components in Drosophila and mammals are shown in the same
  color. The abbreviations used are as follows: Ex (Expanded), Mer (Merlin, also called
  NF2), Hpo (Hippo), Sav (Salvador), Mats (Mob as tumor suppressor), Wts (Warts),
  Yki (Yorkie), Sd (Scalloped), Mst (Mst1/2, also called STK4 and STK3, Hpo homolog),
  WW45 (Sav homolog), Mob (Mps One Binder kinase activator-like 1A/B, MOBKL1A/B, Mats
  homolog), Lats (Lats1/2, Wts homolog), YAP (Yes-associated protein, Yki homolog),
  TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif, also called WWTR1, Yki
  homolog), and TEAD (TEA domain family member 1/2/3/4). Dashed arrows indicate unknown
  biochemical mechanism and question marks denote unknown components.'
