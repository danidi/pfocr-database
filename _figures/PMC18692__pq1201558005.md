caption: An NAD+ salvage pathway important for transcriptional silencing in yeast.
  The diagram indicates the enzymatic steps known to occur in synthesis of NAD+. For
  the part of the pathway conserved in Salmonella, the names of the relevant genes
  proposed or known to carry out each step are given in lowercase letters inside the
  circle, and the relevant yeast ORFs are written in uppercase. NaMN, nicotinic acid
  mononucleotide; NaAD, desamido NAD+; Nam, nicotinamide; Na, nicotinic acid.
