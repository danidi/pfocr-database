caption: 'Two mechanisms of the effects of autophagy on NLRP3 inflammasome in metabolic
  disorders. There are two mechanisms of the effects of autophagy on NLRP3 inflammasome:
  one is that autophagy inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome by scavenging ROS from damaged
  mitochondria. Mitochondria-derived ROS can activate NF-κβ pathway to promote the
  transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β, thus activating NLRP3 inflammasome. The other
  is that autophagy inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome through degrading inflammasome components
  such as pro-IL-1β, NLRP3, caspase-1, or ASC. ROS, Reactive oxygen species; NF-κβ,
  nuclear factor kappa-B; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein.'
