caption: 'The lifecycle of cardiac Nav1.5 and potential phenotypic modifiers. The
  lifecycle starts with SCN5A gene transcription in the nucleus, which can be regulated
  by transcription factors, such as FOXO1, NF-κB, and TBX5. The next steps are protein
  translation and assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Appropriately
  folded Nav1.5 protein is trafficked to the cell membrane, whereas misfolded protein
  (as a result of mutations and splicing variants) can activate the PERK pathway of
  the unfolded protein response to downregulate the SCN5A mRNA level. microRNAs also
  regulate the SCN5A mRNA level. Channel trafficking can be modulated by PKA, PKC,
  and caveolae. After being expressed on the cell membrane, NaChIPs join the α and
  β subunits to form a macromolecular complex, which can be regulated by PKA, PKC,
  oxidative stress (ROS), and metabolic states (NADH and NAD+). Eventually, the channel
  will go through ubiquitin-mediated degradation, which can be regulated by NEDD4.
