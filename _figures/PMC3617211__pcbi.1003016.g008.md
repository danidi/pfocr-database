caption: 'A) Multiple post-translational protein modifications (phosphorylation followed
  by ubiquitination; acetylation followed by phosphorylation; sumotargeted ubiquitination,
  etc.). M1 and M2 represent two types of post-translational modifications. MOD1–4
  represent enzymes catalyzing the reactions. Kinetic trapping of an intermediate
  modification can drastically disturb the balance between signaling pathways (e.g.
  #23 in ) B) Protein folding control by chaperones. Protein folding is controlled
  by chaperones (#18 in ) and may generate partially unfolded proteins as toxic intermediates
  which are subject to degradation . Regulation of protein folding homeostasis is
  essential for protein pool control ; C) Lack of balance between production and detoxification
  of ROS leads to significant increases or drop in ROS levels that can be detrimental
  for cell signaling – (#19 in ). D) Coordinated sumoylation-desumoylation is important
  for proper signal propagation –. E) Glycan biosynthesis and protein glycosylation
  depend on the availability of common carrier dolichol phosphate (P-DOL). Correct
  recycling of P-DOL is important for sustaining the pool and utilization of this
  carrier in other glycans biosynthesis pathways. Kinetic trapping can consume the
  pool of P-DOL and perturb cell signaling ,  (#2, 3 and 26 in ) F) Protein ubiquitylation
  is not only a tagging signal for degradation, but also involved in signaling. The
  correct tuning between two functions of ubiquitylation depends on the type and the
  length of ubiquitin (UB) polymer transferred to the protein and at the ubiquitylation
  site . Monoubiquitylated proteins participate in signal transduction , , whereas
  K48-polyubiquitylated proteins are redirected to the proteasome for proteolysis.
  Thus, the balance between protein homeostasis and ubiquitin-dependent signaling
  is essential .'
