caption: Application of metabolomics methods to the pancreatic islet has resulted
  in identification of mechanisms that may complement the classical KATP-channel-dependent
  pathway for GSIS. This includes a pathway initiated by anaplerotic metabolism of
  glucose-derived pyruvate through pyruvate carboxylase (PC), egress of citrate, isocitrate,
  and a-ketoglutarate from the mitochondria to the cytosol via the citrate/isocitrate
  carrier (CIC), engagement of isocitrate with the cytosolic, NADP-dependent isoform
  of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) and reduction of glutathione to GSH by glutathione
  reductase. A second pathway involving metabolism of glucose through the pentose
  monophosphate shunt, including the first two NAPDH producing steps glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), results in a
  sharp increase in adenylosuccinate (S-AMP) produced from IMP via the adenylosuccinate
  synthase (ADSS) reaction. Importantly, intermediates generated by either the isocitrate/GSH
  (isocitrate, NADPH, GSH) or S-AMP (S-AMP) pathways stimulate exocytosis in permeabilized
  human β-cells and rescue loss of glucose regulation in β-cells from humans with
  type 2 diabetes. Also for both pathways, the effects on exocytosis require expression
  of the insulin granule desumoylating enzyme SENP1. Also shown, metabolomics has
  identified two metabolites associated with risk of type 2 diabetes that modulate
  β-cell function, 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA), which enhances insulin secretion at
  basal glucose levels, and the fatty acid furan metabolite, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-
  furanpropanoic acid (CMPF), which impairs glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.
