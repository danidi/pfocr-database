caption: LRP5, LRP6 and LRP4 are important components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. Under normal conditions, Sclerostin, Dkk1 and sFRP-1 inhibit β-catenin
  signaling through their interactions with the LRPs. Human mutations in the Sost
  (produces sclerostin) and Dkk1 genes give rise to increased bone mass. sFRP-1 loss
  in mice also results in increased bone mass. Human mutations in LRP5 that result
  in a gain-of-function give rise to conditions of high bone mass (HBM), whereas loss-of-function
  mutations give rise to osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) and its associated
  juvenile onset osteoporosis and progressive blindness, which is recapitulated in
  mice. Homozygous loss of LRP6 in mice results in a lethal phenotype and skeletal
  patterning defects. The ringleschwanz (rs) allele in mice results in multiple dysmorphologies
  and low bone mass. LRP4 deletion mutations result in polysyndactyly and low bone
  mass in mice and the Cenani-Lenz syndrome in humans. Downstream of the LRPs is the
  key signaling molecule β-catenin, which in various studies has been shown to be
  important in osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis in osteoblasts.
  In osteocytes, β-catenin signaling is important in the regulation of apoptosis and
  in the response of bone to mechanical loading and can affect osteoblast function
  through its production of sclerostin, Dkk1, sFRP-1 and Wnt proteins. Targeted loss
  of β-catenin in osteoblasts and osteocytes results in a dramatic increase in osteoclast
  activity, perhaps through increased RANKL production, which ultimately produces
  a dramatically decreased bone mass. (See text for more details and references.)
