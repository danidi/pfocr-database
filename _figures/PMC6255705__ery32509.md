caption: 'Schematic representation of metabolic reprogramming caused by the DAPAT
  mutation during diurnal cycle. Despite lower stomatal conductance, biochemical changes
  were responsible for lower photosynthesis, including an impact on carbohydrate metabolism
  resulting in putative energy deprivation and further accumulation of protein and
  amino acids, leading to C/N imbalance, which seems to be associated with the dwarfism
  phenotype in dapat plants. In order to obtain a metabolic adjustment, we postulate
  a hypothetical model in which malate is hyper-accumulated at the end of day (ED).
  Malate is further oxidized during the night by an alternative pathway associated
  with the cytosolic malic enzyme 2 to generated pyruvate and, thus, to sustain mitochondrial
  dark respiration at similar level when compared with WT plants. Furthermore, higher
  turnover of both protein and amino acids in dapat plants acts as a source for alternative
  respiration mediated by the ETF–ETFQO complex and dehydrogenases such as IVDH and
  D2HGDH. Data obtained from the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome were integrated
  to build the mechanism described here. Rectangles represent transcript data; circles
  represent protein data, and underlined names represent metabolite data. Increased
  and reduced levels from the data obtained are shown in black uppercase and grey
  lowercase letters, respectively. Abbreviations: Cb6f, complex b6/f; CS, citrate
