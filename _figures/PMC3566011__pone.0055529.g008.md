caption: The hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumor is proposed to influence invadopodia
  formation through a biphasic mechanism involving the regulation of HDAC6, followed
  by activation of the TGFβ/Smad3-dependent signaling pathway. First, hypoxia leads
  to the activation of the EGF/EGFR pathway, which enhances HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase
  activity. In parallel, hypoxia increases the expression of the proprotein convertase
  furin, resulting in enhanced TGFβ processing and bioactivation. HDAC6 tubulin deacetylation
  may allow the desequestration of Smad3 from the MT network leading to its activation
  and nuclear translocation. Smad3 translocation leads to enhanced transcription of
  TGFβ inducible genes and invadopodia production. In this model, HDAC6 might also
  translocate to the cell periphery where it was shown to be involved in cortactin
  deacetylation  an event needed for the formation of actin-rich invadopodia structures.
