caption: Iron regulation pathways in S. cerevisiae. ISC assembly in mitochondria is
  thought to generate a sulfur-based species called X-S that is exported from the
  organelle, possibly through Atm1. X-S and Fecyt combine in the cytosol to generate
  a Fe2S2 cluster bridged between two glutaredoxin monomers (red star). This reaction
  is proposed to be the origin of Dual regulation. In the Aft1/2 signaling pathway
  (purple symbols) and under iron-sufficient conditions, the cluster is passed to
  Aft1/2 (via Fra2), which prevents activation of the iron regulon in the nucleus.
  Under iron-deficient conditions, cluster-free monomeric Aft1/2 activates the iron
  regulon including the Fet3/Ftr1 importer on the plasma membrane. Cth2, Fet5, and
  Smf3 are also regulated to control vacuole iron levels. Less is known about Yap
  signaling pathway (red symbols). An ISC is likely built on an unknown protein and
  transferred eventually to Yap5. Cluster-bound Yap5 activates Ccc1, which imports
  cytosolic iron into the vacuoles.
