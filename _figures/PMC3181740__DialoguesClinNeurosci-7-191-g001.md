caption: 'Neuroplasticity and cellular resilience in mood disorders; the multiple
  influences on neuroplasticity and cellular resilience in mood disorders. Genetic/neurodevelopmental
  factors, repeated affective episodes, and illness progression might all contribute
  to the impairments of cellular resilience, volumetric reductions, and cell death/atrophy
  observed in mood disorders. Stress and depression likely contribute to impairments
  of cellular resilience by a variety of mechanisms, including reductions in the levels
  of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), facilitating glutamatergic transmission
  via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and nonNMDA receptors, and reducing the cells energy
  capacity. Neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF, enhance cell survival by activating
  two distinct signaling pathways: the phosphatidylinositol (Pl)3-kinase pathway,
  and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mitogen activated protein (MAP)-kinase
  pathway. One of the major mechanisms by which BDNF promotes cell survival is by
  increasing the expression of the major cytoprotective protein, Bcl-2. Bcl-2 attenuates
  cell death via a variety of mechanisms, including impairing the release of calcium
  and cytochrome c, sequestering proforms of deathinducing capase enzymes, and enhancing
  mitochondrial calcium uptake. The chronic administration of a variety of antidepressants
  increases the expression of BDNF, and its tyrosine kinase receptor (trkB). Lithium
  and valproic acid (VPA) robustly upregulate the cytoprotective protein Bcl-2. Lithium
  and VPA also inhibit glucogen synthase kinase (GSK-3b), biochemical effects shown
  to have neuroprotective effects. VPA also activates the ERK-MAP-kinase pathway,
  effects that may play a major role in neurotrophic effects and neurite outgrowth.
