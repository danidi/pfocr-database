caption: 'In brief, the hypothetical pathomechanism starts with the binding of TNF-α
  to the TNF-α receptor on hTeno which initiates the phosphorylation of TNF receptor-associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2) and subsequently promotes activation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) pathway and IκB kinase (IKK). In particular, JNK and IKKs are both serine/threonine-specific
  protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues
  on target proteins. Activation of JNK is proposed to trigger serine phosphorylation
  of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) instead of tyrosine phosphorylation, thus
  diminished the downstream pathways, i.e.: inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinases
  (PI3K) pathway and prohibits the translocation of GLUT4 intracellular vesicles to
  the transmembrane region, and eventually no glucose uptake by GLUT4. The glucose
  uptake in the cells is barely shuttled by GLUT1 via passive diffusion. On the other
  hand, IKK phosphorylates IκB, thus activates the NF-κB in cytoplasmic to translocate
  to the nucleus. The canonical pathway results in the induction of transcription
  of pro-inflammatory cytokine: interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
  TNF-α, thus increases cell death via a cascade of apoptosis signalling. Activation
  of NF-κB also suggested interfering with the collagen homeostasis. The proposed
  mechanisms suggest there is a positive feedback loop between TNF-α and NF-κB.'
