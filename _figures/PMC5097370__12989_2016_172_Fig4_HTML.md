caption: Regulation of myofibroblast formation by TGF-β1. a Schematic presentation
  of TGF-β1 signaling in myofibroblast formation. Upon stimulation, latent TGF-β1
  is activated and active TGF-β1 is released to bind to its receptors on the cell
  surface to drive the Smad-dependent pathway, which directly up-regulates the transcription
  of fibrotic genes encoding α-SMA, collagens, and fibronectin. Binding of active
  TGF-β1 to its receptors also elicits a number of Smad-independent pathways, such
  as the PI3K-AKT signaling, which may promote myofibroblast differentiation and function.
  b Role of TGF-β1 in CNT-stimulated myofibroblast differentiation. CNTs induce the
  production and secretion of TGF-β1 by macrophages and epithelial cells, which serves
  as a paracrine factor to stimulate fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation.
  CNTs also directly induce fibroblasts to produce and secrete TGF-β1, which functions
  as an autocrine factor for fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts. CNTs
  may directly promote fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation by mimicking the
  ECM or intracellular collagen fibers to generate mechanical stress. In addition,
  CNTs stimulate epithelial cells to produce and secrete TGF-β1, which may induce
  the trans-differentiation of epithelial cells to myofibroblasts via EMT
