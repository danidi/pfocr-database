caption: Diagrammatic representation of the biosynthetic pathway of BCAAs of S. cerevisiae.
  The proteins that participate in the pathway are Leu4/Leu9 (α-IPMSs, which constitute
  the leucine-sensitive α-IPM biosynthetic pathway), Oac1 (mitochondrial inner membrane
  transporter), Leu1 (isopropyl malate isomerase), Leu2 (β-IPM dehydrogenase), Bat1
  (mitochondrial BCAT), Bat2 (cytoplasmic BCAT), threonine deaminase (Ilv1), acetolactate
  synthase (Ilv2), acetohydroxiacid reductoisomerase (Ilv5), dihydroxiacid dehydratase
  (Ilv3), α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), β-IPM, α-IPM, pyruvate (PYR), acetolactate (AL),
  α.β-dehydroxyisovalerate (DHIV), α-ketoisovalerate (KIV), α-ketobutanoate (KB),
  α-keto-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHB), dihydroxymetylvalerate (DHMV), α-ketomethylvalerate
  (KMV), threonine (THR). Dotted lines represent negative allosteric feedback loops.
  Filled circles represent presumed transporters. The expression of the genes (LEU4,
  ILV2, ILV5, LEU1, LEU2, BAT1, and GDH1) proceeded by an arrow are positively regulated
  by Leu3 (green arrow depicts transcriptional activation). The leucine-sensitive
  α-IPM pathway is depicted with a purple arrow, while the arrows pertaining the leucine
  resistant pathway are shaded in blue.
