caption: Antibodies can target tau both extracellularly and intracellularly. Pathological
  tau mostly resides within neurons but in certain individuals and/or tauopathies,
  it is also evident in other cell types, primarily glia (in particular, astrocytes
  and oligodendrocytes). A much smaller pool of tau aggregates is found extracellularly,
  in the form of small aggregates that are not easily detected or as remnants of neurofibrillary
  tangles following the death of the neuron. Some anti-tau antibodies are not readily
  taken up into neurons, presumably because of their unfavourable charge and, therefore,
  they work principally in the extracellular compartment. Within this compartment,
  antibodies might sequester tau aggregates, interfere with their assembly and promote
  microglial phagocytosis, with the overall effect of blocking the spread of tau pathology
  between neurons. Other antibodies are easily detected within neurons, in association
  with tau, and have been shown to work both intracellularly and extracellularly.
  Within the cells, these antibodies could bind to tau aggregates within the endosomal–lysosomal
  system and promote their disassembly, leading to enhanced access of lysosomal enzymes
  to degrade the aggregates; sequester tau assemblies in the cytosol and prevent their
  release from the neuron; or promote proteosomal degradation via E3 ubiquitin–protein
  ligase TRIM21 binding. The most efficacious antibodies are likely to target more
  than one pathway and/or pool of tau.
