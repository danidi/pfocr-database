caption: Pathways involved in tumor cell death. The chemotherapeutic treatment or
  chemotherapy mainly utilize three different pathways that lead to tumor cell death
  or apoptosis, which are (a) the extrinsic death receptor pathway, (b) the intrinsic
  mitochondrial pathway, and (c) the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway.
