caption: β3/KRAS/RalB/NFkB pathway mediates EGFR-targeted therapy resistance. In EGFR
  TKI-treated tumors, cells overexpressing αvβ3 integrin are selected, leading to
  a resistant tumor. By binding to oligosaccharide moieties of β3 integrin, galectin-3
  promotes integrin/KRAS interaction independently of integrin-mediated adhesion to
  ECM proteins. KRAS activates the downstream RalB/NFkB pathway that leads to therapy
  resistance by promoting a stem cell-like phenotype (adapted from []).
