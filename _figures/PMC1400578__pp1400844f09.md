caption: A proposed model for the GCR1, GPA1, and PD1 signal transduction mechanism
  responsible for BL-enhanced Phe synthesis in etiolated seedlings. The figure depicts
  the potential interface between the BL-activated GCR1, GPA1, and PD1 signal transduction
  chain and the cytosolic biosynthetic pathway leading from chorismate to Phe. Also
  depicted is the major signaling branch point that occurs immediately downstream
  of GPA1, as there now appear to be several different GPA1 effector proteins.
