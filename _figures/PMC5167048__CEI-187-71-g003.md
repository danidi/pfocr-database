caption: Age‐associated defects interfering with function and survival of activated
  T cells. T cells that have differentiated into effector/memory precursor cells gain
  responsiveness to type I interferon (IFN) that is required for the sustained expression
  of interleukin (IL)‐2 and CD69 that retains activated T cells in lymph nodes. With
  age, this pathway loses efficacy due to increased recruitment of Src homology region
  2 domain‐containing phosphatase‐1 (SHP1). Also with increasing age, activated T
  cells preferentially differentiate into CD39‐expressing short‐lived effector cells.
  CD39 expression is associated with a decrease in cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphatase
  (ATP) and increased adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation and the expression
  of nuclear dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP4) that terminates Jun kinase (JNK)
  and extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) signalling and interferes with T
  helper function and proliferation.
