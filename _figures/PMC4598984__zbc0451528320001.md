caption: Data analysis of the identified Snf1 interactors. A, intersection between
  the already known Snf1 physical interactors and the interactors identified in this
  study. B, Gene Ontology Biological Process enrichment analysis of the Snf1 physical
  interactors in 2% glucose. Green nodes indicate proteins of the Snf1 pathway, yellow
  nodes indicate proteins involved in glucose metabolism, red nodes indicate proteins
  involved in the translation process, and blue nodes indicate proteins involved in
  other metabolic processes. Red edges indicate previously known interactions, and
  gray edges represent physical interactions between all the nodes. The known interactions
  were retrieved in the BioGRID database of physical interactions (updated to July
  2015). Data visualization was performed with Cytoscape.
