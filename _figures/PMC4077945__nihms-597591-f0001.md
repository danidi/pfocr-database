caption: 'Top panel: de novo lipogenesis is controlled by several rate-limiting enzymes
  that convert acetyl-CoA into palmitate (C16:0), palmitoleate (C16:1), stearate (C18:0)
  and oleate (C18:1). These fatty acids provide building blocks for complex lipids
  such as triglycerides and phospholipids. In the liver, de novo lipogenesis increases
  circulating concentrations of PC(18:0/18:1) following feeding to promote fatty acid
  uptake by the muscle, an activity requiring intact PPARα signaling. Furthermore,
  hepatic synthesis of PC(16:0/18:1) during the dark cycle may later act as a PPARα
  ligand during the light cycle to increase oxidation of fatty acids. De novo synthesis
  of palmitoleate by adipose is conducive to increased glucose uptake by muscle and
  decreased lipogenesis in the liver. FA: fatty acid; ACL: ATP citrate lyase; ACC:
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS: fatty acid synthase; SCD1: stearoyl-CoA desaturase
  1; ELOVL6: elongation of long-chain fatty acids family member 6. Lower panel: eicosanoids,
  which include both pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators, are synthesized from
  essential fatty acids (e.g., ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids). They are primarily produced
  by immune cells such as tissue resident macrophages (Mϕ). Resolvins RvD1 and RvD2
  have been shown to enhance adiponectin expression and suppress meta-inflammation
  in white adipose tissue. Additionally, β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) is a by-product
  of the valine degradation and the fatty acid oxidation pathway in muscle. Its circulating
  level is increased during endurance exercise. BAIBA has been implicated as an exercise-induced
  myokine that promotes white adipose tissue browning.'
