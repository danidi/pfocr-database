caption: Schematic of the changes in soleus muscle gene expression within the TGFβ
  and BMP pathways, with SCI (a) and acute response to treadmill training (b). Panel
  (a) shows the combined changes observed on day 3 and 8 after SCI, where several
  Smads (Smads 3, 4, and 1/5) and Fst gene expression was increased compared to control
  in parallel with muscle atrophy. Panel (b) summarizes the changes observed 8 days
  after SCI after 3 sessions of treadmill training compared to untrained animals.
  The changes in Smad3 and Fst were reversed, and Bmpr2 expression was increased,
  suggesting a role for the BMP pathway in the initiation of muscle mass recovery
  process observed with treadmill training.
