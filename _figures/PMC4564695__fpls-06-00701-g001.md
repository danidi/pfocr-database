caption: A diagrammatic outline of the Calvin–Benson–Basshan (CBB) cycle and photorespiration
  pathway in plants in response to elevated CO2 with abiotic factors. Rubisco has
  two sites of carboxylation and oxygenation. Elevated CO2 (eCO2) may promote carboxylation,
  but repress oxygenation under ample environmental conditions, such as well-watering,
  whereas extreme abiotic stress, such as heat and drought, may repress carboxylation
  but promote oxygenation (; ). An energy consumption trade-off between the key cycles
  may occur, possibly modified by the CO2 level, in which photorespiration may be
  promoted to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS), related to glutamine synthetase
  (GS2) to recycle ammonia, diminishing photo-oxidation and photo-inhibition (dotted
  orange line ellipse; ; ). A low Gly:Ser ratio provides evidence that photorespiration
  is repressed in eCO2 (). Water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency
  (NUE), despite the N dilution, should be enhanced by elevated CO2, by decreasing
  stomatal conductance and investing relatively more N into the Rubisco protein ().
  The photorespiration process is compartmentalized into the chloroplast (red line
  ellipse), peroxisome (dotted green line bent rectangle), and mitochondrion (dotted
  green line ellipse). The green plus and red minus signs denote the stimulation and
  suppression via rising CO2, respectively (mainly referring to ; ; ; ; ; ; ).
