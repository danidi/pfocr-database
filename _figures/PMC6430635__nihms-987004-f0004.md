caption: 'The different subcellular sources of MHC-I molecules for cross-presentation.
  Published evidence supports the use of four distinct sources of MHC-I for cross-presentation
  by dendritic cells (DCs): () the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), () the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN), () the plasma membrane, and () the endosomal recycling compartment
  (ERC). () Direct trafficking of MHC-I molecules from the ER to endolysosomal compartments
  has been reported in bone marrow–derived DCs mediated by the chaperone CD74, which
  associates with MHC-I molecules and chaperones them to late endosomal compartments
  marked by LAMP-1. This compartment may contain endocytosed antigen delivered from
  the plasma membrane. Deficiency in CD74 impairs cross-presentation, suggesting that
  in this case ER-delivered MHC-I and not plasma membrane MHC-I is loaded within the
  late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, from which they may traffic directly to the
  plasma membrane for recognition by CD8 T cells. () The secretory pathway of newly
  synthesized MHC-I molecules (see ) is diverted by MARCH9-mediated ubiquitination
  of MHC-I in the TGN and their diversion via SCAMP3+ vesicles to multivesicular bodies
  (MVBs) (perhaps for degradation) or syntaxin-6+ vesicles to late endosomes (perhaps
  for loading with antigen delivered from the sorting endosome). () A tyrosine residue
  at position 320 (Y320) within the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain is critical for delivery
  of MHC-I to endosomal cross-presentation compartments, where peptide loading presumably
  takes place. Y320 might traffic MHC-I from the Golgi compartment to late endosomes,
  similar to its role in trafficking MHC-I from the plasma membrane to late endosomes,
  perhaps during clathrin-independent endocytosis. The ER, TGN, and plasma membrane
  sources of MHC-I are presumably used preferably for the cross-presentation of endocytic
  antigen, but this remains to be formally tested. () During phagocytosis, plasma
  membrane MHC-I might become internalized as phagosomes form, but when cargo such
  as a bacterium carries TLR ligands, additional numbers of MHC-I are recruited from
  the MHC-I-rich ERC under control of TLR-MyD88-IKK2 signaling (designated in blue
  letters). This mobilization serves to augment cross-presentation by increasing the
  number of ERC-resident MHC-I molecules available for loading with bacterial peptides.
  It is assumed that loading takes place in the phagosome followed by export of peptide-MHC-I
  complexes to the plasma membrane.'
