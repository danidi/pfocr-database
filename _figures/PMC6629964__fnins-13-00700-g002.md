caption: 'Signaling pathways underlying the potential involvement of latrophilins
  in growth cone and actin structures formation. Representation of growth cone structures
  and associated signaling. (A) Lamellipodia Formation: GPCR activation leads to their
  coupling with G proteins provoking subunits dissociation. Activation of the Rac
  pathway by Gβγ subunits results in the recruitment of WAVE and ARP2/3 complexes
  at the front of migration and generates actin polymerization (; ). The reported
  interaction between Lphn1 and SHANK could presumptively couple the aGPCR to the
  actin cytoskeleton (). (B) Filipodia Formation: Activation of G proteins by GPCR
  stimulation at the migration front leads to dissociation of α subunits from βγ subunits,
  which will in turn activate small GTPase Cdc42 recruiting n-WASP and ARP2/3 complexes
  and provoking actin polymerization (). (C) Axonic Cone Formation: Proteolytically
  cleaved teneurin-2 activates latrophilin leading to Gαq protein induction of PLC
  followed by an increase in Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum through IP3
  receptors (). Alternatively, cAMP levels can be modulated by activation of Gαi or
  Gαs proteins (yellow) (; ). In parallel, G protein activation can also lead to the
  stimulation RhoA/ROCK pathway supporting filopodial formation through actin stabilization
  (green) ().'
