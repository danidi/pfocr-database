caption: A. TGF-β is a secreted signal that binds to TGFBRI and TGFBRII complexes
  on the cell surface of neurons and microglia. TGF-β levels are elevated in the brain
  and CSF of AD, PD, and FTD patients. In mouse models of AD, PD, and FTD, TGF-β is
  neuroprotective and decreases amyloid plaques in AD models, acting in part through
  interleukin-like epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducer (ILEI) in neurons to
  reduce Aβ production. TGF-β is also necessary for normal microglia maturation and
  for maintaining their unique brain profile. by Microglia in TGF-β receptor knockout
  mice or mice lacking the TGF-β associated milieu molecule LRRC33 exhibit increased
  lysosomal content, decreased ramification, and altered transcriptional profile.
  Altered TGF-β levels could modulate microglial state and function in neurodegenerative
  disease.B. The complement pathway is upregulated in AD, PD, and FTD patients. In
  AD and FTD mouse models, heterotrimeric C1q molecules (made up of C1qa, C1qb, C1qc)
  bind to vulnerable synapses, leading to opsonization by C3 and phagocytosis of the
  structure by microglia which express the C3 receptor (CR3/CD11b). This process could
  contribute to synapse loss found in early stages of neurodegenerative disease. Blocking
  complement activation limits neuroimmune alterations and ameliorates neurocognitive
  deficits in mouse models of AD and FTD. C1q molecules (produced by microglia) also
  bind to amyloid plaques to trigger Aβ phagocytosis. ApoE can limit complement pathway
  activation by binding to C1q, and an association found in AD plaques and is reduced
  in the presence of the APOE-ε4 risk allele.
