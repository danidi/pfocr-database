caption: 'Hypothetical representation of regulation of calcium ion [Ca2+]i homeostasis
  by PKD-related proteins and summary of potential novel therapeutic interventions
  targeting major downstream effects of mutations disrupting this pathway. In response
  to mechanical stimulation of primary cilium, polycystin-1/2 complex mediates Ca2+
  entry into cell. This triggers Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Fibrocystin
  (FC) may regulate [Ca2+]i homeostasis by its interaction with polycystin-2 (PC2)
  and Ca2+-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML). Major downstream effects from disruptions
  of this pathway include elevated cAMP, up-regulated and apically mislocalized epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) and up-regulated vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R). Cellular
  content of cAMP is determined by balance between activities of synthesizing adenylyl
  cyclases (AC) and catabolizing cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDE). Adenylyl cyclase VI
  (AC-VI), predominant AC in collecting duct epithelial cells, is stimulated by αs-subunit
  of heteromeric G proteins (Gs) and is inhibited by Gi and by Ca2+. Activation of
  V2R by vasopressin increases cAMP production. Somatostatin and vasopressin V2 receptor
  antagonists inhibit cAMP production. PDE1 and PDE4 are predominant PDEs in collecting
  duct principal cells. PDE1 is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin. PKA, Protein kinase
  A; Src, membrane-associated tyrosine-specific kinase; V2RA, vasopressin 2 receptor
  antagonist; Src inh, Src inhibitors; EGFRTKI, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor. Modified from VE Torres and PC Harris: Mechanisms of disease:
  autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney diseases. Nat Clin Pract Nephrol
