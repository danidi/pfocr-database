caption: Melanoma cells with mutations in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway are sensitive
  to combine therapy of leucine deprivation and inhibition of autophagy. In normal
  cells, the mTORC1 complex is a sensor of nutrient levels, and nutrient starvation
  induces its inhibition-activating autophagy, which in turn replenishes nutrient
  levels. In melanoma cells, however, the hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway
  cells keeps mTORC1 active and therefore autophagy is not turned on, which induces
  apoptosis.
