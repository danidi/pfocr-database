caption: Partly hypothetical pathway of glucoside carbamate synthesis in the extraplastic
  space, malonylation and import into the vacuole for temporary storage, export and
  transformation/reconstitution to BOA by the endophyte Fusarium verticillioides.
  Peroxidase generated BOA radicals and subsequent fixation of the radicals at carbohydrate
  cell wall components are thought to present the major start reactions for later
  N-glucosylated BOA release by hydrolytic enzymes. A rearrangement of the N-glucosylated
  molecule results in glucoside carbamate, which can be malonylated and stored within
  the vacuole. This pathway prevents not only entering of toxic benzoxazolinone into
  the cytosol, but is competitive to phenoxazinone synthesis. An auxiliary pathway
  may start after generation of instable carbamic acid and N-glucosylation by maize
  glucosyltransferase BX9. Fusarium verticillioides can open the lactone ring of glucoside
  carbamate, resulting in glucosylated carbamic acid. This relatively stable compound
  was recently identified as a fungal degradation product of glucoside carbamate.
  It can be further degraded resulting finally in phenoxazinones or is recycled to
  BOA.
