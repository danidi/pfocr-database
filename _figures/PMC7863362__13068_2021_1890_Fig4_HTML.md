caption: Compared with photoautotrophy, the expression changes of photorespiration
  biosynthesis pathway in mixotrophy. Numbers in the blue squares were expression
  changes that expressed in log2FCa. For genes with multiple isoforms, the isoform
  with the highest FPKM was selected to represent each gene. GK glycerate kinase,
  PGP phosphoglycolate phosphatase, GO glycolate oxidase, GGAT glutamate-glyoxylate
  aminotransferase, GlyA glycine hydroxymethyltransferase, AGXT serine-pyruvate transaminase,
  HPR hydroxypyruvate reductase, G3P glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, RuBP ribulose-1,5bisphosphate
