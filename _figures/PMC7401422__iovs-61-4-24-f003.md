caption: Visualization of the cell cycle pathway from WikiPathways. (A) Visualizing
  the results after comparing the bovine responders versus nonresponders. Every colored
  rectangle represents a gene that had been measured in the bovine dataset. Red color
  indicates upregulation, blue color indicates downregulation. The higher the intensity
  of the color, the higher the up- or downregulation. (B) Visualizing the LogFC of
  the responders and the nonresponders as calculated in Formula 1. Every colored rectangle
  represents a gene that had been measured in the bovine dataset. The first part of
  the rectangle represents the responders, and the second part of the rectangle represents
  the nonresponders. Red color indicates upregulation, blue color indicates downregulation.
  The higher the intensity of the color, the higher the up- or downregulation.
