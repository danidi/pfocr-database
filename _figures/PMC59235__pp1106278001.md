caption: Pathway for GSH and hGSH synthesis in legumes. The two ATP-dependent reactions
  leading to GSH synthesis are, respectively, the condensation of Glu and Cys to form
  γEC (catalyzed by γECS) and the addition of Gly to the C terminus of γEC (catalyzed
  by GSHS). For hGSH synthesis, βAla replaces Gly in the second reaction (catalyzed
  by hGSHS).
