caption: 'Alternative splicing regulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Growth factors
  and cytokines activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which in turn lead to activation
  of Ras. RTKs can be alternatively spliced to generate soluble truncated isoforms
  which act in a dominant-negative manner or constitutively active isoforms which
  are active regardless of ligand binding. Ras can be alternatively spliced to generate
  p19-Ras which cannot activate its downstream effector Raf. GTP-bound p21-Ras activates
  A-, B-, and C-Raf which can be alternatively spliced to generate inactive dominant-negative
  isoforms containing only the Ras binding domain (RBD) or constitutively active isoforms
  containing only the kinase domain. Oncogenic splicing factor hnRNP H inhibits the
  production of dominant-negative A-Raf isoforms. Raf phosphorylates MAPKK (MEK) which
  in turn phosphorylates MAPK-ERK. MAPKK1 and ERK1 can generate MAPKK1b and ERK1c,
  respectively, by alternative splicing to generate a parallel signalling pathway.
  MAPK-ERK can phosphorylate MNK2, which is alternatively spliced and regulated by
  the oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1. SRSF1 upregulates a prooncogenic Mnk2b isoform
  and reduces Mnk2a isoform of this kinase. Blue: tumor suppressors, red: oncogenes,
  and green: parallel pathway.'
