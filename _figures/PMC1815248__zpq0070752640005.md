caption: Co-option of a developmental pathway by invasive tumors. A model summarizing
  the relationships between JNK pathway, MMPs, TIMP, and RECK and their role in BM
  degradation during the developmental invasive process of disc eversion and tumor
  invasion. During the disc eversion process, both MMP1 and MMP2 are under the control
  of the JNK pathway and result in BM degradation. In tumor invasion, part of the
  developmental pathway is hijacked to affect BM degradation and invasiveness. MMP1
  and MMP2 function is inhibited by TIMP and/or RECK. It is possible that RECK could
  also block other proteases activated by RasV12 and/or scrib−/−, which are independent
  from JNK signaling.
