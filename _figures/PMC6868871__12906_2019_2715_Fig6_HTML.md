caption: A summary diagram demonstrating the contribution of IGF-1/IGFBP to transcriptional
  levels of PPAR-γ, VEGF, and HIF-1α under the administration of BV intervention.
  Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is produced in hepatocytes, other tissues and
  tumor cells []. IGF-1 binds as a complex with IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) in circulation
  to control IGF homeostasis and control IGF-1 signaling in target tissues where cells
  present transmembrane IGF-1 receptor []. Downstream IGF signaling was depicted in
  two pathways of phosphatidil-inositol-3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) and mitogen activating
  protein kinase/extracellular receptor kinase (MEK/ERK), can both induce angiogenesis
  [, ]. The activity of mediators in Ras/MAPK pathway can ultimately upregulate the
  transcription of genes involved in the proliferation of entails angiogenesis [].
  Consumption of BV juice contains berberine. Berberine led to enhanced plasma levels
  of IGFBP-1 and subsequently decreased IGF-1/IGFBP-1. Berberine can interact in different
  parts of PI3K/Akt pathway and MEK/ERK [–], suggesting as the main mechanism could
  explain down-regulating effects of BV juice on PPAR-γ, VEGF, and HIF-1α. Tested
  biomarkers were shown with BV colored by red
