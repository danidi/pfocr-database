caption: Relationship between increased production of IPP by GAS and signaling of
  γδ T cells. Up-regulation of mevalonic acid pathway genes (mvaS.1, spy0686, mvaK1,
  mvaK2, mvaD) results in increased production of IPP, which binds to the TCR of host
  γδ T cells present in the mucosal epithelium. Binding of IPP to the TCR stimulates
  recruitment of lipid rafts necessary for TCR signaling. Host genes involved in organization
  of lipid raft and receptor clustering, such as Agrin, Flotillin-2, and NrCAM, show
  increased expression levels to coordinate TCR and coreceptor signaling. The activated
  TCR initiates a signal transduction cascade leading to increased expression of host
  MAP3KIP1 and GADD45B, both members of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, and MAP4K1, a
  hematopoietic-specific signaling kinase that activates the cellular stress activated
  signaling pathway (SAPK1). Gamma-delta T cells are key defenders of the host mucosal
  surface and TCR signaling leading to increased proliferation or T-cell anergy is
  likely to influence the immune response to GAS.
