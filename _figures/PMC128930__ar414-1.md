caption: The role of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the differentiation pathway
  of CD8+regulatory T cells. In response to antigen stimulation, the combination of
  IL-2 produced by CD4+ cells and the active form of TGF-β produced by natural killer
  (NK) cells or macrophages (not shown) induce CD8+ cells to lose their cytotoxic
  potential and become regulatory, TGF-β-producing, Th3-like cells. IL-2 also enhances
  the extracellular conversion of TGF-β from the latent to the biologically active
  form.
