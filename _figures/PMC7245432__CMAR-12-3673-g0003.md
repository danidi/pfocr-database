caption: Turnover of circRNAs. (a) CircRNAs can be cleaved by extracellular vesicles.
  (b) CircRNAs with N6-methyladenosine (m6A) can be cleaved by endoribonucleolytic
  cleavage via the YTHDF2-HRSP12-RNase-P/MRP pathway. (c) CircRNAs can be bound by
  microRNAs (miRNAs) through miRNA binding sites and subsequently cleaved by protein
  agonaute 2 (AGO2).
