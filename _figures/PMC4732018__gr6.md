caption: 'H218O incorporation into PC lipids. The CDP-choline pathway ,  is a representative
  metabolic pathway outlining reactions that allow for H218O incorporation into PCs
  and/or lyso-PCs. From the top, choline kinase (CK) phosphorylates choline to phosphocholine,
  which is converted to cytidine-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) by CTP: phosphocholine
  cytidylyltransferase (CCT). Choline phosphotransferase (CPT) catalyzes PC synthesis.
  Fatty acyl chains are cleaved from the PC sn-2 position by phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
  to generate lyso-PC and free fatty acids. Free fatty acids are labeled (*), rapidly
  converted to acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and used for acylation of lyso-PL
  in a reaction catalyzed by acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferases (AGPAT). PC may
  be cleaved by PLC (phospholipase C) to yield diacylglycerides (DAG) and phosphocholine.
  Hydrolysis reactions in which incorporation of the 18O label may occur are shown
  in red, as are the indicated oxygens that may be labeled following PL remodeling.'
