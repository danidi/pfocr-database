caption: Schematic model demonstrating functional involvement of NPM1, RAD50 and XRCC5
  in DSB-repair in the progression of ovarian cancer cells. Onset of environmental
  and therapeutic stress leads to the activation of ATM, which recruits MRN complex
  and phosphorylates H2AX histone variant. NPM1 and XRCC5 involved in HR and NHEJ
  pathways respectively. Knock-down of NPM1 and XRCC5 across alternatively activates
  NHEJ and HR pathways (red lines) towards maintaining DNA integrity and genomic stability.
  Under genomic stress conditions, knock-down of RAD50, NPM1 and XRCC5 DSB-repair
  proteins lead to the activation of p53/p21 signaling pathway resulted in onset of
  apoptosis of DSB-repair impaired cells. On other hand, cells surviving with impaired
  DSB-repair exhibit frequencies of reduced mitosis, mitotic irregularities and multi-polarity
  and aneuploidy, which conclusively facilitate genomic instability in transformed
  cells.
