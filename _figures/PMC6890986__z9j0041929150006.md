caption: Overview of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated
  cell death mediated by lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes, although which
  damaged membranes induce cell death is not yet clear. Ferroptosis can be initiated
  by iron overload in which Fenton reaction-produced Fe3+ activates lipoxygenases
  or by mechanisms that inactivate glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which opposes
  lipid peroxidation. GPX4 can be inactivated by extracellular glutamate overload,
  which inhibits antiporter system xc− . System xc− normally imports cystine, which
  is converted to cysteine that subsequently generates glutathione (GSH), a cofactor
  for GPX4. Fe3+ imported through the transferrin receptor (TR) is converted to Fe2+
  in endosomes by the metalloreductase six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate
  3 (Steap3) and released from endosomes by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Erastin,
  sulfasalazine, and sorafenib are small molecules that inhibit system xc− to induce
  ferroptosis. Ras synthetic lethal 3 (RSL3) and FIN56 are small molecules that inhibit
  GPX4 also inducing ferroptosis. Ferrostatin-1, liproxstatin-1, vitamin E, and CoQ10
  are lipid antioxidants that inhibit ferroptosis. In addition, FIN56 also inhibits
  CoQ10 through the mevalonate pathway. Deferoxamine (DFO) binds Fe2+ mainly extracellularly,
  while dexrazoxane and ciclopirox (CPX) bind Fe2+ intracellularly.
