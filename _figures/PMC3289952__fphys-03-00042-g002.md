caption: Proposed role of essential fatty acids in “micromanaging” molecular actions.
  miRNAs are transcribed from specific transcripts generating a primary precursor
  (Pri-miR). In the canonical pathway, the pri-miR is processed by the family of RNase
  III enzyme Drosha, generating the precursor hairpin (pre-miR) which is exported
  to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 protein. In the cytoplasm, the second RNase III enzyme
  (Dicer) further cleaves the Pre-miR, generating the double strand ∼20-bp miRNA/miRNA*
  duplex. One strand of the miRNA/miRNA* duplex is preferentially incorporated into
  the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), whereas the other strand (passenger
  or miRNA*) is degraded. Argonaute 2 (Ago2) containing miRISC bind by base-pair to
  their target mRNAs and induce their translational repression or deadenylation and
  degradation. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation has been proposed to
  modulate the expression of different miRNAs in adipocytes, including miRNA-107,
  -143, -221, and miRNA-222 and postranscriptionally regulate the expression of different
  proteins involved in insulin signaling and adipocyte differentiation. DHA – through
  the resolving D1 (RvD1) pathway – may also modulate the resolution of acute inflammation.
  Resolvins are enzymatically synthesized from essential fatty acids, including DHA,
  during inflammation. Binding of RvD1 to its receptors ALX and/or GPR32 modulates
  the expression of different miRNAs that may be involved in this process. Different
  other studies propose that DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate the
  expression of different miRNA in hepatocytes, glioblastoma or colon cancer cells
  related to different biological processes. miRNA-21 postranscriptionally regulates
  the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) involved in different
  pathological processes.
