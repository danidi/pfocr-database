caption: Model for the CD5-induced signaling pathway, which is mediated by PI 3-kinase
  and Vav, resulting in the activation of Rac1. (I) Upon engagement of the TCR by
  ligand, the tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the CD5 receptor are
  phosphorylated by the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck, as are the tyrosine residues
  in the ζ chains of the TCR-CD3 complex. p56lck associates with the CD5 receptor
  and becomes fully activated through autophosphorylation. (II) The SH2 domains of
  the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase bind to the phosphotyrosine residues of the CD5 receptor.
  Vav associates with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, which serves to recruit Vav
  to the complex. Upon ligation of the CD5 receptor, PI 3-kinase is phosphorylated
  on tyrosine residues by a protein tyrosine kinase, most probably p56lck, which activates
  the lipid kinase activity of the p110 subunit. The nucleotide exchange activity
  of Vav is preactivated through the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, probably
  by p56lck. (III) Upon binding of PI 3,4,5-P3 (PIP3) or another lipid product of
  PI 3-kinase to the PH domain of Vav, Vav becomes fully activated and will activate
  Rac1 through exchange of GDP for GTP.
