caption: 'Effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) after spinal cord injury (SCI).Spinal
  cord contusion by means of weight drop technique (A) causes an insult that produces
  disruption of ascending and descending spinal cord pathways, demyelination of these
  spinal pathways, and a core of injured tissue surrounded by a glial scare that includes
  reactive astrocytes and microglial cells and several inhibitory proteoglycans. This
  core is formed by infiltrated neutrophils that secreted several reactive oxygen
  species and pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, reactive glial cells also secrete
  these pro-inflammatory factors (B). Some of these factors that appeared in injured
  spinal cord are able to stimulate RhoA-ROCK intracellular pathway, which in turn,
  activates downstream effectors implicated in axonal regeneration, synthesis and
  secretion of inflammatory cytokines and modulation of cell traffic vesicles and
  neurotransmission receptors (C). EGCG treatment is able to reduce the expression
  of RhoA in the injured spinal cord, but also modulates other intracellular pathways
  including NFkappaB, ERK1/2, JNK, Akt/PKB and JAK/STAT (D). All these cell signallings
  are implicated in the promotion of neuroprotection and functional recovery of injured
  nervous system (for details see text). NFkappaB: Transcription factor nuclear factor-κB;
  ERK1/2: extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2; JNKs: JUN amino-terminal kinases;
  Akt/PKB: serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B; JAK/STAT: Janus kinase/signal
  transducer and activator of transcription.'
