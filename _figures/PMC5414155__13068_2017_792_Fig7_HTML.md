caption: Overall impact of ethanol stress on C. thermocellum metabolism. a Affected
  pathway fluxes and metabolite concentrations under ethanol stress condition. The
  numbers represent the flux values (mol/mol cellobiose) normalized to cellobiose
  uptake (except for those in brackets represent concentration change) for the wild-type
  (gray color) to ammonia-limited (green or red color representing up- or downregulation,
  respectively) conditions. All fluxes were normalized to cellobiose uptake. b Comparison
  of model-predicted cytosolic concentration changes with the experimentally measured
  values
