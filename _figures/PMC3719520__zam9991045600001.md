caption: 'Biotin-biosynthetic pathways and the relevant genes in C. glutamicum. The
  biotin precursor pimelate thioester is either a CoA derivative or an ACP derivative.
  The products of the FAS-I-type fatty acid synthetases encoded by fasA and fasB are
  considered to be acyl-CoAs because the closely related C. ammoniagenes (previously
  referred to as Brevibacterium ammoniagenes) has been shown to generate CoA derivatives
  (). The biotin-biosynthetic pathway of C. glutamicum is incomplete due to the lack
  of the bioF gene and probably the gene(s) for the de novo synthesis of pimeloyl-CoA
  (or -ACP). For the synthesis of a pimelate moiety, two different routes have been
  proposed: the E. coli bioC-bioH route (dotted arrows) and the B. subtilis bioI route
  (thick gray arrow). Both routes are believed to depend on fatty acid synthesis,
  but at different levels. In E. coli, BioC catalyzes methylation of malonyl-CoA to
  form malonyl-CoA methyl ester, which enters the fatty-acid-biosynthetic pathway
  to generate pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester after two cycles of chain elongation (). The
  methyl ester moiety is cleaved by BioH to produce the biotin precursor pimeloyl-ACP
  (). In B. subtilis, BioI catalyzes oxidative C-C bond cleavage of long-chain acyl-ACPs
  to produce pimeloyl-ACP (). The process of incorporating exogenous pimelic acid
  into the biotin-biosynthetic pathway remains unclear in C. glutamicum, whereas in
  B. subtilis, this step is catalyzed by the bioW gene product (). The uptake of pimelic
  acid is considered to occur by passive diffusion, as is the case with E. coli and
  several other bacteria (). In this study, the E. coli bioBF genes and the B. subtilis
  bioI gene were introduced into C. glutamicum to establish the biotin prototroph,
  while the endogenous bioY gene was deleted in C. glutamicum to establish the biotin
  hyperauxotroph.'
