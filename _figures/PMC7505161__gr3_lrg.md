caption: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
  Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This illustration shows the postulated mechanism
  underlying the immune response following the immune system manifestation facing
  the viral infection. People with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular
  diseases have a higher probability to develop severe COVID-19. Once infected (STEP
  1) by SARS-CoV-2, the virus replicates by the ACE2 pathway (STEP 2). The spike protein
  from SARS-CoV-2 then binds to TLR4 triggering (STEP 3) a transmembrane stimulus
  in different cells in the body, culminating with a sharp release of TNF-α, and IL-6
  (cytokine storm).
