caption: Primary points at which PUFA-based supplements enter the PUFA biosynthetic
  pathway. The biosynthesis of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs proceeds in parallel pathways utilizing
  the same set of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) and elongase (ELOVL) enzymes. Components
  of the dietary oils (Table ) enter as both n-6 (LA, GLA) and n-3 (ALA, SDA, EPA,
  DPA, and DHA) PUFAs.
