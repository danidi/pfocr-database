caption: The impact of NF-κB on MS animal models. The effects of nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone models
  are summarized as follows. c-Rel and IKKβ in macrophages/microglia might influence
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, M1 macrophage/microglia
  phenotype polarization, and T cell immune responses. The deficiency of IKKβ in oligodendrocytes
  does not alter myelin formation, demyelination, and remyelination; however, blocking
  RelB and the canonical pathway results in a decreased number of mature oligodendrocytes.
  NF-κB1 and the canonical pathway are required to augment local inflammation through
  driving the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and suppressing the levels
  of neuroprotective molecule adhesion molecules and CD8+ CD122+ regulatory T cells
  (Tregs). Neuronal IKKβ has been suggested to suppress CNS inflammation. By contrast,
  conditional deletion of the neuronal NF-κB pathway by the transgenic expression
  of an IκBα super-repressor did not influence the EAE course. c-Rel is essential
  in Treg, T helper 1 (Th1), and Th17 differentiation. In addition to c-Rel, Th1 differentiation
  is also regulated by RelB, whereas NF-κB1 is essential in mediating Th2 responses.
