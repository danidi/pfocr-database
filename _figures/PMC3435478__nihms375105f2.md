caption: Age-related alterations in receptors and signaling molecules of CD8 T cells.
  Immune aging is associated with the accumulation of end-differentiated effector
  T cells that exhibit striking differences in the expression of signaling receptors.
  CD28 and CD27 expression is lost, expression of several ITIM- and ITSM-containing
  negative regulatory receptors is gained. Several JAK-STAT pathways are subdued,
  in part through the loss of the relevant cytokine receptor and in part due to increased
  constitutive activation of the pathway, possibly as a result of increased cytokine
  concentration and the corresponding increase in SOCS expression.
