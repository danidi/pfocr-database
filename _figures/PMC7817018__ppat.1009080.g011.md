caption: Germination of conidia and expansion of infectious hyphae are accompanied
  by cell division and the cell wall synthesis. Normally, the MEN pathway cross talks
  with the CWI pathway through MoSep1 specific phosphorylation of MoMkk1, completing
  cell division and concurrently ensuring cell wall integrity during infection. However,
  the crosstalk between cell division and CWI cannot respond when the interaction
  of MoSep1 and MoMkk1 is blocked. Septa could not be normally formed, multiple nuclei
  per cell, and disordered distribution of cell wall chitin led to disrupted cell
  division and impaired CWI. The abnormality results in loss or attenuation of pathogenicity.
