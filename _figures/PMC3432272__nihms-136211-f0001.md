caption: 'Current model of HIV-1 neuropathology and potential sites for therapeutic
  intervention (protective factors are shown in italic): Immune-activated and HIV-infected,
  brain-infiltrating macrophages (Mphi) and microglia release potentially neurotoxic
  substances. These substances include quinolinic acid and other excitatory amino
  acids such as glutamate and l-cysteine, arachidonic acid, NTox, free radicals, TNF-alpha,
  and probably others. These factors from macrophages/microglia and also possibly
  from reactive astrocytes contribute to neuronal injury, dendritic and synaptic damage,
  and apoptosis as well as to astrocytosis. Entry of HIV-1 into macrophages/microglia
  occurs via gp120 binding, and therefore it is not surprising that gp120 (or a fragment
  thereof) is capable of activating uninfected macrophages/microglia to release similar
  factors to those secreted in response to productive HIV infection. Macrophages/microglia
  express CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokine receptors on their surface in addition to CD4 and
  viral gp120 binds via these receptors. Neurons and astrocytes also possess CXCR4
  and CCR5 receptors on their surface, raising the possibility of direct interaction
  with gp120. Macrophages/microglia and astrocytes have mutual feed-back loops (bidirectional
  arrow). Cytokines participate in this multi-cellular network in several ways. For
  example, HIV-infection or gp120-stimulation of macrophages/microglia enhances their
  production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta (cytokines-arrow). The TNF-alpha and IL-1beta
  produced by macrophages/microglia stimulate astrocytosis. Arachidonate released
  from Mphi/microglia impairs astrocyte clearing of the neurotransmitter glutamate
  and thus contributes to excitotoxicity. In conjunction with cytokines, the alpha-chemokine
  SDF-1 stimulates reactive astrocytes to release glutamate in addition to the free
  radical nitric oxide (NO·), which in turn may react with superoxide (O2·-) to form
  the neurotoxic molecule peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Neuronal injury is primarily mediated
  by overactivation of NMDARs with resultant excessive influx of Ca2+. This, in turn,
  leads to overactivation of a variety of potentially harmful signaling systems, the
  formation of free radicals, and release of additional neurotransmitter glutamate.
  Glutamate subsequently overstimulates NMDARs on neighboring neurons, resulting in
  further injury. This final common pathway of neurotoxic action can be blocked by
  NMDAR antagonists. For certain neurons, depending on their exact repertoire of ionic
  channels, this form of damage can also be ameliorated to some degree by calcium
  channel antagonists or non-NMDAR antagonists. HAART suppresses HIV-1 infection primarily
  in the periphery but has limited effect in the CNS. If present, MIP-1beta and RANTES,
  agonists of β-chemokine receptors, which are expressed in the CNS on neurons, astrocytes
  and microglia, can confer partial protection against neuronal apoptosis induced
  by HIV/gp120 or NMDA. Modified from ().'
