caption: 'Upstream regulation of JNK signalling. JNK signalling can be activated by
  a variety of different upstream mechanisms. JNK signalling mediates cell morphology
  changes, such as those during embryonic dorsal closure, where it is thought to act
  via Src42A and Src64B (and/or Btk29A) to activate the kinase Shark and its adapter,
  Dok. This signalling may in turn activate Rac1 and promote JNK signalling via Slpr.
  In cells with chromosomal instability, accumulated ROS promote Ask1 signalling,
  stimulating the JNK signalling pathway to promote apoptosis. Arguably, the best
  understood pathway is the TNF-JNK signalling pathway, which is generally considered
  to be activated as a response to cellular stresses. Egr, the Drosophila TNF, binds
  to Grnd or Wgn (TNFRs), which activate Msn (JNKKKK) and Tak1 (JNKKK), via the adapter
  proteins Traf4, Tab2, and Traf6. JNK signalling is activated in polarity-impaired
  cells, which is thought to occur via the stimulation of Wnd by the actin cytoskeleton
  regulator Rho1, although TNF signalling contributes to amplify JNK activity. Lastly,
  in Drosophila wing imaginal discs, differential JNK signalling regulation by the
  SWH signalling pathway has been observed. While non-active SWH signalling allows
  Yki to promote JNK activation via Rho1, activated SWH signalling suppresses Yki
  activity, preventing bantam transcription, a miRNA that suppresses Rox8, which acts
  as a positive regulator of JNK signalling, possibly by downregulating dlg1. Msn
  is thought to be capable of activating Tak1, Wnd, and Slpr, but has not yet been
  shown to activate Ask1. Tak1, Wnd, and Ask1 are then thought to be capable of activating
  both the JNKKs, Hep and Mkk4, while Slpr has only yet been shown to act via Hep.
  Both Hep and Mkk4 can activate the sole Drosophila JNK, Bsk, which positively regulates
  a number of TFs, including the well known Jra and Kay. These TFs promote transcription
  of a number of important genes, including the apoptosis promoters hid and rpr, the
  Jak-STAT ligands upd1, upd2, and upd3, the invasion promoter Mmp1, and the negative
  JNK regulator puc. Dotted lines represent uncertain interactions. Wavy lines represent
  known physical interactions between core pathway members and (their adapters. Gene
  and protein name abbreviations used in the diagram are as follows: Src oncogene
