caption: KEGG pathway analysis of targeted genes involved into proteoglycans in cancer
  pathway. mmu-mir-6236-p3_2 targeted the FN1 gene; hsa-miR-665_R-2, was involved
  in proliferation and survival, and controlled the accumulation level of the PIK3R5
  protein in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway; hsa-miR-1296-5p targeted the HCLS1 gene,
  to respond to the MAPK signaling pathway. Red rectangle represents up-regulated
  targets and blue rectangle represents down-regulated targets
