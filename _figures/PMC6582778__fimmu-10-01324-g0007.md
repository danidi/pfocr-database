caption: Proposed model of F. nucleatum-induced M1 macrophage polarization and proinflammatory
  cytokine production via the AKT2 pathway in the context of UC. In the inflammatory
  state of UC, increased F. nucleatum induces mononuclear macrophage infiltration
  by activating AKT2 signaling and differentiation into iNOS-positive M1 cells, secreting
  a large amount of inflammatory factor TNF-α and IFN-γ, etc., which in turn damages
  the intestinal mucosal epithelial barrier and increases intestinal permeability
  and bacterial translocation, leading to increased inflammation and progression of
  the disease.
