caption: Scheme depicting the biogenesis of different classes of EVs. Exosomes originate
  from the endolysosomal pathway. The plasma membrane invaginates to form early endosomes
  in a RAB5-dependent manner. The endosomes are further trafficked and processed by
  ESCRTs, RAB7, tetraspanins, and nSMase 2 to generate multivesicular bodies (MVBs)
  containing intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). The MVBs are either trafficked by RAB7
  to lysosomes and degraded, or directed to the plasma membrane by RAB27, RAB11, or
  RAB35. The MVBs then fuse with the plasma membrane and their contents are released.
  Microvesicles are formed as an outcome of an outward budding and fission from the
  plasma membrane. This process is mediated by RHOA or ARF6 signaling events that
  regulate cytoskeletal remodeling. Exomeres and nonvesicle fractions are considered
  as unique forms of non-membrane enclosed structures that are copurified with exosomes.
  The mechanisms underlying their formation are still unknown
