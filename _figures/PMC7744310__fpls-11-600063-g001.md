caption: Hormone crosstalk in directing biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, and necrotrophic
  interactions. During trophic divergence, SA orchestrates both biotrophic and hemibiotrophic
  interactions, while JA/ET orchestrates both necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic interactions.
  By interacting with SA, JA/ET, and other hormones, auxin, CK, ABA, GA, BR, and SL
  as well as their important biosynthesis, transport and response genes, receptors,
  regulatory components, and transcription factors are all involved in directing trophic
  divergence, and their crosstalk are widely diversified across these three trophic
  interactions. Red upward triangle arrows are used to indicate positive regulators
  for host immunity, and blue downward triangle arrows for negative regulators for
  host immunity in each specific trophic interaction. Black triangle arrows are denoted
  for positive regulations in the pathway, while black round arrows for negative regulations
  in the pathway. Question marks designate potential regulations that require further
  investigations. Trophic divergence by different hormones are separated by horizontal
  dotted lines, while different regulatory modules within a trophic interaction are
  separated by vertical dotted lines.
