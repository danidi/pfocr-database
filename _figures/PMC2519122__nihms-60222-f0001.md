caption: When ligands such as growth factors or insulin bind their receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) the RTKs dimerize and activate their kinase activity, resulting in
  phosphorylation of tyrosine sites on adaptor proteins such as the insulin receptor
  substrate (IRS) family. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites
  for adaptor proteins such as GRB2, which recruit Ras guanine-nucleotide-exchange
  factors (GEFs) such as SOS. SOS stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras. GTP-Ras
  activates its downstream pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
  and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is one of the GTPase-activating
  proteins (GAPs), which binds to activated Ras and catalyse GTP hydrolysis, hence
  returns Ras to its inactive GDP-binding state. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog
  deleted on chromosome 10) dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 back to PI(4,5)P2 to antagonize
  PI3K.AKT is activated by PI3K and phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase (PDK). AKT activation inhibits the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)-TSC2
  heterodimer, which is a key negative regulator of mTOCR1 by suppressing a small
  GTP-binding protein, Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb). Growth factors, DNA
  damage, energy depletion, and hypoxia activate TSC1-TSC2 through different signaling
  pathways. The main function of the mTORC1 pathway is to regulate mRNA translation
  and ribosome biogenesis by phosphorylating and activating p70S6K1, which is an important
  regulator of cell size by controlling ribosomal protein translation. P70S6K1 inhibits
  IRS1 by directly phosphorylating it, thus forming a feedback loop. mTORC1 also phosphorylates
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (4EBP) and suppresses
  its function to inhibit the mRNA cap-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor
  4E (eIF4E). Growth factors regulate the activity of mTORC2 through PTKs. In addition
  to regulating the organization of actin, mTORC2 directly phosphorylates AKT on the
  hydrophobic site of its C-terminal, which is necessary for full AKT activation.
  Several other proteins, including cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-cyclin D1 complexes,
  p27, pRb, and polymerases interact with mTOR. Thus, the mTOR pathway is involved
  in regulating the translation of proteins associated with drug resistance, controlling
  cell cycle progression and apoptosis and thereby contributes to cancer cell drug
  resistance.
