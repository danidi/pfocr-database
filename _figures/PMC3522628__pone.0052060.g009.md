caption: Treatment of astrocytes with gp120 results in the binding of gp120 by the
  CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine receptors and the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and
  p38-MAPK. The activation of these two pathways may lead to increased activation
  of NF-κB. The activated NF-κB then translocates into the nucleus and increases the
  transcription of IL-6. Treatment of astrocytes with MA results in activation of
  metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). The mechanism of mGluR5 activation by
  MA is unclear, but one possibility is that the increase in extracellular glutamate
  caused by MA treatment may activate the receptor. mGluR5 then activates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway  which can lead to activation of NF-κB and increased expression of IL-6.
  Thus, gp120 and MA can induce higher expression levels of IL-6 as compared to the
  levels observed in the presence of either agent alone.
