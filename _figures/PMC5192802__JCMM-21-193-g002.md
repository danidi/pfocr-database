caption: The roles of nucleus PRDX1 in the H2O2‐induced apoptosis. It is also known
  that PRDX1 functions as a chaperone in the form of oligomers, and molecular chaperone
  activities enhanced under oxidative stress conditions. PRDX1 oligomer directly interacts
  with the transcription factors including c‐Myc, NF‐κB and AR, and thus affects their
  bioactivities upon gene regulation, which in turn induces or suppresses cell death.
  In addition, p53 induces the expression of apoptosis factors such as Bak and Bax
  under oxidative stress conditions, and promotes the activation of caspases and p53‐dependent
  mitochondria apoptotic signalling pathway. Importantly, PRDX1 oligomer is an essential
  intermediate in H2O2‐induced activation of c‐Abl/MST1/FOXO signalling pathway and
  cell apoptosis through direct interaction with p53. Furthermore, it has been recognized
  that c‐Abl acts as a modulator of p53. PRDX1oli, PRDX1 oligomer.
