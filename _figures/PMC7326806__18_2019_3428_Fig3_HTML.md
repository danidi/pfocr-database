  (Down) Mutant p53 inhibits the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor
  2 (NRF2)-mediated antioxidant enzymes, and thus induces reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) cyclin E cannot translocate into the
  nucleus, and forms LMW cyclin E cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complex in the
  cytoplasm, thereby activating oncogenic functions, such as tumor cell invasion and
  metastasis. (Top left) Amyloid-β (Aβ), Aβ fibrils and plaques are formed from amyloid
  precursor protein (APP) via amyloidogenic processing. Cyclin D1 promotes tau phosphorylation
  and induces apoptosis through a caspase 3-mediated pathway. PP2A dephosphorylates
  phosphorylated tau, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) phosphorylates tau.
  Reduced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) induces
  the increase of ROS production, which leads to the conformational change of p53,
  and this unfolded p53 is also observed in AD. (Top right) Mutant parkin and glutamate
  excitotoxicity increase cyclin E accumulation, which induces apoptosis. In addition,
  p53 also induces the upregulation of apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 associated
  X (Bax) and caspases 3, which is observed in the PD brain. The interaction between
  Pin1 and synphilin-1 (an α-synuclein-binding protein) enhances the formation of
  α-synuclein inclusions, and this α-synuclein inclusion formation can be inhibited
  by PP2A. ER endoplasmic reticulum, HO-1 heme oxygenase-1, NQO1 quinone oxidoreductase
  1, PM plasma membrane. Molecule name marked in purple indicates studies that involve
  exogenous proteins
