caption: Regulation of DNA damage response and repair by Pontin/Reptin. (A) TIP60
  complex. Pontin and Reptin participate in the TIP60 complex to promote DNA damage
  signaling and repair. UPPER—TIP60 regulates the activation and removal of phospho-H2AX
  signal through acetylation of various proteins. LOWER—Pontin methylation by PRMT5
  is required for the acetylation of H4 by TIP60. This acetylation prevents the binding
  of 53BP1 to the methylation site on H4 but allows BRCA1 to bind, thus promoting
  homologous recombination. (B) INO80 complex. Pontin and Reptin participate in the
  INO80 complex to promote homologous recombination. The INO80 complex is recruited
  to the DNA damage site by phospho-H2AX. It is involved in RPA-mediated DNA end resection
  as well as RAD51-mediated DNA strand invasion, likely by the removal of H2A.Z and
  in complex with YY1. (C) Fanconi Anemia core complex. Pontin and Reptin stabilize
  the FA core complex either directly or through its stabilizing activity of the ATR
  kinase, which then activates the FA pathway.
