caption: Arachidonic acid is converted to prostaglandins by action of cyclooxygenase
  1 and 2 Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes. Cox-1 is important for maintaining homeostatic
  functions of body like platelet formation for blood, kidney development and its
  functions, maintenance of gastric mucosa etc. Cox-2 derived prostaglandin PGE2 is
  associated with increased inflammation, increased angiogenesis, greater metastatic
  and proliferative invasion, reduction in apoptosis and formation of immunosuppressive
  microenvironment. NSAIDs function as cox inhibitors and serve as effective tool
  against Cox mediated cancer. Aspirin and several other dual acting NSAIDs, which
  can block both Cox-1 and Cox-2 pathway, have several limitations and side effects
  associated with them and thus there was a need to develop Cox-2 specific inhibitors.
  NSAIDs reduce incidences of cancer by increasing apoptosis of tumor tissue, maintaining
  anti-tumor microenvironment, reducing proliferation and angiogenesis
