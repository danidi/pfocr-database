caption: . Model of polymorphonuclear (PMN)-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in colon
  epithelial cells. An oxidative burst of activated PMNs releases a variety of genotoxic
  factors [including, but not limited to reactive oxygen species (ROS)] which lead
  to replication errors [in our system a frameshift at a (CA)13 microsatellite] followed
  by a G2/M cell cycle arrest. The G2/M checkpoint prevents cells from initiating
  mitosis when they experience DNA damage. This pathway relies on the presence of
  functional hMSH2 which is an essential component of the hMutS heterodimer (that
  also includes hMSH3 or hMSH6; depicted in orange). The hMutS heterodimer acts as
  a sensor of replication errors and may initiate mismatch repair (by recruiting the
  hMutL complex). hMSH2 is capable of physically interacting with ATR forming a signalling
  module. Next, the checkpoint kinase Chk1 undergoes ATR-mediated phosphorylation.
  Active Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25c which is inactivated and cells are halted at G2/M.
  ATR also mediates the phosphorylation of the tumour suppressor p53 (at site serine
  15) causing accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and cell cycle
  arrest. The presence of hMSH2, p53 and p21 are essential for the PMN-driven installation
  of this G2/M checkpoint, a pathway that acts independently of hMLH1 (which is needed
  for mismatch repair).
