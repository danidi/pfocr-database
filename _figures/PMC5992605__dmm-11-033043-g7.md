caption: Schematic model describing the molecular responses to SIL1 loss in skeletal
  muscles leading to myopathy. (1) A functional depletion of SIL1 compromises the
  chaperoning ability of BiP, leading to an increase in chaperones in an attempt to
  maintain normal protein folding in the ER. However, this compensation is insufficient,
  resulting in client misfolding and aggregation. (2) Degradation pathways are upregulated
  to deal with accumulating misfolded proteins but are heavily taxed, leading to the
  build-up of ubiquitinated proteins and induction of small heat shock proteins to
  sequester aggregates. (3) In keeping with SIL1's role in protein folding, disruption
  of ER homeostasis adversely affects maturation of secretory pathway clients in the
  ER. (4) Consequentially, this results in a decrease in the amount of some clients,
  such as IR-β and IGF1R-β, which play critical roles in maintaining skeletal muscle
  protein and glucose homeostasis. Disruption of normal signaling via these axes,
  in combination with other factors, such as an increase in GADD45A levels, eventually
  shifts the balance between anabolic and catabolic cellular mechanisms towards catabolic,
  atrophy-causing pathway(s) that lead to cyto-architecture disruption as well as
  decreased muscle mass and strength in the Sil1Gt MSS mouse model.
