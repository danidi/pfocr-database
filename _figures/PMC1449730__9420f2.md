caption: Crossing scheme for the screen. EMS-mutagenized males were crossed to females
  with the C765-Gal4,UAS-Smo5A tester chromosome (C5). The F1 progeny with enhancement
  or suppression of the C5 phenotype were crossed to the backcross strain (containing
  the C5 chromosome, the second chromosome dominant marker Bristle, and second and
  third chromosome balancers). F2 flies that showed penetrant modification of the
  C5 phenotype were again crossed to the backcross strain to generate a balanced mutant
  stock and to map the modifying mutation to the second or third chromosome.
