caption: A, the mammalian polyamine metabolic pathway. The diamine PUT is derived
  from ornithine via ODC, the first rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis.
  Sequential aminopropyl group additions by spermidine synthase (SRM) and SMS, using
  decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) as a donor, create SPD and SPM, respectively.
  Catabolism of SPM and SPD occurs via acetylation by SSAT followed by oxidation by
  PAOX. SPM can also be directly oxidized to SPD by SMOX. In SRS, SMS function is
  decreased or absent, spermidine accumulates, and spermine levels are severely reduced.
  B, structure of (R,R)-1,12-Me2SPM mimetic.
