caption: Figure 1. α-TEA-mediated antitumor activity is mediated by three mechanisms.
  First, α-TEA targets tumor cell mitochondria and generates reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), and causes membrane depolarization resulting in activation of the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway (blue). Second, α-TEA triggers tumor cell autophagy and autophagic
  death (orange) that in addition to apoptotic cell death contributes to tumor cell
  destruction. Autophagosome formation requires lipidated LC3-II that is generated
  from LC3-I through attachment of a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) residue. ATG4 catalyzes
  an earlier step needed for this PE conjugation, but also acts as a deconjugating
  enzyme for recycling LC3-I. Oxidation of ATG4 by ROS inhibits the delipidation of
  LC3, thus promoting accumulation of LC3-II and autophagosomes. Third, α-TEA also
  activates a tumor-specific immune response (green) by generation of autophagosomes
  containing tumor antigens that are taken up by professional antigen-presenting cells
  (APC). After processing, tumor antigens are either cross-presented to CD8+ T cells
  or directly presented to CD4+ T cells. The resulting antitumor T cell response is
  the third front of attack of the tumor leading to its destruction.
