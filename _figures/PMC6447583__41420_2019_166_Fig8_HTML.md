caption: 'a Inflammatory conditions in primary astrocytes: LPS activates NFκB that
  promotes the expression of (1) molecules that generate inflammation and (2) the
  Notch ligand Jag-1 that reduces Notch activity and consequently induce a reactive
  morphology in astrocytes. b Anti-inflammatory conditions in primary astrocytes:
  IGF-1 produces an increase of Notch activity by: (1) activating MAPK signaling pathway
  and (2) reducing Jag-1 NFκB-dependent expression. Both IGF-1 effects drive to enhance
  Hes-5 expression and result in a resting morphology in astrocytes'
