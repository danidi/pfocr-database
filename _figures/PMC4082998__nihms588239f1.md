caption: Electrical activity of neurons results in the release of large amounts of
  K+ by these cells into extracellular space. As the neuronal Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA)
  is already saturated for extracellular K+, a substantial fraction of the excess
  extracellular K+ is taken up by low affinity astrocytic NKA/FXYD7. NKA action hydrolyzes
  ATP to ADP and thus stimulates adenylate kinase (AK) to produce AMP. AMP allosterically
  activates glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and glycogen degradation. AMP also stimulates
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates glycogen synthase (GS)
  thereby inhibiting glycogen synthesis, which favors net glycogenolysis. K+ uptake
  by NKA is accompanied by Na+ extrusion. Thus, intracellular Na+ is necessary for
  NKA activity. Availability of Na+ inside astrocytes is supported by extracellular
  Na+ level sensitive Na+ channel (Nax, top left), sodium bicarbonate cotransporter
  (NBC, top middle) and Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter plus anion exchanger (NKCC/AE, top
  right). Note that the NKCC/AE is the most efficient system for extracellular K+
  clearance, as indicated by the net ion transport underlying the hydrolysis of 1
  ATP to AMP plus 2 inorganic phosphates. Bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) is taken up because
  of the concerted action of NBC and possibly NKCC plus AE. HCO3− activates soluble
  adenylate cyclase (sAC) and downstream cyclic AMP (cAMP) production and cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase A (PKA) activation. PKA has several target proteins including glycogen
  phosphorylase kinase (PhK), which phosphorylates GP resulting in further glycogen
  degradation. Note that AMP is still being produced by the conversion of cAMP to
  AMP by the PKA-stimulated phosphodiesterase IV (PDEIV). PKA phoshorylates L-type
  Ca2+ channels (LCC) and perhaps Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and NKCC leading to increase
  in Ca2+ influx. Cytosolic Ca2+ can also be liberated from intracellular stores through
  activation of inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), which is part of the NKA signalosome.
  Ca2+ allosterically stimulates PhK, GP phosphorylation and glycogenolysis. NKA can
  be inhibited via phosphorylation by PKA and Ca2+-activated protein kinase C (PKC),
  resulting in the stimulation of NKA-bound Src kinase. PKA directly phosphorylates
  Src, which initiates through an extracellular growth factor receptor (EGFR) the
  extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. ERK phosphorylation inhibits
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) resulting in glycogen resynthesis. The same effect
  on GSK3 can be produced by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/PKB)
  pathway. Finally, active Src in turn inhibits PKA and thus represents a primary
  candidate for terminating the K+-induced glycogenolytic effect.
