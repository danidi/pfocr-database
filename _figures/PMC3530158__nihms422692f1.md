caption: MAPK signaling pathway and B-Raf derangements in gliomas. (A) Under normal
  circumstances Raf proteins require activation by Ras before activating MEK, which
  ultimately leads to promotion of cell division, survival, and in certain circumstances,
  differentiation. B-Raf is a more potent activator of MEK than C-Raf, which in turn
  is more potent than A-Raf. GF = growth factor; RTK = receptor tyrosine kinase. (B)
  When the N-terminal Ras-binding portion of B-Raf is lost in a BRAF:KIAA1549 (B–K)
  fusion, the mutant protein can activate MEK without first being activated by Ras,
  leading to tumor growth. A similar situation exists with SRGAP3:RAF1 fusion, wherein
  the kinase portion of C-Raf is joined to SRGAP3 (C–S). A V600E point mutation on
  B-Raf also has constitutive activity towards MEK. When the p16 checkpoint protein
  is intact, persistent over-activation of the MAPK pathway can lead to tumor senescence.
