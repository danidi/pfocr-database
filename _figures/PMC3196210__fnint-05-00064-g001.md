caption: '(A) Main components of the circadian timing system. Circadian rhythms consists
  of three main components: (i) an input pathway integrating exogenous signals to
  synchronize circadian phase and period, (ii) a central oscillator that generates
  the endogenous circadian signal, and (iii) an output pathway driving circadian periodicity
  and coupling of biological processes. (B) Molecular mechanisms of circadian timing.
  The molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms can be illustrated by the transcription
  of the Period (Per1and Per2) and Cryptochrome (Cry1, Cry2) genes that are activated
  by heteromeric complexes containing CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins that act through the
  E-box regulatory sequences of their target genes. The newly synthesized PER and
  CRY proteins are translocated into the nucleus, where they inhibit BMAL1–CLOCK activity,
  and therefore, their own transcription. Clock and Bmal1 both contain basic helix–loop–helix
  (bHLH) motifs for DNA binding at their N-terminus and Per–Arnt–Sim (PAS) domains.
  The controlled degradation of PER and CRY proteins by the ubiquitin pathway decreases
  their protein levels and results in an oscillation of their mRNA and protein levels.
  During this negative transcriptional feedback loop many of the clock proteins become
  posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation and ubiquitination (Reppert and
  Weaver, ). This core oscillation is augmented and stabilized by a secondary loop
  involving two orphan nuclear receptor proteins, REV-ERBα and RORA. Both are activated
  in phase with the Per and Cry genes by CLOCK and BMAL1, but in turn they affect
  Bmal1 expression (Preitner et al., ). While RORA has a positive role, REV-ERBα is
  a suppressor of Bmal1, and they coordinate action through RORE regulatory sequences.
  A positive feedback loop is built by the stimulated transcription of BMAL1 by PER2.
  Protein phosphorylation events are essential contributors to these feedback loops.
  Two members of the casein kinase I family (CKIε and CKIδ) phosphorylate PER proteins
  in order to (i) target them for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, and
  (ii) modulate their nuclear import. A mutation of CKIε shortens rhythm in hamsters
  (Lowrey et al., ) and a mutation of CKIδ shortens rhythm in humans (Xu et al., ).
  The result of these complex regulatory pathways is that the mRNA and protein levels
  of most circadian genes – except Clock and CKIε – oscillate with a 24-h period.
  Importantly, the CLOCK–BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the transcription of many clock-controlled
  genes (CCGs), which in turn influence a wide array of physiological functions external
  to the oscillatory mechanism. This mediates the output function of the clock, thereby
  controlling food intake, hormonal synthesis and release, body temperature, metabolism,
  and many other functions.'
