caption: A schematic presentation of the proposed TGF-β and PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling
  alteration that promotes HNSCC in mice. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway due to
  Pten deletion initiates tumor formation by increasing proliferation in the head
  and neck epithelia. However, Pten deletion alone is not sufficient to induce invasive
  HNSCC due to the induction of premature senescence by p-Akt in the presence of tumor
  suppressors such as TGF-β. In combination with the additional loss of Tgfbr1, which
  results in a loss of tumor inhibition by TGF-β signaling, premalignant cells cannot
  undergo cellular senescence. They will therefore progress into cancer cells through
  mechanisms which include increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, senescence
  evasion and overproduction of epithelial stem cells. Decreased Tgfbr1 can also increase
  chemokine production in tumor stroma, which leads to enhanced recruitment of MDSCs.
  This results in increased inflammation, angiogenesis, and immune suppression, which
  contribute significantly to mouse head and neck carcinogenesis.
