caption: Aflatoxin biosynthesis. (A) Domain architecture of the aflatoxin NR-PKS.
  (B) Biosynthetic pathway of aflatoxin starts with a hexanoyl starter unit and undergoes
  seven rounds of elongation to yield a C20 linear intermediate 1. Gray and black
  bars represent diketone groups. The PT domain cyclizes a C4–C9 and C2–C11 reaction
  2 that is subsequently aromatized and released by the TE domain 3. Further biosynthetic
  processing yields aflatoxin B13b. Absence of the TE yields pyrone product 4.
