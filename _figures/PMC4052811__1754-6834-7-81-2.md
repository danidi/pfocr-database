caption: 'Deduced pathway of sterol biosynthesis in N. oceanica, comparison among
  plants, humans and yeasts, and sites of action of inhibitors. Enzyme nomenclature
  is that commonly used in Arabidopsis, because although many human and yeast enzymes
  have different names and abbreviations, they catalyze equivalent reactions to those
  of the Arabidopsis enzymes. An exception is Arabidopsis DWF1 (a dual isomerase-reductase),
  which is absent in Nannochloropsis; instead, this alga has a human-type DHCR24 (the
  yeast equivalent is ERG4). Full names and functions of enzymes are provided in Additional
  file : Table S1. Lanosterol synthase (LAS) is found in Arabidopsis but has a minor
  role. Enzyme abbreviations: DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; HMGR,
  hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase; HMGS, hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase;
  SQE, squalene epoxidase; CAS, cycloartenol synthase; LAS, lanosterol synthase; SMT,
  sterol methytransferase; SMO, sterol 4-methyl oxidase; CPI, cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase;
  CYP51, sterol 14-alpha demethylase; FK, sterol C-14 reductase; HYD, sterol C-8 isomerase;
  DWF7, delta7 sterol C-5 desaturase; DWF5, sterol C-7 reductase; DWF1, sterol C-24(28)
  isomerase-reductase; CYP710A, sterol C-22 desaturase; DHCR24, dihydrocholesterol
  reductase; ERG4, sterol delta 24(28) reductase. Abbreviations for metabolites: MEP,
  methylerythritol phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; MVA, mevalonic acid.
  Abbreviations for inhibitors: CLO, clomazone; TBF, terbinafine; 25-AZA, 25-azalanosterol;
  TDM, tridemorph; TEB, tebuconazole.'
