caption: Activated AMPK acutely triggers the destruction of existing defective mitochondria
  via ULK1-dependent mitophagy and simultaneously triggers the biogenesis of new mitochondria
  via effects on PGC-1a dependent transcription. These dual processes controlled by
  AMPK have the net effect of replacing existing defective mitochondria with new functional
  mitochondria. This two-pronged control of mitochondria homeostasis by AMPK will
  have a number of physiological and pathological conditions where it plays a critical
  role, and a few are illustrated here.
