caption: 'Rho GTPase family signaling. (A) Differential gene expression in DKO mice
  versus WT mice. (B) Differential gene expression in DKO mice after ACE-I. GTPases
  regulate a wide range of biological processes. The mammalian GTPase family currently
  consists of three subfamilies: Rho, Rac and Cdc42 and each affect numerous downstream
  molecules that mediate effects on the cytoskeleton and gene expression. The small
  GTPases act as molecular switches, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and
  an inactive GDP-bound state. A number of proteins have been identified as targets
  of Rho with ROCK being a prominent target. ROCK phosphorylates MLC, which plays
  an important role in actomyosin contractility. ROCK also activates LIMK, which results
  in Cofilin inactivation and leads to actin polymerization. Rac and Cdc42 also bind
  to PI3K, thus activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Red = upregulated, green = downregulated.
