caption: Working model for Suv4-20h2 and H4K20me3 effects on cell cycle progression
  in embryos. Expression of Suv4-20h2 establishes higher levels of H4K20me3, which
  is a known target of ORCA. In turn, ORCA can recruit ORC during early S phase to
  replication origins. The increased levels of H4K20me3 lead to increased ORC loading,
  which would result in higher levels of ssDNA, as measured by EdU labeling. The increase
  in ssDNA can activate the ATR pathway, which promotes CHK2 phosphorylation, leading
  to the activation of the intra-S-phase checkpoint, causing a delay in cell cycle
  progression and developmental arrest.
