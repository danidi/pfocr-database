caption: 'Schematic representation of the signaling pathways activated by N. meningitidis
  and involved in bacterial entry into endothelial cells. (1) Type IV pili initiate
  the interaction of virulent, capsulated N. meningitidis with human endothelial cells
  by interacting with a cellular receptor that remains to be clearly identified. Bacteria
  then proliferate, locally forming a colony at their site of attachment on the cell
  surface. (2) This pili- dependent adhesion induces, through a Rho GTPase-independent
  pathway, the recruitment of ezrin and moesin, two proteins that link the cellular
  membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, and the clustering of several transmembrane
  proteins: ErbB2 and the ezrin binding proteins CD44 and ICAM-1. (3) The activation
  of both Rho and Cdc42 GTPases induces a localized polymerization of cortical actin,
  leading to the formation of membrane projections reminiscent of epithelial microvilli
  structures, which surround single bacteria and provoke their internalization within
  endothelial intracellular vacuoles. Downstream of bacteria- induced ErbB2 activation
  are the ras/MAPK signaling pathway, and the src tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates
  cortactin, and is involved in bacterial entry.'
