caption: Proposed mechanisms of Wnt/β-catenin dysregulation in ovarian cancer. The
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway is regulated by many factors, whose aberrant expression leads
  to the hyperactivation of β-catenin in the EOC. Note that green arrows indicate
  proteins whose expression is upregulated in EOC, while red arrows indicate downregulation.
  DKK1 and SFRP2, which inhibit the dimerization of FZD and LRP5/6 and directly prevent
  FZD activation, respectively, are downregulated in EOC tumors. In contrast, Wnt
  ligands activate the pathway by forming a receptor complex with FZD and LRP5/6,
  while R-spondins bind LGRs and prevent the sequestration of the FZD. Both ligands
  and LGRs are overexpressed EOC. CCNY and CDK14 are also upregulated in EOC and have
  been suggested to work together to promote LRP5/6 phosphorylation and therefore
  activation. CCNG2, which is downregulated in EOC, decreases LPR6 and DVL levels.
  It may also interact with DACT1, also downregulated in EOC tumors, to promote DVL
  degradation. TNKS destabilizes AXIN to increase β-catenin activity and TNKS1 is
  known to be up-regulated in EOC. RAB14 inhibits the activity of GSK-3β and its upregulation
  contributes to higher β-catenin activity in EOC. FLIP1L, whose expression is negatively
  correlated with EOC progression, enhances GSK-3β activation in the destruction complex
  and is downregulated in EOC. This inhibition of the destruction complex results
  in the accumulation of β-catenin within the cytosol and its translocation into the
  nucleus. In addition, TG2, which is overexpressed in EOC, binds to integrin and
  fibronectin. This results in the recruitment of c-Src and disruption of E-cadherin/β-catenin
  complex on the membrane, which contributes to the accumulation of β-catenin within
  the cytoplasm. Finally, within the nucleus, higher expression of several co-activators
  of β-catenin/TCF, such as PYGO, JRK, and FOXM1, and lower expression of SOX7, which
  is known to inhibit the interaction between β-catenin and TCF, lead to the higher
  transcriptional activity of this complex
