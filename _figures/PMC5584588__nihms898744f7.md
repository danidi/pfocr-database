caption: Ultraviolet light (UV) creates lesions in DNA (X) that stall the elongating
  RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription complex. During prolonged stalling, the
  last resort pathway leads to Pol II mono-ubiquitination (Pol II-Ub) and poly-ubiquitination
  (Pol II-Ubn), resulting in Pol II degradation and providing DNA repair factors with
  access to the lesion. RNA processing factors (CFIA and CPF) co-transcriptionally
  associate with Pol II prior to recognition of RNA sequences at the p(A) 3’-end processing
  site. Additionally, we propose that CFIA and CPF promote ubiquitination and degradation
  of stalled Pol II, followed by DNA repair via a TC-NER independent pathway.
