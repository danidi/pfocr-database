caption: 'Metabolic reconstruction of DMS and thiosulfate metabolism in H. denitrificans
  XT based on genome sequence analysis, comparative proteomics, and reverse genetics.
  Fold changes (log2) in protein abundancies are given next to proteins detected as
  significant in the proteomic study. Prosthetic groups are indicated: orange boxes,
  [4Fe–4S]; red diamond, non-cubane [4Fe–4S], yellow oval, FAD. DMS, MO DMS monooxygenase;
  MTO, methanethiol oxidase; TsdA, thiosulfate dehydrogenase'

papertitle: A novel bacterial sulfur oxidation pathway provides a new link between
  the cycles of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds.
