caption: The bipartite metabolic model of C. burnetii (A) and L. pneumophila (B).
  The network is divided into two modules. Module 1 comprises glycolytic and gluconeogenetic
  reactions, the ED pathway, the shikimate/chorismate pathway as well as the biosynthesis
  of cell wall components. Module 2 includes the TCA cycle, fatty acid and PHB biosynthesis
  as well as the biosynthesis of the central cell wall component DAP. Color and size
  of arrows indicate direction and intensity of carbon flux from serine (green), glucose
  (blue) and glycerol (red). Serine serves as a main carbon and energy source which
  is predominantly metabolized in the TCA cycle for energy generation in both pathogens
  (Module 2). Nevertheless, in C. burnetii serine is not metabolized in as high rates
  as in L. pneumophila. Furthermore, carbon flux from this amino acid occurs exclusively
  into the second part of metabolism (TCA cycle) in C. burnetii, whereas carbon flux
  from serine also occurs into the upper part of metabolism in L. pneumophila. Glucose
  catabolism differs in both pathogenic bacteria. While C. burnetii degrades glucose
  in glycolytic reactions, L. pneumophila uses predominantly the Entner-Doudoroff
  pathway. Thereby, C. burnetii uses glucose very efficiently in both parts of metabolism,
  also for tyrosine biosynthesis via the shikimate pathway. In contrast, usage of
  glucose by L. pneumophila is much lower and more restricted toward the upper part
  of metabolism. Glycerol is metabolized at very low rates by L. pneumophila and thereby
  used exclusively in gluconeogenetic reactions and the PPP. In contrast, it effectively
  serves as carbon source for both modules in C. burnetii, and also for tyrosine biosynthesis
  in the shikimate pathway. Furthermore, glycerol is preferably used for cell wall
  biosynthesis by C. burnetii. α-KGA, α-ketoglutarate; DAP, diaminopimelate; Pyr,
