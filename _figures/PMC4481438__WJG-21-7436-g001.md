caption: 'Effect of ileal bile acid transporter in the proximal ileum. BA synthesis
  is a major metabolic pathway for catabolism of cholesterol. Primary BAs, CA and
  CDCA, are obtained via the alternative (acidic) pathway, initiated by mitochondrial
  CYP27A1, or by the classical (neutral) biosynthetic pathway, catalyzed by microsomal
  CYP7A1. CYP7A1 is a rate-limiting enzyme that regulates the overall rate of BA synthesis
  in the liver. The activity of CYP7A1 depends upon the quantity of BAs absorbed in
  the intestine. Inhibition of IBAT contributes to upregulation of BA synthesis and
  therefore promotes the maintenance of BA pool size. Simultaneously, a decrease in
  the concentration of serum LDL and an increase of C4 level, which is a surrogate
  for CYP7A1 activity, may occur. BACS and BAT are two key enzymes involved in the
  conjugation of BA to amino acids (G or T). In the intestine, conjugated G/T-CDCA
  and G/T-CA are dehydroxylated to the secondary BAs, DCA and LCA. The action of a
  selective IBAT inhibitor increases the concentration of BAs entering the proximal
  colon, which in turn stimulates colonic motility and secretion resulting in enhanced
  laxative properties. BA: Bile acid; BACS: Bile acid CoA synthase; BAT: Bile acid
  amino acid transferase; CA: Cholic acid; CDCA: Chenodeoxycholic acids; CYP27A1:
  Sterol 27 hydroxylase; CYP7B1: Nonspecific 7α-hydroxylase; DCA: Deoxycholic acid;
  G: Glycine; IBAT: Ileal bile acid transporter; LCA: Lithocholic acid; LDL: Low-density
  lipoprotein; T: Taurine. Modified from[-].'
