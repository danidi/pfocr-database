caption: Distribution of asymmetrically regulated genes at various levels of Gene
  Ontology (GO) categories. The genes identified in this study were imported into
  the GoMiner program to generate directed acylic graphs (DAG) for the biological
  processes and molecular functions represented by the changes and were based on current
  annotations in the GO database. Each node of the DAG represents one GO category
  at various levels, and the relative size of the node is indicative of the number
  of genes in each category. The thirty two genes differentially expressed in dominant
  vs. submissive PAG (panels A, B) were used as queries and loaded into GoMiner to
  classify these genes into each GO category. The distribution of these genes is represented
  by a different color at each node. The color of the node indicates enrichment (red),
  depletion (blue) or no change (gray) of the genes compared with the distribution
  over all identified genes at that level. Several critical GO categories are labeled.
  The actual nodes contained in each pathway are depicted in the shaded yellow boxes.
  The individual statistically significant differentially expressed genes within each
  pathway are denoted within the shaded blue boxes. For each pathway, the fold enrichment
  with the statistical significance of the enrichment for each category is shown below.
