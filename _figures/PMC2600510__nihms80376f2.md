caption: Regulation of hepatic stellate cell contraction. Soluble factors associated
  with liver injury, such as endothelin-1 and nitric oxide, are transduced primarily
  through rho signaling pathways that promote the myosin II-powered generation of
  contractile force by stellate cells. Dashed arrows indicate subordinate Ca2+signaling
  pathway. ET-1, endothelin-1; GPCR, G protein coupled receptor; MLCK, myosin light
  chain kinase; RhoA, rho family GTPase; ROK, rho-associated kinase; MLCP, myosin
  light chain phosphatase; NO, nitric oxide; MLC, myosin light chain; PO4, phosphate.
