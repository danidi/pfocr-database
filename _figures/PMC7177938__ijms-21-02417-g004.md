caption: Gene-Ontology (GO) term enrichment and pathway term network analysis of DEGs
  shared by ADJ versus PRE and ATT versus PRE lists (1928 DEPs). (A) Upregulated DEGs
  (651 DEPs). (B) Downregulated DEGs (1277 DEPs). GO enrichment analysis was performed
  by the ClueGO [] plugin in Cytoscape []. Two databases were used, including GO (BP,
  MF, and CC) and Reactome pathways for retrieving associated terms. Only the networks
  and pathways with p < 0.05 are illustrated. Functionally grouped networks with terms
  as nodes linked by edges based on their kappa score level (≥0.4) are shown. Related-GO
  terms are grouped and illustrated with distinct color and labeled with the same
  color. The node size represents the significance of term enrichment. Functionally
  related groups partially overlap. When a particular GO term is shared by two or
  more different GO cluster groups, the node is shown by multiple colors. The shape
  of the nodes indicates the source of the database from where a term was retrieved
  (ellipse, GO_BP; rectangle, GO_MF; triangle, GO_CC; Reactome, hexagon). The thickness
  of edges indicates the kappa score (strength of intra-connectivity between cluster
  groups). Related clusters are shown together within a dotted border and labeled
  with broad themes for discussion purposes. Refer to the  for details and high-resolution
  images.
