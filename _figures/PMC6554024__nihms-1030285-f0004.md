caption: After entering a cell, viral genetic material may be recognized by one or
  more of the host’s PRRs. These include RLRs, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cGAS.
  Recognition by one or more of these PRRs triggers a signalling cascade that culminates
  in the transcription and subsequent generation of IFNs. Different viruses have evolved
  to antagonize these pathways at virtually all stages, indicated by blunt end arrows.
  Solid arrows indicate direct pathway connections. Dashed arrows indicate signal
  cascade components present in vivo but not shown for space concerns. Asterisks indicate
  viral antagonism by an unknown mechanism. See  for specific mechanisms at each stage.
