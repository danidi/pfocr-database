caption: COVID-19 pathogenesis and MSCs role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 related
  complications (1) SARS-CoV-2 enters alveolar type II cells through binding ACE2.
  As a result, angiotensin II accumulates in the alveoli and binds to ATR1, which
  acts as a lung damage promoting factor and induces vasoconstriction, inflammation,
  fibrosis, and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells. (2.1) M1 alveolar macrophages
  produce various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1.
  TNF-α depletion during the severe phase of COVID-19 activates the extrinsic apoptosis
  pathway in the alveolar cells and results in massive lung tissue fibrosis. (2.2)
  TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 secretion by M1 alveolar macrophages attract both MSCs to
  the site of inflammation. (2.3) IL-1β and TNF-α increase hyaluronic acid production
  by type II surfactant-secreting alveolar cells and fibroblasts. (3.1) MSCs produce
  IL-1ra, which competes with IL-1, secreted from M1 macrophages, for the IL-1 receptor
  and suppresses IL-1 effects. (3.2) MSCs decrease TNF-α production of macrophages
  by their secreted exosomes such as mir-451 containing exosomes. (4.1) IL-1, TNF-α,
  IL-6, and IL-8 production by alveolar macrophages increase immune cell accumulation
  in the alveoli. (4.2, 3) M1 macrophages secrete IL-6 and TGF-β, increasing naïve
  T cell differentiation to T helper 17 cells and decreasing naïve T cell differentiation
  to regulatory T cells. (5) MSCs reduce immune cell infiltration to the alveoli through
  the secretion of IL-10, KGF, and IGF-1. (6.1) MSCs increase M2 phenotype macrophages
  and, as a result, decrease inflammatory cytokines production by M1 macrophages.
  MSCs increase the infiltration of macrophages to the site of thrombosis. (6.2) M2
  macrophages promote tissue repair through several mechanisms, such as vessel recanalization.
  They secrete VEGF and bFGF, which support the proliferation of endothelial cells.
  (7) PGE-2, IDO, and COX-2 are secreted by MSC that inhibit the proliferation of
  infiltrated B cells and T cells. (8) MSC-derived EVs increase T cell differentiation
  to Regulatory T cells. T reg cells inhibit over-activation of immune responses.
  (9) Hypoxia, which is a consequence of severe chronic inflammation, promotes MSCs
  differentiation to type II alveolar cells. (10) MSCs secrete KGF, HGF, pro-SPC,
  TTF-1, and CFTR, which reduce the accumulation of angiotensin II. As a result, they
  decrease the apoptosis of alveolar cells while they increase their proliferation.
  (11) MSCs transfer their mitochondria to the alveolar cells and improve their function.
  (12) MSCs facilitate injured endothelium repair through secretion of HGF, KGF, and
  angiopoietin 1. (13) MSC-derived microvessels decrease pulmonary arterial pressure
  and pulmonary vascular resistance that results in diminished fluid accumulation
  in the alveoli.
