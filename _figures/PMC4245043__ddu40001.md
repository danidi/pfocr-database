caption: Model of the Fanconi functional pathway and protein components. The 16 proteins
  encoded by FANC genes for a DNA damage response network in which DNA damage activates
  signaling kinases in the DNA damage response network to phosphorylate multiple FA
  ‘core complex’ and the D2/I proteins. Activated FANCL is the E3 ligase that monoubiquitylates
  FANCD2/I to recruit and target downstream components including nucleases to DNA
  damage sites and stalled replication forks. FAPs, additional FANC-associated proteins;
  P, phosphate; Ub, monoubiquitin. Note. The PTMs shown are illustrative, not an exhaustive
  list. See (–) for additional detail.
