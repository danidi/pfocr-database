caption: Although the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) epithelium overexpresses
  Hedgehog (Hh), ligand-dependent canonical signalling is activated in stromal cells,
  including cancer-associated fibroblasts, infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells
  and subsets of endothelial cells, through the patched (PTC)–smoothened (SMO) axis.
  In turn, these cells directly proliferate or produce factors that might enhance
  tumour cell growth (potentially through secreted growth factors or by changing extracellular
  matrix (ECM) composition) and angiogenesis in a paracrine fashion (the factors that
  have been identified are indicated). Furthermore, cancer-associated fibroblasts
  and other Hh-responsive cells might produce cytokines and other molecules that communicate
  with infiltrating immune cells. Conversely, autocrine activation through this canonical
  pathway does not seem to occur in the tumour epithelium. Gli activity is maintained
  in part by activation of GLI1 through alternative signalling pathways, such as mutant
  KRAS expression and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling. ANGPT1, angiopoietin
  1; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; MMP9, matrix metalloproteinase 9; VEGFA, vascular
  endothelial growth factor A.
