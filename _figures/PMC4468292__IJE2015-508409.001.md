caption: Influence of the inflammatory cytokines on the status of insulin resistance.
  TNF-α causes insulin resistance by enhancing adipocyte lipolysis stimulating JNK
  and IKKβ/NF-κB pathway which may increase serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS1.
  IL-6 induces IR by reducing the expression of GLUT4 and IRS-1 by activating the
  JAK-STAT signaling pathway and increasing SOCS3 expression, and IL-6 can also lead
  to IR in skeletal muscle by inducing TLR-4 gene expression through activation of
  STAT3; besides, TLR4 is suggested to be major upstream molecules in the activation
  of NF-κB. Besides, IL-6 is also found to induce IR by impairing the synthesis of
  glycogen through downregulating the expression of miR-200s and upregulating that
  of FOG-2.
