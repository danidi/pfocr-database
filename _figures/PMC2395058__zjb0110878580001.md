caption: Predicted pathways of propionate metabolism in M. tuberculosis. Catabolism
  of alternative carbon sources including odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (FA),
  branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and cholesterol generates propionyl-CoA as a
  three-carbon (C3) terminal product. Previous studies have established the importance
  of the glyoxylate and methylcitrate cycles for anaplerosis and propionyl-CoA metabolism,
  respectively, during fatty acid catabolism by M. tuberculosis (, ). Glyoxylate cycle
  enzymes are the isocitrate lyases (ICL1/ICL2) and malate synthase (MLS); ICL1 and
  ICL2 also provide MCL activity in M. tuberculosis (, ). Other enzymes of the methylcitrate
  cycle include MCS and MCD. Methylmalonyl pathway enzymes are PCC, MMCE, and MCM.
  Pyruvate is produced from malate by malic enzyme (MEZ) or from oxaloacetate by the
  sequential action of pyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) and pyruvate kinase (PYK); the
  coupled decarboxylation of pyruvate by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC)
  yields acetyl-CoA. Anaplerosis during carbohydrate catabolism is by carboxylation
  of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (PCA). ACN, aconitase; CIT,
  citrate synthase; FUM, fumarase; ICD, isocitrate dehydrogenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase;
  MQO, malate:quinine oxidoreductase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; SCS, succinate synthase;
  SDH, succinate dehydrogenase.
