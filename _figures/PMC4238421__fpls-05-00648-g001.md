caption: 'A model of the ethylene receptor signaling via the C- and N-termini of ethylene
  receptor. (A) Ethylene receptor C-terminal signaling, here represented by ETHYLENE
  RESPONSE1 (ETR1), is mediated via the histidine kinase domain to CTR1 to phosphorylate
  EIN2 residues S645 and S924, and EIN2 is retained at the endoplasmic reticulum for
  degradation mediated by the F-box proteins EIN2 TARGETING PROTEIN1 (ETP1) and ETP2.
  Ethylene signaling mediated by EIN2 to the nuclear EIN3/EIL1 is inhibited, and EIN3
  and EIL1 undergo degradation mediated by the F-box proteins EIN3 BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN1
  (EBF1) and EBF2. (B) “Default” ethylene signaling by EIN2. Without the receptors
  (in the receptor quintuple mutant), EIN2-mediated ethylene signaling fully occurs
  and the mutants produce an extremely strong constitutive ethylene response phenotype.
  With the receptors, a portion of EIN2 could be underphosphorylated, presumably because
  of interconversion between the phosphorylated and underphosphorylated state or incomplete
  phosphorylation by CTR1, and cleaved to potentially activate ethylene signaling.
  (C,D) Ethylene signaling suppression by the receptor N-terminus: (C) With the receptors,
  the “default” ethylene signaling mediated by EIN2 can be repressed in part by the
  receptor N-terminal signaling (red line), regardless of CTR1 docking. (D) Ethylene
  binding or docking of a kinase-inactive ctr1 at the receptors inhibits the receptor
  C-terminal signaling, and the cleaved EIN2 C-terminus is translocated to the nucleus
  to induce EIN3/EIL1-directed expression of ethylene response genes. The N-terminal
  signaling is also inhibited (red dotted line), and the inhibition of EIN2-mediated
  signaling is largely alleviated. Components involved in the receptor N-terminal
  signaling remain to be identified. AHP1 and EIN2 are proposed to be involved in
  the CTR1-independent pathway because of their interaction with ETR1, and AHP1 also
  mediates cytokinin signaling.'
