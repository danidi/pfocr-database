caption: A. In the absence of Hh ligand, Ptch1 in the primary cilium represses Smo
  function, resulting in the proteolytic processing of Gli-activator (Gli1-A) (bound
  to SuFu, a negative regulator of Hh signaling) to Gli-repressor (Gli-R). The latter
  then binds to the promoters of Hh target genes to repress transcription. B. In the
  presence of Hh, Ptch1 translocates out of the cilium and is degraded, allowing Smo
  to enter the cilium and activate the Hh pathway by preventing cleavage of Gli proteins
  to its repressor form. Gli-A enters the nucleus and activates Hh-target gene (e.g.,
  Gli1, Ptch1, Bcl2, FoxM1) transcription.
