caption: Interaction between the insulin/Igf-like (IIS) signaling pathway with immune
  function and pathogen resistance in Drosophila. Insulin Receptor (InR) is initially
  activated upon binding of insulin-like peptides. The activated receptor either phosphorylates
  directly the enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or acts indirectly through
  the insulin receptor substrate proteins Chico and Lnk. PI3K is a lipid kinase consisting
  of the regulatory subunit dP60 and the catalytic subunit dP110. PI3K is then recruited
  to the membrane where it phosphorylates the 3′ position of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) and thereby generates phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3).
  Elevated levels of PIP3 recruit the PH-domain-containing protein kinase B (PKB/AKT)
  to the plasma membrane, facilitating its activation by phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1). PKB signals downstream by inhibiting the FOXO (forkhead box, subgroup
  “O”) family of transcription factors (dFOXO in Drosophila). Inhibition of the IIS
  pathway allows dFOXO to negatively regulate the expression of pro-aging genes and
  positively regulate the expression of anti-aging genes. PTEN is a negative regulator
  of the IIS pathway. It is not currently clear whether overexpression of Silent information
  regulator 2 (Sir2 or Sirtuin) increases longevity in Drosophila. Chico mutant flies
  have improved survival after bacterial infection that is not due to AMP up-regulation.
  Transcription factor dFOXO regulates antimicrobial peptide (AMP) transcription but
  its activation does not protect flies against pathogenic infection.
