caption: Proposed mechanistic hypothesis based on the published data and the results
  of our studies in patients with ADPKD (,,). A vicious cycle is created in which
  renal cysts activate the RAAS, and the resulting increase in AngII leads to (1)
  increased levels of eNOS inhibitor ADMA, which further depletes NO; (2) increased
  HCy and SAH levels within the methylation pathway and diminished methylation capacity
  (SAM/SAH); and (3) increased metabolism of AA, leading to generation of proinflammatory
  and oxidative stress–accelerating PGs as well as HETE and HODE. Oxidative stress,
  vascular inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in turn augment the cyst expansion
  and activate the RAAS. 8-isoP, 8-isoprostane; ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine;
  ADPKD, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; AngII, angiotensin II; eNOS,
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase; HCy, homocysteine; HETE, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid; HODE, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid; LOX, lipoxygenase; NO, nitric oxide; RAAS,
  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine; SAM, S-adenosyl
  methionine; SDMA, symmetric dimethylarginine.
