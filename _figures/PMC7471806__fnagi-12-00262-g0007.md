caption: Schematic model of the possible mechanisms of BDNF/TrkB/HIF-1α involvement
  in maintaining brain glucose metabolism in P301S mice. Chronic LA treatment induces
  increased BDNF expression level in neurons and astrocytes in P301S mice brain, then
  BDNF binding to TrkB-FL induces the activation of TrkB-FL (autophosphorylation of
  tyrosine sites), BDNF and p-TrkB-FL complex translocate from the cellular membrane
  through forming endosomes. The complex upregulates HIF-1α protein level and contributes
  to HIF-1α nucleus translocation, inducing the downstream target genes expression,
  such as GLUT3, GLUT4, and HO-1, VEGF. The increased glucose transporters and vascular
  endothelium reinstate glucose metabolism in P301S mice. Also, LA administration
  upregulates PGC-1α expression and promotes the stabilization of HIF-1α protein level,
  couple with HIF-1α to induce the downstream target genes.
