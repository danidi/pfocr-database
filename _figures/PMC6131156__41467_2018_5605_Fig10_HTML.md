caption: Summary and working hypothesis. a Schematic showing tension on actin filaments
  and their twisting, which have been reported by previous studies using in vitro
  reconstituted actin filaments, –. Actin filaments (red) alter their helical pitch
  in response to applied forces (blue arrows). cofilin (magenta) preferentially binds
  to twisted, mechanically relaxed actin filaments. b Summary of the working hypothesis.
  See the main text for details. Upper and bottom dashed arrows indicate an unidentified
  pathway regulating directional cell rearrangement downstream to AIP1/cofilin or
  actin turnover, which may potentially function via E-cad transport

papertitle: AIP1 and cofilin ensure a resistance to tissue tension and promote directional
  cell rearrangement.
