caption: Outline of nitrogen (N) regulatory pathways altering plant architecture under
  conditions of nitrate (NO3–) and ammonium (NH4+) supply. NO3– influences shoot branching,
  flowering time, and panicle size. NO3– suppresses the expression of ferredoxin–NADP
  oxidoreductase 1 (FNR1), which modulates cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) phosphorylation and
  delays flowering (). The transcription factors SCHLAFMUTZE (SMZ) and SCHNARCHZAPFEN
  (SNZ) can be activated by NO3– via the gibberellic acid (GA) pathway to suppress
  flowering (). The flowering time can directly or indirectly alter branching and
  panicle structure. In addition, N supply rapidly stimulates cytokine (CK) biosynthesis
  and acropetal transportation (; ). Branching is regulated by the varied distribution
  of auxin, which is regulated by the expression of members of the PIN-FORMED family
  of auxin efflux transporters (PINs) via CKs and NO3– (). The biosynthesis of strigolactones
  (SLs) is suppressed by a sufficient N supply, resulting in the outgrowth of branching
  (, ; ). Moreover, the expression of indica-type nitrate reductase 2 (NR2; indicated
  with an asterisk) and the nitrate transporter 1.1B (NRT1.1B) can be induced by NO3–
  and enhances the absorption of NO3– and the regulation of branching (; ). Expression
  of the nitrate transporter 2.1 (NRT2.1) gene and putative nitrate–peptide transporter
  family genes (NPFs) can enhance panicle size and branching (; , ). Amino acids (AAs)
  influence shoot branching. The putative amino acid permease AAP3 can suppress branching,
