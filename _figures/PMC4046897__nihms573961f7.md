caption: A metabolic model of survival in P. aeruginosa. The ATP synthesized from
  glycolysis (1), pyruvate fermentation (2), and the arginine deiminase pathway (3)
  is used for essential processes including transcription, translation, and proteolysis
  (4). The F1FO-ATPase complex hydrolyses ATP to translocate protons across the inner
  membrane (5), thereby generating a proton-motive force. Excess reducing equivalents
  from pyruvate oxidation can be dispensed by converting pyruvate to lactate (6).
  Phenazines can also regenerate oxidants for metabolism (7); although NAD(P)H is
  a possible electron donor for phenazines in vivo (), the dashed lines indicate that
  the nature of this interaction has not been elucidated. Phenazines are then oxidized
  extracellularly (8) and can be reused. Nitrate reductase can reduce nitrate to nitrite
  using electrons from the quinone pool (9), permitting oxidation of NADH via NADH
  dehydrogenase (10), which can result in proton translocation depending on which
  dehydrogenase complex is used.
