caption: A model illustrating the mode of action of RLTPR in T cells. RLTPR is required
  for coupling CD28 to PKC-θ and CARMA-1, two proximal effectors of the CD28 signaling
  pathway. RLTPR exists as constitutive dimer and contains a putative HD. The CPI
  motif of RLTPR molecules is constitutively associated with a CP, conferring actin-uncapping
  properties to RLTPR molecules. As a result, RLTPR molecules are thought to remodel
  the cortical actin cytoskeleton upon T cell activation. Our data demonstrated, however,
  that the RLTPR CPI motif is dispensable for co-stimulation via CD28 and the development
  of T reg and effector memory CD4+ T cells. In contrast, the LRR domain, the noncanonical
  PH domain, and the PRR of RLTPR are each mandatory for co-stimulation via CD28.
  By disrupting the structure of the LRR domain, the L432 mutation found in Rltprbas
  mice prevents the association of RLTPR with CARMA1, thereby abrogating CD28-mediated
  co-stimulatory signals. Whether the PRR region of RLTPR is coupled to the PYAP motif
  found in the CD28 cytoplasmic tail via the GRB2 or GRAP2 adaptors remains to be
  demonstrated. CD28 likely exerts both RLTPR-dependent and -independent functions.
