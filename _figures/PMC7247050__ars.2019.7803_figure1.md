caption: Cellular redox network. Cellular redox homeostasis is maintained by a delicate
  balance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant systems. Cellular pro-oxidants primarily
  include O2•− and H2O2, which are generated by enzymes or/and mitochondrial respiration.
  SODs convert O2•− to H2O2, which is further neutralized to water by catalase, GPxs,
  and Prxs. Catalase has very low affinity for H2O2 (but with a high turnover and
  high catalytic efficiency) and can reduce H2O2 to water when its levels reach the
  millimolar range. GPxs require two molecules of reduced GSH for H2O2 reduction and
  GSH is oxidized to GSSG in this reaction. GSH can also be used by glutaredoxins
  [Grx-(SH)2] to reduce protein intra/inter-disulfide (PS2 or PSSG) into reduced protein
  cysteinyl residues (P[SH]2 or PSH + GSH). The recycling of GSSG to GSH is catalyzed
  by GR, which utilizes NADPH as an electron donor. Prxs extract electrons from reduced
  thioredoxins [Trx-(SH)2] to reduce H2O2 or organic hydroperoxides (ROOH) to H2O
  or/and alcohols (ROH), respectively; and Trx-(SH)2 is simultaneously oxidized into
  Trx-S2. Like GSH, Trx-(SH)2 can also reduce protein disulfides into protein cysteinyls.
  The recycling of Trx-S2 is catalyzed by TRs using NADPH as an electron donor. NADPH
  is generated by G6PD in the PPP of glucose metabolism. Therefore, the cellular redox
  state and cell metabolism are closely linked through NADPH. Adapted from references
