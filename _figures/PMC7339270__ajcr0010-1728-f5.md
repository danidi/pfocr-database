caption: Schematic model of how IGFBP3 regulates THBS1 in epithelial ovarian cancer
  cells. IGFBP3 is synthesized and secreted to inhibit cell proliferation, migration,
  and invasion. IGFBP3 is translocated intracellularly into the nucleus or transported
  from the extracellular region into the nucleus after synthesis. IGFBP3 activates
  the THBS1 promoter to secrete THBS1. The secreted THBS1 inhibits angiogenesis. In
  summary, IGFBP3 regulates THBS1 through THBS1 promoter activation in intracellular
  and extracellular pathways. The intracellular regulation pathway is the major pathway.
