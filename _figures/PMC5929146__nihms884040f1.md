caption: In addition to the classical pathway involving glycolytic and oxidative metabolism
  of glucose to increase ATP:ADP ratio and inhibit KATP channels, our recent metabolomics
  studies identify two pathways that play complementary roles. First, anaplerotic
  metabolism of glucose via pyruvate carboxylase (PC) rather than pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) creates excess TCA cycle intermediates that leave mitochondria in the form
  of citrate and isocitrate via the citrate/isocitrate carrier (CIC). Isocitrate engages
  with the cytosolic, NADP-dependent isoform of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) to
  form NADPH and reduce glutathione, leading to reduction and activation of the deSUMOylase
  enzyme SENP1. In addition, metabolism of glucose via the pentose shunt enzymes glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) contributes to
  nucleotide synthesis, particularly the conversion of IMP to S-AMP via adenylosuccinate
  synthase (ADSS). S-AMP also stimulates insulin secretion in a SENP1-dependent manner.
