caption: Integrated mechanism of the intracellular and extracellular consequences
  of HIV infection that control cholesterol homeostasis in human macrophages. HIV
  penetrates into macrophages through a direct interaction with CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors.
  It has been formerly demonstrated that HIV-specific protein Nef binds to ABCA1 and
  inhibits its efflux functions in human macrophages (). Thus, by reducing cholesterol
  efflux through ABCA1 toward circulating lipid-poor/lipid-free apoAI and to small
  HDL3 subspecies, HIV infection potentially alters plasma cholesterol efflux capacity
  from human macrophages. In parallel, following HIV infection, major structural and
  functional modifications in plasma lipoproteins occur resulting in a reduction of
  the capacity of HDL particles to stimulate cholesterol efflux through the ABCA1
  pathway. Taken together those effects of HIV infection on human macrophage homeostasis
  might significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and favor the progression
  of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients. Increasing the capacity of plasma to
  stimulate cholesterol efflux via ABCA1, the major macrophage cholesterol transporter,
  is an interesting approach to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population. HAART
  restores HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages either directly by acting
  on its metabolism or indirectly by suppressing viral charge and thus eliminating
  HIV adverse effects on HDL functionality.
