caption: 'Figure 1. CRMP2 activity in T lymphocytes: alteration by viral infection.
  CRMP2 belongs to a molecular pathway downstream of chemokine receptors, notably
  PI3K/GSK3/CRMP2 signaling. Left: Treatment by the chemokine CXCL12/SDF1 activates
  lymphocyte migration by switching the CRMP2 phosphorylation status: inhibition of
  CRMP2(p509/514), phosphorylated by GSK3β vs. induction of Tyr479 phosphorylation
  by Yes kinase. HTLV-1 infection results in CRMP2 hyperphosphorylation. Right: Proteolytic
  processing controls CRMP2 activity: the short cleaved form (58 kDa) antagonizes
  the full-length form (62 kDa), acting as a physiologically dominant-negative signal.
  HTLV-1 infection causes enrichment of the active (full-length) CRMP2 form in T lymphocytes
  and inhibits activity of the cleaved form. Infection also activates the PI3K/Akt/CRMP2
  signaling pathway, intensifying the migratory potential of infected T lymphocytes.'
