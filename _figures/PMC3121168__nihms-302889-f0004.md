caption: a | Modulation of protein complex structure and localization in Drosophila
  by Hh. In the absence of ligand, Ptch prevents translocation of Smo to the plasma
  membrane. A microtubule-associated complex including Cos2, Fu, Sufu and Ci recruits
  kinases including PKA, CK1, GSK3β that promote the processing of Ci into its repressor
  form (CiR)–. Sufu may also associate with full length Ci to prevent its translocation
  to the nucleus. Upon activation of the pathway, Smo moves to the plasma membrane,
  and the Fu-Cos2 complex associates with the C-terminal tail of Smo resulting in
  the release of Ci. Pathway activation also inactivates the negative regulator–.
  b | In vertebrate Hh signaling, signal transduction takes place within cilia, but
  the behavior of protein complexes may parallel that in Drosophila. In the absence
  of ligand, Ptch localizes to the cilium, and is thought to block the entry of Smo
  into cilia. Kif7 (the Cos2 homologue) localizes to the base of the cilium where
  it may form a complex Gli proteins and other pathway components. Kif7 at the cilium
  base prevents Gli enrichment within the cilium and promotes processing of GliR.
  Upon activation of the pathway, Smo moves to the ciliary membrane and Kif7 translocates
  into the cilium thereby promoting Gli2 accumulation at the cilium tip, . Kif7 at
  the cilia tip may also block the function of Sufu. Activated Gli is transported
  out of the cilium by Dynein and IFT particles.
