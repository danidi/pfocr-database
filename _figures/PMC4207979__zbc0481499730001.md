caption: One-carbon metabolism is required for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate
  (dTMP), and methionine. Mitochondrial-derived formate is a major source of 1C units
  and can enter the cytoplasm to function as a one-carbon unit for folate metabolism.
  The synthesis of dTMP occurs in the nucleus and mitochondria. At S phase, the enzymes
  of the thymidylate (dTMP) synthesis pathway undergo SUMO-dependent translocation
  to the nucleus. The remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by MTR requires
  vitamin B12. The one carbon is labeled in bold. The inset shows the thymidylate
  synthesis cycle, which involves the enzymes, SHMT1, SHMT2a, TYMS, and dihydrofolate
  reductase (DHFR). DHF, dihydrofolate; MTR, methionine synthase; GNMT, glycine N-methyltransferase;
  MTHFR, 5-methenylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.
