caption: Mechanisms of dysbiosis-mediated intestinal dysfunction in IBS. In dysbiosis
  related to IBS, both the quality and quantity of microbial metabolites (BA, SCFAs,
  Vit D, B6, Trp-related), neurotransmitters (His, Glu, GABA, NA, DA, ACh), compounds
  (TLR ligands), neuroendocrine factors (GLP-1, PYY), and protases are significantly
  altered as compared with those in a healthy condition. In addition, activated 5-HT
  with weakened Ind and Kyn signaling can be observed in the Trp pathway. These alternations
  potentially increase mucosal permeability, while microbial products (TLR ligands,
  etc.) or antigens can easily penetrate into sub-mucosal areas and stimulate immune
  cells, thus inducing low-grade inflammation. Prolonged mucosal inflammation and
  some microbial products directly or indirectly influence ENS and CNS functions through
  CRH/HPA, GI motility alteration, and hypersensitivity as part of the pathogenesis
  of IBS. BA, bile acids; SCFA, short-chain fatty acids; Vit, vitamin; Trp, tryptophan;
  QS, quorum sensing; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; Ind, indole; Kyn, kynurenine; His,
  histamine; Glu, glutamine; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; NA, noradrenaline; DA, dopamine;
  Ach, acetylcholine; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; PYY, Peptide YY; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor; PARs, protease activated receptors; TJ, tight junction; TLRs, toll-like
  receptors; EC cells, enterochromaffin cells; CRH/HPA, corticotropin-releasing hormone/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  axis; ENS; enteric nervous system; CNS; central nervous system.
