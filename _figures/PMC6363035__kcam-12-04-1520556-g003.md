caption: (a) Schematic Representation of DDR1-collagen signaling pathway in cancer.
  Collagen DDR1 interaction induces canonical and non-canonical signaling pathway
  which is summarize in the figure. Canonically interaction between collagen and DDR1
  induces tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR1 and induces DDR1 kinase activation. DDR1
  kinase activation induces Src, Notch and IKK signaling pathway. DDR1 also regulates
  Pyk2 mediate RAP1 activation that leads to epithelial to mesenchymal transition
  (EMT). Collagen also induces DDR1 and TM4SF1 interaction which is a kinase independent
  (Non-canonical; inside box) function of DDR1. DDR1-TM4SF1 interaction regulates
  survival and reactivation of breast cancer cells in metastatic site [].(b) Schematic
  Representation of DDR1-collagen signaling on induction/activation of MMP that regulates
  degradation of matrix and invasiveness of cancer cells.
