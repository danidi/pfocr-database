caption: Schematic representation of diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease progression.
  DR initiates with hyperglycemia, which induces microangiopathy. This leads to vascular
  permeability, followed by diabetic macular edema and capillary occlusion. Capillary
  occlusion leads to retinal ischemia, followed by elevated levels of VEGF, ultimately
  resulting in neovascularization. Boxes represent the point in the pathway targeted
  by animal models. Italicized text corresponds to the induced models and bold text
  corresponds to the genetic models
