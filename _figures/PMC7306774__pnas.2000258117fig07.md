caption: Proposed mechanism for CRY’s effect on susceptibility to stress-induced depression-like
  behavior. Our data suggest that stressful ITS training can induce circadian clock
  dysfunction in the NAc, perhaps a phase shift. This clock dysfunction leads to a
  change in the 24-h timing of Cry expression such that CRY protein levels are higher
  in the early night, at the beginning of the active phase. Normal DA reward circuit
  function and mood regulation depend crucially on MSN activity in the NAc, regulated
  by synaptic input from dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. During the nocturnal active
  period of mice, higher levels of CRY may act on G proteins [potentially through
  inhibition of the adenylate cyclase pathway ()] in D1R-MSNs of the NAc to block
  daily activation of D1 receptors, thereby compromising DA reward signaling and leading
  to depression-like behavior. Individual differences in depression-like behavior
  may be due, at least in part, to individual differences in prior history of stressful
  experience during development. Image created with BioRender.com. Adenylate cyclase,
  AC; cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP.
