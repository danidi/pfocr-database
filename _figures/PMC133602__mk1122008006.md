caption: Model of the yeast glyoxylate bypass pathway and its possible connection
  with other predicted changes. Red part indicates the activated glyoxylate bypass.
  Green part indicates repressed part of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
  Notice that the limiting enzymes of glyoxylate bypass and oxaloacetate turn over
  are Cit3 and Icl2 (activated in phase 5) and Idh1/Idh2 (repressed in phase 5). The
  expression of ACO1 gene is twofold repressed in phase 5, but this enzyme seems to
  be very highly expressed in the cells (our own measurements), and this repression
  may not be detrimental to the glyoxylate bypass efficiency. The gene expression
  pattern suggests a switch from TCA degradative cycle to glyoxylate bypass at phase
  5 of the acid/alkali transition.
