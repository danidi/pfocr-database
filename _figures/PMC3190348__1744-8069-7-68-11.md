caption: Schematic models of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of CGRP during
  the development of tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia. A chronic morphine treatment
  induces the activation of the neuronal CaMKII-nNOS pathway in the SCDH, resulting
  in an increased NO release. NO can then retrogradly diffuse to the presynaptic nerve
  terminals to modulate CGRP gene expression either via direct activation of the sGC-cGMP
  pathway [,] or via the S-nitrosylation [] of related nuclear proteins. The effects
  of glial ERK and p38 on CGRP expression in the SCDH may occur through the regulation
  of neuronal CaMKII-nNOS signaling. B) In the DRG, chronic morphine enhances the
  activation of CaMKII, which can then stimulate CGRP gene expression via the modulation
  of various transcriptional factors.
