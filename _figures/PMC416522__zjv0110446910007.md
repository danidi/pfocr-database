caption: 'Recapitulative scheme of the pathways analyzed in this study. A series of
  inhibitors () and two activators (arrows for GSH-ME and TNF-α recombinant protein)
  are represented in regard to the cellular enzyme that is specifically targeted.
  A plus sign means that the inhibitor or the activator affects the apoptotic ratios
  of ovine B lymphocytes from both infected and control sheep. Conversely, a minus
  sign means that the inhibitor or activator does not specifically alter cell death
  over a broad range of concentrations. A plus/minus means that the inhibitor is able
  to inhibit apoptosis in some samples. The apoptotic process of ovine B lymphocytes
  involves a caspase 8-dependent pathway (inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK) and the caspase
  3 effector (Z-DEVD-FMK). The caspase 9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK) was effective in a
  minority of cases, and concanamycin did not interfere with apoptosis, indicating
  the absence of a cytotoxic response under the experimental conditions used. The
  following series of compounds interfering with the TNF-α/NF-κB/NOS/COX2 pathway
  was used: TNF-α Ab (neutralizing antibody or recombinant protein), BAY11-7082, capsaicin,
  NAC, SN50 (NFκB inhibitory peptide), LNMMA (inhibiting NOS), and NS398 (an inhibitor
  of COX2). None of these compounds selectively impedes indirect protection against
  apoptosis conferred by a medium conditioned by BLV-infected cells. Reduced glutathione
  plays a key role in this process because (i) membrane-permeable GSH-ME restricts
  apoptosis and (ii) APDC and ethacrynic acid (EA) known to decrease GSH levels eliminate
  indirect protection against apoptosis. The activities of two enzymes implicated
  in GSH regulation (GSH reductase and GSH peroxidase) are unaltered during this process.
  Two other enzymes linked to the NF-κB and GSH pathways, i.e., thioredoxin peroxidase
  and GST, respectively, are indicated. GST catalyzes the conjugation of the thiol
  group of reduced glutathione to xenobiotics (X), yielding GS-X.'
