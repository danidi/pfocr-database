caption: Schematic diagram of proposed model to explain the molecular mechanism of
  Bmal1 deficiency influenced the HIF1α-VEGF axis in the chondrocytes. The BMAL1/CLOCK
  complex could not only trigger the circadian rhythms by binding to DNA elements
  E-box in the promoters of target genes, for example, Cry1 and Per1 but also regulate
  the HIF1α activity in chondrocytes. Then, the affected HIF1α by ablation of BMAL1
  in chondrocytes inhibited the downstream factor, for example, VEGF and finally induced
  a disordered endochondral ossification afterbirth.
