caption: The BRD4 pathway in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. In AML cells, BRD4
  is recruited to lineage-specific enhancers and promoters by acetylated histones
  and transcription factors (TFs), which are acetylated by p300. BRD4 will then recruit
  several proteins to regions through direct physical interaction, including NSD3/CHD8,
  the Mediator complex, and p-TEFb, which promotes transcriptional activation. BET
  bromodomain inhibitors will release BRD4 from chromatin along with its cofactors
  to suppress transcription. Because many BRD4-occupied enhancers are located at distal
  upstream or downstream sites, several of these activities are occurring at a distance
  from the target gene promoter.
