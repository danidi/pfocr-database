caption: 'Proposed model of selected miRNA action on the regulatory T cell pathway.
  Integral components of the Treg activation pathway are highlighted alongside putative
  direct targets or key players indirectly impacted by miRNA-210 (indicated by *),
  -31 (indicated by +), and -155 (indicated by $). Legend: CD28, Cluster of differentiation
  28; CD25, IL-2 receptor alpha (in complex with IL-2Rβ and γc); CTLA4, Cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte associated protein 4; Foxp3, Forkhead box P3; P, Phosphate group; Runx3,
  Runt related transcription factor 3; Smad5, Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog
  5; Stat5, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, TCR, T cell receptor;
  TDI-hp, Toluene diisocyanate haptenated complex; TGF-β1, Transforming growth factor
  beta 1.'
