caption: 'Multi-loop model of AD: an integrated perspective on the Wnt/GSK3β, α-synuclein,
  and type 3 diabetes hypotheses. (1) GSK3β, also known as Tau Kinase 1, phosphorylates
  tau (De Ferrari et al., ). (2) In turn, p-tau may increase GSK3β activity by inducing
  oxidative stress (Cente et al., ; Feng et al., ; Liu et al., ). (3) α-synuclein
  can also contribute to tau pathology by binding to tau’s microtubule binding domain
  (Jensen et al., ), recruiting GSK3β to tau, and helping to promote pathological
  p-tau aggregation (Gąssowska et al.’s ; Moussaud et al., ). (4) In reciprocation,
  tau can promote α-synuclein’s phosphorylation by GSK3β and α-synuclein aggregation
  (Giasson et al., ; Credle et al., ). (5) In addition to facilitating tauopathy,
  α-synuclein can promote Aβ production by increasing GSK3β activity (Duka et al.,
  ) and β-secretase levels (Roberts et al., ). (6) In turn, Aβ can increase α-synuclein
  levels (Majd et al., ), possibly by stimulating GSK3β (Yuan et al., ). (7) Aβ can
  simulate GSK3β activity by inducing the expression of DKK1 and by binding to and
  inhibiting Frizzled (Caricasole et al., ; Magdesian et al., ). p-AICD, a by-product
  of Aβ production, can increase GSK3β gene expression (Chang et al., ). (8) GSK3β
  phosphorylates APP to enable p-AICD production and to make APP a better substrate
  for β-secretase (Lee et al., ; Acevedo et al., ). GSK3β overactivity and Wnt-signaling
  underactivity also increase β-secretase levels, further promoting the generation
  of Aβ (Ly et al., ; Parr et al., ). (9) GSK3β can contribute to insulin resistance
  by phosphorylating and inhibiting IRS1 (Lee and Kim, ). (10) In turn, insulin-AKT
  pathway dysfunction can contribute to an increase in GSK3β activity (Magrané et
  al., ; Lee et al., ). (11) Because insulin and Aβ are both IDE substrates, hyperinsulinemia
  prevents Aβ degradation (Qiu et al., ; Pérez et al., ; Farris et al., ; Neth and
  Craft, ; Folch et al., ). (12) Aβ can then further exacerbate insulin resistance
  by preventing insulin degradation and by binding to IRs (Pérez et al., ; Zhao et
  al., ; O’Neill, ). The above figure shows only mechanisms whereby these models feedback
  on one another and not those additional mechanisms whereby they cooperate to intensify
  AD pathology, such as may be the case for glucose transporter expression and synaptic
  activity (Chiu et al., ; Daneman et al., ; Ferreira et al., ; Purro et al., ; Marzo
  et al., ).'
