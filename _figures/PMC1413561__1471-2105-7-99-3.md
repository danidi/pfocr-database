caption: Yeast MAPK signaling for mating and filamentation. The strongly linked MAPK
  signaling pathways for mating and filamentation are shown schematically with black
  arrows indicating mating pathway signaling and gray arrows showing filamentation
  pathway signaling. The mating pathway is initiated by binding to Ste2p or Ste3p
  receptors, while the causative molecular trigger for filamentation is unclear. The
  pathways share many components.
