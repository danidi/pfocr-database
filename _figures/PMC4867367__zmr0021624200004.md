caption: GR cross talk with the TLR signaling pathway. GR interferes with the three
  main mediators of TLR signaling, MAPKs, NF-κB, and IRF3. GR decreases the activity
  of NF-κB and AP-1 by interacting with p38 (1) and JNK (2), respectively. Additionally,
  in the nucleus, GR interacts with AP-1 via tethering, thereby suppressing the transcription
  of its target genes (3). GR positively regulates the expression of IκBα (4), which
  keeps NF-κB in its inactive form in the cytoplasm. The mechanisms employed by GR
  to suppress NF-κB via PPIs include the interaction of GR with PKAc (5), reducing
  its availability to phosphorylate NF-κB, which is crucial for its activity; direct
  interaction of GR with NF-κB in the cytoplasm, leading to sequestration (6); or
  interaction in the nucleus via sequestration or tethering (7), which is assisted
  by the deacetylation of GR by HDAC2. Interaction of GR with the p65 subunit of NF-κB
  or with GRIP1 reduces their availability for an interaction with IRF3. Consequently,
  the transcription of inflammatory genes that depends on the cooperative binding
  of both NF-κB and IRF3 or of GRIP1 and IRF3 in their promoters is decreased (8).
