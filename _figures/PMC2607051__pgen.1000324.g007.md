caption: Replication stress developing as a result of DSB formation or processing
  triggers the ATR/Chk1 protein kinase cascade that suppresses an ATM- and ATR-dependent
  cleavage of caspase 2 and cell death (left, from ). Replication stress triggered
  by DNA replication inhibitors also triggers the ATR/Chk1 protein kinase cascade
  that suppresses an apoptotic pathway (right). In Chk1 depleted cells treated with
  replication inhibitors RPA foci accumulate, caspase 3 is activated, and apoptosis
  follows. Once this apoptotic response is triggered in the absence of Chk1 or ATR,
  it does not require ATM or ATR function, unlike the response to IR. The formation
  of RPA foci and apoptosis are dependent upon Cdc45 function and are modulated by
  p21 ,.
