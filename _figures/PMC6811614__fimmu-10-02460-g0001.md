caption: GCs affect cross-talk of bone cells and their communication with muscle,
  vasculature and myeloid cell-derived osteoclasts. GCs act directly and indirectly
  on bone, hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells and tissues that affect bone integrity.
  Endogenous GCs (green) rather favour differentiation of osteoblasts, whereas exogenous
  (red) rather decrease proliferation, differentiation and enhance apoptosis and autophagy
  of osteoblasts and osteocytes by differential regulation of signalling molecules
  of the Wnt and BMP pathway and pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules. Direct effects
  on osteoclasts are differential concerning longevity, apoptosis, osteoclastogenesis
  (for details see text) and indirect by altering RANKL/OPG ratio. GCs regulate cross-talk
  of vasculature toward bone and muscle toward bone by exerting modulatory effects
  on both systems (muscle atrophy) and likely impairing H-type vessels, since respective
  signalling molecules (VEGF and PDGF-BB are regulated by GCs).
