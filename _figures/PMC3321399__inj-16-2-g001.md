caption: A schematic model for NLR-related protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation.
  The activation of NLRP3 leading to the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18
  is triggered by a number of stimuli. Diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMP) and/or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) stimulation potentiates
  two steps that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Signal 1 activation leads to the
  expression of the pro-IL-1β gene and production of the pro-IL-1β protein through
  the toll-like receptor (TLR)-MyD88-NFκB signaling pathway. Signal 2 is a critical
  step in inflammasome activation. These signals or agonists trigger the assembly
  of a large macromolecular complex through the recruitment of the apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) (ASC)
  adaptor protein and pro-caspase-1 to NLRP3. Several mechanisms have been suggested
  for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, including pore formation through P2X7 receptor
  and K+ efflux, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, phagocytic pathway
  activation by particulate or crystalline structures (e.g., monosodium urate crystals,
  aluminium potassium sulfate, or silica nanoparticles), and lysosome rupture, among
  others. The molecular mechanisms by which NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurs are
  not yet fully understood. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.
