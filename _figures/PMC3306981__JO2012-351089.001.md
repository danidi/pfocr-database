caption: Summarized the signaling mechanisms of various matricellular proteins contributing
  to cancer progression. ANGPTL4 binds to both integrins and ECM to promote tumor
  survival, tumor invasion and modulate the availability of ECM. (a) ANGPTL4 interacting
  with integrin activates Rac1 and NADPH oxidase, which generate high level of O2−.
  This will further activating the Src machinery and stimulates its downstream PI3K/PKB
  mediated survival pathway. (b) ANGPTL4 interacting with integrin also activates
  FAK-src-PAK1 signaling and PKC/14-3-3 mediated pathway which modulate cell migration
  via integrin internalization. (c) ANGPTL4 binds specific matrix proteins and delays
  their degradation by proteases. However, this association does not interfere with
  integrin-matrix protein recognition unlike TNC. (d) TNC can compete with fibronectin
  to bind integrin α5β1 coreceptor, syndecan-4, which blocks the activation of promigratory
  FAK/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. (e) TNC can activate Wnt signaling by downregulating
  the soluble inhibitor DKK-1, thus resulted in nuclear localization of β-catenin.
  Nuclear β-catenin interacts with TCF/LEF to promote the expression of genes contributing
  to tumor formation, survival, and metastasis. OPN can interact with several (f)
  integrins and also (g) CD44 family of receptors. These complexes are able to mediate
  tumor cell survival through PI3k/PKB pathway activation and motility for detachment
  or invasion of tumor cell through the activation of AP-1-dependent gene expression
  via the MEK/Erk pathway. (h) Certain domains of TSP1 (such as NoC1) can bind directly
  to integrins to activate signaling proteins such as Erk1/2 and paxillin which modulates
  tumor formation. (i) TSP1 binding to CD36 activates Fyn and p38 MAPK pathway which
  is essential for the suppression of tumor growth. (j) TSP1 can also bind CD47, to
  modulate sGC and cGMP-dependent protein kinase, thus inhibiting the NO signaling
  necessary for angiogenesis. (k) TSP-1 association with CD47 or direct competitive
  binding of TSP1 to VEGF can inhibit VEGFR2 signaling. VEGFR2 activates the PI3K/PKB
  pathway which leads to activation of eNOS/NO signaling. Simultaneously, VEGFR2 can
  also signal through PLCγ, which further increases AMPK-mediated eNOS phosphorylation
  and NO production. eNOS/NO signaling regulate downstream targets that increase endothelial
  cell proliferation, migration, survival, and permeability. (l) TSP1 can activate
  TGFβ/smad pathway to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. (m)
  SPARC binds integrin, inducing ILK/FAK/PKB activation to increase cell migration.
  (n) Cyr61 can promote tumor cell proliferation and survival through the activation
  of integrin mediated signaling pathway either by direct binding with integrin or
  integrin-syndecan4. The downstream intracellular events may be mediated through
  the FAK/PI3K/PKB signaling pathway, resulting in either activation of the NF-κB
  survival pathway or phosphorylation of GSK3β and nuclear translocation of β-catenin
  for cell proliferation. (o) Cyr61 allows protein degradation of E-cadherin leading
  to β-catenin translocation.
