caption: The interplay of the tumor microenvironment on radioresistance and glucose
  metabolism. Under normoxic conditions (insert) HIF1α is targeted for degradation.
  The ODD domain is hydroxylated and ubiquinated by prolyl hydroxylases (purple triangle)
  and pVHL-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases (circle). However, under hypoxic conditions
  HIF1α is stabilized and activated by binding to HIF1β and the resulting dimer binds
  to the HRE inducing the expression of genes leading to angiogenesis, such as VEGF
  and SDF1, invasion, metastasis, and glycolytic transporters and enzymes (GLUT1).
  Furthermore, the cells use of the inefficient ATP producing glycolytic pathway may
  affect hypoxic and normoxic radioresistance. Key intermediaries of the glycolytic
  pathway, glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, and the reducing couples NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+
  and GSH/GSH-disulfide, have been observed to play roles in continuing the cycle
  of maintaining HIF1α. Glucose-6-phosphate can either enter into the pentose phosphate
  pathway leading to the synthesis of erythrose-4-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate
  which are necessary for amino acid synthesis or can feed back into glycolysis and
  create lactate and pyruvate, which lead to HIF1α accumulation continuing the cycle
  of transcription. Alternatively, glucose-6-phosphate can also lead to the transcription
  of HIF1α by entering into the pathway which ultimately leads to the nuclear translocation
  of CREB-binding protein (CBP) which binds with Mlx leading to HIF1α transcription.
  Lactate and pyruvate along with the reducing couples scavenge reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) free radicals which can also lead to radioresistance. It is still unclear
  whether radiosensitizing drugs are necessary for carbon ions; however some experiments
  have shown that targeting specific crucial players of the glycolytic pathway in
  combination with carbon ions leaded to enhanced cell kill. It may warrant targeting
  other important intermediaries (i.e. glucose-6-phosphate) with carbon ions to possibly
  enhance treatments. Black asterisks represent experimentally determined radiosensitization;
  blue asterisks represent hypothesized radiosensitization targets.
