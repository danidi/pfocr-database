caption: Proposed working model for IL-21-induced B cell differentiation and IgA-producing
  plasma cells in porcine Peyer's patches. IL-21 binds to the IL-21R on B cells, promotes
  the proliferation and inhibits the apoptosis. IL-21 increased IgA CSR, through the
  phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT1, and STAT3 leading to the production of IgA+ B cells.
  Additionally, IL-21 promoted the differentiation of plasma cells, characterized
  by increased expression of BLIMP1 and IRF4 and decreased expression of PAX5 and
  BCL6. Thus, IgA was robustly produced by the IgA-secreting B cells in porcine Peyer's
  patches.
