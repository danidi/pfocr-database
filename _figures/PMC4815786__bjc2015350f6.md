caption: Proposed mechanism of action. (A) GOLPH2 is normally resident at the cis-Golgi-network
  and can traffic to distal parts of the cell including sorting endosomes (SE) and
  the Trans-Golgi-Network (TGN). GOLPH2 is efficiently retrieved from distal compartments
  back to the Golgi via an early endosome (EE)-dependant, late endosome (LE)-independent
  pathway. (B) Overexpression of GOLPH2 in Hepatocellular carcinoma saturates the
  retrieval system resulting in secretion. (C) Golgi structure is altered in cancer
  and in response to acid reflux (containing DCA) resulting in GOLPH2 localisation
  at the TGN and cleavage at the PC site resulting in secretion.
