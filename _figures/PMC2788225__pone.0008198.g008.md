caption: 'We have demonstrated that ActRIIA and BMPRII receptor subunits are both
  selectively required for BMP7-evoked chemotaxis in monocytic cells. How do the individual
  receptor subunits contribute to this activity? Do they work together in a common
  complex? A,B: Our data support a model in which BMP7 engages both ActRIIA and BMPRII
  subunits either as part of a heteromeric type II receptor pair (A) or as homodimers,
  possibly forming unique receptor complexes combining pairs of each of the type II
  receptor subunits (B). The identity of the type I receptors that contribute to this
  complex is not known, although recent evidence implicates BMPRIB in BMP-dependent
  axon guidance , . Engagement of ActRIIA and BMPRII subunits by chemotropic BMPs
  activates a signaling pathway leading to PI3K activity and cytoskeletal reorganization
  that is independent of Smad4-mediated nuclear signaling. C: In contrast, BMP6 does
  not stimulate chemotaxis, presumably being unable to recruit or activate the ActRIIA:BMPRII
  complex necessary for chemotropic signaling. In the same cell, however, BMP7 and
  BMP6 share the ability to activate Smad-dependent transcriptional pathways, through
  receptor mechanisms that do not depend selectively on either ActRIIA or BMPRII.'
