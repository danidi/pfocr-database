caption: Schematic demonstrating mechanism whereby refluxed acid and bile salts cause
  NF-κB pathway activation resulting in CDX2 expression in oesophageal squamous cells
  of patients with Barrett's oesophagus. Refluxed acid and bile salts stimulate NADPH
  oxidase to generate H2O2, which activates IKKβ, which in turn activates the IκB-NF-κB-PKAc
  complex through phosphorylation of IκB. This leads to the degradation of IκB, which
  releases the p50/p65 heterodimer. PKAc in the activated IκB-NF-κB-PKAc complex phosphorylates
  p65, inducing further formation of p50/p65 heterodimers, which translocate to the
  nucleus to stimulate transcription of NF-κB p50 target genes (e.g.CDX2) that might
  play a role in columnar metaplasia. By blocking the activity of IKKβ, aspirin can
  stop NF-κB signaling and CDX2 expression. Thus, aspirin might protect against the
  development of Barrett's oesophagus in GORD patients whose squamous epithelium is
  predisposed to heal reflux esophagitis through metaplasia rather than squamous cell
  regeneration.
