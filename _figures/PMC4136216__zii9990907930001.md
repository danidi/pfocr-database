caption: Hypothesized relationship between various immunodeficiencies during acute
  parasite infection in a murine model of toxoplasmosis. (A) Resident cells become
  infected or sense danger products from infection and recruit dendritic cells, inflammatory
  monocytes (Inflam. MOs), and neutrophils (PMNs), allowing IFN-γ production from
  multiple sources and parasite destruction by inflammatory monocytes. (B) Loss of
  inflammatory monocytes (MCP-1 deficiency, CCR2 deficiency) results in sufficient
  IFN-γ production but is not accompanied by the ability to clear parasites effectively,
  resulting in host mortality (, ). (C) Loss of neutrophils alone (CXCR2 deficiency,
  depletion with Ly-6G [1A8]) results in loss of neutrophil-derived IFN-γ. However,
  the dominance of the TLR11/TLR12-mediated recognition pathway allows sufficient
  IFN-γ production for eventual clearance and survival into the chronic stage (, ).
  (D) Loss of both monocytes and neutrophils (depletion with anti-Gr-1) leads to uncontrolled
  parasite replication and, similarly to monocyte depletion, leads to acute mortality
  (). (E) Loss of TLR11/TLR12-mediated recognition results in loss of DC IL-12 and
  a subsequent delay in IFN-γ production by NK and T cells. Neutrophil-derived IFN-γ
  affords limited control of the parasite burden, resulting in most or mixed numbers
  of surviving mice (, ).
