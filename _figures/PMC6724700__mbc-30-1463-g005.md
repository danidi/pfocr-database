caption: NMII knockdown cells show altered gene expression. (A) Down-regulation of
  mRNA of NMHC IIA and IIB in NMIIA and NMIIB siRNA–treated primary tumorigenic cells.
  (B) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and heatmap analysis of the genes differentially
  expressed in cells treated with NS, IIA, or IIB siRNA. Gene expression is color-coded
  as Min (down-regulation) to Max (up-regulation). (C) IPA analysis of gene expression
  data. Connectivity of differentially expressed genes in the important signaling
  pathways in the IIA siRNA group or (D) the IIB siRNA group shown according to gene
  expression levels (≥1.33-fold change for IIA siRNA and ≥1.41-fold change for IIB
  siRNA; P < 0.05). Genes in the top networks (Network-1) were allowed to grow our
  pathway with the direct and indirect relationship from the IPA knowledge base. (E)
  Quantification of Gsc and Serpinb2 expression in NS, IIB, or Nesprin2 siRNA–treated
  cells using RT-PCR analysis, considering the relative intensity in a NS siRNA–treated
  sample as “100” (refer to Supplemental Figure S6 for a representative image). (F)
  Quantitative real-time PCR of CTGF expression in NS, IIA, or IIB siRNA–treated primary
  cells. n = 3; ***, P < 0.001 NS vs. NMIIA or NMIIB siRNA.
