caption: The role of caspase-1 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-induced NCDs. Activation
  of caspase-1 by internal/external stimuli matures pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β)
  and gasdermin-D to induce pyroptosis. This initiates inflammatory response and may
  result in cell injury and/or death, plaque formation and rupture, infiltration to
  several organs, in turn leading to the development and progression of obesity, atherosclerosis,
  cardiac remodeling and cancer formation. The release of ROS/RNS from stressed mitochondria
  may directly oxidize and damage cellular/extracellular proteins, carbohydrates,
  lipids and nucleic acids that lead to metabolic disturbance. Thus, DNA damage leads
  to an alteration of signaling pathways (suppression of tumor suppressor genes and
  promotion of tumor promoter genes) that further results in exacerbation of DNA damage,
  genomic instability and impairment of DNA repair system. These collectively may
  promote carcinogenesis. These metabolic disturbances further result in the production
  of NLRP3 inflammasome stimulatory molecules such as cholesterol crystals, ROS/RNS,
  damaged cells and ATP, which in turn activates caspase-1 in positive a loop pathway
  which aggravates the inflammatory process and infiltration of the inflammatory immune
  cells.

  description: The role of caspase-1 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-induced NCDs.
    Activation of caspase-1 by internal/external stimuli matures pro-inflammatory
    cytokines (IL-1β) and gasdermin-D to induce pyroptosis. This initiates inflammatory
    response and may result in cell injury and/or death, plaque formation and rupture,
    infiltration to several organs, in turn leading to the development and progression
    of obesity, atherosclerosis, cardiac remodeling and cancer formation. The release
    of ROS/RNS from stressed mitochondria may directly oxidize and damage cellular/extracellular
    proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids that lead to metabolic disturbance.
    Thus, DNA damage leads to an alteration of signaling pathways (suppression of
    tumor suppressor genes and promotion of tumor promoter genes) that further results
    in exacerbation of DNA damage, genomic instability and impairment of DNA repair
    system. These collectively may promote carcinogenesis. These metabolic disturbances
    further result in the production of NLRP3 inflammasome stimulatory molecules such
