caption: GA2oxA9 is responsible for semidwarf and overgrowth phenotypes. Increased
  expression of GA2oxA9 stimulates conversion of GA12 and GA53 to inactive GA110 and
  GA97, respectively. This reduces flux in the GA biosynthetic pathway, resulting
  in lower contents of bioactive GA1 and semidwarfism. Mutations in GA2oxA9 cause
  loss of protein function and impair the conversion of GA12 and GA53 to inactive
  GA110 and GA97. This restores flux through the GA biosynthetic pathway, increasing
  GA1 content and restoring plant height.
