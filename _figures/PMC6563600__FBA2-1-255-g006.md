caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathway activated by PAR2 to cause
  smooth muscle contraction in prostate. Stimulation of PAR2 activates PLCβ/IP3 signal
  cascade to release Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in smooth muscle cells
  of the prostate. The released Ca2+ initiates smooth muscle contraction via MLC kinase
  activation and increased phosphorylation of MLC20. Furthermore, Ca2+ released from
  the SR also activates STIM channels on the SR membrane, that activate the Orai CRAC
  channels, causing an influx of extracellular Ca2+ that sustains smooth muscle contraction
  by a mechanism that may involve MLC20 phosphorylation
