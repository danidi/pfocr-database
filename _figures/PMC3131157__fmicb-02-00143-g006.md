caption: Manipulation of plant cell ubiquitin pathway by bacterial pathogens. (A)
  Pseudomonas syringae uses the E3 effector AvrPtoB to suppress plant innate immunity
  responses. AvrPtoB targets the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor-like kinases
  (RLKs) FLS2 and CERK1 for degradation, preventing downstream signaling which activates
  plant programmed cell death (PCD) responses. AvrPtoB also prevents PCD by inhibiting
  the Rbs response; AvrPtoB binds and specifically ubiquitinates Fen kinase, promoting
  its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. (B) Agrobacterium tumefaciens
  translocates VirF, an F-box protein, into host cells to enable genetic transformation
  of the host cell. VirF can bind VIP1, a host protein incorporated into the T-complex
  by bacterial effector VirE2. VirF through binding ASK1 is incorporated into an SCF
  complex. Consequently, VIP1 is ubiquitinated by the SCF complex and it and any bound
  VirE2 are targeted for proteasomal degradation. This is proposed to release T-DNA
  from the DNA–protein complex, allowing it to be integrated into the host chromatin,
  completing transformation.
