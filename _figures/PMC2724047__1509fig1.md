caption: Pathways of bile acid biosynthesis in the liver. The neutral and alternative
  pathways of bile acid biosynthesis are initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1)
  and mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), respectively. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase
  (CYP8B1) determines the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid synthesized.
  In humans, the neutral pathway is the major pathway of synthesis under normal physiological
  conditions. StAR D1, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein D1; 27OH-C, 27-hydroxycholesterol;
  25OH-C, 25-hydroxycholesterol; SULT2B1b, hydroxycholesterol sulfotransferase 2B1b;
  CYP7B1, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase; BAL, bile acid CoA ligase; BAT, bile acid CoA:amino
  acid N-acyltransferase.
