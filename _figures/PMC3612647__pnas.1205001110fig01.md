caption: A lithium-sensitive family of small-molecule phosphatases and the sulfate
  assimilation pathway. (A) The Mus Musculus family of metal-dependent/lithium-sensitive
  phosphomonoesterases and the consensus core motif that defines the family. (B) Schematic
  of the sulfate assimilation pathway intermediates. Bpnt1 and gPAPP hydrolyze the
  3′ phosphate from the sulfation byproduct PAP in the cytoplasm and Golgi lumen,
  respectively. In mice, Papps2 encodes a dual functional enzyme with both ATP sulfurylase
  and APS kinase activities that synthesize PAPS from sulfate and ATP.
