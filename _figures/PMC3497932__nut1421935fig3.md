caption: Schematic representation outlining feedback inhibition of the SREBP pathway
  (A) and transcriptional activity of the SREBP proteins in relation to downregulation
  of the Npc1 gene (B). The SREBP-1 pathway is feedback inhibited at the transcriptional
  level by fatty acids inhibiting LXR and decreasing the amounts of Srebp-1 mRNA.
  Alternative splicing of Srebp-1 mRNA is responsible for the relative amounts of
  Srebp-1a and Srebp-1c mRNA. It has been reported that the relative amounts of Srebp-1a
  mRNA to Srebp-1c mRNA are present at a ratio of 1 to 8.8 in mouse liver and at a
  ratio of 1 to 0.5 in mouse fibroblasts. The SREBP-1 pathway is also feedback inhibited
  at the post-translational level by fatty acids that inhibit UBXD8 and sterols (cholesterol
  and oxysterol) that inhibit SCAP and INSIG, respectively, to decrease the amounts
  of m-SREBP-1a and m-SREBP-1c protein. In contrast, the SREBP-2 pathway is feedback
  inhibited at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels by sterol to
  decrease the amounts of Srebp-2 mRNA and m-SREBP-2 protein. The m-SREBP-1a protein
  has high transcriptional activity for both SRE-like and classic SRE sequences (bold
  lines/arrows), whereas the m-SREBP-1c protein has moderate transcriptional activity
  for the SRE-like sequence (medium line/arrow). Similarly, the m-SREBP-2 protein
  has moderate transcriptional activity for the SRE-like sequence (medium line/arrow)
  and high transcriptional activity for the classic SRE sequence (bold line/arrow).
