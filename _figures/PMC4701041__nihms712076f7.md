caption: Proposed model for a critical role of ERα in E2-induced cholesterol gallstones.
  In the liver, E2 activation of ERα interferes with the negative feedback regulation
  (as shown by the dashed line) of cholesterol synthesis by stimulating Srebp-2, with
  the resulting up-regulation of the SREBP-2-responsive genes for cholesterol synthesis.
  In addition, ERα increases expression of Abcg5/g8 and Ldlr in the liver through
  the transcriptional regulation. As a result, hepatic cholesterol secretion is significantly
  increased, thus leading to supersaturation of bile. In the gallbladder, ERα activated
  by E2 impairs gallbladder emptying function through the Cck-1r pathway, inducing
  bile stasis and accumulation of mucin gel in the gallbladder lumen. All of these
  changes promote cholesterol crystallization and solid cholesterol crystal growth
  and agglomeration into microlithiasis and stones. Of special note is that the deletion
  of the Erα gene reduces susceptibility to E2-induced cholesterol cholelithiasis
  in female mice.
