caption: The carcinogenic mechanisms of six major microorganisms. E. faecalis causes
  colitis after infection and expresses TGF‐β in intestinal epithelial cells, thereby
  activating SMAD4 signaling pathway. E. faecalis also produces extracellular superoxide
  and hydrogen peroxide,inducing DNA damage. Meanwhile, it also appears to be involved
  in the bystander effect of COX‐2, the endogenous CIN and cell transformation caused
  by the release of TNF‐α from macrophages, results in cancer. Some strains of E.
  coli B2 produce CDT and CNF, which can directly lead to a DNA damage response and
  genomic instability. At the same time, the mismatch repair pathway is inhibited,
  leading to tumorigenesis. E. coli can also induce late bridges and chromosomal aberrations
  by genomic toxin‐containing pks islands and catalyze the synthesis of colibactin
  by clbP. Eventually it leads to CIN, MSI and CIMP, which leads to cancer. ETBF synthesizes
  BFT. BFT binds to CECs and stimulates the cleavage of E‐cadherin, thereby amplifying
  the Wnt and NF‐κB pathway and releasing pro‐inflammatory mediators to destroy DNA.
  At the same time, ETBF activates the signal transducer and activator of STAT3 signaling
  pathway, induces the production of Th17, releases interleukin IL‐17, and promotes
  colon tumor formation. BFT rapidly causes the expression of SMO and promotes SMO‐dependent
  ROS production and damages DNA in intestinal epithelial cell lines. These reactions
  cause tumor formation. By complexing with E‐cadherin on epithelial cells, F. nucleatum
  stimulates FadA, which activates wnt/β‐catenin/TLR4/p‐PAK1 signaling and upregulates
  oncogene expression. By releasing RNA into host cells and activating NF‐κB, F. nucleatum
  stimulates inflammation. F. nucleatum also inhibits natural killer (NK) cell activity
  in the tumor microenvironment, leading to colorectal tumorigenesis. Helicobacter
  pylori causes the metastasis of colorectal cancer caused by chronic gastritis. In
  addition, H. pylori infection may cause colorectal epithelial damage through inflammatory
  reactions such as IL‐8 mediated inflammatory responses. H. pylori virulent strains
  induce enhanced inflammatory responses, and expression of the cytotoxin‐associated
  gene A (CagA) gene may also lead to colorectal cancer. The S. bovis antigen induces
  the expression of COX‐2. With the help of prostaglandins, COX‐2 promotes cell proliferation
  and angiogenesis, and inhibits apoptosis, thus stimulating the cancer pathway.
