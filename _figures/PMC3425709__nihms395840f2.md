caption: Trafficking of DSL ligands and the Notch receptor to and from the plasma
  membrane of both signal sending cells and signal-receiving cells control activation
  of the pathway. Genes involved in trafficking the receptor and/or ligand mentioned
  in the text are in blue, cytopslamic membrane compartments such as the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN), early endosome (EE), recycling endosome (RE), multi-vesicular body
  (MVB) and lysosome are represented. See text for details on roles of genes and compartments
  in control Notch receptor and ligand trafficking and signaling. Dashed arrows indicate
  potential site of Notch gamma-secretase cleavage and release of Notch intracellular
  domain.
