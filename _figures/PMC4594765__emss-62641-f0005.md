caption: During cancer or infections, the release of cytokines such as IL-1 at the
  inflammatory site will promote the expression of TNF-α on the endothelium and the
  surrounding tissue. When circulating neutrophils will encounter the activated endothelium,
  TNF-α will unleash NF-κB through the binding to TNFR1, which in turn will induce
  MET expression on neutrophil surface. HGF, also released and proteolytically activated
  at the site of inflammation, will bind to MET and stimulate the firm adhesion of
  neutrophils to the endothelium, likely via integrin engagement, and thus neutrophil
  diapedesis. Once extravasated, HGF/MET pathway will still function on neutrophils
  by reinforcing their cytotoxic response through the induction of iNOS and NO production,
  ultimately favouring a bactericidal and tumouricidal neutrophil phenotype.
