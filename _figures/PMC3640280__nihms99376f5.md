caption: In the physiological context of overnutrition and low IGF-1 levels, as found
  in our obese subjects, circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) rise, leading
  to increased flux of these amino acids through their catabolic pathways. We detected
  changes in several of the intermediary metabolites of the BCAA catabolic pathway
  in obese subjects, as indicated by the symbol *. A consequence of increased BCAA
  levels is the activation of the mTOR/S6K1 kinase pathway and phosphorylation of
  IRS-1 on multiple serines, contributing to insulin resistance. In addition, increased
  BCAA catabolic flux may contribute to increased gluconeogenesis and glucose intolerance
  via glutamate transamination to alanine.
