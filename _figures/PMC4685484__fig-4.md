caption: The interaction between HMGB1 and RAGE/TLR4. Downstream signaling of HMGB1
  via RAGE and TLR4 receptor activation is facilitated by a number of adaptor proteins,
  which converge through pathways involving MAPK, NFκB, and the transcriptional regulator,
  p53. Activation of these cascades is known to result in the production and release
  of proinflammatory cytokines, TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, and several chemokines.
  IL, interleukin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa
