caption: AEG-1 regulation of HIV-1 neuropathogenesis. HIV-1 neuropathogenesis is characterized
  by the presence of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines along with HIV-1 virions
  and proteins in the microenvironment of astrocytes. These HAND-relevant stimuli
  activate several intracellular signaling cascades in astrocytes, which modulate
  the astrocyte microenvironment by impairing their glutamate clearance and/or chemokine
  and cytokine production. Intracellularly, TNF-α/IL-1β activates the NF-κB pathway
  and induces increased interaction of NF-κB p65 subunit with cytoplasmic AEG-1, which
  then translocates to the nucleus to induce the expression of NF-κB-responsive genes
  such as CCL2 and down-regulates the expression of EAAT2 by up-regulating the expression
  of YY1, an EAAT2 transcriptional repressor, thereby impairing the glutamate clearance.
  Thus, here we show that AEG-1 is a novel regulator of HAND pathogenesis by modulating
  NF-κB-driven cellular processes such as glutamate clearance and chemokine and cytokine
  production by astrocytes.
