caption: Regulation of ROS-mediated activation of the p38 MAPK stress response signaling
  pathway. The pathway shows the mechanism that links the rotenone-mediated production
  of ROS by mitochondrial ETC Complex 1 to the activation of the p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK
  stress response pathways. The model suggests that the Trx-ASK1 complex plays a key
  role in regulation of the p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK stress response signaling pathways.
