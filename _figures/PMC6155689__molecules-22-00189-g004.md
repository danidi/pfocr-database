caption: The first step of the pathway consists of the sulphate uptake through two
  specific permeases in co-transport with 3H+. Then, sulphate is reduced to sulphide
  in several steps using the enzymes ATP sulphurylase and sulphite reductase. The
  sulphide afterwards combines with O-acetylserine to form cysteine or O-acetylhomoserine
  to form homocysteine, which then can be transformed to methionine. H2S derives from
  the S-2 ion, an intermediate in the reduction of sulphate or sulphite for the synthesis
  of these amino acids.
