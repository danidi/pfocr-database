caption: Ghrelin biosynthetic pathway. Ghrelin is synthesized as a 117-amino acid
  precursor, preproghrelin, containing a signal peptide, the 28-amino acid ghrelin
  sequence, and a 66-amino acid C-terminal peptide. The signal peptide is cotranslationally
  cleaved, releasing the 94-amino acid proghrelin into the lumen of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). Attachment of the octanoate group to Ser3 of proghrelin occurs in
  the ER and is catalyzed by GOAT. In secretory granules, prohormone convertase 1/3
  (PC1/3) then cleaves at the C-terminus of acyl proghrelin to give the mature acyl
  ghrelin.
