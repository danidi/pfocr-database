caption: Schematic representation of the inadequate VDR signaling in primary biliary
  cholangitis (PBC). Vitamin D–VDR signaling limits the inflammatory response by targeting
  the miR-155-SOCS1 pathway. We postulate that, as a result of the reduction of VDR
  expression, the negative feedback inhibition loop is not maintained and inflammatory
  response is sustained in PBC. This is caused by miR-155 up-regulation leading to
  excessive suppression of SOCS1. Red arrows depict the changes observed in liver
  tissue of patients with PBC.
