caption: 'Schematic representation depicting how NTHi and TNF-α synergistically activate
  NF-κB as well as the induction of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 in various human epithelial
  cells, including NHBE cells. As indicated, NTHi- and TNF-α-induced synergistic NF-κB
  activation is mediated by two distinct signaling pathways: NF-κB translocation-dependent
  and -independent pathways. The NF-κB translocation-dependent pathway involves NIK-IKK-β/γ-dependent
  phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, whereas the NF-κB translocation-independent
  pathway involves MEKK1-dependent activation of the MKK3/6-p38 MAPK pathway. In addition,
  the same NIK-IKK-IκBα and MEKK1-MKK3/6-p38 pathways are involved also in the synergistic
  induction of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 by NTHi and TNF-α.'
