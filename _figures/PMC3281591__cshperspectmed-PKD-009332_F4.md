caption: Mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Apoptosis can result from the activation
  of two distinct molecular cascades, known as the extrinsic (or death receptor) and
  the intrinsic (or mitochondrial) pathways. Both pathways, which can converge at
  the level of mitochondria, involve the activation of initiator caspases (caspase-8
  and -9, respectively) that catalyze the proteolytic maturation of downstream executioner
  caspases, such as caspase-3, which are the final effectors of cell death. Mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) represents the point-of-no-return in the
  mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Following MOMP, mitochondrial apoptogenic factors
  such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, endonuclease G, or apoptosis-inducing factor
  (AIF) are released to the cytosol. Once into the cytosol, these factors can initiate
  cell death in a caspase-dependent or a caspase-independent manner. Released cytochrome
  c interacts with two other cytosolic protein factors, Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, to
  activate caspase-3. Smac/Diablo can interact with several inhibitors of apoptosis
  (IAPs), thereby relieving the inhibitory effect of IAPs on initiator (e.g., caspase-9)
  and effector (e.g., caspase-3) caspases. AIF and endonuclease G can translocate
  to the nucleus and induce caspase-independent DNA fragmentation. MOMP is highly
  regulated by anti-apoptotic (e.g., Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and pro-apoptotic (e.g., Bax
  and Bak) protein members of the Bcl-2 family. Structurally, all these proteins share
  up to four Bcl-2-homology domains (BH1–BH4). In addition to multidomain Bcl-2 family
  members, there are molecules that share sequence homology only with the BH3 domain
  (such as Bid, Bim, Puma, and Noxa) which can induce cell death either by activating
  multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins or by inactivating anti-apoptotic proteins. Bid
  is activated following its cleavage by caspase-8, thus linking the extrinsic and
  intrinsic pathways at the level of the mitochondria. Whereas several components
  of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis
  of PD, the participation of the extrinsic pathway in PD has not been consistently
  shown (). AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; Casp-9, caspase-9; CL, cardiolipin; OPA1,
  optic atrophy type 1; Cyt. c, cytochrome c; EndoG, endonuclease G; IAP, inhibitor
  of apoptosis; tBid, truncated Bid.
