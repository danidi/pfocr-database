caption: Kinetic model of the EpoR/GATA-1 network implicated in erythrocyte progenitor
  commitment. EpoR and GATA-1 are present at low basal levels before the addition
  of Epo. Epo binds to EpoR homodimers (EpoRJD), thereby activating AKT through the
  PI3K/AKT pathway. Doubly phosphorylated AKT (AKTpp) activates GATA-1 directly and
  indirectly through covalent modifications (modeled here as a single step). GATA-1*,
  the activated form of the transcription factor, upregulates GATA-1 and EpoR gene
  expression by binding to GATA motifs present in the response elements of their corresponding
  genes. The core reaction of the model is the activation of GATA-1 by AKTpp and is
  highlighted with a light gray background. The reactants in the open boxes comprise
  one feedback process (with transcriptional strength F1), a synthesis loop that generates
  more inactive GATA-1 (substrate), and the species in the dark gray boxes represent
  a second feedback process (with transcriptional strength F2), an Epo-regulated loop
  that makes more AKTpp (enzyme). Both feedback loops provide inputs to the core reaction
  to form GATA-1* (product). All reactants except Epo and JAK2 are time variant. Reaction
  sets (1–6, 11, 20, 21, 23, 25, and 26), (7–10, 12–17, 22, and 24), and (18 and 19)
  are modeled with mass-action, Michaelis-Menten, and rapid-equilibrium kinetics,
  respectively. The species names ending with mRNAc and mRNAn denote cytoplasmic and
  nuclear mRNA, respectively. Double-headed and single-headed solid arrows indicate
  reversible and irreversible reactions respectively. Dashed arrows specify irreversible
  reactions (transcription, translation) in which reactants are not consumed. *, p,
  and pp denote the activated, singly phosphorylated, and doubly phosphorylated forms
  of species. All reactions going to null denote first-order degradation processes.
  The values of the rate constants shown in the figure are given in the Supplementary
  Material, Table S5 (Data S1).
