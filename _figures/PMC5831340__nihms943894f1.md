caption: Heme is broken down by heme oxygenase to produce carbon monoxide (CO), iron
  (Fe), and biliverdin. In normal, healthy hepatocytes biliverdin is converted to
  bilirubin via biliverdin reductase A (BVRA). Bilirubin prevents hepatic steatosis
  by elevating the peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) transcriptional
  activity to increase fat burning genes. Alterations in bilirubin production by BVRA
  result in marked steatosis in hepatocytes. Bilirubin is conjugated in hepatocytes
  by the UGT1A1 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme and excreted to bile eventually
  reaching the intestine. Conjugated bilirubin is deconjugated by the gut bacteria
  and reduced to urobilinoids.
