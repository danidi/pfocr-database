caption: A, active site of SsfX3 showing side chains of catalytic residues Ser-174,
  Glu-330, and His-338, residues proposed to be involved in stabilizing the anionic
  tetrahedral transition state (Ala-207 and Ser-235), and Cys-176, which was shown
  to be required for catalysis. B, active site of uncomplexed E. coli TAP (PDB code
  1JRL) () showing the catalytic triad Ser-10, Asp-154, and His-157 and oxyanion hole
  residues Gly-44 and Asn-73 (). C, active site of uncomplexed Cellvibrio japonicas
  CjCE2A (PDB code 2WAA) () showing catalytic triad Ser-160, Asp-333, and His-335
  and oxyanion hole residues Gly-205 and Asn-255. D, proposed mechanism of acyl transfer
  catalyzed by SsfX3 and the roles of oxyanion hole residues.
