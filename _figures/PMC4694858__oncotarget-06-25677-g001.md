caption: One molecule of glucose is catabolised to two molecules of pyruvate releasing
  two ATP molecules. Glucose is transported into the cell by the glucose transporter
  (GLUT) family of molecules and, once inside the cell, is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) by hexokinase. After conversion of G6P to fructose-6-phosphate, a second phosphate
  group is added to fructose-6-phosphate by 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1). Several
  more enzyme reactions eventually produce pyruvate. In normal tissues under aerobic
  conditions, pyruvate is directed into the mitochondrion by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH). Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH) and this is also facilitated by the increased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase 1 (PDHK1), which blocks PDH activity. In malignant cells, this conversion
  of pyruvate to lactate occurs even under aerobic conditions and has been denoted
  the Warburg effect.
