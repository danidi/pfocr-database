caption: This pathway was enriched among the 615 DEPs, with a p-value of 9.398 E-06.
  The expression trends of eight DEPs are shown in the corresponding graphs. The y-axis
  shows the relative abundance of each protein, and the abundance was calculated by
  the log2 (fold-change ratio) of each time point.
