caption: The CWI pathway contributes to the regulation of the conidiation onset and
  cell wall remodeling during asexual differentiation. The CWI pathway is activated
  during the initial stages of asexual competence and culminates with the phosphorylation
  and activation of the MAP kinase MpkA (red circles). MpkA migrates to the nucleus
  and phosphorylates RlmA (the details on the interaction between MpkA and RlmA will
  be published elsewhere). Active RlmA participates in the control of the metabolic
  changes that take place during the asexual differentiation via the activation of
  two distinct sets of genes. (i) RlmA binds to the promoter regions of genes involved
  in conidiation, including the UDAs flbB and flbC and the CRP genes brlA and abaA,
  allowing timely transcription of such regulators. In addition, the Ras signaling
  pathway is activated late in the cascade. (ii) RlmA binds to the promoter regions
  of several genes involved in glucan and chitin metabolism. These enzymes can act
  on the cell wall (not shown) to cause cell wall remodeling aiming to adapt cells
  to the formation of aerial structures and conidiation or to induce autolysis, thus
  contributing to the supply of nutrients required for conidiation. In an additional
  regulatory event, the active MpkA in the cytosol physically associates with proteins
  involved in the conidiation pathway. Collectively, the combined actions of activated
  MpkA and RlmA coordinate alterations in the cell wall composition and timely expression
  of UDAs and CRP, contributing to the formation of conidia and vegetative growth.
  The organization of the conidiation pathway was based on references (, , ). This
