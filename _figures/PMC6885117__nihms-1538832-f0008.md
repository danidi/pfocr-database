caption: Proposed mechanisms for the differential effects of the three dietary DHA
  carriers. 1. DHA from TAG is hydrolyzed by the pancreatic lipase to free DHA and
  monacyl glycerol (MAG) in the intestine, which are then absorbed as TAG-DHA in chylomicrons
  (CM). Free DHA is released by lipolysis of the TAG-DHA of CM by lipoprotein lipase
  at the endothelial surface of various tissues, especially adipose tissue, heart,
  and skeletal muscle, and is taken up by the tissues. The TAG-depleted CM remnants
  are taken up by the liver, which assimilates the DHA into cell membrane lipids or
  incorporates it into VLDL for transport to other tissues. 2. Di-DHA PC is hydrolyzed
  to free DHA (green) and LPC-DHA (red) by pancreatic phospholipase A2 in the intestine.
  The free DHA released from PC follows the same metabolic path as the free DHA released
  from dietary TAG-DHA. The released sn-1 DHA LPC, on the other hand is either incorporated
  into PC of chylomicrons, or possibly enters the blood directly as LPC. Part of the
  DHA taken up by the liver in the form of PC is remodeled and secreted into the blood
  as sn-2 DHA LPC. Small amounts of sn-2 DHA LPC may also be formed from the TAG-DHA
  taken up by the liver. Both sn-1 and sn-2 isomers of LPC-DHA are transported by
  the Mfsd2a pathway into the brain and increase the net content of brain DHA. Free
  DHA, which is generated by lipolysis and is albumin bound in the plasma, has also
  been shown to enter the brain apparently by passive diffusion, but unlike LPC-DHA,
  does not increase the net amount of brain DHA. 3. Dietary LPC-DHA follows the same
  metabolic pathway as the LPC-DHA released from the hydrolysis of di-DHA PC, and
  increases brain DHA content.
