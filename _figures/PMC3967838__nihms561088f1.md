caption: A. Base excision repair pathways in mammalian mitochondria. An oxidized or
  damaged base is excised by a specific glycosylase, leaving an abasic site after
  which APE1 generates a strand break 5′ to the lesion and a 5′deoxyribose phosphate
  group on the downstream DNA. Repair can proceed via the SN-BER pathway (left) or
  the LP-BER pathway (right). In SN-BER, the single nucleotide gap is filled by Polγ
  and the 5′dRP moiety is removed by Polγ’s dRP lyase activity to make a ligatable
  substrate. In LP-BER, DNA synthesis by Polγ displaces the downstream strand to produce
  a 5′flap structure, which can be processed by DNA2 and FEN1. B. Possible involvement
  of DNA2 during mtDNA replication. Polγ is expected to encounter leftover RNA primers
  when terminating replication of circular mtDNA (continuous synthesis) or during
  Okazaki fragment maturation (discontinuous synthesis). If this RNA is not removed
  by RNaseH1, strand displacement DNA synthesis by Polγ generates an RNA-containing
  flap structure that is removed by DNA2 and processed further by FEN1 prior to ligation.
