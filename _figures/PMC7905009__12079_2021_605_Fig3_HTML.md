caption: 'a Scheme representing the different regenerative processes promoted by TGFβ/activin
  signaling. Left to right; (1) TGFβ3 downregulates fibronectin, collagen I and CTGF
  expression, generating a scarless phenotype (truncated black line). (2) In contrast,
  TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 promote expression of molecules that contribute to scar formation
  (black arrow). (3) The activation of TβRI/ALK5 results in the phosphorylation of
  Smad3 to induce aggrecan and α-sma expression (red arrows) and inhibit elastin synthesis
  and MMP 9 and MMP12 activity (truncated red line), resulting in closure of the mouse
  ear hole by regeneration. (4) During the regeneration of the zebrafish retina, MMP-2
  and MMP-9 promote the formation of active TGFβ1, which is induced through Smad3,
  expression of regeneration-associated genes (greenish-blue arrow) and repression
  of some miRNAs (truncated green–blue line) resulting in Müller glia reprogramming
  and MGPC proliferation. (5) During the regeneration of the zebrafish heart, TGFβ1,
  TGFβ2, TGFβ3, and activin A via activate Smad3 via ActRIIA to induce extracellular
  matrix synthesis and cardiomyocyte proliferation in the infarcted area (brown and
  green arrows). (6) Myostatin inhibit extracellular matrix synthesis and cardiomyocyte
  proliferation (truncated purple line) through ActRIIB and the activation of Smad2
  (purple arrow). (7) During limb regeneration of axolotls, it has been hypothesized
  that TGFβ1 promotes proliferation and blastema formation via Smad2 (pink arrows).
  (8) Additionally, Smad2 mediates the activity of TGFβ3 and Activin A to contribute
  to gecko tail regeneration (dark blue arrow). (9) A sequential interaction among
  ERK/TGFβ-Smad2/ROS signals supports tail regeneration in Xenopus tadpoles where
  TGFβ2 and/or TGFβ5 could be involved (orange arrows). (10) Through ActRIB/ALK4,
  activin contributes to the outgrowth of zebrafish fin during regeneration (dark
  brown arrow). b Scheme representing different regenerative processes that are inhibited
  by TGFβ/activin signaling. Left to right: (1) In terms of planarian regeneration,
  follistatin blocks the anti-regenerative activity of activins that inhibit the proliferation
  of blastema neoblasts as well as expression of wound and respecification-related
  genes (black truncated lines). (2) Activin A and Activin B through ActRIIB and ActRIB
  as well as TGFβ1, TGFβ3 activate Smad3 to inhibit Müller glia proliferation (purple
  truncated line). This response is controlled by the co-repressors TGIF1 and six3b.
  (3) TGFβ1 through Smad3 induces fibrosis, resulting in inhibition of mouse ear regeneration
  during the re-differentiation stage (green arrows). (4) TGFβ1 blocks the proliferation
  of hepatocytes (red truncated line) via Smad2 and β2SP. Additionally, HMGB1 promotes
  the immune response, resulting in activation of the TGFβ pathway via Smad2 to induce
  fibrosis in the liver, disrupting hepatic regeneration (purple arrows). The corepressor
  SnoN modulates the fibrotic activity of TGFβ'
