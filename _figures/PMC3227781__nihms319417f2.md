caption: Genomic and nongenomic vascular effects of estrogen. In the genomic pathway
  in endothelial cells, E2 binds to cytoplasmic ER leading to ER dimerization and
  localization to the nucleus where the complex interacts with EREs to increase gene
  transcription and eNOS expression. In the nongenomic pathway, E2 binds to endothelial
  ER and activates phospholipase C (PLC), generating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)
  and DAG. IP3 causes Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ forms a complex
  with calmodulin (CAM), which activates eNOS. E2/ER also interacts with Src and activates
  Modulator of Nongenomic Action of ER (MNAR). They interact with the p85 regulatory
  subunit of PI3-kinase (PI3K), which transforms phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates Akt.
  ER-mediated activation of Akt or MAPK pathway causes phosphorylation and full activation
  of eNOS, transformation of L-arginine to L-citrulline and production of NO, which
  causes VSM relaxation. E2 also binds to membrane GPR30 and activates adenylate cyclase
  (AC) leading to increased cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which activates
  eNOS and COX1 to produce NO and PGI2, respectively. E2 also induces production of
  EDHF. In the genomic pathway in VSM, E2 binds to ER, inhibiting growth factor (GF)
  receptors, which are known to activate MAPK translocation to the nucleus. E2 binding
  to ERs also stimulates ER translocation to the nucleus where it may affect gene
  transcription and VSM growth. In the non-genomic pathway, E2 binds to membrane ERs
  to inhibit the mechanisms of VSM contraction including [Ca2+]i, Ca2+-dependent MLC
  phosphorylation, protein kinase C (PKC), and Rho-kinase (Rho-K). Endothelial NO
  and PGI2 activate guanylate cyclase (GC) and AC, respectively, leading to increased
  cGMP/cAMP and increased activity of protein kinase G and A (PKG and PKA), respectively.
  PKG/PKA activate Ca2+ extrusion via plasmalemmal Ca2+ pump and Ca2+ uptake by SR,
  and inhibit Ca2+ entry through membrane Ca2+ channels. E2 may also bind plasma membrane
  ERs and activate K+ channels and other EDHF leading to hyperpolarization and inhibition
  of membrane Ca2+ channels. COX1, cyclooxygenase-1; DAG, diacylglycerol; EDHF, Endothelial
  derived hyperpolarizing factor; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ER, estrogen
  receptor; ERE, estrogen response elements; PGI2, prostacyclin; MAPK, mitogen-activated
