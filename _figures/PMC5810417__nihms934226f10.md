caption: With an appropriate signal, Prdx6 is phosphorylated via mitogen activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) activity and binds to phospholipid in the cell membrane. LysoPC
  that is generated from PC by the PLA2 activity of Prdx6 can be metabolized via lysophospholipase
  D (lysoPLD) to lysophosphatidic acid (lysoPA). Interaction of lysoPA with its receptor
  (LPAR type 1) leads to release of rac (rac1 or 2 depending on cell type), one of
  the cytosolic protein co-factors required for NOX2 activation []. Other important
  co-factors for activation include phosphorylated p47phox and phosphorylated p67phox.
