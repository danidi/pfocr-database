caption: 'Heme biosynthetic pathway in erythroid cells. Schematic representation of
  the heme biosynthetic pathway in erythroid cells. Heme synthesis begins with the
  condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA to form ALA. Next, ALA is transported outside
  of the mitochondria and catalyzed to form coproporphyrinogen III. CPOX converts
  coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX, which is subsequently oxidized
  into protoporphyrin IX by PPOX. Finally, ferrous iron is incorporated into protoporphyrinogen
  IX to form heme in a reaction catalyzed by FECH. FECH is localized in the inner
  mitochondrial membrane and associates with MFRN1 and ABCB10. SLC25A38 and ABCB10
  have been proposed as mitochondrial ALA exporters located on the inner mitochondrial
  membrane. ABCB6 and TMEM14C have been proposed as putative coproporphyrinogen III
  and protoporphyrinogen IX importers, respectively. FLVCR1b is a mitochondrial heme
  exporter. Tf-bound Fe3+ is bound to TfR, released into endosome, and reduced to
  Fe2+ by STEAP3. Subsequently, Fe2+ exits the endosome via DMT1 and enters the mitochondria
  via MFRN1. ALAS2: erythroid-specific δ-aminolevulinate synthase, ALA: δ-aminolevulinic
