caption: 'Schematic representation of the erbB family and the IGF/IGF-1R system. (A)
  The family of erbB receptors includes four members: EGFR (erbB1), HER2 (neu/erbB2),
  HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4). All members have an extracellular ligand binding
  region (cysteine rich domain), a single membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic
  tyrosine-kinase-containing domain. Ligand, such as TGF-α etc, binding to erbB receptors
  induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the
  intrinsic kinase domain, thus resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine
  residues within the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking
  sites for a range of proteins, the recruitment of which leads to the activation
  of intracellular signaling pathways, including the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.
  (B) The IGF/IGF-1R system is composed of ligands (IGF-1 and IGF-2), receptor (IGF-1R),
  and ligand binding proteins (IGFBPs). IGF-1 and IGF-2 are found in the circulation
  complexed to IGFBPs, which serve to regulate the bioavailability of these ligands
  in the tissues. The IGF-1R contains two α (cysteine rich domain) and two β (tyrosine
  kinase domain) subunits which are joined by disulfide bridges to form a heterotetrameric
  receptor complex. The IGF/IGF-1R interaction results in phosphorylation of tyrosine
  residues in the tyrosine kinase domain. After autophosphorylation, the receptor
  kinase phosphorylates intracellular proteins, which enable activation of the PI3K/Akt
  and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways. A detailed description of the downstream signaling
  pathway is provided in “”.'
