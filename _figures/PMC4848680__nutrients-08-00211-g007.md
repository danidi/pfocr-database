caption: JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Upon the binding ligand, receptor-associated
  Janus Kinases (JAKs) become activated and mediate phosphorylation of specific receptor
  tyrosine residues. This leads to the recruitment of specific STATs (Signal Transducers
  and Activators of Transcription), which are then also tyrosine-phosphorylated. Activated
  STATs are released from the receptor, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus
  to bind target genes associated with proliferation, differentiation and survival
  of the cells, including immune cells. The inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  by flavonoids treatments leads to an immunomodulatory effect.
