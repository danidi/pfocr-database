caption: The schematic diagram of NELL-1 signaling pathways in osteoblast cells. As
  a secreted molecule, NELL-1 may initiate cellular signaling through binding to its
  putative specific receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK?) and/or co-factor (integrin β?)
  on the cell surface. The Ras-ERK/JNK pathways play a critical role in Nell-1-mediated
  Opn induction in osteoblast cells. In contrast, the primary mechanism of BMP-2 signaling
  is through the Smad1/5/8 pathway. There are some overlaps (not shown) in the activation
  of MAPK pathways by NELL-1 and BMP-2 in which NELL-1 preferentially activates ERK
  and JNK, while BMP-2 predominantly activates P38. However, the physical interaction
  between NELL-1 and BMP-2 remains unknown.
