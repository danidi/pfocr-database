caption: Regulation of hepcidin expression in hepatocytes in response to iron status
  and requirements (left) or inflammation (right). Tissue iron increases the expression
  of bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6), which acts on the BMP receptor (BMP-R) and
  co-receptor hemojuvelin (HJV). This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of
  the receptor-associated small-mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) 1/5/8 proteins,
  which then bind to SMAD4, translocate to the nucleus and up-regulate transcription
  of the HAMP gene to produce hepcidin. Plasma iron is sensed by the hemochromatosis
  protein HFE and the type 2 transferrin receptor (TfR2), leading to modulation of
  BMP/SMAD signals. Iron deficiency inhibits BMP/SMAD signals by inducing degradation
  of HJV, while erythropoiesis inhibits hepcidin expression through the action of
  erythroferrone. In inflammatory states, cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-22 act on
  their respective receptors to activate the Janus kinases (JAK)1/2, leading to phosphorylation
  and dimerization of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).
  Dimeric STAT3 translocates to the nucleus to up-regulate HAMP transcription and
  increase hepcidin production. Activin B produced during inflammation increases HAMP
  transcription by activating the BMP/SMAD pathway. Additional inflammatory mediators,
  including other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress and agonists of innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), induce
  signals that activate other transcription (Tx) factors and up-regulate HAMP transcription.
