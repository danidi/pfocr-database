caption: Hypothetic mechanism of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
  (NAFLD/NASH) progression. Excessive intake of excess calories and fat results in
  accumulation of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and free fatty acids, inducing
  hepatic steatosis. The overload of liver lipids enhances lipid peroxidation, which
  induces the production of reactive oxygen species and steatohepatitis. Hepatic inflammation
  activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and nuclear factor-κB, resulting
  in insulin resistance. Insulin resistance also promotes de novo lipogenesis, forcing
  the healthy liver to develop NASH. The inflammation also recruits Kupffer cells
  and polarizes M1 macrophages, activating hepatic stellate cells and finally leading
  to liver fibrosis. TG, triglycerides; TC, total cholesterol; FFA, free fatty acids;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB.
