caption: Androgen‐regulated lncRNAs, SOCS2‐AS1 and POTEF‐AS1 promote prostate cancer
  growth. Androgen‐induced SOCS2‐AS1 and SOCS2 promote cell growth. Furthermore, SOCS2‐AS1
  activates androgen signaling to enhance cell growth, migration and anti‐apoptosis
  signals, repressing genes related to the apoptosis pathway. POTEF‐AS1, represses
  genes related to Toll‐like receptor (TLR) signaling and apoptosis pathways, promoting
  cell growth and inhibiting apoptosis.
