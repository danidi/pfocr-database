caption: Role of astrocyte K+ and signaling channels. Shown is a confocal image of
  a hippocampal astrocyte in situ revealed by intracellular loading of Alexa Fluor-488
  (courtesy of Jonathan Zapata). Scale bar, 20 μm. A, Kir 4.1 functions as a major
  K+ channel establishing hyperpolarized astrocyte membrane potential and spatially
  redistributing the K+ concentration. B, Cx43 hemichannels modulate basal glutamatergic
  synaptic activity through ATP signaling. In basal conditions, Cx43 hemichannels
  boost hippocampal excitatory postsynaptic activity through ATP signaling. A possible
  scenario is that Cx43 hemichannels release ATP, which activates P2 receptors on
  CA1 pyramidal cells that increase glutamatergic postsynaptic activity. C, Astrocytic
  GABA is produced via putrescine degradation pathway with a key biosynthetic enzyme,
  MAOB. GABA release from Best1 contributes significantly to the tonic GABA release
  under physiological and various pathologic conditions. D, Activation of mGluR3 translocates
  TWIK-1 from recycling endosome to membrane that enhances NH4+ uptake, which may
  facilitate glutamine-glutamate cycle for replenishment of neurotransmitters in neurons.
