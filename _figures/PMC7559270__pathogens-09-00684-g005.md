caption: 'Schematic representation of the primary metabolic pathways in mammalian
  and fungal cells. In mammalian cells, glycolysis leads to the formation of pyruvate
  which is utilized in the TCA cycle and can also be converted to lactate. In the
  non-fermenting yeast, C. neoformans, acetate is produced via at least two routes:
  the phosphoketolase pathway (predicted based on the presence of the key enzymes)
  and pyruvate conversion to acetaldehyde. In the fermenting yeast S. cerevisiae,
  ethanol is the main fermentation product created even when glucose is abundant.
  Single dashed lines represent mitochondria where the electron transport chain (ETC)
  and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle operate. Extracellular acidification (measured
  as ECAR) is caused by hydration of CO2 to form carbonic acid, extrusion of protons
  via plasma membrane H+-ATPase (fungi) and the production of lactate (mammalian cells)
  or acetate (fungi). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) predominantly reflects mitochondrial
  respiration but can also reflect the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).'
