caption: The CD8 T cell linear differentiation model. Naïve T cells in acute viral
  infections become activated in lymphoid tissues via canonical and cross presentation
  of viral antigens by antigen-presenting cells. The activation process ensues with
  the delivery of signal 1 + 2 and IL2 production. IL2 subsequently diffuses locally
  and binds IL2 receptor to generate high affinity IL2-R that promotes IL2-R mediating
  signaling pathway, which is important for proliferation and survival of antigen-specific
  CD8 T cells. Activated CD8 T cells react with virally infected cells and undergo
  proliferative expansion and differentiate into terminal T effector cells generating
  alongside memory precursors that differentiate further into central memory and T
  effector memory subsets. These memory subsets persist at various sites in vivo.–
  The transcription factor expression pattern in CD8 T effector, T cell exhaustion
  and T cell memory subsets are shown.
