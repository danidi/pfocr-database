caption: Roles of natural killer cells in the esophageal cancer tumor microenvironment.
  (A) Natural killer (NK) cells exert essential anti-tumor functions through degranulation,
  cytokine release, and activated receptor expression, directly killing esophageal
  tumor cells in the absence of antigen recognition in the tumor microenvironment
  (TME). (B) Cancer cells can escape from NK cell immune surveillance in the TME through
  the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and the competitive combination of activated NKp30 receptor,
  expressed on NK cells, by releasing soluble B7-H6 (indicated as sB7-H6). Otherwise,
  large amounts of H2O2 produced by tumor infiltrated macrophages in the TME are prone
  to induce CD56dim NK cell apoptosis, while CD56dim NK cells can also transform to
  a CD56bright phenotype during tumor development, as well as decreasing in number
  and becoming dysfunctional.
