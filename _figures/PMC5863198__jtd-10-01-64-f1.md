caption: 'All roads lead to Rome: vascular inflammation. Multiple pro-inflammatory
  pathways can participate in triggering and amplifying endothelial dysfunction, offering
  multiple venues to explore, target wise. IL-1 pathway blockade offers three targets
  worth exploring: blocking the cytokine (canakinumab), its receptor (anakinra) or
  IL-1 receptor antagonist therapy. In regards to cholesterol synthesis, besides the
  obvious hypolipemic effect observed with statins, it can also be argued that they
  lower geranyl-geranyl-pyrophosphate, and in this, lowering Rac1 activation. Ergo,
  farnesylation inhibition is also an attractive target for oxidative stress control.
  As for immunization, conventional and experimental vaccines have been proposed.
  Rac1 activation it’s common pathway of endothelial inflammation for C. pneumoniae,
  so a pathogen-specific therapeutic vaccine is viable target. Vaccines against neoantigens
  such as ApoB100, and specific common epitopes which are conserved even after LDL
  modification, are underway. Finally, using ApoA1 mimetics is a direct way to accelerate
  and increase the efficacy of reverse cholesterol transport. IL, interleukin; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor-α; Rac1, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; SMC,
  smooth muscle cell; VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein;
  LDL, low density lipoprotein; mLDL, modified low density lipoprotein; ApoB100, apolipoprotein
  B100; HMG-CoA, hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A; NLRP3, Nod-like receptor family
  pyrin domain containing 3; NF-κβ, nuclear factor-κβ; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  p38, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases.'
