caption: a2V regulates Notch and TGF-β signaling in mammary gland through its role
  in endolysosomal acidification. The V-ATPase (orange) is responsible for acidic
  pH maintenance in intracellular vesicles like Golgi, endosomes and lysosomes and
  on the plasma membrane. During canonical Notch Signaling (pink), Notch receptor
  is cleaved in Golgi and translocated to the plasma membrane where further cleavage
  of the receptor occurs in response to ligand binding. Finally, NICD is cleaved in
  the endosomes translocating it to the nucleus to activate Notch target genes. Similarly,
  TGF-β (green) protein is glycosylated in the Golgi and complexed to latent membrane
  proteins to form mature TGF-β, which is secreted into the extracellular space. The
  binding of TGF-β to its receptor (TGF-βR) results in endocytosis and phosphorylation
  of Smad2, which in turn activates TGF-β target genes. Both Notch and TGF-β pathway
  mediators depend on V-ATPase-mediated acidification for cleavage and activation
  of pathway mediators by acid-dependent enzymes, sustenance of basal signaling by
  recycling endosomes and degradation of signaling molecules in lysosomes. Therefore,
  manipulation of V-ATPase activity results in dysregulated signaling, which in turn
  effects mammary epithelial cell fate and proliferation
