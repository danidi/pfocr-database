caption: Short-patch BER pathway. A DNA glycosylase excises an aberrant base (e.g.
  uracil = U or thymine glycol = Tg). Monofunctional glycosylases create an AP site,
  which is incised by APE1 (left), whereas bifunctional glycosylases cleave the DNA
  backbone at the AP site via β-elimination or β,δ-elimination, creating a 3′-terminus
  that must be removed by APE1 (center) or polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP)
  (right), respectively. Following end-cleanup (highlighted in red), single-nucleotide
  repair synthesis is conducted by POLβ and nick ligation is carried out by an XRCC1/LIG3α
  complex (highlighted in blue). See text for additional details.
