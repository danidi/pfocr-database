caption: Schematic of the biosynthetic pathway leading to erythromycin A (1) in the
  bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea. The first stage of biosynthesis occurs on
  a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) incorporating three gigantic multienzyme polypeptides,
  DEBS 1, 2 and 3. Each of these subunits contains two chain extension modules, while
  DEBS 1 additionally incorporates a loading module to initiate the biosynthesis,
  and DEBS 3, a termination module, consisting of a thioesterase (TE) domain. Each
  of the chain extension modules includes three essential domains (ketosynthase (KS),
  acyl transferase (AT) and acyl carrier protein (ACP)), and a variable complement
  of processing activities (ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) and enoyl reductase
  (ER)). The number and character of the variable domains correlates precisely with
  the structure of the resulting intermediates (the building block added at each stage
  is color-coded to match the module responsible). Following release of the chain
  from the PKS, the first free intermediate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B, is further modified
  by a series of post-PKS enzymes to yield the final, bioactive metabolite.
