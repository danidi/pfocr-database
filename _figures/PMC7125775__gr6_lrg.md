caption: Innate immunity and the mucosa. (A) Pathogenesis of leaky gut. The epithelial
  barrier normally restricts passage of luminal contents, including microbes and their
  products, but a small fraction of these materials do cross the tight junction. This
  diagram shows how DCs, and macrophages (M) react to these materials. These innate
  immune cells release cytokines that exert proinflammatory (TNF and interferon-gamma
  [IFN-γ]) and anti-inflammatory (IL-13) effects. If proinflammatory signals dominate
  and signal to the epithelium, MLCK can be activated to cause barrier dysfunction
  through the “leak pathway,” allowing an increase in the amount of luminal material
  presented to immune cells. In the absence of appropriate immune regulation, immune
  activation may cause further proinflammatory immune activation, cytokine release,
  and barrier loss, resulting in a self-amplifying cycle that can result in disease.
  (B) Neutrophil collateral damage from NET formation. Neutrophil lysis after phagocytosis.
  Cytolysis can be programmed, for example, necroptosis, or caused by direct damage.
  Neutrophil lysis is caused by cytolytic toxins, pore-forming agents, physical injury,
  or frustrated phagocytosis. This can result in the formation of NETs during neutrophil
  lysis. Hydrolytic enzymes–DNA complexes are released in the NETs, enhancing the
  proinflammatory response and tissue destruction, contributing to collateral damage
  and disease.
