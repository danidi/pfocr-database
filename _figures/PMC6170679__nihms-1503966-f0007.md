caption: A, myeloid cells in CXCR4WT mice promote NK cell apoptosis through Fas signal
  pathway and inactivation of NK cells through restricted IL18 production, resulting
  in reduced NK cell antitumor immunity. B, knockout of CXCR4 in myeloid cells enhances
  neutrophil release of IL18, which boosts the percentage of IFNγ-expressing NK cells.
  These activated NK cells exhibit enhanced NK cell–mediated tumor cell killing. NK
  cells from mice with knock out of CXCR4 in myeloid cells exhibit increased Fas ligand
  -mediated killing of Fas-expressing tumor cells, conferring enhanced antitumor immunity.
