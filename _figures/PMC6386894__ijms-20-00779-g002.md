caption: The role of cAMP in the maintenance of extracellular environment by astrocytes.
  (Left) Acute cAMP increase by cAMP analogues or adenylyl cyclase activators has
  been shown to decrease glutamate re-uptake through endocytosis of glutamate transporters.
  Astrocytic cAMP can also decrease the expression of glutamate transporters. In addition,
  short-term cAMP increase in astrocytes facilitates the clustering and also elevates
  water permeability of aquaporin 4 (AQP4). (Right) Long-term cAMP increase can induce
  the expression of AQP4, GLT1, connexin, and NKCC1.
