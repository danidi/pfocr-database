caption: Relative distributions of absolute carbon fluxes in E. coli central carbon
  metabolism during steady-states I to III (A, top to bottom) and IV to VI (B, top
  to bottom) of the experiment shown in Fig. . All fluxes are normalized to the specific
  glucose uptake rates, which correspond to the absolute fluxes given for glucose
  phosphorylation. Absolute fluxes are also given for the net NAD(P)H formation rate,
  which corresponds to the total NAD(P)H formation by glucose catabolism minus the
  amount of NAD(P)H consumed for net biomass synthesis. The contribution of the PP
  pathway toward glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6-P) consumption was set to 45% ().
