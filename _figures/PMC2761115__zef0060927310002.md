caption: Gonad function and sexual differentiation. As shown, several major gene products
  influence the formation of the bipotential gonad (light gray), the development of
  the ovary (white), and the development of the testis (dark gray). SF1 is a central
  player in the bipotential gonad, being regulated by WT1, LHX9, and M33 (CBX2), and
  at other steps in gonadal differentiation. In XY gonads, SRY functions in a short
  window in pre-Sertoli cells to up-regulate the transcription of SOX9 that is already
  expressed at low levels through the action of SF1. This higher SOX9 expression then
  suppresses SRY in a negative feedback loop and also up-regulates itself through
  the combined actions of SF1 and SOX9 on the SOX9 promoter. SOX9 also up-regulates
  FGF9 that signals back through FGFR2 to maintain/increase SOX9 expression. The ovarian
  differentiation pathway involves RSPO1 increasing the signaling of WNT4, which up-regulates
  β-catenin. β-catenin acts to up-regulate WNT4 and other proteins such as FST. The
  testis pathway appears to mainly antagonize this pathway through decreasing β-catenin
  levels. Likewise, β-catenin antagonizes the testis pathway by destabilizing SOX9.

  description: Gonad function and sexual differentiation. As shown, several major

    SF1 is a central player in the bipotential gonad, being regulated by WT1, LHX9,

    functions in a short window in pre-Sertoli cells to up-regulate the transcription

    higher SOX9 expression then suppresses SRY in a negative feedback loop and also

    SOX9 also up-regulates FGF9 that signals back through FGFR2 to maintain/increase
    SOX9 expression. The ovarian differentiation pathway involves RSPO1 increasing
    the signaling of WNT4, which up-regulates β-catenin. β-catenin acts to up-regulate
