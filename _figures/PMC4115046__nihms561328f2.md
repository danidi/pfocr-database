caption: Synthesis of nucleotides begins with formation of ribose-5-phosphate from
  glucose. Along with glutamine, which donates the necessary nitrogen, a number of
  modifications lead to formation of nucleotides. A change in RRM1, RRM2, or p53R2
  expression can lead to dNTP pool imbalances. Ultimately, this imbalance leads to
  replication stress and impaired DNA damage repair, which consequently increases
  DNA damage, genomic instability, and mutations. This ultimately contributes to cell
  transformation and cancer. Numerous inhibitors have been developed to inhibit RRM2
  and p53R2, including HU (hydroxyurea), trimidox, Triapine (3-AP), and GTI-2040.
