caption: The role of Rv2607 is shown in red. In E. coli, PNPOx catalyzes the last
  step in the DXP-dependent PLP biosynthetic pathway . Most organisms capable of PLP
  biosynthesis produce PLP via PLP synthase, a macromolecular complex consisting of
  Pdx1 and Pdx2 . Organisms with genes that encode both PLP synthase and PNPOx likely
  use PNPOx to salavage PLP from PNP and PMP, which are produced by enzymes that use
  PLP as a cofactor.
