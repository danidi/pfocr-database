caption: 'T Cell Signaling and Gene Regulation Defects in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
  (SLE). In SLE patients, increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) levels and activity
  in T cells suppresses Ets-like-factor-1 (ELF-1), a transcriptional enhancer of the
  CD3ζ chain and a repressor of the FcεRIγ (Fcγ) chain. TCR/CD3 complex rewiring,
  via replacement of CD3ζ with Fcγ, results in increased calcium responses, enhancing
  the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), which in
  turn increases the binding of cAMP response element modulator (CREMα) and inducible
  cAMP early repressor (ICER). CREMα is also activated by ERα, and is recruited to
  the IL17A and IL2 promoters, enhancing and repressing their transcription, respectively
  [,]. It is known that CaMIV activity is enhanced by the presence of costimulatory
  molecules such as ICOS in preformed lipid-rafts containing the TCR, which can lead
  to activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway; enhanced activity of protein phosphatase
  2A (PP2A) and SHP2 suppresses the MAPK–DNMT1 pathway and dephosphorylates cAMP-responsive
  element-binding protein 1 (CREB), resulting in suppression of IL2 transcription
  []. PP2A also acts through Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) to enhance binding
  of the IL17 transcription enhancer interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4); signaling
  through CD44 also activates ROCK, which promotes cell migration and binding of IRF4
  to the IL17 promoter [,]. TLRs and SLAMF signaling can activate the transcription
  factors NF-κB and NFAT, and this contributes to the transcription of proinflammatory
  cytokines []. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 cause
  downstream activation of STAT3 transcriptional targets, including IL17 and BCL6,
  contributing to inflammation and supporting antibody production from B cells Abbreviations:
  [,]. ER, estrogen receptor; ICOS, inducible T cell costimulator; SHP2, Src homology
  2 domain containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2; TCR, T cell receptor; Tfh, T
  follicular helper cells; TLR, Toll-like receptor.'
