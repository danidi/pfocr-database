caption: CXCL13 in prostate cancer. In prostate tumors, CXCL13 can be produced both
  by cancer cells as well as by cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as myofibroblasts.
  In prostate cancer cells, up-regulation of the kinase PKCε and loss of the tumor
  suppressor Pten (which leads to elevated PI3K activity) lead to the activation of
  the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, and transcriptionally activate the CXCL13 gene.
  CXCL13 produced in this autocrine manner, together with CXCL13 generated by stromal
  cells, may significantly impact on the tumorigenic and metastatic phenotypes of
  androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.
