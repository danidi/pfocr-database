caption: 'Alanine‐ and β‐alanine aminotransferase. (a) Catalysis of alanine aminotransferase
  (indicated by the yellow arrow). The enzyme utilizes alanine as the amino donor
  and α‐ketoglutarate as the amino acceptor to synthesize L‐glutamate and pyruvate
  in one direction. The enzyme utilizes glutamate and pyruvate as the cognate pair
  in the reverse direction. (b) β‐alanine synthesis from the propionate pathway. β‐Alanine
  aminotransferase (indicated by the yellow arrow) catalyzes the synthesis of β‐alanine
  and pyruvate using L‐alanine as the amino donor and malonate semialdehyde as the
  amino acceptor. The EC numbers of the enzymes shown in brackets correspond to the
  following enzymes: [6.2.1.17] = propionyl‐CoA synthetase, [1.3.99.3] = acyl‐CoA
  dehydrogenase, [4.2.1.116] = 3‐hydroxypropionyl‐CoA dehydratase, [3.2.1.4] = 3‐hydroxyisobutyryl‐CoA
  hydrolase, [1.1.1.59] = 3‐hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase, [2.6.1.18] = β‐alanine:pyruvate
  aminotransferase, and [2.6.1.2] = alanine aminotransferase. The yellow arrows indicate
  the reactions catalyzed by β‐alanine and L‐alanine aminotransferase'
