caption: 'ING proteins are involved in the DNA Damage Response. ING1 is involved in
  UV damage: activated after UV damage, Chk1 phosphorylates ING1 on Ser126 which will
  stabilize it. ING1 is then able to promote XPA recruitment and subsequent DNA repair
  by NER. ING2, which facilitates NER, is also required in DSB repair in which it
  participates in 53BP1 accumulation at DSB sites. ING3 participates in the DDR pathway
  by promoting ATM activation and the signaling pathway that finally leads to the
  accumulation of 53BP1 or BRCA1 then initiating repair by either NHEJ or HR respectively.
  ING5 was described as a TIP60 cofactor that promotes BRCA1 accumulation thanks to
  H4K16 acetylation.'
