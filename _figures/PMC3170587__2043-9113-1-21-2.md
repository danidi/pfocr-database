caption: The signaling pathway networks. Networks are generated for stroma only and
  epithelium only with p < 0.01. The proteins (represented by nodes) are placed in
  their intra-cellular localization, with the plasma membrane represented at top and
  the nucleus at the bottom. The nodes are colored blue if they are within 250 kb
  of an identified cold spot and red if they are within 250 kb of an identified hot
  spot. Pink nodes represent the intermediary proteins identified through the computational
  framework. The interaction colors represent the Pearson's correlation coefficient
  (r) of the two neighboring proteins' mRNA levels. If the edge is colored red, the
  two proteins have a positive mRNA expression correlation, whereas green represents
  the opposite. The solid edges show known interactions, while the dashed edges are
  interactions predicted via homology/family information []. The predicted interactions
  are bolded if they are verified with independent studies through a literature search.
