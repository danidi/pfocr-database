caption: Hyperglycemia- and hyperlipidemia-induced cardiomyocyte cytoplasmic ROS generation
  in dCM. Glucose enters cardiomyocytes via the SGLT1. The oxPPP provides NADPH for
  NADPH oxidase (Nox2), which generates superoxide (O2•−). Nox2 needs the translocation
  of subunit P47phox to the membrane to be activated. The activation of the signaling
  pathway PCKβ2–small GTPase Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) by
  high glucose concentration induces this translocation. PKCβ2 is also activated by
  a positive feedback loop involving the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway and the overexpression
  of the iNOS. CaMKII hyper-phosphorylation caused by elevated intracellular calcium
  (Ca2+) concentration is also probably involved in PCKβ2 activation. Finally, hyperglycemia
  also contributes to the generation of AGE that, through their receptor RAGE, induces
  oxidative stress. When present at high concentrations, LCFA can be reduced in peroxisomes
  before entering the mitochondria, thus generating H2O2. AGE, advanced glycation
  end-products; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase II; dCM, diabetic cardiomyopathy;
  G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; G6PD, G-6-P dehydrogenase; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide;
  iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; LCFA, long chain fatty acids; NCX, sodium-calcium
  exchanger; NHE, sodium-proton exchanger; NO, nitric oxide; ONOO−, peroxynitrite;
  PCKβ2, protein kinase C β2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SGLT1, sodium/glucose
  co-transporter.
