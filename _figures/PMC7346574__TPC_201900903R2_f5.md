caption: Protein Family Analysis to Identify ASTREL Genes.(A) Schematic diagram of
  the OrthoMCL approach to cluster protein families separately among monocot and eudicot
  species and then filtering for protein families present in species with EDS1. Proteins
  are denoted by different line drawings, colored by species of origin. Phylogenetic
  trees represent gene trees for each protein. The diagram at the bottom provides
  the number of Arabidopsis proteins that are absent only in monocots, eudicots, or
  in all angiosperms without EDS1.(B) Illustration of the GeneSeqToFamily method,
  which uses monocot and eudicot proteomes together to establish gene trees across
  the angiosperms.(C) Diagram summarizing the results of the two methods. Genes and
  numbers marked in red are those subsequently referred to as ASTREL genes.(D) Schematic
  of gene clustering followed by blastp and tblastn to filter ASTREL genes for presence
  or absence in the A. officinalis genome.
