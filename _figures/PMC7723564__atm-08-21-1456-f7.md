caption: The primary mechanism of PRP improves chronic inflammatory pain. Astrocyte
  activation after CFA or LPS stimulation. The uptake of more glucose by activated
  astrocytes increases aerobic glycolysis and promotes sustained activation of living
  astrocytes and secretion of HMGB1 through the STAT3 signaling pathway. PRP ameliorates
  inflammatory pain by inhibiting PKM2-mediated aerobic glycolysis and the STAT3 signaling
  pathway to reduce activation of astrocytes and HMGB1 secretion. PRP, platelet-rich
  plasma; CFA, complete Freund’s adjuvant. LPS, lipopolysaccharide.
