caption: Mechanisms of lipotoxicity in NAFLD. The mechanisms of lipotoxicity involve
  several cellular processes, such as ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal
  dysfunction, the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and hypoxia, ultimately
  leading to cell death. Additionally, the activation of JNK signaling pathway also
  plays an important role in lipoapoptosis and its activation is closely associated
  with ER stress/UPR and mitochondrial dysfunction
