caption: Energetic organelles of Chlamydomonas. In the chloroplast, the light reactions
  and electron transfer chain feed NADPH and ATP toward the carbon fixation pathway
  (Calvin cycle). In the mitochondria, the major components of the respiratory chain
  produce ATP at the expense of NADH. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has one chloroplast
  and multiple mitochondria which appear tightly packed together in electron micrographs.
  A possible pathway for the transfer of reductants from one organelle to the other,
  the malate shunt, is shown here. Black arrows denote electron and proton transfer
  pathways, green and red arrows denote alternative electron transfer pathways, and
  blue arrows denote ATP synthesis. P-phase, positive phase; N-phase, negative phase;
  UQH2, ubiquinol; c, soluble cytochrome; hυ, photon energy; MDH, malate dehydrogenase;
  OMT, oxoglutarate/malate transporter.
