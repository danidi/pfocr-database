caption: 'Kv1.3 regulates cell proliferation independently from ion conductance: the
  «voltage sensor model». Changes in the plasma membrane potential, that occur during
  cell cycle progression or upon application of external stimuli, induce a conformational
  change in Kv1.3 due to its voltage-sensor domain. Because Kv1.3 interacts with other
  proteins in large complexes (the so-called Kv1.3 channelosome), these conformational
  changes translate into phosphorylation of the C-terminus of Kv1.3 and activation
  of pro-proliferative signal transduction cascades, including integrin and growth
  factor receptor (GFR) signaling. These events result in activation of Ras, which
  activates the Raf/Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/Extracellular signal-Regulated
  Kinase (ERK) pathway, finally leading to proliferation mediated by different downstream
  transcription factors (TF) such as c-Myc (). This figure was created using images
