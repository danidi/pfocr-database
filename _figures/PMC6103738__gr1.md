caption: '(left) A schematic diagram of the Drosophila wing disc. The arrow indicates
  the direction from distal to proximal. The shaded area denotes the wing pouch, and
  the hinge region is outside the wing pouch and enclosed by the dashed curve. (right)
  A schematic of the signaling network in contiguous cells. Solid lines denote activation,
  and dashed lines denote inhibition. There are two major Ft/Ds-controlled pathways
  described in the text: one promoting Yki phosphorylation via Ft inhibition of Dachs
  membrane-localization and destruction of Wts and one promoting Yki activity via
  inactivation of Wts through Riq. To see this figure in color, go online.'
