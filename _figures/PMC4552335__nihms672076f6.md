caption: Proposed pathways through which ethanol administration elicits alterations
  in cytokine gene expression. (A) Bacterial infection induced by administration of
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates an immune response via activation of the TLR4/CD14
  receptor complex. In the resting state IκBα binds to NF-κB, thus keeping NF-κB inactive
  and sequestered in the cytoplasm. Once LPS binds to TLR4s, a signaling cascade is
  induced that results in activation of the IKK complex. The IKK complex then phosphorylates
  IκBα, which liberates NF-κB and allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where
  it activates gene transcription. Ultimately, cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, and
  TNFα are produced by this NF-κB activation. Additionally, NF-κB activation leads
  to increased expression of IκBα, with newly synthesized IκBα then binding to NF-κB
  and suppressing further activation of this pathway. (B) Ethanol delivered via the
  intragastric (i.g.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) routes is believed to activate the
  TLR4 signaling pathway. Ethanol’s actions on opioid peptides and damage-associated
  molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) are considered likely mechanisms by which ethanol
  would stimulate TLR4s. (C) In the case of i.g. administered ethanol, another possible
  mechanism leading to TLR4 activation is via bacterial translocation in the gut.
  Under normal healthy conditions, mucosal membranes of the gastrointestinal tract
  create a physical barrier that contains bacteria within the gut and intestines.
  Other physiological processes also keep bacteria within the GI tract at bay. Ethanol
  has been shown to impair these defense mechanisms, with ethanol promoting bacterial
  growth/accumulation within the gut and increasing intestinal permeability. The latter
  of these ethanol effects may then allow bacteria to “leak” from the gut to the liver
  and general circulation, thereby activating the TLR4 pathway.
