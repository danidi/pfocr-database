caption: Model demonstrating role of p50 in the ATR-mediated response to RS. In this
  model, RS-induced ATR signaling leads to phosphorylation of nuclear p50 resulting
  in promoter-specific modulation of NF-κB (p50/p65) binding. This pathway, activated
  in parallel to the ATR-mediated checkpoint response, leads to attenuation of anti-apoptotic
  Bclxl expression. ATR signaling also modulates NF-κB activity by inhibiting the
  IκK complex and by inducing phosphorylation of p65. Together, the NF-κB-dependent
  response to ATR promotes cell death. Loss of p50 signaling leads to an elevation
  in the threshold for cell death resulting in survival of cells harboring higher
  levels of DNA strand breaks.
