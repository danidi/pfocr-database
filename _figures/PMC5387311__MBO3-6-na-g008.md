caption: Model of VapA action on the late endocytic pathway. (a) In normal cells,
  late endosomes and/or autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form an endolysosome
  (EL) or an autolysosome (AL). The material delivered to the lysosome is then digested
  and the lysosome re‐forms from the EL/AL compartment. (b) VapA reduces the hydrolase
  activity in the EL/AL and material delivered to the lysosome accumulates. Lysosomes
  cannot be re‐formed from the perturbed EL/AL causing a loss of lysosomes. The lack
  of functional lysosomes is sensed by the cell and transcription factor EB (TFEB)
  signaling promotes lysosome biogenesis
