caption: ( A) Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin-13 (IL-13)
  are the primary cytokines responsible for fibrosis induced by schistosome infection
  by activation of SMAD pathway. In hepatic stellate cells, miR-21, induced by TGF-β1
  and IL-13, prompted TGF-β1/SMAD and IL-13/SMAD signaling to induce fibrogenic effects
  by relieving the inhibitory effect of SMAD7 in the SMAD pathway. MiR-351 was negatively
  regulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) via activation of the STAT1 pathway and promoted
  fibrogenesis by targeting vitamin D receptor (VDR), a newly identified negative
  regulator of the SMAD pathway. Moreover, infection-induced downregulation of miR-203
  expression resulted in hepatic fibrosis by relieving the inhibition of IL-33, which
  elevated the expression of IL-13. ( B) In hepatic macrophages, various T helper
  2 (Th2) cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10, promoted the transcription of
  miR-146b by activating STAT3/6, and elevated miR-146b inhibited the IFN-γ–induced
  differentiation of macrophages into M1 cells by targeting STAT1. iNOS, inducible
  nitric oxide synthase.
