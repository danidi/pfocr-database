caption: A schematic representation of the impact of agmatine on the molecular and
  metabolic pathways. The current findings indicate that AGM elevates the synthesis
  and levels of cAMP () and subsequently may activate the cAMP-PKA pathway. The latter
  initiates a molecular and metabolic chain reaction including phosphorylation and
  activation of CREB, PGC1α, and PPARα. The up-regulation of PPARα resulted in activation
  of downstream target genes responsible for Car synthesis and transport ( and ) and
  hence augmented the synthesis of Car and its level in plasma () and tissues ().
  The increased synthesis of Car together with increased expression of CREB and PGC1α
  led to increased β-oxidation () and increased fluxes through pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH), pyruvate carboxylase (PC), the TCA cycle, and gluconeogenesis but decreased
  glycolysis (). Simultaneously, the up-regulation of UCPs () is expected to elevate
  the metabolic rate. The latter, when coupled with elevated expression of PPARγ in
  adipose tissue (), resulted in higher fat oxidation as well as decreased fat mass
  ( and ), decreased body weight gain (), and thereby improved insulin sensitivity
  (). In addition, the products of β-oxidation, such as acetyl-CoA together with the
  augmented cataplerosis and generation of glutamate through the TCA cycle, resulted
  in augmented synthesis of NAG, stimulation of ureagenesis, and removal of waste
  nitrogen from the body (). These coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolic
  pathways and thereby the AGM-induced metabolic reprogramming suggest that AGM may
  lessen the so-called metabolic syndrome, i.e. the metabolic malfunctions associated
  with HFD-induced obesity. ↑ indicates stimulation or improvement, and ↓ indicates
  decrease.
