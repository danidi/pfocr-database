caption: Model for p53 pathway repression by E/R. E/R inhibits p53 by upregulating
  MDM2 expression, a process that can be reversed by suppressing E/R with short hairpin
  RNA. Coexisting deletions of CDKN2A, which encodes the MDM2 inhibitor p14ARF, can
  further consolidate MDM2 expression and the ensuing effects on p53. Disrupting this
  inappropriate MDM2/p53 interaction with the small molecule inhibitor Nutlin-3 restores
  p53 function leading to upregulation of p21, BAX and PUMA and consequently arrests
  the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in E/R-positive cells.
