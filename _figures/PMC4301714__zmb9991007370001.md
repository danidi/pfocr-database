caption: (A) A simplified model of the Rag4-KlRgt1 glucose signaling pathway controlling
  RAG1 gene expression in Kluyveromyces lactis. The level of RAG1 transcription (Tx)
  depends on the quantity of extracellular glucose (high glucose = high transcription;
  no glucose = low transcription). The molecular mechanisms represented are detailed
  in the introduction. The dashed arrow represents the positive regulation by glycolysis
  on RAG1 expression that is analyzed in this study. The glucose-induced degradation
  of Sms1 was positioned between the nucleus and the cytoplasm because the localization
  of this process is uncertain. The nuclear envelope is shown as a dashed line. Phosphorylation
  (P) of Sms1 and Sck1 by Rag8 and KlRgt1 by an unknown kinase (kinase X) are presented.
  PM, plasma membrane; Cyt, cytosol; Nuc, nucleus; Tx, transcription; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate.
  (B) Table summarizing the functional conservation of the main factors of glucose
  signaling between K. lactis and S. cerevisiae. The molecular mechanisms of signal
  transduction of the two yeast species are similar. The function of each protein
  is indicated. A role for Tye7 and Snf2 in S. cerevisiae glucose signaling has not
  yet been reported. Tx, transcription.
