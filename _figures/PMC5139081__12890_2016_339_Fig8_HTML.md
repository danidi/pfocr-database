caption: CF airway epithelium and pathogen adaptation. Defective CFTR leads to decreased
  airway surface liquid (ASL) layer. This facilitates microbial colonization and airway
  inflammation. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) signaling to activate Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and therefore to recruit
  polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). The increasing PMNs result in oxidative stress
  within the airways by forming reactive oxygen species (ROS). The increased oxidative
  stress further activates the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, activating
  IL-8 and thus recruiting more PMNs. Mutated CFTR in the epithelial cells is unable
  to channel the antioxidants Glutathione (GSH) and thiocyanate (SCN−) into the airway,
  limiting their ability to counteract the oxidative stress. TLR expression and signaling
  is also altered in CF epithelium. Expression of TLR2 and TLR5 at the apical surface
  is increased, whereas TLR4 expression is limited to endosome (not shown here). NF-κB
  in CF airway epithelial cells is constitutively activated, resulting in the production
  of inflammatory cytokines including IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating
  factor (GM-CSF). This also leads to recruitment of PMNs independent of TLR’s interaction
  with the adaptor protein MyD88. Bacterial PAMPs further increase NF-κB signaling
  through activation of TLR-MyD88 signaling. The inhaled bacteria start interacting
  and aggregating to form biofilms. P. aeruginosa also releases outer membrane vesicles
  containing CF inhibitory factor (Cif), a protein that further inhibits the recycling
  of CFTR in the host further contributing to the cycle of hyper-inflammation and
  bacterial colonization
