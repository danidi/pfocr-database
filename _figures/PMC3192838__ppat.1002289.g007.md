caption: Soon after infection, the HCV RNA is detected by the dsRNA binding domains
  (DRBD) of PKR ahead (2 hr) of its recognition by the RNA helicase RIG-I (6 hr).
  Recruitment of PKR by HCV triggers a signaling pathway that involves PKR as an adapter
  protein to recruit MAVS and TRAF3. This leads to a strong induction of the di-ubiquitine
  like protein ISG15 as well as other IRF3-dependent ISGs (Interferon-Stimulated Genes).
  ISG15 negatively controls the TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination (Ub) of RIG-I through
  an ISGylation process and thus interferes with the ability of RIG-I to recruit its
  downstream partners, including MAVS and TRAF3, and to induce IFNβ and ISGs. As the
  infection proceeds, HCV activates the eIF2α kinase function of PKR (12 hr). This
  leads to a transient (few hours) inhibition of general translation, including that
  of IFN  and ISGs  while the eIF2α-independent translation of the viral proteins
  proceeds unabated. At later times in the infection (18 hr), additional control of
  IFN induction occurs through cleavage of MAVS by the HCV NS3/4A protease, once the
  viral proteins have sufficiently accumulated in the cytosol , .
