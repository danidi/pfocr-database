caption: Bile salt synthetic pathways. The enzymatic pathways involved in bile salt
  synthesis have so far been elucidated only in humans and rodents. The pathway shown
  is the 'neutral' pathway, as opposed to the 'acidic' pathway that modifies the side-chain
  before the steroid nucleus [,]. The ultimate production of the default C24 bile
  acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) requires multiple changes to the original cholesterol
  structure including 7α-hydroxylation, isomerization of the C-5 - C-6 double bond
  (from cholesterol) to form a Δ4 compound coupled with oxidation of the 3β-hydroxy
  group to a 3-oxo group, stereospecific reduction of the 3-oxo group to a 3α-hydroxy
  group, hydroxylation of the terminal carbon atom of the side-chain, oxidation of
  the side-chain (to form a C27 bile acid), and shortening of the side-chain. Animals
  using C27 bile alcohols or C27 bile acids as their primary bile salts presumably
  require fewer enzymatic steps than those synthesizing C24 bile acids. The enzymes
  involved in 5α-reduction leading to 5α-bile salts are currently unknown. The stem
  C27 5β-bile alcohol would be 3α,7α,27-trihydroxy-5β-cholestan, while the stem C27
  5β-bile acid would be 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestan-27-oic acid. Note that some steps
  in the pathway require more than one enzyme (e.g., isomerization of the 3β-hydroxy
  group of cholesterol to the 3α configuration), whereas some enzymes (e.g., CYP27A1)
  can catalyze more than one reaction. Double bonds or additional hydroxyl groups
  may be added to the nucleus or side-chain, either on an intermediate or on the completed
  stem bile alcohol or acid.
