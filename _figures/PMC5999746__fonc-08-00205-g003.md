caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produce oxidative stress which in return converts
  the normal epithelium to early adenoma which leads to the next stage that is intermediate
  adenoma by the activation of EGFR signaling. Tumor growth factor-β inactivation
  further leads to the late adenoma. Due to loss of p53 function late adenoma is converted
  into colorectal carcinoma. P53 is a gene that inhibits the mutagenesis. Due to their
  lost function, the chance of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased. EGFR signaling
  activation stimulates the Grb2/SOS protein which further activates the Ras, Raf,
  and MEK pathways. It further stimulates the two pathways. In first pathway, MEK
  activates the c-Myc gene which upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), causing
  metastasis. In second pathway, Ras–Raf–MEK pathway activates MAPK/P3 which in turn
  upregulates FOS protein, also causes MMP-7-dependent metastasis. AGE-RAGE complex
  activates NF-κB which in turn also activates FOS protein-mediated MMP-7 upregulation.
  Decreased antioxidants and increased TNF-α result in enhanced ROS production which
  not only activates MAPK/P3 but also increases in prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) by stimulating
  cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX2). ROS attack PGE-2 in cell membrane to produce isoprostanes,
  which again increase FOS resulting in MMP-7 production leading to metastasis of
  CRC.
