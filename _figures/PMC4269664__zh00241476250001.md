caption: 'Functional implications of Bifidobacterium in probiotic therapy for diarrhea.
  A: downregulated in adenoma (DRA), located on the apical membrane of intestinal
  epithelial cells. Bifidobacterium promotes reabsorption of Cl−. Diarrhea may occur
  due to malfunction/underexpression/mutation of DRA, leading to water and electrolyte
  imbalance. IBD, inflammatory bowel disease. B: treatment in vitro with culture supernatant
  (CS) of Bifidobacterium species or in vivo with live Bifidobacterium species enhances
  expression of DRA by an ERK-mediated signaling pathway, which may restore ion-water
  balance in the intestinal lumen. Molecules in CS causing the effect require further
  study.'
