caption: Model for Wnt signaling in the early C. elegans embryo. The Wnt pathway in
  the early C. elegans embryo (B) is contrasted to the ‘canonical’ pathway derived
  from experimental data from other organisms (A; see ). In this diagram, the signaling
  cell is drawn above the responding cell. As shown in B, Wnt signaling is required
  for both EMS mitotic spindle orientation (left) and endoderm specification (right),
  although there may be separate signaling ligands for these two processes (; ; A.
  Schlesinger et al., unpubl.). gsk-3 may represent a branchpoint in the EMS Wnt pathway,
  regulating both endoderm induction and mitotic spindle orientation. Not depicted
  but also possible are arrows from gsk-3 directly to the EMS spindle, and directly
  to the cytoskeleton during endoderm induction. In contrast to the roles of pan and
  LEF-1, which are converted into activators by Wnt signaling, pop-1 acts purely as
  a repressor in the C. elegans pathway (). Release from POP-1-mediated repression
  of endoderm occurs not in EMS but in its posterior daughter, E.
