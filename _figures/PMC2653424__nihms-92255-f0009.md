caption: A model of the effects of growth factor receptors and downstream signal transducers
  on SMRT and N-CoR function is shown. The EGF receptor (EGFR) or anisomycin activates
  MEKK1 signaling, which, in turn, strongly inhibits SMRT function by causing release
  of SMRT from its nuclear receptor partners and export out of the nucleus. MEK1,
  activated by MEKK1, also has strong inhibitory effects on SMRT function (solid arrows).
  The EGF receptor exerts an additional, weaker inhibitory effect on SMRT through
  a second, poorly understood pathway (dashed arrows); N-CoR appears to be subject
  only to this secondary pathway.
