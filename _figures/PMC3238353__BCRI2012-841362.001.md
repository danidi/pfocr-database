caption: ER stress and activation of the UPR signalling pathways. Accumulation of
  misfolded or unfolded protein aggregates in the ER lumen, a condition known as ER
  stress, leads to activation of three ER transmembrane proteins, PERK, IRE1, and
  ATF6. GRP78, a ubiquitous ER chaperone that is normally bound to these ER stress
  sensors and keeps them inactive, dissociates from them in order to assist with the
  folding of proteins in the ER lumen. However, this dissociation leads to activation
  of the 3 UPR pathways. (1) PERK homodimerization and autophosphorylation results
  in the subsequent phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 which by inhibiting global
  protein synthesis reduces the ER protein load. ATF4 expression, however, increases
  upon eIF2α phosphorylation which translocates to the nucleus allowing for transcription
  of UPR target genes by binding to the UPR response element (UPRE). These genes include
  CHOP, a proapoptotic transcription factor that results in cell death if ER stress
  conditions persist, and GADD34, which acts as a negative regulator of the PERK pathway
  by dephosphorylating eIF2α. (2) IRE1 is activated in a similar manner to PERK by
  homodimerization and autophosphorylation. Additionally, interaction of misfolded
  or unfolded proteins with the luminal domain of IRE1 can also further promote its
  activation. XBP1 mRNA is an IRE1 substrate that undergoes splicing to produce XBP1s,
  encoding a transcription factor that can lead to upregulation of ER chaperones and
  other UPR target genes. (3) ATF6 activation leads to its translocation to the Golgi
  where it is sequentially cleaved by site 1 and site 2 proteases. This leads to the
  release of the N-terminal ATF6 fragment which translocates to the nucleus, binds
  to the ER stress response element (ERSE) thereby activating UPR target genes.
