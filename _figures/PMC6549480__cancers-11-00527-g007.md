caption: A schematic molecular model for PSMD3 in the stabilization of HER2. USP14
  is a DUB enzyme that trims ubiquitin (Ub) from substrates. PSMD3 interacts with
  HER2, which maintains HER2 and HER2 signaling pathways. Loss of PSMD3 function led
  to destabilization of HER2 and enhanced ubiquitination and association with decreased
  HER2 level and lysosomal degradation pathway. The major HER2 signaling pathways
  (AKT and ERK) were inhibited, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and
  the induction of cellular apoptosis.
