caption: 'Lifespan extension via germline removal, for example by mutation of glp-1/Notch,
  depends on at least four signaling mechanisms: reduced TOR signaling (likely to
  regulate autophagy), DAF-16/FOXO regulation, increased steroid signaling via the
  DAF-36/DAF-9/DAF-12 pathway (which regulates various genes), and increased NHR-80/HNF-4
  signaling (which enhances fatty-acid desaturation). Of these mechanisms, the most-studied
  mechanism is DAF-16/FOXO regulation. Germline-less animals require specific cofactors
  (not required in daf-2/InR mutants) for activation of DAF-16/FOXO in the nucleus
  of intestinal cells. DAF-12/FXR, TCER-1/TCERG1, KRI-1/KRIT-1 and PHI-62 all function
  specifically in germline-less animals, whereas DAF-18/PTEN, SMK-1/SMEK and HSF-1
  are common between the insulin/IGF-1 and germline signaling pathways. Cell-nonautonomous
  regulation of DAF-16/FOXO is also mediated through a microRNA, mir-71, which is
  produced in neurons.Factors with longevity-promoting effects are in green and those
  with lifespan-limiting effects are in red. TOR effects are listed in grey to indicate
  that these links are presently inferred. Transcription factors are in boxes. See
  text for details.'
