caption: A, The pathway for the enzymatic formation of Q6 in yeast, starting with
  4-hydroxybenzoic acid as the ring precursor. Questions marks indicate unknown steps
  involved in the decarboxylation and hydroxylation of the intermediate(s) leading
  to reduced coenzyme Q6H2. B, The schematic of a high-molecular mass complex in yeast,
  termed the CoQ synthome. Coq1, Coq2, and Coq10 polypeptides are not observed as
  members of the high-molecular mass complex. Coq1 and Coq2 produce HHB (designated
  by the dark gray hexagon). This early CoQ-intermediate is converted by subsequent
  action of Coq6 and other Coq polypeptides to an essential lipid component of the
  CoQ synthome (shown as a light gray hexagon in association with Coq4). Coq8 physically
  associates with Coq6 and is an ancient atypical kinase, thought to be responsible
  for the regulatory phosphorylation of Coq3, Coq5 and Coq7 and/or ATPase activity.
  Q6, the product of the CoQ synthome, is designated by the orange hexagon.
