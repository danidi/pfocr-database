caption: Molecular mechanism underlying cardiovascular diseases associated with the
  changing of intracellular Ca2+ through TRPCs. GPCRs, releasing DAG and IP3 via PIP2
  with the subsequent activation of PLC, were stimulated by Ang II and PE, which were
  hypertrophic stimuli. DAG stimulated ROCs, including TRPC3 and TRPC6, resulting
  in extracellular Ca2+ influx. IP3 activated SOCE in response to depletion of intracellular
  Ca2+ stores by Ca2+ release in the SR/ER and subsequently activated TRPCs. The sustained
  TRPC-mediated Ca2+ entry directly activated the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, subsequently
  resulting in the activation of hypertrophic gene expression, including TRPC1, TRPC3
  and TRPC6. Simultaneously, after activating, NFAT might activate TRPC gene expression
  through a positive feedback mechanism. TRPCs interacted with the LTCC through membrane
  depolarization, playing a role in regulation of cardiac pacemaking, conduction,
  ventricular activity, and contractility. Mechanical stretch caused arrhythmia through
  the activation of SACs to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Fibroblast regulated by
  Ca2+-permeable TRPCs might be associated with AF, and fibroblast proliferation and
  differentiation are a central feature in AF-promoting remodeling. TRPCs maintained
  adherens junction plasticity and enabled EC-barrier destabilization by suppressing
  SPHK1 expression to induce endothelial hyperpermeability, leading to atherosclerosis.
  In addition, the omission of extracellular Ca2+ with channel blockers (SKF96365,
  Pyr3) reduced monocyte adhesion and ATP-induced VCAM-1 and also relieved the progress
  of atherosclerosis. The rise of cytosolic [Ca2+]i promoted SMC proliferation. TRPC
  channels associated with vascular remodeling caused hyperplasia of SMCs. Moreover,
  TRPCs participated in blood pressure regulation due to receptor-mediated and pressure-induced
  changes in VSMC cytosolic Ca2+. Signaling via cGKI in vascular smooth muscle, by
  which endothelial NO regulated vascular tone, caused VSMC contraction. Activated
  TRPCs can activate downstream effectors and CREB proteins that have many physiological
  functions; TRPCs activated in neurons are linked to numerous stimuli, including
  growth factors, hormones, and neuronal activity through the Ras/MEK/ERK and CaM/CaMKIV
  pathways. GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptor; Ang II, Angiotensin II; PE, phenylephrine;
  ROCs, receptor-operated channels; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; LTCC, L-type
  voltage-gated calcium channel; SACs, stretch-activated ion channels; AF, atrial
