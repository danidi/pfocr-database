caption: '(A) Genetic organization of the gene loci involved in de novo synthesis
  and utilization of bacterial sialic acids. neuB that encodes sialic acid synthetase
  is highlighted in golden-yellow. S. suis is indicated in red. The abbreviations
  are as follows: N. meningitidis for Neisseria meningitidis; C. jejuni for Campylobacter
  jejuni; E. coli for Escherichia coli; S. agalactiae for Streptococcus agalactiae;
  S. suis for Streptococcus suis and V. parahaemolyticus for Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
  (B) Working model for the biosynthetic route and metabolism of bacterial sialic
  acids. NeuB, sialic acid synthase is shown in golden-yellow, and NeuNAc (also abbreviated
  as Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid), a prevalent form of sialic acids is indicated
  in blue. NeuA terms as sialic acid O-acetylesterase, NeuC refers to UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase,
  NeuD is defined as sialic acid O-acetyltransferase and CpsK is an oligosaccharide
  α-2,3-sialyltransferase. All other abbreviations are listed as follows: ManNAc,
  N-acetylmannosamine; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; UDP- GlcNAc, Uridine diphosphate
  N-acetylglucosamine; Neu5,7(9)Ac2, N-acetyl-7 or 9-O-acetylneuraminic acid; CMP-Neu5,7(9)Ac2,
  CMP-Neu5Ac, Cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid; Cytidine monophosphate
  N-acetyl-7 or 9-O-acetylneuraminic acid; CPS, Capsule polysaccharide. (C) Chemical
  structures of NeuNAc, the leading type of sialic acids in two existing states.'
