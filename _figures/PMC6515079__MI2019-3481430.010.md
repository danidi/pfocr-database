caption: Network analysis of proteome datasets in M2 polarized (vs. M0) Mφ. Integrated
  nuclear proteome of M2 (vs. M0) Mφ was developed as described in Materials and Methods.
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the differential proteome datasets presented  Table
  was performed to develop the networks. Shown are changes in abundance (a), RoR values
  (b), and phosphorylation (c) of protein spots linked to disease and function networks
  in M2 vs. M0 Mφ. In the networks, the intensity of pink/red and green colors shows
  the extent of increase and decrease in protein abundance, RoR values, or phosphorylation
  levels, respectively, in M1 (vs. M0) Mφ. Brownish orange node/lines and blue node/lines
  show predicted activation and inhibition, respectively, of a pathway. Gray and yellow
  lines are used when putative effect is not completely understood. Note that several
  molecules that are predicted to be associated with increase in transcription/protein
  and lipid synthesis and cell proliferation and survival were changed in abundance
  as well as S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation levels in M2 (vs. M0) Mφ.
