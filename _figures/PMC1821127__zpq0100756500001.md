caption: Dauer and germ-line longevity pathways. Δ4-dafachronic acid inhibits longevity
  in the dauer pathways but promotes it in the germ-line longevity pathway, showing
  a dependence on signaling context. Germ-line signaling is DAF-16/FOXO-dependent,
  whereas dauer signaling can be rendered DAF-16/FOXO-independent. Both contexts require
  DAF-12/nuclear hormone receptor. (A) Dauer longevity. Liganded DAF-12 promotes reproductive
  development and short life, whereas unliganded DAF-12 together with corepressor
  DIN-1 promote stress resistance and longevity. (B) Germ-line longevity. In the absence
  of signals from the germ line, liganded DAF-12, together with nuclear localized
  DAF-16/FOXO, promote longevity.
