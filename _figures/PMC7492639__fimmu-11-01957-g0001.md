caption: Ozone-mediated effects on intracellular pathways involved in cell injury
  and inflammation. Overview of the effects of ozone in in vitro and in vivo models.
  The biphasic response to ozone starts with an immediate intracellular reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and inflammation independent phase that is induced by extracellular
  oxidative stress. ROS induces membrane damage with changes in cell membrane integrity,
  disruption of tight junctions, epithelial cell stress, and death. Inflammatory mediators
  including IL-25 and IL-33 are released and attract innate immune cells such as natural
  killer (NK) cells and innate lymphoid type 2 (ILC2) cells. Cell death and release
  of dsDNA can induce an interferon (IFN) inflammation response via the cGAS/STING
  pathway. Processes activated during the intracellular ROS and inflammation-dependent
  phase of the effects of ozone include transcription factor-mediated inflammatory
  response and the activation of the antioxidant defense mechanism. Several inhibitors
  have been shown to prevent or treat the pro-inflammatory gene expression and subsequently
  inhibit the inflammatory response, including the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, and the
  p38 MAPK inhibitor, SD282. In addition, activation of the endogenous antioxidant
  defense system involving HADC2, Keap1, and Nrf2 may be sufficient to counteract
  the oxidant stress during acute ozone exposure but may be overwhelmed during chronic
  ozone exposure. Treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) also reduces
  the inflammatory response, by scavenging of intracellular ROS with subsequent reduction
  of cytokine and chemokine production. Mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial
  dysfunction contribute to apoptotic processes and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  further enhancing the inflammatory response. Several treatment strategies targeting
  the mitochondria have been able to reduce or prevent the mitochondrial oxidative-induced
  dysfunction. These include several mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants such as MitoQ,
  MitoTEMPO, and SS-31. In addition, stem cell therapy with induced pluripotent stem
  cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPSC-MSCs) prevented ozone-induced mitochondrial
  dysfunction and inflammation which may result from direct interaction and mitochondrial
  transfer between the iPSC-MSCs and airway cells. Treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor
  VX765 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) prevent the activation of the inflammasome and
  reduces inflammation and mitochondrial oxidative stress. The MIF inhibitor ISO-1
  blocks the ozone exposure induced inflammation and airway hyperreactivity and might
  have an impact on the corticosteroid insensitivity present in chronic ozone exposed
  lungs. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation induced by acute ozone exposures but
  fail to affect these processes in the steroid insensitive chronic ozone exposed
  lung. The ozone exposure driven intracellular processes contribute to the inflammatory
  cytokine and chemokine production, immune cell recruitment, and eventually the development
  of airway hyperreactivity, airway obstruction, airway remodeling, emphysema, autoimmunity,
  and steroid insensitivity which are hallmarks of COPD. cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase;
