caption: 'Green arrows indicate findings published in the literature. Red arrows signify
  potential pathways. Mice on a diet-induced obesity (DIO) protocol have ad libitum
  access to a high-fat diet (HFD). These mice have changes in the gut microbiome,
  stool metabolomics, and hepatic gene expression. There are presumed changes in gut
  signaling, particularly in the bile acid signaling pathway. As a result, these mice
  are particularly predisposed to obesity and dysmetabolism. With TRF, cyclical fluctuation
  is restored in the gut microflora, luminal metabolites, and hepatic gene expression.
  Presumably TRF also restores oscillations in gut signaling. As a result, TRF protects
  against obesity and dysmetabolism. Abbreviations: CYP7A1, cytochrome P450 7A1; FGF15,
  fibroblast growth factor 15; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; LIPC, hepatic lipase.'
