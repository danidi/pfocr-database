caption: The crocin biosynthetic pathways in C. sativus and G. jasminoides. The precursors
  of carotenoids are generated via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway.
  The enzymes marked in green are known enzymes from the upstream carotenoid biosynthetic
  pathway, and those in red and purple are identified from C. sativus and G. jasminoides,
  respectively. GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; PSY, phytoene synthase;
  PDS, phytoene desaturase; Z-ISO, ζ-carotene isomerase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase;
  CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase; LCYB, lycopene β-cyclase; BHY, β-carotene hydrolase;
  CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; UGT, UDP-glucosyltransferase.
