caption: Motor axons release Agrin and ACh. Agrin binds to Lrp4, which stimulates
  association between Lrp4 and MuSK and MuSK phosphorylation. Once phosphorylated
  in the juxtamembrane region, MuSK recruits Dok-7, which forms a dimer and stabilizes
  a dimer of MuSK. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-7 stimulates recruitment of Crk/Crk-L,
  which activates a poorly understood signaling pathway that leads to the anchoring
  of Rapsyn and AChRs at sites where MuSK is activated.
