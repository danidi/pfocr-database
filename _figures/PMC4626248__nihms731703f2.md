caption: 'An integrated view of receptor-initiated nuclear Ca2+ signals in cardiomyocyte.
  Different agonists can activate receptors located in the sarcolemma (1 and 3) or
  intracellular receptors (2). Pathway 1: Perinuclear receptors located in deep T-tubules
  can lead to PLC-dependent InsP3 generation in peri/nuclear compartments. Pathway
  2: Intracellular receptors can be activated by lipophilic ligands (steroid hormones)
  or endocytosed ligands, leading to PLC-dependent InsP3 generation in peri/nuclear
  compartments. Pathway 3: Receptors located in peripheral sarcolemma lead to generation
  of InsP3 and its diffusion into the nucleus triggers nuclear Ca2+ signals.'
