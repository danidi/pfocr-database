caption: Proposed model of CpdA attenuation of PTX resistance with TLR-4-mediated
  IL-6, IL-8 and XIAP. TLR4 expressing BCA cells were activated by PTX during PTX
  administration aiming to kill cancer cells, to release pro-inflammatory cytokines
  IL-8 and IL-6 into the tumor microenvironment. The mechanism is a TLR-4 and NF-κB
  dependent pathway. TLR4 is the other target of this activated pathway. The PTX-TLR4
  mediated effect can aggravate cancer progression including metastasis, PTX resistance
  and angiogenesis. This phenomenon can be targeted by a NF-κB specific inhibitor,
  CpdA, leading to the attenuation of TLR-4-mediated PTX resistance
