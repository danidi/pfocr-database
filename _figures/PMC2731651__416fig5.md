caption: Interactions at growth cones. Binding of WRK-1 and Eph/VAB-1 in trans prevents
  midline crossing. VAB-1 also interacts with SAX-3 in cis. Growth cone retraction
  requires termination of contact between Eph- and ephrin-expressing cells. This is
  achieved by cleavage of ephrin ectodomain by ADAM10 in trans and/or endocytosis
  of Eph/ephrin complexes, followed by processing of the ectodomain in the endosomal/lyzosomal
  pathway. Subsequent to ectodomain shedding, processed ephrins are targets for PS
  cleavage that releases the ICD in the cytosol.
