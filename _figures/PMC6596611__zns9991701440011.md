caption: Summarized schematic model. GSNOR expression increased in aging mouse hippocampus.
  TG mice overexpressing GSNOR exclusively in neurons (GNSOR TG mice) had cognitive
  impairment, LTP impairment, and lower dendrite spine. GSNOR KO mice rescued age-related
  cognitive impairment. GSNOR induced cognitive impairment by downregulated S-nitrosated
  CaMKIIα, inhibited CaMKIIα synaptosomal accumulation, and downregulated p(S831)-GLUR1.
  Supplement of the NO signaling pathway rescued GSNOR TG mouse cognitive impairment.
