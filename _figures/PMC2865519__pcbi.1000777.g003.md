caption: The figure shows the consensus tree of breast cancer subgroups. We use expression
  data of 483 breast cancer samples subdivided as shown in . The tree is rooted with
  expression data of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We also include expression
  data of fully differentiated normal breast tissue. The differentiation pathway from
  hESC to fully differentiated breast tissue is indicated in purple, and the pink
  dots represent the common ancestors of (sets of) subgroups. The boxed numbers specify
  the bootstrap values of branches. The phylogeny ranks the breast cancer subtypes
  according to their dissimilarity from stem cells as ER− grade 3, ER− grade 2, ER+
  grade 3, followed by ER− grade 1, ER+ grade 2 and ER+ grade 1.
