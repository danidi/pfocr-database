caption: APP-Go signaling can regulate alternative downstream pathways in a context-dependent
  manner. (A) APP is inserted into the plasma membrane of neurons as a type-1 transmembrane
  protein that directly interacts with the heterotrimeric G protein Go; the major
  fraction of the holoprotein spontaneously forms homodimers under unstimulated conditions.
  Interactions with sAPPα ectodomain fragments (generated by α-secretase processing)
  promotes the dissociation of homodimeric APP and activates Gαo, stimulating the
  exchange of bound GDP for GTP on the Gαo subunit and its dissociation from the Gβγ
  dimer (similar to signaling by conventional GPCRs; ). Both activated Gαo and Gβγ
  may stimulate PI3K, which then phosphorylates and activates Akt. In turn, Akt phosphorylates
  and inhibits downstream targets linked with apoptotic responses and Tau hyperphosphorylation,
  including GSK3β and components of the stress kinase pathway that regulate JNK (;
  ). In this manner, stimulation of the APP-Gαo pathway by sAPPα promotes neuroprotective
  responses by modulating neuronal stress signaling, providing a mechanism for integrating
  the stress and survival responses regulated by APP and its cleaved sAPPα ectodomain
  fragments (; ). (B) In the developing nervous system of Manduca, migratory neurons
  co-express insect APP (APPL) and Gαo in their leading processes (; ), while their
  ensheathing glial cells express a single Contactin ortholog (MsContactin). Embryo
  culture assays have shown that glial Contactin stimulates APP-Go signaling in the
  migratory neurons, whereby Gαo-dependent induction of Ca2+ currents (and possibly
  other effectors regulated by via Gβγ) induces local retraction responses that prevent
  ectopic migration and outgrowth (; ). (C) Membrane-tethered AICDs and APP-CTFs can
  also interact with Gαs to stimulate neuronal motility and outgrowth, via a pathway
  that involves the activation of adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling, accompanied
  by the phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK3β (, ). Stimulation of APP signaling
  by different combinations of ligands and co-receptors might preferentially activate
  Gαo- or Gαs- associated responses in a context-dependent manner, whereby APP-G protein
  signaling can either promote or inhibit neuronal motility at specific stages and
  locations in the nervous system.
