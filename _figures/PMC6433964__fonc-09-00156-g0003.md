caption: 'Repair pathways and signaling in response to DSB induction by IR. After
  DSB induction, the Ku70/80 heterodimer complex (Ku) rapidly binds to all DSB ends.
  Ku bound to DSB ends plays the following roles: 1) Ku70/80 complex promotes NHEJ
  and 2) Ku70/80 complex protects DNA ends from unscheduled digestion by DNA nucleases.
  In the NHEJ pathway, DSBs are rapidly rejoined by DNA-PKcs and XLF/XRCC4/LIG4 following
  Ku binding to DSB ends (). On the other hand, DSB ends are digested in the 5′ to
  3′ direction by EXO1 to direct repair pathway toward HR. The resected ssDNA is coated
  with RPA. BRCA2 promotes the protein switch from RPA to RAD51, facilitating strand
  invasion into the template strand for recombination-mediated repair. In terms of
  DNA damage signaling, ATM, which serves as a sensor of DSBs, is the major DNA damage
  response (DDR) kinase and is activated at unresected DSB ends. At DSB ends during
  HR, resection promotes a switch from ATM to ATR activation, followed by Chk1 activation.
  In the context of DNA damage-dependent PD-L1 expression, the activation of Chk1
  is a critical step leading to STAT/IRF-mediated PD-L1 upregulation.'
