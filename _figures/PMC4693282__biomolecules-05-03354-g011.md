caption: Hypothetical model for posttranscriptional iron regulation mediated by RNA-protein
  interactions in T. vaginalis using the tvcp4 gene as a model. (a) Under iron-rich
  condition no RPC formation is observed due to that TvACTN3 and TvACT interact showing
  their typical functions as cytoskeleton proteins and TvHSP70 is degraded possible
  through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; thus, the tvcp4 mRNA is translated; (b)
  Under iron-depleted conditions, TvACTN3 and TvACT do not interact, TvHSP70 is stable
  and all proteins moonlight by acquiring a new function as RNA-binding proteins that
  interact with IRE-like tvcp4 hairpin structure and blocking translation of tvcp4
  mRNA.
