caption: The RAS/MAP (mitogen‐activated protein) kinase signalling pathway. (A) Binding
  of growth factors (GF) to the receptor stimulates binding of adaptor proteins including
  SHP2 and SOS1. This in turn activates RAS (HRAS and KRAS are active in different
  tissues) by displacing bound GDP with GTP. GTP‐bound RAS activates BRAF which activates
  MEK1/MEK2 via a cascade of phosphorylation, ultimately leading to activation of
  multiple transcription factors in the nucleus. Activity of RAS is limited by the
  hydrolysis of GTP back to GDP which is regulated by neurofibromin. (B,C) Characteristic
  facial features in children with Noonan's syndrome (B) and cardio‐facio‐cutaneous
  (CFC) syndrome (C). Parental/guardian informed consent was obtained for the publication
  of these figures.
