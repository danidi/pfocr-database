caption: Functional β-cells respond to increasing glucose levels by increasing insulin
  secretion. In glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), glucose is transported
  into the cell via glucose transporters [e.g. Glut1 (Slc2a1) or Glut2 (Slc2a2), pink],
  where it is phosphorylated by glucokinase (GCK) and converted into ATP by subsequent
  metabolic reactions. Rising ATP levels (e.g. rising ATP:ADP ratios) trigger the
  closure of potassium channels [Sur1 (Abcc8) and Kir6.2 (Kcnj11) subunits], membrane
  depolarization, and the opening of calcium channels (blue). The resultant rise in
  intracellular calcium levels triggers the exocytosis of insulin-containing granules
  and hence leads to increased insulin levels in adjacent blood vessels. Human genetic
  studies of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) patients have identified
  a number of mutations that trigger diabetes, including those in genes encoding transcription
  factors (depicted in the nucleus) and components of the GSIS pathway indicated in
  this figure.
