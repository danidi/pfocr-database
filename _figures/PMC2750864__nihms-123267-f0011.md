caption: A third possible mechanism that accounts for formation of the minor diastereomer
  with deuterium migration and also for formation of regioisomer 30 (deuterated at
  C1′) is shown in . Treatment of 31 with a Pd(0) catalyst, an aryl bromide, and NaOtBu
  could afford palladium(aryl)(alkoxide) complex 39. Syn-insertion of the alkene into
  the Pd-O bond would provide 40,, which could undergo C-C bond-forming reductive
  elimination to produce the observed major diastereomer with the deuterium label
  at C1′ (32). Alternatively, rotation about the C2-C1′ sigma bond of 40 followed
  by syn-β-hydride elimination (via conformer 40′) would provide palladium(aryl)(hydride)(alkene)
  complex 41. Reinsertion of the alkene into the Pd-H bond with opposite regiochemistry
  would give 42, which could then undergo another C2-C1′ sigma bond rotation and syn-β-deuteride
  elimination (via conformer 42′) to give 43. Reinsertion of the alkene into the Pd-D
  bond with reversed regiochemistry would provide 44, which could undergo C-C bond-forming
  reductive elimination to produce the observed minor diastereomer with the deuterium
  label at C2 (33). Alternatively, intermediate 42 could undergo syn-elimination of
  the C-3 β-hydrogen followed by regiochemically reversed reinsertion into the Pd-H
  bond and subsequent C-C bond-forming reductive elimination from 46 to give regioisomeric
  product 30. The observation that deuterium scrambling in the minor diastereomer
  is not complete (78% D at C2; 84% H at C1′) could be due to a small amount of diastereomer
  formation via the competing Wacker-type pathway described above ().
