caption: Blockade of the VEGF pathway with mAbs. The specificity of the VEGF family
  ligands for the VEGF receptors and coreceptors are shown. The clinically-relevant
  mAbs targeting the anti-VEGF pathway discussed in this review are placed based on
  their blockade of VEGF ligand or receptor. The ligand-binding antibodies bevacizumab
  (bev), r84, and VEGF-Trap inhibit ligand binding to the indicated receptor. IMC-18F1
  and IMC-1121B bind VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 respectively, and prevent ligand binding.
