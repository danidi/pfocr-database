caption: '1) Clinical examination of patients combined with molecular analyses is
  beginning to reveal NF1 genotype-phenotype correlations - findings that may define
  novel functions of neurofibromin and identify new therapeutic targets. In addition,
  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer a platform to identify genetic modifiers,
  which will facilitate the identification of novel targets and biomarkers. Understanding
  the effect of environmental factors and hormones on NF1 disease progression may
  also reveal novel treatments. 2) Patient-derived biopsies will aid in the generation
  of: a) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to allow development of patient and
  cell-specific models and give insights for new targets and biomarkers for different
  NF1 clinical manifestations; b) tumor-specific cell lines and animal models accurately
  reflecting the human disease that will permit improved screening of small molecule
  inhibitors; c) patient-derived cell line models will facilitate cellular pathway
  analysis (in particular RAS pathway and its upstream and downstream effectors (including
  receptor tyrosine kinases and micro RNAs) identification of therapeutic targets
  and biomarkers, and will also allow the testing of novel drugs including small molecule
  inhibitors prior to their use in clinical trials; d) synthetic lethal screening
  (using CRISPR libraries) could be exploited to devise therapies to selectively kill
  NF1-deficient tumors; e) immune profiling leading to immunotherapy and generation
  of novel biomarkers for NF1-associated tumors. 3) Gene therapy approaches focus
  on antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and nonsense suppression, whereas potential
  correction of mutations via gene editing offers a possibility of restoring endogenous
  NF1 gene function, thereby providing a long-term solution for NF1 patients. Highlighted
  boxes: clinical studies/biopsies (orange), genetic analysis and screening (green),
  disease models (blue), new insights into basic NF1 biology (red), potential therapeutic
  approaches and clinical treatments (yellow).'
