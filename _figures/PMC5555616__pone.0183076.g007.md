caption: Under the stress of proteasome inhibition, p38 and Akt are phosphorylated
  and they activate Nrf2, which then dissociates from Keap1. Activated Nrf2 subsequently
  translocates into the nucleus and induces the expression of HO-1, which provides
  a `neuroprotective effect. However, this pathway is abrogated by the PINK1 G309D
  mutation.
