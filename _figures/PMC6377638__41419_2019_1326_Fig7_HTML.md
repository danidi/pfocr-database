caption: MiR-30a regulates cancer cell response to chemotherapy through SNAI1/IRS1/ERK/AKT
  pathway. On the other hand, miR-30a is a downstream target gene of AKT-FOXO30a that
  forms a feedback loop. In addition, it is highly possible that other miRNAs identified
  by miRNA screen may also be involved in gemcitabine response and are worth exploring
  further
