caption: Pathway analysis identifies a network of genes related to lipid metabolism
  in islets cultured at 5.6 mM glucose concentration. The network is displayed graphically
  as nodes (genes/gene products) and edges (the biological relationships between the
  nodes). Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class
  of the gene product. The node color indicates up (red)- or down (green)-regulation
  by Pioglitazone. Edges are displayed with various labels that describe the nature
  of the relationship between the nodes (A, activation; B, binding; E, expression;
  I, inhibition; P, phosphorylation; T, transcription). Edges without a label represent
  binding only. The node Srebf1 was identified by the pathway analysis as part of
  the network, and its differential gene expression was determined subsequently by
  qRT-PCR. A total of 15 differentially expressed focus genes were brought into this
  network with a highly significant score of 30.
