caption: Model of NFIL3/E4BP4 function in cell survival pathways and a proposed mechanism
  of action of the E2A-HLF oncoprotein in the transformation of pro-B lymphocytes.
  Expression of the NFIL3/E4BP4 gene is tightly regulated by IL-3 through an undefined
  signal transduction pathway emanating from the ligand-activated IL-3 receptor. The
  NFIL3/E4BP4 transcription factor binds to a consensus sequence in the promoter of
  downstream target genes, leading to trans-activation of critical survival signals.
  Because HLF and NFIL3/E4BP4 can recognize the same DNA binding site, the constitutively
  expressed E2A-HLF oncoprotein can replace the function of the normal IL-3-regulated
  transcription factor, accounting for its anti-apoptotic role in leukemogenesis.
  An additional prediction of the model is that the consensus binding site (TTACGTAA)
  could serve as a versatile regulatory switch, allowing other, still-to-be-identified
  mammalian CES-2 homologues to contribute to programmed cell death by acting as trans-repressors
  of this pathway.
