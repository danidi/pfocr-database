caption: IPA illustrating the predicted effect of milk removal on PI3K signaling in
  T lymphocytes. Cows were assigned to UFM [twice daily milking of the left udder
  half (2×), four times daily milking of the right udder half (4×)] starting on day
  1 of lactation. Mammary biopsies from both rear quarters were obtained on day 5
  of lactation, immediately after the 4× udder half was milked but 3.5 h after the
  2× udder half had last been milked (n = 4 cows). Gene expression was detected using
  Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Arrays. Differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤
  0.05) were uploaded into IPA, and core analysis was run to identify enriched networks.
  The most affected canonical pathway was PI3 signaling in T lymphocytes. Genes in
  green were downregulated in mammary tissue from 4× udder halves; genes in red were
  upregulated.
