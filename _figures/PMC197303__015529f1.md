caption: Impact of the ssi2 Mutant on Defense Signaling in Arabidopsis.SA and JA are
  important signaling molecules in plant defense. JA signaling is required for the
  pathogen-activated expression of PDF1.2 and resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen
  B. cinerea. SA signaling is required for the pathogen-activated expression of the
  PR genes and resistance to Psm. The EDS5 and SID2 genes are required for SA synthesis;
  the loss-of-function eds5 and sid2 mutations block SA synthesis. SA signaling is
  activated via both NPR1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In addition to SA,
  an unknown pathogen-activated factor is required for signaling through the NPR1-independent
  pathway. The loss of the SSI2-encoded stearoyl-ACP desaturase activity in the ssi2
  mutant has pleiotropic effects on plant defense responses. The ssi2 mutant allele
  promotes (+) the spontaneous development of lesions containing dead cells, the accumulation
  of increased SA levels, and the constitutive expression of NPR1-dependent and -independent
  defense mechanisms, which confer high-level expression of PR genes and enhanced
  resistance to Psm. By contrast, the ssi2 mutant interferes with (−) the ability
  of JA/MeJA to activate PDF1.2 expression and exhibits enhanced susceptibility to
  B. cinerea. 18:1 application restores the JA-inducible expression of PDF1.2 in the
  ssi2 mutant plant (), suggesting a role for an 18:1-derived factor, which is limiting
  in the ssi2 mutant plant, in promoting JA signaling.
