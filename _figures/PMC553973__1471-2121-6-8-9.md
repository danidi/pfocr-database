caption: Mechanisms of HGF induced cellular responses in endothelial cells. Panel
  A-HGF in the absence of ECM molecules can activate the Map kinase pathway through
  the Met receptor tyrosine kinase leading to a proliferative response. Panel B-HGF
  and co-stimulation with collagen induces activation of both the Map kinase and PI-3
  kinase pathways through an unknown mechanism presumably through integrin ligation,
  which is Ras independent. Panel C-HGF-FN (and by analogy HGF-VN) complexes promote
  enhanced cellular responses by promoting the association of integrins with the Met
  receptor leading to the recruitment and enhanced activation of Ras, Erk 1/2 kinases
  and PI-3 kinase promoting both elevated proliferative and migratory responses.
