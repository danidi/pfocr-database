caption: PHB1/2 complex is highly surface expressed in Th17 cells which contributed
  to CRAF‐MAPK activation. Activation of this pathway contributes to the fine balance
  between inhibition of FOXP3 or expression of RORγt. Targeting surface‐exposed PHB1/2
  with Vi polysaccharide led to inhibition of CRAF activation which in turn shifts
  the balance towards FOXP3‐expressing Tregs and inhibits production of Th17‐associated
  pathogenic factors.
