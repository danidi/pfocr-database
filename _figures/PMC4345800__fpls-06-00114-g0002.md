caption: Epigenetic regulation in the high-salinity stress response. Salt stress induces
  the activation of high-salinity stress-responsive genes with changes in several
  histone modification marks. Treatment with low concentrations of salt prior to a
  second stress (priming) induces reduction of H3K27me3 in HKT, which controls Na+
  partitioning. Priming-induced low H3K27me3 levels in HKT established long-term memory
  for rapid response to a second stress (top). Under salt stress, the expression of
  genes such as ABI1 and ABI2, which are associated with the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling
  pathway, is fine-tuned by epigenetic regulation mechanisms involving histone acetylation
  (bottom).
