caption: The classical testosterone signalling pathway. Testosterone diffuses through
  the plasma membrane and binds with the AR. The AR undergoes an alteration in conformation
  allowing it to be released from heat shock proteins in the cytoplasm. AR then is
  able to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences called
  androgen response elements (AREs). AR binding to an ARE allows the recruitment of
  co-activator and co-repressor proteins that alter the expression of genes to alter
  cellular function.
