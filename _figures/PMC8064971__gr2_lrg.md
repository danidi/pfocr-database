caption: 'Critical PPIs and proteins involved in the virus life cycle. The PPIs suitable
  for inhibitor design are highlighted in red. Host proteins involved in CoV processing
  might be candidates that can be targeted through the PPII strategy: these include
  primary cellular receptors for CoV, such as ACE2 or DPP4, and host proteases, such
  as TMPRSS2 or furin. Host receptors are recognized by CoV spike proteins and the
  binding of receptor and S1 domain of S protein subsequently activates the conformational
  changes of S protein. For host proteases, the serine protease TMPRSS2 is responsible
  for two distinct functions during the CoV infection, including an alternative pathway
  for viral entry and activation of S protein for virus-cell fusion . In parallel,
  the protease furin, which is predominantly expressed on the trans-Golgi network
  and intracellular vesicles, activates the S protein by cleaving at the S1/S2 cleavage
  site, thus facilitating membrane fusion , . PPII inhibitors targeting host receptors
  and proteases may provide a potent way to prevent CoV from entering host cells during
  the early stages of infection. During later stages of infection, N protein dimerization
  and interaction with viral RNA is required for formation of RNP complexes and viral
  assembly. Targeting N dimers using a PPII strategy is a potential mechanism of inhibiting
  late steps of viral production. (For interpretation of the references to colour
