caption: 'Schematic representation of the putative arabidopsis RAM/MOR-like signalling
  cascade(s) identified in this work. On the basis of co-expression analyses the RAM/MOR-like
  pathway could be divided into two distinct signalling branches being active in at
  least two different developmental contexts: one including AtNDR2, AtNDR4, AtNDR5,
  AtMO25-1 and AtMO25-4, acting upstream of the Rho-like GTPase ROP1 and its regulators
  ROP-GEF8/9/11/12, and putatively involved in the regulation of polar growth of pollen
  tube. The same signalling module may be involved in parallel in the regulation of
  exocytosis and cell wall remodeling, during pollen tube growth. The second pathway,
  including AtSIK1, AtFRY, AtNDR2, AtNDR3, AtNDR4, AtNDR5, AtNDR6 and AtMO25-3, may
  be actively involved in the regulation of SAM maintenance and in floral transition,
  by influencing the CLV/WUS pathway, through chromatin remodelling and modulation
  of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). The identification of phosphorylation
  consensus motifs of NDR kinases on ROP-GEFs, on POL and on SYD proteins may suggest
  that the RAM/MOR pathway could represent, at least in part, a regulatory module
  operating upstream of these pathways.'
