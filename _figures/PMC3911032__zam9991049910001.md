caption: The nitrogen cycle. Denitrification consists of the sequential reduction
  of nitrogen to dinitrogen. The enzymes involved in the denitrification pathway are
  listed next to the reaction they catalyze. Nitrite can be alternatively reduced
  through the ammonification process. Nitrification proceeds from ammonia to nitrite
  via hydroxylamine (NH2OH). Ammonia can also be oxidized to dinitrogen during the
  anammox process (anaerobic ammonium oxidation). Finally, nitrogen fixation is responsible
  for incorporating the gaseous dinitrogen into the cycle as assimilable compounds.
