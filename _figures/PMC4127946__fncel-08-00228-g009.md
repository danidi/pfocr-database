caption: Proposed model for the role of CD28, CTLA-4, CD80, and the PD-1/PD-L pathway
  in mice after ischemic stroke. The following mechanisms of action for the various
  co-stimulatory molecules belonging to the B7 family are postulated. The affinity
  of CD80 for CTLA-4, PD-L1, and CD28 are kd = 0.4, 1.4, and 4.0 μM, respectively.
  Thus, at homeostatic levels, (A) PD-L1 competes with CTLA-4 for CD80 binding, thus
  providing in concert with MHC molecules a non-activating signal that promotes naïve
  T-cell survival, while simultaneously suppressing T-cell responses by outcompeting
  signaling through CD80/CD28. When stroke is induced in (B) WT and (C) PD-L2-/- mice,
  the level of CD80 expression is significantly increased, enhancing T-cell signaling
  through CD28 and further promoting T-cell activation resulting in an effector phenotype.
  However, when stroke is induced in the absence of PD-L1. (D) PD-L1-/- mice, with
  low CD80 expression and without PD-L1 to compete with CTLA-4, T-cell signaling results
  through CTLA-4. Also, MCAO-subjected PD-L1-/- mice exhibit significantly higher
  levels of both PD-1 and PD-L2, resulting in their prominent interactions. Thus,
  we propose that the CD80/CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L2 eventually lead to a suppressor phenotype.
