caption: The role of the general amino acid control pathway in TOR-regulated gene
  expression. Model depicting the role of GAAC in TOR-regulated gene expression including
  genes in the Gcn4p-dependent activation core and repression core. The top right
  panel illustrates a model wherein enhanced Gcn2p activity contributes to elevated
  Gcn4p transcriptional function. Conversely, TOR signaling serves to repress the
  GAAC, with elevated Gcn4p function occurring with lowered TORC1 activity.
