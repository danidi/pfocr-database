caption: The interplay of TLR and RLR signaling. TLRs expressed on the cell surface
  or localized on intracellular membranes recognize various sets of pathogenic structures
  among them viral genomes or replication intermediates and transduce signals through
  the NF-κB/type I IFN pathways. The TLR3 and TLR4 mediated signaling pathways are
  independent of MyD88 and IRAKs (IRAK-1/2/4), whereas the other TLRs use the MyD88
  pathway. TLR4 is capable of using both MyD88-dependent and independent signaling.
  TRAF3 and TRAF6 have a cardinal role in both the collaboration and the essential
  signaling processes of TLRs and RLRs.
