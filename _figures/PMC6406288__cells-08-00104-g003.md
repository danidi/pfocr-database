caption: 'Consequences of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) overexpression on the
  antitumoral immune response. Cancer cells frequently overexpress IDO as a result
  of its transcriptional upregulation. This can be triggered by (i) cytokines such
  as IFNγ, as long as lymphocytes are present within the tumor, (ii) the oncogene
  Kit, or (iii) mutations within the tumor suppressor gene Bin. IFNγ promotes IDO
  overexpression by activating the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
  transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, while Kit and Bin stimulate ETV4 (ETS variant
  4), and STAT1 and/or nuclear factor (NF)-κB, respectively. IDO expression levels
  can also be regulated by an autocrine loop, implying the complex KYN-AhR. Once in
  the cytosol, IDO mediates the transformation of tryptophan (TRP) into N-formylkynurenine
  that is then transformed into kynurenine (KYN). IDO overexpression leads to a decrease
  in the extracellular level of TRP, which limits the action of immune cells: T cells
  are not proliferating and can’t be activated; and CD3+ cells infiltrate less frequently
  and the function of NK cells is reduced. Cells other than cancer cells can overexpress
  IDO, including some immune cells such as MDSCs and DCs/macrophages. The overexpression
  of IDO in such cells restrains their own immune function (macrophages), suppresses
  T cells activity (DCs), and induces protumoral cytokines (MDSCs). As a result, in
  IDO overexpressing tumors, the antitumoral immune response is largely compromised.'
