caption: Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) is produced by non-parenchymal cells
  in the liver in response to iron stores and flux. Binding of BMP6 to the BMP receptor
  complex on hepatocytes, in conjunction with hemojuvelin (HJV) results in downstream
  signalling via SMAD1/5/8 and SMAD4, which in turn stimulates HAMP transcription
  and expression of hepcidin. HJV is stabilized by neogenin, and cleaved by matriptase
  2 (MT-2), allowing for fine-tuning of BMP6 signalling. SMAD signalling is additionally
  regulated by transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), upon association with human hemochromatosis
  protein (HFE) and HJV. HFE also interacts with TfR1, where it competes with holotransferrin.
  Consequently, when iron supply is high, HFE is displaced from TfR1 allowing it to
  associate with TfR2, thereby increasing hepcidin expression via SMAD signalling.
  Under inflammatory conditions, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and related cytokines bind IL-6
  receptor, resulting in JAK1/2-STAT3 activation and hepcidin expression to restrict
  iron availability. Finally, developing erythroid cells confer their iron requirements
  via secretion of erythroferrone (ERFE), which inhibits hepcidin expression, via
  a currently unknown receptor and signalling pathway, to stimulate iron uptake under
  circumstances of high erythropoietic demand.
