caption: V-ATPase is activated by LPH to promote viral entry into the cytoplasm, a
  process which was also effected by PAN1 and otoferlin. BAT1 related channel could
  serve as an alternative pathway for virus transmembrane transport. The released
  nucleocapsid is transported into the nucleus with the help of EFP. During replication,
  EFHP, ASGPA, ALT2, U2AF, ACT5 and ZRDP play an important role in facilitating virus
  replication. MFS is induced by the virus to increase cell volume leading to cell
  death. At the same time, the apoptosis process could be triggered by PDK to inhibit
  BmNPV infection.
