caption: 'Summary of changes in cell signaling pathways in mouse kidneys as a result
  of CypD ablation. Increased expressions of phospho-AKT S473 and phospho-p70S6K and
  pAMPK (in males only) were observed in Ppif−/− mice. Additionally, Ppif−/− females
  (presented on the right side of the image) showed a reduced expression of TGFβ1
  as well as higher expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 proteins. ↑: increase
  compared to WT controls, ↓: decrease compared to WT controls. Please note that a
  direct link between the phosphorylation of Akt and phosphorylation of MAP kinases
  p38 and ERK1/2 is not fully confirmed in the here used mouse model. Please also
  note that, since our experiments were performed in the whole kidney, the exact contribution
  of each subcellular fraction to the observed changes requires further investigation.'
