caption: Biosynthesis of Sec and de novo biosynthesis of cysteine. The biosynthesis
  of Sec occurs on its tRNA and the pathway begins with the attachment of serine to
  Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec by seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerS) in the presence of ATP. Phosphoseryl-tRNA
  kinase (PSTK) phosphorylates the serine moiety to form an intermediate, phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec,
  that in turn is acted upon by Sec synthase (SecS), converting the phosphoserine
  moiety to an intermediate, likely aminoacrylyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec. SecS accepts selenophosphate
  (H2SePO3−; upper pathway), converting the intermediate to Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec. Selenophosphate
  synthetase 2 (SPS2) synthesizes selenophosphate from selenide in the presence of
  ATP. In the lower pathway, sulfide can replace selenide in the reaction with SPS2,
  generating thiophosphate (H2SPO3−) that in turn can interact with SecS and PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec
  to yield Cys-tRNA[Ser]Sec.
