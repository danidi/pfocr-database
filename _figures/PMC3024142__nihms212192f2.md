caption: PLA2 may mediate excitotoxicity, cerebrovascular dysfunction and oxidative
  stress in AD. Aβ leads to increases in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of kinases
  in the ERK/MAPK pathway. GIVA-PLA2 activity and access to its phospholipid substrate
  is increased by Ca2+ binding to its C2 domain and phosphorylation by ERK/MAPK kinases.
  Increased GIVA-PLA2 activity increases AA release from membrane phospholipids. AA
  can increase neuronal excitability, presumably by elevating surface levels of AMPARs
  and NMDARs. AA and its metabolites are diffusible and can affect neighboring neurons
  to increase network excitability and blood vessels to cause cerebrovascular dysfunction.
  They can also lead to excessive production of reactive oxygen species leading to
  oxidative stress.
