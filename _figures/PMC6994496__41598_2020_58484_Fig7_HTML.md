caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed new pathway that operates upstream of the
  CRL2VHL complex and involves the UBXN7 cofactor protein and its regulation by mitochondrial
  MUL1 E3 ligase. MUL1 ligase, through constant K48-linked polyubiquitination, maintains
  a steady low level of UBXN7 protein that is able to act as cofactor in assembling
  the active CRL2VHL complex necessary for the regulation of HIF-1α during normoxia.
  When MUL1 becomes inactive or its activity is compromised, it leads to high levels
  of UBXN7 protein that function as an inhibitor of the CRL2VHL complex. Without an
  active CRL2VHL complex HIF-1α protein accumulates and drives glycolysis under normoxia.
  MUL1 protein levels are regulated by K48-autoubiquitination as well as by the action
  of the mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2 protease.
