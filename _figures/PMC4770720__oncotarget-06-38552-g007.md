caption: CIN cells generate ROS and DAMPs like oxidised HMGB1, which trigger the local
  immune response in nearby cells through the Toll/NFκB pathway which in turn activates
  JNK and Mmp1. The activation of Mmp1 leads to basement membrane digestion and hemocyte
  recruitment. The recruited hemocytes subsequently trigger the apoptosis of underlying
  cells through secretion of TNFα and further activation of JNK. Note that the signalling
  processes are drawn in adjacent cells for clarity, but may all occur in the same
  cell. Dashed lines indicate the production of activated Toll ligand by a process
  that is not well characterized. This model is informed by data from [] and [] on
  hemocyte responses and [] on JNK activation of Toll.
