caption: Linking radiotherapy resistance and serine/glycine metabolism in the tumor
  and associated tumor microenvironment. Activation of de novo serine/glycine biosynthesis
  pathway in cancer stem cells (CSC) under hypoxia and nutrient-deprived conditions
  is important to sustain cancer cell viability and proliferation, supporting the
  synthesis of nucleotides for DNA repair, as well as the synthesis of reductive equivalents
  that protect the cancer stem cells and their progeny against redox stress via autocrine
  and paracrine routes. In addition, de novo serine/glycine biosynthesis enzymes,
  i.e., PHGDH and PSAT1, are involved in the maintenance of CSCs stemness and self-renewal,
  for instance, via posttranslational regulation of OCT4, as well as regulating stem
  cell fate via αKG. In the tumor microenvironment, high PHGDH activity is essential
  for the survival of endothelial cells and promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment
  with an increase in M2 macrophage polarization. In addition, serine and glycine
  are required for the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β.
