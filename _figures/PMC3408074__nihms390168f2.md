caption: TRPML1 is predicted to have six transmembrane domains with the N- and C-
  terminus tails oriented toward the cytosol. The first luminal loop is highly N-glycosilated
  and undergoes proteolytic cleavage in lysosomes (). The N-terminus tail (left box)
  contains a dileucine sorting motif that directly interacts with clathrin adaptors
  AP1 and AP3 (yellow circles), a stretch of polar and hydrophobic aminoacids that
  binds ALG-2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (green circles), and a poly-basic domain
  predicted to participate in the binding to PI(3,5)P2 (red letters). The C-terminus
  tail includes two serine residues phosphorylated by PKA (dark blue circles with
  white letters) (), three cysteines that undergo palmitoylation (purple circles),
  and a dileucine sorting sequence that regulates AP2-dependent internalization from
  the plasma membrane (yellow circles).
