caption: Model depicting roles of Sufu in chaperoning Gli functions during Shh signaling.
  In the absence of Shh little Gli1 is made, whereas Sufu associates, stabilizes,
  and accompanies nascent Gli2 and Gli3 to the basal body of the primary cilium, where
  the latter two are phosphorylated by PKA/GSK3/CK1 kinases and processed into the
  truncated repressors. The resultant Sufu-GliR complexes traverse unrestrictedly
  to the nucleus, forming repressive transcriptional complexes on the chromatin. Here,
  Sufu also actively repress transcription via its interaction with SAP18 and the
  corepressor complex. In the presence of Shh, formation of truncated Gli2 and Gli3
  repressors is blocked, and Sufu-GliR complexes fall off the chromatin and are exported
  out of the nucleus either as dissociated components or together for turnover, resulting
  in the induction of Gli1 and other pathway target genes. Sufu accompanies nascent
  Gli1 and full-length Gli2 and Gli3 traversing through the primary cilium, where
  they are modified by Smo-dependent events and become competent to be imported into
  the nucleus, where Sufu-GliA complexes bind the chromatin and further activate target
  gene expression. Note that in this model, Shh promotes the movement of Sufu-GliA
  into and Sufu-GliR complexes out of the nucleus concurrently, but the nuclear import
  of Sufu-GliA complexes is coupled to its trafficking through the primary cilium.
