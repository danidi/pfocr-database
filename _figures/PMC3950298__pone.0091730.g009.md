caption: PC1 functions as a mechanosensory molecule that senses external mechanical
  stimuli, thereby converting these mechanical signals into potentiation of intracellular
  calcium. Then calcium-dependent Akt phosphorylates and then leads to the phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β. The phospho-GSK-3β inhibits β-catenin for proteolysis, which leads to
  active β-catenin nuclear translocation and transcriptional regulation of genes involved
  in osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation such as Runx2.
