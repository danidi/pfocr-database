caption: Palmitoylation targets the protein kinase DLK to axonal vesicles. Palmitoylation
  is also essential for the assembly of signaling complexes containing DLK, the kinase
  MKK4 and the scaffold protein JIP3, and for DLK to activate JNK pathway signaling.
  Any or all of these roles of palmitoylation may account for the critical role of
  palmitoyl-DLK in conveying retrograde injury signals that result in nuclear responses,
  including phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun. The retrograde motor
  protein dynein itself has been identified as a palmitoyl-protein in several independent
  studies, as have subunits of the dynactin complex, and the dynein regulatory protein
  Ndel1 {; ; ; ). Palmitoylation may thus affect the localization and/or activity
  of multiple proteins involved in axonal retrograde signaling.
