caption: Localizations of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and AC5/6 and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive
  efferent nerve fibers are indicated for type I and type II vestibular hair cells
  of the saccule/utricle in rat/mouse. Labels reflect localizations for which there
  is direct evidence from the present study. Putative neurotransmitters in nerve fibers
  are indicated in italics. E, efferent; A, afferent.
