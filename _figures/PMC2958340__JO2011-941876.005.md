caption: Schematic diagram of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway. The hedgehog signaling
  pathway is a potential modulator of cancer stem cell carcinogenesis with significant
  therapeutic implications. GDC-0449, XL-139, and IPI-926 are drugs under development
  targeting this signaling pathway.
