caption: Three pathways of exosome uptake by recipient cells. Exosomes can be internalized
  in a variety of ways, including phagocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, macropinocytosis,
  caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and lipid raft-dependent endocytosis. After internalization,
  exosomes follow the endocytic pathway and reach MVBs, which target lysosomes in
  most cases, leading to exosomal degradation and contents recycling to promote the
  metabolism of the recipient cells. Alternatively, internalized exosomes can undergo
  back-fusion with the limiting membrane of the MVBs and release their cargoes into
  the cytoplasm of the recipient cells. Secondly, the exosome membrane can also fuse
  with the plasma membrane, releasing its cargoes directly into the cytoplasm of the
  recipient cell. Thirdly, the exosome membrane surface can initiate intracellular
  signaling pathways by interacting with receptors/ligands on the recipient cell surface
  without exosome entry.
