caption: 'Top panel: In normal testes, Sertoli cells degrade SGG in phagocytosed residual
  bodies and apoptotic TGC remnants to GG, and then to PPG by lysosomal ARSA and GALC,
  respectively Note that in Sertoli cells of wild type animals, phagocytosed apoptotic
  germ cells or remnants thereof are not evident indicating the rapid pace of their
  degradation by lysosomal enzymes. Likewise, late residual bodies disappear in due
  time. PPG produced from the SGG degradation pathway may be shuttled to developing
  pachytene spermatocytes (pSc) for new SGG synthesis, although pSc themselves would
  also have the ability to synthesize PPG de novo. See box for the SGG degradation
  and synthesis pathways. Bottom left panel: In 5-month old Arsa knockout mice, SGG
  is accumulated in Sertoli cells due to the lack of ARSA, although these higher levels
  of intracellular SGG have not yet reached the cytotoxic threshold. With no PPG produced
  in Sertoli cells for recycling, pSc would likely have to increase the de novo synthesis
  of PPG, and therefore the amounts of SGG in TGCs of these knockout mice are the
  same as those in age-matched wild type males. Bottom right panel: In 8-month old
  Arsa null mice, the much higher levels of accumulated SGG exert cytotoxicity to
  Sertoli cells, which then become smaller in size with their nuclei (N) displaced
  to be on top of the basement membrane. Sertoli cells in these aging Arsa null mice
  presumably are much less functional having reduced support for the development of
  TGCs. pSc in turn synthesize PPG at reduced rates and the subsequent levels of SGG
  in TGCs in these knockout mice are only 50% of the corresponding wild type levels.
  Also, the shaping of the elongated spermatid head, as regulated by Sertoli cells,
  is aberrant, resulting in production of sperm with abnormal morphology. BTB: blood-testis
  barrier, Ly: lysosome, Rb: residual body, SG: spermatogonium, lSc: leptotene spermatocyte,
  RS: round spermatid, ES: elongated spermatid. Adapted from Xu et al. [].'
