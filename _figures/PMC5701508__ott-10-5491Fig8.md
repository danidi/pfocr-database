caption: 'NFκB pathway.Notes: (A) The canonical pathway starts with binding of TNF
  to its receptor, activating the IKK complex, which phosphorylates IκBα, promoting
  its polyubiquitination and further proteasome-dependent degradation. Free NFκB rapidly
  enters the nucleus, where it can activate the expression of specific genes, and
  noncanonical pathway induction leads to the activation of NIK, which phosphorylates
  and activates IKKα, phosphorylating p100, resulting in its ubiquitination and partial
  processing to p52. (B) In breast cancer ER+ tumors, IκBα phosphorylation is inhibited
  by estrogen in the canonical pathway. In contrast, some carcinogens like 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene
  (DMBA) increase NFκB. In the noncanonical pathway, the deletion of the NFκB2 gene
  leads to inhibition of target gene expression, while at the same time it promotes
  an increase in canonical pathway activity.'
