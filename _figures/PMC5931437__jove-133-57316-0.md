caption: 'The caspases can be divided into two groups: the initiator caspases (caspase-1,
  -2, -4, -5, -8, -9, -10, and -12) and the executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and
  -7). The executioner caspases are present in the cell as preformed dimers and are
  activated by cleavage between the large and small subunit . When activated, they
  cleave numerous structural and regulatory proteins resulting in apoptosis . The
  initiator caspases are the first caspases to be activated in a pathway and generally
  trigger the activation of executioner caspases. In contrast to executioner caspases,
  initiator caspases are activated by dimerization . This dimerization is facilitated
  by recruitment of inactive monomers to specific large molecular weight complexes
  known as activation platforms. Assembly of activation platforms is governed by a
  series of specific protein:protein interactions. These are mediated by conserved
  protein interaction motifs present in the proform of the initiator caspase and include
  the death domain (DD), death effector domain (DED) and caspase recruitment domain
  (CARD)  (). Activation platforms generally include a receptor protein and an adaptor
  protein. The receptor is usually activated upon binding of a ligand, inducing a
  conformational change that allows for the oligomerization of numerous molecules.
  The receptor then either recruits the caspase directly or adaptor molecules that
  in turn bring the caspase to the complex. Thus, numerous caspase molecules come
  into close proximity permitting dimerization. This is known as the induced proximity
  model . Once dimerized, the caspase undergoes autoprocessing, which serves to stabilize
  the active enzyme . For example, assembly of the Apaf1 apoptosome is triggered by
  cytochrome c following its release from the mitochondria in a process called mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Apaf1 in turn recruits caspase-9 through
  an interaction that is mediated by a CARD present in both proteins . Similar protein
  interactions result in the assembly of the CD95 death inducing signaling complex
  (DISC) that leads to caspase-8 activation; the PIDDosome, which can activate caspase-2;
  and various inflammasome complexes that initiate caspase-1 activation . Thus, initiator
  caspases are recruited to specific activation platforms by a common mechanism resulting
  in induced proximity and dimerization, without which activation will not occur.'
