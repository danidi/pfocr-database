caption: Model for cathelicidin gene activation by vitamin D3 in keratinocytes. 1-α-hydroxylase
  CYP27B1 which converts 25D3 to 1,25D3 is expressed in keratinocytes and is under
  the control of danger signals that occur during skin infection and tissue damage.
  Activated 1,25D3 binds to and activates the vitamin D receptor (VDR) which recruits
  different coactivator proteins. SRC3 (steroid receptor coactivator 3) forms a complex
  with activated VDR leading to recruitment of histone acetyltransferases. Histone
  acetylation opens up the chromatin, thus facilitating access to the transcription
  start site of the cathelicidin gene.
