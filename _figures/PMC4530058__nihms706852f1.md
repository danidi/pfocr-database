caption: A number of aspects of the model require further validation. This includes
  the role of LMO4 in the regulation of PTP1B. What is the specific neuronal subtype
  and region of the brain in which PTP1B and LMO4 are localized? Trodusquemine has
  a direct impact on PTP1B that is independent of oxidation, yet it effectively suppresses
  anxiety. To what extent does reversible oxidation of PTP1B contribute to this pathway?
  What is the source of ROS for PTP1B oxidation and how is it triggered? Is there
  a role for mGluR5 in ROS production and where in the cell does the regulation occur?
  Does LMO4 inhibit PTP1B activity at the level of promoting oxidation and inactivation,
  or impairing reduction and reactivation? Another important feature is the regulation
  of mGluR5 activity by reversible tyrosine phosphorylation. What is the kinase that
  phosphorylates mGluR5 and how is its activity coordinated with this signaling pathway?
  To what extent does tyrosine phosphorylation alter signaling output from mGluR5?
  What are the critical sites for regulation of mGluR5 function?
