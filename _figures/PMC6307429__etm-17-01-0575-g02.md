caption: Role of the NF-κB pathway in the miR-155/SOCS1 axis in the immune system.
  Exposure of cells to lipopolysaccharide or inflammatory cytokines, including TNF
  or IL-1, as well as the recognition of bacterial and viral products by Toll-like
  receptors on immune cells, results in NF-κB induction. The interactions between
  T-cell receptors and CD28 receptors with their ligands, MHC class II, and the co-stimulatory
  molecules CD80 and CD86 on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, trigger the
  NF-κB pathway in T-cells. NF-κB becomes activated and translocates to the nucleus,
  where it induces the expression of its target genes. This pathway may induce M1
  macrophage polarization. In T-cells, it may lead to the expression of NF-κB-dependent
  genes, including IL-2, IL-2R and interferon, which are required for T-cell activation
  and proliferation. SOCS1 may regulate NF-κB signaling by binding to the p65 subunit
  of NF-κB, the TLR adaptor molecule TIRAP, as well as IRAK. miR-155 targets SOCS1
  and inhibits its expression, therefore indirectly promoting the NF-κB pathway. Ag,
