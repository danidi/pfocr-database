caption: '(A) Two verbal models of fate specification in the row of six vulval precursor
  cells in C. elegans: 1° (blue), 2° (red) and 3° (yellow) fates. (B) Schematic diagram
  summarizing interactions in the model between EGF (blue) and Notch (red) pathways,
  and their crosstalk (green). All cells have the same network wiring. Boxes are gene
  products. ER: EGFR, ERAI: activated EGFR or Ras pathway, MAPKP: phosphorylated MAP
  kinase, Egl17: 1° cell fate effector, DSL: diffusible Delta, LAG2: membrane-bound
  Delta, NOTCH: Notch receptor, NI: Notch intracellular domain, Lip1: 2° cell fate
  effector and MAP kinase phosphatase. The Ground symbols indicate degradation, and
  (+) constant synthesis. Simple arrows indicate transformation (MAPK to MAPKP and
  conversely), binding (ligands to receptors) or activation of the downstream node,
  according to equations in . Double arrows indicate diffusion. (C) Fate plane in
  the model showing the criteria used to assign cell fates, according to concentrations
  of Lip1 and Egl17, which are 2° and 1° fate effectors, respectively. Cell fates
  at the boundaries correspond to (experimentally observed; []) intermediate fates.
