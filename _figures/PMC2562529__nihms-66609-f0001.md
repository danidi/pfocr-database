caption: Proposed effects of UVB and caffeine on the ATR/Chk1/cyclin B1 pathway and
  premature chromatin condensation. The signal that DNA synthesis is not complete
  (and that chromatin condensation and mitosis should not start) is sent by ATR after
  it is recruited to stalled replication forks that have been coated by replication
  protein A. ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 results in a decreased level and
  function of cyclin B1, which delays mitotic entry and prevents premature chromatin
  condensation and mitosis. Inhibition of the ATR/Chk1 pathway in UVB-treated cells
  should result in a premature increase in cyclin B1 and premature chromatin condensation,
  mitosis, and cell death, probably by mitotic catastrophe followed by apoptosis,
  as suggested by Brown and Attardi (). Adapted with permission from Nghiem et al.
