caption: 'Biosynthesis of plasmalogen initiates in peroxisomes, where dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP) is acylated in its sn-1 position by glycerone phosphate O-acyltransferase
  (1: GNPAT), followed by formation of the characteristic ether linkage in the early
  precursor of plasmalogen via exchange of the sn-1 acyl group with an alkyl group
  by alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (2: AGPS). A fatty alcohol used for this introduction
  of the sn-1 alkyl ether group is derived from a fatty acid by the enzymatic action
  of fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (Far1) (). Far1 is known as a rate-determining enzyme
  of the plasmalogen synthesis pathway, whose level is regulated by a feedback mechanism
  in response to the plasmalogen level (; ). 1-O-alkyl-DHAP is reduced to 1-O-alkyl-2-hydroxy-glycero-3-phosphate
  (1-O-alkyl-2-hydroxy-G3P) by acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase (3) located in both the peroxisomal
  and the ER membranes. Reaction proceeds in the ER to form 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-G3P by
  alkyl/acyl-glycerophosphate acyltransferase (4) (), 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-G by PA phosphatase
  named lipin (5) (), 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPE (GPC) by the ethanolaminephosphotransferase
  (EPT) or cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) activity (6), and 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-acyl-GPE,
  that is, plasmenylethanolamine by plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (7). Plasmenylcholine
  is formed from plasmenylethanolamine in pathways either with or without replacement
  of the sn-2 acyl chain. One pathway without the acyl chain replacement is via formation
  of 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-acyl-G, such as by phospholipase C among several possible routes
  (8), followed by the plasmenylcholine formation by the CPT activity (15). Another
  pathway including the acyl chain replacement is via formation of 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-hydroxy-GPE
  by phospholipase A2 (9), and 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-hydroxy-GP either upon cleavage of
  the ethanolamine headgroup by lysophospholipase D (10) or upon cleavage of the phosphoethanolamine
  headgroup by lysophospholipase C (11) with subsequent phosphorylation by phosphotransferase
  (12). 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-hydroxy-GP is acylated by acyl-CoA acyltransferase (13)
  to form 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-acyl-GP, whose phosphate is released by phosphohydrolase
  (14) to form 1-O-alk-1′-enyl-2-acyl-G.'
