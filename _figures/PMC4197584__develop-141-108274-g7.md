caption: Pathway interactions regulating midgut patterning. During gastrulation, Nodal
  establishes a morphogen gradient to specify nascent endoderm from primitive streak.
  The Foxh1-mediated high Nodal signal (H) is crucial for foregut patterning and the
  establishment of foregut-midgut boundary; medium/low (M/L) amount of Nodal enhances
  Nepn expression. The expression of Sox17 restricts Nepn expression domain to the
  DE. RA is secreted from the adjacent mesoderm and diffuses to the endoderm to further
  restrict Nepn expression in the midgut region. Higher RA signaling facilitates the
  expansion of Nepn expression domain posteriorly.
