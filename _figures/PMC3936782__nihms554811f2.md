caption: 'Neuroprotective/apoptotic intracellular cascades at baseline and as mitigated
  by mood stabilizers in BD. The canonical brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB
  signaling pathway is presented to highlight its potent neurotrophic/mitogenic effects,
  which occurs partially via the inhibition of apoptosis. As described in Part I:
  , BDNF binds to TrkB, which stimulates a panoply of intracellular modulators that
  culminates in the transcription of neuroprotective genes (for the sake of presentation,
  these effects are collapsed by a dashed line with doubled dividers). On the pro-apoptotic
  end, increased intracellular calcium overloads mitochondrial calcium homeostatic
  regulatory mechanisms. This impairs the respiratory chain (complex I function),
  eventually resulting in decreased ATP levels and increasing reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production (again, for the sake of presentation, the intermediaries between
  increased intracellular calcium and ROS have been collapsed by a dashed line with
  double dividers). ROS not only exert genotoxic effects but also act on a number
  of ion channels. This vicious cycle further increases intracellular calcium influx
  and apoptosis. Lithium and mood stabilizing antiepileptic drugs activate the ERK/MAPK
  cascade, thereby increasing the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), a critical
  anti-apoptotic regulator. In the presence of neuropsychiatric insults (“death signals”),
  eg, chronic stress or prolonged sleep deprivation, increased extrasynaptic glutamate
  “spill-over” increases intracellular calcium (again, due to the loss of mitochondrial
  membrane integrity and release from intracellular stores). As a result, many destructive
  cascades commence and converge on final common pathways, ie, the activation of nucleic
  acid-cleaving caspases and excessive ROS production. Mitochondrial membrane damage
  also releases cytochrome C, which promotes apoptosis by caspase stimulation and
  the inhibition of the basal inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Lithium decreases caspase3
  transcription, which has powerful pro-apoptotic effects. In sum, lithium and other
  mood stabilizing drugs display potent pharmacological properties that either stimulate
  or inhibit the expression of many anti- or pro-apoptotic genes, respectively. Pro-apoptotic
  proteins are represented by maroon, and anti-apoptotic proteins are in green. Li,
