caption: 'Pathogenesis and immunomodulation of COVID -19: 1. The infected person spread
  the disease via a cough or sneeze to a healthy individual. 2. The Entry of virus
  via clathrin-mediated endocytosis or receptor-mediated, in later the virus spike
  protein binds to ACE-2 receptor of pulmonary epithelial cells and protease TMRSS2
  mediated activation of the spike protein. 3. Generation of cytokine storm by innate
  and immune cells: a. Upregulation Ag II due to low level of ACE-2 receptor which
  mediates activation of NF-kβ and AP-I signaling pathway via AT- 1 receptor resultant
  in vasodilation, edema, and cytokine secretion. b. Nuclear localization of IRF-3
  by virus which reduces the production of IFN-γ. c. Activation of toll-like receptor,
  RAGE and MHC-II via generation of DAMP''s from injured pneumocytes and through PAMP''s
  which leads to activation of NF-κβ, IRF-3/7, AP-1 signaling pathway. d. Weak sensitization
  of mast cells by virus releases a small amount of Ig E and IFN-γ followed by the
  attraction of NK cells, macrophage, and B-cells which further elevates the secretion
  of a cytokine storm. 4. Overview of damaged alveolus resulted from cytokine storm
  and hyperactive immune cells. The figure is made via biorender application: https://biorender.com/)'
