caption: 'Glutathione synthesis in the red blood cell. De novo synthesis of reduced
  glutathione (GSH) is represented in top half of figure and regeneration of reduced
  glutathione from oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in bottom half of figure. Glutamine,
  α-ketoglutarate, and alanine, with smaller contribution from aspartate, are the
  main precursors for the intracellular synthesis of glutamate. Glutamine is also
  used in the synthesis of NAD+. Cysteine, glycine, and glutamate are required for
  the de novo synthesis of reduced glutathione and this reaction is catalyzed by glutamate
  cysteine ligase (GCL), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. GSH reduces
  hydrogen peroxide by the action of glutathione peroxidases, and in turn is oxidized
  to GSSG. Glutathione reductase catalyzes the reverse reaction with the use of NADPH.
  Reduced NADPH is regenerated from NADP+ by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD). Abbreviations: ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase;
  NADS: nicotine adenine diamide synthetase; GCL: glutamate cysteine ligase; GSH:
  reduced glutathione; GSSG: oxidized glutathione; GPO: glutathione peroxidase; GR:
  glutathione reductase; G6PD: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. (A color version
