caption: Two different ubiquitin ligases control the stability of the Aurora-A and
  Polo-like kinases. In normally dividing cells, CHFR is inactivated during progression
  of the cell cycle (probably by phosphorylation mediated by Akt/protein kinase B
  at the G2/M transition; not shown). Under these conditions, Aurora-A and Plk1 are
  degraded during anaphase by a mechanism that involves APC/C-mediated ubiquitination
  and, at least for Aurora-A, a distributed degron. On microtubule disassembly or
  altered microtubule dynamics, a checkpoint response that depends on CHFR activation
  is initiated. The C-terminal cysteine-rich region of CHFR then recognizes the N
  terminus of Aurora-A, inducing its polyubiquitination and its subsequent proteasomal
  degradation. Note that this mechanism should also act under normal conditions that
  affect the basal stability of both Aurora-A and Plk1. CHFR might also be able to
  generate ubiquitin chains with a Lys63 topology, but the putative substrates for
  this alternative pathway remain unknown. Notably, CHFR- and APC/C-mediated ubiquitination
  of Aurora-A and/or Plk1 could target the same lysine residue. A possible interplay
  between the CHFR and APC/C pathways is thus conceivable, especially at the level
  of Aurora-A because both ubiquitin ligases require the intact N terminus of this
  kinase.
