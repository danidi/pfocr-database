caption: Simplified representation of porphyrin tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and metabolic
  pathways in Rhodobacter capsulatus relevant to the carbon substrates (enclosed in
  dashed boxes) used for growth of cultures in this work. Fructose is taken up by
  a phosphotransferase system, enters the cell as fructose-1-phosphate, and is catabolized
  to pyruvate through an Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas series of reactions (FBA, fructose
  bisphosphate aldolase). Glucose appears to be phosphorylated by glucokinase after
  entry into the cell, and glucose-6-phosphate is catabolized to pyruvate through
  an Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Fructose bisphosphate and glucose-6-phosphate can be
  interconverted through the sequential action of fructose 1–6 diphosphatase and phosphoglucose
  isomerase. Relationships between organic and amino acids are as shown. HemN2, the
  anaerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase encoded by rcc02494. The number of arrows
  in pathways may not necessarily correspond to the number of enzymatic reactions
  separating the substances shown (; ; ,; ; ; ; ; ; ).
