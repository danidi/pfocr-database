caption: RanBP2 interacts with Cox11 and HKI and the triad is in equilibrium under
  normal physiological conditions. RanBP2 prevents the inhibition of HKI by Cox11
  and its degradation. The ultimate effect of RanBP2 on its partners is the stimulation
  of the glycolytic pathway and production of ATP. The glycolytic pathway is critical
  to fuel the constitutive Na+/K+-ATPase pump to maintain the dark current between
  the inner and outer segment compartments of photosensory neurons. A deficit (haploinsufficiency)
  in RanBP2 disturbs the equilibrium between RanBP2, HKI, and Cox11. This pathophysiological
  event promotes the destabilization and degradation of HKI and a decrease in ATP
  production required to maintain the depolarization state neurons, and, hence, a
  reduction in the response of receptoral and postreceptoral neurons. A reduction
  in ATP levels also negatively modulates HKI activity/level. Decreased levels of
  HKI promote intracellular hyperglycemia and activate stress kinases, which modulate
  negatively the Na+/K+-ATPase pump by phosphorylation. Pathophysiological pathways
  promoted by RanBP2 haploinsufficiency are represented by dash lines. RIS, rod inner
  segment; ROS, rod outer segment.
