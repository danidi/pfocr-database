caption: Schematic display of the molecular interactions of apoptosis related molecules
  in dental apoptosis indicating the central position of the mitochondria pathway,
  which has been shown to be essential. Ligand binding to the corresponding membrane
  receptor and consequent conformation changes starts activation of the initiator
  caspases, such as caspase-8, which in turn, cleaves effector caspases, such as caspase-3.
  However, effector caspases can be activated also by the mitochondria pathways starting
  with release of cytochrome c and formation of the apoptosome (cytochrome c+Apaf-1+caspase-9).
  Both pathways are interconnected by tBid and can be modulated by Bcl-2 family members
  (Bax, Bcl-2) and apoptosis inhibitors, such as FLIP or XIAP. Increased levels of
  the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and decreased level of NF-kappa B supports
  commitment of the cell to apoptosis.
