caption: Expression of key biological pathways involved in M. tuberculosis recognition
  and intracellular killing. Significantly differentially expressed genes in response
  to M. tuberculosis infection of whole blood over 96 h, relative to uninfected whole
  blood controls, are up-regulated (coloured in red) or down-regulated (coloured in green).
  Intensity of colour indicates degree of transcript abundance. Genes coloured in
  blue did not reach significance. All pathways are generated using (IPA®) unless
  stated. (a1) Early (0–48 h) surface expressed receptors in the TLR pathway; (a2)
  Late (48–96 h) surface expressed receptors in the TLR pathway; (b) Clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis pathway (0–96 h); (c) Phagocytic vacuole pathway (using Kegg Pathway
  analysis, www.kegg.jp/kegg/–)- acidification and proteolytic digestion within the
  phagolysosome (0–96 h); (d) Antigen processing and presentation pathway (0–96 h).
