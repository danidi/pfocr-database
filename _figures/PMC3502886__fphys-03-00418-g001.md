caption: 'The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway regulates central carbon metabolism. (A) PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway. Signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway begins with the activation
  of RTKs in response to growth factors, leading to auto-phosphorylation on tyrosine
  residues and trans-phosphorylation of adaptor proteins. The PI3K is responsible
  for the production of 3-phosphoinositide lipid second messengers, including PIP3,
  which contributes to the activation of many downstream targets, such as PDK1 and
  mTORC2. Both PDK1 and mTORC2 activate, through phosphorylation in different sites,
  the serine-threonine protein kinase Akt. Akt regulates multiple functions including
  cellular metabolism, by promoting cell growth and proliferation through the activation
  of mTORC1, which also enhances the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. Dashed lines
  represent the negative regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by the action of
  mTORC1 feedback mechanism. (B) The metabolic network with the main reactions of
  glucose metabolism. A schematic representation of the glucose metabolism network,
  using the SBGN notation (LeNovere:2009]), is presented. The main pathways involved
  in the glucose metabolism are considered: glycolysis, PPP, the glycogen synthesis
  and degradation, lactate, and MPM branches. The metabolic targets regulated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway are represented on the network: the PI3K/Akt/mTOR direct regulation is presented
  in yellow; the PI3K/Akt/mTOR indirect regulation (via HIF-1α) is presented in pink;
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR direct and indirect regulation is presented in orange. All the
