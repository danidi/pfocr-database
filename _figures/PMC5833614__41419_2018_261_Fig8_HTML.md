caption: MAPK signaling transduced by aberrant MET activation and sustained by SPRY2
  mediated stabilization of the MET receptor inhibits myogenic differentiation and
  confers metastatic characteristics on RMS cells (a). Silencing MET induces differentiation
  and reduces the metastatic potential of RMS cells by dampening the MAPK signaling
  (b). Silencing SPRY2 decreases MET stability and results in reduced MAPK signaling,
  thereby recapitulating the effects of MET silencing in RMS cells (b). Proteasomal
  degradation is the preferred pathway of MET degradation in ERMS (RD) cells while
  lysosome mediated degradation is the preferred pathway of MET degradation in ARMS
  (SJRH30) cells. MET degradation by these pathways is prevented when SPRY2 is bound
  to MET
