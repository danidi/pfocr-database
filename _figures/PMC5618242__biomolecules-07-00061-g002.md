caption: Various mechanisms by which alcohol may affect carcinogenesis. Ethanol is
  oxidized to acetaldehyde by ADH, which acts as a carcinogen and binds to DNA. This
  metabolism is modified by polymorphisms or mutations in the genes encoding metabolizing
  enzymes. Acetaldehyde can form hybrid-adducts with reactive residues (e.g., malondialdehyde
  adduct) acting on proteins, mediating lipid peroxidation and nucleic acid oxidation.
  Excessive alcohol consumption leads to the induction of CYP2E1 pathway and may indirectly
  contribute to acetaldehyde development and ROS production. Excessive alcohol enhances
  catabolism of retinoic acid by alcohol-induced CYP2E1. The interaction of retinoids
  with different signaling pathways, including estrogen signaling, may favor proliferation
  and malignant transformation of pre-cancerous cells. Chronic ethanol intake is also
  associated with the failure of immune surveillance of tumor cells.
