caption: Schematic illustration of complement activation and evasion by NS1 protein
  of flavivirus. NS1 is expressed on the surface (mNS1) and is also secreted by flavivirus-infected
  cells (sNS1). Circulating sNS1 can subsequently bind to the surface of both infected
  and uninfected cells. In dengue virus secondary infections, IgM and IgG antibodies
  to NS1 during the acute phase of the disease can lead to the formation of immune
  complexes (1) that trigger inflammatory responses, including the activation of the
  complement cascade to generate the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, opsonins, and the
  membrane attack complex (MAC; reviewed by ) (2). NS1 has also been shown to contribute
  to viral immune evasion through interaction with complement proteins and its regulators.
  Binding to the alternative complement pathway regulatory protein FH leads to accelerated
  breakdown of the alternative pathway convertase with consequent reduced C3b deposition
  and MAC formation (). NS1 also binds to proC1s/C1s and C4 which results in increased
  cleavage of C4 to C4a and C4b, what may limit the amount of C4 available (). In
  addition, C4BP bound to NS1 can act as a cofactor for Factor I-mediated cleavage
  of C4b to C4c and C4d. Deposition of the sNS1–C4BP complex on the cell surface could
  lead to inactivation of cell surface bound C4b thereby protecting infected cells
  from complement mediated lysis (). NS1 from DENV-infected insect cells binds MBL
  and may protect DENV from MBL-mediated neutralization, suggesting a role for limiting
  complement activation at the site of the mosquito bite () (3). NS1 was suggested
  to inhibit MAC formation by interacting with vitronectin (VN), clusterin, and the
  terminal complement protein C9 (; ) (4).
