caption: 'Cytoskeleton remodeling and axonal transport. The cytoskeleton consists
  of three distinct, yet interconnected filament systems: microfilaments (actin filaments),
  intermediate filaments (IFs) and microtubules. Microfilaments are the thinnest filaments
  of the cytoskeleton and are composed of linear polymers of actin subunits. They
  act as tracks for the movement of myosin molecules and are controlled by the Rho
  family of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho, Rac and Cdc42. Intermediate filaments
  (vimentin, desmin, desmuslin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, peripherin, nestin,
  α-internexin) organize the internal tridimensional structure of the cell, anchoring
  organelles and serving as structural components of the nuclear lamina. Neurofilaments
  are the principal intermediate filament type expressed by neurons and are formed
  by coassembly of neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL), neurofilament medium polypeptide
  (NEFM) and heavy neurofilament subunit (NEFH) subunits. Peripherin is another IF
  protein. Neurofilaments are important protein cargoes for actin-associated motors,
  such as myosin and microtubule-associated motor, such as kinesin. Microtubules are
  polymers of α- and β-tubulin and, in association with other proteins such as dynein
  and dynactin, are important for axonal transport. Ephrins and their receptor tyrosine
  kinases play a pivotal role in axon guidance and synaptogenesis. Ephrin-A activation
  leads to the actin cytoskeleton reorganization and endocytosis. Ephrin-A signaling
  also promotes neurite outgrowth. Ephrin receptors also maintain feedback mechanisms
  that reverse signaling through their ephrin ligands. Clustering of ephrin-A molecules
  with ephrin-A receptors increases cellular adhesion. Conversely, activation of ephrin-B1
  leads to the disassembly of focal adhesions. Pathway objects and links are described
  separately in .'
