caption: GRP78 and endoplasmic reticulum stress. When a cell is under the influence
  of foreign factors, the endoplasmic reticulum is stressed, leading to the appearance
  of unfolded proteins or misfolded proteins inside the cell, which accumulates in
  the cell. At this time, three specific signaling pathways, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6,
  trigger the unfolded protein response. PERK, IRE1, ATF6, and GRP78 are activated
  from the binding state to the detached state. GRP78 binds to unfolded proteins or
  misfolded proteins to correct protein folding, while PERK and other physiological
  reactions reduce protein synthesis after a series of phosphorylation. In addition,
  the expression of GRP78 is up-regulated when ERS occurred, and the pro-apoptotic
  pathways caspase 12, JNK, and CHOP are activated. When UPR exceeds a specified limit,
  it also induces apoptosis through the caspase 12 pathway.
