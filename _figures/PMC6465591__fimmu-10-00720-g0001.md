caption: Lymphatic vessel functions during tumor progression. (Left) Tumor-associated
  lymphatics facilitate tumor cell spreading. Soluble factors produced in the tumor
  microenvironment (TME) induce LEC remodeling and interstitial flow increase (1),
  resulting in enhanced tumor cell migration into lymphatic vessels (LVs) (2). (Right)
  Tumor-associated lymphatics regulate anti-tumor immunity. Tumor associated (TA-)
  LECs actively promote DC migration toward draining lymph nodes (LNs) (3). DCs further
  present tumor-antigens to naïve T cells, leading to initiation of adaptive anti-tumor
  immunity. In tumor-draining LNs, VEGF-C exposed LEC cross-present tumor-antigens
  (Ags) and induce the deletion of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells (4). Intratumorally, naïve
  and activated T cells are weakly restimulated by local DCs, due to the immunosuppressive
  TME. The TME favors in particular the infiltration of Treg and naïve T cells through
  a CCL21-dependent pathway. TA-LECs also express high levels of PD-L1 in response
  to IFN-γ produced by effector T cells (5). Upon anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, TA-LEC
  mediated immunosuppression might be abrogated, contributing to enhanced T cell activation
  and tumor cell elimination (6). Drawing designed by Rémi Jeandenand.
