caption: Our results revealed the occurrence of a TAZ compensatory mechanism in postnatal
  Yap+/− retina, i.e., the decreased of Yap expression (red arrow) is accompanied
  by an increase of Taz expression (green arrow), that results in the upregulation
  of YAP/TAZ target gene expression. Our data suggest that this leads to prolonged
  proliferation of postnatal retinal progenitor cells, and that this phenotype may
  likely result from EGFR pathway potentiation. In the adult Yap+/− retina, the compensatory
  mechanism is no longer effective, and YAP/TAZ target genes expression is diminished.
  Under such conditions, one Yap allele deletion progressively leads to impaired Müller
  cell homoeostasis. We propose that this may, at least in part, contribute to impaired
  cone-specific visual cycle and therefore to the cone dystrophy observed in aged
  Yap+/− mice. RTKs Receptor tyrosine kinases. This figure was created with some schemas
