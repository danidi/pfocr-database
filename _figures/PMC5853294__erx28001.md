number: Fig. 1
caption: 'Metabolic pathways for TAG biosynthesis in green algae. FA synthesis pathways:
  (1) integration of newly assimilated carbon; (2) degradation of pre-formed polar
  lipids. (3) degradation of starch. Enzymes and substrates that are up-regulated
  under N deprivation are marked in italics. TAG synthesis pathways: (A) the Kennedy
  pathway, (B) PC acyl editing. CE, chloroplast envelope; Cyt, cytoplasm; FAS, fatty
  acid synthase pathway; ACP, acyl-carrier protein; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; PGA,
  3-phosphoglyceric acid; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; PtdA, phosphatidic acid; MAG,
  monoacylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; LPC, lyso-phosphatidylcholine; PDAT, phospholipid
  diacylglycerol acyltransferase; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase. (This figure
  is available in colour at JXB online.)'
