caption: . Comparisons of Ti- and Pd-eliminations. (A) Pathway for the C–N bond formation
  state omitted in  Pd-catalyzed C–C bond formation via reductive elimination. (C)
  Pd-catalyzed C–N bond formation via reductive elimination when replacing TiCl2Py
  in IM3 with Pd(CNtBu)2. Key bond lengths are given in angstroms. The optimized structures
  of all the stationary points are displayed in Fig. S7. .
