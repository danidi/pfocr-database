caption: Schematic representation of bile acid modulation of death and survival transduction
  pathways. Toxic bile acids induce apoptosis by activating both ligand-dependent
  and -independent death receptor oligomerization. The activation of death receptors
  by bile acids invariably signals the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in type
  II cells, such as hepatocytes. Moreover, toxic bile acids may directly target mitochondria,
  either through induction of the MPT and ROS production or activation of pro-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 family members. Finally, hydrophobic bile acids partially activate death-receptor-dependent
  survival pathways, such as the NF-κB. Hydrophilic bile acids do not induce apoptosis
  as they simultaneously activate survival signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and
  PI3K, antagonizing proapototic Bcl-2 family members and preventing mitochondrial
  dysfunction and apoptosis. See text for more complete description. Cyt c, cytochrome
  c; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase; MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition.
