caption: Androgen synthesis pathway and therapeutic targets. Cholesterol is synthesized
  from Acetyl-CoA and enzymes in this pathway were found to be upregulated by Holzbeierlein
  et. al. (red) []. Subsequently, the weak androgen androstenedione, testosterone,
  and the potent DHT are synthesized from cholesterol and enzymes in this pathway
  were found to be upregulated by Stanbrough et. al. (blue) and Montgomery et. al.
  (orange) [,]. Abiraterone blocks CYP17 which contain both 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase
  activities (boxed orange). Dutasteride blocks both SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 (boxed green).
