caption: The crosstalk between coagulation and autophagy promotes cancer-associated
  thrombosis and metastasis. The coagulation system is an integral part of the multifaceted
  approach taken by the cancer cell to survive, propagate and ultimately exhaust the
  body’s capacity to function. We speculate that cancer cells may use common mechanisms
  to hijack immune cells, ECs, and platelets to integrate with the coagulation system
  for its own end. A common mechanism present in each of these components may be the
  hijacking of the autophagy pathway. At early stages, cancer cells downregulate degradative
  autophagy while they increase the secretion of TRAPs, indicating a disruption in
  the balance of degradative and secretory autophagy. This balance is influenced by
  the coagulation cascade, particularly, PAR activation. In turn, both TRAPs and PAR
  activation by coagulation factors FVII and FX promote macrophage polarization into
  a M2 phenotype (TAMs) with enhanced suppressive capacities, reducing cytotoxic T
  cell responses favoring tumor growth. PARs also promote EMT, thus enabling cancer
  cells to invade and intravasate. In circulation, CTCs imcrease degradative autophagy
  as a survival mechanism and can promote thrombogenesis through activation of the
  coagulation cascade on platelets, neutrophils and ECs leading to an hypercoagulable
  state, that also promotes metastasis through endothelial and neutrophil activation.
