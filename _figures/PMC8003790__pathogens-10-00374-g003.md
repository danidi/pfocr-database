caption: Attachment of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (Kdo) to lipid IVA in the P. gingivalis
  W50 strain. The reactions are shown with detailed structures of substrates and products.
  Reconstruction and assignments were performed as described in the Materials and
  Methods section. The pathway enzymes (green) and genes (purple) are shown on the
  right, while EC numbers for the enzymes (blue) are shown on the left. Chemical compound
  names (red) are shown below the structures.
