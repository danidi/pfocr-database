caption: Combination therapy targeting the MAPK pathway and GPNMB in BRAF mutant melanoma.
  BRAF mutations (*) are present in approximately 50% of melanomas, which constitutively
  activate the MAPK pathway. Downstream ERK activation leads to MITF phosphorylation,
  resulting in decreased MITF protein stability and cytoplasmic retention. Clinically
  approved MAPK pathway inhibitors targeting BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) or MEK
  (trametinib, selumetinib, cobimetinib), stabilize and increase MITF nuclear localization.
  Nuclear MITF transcriptionally regulates many melanosomal genes, including GPNMB,
  which causes an increase in melanosome biogenesis and hyperpigmentation. MITF also
  induces PGC-1α expression, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus,
  MAPKi treated melanoma cells undergo a metabolic shift from anerobic glycolytic
  metabolism to aerobic oxidative metabolism, leading to increased oxygen consumption
  and ROS production. Elevated melanin associated with increased melanosome biogenesis
  can serve as a scavenger for excess ROS produced during a MAPKi-induced switch to
  oxidative phosphorylation. GPNMB is a transmembrane glycoprotein present in endosomes,
  late stage melanosomes and at the plasma membrane. Cell surface GPNMB is the target
  of the antibody-drug-conjugate, CDX-011 (Glembatumumab vedotin). The GPNMB:CDX-011
  complex is internalized and traffics to lysosomes, at which point the linked cytotoxin,
  monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), is liberated from the antibody by proteolytic cleavage
  of an amino-acid linker. MMAE is a potent inhibitor of tubulin dynamics and causes
  apoptotic cell death.
