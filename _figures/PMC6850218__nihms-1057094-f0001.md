caption: Model illustrating 4 potential roles of RGD-binding integrins in the initiation,
  development, and perpetuation of organ fibrosis. Acute or chronic tissue injury
  locally upregulates the expression of integrins such as αvβ6 on epithelial cells
  which is a potent activator of the latent TGF-β stored in the surrounding ECM. The
  activated cytokine binds to its receptor on unactivated fibroblasts and initiates
  a SMAD-dependent signaling pathway culminating in the induction of dozens of target
  genes including the subunits of other RGD integrins, collagen, and other fibrotic
  matrix components, inhibitors of matrix degradation, and a constellation of other
  factors that promote transdifferentiation to a myofibroblastic phenotype. Evidence
  suggests myofibroblasts have a predominantly perivascular origin and that αvβ5 may
  have an important role in their recruitment to sites of developing fibrosis in kidney.
  Growth factors such as CTGF are capable of interacting with integrins on the cell
  surface and may provide cooperative signaling with TGF-β in the developing fibrotic
  response. Myofibroblasts exhibit expression of additional αv-containing integrins
  capable of activating more latent TGF-β setting up a feed forward loop., The myofibroblast
  integrins also act as sensors of ECM composition and stiffness which is important
  for maintaining their phenotype and survival, thus preserving the fibrotic niche
  and inhibiting resolution. ECM, extracellular matrix; myoFB, myofibroblast; TIMPs,
  tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases; TGF-βR1/RII, transforming growth factor receptor-I/II.
