caption: 'Classical genomic pathway of estrogen receptor-alpha: proposed role of metals.
  In the absence of ligand, ERα is associated with a complex containing heat shock
  proteins and immunophilins that maintains the LBD in a high affinity, ligand binding
  conformation and prevents the receptor from dimerizing and binding to DNA and cofactors.
  Following the binding of metals, it is proposed that, similar to estradiol, the
  receptor is phosphorylated on serines in the A/B region that increases the activity
  of the AF-1 domain and a conformational change occurs in the LBD that results in
  the dissociation of the heat shock complex and the formation of the AF-2 domain,
  the coactivator binding site. The activated receptor then localizes in the nucleus,
  dimerizes, binds to an ERE, and recruits coactivators and RNA polymerase II to the
  promoters of target genes'
