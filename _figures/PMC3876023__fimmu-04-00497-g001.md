caption: 'Mechanisms of suppression of regulatory B cells identified in human and
  animal. In mice, regulatory B-cell suppression is fulfilled by IL-10 secretion,
  activation of the CD40 pathway, and probably via contact with T lymphocytes. It
  has numerous effects: (1) inhibition of Th1 and Th17 differentiation, (2) inhibition
  of antigen presentation by DCs, and (3) induction of natural regulatory T cells.
  For humans, the mechanisms for the actions of regulatory B cells remain unclear
  and have yet to be confirm: (1) Probable inhibition of proliferation of CD4+ T cells,
  (2) Possible inhibition of Th1 differentiation, and (3) possible increase of natural
  regulatory T cells.'
