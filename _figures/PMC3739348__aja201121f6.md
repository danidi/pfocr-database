caption: The expression of some genes related to the cell cycle and apoptosis were
  significantly changed after LM23 knockdown, as shown by microarray analysis. The
  downregulation of LM23 may block the G1/S and G2/M phase transitions of the spermatogenic
  cell. Both the Fas–FasL pathway and the mitochondrial pathway may be activated upon
  the downregulation of LM23 during spermatogenesis.
