caption: Possible metabolic route of anthocyanin modification pathway in Arabidopsis.
  The metabolic grid was constructed by expanding that of anthocyanin acylation in
  ;. Thin black/gray arrows indicate potential glucosylation (Glc), xylosylation (Xyl),
  coumaroylation (Cou), sinapoylation (Sin) and malonylation (Mal). Gray thick arrows
  indicate putative major anthocyanin modification routes. Open dotted arrows mean
  unlikely routes based on the corresponding enzymatic property. The structures of
  anthocyanins (A1–A11) are shown in . C3G; cyanidin3-O-glucosdie, C3G5G; cyanidin
  3,5-O-diglucosides, C3G2′′X; cyanidin 3-O-xylosyl(1→2)glucoside.
