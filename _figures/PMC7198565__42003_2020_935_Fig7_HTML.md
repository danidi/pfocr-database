caption: Restraint stress information, received by the central nervous system (CNS)
  and/or other sensing tissues, promotes expression of upd3 in peripheral somatic
  tissues. In germ cells, accumulated humoral Upd3 activates the JAK/STAT pathway,
  which subsequently activates the p38-dATF-2 pathway. Phosphorylated dATF-2 may be
  released from the promotor regions of its target genes, resulting in decreased H3K9me2
  levels. Epigenetic marks may be retained in mature sperm and inherited by offspring.
  After fertilization, histone marks may act as inheritable epigenetic memory and
  regulate gene expression. We observed that genes involved in the one-carbon metabolic
  pathway were upregulated in offspring from the paternal restraint stress-exposed
  fathers, while genes involved in the respiratory metabolic pathway were downregulated.
  We assume that paternal restraint stress-induced- and dATF-2-mediated upregulation
  of the one-carbon cycle induces downregulation of respiratory metabolism due to
  a trade-off relationship between these two metabolic processes.
