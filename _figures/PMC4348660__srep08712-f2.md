caption: 'The metabolic pathway for 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) biosynthesis in YSB20
  consists of: 1. succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), endogenous sucCD from E. coli; 3.
  succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), sucD from Porphyromonas gingivalis;
  4. 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (4HBD), 4hbd from P. gingivalis; 5. 4HB-CoA transferase
  (4HB-CoAT), cat2 from P. gingivalis; 6. 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA reductase, ald from
  Clostridium beijerinckii; and 7. alcohol dehydrogenase, endogenous adh from E. coli.
  The engineered 1,4-BDO biosynthetic pathway of YSB27 and W029-11 consists of 1.
  succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), endogenous sucCD from E. coli; 2. α-ketoglutarate
  decarboxylase, kgd from Corynebacterium glutamicum; 3. succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase
