caption: Graphical representation of the IL-6 signaling pathway reveals significant
  gene expression changes following sarin-induced seizure. Genes in the IL-6 signaling
  pathway at the 6 h time point for sarin-induced seizing animals are represented
  as nodes of various shapes to represent the functional class of the gene product,
  and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line. The
  intensity of the node color indicates the degree of up- (red) or down- (green) regulation.
  Nodes shown in gray represent genes from the dataset that did not meet the p-value
  cutoff, and nodes shown in white represent genes that are in IPA's Knowledge Base
  but not in the dataset.
