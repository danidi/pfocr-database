caption: 'Cytoskeletal modulation and signaling. A, Invading C. trachomatis is believed
  to secrete a cocktail of preformed effectors into the host cell and this is supported
  by the two discovered factors translocated actin recruiting phosphor protein (Tarp)
  and CT694. Tarp initiates multiple signaling cascades, i.e. its N-terminus is phosphorylated
  on several tyrosine residues (pY) and the C-terminally located actin binding domains
  (ABD) mediate actin nucleation and bundling. Signaling via the N-terminus leads
  to survival signaling via extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) as
  well as actin branching via son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) / abl-interactor 1
  (Abi1) / epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8) / WAS protein
  family, member 2 (WASF2 alternative name: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family
  member 2 - Wave2) and actin related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex. CT694 consists
  of a membrane binding domain (MBD) and an AHNAK nucleoprotein (AHNAK) binding region
  which probably links membrane to actin signaling. B, C. caviae and pneumoniae secrete
  Tarp which does not contain the N-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation domain. The
  C-terminal ABD motives are sufficient for actin bundling and nucleation and some
  of the functions linked to C. trachomatis Tarp might be executed via epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR). Activation of the small GTPases ras-related C3 botulinum
  toxin substrate 1 (rho family, small GTP binding protein Rac1) (Rac1) and cell division
  cycle 42 (GTP binding protein, 25 kDa) (CDC42) has been shown for C. caviae, the
  bacterial factors mediating this are not yet found. C. caviae also activates ADP-ribosylation
  factor 6 (Arf6), which in turn activates phosphatidyl-inositol-4-kinase (PI4K) and
  this might take over the membrane-actin modulating function of CT694.'
