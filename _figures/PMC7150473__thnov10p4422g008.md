caption: Schematic diagram of the regulatory network of YAP1-1 and YAP1-2. YAP1 expression
  and its intracellular localization are tightly regulated in response to various
  input signals including cell-cell contact. In the current study, systemic analysis
  and comparison of eight YAP1 isoforms were carried out and unveiled functional difference
  between the YAP1 subgroups and mechanism of differential regulation. At low density,
  both YAP1-1 and YAP1-2 protein isoforms can localize to nucleus to regulate target
  gene expression and promote proliferation, metastasis and stemness of cancer cells.
  However, at high cell density, activated Hippo pathway leads to YAP1 phosphorylation
  and cytoplasmic retention/sequestering. YAP1-2 with two WW domains is capable of
  forming de novo YAP1-2/LATS1/AMOT complex, rendering it more susceptible to LATS1/2
  phosphorylation and subsequent degradation via β-TRCP-mediated ubiquitination.
