caption: 'Autophagy and apoptosis: process and function. Autophagy and apoptosis may
  be triggered by common stimuli. As programmed cell survival, autophagy is an intracellular
  bulk degradation system, through which cytoplasmic component is delivered to lysosomes
  to be degraded. The main process of autophagy includes formation and maturation
  of the phagophore, autophagosome, and autolysosome. LC3, a mammalian homologue of
  yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing to LC3-II
  and can be degraded by autolysosome after binding adaptor protein p62. Autophagy
  provides amino acids and fatty acids for the synthesis of protein and ATP. In contrast,
  apoptosis is programmed cell death. There are two main pathways to control apoptosis.
  The extrinsic pathway is mediated by death receptors such as Fas/CD95. The intrinsic
  mitochondrial pathway is controlled by Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bax and other
  regulators, such as p53. Caspase 3 is a caspase protein that is activated by caspase
  8 and caspase 9, and in turn, mediates substrate cleavage and cell destruction.'
