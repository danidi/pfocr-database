caption: Control of the GAL genes by glucose in a gal80 background. In the presence
  of glucose, the Mig1 complex is active and decreases the rate of synthesis of GAL4
  mRNA. The resulting low level of Gal4, together with the repressing effect of the
  Mig1 complex, leads to a very low level of expression of the GAL genes. For the
  Mig1 complex to exert its repressing activity, the Glc7 complex and elements in
  the glucose signalling pathway, such as Grr1 and Hxk2, are required. In the absence
  of glucose, the Snf1 complex is activated (see Fig. ) and is able to release repression
  by Mig1; this allows maximal expression of GAL4, and the elevated levels of Gal4,
  together with the lack of activity of Mig1, turn on completely the expression of
  the GAL genes.
