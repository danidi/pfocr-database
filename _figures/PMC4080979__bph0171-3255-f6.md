caption: Model of ‘synthetic lethal addiction’ to rationalize selective synergy of
  PI103 and Ku-0063794 in PIK3CA mutant cells cultured in LG conditions. In PIK3CA
  wild-type cells, PI3K activates AKT, mTOR, S6, 4EBP1, protein translation and glycolysis
  (black arrows). In PIK3CA mutant cells, additional activation of AKT, mTOR, S6,
  4EBP1, protein translation and glycolysis occurs (red arrows). Under glucose deprivation
  and in cells with enhanced glycolysis, GLUT1 levels are increased, leading to activation
  of mTOR signalling, protein translation and glycolysis (blue arrows). Synergy between
  PI103 and Ku-0063794 is observed only in PIK3CA mutant cells grown in LG conditions
  as these cells are dependent on hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. PIK3CA
  mutant cells cultured in HG conditions or PIK3CA wild-type cells in LG or HG conditions
  are less dependent on PI3K/mTOR activation, and hence the dual blockade of the PI3K/mTOR
  pathway is less detrimental. Autophagy occurs in cells with synergy due to the inhibition
  of mTOR.
