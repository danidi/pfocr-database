caption: Microbiota-triggered EMT via E-cadherin/β-catenin. (a) In normal epithelial
  tissues, β-catenin activity is kept at low levels by degradation of the β-catenin
  cytoplasmic pool upon binding to the APC/Axin/GSK3β complex, or by membrane retention
  of β-catenin by interaction with E-cadherin. (b) Opportunistic infections by various
  pathogens, such as F. nucleatum in the human colon, can promote malignant progression.
  The virulence factor FadA is expressed on the surface of F. nucleatum. It binds
  to and induces phosphorylation/internalization of E-cadherin with consequent disruption
  of cell-cell junctions. Release of β-catenin from the plasma membrane and further
  activation of the Wnt signaling pathway (phosphorylation/degradation of GSK3β and
  disassembly of the APC/Axin/GSK3β complex) then occur, leading to enhanced cancer
  cell EMT and invasion. Top panels have been modified from Servier Medical Art, licensed
