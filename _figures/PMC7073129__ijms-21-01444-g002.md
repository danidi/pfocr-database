  (CRABP II) and binds to the RAR/RXR complex. Binding of the inverse agonist supports
  corepressor recruitment. The receptor complex subsequently inhibits target gene
  expression at the promoter area RARE. The consequently reduced expression of Wnts
  and Wnt receptors and coreceptors decreases hypertrophic differentiation [,,]. RAR,
