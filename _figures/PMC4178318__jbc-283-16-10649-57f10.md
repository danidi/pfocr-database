caption: Schematic of Rab23 functions in chondrogenic cells. Chondrogenic cells can
  be induced to undergo differentiation either through insulin or hedgehog pathway.
  Overexpression of Rab23 is able to disrupt insulin signaling and thus blocks up-regulation
  of Sox9. On the other hand, expression of Gli1 is dependent on Rab23 in these cells.
  Gli1 in turn controls expression of Sox9. Knockdown of Rab23 leads to down-regulation
  of Gli1, resulting in a decrease in Sox9 and a failure of chondrogenic differentiation.
