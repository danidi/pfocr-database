caption: 'The pheromone response pathway. (A) The pheromone response pathway obtained
  from KEGG. The darker nodes indicate nodes in the KEGG pheromone response pathway
  but not detected by CASCADE_SCAN. (B) The CASCADE_SCAN output for the pheromone
  response pathway (74% recall and 82% precision). The darker nodes indicate detected
  by CASCADE_SCAN but not in the KEGG pheromone response pathway. (PPI score threshold:
  0.800, credible PPI score threshold: 0.980, DFS path length: 2, seed proteins: CDC24,
  DIG1, FAR1 and STE4).'
