caption: Proposed generalized model for differential induction of apoptosis by p53
  and p73 under DNA-damage versus metabolic stress. In response to DNA damage, p73
  can activate the apoptotic pathway in the absence of p53, and thus backup p53 function
  (diamond pattern). In contrast, the apoptotic response under metabolic stress requires
  the presence of p53, and p73 serves to support its function (C1-FFL)
