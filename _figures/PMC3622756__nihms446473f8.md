caption: (A) In normal conditions, activation of growth factor receptors (GFR) lead
  to activation of the MAPK (ERK) pathway mainly through B-Raf. In this condition
  Raf-1 is repressed by RKIP and only marginally participates in the signaling. (B)
  When B-Raf is depleted or deficient, signaling through MAPK is severely hindered
  since RKIP prevents full activation of Raf-1 and downstream phosphorylation of ERK.
  (C) When RKIP and B-Raf are deficient or depleted, signaling to ERK occurs through
  Raf-1. The thickness of the blue arrows is proportional to the intensity of the
  signaling.
