caption: Model for the regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by Bcl-2 family members.
  (A) In healthy cells, Bax is inactivated by Bcl-xL (and Bcl-2), whereas Bak is sequestered
  by Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. (B) Via the caspase-8 tBid signaling pathway, TRAIL activates
  the proapoptotic Bax through neutralization of the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL. In contrast,
  the antiapoptotic Mcl-1, which is not targeted by tBid, keeps Bak in check. Down-regulation
  of Mcl-1 by RNA interference or targeted therapeutics, like sorafenib or roscovitine,
  enables TRAIL to activate Bak.
