caption: Proposed pathway for moenomycin biosynthesis. Solid arrows indicate the order
  of moenomycin assembly. Structural components shown in red, green and blue indicate
  the positions of new moieties in the biosynthetic intermediates. Asterisks (*) indicate
  biologically active compounds. Structures shown are consistent with exact mass and
  MS2 fragmentation data. Stereochemical assignments are consistent with the extensive
  body of literature on moenomycins isolated from fermentation broths.(, ) We cannot
  exclude the possibility that the tailoring enzymes are able to act at multiple points
  during assembly.
