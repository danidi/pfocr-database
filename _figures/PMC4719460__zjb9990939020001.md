caption: 'E. coli''s single-cell response to the sugars l-arabinose and d-xylose.
  (A) A population of E. coli cells exposed to intermediate amounts of both sugars
  diverges into four subpopulations: uninduced cells, cells with the l-arabinose utilization
  pathway induced, cells with the d-xylose utilization pathway induced, and cells
  with both pathways induced. The fraction of each subpopulation depends on the concentrations
  of l-arabinose and d-xylose. (B) The two utilization pathways repress each other.
  In the presence of l-arabinose, AraC represses the expression of the d-xylose catabolic
  genes. In the presence of d-xylose, XylR represses the expression of araC.'
