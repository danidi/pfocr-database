caption: '(A) Tyrosine is produced through an overproducing metabolically modified
  machinery of the primary metabolism (Juminaga et al. 2012) and serves as the main
  precursor channeled to (B) the newly introduced hydroxytyrosol (HT) pathway able
  to transform tyrosine into HT. Double-dashed lines depict E. coli’s outer membrane.
  Dotted arrows depict multiple reaction steps. Due to the dual specificity of the
  utilized aromatic acetaldehyde synthase (AAS) cloned from parsley, and to tyrosinase
  (TYR), cloned from Ralstonia solanacearum, a dual pathway is generated. The “monophenol
  route” (blue) pathway portrays the enzymatic route for HT biosynthesis deriving
  from the decarboxylation-deamination of tyrosine, while the “diphenol route” (red)
  pathway portrays the HT route deriving from the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
  (DOPA). Gene-respective enzyme abbreviations: AAS, aromatic acetaldehyde synthase.
  ALR, aldehyde reductase. AroA, 5-enolpyruvoylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase. AroB,
  dehydroquinate synthase. AroC, chorismate synthase. AroD, dehydroquinate dehydratase.
  AroE, shikimate dehydrogenase. AroG, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate synthase. AroL,
  shikimate kinase. DDC, DOPA decarboxylase. feaB, phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase,
  MAO, monoamine oxidase. PpsA, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase. TDC, tyrosine decarboxylase.
  TktA, transketolase A. TYR, tyrosinase. TyrA, chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase.
  TyrB, tyrosine aminotransferase. YdiB, quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (see further
  details in ). Bold abbreviations denote the genes that were utilized in this study.'
