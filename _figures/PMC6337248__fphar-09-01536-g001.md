caption: 'Intracellular signaling pathways that regulate Nrf2. In basal conditions,
  (A) Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Keap1 by two motifs (ETGE and DLG), which
  are essential to recruit Nrf2. Keap1 works as a dimeric redox sensitive substrate
  adaptor for cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, which inhibits the transcriptional
  activity of Nrf2 via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This signaling
  is known as canonical pathway. (B) Alternatively, Nrf2 is also regulated by a non-canonical
  pathway. The phosphorylation of Nrf2 by GSK-3 facilitates its recognition by β-TrCP,
  leading to Cul1-mediated ubiquitination, followed by Nrf2 proteasome degradation.
  Under oxidative stress or pathological conditions, (C,D) Keap1-CUL3 ubiquitin E3
  ligase activity decreases and Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1. Nrf2 translocates to
  the nucleus and heterodimerizes with small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (Maf)
  protein and binds to DNA and other transcription partners to setting up a nuclear
  complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcM2. These nuclear complexes formed
  with Nrf2 induce the expression of the ARE-gene battery, such as: NQO1, HMOX1, GCL,
  GSTs, CAT, SOD, and thioredoxin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. (E) The multifunctional
  protein p62 and LC3 acts by sequestration of Keap1, which culminates in its autophagic
  degradation. As a consequence, Nrf2 can translocate to the nucleus and activate
  ARE.'
