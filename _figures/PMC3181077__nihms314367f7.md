caption: Model depicting the potential impact of Grx1 on prolonging activation of
  NF-κB. In response to stimulation with LPS, S-glutathionylation (PSSG) of IKKβ is
  important to shut down the activity of NF-κB. Activation of the Glrx1 gene via canonical
  NF-κB activation prevents the accumulation of IKKβ-SSG, thereby prolonging activation
  of the NF-κB pathway, and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Note that
  Grx1-catalyzed deglutathionylation results in the formation of protein sulfhydryl
  groups (P-SH). It is plausible that in addition to IKKβ, other members of the NF-κB
  pathway are regulated via S-glutathionylation and Grx1-catalyzed deglutationylation
  (not shown).
