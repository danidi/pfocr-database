caption: 'In the TME, APCs present tumor antigens to naïve T cells and induce T-cell
  activation. The MHC and TCR signaling pathway provide the first signal for T-cell
  activation, while co-inhibitory immune checkpoints collaborate to suppress T-cell
  activation in the TME. Immune checkpoints are presented on T cells. Ligands are
  expressed on APCs, tumor cells and other stromal cells, such as CAFs and MDSCs.
  Abbreviations: TME = tumor microenvironment; APCs = antigen presenting cells; MDSCs
  = myeloid-derived suppressor cells; CAFs = cancer-associated fibroblasts; MHC =
  major histocompatibility complex; TCR = T-cell receptor; PD-1 = programmed death
  1; PD-L1 = programmed cell death ligand-1; PD-L2 = programmed cell death ligand-2;
  LAG-3 = lymphocyte activation gene-3; CTLA-4 = cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4;
  VISTA = V-domain immunoglobulin-containing suppressor of T-cell activation; HHLA2
  = human endogenous retrovirus-H long terminal repeat-associating protein 2; TIM-3
  = T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3; Gal-9 = Galectin-9; MDSCs = myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells'
