caption: Effect of heparin on the GEF-H1/RhoA/ROCK/p27 signaling pathway in inhibition
  of PASMC proliferation. Under normal physiopathological condition, the GEF-H1/RhoA/ROCK/p27
  signaling pathway regulates a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation.
  Growth stimulus, including hypoxia, can stimulate GEF-H1 activity, which catalyzes
  the change of GDP for GTP to generate GTP-RhoA. GTP-RhoA consequently activates
  its downstream effecter, ROCK, and then ROCK degrades p27, which eventually results
  in PASMC proliferation and development of pulmonary hypertension. Heparin inhibits
  PASMC proliferation and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension through inhibiting GEF-H1,
  which results in a decrease in GTP-RhoA and ROCK. The decrease in ROCK attenuates
  degradation of p27, which then results in an increase in p27. Dashed arrows, growth
  stimulation; solid arrows, heparin treatment.
