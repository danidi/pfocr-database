caption: 'The role of the opposing activities of RNF8-RNF168 (ubiquitination) and
  OTUB2 (deubiquitination). (A) OTUB2 fine-tunes RNF8-dependent ubiquitination and
  suppresses the recruitment of excessive RNF168, RAP80 and 53BP1 to DSB sites, enabling
  the proper choice of DNA-repair pathway. (B) Accelerated RNF8-dependent ubiquitination
  results in excessive accumulation of RNF168, RAP80 and 53BP1, in turn promoting
  NHEJ and suppressing HR. Ub: ubiquitin.'
