caption: Intestinal epithelial barrier function plays an essential role in maintaining
  intestinal health. Physical and biochemical barriers, including tight junctions,
  immunoglobulin A, antimicrobial peptides, mucus, and the ILC3-IL-22 pathway, maintain
  intestinal epithelial barrier function. This is essential to maintain anatomic segregation
  between commensal bacteria and the mammalian immune system. Loss of this physical
  segregation can promote dysregulated innate and adaptive immune cell responses.
  Identified genetic variants that result in a loss or gain of function mutation and
  are associated with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease are noted in orange
  boxes.
