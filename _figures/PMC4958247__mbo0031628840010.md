caption: Proposed model for E. chaffeensis TRP120-mediated activation of canonical
  Notch signaling pathway and inhibition of TLR2/4 expression. (Step 1) E. chaffeensis
  TRP120 effector interaction with ADAM17 activates the metalloprotease, resulting
  in cleavage of the substrate Notch1, and subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase causes
  (step 2) nuclear translocation of NICD, the transcriptionally active form of which
  binds with RBPjκ and MAML proteins. This triprotein complex activates transcription
  of Notch target genes, which causes inhibition of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways
  (step 3). The downstream transcription factor PU.1 expression is repressed, which
  causes further inhibition of monocyte TLR2/4 expression (step 4). Inhibition of
  TLR2/4 expression causes both inhibition of E. chaffeensis recognition and TLR-mediated
  proinflammatory cytokine production needed for the activation of monocytes and clearance
  of ehrlichiae.
