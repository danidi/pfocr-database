caption: Model depicting the role of CAS/Crk and ERK signaling pathways in mediating
  cell migration and suppressing apoptosis during invasion of the ECM. Interaction
  of cells with adhesive proteins and growth factors/cytokines present in the ECM
  facilitate integrin and cytokine receptor activation on the cell surface. This initiates
  two distinct intracellular signaling pathways that control migration and suppress
  apoptosis as cells invade the ECM. Pathway One shows that ligation of integrin and
  cytokine receptors facilitate CAS tyrosine phosphorylation and the coupling of Crk
  to Cas via its SH2 domain (hatched box). FAK and src represent two potential upstream
  tyrosine kinases that mediate CAS/Crk coupling in migratory cells. DOCK180 is an
  effector molecule that specifically binds to the SH3 domain of Crk and regulates
  Rac activity. The CAS/Crk/DOCK180 protein module serves, in a Rac-dependent manner,
  as a critical signaling complex required for maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton
  and cell shape changes necessary for cellular invasion and survival. Additional
  signaling pathways downstream of Rac that may also operate to support survival during
  cell invasion are shown. These include inhibition of BAD and caspase 9 by Akt as
  well as gene transcriptional elements regulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) burst oxidase and NF-κB. Interestingly, work in this study revealed
  that Rac activation alone in cells, in the absence of a CAS/Crk complex, is not
  sufficient to facilitate these cellular responses. Therefore, an additional effector
  molecule(s) and signaling pathway(s) must be associated with CAS/Crk that works
  in conjunction with Rac to induce cell migration and suppress apoptosis (black box).
  Integrin- and cytokine receptor–mediated Ras/ERK activation represents a separate
  pathway capable of mediating cell migration and suppressing apoptosis during invasion
  of the ECM. Once ERK is phosphorylated (ERK-P) and activated by MEK, it can directly
  phosphorylate MLCK (MLCK-P), which phosphorylates MLC (MLC-P). MLC-P can then associate
  with actin, leading to cell contraction and invasion. Work in this study indicates
  that ERK-mediated cell invasion, but not survival, requires MLCK activity. Although
  little is known regarding the specific signals that facilitate ERK-induced survival
  in migratory cells, recent work by others indicates that ERK activation in cells
  leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD and its dissociation from Bcl family
  members. The uncoupling of these proteins increases the ratio of Bcl to Bax, which
  facilitates protection from apoptosis through mechanisms that are not yet understood.
  hid is a death-effector gene discovered in Drosophila that induces cell apoptosis
  by activating caspases. Interestingly, ERK can directly phosphorylate and inactivate
  hid and protect cells from apoptosis in this system. Although the mammalian homologue
  of this gene has not been identified, it is possible that a hid-like protein exists
  in mammalian cells which is inhibited during invasion of the ECM in an ERK-dependent
  manner. Alternatively, activated ERK is well known to translocate to the nucleus
  and regulate gene transcription processes important for cell cycle progression,
  leading to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.
