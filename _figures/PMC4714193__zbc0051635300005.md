caption: Proposed signaling pathway for MTII-LRP chemotaxis. MTII binds LRP1 and LRP2,
  which engage in receptor cross-talk, recruiting TrkA. This pathway likely activates
  Ca2+ channels and release of Ca2+ from internal stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum,
  resulting in a large change in intracellular Ca2+ levels. This would activate CaMKII
  and PKA and culminate in growth cone attraction. In the event of a loss of LRP1
  or LRP2, the receptor cross-talk cannot occur, and, therefore, there is no growth
  cone turning. If TrkA is inhibited, then it is likely that a small influx of Ca2+
  occurs through a TrkA-independent LRP1/2-dependent process, activating calcineurin
  and the repulsive pathway.
