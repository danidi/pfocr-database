caption: Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). The CAP links the nervous system
  and immune system. The activity of afferent vagus nerve fibers is stimulated by
  cytokines and pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules. The signal activates
  efferent vagus nerve fibers through the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and dorsal
  motor nucleus of the vagus in the brain. The efferent vagus nerve (cholinergic)
  stimulates CD4 T cells in spleen via the splenic sympathetic (adrenergic) nerve.
  Release of norepinephrine binds to β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) on CD4 T cells,
  which then elicits release of acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binding to alpha 7 nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) on macrophages produces an anti-inflammatory
  response, such as TNF-α suppression. Ultrasound and C1 neuron stimulation also activate
  the pathway and produce organ protective effects.
