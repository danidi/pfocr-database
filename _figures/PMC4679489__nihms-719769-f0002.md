caption: 'TLRs signal through MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways.1) MyD88
  signaling pathway. After ligand binding at the plasma membrane (TLR2/1, TLR2/6,
  TLR4/MD-2 and TLR5) or endocytic vesicles (TLR7, TLR8, TLR9), TLRs recruit the adaptor
  molecule MyD88 to their TIR domains. TLR2/1, TLR2/6, TLR4/MD-2 also recruit the
  MyD88 adapter like protein (MAL) or also called TIR domain-containing adaptor protein
  (TIRAP). MyD88 consists of two domains: a TIR domain, which interacts with the TIR
  domain of toll-like receptors and a death domain. The death domain of MyD88 recruits
  IRAK proteins 1, 2, 4, which recruit TRAF6 to the receptor complex. Phosphorylated
  IRAK1 and TRAF6 then dissociate from the receptor and form a complex with TAK1,
  TAB1 and TAB2 at the plasma membrane, which induces the phosphorylation of TAB2
  and TAK1.Following TAK1 and TAB1 phosphorylation, IRAK1 is degraded at the plasma
  membrane, and the remaining complex (consisting of TRAF6, TAK1, TAB1 and TAB2) translocate
  to the cytosol leading to the ubiquitination of TRAF6, and activation of TAK1. Activated
  TAK1 modulates the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two kinase subunits
  (IKKα and IKKβ) and a regulatory subunit termed IKKγ or NEMO (NFκB essential modulator).
  In resting cells, IκB is bound to NFκB avoiding the translocation of NFκB to the
  nucleus. Activation of IKK leads to phosphorylation of IκBs, which trigger their
  polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation and subsequently, releasing NFκB
  to translocate to the nucleus. AK1 also activates the MAP kinase kinase MKK3/6-p38
  signaling cascade, leading to cAMP response element binding (CREB) nuclear transcription
  factor activation and the MKK4/7-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediated activation
  of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). AP-1 in concert with NFκB
  activates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and MHC costimulatory
  molecules. 2) TRIF signaling pathway. After activation of TLR4 and TLR3, TRIF are
  recruited to their TIR domains. TRAM (TRIF-adaptor molecule) is another adaptor
  recruited to the TIR domain of TLR4. Subsequently IKKε (also known as inducible
  IKK (IKKi) and TBK1 and TRAF3 are recruited to the TRIF/TIR or TRAM/TRIF/TIR complexes.
  TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7, which activate, in complex with p300 and CBP
  (CREB binding protein), the expression of interferon inducible genes, IP-10 and
  RANTES. TRIF can also bind TRAF6 and activate a late production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines through NFκB activation.'
