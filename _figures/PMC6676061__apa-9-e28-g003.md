caption: . Abnormal interactions between allergen and the host immune system in gastrointestinal
  tissue in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) pathogenesis. Antigen presenting cells
  present food allergens as major histocompatibility complex class II conjugates to
  T-cell receptors on naive T cells. T cells then differentiate into T-helper type
  1 (Th1) or Th17 cells, which secrete different pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
  cytokines leading to recruitment of humoral and cellular factors of innate immunity.
  In healthy tissues (left), immune homeostasis is maintained by interdependent control
  exerted by sufficient Treg cells. In mucosal response in EoE (right), dysfunctional
  regulation of Th1 or Th17 pathways triggers an unregulated inflammatory response
  and recruitment of innate immune cells. Cytokine levels elevation can promote oxidative
  tissue damage and facilitate proteolytic peptides and enzymes recruitments, eventually
  presenting as gastrointestinal disease. Furthermore, enactment Th2 pathway can prompt
  plasma cells identifying fungal cell wall antigens and delivering antiglycan antibodies
  production. IL, interleukin; NKT, natural killer T; ICAM, intercellular adhesion
  molecule; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule.
