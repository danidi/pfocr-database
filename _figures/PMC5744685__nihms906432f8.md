caption: Methionine is an essential amino acid that can be used for methylation reactions,
  cysteine synthesis, and polyamine generation. Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Methyl transferases utilize SAM as
  the methyl donor for many methylation reactions in cells. Demethylation of SAM generates
  S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is hydrolyzed to homocysteine (HCys) and adenosine.
  Methionine is regenerated from homocysteine by transfer of the methyl group from
  N5-methyl-THF (CH3-THF). Homocysteine is also an intermediate of cysteine synthesis,
  where serine and homocysteine condense and form cysteine via the transsulfuration
  pathway. SAM can also support polyamine synthesis when SAM is decarboxylated to
  form S-adenosylmethioninamine, also known as decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine
  (dcSAM). Together with the urea cycle metabolite ornithine, this compound generates
  putrescine and subsequently spermine and spermidine. In these reactions, dcSAM is
  converted to 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA). Accumulation of MTA inhibits the enzyme
  protein arginine N-methyltrasferase 5 (PRMT5), which uses SAM as a methyl donor
  to synthesize symmetrical dimethylarginine (sDMA) from arginine. In the methionine
  cycle, MTA is cleaved to 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR) and adenine by the
  enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). Adenine can be converted to AMP,
  and the adenosine analogue L-alanosine can limit AMP production via the purine synthesis
  pathway. MTR can be converted to methionine, completing the methionine cycle.
