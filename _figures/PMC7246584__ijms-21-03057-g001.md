caption: 'Interplay between HCV-induced oncogenic signaling pathways. EGF pathway:
  HCV binding to its entry receptor complex (i.e., CLDN1/CD81) induces EGFR phosphorylation.
  This is sustained by the action of NS3/4A and NS5A which negatively regulate the
  phosphatase TC-PTP and the process of EGFR degradation, respectively. Additionally,
  HCV replication has been linked to the increased expression of EGF and activation
  of the TGF-β pathway, both contributing to EGFR signaling. STAT3 pathway: STAT3
  activation results from the direct action of the core protein and indirectly via
  EGFR activation and the NS5A protein, which favors the production of ROS. Moreover,
  HCV employs miR-135a-5p and miR-19a to decrease the expression of the negative STAT3
  regulators PTPRD and SOCS3, respectively. TGF-β pathway: HCV induces the activation
  of the TGF-β pathway by intermediary of the UPR, which favors NF-κB activity and
  via the core protein, which directly interacts with SMAD3. The HCV-mediated expression
  of endoglin (CD105) favors activation of the TGF-β pathway and the induction of
  angiogenesis signaling. VEGF pathway: HCV core induces the activation of HIF-1α,
  which leads to an increased expression of VEGF. Similarly, an increased VEGF expression
  is promoted by HCV via the STAT3-dependent activation of androgen receptor. Abbreviations:
