caption: The taurine degradation pathway of Bilophila wadsworthia. Bilophila wadsworthia
  is the only known intestinal microbe that uses taurine as an electron acceptor for
  anaerobic respiration. The first two enzymatic reactions result in sulfite production.
  Sulfite is subsequently converted to H2S by a dissimilatory sulfite reductase that
  differs structurally from those used by sulfate-reducing bacteria.
