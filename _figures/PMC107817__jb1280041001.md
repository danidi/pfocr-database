caption: The split pathway of m-DAP synthesis for the formation of m-DAP and l-lysine
  as present in C. glutamicum. On the left is shown the succinylase variant, on the
  right the dehydrogenase variant. Some bacteria have only the succinylase or dehydrogenase
  variant. The third acetylase variant is comparable to the succinylase variant but
  uses acetyl groups instead of succinyl groups. SuccCoA, succinyl coenzyme A; CoA,
  coenzyme A.
