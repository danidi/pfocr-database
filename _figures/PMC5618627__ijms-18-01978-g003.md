caption: The HSP40 family member, DNAJB6a (MRJ), prevents tumor formation through
  inhibition of the Wnt pathway. Upon Wnt protein ligands like Wnt8, Wnt1 and Wnt3a
  binding to the cell surface receptor complex of Frizzled and LRP5/6, cytoplasmic
  β-catenin is stabilized followed by nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, β-catenin
  binds its cofactor TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor) leading to
  transcription of specific target genes such as osteopontin and muscle segment homebox
  1 (MSX1) ultimately promoting cancer growth and metastasis, through induction of
  epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). DNAJB6a reverses the EMT and inhibits this
  pathway by activating GSK3β. DNAJB6 is chaperone for a multiprotein complex containing
  another chaperone HSP70 and PP2A, a phosphatase that activates glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 β (GSK3β) by dephosphorylation. Active GSK3β in turn promotes β-catenin
  proteosomal degradation forming a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
  gene product, casein kinase 1α (CK1α) and a scaffolding protein Axin, ultimately
  inhibiting the tumor growth and metastasis. DNAJB6 mediated β-catenin degradation
  is therefore also responsible for downregulation of β-catenin-dependent transcription
  of MSX1, which in turn is a repressor of dickkopf 1 homologue (DKK1) transcription,
  a secreted Wnt signaling inhibitor. Thus, reduced MSX1 expression upregulates DKK1
  expression establishing a feed-forward repression loop to check on Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling.
