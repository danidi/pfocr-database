caption: It represents genes involved in salinity-stress signaling pathways and tolerant
  mechanisms in the salt-tolerant mutant genotype in response to 300 mM salt (six
  hours of exposure) in comparison to the wild-type genotype. After entrance of Na+
  to cell cytoplasm, the activity of RBOH NADPH oxidase was increased to promote ROS
  formation and cytosolic Ca2+ content []. Ca2+ activated SOS3 and then SOS2, leading
  to SOS1-mediated Na+ extrusion []. On the other hand, NHX1 was activated by SOS3/SOS2
  complex via HVA and HVP pumps, providing the driving force to sequester Na+ from
  cytosol to vacuole []. Moreover, TPK1/KCO1 is an important vacuolar permeable channel
  for K+ extrusion from vacuole to cytoplasm contributing to homeostasis regulation.
  Salt stress magnifies the activity of protein kinases in MAP kinase pathway to produce
  ethylene []. Ethylene can promote K+ retention through K+ channels, such as HAK
  and HKT to regulate Na+ and K+ homeostasis [].
