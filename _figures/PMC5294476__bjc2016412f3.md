caption: Paradigms of cancer–immune cell interactions. (A) Tryptophan metabolism yields
  the intermediate kynurenine, which promotes glioblastoma development by activating
  the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a transcription factor that controls the expression
  of pro-tumorigenic genes. A downstream product of further kynurenine catabolism
  is NAD, which, among others, is an essential co-factor for the DNA repair enzyme
  poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Suppression of NAD synthesis by oncogenic signalling
  in liver tumours leads to increased genomic instability, thereby promoting tumorigenesis.
  Th17 cell differentiation can be influenced by tryptophan metabolites and Th17-mediated
  inflammation has been implicated in liver cancer. Whether tryptophan metabolism
  in cancer cells influences tumour progression by modulating immune cells remains
  to be seen. (B) Metabolic competition for glucose between cancer cells and tumour-infiltrating
  T cells. In the proximity of highly glycolytic cancer cells, T cells fail to sustain
  cytoplasmic calcium levels necessary to activate the NFAT transcription factor,
  which mediates anti-tumour responses of T cells. The immunosuppressive molecule
  PD-L1 in cancer cells, may further promote glucose metabolism by signalling through
  the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, in addition to suppressing T
  cells via interaction with PD-1. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NFAT, nuclear factor
  of activated T cells; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; PD-L1, PD ligand 1;
