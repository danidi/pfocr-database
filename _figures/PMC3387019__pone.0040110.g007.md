caption: The pure stretch of volume overload induces cardiac kallikrein-kinin upregulation
  from cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts that result in increased ISF bradykinin and
  activate kinin B2 receptor. Kallikrein and kinin cause mast cell degranulation.
  Mast cell degranulation causes the release of proteolytic enzymes like tryptase
  and chymase, as well as other cytokines that activate MMPs. Chymase also can activate
  kallikreins, MMPs and degrade collagen and non-collagen extracellular matrix components,
  such as fibronectin. The increase in bradykinin can further decrease extracellular
  matrix synthesis. Furthermore, tissue kallikreins can activate the kinin B2 receptor
  in the absence of kininogen. Because the kininogen substrate is abundant in plasma
  and tissues, the expression and availability of tissue kallikrein are the rate-limiting
  factors in kinin production.
