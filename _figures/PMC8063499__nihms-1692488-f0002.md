caption: Signaling pathways that intrinsically regulate GSC self-renewal and cystoblast
  differentiation. Ecdysone levels are increased due to sex peptide, which is deposited
  during mating and made in later stage follicles. Ecdysone is received in cap cells
  (pink) and GSCs (dark green). Terminal filament cells (purple) secrete the ligand
  Unpaired (Upd) to cap cells to stimulate the Jak/Stat pathway. The Jak/Stat pathway
  and ecdysone signaling regulate BMP signaling. EcR/Usp binds to Tai to control cap
  cell function. EcR regulates the BMP signaling pathway to regulate GSC self-renewal.
  The BMP ligands Gbb and Dpp are secreted from cap cells to the receptors on GSCs.
  This phosphorylates Mad, which will dimerize with Med and repress bam transcription.
  Ecdysone targets are intrinsically required to maintain GSC self-renewal. In differentiating
  CBs (light green) bam is transcribed and represses E-cadherin and Nos thereby committing
  the cell to differentiation.
