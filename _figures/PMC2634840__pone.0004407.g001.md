caption: '(A) Qualitative network showing mutual antagonism between AKT and p53. An
  arrow means a pathway that leads to activation or upregulation; a hammerhead represents
  inhibition or downregulation. AKT is antagonized by p53 via edges 1–3, and p53 is
  antagonized by AKT via edges 4–5. A p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop is shown by
  edges 5 and 6. (B) The oscillatory p53-AKT model (the Model). The rate expressions
  vi''s are given in . Note: mdm2 and pten denote mRNAs of MDM2 and PTEN gene, respectively.
  Mechanisms of the p53-AKT mutual antagonism: the network is activated by two cellular
  events namely growth factor stimulation and cellular stress. The former leads to
  phosphorylation of PIP2 (phosphatidyl inositol-4,5-bisphosphate) to PIP3 (Phosphatidyl
  inositol 3,4,5. triphosphate) and thereby PIP3-mediated activation of AKT . Active
  AKT (AKTa) phosphorylates MDM2 leading to MDM2a translocation to the nucleus  where
  it inhibits p53, and thereby promotes cell survival –. Under cellular stress however,
  transcriptionally active p53 induces PTEN – among other target genes . PTEN antagonizes
  AKT-mediated cell survival by deactivating PIP3 through efficient dephosphorylation
  . p53-dependent transcription of PTEN upon irradiation-induced DNA damage has been
  reported in MCF-7 (human breast cancer epithelial), A172 (human glioblastoma), MEF
  (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) and tissues of mouse small intestine, colon, kidney
  and liver – where p53 oscillations are also observed , –, .'
