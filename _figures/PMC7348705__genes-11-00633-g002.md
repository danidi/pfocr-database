caption: The schematic diagram describes the differential phosphorylation status of
  NRT1.1.1T101 at plasma membrane (PM) in the Arabidopsis root, modified by []. The
  layout represents the two binding sites’ low affinity (LA) and high affinity (HA)
  of T101A. The T101A mutant at the LA binding site follows the NRT1.1-ANR1 signaling
  pathway upon prolonged exposure to the NO3− under low-nitrate conditions, resulting
  in LR elongation. This is a nonphosphorylated form of NRT1.1-induced signaling that
  promotes LRs. In the inserted graph, the grey line represents the weak upregulation
  of NRT2.1 under low nitrate, and the blue line represents the strong upregulation
  of NRT2.1 under high nitrate. The graphs on the left and right represent the NRT2.1
  induction; see text for more details.
