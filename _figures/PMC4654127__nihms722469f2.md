caption: 'The normal homeostatic regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary pathways
  due to stimulatory (+) and inhibitory (−) signals is shown. i.e., for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  pathway, the hypothalamus releases CRH, which stimulates (+) the secretion of ACTH
  from the pituitary gland. The ACTH then stimulates (+) release of cortisol from
  the adrenal glands. The cortisol would then send negative feedback signals (−) to
  both the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to inhibit the any further release of
  CRH and ACTH respectively. Similar homeostastic regulation occurs with the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid
  and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes. Abbreviations: ACTH - adrenocorticotroic
  hormone, CRH - corticotropin-releasing hormone, FSH – follicle-stimulating hormone,
  LH - luteinizing hormone, TSH - thyroid-stimulating hormone, T3 - triiodothyronine,
  T4 - thyroxine. Figure was adapted and modified from original ().'
