caption: Antigen presentation pathway altered in disease. Expression of components
  of the antigen presentation pathway in nephritis compared with asymptomatic tissue.
  Green colour indicates higher level of expression in disease. The names of the genes
  are in "nodes". The shape of the nodes is related to gene function/family membership.
  The lines between the nodes represent the connectivity between genes. Solid lines
  indicate direct protein-protein interactions. Dotted lines represent indirect interactions.
