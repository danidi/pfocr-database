caption: Model of Arc function in mGluR-LTD. Group I mGluRs activate eEF2K via calcium–calmodulin
  (CaM). eEF2K phosphorylates eEF2, which inhibits elongation generally but rapidly
  increases de novo Arc translation. Arc forms a complex with endophilin2/3 (Endo)
  and dynamin (Dyn) and induces the internalization of AMPAR. FMRP inhibits the translation
  of Arc at the basal state. Arc induction alone is not sufficient for mGluR-LTD,
  indicating that mGluR activates another pathway that is required to internalize
  AMPAR. In Fmr1 KO mice, the synthesis of Arc protein is constitutively de-repressed,
  and de novo synthesis of Arc is not required for mGluR-LTD. This figure was adapted
  with permission from , their Figure 8. FMRP, Fragile-X mental retardation protein.
