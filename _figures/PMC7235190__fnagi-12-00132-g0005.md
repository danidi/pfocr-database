caption: The regulatory mechanism of HDAC2/3 on LPL expression in SH-SY5Y cells. HDAC2
  down-regulates microRNA-29a expression by decreasing the level of histone acetylation
  in its promoter region, subsequently increasing LPL expression directly or through
  the PPARγ-LPL pathway. HDAC3 decreases LPL expression through inhibiting histone
  acetylation levels in the promoter region of LPL and PPARγ and up-regulating miR-29a
  expression which the level of histone acetylation in its promoter region is unaltered.
