caption: 'Graphical presentation of the proposed hypothesis. During infection, SARS-CoV-2
  using spike glycoprotein attaches to the ACE2 receptor on the host cell membrane
  and enters inside the cell where RNA translates to form RdRp, spike, nucleo-capsid,
  and other proteins, which later assemble and package through the endoplasmic reticulum
  and Golgi body and finally get released outside the cell as an infectious virion.
  Excessive damage to host cells results in the immune cell recruitment phenomenon
  which eventually leads to cytokine release syndrome. Especially IL-6, which binds
  to the IL-6R and activates the gp130 medicated JAK/STAT pathway. Favipiravir and
  Tocilizumab co-delivery using mucoadhesive protein-lipidic nanovesicles administered
  through pulmonary route by nebulizer will help in two ways: Mucoadhesiveness would
  help the nanovesicles to have an extended retention time in the lung tissues. Nanovesicles
  will facilitate pro-antiviral favipiravir to be delivered inside the infected cells
  where it gets activated by ribosylation and phosphorylation to active favipiravir-RTP,
  which subsequently will bind the RdRp enzyme and inhibit viral replication. This
  will cease virion production. Tocilizumab antibody coated onto the nanovesicles
  would bind to the soluble IL-6R or IL-6R present on the cell membrane, thereby restricting
  IL-6 binding with the receptors. This will result in the inhibition of JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway and simultaneously, reduce the inflammatory cascade reaction'
