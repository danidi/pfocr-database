caption: Small molecule compounds pharmacologically reactivating of p53 function.
  MI43 and Nutlin-3 bound to MDM2 blocking MDM2-p53 interaction. RITA bound to p53
  interfering MDM2-p53 interaction. α-Lipoic acid increased p53 protein stability
  and its apoptotic effect. Quinacrine induced the autophagy-associated cell death
  in a p53-dependent manner. NSC17632 activated p53-like activatity dependent on p73.
  PRIMA-1/PRIMA-1MET restored mutant p53 to exert apoptotic effect. Maslinic acid
  and Epicatechin gallate as plant extraction modulated the expression of p53 and
  its target genes in p53-dependent apoptotic and cell cycle arrest pathway.
