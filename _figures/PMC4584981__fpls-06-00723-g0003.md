caption: Model representing cross talk between drought and pathogen stress signaling
  pathway from individual stress studies and its relation to shared and unique response
  pathway provoked under combined stress. The two inverted triangles in the upper
  panel represents the drought stress (A) and biotic stress signaling pathway (B)
  consisting of signal perception, signal transduction, gene expression and response
  generation steps with the representative gene products. The inverted shape represents
  the general response (wide upper side) at the stress perception and signal transduction
  stage culminating to a specific response (tapering lower end) contributing to tolerance
  to a particular stress. The response of the plants to combined drought and pathogen
  stress consist of both the shared (responses common to drought and pathogen stress)
  and unique responses as represented by the triangle (C). The overall response of
  plants to the combined stress is governed by the key players involving ROS, Ca2+,
  MAPKs, and the different transcription factors as well as some unique genes regulating
  the tailored responses. The shared responses can be deciphered by understanding
  the cross talk between the drought and the pathogen stress tolerance signaling networks
  whereas dedicated studies are required to understand the unique responses. The yellow
  colored small triangle represents the responses shared between drought and combined
  stress whereas the blue triangle represents the responses shared between pathogen
  and combined stress. The overlapping area between the two small triangles represents
  the responses shared by the drought and pathogen stress. The red colored triangle
  at the apex represents the unique response under the combined stress. The blue and
  yellow color spheres represent the calcium and ROS molecules. The red color arrow
  represents the MAPK pathway. The dashed arrows indicate the cross talk wherein the
  red colored dashed arrows represent the suppression and blue dashed arrows represent
  the activation of the respective stress responsive genes. PM, plasma membrane; ABA,
