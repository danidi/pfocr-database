caption: Schematic outline of lipid oxidation and impaired lipoprotein metabolism
  in psoriasis. Psoriasis pathogenesis activates neutrophil-released myeloperoxidase
  (MPO) along with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in
  plasma, contributing to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and RAS GTPases overactivation
  in the endothelium. These signaling pathways ultimately lead to the phosphorylation
  of several transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) in macrophages
  and endothelial cells. The imbalance in the antioxidant system provokes different
  functional activities of the pro-inflammatory genes. This pathological state developed
  in the vascular endothelium leads to NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation in macrophages
  and oxHDL modification of intracellular signaling via lectin-like oxLDL (LOX-I)
  receptor, which soluble form (sLOX-I) presents in circulation. Impaired paraoxonase
  I (PONI) enzyme function on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and excessive inflammatory
  response lead to further lipid oxidation. Additionally, perivascular fat releases
  less adiponectin and more pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-I (MCP-I). This cascade
  of pro-inflammatory and oxidation stimuli further activates synthesis of the lipoxygenase
  and cyclooxygenase pathways metabolites with generation of counteracting specialized
  proresolving mediators (SPMs). Sustaining oxidative and inflammatory state triggers
  excessive development of oxLDL and oxHDL, which results in lipoprotein transport
  alteration and impairment of the reverse-cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway (shown
  at left). This leads to insufficient apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) interaction with
  the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter AI (ABCAI) transporter on
  macrophages and decreased cholesterol esterification by lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase
  (LCAT). This results in decreased return of cholesteryl esters to the liver either
  directly after interaction with hepatic scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI) receptors
  or indirectly after transfer to LDL by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)
  and uptake by hepatic LDL receptors (LDL-R).
