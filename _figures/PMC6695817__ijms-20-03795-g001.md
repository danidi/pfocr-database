caption: Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-dependent antiviral signaling
  pathway. Upon infection, viral RNA is released into the cytosol where it is sensed
  by retinoic-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and/or melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene-5 (MDA5). These receptors travel to peroxisomes and mitochondria to activate
  MAVS, inducing a downstream signaling cascade that culminates with the production
  of type I interferons (IFNs), type III IFNs, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Once
  secreted, IFNs bind to specific receptors on the cell surface, activating the janus
  kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway and
  generating an amplifying loop that results in the accumulation of different classes
  of ISGs. The conjugation of these responses leads to the restriction of viral replication
  and spreading to neighboring cells. IFNAR—interferon alfa/beta receptor complex;
  IFNLR—interferon lambda receptor complex; and IL10R2—interleukin-10 receptor 2.
