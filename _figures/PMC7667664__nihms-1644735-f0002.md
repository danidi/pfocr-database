caption: A variety of impairments contribute to defective macrophage efferocytosis
  and the development and/or progression of disease. a | In the autoimmune disease
  glomerulonephritis, efferocytosis is impaired due to loss of the efferocytosis bridging
  molecule milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8). The development of autoantibodies
  and lupus-like autoimmune disease in mice is associated with impaired efferocytosis
  due to reduced levels of the efferocytosis receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine
  kinase (MERTK) or to impaired transcription of the efferocytosis bridging molecule
  C1q by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ (PPARδ). b | In atherosclerosis,
  proteolytic cleavage of the efferocytosis receptors MERTK and low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) compromises the ability of plaque macrophages
  to clear dead cells in atherosclerotic lesions, which contributes to plaque necrosis
  and impaired resolution. The MERTK cleavage product, soluble MER, may be able to
  compete for the bridging molecule growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6), sequestering
  it from intact MERTK receptors. Cell-surface LRP1 levels are also decreased by epsin-mediated
  internalization of the receptor. A particular lipid that accumulates in atherosclerotic
  lesions called arachidonic acid-derived 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE)
  suppresses apoptotic cell internalization by activating RHOA. Finally, apoptotic
  cells within atherosclerotic plaques upregulate the ‘don’t-eat-me’ signal CD47,
  impairing their ability to be recognized by phagocytes. Several mechanisms have
  been proposed, including induction of CD47 expression by a tumour necrosis factor
  (TNF)−TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)−nuclear factor-κB1 (NF-κB1) pathway and loss of a CD47-suppressing
  microRNA, miR-143–5p. c | Similarly to atherosclerosis, both MERTK cleavage in cardiac
  macrophages and inappropriately high levels of CD47 on apoptotic cardiomyocytes
  contribute to an impaired resolution response after experimental myocardial infarction.
  d | In obesity and diabetes, MERTK cleavage also plays an important role in the
  impaired ability of diabetic macrophages to clear apoptotic cells, although in contrast
  to the situation in atherosclerosis, cleavage is driven by disintegrin and metalloproteinase
  domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) owing to downregulation of miR-126. Diabetic
  macrophages also have a downregulation of a proefferocytic pathway involving erythropoietin
  (EPO)–EPO receptor signalling. Under normal conditions, EPO receptor signalling
  increases PPARγ expression, leading to enhanced PPARγ-mediated transcription of
  a number of efferocytosis receptors and bridging molecules. In diabetic mice, however,
  there is a reduction in levels of both EPO and the EPO receptor that interrupts
  this pathway and impairs efferocytosis efficiency. MIAT, myocardial infarction-associated
  transcript; oxLDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; SPM, specialized proresolving
  mediator; Ub, ubiquitin.
