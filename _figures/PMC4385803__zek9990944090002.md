caption: Potential targets in the calcium-calcineurin signaling pathway and some compounds
  that exhibit antifungal activity by themselves or in combination with antifungal
  drugs through interference with these potential targets. CaM, calmodulin; CN, calcineurin;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; *, compound is in clinical therapeutic use.
