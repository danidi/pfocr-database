caption: Periodontitis caused by defective killing of bacteria. Knockout of pattern
  recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors, knockout of lysosomal membrane
  protein LAMP-2, antimicrobial protein lactoferrin, or plasminogen causes defective
  clearance of bacteria, leading to activation of the Th1 signaling pathway, and initiating
  chronic inflammation Alternatively, knockout of genes important for the induction
  of the Th2 reaction and influx of T regulatory cells such as IL-4, CCL2, and CCR4
  that modulate the infection, also lead to enhanced inflammation and an endured Th1
  presence, such as shown by Araujo-Pires et al. (). It can be envisaged that bacterial
  products accumulate due to ineffective clearance.
