caption: Potential neuroprotective effects of ghrelin in PD. Ghrelin and its analog
  produce neuroprotective effects against MPTP/MPP+ and rotenone-induced toxicity
  via anti-apoptosis, anti-oxidative stress, and anti-inflammation. By interacting
  with GHS-R1a, ghrelin inhibits neuronal apoptosis via increasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio
  and reducing Caspase-3 activation. Ghrelin enhances the antioxidant enzyme CAT and
  CuZn-SOD expression, and inhibits the lipid peroxidation and ROS production. The
  upregulation of UCP-2 caused by ghrelin could also buffer ROS production, as well
  as promote mitochondrial biogenesis. Additionally, ghrelin prevents inflammatory
  microglial activation and enhances neuronal excitability by inhibiting voltage-gated
  potassium channels. Ghrelin also has the capability to enhance the proliferation,
  migration, and differentiation of midbrain neural stem cells via the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. Furthermore, ghrelin is proposed to provide neuroprotective effects via
  AMPK activation and enhanced mitophagy to ultimately enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics.
