caption: The INPHORS (intracellular phosphate reception and signaling) pathway for
  inorganic phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in the cytosol, based on known components from
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pi can be imported into the cytosol by high-affinity (Pho89/84)
  and low-affinity importers (Pho87/90) and by a Pi-permeable vacuolar channel (Pho91).
  It can be exported from the cytosol by secretion into the extracellular space (Syg1)
  or by conversion into polyphosphate (polyP) and transferred into the acidocalcisome-like
  vacuole (VTC). Inside this organelle, polyphosphatases can reconvert polyP into
  Pi to make it available for export into the cytosol. A Pi-regulated kinase (Pho80/85/81)
  phosphorylates transcription factors (Pho4/2) for the transcriptional phosphate
  starvation response. A sensor for cytosolic Pi might regulate the levels of inositol
  pyrophosphates (InsPPs; e.g., 5-InsP7), which then act on SPX domains. These should,
  when bound to InsPPs, inactivate proteins importing Pi and activate proteins exporting
  Pi from the cytosol.
