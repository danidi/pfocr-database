caption: In the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway miRNAs are transcribed by RNA Polymerase
  II into long miRNA primary transcripts termed pri-miRNAs. These pri-miRNAs serve
  as substrates for Drosha and DGCR8, the former cleaves the flanking single stranded
  RNA to generate an ~85ntprecursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). After nuclear export to the
  cytoplasm via RanGTP/Exportin-5, the majority of pre-miRNAs are directly processed
  by Dicer and are subsequently cleaved to generate an ~22nt miRNA duplex (I). However,
  pre-miRNAs can be cleaved by Ago2 to generate an ac-pre-miRNA, which is then recognized
  by Dicer (II). Once the miRNA-duplex is unwound and the passenger strand degraded,
  the guide strand (highlighted in red), is incorporated into RISC, which contains
  Ago and other proteins. A miRNA loaded RISC mediates gene silencing via mRNA target
  cleavage and degradation, or translational repression and deadenylation depending
  on the complementarity between the miRNA and the targeted mRNA transcript. It should
  be appreciated that there are additional non-canonical ways in which miRNAs can
  be generated (i.e. miRtrons), and that miRNAs can function is non-classical ways.
