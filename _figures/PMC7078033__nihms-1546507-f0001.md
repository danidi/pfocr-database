caption: 'Mechanism of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypophysitis (ICIH). A:
  The tumor antigen is presented to T lymphocyte (TLC) by antigen presenting cell
  (APC), which in this scenario can be a tumor cell, through the interaction between
  the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI). Another
  simultaneous interaction occurs between CD28 on the TLC and B7 on the APC which
  leads to the completion of TLC activation. B: Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)
  is a negative immunomodulator that is induced after the initial activation of TLC.
  CTLA4 binds to B7 with a higher affinity when compared to CD28, and causes inactivation
  of TLC. Programmed death 1 (PD1) is up-regulated in activated TLCs and, in response
  to the inflammatory state, various tissues express PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) and the PD1/PDL1
  interaction down-regulates TLC activation. These mechanisms act as immune checkpoints
  and are utilized by normal cells in the body to prevent immune-mediated destruction.
  But the tumor cells take advantage of these immunomodulatory pathways to evade the
  immune system. C: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies
  that target the immune checkpoints (CTLA4, PD1/PDL1) and inhibit their action, leading
  to persistent TLC activation and proliferation. This up-regulation in TLC activity
  caused by ICIs leads to destruction of the tumor and, as an adverse effect, also
  causes ICIH and other immune-related adverse events. The binding of ICI to pituitary
  cells elicits various immune reactions: a type II hypersensitivity reaction leading
  to activation of macrophages and complement pathways, a type IV hypersensitivity
  reaction causing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation resulting in the release of granzyme,
  perforin, and cytokines, and activation of humoral immunity pathway leading to the
  production of anti-pituitary antibodies, all of which cause the disruption of the
  pituitary gland. (Courtesy of Sriram Gubbi, NIDDK, NIH)'
