caption: Proposed diagram of signaling pathways of TLCA mediated RMCCA-1 proliferation.
  TLCA binds to M3 AChR, which can be blocked by a non-selective mAChR antagonist
  (atropine). TLCA activates EGFR, which can be blocked by EGFR kinase inhibitor (AG
  1478). Activation of M3 AChR and EGFR resulted in activated downstream MAP kinase
  signaling, which can be blocked by MEK 1/2 inhibitor (U 0126).
