caption: Proposed cellular pathway of JS-K on Taxol-induced cell apoptosis in prostate
  cancer cells. JS-K promoted Taxol-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis via the
  activation of caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 and suppression of ATP and GSH/GSSG ratio.
  The production of ROS induced by Taxol increased, which eventually led to apoptosis.
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; Bax, Bcl-2-associated X
  protein.
