caption: Role of Carnitine in the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway. The organic cation
  transporter novel 2 (OCTN2) mediates the uptake of carnitine in cells. Fatty acids
  (FA) crosses the plasma membrane via CD36. In the cytosol, FA are converted in acyl-CoA
  by acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and then are translocated in the mitochondrial matrix
  by the carnitine shuttle. The shuttle is constituted by carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1 (CPT1), carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  2 (CPT2). Once in the matrix, acyl-CoA undergoes β-oxidation (β-ox) with the production
  of acetyl-CoA that enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). NADH and FADH2 are
  generated by β-oxidation and TCA.
