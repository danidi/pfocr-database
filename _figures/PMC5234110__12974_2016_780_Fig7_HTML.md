caption: Schematic representation of the suggested dynamic effects of PGE2 on naïve
  and primed microglia. a Stimulation of naïve microglia with LPS activates TLR-4
  leading to very rapid transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, including COX-2.
  COX-2 produces PGE2 and increases the concentration of PGE2 in the extracellular
  space. Although selective agonists of EP4 or EP2 exert anti-inflammatory effects,
  PGE2 mainly induces anti-inflammatory effects through EP4 in naïve microglia. b
  During the course of classical microglial activation, EP4 receptor expression is
  down-regulated whereas EP2 expression increases and is found in peri-nuclear/nuclear
  zones enabling responses to high intracellular PGE2. EP2 favors the induction of
  iNOS, NOX2, and G6PD. G6PD is involved in metabolic changes promoting glucose utilization
  through the pentose pathway that generates NADPH to fuel NO production by iNOS and
  free radical generation by NOX2. AA arachidonic acid, COX2 cyclooxygenase-2, G6PD
