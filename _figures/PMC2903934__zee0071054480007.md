caption: Proposed model for the role of iPLA2β in mitochondrial function. () Cardiolipin
  remodeling. Nascent cardiolipin is remodeled to mature cardiolipin through a cycle
  of deacylation by iPLA2β and reacylation by monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase
  (MLCLAT). () Repair of cardiolipin oxidation. Under low oxidative stress, mitochondrial
  cardiolipin is oxidized, which may lower ROS levels, and is repaired promptly by
  iPLA2β and MLCLAT-mediated deacylation and reacylation. Under high oxidative stress,
  cardiolipin oxidation frees cytochrome c and initiates apoptosis. () Facilitation
  of apoptotic process. The permanent activation of iPLA2β by caspase-3 may facilitate
  clearance of apoptotic cells by releasing lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). sFA, Saturated
  fatty acids; usFA, unsaturated fatty acids. Gray arrows, The biochemical reactions
  catalyzed by iPLA2β; black arrows, stimulatory pathway; dashed arrow, inhibitory
  pathway.
