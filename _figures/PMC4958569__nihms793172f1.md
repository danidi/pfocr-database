caption: In the osteocyte, β-catenin is essential for 1). Maintenance of osteocyte
  viability and protection from apoptotic factors such as glucocorticoids through
  PGE2 (); 2). Communication between osteocytes potentially through the regulation
  of Connexin 43 (Xia et al, 2009); 3). Bone integrity as loss of β-catenin in osteocytes
  leads to elevated bone resorption through the increase of RankL/OPG ratios (); 4).
  Response to anabolic loading through the upregulation of Wnts (); 5). Response to
  unloading leads to an increase in inhibitors of the wnt/β -catenin pathway such
  as sclerostin () and 6). Gender effects are observed in response to unloading and
  potentially environmental stress (Maurel and Duan et al; 2016). The target gene
  involved in sensing environment stress is still unclear. It will be important to
  determine if β-catenin also plays a role in these functions in other cells embedded
  in a mineralized matrix such as cementocytes.
