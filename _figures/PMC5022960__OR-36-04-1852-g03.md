caption: Potential regulating signal pathway related to gastric lipase (LIPF) and
  diacylglycerol kinase α (DGKA) in gastric cancer (GC). LIPF degrade 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol
  into fatty acid for subsequent fatty degradation. DGKA phosphorylated this substrate
  of LIPF for glycerophospholipid metabolism. DGKA regulated Hif-1α and mTOR-SREBP
  pathways. Interestingly it also received feedback regulation from Hif-1α and SREBP.
  Analogical regulation manner existed in DEC1/2, regulation targets of Hif-1α and
  SREBP. They played a crucial role in circadian rhythm, tumor progenesis, which also
  regulated lipid metabolism. Theoretically, tumor cells demanded more lipids for
  membrane assemblage due to their exuberant proliferation.
