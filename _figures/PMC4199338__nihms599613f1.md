caption: Canonical Notch signaling. In the canonical Notch signaling pathway, there
  are three main proteolytic cleavage events. The furin-mediated S1 cleavage is required
  to generate the mature form of the Notch receptor, which is then expressed on the
  cell membrane. Notch ligands expressed on neighboring cells bind to the receptor,
  which causes a conformational change in the extracellular domain of the receptor.
  This allows ADAM metalloproteases to perform the extracellular S2 cleavage. The
  freed extracellular domain bound to the ligand is endocytosed and ultimately degraded
  by the signal sending cell. The Notch extracellular truncation then undergoes a
  regulated cleavage at the S3 site by the γ-secretase complex. This cleavage releases
  the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which then translocates to the nucleus and
  forms an active transcriptional complex with CSL and MAML. This leads to the transcription
  of various Notch effector genes such as the Hes/Hey genes.
