caption: 'Figure 2. Role of ATM in the DNA damage response. ATM is rapidly phosphorylated
  (Ser1981) and activated by MRE11 or 53BP1 in response to radiation-induced double
  stranded DNA breaks. Active ATM in its monomeric state then initiates pathways that
  regulate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or if required apoptosis. Phosphorylation
  of H2AX on Ser139 by ATM promotes DNA repair signals which are required for survival
  following radiation, while the substrates Chk2 and p53 can arrest cell cycle progression
  or the latter can initiate cell death. Abbreviations: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated; MRE11, meiotic recombination 11; NBS1, Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1; 53BP1,
  p53 binding protein 1; CDC25A, cell division cycle 25A; CDC25C, cell division cycle
  25C; CDK2, cyclic-dependent kinase 2; CDC2, cell division control protein 2.'
