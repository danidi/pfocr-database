caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism by which CTSL promotes IR-induced EMT
  of lung cancer via the mut-p53/Egr-1 signaling pathway. Only mutated p53 stimulates
  Egr-1 expression under IR. Then, mutated p53 and Egr-1 synergistically stimulate
  CTSL transcription. Finally, nuclear CTSL directly upregulated EMT genes to enhance
  invasion and metastasis in mut-p53 lung cancer cells
