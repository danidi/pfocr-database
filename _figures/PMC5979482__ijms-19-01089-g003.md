caption: Regulation of actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway in S. coelicolor A3. The
  organization of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster (22 kbp) is shown. 1×
  Acetyl-CoA and 7× malonyl-CoA creates the long carbon skeleton by actI. Then, the
  carbon backbone is cyclized to form a (S)-DNPA by actIII, actIV, actVI-1, actVI-3,
  and actVII, and modified to DHK by actVI-2, actVI-4, and actVA-6. Two DHK molecules
  finally produce actinorhodin through dimerization by actVB and actVA-5. The biosynthesis
  of blue-pigmented polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin was inactivated by targeting
  actI and actVB by CRISPR/Cas9 [] Red arrows indicate sgRNA targets.
