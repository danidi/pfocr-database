caption: The AhR genomic pathway. AhR resides in cytosol in a complex of chaperones
  and other proteins. Upon ligand (xenobiotics or endobiotics) binding, AhR changes
  conformation. This allows the translocation of the ligand–receptor complex into
  the nucleus and the dissociation of the receptor complex. In the nucleus, the complex
  dimerizes with its partner ARNT (or other partners from other signaling pathways)
  and this complex binds to DNA in certain elements and recruits transcription cofactors.
  Target genes are transcribed, leading to cell-specific transcriptome changes.
