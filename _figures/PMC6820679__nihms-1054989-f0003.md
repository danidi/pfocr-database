caption: The early stages in the biosynthetic pathway are grayed for clarity. The
  heterodimerization is highlighted in the red box (top right). Intermediates B to
  E are also possible substrates for thioesterase ClbQ, although promiscuous ClbQ
  has a known preference for hydrolyzing intermediates toward the middle of the assembly
  line. Amino acids are depicted at their sites of pathway entry. Domain abbreviations
  are C, condensation; A, adenylation; E, epimerization; KS, ketosynthase; KR, ketoreductase;
  DH, dehydratase; ER, enoylreductase; AT*, inactivated acyltransferase (AT); Cy,
  dual condensation/cyclization; and Ox, oxidase.
