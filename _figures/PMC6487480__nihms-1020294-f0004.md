caption: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) stabilizes pro-S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) decarboxylase
  (pro-AdoMetDC), leading to increased AdoMetDC and increased polyamine biosynthesis
  in prostate cancer. PTEN is a tumour suppressor that is frequently mutated or lost
  in prostate cancer. The loss of PTEN function results in aberrant response to growth
  factor (GF) stimuli through the PI3K signalling pathway, thus activating mTORC1.
  Mechanistically, activated mTORC1 indirectly blocks the proteasomal degradation
  of pro-AdoMetDC and leads to phosphorylation of the proenzyme at S298 (indicated
  by dotted arrow), thus stabilizing it further. The proenzyme then self-processes
  to the pyruvate-containing and active holoenzyme, thus facilitating the increased
  polyamine production necessary for neoplastic growth. dcAdoMet, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine;
  MLST8, mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8; RAPTOR, regulatory-associated protein
