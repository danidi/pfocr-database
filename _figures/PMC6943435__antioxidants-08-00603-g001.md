caption: 'Metabolic remodelling in lung cancer. Metabolic pathways are involved in
  the synthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and redox homeostasis, needed
  for cell proliferation are presented. The import of glucose is mediated by the GLUT
  (glucose transporter) family of membrane transport proteins, which are known to
  be deregulated in cancer []. Hexokinase 2 (HK-2) is the first rate-limiting enzyme
  in the glycolytic pathway and overexpression of HK-2 has wildly been observed in
  cancer cells, correlating with poor overall survival in cancer patients [,,]. Mutant
  EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor 1) promotes metabolic remodelling in non-small-cell
  lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with increased aerobic glycolysis and PPP (pentose phosphate
  pathway), altered pyrimidine biosynthesis and upregulation of monounsaturated fatty
  acids [,,]. KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog GTPase)-mutated NSCLC
  cells express higher levels of enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as pyruvate
  kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) compared with nonmalignant
  cells, indicating alterations in glucose metabolism and PPP (glicose-6-fosfato dehydrogenase
  (G6PD), transketolase (TKT) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD)) []. Pyruvate
  is decarboxylated into acetyl-CoA to be further transported into mitochondria to
  enter the TCA cycle []. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangements were associated
  with upregulated glucose metabolism in highly metastatic phenotypes of adenocarcinoma
  []. The expression and activity of PC (pyruvate carboxylase), the enzyme responsible
  for the conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetate, was found to be elevated in NSCLC
  tumours [,]. Glycolysis and glucose oxidation via PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and
  the TCA cycle were enhanced in NSCLC comparing to adjacent benign lung []. Cancer
  cells also show higher levels of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT), which are responsible
  for lactate export and helps both in maintaining intracellular pH and in continuing
  glycolysis []. Hif-1 (hypoxia inducible factor 1) regulates the transcription of
  glycolytic enzymes such as, HK-2, LDH-A and PKM2, which upregulate glycolysis [,].
  The expression of ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis
  was upregulated in NSCLC, being associated with poor prognosis []. Glutathione cysteine
  ligase (GCLC), which converts glutamate to Glutathione (GSH), is also highly expressed
  in several cancers, including lung cancer, and high mRNA expression of GCLC-promoted
  cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines []. G6P: glucose 6-phosphate;
