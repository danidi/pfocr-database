caption: Berberine activated AMPK negatively regulates the mTOR signal pathway, resulting
  in inhibition of colon cancer proliferation and growth. Activated AMPK negatively
  regulates COX-2 in colon cancer. Activation of AMPK also induces phosphorylation
  of p53 which is a tumor suppressor. Inhibition of tumorigenesis by berberine is
  partially dependent on inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This NF-κB suppression
  results in inhibiting transcription of NF-κB targets CyclinD1 and Survivin and stimulating
  the cleavage of caspase-3, modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Interactions
  leading to activation of molecular targets are indicated by arrows; those that inhibited
  are indicated by a bar. Berberine modulation of both pathways leads to inhibition
  of tumor multiplicity and tumor growth.
