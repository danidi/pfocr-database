caption: Gene regulatory network model for specification of the skeletogenic mesoderm
  lineage. A graphic model representing the GRN involved in skeletogenic micromere
  specification (see  for further details). At the top of the model, known maternal
  transcription factor inputs initiate specification in the micromeres at the 16-cell
  stage (shown as red cells in the embryo on the right). These cells activate Pmar1
  [a transcription factor, (TF) and an obligate repressor], which then represses another
  repressor (HesC, TF), thereby activating Alx1 (TF), Ets1 (TF), Tbr (TF) and Delta
  [a ligand (L) for the Notch signal transduction pathway]. Over time, additional
  genes are activated as the embryo forms the mesenchyme blastula stage (depicted
  by the lower embryo on the right), at which point the skeletogenic cells (red) are
  fully specified and ingress into the blastocoel. Light gray indicates endoderm;
  dark gray indicates nonskeletogenic mesoderm. Modified, with permission, from E.
