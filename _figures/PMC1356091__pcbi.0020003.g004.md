caption: 'Graphical representation and equations for a model with one ligand that
  forms complexes with one type I and one type II receptor. Receptors are present
  in two main compartments: the plasma membrane (receptors at the cell surface) and
  the endosomes (internalized receptors). Receptors and ligand-receptor complexes
  traffic between these two compartments by internalization and recycling. Only internalized
  ligand-bound receptors have kinase activity. Active receptors can also be internalized
  in a degradation pathway (right). In addition, receptors in the plasma membrane
  can undergo constitutive degradation, independently of whether they are ligand-bound
  (left). A supply of new receptors is constantly produced by gene expression.The
  concentration of the ligand is denoted by [ l ]; the numbers of type I and II receptor
  and ligand-receptor complexes in the plasma membrane, by [RI], [RII], and [l RIRII],
  respectively; and the numbers of internalized type I and II receptor and ligand-receptor
  complexes by [RI], [RII], and [l RIRII], respectively. (Note that type II receptors
  are not shown in the graphical representation.) kα is the rate constant of ligand-receptor
  complex formation; pRI and pRII are the rates of receptor production; ki, kr, kcd,
  and klid are the internalization, recycling, constitutive degradation, and ligand-induced
  degradation rate constants; α is the fraction of active receptors that are recycled
  back to the plasma membrane and can interact again with the ligand.The signaling
  activity of the pathway is assumed to be proportional to the number of internalized
  ligand-receptor complexes, [lRIRII]. This assumption is based on the observations
  that R-Smad proteins become rapidly dephosphorylated after inhibition of the receptor
  kinase activity and that nuclear Smad localization closely follows Smad phosphorylation
