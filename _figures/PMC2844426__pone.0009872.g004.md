caption: 'There are two main pathways through which MAP kinases signal: the classical
  MAPK pathway and the p38 MAP kinase pathway. In the classical signalling pathway,
  ligand binding results in receptor activation, which in turns leads to the activation
  of GRB2 and SOS. SOS catalyses the substitution of GDP for GTP on RAS (⇓), which
  then activates RAF1 (⇓). RAF1 subsequently phosphorylates MEK1/2, which in turn
  activate ERK1 and ERK2 (⇓). The ERK proteins activate MKNK2 (⇓), which is directly
  responsible for activation of proteins required for translation initiation. Downregulation
  of multiple core signalling components in combination with upregulation of the inhibitors,
  NF1 and PTPN5 predicts inability of the cell''s basal response to growth factors.
  The p38 MAPK pathway is a signalling cascade that is distinct, but not exclusive
  from the classical MAPK signalling pathway. As with the classical MAPK pathway,
  multiple elements of the pathway are downregulated: TAK1(⇓), p38 (⇓), MK2 (⇓) and
  HSP27 (⇓) which may result in a decrease in mRNA stability and the cell''s anti-apoptotic
  response. (PM = plasma membrane)'
