caption: The balanced signaling through TGF-β/ALK1 and TGF-β/ALK5 in healthy endothelial
  cells is broken in HHT patients. In HHT1 patients (endoglin mutated), the positive
  cooperation between endoglin and ALK1 is impaired and the ALK1 signaling pathway
  is partially abolished. The same is true when ALK1 is mutated in HHT2 patients.
  Thus, in a primary dysregulation of HHT endothelial cells, proliferation and migration
  would decrease and, consequently, ALK5 signaling and quiescence would prevail, compromising
  the angiogenesis process. However, ALK5 levels are decreased in these HHT endothelial
  cells as part of an adaptive response mechanism. Based on results by Fernández-L
  et al.
