caption: 'Type I interferon induction is inhibited by paramyxovirus interferon-antagonist
  proteins at multiple stages. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) generated
  during virus infection, such as dsRNA, are recognised by PRRs including endosomal/surface
  expressed Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)/melanoma
  differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5). TLR3 signals through the adaptor molecule
  Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon (IFN)β
  (TRIF), which recruits tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)2
  to activate the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) kinase (IKK)α/β kinases to
  phosphorylate inhibitory inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), triggering its degradation and
  activation/nuclear translocation of NF-κB. TLR3 signalling via TRAF3 results in
  phosphorylation/activation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3, causing its homodimerisation,
  or heterodimerisation with IRF-7 in professional IFN producing/IFN-primed cells,
  and translocation into the nucleus where, with NF-κB and activating transcription
  factor 2 (ATF2)/c-jun (not shown), it activates early type I IFN transcription.
  RIG-I and MDA5 also induce phosphorylation of IRF-3 following recognition of cytoplasmic
  PAMPs in infected cells via interaction with the mitochondrial membrane protein
  IFNβ promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), which recruits and activates TANK and the TANK-binding
  kinases (TBKs). TBK-1 and IKKε via the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3. Many paramyxoviruses
  target this pathway; steps commonly targeted are indicated (black bars) with specific
  examples of the paramyxovirus proteins responsible (see text for details). DC: Dendritic
