caption: Figure 2. Endothelin-1 receptor crosstalk with Ang II receptor to potentiate
  JAK2 kinase activity. Endothelial cell-derived ET-1 activates the ETa receptor on
  cardiomyocytes or cardiac fibroblasts. Activated ETa signals to PKCδ, which mediates
  inhibition of the SHP-1 JAK2 kinase phosphatase to allow phosphorylated JAK2 kinases
  to remain phosphorylated and active. These active JAK2 kinases can phosphorylate
  STAT3 associated with either the AT1 or ETa receptor (which lacks a JAK2 binding
  site but has one for STAT3). How JAK2 kinases become phosphorylated to begin with
  is not clear. There is some evidence that the AT1 receptor can dimerize in which
  case the associated JAK2 kinases can cross-phosphorylate themselves.
