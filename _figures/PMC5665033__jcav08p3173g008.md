caption: 'Schematic diagram of how arecoline affects glycolysis and the signaling
  pathway of anoikis in HA22T/VGH cells. Arecoline induces glycolytic gene expression
  (Glut3, HK1, HK2, and PK), which in turn increases the production of lactate and
  ATP. Arecoline also enhanced the ROS generation. However, the intracellular pH (pHi)
  is not changed and the extracellular pH (pHe) is declined. The pH-regulating protein
  NHE1 expression is unchanged and NCX is up-regulated. This suggests that intracellular
  H+ is exported via NHE1 and NCX and intracellular Ca2+ is increased during this
  ion exchange process. The increase in [Ca2+]i and respiratory chain of mitochondria
  leads to generate more ROS and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. These results demonstrate
  that arecoline enhances aerobic glycolysis in HA22T/VGH cells and modulates the
  mRNA expression of pH regulators, resulting in an elevated [Ca2+]i, ROS generation,
  and subsequent cell detachment. Red    : increased (shown in this study); Red    :
  decreased (shown in this study); Red =: not changed (shown in this study); Blue    :
  enhanced (shown in a previous studies) (see Cheng et al., 2010) .'
