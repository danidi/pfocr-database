caption: Proposed signaling pathway(s) responsible for SiNPs-induced endothelial barrier
  injury based on the present study and published literatures. In brief, SiNPs activate
  CRAC channels at the extracellular side and lead to Ca2+ influx (endocytosed SiNPs
  might also affect the CRAC channel and other proteins from the intracellular side);
  Ca2+ influx induces Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a Ca2+-induced
  Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism; Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release lead to [Ca2+]i elevation;
  elevated [Ca2+]i activates calpain and convert xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) to xanthine
  oxidase (XO), and XO catalyzes ROS generation; ROS mediates activation of Src family
  kinase, and activated Src induces VE-cadherin phosphorylation at the Y731 site and
  leads to VE-cadherin internalization and degradation and F-actin re-assembly, and
  finally leads to failure of endothelial barrier. Subsequent macrophage infiltration
  occurs across the inter-endothelial gap due to the injury. In this signaling chain,
  MY58483 inhibits CRAC channels and PP1 suppresses Src, and thus together ameliorate
  SiNPs-induced endothelial barrier injury. In addition, the endothelial toxicity
  of SiNPs may also lead to endothelial death/exfoliation and collagen exposure, thus
  trigger the contact pathway of coagulation in the blood vessels (not shown)
