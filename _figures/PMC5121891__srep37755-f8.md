caption: In the early stage after SAH, administration of anti-HMGB1 mAb suppresses
  a vicious cycle for extracellular HMGB1-induced facilitation of HMGB1 release from
  cell nuclei on hemorrhage-damaged regions including the cerebral cortex and BA,
  inhibiting downstream activity in the HMGB1-induced TLR4 pathway. Subsequently,
  anti-HMGB1 mAb also suppresses the enhancement of vasocontractile response induced
  by the up-regulation of inflammatory mediators. As a result, the onset of DCV may
  be prevented along with the reduction of the cerebral inflammation.
