caption: PGC-1α is activated via post-transcriptional phosphorylation by AMPK or by
  deacetylation via SIRT1 in response to nutrient deprivation. Induction or activation
  of the coactivator can enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function through
  the coactivation of multiple transcription factors involved in respiratory gene
  expression (see ). PGC-1α activation may also promote an antioxidant environment
  by coactivating ERRα to induce SIRT3, a mitochondrial sirtuin that has been implicated
  in ROS detoxification. In addition, AMPK promotes autophagy through direct phosphorylation
  of ULK1 or suppression of the TORC1 kinase complex. Inhibition of the TORC1 pathway
  also has been shown to have a negative effect on senescence. Increased autophagy,
  enhanced ROS detoxification and inhibition of TORC1 are all associated with health
  and longevity. Under conditions of caloric excess, SRC-3 induces GCN5 which inactivates
  PGC-1α through acetylation.
