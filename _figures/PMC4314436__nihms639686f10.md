caption: Model of ERK1 activation with respect to G protein signaling pathways. Signals
  mediated by G protein signaling pathways in response to cAMP and folate activate
  ERK2 but then later lead to the activation of ERK1 in a secondary response. ERK1
  can also be activated through intercellular signaling. The Gα5-mediated signaling
  pathway can down regulate ERK1 function but not through changing the phosphorylated
  state of ERK1.

  description: Model of ERK1 activation with respect to G protein signaling pathways.
    Signals mediated by G protein signaling pathways in response to cAMP and folate
    activate ERK2 but then later lead to the activation of ERK1 in a secondary response.
    ERK1 can also be activated through intercellular signaling. The Gα5-mediated signaling
    pathway can down regulate ERK1 function but not through changing the phosphorylated
    state of ERK1.
