caption: ATM, ATR and DNA-PK signalling pathways. The DNA damage signalling pathways
  are primarily mediated by the ATM, ATR and DNA-PK kinases. DSBs are detected by
  the MRN complex (MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1) which recruits and activates ATM at the
  site of the break. Activated ATM phosphorylates numerous effector proteins such
  as CHK2 and p53. Phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX by ATM and ubiquitination
  of H2AX by RNF8 and RNF168 E3 ubiquitin ligases precedes recruitment of repair proteins
  such as BRCA1 and 53BP1. ATR is primarily activated at regions of ssDNA which are
  first coated by RPA. ATR is then recruited to RPA-coated ssDNA via its interacting
  protein ATRIP. The recruitment of TOPBP1 to the ssDNA region is responsible for
  the activation of ATR which subsequently phosphorylates effector proteins such as
  CHK1 and p53. In contrast to the ATM and ATR kinases, DNA-PK is responsible for
  the regulation of the NHEJ DSB repair pathway. Image adapted from [].
