caption: Upper left. Translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inside to outside
  of the apoptotic cell membrane allows serum opsonins to bind to PS. Different opsonins
  interact with different ligands on the phagocyte allowing compartment specific uptake
  to occur.Lower left. Phosphorylcholine, which is situated on the outside of the
  cell membrane may be biochemically modified in several ways on apoptotic cells.
  Caspase 3 activates the calcium independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) to cleave the
  fatty acid from PC, yielding lysoPLA2. LysoPLA2 acts as both an antigen for natural
  IgM antibodies as well as a chemoattractant for macrophages. PC may be oxidized
  by reactive oxygen (ROI) intermediates as well. Binding of natural antibodies to
  apoptotic cells explains, in part, activation of the classical pathway of complement
  and deposition of C3bi on the cell surface. C3bi serves as a ligand for CR3 and
  CR4 on phagocytes.
