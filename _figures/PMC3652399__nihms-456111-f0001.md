caption: The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway and its genetic
  defects causing endocrine diseases. ATP = adeno-sine triphosphate; C = catalytic
  subunit of PKA; CNC = Carney complex; GDP = guanosine diphosphate; GTP = guanosine
  triphosphate; MAS = McCune-Albright syndrome; PDE = phosphodiesterase; PKA = protein
  kinase A; R = regulatory subunit of PKA; a, b, g = subunits of G protein.
