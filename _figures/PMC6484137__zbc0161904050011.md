caption: Schematic showing a novel role of mitochondria in nongenomic AR signaling.
  In the traditional genomic pathway, AR undergoes conformational change and dimerization
  upon ligand binding, followed by its migration to the nucleus. Subsequent binding
  to the androgen response elements induces target gene transcription. In the nongenomic
  pathway, membrane-bound AR signals in the cytoplasm, which via second messengers
  activates other transcription factors. Our studies suggest that mitochondria are
  novel players in the nongenomic action of AR. Signaling cascades triggered upon
  translocation of AR into mitochondria may, in a retrograde manner, affect nuclear
  gene transcription that may contribute to aggressive prostate cancer.
