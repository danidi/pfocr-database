caption: Signalling pathway for pseudohyphal growth. Nitrogen starvation activates
  the pseudohyphal pathway in a/α diploid cells, although the mechanism of activation
  is not known (dashed arrow from signal to Ras2). An alternative pathway may also
  regulate pseudohyphal growth, indicated by the dashed arrows originating from other
  inputs. X, unidentified MAPK, which may be Kss1. See the text for details.
