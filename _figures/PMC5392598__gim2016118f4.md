caption: 'Schematic overview of the sex development gene regulation network. Blue:
  testis-promoting activity of NR5A1 (ref. ). Orange: counteractive connections to
  suppress the opposite pathway. Green: ovary-promoting activity of NR5A1 as hypothesized
  here and supported by other works., (a) General scheme: NR5A1 is known to initiate
  the male developmental pathway through upregulation of SOX9 (synergistically with
  SRY). SOX9 then maintains its own expression via Fgf9 signaling. In the female embryo,
  in the absence of SRY, NR5A1 induces WNT4 and RSPO1 expression as shown by Combes,
  leading to upregulation of FOXL2 and other ovary-specific genes. High FOXL2 expression
  results in stable repression of SOX9 and, possibly, NR5A1, and hence the male pathway.
  (b) Possible mechanism by which c.274C<T leads to ovotesticular disorders of sex
  development. We hypothesize that this novel mutation affects the activation of female-specific
  genes such as WNT4/β-catenin (as indicated by the dotted lines), leading to decreased
  FOXL2 expression. In this way, FOXL2 can no longer prosecute its pro-ovarian functions
  and, at the same time, male-promoting genes escape firm suppression, ultimately
  resulting in NR5A1-mediated and/or independent SOX9 upregulation and enhancement
  of testicular differentiation.'
