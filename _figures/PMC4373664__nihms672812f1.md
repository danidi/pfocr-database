caption: 'Canonical Rho GTPase signaling motifs regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics.
  G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), growth factor receptors, and integrin receptors
  directly activate upstream Src-family kinases and other non-receptor tyrosine kinases,
  PI3K-Akt signaling, other phosphoinositide kinase and phosphatases, Ras, and other
  signaling pathways that modulate Rho-directed guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  (GEFs). These, along with the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide
  dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) directly regulate Rho GTPases, with GEFs promoting
  GTPase activation, and GAPs and GDIs promoting inactivation and preventing activation,
  respectively. Rac1 directly activates the WAVE-Arp2/3 and PAK-LIMK-Cofilin, as well
  as activating the formins, FHOD1 and FMNL1: these pathways promote lamellipodium
  formation, initial adhesion signaling, and broadly protrusive actin dynamics. Similarly,
  Cdc42 activates the WASP/N-WASP-Arp2/3 and PAK-LIMK-Cofilin pathway, as well as
  activating the formins, mDia2 and DAAM1: these pathways also contribute to protrusive
  actin dynamics and filopodium formation. RhoA activates the ROCK-LIMK-Cofilin and
  ROCK-MLC pathway, as well as activating the formins, mDia1 and 2 and DAAM1: these
  pathways promote late integrin adhesion and maturation, as well as promoting stress
  fibers and contractility. Cofilin is also dynamically regulated by the phosphatases,
  Slingshot and Chronophin.'
