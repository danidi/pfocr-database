caption: 'Parental DNA strands (blue) and newly synthesized DNA strands (red) form
  a stalled fork due to the presence of DNA damage or replication blockage (brown
  triangle). Left: In the classical model, ssDNA at a stalled replication fork is
  bound by replication protein A (RPA), which recruits ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related
  protein (ATR) to activate the DNA damage response. ATR-dependent DNA damage response
  stabilizes the stalled replication fork, whose damage or blockage is repaired by
  DNA lesion bypass, direct damage removal, or template-switching via fork regression.
  Right: The EEPD1-Exo1-BLM) constitutive complex may provide an alternative pathway
  by nicking the 5′ single-stranded region of the stalled strand to generate a DNA
  double-stranded break, which is resected to form a 3′ single-stranded overhang to
  initiate homologous recombination (HR).'
