caption: Calcium and calcium-permeable channels in the control of autophagy. Inhibitory
  and stimulatory actions of Ca2+ on autophagy as well as calcium-permeable channels
  that could be potentially involved in autophagy regulation are depicted. Ca2+ mobilizing
  agents, such as vitamin D3, thapsigargin and ionomycin, lead to increase in cytosolic
  Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) concentration and subsequent activation of CAMKK-beta, followed
  by AMPK-dependent mTOR inhibition and autophagy stimulation. ER-stress induced elevation
  of [Ca2+]cyt levels activate PKCtheta which stimulates autophagy. Additionally,
  increased [Ca2+]cyt induce activation of DAPK, which phosphorylates Beclin1, thereby
  promoting its dissociation from Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 inhibitory proteins, and thus stimulate
  autophagy. Cadmium induces autophagy through elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ via IP3R
  and subsequent ERK activation. In contrast, constitutive IP3R mediated Ca2+ release
  to mitochondria maintains ATP production and AMPK inhibition, thereby suppressing
  autophagy. The inhibition of IMPase by Li+ causes a decrease in IP3 levels and autophagy
  induction. Further, IP3R-dependent Ca2+ release from the ER as well as amino acids-induced
  increase in [Ca2+]cyt maintain an elevated mTORC1 activity, thus inhibiting autophagy.
  In addition, IP3R represses autophagy through Bcl-2-mediated binding of Beclin1.
  Also, increased Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels on the plasma membrane
  activates calpains and consequently Gsalpha/Adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/Epac/Rap2B/PLC-ε
  pathway which negatively regulates autophagy by promoting IP3 production, IP3R activation
  and Ca2+ release.

  description: Calcium and calcium-permeable channels in the control of autophagy.
    Inhibitory and stimulatory actions of Ca2+ on autophagy as well as calcium-permeable
    channels that could be potentially involved in autophagy regulation are depicted.
    Ca2+ mobilizing agents, such as vitamin D3, thapsigargin and ionomycin, lead to
    increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) concentration and subsequent activation
    of CAMKK-beta, followed by AMPK-dependent mTOR inhibition and autophagy stimulation.
    ER-stress induced elevation of [Ca2+]cyt levels activate PKCtheta which stimulates
    autophagy. Additionally, increased [Ca2+]cyt induce activation of DAPK, which
    phosphorylates Beclin1, thereby promoting its dissociation from Bcl-XL and Bcl-2
    inhibitory proteins, and thus stimulate autophagy. Cadmium induces autophagy through
    elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ via IP3R and subsequent ERK activation. In contrast,
    constitutive IP3R mediated Ca2+ release to mitochondria maintains ATP production
    and AMPK inhibition, thereby suppressing autophagy. The inhibition of IMPase by
    Li+ causes a decrease in IP3 levels and autophagy induction. Further, IP3R-dependent
    Ca2+ release from the ER as well as amino acids-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt
    maintain an elevated mTORC1 activity, thus inhibiting autophagy. In addition,
    IP3R represses autophagy through Bcl-2-mediated binding of Beclin1. Also, increased
    Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels on the plasma membrane activates calpains
    and consequently Gsalpha/Adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/Epac/Rap2B/PLC-ε pathway which
    negatively regulates autophagy by promoting IP3 production, IP3R activation and
    Ca2+ release.
