caption: Signal transduction pathways that mediate Treg resistance converge on the
  PI3K/Akt pathway. (A) Cytokines IL-6, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15, IL-21, IL-2, and TNFα [ligand
  for TNFR2, see (B) as part of the TNFR superfamily] have been shown to induce Tcon
  cells to resist Treg suppression. The respective STAT molecule through which each
  predominantly signals is depicted. (B) Signaling through TNF receptors 4-1BB, OX40,
  GITR, and TNFR2 can induce Tcon cell resistance to Treg suppression, as they provide
  costimulatory signals similar to CD28 ligation. 4-1BB, OX40, and TNFR2 signaling
  has been shown to induce PI3K/Akt activation via TRAF adaptor proteins, while GITR
  ligation has not been directly demonstrated to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. (C)
  Toll-like receptors 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9, as well as IL-1R, also a member of the TLR
  family, have been shown to induce Treg resistance. Of these, only signaling through
  TLR2 and TLR9 has been shown to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway via recruitment of
  adaptor protein MyD88, which in turn recruits and activates PI3K via its Toll/interleukin-1
  receptor domain. (D) Intracellular signaling molecules Cbl-b and SHP-1 act as negative
  regulators downstream of TCR signaling, and genetic deficiency in either induces
  Treg resistance. Cbl-b enforces the requirement for CD28 costimulatory signaling
  by inhibiting the recruitment of PI3K to CD28. TRAF6 also negatively regulates activation
  of PI3K downstream of CD28 costimulation by an as yet undefined mechanism. Dashed
  lines indicate proposed, but unconfirmed, links between receptors and/or signaling
  molecules and the PI3K/Akt pathway.
