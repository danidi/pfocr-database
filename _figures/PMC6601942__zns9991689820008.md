caption: Schematic diagram showing how RvD1 increases the macrophage phagocytosis
  of apoptotic T cells to induce TGF-β, promoting inflammation resolution and disease
  recovery in EAN. RvD1, its synthetic enzyme, and its receptor were greatly increased
  in the PNS during the recovery stage of EAN. The enhanced RvD1 pathway promoted
  the macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic T cells in the PNS, resulting in reduced
  apoptotic T-cell accumulation and the up-regulation of TGF-β by macrophages. The
  induced TGF-β enhanced Treg cell counts and inflammation resolution in the PNS,
  leading to disease recovery in EAN rats.
