caption: Wnt signaling in implantation and decidualization events. a Wnt signaling
  in pre‐implantation embryo development. Various Wnt family members have been detectable
  in mouse pre‐implantation embryo. However, canonical Wnt signaling is not integrant
  during the pre‐implantation period and the exact role of non‐canonical Wnt signaling
  still warrants future investigation. b Wnt signaling in blastocyst activation for
  implantation. Wnt/β‐catenin signaling has been suggested to be not only required
  for blastocyst activation but also for successful implantation. c Wnt signaling
  in uterine development and decidualization. Among diverse Wnt ligands, Wnt4, Wnt5a,
  and Wnt7a have been studied extensively in the mouse female reproductive tract (FRT)
  and also identified to perform their momentous functions for uterine development
  and specifically for glands formation via either β‐catenin‐dependent or ‐independent
  pathway. Moreover, the dynamical expressions of Wnt genes during mouse uteri decidual
  process and the wide application of transgenic mouse models further elucidate the
  roles of Wnt pathway in uterine decidualization
