caption: Chorismic acid is produced via the shikimic acid pathway and is a metabolic
  precursor for a number of different end products in pseudomonads, including phenazines
  (indicated by solid lines). The negative symbols (-) indicate competing pathways
  in which transcript levels for key genes are reduced in 2-OH-PCA producing strains
  compared to 30-84ZN ().
