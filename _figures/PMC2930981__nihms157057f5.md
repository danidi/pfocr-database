caption: Potential of BH3 mimetic anticancer drugs. Because the upstream signals that
  induce apoptosis (particularly the p53 pathway) often are compromised in cancer
  cells, a drug that behaves like a BH3-only protein by binding to one or more of
  the Bcl-2 homologs to free Bax or Bak should be a more effective way of killing
  cancer cells.
