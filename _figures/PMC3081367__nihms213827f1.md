caption: Within the central nervous system degradation of ATP constitutes the major
  source for synaptic adenosine, whereas the de novo synthesis plays only a minor
  role. In brain the major pathway for the removal of adenosine is its phosphorylation
  to AMP by adenosine kinase; alternatively, adenosine can be dephosphorylated by
  adenosine deaminase into inosine. Adenosine is a ubiquitous endproduct of transmethylation
  reactions. However, when adenosine levels increase the equilibrium of the s-adenosyl
  homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase reaction is shifted towards synthesis of SAH, resulting
  in the inhibition of transmethylation reactions.
