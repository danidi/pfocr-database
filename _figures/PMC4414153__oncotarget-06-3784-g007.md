caption: PN1 expression mediates apoptosis via regulation of XIAP. PN1 can affect
  this regulation through down-regulation of the NF-κB pathway activator p65, impeding
  XIAP transcription. Alternately, PN1 activity can reduce the stability of XIAP by
  preventing a stabilizing phosphorylation at serine-87, mediated by the AKT pathway.
  The dual regulation of XIAP is facilitated through inhibition of uPA and altered
  signalling through uPAR.
