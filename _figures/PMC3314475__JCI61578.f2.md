caption: Src family kinases become activated between 30 and 90 minutes after infection
  and exclusively phosphorylate the tyrosine residue of an EPIYA motif surrounded
  by C segment sequences. SHP-2 is known to bind to EPIYA-CPY. EPIYA-CPY CagA becomes
  a substrate for Abl family kinases at 90–180 minutes after infection; c-Abl is in
  principle capable of phosphorylating tyrosine residues in EPIYA motifs located in
  either A, B, or C segments, but never phosphorylates more than 2 residues per molecule
  (preferentially A and C). Triple-phosphorylated CagA is not detectable in infected
  cells. CagAPY interactors such as CSK and PI3K bind to EPIYA-APY and EPIYA-BPY motifs.
  Double-phosphorylated EPIYA-ACPY CagA triggers the activation of several downstream
  signaling pathways; the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway is shown representatively. The biological
  and cell morphological consequences of CagA phosphorylation are cell elongation
  and increased cell motility. Single-phosphorylated EPIYA-CPY CagA or double-phosphorylated
  EPIYA-BCPY CagA do not efficiently induce Ras-Raf-MEK signaling. In East Asian CagA
  variants, EPIYA-D functionally replaces EPIYA-C as the initial motif to be phosphorylated
  by c-Src (not shown).
