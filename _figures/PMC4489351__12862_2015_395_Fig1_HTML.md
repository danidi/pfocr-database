caption: The EDA pathway and its downstream signaling. a EDA binds EDAR that recruits
  EDARADD B by interacting with its death domain (DD), leading to the downstream activation
  of the NF-κB pathway []. EDARADD A displays the same functional domains as EDARADD
  B but its activity is not known. Proteins are shown here with a color code that
  highlights exon 1A/B boundary. b The two isoforms differ by their short N-terminal
  part corresponding to the first exon that is close to the TRAF binding sites. Proteins
  are represented with exon boundaries and exon size (in amino acid) is indicated.
  Sequences of the short N-terminal peptide encoded by human exon 1A and 1B are represented
  in yellow (1A) and brown (1B)
