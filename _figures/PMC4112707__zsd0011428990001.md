caption: Overall signaling cascade of TAS2R in taste bud cells and human airway smooth
  muscle. To the left of the dashed green line is the pathway in the type 2 cell of
  the taste bud. To the right of the blue line is the pathway in human airway smooth
  muscle cells. The portion between these two lines is common between the two cell-types.
