caption: Proposed relationship between demand for carbon for growth and the rate of
  starch accumulation. A, At the start of the day in 12:12 conditions, demand for
  Suc for growth (green arrow) is relatively high. This stimulates flux of carbon
  from the Calvin-Benson cycle into the cytosol via the triose-P- transporter (purple),
  creating conditions of relatively high  and low  in the chloroplast and thus inhibiting  (red
  line) and causing a relatively low rate of starch synthesis. B, At the start of
  the day in 6:18 conditions or following an unexpected extension of the night in
  12:12 conditions, demand for Suc for growth is low. Suc and intermediates of the
  pathway build up in the cytosol, resulting in a relatively low flux of triose phosphates
  from the Calvin-Benson cycle into the cytosol, relatively high  and low  in the
  chloroplast, and thus activation of  and a relatively high rate of starch synthesis.
