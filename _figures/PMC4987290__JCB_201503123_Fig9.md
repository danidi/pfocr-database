caption: Model for the regulation of cell motility by the RSK-SH3P2-Myo1E axis. SH3P2
  binds to and functions as a cytosolic anchor for Myo1E (1). SH3P2 interacts with
  Myo1E through two binding interfaces (the PR region of SH3P2 with the SH3 domain
  of Myo1E, and the C-terminal acidic amino acid cluster of SH3P2 with the positively
  charged region located at the C terminus of the TH2 domain of Myo1E; 1a), with the
  latter interaction appearing to be responsible for the association of the two proteins
  in most SH3P2-Myo1E complexes in cells (1b). Serum stimulation of cells induces
  activation of the ERK signaling pathway and the consequent phosphorylation of SH3P2
  at Ser202 by RSK, resulting in the dissociation of Myo1E from SH3P2 (2). Serum stimulation
  also induces activation of the PI3K signaling pathway, resulting in the production
  of PI(3,4,5)P3 and consequent rearrangement of F-actin at the leading edge of the
  cell. Myo1E released from SH3P2 moves along the rearranged actin filaments and localizes
  at the tips of lamellipodia via binding of its TH2 domain to F-actin (3). The mechanical
  force generated by Myo1E–F-actin interaction at the plasma membrane together with
  the function of effector molecules transported or recruited by Myo1E through binding
  to its SH3 domain coordinately induce active lamellipodium formation and thereby
  promote cell migration. PIP2, PI(4,5)P2; PIP3, PI(3,4,5)P3.
