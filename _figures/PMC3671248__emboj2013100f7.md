caption: Model for 20E regulation of IMD innate immune signalling. 20E controls the
  IMD innate immune signalling by at least two distinct mechanisms. First, 20E regulates
  the expression of the peptidoglycan receptor PGRP-LC. This hormonal control involves
  several ecdysone-inducible transcription factors, including BR-C, Eip78C, Eip93F,
  Eip74EF, Eip75B, HR46, PNR and SRP. Through this steroid-mediated regulation of
  the key microbial sensor, immune induction of all AMP genes through the IMD pathway
  is tightly controlled by prior exposure to this hormone. Through a second mechanism,
  20E further regulates the expression of a subset of AMP genes (i.e., Dipt, Mtk and
  Drs), independent of its control of the receptor PGRP-LC. BR-C, SRP and PNR transcription
  factors are absolutely required for this PGRP-LC independent hormonal effect. On
  the other hand, the 20E-inducible nuclear hormone receptor Eip75B negatively regulates
  the IMD pathway, at least in part, by interfering with PGRP-LC expression.
