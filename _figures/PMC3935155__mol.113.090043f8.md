caption: A schematic of how PDE5 inhibitors and DNA damaging drugs interact to kill
  T24 cells. PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil inhibit PDE5, which leads to increased
  cGMP levels, increased iNOS expression, and elevated levels of NO. DNA damaging
  drugs stimulate the production of ROS that is counteracted by ATM. ROS and NO generate
  peroxynitrite, which inhibits the protein tyrosine phosphatase that inhibits CD95.
  CD95 becomes activated, stimulating (1) the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and (2)
  through RIP-1, an autophagy pathway that also leads to cell killing. BID, BH3 interacting-domain
  death agonist.
