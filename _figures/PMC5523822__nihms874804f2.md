caption: a | Under homeostatic conditions, self-reactive B cells are subjected to
  both positive and negative selection mechanisms as they transit into the naive B
  cell pool and establish the naive repertoire. Whereas tonic B cell receptor (BCR)
  signalling and BCR engagement with self-antigen primarily regulate these events,
  synergy between the BCR and co-receptors fine-tunes the tolerance programme within
  a given B cell. Among these co-receptors, B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFFR)
  signalling (1) synergizes with BCR signalling during late bone marrow and transitional
  development through a series of complex events, including proximal biochemical crosstalk
  and the downstream transcriptional regulation of both receptor and substrate expression.
  Dual BCR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling (2) is mediated by internalization
  and delivery of self-antigens that contain TLR ligands to autophagosomes, which
  contain endosome-resident TLRs. CD40 signalling (3), which is triggered by interaction
  with CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells and possibly other cell types, also integrates
  with the BCR signalling pathway. Although BCR signalling can modulate CD40 expression,
  other biochemical or transcriptional events that affect this crosstalk are less
  well understood. b | In genetic (or environmental) settings that promote an increased
  risk of developing autoimmunity, the homeostatic signalling thresholds are modulated,
  and self-reactive B cells exhibit greater positive selection and/or reduced negative
  selection, leading to a naive repertoire that is skewed towards autoreactivity.
  For example, excess amounts of B cell-activating factor (BAFF; 1) in the Baff-transgenic
  mouse model rescue low-affinity self-reactive B cells from negative selection. A
  similar mechanism has been proposed to exist in individuals with systemic lupus
  erythematosus (SLE). Similarly, in mouse and human settings of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome
  (WAS) deficiency (2), hyper-responsive dual BCR and TLR signalling promotes the
  positive selection of transitional B cells with BCRs that use a limited subset of
  genes that encode self-reactive heavy-chain variable (VH) domains. Healthy individuals
  with the autoimmunity-associated variant PTPN22R620W (3) exhibit altered BCR and
  CD40 signalling, and have an enrichment of self-reactive BCR specificities within
  the naive B cell compartment. Although it has not yet been definitively demonstrated,
  it is likely that enhanced positive selection, rather than relaxed negative selection,
  predominantly mediates this change. The thickness of the arrows indicates the strength
  of pathway activation. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
