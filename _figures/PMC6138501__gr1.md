caption: 'Inflammasome activation and purinergic signaling in Chlamydia-infected cells.
  Chlamydia consists of two forms: elementary bodies (EB; small light brown circles)
  and reticulate bodies (RB, large dark brown circles). EBs are the dispersive form
  of the bacteria, capable of invading host-epithelial cells and establishing a new
  cellular compartment called an inclusion (white circle). It is here that EBs differentiate
  into RBs, the replicative and metabolically active form of the pathogen. After accumulating
  in number, RBs differentiate back into EBs, eventually leading to cell lysis and
  a new round of infection. Chlamydia infection activates the inflammasome, which
  in turn activates caspase-1 leading to cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its mature, active
  form. Infection also activates another inflammation pathway, purinergic signaling
  (see Ref.  for more details). Figure kindly provided by Pettengill et al.'
