caption: Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) modify several enzymes in the glycolytic
  pathway. This diagram shows the metabolism of carbohydrates in glycolysis and summarizes
  existing knowledge on RNS-driven modifications in glycolytic proteins. Relevant
  enzymes are highlighted. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is the
  most sensitive protein. Modifications that have been linked to the inhibition of
  enzymatic activities are indicated by number within a circle. When reported chemical
  alterations have not been linked to changes in enzymatic activities, they are represented
  by an underlined number. See text for details and references. (To see this illustration
  in color, the reader is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertonline.com/ars).
