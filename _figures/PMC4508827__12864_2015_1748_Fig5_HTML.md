caption: The Toll signalling pathway of C. floridanus. All identified signalling components
  are mapped on the comprehensive immune network of D. melanogaster. The names of
  the factors correspond to the Drosophila designations. Connectivity among nodes
  is based either on positive attribute (blue arrow) or negative attribute (red arrow).
  Missing components are shown in grey colour. Nuclear translocation is shown by a
  green arrow. Factors significantly upregulated on the transcriptional level upon
  immune-challenge are shown by green boxes
