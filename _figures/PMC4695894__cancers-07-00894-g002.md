caption: Role of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) in DNA damage response
  and repair. (A) Regulation of GLI1 by DNA damage. DNA damage increases expression
  of p53, which in turn activates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of GLI1, suppressing
  cellular proliferation. In contrast, after DNA damage, cells lacking functional
  p53 are unable to suppress GLI1 in this manner and, therefore, are more proliferative;
  (B) Regulation of DNA repair by GLI1. GLI1 inhibits mismatch repair (MMR) and double
  strand break (DSB) repair through its regulation of MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) and ataxia
  telangiectasia-mutated protein kinase (ATR)/checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) signaling,
  respectively. At the same time, GLI1 activates nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  and DSB repair by regulating c-JUN and BH3 domain-only death agonist protein (BID)-ATR/CHK1
  pathway, respectively. The magnitude of DNA damage and cell line individuality may
  decide the fate of GLI1 following DNA damage and its subsequent repair.
