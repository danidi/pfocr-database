caption: Catabolic pathway and gene organization for hydroxycinnamic acid degradation
  in P. putida F1. fcs encodes feruloyl-CoA synthetase, ech encodes an enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase
  and vdh encodes vanillin dehydrogenase. The three genes are located in a cluster
  with a marR-type repressor gene (hcaR) located upstream and divergently transcribed.
  The gene names and corresponding locus tag numbers are indicated, and the correspondingly
  coloured arrows in the pathway indicate the reactions catalyzed by each enzyme.
  The intermediates in hydroxycinnamic acid degradation are further degraded, as indicated,
  via the β-ketoadipate pathway. The intermediates vanillin, vanillate, 4-hydroxybenzoate
  and protocatechuate are sensed by the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein PcaY [].
  The expression of pcaY is coordinately controlled with catabolic genes for the conversion
  of protocatechuate to TCA cycle intermediates by the transcriptional activator PcaR
  when sufficient β-ketoadipate accumulates [].
