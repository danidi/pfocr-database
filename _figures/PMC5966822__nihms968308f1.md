caption: 'OTC deficiency: a urea cycle disorder. The urea cycle is the metabolic pathway
  responsible for detoxification of excess and waste nitrogen. With each turn of the
  cycle, 2 nitrogen atoms are converted to urea, which can be safely excreted by the
  kidneys. Deficiency of the OTC enzyme, which catalyzes the production of citrulline
  from ornithine and carbamyl phosphate, prevents the formation of urea and leads
  to an accumulation of ammonium (NH4). Systemic alkalosis converts NH4 to the more
  toxic form, ammonia (NH3). High levels of NH3 are toxic to the brain and lead to
  the symptoms seen in OTC deficiency, including confusion, brain edema, and coma.
