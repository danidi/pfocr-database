caption: NADPH oxidase inhibition targets deleterious microglial activation. Increasing
  evidence points to NADPH oxidase (also called phagocytic oxidase (PHOX)) as a critical
  mechanism of microglia-mediated neuron damage. Traditional anti-inflammatory approaches
  focus on specific downstream targets, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). However,
  targeting NADPH oxidase inhibits the global pro-inflammatory response further upstream
  in the process of neurotoxic microglial activation and is able to inhibit a broad
  spectrum of cytokines, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species to confer neuroprotection.
  At present, small molecules, peptides, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and an antibiotic
  have been identified that inhibit microglial NADPH oxidase and are neuroprotective.
  Further research is warranted to discover the mechanisms through which these seemingly
  diverse compounds work and to identify more specific inhibitors of this key neurotoxic
  pathway. This figure is modified from Zhang et al. []. IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor
  necrosis factor.
