caption: 'Substituting SNORD115 with an oligonucleotide. A: Secondary structure of
  the serotonin receptor 2C pre-mRNA that encompasses exon Vb between the proximal
  (PS) and distal (DS) splice sites (yellow). Intron V is shown in small letters.
  In this structure, the distal splice site is blocked and the proximal site used.
  Binding of SNORD115 to the boxed site likely causes a structural change, similar
  to binding of pyrvinium pamoate [], which activates the distal site. Editing of
  up to four adenosines (red boxes) to guanosines similarly activates the distal splice
  site by weakening the RNA stem. Oligo#5 complementary to the green region strongly
  activates the distal site []. B: Gene structure of the 5HT2C. Exons are shown as
  boxes and the alternative splice patterns indicated by dashed lines. The region
  in (A) is indicated by a yellow box and the location of oligo#5 is shown. The start
  codon in exon III is indicated by a round arrow. Skipping of exon Vb results in
  an early stop codon (open square arrow), whereas its inclusion results in a later
  stop codon (black square arrow). C: RNA isoforms generated by the processing events.
  Exon Vb skipping generates RNA1 and its inclusion generates RNA2. Due to editing
  combinations, RNA2 represents 32 RNA isoforms. SNORD115 and oligo#5 promote the
  inclusion of the non-edited exon Vb. D: Protein isoforms generated by the processing
  events. RNA2 encodes 24 isoforms, one non-edited isoform 5HT2C_FL_INI with the amino
  acids INI in the second intracellular loop and 23 isoforms (5HT2C_FL_ed) that are
  edited. Circles in the second intracellular loop of the serotonin receptor 2C indicated
  non-edited amino acids and stars depict the editing events. E: Effect of the isoform
  ratios in on signaling POMC-neurons. Left: 5HT2C_tr is present in intracellular
  membranes (ER/golgi) and sequesters the full-length receptor, stopping its signaling
  at the plasma membrane (PM). The lack to signaling does no inhibit food intake,
  such generating an orexic response. Right: A relative decrease of 5HT2C_tr caused
  by SNORD115 or oligo#5 leads to an increased occupation the full-length receptors
  at the plasma membrane surface and its signaling via the phospho lipase C (PLC)
  pathway. PLC activation induces c-fos, which activates POMC transcription. The resulting
  POMC peptide is processed into alpha Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (αMSH), which
  activates Melanocortin 4 receptors (MCR4) receptors in the paraventricular nucleus,
  which results in an anorexic behavior response.'
