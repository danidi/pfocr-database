caption: TSP-1-CD36 signaling is inducing apoptosis of tumor associated epithelial
  cells. As a result of TSP-1 binding to CD36 on microvascular endothelial cells,
  phosphorylation and, therefore, activation of P59fyn (cytoplasmic protein kinase)
  occur. This in turn stimulates caspase-like proteases, which induce the phosphorylation
  of MAPK. Nuclear translocation of MAPK generates increased expression of caspase-3
  and of proapoptotic receptors, leading to apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage leads
  to the release of reactive oxygen species and of cytochrome C, which are also triggers
  of apoptosis. Moreover, the binding of THC-1 to CD36 induces the recruitment of
  SHP-1 to the VEGFR2 complex, followed by VEGFR2 dephosphorylation and inhibition
  of the VEGF pathway and leading to anti-angiogenesis. (Reproduced with permission
