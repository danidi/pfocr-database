caption: Coupling between Akt-mediated cellular energy metabolism, cell survival and
  proliferation. Following activation by PI3K, PDK1, and mTORC2, Akt increases cellular
  ATP production by accelerating both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism. Akt may
  increase oxidative phosphorylation by enhancing metabolic coupling between glycolysis
  and oxidative phosphorylation through facilitation of mitochondrial hexokinase (mtHK;
  i.e. HKI and HKII) association with VDAC and mitochondria, and by as yet unknown
  mechanisms. By facilitating mtHK association with mitochondria, Akt increases cell
  survival. Akt also enhances glycolytic flux by multiple mechanisms. First, it increases
  glucose (Glc) uptake by increasing the expression of Glc transporters (GLUT1, GLUT2,
  and GLUT4), and, in some cases, by promoting translocation to the plasma membrane.
  Second, enhanced coupling between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis may also
  kinetically favor enhanced glycolytic flux. Third, hyperactive Akt activates mTORC1,
  which promotes HIF1α accumulation under normoxic conditions and increases GLUT1,
  HKII, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) abundance. The increased capacity for both
  Glc transport and phosphorylation results in increased glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P)
  availability for utilization in both glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). Fourth, Akt phosphorylates and activates phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK2), which
  leads to allosteric activation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) by the PFK2 product
  fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2 ). Citrate generated in the mitochondrial
  TCA cycle is exported to the cytoplasm, where it is utilized for acetyl-coA generation
  by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), which is directly phosphorylated and activated by Akt.
  By increasing citrate utilization, Akt may help drive TCA cycle flux, in addition
  to providing precursors for lipid biosynthesis for new membrane generation. Finally,
  Akt-increased cellular ATP levels serve to maintain low AMPK activity, which is
  required for full mTORC1 activation. As the most critical downstream effector of
  Akt, mTORC1 is largely responsible for the contributions of Akt to cell growth,
  cell proliferation, and susceptibility to oncogenic transformation.
