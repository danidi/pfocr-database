caption: ERE-independent and ERE-dependent ERα signaling pathways distinctly convey
  estrogen negative feedback on gonadotropin subunit expression and secretion. The
  ERE-independent pathway conveys estrogen suppression of FSHβ expression, whereas
  estrogen suppression of serum FSH requires ERE-dependent signaling. These effects
  may be mediated through distinct ERα pathway effects on activin/inhibin subunit
  expression. In contrast, estrogen pathways distinctly suppressed LHβ expression
  but did not decrease pituitary LH content. Thus, our previous observation of an
  ERE-independent ERα-mediated estrogen suppression of serum LH () likely occurred
  as the result of reduced secretion and not synthesis, possibly via altered hypothalamic
  GnRH. *, Serum FSH and FSHβ expression levels in ovary-intact vs. OVX + E2 wild-type
  mice suggest that ovarian factors besides estrogen, likely inhibin, are additionally
  required for full suppression.
