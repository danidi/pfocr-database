caption: 'TRPV1-CNTF signaling cascade in PD. Capsaicin-mediated stimulation of TRPV1
  through activation of CNTFRα and the STAT pathway increases dopaminergic neuron
  viability in PD rat models. Activation of TRPV1 has also been associated with a
  reduced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species/reactive
  nitrogen species in a PD rat model. TRPV1: transient receptor potential vanilloid
  1 channel; CNTFRα: ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor α subunit.'
