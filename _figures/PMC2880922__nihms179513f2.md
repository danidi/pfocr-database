caption: The jasmonate biosynthetic pathway and signaling. Arabidopsis and tomato
  mutants used in this study are indicated. The JA precursor α-linolenic acid (α-LA),
  an 18:3 fatty acid (18:3 FA) is produced from linoleic acid, an18:2 fatty acid (18:2
  FA) by fatty acid desaturase (FAD) enzymes [, , ]. JA biosynthesis begins with the
  release of α-LA from chloroplast membranes by the action of a lipase []. JA biosynthesis
  is inhibited in the Arabidopsis mutant fad7-2 (fatty acid desaturase 7-2) and the
  tomato mutant spr2 (suppressor of prosystemin-mediated responses 2) because loss
  of function of fatty acid desaturase 7 (FAD7) in these mutants limiting availability
  of linolenic acid [, ]. α-LA is subsequently transformed to 3-oxo-2(2′(Z)-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic
  acid (OPC-8) by sequential activities of lipoxygenase (LOX, EC 1.13.11.12), allene
  oxide synthase (AOS), allene oxide cyclase (AOC, EC 5.3.99.6) and 12-oxo-phytodienoic
  acid (OPDA) reductase 3 (OPR3, EC 1.3.1.42) enzymes [, , ]. OPC-8 is activated by
  OPC-8 ligase 1(OPCL1) to produce OPC-8-CoA []. OPC-8-CoA undergoes three cycles
  of β-oxidation in the peroxisome to form JA, and these steps are catalyzed by acyl-CoA
  oxidase (ACX, EC 1.3.3.6), multi functional protein (MFP), and L-3-ketoacyl-CoA
  thiolase (KAT, EC 2.3.1.16). The acx1/5 (acyl-CoA oxidase 1/5) Arabidopsis mutant
  and the acx1(acyl-CoA oxidase 1) tomato mutant are compromised in the first β-oxidation
  step, leading to deficiency in JA [, , , ]. JA is metabolized to the volatile derivative
  MeJA by a JA carboxy methyl transferase (JMT, EC 2.1.1.141) []. The reversible reaction
  catalyzed by a MeJA esterase (MJE) converts MeJA to JA []. JA is activated by conjugation
  to Ile by jasmonate resistant 1 (JAR1) to form jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) [].
  The Arabidopsis jar1-1(jasmonate resistant 1-1) mutant is impaired in JA-Ile production
  in response to mechanical wounding []. Other jasmonoyl-amino acid conjugates (JACs)
  are present in plants [] and some of these e.g. jasmonoyl-tryptophan (JA-Trp) modulate
  other hormone pathways []. The Arabidopsis coi1 (coronatine insensitive 1) and tomato
  jai1 (jasmonate insensitive 1) mutants are insensitive to JA due to a compromised
  JA-Ile receptor coronatine insensitive 1 (COI1) [, , , ]. Binding of JA-Ile to the
  COI1 receptor leads to degradation of jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins that repress
  JA-responsive genes resulting in various JA-signaled responses [, , , ].
