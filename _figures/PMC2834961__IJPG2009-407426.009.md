caption: Schematic of the metabolic flux and expression of genes involved in sucrose
  to starch pathway in developing wheat seed.  Black arrows indicate enzymatic reactions.
  Blue broken arrows represent transport of metabolites across amyloplast membranes.
  Enzyme and transporter names are in green. Upper box legend indicates level of gene
  expression and lower box legend indicates the time or developmental stage as days
  postanthesis. Only the expression of genes represented on the cDNA array is shown.
