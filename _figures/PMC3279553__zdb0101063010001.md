caption: Roles of SPT, CerS, and sphingomyelinase (SMase) in the metabolism of ceramides.
  De novo synthesis of ceramide is initiated by the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA
  by SPT to generate the sphingoid backbone. A range of saturated and unsaturated
  fatty acids (acyl-CoA) can be subsequently incorporated by CerS (LASS) isoforms
  to form the ceramide sidechain. The salvage pathway, responsible for the cycling
  between ceramide and complex sphingolipids, also involves CerS activity and can
  also promote ceramide accumulation upon fatty acid oversupply. See references ()
  and (24) for further details of sphingolipid metabolism. Inflammation can promote
  ceramide release from sphingomyelin through the activation of SMase by cytokines.
  Studies in intact cells and in vivo suggest that ceramide (and possibly also complex
  sphingolipids) can affect insulin action at least in part by inducing further stress
  signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction as well as by directly inhibiting insulin
  signal transduction.
