caption: A pathway depicting genetic control of ventral furrow and anterior midgut
  invagination and a role in that network for mechanical cues. Snail expression is
  responsible for the mechanical cues produced by the first phase of myosin II contraction.
  Strain within the epithelium may redirect actomyosin to the apical cap and activate
  fog signaling which act during the second, Twist-dependent phase to stabilize actomyosin
  contractions and drive epithelial folding. Furrowing and invagination in Twist mutants
  can be rescued by exogenously applied strain either by laser ablation or by physical
  indentation. In the case of invagination-rescued anterior midgut differentiation,
  larval development was also reported to be rescued.
