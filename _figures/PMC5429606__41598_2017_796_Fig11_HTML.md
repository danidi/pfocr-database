caption: Model of PGC-1α/NRF2-Sirt3 pathway in regulating NaF-induced nephrotoxicity.
  PGC-1a interacts with NRF2 as a transcriptional coactivator and its reduction decreases
  Sirt3 transcription. A reduction in Sirt3 decreases the deacetylation of FoxO3a
  and SOD2, resulting in ROS accumulation. Increased ROS level activates ERK1/2, resulting
  in cellular apoptosis.
