caption: Tau neuroinflammatory cascade. In early stages of tau structural metamorphosis,
  some proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL6 and TNF-α) and chemokines (fractalkine)
  can modify tau phosphorylation patterns and thus change the structure and function
  of tau protein. The major sources of proinflammatory cytokines are activated microglia
  and astrocytes. Glial cells can be activated by different inducers, including misfolded
  tau protein. At this stage, however, the phosphorylated tau protein would not necessarily
  aggregate into the filamentous structures (A). In later stages, when misfolded hyperphosphorylated
  tau proteins form mature NFTs, inflammation could either accelerate or modify tangle
  formation. Several components of the brain's immune system, including cytokines
  and proteins of the complement pathway, have been shown to be involved in the molecular
  dialogue between activated glial cells and tangle-bearing neurons (B).
