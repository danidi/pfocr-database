caption: 'Overview of signalling and muscle proteins synthesis (MPS) responses induced
  by amino acids (AAs) and different contraction intensities. An increase in intracellular
  AAs leads to the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) and its
  associated downstream protein substrates: 4E‐binding protein 1 (4E‐BP1) and p70
  ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), promoting assembly of the pre‐initiation complex
  and mRNA translational efficiency. AA‐induced increases in MPS are transient and
  return back to baseline despite elevated AAs. Exercise prior to AA availability
  enhances protein synthetic responses which may persist for >24 h, resulting in greater
  net protein accretion. Resistance exercise (RE) favours stimulation of myofibrillar
  (myo) MPS through activation of the mTORC1 pathway, with repeated bouts leading
  to accumulation of contractile proteins and muscle hypertrophy. Endurance exercise
  (EE) favours stimulation of mitochondrial (Mito) protein synthesis through activation
  of 5′ AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) and stimulation of proteins involved in
  mitochondrial biogenesis. Repeated performance of EE increases muscle mitochondrial
  content increasing oxidative capacity. Phospholipase D (PLD), phosphatidic acid
  (PA), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), peroxisome proliferator‐activated
