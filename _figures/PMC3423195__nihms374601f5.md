caption: Network analysis demonstrates critical pathways impacted by protein carbonylation.
  The network was generated based on the KEGG assignments of the proteins identified
  and their co-occurrence in pathways. Colors correspond to KEGG pathways as indicated.
  Most proteins were found to belong to multiple pathways, demonstrating their locale
  in the network. Proteins with many pathway associations can be found central to
  the map, while peripheral proteins demonstrate segregation to a single pathway.
