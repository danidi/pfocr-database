caption: Summary of the benzoxazinoid metabolic pathway as well as the relative expression
  levels and patterns of key genes in the hybrids. Genes with the associated EC number
  are provided. Accessions encode the differentially accumulated proteins identified
  in this study. BX1, benzoxazinless1; BX2 to BX5, cytochrome P450 enzymes; BX8 and
  BX9, UDP-glucosyltransferases; BX6, dioxygenase; BX7, O-methyltransferase; and DIBOA,
  2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4 H)-one.
