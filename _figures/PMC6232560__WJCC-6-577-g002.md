caption: 'Mechanisms of bile acids initiating colorectal cancer development. (1) High
  concentrations of bile acids (BAs) could cause a focal destruction of intestinal
  epithelium, subsequently stimulate repair mechanisms involving inflammatory reactions
  and hyper-proliferation of undifferentiated cells. These processes could cause a
  cell transition into a precancerous state and are considered as an early priming
  step in colorectal tumorigenesis; (2) BAs strongly induce reactive oxygenic species
  and reactive nitrogen species production via its stimulatory effect on nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and phospholipase A2, and mitochondrial damage.
  These reactive species cause damage on DNA, and disrupt the base excision repair
  pathways; (3) After chronic exposure to BAs at physiological concentration, colon
  epithelial cells become resistant to apoptosis. This is because BAs induce the degradation
  of tumor suppressor p53, and up-regulate the expression of X-linked inhibitor of
  apoptosis protein protein. The cells with genomic errors coupled with apoptosis
  resistance ability rapidly get much further mutation and ultimately become cancer
  cells; (4) BAs induce colonic epithelial cells becoming CSCs through muscarinic
  cholinergic receptor receptor and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This pathway leads to
  nuclear translocation of β-catenin to form a complex with T cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor family transcription factors that acts as a co-activator to express
  c-Myc, a gene regulating cell stemness. NADPH oxidase: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate oxidase; MR3: Muscarinic cholinergic receptor 3; ROS: Reactive oxygenic
