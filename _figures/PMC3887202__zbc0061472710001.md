caption: De novo synthesis of steroids, oxysterols, and bile acids from cholesterol.
  A, various specialized tissues can use cholesterol as the building block for the
  synthesis of steroid hormones, oxysterols, or bile acids. Cholesterol endogenously
  synthesized through the mevalonate pathway is transported by TSPO and STAR into
  the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it can be converted to the steroid pregnenolone
  or the oxysterol 27HC by CYP11A1 or CYP27A1, respectively. Pregnenolone is the precursor
  of all of the other steroids (e.g. aldosterone and cortisol in adrenal glands or
  sex steroids in gonads). The oxysterol 27HC serves as an intermediate for bile acid
  synthesis in hepatic cells. B, Oil Red O staining of lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 cells
