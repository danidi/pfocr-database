caption: Signaling pathways linking EphA and RhoA in regulation of cell adhesion/repulsion.
  A) In tumor cell lines and neurons, EphA is thought to stimulate RhoA activation,
  which causes cell de-adhesion/repulsion via increased stress fiber formation. This
  can occur via several pathways, including regulation of both Rho GEFs (Ephexin)
  and GAPs (p190). B) In Xenopus epithelia, RhoA stabilizes pre-existing cell-cell
  adhesions via interactions with cadherins. EphA forward signaling may antagonize
  this function via a pathway involving Pak1 kinase and Cdc42, causing loss of adhesion.
