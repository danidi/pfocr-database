caption: The nutrient environment and/or growth signaling by TCR influences UDP-GlcNAc
  production by the hexosamine pathway, which in turn regulates N-glycan branching
  in the Golgi to control galectin-glycoprotein lattice strength. Subsequent changes
  in cell surface receptor membrane localization and concentration results in differential
  responses to external factors (eg. Growth factors, peptide-MHC) that signal to the
  nucleus.
