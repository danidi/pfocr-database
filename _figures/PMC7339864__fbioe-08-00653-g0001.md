caption: Overview on the construction of a temperature-responsive yeast cell factory
  for crocetin biosynthesis. (A) De novo crocetin biosynthetic pathways from glucose.
  The carotenogenic genes were shown in orange and the crocetin biosynthetic pathway
  genes were shown in red. (B) The strategy of GAL4M9 based temperature switch to
  synchronize zeaxanthin biosynthesis (denoted by the activity of Crt) and cleavage
  (denoted by the activity of CCD2, equivalent to crocetin biosynthesis). The traditional
  two-stage fermentation strategy (left panel) resulted in physical separation of
  the substrate zeaxanthin (efficient synthesis at 30°C and storage at the cellular
  membranes) the CCD2 enzyme (functional at lower temperatures), accordingly low zeaxanthin
  conversion yield. In the temperature-responsive strain, zeaxanthin biosynthesis
  and CCD2 functional expression were synchronized at the lower temperature stage
  and higher zeaxanthin conversion yield could be achieved. CrtE, lycopene ε-cyclase;
  CrtYB, bifunctional phytoene synthase and lycopene cyclase; CrtI, phytoene desaturase;
  CrtZ, β-carotene hydroxylase; CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; ALDH, aldehyde
  dehydrogenase; GAL4, transcription factor for activating GAL regulon genes; GAL4M9,
  GAL4 mutant showing low temperature induction.
