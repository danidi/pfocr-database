caption: 'Inferred role of ACSL1 in sepsis. The experimental context in which the
  increase in ACSL1 expression was initially observed is represented in the panel
  above (GSE49755). Open questions include: #1 What are the factors in the plasma
  of septic patients that induce ACSL1 expression in neutrophils? #2 Which signaling
  pathway is involved in regulation of ACSL1 following plasma exposure? #3 What is
  the role of ACSL1 in sepsis? Regarding question #1 (arrows down): briefly as suggested
  by the data presented on  ACSL1 is induced in blood by a wide range of pathogen-derived
  factors and ACSL4 by a narrower range of factors (putatively attributed to the flagellated
  bacteria TLR5 agonist, flagellin). Regarding question #2 (oblique arrow): ACSL1
  is known to contribute to the activation of inflammasomes in macrophages, which
  in turn leads to release of proinflammatory factors (). Based on differential and
  co-expression analyses we infer that it might also be the case of ACSL4, for instance
  during responses to infection caused by flagellated bacteria. We also infer that
  ACSL-mediated inflammasome activation operates in neutrophils and also in the context
  of sepsis, which are also points that remain to be established. Neutrophil contribution
  to the cytokine storm observed during sepsis and subsequent immunopathology is well-documented.
  We thus assume that upregulation of ACSL1 observed during sepsis is of potential
  clinical relevance. An assertion that is supported by differential levels of induction
  observed following exposure to plasma of subject who recovered vs. those who died
  ().'
