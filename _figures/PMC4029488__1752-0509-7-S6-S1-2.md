caption: 'A HFPN model of extended center metabolism pathway in E. coli. This model
  includes three major parts: glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway part, PTS part
  and glycogen metabolism pathway part, and they are bordered by light green lines
  respectively. Cyan border and D marked transitions are degradation or dilution processes
  of their connected metabolites or enzymes. Black border components are of the three
  major parts. Red border components are of regulatory mechanisms, in which transition
  ptsG and ptsHIcrr represent PTS genes expression process; G_cAMP is the process
  of PEIIAGlc activating cAMP production; Dimer is the process of EI dimerization;
  k is the parameter controlling the whole PTS reaction speed; Location is of the
  molecular subcellular localization regulation mechanism; (P)HPr::GlgP represent
  the process of the binding of (P)HPr::GlgP catalyzing glycogen decomposition. This
  is the snapshot of main part of our HFPN model, other components can be found in
  Additional files in URL [].'
