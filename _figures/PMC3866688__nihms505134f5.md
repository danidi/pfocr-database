caption: Targets of immunosuppressive drugs used in solid organ transplantation, according
  to the 3-signal model of T-cell activation. T-cell activation is initiated by signal
  1, which is delivered by the interaction between the TCR and the MHC-peptide complex
  presented by the APC. In transplantation, signal 1 can be delivered through the
  direct and/or indirect pathways of allorecognition and it defines the specificity
  of the alloimmune response. Signal 1 alone is not capable of generating productive
  T-cell responses. However, in combination with signal 2 (also known as the costimulatory
  signal), signal 1 triggers several intracellular signaling pathways, such as the
  calcium-calcineurin pathway, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, and
  the protein kinase C/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway; together, these activate
  transcription factors that mediate cell survival and expression of cytokines. Several
  cytokines (IL-2, IL-15, IL-4, IL-7, IL-21) induce proliferation (signal 3) through
  the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways.
  APCs express different costimulatory molecules; many deliver activation signals
  that amplify signal 1 and prevent T-cell anergy (eg, CD28-CD80/86 and CD154-CD40
  pathways), whereas others inhibit T-cell activation (eg, CTLA4-CD80/86 and PD1-PDL1/PDL2
  pathways).
