caption: 'Proposed model of bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cell expansion by
  the inhibition of TC-PTP (1): In the absence of TC-PTP, HSCs in the BM secrete high
  amounts of IL-18. (2): IL-18 induces the secretion of IFN-γ and other pro-inflammatory
  cytokines by nearby cells. (3): This creates a local inflammation (4) leading to
  activation of Stat1. (5a): The Stat1 signaling pathway can induce the expansion
  of HSC. (5b): The increased production IFN-γ and other pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-12 further contribute to the expansion of HSC. (6): The cytokine milieu
  also induces increased expression of Sca-1 on the surface of HSC. The localized
  and temporary inflammatory state triggers a negative feedback mechanism to the HSC
  and induces the production of IL-18 binding protein (IL-18bp). (5c): The presence
  of IL-18bp and cytokines expands the number of HSC and (7) facilitates their migration
  to the periphery. Abbreviations: HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; IFN-γ, interferon-gamma;
  IL, interleukin.'
