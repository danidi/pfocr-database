caption: Ligands that belong to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily are originally
  expressed on cell surfaces. Most of them are oligomerized into trimers and later
  cleaved by metalloproteases. On cell plasma membrane, the binding between TNF ligands
  and their receptors in the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily initiates
  multiple intracellular signaling pathways. For instance, the cytoplasmic region
  of TNFR after ligand binding will recruit the scaffold protein called TNF receptor
  associated factor (TRAF), which will further turn on the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  NF-κB is an important transcription factor in inflammation as an activator of numerous
  pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The red dashed arrow in the figure indicates
  the cleavage of TNF ligands into their soluble forms, while the black arrows illustrate
  the downstream signaling pathways activated by TNF ligand-receptor interactions.
