caption: Cross talk between macrophages and hepatocytes and the regulation of hepcidin
  expression. Data from this study and from previous work by our group () suggest
  that cross talk between macrophages and hepatocytes is important in controlling
  the production and release of hepcidin, the central regulator of iron homeostasis.
  These effects appear to be mediated by macrophage production of the proinflammatory
  cytokine IL-1β, which activates the C/EBP pathway in HuH7 cells. In the context
  of hypoxia, we observed a decrease in macrophage production of IL-1β. In addition,
  there are direct effects of hypoxia on SMAD4 protein levels in the cytosol and nucleus
  of HuH7 cells. Together, these mechanisms serve to abrogate the BMP/SMAD signaling
  pathway that is crucial for the regulation of hepcidin expression. HAMP, hepcidin
  antimicrobial peptide; B, BMP/SMAD-responsive element; C, CCAAT enhancer-binding
  protein responsive element; E, E-box elements; S, STAT3-responsive element.
