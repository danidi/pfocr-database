caption: Co-expression network analysis of osteosarcoma. Significantly coefficient
  KEGG pathway network (a, left) was visualized with augmented index degrees (circles
  from cyan to red). Co-expressed DEGs were integrated into networks using bioinformatics
  methodology (b, right). Positive/negative function among common genes (rectangles,
  blue) and even tightly clustered elements (purple and green) were displayed with
  different colors (red and black).
