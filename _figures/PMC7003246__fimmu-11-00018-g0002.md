caption: Targeting the CD47-SIRPα pathway in cancer. Therapeutic targeting of the
  CD47-SIRPα pathway can cause elimination of cancer cells through multiple mechanisms.
  First, inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα interaction using an anti-CD47 antibody, an
  anti-SIRPα antibody, or a recombinant SIRPα protein, leads to phagocytic uptake
  of tumor cells by macrophages. Second, anti-CD47 antibodies enable phagocytic uptake
  of tumor cells by dendritic cells and subsequent antigen presentation to CD4+ and
  CD8+ T-cells, thereby stimulating an anti-tumor adaptive immune response. Third,
  anti-CD47 antibodies eliminate tumor cells through natural killer cell-mediated
  antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and complement dependent cytotoxicity. Fourth, anti-CD47
  antibodies stimulate apoptosis of tumor cells through a caspase-independent mechanism.
