caption: Hh signaling conditions the milieu to support metastasis of breast cancer
  cells to the bone. Depicted here is the first of the two microenvironments, the
  milieu of the primary tumor. Hh signaling in the tumor cells impacts the stromal
  cells in the environment, which in turn amplify paracrine Hh signaling by producing
  growth factors that propel epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Concomitantly, secreted,
  soluble proteins produced by the primary tumor contribute towards conditioning the
  secondary site for the arrival of the tumor cells.
