caption: A) Oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF-1α/HIF-2α. Under conditions in which
  sufficient oxygen is present (normoxia), prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) catalyze the
  hydroxylation of two key proline residues within the oxygen dependent degradation
  domains of HIF-1α and HIF-2α. The hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by PHDs utilizes
  molecular oxygen and α-ketoglutarate (which is converted to succinate in the reaction)
  as co-substrates and ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and ascorbate as cofactors. These hydroxylation
  events form a binding site for the E3 ubiquitin ligase, VHL, which catalyzes ubiquitination
  and subsequent proteasomal degradation. An additional asparagine residue in the
  C-terminal activation domain is hydroxylated by factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). Hydroxylation
  of this asparagine residue disrupts binding of p300 to HIF-α, thereby inhibiting
  HIF-transcriptional activation potential. Under hypoxic conditions, PHD and FIH
  activity is inhibited and unhydroxylated HIF-1α and HIF-2α translocate to the nucleus,
  form a complex with ARNT and p300, and activate transcription of HIF-target genes.
  B). Transcriptional and translational control of HIF-1α/HIF-2α expression. Reactive
  oxygen species and pro-inflammatory conditions in the tumour microenvironment stimulate
  NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation of HIF-1α, leading to increased expression
  under normoxic conditions. Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway by PI3K activation
  or LKB1 loss of function, results in increased cap-dependent translation of HIF-α
  mRNA. Additionally, the RNA/DNA binding protein, YB-1 is induced in multiple cancer
  types, and can bind to HIF-1α mRNA to stimulate cap-dependent translation. This
  leads to increased normoxic expression of HIF- α in cells with constitutively active
  PI3K signaling.
