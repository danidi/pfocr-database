caption: This diagram illustrates the major components of the ESCRT pathway hijacked
  by HIV-1 to facilitate viral replication. ISG-15 is expressed in response to viral
  infection, and disrupts proper ESCRT pathway function by binding to, and preventing
  essential associations necessary for vesicle/virus budding. 1) ISG-15 is conjugated
  to CHMP5 thereby preventing LIP-5:CHMP5 association and subsequent localization
  to the plasma membrane. 2) Lack of LIP-5:CHMP5 at the plasma membrane prevents VPS-4
  associating with its coactivator, LIP-5 and ATPase activity that is essential for
  virus release. 3) CHMP2A is ISGylated in the presence of CHMP5:ISG-15, which prevents
  CHMP2A binding to LIP-5 and VPS-4. 4) CHMP6 is ISGylated thereby weakening association
  with VPS-4. 5) Unbound VPS-4 is released to the cytosol, and viral budding is inhibited.
  6) ISG15 expression prevents TSG101 interaction with GAG, and thereby prevents viral
  budding.
