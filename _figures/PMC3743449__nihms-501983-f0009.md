caption: Illustration of the role of the ubiquitin–proteasome system in protein quality
  aspects of atherosclerosis. In the initial phase of cardiovascular risk factor exposure,
  compensatory upregulation of chaperones and the ubiquitin–proteasome system prevents
  the overwhelming intracellular accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional proteins.
  The ubiquitin–proteasome system also contributes to the classical activation pathway
  of nuclear factor kappa-B and thereby to inflammation and cell proliferation. With
  the formation and growth of a metabolically active atherosclerotic plaque, there
  is further production of misfolded and damaged proteins in the progression phase.
  Once the classical protein quality mechanisms are overwhelmed and fail, these dysfunctional
  proteins accumulate (and aggregate) and autophagy remains the final clearance pathway.
  The accumulating proteins can undergo further oxidation, ubiquitination, and cross-linking.
  Furthermore, beta-pleated sheets can be formed and hence amyloid fibrils. In addition
  to intracellular proteins, proteins in the extracellular matrix can undergo conformational
  changes. For instance, oxidation and phospholipid hydrolysis of low-density lipoprotein
  (LDL) produces oxidatively modified and electronegative particles with unfolding
  of the apolipoprotein components. The generation of amyloid-like structures in this
  process serves as a potent “key” to the uptake of these modified LDLs by macrophages
  via scavenger receptors. Recognition of amyloid-like fibrils by CD36 leads to the
  production of reactive oxygen species, chemokines, and cytokines, which contributes
  further to the atherosclerotic disease process, including its complication phase.
