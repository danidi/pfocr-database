caption: 'Combined miRNA/mRNA regulatory and functional enrichment network. The network
  for miRNAs and their potential targets at day 7 after RRV challenge (listed in Table )
  was drawn based on the results of functional enrichment analysis performed using
  ToppCluster. 13 biological processes (light brown squares) and 2 pathways (blue
  diamonds) were overrepresented by 8 miRNAs (yellow circles) with their 14 potential
  targets (green hexagons). M: Biological processes related to morphology; I: Biological
  processes and a pathway related to Inflammation; L: A pathway related to Leukemia.'
