caption: Interfering with TNFα-TNFR2 signaling pathway via blocking the receptor.
  This schematic depicts our primary hypothesis based on the direct involvement of
  TNFα-TNFR2 axis in immunomodulatory functions observed by NSCs. In order to validate
  this hypothesis, we should hamper this signaling pathway either, a) by knocking
  out the TNFR2 gene or harvesting NSCs from TNFR2 KO mice or b) by neutralizing TNFR2
  expressed on NSCs using anti-TNFR2 monoclonal anti-body. Then, after creating these
  two co-culture conditions, one should assess if NSCs are still able to exert their
  immunosuppressive function on T cells. TCR, T cell receptor; mTNFα, membrane form
  of TNFα
