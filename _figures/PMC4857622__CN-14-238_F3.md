caption: Regulation of autophagy by mTOR-dependent and -independent pathways. Rapamycin
  or its analog CCI-779 inhibit mTORC1, causing activation of the ULK complex and
  the Vps34-beclin 1 complex to induce autophagy. Autophagy can also be induced upon
  overexpression of beclin 1, or of a peptide derived from it, respectively. A variety
  of mTOR-independent means to induce autophagy have been described, which seem to
  work along a cyclical pathway involving changes in cAMP, inositol signalling and
  intracellular calcium levels. Increased cAMP levels seem to inhibit autophagy, and
  blocking adenylate cyclase induces autophagy. cAMP activates PLC, generating IP3,
  which seems to inhibit autophagy. IP3 causes calcium release from ER stores, and
  increased intracellular calcium inhibits autophagy. Therefore, decreasing cytosolic
  calcium levels by blocking calcium release from the ER, or by blocking calcium entry
  through calcium channels, enhances autophagy. Similarly, decreasing intracellular
  free inositol or IP3 levels induces autophagy. Calcium also activates calpain, which
  in turn activates adenylate cyclase through Gsalpha, thereby creating a negative
  feedback loop resulting in the generation of more IP3, more calcium release from
  internal stores, and more autophagy inhibition. The precise mechanism(s) by which
  calcium inhibits autophagy remain unclear, but involve both early steps by inhibiting
  autophagosome synthesis, as well as late steps by interfering with autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion. Apart from these pathways, autophagy can also be upregulated by expression
  of TFEB, causing a coordinated increase in the expression of autophagy-related and
  lysosomal genes, by spermidine and resveratrol, which cause varied epigenetic changes
  to enhance autophagic flux, and by LAMP2A, which causes an increase in CMA. For
  further details see text.
