caption: 'When an insult occurs, cholangiocytes acquire the so called “reactive phenotype”
  which has 4 key features: (1) reduced apoptosis/increased proliferation (which results
  in the expansion of ductular cell populations); (2) enhanced secretion of chemokines
  and cytokines (which recruit immune cells promoting periductular inflammation);
  (3) generation of pro-fibrogenic factors such as PDGFBB (that drive the accumulation
  and activation of matrix producing myofibroblasts); (4) loss of epithelial features
  and gain of more mesenchymal phenotype, so-called Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition,
  EMT (which blocks epithelial differentiation and contributes to biliary fibrosis).
  These reactive cholangiocytes and the cells that they recruited produce Hh ligands.
  The Hh ligands, in turn, feedback and re-enforce the reactive ductular phenotype
  by acting as a) profibrogenic, b) proinflammatory, c) trophic, and d) EMT inducing
  signals. The Hh-enriched microenvironment thus perpetuates the ductular reaction.
  Because the Hh pathway drives the acquisition/perpetuation of a reactive phenotype
  in cholangiocytes, it is now recognized as a key player in all conditions characterized
  by cholangiocyte activation and ductular reaction.'
