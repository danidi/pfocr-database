caption: 'Differentially expressed genes (p-value ≤ 0.01 and log2 |fold change| ≥1)
  were shown in different metabolic pathways using heat maps with gene names or accession
  IDs. Metabolic pathways of S. elongatus PCC 7942 include carbon assimilation and
  nitrogen assimilation (GS/GOGAT pathway), transporter systems, and secondary metabolic
  pathways (methylerythritol phosphate pathway, MEP; chlorophyll a biosynthesis; carotenoid
  biosynthesis). Abbreviations: Pentose phosphate pathway, PPP; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,
  GAP; glucose-3-phosphate, G3P; pyruvate, Pyr; 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, DXP;
  α-ketoglutarate, AKG (or 2-OG); Acetyl-CoA, AcCoA; geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP;
  phytyl diphosphate, Pdh; L-glutamate, Glu; L-glutamine, Gln. The photosynthesis
  overall component contains photosystem I and photosystem II with APC and PC, cytochrome
  b6f complex and cytochrome c oxidase, and ATP synthase in thylakoid membrane.'
