caption: Effects of steamed bread and baked bread on the cytokine network (a) and
  central metabolic pathway metabolic network (b). In the cytokine network, the thickness
  of the lines represents the strength of intercellular communication (the concentration
  change rate of cytokine i); the red line represents enhanced communication, and
  the blue line represents inhibited communication; the arrow represents the direction
  from secretory cell to the target cell. In the metabolic network, the thickness
  of the line represents the quantitative metabolic pathway flux; the arrow represents
  the direction of metabolic flux. The correlation analysis between the changed (versus
  control) cytokines and the metabolic enzymes were assessed by Pearson’s correlation
  test. The correlation is given by r value. The red line represents a significant
  (p < 0.05) positive correlation and the blue line represents a significant (p <
  0.05) negative correlation.
