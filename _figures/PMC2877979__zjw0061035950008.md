caption: Schematic representation of some pathways and networks modified during strain
  improvement program according to results obtained after proteome comparison of NRRL
  1951, Wis 54-1255, and AS-P-78 strains. Font size is in concordance with the protein
  amount observed by CC staining strength in the comparative proteome analyses. αAA,
  α-aminoadipic acid; BDA1, 1,4-butanediol diacrylate esterase (putative β-lactamase);
  CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; CS, cysteine synthase; FDH, formate dehydrogenase;
  GR, glutathione reductase; GT, glutathione S-transferase; M, mitochondrion; MSD,
  methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; N, nucleus; P, peroxisome; PenG, benzylpenicillin;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; QO, quinone oxidoreductase; TCAC, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; TPP, thiamin pyrophosphate.
