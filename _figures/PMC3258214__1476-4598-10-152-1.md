caption: Bcl-3 signaling cascade. Diverse cytokines activate an IKK or IKK-related
  kinase to induce processing of the p105 precursor to p50, which in turn dimerizes
  and binds Bcl-3. Bcl-3 is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, both
  of which have a positive effect on its function. CYLD deubiquitinates Bcl-3 and
  prevents its nuclear translocation and GSK3. Bcl-3 is also phosphorylated by GSK3,
  which delays its degradation by the proteosomal pathway. Nuclear Bcl-3 can both
  induce and repress expression of a diverse array of genes.
