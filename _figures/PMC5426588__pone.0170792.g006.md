caption: In control colon S1P activates S1PR1 and S1PR2 and induce contractions that
  are dependent on calcium influx via L-type calcium channels, calcium release from
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum and calcium sensitization pathways including PKC and
  Rho kinase (A). In colitic colon however S1P induces larger contractions via S1PR2
  that are independent of calcium influx through L-type calcium channels yet it involves
  intracellular calcium release and calcium sensitization pathways (B). The contribution
  of these pathways however appears to be different in control and inflamed colon
  segments. Whereas the blockade of a single pathway completely abolishes the response
  to S1P in control segments, S1P induced contractions appear to be salvaged by other
  pathways in inflamed colon segments. Eradication of S1P induced contraction in inflamed
  colon require simultaneous blockade of intracellular calcium release (SERCA) and
  calcium sensitization pathways (PKC and Rho kinase).
