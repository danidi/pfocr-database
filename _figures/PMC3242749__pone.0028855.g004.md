caption: The existence of HtrA2 appears to be crucial for disease progression characterized
  by mitochondrial dysfunction, which contributes to neuronal cell death via up-regulation
  of the transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP. CHOP is known to repress Bcl2 (pro-survival)
  gene expression, which increases the proportion of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins such
  as Bax. Oxidative stress also leads to an up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2-
  protein Noxa, which can be activated by the transcription factor p53. Noxa exerts
  its pro-apoptotic function by neutralizing the pro-survival Bcl2 protein Mcl1/Al,
  thereby facilitating the activation of Bax/Bak proteins. CHOP is also known to regulate
  the extrinstic apoptotic signaling pathway by activating Death Receptor 5 (DR5),
  a member of the TNFR superfamily, by binding to its promoter region. Idebenone excerts
  anti-apoptotic effects on CHOP- and Noxa activation downstream of ATF4 and p53,
  respectively. Idebenone induces also anti-apoptotic effects on DR5 expression. Reseveratrol
  has been shown to reduce the expression of Bax, downstream of the CHOP- and Noxa
  activation cascades. Pro-apoptotic factors placed in grey boxes and anti-apoptotic
  factors placed in white boxes. Antioxidant compounds, used in this study, placed
  in white boxes with double lines, dashed lines stay for dependent interactions known
  from literature, solid lines represent dependent interactions drawing from experimental
  data shown her.
