caption: Figure 1. Stimulation of colorectal cancer cell growth, proliferation, migration,
  and peritumor angiogenesis and blood flow by the CBS/H2S axis. CBS utilizes l-cysteine
  and L-homocysteine to produce H2S in colorectal cancer cells. H2S acts as a mitochondrial
  electron donor, thereby stimulating oxidative phosphorylation. In addition H2S stimulates
  glycolysis via activation of GAPDH, most likely via its post-translational modification
  (sulfhydration). These responses facilitate ATP production, which is essential for
  growth, proliferation, and cell movement. Moreover, CBS-derived H2S may act an endogenous
  activator of the PI3K pathway, a classical pro-growth signaling pathway. Tumor-derived
  H2S may also diffuse out of the tumor tissue, thereby reaching peritumoral and intratumoral
  vascular tissue, where it increases the supply of the tumor cell with blood and
  nutritients via stimulation of neovessel formation (tumor angiogenesis) as well
  as by acting as a local vasodilator hormone.
