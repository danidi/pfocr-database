caption: Working model of the mechanisms of µ-opioid inhibition of EGF-induced ERK
  activation, astrocyte proliferation, and other cellular responses. As the CaM-dependent
  opioid signaling pathway does not appear to affect proliferation, pERK functions
  may differ depending upon its localization in the cell.
