caption: Model for central prostate cancer-related processes and their miRNA-mediated
  regulation. Solid-framed transcripts are predicted targets by miR-106b-25 cluster
  and/or miR-22. Dashed-framed transcripts are validated miRNA target genes. Arrows
  indicate activation, dashed lines inducement, and blunted arrows inhibition. (A)
  RHO/ROCK (RHO kinase) signaling regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics in several
  metastatic tumors (). ERK/MAPK regulates the actin cytoskeleton and contraction
  required to drive cell motility, whereas a down-regulation of ERK leads to cell
  migration (). We found ERK and GRLF1 targeted by miR-106b-25. (B) IL-6 mediated
  cell proliferation via activation of the MAPK pathway. Down-regulation of AKT and
  DUSP lead to an activation of MKK/JNK (), which is required for the growth of prostate
  carcinoma (). We found inhibitors such as AKT and DUSP targeted by miR-106b-25 and
  miR-22 indicating the oncomir character of the queried miRNAs. (C) Activation of
  the p53 pathway is induced by MAPK. The p53 pathway is actively involved in cell-cycle
  arrests and p53-dependent apoptosis (; ). We found central players of cell-cycle
  arrest targeted by miR-106b-25 and miR-22.  showed that p21 is a direct target of
  miR-106b and that its silencing plays a key role in cell-cycle progression by modulating
  check point functions.
