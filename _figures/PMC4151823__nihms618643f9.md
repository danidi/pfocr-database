caption: 'We hypothesize that WWOX is a key component contributing to the regulation
  and homeostasis of the TGFβ pathway likely in two critical ways: Firstly by binding
  and preventing the nuclear translocation of receptor-regulated SMADS (R-SMADs) that
  all contain PPxY motifs (PY box) such as SMAD3 (regardless of their phosphorylation
  status) and of key co-activators such as RUNX2, thus preventing the transcriptional
  activation of pro-metastatic genes. Secondly by competing with WW domain containing
  NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligases such as NEDD4L in charge of degradation of R-SMADs
  but more importantly also of inhibitory SMAD7 that contains a PY box as well ().
  In yet unreported studies we indeed observed a direct interaction between WWOX and
  SMAD7. In other words when WWOX is available inhibitory SMAD7 would be protected
  from degradation, thus serving as a potential reservoir of this important inhibitory
  protein ().'
