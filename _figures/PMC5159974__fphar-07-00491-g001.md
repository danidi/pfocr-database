caption: Reactivation of p53 pathway via Nutlin-3a in acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  (ALL). In response to oncogenic activation, ARF protein interacts with MDM2 sequestering
  it into the nucleolus. This binding prevents the proteasomal degradation of p53
  that activates its target genes promoting several functions like apoptosis, growth
  arrest, DNA repair, and senescence. In ALL, 9p21 locus deletion and MDM2 overexpression
  eliminate the tumor surveillance mechanism based on ARF-MDM2 interaction leading
  to the p53 degradation. Nutlin-3a, a small molecule targeting MDM2, restores p53
  pathway, suggesting a promising therapeutic option for ALL.
