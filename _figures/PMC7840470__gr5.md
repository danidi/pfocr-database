caption: 'Proposed signaling pathway for 14-3-3ε as a regulator in chronic stress-induced
  depression(A) FC-A (red) binds to a solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket created by
  the docking of a client motif (yellow); for example the phosphorylated S112 and
  S136 sites of Bad, within the 14-3-3 binding groove (green), simultaneously stabilizes
  both proteins (generated with PDB: 1O9F).(B) The hypothesized molecular mechanism
  underlying the antidepressant-like effect of FC-A in the VLO of Dep mice. Chronic
  stress induces downregulation of TrkB/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and alters the
  expression of 14-3-3ε, leading to the activation of Bad-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic
  signaling. Treatment with FC-A promotes the stabilization of 14-3-3ε:Bad complex
  and therefore prevents neuronal apoptotic signaling in the in the VLO and relieves
  depressive-like behaviors following CUMS.'
