caption: Androgen effects on the adrenergic system in the airway smooth muscle (ASM).
  (a) Testosterone (T), through a nongenomic effect, potentiates the relaxation induced
  by the β2-adrenergic agonist through the inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase
  (COMT) or by the abolition of extraneuronal uptake of catecholamines. The inhibition
  of these mechanisms by T or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT, a reduced metabolite
  of T) leads to the accumulation of catecholamines such as norepinephrine (NE). The
  β2-adrenergic agonist activates adenylyl cyclase (AC), leading to the activation
  of protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates K+ channels, ATPases, and myosin
  light-chain kinase (MLCK). These targets promote the relaxation of the ASM. (b)
  The androgen receptor (AR) signaling involves androgen crossing the plasma membrane,
  entering the cytoplasm, dissociation of chaperone proteins, and binding to the AR.
  Testosterone stimulation increases the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) expression
  in the guinea pig ASM and upregulates the Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa) and the
  voltage-dependent delayed rectifier K+ channels (KV). KCa are activated by increases
  in intracellular Ca2+ and through the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. In the ASM, the
  main K+ channels are the Ca2+-activated K+ channels of high conductance (BKCa).
  The KV channel subtypes characterized in the ASM are KV1.2 and KV1.5. T (nongenomic
  and genomic effects) favors the relaxation of the ASM and might contribute to decreasing
  asthma symptoms.
