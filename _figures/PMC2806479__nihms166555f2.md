caption: BDNF/TrkB signaling convergence on the MAP kinase pathway is implicated in
  both synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. The figure summarizes the evidence
  that BDNF is released from, and acts on, both pre- and postsynaptic compartments.
  BDNF has been repeatedly shown to enhance the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate
  from presynaptic nerve terminals. Postsynaptically, BDNF has been shown to phosphorylate
  some subunits of NMDA receptors. Following the binding of BDNF to the TrkB receptor,
  the signaling cascade converges on the MAP kinase pathway through the activation
  of ERK. Phosphorylated ERK then activates one or more of several targets such as
  CREB, other immediate early genes (IEG), cytoskeletal elements, protein synthesis,
  and/or voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. The MAP kinase pathway has been shown
  to have a clear role in learning and memory (for review, see ). (LDCV) Large dense
