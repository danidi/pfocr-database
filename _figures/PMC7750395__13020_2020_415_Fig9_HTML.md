caption: Graphic abstract of IAV-induced acute lung injury. Influenza A virus infected
  host alveolar epithelial cells and caused necrosis and injury in lung. The innate
  immune response began with the virus recognition and was amplified through activation
  of HMGB-1 and TLR4 signaling pathway. Extensive production of cytokines, chemokines
  produced by inflammation cells and amounts of peroxide products released from neutrophils
  exacerbated the injury of lung and multi organ failure in liver, thymus and spleen
  (red arrow). INAE treatment alleviated the acute lung injury and multi organ damage
  (green arrow) through the effects of anti-virus, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation
