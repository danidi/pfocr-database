caption: The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is associated with several cancer- and
  cell-proliferation-related signalling cascades. The p53 pathway can stimulate the
  PPP by inhibiting phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) through TP53-induced glycolysis and
  apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), and by inhibiting glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PDH). This enzyme is also targeted by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
  kinase, which increases G6PDH activity by phosphorylating heat shock protein 27
  (HSP27), and an NAD-dependent deacetylase (SirT2), which acts on this enzyme directly
  by de-acetylation. All three mechanisms activate the oxidative branch of the PPP,
  which is also controlled by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTOR) pathway.
  Cancer signalling mechanisms operate alongside allosteric and metabolic regulation.
  For instance, reduced pyruvate kinase PKM2 activity leading to triosephosphate isomerase
  (TPI) inhibition increases the carbohydrate flux towards the PPP, achieving a metabolic
  self-regulation that counteracts oxidative stress. The activity of the PPP itself
  has an influence on cancer signalling pathways. The antioxidant capacity of the
  PPP modulates proto-oncogene k-ras-driven tumourigenesis; concurrently, reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) can potentiate the oncogenic activity of k-ras (the two opposing
  regulations are highlighted). The PPP has also been associated with drug resistance
  and hypoxia. Depending on the sensitivity to imatinib, chronic myeloid leukaemia
  (CML) cells can either exhibit reduced (sensitive cells) or increased (resistant
  cells) transketolase (TKL) activity after hypoxia-inducible transcription factor
  1 (HIF-1) activation. F 2,6-BP, fructose 2,6-biphosphatase; P13K (Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase),
  Akt (protein kinase B); PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
