caption: Mechanism of Sec biosynthesis in eukaryotes and the Sec machinery-based pathway
  for synthesis of Cys. The pathway for Sec biosynthesis in eukaryotes is shown, in
  which phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase (PSTK) provides the phosphorylated intermediate PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec
  serving as a substrate for SecS. Selenophosphate (H2SePO3−) generated by SPS2 from
  selenite and ATP is used as a donor of active Se for SecS (see top right portion
  of the figure for the final steps in Sec biosynthesis). The de novo synthesis of
  Cys using the Sec biosynthetic machinery is shown on the bottom right (see text
  for details).
