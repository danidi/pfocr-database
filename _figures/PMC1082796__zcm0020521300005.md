caption: Virulence mechanisms of Afa/Dr DAEC. (I) In epithelial cells, Afa/Dr DAEC
  interacts with membrane-bound receptors (circle 1) including the recognition of
  DAF by Afa/DrDAF adhesins (, ) and of CEACAM1, CEA, and CEACAM6 by Afa/DrCEA adhesins
  (, ). In the polarized epithelial cells forming epithelium, receptor recognition
  develops at the apical domain expressing the brush border (arrows indicate the transport
  pathways of functional proteins in polarized epithelial cells) (, ). (II) The loss
  of microvilli results from a signaling pathway involving protein tyrosine kinase(s),
  phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and an increase
  in [Ca2+]i (circle 2) (), which controls the rearrangements of brush border-associated
  F-actin and villin cytoskeletal proteins (circle 3) (, ). The elongation of the
  microvilli (, ) also involves the activation of Rho GTPase Cdc42 (). Structural
  lesions in the brush border are accompanied by a decrease in the expression and
  enzyme activities of functional brush border-associated proteins, including SI,
  DPP IV, glucose transporter SGLT1, and fructose transporter GLUT5 (circle 3) (,
  ). The increased paracellular permeability is associated with the reorganization
  of TJ-associated proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, but does not affect the TER (circle
  4) (). (III) A MAPK-dependent signaling mechanism (circle 5) leads to the production
  of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, which triggers the transepithelial migration
  of PMNLs (circle 6) (). Afa/Dr DAEC bacteria interact with PMNLs (circle 7) (, ).
  In turn, PMNL transmigration promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  TNF-α and IL-1β (circle 8) (). The proinflammatory response induces the upregulation
  of DAF and MICA and abnormal expression of DAF at the basolateral domain (circle
  9) (, ). (IV) Internalization occurs in nonpolarized epithelial cells via a mechanism
  involving lipid rafts and dynamic microtubules (circle 10) (, , , , ). Recognition
  of α5β1 integrin by Afa/Dr invasins plays a pivotal role in bacterial internalization
  (, ). Internalized Afa/Dr DAEC bacteria survive within a large, late vacuole (circle
  11), which seems to result from the fusion of the early vacuoles, containing one
  bacterium, that are formed during the initial step of internalization (, , , ).
