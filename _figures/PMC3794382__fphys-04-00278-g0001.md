caption: Gene sets are not pathways. (A) shows a small part of the MAPK signaling
  pathway from KEGG. This pathway shows the location of various genes or gene products
  (inside the cell, outside of it, or in the membrane), what gene interacts with what
  other gene(s), the type of each interaction (activation, repression, phosphorylation,
  etc.), the direction of the signal propagation, and potentially many other things
  (e.g., complex formation, etc.). (B) presents the same part of the same pathway
  as a gene set (no interactions). The gene set has lost all the structure and the
  additional information captured by the original pathway. This comparison shows how
  much important knowledge existent in pathway database is ignored when pathways are
  treated as simple gene sets.
