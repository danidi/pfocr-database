caption: Schematic of the synthetic pathway for synthesis of a trimannosyl core glycan
  and transfer to acceptor sites in target proteins. Enzyme names in black are native
  to E. coli; enzyme names in red are heterologous. See text for details. Glycan in
  brackets to the right of open arrows depicts terminally sialylated structure common
  in human glycoproteins, but outside the scope of this study.
