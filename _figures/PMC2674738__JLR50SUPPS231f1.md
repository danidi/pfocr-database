caption: 'Circulating blood monocytes adhere to activated endothelium at sites of
  disease or injury. The monocyte becomes polarized and forms a pseudopod in response
  to a chemical gradient of chemotactic factor production like MCP-1 and follows the
  increasing concentration of the chemotactic factor into the tissue. PLA2 translocate
  to distinct compartments: iPLA2, PLC, and PLD to the pseudopod at the leading edge
  and cPLA2 to the endoplasmic reticulum posterior to the nucleus. LPA is generated
  by iPLA2 at the leading edge of the cell where it regulates actin polymerization
  and protrusion of the pseudopod. LPA also facilitates detection of the MCP-1 gradient
  since it was shown to regulate not only the speed but also the directionality of
  monocyte migration. AA is generated by cPLA2 and regulates the efficiency of monocyte
  migration through as yet unknown mechanisms. One regulatory role of PLD is its apparent
  upstream regulation of PA production that serves as a substrate for iPLA2 generation
  of LPA. PLC can influence chemotaxis by regulating actin polymerization via the
  phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase pathway.'
