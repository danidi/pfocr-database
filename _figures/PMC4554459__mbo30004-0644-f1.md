caption: A working model proposed for biotin metabolism and BioR-mediated regulation
  in Paracoccus denitrificans. (A) Schematic diagram for the two bacterial biotin-acquiring
  strategies (biotin biosynthetic pathway and biotin transport/uptake route). (B)
  Two half-reactions of BirA-proceeded AccB biotinylation. (C) BioR represses biotin
  biosynthesis pathway in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. (D) Negative autoregulation of
  BioR and its repression of both biotin biosynthesis pathway and biotin transport
  system in Brucella. (E) Complex regulation network of biotin metabolism by two BioR
  proteins in P. denitrificans. KAPA, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid; DAPA, 7, 8-diaminopelargonic
  acid; DTB, dethiobiotin; AMTOB, S-adenosyl-2-oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid; SAM,
  S-adenosyl methionine. BioF, 7-keto-8-amino pelargonic acid synthase; BioA, 7,8-diaminopelargonic
  acid aminotransferase; BioD, dethiobiotin synthase; BioB, biotin synthase; BirA,
  biotin protein ligase.
