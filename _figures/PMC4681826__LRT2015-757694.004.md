caption: BCR-ABL functioning in the presence and absence of Hsp90 inhibitors. (a)
  In CML cells, Hsp90 levels are elevated. Hence oncoprotein BCR-ABL binds to Hsp90
  for stabilization and maturation. Hence, stabilized BCR-ABL then activates many
  signaling pathways leading to CML cells survival, progression, and malignancy. (b)
  Blocking Hsp90 chaperone activity by employing Hsp90 inhibitors results in BCR-ABL
  degradation via ubiquitin proteasome pathway.
