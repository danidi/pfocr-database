caption: TGF-beta adhesion signaling highlighted in KEGG pathway analysis in parallel
  with SPIA pathway analysis by using microarray result of SNU-2404 set. Genes that
  were upregulated more than two-fold were highlighted in red in KEGG diagram and
  the list from SPIA pathway. Genes that were downregulated more than two-fold were
  highlighted in blue in KEGG diagram and the list from SPIA pathway. Genes that were
  up- or downregulated more than 1.5-fold were highlighted in purple in KEGG diagram.

  description: TGF-beta adhesion signaling highlighted in KEGG pathway analysis in
    parallel with SPIA pathway analysis by using microarray result of SNU-2404 set.
    Genes that were upregulated more than two-fold were highlighted in red in KEGG
    diagram and the list from SPIA pathway. Genes that were downregulated more than
    two-fold were highlighted in blue in KEGG diagram and the list from SPIA pathway.
    Genes that were up- or downregulated more than 1.5-fold were highlighted in purple
    in KEGG diagram.
