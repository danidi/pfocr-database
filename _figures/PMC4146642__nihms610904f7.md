caption: 'Some findings and discoveries related to Aβ(1-42) oligomer-induced oxidative
  stress and its sequela published from the Butterfield laboratory that contribute
  to a unifying oxidative stress centric hypothesis for neuronal death in AD that
  is consistent with the pathology, biochemical alterations, and clinical presentation
  in this disorder. Amyloid β-peptide, produced by β- and γ-secretase (top, middle
  panel), aggregates into extracellular fibrils forming the core of SP or aggregates
  into hydrophobic oligomers that insert into the plasma membrane. One-electron oxidation
  of the S-atom of Met-35 of Aβ(1-42) [see text] initates the chain reaction of lipid
  peroxidation (LPO), greatly amplyfing the damage of the initial free radical on
  the peptide. HNE, produced by LPO, binds to and causes dysfunction of key proteins
  in the PM and cytosol. Among the former are ion-motive ATPases, e.g., Na,K-ATPase
  and Ca-ATPase. The resultant loss of cell potential opens voltage gated Ca2+ channels,
  leading to a massive influx of Ca2+ to the cytosol (bottom, right panel), and subsequent
  attempts to sequester this Ca2+ in ER and mitochondria. However, this massive overload
  of Ca2+ causes ER to undergo unfolded protein response and damage and decreases
  protein synthesis. Mitochondrial Ca2+ overload causes swelling of mitochondria and
  opening of the MPTP with release of cytochrome c to initiate the intrinsic pathway
  for apoptosis (bottom, right panel). The intracellular Ca2+ also activates numerous
  degradative enzymes such as calpains, PLA2, endonucleases, etc. causing necrotic
  mechanisms to engage (see text). The oxidative stress in cytosol and mitochondria
  lead to damage to many glycolytic, TCA, and ETC enzymes or complexes, resulting
  in dramatic loss of ATP production (bottom, right panel), which leads to loss of
  many important neuronal functions, ranging from axonal transport to neurotransmission
  (bottom, left panel), as well as maintaining the cellular and organelle potentials.
  This oxidative stress also damages Pin1, which regulates both APP and Tau (top,
  left/middle panels), but also a key tau kinase (GSK-3β) and a tau phosphatase (PP2A).
  The resultant hyperphosphorylated tau, falls off microtubules (MT) [top, left panel],
  leading to cessation of anterograde and retrograde transport. Among other determimental
  consequences of this, synaptic-resident mitochondria are no longer able to produce
  the required ATP to maintain presynaptic function, including loss of LTP, needed
  for learning and memory (bottom, left panel). Note that Pin1 is involved in three
  major neuropathological hallmarks of AD: SP, NFT, and synapse loss. The intracellular
  detritus resulting from all these aberrant processes is not removed, since the proteostasis
  network of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), ER, and autophagy are all damaged
  by oxidative stress (see text). The Aβ(1-42)-initiated oxidative stress also leads
  to damage to heme oxygenase -1 (HO-1) and biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A), which
  decreases intracellular antioxidant bilirubin (top, middle panel; bottom, right
  panel). Moreover, glutathione (GSH) is decreased because of elevated oxidative stress
  and since its rate limiting synthetic enzyme, γ-Glu-Cys ligase, is damaged by oxidative
  stress. There are many other processes associated with oxidative stress on which
  we and others have published. However, this schematic diagram outlines some of the
  key processes involved in neuronal death in AD that fit the pathology, biochemical
  alterations, and clinical presentations observed in AD that were published from
  our laboratory based on neurochemical, oxidative stress, and proteomics studies
  of AD and its earlier forms.'
