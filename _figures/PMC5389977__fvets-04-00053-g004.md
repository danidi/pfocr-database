caption: Interaction of HER-activated pathways with canonical Wnt signaling. With
  the exception of human epidermal growth factor 2, the family of epidermal growth
  factor receptor-related receptors is activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF)
  or EGF-related proteins as well as by cMet/HGF. The activated tyrosine kinase activity
  results in activation of the phosphatidyl-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway that is downregulated by PTEN activity. Inactivating PTEN mutations
  are frequently found in mammary carcinomas. The HER pathway may also phosphorylate
  and activate Src, resulting in stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin. Activation
  of the Wnt pathway also results in stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin that stimulates
  gene transcription by forming a complex with T-cell transcription factors such as
  lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1. Both pathways are associated with development
  of therapy resistance. In our cell lines with high basal Wnt activity, inhibition
  of the PI3K/mTOR resulted in further increased Wnt activity, whereas SRC inhibition
  strongly inhibited Wnt activity.
