caption: 'TNFSFR and NF-κB signaling activation during macrophage activation: CpG
  late responses. Downstream effector molecules for these up regulated receptors were
  up regulated (TRAF3, SAPK2, TRAF1, FLIP, JUN) and the alternate pathway leading
  to apoptosis was down regulated (Casp8, APAF-1, BAG-1, PCD1, CAD), lending support
  to the conclusion that the entire pathway was activated and steered away from the
  apoptotic outcome. AP-1 components were up regulated, IκB was down regulated, and
  transcripts associated with transcription factor binding to DNA and protein products
  (TNF, COX2, iNOS) were increased (IL-1, A20) at late time points after treatment
  with CpG. Green = down regulated, red = up regulated, * = activation, P = phosphorylation,
  → = binds/interacts with, —| = blocks binding/interaction of.'
