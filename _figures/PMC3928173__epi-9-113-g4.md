caption: Figure 4. A model for the PIWI/piRNA pathway in germline cells and its disruption
  in testicular tumors. piRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are mainly transcribed
  as single-stranded intergenic RNAs from well-conserved mono- and bi-directional
  clusters of repetitive elements. These piRNA precursors translocate into the cytoplasm,
  where they mature into functional piRNAs. The PIWI proteins catalyze a self-amplification
  loop, “ping-pong” cycle. Their incorporation into the PIWI ribonucleoprotein (piRNP)
  complex targets repetitive elements through target degradation and epigenetic silencing.
  In testicular cancer types, piRNA biogenesis and function are disrupted by DNA hypermethylation
  mediated transcriptional silencing of PIWI-proteins, leading to the expression of
  germline transposons.
