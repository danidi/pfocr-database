caption: 'The STAT1 cycle: signaling pathway and recycling. Schematic diagram of STAT1
  activation and de-activation following IFN-γ stimulation. Following the binding
  of the cytokine to its receptor, a series of tyrosine phosphorylation events (red
  circles) occur: first the JAKs autophosphorylate and transphosphorylate each other;
  they then phosphorylate the intracellular part of the receptor, creating a docking
  site for STAT1. Recruited STAT1 are also phosphorylated by the JAKs, leading to
  their removal from the receptor, dimerization and translocation to the nucleus to
  modulate target gene expression. STAT1 dephosphorylation occurs in the nucleus and
  STATs are then exported back to the cytoplasm.'
