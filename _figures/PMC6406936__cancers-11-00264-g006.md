  expression induces a decrease in DLD-1 cell growth and viability by triggering necrosis
  and apoptosis through both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Cellular
  stress induces apoptosis intrinsic pathway and activates the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
  Pore formation is then promoted by BAX oligomers in the outer mitochondrial membrane
  and releases various proteins including cytochrome c. Procaspase-9 is recruited
  by the apoptosome through cytochrome c induction, inducing the dimerization and
  activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 activation triggers caspase cascade and finally
  induces executioner caspases-3. These caspases are responsible for cleavage of numerous
  cellular proteins, leading to apoptosis. In the extrinsic caspase-8 dependent pathway
  there are two different ways. The type I pathway, where caspase-8 directly cleaves
  and activates caspase-3 leading to cell death, and the type II pathway, wherecaspase-8
  activates BAX leading to mitochondrial pore formation and the activation of the
  caspase cascade culminating in caspase-3 activation.
