caption: Apicoplast proteins and pathways are colored according to gene deletion results
  (dispensable = green, essential = orange, and essential for apicoplast maintenance = red).
  Pyruvate kinase II (PyrKII) generates nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) products used
  for transcription, translation, and for several metabolic pathways including the
  synthesis of fatty acids (FA), isoprenoids (isopr) and iron-sulfur clusters (FeS).
  The dispensability of the triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) suggests that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GA3P) may be directly imported by oTPT/iTPT for use in the isoprenoid synthesis
  pathway (gray arrow). This result also indicates that malaria parasites do not rely
  on a two-enzyme reductive pathway involving TPI and a hypothetical GAPDH enzyme.
