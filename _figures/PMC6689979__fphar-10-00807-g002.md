caption: Subcellular compartmentalization of sphingolipid metabolism. The endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) is the subcellular site where the de novo ceramide (Cer) synthesis
  occurs (A). Here, the synthesis of the sphingoid bases (sphingosine) starts with
  the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine, catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase
  (SPT). The product of this reaction is 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (3-kdhSo), which
  is later reduced to dihydrosphingosine (dhSo) via the action of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine
  reductase (KDSR). Then, dhSo is acylated generating dihydroceramide (dhCer). In
  humans, this reaction occurs through the activities of six different ceramide synthases
  (CerS). Dihydroceramide is then unsaturated to ceramide by the enzyme dihydroceramide
  desaturase 1 (DES1). At ER level, Cer is either transformed into GalCer () by CGalT
  (B) or delivered by ceramide transport protein (CERT) (C) or through vesicular transport
  (D) to the Golgi apparatus for the synthesis of sphingomyelin (SM ) by SMS1 and
  glucosylceramide (GlcCer ) by GCS (E). At the Golgi, GlcCer is transformed into
  lactosylceramide (LacCer ) and complex GSLs (e.g., GM3 ) (F), which are then delivered
  to the plasma membrane via Golgi vesicular transport (G). At the plasma membrane
  level, SM can be converted into ceramide by sphingomyelinase (SMase), ceramide can
  then be transformed into sphingosine (Sph) by ceramidase (CDase), and sphingosine
  is converted into sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P ) by sphingosine kinases (SK1) (H).
  S1P is then transported across the membrane by specific transporters. Phosphorylation
  of sphingosine yielding to S1P because of the action of sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2)
  can occur at the mitochondria (I), nucleus (J), and ER (K). In the ER, S1P can be
  either irreversibly cleaved by S1P lyase or dephosphorylated back to sphingosine
  by a specific phosphatase (SPP1). Membrane sphingolipids are internalized via caveolae-dependent
  endocytosis and, in the lysosome, they are degraded by acidic forms of SMase and
  by different glycosidases (GCase) yielding ceramide that can be further hydrolyzed
  by the acid ceramidases (CDase) (L). The sphingosine formed in this reaction can
  escape the lysosome and can be metabolized to glycerophospholipids after phosphorylation
  by SK1 and cleavage by S1P lyase (SGPL) or it can be recycled for sphingolipid synthesis
  in the salvage pathway (M).
