caption: The EP4 receptor promotes endothelial barrier function. EP4 receptor activation
  induces rapid cortical actin polymerization and VE-cadherin expression in the endothelial
  junctions, which results in markedly increased electrical resistance of the cell
  monolayer. Furthermore, E-selectin upregulation, and leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial
  migration as induced by TNF-α treatment is prevented by EP4 receptor activation.
  EP4 receptor-mediated E-selectin down-regulation is PI3K/PKC-dependent; however,
  none of the generally used EP4 receptor signaling modules (cAMP, eNOS, Rac1, PI3K,
  p38, ERK1/2) are involved in the barrier-enhancing effect of EP4 receptor. In contrast,
  the cAMP/PKA/p38 MAP kinase pathway mediates the EP4 receptor-stimulated release
  of IL-8 in endothelial cells.
