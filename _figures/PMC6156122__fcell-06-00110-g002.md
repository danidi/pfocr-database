caption: Pathways to retinal regeneration. (A) Zebrafish are able to completely regenerate
  their retina via Müller glia. In the uninjured retina, Müller glia is kept quiescent
  by inhibiting the expression of the genes that control regeneration through Notch
  signaling and repression by the transcription factor Six3b and the microRNA let7,
  amongst others. During retinal injury, cell death and inflammation lead to the release
  of cytokines and growth factors (especially TNFα), which activate receptors and
  kinases in the Müller glia, leading to activation of β-catenin and phosphorylation
  of the transcription factor Stat3, which in turns leads to the production of the
  transcription factor ascl1 and lin28 microRNA, and the activation of the genes that
  control Müller glia division and dedifferentiation. lin28 also inhibits the production
  of let7, releasing the inhibition of this pathway. Expression of the transcription
  factor Pax6b (normally inhibited by the microRNA mi203), allows the amplification
  and production of retinal progenitors which are then able to redifferentiate into
  any retinal neurons or Müller glial cells. (B) In medaka fish, lack of production
  of Sox2 after the production of retinal progenitors restricts their fate to photoreceptors
  and does not allow the production of other cell types, including new Müller glia.
  (C) In mice and other mammals, retinal injury does not lead to expression of ascl1
  and the rest of regeneration-related genes. Instead Müller glia activate the production
  of intermediate filaments and increase their size (reactive gliosis) and do not
  lead to the production of new retinal cells or injury repair. (D) Retinal regeneration
  can be stimulated in mice by artificially overexpressing ascl1 and inhibiting epigenetic
  changes (histone deacetylation in particular). With this treatment, Müller glial
  cells are able to divide and produce retinal progenitors, but their fate is restricted
  to bipolar and amacrine cells.
