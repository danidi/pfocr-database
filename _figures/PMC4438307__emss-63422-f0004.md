caption: The PerR repressor is proposed to sense O2, O2− and H2O2 by oxidation of
  two His residues in the conserved regulatory Fe-binding site leading to 2-oxo-His
  generation. This causes PerR inactivation and derepression of the PerR regulon genes.
  The PerR regulon controls genes for an anaerobic oxygen and ROS detoxification pathway,
  including the oxygen-reducing flavodiiron proteins (fprA2), reverse rubrerythrins
  and peroxidases (rbr3A, rbr3B), peroxiredoxin (bcp), thiol peroxidase (tpx), glutathione
  peroxidase (bsa2), glutaredoxin (grx), superoxide-reducing desulfoferrodoxin (dfx),
  rubredoxin (rd) and the NADH-dependent rubredoxin oxidoreductase (nror). Examples
  for PerR regulon genes of C. acetobutylicum and their functions are also listed
  in .
