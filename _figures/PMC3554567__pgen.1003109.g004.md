caption: '1: Nodal signaling to the myocardium through the transcription factor FoxH1
  is required to asymmetrically increase cardiac migration rates specifically on the
  left of the cardiac cone. 2: The Bmp pathway is bilaterally activated in the endocardium
  but only effectively limits migration rates in the absence of strong inductive cues
  from Nodal signaling on the right of the cardiac cone. This leads to a non-cell
  autonomous decrease in myocardial migration rates on the right of the cone. 3: The
  Nodal pathway generally limits Bmp pathway activation in the heart, potentially
  through competition for access to proteins common to both pathways. 4: FoxH1 is
  also required in a Nodal-independent manner in the heart to mediate cardiac cell
  responsiveness to Bmp signals.'
