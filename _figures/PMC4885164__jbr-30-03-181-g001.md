caption: SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis activation in prostate cancer cells could be driven by
  oncogenic events (e.g., the loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt pathway),
  or by microenvironmental factors (e.g., hypoxia, fibrosis, inflammation). When CXCR4
  is inhibited, it could lead to inhibition of VEGF and MMP-9 expression, a delay
  in tumor growth and reduction in metastasis. SDF1α can induce CD164 expression in
  prostate cancer cells and there by increase their ability to adhere to human bone
  marrow endothelial cells. In bone metastases, CXCL16 (a ligand for CXCR6) can stimulate
  the differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) into cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs), which secrete high levels of SDF1α. SDF1α could also be locally
  produced by osteoblasts. SDF1α and CXCR4 overexpression could also be stimulated
  by TGF-β2, which is expressed by dormant disseminated prostate cancer cells in bone
  marrow. Finally, hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)-1a and HIF-2a may induce the expression
  of epithelial-to mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-associated molecules snail and twist.
  In turn, inhibition of SDF-1α could lead to downregulation of the expression of
  MMP-9, ZEB-1, CD133 and CXCR4 in bone metastatic prostate tumors. Figure courtesy
