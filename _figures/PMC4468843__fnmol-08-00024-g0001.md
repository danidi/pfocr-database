caption: Schematic diagram of the NF-κB pathway. Cells express membrane receptors
  such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), interleukin-1β receptors (IL-1R), tumor necrosis
  factor receptors (TNFR) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE).
  These receptors recognize pro-inflammatory stimuli such as pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and cytokines. Ligand
  bound PAMPs, DAMPs and cytokines activate downstream adapter proteins such as myeloid
  differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) and tumor necrosis factor associated
  factors (TRAF). MyD88 and TRAF activates specific protein kinases such as mitogen
  activated protein kinases (MAPK) such as IRAK, TAK1, NIK, and ERK 1/2. These kinases
  activate IκB kinases (IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ) that phosphorylate IkB-α. In stimulated
  cells, phosphorylation of IkB leads to its dissociation from the complex, and its
  proteasomal degradation, allowing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus, where it
  binds to specific DNA sequences present in the promoters of numerous target genes,
  encoding the pro inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α), chemokines
  (e.g., IL-8, MIP-1α, MCP1, RANTES, eotaxin), adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM, VCAM,
  E-selectin) as well as Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS).
