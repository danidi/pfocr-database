caption: Schematic representation of salt tolerance mechanism in halophyte Thellungiella.
  By combining the present knowledge of plant salt tolerance mechanisms and the observations
  from this research, a possible schematic representation of the mechanism associated
  with the extreme salt tolerance of Thellungiella was created. This schematic diagram
  was developed from a recently published model for S. europaea (). At the whole-plant
  level, NaCl resulted in the retardation of plant development and some changed shapes
  of cells and organelles such as chloroplasts. After salt accumulation, increased
  sodium and decreased potassium concentrations were observed. More starch grains
  and soluble sugars, as well as proline, accumulated abundantly in the cells, resulting
  in improved cell sap osmolarity in the salt-treated plants. Sodium was mainly compartmentalized
  in the vacuole. These salt responses led to the up-regulation of many salt-responsive
  proteins and genes in the leaf cells of salt-treated plants. The up- and down-regulated
  enzymes (marked with EC numbers) and genes are indicated in red and blue, respectively.
  The numbers presented in pink are enzymes with expression levels that were significant
  at only the protein level or the gene level. Of paramount importance were those
  mechanisms that function to regulate ion homeostasis through the SOS pathway, which
  controls sodium ion accumulation and the intracellular compartmentalization of sodium,
  based on our comparative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis. Consequently, many
  enzymes in the pathways involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, photosynthesis,
  carbon fixation, glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and proline metabolism were up-regulated
  obviously by high salinity at both gene and protein levels, which resulted in substantial
  improvement of the energy production system in both the chloroplast and the cytosol
  after salt accumulation. This systematic salt tolerance mechanism at both cellular
  and subcellular levels in Thellungiella also might be important for other plants
  exposed to high salinity.
