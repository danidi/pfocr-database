caption: Logical circuit of h_amiPathway. Logical circuits described the relationships
  between GO biological processes and the MI pathway. We used multiple input single
  output logical gates AND and OR, where the GOBP were the inputs and h_amiPathway
  were the outputs. The extracted network of MI identified five major GOBP terms,
  including tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT protein (ΔB79), coagulation (ΔB10), negative
  and positive regulation of blood coagulation (ΔB23 & ΔB30), and positive regulation
  of collagen metabolic process (ΔB32), required to activate the MI pathway. The labels
  next to the name of the GOBP terms corresponded to the legend in Figure 6.
