caption: A model for potential mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects of NFV.
  The scavenger molecule CD14 in membrane-associated or sCD14 form binds LPS and localizes
  to a TLR4 signaling complex. A phospho-protein cascade, including IL-1R-associated
  kinase (IRAK)1 and -4 and TRAF6, serves as a signaling hub that leads into multiple
  downstream pathways, including NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK. NF-κB pathway is initiated
  by TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-dependent phosphorylation of IKKα/β, which subsequently
  phosphorylates the inhibitory protein IκBα, triggering its ubiquitination and degradation.
  Degradation of IκBα releases p50/p65, which is phophorylated and translocated to
  the nucleus to initiate transcription of proinflammatory genes. PI3K/AKT signaling
  is triggered by receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIP) and culminates
  with inhibition of proinflammatory signaling/transcription and/or enhancement of
  anti-inflammatory gene expression. MAPK signaling is triggered by activation of
  proximal MAP3K proteins, followed by downstream activation of Mek1/2 and Erk1/2
  and induction of proinflammatory genes. NFV inhibits proteasome activity, leading
  to accumulation of misfolded proteins and activation of the UPR, including activation
  of PP1 and possibly PP2, which can be inhibited chemically with calyculin A (CA)
  and okadaic acid (OA), respectively.
