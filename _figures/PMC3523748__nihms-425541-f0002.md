caption: Illustrated is a typical mammalian macrophage that harbors innate immune
  receptors in specific subcellular locations. The subcellular sites indicated are
  the sites of receptor residence after microbe-induced receptor transport. The legend
  indicates the type of signaling pathway activated from each location. Note in most
  cases, the sites of receptor signaling differ from the sites of microbial detection,
  as illustrated in . At the plasma membrane rafts are bacterial sensing TLRs such
  as TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Within early endosomes is TLR4. The virus sensing TLRs
  3, 7, 8, 9 and 13 may signal from late endosomes and lysosomes-related organelles,
  although this has been only formally demonstrated for TLR9. The RLRs RIG-I and MDA5
  signal from mitochondria and peroxisomes that are docked at the MAM. Note, that
  some of the receptors indicated in  are not illustrated here, because not enough
  information is available to define their sites of signaling.
