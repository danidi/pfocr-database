caption: Proposed mechanism for MCME-mediated inhibition against migration of CL1
  cells. The effect of MCME is mediated by both Src/FAK and Wnt signaling pathways.
  MCME reduces the expression and activation of Src and FAK, leading to the decreased
  expression of Akt which regulates the phosphorylation of GSK-3β. MCME-induced inactivation
  of GSK-3β is also regulated by the increased Wnt-2 after treatment. Declined expressions
  of β-catenin and MMPs demonstrate that antimetastatic activity of MCME-treated CL1
  cells is mainly mediated through Src/FAK/Akt, but not Wnt-2/GSK-3β, pathway to inhibit
  β-catenin from entering the nucleus. In conclusion, Src, FAK, PI3K/Akt, and β-catenin
  are involved in the critical pathway to inhibit the metastasis through the downregulation
  of MMPs on MCME-treated CL1 cells.
