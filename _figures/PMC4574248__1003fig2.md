caption: Signal transduction pathways and the oxidative stress response. Exposure
  to ROS-generating compounds activates cell wall sensors (Mid2, Wsc1, Mtl1) connected
  to the cell wall integrity MAP kinase pathway. Activation of the MAP kinase (Slt2)
  and the pseudokinase (Kdx1) result in cyclin C and Ask10p phosphorylation, respectively.
  Phosphorylation of cyclin C initiates its relocation to the mitochondria. The role
  of Ask10 modification is currently unknown. Cyclin C relocalization also requires
  destruction of Med13, the anchor protein that tethers cyclin C to the RNA polymerase
  II holoenzyme. TORC signaling restricts ROS accumulation by regulating cyclin C
  levels through the CWI pathway and inhibiting the protein kinase A subunit Tpk3.
  When activated by Ras due to actin aggregation, Tpk3 causes accumulation of mitochondrial-dependent
  ROS that can result in more actin filament aggregation due to oxidation of conserved
  cysteine residues.
