caption: Panel A, MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathway is regulated by miR-146a.
  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN) activate immune cells through interaction
  with the TLR (TLR4, TLR 2/6) complex on the cell surface. This leads to the activation
  of the MyD88 dependent pathway, followed by the sequential recruitment of IRAK4,
  IRAK1, and TRAF6, and eventual activation of NF-κB. The active NF-κB is then exported
  to the nucleus where it activates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as TNF-α and IL-1β. This pathway is normally used to control the growth and
  dissemination of the infectious agent and to activate the immune response as needed.
  However, if this mechanism is altered, the result is the pathological dysregulation
  leading to disease, as in the case of sepsis, multiorgan failure, autoimmune disease,
  or cancer. When NF-κB is activated, it also leads to the transcription of pri-miR146a
  and eventual maturation to miR-146a, which targets and down-regulates IRAK1 and
  TRAF6 through translational repression and degradation of mRNA. In the presence
  of LPS, miR-146a can increase up to 100 fold greater compared to untreated control
  monocytes. This negative feedback mechanism is induced by the high level of miR-146a,
  and it suppresses the expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6. In this way, the cell is able
  to enter a state of tolerance against further stimulation by LPS or many other TLR
  ligands.Panel B is a schematic of the relative expression of TNF-α, IRAK1/TRAF6,
  and miR-146a in the LPS-induced tolerance using the THP-1 cell model [,], in which
  tolerized cells quickly produce TNF-α, which continues for about 4–6 hours. When
  TNF-α production decreases, miR-146a starts to increase. Eighteen hours post-priming,
  a large difference is observed between TNF-α and miR-146a, as miR-146a acts negatively
  on IRAK1 and TRAF6 and the cells become tolerized. Tolerized cells do not respond
  to even higher dose of LPS challenge, due to the high levels of miR-146a, while
  untolerized cells respond to the second LPS challenge with higher production of
  TNF-α.
