caption: Roles of palmitoylation during structural LTP. During LTP, more AMPARs are
  recruited to the postsynaptic membrane via exocytosis and anchored on an enlarged
  PSD and on Ankyrin-G, which more densely populate the submembrane region than in
  the basal state. Ankyrin-G molecules are targeted to perisynaptic sites of the spine
  head and spine neck to stabilize the spine structure through palmitoylation and
  binding to spectrin (1:1), which is a cytoskeletal protein that lines the intracellular
  side of the plasma membrane interacting with actin cytoskeletal protein. AMPAR,
  4.1 N, spectrin, actin and associated molecules form a membrane-associated periodic
  skeleton (MPS) structure observed in spines, but the extent to which it exists and
  how it develops in dendrites remain unclear [, ]. Palmitoylation targets Rac1, Cdc42,
  Ras and LIMK1 to spine membrane where Rac1 and Cdc42 activate PAK. Next, phosphorylated
  LIMK1 by activated PAK phosphorylates Cofilin and inhibits its depolymerizing activity.
  Palmitoylated Ras seems to participate in spine morphological modification through
  downstream MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In addition, through downstream WAVE and WASP,
  Rac1 and Cdc42 also regulate Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, which can be
  inhibited by PICK1. Palmitoylation also seems to facilitate assembly of the complex
  containing AMPAR, ABP-L, N-cadherin and δ-catenin on the postsynaptic membrane,
  linking AMPAR trafficking to the actin cytoskeleton network through Rho signaling.
  Regulation of functional and structural plasticity is a highly sophisticated process
  which needs precise timing of coordinated work of plenty of factors. Interplay between
  the processes described above and other, unknown factors, may lead to enhanced synaptic
  transmission and enlarged spines. The sketch was prepared based on the data collected
  in this review. One squiggle denotes one or more palmitoyl chains attached to the
  target protein; Spectrin line icon denotes several spectrin molecules
