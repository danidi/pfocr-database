caption: Iron and sphingolipids interplay in response to inflammation and hypoxia.
  A correct adaptation to hypoxia results in the inhibition of the regulator peptide
  hepcidin (line 1). Hepcidin main action is the reduction of the outflow of the intracellular
  ferrous iron (Fe2+), which is mediated by ferroportin (Fpn). Therefore, if Fpn is
  less inhibited, iron can be released in the blood stream, bound to the trasporter
  fransferrin (Tf) in its ferric form (Fe3+), and then reach the bone marrow, to contribute
  to the hematopoietic response. On the other hand, inflammation induces an increase
  in hepcidin, which blocks such adaptation. Both inflammation and hypoxia are sources
  of oxidative stress (lines 2a and 2b). An excess of intracellular iron can be a
  further source of oxidative stress, through the Fenton reaction (showed at the bottom).
  Both inflammation and hypoxia increase the production of Ceramide (Cer, lines 3a
  and 3b) derived by a de novo biosynthetic pathway, mediated by serin palmitoyl transferase
  (SPT) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin
  (SM), mediated by neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase). Cer accumulation promotes hepcidin
  expression (line 4) with a consequent increase in intracellular iron content, which,
  in turn, triggers Cer production (via activation of SM hydrolysis) in a vicious
  loop. Furthermore, ceramidase (CDase) converts Cer in sphingosine (Sph), which is
  phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) to produce sphingosine 1 phosphate
  (S1P). S1P acts as an oxygen-independent regulator of HIFs.
