caption: Simplified diagram of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism. Most
  cell types can initiate the kynurenine pathway via either TDO or IDO to produce
  kynurenine (initial segment of tryptophan metabolism). Hepatocytes have the full
  complement of enzymes to either produce NAD+ or fully oxidize tryptophan to CO2.
  Numerous cell types, including many of the immune system, express the enzymes through
  the NAD+ synthetic branch. However, in order for Quin to build up in some immune
  cells during an immune response, the activities of the enzymes aminocarboxymuconate
  semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT)
  must be restricted to slow further metabolism to either NAD+ or oxidation to CO2.
  The fate of stockpiled Quin in those immune cells remains uncertain, but it is likely
  that both NAD+synthesis and oxidation to yield energy are employed by various cells
  of the immune system during an immune response. Also, these cells may be releasing
  upstream metabolites. As such, upregulation of QPRT activity (red arrow) would be
  the rate-limiting factor for further metabolism to NAD+ when needed, and we propose
  this branch is predominantly utilized in cells of the immune system following IDO
  activation. In contrast, the activity of ACMSD would control the oxidative branch
  throughput for energy derivation. The three primary functions of IDO activation
  are (1) the extra-hepatic production of kynurenine, which is released for uptake
  by cells of the immune system thus diverting tryptophan metabolism to the immune
  system, (2) the production of NAD+ in cells of the immune system for the PARP reaction
  to DNA damage and other critical functions in immune cells, and (3) the production
  and release of immune modulating metabolites to regulate the immune response, especially
  T cell responsiveness. NMNAT, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; NADSYN1,
  NAD synthetase 1.
