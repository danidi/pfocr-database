caption: 'Induction of type I IFNs in response to viral infections. After virus entry
  through cell membrane using receptors or membrane fusion strategies, the infected
  cell detects the presence of virus replication by PRRs. There are two IFN-inducing
  systems in response to viral PRRs: one system is ubiquitously expressed and localized
  in the cytoplasm (OAS, MDA-5, RIG-I, cGAS, and PKR), wherein viral nucleic acids
  produced upon infection are detected, the other one is restricted to endosomes of
  specialized sentinel cells and mediated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (TLR3,7,8,9)
  (). In the cytosol, viral double-stranded (ds) RNA is recognized by melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA-5), 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and protein kinase R (PKR)
  whereas retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is specialized in single-stranded
  (ss) RNA detection. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) acts as a double-stranded DNA
  sensor (). In the endosomes, TLRs are transmembrane proteins that detect double-stranded
  RNA (dsRNA; TLR3), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA; TLR7 and TLR8), and double-stranded
  DNA (dsDNA; TLR9). Additionally, TLR4 is located on the cell surface, to detects
  viral glycoproteins (). Activation of RIG-I and MAD-5 leads to activation of mitochondrial
  antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) in the mitochondrion and the consequent signaling
  through TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs) such as TRAF3 and TRAF6 (). Detection
  of viral material by OAS leads to the synthesis of 2’-5’-oligoadenylates, which
  then act as intracellular second messengers to activate latent endoribonuclease
  (RNase L) reinforcing the innate response through indiscriminate cleavage of host
  and viral RNA and producing additional PAMPS (). In response to the activation of
  the cGAS nucleotidyltransferase activity, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is produced, which
  in turn binds to and activates the stimulator of IFN genes (STING) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum, inducing the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activation (). PKR activation
  leads to a dramatic reduction of host and viral translation and degradation of κB
  inhibitor (IκB), resulting in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway ().
  Upon TLR viral recognition, activation of adapters, myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)
  occurs, leading to the activation of TRAF6 and TRAF3 (). Immediately upstream of
  the IRFs, IκB kinase‑ϵ (IKKϵ) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) are responsible for
  the phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7 (). Once activated IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB are
  translocated to the nucleus where they bind to specific binding sites, turning on
  the transcription of type I and III IFN genes and proinflammatory cytokines ().'
