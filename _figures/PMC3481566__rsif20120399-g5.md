caption: Potential HA signalling pathway mediated by CD44 and TGF-β1 receptors. Microarray
  and PCR analysis showed that several TGF-β1 intermediates, including the transcription
  factors c-Myc and E2F4, are upregulated following HA treatment. HA-induced signalling
  may be mediated by HA binding to CD44, which is known to bind to and activate the
  TGF-β1 receptor. (Online version in colour.)
