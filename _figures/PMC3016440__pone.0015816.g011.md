caption: Membrane esterified DHA is excised by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to yield free
  DHA; in turn free DHA is 15-lipoxygenated to generate NPD1 which then enters a neuroprotective
  cycle. These events are mediated, in part, by inhibiting apoptosis, by blocking
  inflammatory signaling, by promoting cell survival and by shifting βAPP processing
  from an amyloidogenic into a neurotrophic, non-amyloidogenic pathway. BACE1 activity
  is suppressed and α-secretase (ADAM10) activity is stimulated, thus down-regulating
  Aβ42 peptide release from membranes. Augmentation of BACE1 and ADAM10 by NPD1 may
  be mediated via other neuromolecular factors. We note that the ADAM10 cleavage product
  sAPPα further induces the conversion of free DHA into NPD1, thus constituting a
  positive, neurotrophic feedback loop.
