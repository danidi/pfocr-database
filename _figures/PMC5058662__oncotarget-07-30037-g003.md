caption: Based on the gene set enrichment result of up-regulated genes during aging,
  we analyzed the integrated expression of genes and pathways. We found that the Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) family and TLR signaling-related genes were up-regulated during
  aging. Up-regulation of NF-κB and FOS/JUN through TLR2 (2.3-fold) and TLR4 (2.1-fold)
  was observed for up-regulation of inflammation-related genes that function in the
  pro-inflammation effect (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα) and chemotactic genes (CCL3
  and CD5), as well as T-cell stimulation related genes (CD40, CD80, CD86, CXCL9,
  CXCL10, and CXCL11). These data support that pro-inflammatory genes, cytokines,
  and chemokines were overexpressed through the TLR signaling pathway, leading to
  chronic inflammation in aged rats. We describe the expression concentration of genes
  related to TLR signaling pathway in  and .
