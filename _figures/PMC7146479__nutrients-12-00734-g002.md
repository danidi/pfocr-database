caption: Schematic illustration of the heat stress (HS)-induced heat shock response
  and oxidative stress response. (a) Cells under HS conditions activate the heat shock
  response pathway, which is initiated by translocation and trimerization of heat
  shock factor-1 (HSF1) into the nucleus, where it binds to the regulatory heat shock
  elements (HSE) in the promoter regions of heat shock protein (HSP) genes. (b) Oxidative
  stress induced by HS results in the liberation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related
  factor 2 (Nrf2) from Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and the translocation
  of Nrf2 into the nucleus where it binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE)
  in the promotor region of antioxidant target genes, driving their expression.
