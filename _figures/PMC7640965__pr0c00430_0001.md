caption: 'SARS-CoV-2 infection and proliferation process mediated by host and viral
  proteases. Diagram of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and the various host viral proteases
  known to activate some coronavirus S proteins. Coronaviruses and a variety of viruses
  bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) nonspecifically to initiate virus
  infection. With membrane proteases like TMPRSS2&4 and possibly furin, viral fusion
  could occur directly at the plasma membrane with high efficiency. pH-Dependent/cathepsin-mediated
  viral entry is also bypassed by endocytosis, which may only serve as an auxiliary
  entry pathway in TMPRSS+ cells. Extracellular proteases such as typsin, elastin,
  and factor Xa protease may also participate in the activation of the virus. Viral
  proteases Mpro and PLpro mediate the maturation of viral proteins (S, M, E, N) in
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), trans-Golgi network (TGN), and cytosol, which later
  package into virus particles. Furin, and possibly TMPRSS protease, could cleave
  the S protein in the ER and TGN system and the mature virion before it is released.
  We propose that there may be three models of SARS-CoV-2 particles: unactivated virion
  (uncleaved, green), semiactivated virion (S1/S2 cleaved, yellow), and fully activated
  virion (S1/S2 and S1 cleaved, red). ACE2+/furin+ and TMPRSS+ cells could serve as
  a factory of semiactive virion (yellow) and full-active virion (red) for the in
  trans infection of neighboring ACE2+ cells with or without membrane proteases. Notably,
  furin and cathepsin may be also released as soluble proteases and activate the virus
  extracellularly.'
