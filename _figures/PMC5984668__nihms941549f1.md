caption: The article by Ding and colleagues in the current issue shows that constitutive
  hyperexpression of STAT3 in mouse CD4+ T cells is sufficient to promote psoriasis-like
  skin disease, psoriasis-like arthritis and enthesopathy. Taken together with other
  data, the results suggest a model in which constitutive expression of STAT3, with
  or without IL-6 signaling, promotes an inflammatory environment including IL-1,
  TGFβ and IL-23 that promotes development and differentiation of Th17 cells (upper
  pathway). The same conditions in the presence of TNFα and IL-23 lead to the sustained
  development of Th22 T cells (lower pathway). Th17 cells express characteristic transcription
  factors, STAT3 and RORᵧt; chemokine receptors, CCR4 and CCR6; and cytokines IL-17a,
  IL-17f, IL-22 and IL-21. Collectively, these promote development of a psoriasis-like
  arthritis and individuals with higher STAT3 transcriptional activity are more susceptible
  to joint disease (upper pathway). Th22 cells express canonical transcription factors,
  STAT3, NF-kB and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); chemokine receptors, CCR4, CCR6
  and CCR10; and cytokines, IL-22, TNF, IL-13 and IL-26. Collectively, these promote
  development of skin psoriasis and individuals with high STAT3 transcriptional activity
  are more likely to develop skin disease (lower pathway).
