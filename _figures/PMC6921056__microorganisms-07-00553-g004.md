caption: Proposed model scheme. A schematic description of the novel ODE model with
  highlighted extending partitions. Each partition (i.e., module) represents a linearly
  independent part of a particular equation. Each module has a unique semantic function.
  Note that some of the modules are used in more than one equation. The coloured modules
  represent entirely new parts of the final model and the grey modules were extended
  in this study. This modular feature was necessary to handle the fitting of such
  a complex model to the experimental data.
