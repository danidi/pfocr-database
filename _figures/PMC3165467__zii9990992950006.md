caption: Results of Ingenuity pathway analysis. The highest-scoring networks for all
  differentially represented proteins (A) and for proteins overrepresented (B) and
  underrepresented (C) in infected sheep are illustrated. (A and B) Results for the
  highest-scoring network, i.e., cellular movement, hematological system development
  and function, and immune cell trafficking, are illustrated. (C) Results for the
  highest-scoring network, i.e., lipid metabolism, molecular transport, and small-molecule
  biochemistry, are illustrated. Red, overrepresented proteins; green, underrepresented
  proteins; white, proteins indicated by IPA as significantly associated with the
  reported network; continuous line, direct relationship; dotted line, indirect relationship.
  Color intensity represents the extent of differential protein abundance.
