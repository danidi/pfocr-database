caption: The glycine cleavage system and recycling of tetrhydrofolate (THF) and N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  (MTHF). When the glycine cleavage system genes are overexpressed the cell breaks
  down glycine to produce NADH (also generating MTHF). The MTHF can be recycled back
  to THF in the conversion of glycine to serine. Additionally, alternative pathways
  that generate NADPH (along with consuming ATP) can also help restore THF. Arrows
  connecting THF and MTHF represent multiple enzymatic steps in a metabolic pathway.
