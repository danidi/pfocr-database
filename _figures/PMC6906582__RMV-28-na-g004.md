caption: Viral RNA sensing proteins and their downstream signaling. Viral RNA activates
  the protein product of the OAS3 gene, which in turn activates RNase L that cleaves
  cytosolic viral RNA. RNA digestion products activate protein kinase PKR and the
  2 helicases RIG1 and MDA5. After activation, PKR undergoes autophosphorylation and
  phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α. The phosphorylation of the
  initiation factor leads to translational arrests of both cellular and viral mRNAs,
  and these arrests promote apoptosis. Protein kinase R, RIG1, and MDA5 also participate
  in a signal transduction pathway that triggers IFN‐beta transcription and limits
  viral spread. Protein kinase R, RIG1, and MDA5 form complexes with adaptor proteins
  that trigger phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factors 3 and/or 7 (IRF3 and/or
  IRF7). After phosphorylation, IRF3 and IRF7 relocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,
  where they trigger type 1 IFN transcription. Malfunction of OAS3, RNase L, PKR,
  RIG‐I, MDA5, IRF3, or IRF7 disrupts downstream IFN induction pathways, making cancer
  cells vulnerable to oncolytic virus infection
