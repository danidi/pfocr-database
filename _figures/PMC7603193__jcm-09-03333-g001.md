caption: 'Interactions between non-coding RNAs and the TGFβ signaling pathway in hereditary
  hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). As shown in this schematic diagram, dysregulated
  microRNAs (miRs) (in red) identified in HHT patients directly target a number of
  TGFβ signaling molecules, including SMADs and TGFβRs, and dysregulated lncRNAs (in
  red) found in HHT patients have a purported role in regulating vasculogenesis and
  vessel morphogenesis and development. SMAD2/3 can alternatively incorporate with
  the microprocessor complex to regulate the processing of pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA.
  Aberrant TGFβ signaling has been found to result in the altered expression of various
  miRs (in blue) that are involved in angiogenesis. The interaction between non-coding
  RNAs and TGFβ signaling establishes a narrative for their involvement in HHT pathogenesis.
