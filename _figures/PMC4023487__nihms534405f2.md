caption: Proposed Correa pathway of pathological events and dietary influence on in
  gastric cancer progression. In well-differentiated, intestinal-type gastric cancer,
  histopathological studies indicated that chronic H. pylori infection progresses
  over decades through stages of chronic gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia,
  dysplasia, and cancer (Correa, 1991). The development of cancer has been attributed
  to alterations in DNA caused by chronic inflammation, recruitment and engraftment
  of bone marrow–derived cells, an imbalance between epithelial cell proliferation
  and apoptosis, and, in a milieu of atrophy and achlorhydria, gastric colonization
  by enteric bacteria with nitrate reductase activity, which facilitates the formation
  of carcinogenic nitrosamines. Corpus-predominant atrophy, or the loss of specialized
  glandular cell types such as parietal and chief cells, appears to be the critical
  initiating step in the progression toward cancer. (Modified from ())
