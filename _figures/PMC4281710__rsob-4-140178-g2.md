caption: NOD2-interaction partners influence a wide range of NOD2 functions. A schematic
  of the reported interactions between NOD2 and other cellular proteins. For the sake
  of simplicity, only a selection of proteins are displayed in direct contact with
  NOD2. Key NOD2 functional outputs are shown in black boxes. Protein partners influencing
  these functions directly are listed in the relevant location. Protein impacts on
  NOD2 are highlighted with coloured arrows. Proteins which exert their influence
  and interact with NOD2 at a predominantly membrane location are labelled in gold.
  Where the precise role of a protein partner is uncertain this is represented by
  a question mark, and the protein has been located in the most likely region of influence.
