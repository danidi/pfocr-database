caption: Proposed model for the role of fibrin/ogen in the muscle dystrophy-associated
  fibrosis. Fibrinogen promotes collagen production by three distinct but possibly
  overlapping mechanisms in mdx muscle. (1) TGFβ is produced in response to fibrinogen
  stimulation of proinflammatory, classically activated mdx macrophages (through Mac-1
  binding) and via the intermediate induction of IL-1β (a direct fibrinogen-inducible
  gene), as an anti-inflammatory counteracting mechanism involving a macrophage activation
  switch. Macrophage-secreted TGFβ is free to bind and activate TGFβ receptors expressed
  by fibroblasts from mdx diaphragms, and directly induce collagen synthesis. (2)
  TGFβ can also promote the alternative activation of macrophages initiated by IL-13
  Th2 cytokine. By up-regulating arginase activity in these cells, TGFβ (in conjuntion
  with IL-13) is known to promote fibroblast proliferation, collagen production, and
  ultimately, fibrosis. (3) Fibrin/ogen might also directly activate the collagen-producing
  machinery in fibroblasts by binding to αvβ3 receptors.
