caption: 'Schematic of Signaling Model from CAR Antigen Binding Through ERK Activation,
  Incorporating Models from literatureArrows and bars indicate activating and inhibitory
  interactions, respectively. Dashed lines denote the same species in multiple Modules.Module
  I: LCK regulation, autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation of the CAR intracellular
  signaling domains and ZAP-70.Module II: CD45 and SHP1 phosphatase activity. CD45
  is constitutively active in resting T cells, but it is excluded from the signaling
  area upon CAR binding to its ligand. SHP1 is recruited to the area by singly phosphorylated
  CD3ζ ITAMs and is activated by LCK.Module III: the LAT signalosome forms when ZAP-70
  binds to doubly phosphorylated ITAMs and becomes phosphorylated by LCK. It can then
  phosphorylate sites on LAT and SLP76. Phosphorylated sites on LAT can bind proteins
  Grb2, GADS, and PLCγ. Grb2 can bind to SOS, whereas GADS binds to SLP76. SLP76 recruits
  Tec family kinases, such as ITK, which can then phosphorylate and activate PLCγ.Module
  IV: PLCγ and SOS can activate Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP. Ras-GTP can be inactivated by
  RasGAP. Once activated, RAS-GTP can activate the MAPK pathway, which leads to ERK
  activation. Doubly phosphorylated ERK can phosphorylate LCK at a protection site,
  which prevents LCK from associating with SHP1, resulting in a positive feedback
  loop.'
