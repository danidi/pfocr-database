caption: Targeting CDK7 for treating Yap/Taz-driven cancer. (A) A conserved role of
  CDK7/CRL4DCAF12 in the regulation of nuclear Yki/Yap/Taz. CDK7 phosphorylates Yki/Yap/Taz
  to prevent its binding to CRL4DCAF12, thereby stabilizing Yki/Yap/Taz in the nucleus.
  (B, top) Yap/Taz/TEAD binds superenhancers together with other transcriptional factors
  (X, Y, etc.) to drive the expression of genes essential for tumor growth. (Bottom)
  CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 blocks tumor growth by inhibiting both Yap/Taz and Pol II in
  Yap/Taz-driven cancer.
