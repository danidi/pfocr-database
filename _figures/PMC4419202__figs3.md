caption: Most enriched pathways after Foxa1 knockout in female bladders. Ingenuity
  pathway analysis of female bladder microarray results identified cellular growth
  and proliferation, tissue development, and inflammatory response as the top disease
  network associated with Foxa1 knockout. In addition, this approach identified dermatological
  diseases (Dsg, Krt10, Krt14, and Krt6A) as a top enriched disease network in female
  Foxa1 knockout mice.
