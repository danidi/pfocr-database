caption: 'Reduced oxygen levels trigger an oxidative stress response and shift in
  glucose metabolism, resulting in upregulation of glycolysis and mannose synthesis,
  and downregulation of the hexosamine pathway and acetyl-CoA formation. This metabolic
  shift results in reduced GlcNAc levels, as well as levels of metabolites formed
  from GlcNAc including UDP-GlcNAc and CMP-NANA, triggering a reduction in terminal
  sialylation of N-glycans. Metabolite or gene expression levels directly measures
  as increased (green arrows) or decreased (red arrows) are shown. Abbreviations are
  as follows: CMP, cytidine monophosphate; CMP-SAT, CMP sialic acid transporter; CoA,
  coenzyme A; CTP, cytidine triphosphate; Frc-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; Glc-6-P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; GlcN, glucosamine; GlcNAc, N-acetyl glucosamine; Gln, glutamine;
  Glu, glutamate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; Man, mannose; Man-6-P, mannose-6-phosphate;
  ManNAc, N-acetyl mannosamine; MK, mannosekinase; NANA, N-acetylneuraminic acid;
  NH3, ammonia; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; PFK,
  phosphofructokinase; PMI, mannose phosphate isomerase; UDP, uridine diphosphate;
  UMP, uridine monophosphate; UTP, uridine triphosphate.'
