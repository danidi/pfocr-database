caption: 'ApoA-I is hypothesized to act on five major pathways to exert its neuroprotective
  effects pertinent to AD. (1) Cholesterol efflux pathway: ApoA-I in the brain promotes
  the cellular cholesterol efflux through ABCA1 and forms HDL-like particles. These
  particles are cleared by interacting with receptors such as SR-B1 by cells in the
  brain or through the BBB to peripheral circulation. (2) APP trafficking and processing
  pathway: ApoA-I-mediated increase in membrane fluidity may enhance α-secretase cleavage
  of APP at the cell membrane. Also, apoA-I binds to the extracellular domain of APP,
  which may prevent APP from undergoing the endocytic process, thereby inhibiting
  the access of β- and γ-secretases to APP and reducing the generation of Aβ. (3)
  Aβ clearance pathway: ApoA-I binds to Aβ and inhibits Aβ aggregation. ApoA-I/HDL
  in the brain can mediate the clearance of Aβ by local cells (e.g., astrocytes and
  microglia) through the scavenger receptor (e.g., SR-B1) and/or by crossing the BBB
  to the systemic circulation. (4) Anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation: ApoA-I/HDL
  possesses anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that are neuroprotective.
  (5) Signal transduction and synaptic plasticity: ApoA-I/HDL activates several kinases
  and increases the level of cAMP directly or indirectly through ABCA1 or SR-B1. These
  molecules play important roles in signaling pathways pertinent to synaptic function
  and memory formation. ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporter; ApoA-I, apolipoprotein
  A-I; Aβ, amyloid-β protein; APP, amyloid-β precursor protein; BBB, blood-brain barrier;
  cAMP, cyclic AMP; CE, cholesterol esters; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase;
  FC, unesterified free cholesterol; HDL, high-density lipoproteins; LCAT, lecithin
  cholesterol acyltransferase; PL, phospholipids; NO, nitric oxide; sAPPα, soluble
  N-terminal fragment of APP produced by α-secretase cleavage; 24S-HO-Chol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol;
  SR-B1, scavenger receptor B1.'
