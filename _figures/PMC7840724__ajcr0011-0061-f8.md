caption: Schematic model for radiation induced opposite invasion and migration potential
  in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells. Radiation increases the phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473
  and the expression of ANXA2 overtime in DLD-1 cells, and inactivates GSK3β by up-regulating
  its phosphorylation at Ser9. The inactive form of GSK3β can’t initiate the ubiquitylation
  of snail, resulting in the accumulation of snail, which promotes EMT process and
  stimulates the cellular migration and invasion. In HCT116 cells, radiation decreases
  the phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 and does not change the expression level of
  ANXA2, but increases the activation of GSK3β by up-regulating its phosphorylation
  at Tyr216. The active form of GSK3β promotes the ubiquitylation of snail, results
  in the increase of E-cadherin expression and finally impairs the cellular migration
  and invasion.
