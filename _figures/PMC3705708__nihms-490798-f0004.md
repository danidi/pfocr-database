caption: 'In vertebrates, Hh binding to Ptc modulates one or more of the following
  signaling modules: non-canonical type I Hh signaling exclusively through Ptc; canonical
  Hh signaling through Ptc, Smo, and Glis (mediated in some instances by Gi proteins);
  and a noncanonical type II signaling through Smo and Gi proteins. The cellular responses
  to each signaling module are illustrated at the bottom. The red crosses indicate
  inhibition of the pathway in the presence of Hh proteins.'
