caption: Nitric oxide (NO) signaling in normal and injured livers. NO synthesis is
  triggered via a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI-3-K) and
  the serine-threonine kinase, Akt. Akt phosphorylation, stimulated by factors such
  as shear stress and growth factors, leads to endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation
  and NO production. G protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) interacts with, and influences
  Akt phosphorylation, and thus regulates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation
  and activity. In the injured liver, GRK2 expression is upregulated and dampens Akt
  signaling, in turn reducing eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. eNOS is subject
  to other post-translational effects in the injured liver. Reproduced from Nature
  Medicine 11(9):952–8; Figure 6.
