caption: Diagram of the AHK2- and AHK3-mediated cold-responsive transcriptional network
  in Arabidopsis. Solid arrows indicate activation, and lines ending with bars represent
  negative regulation. Double asterisks indicate unknown cis-elements. CRT/DRE, C-repeat/dehydration-responsive
  element; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ICE1 box, ICE1 binding site; MYB15, myeloblastosis15;
  MYBBS, MYB-binding site; NM, nuclear membrane; PM, plasma membrane. The CBF pathway
  was redrawn from .
