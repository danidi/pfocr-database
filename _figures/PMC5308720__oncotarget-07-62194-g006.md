caption: The α5β1 integrin overexpression or activation induces the activation of
  AKT. We have shown recently that AKT modulates the PEA-15 anti-apoptotic protein
  to impair the p53-induced pro-apoptotic pathway []. According to the present work,
  we now have shown that activation of α5β1 integrin by fibronectin also led to AKT
  activation followed by transactivation of beta-catenin, induction of an EMT-like
  program and an increase in cell migration.
