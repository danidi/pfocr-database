caption: (A) Model illustrating the cross-talk of the hypoxia-response, DELTA/NOTCH,
  and RAS/MAPK pathways at normoxia. At the onset of VI, before a distinction between
  1° and 2° VPCs is made, lateral DELTA/NOTCH signaling between the proximal VPCs
  induces EGL-9 expression to maintain low HIF-1 and NHR-57 levels, thereby keeping
  the VPCs competent to respond to RAS/MAPK signaling. RAS/MAPK signaling, in turn,
  promotes the expression of the DELTA family NOTCH ligands. Distal VPCs lose their
  competence because of higher NHR-57 levels and adopt the 3° fate. Thereafter, NOTCH
  signaling directly induces the 2° fate and inhibits RAS/MAPK signaling in P5.p and
  P7.p. (B) Under hypoxia, the inhibition of HIF-1 and NHR-57 by EGL-9 is reduced
  because of the lack of oxygen and vulval fate acquisition is compromised. An as-of-yet
  unidentified factor activates NHR-57 during hypoxia independently of HIF-1.
