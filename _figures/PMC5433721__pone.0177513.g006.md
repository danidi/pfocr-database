caption: The relationship between the 3 pathways are shown and genes/metabolites involved
  in each pathway are indicated either by their original names or by numeric and alphabetic
  proxies. Genes and metabolites that are significantly upregulated in MR IWAT compared
  to Control are shown in pink. The full names of all genes/metabolites, their fold-changes
  and estimates of statistical significance are detailed in .
