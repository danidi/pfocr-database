caption: Crosstalk between adipose tissue clock and important signaling targets. Considerable
  evidence has been shown to support the hypothesis that oxidative stress and circadian
  rhythm are interrelated. Identification of important CGGs and pathway involved in
  adipose tissue function is important to improve the understanding of clock involvement
  in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases. The intact circadian oscillations
  of these targets are important in maintaining the balance between oxidative status
  and energy metabolism in the adipose tissue. mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
