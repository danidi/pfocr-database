caption: 'Synthetic lethality concept []. A DNA damage can lead to a single-strand
  break (SSB), and PARP enzymes play an essential role in SSB repair. The administration
  of PARPi will inhibit base-excision repair for SSB. If SSB are not repaired, continuous
  damage can progress to double-strand breaks (DSB). DSBs are usually repaired through
  the BRCA dependent homologous-recombination process. However, in cells with BRCAm
  the homologous-recombination pathway for DSB repair is damaged and leads to cell
  death. BRCAm: BRCA mutation, BRCAwt: BRCA wildtype, Non-HRD: No homologous recombination
  deficiency, SSB: single strand break, DSB: double strand break.'
