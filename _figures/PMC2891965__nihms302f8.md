caption: 'Updates in the characterization of the COX-2 pathways in human neutrophils.
  In response to a stimulus, membrane-esterified arachidonic acid (AA) is mobilized
  by type IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. AA can
  be utilized either by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) or by the inducible cyclooxygenase isoform
  (COX-2). 5-LO pathway: 5-LO, a Ca2+-dependent enzyme, catalyzes two reactions: transformation
  of AA into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetranoic acid (5-HPETE), and dehydration of the latter
  in leukotriene (LT)A4. LTA4 is metabolized in the active metabolite LTB4 by the
  LTA4 hydrolase. Neutrophils also express an omega carboxylase which sequentially
  transforms LTB4 into less active metabolites: 20-OH- and 20-COOH-LTB4. COX-2 pathway:
  COX-2, which can be up-regulated in neutrophils, also catalyses two reactions by
  which AA is transformed into prostaglandin (PG)H2. PGH2 can then be metabolized
  into the active metabolite PGE2 by the microsomal PGE2 synthase (mPGES)-1, or into
  TXA2 by TXA2 synthase (TXA2S), both of which being constitutively-expressed in neutrophils.
  Thus, COX-2 expression is held to be the main limiting factor for the biosynthesis
  of prostanoids in these cells. Available information indicates that LTB4, PGE2 and
  TXA2 are the main eicosanoids produced by human neutrophils, in vitro.'
