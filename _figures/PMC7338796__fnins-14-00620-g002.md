caption: Crosstalk between the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and kynurenine (KYN) pathways.
  It is highlighted in red the activation of the two metabolic pathways under inflammation.
  It is highlighted in green the KYN intermediate xanthurenic acid (XA), which recently
  was demonstrated to be an inhibitor of sepiapterina reductase (SPR) (). The formation
  of BH4 (highlighted in orange) by the de novo pathway involves the catalytic activity
  of GTPCH (guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I), PTPS (followed by 6-pyruvoyl
  tetrahydropterin synthase) and SPR (sepiapterin reductase). SPR deficiencies may
  be overcome in target tissues by unspecific reductases of the salvage pathway, including
  aldoketo and carbonyl reductases (AKR; CR) (; ), which transform 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin
  into sepiapterin and BH2 (7,8-dihydrobiopterin), then the final reduction back to
  BH4 is performed by DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase). The recycling pathway maintains
  high levels of BH4 in the liver, where it is mainly used to metabolize phenylalanine.
  After BH4 oxidation, PCD (Pterin 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase) forms qBH2 (quinonoid
  dihydrobiopterin) to be reduced back to BH4 by DHPR (dihydropteridine reductase).
  The KYN pathway transforms tryptophan into a series of intermediates with different
  properties by combining the activity of several enzymes in different cells/tissues.
  The central intermediate KYN allows the production of XA, which inhibits SPR activity
  in the BH4 pathway. GTP, guanosine triphosphate; IDO1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase;
