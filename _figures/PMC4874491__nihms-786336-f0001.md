caption: The “immune barrier hypothesis” posits that the chronic inflammation associated
  with CRS is linked to a defective mechanical and innate immune barrier. This deficit
  leads to a compensatory innate effector cell recruitment and activation, coupled
  with a robust adaptive immune response. The nature of this compensatory response
  likely varies among CRS phenotypes. Describes the proposed pathway for a typical
  case of Caucasian nasal polyposis. Reduced host defense molecules (1) lead to an
  abnormal microbiome (2), likely in biofilm format. Impaired mucociliary flow and
  a porous mechanical barrier lead to increased access of PAMPS stimulating a compensatory
  response (3). In Caucasian polypoid CRS, the cytokines BAFF and TSLP have been implicated
  in the observed innate and adaptive response. TSLP acts on type 2 innate lymphocytes
  (ILC2s) to release the type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13. TSLP also acts on dendritic
  cells, fostering Th2 lymphocyte differentiation with an amplified type 2 cytokine
  response. Superantigens, if present, will accentuate the T cell response expressed
  in the tissue; in this case, the response is skewed to Th2. BAFF drives a strong
  local B cell immunoglobulin response, including autoreactive antibodies in severe
  cases (4). Collectively, this results in the recruitment and activation of innate
  effector cells that possess Fc receptors for the locally produced immunoglobulins.
  In the presence of large amounts of antigen that penetrate the weakened barrier,
  this should lead to widespread effector cell degranulation and tissue damage
