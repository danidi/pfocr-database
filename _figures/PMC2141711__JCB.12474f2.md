caption: Oncogenes and signaling pathways. (A) General scheme for convergence of integrin
  and growth factor–dependent pathways in which both are required for activation of
  gene expression and cell growth. (B) Constitutive activation is indicated by the
  boldface arrow. Activation of a step on the integrin arm of a pathway should lead
  to anchorage-independent growth, as illustrated by the behavior of Rho, Bcr-Abl,
  and ILK. Activation of a step on the growth factor receptor arm of the pathway should
  lead to serum independence. Activation of a step after convergence should induce
  both anchorage- and serum-independent growth.
