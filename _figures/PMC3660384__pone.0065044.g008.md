caption: In response to ST-induced DNA damage, ATM serves as a signal transducer for
  the activation of its downstream signaling pathway. Activated ATM simultaneously
  phosphorylates the Thr-68 and Ser-15 residues of Chk2 and p53, respectively. These
  phosphorylations lead to the activation of their downstream pathway components,
  which results in the inhibition of the activation of Cdc25 and an increase in the
  expression of p21waf1. These steps finally result in the inactivation of the Cyclin
  B1/Cdc2 complex and the induction of G2 arrest.
