caption: FoxO-1-CD36 and Notch signaling in tumor-associated endothelial cells (TAECs)
  and cancer stem cells (CSCs). Targeting both the FoxO1-CD36 signaling and Notch
  pathway may inhibit TAECs and attenuate maintenance and self-renewal of CSCs. Shown
  in this figure are the upregulated CD36 expression in both TAECs and CSCs via FoxO1.
  Whereas, the Notch pathway may upregulate arteriogenic genes or Notch ligands in
  TAECs, thus promoting interactions between TAECs and CSCs. Inhibition of CD36 may
  attenuate the generation of metastatic CSCs. Combined inhibition of the Notch pathway
  with CD36 signaling, both arteriogenic TAECs and CSCs will be targeted, subsequently
  leading to tumor regression and inhibition of tumor metastasis.
