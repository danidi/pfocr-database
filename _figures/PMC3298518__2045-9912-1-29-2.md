caption: The pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is significantly associated
  with oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress is also associated with neuronal
  cell death during the pathogenesis of multiple chronic neurodegenerative diseases,
  including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease
  (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It was found that the Nrf2/ARE pathway
  protects against neurodegeneration [,] as mentioned previously. Figure  demonstrates
  that PD may result from apoptosis of neuronal cells and death of Nigral cells induced
  via ROS. Increases in ROS result in mitochondrial dysfunction and neuro-inflammation,
  a common denominator of PD. On the other hand, Nrf2 acts as an emerging target to
  counteract mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Nrf2 activates the antioxidant
  response element (ARE) pathway, including a battery of cytoprotective genes, such
  as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory genes, and several transcription factors involved
  in mitochondrial biogenesis [].
