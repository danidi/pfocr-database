caption: Participation of ATR in maintenance of genome stability. DNA double strand
  breaks or replication stress induce an ATR protein response. ATR is recruited to
  regions of ssDNA replication protein A (RPA) through its partner, ATR-interacting
  protein (ATRIP). Subsequently, RAD9–RAD1-hus1 (9-1-1 complex) and DNA topoisomerase
  2 binding protein 1 (TOPBP1) are incorporated, leading to ATR activation. ATR–ATRIP
  recruitment results in CHK1 activation. This process is mediated by Claspin, Timeless
  and Tipin, which form a complex at replication forks. In the event of large areas
  of DNA damage or no repair, the replication fork stops, origin suppression occurs
  and the cell cycle is stopped. ATR/CHK1 blockade prevents DNA damage-induced cell-cycle
  arrest, resulting in inappropriate entry into mitosis, chromosome aberrations, unequal
  partitioning of the genome, and apoptosis
