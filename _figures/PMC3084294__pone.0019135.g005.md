caption: 'The typical prokaryotic arginine biosynthesis pathway. The NAGK family of
  enzymes (COG0548) catalyze the second step in arginine biosynthesis and are known
  as ArgB in many bacteria , , , . In general, NAGKs come in two forms: hexameric
  arginine-sensitive enzymes and dimeric arginine-insensitive enzymes. The arginine-sensitive
  varieties of these enzymes typically function as a critical point of feedback inhibition
  for arginine biosynthesis , , .'
