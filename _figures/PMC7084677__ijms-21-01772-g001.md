caption: The canonical phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin
  pathway. (A) In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is constitutively imported via translocase
  of the outer membrane (TOM)/translocase of the inner membrane (TIM)23 complexes
  to the inner membrane (IMM), cleaved by two proteases (mitochondrial processing
  peptidase (MPP) and presenilin-associated rhomboid-like (PARL)) and retro-translocated
  to the cytosol, where it is degraded. (B) When ΔΨM is dissipated, Adenine nucleotide
  translocator ANT inhibits TIM23-mediated import of PINK1, which is not processed
  and accumulates on the outer membrane (OMM). Here, a supercomplex is formed, composed
  by TOM complex subunits and PINK1 homodimers, facilitating PINK1 autophosphorylation
  and activation. Once activated, PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitinated substrates on
  the OMM and thus recruits and phosphorylates Parkin. Phosphorylated Parkin starts
  to ubiquitylate several proteins on the OMM, which are new substrates of PINK1 phosphorylation—a
  positive feedback loop is initiated, leading to the coating of damaged mitochondria
  with phospho-ubiquitin chain, red arrows. The MITOL mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase,
  seems to be fundamental for the introduction of the initial ubiquitination. Phospho-ubiquitin
  chains are bound by two mitophagy adaptors, Nuclear domain 10 protein 52 (NDP52)
  and Optineurin, blue arrows. The two adaptors recruit autophagosomes via Microtubule-associated
  protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) binding, allowing the engulfment of dysfunctional
  mitochondria. In parallel, PINK1 interacts with Beclin-1 and Parkin with Ambra1,
  further stimulating autophagosome formation, blue arrows.
