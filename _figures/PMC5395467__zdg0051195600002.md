caption: 'Confusion-2: glycolytic reactions have been analyzed separate from each
  other. Although most glycolytic reactions are associated with production or consumption
  of H+ they are connected in a metabolic pathway without major net changes in glycolytic
  intermediates (). Robergs () concludes that the LDH reaction can buffer H+. By examining
  the LDH reaction, isolated from the remaining glycolytic reactions, one could falsely
  come to this conclusion. However, oxidation of NADH in the LDH reaction equals glycolytic
  NADH production by glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The conversion
  of pyruvate to lactate has therefore no influence on cellular acid-base balance
  (see ).'
