caption: Relationship of GPAT4 to other enzymes in the pathway of de novo glycerolipid
  synthesis. GPAT isoforms located in mitochondria (GPAT1 and GPAT2) and endoplasmic
  reticulum (GPAT3 and GPAT4) catalyze the initial step in the synthesis of glycerophospholipids
  and TAG. AGPAT isoforms catalyze the second step in this pathway by acylating LPA
  to form PA. Acyl-CoA used for β-oxidation or TAG synthesis is regulated reciprocally
  by carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT1) and GPAT1 (). CL, cardiolipin; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol;
  PS, phosphatidylserine.
