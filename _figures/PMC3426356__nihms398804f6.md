caption: The adult heart responds to stress, such as pressure overload or β-adrenergic
  stimulation, by hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes. This results in thickened
  myocardial walls and smaller ventricular chamber(s). The PcG protein Ezh2 represses
  cardiac hypertrophy through a Six1-dependent pathway. The TrxG protein Brg1 is required
  for development of the hypertrophic response.
