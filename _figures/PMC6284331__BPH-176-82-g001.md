caption: The effect of changes in ECM‐mediated signalling pathways. (A) Integrin activation
  by ECM components such as collagen, fibronectin, tenascin and laminin can phosphorylate
  the FAK/Src pathway and lead to downstream changes in cell adhesion and migration.
  Integrin‐mediated FAK/Src activation is also central to the activation of (B) MAPK
  signalling via ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation as well as (C) PI3K/Akt activation,
  leading to increased proliferation and cell survival through changes in transcriptional
  gene regulation. (D) FAK/Src activation can also mediate Rho/Rho‐associated kinase
  (ROCK) signalling, which affects cytoskeletal organization and cell motility in
  normal and diseased tissue states. (E) Fibrillar collagen in the ECM activates DDR2,
  which can mediate the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways to influence gene expression
  and subsequently cellular behaviour. (F) Elastin binding to its receptor elastin
  binding protein receptor can influence PI3K/Akt signalling and MAPK signalling via
  ERK1/2. (G) Hyaluronan, another component of ECM remodelling, activates CD44 receptor,
  which can also affect Rho‐ROCK signalling.
