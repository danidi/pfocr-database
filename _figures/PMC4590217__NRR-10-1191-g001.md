caption: Schematic diagram of cell attachment and spreading on un-coated (A) and Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic
  acid (RGD)-coated (B) surfaces (adapted from Sedaghati et al., 2014).The interaction
  between cellular integrin receptor and RGD sequence on the surface of a biomaterial
  is important in controlling the intracellular signalling pathway.
