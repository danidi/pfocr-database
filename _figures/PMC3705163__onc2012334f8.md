caption: Schematic model indicating proposed mechanisms by which mutant p53 GOF induces
  EMT. Mutant p53 GOF induces EMT, through direct transrepression of miR-130b, an
  inhibitor of ZEB1, and subsequent activation of ZEB1-dependent signaling pathway.
pmcid: PMC3705163
papertitle: Mutant p53 gain-of-function induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition
  through modulation of the miR-130b–ZEB1 axis.
