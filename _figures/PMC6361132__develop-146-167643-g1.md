caption: The JAK/STAT pathway. (A) The mammalian JAK/STAT pathway. An extracellular
  ligand (yellow) binds to a transmembrane cytokine receptor (green), which lacks
  intrinsic kinase activity and instead constitutively associates with JAKs (gray).
  Ligand binding to receptors causes a conformational switch, leading to JAK activation
  by trans-phosphorylation. The activated JAKs (pink) then phosphorylate the receptor
  on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain. Inactive STAT dimers (purple) are
  recruited to the receptor at those phospho-tyrosine sites and are phosphorylated
  by activated JAKs. The phosphorylated STAT (pSTAT) dimers (blue) assume an activated
  dimer conformation, translocate to the nucleus, bind specific DNA sequences in target
  genes [consensus TTC(N)2–4GAA] and alter gene expression. SOCS genes, which are
  targets of the JAK/STAT pathway, encode inhibitory proteins (black) that promote
  degradation of the cytokine receptor and JAKs, thereby providing a negative-feedback
  loop. Tyrosine phosphorylation events are indicated by orange halos. (B) The Drosophila
  JAK/STAT pathway consists of three Upd ligands, Upd, Upd2 and Upd3 (referred to
  here collectively as Upd), one receptor called Dome, one JAK called Hop, and one
  STAT, termed Stat92E. Socs36E is a Stat92E target gene that encodes a negative regulator
  of pathway activity.
