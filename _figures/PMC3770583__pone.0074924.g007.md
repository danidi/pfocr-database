caption: AZA1 inhibits activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases, shifting the balance
  towards cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. These effects are exerted by different
  mechanisms. AZA1 inhibits the PAK pathway via the cell cycle regulator Cyclin D1
  and suppresses PAK and AKT activation leading to reduced BAD phosphorylation to
  induce pro-apoptotic activity. In addition, suppression of Rac1 and Cdc42 suppresses
  cancer cell migration and invasion by affecting actin polymerization and subsequent
  inhibition of lamellipodia and filopodia formation.
