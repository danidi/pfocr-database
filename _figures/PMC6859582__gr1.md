caption: 'Warburg''s theory that cancer cells depend on aerobic glycolysis led to
  the assumption that OXPHOS is downregulated in cancer. Increasing evidence demonstrates
  that certain cancers are reliant on OXPHOS for energy production. Oncogene addicted
  tumors are typically sensitive to primary pathway tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.
  After prolonged treatment, differentiated cancer cells are eliminated, however a
  subpopulation of malignant cells, the cancer stem cells, persist. Upregulation of
  STAT3 occurs via both canonical and non-canonical pathways. In the non-canonical
  pathway, serine727-phosphorylation (P-S727) of STAT3 is signaled via the MAP kinase
  (MAPK). P-S727-STAT3 activates mitochondrial STAT3 (mSTAT3), while GRIM-19 imports
  STAT3 into the mitochondria. The upregulation of mitochondrial STAT3 increases mitochondrial
  complex I and II activity, and therefore OXPHOS. The upregulation of mitochondrial
  STAT3 and OXPHOS are resistance mechanisms to TKI therapy, evident in work studying
  the metabolic reprogramming of persistent cancer stem cells. Treating oncogene addicted
  tumors with both primary pathway TKIs and OXPHOS inhibitors may therefore reverse
  resistance. P-Y705: Tyrosine705-phosphorylation.'
