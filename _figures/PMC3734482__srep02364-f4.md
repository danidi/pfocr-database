caption: Our results indicate increased SPD, SPM, PUT, Ac-SPD and Ac-SPM without a
  change of ORN in AD pathology. One theory suggests that the NMDA receptor excitotoxicity
  is caused by an excess of SPD and SPM due to ODC activity induced by plaque and/or
  tangle deposition in specific brain regions.
