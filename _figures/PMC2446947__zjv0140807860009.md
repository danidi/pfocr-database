caption: Model of Tax effects on the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway. Tax
  appears to interfere with the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA repair foci. As a result,
  p-ATM is not recruited efficiently to these sites and extension of γH2AX is inhibited.
  The disruption of this positive-feedback signaling results in premature attenuation
  of the DNA damage response.
