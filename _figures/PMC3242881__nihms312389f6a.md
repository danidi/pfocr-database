caption: '(A) Summary of S-1-P src activation pathways in VSMC: S-1-P-mediated src
  phosphorylation is mediated by S-1-PR1 and S-1-PR3 through a Gβγ-dependent pathway
  that leads to activation of p38MAPK and JNK. The inhibitors at each level are shown
  in the dark boxes. (B) Summary of S-1-P signaling in VSMC: S-1-P interacts with
  G-protein-coupled receptors S-1-PR1, S-1-PR2 and S-1-PR3 to induce MAPK-mediated
  cell migration. Activation of PI3-K by S-1-P leads to activation of akt, ERK1/2
  and p38MAPK and mTOR. S-1-P can mediate ras and rho activation and modulate ERK1/2
  and p38MAPK activity. src is activated by S-1-P through a Gβγ pathway and can in
  turn activate p38MAPK and JNK. S-1-P can induce the activation of PLCβ, the production
  of oxygen free radicals through NAD(P)H oxidase and the activation of the EGF receptor.
  The incremental knowledge derived from this report is shown in the dark boxes.'
