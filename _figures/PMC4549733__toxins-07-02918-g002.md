caption: A simplified overview (a modified schema from [,,] of LC3-associated phagocytosis
  (LAP) and canonical autophagy. (a) LAP is triggered by Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in response to microorganisms, such
  as bacteria, that are taken up by phagocytosis or that have actively invaded non
  phagocytic cells. LAP requires a subset of autophagy genes for the labelling of
  phagosomes with LC3 (Atg8), which promotes their lysosomal delivery and the efficient
  killing of vesicular pathogens; (b) Damage of the limiting membrane of the pathogen-containing
  vesicle, either accidental or caused by pathogens attempting to escape from the
  vesicle, exposes the cytosol to glycans previously hidden inside the vesicle; (c)
  Cytosol-accessible glycans are detected by galectin-8 (danger receptor), which,
  by recruiting the cargo receptor NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52), triggers autophagy;
  (d) Pathogens having escaped galectin-8-induced autophagy are met by another layer
  of PRRs in the cytosol such as NLR, and a yet-to-be-identified E3 ubiquitin ligase
  causes the ubiquitin-coating of invading bacteria. It remains to be established
  whether this ligase only targets membrane-associated or also free-floating bacteria,
  whether it is a PRR, and also whether its substrate is of bacterial [] or host origin
  such as LRSAM1 [] or WWP1 []; (e) A dominant pathway in the autophagic capture of
  bacteria such as Salmonella relies on tagging bacteria with a poly-ubiquitin coat,
  which is then bound by three apparently non-redundant ubiquitin binding autophagy
  adaptors, NDP52, p62 and optineurin [,,,]. As pointed out by Mostowy et al. [],
  the recruitment of p62 and NDP52 to Shigella is interdependent. These adaptors subsequently
  recruit specific autophagic machinery components, such as the LC3/Atg8 family proteins,
  triggering the autophagic cascade and autophagosome formation (initiation, elongation
  and closure).
