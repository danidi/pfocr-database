caption: Altered gene expression profiles and signaling pathways in vitiligo. The
  figure highlights some of the genes and RNA levels that are upregulated or downregulated
  in patients with vitiligo, and some of the main processes in which these molecules
  participate, such as cell homoeostasis, the pigment pathway (genes that regulate
  pigmentation such as POMC, DCT and some microRNAs that regulate translation of genes
  in skin cells), immune response and inflammation. miR, microRNA; pDCs, plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; CTLA4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated
  protein 4; FOXP3, forkhead box protein P3; LEF1, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1;
  PIK3CB, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit β; PTPN22,
  protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22; RPS6KB1, ribosomal protein S6
  kinase β-1; USF1, upstream stimulatory factor 1; POMC, proopiomelanocortin; DCT,
  dopachrometautomerase; MLANA, melanoma antigen recognized by Th1 cells; TYRP1, tyrosinase-related
  protein 1.
