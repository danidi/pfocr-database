caption: Interconnection between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein
  response (UPR) pathways and mitochondria-NLRP3 inflammasome in allergic diseases.
  The accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins in the ER lumen activates UPR, which
  is mediated by three ER transmembrane stress sensors including inositol-requiring
  1α (IRE1α), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK),
  and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In a condition of ER stress, an abundant
  ER chaperone, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), preferentially associates with
  accumulated misfolded/unfolded proteins. Dissociation of GRP78 from the ER stress
  sensors, or direct engagement of misfolded/unfolded protein to IRE1α, transmits
  signals about folding status of ER to the cytosol and nucleus. The canonical aspect
  of UPR regulates the secretory pathway of ER and attempts to reduce ER stress through
  reducing demand of protein folding, promoting ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and
  gene expression involved in cell survival (e.g., autophagy), and increasing ER chaperones
  to defend cells from ER stress. If cells fail to resolve ER stress, these adaptive
  responses will initiate apoptosis, mainly through C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP).
  In addition to this canonical aspect of UPR pathways, close interrelationship between
  ER/UPR pathways and cellular inflammatory platforms including mitochondria (e.g.,
  oxidative stress from mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS); mtROS) and NLRP3
  inflammasome (an interleukin-1β producing platform) may be critically implicated
  in a unique form of corticosteroid-resistant type 2 allergic immune response
