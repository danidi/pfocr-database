caption: Binding of GnRH to the GnRHR triggers an intracellular signaling cascade,
  which radiates from activation of PKC. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and downstream
  activation of ERK were blocked by general tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin
  A (Herb A) and PP2, by chelation of intracellular calcium release with EGTA/BAPTA,
  and by inhibition of PKC by Ro-31–8220. Addition of cytoskeletal inhibitors cytochalasin-D
  (cyto-D), latrunculin-B (lat-B), and RGDS tetrapeptides, which disrupt focal adhesions,
  confirmed the association of Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation with ERK activation.
  GnRH induced a focal adhesion-anchored signaling complex between c-Src and Pyk2,
  because Herb A, cyto-D, and lat-B all blocked the association. Phosphorylated Pyk2
  bound Grb2, and this association of Pyk2 activity, signaling complex formation,
  and ERK activation was confirmed using point mutations of Pyk2. Expression of a
  c-Src activation site mutant (Y402F) and mutation of the Grb2 binding site (Y881F)
  in Pyk2 all abrogated activation of ERK. Using dominant-negative mutants and the
  MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, we identified that the signaling complex activated Ras,
  c-Raf, and MEK, which induced nuclear localization of ERK. The nuclear focus of
  this Pyk-2-dependent ERK-activated pathway was Egr-1. Using PD98059, constitutively
  active Egr-1, DNA resections, and point mutation of Egr-1 DNA binding sites within
  the LH β-subunit gene promoter mapped ERK-responsive Egr-1 dependence to the PP
  and not the upstream response region (URR). Broken lines indicate activation pathways
  elucidated by others (, , , , ), whereas solid lines indicate direct activation
  demonstrated in this study and are described above. Light blue boxes are labeled
  with the inhibitor and dominant negative mutants used and are positioned at the
  appropriate point of the MAPK signaling cascade. PLC-β, Phospholipase C-β.
