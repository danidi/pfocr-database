caption: Schematic representation of the proposed molecular events that are affected
  by Ad-IRF3 in microglia. Ad-IRF3, through suppression of "M1-like" gene expression
  and over-expression of "M2-like" gene (IFNβ, IL-10 and IL-1ra) expression in microglia,
  can suppress proinflammatory cytokine cascades that are implicated in neurodegeneration.
  pAkt plays a major role in regulating microglial inflammatory gene expression. In
  Ad-IRF3-transduced microglia, a positive feedback mechanism between pAkt and pIRF3
  could induce a state that is dominated by the "M2-like" cytokines. See text for
  details.
