caption: Diagram of putative therapeutic target in the Notch pathway. Notch signaling
  could be inhibited theoretically at many different levels. It is possible to (1)
  interfere with Notch-ligand interactions, (2) inhibit receptor activation, (3) promote
  Notch ubiquitination and degradation, (4) inhibit its translocation to the nuclear
  compartment and (5) inhibit NICD nuclear complex formation.
