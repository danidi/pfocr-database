caption: Model for the role of Wnt signaling in hypothalamic progenitor differentiation.
  In zebrafish (above), Wnt signaling is active in unspecified embryonic progenitors
  and Sox3+ post-embryonic neural progenitors, but is lost as these cells undergo
  neurogenesis. Wnt signaling promotes mitotic activity in progenitors, and is also
  required for their ability to undergo neuronal differentiation, which underlies
  the transition from an “uncommitted” to a “committed” progenitor state. Finally,
  Wnt signaling must be inhibited for differentiation to proceed. In contrast the
  formation of radial glia is inhibited by Wnt activity. In the adult mouse (below),
  Wnt signaling is active in ventricular/subventricular zone cells (VZ/SVZ) that express
  neural progenitor markers, and in parenchymal zone cells that express neuronal and
  neuronal precursor markers. Ventricular Hes1+ progenitors do not require Wnt activity
  to make radial glial tanycytes, and ectopic pathway activity inhibits radial glial
  formation at the expense of other fates.
