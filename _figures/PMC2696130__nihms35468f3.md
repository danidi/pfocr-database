caption: A, in normal airways under high volume conditions, any soluble regulatory
  molecules such as adenosine (ADO) or secreted protease inhibitors are diluted to
  such an extent that CFTR is inactive and anion secretion does not occur and ENaC
  is near to fully active, leading to Na+-led isotonic ASL absorption with Cl- following
  through the paracellular pathway. B, as ASL volume diminishes, adenosine accumulate
  in the ASL sufficiently to activate CFTR (likely by stimulation of A2B adenosine
  receptors) and protease inhibitors (red circles) are secreted to mostly inactivate
  ENaC via inhibition of channel-activating proteases (CAPS). This leads to a steady
  state ASL height which approximates the height of outstretched cilia (7 μm) which
  is maintained by continued anion secretion through CFTR that is offset by a moderate
  amount of Na+ absorption through ENaC. C, to confirm that steady state ASL height
  is maintained by active ion transport, bumetanide can be applied serosally to block
  Cl- entry into the epithelia which is predicted to result in ASL collapse to CF
  levels (i.e. 3-4 μm). N.B., ASL HCO3- (< 10 mM) is insufficient to maintain a suitable
  ASL height in the absence of Cl-secretion. D, the physiological inhibition of ENaC
  with time is also required for maintenance of a steady-state ASL height and addition
  of a cationophore (nystatin) allows unregulated Na+-led ASL absorption to occur
  which is also predicted to cause ASL collapse.
