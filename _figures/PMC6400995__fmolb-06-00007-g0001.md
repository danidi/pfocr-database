caption: 'The kynurenine pathway with a focus on KYNA synthesis. (A) NFK, N-formylkynurenine;
  L-KYN, L-kynurenine; KYNA, kynurenic acid; 3-HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine; XA, xanthurenic
  acid; AA, anthranilic acid; 3-HAA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; ACMS, 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde;
  AMS, 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde; PA, picolinic acid; CBA, cinnabarinic acid;
  QA, quinolinic acid; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Inset: 1. At the beginning
  of the transamination reaction, the catalytic lysine of KAT is bound to the PLP
  molecule. 2. The α-amino group of L-KYN substitutes for Lys and binds to the cofactor,
  forming an external aldimine intermediate. 3. At the end of the first half-reaction,
  the resulting α-keto acid undergoes an intramolecular condensation reaction, releasing
  the final product, KYNA, and leaving the cofactor in the pyridoxamine phosphate
  (PMP) form, then, an α-keto acid is required to bring the enzyme back to its initial
  state through a series of equivalent reversed reactions (not shown). (B) The multiplicity
  of KYNA actions inside and outside the CNS. KYNA acts as an antagonist of specific
  receptors both at the synapses and at extra-synaptic sites (only selected targets
  are shown); KYNA possesses immunomodulatory properties mainly by behaving as an
  agonist/ligand of GPR35 and AHR. KYNA participates in the direct scavenging of ROS;
  BBB, blood-brain barrier. (C) Analysis of protein sequence similarity among different
  KATs, including representatives of non-mammalian KATs (Mj, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii;
  Ph, Pyrococcus horikoshii; Ae, Aedes aegypti; Ag, Anopheles gambiae; HKT, 3-hydroxykynurenine
  aminotransferase). The values in brackets refer to the percentage sequence identity
  to the corresponding human isoenzyme; *no significant sequence identity. The phylogenetic
  tree was generated by iTOL (Letunic and Bork, ). (D) Comparison of selected kinetic
  constants for the transformation of KYN to KYNA and 3-HK to XA catalyzed by the
  indicated KATs; (Han et al., , , , ).'
