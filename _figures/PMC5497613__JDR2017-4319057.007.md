caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism underlying SYFSF's renoprotection
  which is likely associated with an inhibition of TNF-α/NF-κBp65-mediated signaling
  pathway. SYFSF probably decreases the expression of TNF-α to prevent the phosphorylation
  of NF-κBp65 induced by high glucose and then alleviates the inflammatory response
  and ECM accumulation and normalizes the dyslipidemia.
