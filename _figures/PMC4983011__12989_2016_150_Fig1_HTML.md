caption: Processes involved in particle-induced pro-IL-1β expression. Pro-IL-1β expression
  requires intermediary mediators (signal 1). Silica-damaged macrophages or structural
  cells release intracellular proteins called alarmins that possess inflammatory activities
  once present in the extracellular environment. HGMB1 (High mobility group box-1),
  S100 and HSP (Heat shock proteins) proteins bind to multi-ligand receptors such
  as RAGE (Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) or TLRs (Toll-like receptors)
  and stimulate the NFkB (transcription factors nuclear factor-kB)/AP-1 (Activator
  protein 1) pathway, leading to pro-IL-1β expression by surrounding macrophages.
  IL-1α and IL-33, two members of the IL-1 family, also pass across damaged cell membranes
  and bind their specific receptors, IL-1RI and ST2 (Interleukin 1 receptor-like 1),
  respectively. Additionally, other cytokines that are not classified as alarmins
  but known to promote pro-IL-1β production via NFkB/AP-1 activation (i.e., TNF-α
  and IL-1β itself) also participate in the expression of pro-IL-1β and synergize
  with alarmins
