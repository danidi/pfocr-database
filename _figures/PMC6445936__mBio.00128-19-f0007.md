caption: Highlights of this study. (A) Infants fed by mothers with higher-core-fucosylated
  milk N-glycans (affected by Fut8 gene status) harbored more abundance of Bifidobacterium
  and Lactobacillus spp. and reduced abundance of Clostridiales and Pseudomonas spp.
  during lactation. (B) The neonates fed by Fut8+/− mice were characterized by reduced
  abundance of Lactobacillus, Bacteriodes, and Bifidobacterium spp. and increased
  abundance of members of the Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group and Akkermansia spp. in
  their gut; these neonates also exhibited a lower proportion of active B cells in
  spleen. (C) Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains can utilize chemically synthesized
  core-fucosylated oligosaccharides. Genes encoding Endo and α1,6-fucosidase in the
  genome of these bacteria are key genetic factors for the use of core fucose, and
  the resulting metabolites, 1,2-propanediol and lactate, promoted the activation
  of B cells via the BCR-mediated signaling pathway.
