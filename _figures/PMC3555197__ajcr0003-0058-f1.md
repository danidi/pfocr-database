caption: 'LXRs and prostate physiology: potential beneficial actions of LXRs over
  prostate cancer. LXR activity increases IDOL as well as various ABC transporters,
  which ultimately decreases LDL uptake and increases the efflux of cholesterol, altogether
  decreasing the intracellular pool of cholesterol. Consequently, this leads to the
  reduction of androgen synthesis and lipid raft/AKT/survival pathway. LXRs finally
  induce cell cycle arrests, and by inhibiting the expression of IL-6, COX-2 and iNOS
  limit the inflammation inside the tumor. Altogether, LXR activation may limit prostate
  cancer development.'
