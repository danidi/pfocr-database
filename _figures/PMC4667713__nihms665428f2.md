caption: Schematic representation of complete oxidation of glutamate via the ”pyruvate
  recycling pathway” (essential enzymes in red) and de novo synthesis of glutamate
  and glutamine from glucose via pyruvate carboxylase (PC) (essential enzymes in blue)
  in astrocytes.For de novo synthesis of glutamate and glutamine, glucose is metabolized
  to acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate via pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase,
  respectively. Acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate condenses to citrate and subsequently,
  α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) is formed. α-Ketoglutarate is converted to glutamate catalyzed
  by aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) and via an amidation, catalyzed by the energy
  requiring enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamine may be formed. The complete
  oxidation of glutamate is initiated by oxidative deamination catalyzed by glutamate
  dehydrogenase (GDH) and oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate to succinyl
  CoA catalyzed by α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH). The carbon skeleton is subsequently
  converted into malate via multiple steps in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and
  pyruvate via malic enzyme (ME). Alternatively, the concerted action of phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (PEPCK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) converts oxaloacetate (OAA) into
  pyruvate. The operation of ME or PEPCK plus PK in the direction of pyruvate is necessary
  for complete oxidation of glutamate. Pyruvate re-enters the TCA cycle via pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) and the carbon skeleton originating from glutamate may through
  this pathway be completely oxidized to CO2 in the TCA cycle. Asp, aspartate.
