caption: (A) Hsp90 and its cochaperone Sgt1 physically interact with Cyr1, keeping
  it in an inactive conformation, repressing morphogenesis, and maintaining the yeast
  form of growth. Hsp90 also binds Hsf1, repressing Hsf1 activity. Hsp90, along with
  its cochaperone Cdc37, maintains the stability of Cdc28, ensuring proper cell-cycle
  progression. The proteasome maintains protein homeostasis through regulated degradation
  of polyubiquitinated proteins.(B) Conditions that compromise Hsp90’s function, such
  as elevated temperature or inhibition of Hsp90 or the proteasome, relieve repression
  of Hsf1 and the cAMP-PKA pathway, inducing the heat shock response and morphogenesis,
  respectively. Inhibition of Hsp90 also leads to Cdc28 destabilization and degradation
  by the proteasome, further affecting cell-cycle progression and influencing morphogenesis
  via Bub2, Pho85-Pcl1-Hms1 signaling, and the mitotic exit network. The role of Hsf1
  in morphogenesis upon compromise of Hsp90 is unknown (indicated by dashed lines).
