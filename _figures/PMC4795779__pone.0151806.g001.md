caption: Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen causes the chaperone protein
  BiP to dissociate from the three stress transducers PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. Loss of
  BiP binding, allows for either oligomerization or phosphorylation of the ER transducers,
  resulting in activation of their corresponding downstream signaling pathways. Prolonged
  signaling by the ER transducers and an inability of the cell to eliminate misfolded
  proteins via the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway leads
  to an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP.
