caption: Potential therapeutic targets for macrophage polarization in CKD. Macrophages
  demonstrate diverse functional phenotypes with two extreme M1 (pro-inflammatory)
  and M2 (anti-inflammatory) polarization states in response to renal inflammation,
  injury, repair and fibrosis, which implies that reduction of M1 polarization and
  induction of M2 polarization could be a promising therapeutic avenue for treatment
  of CKD. To reduce M1 polarization, inhibitors of TLRs and NLRP3 inflammasomes are
  promising therapeutic targets in addition to inhibition of macrophage recruitment,
  proliferation, and transition to myofibroblasts. Some of these agents are currently
  in Phase II or III trials []. To induce M2 polarization, ex vivo IL-4/M-CSF injection,
  endotoxin precondition in sepsis injured mice, and induction of M1 to M2 switch
  have been described []. However, roles of M2 macrophages in renal anti- versus pro-fibrotic
  pathology is controversial. Bardoxolone methyl, an activator of the Nrf2 pathway
  and an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway, has been evaluated in phase I to III clinical
  trials for a variety of human diseases including CKD (www.clinicaltrials.gov)
