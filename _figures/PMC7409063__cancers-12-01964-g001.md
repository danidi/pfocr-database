caption: Schematic of extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis and signaling between
  neighboring cells. Generation of EVs from a host cell, depicting small (sEV; 40–200
  nm), and medium to large (m/lEV; 0.2–1 µm) EVs and apoptotic bodies (1–5 µm). sEVs
  find their origin in the early endosomal compartment which give rise to multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs). MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane to secrete sEVs. Biogenesis of
  sEVs can occur via the endosomal sorting complex related to transport (ESCRT)-dependent
  pathway or ESCRT-independent pathway. Release of sEVs involves proteins such as
  RabGTPases (e.g., Rab11, Rab35, Rab27a/27b). Cargo in MVBs fated for degradation
  are processed via lysosomes. m/lEVs are released by budding of the plasma membrane
  regulated by proteins including Arf6 and RhoA GTPase, while dying cells undergo
  blebbing and form cell protrusions to release apoptotic bodies. Exomeres (~35 nm)
  are also released by cells via unknown mechanisms. A magnified sEV is presented
  on the right, demonstrating commonly found sEV cargo (DNA, messenger RNA (mRNA),
  microRNA (miRNA), non-coding RNA (ncRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), proteins,
  enzymes, heat shock proteins). Recipient cells internalize sEVs via endocytosis.
