caption: Concerted agrin and YAP activity in the maintenance of NMJs and promoting
  cardiac regeneration. (A) Agrin secretion from motor nerve terminal activates Lrp4-MuSK
  signaling. This potentiates YAP and possibly β-catenin activity in the nucleus of
  muscle cells, thereby, aggregating Acetylcholine receptors (AchR) and propagating
  nerve impulse to the muscle cells. (B) Though adult hearts have minimal agrin expression
  compared to that during neonatal stages, stimulation with recombinant agrin has
  protective values against myocardial infarction (MI) in adult mice hearts. Mechanistically,
  agrin binds to and inhibits dystroglycan complex, thereby, shifting YAP into the
  nucleus to engage cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration.
