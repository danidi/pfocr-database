caption: B cells develop in the bone marrow and migrate to the periphery. After stimulation,
  mature B cells differentiate into germinal center B cells, memory B cells, and plasma
  cells. Some plasma cells re-enter the bone marrow where they find the microenvironment
  supporting their longterm survival. The figure shows stages of B-cell maturation
  and differentiation affected by the mutation or loss of different TNF receptors
  (in blue rectangles) their ligands (in red rectangles) or members of the NFκB pathway
  (in green rectangles).
