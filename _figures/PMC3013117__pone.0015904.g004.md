caption: Evidence suggests that substance P elicits MIF release in a process that
  is dependent on bladder afferent and post-ganglionic activation of muscarinic and
  adrenergic bladder receptors. Since this release appears is initiated by substance
  P, it is referred to as “neurogenic” MIF release , , . In addition, findings from
  the present experiments show that activation of PAR1 receptors in deep layers of
  the urothelium can also elicit MIF release. Since this effect occurs in vitro (UROtsa)
  cells, this pathway appears to be independent of nerve-activation. However, nerve-activation
  may still contribute, since intravesical lidocaine (to stop all bladder nerve activity)
  reduced such release in vivo. This alternate pathway for MIF release may be activated
  by thrombin generated locally as part of the inflammation process or may be activated
  by proteases found in the urine. Activation of either or both pathways results in
  MIF release from urothelial cells, MIF binding to cell-surface CD74 in urothelial
  cells and activating extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and a pro-inflammatory
  cytokine cascade. Thus, by standing upstream of such a pro-inflammatory cytokine
  cascade, MIF maintains or augments bladder inflammation.
