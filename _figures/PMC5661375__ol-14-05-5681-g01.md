caption: 'Function of TGF-β1 in normal lung and lung cancer cell responses to radiotherapy.
  In normal lung cells: ROS are produced following exposure to radiation; ROS subsequently
  activate the TGF-β1 signaling pathway and stimulate TGF-β1 secretion into the plasma,
  a potential risk factor for radiation-induced lung injury (). In lung cancer cells:
  Regulation of the expression of certain miRs follows TGF-β1 signaling pathway activation;
  the TGF-β1 signaling molecules diffuse to and activate bystander cells (); miR-183
  may transcriptionally be regulated by the TGF-β1 signaling pathway to silence NK
  cells by repressing DAP12 transcription, which is critical for surface NK receptor
  stabilization and downstream signal transduction (); TGF-β1 exposure induces EMT
  and radiotherapy resistance (). TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition; NK, natural killer; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RP, radiation pneumonitis;
  I-SMAD, inhibitory SMAD; SBE, SMAD binding element; P, phosphorylated; miR, microRNA.'
