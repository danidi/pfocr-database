caption: The proposed mechanism for survivin overexpression in LSCs. (A) TNF-α stimulation
  leads to transactivation of TNFR, which activates ERK/MSK/Sp1 pathways. This activation,
  together with c-Myc, concurrently regulates survivin expression in LSCs, facilitating
  LSCs growth, allowing LSCs escape from apoptosis (B), and finally permitting the
  evolution to the “Seed cell” in acute myeloid leukemia (C). The straight arrow represented
  activation, the dotted arrow represented none affection, and TBP and RNA PII represented
  the transcription initiation complex.
