caption: Depletion of CX3CR1 leads to increased activation of the necrosome in PMNs.
  Activation of TLR4 in PMNs by lipopolysaccharide leads to the phosphorylation of
  the necrosome-related RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL. The activated MLKL induces the full
  necroptotic response by disrupting the cellular membrane, releasing DAMPs (IL-33
  and HMGB1) and therefore further increasing inflammation.
