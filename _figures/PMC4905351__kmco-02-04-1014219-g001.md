caption: Acquired dependency on a molecular network encoded on chromosome 5q and involving
  TRAF6, p62, and NF-κB. (A) Differentially expressed genes residing within the deleted
  region on chr 5q were identified by comparing gene expression profiles of CD34+
  BM cells from del(5q) MDS/AML patients and normal CD34+ controls (adapted from Pellegatti
  et al.) (left). Pathway analysis was performed to generate a list of potentially
  targetable gene regulatory networks (right). Shown is a molecular network of genes
  that are overexpressed from the intact 5q allele. The molecular network is predicted
  to regulate NF-κB. In addition, the genes within the molecular network are enriched
  for NF-κB target genes, implicating an NF-κB feed-forward loop (right). (B) Model
  of an intrachromosomal network involving miR-146a/p62/TRAF6/NF-κB in HR del(5q)
  MDS/AML. miR-146a deletion results in derepression of TRAF6 protein. TRAF6 overexpression
  results in activation of NF-κB. NF-κB transcription factors induce p62 expression
  from the remaining allele within del(5q). p62 is an important cofactor for sustaining
  NF-κB activation through its TRAF6-binding domain. The p62/TRAF6 signaling complex
  and subsequent NF-κB activation can be inhibited by disrupting p62 and TRAF6 binding.
  AML, acute myeloid leukemia; BM, bone marrow; del(5q), deletion of chromosome 5q;
  HR, high-risk; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome; p62, sequestosome 1/SQSTM1; TRAF6,
  TNF receptor-associated factor 6.
