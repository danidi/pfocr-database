caption: 'Capsaicin mediates saliva secretion via transient receptor potential vanilloid
  subtype 1 (TRPV1). (a) Calcium-activated chloride channel (CACC)-induced saliva
  secretion. Activation of Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) via acetylcholine
  (Ach) mediates G-protein coupled signaling downstream, including the phospholipase
  Cg (PLCg) pathway. The generated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) by PLCg induces
  Ca2+ mobilization from ER storage. Capsaicin increased [Ca2+]i level by increasing
  the cation conductance of TRPV1. The increased [Ca2+]i promotes the saliva secretory
  process by activating CACC, leading the efflux of chloride ions toward ductal space,
  and the subsequent generation of an electrochemical gradient beyond the apical border
  of acinar cells. (b) The role of TRPV1 in trans- and paraceulluar routes. TRPV1
  activation enhances paracellular permeability by regulating the spatial distribution
  of F-actin linked to tight junction (TJ). The expression level of TJ proteins—including
  zonula occludin (ZO)-1 and Claudin (Cldn)-3—is also increased by TRPV1 activation.
  In the transcellular route, capsaicin treatment enhances the aquaporin 5 (AQP5)
  trafficking to the plasma membrane and its mRNA expression level. However, the accurate
  mechanism underlying AQP5 trafficking is still unclear. Broken lines are used for
  tentative interactions. For details, see text. PIP2: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate;
  DAG: diacylglycerol; MLCK: myosin light chain kinase; ROCK: RhoA-Rho-associated
  protein kinase.'
