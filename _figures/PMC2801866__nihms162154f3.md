caption: Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) binds to two receptors on endothelial cells that
  inhibit NO signaling. The second and third central type 1 repeats of TSP1 contain
  sequences with known CD36-binding activities. The intact protein, recombinant type
  1 repeats or synthetic peptides derived from the active repeats bind to CD36 and
  inhibit uptake of myristate via this plasma membrane fatty acid translocase. Myristate
  mediates membrane anchoring of a number of signaling proteins including the Src
  kinases. Membrane anchoring of Src and other undefined targets leads to increased
  activation of eNOS, which is inhibited by TSP1 . Simultaneously, myristate activates
  eNOS in an AMP kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner , which may also be inhibited by TSP1.
  Inhibition of NO signaling via CD36 requires concentrations of TSP1 that exceed
  those normally circulating in plasma but can be found in plasma of some cancer patients,,.
  The more potent TSP1 inhibitory pathway involves the signaling receptor CD47. Two
  CD47-binding sequences have been identified in the C-terminal domain of TSP1. Engaging
  CD47 signals through undefined pathways that simultaneously inhibit activation of
  soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK-I),. These
  pathways inhibit NO signaling due either endogenous or exogenous NO.
