caption: Model of Imd signaling based on genetic epistasis data in vivo. Our genetic
  epistasis analysis places diap2 downstream of or in parallel to imd, Dredd, Tak1,
  and Relish. Intriguingly, loss of diap2 copies the phenotype of Tak1 mutant animals,
  since Diptericin induction, following enforced expression of imd and Dredd, is also
  blocked in Tak1 mutant animals, while this is not the case in kenny and ird5 mutant
  flies. The Imd signal transduction pathway bifurcates at the level of Tak1, which
  is required for the activation of the NF-κB signaling branch as well as the JNK
  signaling branch, both of which are necessary for expression of antibacterial peptide
  genes in the fat body. We currently favor the model whereby diap2 functions genetically
  at the level of Tak1. This view is supported by recent reports of Drosophila tissue
  culture cells which suggest that DIAP2 is required for Tak1-mediated JNK activation.
  Arrows indicate genetic interactions that rely on overexpression of individual components
  of the Imd pathway in vivo. Note that the ability to induce Diptericin expression
  varied substantially among heat shock-induced overexpression of imd, Dredd, Tak1,
  and Relish (see Fig.  for more details). AMPs, antimicrobial peptides.
