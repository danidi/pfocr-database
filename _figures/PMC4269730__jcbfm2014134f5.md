caption: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling pathway. Canonical signaling
  by TGF-beta is typically thought of in terms of two opposing, but interconnected,
  signaling pathways. Ligands in the TGF-beta or BMP family bind to specific Ser/Thr
  kinase type I (such as ALK1 and ALK5) and type II receptors (such as TGFBR2 and
  BMPR2) on the cell surface. Activation leads to phosphorylation of either SMAD2/3
  or SMAD1/5/8, the intracellular effectors of the TGF family. These activated SMADs
  form complexes with SMAD4 that accumulate in the nucleus, where they go on to regulate
  the expression of target genes.,  We propose that losartan has an effect on the
  canonical signaling cascade, independent of type I and type II TGF-beta receptors.
  It has been previously shown that angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) blockade
  antagonizes AT1 receptor stimulation of TGF-beta, decreasing activation of SMAD2.
  The presented data suggest that activation of SMAD1/5/8 occurs after antagonism
  of the AT1 receptor with the use of losartan.
