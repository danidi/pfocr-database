caption: Regulatory model of the MBW complexes for juvenile red fading in sweetpotato
  leaves. (A) Three main trends summarized for the profiles of anthocyanin metabolites
  and underlying genes. The purple shadow represents the anthocyanin accumulation
  and expression of most structural genes, which followed the first major trend. The
  lines represent expressions of the eight MYBs, with all three trends included. Red
  lines represent MYB activators, blue lines represent accompanying MYB repressors,
  and the black line represents the antagonistic MYB repressor. Detailed trend classifications
  were shown on the right side for the MYB activators (purple shaded) and repressors
  (blue shaded). (B) Regulatory model of the MBW complexes involving multiple MYB
  activators and repressors. The signs above the MBW complex show possible hierarchical
  signals. The arrows below the MBW complex show the regulation on the anthocyanin
  pathway genes and possible feedback modulation within the MBW complexes. The red
  and blue colors represent activation and repression, respectively.
