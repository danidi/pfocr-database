caption: miRNA-gene network in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway [] and regulatory
  network in early sex differentiation of Nile tilapia. The genes in boxes are differentially
  expressed in the mRNA-Seq and were validated by previous transcriptomic analyses
  []. Blue box nodes represent upregulated genes in XY gonads, red box nodes represent
  upregulated genes in XX gonads, and black box nodes represent genes with no significant
  difference between XX and XY. miRNAs in the ellipses potentially regulated the corresponding
  gene expression. Blue ellipses represent downregulated miRNAs in XX gonads; red
  ellipses represent downregulated miRNAs in XY gonads
