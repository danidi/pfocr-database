caption: RNase III enzymes may have regulatory roles that are independent of miRNA
  production. (A) mRNAs bearing short hairpin structures in untranslated or coding
  regions can be recognized and cleaved by Drosha/DGCR8, resulting in mRNA destabilization.
  The best-characterized example of this is cleavage of the dgcr8 mRNA by Drosha.
  (B) The pol III-transcribed long double-stranded Alu transcripts are toxic to cells
  unless they are cleaved by Dicer to short, inert fragments. In addition, direct
  dicing of viral replication intermediates may contribute to antiviral defense in
  Drosophila.
