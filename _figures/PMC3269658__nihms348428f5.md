caption: Differentiation pathways of CSCs. A. The Bone morphogenic protein pathway,
  through the activation of the various bone morphogenic protein receptors increases
  the activity of PS-SMAD1/5/8, leading to an increase in Id1, Id3 and Hes1 expression,
  ultimately leading to differentiation. B. The STAT3 pathway is similarly activated
  by CNTF in a manner mediated by BMPR1B, also leading to differentiation. C. Inhibition
  of the mTOR pathway, either by direct inhibition with Rapamycin or by inhibition
  of the upstream PI3K pathway leads to decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K, also
  driving differentiation. D. As a result of the above pathways, the CSC differentiates,
  losing Nestin, Sox2 and Yb-1 expression and gaining GFAP
