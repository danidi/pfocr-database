caption: The biosynthetic pathways of 2-arachidonylglycerol. Intracellular Ca2+ initiates
  2-AG biosynthesis by inducing the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) in the membrane
  either by stimulating the phosphatidyl-inositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) pathway,
  or the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA), and the subsequent activation of phosphatidic
  acid hydrolase. 2-AG is the product of DAG-lipase acting on DAG. The second pathway
  involves hydrolysis of PI by phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and hydrolysis of the resultant
  lyso-PI by a specific lyso-PLC. In certain conditions, 2-AG can also be synthesized
  through the conversion of 2-arachidonyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by phosphatase
  to yield 2-AG. Once synthesized, 2-AG can transported to the outside of the cell
  through a process that has not yet been characterized. AMT, anandamide membrane
  transporter.
