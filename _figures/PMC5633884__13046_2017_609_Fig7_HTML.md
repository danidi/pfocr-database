caption: 'Elevated expression of Par3 promotes PCa metastasis via Hippo pathway inactivation.
  In PCa, Elevated expression of Par3 enhances its interaction with KIBRA to form
  a Par3/aPKC/KIBRA complex so to dissociate KIBRA/Merlin/FRMD6 complex. As a result,
  the interaction of KIBRA with LATS is attenuated and phosphorylation of LATS and
  downstream YAP is decreased to enhance the nuclear translocation of YAP, which promotes
  transcription of several pro-metastatic genes by conjunction of YAP with TEAD transcription
  factors. p: phosphorylation'
