caption: Proposed mechanism based on the obtained results. BCP crystals found in 100%
  of OA patients at the moment of joint replacement (Ea et al., ), can activate NLRP3
  inflammasome in macrophages leading to IL-1β secretion (Pazar et al., ), but this
  process does not occur in chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts (Kolly et al., ;
  Jin et al., ). In addition BCP crystals induce IL-6 in macrophages, fibroblasts
  and chondrocytes. In these latter cells, BCP crystals induce IL-6, which in turn
  induce mineralization, thus creating a vicious circle and a chronification of the
  disease. Strategies interrupting this vicious circle could ameliorate this degenerative
  disease.
