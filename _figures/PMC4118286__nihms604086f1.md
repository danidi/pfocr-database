caption: Major physiological functions of the endoplasmic reticulum and their perturbations
  cause ER stress and activate the unfolded protein response. The endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) fulfills several important processes within the cell. Proteins of the secretory
  pathway are synthesized and folded in the oxidative environment of the ER lumen.
  Properly folded proteins can be distributed to other subcellular compartments through
  vesicular traffic. Terminally misfolded proteins are exported to the cytoplasm where
  they are degraded by the proteasome. The ER plays a major role in lipid biosynthesis
  and calcium handling, the latter being a primary messenger for communication between
  ER and mitochondria. The ER serves as a homeostatic stress sensor, activating the
  adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore the folding capacity of the
  ER.
