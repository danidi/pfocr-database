caption: Nucleotide biosynthesis for DNA and RNA requires Ribose-5-phosphate, which
  can be derived from either Glucose-6-phosphate through the oxidative arm of the
  pentose phosphate shunt or the glycolytic intermediates, fructose-6-phosphate and
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, through the non-oxidative arm. Genetic data in yeast
  indicate that both the non-oxidative and oxidative arms are on their own, dispensable
  for cell viability. However, yeast do not tolerate simultaneous inactivation of
  both arms of the pathway, such as the combined loss of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
  (PGD) with either transketolase (TKT), transaldolase (TALD) or Ribulose Isomerase/Epimerase
  (RPI/ RPE), shown in Red. Given that no alternative pathways of Ribose-5-phosphate
  synthesis are known, it is very likely that cancer cells with 1p36 deletion encompassing
  PGD () would be entirely dependent on the non-oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate
  shunt, and as such, highly sensitive to inhibition of either TKT, TALD, RPI or RPE.
