caption: (A) Based on our findings, TL-1 cells have a decreased expression of IFNGR1
  and IFNGR2, rendering the cells unresponsive to IFN-γ-induced signaling. This allows
  uncontrolled production of IL-2 induced IFN-γ production due to lack of induction
  of negative feedback regulators. (B) However, TL-1 cells are responsive to IL-2
  leading to activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. STAT1 activation positively correlates
  with STAT3 while the activation of these proteins is enhanced upon knockdown of
  STAT5b. STAT5b and STAT3 promote transcription of IFN-γ and IL-10, respectively.
