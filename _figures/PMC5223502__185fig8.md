caption: Model for the cross-talk of G1/S transcriptional regulation, H3K4 methylation,
  and benomyl toxicity. Defective H3K4 methylation resulting from the absence of Set1,
  or absence of the PHD subunit Pho23 of Rpd3L, results in resistance toward benomyl
  as does defective gene regulation during G1/S in Δmbp1 and Δswi4 cells. Benomyl
  activates the SAC by destabilizing microtubules. Mutations in aurora kinase (ipl1-2)
  interfere with activation of the SAC, resulting in improper chromosome segregation
  in the presence of benomyl. Absence of H3K4 methylation and defective G1/S transcriptional
  control antagonize the biological effect of benomyl in the presence of both WT and
  mutant aurora kinase, consistent with a role downstream of the SAC. The 3′→5′ exonuclease
  Rrp6, Tub3, and Tub2 tubulins are required for this antagonistic pathway.
