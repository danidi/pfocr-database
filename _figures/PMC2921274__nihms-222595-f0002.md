caption: (A) EPHA2/HRAS-Erk negative feedback loop. Activation of the HRAS-Erk pathway
  increases EPHA2 expression through MEK1 and decreases EPHRIN-A1 expression, although
  it is not known if this also occurs through MEK1,,. In turn, ephrin-dependent EPHA2
  activation inhibits HRAS-Erk signaling and also downregulates EPHA2 levels by causing
  receptor internalization and degradation. (B) Positive and negative EPHB2/MAP kinase
  feedback loops. In a positive feedback loop, ephrin-B-dependent EPHB2 activation
  stimulates the HRAS-Erk pathway, and the increase in Mek and/or Erk activity in
  turn enables enhanced responsiveness of EPHB2 to ephrin-B stimulation through unknown
  mechanisms. However, in a different cellular context EPHB2 can also inhibit the
  HRAS-Erk pathway,, which may in turn reduce EPHB2 activation by ephrin. Although
  not shown in the figure, EPHRIN-B1 stimulation can also downregulate EphB2 levels
  by causing internalization/degradation. (C) EPHA2/Akt negative feedback loop. The
  Akt kinase (activated by growth factor receptors (GFR), Src family kinases or mutations
  in upstream proteins or Akt itself) phosphorylates serine 897 in the carboxy-terminal
  tail of EPHA2 leading to increased EPHA2-dependent cell migration and invasion.
  In turn, EPHRIN-A1-induced EPHA2 signaling inactivates Akt by causing its dephosphorylation
  at T308 and S473, thus decreasing EPHA2 phosphorylation at serine 897 and, consequently,
  cell migration and invasion. Other pathways downstream of EPHA2 can also inhibit
  migration and invasion. (D) EPHA2/E-CADHERIN positive feedback loop. E-CADHERIN
  expression increases EPHA2 expression, surface localization, interaction with EPHRIN-A1,
  and thus forward signaling, (Box 1). In turn, EPHA2 signaling enhances E-CADHERIN-mediated
  adhesion. Dotted lines indicate regulation of protein levels rather than activity.
