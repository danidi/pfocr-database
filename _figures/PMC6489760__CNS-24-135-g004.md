caption: Proposed model of the STN‐DBS effective network. A, Alterations of brain
  activity by STN‐DBS. STN‐DNS mainly modulates the striato‐thalamo‐cortical pathway,
  showing remote effects in the cortical regions via network modulation as well as
  local effects in the target and nearby subcortical regions. For the local effects,
  STN‐DBS may affect (i) axon terminals synapsing on neurons of the STN, (ii) the
  dendrites or soma of neurons in the STN, (iii) the action potential‐initiating segment
  in the axon hillock or proximal axon of interneurons, (iv) efferent neurons residing
  in the STN, and (v) axons passing through or in the vicinity of the STN (gray arrow).
  For the remote effects, STN‐DBS reduces brain activity in the motor cortex, such
  as the M1 and caudal SMA (DOWN arrow in deep blue). Collectively, these data lead
  us to postulate that the STN‐DBS effective network, which is composed of the bilateral
  SMA and left M1 areas, and the bilateral thalamus/STN/GPi, may underlie the neural
  substrate of the therapeutic benefit of STN‐DBS. CAU, caudate nucleus; DA, dopamine;
