caption: Putative metabolic pathways were inferred from changes in the plasma and
  liver levels of intermediates in the G6PDx-FB mice. Red indicates the significantly
  elevated metabolites relative to those in the controls. Green indicates significantly
  reduced metabolites relative to those of the controls.
