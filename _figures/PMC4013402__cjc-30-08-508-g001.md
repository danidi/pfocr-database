caption: Glucose and glutamine are transported through cell membranes by their respective
  transporters (GLUT-1, -3 and -4 for glucose; SLC5A1 and SLC7A1 for glutamine). Glucose
  is metabolized in the cytosol to pyruvate, which can be either converted to lactate
  or transported into the mitochondria for further catabolism through the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle coupled with respiration through the electron transport chain (ETC).
  In many cancer cells, glucose is mainly used for the glycolytic pathway, leading
  to a generation of lactate and important metablic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate
  for the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that generates NADPH and ribose for maintaining
  redox balance and synthesis of nucleic acids. The flow of glucose into mitochondria
  in the form of pyruvate is relatively low in cancer cells. Glutamine is actively
  metabolized in cancer cells, both in the cytosol and in the mitochondria, where
  it is catalyzed by glutaminase to generate glutamate, which is further converted
  to α-ketoglutarate for utilization through the TCA cycle. Both glycolysis and the
  TCA cycle provide important metabolic intermediates that serve as substrates for
  other pathways including the synthesis of nucleic acids, fatty acids, amino acids,
  and glutathione. The highly active pathways in cancer cells are indicated with bold
  arrows, whereas the less active metabolic flows are shown with thin arrows. Some
  of the important enzymes involved in cancer metabolism are indicated. HKII, hexokinase-2;
  PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2 isoform; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
