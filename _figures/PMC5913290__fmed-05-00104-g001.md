caption: Key elements in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. In case of double-strand
  breaks (DSB), the DNA damage sensor MRN complex recruits the protein kinase ATM
  which activates γH2AX at the damaged site. γH2AX connects to MDC1, and this complex
  amplifies the activity of the MRN complex which, in a positive feedback, amplifies
  the ATM activity and the dispersal of γH2AX along the chromosome. MDC1 and 53BP1
  further mediates the activation of CHK2 which carries the signal to distant locations
  on the genome. For single-strand breaks (SSB), the protein kinase ATR is activated
  and amplified by the 9-1-1 complex and TOPBP1, which also mediates the activation
  of CHK1. The signaling pathway cascades toward the key factors p53 and CDC25. When
  the lesion is repaired, the DDR complexes are dismantled (, , ).
