caption: The MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. Once transcribed, viral mRNAs
  are translated into proteins that constitute the pool of MHC-I restricted epitopes
  resulting from proteasomal degradation of nascent proteins and DRiPs. Degraded peptides
  are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter associated
  with antigen processing (TAP) where chaperones facilitate their binding to newly
  synthesized MHC-I molecules for vesicular migration through the golgi to the cell
  surface. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize viral antigenic peptides and initiate
  an immune response. Viruses that evade the immune system have evolved to interfere
  with key steps of the MHC-I presentation pathway. Strategies that downregulate viral
  protein synthesis through translational control mechanisms can lead to immune evasion
  and subsequent latent infection.
