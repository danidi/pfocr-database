caption: The metabolic pathway of baicalin-related targets relate to verified biomarkers
  and fever-related molecules. (a) The metabolic pathway of baicalin-related target
  CASP3 relate to fever-related molecule PGF2α (Yellow indicates CASP3, green indicates
  IMP and N6-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-AMP and red indicates PGF2α); (b) Metabolic pathway
  of baicalin-related target CASP3 relate to fever-related molecule NO (Yellow indicates
  CASP3, green indicates IMP and N6-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-AMP and blue indicates fever-related
  molecule NO); (c) The metabolic pathway of baicalin-related target HIF-1α relate
  to fever-related small molecule cAMP (Yellow indicates HIF-1α, green indicates N6-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-AMP
  and azure indicates cAMP); (d) Metabolic pathway of baicalin-related target HIF-1α
  to fever-related molecule PGE2, PGF2α (Yellow indicates HIF-1α, green indicates
  IMP and N6-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-AMP and red indicates PGE2, PGF2α).
