caption: 'The physiological functions of Pin1 in the nervous system. a Pin1 is implicated
  in neurodevelopment, where it tightly regulates neuronal differentiation and axonal
  growth. In particular, Pin1 is highly expressed during neurodevelopmental stages,
  where it controls cortical differentiation of neuron progenitor cells (NPCs), by
  acting on β-catenin pathway, without affecting gliogenesis. Moreover, Pin1 is required
  for the development of the central nervous system for axonal growth during embryonic
  development and for establishing a proper axonal connectivity, by controlling the
  adhesion and spread of the axonal growth cone. b Pin1 acts also as modulator of
  synaptic activity. At glutamatergic synapses, Pin1 is catalytically present in dendrites,
  where, under basal conditions, it inhibits protein translation, required for late
  LTP maintenance, and negatively regulates PSD95/GluN2B complex formation, as well
  as spine density, and NMDA-mediated synaptic transmission. At glycinergic synapses,
  Pin1 interacts with gephyrin and alters its overall conformation, thereby affecting
  the function of glycine receptors. At GABAergic synapses, it inhibits the ability
  of neuroligin 2 to interact with the scaffolding protein gephyrin. c Pin1 is a key
  context–dependent signal transducer of neuronal cell death and survival signals.
  In developing neurons, Pin1 binds and stabilizes JNK-phosphorylated forms of BIMEL,
  protecting it from proteasomal degradation and thereby activating the mitochondrial
  cell death machinery via c-Jun. In addition, Pin1 overexpression overrides NGF-derived
  survival signals and triggers caspase-dependent neuronal cell death. Besides such
  pro-apoptotic action, Pin1 also mediates pro-survival effects: as shown by various
  observation, as reported in the text, and in in vitro experiments on oligodendrocytes,
  where Pin1 exerts an anti-apoptotic function by binding and stabilizing the anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1, a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family, in the cytosol'
