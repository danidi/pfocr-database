caption: 'Regulations and outputs of the TOR signaling pathway in photosynthetic organisms:
  TOR is a conduc TOR of nutritional and metabolic processes. Legend: The TOR (Target
  of Rapamycin) protein kinase is a central regulatory hub connecting various environmental
  and internal signals with the plant and algal metabolic and growth processes. This
  kinase is the heart of the evolutionary conserved TORC1 complex in which it interacts
  with LST8 (Lethal with Sec Thirteen protein 8) and RAPTOR (Regulatory-Associated
  Protein of TOR). The association of R2TP (Pontin/RuvBL1-Reptin/RuvBL2-Spaghetti/Tah1-Pih1),
  TTT (Tel2-Tti1-Tti2) complex and HSP90 chaperone allow the dimerization and stabilization
  of the TORC1 complex depending on ATP levels. Light and photosynthesis produce sugars,
  which, through the ETC (Electron Transport Chain), are known to stimulate TOR activity
  and to inhibit SnRK1 (Snf1-Related Kinase 1), the antagonist kinase of TOR. SnRK1
  is activated by low energy and nutrient conditions and phosphorylates RAPTOR, inhibiting
  TOR activity. Phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and amino acids also stimulate TOR activity.
  In response to these signals, TOR acts on different targets like S6K (ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase), YAK1 (Yet another Kinase 1) or TAP46 (PP2A regulatory subunit
  TAP46) to regulate mRNA translation, nutritional and metabolic processes and in
  fine plant growth.'
