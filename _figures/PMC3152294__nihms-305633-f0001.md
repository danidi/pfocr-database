caption: 'Notch signaling between adjacent cells functions to diversify cell fate:
  selecting progenitor cells which will maintain pluripotency, and cells which will
  terminally differentiate. In mammals, signaling by the Notch 1–4 transmembrane receptors
  is activated by binding to the Delta-like1–4 and Jagged1,2 ligands, themselves transmembrane
  receptors on neighboring cells. Ligand-receptor binding promotes a series of cleavages,
  first, by the intracellular γ-secretase complex, to produce the Notch intracellular
  domain (NIC), then, by the ADAM metalloproteinase to remove the extracellular domain.
  Cleaved NIC translocates to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor
  together with its DNA-binding co-factor, RBP-J/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1/CBF-1.
  In the absence of Notch signaling RBP-J remains bound to the consensus sites and
  functions as a repressor for Notch target genes. NIC induces expression of the Hes/Hey/Herp
  family of transcriptional repressors which in turn suppress transcription of the
  patterning basic-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Mash1, Math1 and Neurogenin.
  In the prostate, Hey1 functions as a co-factor for the androgen receptor (AR) to
  repress AR targets.'
