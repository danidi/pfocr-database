caption: A proposed mechanistic model to interpret the effects of linagliptin and
  AMD3100 on the growth of immortalized podocytes. (A) DPP4 is highly expressed by
  podocytes and is likely to participate in the SDF‐1‐CXCR4/CXCR7 signalling pathway
  both by mediating the local processing of SDF‐1 and interacting with CXCR4. (B)
  A decrease in podocyte proliferation could result from the interruption of SDF‐1
  signalling, which is altered by both linagliptin and AMD3100, in a DPP4‐dependent
  and DPP4‐independent manner respectively.
