caption: Pharmacological targeting of KLFs in vascular inflammation. There is substantial
  crossover in the mechanisms of drugs targeting the induction/inhibition of KLFs
  in vascular inflammation. Both statins and resveratrol augment KLF2 through MEF2-mediated
  transcription, the same pathway used in statin-mediated KLF4 induction. Rapamycin
  has differential effects on KLF4 and KLF5 expression, eventually stimulating KLF4
  production while inhibiting KLF5. Inhibition of KLF5 is also achieved through use
  of PPARγ agonists (e.g., rosiglitazone). KLF11 is induced through PPAR signaling,
  exhibiting increased expression in response to agonists to both PPARγ and PPARα
  (e.g., fenofibrate). KLF, Krüppel-like factor; MEK5, dual specificity mitogen-activated
  protein kinase5; ERK5, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 5; MEF2, myocyte enhancer
  factor 2; SIRT1, sirtuin 1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PPAR, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor.
