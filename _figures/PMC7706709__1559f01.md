caption: β-Cell ablation triggers clock-dependent β-cell regeneration. In this issue
  of Genes & Development,  administer doxycycline (DOX) to adult transgenic mice,
  triggering diphtheria toxin (DTA) expression within β cells, causing abrupt β-cell
  destruction. This is followed by DOX washout, leading to regeneration from progenitor
  endocrine cells. (Top) RNA profiling across the day/night cycle in DTA-treated mice
  revealed robust rhythms in circadian and regenerative gene networks within a renewing
  β-cell population. (Bottom) Unexpectedly, in DTA-ablated mice that were nullizygous
  for the core clock gene Bmal1, there was abrogation of β-cell regeneration and accumulation
  of glucagon-producing cells within the islet. These observations reveal a requirement
  for the circadian transcription factor pathway in islet regeneration following massive
  β-cell loss.
