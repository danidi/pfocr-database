caption: Exposure of MCF-7 cells to 10 nM E2 (A) and 1 μM G-1 (B) induced phosphorylation
  of proteins involved in cellular processes associated with cell cycle although the
  specific phosphorylation profiles varied. Proteins in red were identified in respective
  treatments while proteins in white were not identified in that exposure group. Proteins
  in gray were not identified in our analysis in any exposure group but were added
  using the shortest path algorithm in Pathway Studio. Cell Processes (gray boxes)
  included in the pathways were limited to those found to be significantly enriched
  by Subnetwork Enrichment Analysis (P < .05). Proteins involved in cell cycle that
  were differentially phosphorylated between the treatments are shown larger for emphasis.
