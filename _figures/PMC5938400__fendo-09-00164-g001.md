caption: Mechanism of action of pharmacologic therapies. Various mechanisms of action
  of medications acting at the corticotroph tumor are represented. Each agent involves
  a different cascade of action resulting in both inhibition of pro-opiomelanocortin
  (POMC) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) synthesis and secretion, and tumoral
  cell proliferation. Pasireotide is a ligand for somatostatin receptor (SSTR) 1,
  2, 3, and 5, activating a G-protein-coupled receptor. Signaling pathways include
  PTPase and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) inhibiting tumorigenesis; and also closure
  of the potassium (K+) voltage channel and activation of the phospholipase C (PLC)
  and inositol triphosphate (IP3) pathway inducing calcium (Ca2+) influx that will
  decrease cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation and ACTH secretion. Cabergoline is a dopamine
  receptor (DR) agonist, binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor activating adenylate
  cyclase, MAPK and K+ efflux. Retinoic acid binds to its nuclear receptor [retinoic
  acid receptor (RAR)] to induce its inhibitory effect. Silibinin induces conformation
  changes at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) level by inhibiting heat shock protein
  90 (HSP90); net effect is an increase sensitivity to circulating corticosteroids
  restoring glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition. Upon ligand binding, epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) induces tyrosine kinase activity with downstream MAPK,
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and PLC signaling pathways. Ubiquitination
  of the internalized receptor targets the EGFR to be degraded in the lysosome. In
  ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8)-mutated tumors, the USP8 mutation increases
  de-ubiquitination thus decreasing EGFR degradation. More EGFR are found at the membrane
  increasing its stimulatory effect, partly mediated by ERK 1/2 pathway. Gefitinib
  effectively blocks EGFR to decrease its activity.
