caption: Information processing by the NF-κB pathway. The NF-κB pathway is able to
  encode information about time-varying stimuli. In this illustration, which depicts
  LPS-induced NF-κB activity in macrophages, we list the factors that influence the
  dynamics of the response in individual cells. These include the core negative feedbacks
  (red dashed lines) and positive feedbacks (green dashed lines). The variability
  in single cell NF-κB dynamics are contributed to by a variety of factors, including
  paracrine signaling, and result in different patterns of gene expression between
  cells. The intrinsic biochemical noise of gene expression will also create variability
  within the responses of individual cells.
