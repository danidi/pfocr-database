caption: Proposed bicyclic and monocyclic carotenoid biosynthesis pathways in P. rhodozyma.
  The starting compound, acetyl-CoA, passes through the mevalonate pathway for synthesis
  of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) as isoprenoid
  precursors. The following bicyclic pathway involves sequential synthesis of, GGPP,
  phytoene, lycopene, and β-carotene by a series of catalytic enzymes encoded respectively
  by crtE, crtYB, and crtI. The recently proposed monocyclic pathway diverges from
  the bicyclic pathway at neurosporene, with HDCO as the primary product, produced
  through β-zeacarotene, γ-carotene, and torulene. Results of the present study suggested
  that CrtS functions in both the bicyclic and monocyclic pathways. Increased levels
  or activity of CrtS allow HDCO to be used as a substrate for further enhancement
  of astaxanthin yield (dashed line at bottom).
