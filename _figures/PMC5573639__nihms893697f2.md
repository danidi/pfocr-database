caption: Key components of the JAK/STAT pathway. In brief, cytokines bind to their
  receptors, and activate JAKs. Activated JAKs then auto- and trans-phosphorylate
  each other, and phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the
  receptor. STATs are then recruited to the receptor complex, phosphorylated by JAKs,
  form dimers, translocate into the nuclei, and then initiate transcription. SOCS
  genes are induced by activated STATs. SOCS proteins inactivate JAK/STAT pathway
  by inhibition of JAK kinase activity and/or promoting degradation of the signaling
  complex.
