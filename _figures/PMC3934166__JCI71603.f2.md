caption: VEGFC/D is commonly produced by tumor cells and by inflammatory cells in
  tumors, and the resulting growth factor gradient induces the sprouting and growth
  of lymphatic vessels toward the tumor. Tumor-derived VEGFC/D also induces dilation,
  SMC remodeling, and increased pulsation of the collecting vessels. These tumor-induced
  processes can be attenuated by antibodies targeting the VEGFC/VEGFD/VEGFR3 signaling
  pathway. TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
