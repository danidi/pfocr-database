caption: Potential mechanisms of conventional allergen immunotherapy. High-dose allergen
  exposure during immunotherapy results in both immune deviation of Th2 responses
  in favor of a Th0/Th1 response and in the generation of IL-10– and TGF-β–producing
  CD4+CD25+ T cells, possibly Tregs. IFN-γ–induced activation of bystander macrophages
  and/or other cells represents an alternative source of these inhibitory cytokines.
  During subsequent natural environmental exposure to allergens, the activation and/or
  maintenance of the usual atopic Th2 T cell response is inhibited. Additionally,
  these cytokines induce preferential switching of B cell responses in favor of IgG
  and IgG4 antibodies (and possibly IgA antibodies under the influence of TGF-β).
  IgG may also inhibit IgE-facilitated allergen binding to antigen-presenting cells
  with subsequent downregulation of IgE-dependent Th2 T lymphocyte responses. Blue
  arrows represent immune response pathway to natural exposure (low-doses Ag and IgE);
  green arrows represent immune response pathway to immunotherapy (high-dose Ag);
  red blocked lines represent inhibition (high-dose Ag); dotted lines represent possible
  means of action not yet proven.
