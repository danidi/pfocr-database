caption: Model for BRAF(V600E)-directed recruitment of MAFG and its corepressors to
  CIMP and HIM gene promoters. Increased BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling results in ERK-directed
  phosphorylation of MAFG. Phosphorylation of MAFG prevents its polyubiquitination
  and subsequent proteasomal-mediated degradation, leading to increased MAFG levels,
  which drives DNA binding. DNA-bound MAFG recruits a corepressor complex that includes
  BACH1, CHD8, and DNMT3B, leading to promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional
  silencing of CIMP and HIM genes.
