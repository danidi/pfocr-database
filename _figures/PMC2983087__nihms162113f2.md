caption: '(A) Induction of a DSB is recognized by the MRN complex, which tethers the
  DNA ends together and participates in end processing. The CtIP–BRCA1–BARD1 complex
  co-operates with the MRN complex to aid in end resection. ssDNA is initially bound
  by the ssDNA-binding protein RPA to keep the ssDNA from forming secondary structures.
  BRCA1/BARD1 promotes accumulation of BRCA2 via PALB2. (B) BRCA2 catalyses the nucleation
  of Rad51 on to the free 5′ end of a dsDNA–ssDNA junction. Once the Rad51 filament
  is assembled it captures duplex DNA and searches for homology. (C) The SDSA model
  predicts that a migrating D loop fails to capture the second DNA end and, following
  extension, the invading strand is displaced and anneals with the resected second
  end. (D) The DSB repair model predicts that the second DNA end is captured by annealing
  to the extended D loop, forming two HJs. (E) The double HJ structure is then resolved
  to yield either crossover or non-crossover products. (F) The SSA pathway: a break
  near one of two direct repeat sequences leads to annealing of complementary strands
  from each repeated sequence. The product of this repair event contains a single
  copy of the repeat with a deletion of the intervening sequences. (G) BIR occurs
  when the 3′ end of the invading strand leads to the formation of a replication fork,
  potentially copying long tracts from the donor DNA molecule. Dotted arrows indicate
  new DNA synthesis.'
