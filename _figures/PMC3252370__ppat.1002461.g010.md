caption: Robo4 and α5β1 integrin are expressed on the surface of lymphatic endothelial
  cells. Under physiologic conditions, endogenous Slit2 interacts with Robo4 via its
  Ig domains, and inhibits c-Src signaling. FN also interacts with Robo4 (via its
  FN type III domains), and binds to α5β1 integrin on the endothelial cell surface.
  This contributes further to the dynamic regulation of Robo4 signaling by Slit2 and
  FN, to maintain the integrity of the lymphatic endothelial barrier. Upon HIV infection,
  gp120 significantly elevates FN levels and complexes with FN. FN then activates
  α5β1 integrin, which results in enhanced intracellular signaling through α5β1 integrin,
  a stronger interaction between FN and Robo4, and disruption of Robo4 signaling.
  These changes activate the c-Src signaling pathway and induce hyperpermeability
  of the lymphatic endothelial barrier. Exogenous Slit2 may protect the lymphatic
  channels from HIV-induced vasculopathy by interacting with Robo4 to restore Robo4
  signaling, block the c-Src pathway, and inhibit HIV-induced lymphatic hyperpermeability.
