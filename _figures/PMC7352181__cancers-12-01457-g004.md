caption: Angiotensin-associated immunoinflammatory pathways in lung tumor microenvironment.
  Extracellular proteins of the RAS, ligands (Ang I, Ang II and Ang 1,7) and enzymes
  (ACE, ACE2 and neprilysin), are represented with distinct colors in the tumor microenvironment.
  The expression and cleavage of ACE and ACE2 are represented in tumor and endothelial
  cells, showing the AT1R signaling-associated activation of ADAM17 that cleaves the
  ectodomain of mACE and mACE2 shedding the enzymes into sACE and sACE2. The Ang II/AT1R-mediated
  direct intracellular signaling is represented with full black arrows as a first
  step after AT1R triggering in the cascade. The subsequent steps of signaling cascades
  are depicted, up to moving towards intranuclear space, using dashed black arrows.
  Intranuclear signaling from these pathways mainly results in transcriptional regulatory
  effects and is represented by full white arrows. The Ang II/AT2R and Ang (1,7)/MasR-mediated
  counter-regulatory mechanisms are depicted using black arrows and when adequate
  the suppressive step is represented by blunt-ended red arrows. In cancer cells,
  upon binding of Ang II to AT1R, a pleiotropic downstream signaling cascade is triggered,
  ultimately causing, either directly or indirectly inflammation immune cells recruitment.
  Activated AT1R triggers potent oxidant signaling through NADPH complex, which is
  involved in inflammation and angiogenesis. Other intracellular cascades mediated
  by Ang II/AT1R include the activation of PLA2/AA/COX-2/PGE2 signaling. The Ang (1,7)/MasR
  activation elicits downstream signaling through PI3K/Akt/NOS3 or NOS1 to produce
  NO that inhibits NFAT transcriptional regulation that reduces inflammation. Notably,
  this pathway blocks the NF-kB molecule formation thereby impacting inflammation.
  In addition, the inhibitory effect over COX-2 significantly impact inflammation.
  Macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts are important components of the tumor
  microenvironment and capable of generating and expressing RAS components. These
  cells, beyond their functional ligands and receptors that are altered in tumor microenvironment,
  and reflect the crosstalk between all cell constituents, also use the RAS signaling
  pathway (mostly AT1, but also MasR in endothelial cells) to yield functional characteristics
  that ultimately may favor the cell itself and enhance tumor growth and aggressiveness.
