caption: . The regulatory action of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) on the
  signaling pathway downstream of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) during vascular
  calcification. Under calcifying conditions, BMP2 binds to type I and II receptors
  and triggers formation of a heteromeric complex. After activation by the type II
  receptors, the type I receptors phosphorylate small mothers against decapentaplegic
  (SMAD) 1/5/8 to propagate the signal into the cell. SMAD1/5/8 form heteromeric complexes
  with SMAD4 and move into the nucleus, where they assemble into transcriptional machinery
  that regulates the expression of osteogenic genes. Under normal conditions, PDK4
  is located in the mitochondrial matrix. However, under calcifying conditions, PDK4
  may be transported into the cytosol and activate SMAD1/5/8 by direct phosphorylation,
  leading to the translocation of phosphorylated SMADs into the nucleus for transcriptional
  regulation of osteogenic genes, thus enhancing BMP2 signaling pathway activity.
