caption: Schematic diagram of the Bcl-w-induced signaling pathway by the activation
  of Sp1. Bcl-w enhanced the invasive potential of glioblastoma U251 cells by stimulating
  MMP-2 via increasing expression of the transcription factor Sp1 in the nucleus,
  and promoted neurosphere formation and glioma stem-like cell markers expression,
  Musashi, Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. In conclusion, Bcl-w promotes the properties of GBM
  aggressiveness by activating Sp1.
