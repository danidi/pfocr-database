caption: Interconnected responsible pathways to cause amyloid and tau accumulation.
  Gene involved in AD pathogenesis can be broadly grouped into 3 categories; immune
  response (CR1, MS4A, TREM2, CD33, EPHA1), cholesterol metabolism (APOE, CLU, ABCA7),
  synaptic function (PICALM, CD2AP, BIN1). The cumulative effect of all these genes
  is manifested through the final common pathway of amyloid and tau cascade.
