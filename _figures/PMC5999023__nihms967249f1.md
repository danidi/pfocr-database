caption: Pathway to frailty. Proinflammatory signals, including IL-6 and TNF-α, increase
  with age, as do markers of activated coagulation, including D-dimer, fibrinogen,
  PAI, and Factor VIII. To the extent that these are primary processes, they may contribute
  to a cycle of physiologic changes that, in composite, are described as “frailty.”
