caption: Signaling pathways altered by MVNP and mutant p62. (A) MVNP increases active
  TBK1, which results in increased activation of NF-κB by direct phosphorylation of
  S536-p65 NF-κB, leading to activation and nuclear translocation. MVNP also decreases
  Sirt1 deacetylation of NF-κB, leading to increased NF-κB activity. Further TBK1
  is required for MVNP to increase TAF12 and phosphoATF7, leading to hypersensitivity
  of VDR to 1,25(OH)2D3. (B) Binding of TNF-α and RANKL to their respective receptors
  activates RIP1 and TRAF6, respectively, by inducing K63-linked ubiquitination. The
  scaffold protein p62 has specific interactions domains for both RIP1 (ZZ domain)
  and TRAF6 (T6 domain), an N-terminal domain that binds aPKCs (PB1 domain) and a
  C-terminal UBA domain that associates with ubiquitin chains. Downstream signaling
  via p62 pathway activation aPKC leading to activation of NF-κB is negatively regulated
  by recruitment of the deubiquitinase Cyld by p62 UBA interaction with the polyubiquitin
  chains on Cyld, and consequent TNF-α and RANKL signal attenuation by Cyld deubiquitination
  of RIP1 and TRAF6, respectively. Since mutant p62 does not associate with and recruit
  Cyld to RIP1 and TRAF6, there is less cytokine signal attenuation and, therefore,
  increased NF-κB activation by these cytokines. MVNP, measles virus nucleocapsid
  protein; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TAF12, TAF12 RNA
  polymerase II, TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factor, 20kDa; VDR, vitamin
  D receptor; 1,25(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α;
  RANKL, receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand; RIP1, receptor-interacting protein
  1; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated factor 6, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; aPKCs,
  atypical protein kinase C; UBA, ubiquitin association; IKK, IκB kinase.
