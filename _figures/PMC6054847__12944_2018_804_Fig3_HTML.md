caption: Effect on eukaryotic translation initiation factors (EIF2) signaling pathway
  in plasma of total mRNAs obtained from δ-tocotrienol treatment of hepatitis C patients.
  EIF2 was down-regulated by δ-tocotrienol treatment, which is involved in protein
  synthesis, requires a large number of polypeptides. EIF2 is a GTP-binding protein,
  which initiates specific form of met-tRNA onto the ribosome

  ubiquitination through multiple-signaling pathways in chronic hepatitis C patients.
