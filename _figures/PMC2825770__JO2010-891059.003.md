caption: CHK1/2 and proteasome inhibition cause defects in the DNA damage repair pathway.
  CHK1 and CHK2 function to arrest the cell cycle when DNA has been damaged, thus
  allowing time to repair the DNA lesions. CHK inhibition leads to continued cell
  cycling in the presence of damaged DNA and is thought to alter the function of the
  DNA repair pathway.
