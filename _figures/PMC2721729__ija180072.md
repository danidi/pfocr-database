caption: Metabolic formation of cysteine. Methionine, an essential amino acid obtained
  through diet, is converted via an enzymatic pathway to the thiol-containing amino
  acid cysteine. This pathway includes the vitamin B6-dependent enzymes cystathionine
  beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). N-acetylcysteine (NAC),
  a cysteine analogue also available in the diet, is deacylated to cysteine primarily
  in the kidneys. Cysteine may be further converted to the ubiquitious antioxidant
  glutathione (GSH) or enzymatically converted into the vasoactive molecule H2S via
  CBS
