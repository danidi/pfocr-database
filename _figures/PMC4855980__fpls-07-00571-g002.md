caption: The schematic representation of major ABA signaling pathway in plants with
  and without ABA presence. The core components in ABA signaling include ABA receptors
  (PYR/PYL/RCAR), PP2C phosphatases (negative regulators), and SnRK2 kinases (positive
  regulators). In the absence of ABA, PP2Cs associate with SnRK2s and prevent the
  activation of SnRK2s. The inactive SnRK2s are unable to phosphorylate downstream
  substrates, and thus signal transduction is not occurring. In the presence of ABA,
  PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors bind to ABA and interact with PP2Cs, which release SnRK2s.
  The SnRK2s are then activated by autophosphorylation of the activation loop. The
  active SnRK2s can phosphorylate downstream substrate proteins, including transcription
  factors, ion channels, and enzymes such as NADPH oxidases, thereby inducing ABA
  responses. SnRK2s are subjected to regulation by other protein kinases. A Raf-like
  kinase (B3-MAPKKK) has been shown to activate SnRK2 through phosphorylating the
  activation loop, whereas casein kinase 2 (CK2) can phosphorylate SnRK2’s carboxyl-terminal
  serine residues, thereby enhancing SnRK2-PP2C interaction and inactivating SnRK2.
  Catalytically active SnRK2 is shown in green and inactive SnRK2 is in red. ABF,
