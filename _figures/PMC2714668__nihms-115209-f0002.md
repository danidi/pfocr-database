caption: Metabolic targeting strategies against malignant tumors that rely on HK-2
  facilitated glycolytic flux. The pyruvate analog 3-Br-pyruvate after entering tumor
  cells inhibits the function of both hexokinase-2 {1} and the ATP synthasome (ATP
  synthase/adenine nucleotide carrier/phosphate carrier complex) {2}. Peptide analogs
  of the HK-2 N-terminal, or small-molecules clotrimazole, bifanazole or methyl jasmonate,
  can dislodge HK-2 from VDAC {1}, depriving HK-2 of direct access to mitochondrial
  generated ATP and negating tolerance to G-6-P mediated product inhibition. Lactate
  efflux by the monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) can be inhibited via small-molecule
  cinnamic acid derivatives, i.e., α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid {3} or silenced
  via siRNA; tumor specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoforms can be silenced via
  siRNA {4}; the pyruvate analog dichloroacetate (DCA) can be administered to inhibit
  mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) {5}, which prevents “inactivation”
  of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). The “active” PDH facilitates a high
  rate of influx of pyruvate into mitochondria, with concomitant up-regulation of
  the TCA cycle, resulting in an altered tumor-mitochondrial redox status; tumor specific
  pyruvate kinase (PK) can be silenced via siRNA to alter the glycolytic flux by inhibiting
  the formation of pyruvate {6}. Each of the above steps, which either target HK-2,
  the first step of the glycolytic pathway, or force the re-direction of pyruvate
  at the ultimate steps of the same, result in a highly disturbed metabolic status
  in the tumor mitochondria. This likely activates disruption of mitochondrial membrane
  integrity and release of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm, which in turn activates
  apoptotic cascades in the targeted tumor cells (MPTP, mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore).
