caption: The receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)/receptor activator
  of nuclear factor-kB (RANK)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) signaling pathway. Denosumab is
  a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL that prevents the binding of RANKL to
  RANK and thereby inhibits bone resorption in a manner similar to native OPG. Adapted
