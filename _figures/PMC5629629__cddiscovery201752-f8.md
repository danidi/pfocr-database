caption: The proposed model of the cell autophagy induced by SAHA and TRAIL DR5-CTSB
  in breast cancer cell lines. TRAIL DR5 was involved in SAHA-induced autophagy with
  up-regulation of CTSB. Activity changes of MAPK and TOR signaling pathway were involved
  in the response to SAHA and TRAIL DR5. As important regulators, ATG4B and LC3-II
  functioned as targets and facilitated the release of engulfed cargo in autophagolysosome.
