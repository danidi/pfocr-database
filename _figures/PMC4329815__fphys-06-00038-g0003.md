caption: Overview of signaling pathways implicated in hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis
  and vacuolization of macropinosome-derived compartments. Known stimuli discussed
  in this review are shown in blue. Dashed lines denote pathways where specific mechanisms
  and intermediates are not yet defined. Some pathways may be operational only in
  certain cell types. The effects of constitutively active Ras and high concentrations
  of METH require activation of Rac1. In addition to altering the amount of active
  Arf6 via GIT-1, sustained activation of Rac1 has the potential to affect multiple
  protein targets known to function in actin remodeling, membrane ruffling and initial
  steps of macropinocytosis (e.g., PAK1, POR1, WAVE2). The effects of NGF in cells
  overexpressing TrkA depend on casein kinase 1 (CK1), but the specific function of
  CK1 in macropinocytosis is obscure. The effects of Vacquinol-1 require MKK4, a downstream
  component of the Rac1-JNK stress signaling pathway. It is not yet clear how MKK4
  functions in macropinosome biogenesis or trafficking. The compounds MIPP and MOMIPP,
  have inverse effects on the activation states of Rab5 (macropinosomes and early
  endosomes) and Rab7 (late endosomes). They probably exert their effects by altering
  vesicular trafficking steps downstream from those regulated by Rac1 and Arf6.
