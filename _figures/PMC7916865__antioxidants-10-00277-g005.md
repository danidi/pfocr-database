caption: 'Mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC) mediated ROS production and
  alternative pathway under abiotic stress. The process, such as photorespiration
  and Krebs cycle, results in the generation of NADH and/or succinate which enters
  mtETC at complex I or complex II, respectively. At complex I, NADH converts into
  NAD+ and H+ with the generation of an electron. At complex II, succinate is changed
  to fumarate with the electron generation. An electron from both complex I and II
  get transferred to UQ from where they move to complex III and then to complex IV
  via Cyt c. The electron at complex I and III reduces O2 to generate ROS (O2•– and
  H2O2), whereas, at complex IV, O2 oxidized to H2O. H+ generates at complex I, III,
  and IV pumped to IMS and then moves to complex V or ATP synthase to form ATP from
  ADP. The mtETC also comprises an alternative pathway consisting of two each NDex
  and NDin with AOX and UCP which limit ROS generation. NDex and NDin function in
  stress conditions and transfer electrons to UQ. The AOX present between UQ and complex
  III accepts an electron from UQ and reduces O2 to H2O, thus terminating the electron
  transport to complex III. OMM: Outer mitochondrial membrane; IMS: Inter-mitochondrial
  space; IMM: Inner mitochondrial membrane; e−: electron; UQ: Ubiquinone; I–V: Complex
  I–V; Cyt c: Cytochrome c; NDex and NDin: NAD(P)H dehydrogenase on the exterior and
  interior side of IMM, respectively; AOX: Alternative oxidase; UCP: Uncoupling protein.'
