caption: The TusA protein is proposed as a central sulfur carrier in the cytoplasm
  and collects sulfur stemming from the oxidation of organic and reduced inorganic
  sulfur compounds like DMS, methanethiol, sulfide or thiosulfate (; ). A complex
  of Hdr-like proteins containing non-cubane [4Fe-4S] clusters (red diamonds) that
  serve as the (hetero)disulfide-reducing active site as well as regular [4Fe-4S]
  clusters (orange boxes) and FAD oxidizes the protein-bound sulfur to sulfite. In
  the course of the reaction two of the four electrons released per reaction cycle
  may serve as reductants for dihydrolipoyl formation on LpbA. Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase
  (indicated here as component E3 of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) then catalyzes
  reoxidation of the cofactor to lipoamide and concomitant reduction of NAD+.
