caption: 'Mitochondria accumulate CoA via voltage-dependent transporters that are
  probably proton-coupled (). CoA can be released in response to PTP openings, either
  directly or more slowly via reverse CoA transport during mitochondrial depolarization.
  During a MEND response the activation of PKCs will restabilize mitochondria and
  promote MEND progression at the cell surface. PTP openings are inhibited when PKCs
  are activated ‘prior’ to the MEND protocol. Acyl CoA transients occur upon release
  of CoA because acyl CoA synthetases are CoA-limited (). We speculate that conventional
  PKCs and ‘transient’ oxidative stress increase the availability of palmitoylation
  sites at the surface membrane, whereas the immediate presence of ROS inhibits palmitoylation
  reactions.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01293.010'
