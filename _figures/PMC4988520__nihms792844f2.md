caption: Activation of p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and its inhibition of the folate
  pathway. a Analogous structures of p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), salicylic acid, sulfonamides
  and p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) illustrated from left to right, respectively. Chemical
  groups highlighted in blue and red indicate variations among the chemicals. b Conversion
  of pABA (left, yellow) and PAS (right, green) using the same enzymes of the de novo
  folate synthesis, in which DHPS and DHFR are targets of sulfonamides and trimethoprim,
  respectively. The activated form of PAS, hydroxy-dihydrofolate that is produced
  following the two chemical conversions catalyzed by DHPS and DHFS adding the pteridine
  and glutamate groups, respectively, is proposed to inhibit the reduction of dihydrofolate
  to tetrahydrofolate catalyzed by DHFR activity. Alternatively, hydroxy-dihydrofolate
  can be further converted to hydroxy-tetrahydrofolate by DHFR and even further to
  other folate species carrying one-carbon groups at position N5 and/or N10, by enzymes
  of the one-carbon metabolic network. One or more of these hydroxyfolate forms may
  then interfere with this very pathway causing growth arrest or even death, for example,
  through inducing thymineless death. DHPS dihydropteroate synthase, DHFS dihydrofolate
  synthase, DHFR dihydrofolate reductase (color figure online)
