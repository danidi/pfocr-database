caption: This figure shows a summary of the individual components of the classical
  and alternative complement pathways (CP), both converge at the C3/C5 step and share
  a common terminal pathway with eventual generation of the cytolytic protein, membrane
  attack complex MAC. The membrane bound complement regulatory proteins (CRP) CRI
  (CD35), DAF decay accelerating factor (CD55), MCP (CD46), CD59 at the sites along
  the pathway where they inhibit C synthesis. The soluble CRP, C inhib, clusterin,
  Factor H (FH), Factor I (FI) are also shown.
