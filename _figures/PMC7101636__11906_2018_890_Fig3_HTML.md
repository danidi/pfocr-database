caption: Classical and counter-regulatory RAS pathways and drug targets. Activation
  of the classical RAS pathway increases BP and target organ damage, and this pathway
  is the target for many currently available antihypertensive drugs, including ACE
  inhibitors and ARBS. Novel approaches to RAS inhibition, including vaccines targeting
  Ang II and the AT1 receptor, are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials.
  In contrast, activation of the more recently described counter-regulatory RAS pathway
  decreases BP and target organ damage, and drugs that activate this pathway are being
  developed as antihypertensive agents. (Reprinted with permission from Circulation
