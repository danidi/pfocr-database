caption: Scheme of the metabolic pathway of purines and their relation to hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase
  (HPRT). In Lesch–Nyhan disease (LND), the lack of HPRT activity leads to a failure
  in recycling of both guanine and hypoxanthine, thus creating a deficiency of both
  inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Hypoxanthine (and
  guanine) concentrations are elevated in LND and will be metabolized to uric acid
  by xanthine oxidase (XO). With S-adenosylmethionine (SAM, depicted in blue), an
  adenosine donor, the lack of purines in LND can be recovered by turning adenosine
  to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and
  then to IMP. ADA adenosine deaminase, ADSL adenylosuccinate lyase, AK adenosine
  kinase, AMPRT amido phosphoribosyltransferase, ATP adenosine triphosphate, GTP guanosine
  triphosphate, IDH isocitrate dehydrogenase, PNP purine nucleoside phosphorylase,
  PPRP phosphoribosylpyrophosphate
