caption: Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family SMAD-dependent signaling. Ligand
  binding induces the formation of a receptor complex containing a type I and type
  II receptors. Type III receptors stabilize and facilitate the binding of TGFβ to
  the receptor complex, which recruits a receptor SMAD (R-SMAD). The R-SMAD is subsequently
  phosphorylated on its C-terminal domain, and a complex is formed with the common
  SMAD4 (co-SMAD4). This complex translocates to the nucleus where it can bind transcription
  factors, like SOX9 and RUNX2, and activates transcription. The activation of SMAD2/3
  signaling results in anti-hypertrophic and anti-inflammatory function, whereas activation
  of SMAD1/5/9 signaling is associated with pro-hypertrophic regulation of the extracellular
  matrix and maturation of the cartilage. Other important target genes are the inhibitory
  SMADs, SMAD6 and SMAD7, whose expression provides the cell with a negative feedback
  mechanism. ACVR2 = Activin type-2 receptor, ALK = ALK tyrosine kinase receptor,
