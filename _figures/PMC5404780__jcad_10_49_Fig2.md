caption: Mechanism of action of various Hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Both vismodegib
  and itraconazole antagonize Smoothened (SMO), but through independent pathways.
  Imiquimod stimulates adenosine receptor (ADORA), which activates the protein kinase
  A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation (P) of the GLI transcription factors. This mechanism
  is autonomous from its action as a TLR7 and TLR8 agonist in the inflammatory pathway.
  Arsenic trioxide inhibits hedgehog signaling by directly inhibiting GLI transcriptional
  activity.
