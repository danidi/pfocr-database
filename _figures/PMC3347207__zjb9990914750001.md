caption: Systems for the uptake of compatible solutes by B. subtilis and the osmoadaptive
  choline-to-glycine betaine biosynthetic pathway. The substrate profiles of the OpuB
  and OpuC ABC transporters shown were compiled from the literature (, ), except those
  for proline betaine and DMSP, whose import systems are assigned based on unpublished
  data from our laboratory (T. Hoffmann, A. Bashir, C. Chen, and E. Bremer, unpublished
  data). The dots and arrows shown within the context of the opuB and gbsAB operons
  and the gbsR gene represent the experimentally mapped promoters (, ). The lollipops
  indicate predicted factor-independent transcriptional terminators.
