caption: Panel A. GSK-3 can phosphorylate and activate TIP60 which is a histone acetyl
  transferase. Activated TIP60 acetylates TP53 which results in its activation. Activation
  of TP53 can result in transcription of miR-34. miR-34 can suppress many genes in
  the Wnt/beta-signaling and other signaling pathways. One consequence of inhibition
  of Axin2 is that GSK-3 may be active. Active GSK-3 can phosphorylate Snail which
  leads to its inactivation. These events can lead to decreased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling,
  EMT, invasion and metastasis. Panel B. Effects of demethylation of the miR-34 promoter
  region by either 5AzaC or SAHA on miR-34 expression and the regulation of gene involved
  in cell proliferation, self-renewal, invasion, EMT, E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression.
  In addition, miR-34 expression can induce TP53 expression which can influence genes
  involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis such as p21Cip-1, p27Kip-1 and Puma.
  This figure is presented to provide the reader an idea of some of the mechanisms
  that TP53 and miR-34 play on regulation of genes involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
  and EMT and how the TP53 protein may be regulated by GSK-3-induced TIP60 acetylation.
  Furthermore, the promoter region of the miR-34 gene is regulated by methylation
  that may be altered by 5AzaC or SAHA treatment.
