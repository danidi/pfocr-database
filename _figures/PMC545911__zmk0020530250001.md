caption: Phosphoinositide kinase specific genetic interactions. (A) Schematic of genes
  identified by SGA involved in membrane trafficking with known genetic interactions
  (synthetic sick or lethal). (B) Genetic interactions of four trafficking genes obtained
  from SGA (drs2Δ, ypt31Δ, kre11Δ, and trs33Δ) were analyzed in pik1-139ts, pik1–83ts,
  stt4ts, and mss4ts. Tetrads were isolated at 26°C and the growth of the double mutants
  was assessed at 26°C. +/-; reduced growth, ++; similar to growth of single mutants.
  Temperature at which lethality is observed is given in parentheses.
