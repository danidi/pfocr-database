caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating the role of proteins encoded DEGs and DASGs
  and others on AMPA-receptor signaling and synaptic plasticity. mRNA expression of
  NSF-attachment protein alpha (Napa), pentraxin 1 (Nptx1, NP1), synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7),
  neurogranin (Nrgn, Ng), Slc8a2, and Camk2b was higher in the HP group (corresponding
  to the proteins highlighted in red). The HP group also has an increased flip/flop
  transcript ratio of subunits Glur1 and Glur2. The flip isoform renders AMPA receptors
  less prone to desensitization as compared to the flop isoform, but AMPA receptor
  affinity for glutamate remains unchanged,. Fast, excitatory synaptic transmission in
  the brain is primarily mediated by two types of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors:
  AMPA and NMDA receptors. Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors activates intracellular
  signaling cascades including calmodulin (CaM) and CaMK2 signaling. Ng concentrates
  CaM to participate in postsynaptic signaling processes,. Ng phosphorylation by PKC
  disrupts its binding to CaM, thereby leading to the activation of the CaMK2β signaling
  pathway and induction of LTP. CaMK2β potentiates ion channel function of AMPA receptor
  via direct phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunits. Another kinase, PKA, phosphorylates
  the C-terminal domain of AMPA receptor subunits and thus controls synaptic trafficking
  that underlies plasticity. Syt7 is essential specifically for Ca2+-induced AMPA
  receptor recruitment during LTP and contributes to the rapid decrease of cytoplasmic
  Ca2+ levels back to baseline after neuronal activation, thereby contributing to
  the modulation of synaptic plasticity. NP1 drives the clustering of AMPA receptors
  at the postsynaptic membrane, promotes excitatory synaptogenesis, and mediates synaptic
  recruitment of AMPA receptor,. Thus, phosphorylation of AMPA receptor mediated by
  CaMK2β as well as an increased level of Napa, Nptx1, and Syt7 and the increased
  flip/flop isoform ratio of GluR1 and GluR2 during LTP potentiate ion channel function,
  cause desensitization, and increase the levels of synaptic AMPA receptors.'
