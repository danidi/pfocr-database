caption: Working model for the differential regulation of the SNAT2 gene  in HepG2
  cells during activation of the AAR or UPR pathways. A,  SNAT2-driven transcription
  is induced by either AAR or UPR from a  plasmid-based luciferase reporter that contains
  the SNAT2 promoter  and C/EBP-ATF site. In contrast, SNAT2 transcription from the  endogenous
  gene is induced only by the AAR, but not by the UPR pathway.  B, AAR pathway triggers
  assembly of the ATF4 enhanceosome, increased  H3 acetylation, and preinitiation
  complex (PIC) formation, events  that lead to enhanced SNAT2 transcription activity.
  Conversely,  despite the assembly of the ATF4 enhanceosome, the UPR represses  SNAT2
  transcription.
