caption: Proposed model of PIP2 and CapZ mechanotransduction in cardiac myocytes.
  Diagram of the proposed model for the mechanism of PIP2 association with CapZ because
  of mechanical stimuli. Mechanical strain activates the ROCK pathway when there is
  an increase in mechanosensitive FAK activation, which results in PIP5K phosphorylating
  PI4P into PIP2. PIP2 phosphorylates CapZ, which mediates its uncapping from α-actin.
  This results in pathological actin filament remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy.
  PIP2 is highlighted in and colored red. CapZα1 and CapZβ1 are colored blue to represent
  their association with PIP2 as well as their intricacy with biomechanically sensitive
  actin filament remodeling and pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
