caption: Crosstalk of the coagulation cascade and autophagy pathway in cancer cells.
  The activation of PAR1 and PAR2 by coagulation factors suppresses the autophagic
  pathway in an mTORC1-dependent manner. mTORC1 upregulates HIF1-α and miR135, both
  implicated in cancer and in autophagy regulation. PAR1 activation leads to Cx-43
  up-regulation, which may impair autophagy by sequestering ATG16L and the PI3KC3
  complex to the membrane. In turn, the autophagic pathway mediates PAR1 degradation.
  Additionally, PAR4 selective stimulation downregulates proteins associated with
  chaperone-mediated autophagy. Therefore, autophagy suppression by PARs activation
  leads to increased pro-inflammatory microenvironment and enhanced cancer progression
  and metastasis. Moreover, the autophagy secretory pathway participates in TRAPs
  release, which suppress anti-tumor immune response and thereby facilitate tumor
  progression. See the text for additional information. Cx-43, Connexin 43; EMT, Epithelial
