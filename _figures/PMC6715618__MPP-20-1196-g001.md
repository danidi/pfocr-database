caption: Activation of the NIK1‐mediated antiviral signalling and antiviral PTI. The
  viral single‐stranded DNA from begomoviruses replicates via double‐stranded DNA
  intermediates that are transcribed in the nucleus of infected plant cells (1). NSP
  binds to the nascent viral DNA and facilitates its movement to the cytoplasm via
  nuclear pores (2). At the cytosolic side, the NSP‐interacting GTPase (NIG) helps
  the release of NSP‐viral DNA complex from the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm (3)
  and then moves the viral DNA complex towards the cell periphery. MP associates with
  the endosomal synaptotagmin A (SYTA) and may interact directly with the NSP–viral
  DNA complex to move the viral DNA to plasmodesmata via an endocytic recyclizing
  pathway for the MP‐assisted cell‐to‐cell spread (4). In incompatible interactions,
  plant cells may elicit the translational control branch of the NIK1‐mediated antiviral
  signalling as an innate defence against DNA viruses (5). The mechanism of NIK1 transmembrane
  receptor activation is unknown, but we showed here that both RNA and DNA from infected
  plants activate the NIK1‐mediated antiviral signalling (6). As plant viruses depend
  on the insect‐vector‐induced mechanical injury for entry into the plant cells, endogenous
  DAMPs induced during infection may also activate the antiviral innate immune system
  (7). Upon activation, NIK1/NIK2 mediates the phosphorylation of RPL10 and subsequent
  translocation to the nucleus, where it interacts with LIMYB to fully repress the
  expression of translational machinery‐related genes [ribosome protein (RP) genes
  for instance] (8). Prolonged down‐regulation of translation‐related genes leads
  to global translation suppression, which also impairs viral mRNA (vmRNA) translation
  (9). In begomovirus–host compatible interactions, NSP binds to NIK1 and suppresses
  its activity, creating a favourable environment for virus infection (10). In the
  case of RNA and DNA viruses, replication and expression of viral genomes lead to
  the accumulation of non‐self DNA or RNA motifs (virus‐derived PAMPs, dsRNA, RNA
  and DNA), which may be recognized by PRRs that in turn heteromultimerize with co‐receptors
  (BAK1 or SERK1) to trigger antiviral PTI (11), which may also be activated by endogenous
  DAMPs (7). In any case, in RNA or DNA viruses, a successful infection implicates
  in the accumulation of viral effectors (e.g. CP from PPV and NSP from begomoviruses)
  to suppress PTI, leading to disease (12). In resistant genotypes, however, the resistance
  (R) proteins specifically recognize, directly or indirectly, the viral effectors,
  called avirulence (Avr) factors, activating ETI and conferring resistance (13).
