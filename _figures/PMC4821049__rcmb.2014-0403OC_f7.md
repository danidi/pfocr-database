caption: The role of MIF in CS-induced activation of the ASK1–p38–XOR pathway. Acute
  CS exposure resulted in increased MIF expression (Figure E1) (, ). This functions,
  in part, to antagonize CS-induced ASK1–p38–XOR activation and resulting ROS, p53
  expression, and EndoC apoptosis. Chronic CS is associated with loss of MIF (, ).
  Activation of XOR, p38, and ASK1 are also increased in human and murine CS-induced
  lung disease, as we show here and as others have shown previously (, , ). When MIF
  is lost, we postulate that the ASK1–p38–XOR pathway is hyperactivated, resulting
  in increased EndoC apoptosis and emphysematous tissue destruction. ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated kinase.
