caption: Possible mechanisms by which TRPV4 activation caused oligodendrocyte apoptosis
  and demyelination. TRPV4 activation induced by CPZ or LPS increases Ca2+ influx
  and glial activation, which promotes the release of TNF-α and IL-1β by activating
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. The production of proinflammatory cytokines results
  in oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination. The TRPV4 inhibitor RN-1734 inhibits
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, decreases the level of proinflammatory cytokines and
  rescues oligodendrocyte damage and demyelination.
