caption: In AVICs of stenotic valves, stimulation of TLR4 with LPS induces enhanced
  activation of Notch1, and augmented phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NF-κB. Notch1
  modulates ERK1/2 and NF-κB activity through its intracellular domain NICD1. Both
  the ERK1/2 and NF-κB pathways are involved in up-regulating the expression of pro-osteogenic
  proteins. It appears that the ERK1/2 pathway up-regulates the pro-osteogenic response
  in human AVICs primarily through modulation of NF-κB activation.
