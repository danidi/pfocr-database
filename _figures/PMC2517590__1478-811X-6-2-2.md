caption: 'Schematic overview of the integrin signaling. (A) Signaling pathways downstream
  of FAK and Src controlling actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and FAs. Integrin activation
  induces recruitment and stimulation of FAK and Src, which target RhoA or Rac1 and
  Cdc42 GTPases, thereby controlling cell migration and elongation via regulation
  of the actin cytoskeleton. The elongated cell morphology might also be caused by
  deregulated FAs. (B) Detailed mechanism of CagL-induced integrin signaling leading
  to cell elongation and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. FAK and Src are
  activated via integrin-CagL (L) interaction leading to the injection of the pathogenic
  factor CagA. CagA is initially phosphorylated by Src, which then interacts with
  Shp-2 and Csk to inactivate FAK and Src at later time points. Inactivation of Src
  leads to the dephosphorylation of ezrin, vinculin and cortactin, while CagA tyrosine
  phosphorylation is maintained by activated Abl kinases. These processes contribute
  to the deregulation of FA disassembly leading to host cell elongation. In parallel,
  FAK and Src control the actin cytoskeleton via the CrkII/DOCK180/Rac1/WAVE/Arp2/3
  pathway, which affects cell migration. This pathway is controlled by Abl kinases,
  paxillin or p130Cas. Red arrowheads:H. pylori-associated signaling pathways; black
