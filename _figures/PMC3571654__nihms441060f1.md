caption: shows the effects of osteoblast-secreted osteocalcin on glucose homeostasis
  and its novel role in regulating testosterone production in the leydig cells. In
  stage 1, activation of insulin receptor can negatively regulate the expression of
  ESP (FoxO1 and AFT4 can regulate its transcription). Insulin signaling can also
  inhibit OPG (osteoprotegerin), a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis. Osteocalcin,
  once activated (), can act on the pancreas () (GPCR6A?) and the testes through the
  GPCR6A receptor, which activates the CREB signaling pathway leading to an increase
  in testosterone production through transcriptional upregulation of the various enzymes
  involved in its biosynthetic pathway (). OCN osteocalcin, ESP osteo-testicular protein
  tyrosine phosphatase, OPG (osteoprotegerin), TCPTP1 (T-Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase),
  GPCR6A (member of family C, G protein coupled receptor), StAR (steroidogenic acute
  regulatory protein), CYP11a1(cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme), CYP17(cytochrome
  P450 17a)
