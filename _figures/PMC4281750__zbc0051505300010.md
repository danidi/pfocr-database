caption: Model for the role of FAT conformational dynamics in FAK function at focal
  adhesions. The FAT four-helix bundle exists in closed (1) and open (2) conformations
  in a dynamic equilibrium that is strongly shifted toward the closed state. By decreasing
  or increasing the propensity of the H1-H2 hinge to open, R-FAK and T-FAK mutants
  favor the closed and open FAT domain conformation, respectively. The scheme depicts
  the proposed role of these forms in FAK function at FAs. 1, the closed conformation
  of FAT has a strong affinity for paxillin LD motifs (two binding sites in FAT) and
  FAK can be strongly recruited to FAs through this interaction. However, in this
  configuration, Tyr925 is buried in the four-helix bundle. Ser910 and Tyr861 are
  also poorly accessible, possibly because of their masking by intramolecular interactions.
  FAT may also interact with FERM () (not shown in the scheme). 2, local accumulation
  of FAK at FAs promotes FAK dimerization through FERM-FERM interactions () (only
  the FERM domain of the second FAK molecule is drawn in dark gray). Possibly with
  the help of co-activators, the association between FERM and kinase domains in the
  dimer is loosened, which promotes autophosphorylation by intermolecular transphosphorylation
  of Tyr397. The Src homology 3 and 2 domains of SFK bind to a proline-rich motif
  1 region and Tyr(P)397, respectively, in the FERM:kinase linker peptide. Either
  spontaneously (in a stochastic manner) or in response to unknown factors, H1 dissociates
  from the rest of the bundle. In the open conformation of FAT, the affinity of paxillin
  for the H1/H4 binding site on FAT is completely lost. Opening of FAT H1 is also
  expected to alter the stability and disposition of the other three helices, compromising
  paxillin binding to the H2/H3 site (, ); Tyr925 is exposed and can be phosphorylated
  by SFKs and then bind Grb2, which activates the ERK pathway. Through unfolding and/or
  unmasking of the linker region between FAT and the kinase domain, Ser910 and Tyr861
  become exposed and accessible to ERK and SFKs, respectively. Together with the loss
  of paxillin affinity, phosphorylation of the above sites contributes to detachment
  of FAK from FAs for degradation or recycling.
