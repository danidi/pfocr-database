caption: A, scheme of the citric acid cycle and lipogenesis via ATP-citrate lyase.
  The scheme emphasizes (i) the reversibility of the conversion of citrate to isocitrate
  (ICIT) and α-ketoglutarate via aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) and
  (ii) the set of reactions by which carbons 4 and 5 of glutamine are used for fatty
  acid (FA) and sterol synthesis in some mammalian cells (red arrows). B, scheme of
  the catabolism of 4-hydroxy acids with at least five carbons using 4-hydroxy[3,4-13C2]nonanoate
  as an example (modified from Ref. ). Carbons 3 and 4 of the substrate are colored
  red and green, respectively, to facilitate the tracing of their fates through pathways
  A and B. Pathway A includes 4-phosphononanoyl-CoA. Note that the doubly labeled
  substrate forms acetyl-CoA, part of which is doubly labeled (M2) via pathway A and
  singly labeled (M1) via pathway B. Formate, derived from carbon 3 of the substrate,
  is formed via pathway B.
