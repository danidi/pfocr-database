caption: 'Schematic representation of the primary mechanisms through which vitamin
  D-regulated dendritic cells (DCs) and T-lymphocyte function.Notes: vitamin D precursors
  can be further processed to their active metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D3, in DCs and T lymphocytes.
  In DCs, 1,25(OH)2D3 binds to the vitamin D receptor–retinoid X receptor (VDR/RXR)
  complex in the nucleus, leading to a tolerogenic DC phenotype, characterized by
  decreased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II, CD40, CD80, CD86,
  enhanced expression of immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT)-3, and increased secretion
  of interleukin (IL)-10 and CCL22, which results in the induction of T-regulatory
  (Treg) cells. The 1,25(OH)2D3signaling in T-cells is dependent on the stimulation
  of T-cell antigen-receptor (TCR) signaling. VDR expression can be induced by TCR
  signaling via the alternative p38 MAPK pathway. 1,25(OH)2D3 binds to VDR, leading
  to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine expression, including interferon (IFN)-γ,
  IL-17, and IL-21, and promotion of the development of Treg cells.Abbreviations:
  CCL22, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 22; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.'
