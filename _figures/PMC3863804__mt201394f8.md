caption: Proposed model for two mechanisms of T-cell deletion—intrinsic cell death
  and AICD—in limiting the accumulation of transgene responsive T cells in the liver
  following AAV2/8 gene transfer. In the secondary lymphoid organs, AAV2/8 transgene-reactive
  T cells undergo intrinsic cell death in response to IL-2 deprivation. T cells that
  escape this pathway upregulate Fas and infiltrate the liver. (a) In response to
  FasL-expressing AAV2/8-transduced hepatocytes and reactivation with transgene antigen,
  the T cells undergo AICD. (b) In the absence of intrinsic cell death and AICD, T
  cells are amplified, accumulate in the liver, and induce a non-cytolytic suppression
  of vector transgene expression.
