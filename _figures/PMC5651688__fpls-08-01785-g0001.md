caption: A schematic representation of carbon metabolism in developing apple fruit.
  Sorbitol and sucrose are transported from the leaves to the fruit and unloaded in
  the cell wall space between sieve element-companion cell complexes (SE-CC) and parenchyma
  cells. Sorbitol is transported from the cell wall space into cells by sorbitol transporters
  (SOT). Sucrose is either directly transported into cells by sucrose transporters
  (SUT), or is converted into fructose and glucose in the cell wall space by cell
  wall bound invertase (CWI) before being transported into the cells by hexose transporters
  (HT). Metabolic pathways are described considering carbon metabolism in developing
  apple fruit and using the labeling of intermediates described in the text and information
  in the literature. Metabolites presented in gray text are those whose 13C-labeling
  could not be reliably quantified in this study. αKG, α-ketoglutarate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; Fru, fructose; G1P, Glucose 1-phosphate; G6P, Glucose
