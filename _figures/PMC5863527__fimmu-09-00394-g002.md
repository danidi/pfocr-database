caption: 'Applied strategies to leverage DC immunopotency by interfering PD-1/PD-L
  signaling. DC and tumor cell PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 expression exerts direct inhibitory
  effects (−, red arrows) on CD8+ T cells and NK cells, while promoting (+, green
  arrows) regulatory T cell functions. Current strategies to increase the immunogenicity
  of DC vaccines by interfering the PD-1/PD-L signaling axis include combined systemic
  blockade by means of PD-L1-blocking moieties. Chemotherapy triggers different mechanisms
  that can promote DC vaccine efficacy, including the induction of immunogenic cell
  death favorable for DC activation. Exploiting the PD-1 pathway, platinum-based chemotherapeutics
  have been demonstrated to lower PD-L expression on DCs while increasing tumor cell
  PD-L expression, sensitizing the tumor for systemic blockade approaches. In situ
  engineering of DC vaccines by silencing PD-L with the small molecule dorsomorphin
  or RNAi constructs was demonstrated to successfully improve the immunopotency of
  DC vaccines. Abbreviations: DC, dendritic cell; ICD, immunogenic cell death; NK,
  natural killer cell; PD-1, programmed death-1; PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand
  1; PD-L2, programmed cell death ligand 2; RNAi, RNA interference; sPD-1, soluble
  PD-1; sPD-L1, soluble PD-L1; Treg, regulatory T cell.'
