caption: 'Alternate use of B2R and B1R in cardioprotection in non-diabetic and diabetic
  mice, respectively, during cardiac ischemia-reperfusion. B1R ago: pharmacological
  B1R agonist; B2R ago: pharmacological B2R agonist. G: G proteins; pAkT: phosphoinositide
  3 kinase/Akt; pERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2; pGSK3b: glycogen
  synthase-kinase3; p is for phosphorylated forms of the enzymes. Note that B1R but
  not B2R synthesis increases more than three times in the diabetic heart. Infarct
  size-reducing effect is associated with activation of the so-called “Reperfusion
  Ischemia Salvage Kinase (RISK)” pathway and inhibition of GSK-3β. Based on data
  presented in [].'
