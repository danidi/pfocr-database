caption: 'An integrated model for ROS mediated clearance of VAP(P58S) aggregates via
  UPS. (A) Model depicting novel relationships of SOD1- and mTOR-induced ROS with
  VAP and VAP(P58S) aggregates. Clearance of VAP(P58S) protein/aggregates appears
  to be primarily via the UPS, triggered by ROS, which are, in turn, regulated by
  cellular pathways such as the mTOR pathway, SOD1 and VAP activity. Autophagy does
  not appear to be a major contributor to aggregate clearance, under the conditions
  of our experiment. (B) A hypothetical model proposing the possible link between
  VAP, ROS and UPS. VAP could regulate the UPS via the ERAD pathway due to its interaction
  with VCP via dFAF1/Caspar. ROS could be the connecting link between the mTOR pathway
  and ERK pathway, which together regulate the components of the proteasomal machinery.
  The link between VAP and ROS that we have demonstrated could modulate proteasomal
  activity in the cell. Gray italic text, gene; gray upper-case non-italic text, proteins;
