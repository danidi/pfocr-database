caption: 'General mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab: presence of upregulation
  of HER2 downstream signaling pathways. PTEN is a tumor suppressor. Trastuzumab binding
  stabilizes and activates PTEN and consequently down-regulates the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway (). When PTEN function is lost, PI3K remains constitutively active regardless
  of binding of trastuzumab to HER2. PTEN loss correlates with clinical unresponsiveness
  to trastuzumab treatment. Genomic aberrations in the PI3K pathway are a common event
  in a variety of cancer types (). Multiple components of this pathway are affected
  by germline or somatic mutation, amplification, rearrangement, methylation, overexpression,
  and aberrant splicing, but only in a few instances PIK3CA and PTEN mutations are
  seen simultaneously (). Genomic aberrations in the PI3K pathway produce constitutive
  activation of the pathway, which will signal downstream to the nucleus regardless
  of trastuzumab binding to HER2. This is the case with activating mutations of PIK3R1
  and PIK3CA, encoding genes for PI3K p85α and p110α, respectively. Increased Akt
  kinase activity and PDPK1 overexpression have also been implicated with trastuzumab
  resistance.'
