caption: Schematic diagram showing the mechanism by which uPA/uPAR shRNA inhibits
  angiogenesis in glioblastoma cells and xenografts. Panel (A) Binding of uPA to uPAR
  co‐ordinates with GM‐CSF receptor to activate JAK2/STAT5 mediated angiogenic signaling
  pathway. VEGF/VEGFR signaling is also well known to initiate angiogenesis. Panel
  (B) Knockdown of uPA and uPAR inhibits the angiogenesis signaling induced by both
  GM‐CSF and VEGF. uPA/uPAR down regulation decreased GM‐CSF secretion resulting in
  inhibition of JAK2/STAT5 activation. Further knock down of uPA/uPAR increased sVEGFR1
  secretion which binds to free bound VEGF and acts as a scavenger inhibiting VEGF‐mediated
  signaling. sVEGFR1 secretion was mediated by TIMP‐1 and ectodomain shedding of VEGFR1
  regulated by phosphorylation at the Tyr1213 of the VEGFR1 receptor.
