caption: Proposed model for the role of ZmbZIP4 in maize root development and stress
  response. ABA could be induced by abiotic stress and then regulate the stress response
  via the core signaling pathway, which includes the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor, PP2C proteins,
  SnRK2 family members, AREB/ABF transcription factors, and downstream regulated genes;
  ZmbZIP4 belonged to the transcription factor of the AREB/ABF subfamily. ZmbZIP4
  could bind directly to the promoters of several genes that participated in ABA biosynthesis,
  which led to the ABA accumulation. Furthermore, ZmbZIP4 also could directly regulate
  some stress-related genes, transcription factors, and the Na+/H+ antiporter NHX3
  to increase stress resistance. In addition, ZmbZIP4 also could target to the promoters
  of SCR, LRP1, and several auxin response genes to promote maize root development.
  Blue font indicates the genes targeted directly by ZmbZIP4.
