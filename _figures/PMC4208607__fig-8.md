caption: 'Proposed mechanism for statin-mediated cardioprotection. Statins are able
  to afford cardioprotection through an unknown mechanism beyond their ability to
  lower circulating levels of plasma cholesterol. Our findings elucidate this pathway
  and provide evidence for the first time that statin-mediated cardioprotection involves
  triggering mitophagy in the heart. Here we propose a mechanism by which statins
  promote cardiac mitophagy, which is essential for its protective effect: (1) Depletion
  of mevalonate (via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase) attenuates Akt/mTOR signaling.
  (2) Diminished Akt/mTOR signaling relieves the inhibition of ULK1 resulting in increased
  macroautophagy. (3) Depletion of mevalonate results in loss of coenzyme Q10, thereby
  impairing the ability of mitochondria to maintain their membrane potential. Autophagy
  targeting machinery is recruited to depolarized mitochondria. This mitophagy machinery
  includes (but is not limited to) Parkin and p62/SQSTM1. These elements of statin
  treatment set the stage for promoting mitophagy in the heart. (4) Increased mitophagy
  confers cardioprotection against I/R injury. HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  coenzyme A; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion.'
