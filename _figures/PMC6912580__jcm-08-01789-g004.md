caption: 'QC prevents oxidative stress leading to damage by activating the Nrf2 pathway.
  QC-mediated Nrf2 activation leads to transcriptional activation of antioxidant response
  elements. This activation results in prevention against oxidative damage and ultimately
  leads to amelioration of cognitive impairment. Keap1: Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1; Nrf2-ARE: Nuclear factor erythroid 2.'
