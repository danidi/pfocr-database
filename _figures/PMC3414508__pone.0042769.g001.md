caption: The biosynthetic pathway of UDP-GlcNAc in prokaryotes and eukaryotes were
  different. In prokaryotes, UDP-GlcNAc was biosynthesized through reactions (1),
  (2), (3) and (6); In eukaryotes, UDP-GlcNAc was formed through reactions (1), (4),
  (5) and (6). The reactions catalyzed by phosphoglucosamine mutase (GlmM) and glucosamine-1-phosphate
  acetyl transferase (GlmU) were unique to prokaryotes.
