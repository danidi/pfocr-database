caption: Model of a HH/Gli-Foxf1-Wnt signaling network controlling Sox9+ chondrogenesis.
  HH/Gli signals from the epithelium (yellow) result in more Gli2/3 activator (GliA)
  than Gli repressor (GliR). Activated Gli2/3 directly stimulates Foxf1 expression,
  which in turn supports growth and survival of the tracheal mesoderm (pink). Foxf1
  and Gli transcription factors cooperate to directly promote Sox9 transcription.
  In addition, Gli and Foxf1 promote the expression of a number of Wnt pathway components
  in the mesenchyme, including Rspo2, Wnt4, Wnt11 and Notum, which act in concert
  with epithelial Wnt7b and Wls to further enhance and maintain Sox9 expression. Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling in the ventral tracheal mesoderm is essential for tracheal chondrogenesis.
  Notum, another direct Gli and Foxf1 target, attenuates Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
  possibly to regulate chondrocyte maturation. In the dorsal tracheal mesenchyme (green),
  which is thought to have lower Wnt and BMP signaling, Gli-Foxf1 does not activate
  Sox9+ chondrogenesis, and the tissue adopts a smooth muscle fate.
