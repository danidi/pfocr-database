caption: The C. elegans insulin–IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) like signal-transduction
  pathway is shown on the left, and human homologues of the proteins that are involved
  are shown on the right. This pathway involves a cascade of phosphorylation events
  that ultimately regulate the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 (REF. ). INS-N is an
  unknown insulin-like peptide, and DAF-2 is its cell-surface receptor, which has
  tyrosine kinase activity. AGE-1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).
  IP3 is phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (for simplicity, it is shown here
  as part of the pathway, although it is actually a membrane component), which is
  produced as a result of AGE-1 activity and activates PDK-1. PTEN is a phosphatase
  with IP3 substrate activity and suppresses AGE-1. PDK-1 is an IP3-dependent kinase
  that activates AKT-1, AKT-2 and SGK-1, which are serine/threonine kinases. DAF-16
  is a forkhead class transcription factor that is homologous to the FOXO class of
  human transcription factors, and is probably orthologous to human FOXO3A. The target
  of rapamycin (TOR), JNK and RAS pathways also feed into the insulin-like signalling
  pathway at the level of DAF-16 regulation. TOR is a kinase that responds to intracellular
  amino acids, especially leucine, among other activities; RAS and JNK are involved
  in numerous signal-transduction cascades in mammals. Numerous other genes in which
  mutations lead to life extension in C. elegans (for example, sir-2 and mitochondrial
  genes) are not shown.
