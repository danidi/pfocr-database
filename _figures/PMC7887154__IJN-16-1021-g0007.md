caption: Schematic representation of the role and activation mechanism of TAZ in hierarchical
  microgroove/nanopore topography regulating stem cell differentiation. Hierarchal
  microgroove/nanopore topography could promote the polymerization of actin cytoskeleton
  and activation of ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which were essential for TAZ
  activation. Enhanced transcriptional activity and nuclear localization of TAZ could
  accelerate osteogenesis and impair adipogenesis.
