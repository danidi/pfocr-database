caption: '(a) Schematic representation of the differences between normal endothelial
  cells (ECs) and tumour-derived endothelial cells (TECs) in terms of Ca2+-related
  intracellular signalling pathways. Arachidonic acid (AA), nitric oxide (NO) and
  hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-promoted Ca2+i signals are significantly upregulated in TEC
  compared with EC. These differences are at least in part due to TRPV4 overexpression
  and consequent TEC migration. (b) Scheme of the signal transduction pathway involved
  in proangiogenic Ca2+ signals in TEC: (1) AA-mediated actin-remodelling promotes
  TRPV4 vesicles to traffic and insert in the plasma membrane; as a consequence, more
  functional channels allow Ca2+ entry required for TEC migration. (2) Activation
  of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) mediated by AA-mediated protein kinase A (PKA)
  promotes NO release and consequent Ca2+ entry via unknown channels. (3) VEGF promotes
  promigratory Ca2+ signals mediated by H2S via cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE).'
