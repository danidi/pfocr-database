caption: 'Proteins putatively involved in glycerol production and glycolysis had significantly
  different abundance levels between groups (Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U-tests,
  p≤0.05) leading us to suggest this pathway for glycerol synthesis in Nasonia (enzymes
  in red). Enzymes in blue were detected at higher levels in diapausing stages but
  did not pass all criteria for quantification. GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase,
  GADH: glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PGM: phosphoglucomutase.'
