caption: Involvement of growth factor-regulated Erk in cell motility. Several signaling
  pathways underlie regulation of cellular movement by growth factors and cytokines.
  The Erk pathway controls transcription of multiple proteins, which engage in cell
  motility upon their synthesis and re-folding. In advance, Erk regulates pre-existing
  proteins that modulate the actin cytoskeleton. The scheme represents this aspect
  of Erk's action. A major target of Erk is the focal adhesion site, a junction of
  extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. Integrin, a major
  receptor of ECM proteins, engages several adaptors (e.g., Paxillin) and actin-binding
  proteins (e.g., Talin, and Tensin) just beneath the plasma membrane. Upon activation,
  Erk phosphorylates (thereby activates) an intracellular protease, Caplain, that
  disintegrates focal adhesion sites located at the rear part of migrating cells.
  Simultaneously, Erk phosphorylates the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which stimulates
  the ability of myosin light and heavy chains to polymerize actin at cellular extensions
  protruding from the front part of migrating cells. Erk itself translocates from
  endosomes to adhesion complexes, where it promotes recruitment of the focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK) and a GTP-binding protein, Rac.
