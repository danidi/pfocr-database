caption: 'Proposed model of SEEP-SRB1 metabolism in AOM consortia. All identified
  SRB from AOM consortia contained the canonical sulfate reduction pathway: sulfate
  adenylyltransferase (Sat), adenylyl-sulfate reductase (Apr), dissimilatory sulfite
  reductase (DsrAB), and the membrane-associated complexes Qmo and DsrMKJOP. The DsrC
  protein acts as a key intermediate for transferring electrons from DsrAB to other
  redox-active complexes, including the DsrMKJOP and Tmc membrane complexes and the
  soluble Flx-Hdr complex. Electrons required to reduce the Qrc or Tmc membrane complexes
  are proposed to be sourced from direct extracellular electron transfer from the
  ANME archaeon cell mediated by outer membrane c-type cytochromes. All genomes fix
  carbon using the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and contain a complete tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle, a pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP)
  pathway for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.'
