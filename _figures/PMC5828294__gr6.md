caption: Schematic of the metabolic changes in the liver of fed and fasted HrasG12S/+
  mice.(a and b) Changes in gene expression in the liver of HrasG12S/+ mice under
  fed (a) and fasted (b) conditions. Upregulated or activated proteins and genes are
  shown in red. Decreased gene expression is shown in blue. (a) In the fed condition,
  the pentose phosphate pathway is activated due to an increase in G6pd gene expression.
  A decrease in Pdha gene expression inhibits the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.
  Low Glud1 and Got2 gene expression results in a decrease in alpha-ketoglutaric acid.
  In the fatty acid oxidation pathway, decreased Acsl1, Cpt2, Acadm and Hadhb gene
  expression leads to a lack of acetyl-CoA. (b) In the fasted condition, the Hras
  G12S mutation leads to increased Got1 expression and decreased Glud1 expression
  through ERK activation. The G6pd gene is also activated in the fed condition. Upregulation
  of Got1 and downregulation of Glud1 lead to diminished levels of alpha-ketoglutaric
  acid, which is used to produce ATP in the TCA cycle. The reduced gene expression
  of Acadm and Hadh leads to impaired fatty acid oxidation, which is the main energy
  supplier under conditions of starvation. Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate; Asp, aspartic
  acid; OAA, oxaloacetic acid; α-KG, alpha-ketoglutaric acid.
