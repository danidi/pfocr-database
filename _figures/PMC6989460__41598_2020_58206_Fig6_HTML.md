caption: 'Hypothesis on the non-overlapping roles of ABA and insulin in muscle glucose
  transport and in adipocyte metabolism. Under conditions of high blood glucose (HG)
  insulin promotes phosphorylation of Akt on both Ser473 and Thr308. Phosphorylation
  at both sites results in maximal activation. Fully phosphorylated Akt prevents activation
  of AMPK by inhibition of LKB-1 and by phosphorylation of AMPK on Ser485/491. ABA,
  via LANCL2, promotes phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172, activating the kinase both
  under conditions of low (LG) and of high glucose (HG). Activation of AMPK downstream
  of LANCL2 may occur via PKA-mediated phosphorylation of either or both kinases known
  to activate AMPK, i.e. LKB-1 and CamKK-β (dashed lines). (1) Activation of PKA downstream
  of the ABA/LANCL2 signaling pathway occurs in several human and rodent cell types,,.
  (2) PKA can phosphorylate and activate LKB-1, and can also phosphorylate CD38, leading
  to overproduction of the Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger cADPR: this in turn could
  lead to an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, activating Ca2+-dependent
  CamKK. Insulin-activated Akt inhibits AMPK through several mechanisms: (3) - indirectly,
  by nuclear sequestration of LKB-1 and, (4)- directly, by the hierarchical phosphorylation
  of Ser485, which prevents subsequent phosphorylation on Thr172 by LKB-1,,. Downregulation
  of AMPK is necessary to allow an optimal anabolic response to high nutrient availability,
  and the opposite is also true: the ability of insulin and IGF-1 to stimulate protein
  synthesis is suppressed by AMPK. AMPK is an upstream activator of PGC-1α which increases
  GLUT4 expression and glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle, and is a master regulator
  of mitochondrial biogenesis. Indeed, ABA stimulates PGC-1α transcription, mitochondrial
  production and O2 consumption in preadipocytes. Downstream of the signaling pathway
  of insulin, Akt phosphorylated both on Ser473 and on Thr308 stimulates fatty acid
  and triglyceride synthesis in the white adipose tissue. Conversely, downstream of
  the signaling pathway of ABA, mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of browning
  genes in white adipocyte and brown adipose tissue glucose uptake are increased.
