caption: 'Molecular mechanisms involved in autophagy and NAFLD.Notes: 1. A small vascular
  sac called an isolation membrane is formed to enclose lipid droplets, which results
  in a double membrane structure called an autophagosome, which subsequently fuses
  with a lysosome to degrade lipid droplets into FFA. 2. Growth factor activates the
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to active mTOR, leading to phosphorylation of the ULK1
  complex, resulting in inhibition of autophagy formation. Short-term resistance may
  activate autophagy via inhibition of mTOR, while long-term lipotoxicity impairs
  autophagy by inhibition of the FOXO pathway. 3. The class III PI3K/Beclin-1 complex
  positively regulates autophagy. 4. Increased FFA oxidation causes mitochondrial
  oxidative stress and activates autophagy. ROS also promotes cell apoptosis and JNK
  phosphorylation, which stimulates Bcl-2 phosphorylation and Bcl-2/Beclin-1 disassociation,
  resulting in apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. Likewise, ROS promotes NF-κB
  translocation into the nucleus, causing inflammatory cascades and liver injury.
  5. Obesity causes ER stress, which activates autophagy and promotes adipogenesis-related
  gene expression such as FAS, SCD, leading to the synthesis of adipocytes. 6. Autophagy
  may show an inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation from WAT to BAT. 7. MP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) inhibits mTOR, and ultimately activates autophagy.Abbreviations:
  NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; FFA, free fatty acid; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose
  tissue.'
