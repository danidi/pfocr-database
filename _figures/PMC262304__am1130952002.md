caption: 'Proposed metabolism of sulfoquinovose via reactions of the Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas
  (glycolysis) pathway. Pathways to the left of the dotted line are for glucose 6-phosphate.
  Enzymes catalyzing each reaction are the following: reaction 1, phosphoglucose isomerase;
  reaction 2, phosphofructokinase; reaction 3, aldolase; reaction 4, triosephosphate
  isomerase; reaction 5, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; reaction 6, phosphoglycerate
  kinase; reaction 7, phosphoglycerate isomerase; reaction 8, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase;
  reaction 9, glycerophosphatase. Reactions to the right of the dotted line (with
  primed numbers for the reaction steps) show the proposed corresponding reactions
  for sulfoquinovose. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate produced from C-1-C-3 of sulfoquinovose
  at the aldolase step (3′) provides assimilable carbon for growth. The C-4-C-6 carbon
  fragment bearing the sulfonate group is converted to the observed intermediates
  shown in bold. Pi, inorganic phosphate.'
