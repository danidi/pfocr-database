caption: Rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) activation converts normal keratinocytes
  to an initiated phenotype through a series of potentially reversible autocrine signals.
  Cultured mouse keratinocytes transduced with an oncogenic RAS vector have revealed
  several autocrine loops essential for tumor initiation []. Upregulation of epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and EGFR activity stimulates proliferation
  and activates the Src/Fyn pathway to tyrosine phosphorylate and inactivate PKCδ,
  reducing its role as an essential component of the keratinocyte death pathway, thus
  inhibiting the terminal stage of differentiation []. Tumor initiation by oncogenic
  RAS, through cross-activation by EGFR and its signaling through protein kinase C
  (PKC)α, causes release of interleukin-1α (IL-1α), activation of interleukin-1 receptor
  (IL-1R) signaling through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), phosphorylation
  of IκBα and nuclear translocation of p65, p50, and RelB, activating nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) transcriptional activity. Among the downstream effectors are chemokine (C-X-C
  motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) ligands, other chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines,
  and tissue-remodeling enzymes that characterize the oncogene-associated intrinsic
  inflammation, as well as the suppression of keratinocyte differentiation markers
  that characterize the initiated phenotype []. Pathways dependent on the IL-1α–MyD88
  autocrine loop are highlighted in yellow.
