caption: Model depicting role of MAP kinase in cell migration. Proposed signaling
  pathway leading from integrin or growth factor receptor ligation to activation of
  cell migration. This model takes into account that MAP kinase can be activated by
  integrins and/or growth factors. As shown in this study, once activated, MAP kinase
  can phosphorylate MLCK, which in turn shows enhanced activity as measured by its
  ability to phosphorylate MLC. This model assumes that this phosphorylated MLC regulates
  the cell's actin-myosin motor function, thereby facilitating contraction leading
  to cell movement on the extracellular matrix.
