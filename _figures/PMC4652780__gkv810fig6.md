caption: 'A network overview of the biomarkers in lung cancer and ALL. Each network
  shows genes that (i) were found differential specifically in the disease or in a
  more general disease that contains it according to the DO database, and (ii) have
  a drug targeting them, or were found to be associated with the disease according
  to the COSMIC database. Black edges are PPIs, and gray edges are GIs. Each node
  shows four features of a gene: (i) differential pattern compared to negatives, (ii)
  differential pattern compared to BGCs, (iii) whether a targeting drug exists and
  (iv) if the gene was associated to lung cancer according to COSMIC. Nodes without
  a purple background are genes that are not associated with any pathway in KEGG,
  Reactome, NCI, or Biocarta. (A) Lung cancer. The initial network (top left) contained
  89 genes. The two largest connected components in the PPI network are shown. The
  GeneMANIA analysis added COL5A2 and TMP1 to the network. (B) ALL. The original network
  contained 136 genes and 424 edges. The figure focuses on the largest PPI connected
  component.'
