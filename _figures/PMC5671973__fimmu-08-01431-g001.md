caption: Recognition of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) by innate immune system.
  In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), cell-free HIV is taken up through endocytosis
  while cell-associated virus enters into pDCs by fusion and endocytosis. The single-strand
  RNA (ssRNA) released from virus is recognized by TLR3 and TLR7. Then the activated
  toll-like receptors (TLRs) stimulate MyD88 and TRIF signal pathway, recruit NF-κB
  and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)-7, respectively, to trigger type-I interferons
  (IFN-I) production. In macrophages and CD4+ T cells, HIV-1 enters cells mainly through
  fusion and endocytosis. But the ssRNA is detected by retinoic acid-inducible gene
  (RIG)-I, which stimulates mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)–IRF-3
  dependent pathway, and next moderately induces the expression of IFN-I.
