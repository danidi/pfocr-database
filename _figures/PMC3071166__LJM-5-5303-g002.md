caption: Schematic representation of the potential immune deviation leading to the
  beneficial effects of SIT. Allergen SIT results in both a shift in allergen-specific
  T-cells from Th2 to Th0/Th1 responses and the generation of IL-10 and TGF-β producing
  T regulatory (Treg) cells. Allergen-specific Th1 immune responses protect against
  the development of allergic disorders by inducing the production of IFN-γ, which
  inhibits the development of Th2 cells. The regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β
  induce switching of B cell responses in favor of IgG4 antibodies and IgA antibodies,
  respectively, and suppress IgE production. IL-10 and TGF-β directly or indirectly
  suppress effector cells of allergic inflammation such as mast cells and eosinophils
  thereby preventing release of mediators and late-phase inflammation. Sold gray arrows
  represent immune response pathway to natural exposure; dotted arrows represent immune
  response pathway to IT; blocked lines represent inhibition.
