caption: miRNA pathway in FMRP-mediated translational control. FMRP interacts with
  Dicer and RISC, and could participate the processing of miRNA precursors into mature
  miRNAs (i.e. miR-124a in Drosophila). FMRP could bind to mRNA through either G-quartet/stem
  structure or ‘kissing complexes’. Once FMRP binds to its mRNA ligands, it could
  recruit RISC along with specific miRNAs (i.e. bantam in Drosophila) to its mRNA
  ligands and facilitate the recognition between miRNAs and mRNAs, which could modulate
  the translation of the bound mRNA ligands.
