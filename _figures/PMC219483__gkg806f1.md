caption: Biochemical pathways of TSH and folate metabolism in Leishmania. (A) Folate
  and pterin metabolic pathways. (B) TSH biosynthetic pathway including selected aspects
  of cysteine and methionine pathways. (C) TSH-dependent peroxide reduction pathway.
  (D) Model for antimony resistance in Leishmania. All annotated genes involved in
  these pathways and their abbreviations are listed in Table  and were arrayed on
  DNA microarrays. F, DHF, THF, B, DHB and THB correspond to Folate and Biopterin
  and their Dihydro and Tetrahydro forms.
