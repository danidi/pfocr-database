caption: 'Glucose-6 phosphate: a source of energy and carbon skeletons. The G6P is
  metabolized either through the glycolytic pathway or PPP, which are tightly connected,
  depending on metabolic demands. Non-dividing normal differentiated cells mainly
  depend on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of pyruvate, which is produced
  from glycolysis, to generate ATP. During cell proliferation or starvation periods,
  G6P is preferentially metabolized via PPP to maintain carbon homeostasis and produce
  biomass. In this case, glycolysis produces pyruvate and lactate as final metabolites
  and becomes inefficient in producing ATP. Indeed, G6P is preferentially metabolized
  via PPP to provide precursors for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis and to
  provide reducing molecules in the form of NADPH used in reductive biosynthesis reactions
  within cells (e.g., fatty acid synthesis). Lactate is also used by the hepatocyte
  to produce glucose and maintain glycaemia.'
