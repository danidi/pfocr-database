caption: Schematic of the mechanism via which DIM mainly target SOCE to induce BGC-823
  gastric cancer cells apoptosis and autophagy through Ca2+/AMPK/ER stress signaling
  pathway. DIM activate STIM1-mediated SOCE, which significantly increase intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration and subsequently leads to the activation of p-AMPK/p-ACC expression
  and ER stress. In ER stress, DIM mainly activate the ATF6-CHOP signaling pathway.
  In addition, AMPK signaling pathway is also a mediator of ER stress, which leads
  to apoptosis and autophagy.
