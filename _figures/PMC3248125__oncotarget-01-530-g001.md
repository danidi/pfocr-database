caption: A ligand engaged RTK binds PI3K, either directly or indirectly via adaptor
  molecules such as IRS1, removing the inhibitory action of the p85 regulatory subunit
  on the catalytic p110 subunit. The active kinase generates PIP3 at the lipid membrane.
  PIP3 facilitates the phosphorylation of Akt by PDK1, while the mTOR-rictor complex
  contributes a second phosphate residue to Akt. As the central effector of the PI3K
  pathway, Akt transmits signal to a host of downstream substrates, thus influencing
  a variety of key cellular functions. Pathway activity is negatively regulated by
  PTEN and the S6K-IRS1 feedback loop. Pharmacological inhibition of the pathway is
  achieved through a variety of compounds in clinical use at various points along
  the pathway that are indicated by the red ⊣.
