caption: Proposed model of the stimulatory effect of growth differentiation factor
  8 (GDF8) on relative transwell cells in human trophoblast cells. GDF8 binds to a
  heterotetrameric receptor complex comprised of type I (ALK5) and type II receptors.
  Ligand-induced activation of the receptor complex results in the phosphorylation
  and activation of ALK5, leading to the activation of receptor-regulated SMAD2 and
  SMAD3. Phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 form a heterotrimeric complex with common
  SMAD4 that translocates into the nucleus where it binds the FSTL3 promoter and stimulates
  the transcription and secretion of FSTL3, which in turn promotes cell invasion of
  human trophoblast cells.
