caption: Upon ligand stimulation, JAK-binding receptors aggregate in the plasmatic
  membrane forming dimers and bringing JAKs into close proximity. This allows JAKs
  to be trans-phosphorylated and further phosphorylate the receptor itself. The phosphorylated
  receptor is a docking site to STATs, which are also phosphorylated and activated
  by JAKs. Phosphorylated STATs (p-STATs) form dimers with other p-STATs, becoming
  active and able to translocate into the nucleus, where they stimulate gene transcription.
  The JAK-STAT pathway is then an effective way to communicate extracellular signals
  directly to the nucleus without the need of second messengers. This cascade may
  be regulated by SOCS, which blocks JAK kinase activity and also by PIAS that deactivate
  the STAT dimer. In melanoma context, there is a balanced overexpression of STAT1,
  STAT3, and STAT5. On the other hand, there is SOCS1 silencing in melanoma cells,
  which constitutes a potential biomarker for the disease.
