caption: DSBs in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, collapsed replication forks, and
  daughter-strand gaps all require HR for their repair. The effect of mild hyperthermia
  does not affect the ability of first responders, such as recruiting the Mre11 complex
  at DSB or RP-A binding to single-strand DNA. However, the recruitment of BRCA2 and
  RAD51 is affected, suggesting that somewhere in the HR pathway, there is susceptibility
  to heat-induced protein degradation. Although Krawczyk et al. () suggest that the
  target is BRCA2, it could be at multiple points along the BRCA2 pathway of HR, including
  BRCA1 and PALB2. In the absence of the key RP-A-to-RAD51 mediator, BRCA2, there
  is failure to carry out HR as observed by reduced RAD51 foci and reduced sister
  chromatid exchanges.
