caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and modulation of cell signaling
  events. The four mitochondrial complexes embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane—complexes
  I, II, III and IV—are responsible for electron transfer. ROS can be generated by
  complexes I, II and III. ROS produced by complexes I and II are primarily located
  in the matrix, while complex III can generate O2• in both the intermembrane space
  and matrix. Nevertheless, intermembrane ROS translocate to the cytosol and cellular
  trigger events; ROS can stabilize HIFα under hypoxic conditions, and this stabilization
  subsequently induces VEGF expression to promote endothelial cell proliferation and
  angiogenesis. ROS can also initiate the ERK signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation
  and survival and anchorage-independent growth. Moreover, they can lead to genomic
  instability and induce cancer progression.
