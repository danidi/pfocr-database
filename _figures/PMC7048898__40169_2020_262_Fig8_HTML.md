caption: Possible mechanism by which PI3K inhibitors ameliorate GC insensitivity in
  severe asthma. GC bind with GC receptors (GR) in the cytoplasm,then the GC-bound
  GR complex diffuse across the nuclear membrane where it binds to the glucocorticoid
  response element (GRE). The GRE is responsible for transcribing anti-inflammatory
  proteins. Additionally, binding of GC to GR results in recruitment of histone deacetylase
  2 (HDAC2), which is responsible for deacetylating GR, permitting its binding to
  nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and activating protein-1 (AP-1). Upon binding, these
  transcription factors are deactivated, thereby inhibiting the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  proteins. Additionally, HDAC2 deacetylates the histone permitting transcription
  of anti-inflammatory genes by GR. In severe asthma, oxidative stress can activate
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. PI3K phosphorylation reduce HDAC2 activity,
  affect the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene transcription
  and finally decrease corticosteroid sensitivity. Selective PI3K inhibitor (BEZ235
  et al.) can restore HDAC-2 activity, and nonselective PI3K inhibitor (LY294002 et
  al.) can directly inhibit phosphorylation of nuclear signal transcription factors
  and finally improve glucocorticoid insensitivity
