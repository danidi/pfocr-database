caption: The conversion into myofibroblasts from quiescent fibroblast involves mechanical
  and paracrine activation of profibrotic pathways. The upper part of the figure represents
  the transcriptional readout of the YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation, which is dependent
  on nuclear straining and opening of the nuclear pores []. Negative regulation of
  the pathway is exerted by components of the hippo-kinase pathway (LATS) that phosphorylate
  YAP and mediate its degradation []. The lower part of the panel represents the signaling
  cascade converging onto miR-21, a classical target of the transforming growth factor-beta
  (TGF-β)/Smad pathway []. The convergence of ‘mechano-paracrine’ pathways affecting
  the phenotype of profibrotic cells appears to be a new way to integrate signal transduction
  modalities once considered separated into the control of gene expression and chromatin
  structure.
