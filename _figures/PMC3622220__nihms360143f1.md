caption: A schematic overview of hippocampal signalling pathways whose modulation
  by sleep deprivation may contribute to the effects of sleep deprivation on memory
  formation. (A) Signalling pathways under baseline conditions. (B) Sleep deprivation
  has been reported to reduce glutamatergic signalling and cholinergic signalling
  while increasing adenosine levels and GABAergic signalling. Sleep deprivation also
  attenuates cAMP signalling and CREB-mediated gene transcription. All of these molecular
  events are shown in a single connected pathway in order to demonstrate how the effects
  of sleep deprivation could potentially interact to impact learning and memory. Dashed
  black lines and black arrows pointing down indicate attenuation of the signalling
  pathway. Red lines and upward pointing arrows indicate an increase of the signalling
  pathway.
