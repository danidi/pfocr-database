caption: The Life Cycle of AAV Vectors and the Basis of the Development of Tyrosine-,
  Serine/Threonine-, and Lysine-Modified Next Generation of Recombinant AAV Vectors(A)
  Following AAV2 binding to its primary cell surface receptor, heparan sulfate proteoglycan
  (HSPG), the vector interacts with human fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)
  as one of the co-receptors to gain entry into cells via a Clathrin-coated pit, traffics
  through early and late endosomes and becomes phosphorylated by epidermal growth
  factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase (EGFR-PTK). Phosphorylation of the capsid
  is a signal for ubiquitination, following which a large fraction of AAV vectors
  is degraded by the cellular proteasome machinery, leading to impaired intracellular
  trafficking and inefficient nuclear entry of AAV2 vectors. Inhibitors of EGFR-PTK
  prevent phosphorylation of the capsid, bypassing the ubiquitination- and proteasome-mediated
  degradation pathway and thereby improving intracellular trafficking and nuclear
  transport of AAV2 vectors. (B) In addition to surface-exposed Y residues, surface-exposed
  specific serine (S) and threonine (T) residues on AAV capsids can also be phosphorylated,
  which is a signal for ubiquitination. Surface-exposed specific lysine (K) residues
  on AAV capsids can be ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the host cell proteasome
  machinery. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues led to the generation of
  AAV2 vectors, which were more efficient.
