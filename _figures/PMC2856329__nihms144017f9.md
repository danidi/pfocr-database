caption: The Brx-mediated osmotic stress-activated signaling system and its implications
  for the immune response. (A) Intracellular signaling pathway of lymphocytes in response
  to osmotic stress. The sensing of and response to osmotic stress is largely mediated
  by Brx through the activation of Rho-type small G proteins and the subsequent stimulation
  of the p38 MAPK cascade and of NFAT5. NFAT5 participates in the elevation of intracellular
  osmolarity of immune cells and plays an essential role in the induction of various
  cytokines perhaps as a response to the hyperosmolar environment of inflammatory
  sites and several immune and other organs. (B) The Brx- and NFAT5-mediated response
  to osmotic stress in inflammatory sites and in pathologic conditions associated
  with extracellular hyperosmolarity. In addition to infectious agents, inflammatory
  cytokines, and other bioactive compounds released by inflamed tissues, inflammation
  activates lymphocytes by osmotic stress. The Brx- and NFAT5-mediated intracellular
  signaling system stimulates the secretion of cytokines to modulate local and systemic
  inflammatory reactions, while it induces hyperosmolarity-responsive genes to protect
  lymphocytes from the hyperosmolar environment of inflammatory sites. Pathologic
  conditions associated with extracellular hyperosmolarity may alter the various functions
  of lymphocytes through activation of Brx- and NFAT5-mediated signaling system.
