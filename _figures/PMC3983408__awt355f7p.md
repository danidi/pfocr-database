caption: Mechanism of immune dysfunction in Huntington’s disease. (A) In normal wild-type
  HTT expressing myeloid cells, lipopolysaccharide binds the TLR4 receptor activating
  the NFκB pathway triggering production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6
  and TNFα. (B) Mutant (m)HTT interferes with the NFκB pathway by two distinct mechanisms.
  The mutant protein binds IKKγ to directly cause increased IκB degradation and NFκB
  transcription factor translocation, allowing increased transcription of target genes
  such as IL-6 and TNFα. Moreover, mutant HTT causes transcriptional changes leading
  to increased expression of key molecules within the signalling cascade likely to
  increase signalling transduction rate.
