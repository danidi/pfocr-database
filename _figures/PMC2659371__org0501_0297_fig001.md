caption: The Calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway. Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent
  serine-threonine phosphatase. Calcineurin has a catalytic subunit “A” and a regulatory
  subunit “B”. Both of these subunits are indispensible for calcineurin activity.
  The activity of calcineurin can be inhibited by a number of intrinsic and pharmacological
  inhibitors, such as Cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. The increase in cytoplasmic calcium
  level can be triggered by many factors, including the activation of a diverse set
  of cell surface receptors, ion channels and even gap junctions. Intracellular calcium
  increase leads to the activation of calcineurin. Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates
  its substrates, including the NFATc transcription factors. The dephosphorylated
  NFATc proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to regulate the transcription
  of their target genes. The regulation of transcription by NFATc proteins requires
  nuclear partners (NFATn). These nuclear partners can be different for different
  target genes and in different cells. These nuclear partners are usually activated
  by a different set of receptors on the cell surface.
