caption: A VTA dopamine neuron is shown innervating a NAc medium spiny neuron. Opiates
  and cocaine produce generally opposite effects on the morphology of these two neuronal
  cell types. Chronic opiate administration decreases the surface area of VTA dopamine
  neurons, which is associated with decreased levels of neurofilament proteins and
  decreased axoplasmic transport to the NAc, however, their effects on dendritic spines
  and synaptic connectivity in the VTA are not known. The decrease in VTA neuron cell
  size is mediated by decreased activity of the IRS–PI3K–Akt pathway; chronic morphine
  also increases activity of the PLCγ pathway and causes variable effects on ERK in
  this brain region. In the NAc, opiates decrease neuronal branching and synapse number,
  effects that correspond with decreases in IRS–PI3K–Akt and ERK activity, although
  the molecular basis of the structural changes remain unknown. In stark contrast
  to opiates, stimulants increase dendritic branching and spine number in VTA dopamine
  neurons and NAc medium spiny neurons. This structural plasticity is associated with
  activation of ERK in both regions and with activation of PLCγ and NKκB in the NAc,
  with variable effects reported for IRS–PI3K–Akt. However, the molecular adaptations
  responsible for this dendritic growth in both regions are poorly understood.
