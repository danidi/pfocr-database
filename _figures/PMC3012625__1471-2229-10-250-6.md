caption: 'Numbers of reads in the non-normalized and normalized 454 sequence analysis
  for genes encoding enzymes in the fatty acid and TAG biosynthetic pathways in bitter
  melon seeds. Numbers after the gene (a/b) are the numbers of reads for the corresponding
  genes in the 454 analysis of cDNA libraries: a, non-normalized; b, normalized. The
  dashed arrows in the plastid fatty acid biosynthetic pathway indicate one or more
  cycles of acyl-chain elongation that is initiated by 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS)
  I or II. Abbreviations: BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit of acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; BC, biotin carboxylase subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase; α-CT, α-carboxyltransferase
  subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; FAB2/SAD, stearoyl-ACP
  desaturase; FatA, acyl-ACP thioesterase A; FatB, acyl-ACP thioesterase B; GPAT,
  glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase;
  PA Pase: phosphatidic acid phosphatase; LPCAT, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase;
  AAPT, CDP-choline:diacyglyglycerol cholinephosphotransferase; PLC, phospholipase
  C-type enzymes; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; PDAT, phospholipid:diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase; FAD2, Δ12 oleic acid desaturase; FAD3, Δ15 (ω-3) linoleic acid
  desaturase; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PA, phosphatidic
