caption: The term PII is generically used in this figure to represent various paralogs
  present in different organisms. Regulatory outputs triggered by ammonium excess
  (High N) and ammonium deficiency (Low N) are depicted on the left- and right-hand
  sides of the diagram, respectively. The bicyclic regulatory cascade involving GlnD
  (UTase/UR) and GlnE (ATase/AR), which controls GS activity and consequently the
  flux of nitrogen through the GS-GOGAT pathway, is shown in the centre of the figure.
  The carbon:nitrogen ratio, perceived by the concentrations of the regulatory metabolites
  2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) and glutamine (Gln) controls the uridylylation status of the
  PII proteins and their interactions with diverse targets. These include control
  of NH4+ transport by AmtB (top), regulation of nitrogen metabolism by the two-component
  NtrB–NtrC system and regulation of nitrogen fixation by NifA (bottom). Under ammonium
  replete conditions (left), high levels of glutamine stimulate de-uridylylation of
  PII by the uridylyl-removing (UR) activity of GlnD. Non-modified PII interacts with
  AmtB to block NH4+ transport and stimulates the ATase activity of GlnE leading to
  GS adenylylation and impairment of NH4+ assimilation via the GS-GOGAT pathway. Non-modified
  PII also influences transcription of general nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen fixation
  (nif) genes by stimulating the phosphatase activity of NtrB, inactivating NtrC (via
  dephosphorylation) and finally by inhibiting directly or indirectly NifA activity.
  Under ammonium-limiting conditions (right), the cooperative binding of 2-OG (red
  circles) to PII trimers, combined with low levels of glutamine stimulate uridylylation
  of PII by the uridylyltransferase (UTase) activity of GlnD. Modified PII (PII-UMP)
  is no longer able to interact with AmtB, allowing NH4+ uptake. In addition, PII-UMP
  stimulates the AR activity of GlnE leading to GS deadenylylation and activation
  of NH4+ assimilation via the GS-GOGAT pathway. Finally, PII-UMP is no longer able
  to stimulate NtrB phosphatase activity, leading to NtrC phosphorylation and activation
  of nitrogen metabolism genes. PII-UMP also signals low-nitrogen levels to NifA,
  triggering its activation and transcription of nif genes, encoding structural and
  accessory genes required for nitrogenase activity (bottom right). For the sake of
  simplicity, the binding of ATP or ADP to PII is not shown in this figure. The nitrogenase
  enzyme components, MoFe protein and Fe protein, are shown as a rounded rectangle
  and oval, respectively (centre–right). The Fe-S cluster in the Fe protein is indicated
  by the red cube and the P and FeMoco clusters in the MoFe protein are shown as a
  cylinder and triangle, respectively.
