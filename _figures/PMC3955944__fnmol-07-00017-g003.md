caption: '(A) Topography of ANF-RGC. The dashed lines on the right show the boundaries
  of: LS, leader sequence; ExtD, extracellular domain; TM, transmembrane domain; ICD,
  intracellular domain. The functional domains in ICD, their names and the aa constituting
  their boundaries are indicated at the left: JMD, juxtamembrane domain; ARM, the
  ATP regulated module; SHD-signaling helix domain; CCD-core catalytic domain. The
  site targeted by NCδ (encircled) is within CCD. (B) The signaling pathways of ANF
  and of NCδ are independent. The trajectory of the ANF pathway is in red dashed arrow.
  From the ExtD, it passes through the TM, ARM and SHD in its course to CCD. The trajectory
  of the NCδ pathway (in blue dashed arrow) is within the CCD. The CCD exists as an
  antiparallel homodimer (reproduced with permission from ref. ).'
