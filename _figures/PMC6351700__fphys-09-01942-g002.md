caption: Schematic/proposed signaling model in a cell during tumor formation. Aberrant
  change in signaling pathways result in the resistance of the normal cellular apoptosis
  and/or senescence in a cell which is destined to be a tumor cell. The anti-apoptotic
  proteins belonging to the bcl2 family are upregulated. The tight junction complex
  changes its course of normal function of selective permeability to unrestricted
  flow to various unintended solutes/growth/cytokine factors which may be responsible
  in up regulation of survival signaling pathways. The expression and/or phosphorylation
  of growth factor/cytokine receptors which promote cell growth are enhanced. The
  PI3-K/Akt pathway, which is a survival pathway, becomes activated along with the
  RAS-RAF-ERK pathway and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway which result in the up regulation
  of several growth response genes.
