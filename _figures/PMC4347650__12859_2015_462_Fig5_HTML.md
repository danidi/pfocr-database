caption: Pathway assembly of metabolome searcher output with heat maps of LC/MS data
  from the compounds file and the pathways file (tryptophan biosynthesis and asparagine
  biosynthesis I). This output is obtained by clicking on the pathway link for “asparagine
  biosynthesis I” inside the HTML file that brings up the pathway page at ProCyc.
  The heat maps are color-coded with green being 0, black the median value, and red
  the highest value within that data set. The heatmap number of 1 was at the initial
  time and number 2 was 24 hours later, which demonstrates the change in metabolites,
  from the MS list and visualized with the pathway and concentration.
