caption: Transcriptional complexity of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition network.
  Transcriptional complexity associated with the 17 most characterized mesenchymal-epithelial
  transition pathway (MET) genes. Genes that have evidence of alternative splicing
  include alternate exon usage, alternate 5' and 3' exons highlighted with black circle.
  Genes with long 5' and/or 3' UTR signal are represented by white circles and antisense
  transcript in blue circles. Literature evidence of microRNA association is represented
  for Lhx1 (miR-30) and Hoxa11 (miR-181) along with other known transcriptional regulatory
  relationship (dotted arrows). Figure modified from Little et al [].
