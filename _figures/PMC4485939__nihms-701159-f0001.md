caption: Phosphate absorption from food is regulated by NaPi-2b and PiT-1 in small
  intestine, and phosphate reabsorption from urine by NaPi-2a, 2c and PiT-2 in renal
  proximal tubules. Gut and kidney are the two major organs to modulate phosphate
  excretion based on dietary intake and phosphate concentration in extracellular fluid,
  which is also maintained by phosphate trafficking across bone controlled by NaPi-2a
  and PiT-1 in osteoblast. Membrane αKlotho can regulate urinary phosphate excretion
  through FGF23 signaling pathway. In addition, soluble αKlotho can also exert phosphaturic
  action via a FGF23-independent manner to directly modulate NaPi-2a activity. The
  role of αKlotho in modulation of bone formation is known but αKlotho protein is
  not expressed in bone; soluble αKlotho is therefore considered an alternative candidate.
  How soluble αKlotho affects NaPi transport activity in the bone has not been addressed,
  although αKlotho has been shown to suppress NaPi-2a expression and activity in proximal
  tubules and PiT-1 expression and activity in vascular smooth muscle cells. Therefore,
  it is still premature to conclude that αKlotho can directly affect bone development
  and mineralization.
