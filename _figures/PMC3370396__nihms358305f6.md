caption: NSAIDs perturbed genes related to thrombosis, fibrinolysis, and PAR signaling.
  Thrombin cleaves Fibrinogen (FGA) to form insoluble fibrin monomers (Box 1). Fibronectin
  (FN1) and thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) bind to fibrinogen, and are positive regulators
  of blood coagulation. Glycoprotein 1b (GP1BA) functions as a receptor for von Willebrand
  factor. Fibrin and fibrinogen are further degraded by plasmin (Box 2, 3). Plasmin
  is derived from cleavage of proenzyme plasminogen (PLG) by tissue-type plasminogen
  activator (PLAT). Annexin 2 (ANAX2) forms a heterotetramer with S100 family protein
  p11 and serves as a cofactor for plasmin generation. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor
  (TFPI-2) and protein C (PROC) are key components of anticoagulant pathways. Thrombin
  and other coagulation proteases (factor Xa, VIIa) activate protease activator receptors
  PAR1 or PAR2 (Box 4) which initiate G protein-mediated intracellular signaling,
  leading to cell type dependent pro-inflammatory or protective responses in endothelial
  and smooth muscle cells. Genes down-regulated by NSAIDs are shown in light gray.
  Genes up-regulated by NSAIDs are shown in dark gray.
