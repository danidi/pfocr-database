caption: IPA was performed using 94 ECM proteins identified in our secretome analysis
  to determine the significant protein networks. Hierarchical model showing TGFβ1
  as a major hub protein, interacting with or regulating expression of several other
  proteins in the network. Bold arrows show direct regulation, bold lines show direct
  interactions while dotted lines represent indirect interactions among proteins shown
  in the network.
