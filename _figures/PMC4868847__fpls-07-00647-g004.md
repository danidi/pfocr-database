caption: A representation of the C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-subtype pathway.
  Atmospheric CO2 is converted to bicarbonate (HCO3-) by CA in the mesophyll (M) cytosol.
  PEP is carboxylated, producing OAA, by PEPC. The OAA is either transaminated to
  Asp by AST in the cytosol, or is reduced to malate in the chloroplast (green oval)
  by NADP-MDH. The Asp diffuses into the BS cell cytosol, where it is transaminated
  back to OAA, which is then decarboxylated by PEP carboxykinase (PCK). The resulting
  PEP diffuses into the M, while the CO2 is used to make carbohydrates by the PCR
  cycle. The malate formed in M chloroplasts is transferred to BS mitochondria (blue
  oval), where it is decarboxylated by NAD-ME, with the released CO2 diffusing into
  BS chloroplasts for fixation, and the pyruvate being transaminated to Ala in the
  BS cytosol by ALT. The Ala is transferred to the M, where another ALT converts it
  back to pyruvate, which is then converted to PEP in the chloroplast by PPDK.
