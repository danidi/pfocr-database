caption: Diagram depicting a potential mechanism of interactions. BPI can alleviate
  cognitive impairment in diabetic mice by blocking the LPS-LBP-TLR4 signaling pathway.
  LPS was overexpressed and BPI was poorly expressed in diabetic mice with cognitive
  impairment. Exogenous LPS promotes inflammation, insulin resistance, and cognitive
  impairment in diabetic mice. Overexpression of BPI inhibited the LPS-LBP-TLR4 signaling
  pathway, thereby suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway and ultimately reducing
  inflammation, insulin resistance, and cognitive impairment in diabetic mice.
