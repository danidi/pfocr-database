caption: The biosynthesis of NAD+ follows a circadian pattern, which is caused by
  the circadian expression of NAMPT, a rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+biosynthetic
  salvage pathway. The Nampt gene contains E-boxes in its promoter, leading to direct
  transcriptional control by the dimer CLOCK:BMAL1. The fluctuating levels of NAD+
  modulate the activity of SIRT1 which in turn regulates the transcriptional activity
  of CLOCK:BMAL on their targets genes.
