caption: Francisella tularensis tularensis targets the PI3K/Akt pathway at multiple
  levels. Blue represents downregulated genes, red upregulated, white unchanged, and
  gray the resulting cellular outcomes. TLR2 is required for full PI3K activation
  by Francisella, which in turn activates Akt. Active Akt promotes NF-κB activation
  and cytokine production, as well as phagosome maturation and host cell survival.
  However, the phosphatases SHIP and PTEN antagonize this Akt activation. SHIP expression
  is inhibited by miR-155, which is induced by the low-virulence but not high-virulence
  subspecies of Francisella. This lack of miR-155 induction by the high-virulence
  subspecies leads to maintenance of SHIP levels. The other phosphatase PTEN is upregulated
  and maintained in a highly active state upon infection with high-virulence Francisella.
