caption: Model depicting Rhb1-TOR signaling in the regulation of SAP2 expression.
  In the absence of Rhb1 (“1”) or in cells treated with rapamycin (“2”), TOR signaling
  directly or indirectly affects SAP2 expression by transmitting the signal from Gln3
  and Gat1 to activate STP1 expression. The SPS complex processes Stp1, and the active
  form of Stp1 in turn triggers SAP2 expression. Sap2 is processed before secretion
  into the environment. Enriched extracellular amino acids from extracellular proteins
  digested by Sap2 or other protease may also transmit a signal to activate the Tor1
  kinase (“3”) (which may or may not occur through the SPS sensor) to inhibit SAP2
  expression (and thus the Sap2 protein level) and other SPS-responsive genes. CM,
  cell membrane; NM, nuclear membrane. An asterisk indicates the active form of a
  particular protein, and a dashed line represents a hypothetical correlation.
