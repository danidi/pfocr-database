caption: Simplified signaling pathway of the effects of resveratrol involved in metabolic
  control in the skeletal muscle. Resveratrol activates SIRT1. This increases the
  expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and in the presence of insulin
  increases the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  increases the activity of AKT by phosphorylating it at threonine 308. Phosphorylated
  AKT (pAKT) activity stimulates translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (Glut
  4) to the membrane of the skeletal muscle cells, increasing glucose uptake. Phosphoinositide
  3-kinase is inhibited by retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), which is released by
  adipose tissue. Retinol binding protein 4 expression is increased by obesity but
  is inhibited by resveratrol. Resveratrol, through SIRT1, also increases levels of
  peroxisome proliferating activation receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), and peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor α (PPAR-α). Peroxisome proliferating activation receptor γ coactivator
  1α upregulates the expression of Glut 4 and activates PPAR-γ in skeletal muscle,
  increasing whole-body insulin sensitivity. Peroxisome proliferating activation receptor
  γ coactivator 1α also increases mitochondrial activity and energy-store oxidation.
  Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ increases the expression of proteins
  important to metabolic homeostasis, such as IRS-2, which also increase insulin sensitivity.
  Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α has been shown to reduce the level
  of free fatty acids (FFAs) and lipid deposition in peripheral tissue that contributes
  to insulin resistance; thus, PPAR-α increases insulin sensitivity.
