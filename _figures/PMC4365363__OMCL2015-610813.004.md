caption: Interrelation of ROS and inflammatory cytokines in neurodegeneration. An
  initial neuronal damage can promote inflammation by activating the canonical NFκB
  pathway in glia cells via TLR activation resulting in the expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines and generation of ROS/RNS. Proinflammatory cytokines, in particular TNF,
  can promote neurodegeneration by further activating NFκB in glia cells, but also
  by damaging mitochondria in neurons resulting in increased ROS formation or by directly
  inducing neuronal cell death. ROS can further activate NFκB signaling in glia cells
  thereby promoting a sustained proinflammatory response. In addition, excess ROS/RNS
  formation by mitochondrial damage or by activated microglia and astrocytes can exacerbate
  neurodegeneration by damaging DNA, proteins, and membranes. Moreover, altered neuronal
  proteins, such as Aβ and α-synuclein, can promote ROS formation, for example, by
  impairing mitochondrial function. This interrelation of ROS promoting inflammation
  and TNF promoting ROS production can, when uncontrolled, ultimately result in chronic
  neurodegeneration.

  description: Interrelation of ROS and inflammatory cytokines in neurodegeneration.
    An initial neuronal damage can promote inflammation by activating the canonical
    NFκB pathway in glia cells via TLR activation resulting in the expression of proinflammatory
    cytokines and generation of ROS/RNS. Proinflammatory cytokines, in particular
    TNF, can promote neurodegeneration by further activating NFκB in glia cells, but
    also by damaging mitochondria in neurons resulting in increased ROS formation
    or by directly inducing neuronal cell death. ROS can further activate NFκB signaling
    in glia cells thereby promoting a sustained proinflammatory response. In addition,
    excess ROS/RNS formation by mitochondrial damage or by activated microglia and
    astrocytes can exacerbate neurodegeneration by damaging DNA, proteins, and membranes.
    Moreover, altered neuronal proteins, such as Aβ and α-synuclein, can promote ROS
    formation, for example, by impairing mitochondrial function. This interrelation
    of ROS promoting inflammation and TNF promoting ROS production can, when uncontrolled,
    ultimately result in chronic neurodegeneration.
