caption: The IRE1α-XBP1 pathway in hepatic lipogenesis. (a) XBP1s directly regulates
  the expression of a subset of lipogenic genes. (b) XBP1 ablation activates IRE1α
  because of feedback regulation of IRE1α activity caused by the abundance of its
  substrate XBP1s. Hyperactivated IRE1α then downregulates the expression of a group
  of lipid metabolism genes, including Angptl3 and the carboxylesterase1 (Ces1) gene
  family, by regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). (c) XBP1s regulates TG-rich VLDL
  assembly and secretion in hepatocyte-specific IRE1α deletion mice under physiological
  conditions, which affects MTP activity by regulating PDI at the transcriptional
  level. (d) XBP1s can interact with the promoter of the SREBP-1c gene following insulin
  treatment, thereby mediating lipogenesis. (e) XBP1s overexpression stimulates transcription
  by the FAS promoter. (f) A disordered circadian clock results in the constitutive
  activation of the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway, thus influencing hepatic lipid metabolism.
  (g) Hepatic IRE1α-XBP1 signaling is activated by prolonged fasting. Then, XBP1s
  can directly bind to the endogenous PPARα promoter and upregulate PPARα expression,
  thereby modulating mitochondrial β-oxidation and ketogenesis. MTP, microsomal triglyceride
  transfer protein; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor α; PDI, protein
  disulfide isomerase; TG, triglyceride; VLDL, very-low-density lipoprotein.
