caption: Proposed model for effect of GNE mutation on actin dynamics and cell migration.
  The figure shows that GNE is involved in integrin signaling pathway leading to regulation
  of cell migration. GNE interacts with α-actinin and localized in the focal adhesion
  complex where it regulates the activation of RhoA. RhoA activates its downstream
  signaling molecule leading to regulation of Cofilin, the actin severing molecule.
  The active turnover of actin filament by Cofilin fuels the G-actin pool required
  for actin polymerization and cell migration. In GNE mutant cells, the activity of
  RhoA is upregulated, which leads to downregulation of active Cofilin. The downregulation
  in Cofilin activity changes the dynamic of actin, resulting in low turnover of the
  actin and slow cell migration.
