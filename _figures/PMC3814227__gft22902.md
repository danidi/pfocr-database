caption: 'Autophagy: regulation. A line diagram with arrows as progressive pathways
  and bars inhibitory is shown. Blue lines are primarily catabolic, whereas black
  are anabolic. Excessive mTORC1 activity can lead to increases in proteins, growth,
  adipogenesis and lipogenesis. Combined with an mTORC1 inhibition of autophagy for
  quality control and removal of dysfunctional proteins and organelles, progression
  can lead to cell stress. This diagram also illustrates the checks and balances between
  the catabolic and anabolic pathways, the result if one pathway, mTORC1 as per diabetes,
  skews that balance, and the reliance of one pathway on the other (i.e. amino acids
  generated by autophagy for mTORC1 activation, and mTORC1 generation of lysosomes
  support autophagy).'
