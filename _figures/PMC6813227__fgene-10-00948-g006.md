caption: 'Signaling pathways. This figure illustrates some of the many signaling pathways
  that have been connected to aging. Activating interactions are shown with arrows,
  while inhibiting interactions are represented by bar headed lines. (A) Almost all
  of the age-related signaling pathways converge on the metabolic signal integrator
  mTORC1 complex, which includes the mTOR kinase together with RPTOR and other proteins.
  mTORC1 integrates stimuli to fine-tune metabolic processes, protein synthesis, cell
  growth, and autophagy. Downstream targets of mTORC1 include ribosomal proteins and
  translation initiation factors, like RPS6KB1 and EIF4EBP1, as well as ULK1, which
  is an activator of autophagy. As its name indicates, mTOR is the main target of
  rapamycin, which inhibits its function. (B) The IGF1 signaling is considered to
  be the main modulator that links autophagy to aging. Upregulation of this pathway
  leads to repression of autophagy and activation of protein synthesis by mTOR. This
  pathway includes many proteins, most of which have kinase activity. The PI3K enzymes
  transmit the signal from the IGF1 receptor by phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol
  molecules in the membrane, which then activate PDPK1. From here, the signal is forwarded
  to AKT (also known as PKB) by phosphorylation. AKT then inhibits the function of
  the TSC1 and TSC2 proteins, and consequently releases RHEB from inhibition. RHEB
  directly binds and activates the mTORC1 complex. (C) Another signaling pathway,
  which acts parallel to IGF1, is the TGF-β signalization. It is implicated in cellular
  growth control and also in tumorigenesis and inhibits autophagy. SMAD proteins transduce
  the TGF-β signal to downstream targets. An important target of SMAD2/4 is the FOXO
  gene family. (D) FOXO transcription factors have an evolutionary conserved function
  in aging regulation and integrate several pathways to upregulate autophagy and inhibit
  mTORC1. (E) Sirtuins (SIRT1/2) act contrary to the TGF-β pathway as they upregulate
  FOXO and thus autophagy. Resveratrol and caloric restriction exert their anti-aging
  effect through the activation of sirtuins. (F) The MAPK proteins were also shown
  to play a role in aging by regulating FOXO. They serve as important early responsive
  elements of different cellular stimuli and also play a role in apoptotic cell death
  induction in the case of UV-light damage. (G) AMPK integrates metabolite sensing
  information and acts contrary to the IGF1 pathway: activation of AMPK leads to down-regulation
  of mTOR and activation of autophagy. AMPK is the main target of metformin. mTOR,
