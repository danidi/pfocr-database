caption: Anti-tumor immune response through CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathway blockade, and
  T-cell signaling in the treatment of melanoma. Blocking CTLA-4 signaling and PD-1
  signaling strengthens the activation of anti-tumor T-cell response leading to tumor
  elimination. The activated T-cells are able to gain entry into the brain (not shown
  in the figure) and act at the site of brain metastases.
