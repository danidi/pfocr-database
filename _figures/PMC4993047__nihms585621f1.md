caption: 'Several independent yet critical neuroadaptations (e.g., decreased DRD2
  in DLS, increased NR2C in NAcore, 14-3-3ζ, and neuropeptides in CeA) likely all
  sustain activity in what could be called the “compulsive network”. Many regions
  in this circuit overlap with those proposed for motivation/action networks, including
  mPFC areas, basolateral and central amygdala, NAcb, and DLS. This circuit would
  in part be activated because of conflict during ethanol intake (wanting ethanol
  versus avoiding aversion); this would be considered strong top-down activation,
  since it would originate from cortical areas central for processing the conflict.
  Although the cortical regions and DLS were directly implicated in compulsivity,
  the CeA promotes compulsive alcohol drinking, but the mechanism remains unresolved.
  One possibility is that cortical activation of the CeA (through intermediary regions)
  during conflict generates physical/hormonal sensations which are then sensed as
  feedback meant to invigorate action, in this case ethanol intake or seeking in the
  face of challenge; this is essentially the Somatic Marker Hypothesis of Damasio
  (). The line without arrow between NAcore and CeA indicates interesting co-activity
  (e.g., ), although the intermediary regions and directions of interaction are uncertain.
  Much remains to be discovered about how the parts of the circuit shown interact
  to drive pathological ethanol or drug intake. See main text for further details.
