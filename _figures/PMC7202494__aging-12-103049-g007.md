caption: Schematic representation of the let-7f-5p/TARBP2 regulatory feedback loop
  in OS cells, which is induced by hypoxia and reduces the expression of let-7f-5p
  and TARBP2 in OS cells. A hypoxia-induced let-7f-5p/TARBP2 feedback loop regulates
  OS cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway.
