caption: Components that determine the establishment and tolerance-inducing capacity
  of tolerogenic effector DCs. (A) DCs expressing high level of anti-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-10, TGFβ) and low level of co-stimulatory molecules (DC80/86) show
  a tolerogenic rather than an immunogenic phenotype. Additionally, the capacity of
  DCs to express Raldh2 or IDO is associated with tolerance. Furthermore, the activity
  of several pathways is linked to tDCs, such as metabolic, apoptosis, and NF-κB pathway,
  or activity of SHP1 and STAT-3. Additionally, the antigen capture and processing
  machinery (uptake of apoptotic cells, antigen-uptake receptors such as CLRs together
  with the MHCI and II processing machinery) greatly influence the T-cell inducing
  and tolerogenic capacity of DCs. (B) A variety of biological substances have an
  impact on tDC differentiation and function. Cytokines, vitamins, hormones as well
  as antibodies, thrombomodulin (TM), adrenomedullin (AM), and VIP induce tDCs. (C)
  The dialog of DCs with other immune cells and stromal cells provides additional
  checkpoints for the maintenance of tolerance. DC-Treg crosstalk involves the regulation
  of Treg homeostasis, the activation and induction of Tregs. Tregs, IL-10 expressing
  B cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells favor a tDC phenotype. In addition, stromal
  cells promote tDC differentiation toward IL-10 or nitric oxide (NO) producing regulatory
  tDCs.
