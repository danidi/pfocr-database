caption: 'Neddylation dependent and independent activities of MLN4924. (1) Inactivating
  CRL (Cullin-RING ligase) E3: MLN4924 inactivates CRLs by blocking cullin neddylation
  to cause the accumulation of a number of tumor suppressor proteins, leading to growth
  suppression via inducing growth arrest, apoptosis, senescence, or autophagy in a
  variety of cancer cell lines. (2) Inducing EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
  dimerization: MLN4924 activates EGFR by triggering its dimerization to activates
  its downstream RAS/MAPK pathway to promotes tumor sphere formation and wound healing,
  and PI3K/AKT1 pathway to inhibits ciliogenesis, respectively. (3) Inducing PKM2
  (M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase) tetramerization: MLN4924 activates PKM2 via promoting
  its tetramerization to increase glycolysis.'
