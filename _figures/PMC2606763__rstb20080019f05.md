caption: Comparison of dominant metabolic pathways during (a) amino acid and (b) carbohydrate
  synthesis. Photosynthesis generates ATP and NADPH (green box). (a) During amino
  acid synthesis, most of this photosynthate enters the Calvin cycle to produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GAP), which is the initial substrate for the 20 amino acids. The process generates
  reductant (yellow circles with ‘+’), ATP (pink circles with ‘P’) and CO2 (blue circles),
  while some steps also consume ATP and reductant (red arrows). In prokaryotes, the
  citric acid cycle is incomplete between 2-oxoglutarate and succinyl-CoA (green dashed
  arrow). Some lipids are also produced during amino acid synthesis but not storage
  carbohydrates. (b) During carbohydrate synthesis, the glycolytic pathway is downregulated
  and photosynthate is used directly for other cell activities (blue box). 3-PGA,
  3-phosphoglyceric acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. For simplicity, histidine, which
  is synthesized from PRPP (5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate), ATP and glutamine,
  is depicted in (a) as deriving from glutamine. PRPP derives from ribose-5-phosphate
  which is primarily formed by the pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate
  pathway is not shown in this figure, but is another important pathway for generating
  ATP and reductant at the expense of GAP, while releasing CO2.
