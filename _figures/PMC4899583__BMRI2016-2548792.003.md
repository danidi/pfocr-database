caption: Schematic shows the potential role of epigenetic mechanism that may be involved
  in manganese induced chronic neurotoxic effects and in pathology of Parkinson's
  disease. The steady state level of Mn transporter (DMT1) is maintained by PARK2/parkin
  ubiquitin E3-ligase. miR-34b/c regulates the expression of PARK2. Loss of its expression
  can make the cells susceptible to elevated uptake of Mn. DJ1 works as an oxidative
  stress sensor which is again regulated by miR-34b/c; hence deregulation in miR-34b/c
  expression can make the cell vulnerable to oxidative stress. Mn induced oxidative
  stress causes the overexpression of α-synuclein via ERK/MAPK pathway or through
  epigenetic alteration in miR-7/miR-153 expression which regulates α-syn gene. Oxidative
  stress may also cause the hypomethylation of CpG islands at intron 1 of SNCA gene
  resulting in α-synuclein overexpression. Expression of α-synuclein is regulated
  by fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) which is in turn regulated by miR-433. The
  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at binding site of miR-433 disturbs epigenetic
  regulation of FGF20 causing α-synuclein overexpression. α-Synuclein under the influence
  of oxidative stress can form α-syn oligomers which leads to Golgi complex fragmentation
  and subsequent impairment in dopamine transporter biosynthesis and trafficking.
  α-Synuclein at cytoplasm binds to antiapoptotic 14-3-3, making proapoptotic BAD
  cause mitochondrial impairment. α-Synuclein is reported to sequester DNMT1 in cytoplasm
  which results in global hypomethylation of genes including those associated with
  Parkinson's disease (SNCA, PARK2, etc.). α-Synuclein expressed at physiological
  level is supposed to participate in cell survival via regulating proapoptotic PKCδ
  expression through epigenetic mechanism. α-Synuclein at nucleus binds to histone
  proteins and inhibits activity of histone acetyltransferase, causing deregulation
  of PKCδ expression. The inhibition of PKCδ expression resulted in DNA fragmentation
  followed by apoptotic cell death.
