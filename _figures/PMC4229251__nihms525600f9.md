caption: 'A) Summary of the hypothesis and the three lines of evidence that support
  it. Here, activated CNP/cGMP signaling leads to decreased phosphorylation of CRMP2
  (p-CRMP2), which activates microtubule assembly and axon branching/growth. The supporting
  evidence is based on correlative observations from biochemical, cell biological,
  and pharmacological studies. NOC: nocodazole.B) The proposed molecular pathway connecting
  the extracellular cue CNP to dynamic microtubule polymerization. Here, CNP binds
  to its cell surface receptor Npr2, which catalyzes the production of cGMP. cGMP-activated
  PrkG1 can phosphorylate GSK3 (p-GSK3) and prevent it from phosphorylating CRMP2.
  Following that in A), decreased CRMP2 phosphorylation (p-CRMP2) then leads to stimulate
  microtubule polymerization that is needed for axon branching and growth.'
