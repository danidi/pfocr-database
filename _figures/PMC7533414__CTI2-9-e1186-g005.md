caption: GSDMENT switches apoptosis to secondary necrosis/pyroptosis. (a) Caspase‐3,
  which is activated by intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathway, cleaves GSDME to
  generate the pyroptotic GSDMENT fragment, which permeabilises the plasma membrane
  and releases pro‐inflammatory DAMP molecules such as HMGB1, finally leading to secondary
  necrosis in macrophages. (b) Caspase‐3, which is activated by intrinsic or extrinsic
  apoptotic pathway, mediates GSDME cleavage to generate the pyroptotic GSDMENT fragment,
  which permeabilises the plasma membrane and releases LDH, finally leading to pyroptosis
  in cancer cells. CASP‐3, caspase‐3; Cyt c, cytochrome c; DAMP, danger‐associated
  molecular pattern; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.
