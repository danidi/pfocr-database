caption: Gene co-expression patterns specific to smokers (A) and non-smokers (B) derived
  by the implication network algorithm (P < 0.05) commonly present in both training
  and test sets. The biological interpretation of the implication relations are described
  in (C). Interactions reported in literature were also retrieved from Pathway Studio
  (D).
