caption: Hypothetical scheme of AhRR repression on AhR activity and the consequences
  in endpoints. Inhibition of the canonical AhR/ARNT pathway by AhRR can be mediated
  through a simple negative feedback mechanism based on its ability to form a complex
  with AhR’s dimerization partner ARNT. Furthermore, the AhRR can repress inflammatory
  genes independently from AhR/ARNT by interacting with other transcription factors
  (TF) such as subunits of the C/EBP and NF-κB family, which are involved in non-canonical
  AhR signaling.
