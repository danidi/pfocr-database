caption: Figure 2. Subcellular localization of mammalian Shugoshins. (A) Subcellualr
  localization of human Sgo1 and its major splicing variant during the cell cycle.
  Sgo1 is loaded on to the centromeric region as early as in late S phase. Centromeric
  Sgo1 peaks at early mitosis and retained until the anaphase onset. sSgo1, the major
  splicing variant, is primarily localized to the spindle pole although its localization
  dynamics during the cell cycle remains unclear. (B) A detailed view of Sgo2 localization
  at the centromere. During prophase, Sgo2 is localized to the inner centromere, directly
  protecting cohesin from the proteolytic cleavage. As mitosis progresses, Sgo2 relocates
  to the kinetochore and is eventually removed and degraded by the APC/C-dependent
  pathway. Removal of centromeric cohesin is an essential step for chromosome segregation
  at the anaphase onset.
