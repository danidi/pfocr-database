caption: SPCH is the molecular key that opens stomatal development and acts as a central
  molecular hub while specifying stomatal cell fate. SPCH determines the entry into
  the stomatal lineage and integrates diverse developmental and environmental signals
  mediated by the YDA-MKK4/5/7/9-MPK3/6 cascade, BIN2, CDKA;1, B-GATAs, and PIF4.
  SPCH also directly regulates asymmetric cell division in the stomatal lineage through
  activating the transcription of the key polarity proteins BASL and POLAR. SPCH expression
  is tightly and spatiotemporally regulated by HD-ZIP IV proteins, cell-to-cell connectivity,
  microRNA pathway, IDD16, and RBR. SPCH enhances its own activity by activating itself
  and SCRMs, thereby maintaining the MMC and meristemoid fate, and suppresses itself
  by activating the EPF2-TMM signaling to ensure proper stomatal density and patterning.
