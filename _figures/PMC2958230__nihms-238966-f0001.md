caption: 'The α/β-tubulin heterodimer is assembled as a result of the action of a
  series of tubulin-specific chaperones (TBCA-E) whose function is to assemble the
  tubulin heterodimer. Nascent α- and β-tubulin polypeptides are protected from off-pathway
  folding pathways by interaction with the cytosolic chaperonin, CCT. The chaperonin
  provides a sequestered chamber within which productive folding can take place in
  the absence of interactions with other molecules that might lead to misfolding.
  One or more cycles of ATP-dependent interaction with CCT leads to the production
  of quasi-native tubulin folding intermediates, defined by the incorporation of GTP.
  These intermediates are captured upon discharge from CCT either by TBCA (in the
  case of β-tubulin) or TBCB (in the case of α-tubulin). TBCA/β-tubulin (Aβ) and TBCB/α-tubulin
  (Bα) transfer their respective target proteins to TBCD and TBCE. These two complexes
  (i.e. TBCD/β-tubulin [Dβ] and TBCE/α-tubulin [Eα]) converge to form a supercomplex
  (TBCD/β/TBCE/α). Entry of TBCC into this supercomplex triggers the hydrolysis of
  GTP in the β-tubulin E-site. This reaction acts as a switch for the release of the
  newly formed α/β-tubulin heterodimer, which is then competent for GTP exchange and
  polymerization into microtubules. The folding reaction is reversible: TBCD and TBCE
  are capable of interacting with the native heterodimer, sequestering the β- and
  α-subunit, respectively (the so-called backreaction, shown as dashed lines in the
  Figure). Arl2 interacts with TBCD, sequestering it and thereby preventing it from
  disrupting the native tubulin heterodimer. Based on ,  and .'
