caption: Proposed model for the pathway through which WSC induce inflammation in alveolar
  epithelial cells. After exposure to WSC, the cells increase their NO production
  which in turn activates the p53-p21 pathways. The p53-p21 pathway induces cell cycle
  arrest and thus contributes to the cellular senescence. Senescent cells increase
  production of matrix proteases and TLR-4 thus causing inflammation.
