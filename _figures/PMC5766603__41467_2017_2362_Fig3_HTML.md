caption: 'The novoStoic procedure. novoStoic seamlessly blend existing reactions and
  reaction rules while designing a pathway from source metabolite to target metabolite.
  a The variable  defines the connection (green arrows) between the known reactions
  network (black arrows) and the reaction rules network (red arrows and red dotted
  box). It indicates the surplus or deficit of metabolite i in the known metabolic
  network. The reaction rules network is invoked to complete a pathway when no known
  reaction can catalyze the conversion. b Illustration of the component balance and
  moiety balance defined in novoStoic constraints (2) and (3) (Supplementary Methods).
  The bottom half (gray dotted box) is the known network operating on metabolites,
  while the upper half (red dotted box) is the reaction rules network operating on
  moieties. The section of the entire system that is involved in the moiety balance
  constraint is color-coded: (red) moiety changes by reaction rules, (blue) overall
  moiety changes, and (green) moiety changes by known reactions. The pathway here
  converts 2hipa to phnl using a known reaction (i.e., 2hipa → sal, black arrow) and
  a reaction rule (i.e., sal → phnl, red arrow). Metabolite 2hipa first enters the
  reaction rule network using exchange reaction (blue arrow, ) and subsequently exported
  to the known reaction network (green arrow, ). It is converted by a known reaction
  (black arrow) into sal, which is then transferred to the reaction rule network (green
  arrow, ). The reaction rule  (red arrow) converts sal into phnl, which is exported
  out of the entire system . Note that for clarity purpose, the involvement of carbon
  dioxide in the conversion of 2hipa to sal and sal to phnl is omitted'
