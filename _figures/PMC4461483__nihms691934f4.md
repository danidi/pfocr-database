caption: Possible role of Naa10 in cellular hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, HIF1α
  is hydroxylated by PHD proteins on prolines, leading to the subsequent ubiquitination
  by pVHL and rapid proteasomal degradation of HIF1α. Furthermore, hydroxylation of
  Asn903 by FIH disrupts binding of HIF1α to its transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP,
  and hence the transcriptional activity of the HIF-1α. Many reports have shown a
  direct interaction of Naa10 with HIF-1α, suggesting a link in this pathway. Naa10
  might either directly or indirectly stimulate HIF1α lysine acetylation, thereby
  destabilizing HIF1α, possibly through promoting its interaction with pVHL and PHDs.
  MTA1 counteracts the action of Naa10 by recruiting HDAC1 which leads to a deacetylation
  and subsequent stabilization of HIF-1α.
