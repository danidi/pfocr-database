caption: Possible mechanisms of hyperglycemia-induced cellular oxidative damage in
  the fetal heart. Excess glucose increases the rate of glycolytic metabolic pathways,
  overproducing electron donors that increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production. Coupled with impaired antioxidant defenses including lower levels
  of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and reduced glutathione
  (GSH), this leads to oxidative stress in diabetes. Glycolysis intermediate fructose-6-phosphate
  also feeds into the hexosamine pathway to produce UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc),
  which leads to impairment of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function by
  O-GlcNAc modification of eNOS at serine 1177, the site of phosphorylation by Akt
  activation. Oxidative stress also causes eNOS to undimerize and produce superoxide,
  which reacts with NO to potentiate oxidative and nitrosative stress. Additionally,
  advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), though binding to receptors of AGEs (RAGE)
  induce carbonyl stress and promote ROS. Dysfunctional eNOS and oxidative stress
  alter gene expression, cell proliferation, survival, and inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), leading to CHDs, which can be ameliorated by SOD1 overexpression,
  and maternal treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and sapropterin (BH4).
