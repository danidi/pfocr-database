caption: Fumarate is not secreted as a metabolic waste by P. falciparum. A, the carbon
  skeleton of [U-14C]aspartate (in which all of the carbon atoms are enriched in 14C
  (shown as bold circles)) is converted to [U-14C]fumarate in the parasite by the
  concerted actions of adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinate lyase. Arrows
  indicate the direction of the reaction. B, radio-TLC analysis of the spent medium
  of erythrocytes (2% hematocrit) and parasitized erythrocytes (2% hematocrit and
  8% parasitemia) incubated with 1 μCi of [U-14C]aspartate for 24 h. [U-14C]Aspartate
  and a mixture of [U-14C]aspartate and [2,3-14C]fumarate were used as TLC markers.
  A solvent mixture of n-butanol, acetic acid, and water in the ratio of 4:1:1 was
  used as the mobile phase for silica-TLC. The TLC plate was dried and developed using
  a Fuji FLA-5000 phosphorimaging device.
