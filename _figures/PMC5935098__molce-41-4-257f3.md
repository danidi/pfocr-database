caption: Nf2 expression is differentially regulated in the optic neuroepithelial continuum,
  which shows regional differentiation of proliferation rates. In the post-mitotic
  RPE, Mitf induces Nf2 expression by directly binding to upstream sequences of the
  Nf2 gene, triggering Hippo signaling and thereby excluding Yap/Taz from the nucleus.
  In proliferating RPCs, Sox2 inhibits the expression of Nf2 and, as a consequence,
  impedes Hippo signaling activity. In CM progenitors, which have the potential to
  give rise to RPCs and RPE in addition to developing locally into the CB and iris,
  Yap/Taz is localized to the nucleus, where it induces the expression of Nf2, thereby
  establishing the NF2-Hippo-Yap/Taz signaling cascade. This feedback regulatory circuit
  maintains a level of proliferation in CM cells intermediate between that of the
  RPE and RPCs.
