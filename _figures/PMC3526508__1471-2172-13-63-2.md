caption: 'Becoming a follicular or a MZ B-cell?. Left panel: Strong signalling through
  BcR activates Bruton''s tyrosine kinase (BTK), which in turn activates the canonical
  nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signalling pathway and prevents the cleavage of Notch2.
  BAFF-BAFF-R interactions deliver survival signals through NF-KB activation. Right
  panel: Notch2 can interact with its ligand, Delta-Like 1 (DL1), specifically expressed
  by the endothelial cells of red pulp venules in mice. This interaction initiates
  the cleavage of Notch2, which is not inhibited by weak BcR signalling. The intracellular
  domain of Notch2 enters into the nucleus where it interacts with Mastermind-like
  1 (MAML1) and RBP-J transcription factors. This transcriptional complex induces
  the commitment of B-cells towards MZ B-cells. BAFF-BAFF-R interactions deliver survival
  signals through canonical NF-KB activation.'
