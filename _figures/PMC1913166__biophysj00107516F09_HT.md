caption: (A) A transient to sustained switch. An adapting pathway based on saturable
  negative feedback (e.g., Model I) can produce transient or sustained signals in
  a dose-dependent fashion. Transient or sustained activation of a kinase (or transcription
  factor) results in the activation of a different subset of genes, thereby eliciting
  alternative responses. (B) The ability of this architecture to encode stimulus concentration
  as signal duration provides a mechanism for preventing cross-talk. The response
  on the left (RL) is initiated only when MAPK activation is sustained, whereas activation
  of the response on the right (RR) requires the MAPK activation to transiently exceed
  a threshold. The upstream adaptive system of the right pathway prevents inappropriate
  activation of RL by stimulus SR and regulates response LR by transforming the concentration
  of the stimulus SL into signal duration.
