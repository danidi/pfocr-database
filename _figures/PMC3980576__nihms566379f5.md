caption: Sae2 is required for resection initiation and prevention of NHEJ repair in
  S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. End resection creates ssDNA, the substrate for
  HR and MMEJ. RPA bound to ssDNA inhibits MMEJ between MH internal to the break ends
  and promotes HR. When RPA binding to ssDNA is perturbed (RPA*) annealing between
  MH is increased and the efficiency of HR is reduced.
