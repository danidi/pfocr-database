caption: Intracellular detection of viral RNA by PRRs and activation of the innate
  immune response. The three classes of PRRs responsible for detection of viral RNA
  are the TLRs, the RLRs, and the NLRs. In the endosome viral ssRNA is detected by
  TLR7 whereas viral dsRNA is recognized by TLR3. TLR7 recruits the signaling adaptor
  MyD88 whereas TLR3 associates TRIF. MyD88 elicits the production of type I IFNs
  through the direct activation of IRF7. TRIF activates the TRAF family member-associated
  TANK and IKKε both of which undergo phosphorylation to activate both IRF3 and IRF7.
  Both IRF3 and IRF7 form homodimers which translocate to the nucleus leading to the
  induction of type I IFN. At the same time, both TRIF and MyD88 activate IKK. The
  IKK complex triggers the release and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus leading
  to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the cytoplasm, short dsRNA with
  5'triphospahte ends is detected by RIG-I and long dsRNA is sensed by MDA5. Activation
  of RIG-I and MDA5 results in the recruitment of MAVS via CARD domain interactions.
  MAVS dependent signaling causes the translocation of the transcription factors IRF3
  and NF-κB for the induction of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines respectively.
  The inflammasome is activated by dsRNA via NALP3-dependent signaling pathway. NALP3
  together with ASC recruit pro-caspase-1 which in turn undergoes auto-cleavage to
  produce caspase-1. Activation of caspase-1 is required for the cleavage of pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18, and subsequent secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and
  IL-18, respectively. ADAR1p150 edits dsRNA within the cytoplasm and is induced by
  IFN.
