caption: Genes affecting dystroglycan glycosylation associated with congenital muscular
  dystrophy. The O-mannose–linked glycans on α dystroglycan are comprised of linear
  chain of 4 carbohydrates. There are 6 genes known to cause congenital muscular dystrophy
  that alter the glycosylation of α dystroglycan. POMT1 and POMT2 are both required
  for the synthesis O-linked mannose to serines and threonines on the α dystroglycan
  protein, while POMGnT1 synthesizes the second linkage, β1,2GlcNAc, on the O-mannose
  chain. Three other genes, fukutin, fukutin-related protein (FKRP), and LARGE, also
  affect this pathway, although their function is not yet clear. NeuAc, N-acetylneuraminic
  acid (or sialic acid); Gal, Galactose; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Man, Mannose.
