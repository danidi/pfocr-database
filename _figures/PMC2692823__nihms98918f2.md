caption: 'Mechanisms that have been implicated in the hypoxia-induced elevation of
  [Ca2+]i, and their potential signalling pathways. Note that some mechanisms are
  probably only applicable to one phase of HPV (see text). Not shown for clarity:
  possibility of functionally different types of SOC and Ca2+ store. Note that Na+
  entry via NSCC would also contribute to depolarisation. The boxes highlight studies
  from the last 2 years that address that pathway or channel. †: action of Mg2+ and
  ATP on KV channels depends on membrane potential (see text). DAG, diacylglycerol;
  cADPR, cyclic ADP ribose; depol, depolarization; KV, voltage-gated K+ channels;
  L-type, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels; NCX, Na+-Ca2+ exchanger; RyR, ryanodine receptors;
  SOC, store operated channels.'
