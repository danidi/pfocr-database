caption: Ethanol signaling pathway that initiates neural crest apoptosis. Shown is
  a summary of published studies (; , ) and results herein. Ethanol interacts with
  a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) of unknown identity to activate Gαi2/3 and Gβγ.
  Within seconds, the latter stimulates Phospholipase Cβ-mediated synthesis of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and calcium release predominantly from intracellular stores. The
  mobilized calcium interacts with one of several possible effectors, including CaMKII,
  Protein Kinase C or calpain to destabilize β-catenin and terminate its transcriptional
  stimulation of the TCF/LEF complex. Alternately, ethanol may destabilize β-catenin
  through its potential stimulation of GSK3b. The loss of β-catenin’s transcriptional
  activity promotes apoptosis whereas its maintenance promotes the survival of neural
  crest and neuronal precursors. “?” indicates that the contribution of this signal
  to ethanol-mediated cell death is unknown at this time.
