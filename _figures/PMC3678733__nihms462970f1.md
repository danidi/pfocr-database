caption: Human Hippo signaling pathway. Kinase cascade components STK, LATS, MOB,
  and SAV1 interact, leading to the phosphorylation and cytosolic sequestration of
  YAP and WWTR1 transcription factors. Caspase 3 may activate this process by cleaving
  STK3, increasing its kinase activity. Cytosolic sequestration of YAP and WWTR1 may
  also be mediated by AMOT and ZO proteins.
