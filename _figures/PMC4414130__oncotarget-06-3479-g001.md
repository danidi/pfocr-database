caption: Naïve T cells are primed by antigens presented by APCs in the context of
  MHC (signal 1), as well as co-stimulatory binding of CD28 to B7 (CD80/86) (signal
  2). T cells upregulate CTLA-4 shortly after activation. Ligation of CTLA-4 with
  CD80 or CD86 limits T-cell activation and proliferation. Activated T cells traffic
  to the periphery and encounter tumor antigens at the tumor site. PD-1 is upregulated
  on T cells after prolonged activation; binding to PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 or PD-L2)
  expressed by tumor or other immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells,
  causes T-cell activation and dampens an ongoing antitumor immune response.
