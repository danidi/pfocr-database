caption: Mitochondrial ETC generates superoxide (O2•−) that can be converted into
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by SOD2 or traverse through voltage-dependent anion channels
  (VDACs) into the cytosol. Subsequently, SOD1 converts superoxide into H2O2 to activate
  redox-dependent signaling. Mitochondrial ROS are necessary for cancer cell proliferation.
  Thus, mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants are effective in decreasing cancer cell
  proliferation. Mitochondria prevent accumulation of ROS to levels that would be
  detrimental to mitochondrial metabolism by increasing antioxidant capacity. NADPH
  is necessary to maintain the antioxidant function of glutathione peroxidase (GPXs)
  and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Mitochondria maintain redox balance by using SHMT2
  and MTHFD2, enzymes in one-carbon metabolism, indicating that this pathway may be
  a therapeutic target.
