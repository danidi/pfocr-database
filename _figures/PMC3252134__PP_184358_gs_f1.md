caption: The lignin biosynthetic pathway in cucumber. PAL, Phe ammonia-lyase; 4CL,
  4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; F5H, ferulate-5-hydroxylase;
  COMT, caffeate O-methyltransferase; POD, peroxidase. Major known in vivo pathways
  are shown with the enzymes in black lettering with black arrows. Pathways that may
  have been demonstrated in vitro or in vivo, but that are not considered to be primary
  pathways, are shown in gray. (Adapted from .)
