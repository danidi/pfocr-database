caption: 'Potential mechanism of CA125 elevation in presence of DR inferred from cardiovascular
  diseases. Serum CA125 elevation in cardiovascular diseases was in response to inflammatory
  stimulation, cytokines overexpression including IL-6 and TNF-α and congestion or
  fluid overload. CA125 synthesis is achieved through JNK signaling pathway of mesothelial
  cells. Phosphorylation of JNK signaling pathway lead to polarization to M1 macrophage
  cell, trigger excessive inflammation, cytokines activation including IL-6 and TGF-β
  and cause vessel dilation and hyperplasia in microglial cells of retina. The potential
  mechanism of CA125 elevation in presence of DR may infer from cardiovascular disease
  as dotted lines.Abbreviations: CA125, carbohydrate antigen 125; DR, diabetic retinopathy;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; M1, M1 macrophage cell; IL-6, interleukin-6; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor-α; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β.'
