caption: Proposed pathways involved in the biosynthesis of the S-LPS of B. melitensis.
  Overview of the pathways involved in the biosynthesis of the S-LPS of B. melitensis
  (adapted from Ref. ). The steps leading to N-formylperosamine synthesis and to its
  polymerization are indicated in blue, and those leading to bactoprenol priming for
  N-formylperosamine polymerization are depicted in green. Subsequently, the O-PS
  is translocated to the periplasm by the Wzm/Wzt ABC transporter (also in blue) and
  ligated to the core oligosaccharide that results from the pathways marked in red.
  The LPS phenotypes obtained by disrupting the different steps (indicated by black
  triangles) are annotated (R1, R2, or R3). A white-filled triangle (GDP-mannose pathway)
  indicates a mutation that does not generate an R phenotype, and gray triangles marked
  with S (middle) indicate a mutation that, while blocking the synthesis of a core
  lateral branch, does not prevent O-PS linkage to the core. Enzymes disrupted in
  this study (WadC, Per, WbkD, and ManBcore) are indicated with an ellipse.
