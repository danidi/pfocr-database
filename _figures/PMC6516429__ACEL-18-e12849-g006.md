caption: JNK‐mediated metabolic perturbation promotes proteostatic balance in the
  aging brain. Elevated JNK activity reduces IIS activity systemically, reducing glucose
  uptake, stimulating Foxo activity, and limiting the age‐related activation of the
  Tor pathway, thus reducing translation and maintaining higher levels of autophagy
  (Kapahi et al., ; Sarbassov, Ali, & Sabatini, ; Wang et al., ). At the same time,
  we find that JNK also induces the expression of G6PD in neurons, shifting metabolic
  carbon flux from glycolysis into the pentose phosphate pathway. The resulting increase
  in NADPH concentration in neurons increases the concentration of reduced glutathione,
  limiting protein damage, and associated protein aggregation. We propose that the
  coordinated control of IIS activity, Tor signaling, and metabolic flux by chronically
  elevated JNK activity thus results in broad proteostatic protection and lifespan
  extension
