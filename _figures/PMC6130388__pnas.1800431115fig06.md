caption: 'Schematic of proposed model. We observe that the core molecular clock component,
  BMAL1, is crucial in promoting Nrf2 transcription in myeloid cells. NRF2 can repress
  IL-1β through two possible mechanisms: direct repression of Il1b transcription or
  induction of antioxidant response elements. This second pathway results in ROS suppression,
  which reduces levels of HIF-1α binding to hypoxia response elements (HRE), preventing
  induction of Il1b transcription. Thus, the molecular clock directly controls NRF2
  transcriptional activity and antioxidant capacity to regulate IL-1β in myeloid cells.'
