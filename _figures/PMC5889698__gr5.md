caption: The Mechanism by which Gelofusine Attenuated Tubulointerstitial Injury Induced
  by cRGD-Conjugated siRNAcRGD-siRNA was reabsorbed and endocytosed into endosomes
  by tubular epithelial cells through binding to megalin/cubilin receptors, followed
  by TLR3 activation in endosomes. The activated TLR3 resulted in IKBA degradation
  and subsequent NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, where it induced the transcription
  of multiple genes, including IL-6 and IFN-β, to promote infiltration of inflammatory
  cells and inflammatory injury. In addition, TLR3 activation could also trigger apoptosis,
  aggravating the existing tubulointerstitial injury via activating caspase-3. However,
  Gelofusine could competitively inhibit the binding of cRGD-siRNA to megalin/cubilin
  receptors, avoiding TLR3 activation in endosomes.
