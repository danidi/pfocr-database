caption: Main enzymes and G protein-coupled receptors in the cyclooxygenase pathway.
  Arachidonic acid is converted to PGG2 by cyclooxygenase 1 or 2 and PGG2 then undergoes
  conversion to PGH2 through the peroxidase activity of COX. Several isomerases convert
  PGH2 to other 2-series prostaglandins, prostacyclins or thromboxanes, which act
  in part by binding to specific prostanoid receptors (green). EPA is thought to serve
  as a substrate for the same set of enzymes to generate three-series eicosanoids
  (PGH3, PGE3, etc.). Some prostanoids have also been shown to bind to PPARs (not
  shown). Official protein symbols are shown in red for enzymes and in green for receptors,
  with common abbreviations in parenthesis. PTGS1–2 prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase
