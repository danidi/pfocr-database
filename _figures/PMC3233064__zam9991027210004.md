caption: 'Major reactions and regulatory controls involved in the arginine utilization
  pathway. The enzymes and transporters shown in this figure are indicated as follows:
  ArtPQM, high-affinity arginine transporter; RocE and RocC, putative arginine permeases;
  RocF, arginase; RocB, putative citrullinase (); RocD, ornithine aminotransferase;
  RocA, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenases; RocG, glutamate dehydrogenase;
  and GltAB, glutamate synthase. RocR is a positive regulator of the genes involved
  in the arginine degradation pathway and is activated in the presence of ornithine.
  GltC is a positive regulator of gltAB and is inhibited by the glutamate dehydrogenase
  RocG ().'
