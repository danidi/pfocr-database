caption: The rates of nascent adhesion formation and turnover depend on the velocity
  of membrane protrusion (v), and the formation rate depends also on the density and
  composition of ECM. Nascent adhesions promote further protrusion by mediating activation
  of Rac, utilizing a pathway that is reinforced by positive feedback as shown. Those
  nascent adhesions that are not turned over mature to form stable adhesions, a process
  that is reinforced by myosin-mediated feedback in our model. We also include a mechanism
  whereby stable adhesions directly antagonize protrusion. Stable adhesions disassemble
  over a relatively long time scale, and their influence on processes at the leading
  edge is also diminished by convective (v-dependent) transport.
