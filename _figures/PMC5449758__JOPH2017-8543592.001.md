caption: ROCK-activated vitreoretinal diseases. ROCK activation is involved in the
  pathology of retinal vitreous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related
  macular degeneration, and PVR, termed as “ROCK-activated diseases.” In each disease,
  the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway is activated by various cytokines, implicating ROCK
  in various pathology. Therefore, ROCK is a potential therapeutic target for these
  vitreoretinal diseases.
