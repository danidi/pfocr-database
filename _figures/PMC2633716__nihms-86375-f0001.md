caption: Circulating calcium and calcium in the colon lumen binds to CASR to activate
  signaling pathways involved in cell growth control and differentiation. Active vitamin
  D (1,25(OH)2) binds to the nuclear receptor VDR, which directly regulates the transcription
  of CASR through binding to two vitamin D response elements (VDRE) in the CASR promoter
  regions. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) can be activated within the colon cell to
  1,25(OH)2 by 1-α hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and deactivated by 24-α hydroxylase (CYP24A1).
