caption: The ABP1 auxin signaling pathway. Extracellular-localized ABP1 is tethered
  to the plasma membrane by CBP1. ABP1 interacts with TMK receptors in an auxin-dependent
  manner. ROP activity is regulated downstream of auxin perception by the ABP1-TMK
  complex. In the epidermal pavement cells of the Arabidopsis cotyledon, ROP2 and
  RIC4 positively regulate actin polymerization to form lobes and also affect PIN1
  protein localization to alter auxin efflux. Alternatively, ROP6 and RIC1 positively
  regulate microtubule polymerization, leading to constrictions that ultimately form
  indentations. The outcome of this pathway leads to the puzzle-piece morphology of
  these cells.
