caption: CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathway blockade. CTLA-4 blockade allows for activation and
  proliferation of more T-cell clones, and reduces Treg-mediated immunosuppression.
  PD-1 pathway blockade restores the activity of antitumor T cells that have become
  quiescent. A dual pathway blockade could have a synergistic effect, resulting in
  a larger and longer lasting antitumor immune response. CTLA-4 indicates cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1,
  programmed death 1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1; TCR, T-cell receptor; Treg,
  regulatory T cell.
