caption: (A) The y-axis monitors the progress of spatial restriction of the ANE (blue),
  and the x-axis indicates the developmental timing of ANE restriction. Each image
  represents the position of the ANE in time and space. (Step 1) Initially, the maternal
  regulatory state in the absence of Wnt signaling supports ANE specification throughout
  the embryo. Then, nβ-catenin signaling in the posterior half of the embryo activates
  an unknown negative regulatory activity that blocks the accumulation of ANE factors,
  either by blocking their transcription directly or the activity of their ubiquitously
  expressed maternal activators. (Step 2) As development progresses, posterior nβ-catenin
  activates production of at least two Wnt ligands, Wnt1 and Wnt8, that are necessary
  to initiate the ANE restriction mechanism in posterior ectoderm beginning at the
  60-cell stage. These secreted ligands signal through the Wnt receptor, Fzl5/8, activating
  the JNK pathway. The Wnt/JNK pathway progressively down-regulates expression of
  ANE factors during early blastula stages in all but the most anterior ectoderm.
  During Step 1 and possibly Step 2, Fzl1/2/7 signaling attenuates the nβ-catenin-
  and Fzl5/8-JNK-mediated down-regulation of ANE factors, preventing complete shutdown
  of ANE specification. PKC activity also antagonizes Fzl5/8-JNK-mediated ANE restriction,
  downstream of Fzl1/2/7 signaling. (Step 3) Expression of Wnt8, Wnt1, and/or another
  ligand X is activated in more anterior blastomeres. These ligands continue Fzl5/8-mediated
  ANE restriction until the late blastula-stage embryo activates production of the
  secreted Wnt antagonist, Dkk1, via Fzl5/8. Through negative feedback, Dkk1 limits
  Fzl5/8 activity, thereby defining the borders of the ANE. Orange arrows indicate
  the Wnt/β-catenin-mediated mechanism, gray arrows indicate the Wnt/JNK mediated
  mechanism, and red indicates Fzl1/2/7 and PKC interactions. (B) Diagram showing
  the state of the ANE in embryos lacking either Wnt/β-catenin, Fzl5/8 and pJNK, or
  Fzl1/2/7 and pPKC signaling.
