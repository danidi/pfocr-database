caption: The exposure to a high salt condition decreased the protein abundance of
  IFNGR1 in the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells. This IFNGR1 internalization
  suppressed phosphorylation of an activation site of JAK1, thereby inhibiting the
  transcriptional activity of STAT1 through decreasing phosphorylation of its activation
  sites. Finally, the excretion of IFNγ inducible chemokines from proximal tubular
  cells was suppressed. Accordingly, the migration of cytotoxic T cells possessing
  a specific chemokine receptor CXCR3 was presumably decreased.
