caption: Biosynthetic pathway leading to hydrogen sulfide production. Shown is the
  transsulfuration pathway, which involves transfer of sulfur from homocysteine to
  cysteine. Homocysteine is derived from dietary methionine in mammals by the action
  of methionine-adenosyltransferase (MAT) and methyltransferase (MT) and S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase (SAHH). Homocysteine condenses with serine in a condensation reaction
  catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) to produce cystathionine and water.
  Cystathionine is acted on by cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) to generate cysteine. Cysteine
  is used as a substrate by CSE to generate H2S. CBS prefers a combination of cysteine
  and homocysteine to produce H2S and cystathionine. Cysteine is utilized by cysteine
  amino transferase (CAT) to produce 3-mercaptopyruvate, which is the substrate for
  3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3-MST) to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S).
  Homocysteine can also be utilized as a substrate by CSE and CBS to generate H2S.
