caption: Cif hijacks several and various signaling pathways by inhibiting the ubiquitin
  ligase activity of CRL. Cif is injected in the host cells and impairs CRL activity
  via binding to NEDD8. This inhibition results in stabilization of (i) p21 and p27
  leading to cell cycle inhibition; (ii) Cdt1 allowing inappropriate replication;
  (iii) RhoA inducing actin stress fibers; (iv) IkB leading to alteration of inflammatory
  response; (v) β-catenin promoting differentiation process disruption and tolerogenicity;
  (vi) unidentified protein(s) inducing apoptosis.
