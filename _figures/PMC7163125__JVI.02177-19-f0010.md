caption: 'LXA4, a potential therapeutic agent against KSHV. (A) The overall anti-inflammatory
  action of LXA4 in vivo is attributed to its interactions with multiple receptors,
  including (i) direct activation of ALX as a receptor agonist and (ii) direct activation
  of the nuclear receptor AhR. (B) Lipoxin modulates hedgehog signaling and adaptive
  immunity in KSHV-infected cells. Previous work from Sharma-Walia’s lab (, ) has
  shown that the ALX/FPR receptor is vital for LXA4 signaling and that blocking this
  receptor elevates the levels of NF-κB, ERK, and COX-2. LXA4 downregulates the AKT
  pathway in KS-IMM cells and KSHV-infected primary endothelial cells. In the present
  study, we postulate that LXA4 may be an endogenous ligand that facilitates the translocation
  of AhR into the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator
  (ARNT). AhR-ARNT induces the transcription of target genes by the recruitment of
  various components of the transcriptional machinery, such as ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling
  components, such as Brg-1 (the mechanism has been explored in other systems but
  has yet to be proved in KSHV-infected cells). The proposed mechanism of action of
  LXA4 is based on our two current findings: (i) the interaction of LXA4 with nucleosome
  complex components possibly mediated by AhR and (ii) the overall decreased expression
  of Gli-1 in LXA4-treated PEL cells compared to that in untreated PEL cells. LXA4
  inhibits Gli-1 expression noncanonically at the cytoplasmic level through AMPK activation
  (indicated by “1 Cytoplasm”). The AKT pathway is regulated by AMPK and, in turn,
  regulates the mTOR/S6 kinase 1 pathway. The phosphorylation of Gli-1 at the Thr
  1074 site in LXA4-treated PEL cells suggests the direct inhibition of hedgehog signaling
  mediated through AMPK. LXA4 treatment decreased PD-L1 expression, which is related
  to a decrease in AKT activation and the associated inflammation in LXA4-treated
  BCBL-1 cells. LXA4 also inhibits Gli-1 expression noncanonically at the nuclear
  level (indicated by “2 Nucleus”). LXA4 treatment of KSHV-infected BCBL-1 cell inhibited
  HDAC expression and increased SMARCB1 expression. SMARCB1 directly interacts with
  Gli-1 to repress its transcriptional activity. SMARCB1, importantly, regulates RTA
  epigenetically to initiate and carry viral lytic gene replication and viral progression.'
