caption: 'Relationship between a network of DEGs and the canonical calcium signaling
  pathway. (A) Differential expression analysis of 23,610 genes and volcano plot representation
  of DEGs. The negative log10-transformed adjusted p-value was plotted against the
  log ratios (fold change) between AA and LV. Red dots represent 236 and 105 DEGs
  in AA and LV, respectively, that show both at least 8-fold changes and high statistical
  significance (FDR < 0.01). (B) DEGs were categorized into five groups including
  protein-coding, lincRNA, pseudogene, antisense RNA, and others (processed transcript
  and sense intronic). Numbers of DEGs in each category are marked on the bar graph.
  (C) The top scoring IPA network related to DEGs: ‘Cardiovascular System Development
  and Function, Embryonic development, Organ development’. Up- (red) and down- (green)
  regulated genes (nodes) are indicated. Orange and blue lines indicate prediction
  of activation and inhibition, respectively, while gray lines indicate no prediction
  for direction of changes. Solid and dashed lines represent direct and indirect relations,
  respectively. Calcium signaling is shown as a pathway that has the highest prediction
  of activation. CP, canonical pathway. The networks were generated through IPA (QIAGEN
  Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).'
