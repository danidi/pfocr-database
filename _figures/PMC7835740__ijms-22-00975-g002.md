caption: 'The regulation of autophagy and related brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathways
  by PP2A. PP2A involvement is shown by red characters/arrows. TORC has various subcellular
  localizations in plants. We concentrate on autophagic pathways, therefore do not
  present here the whole signaling pathways mediated by blocking of TOR kinase signaling
  and by BR. Different pathways are indicated by numbers. Pathway 1: the autophagy
  pathway induced by inhibition of TOR kinase. The PP2A–AMPK relationship is still
  uncertain in plants, this is shown by a question mark. Pathway 2: induction of SBI1
  methylase to remove excess BRI1. Pathway 3: induction of autophagy genes by activated
  BES1/BZR1, a result of BR signaling. Pathway 4: targeting of inactive BES1/BZR1
  to the autophagy pathway. More details can be found in text. The upper/right part
  of the figure shows that during carbohydrate starvation, PP2A can be both activated
  and inhibited (Pathways 1 vs. 4). This may depend on the cell type dependent variation
  of (B and/or A) regulatory subunits. AMPK—AMP activated kinase; BR—brassinosteroid;
  BRI1 and BAK 1 is the BR receptor complex; LV—lytic vacuole, PM—plasma membrane.
