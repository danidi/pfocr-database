caption: (A–D) Possible model of joint formation in developing limbs. Joint initiation
  occurs at the specific locations by diverting the chondrogenic differentiation pathway
  to a pathway leading to the formation of the interzone, which is followed by differentiation
  into a variety of joint components. (A) Joint initiation arises at a specific location
  within the mesenchymal condensations. (B) The loss of chondrogenic characters is
  demonstrated by a decreased level of Sox9, Col9, Col2, and Acan at the prospective
  joint sites. (C) c-Jun is essential for activating canonical Wnt activities during
  interzone formation by inducing expressions of Wnt9a and Wnt16. The expression of
  early interzone marker genes such as Autotaxin and Chordin is up-regulated in response
  to these signals. (D) c-Jun also contributes to maintaining the joint-specific environment
  during subsequent cavitation and the maturation of joints.
