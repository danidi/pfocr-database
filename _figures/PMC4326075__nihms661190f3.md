caption: 'Regulators of the photoperiodic flowering pathway: Flowering under inductive
  long days requires a peak of FT expression in the late afternoon. CO transcription,
  CO protein stability, and FT transcription are critical to the photoperiodic flowering
  response. Blue light promotes flowering through FKF1 dependent degradation of CDFs
  and stabilization of CO protein, direct activation of FT through CIB transcription
  factors, and stabilization of the COP1/SPA1 complex by CRY2, which normally destabilizes
  CO protein in the dark. Red light inhibits flowering through destabilization of
  CO protein by PHYB. Far-red light promotes flowering through increased stability
  of CO protein by PHYA. Low temperature destabilizes CO protein through HOS1. The
  promotion or inhibition of each respective component can affect the flowering output,
  and thus serves to integrate multiple environmental signals such as day length,
  light quality, and temperature.'
