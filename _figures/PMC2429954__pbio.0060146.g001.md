caption: Enzymes are labeled next to their respective reactions, indicated by dark
  green arrows for the leucine and valine biosynthesis pathways, and light green for
  the isoleucine pathway. Metabolites are shown as blue circles, with the final end
  products and the key intermediate αIPM labeled on the figure. Allosteric regulation
  of enzymes by end products is shown by the black lines. The transcription factors
  Gcn4 and Leu3 are shown as boxes, with arrows to the genes displaying the fact that
  they are thought to potentially regulate all the genes in the pathway. Leu3 activity
  is dependent on αIPM level, as shown by the red arrow. For completeness, we include
  the arrow showing that Leu3 expression is thought to be Gcn4-dependent. See the
  text for further description on how the pathway is thought to be activated under
  starvation conditions.
