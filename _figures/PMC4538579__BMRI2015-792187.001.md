caption: BAFF-induced activation of NF-κB signaling and increased expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines as procachectic mediators. BAFF interacts with three receptors from the
  TNF ligand/receptor superfamily, BAFF-R, TACI, and (with lower affinity) BCMA [].
  Upon activation, BCMA signal transduction goes through TNF receptor associated factors
  (TRAFs) 5 and 6 [], whereas TACI signals through TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 []. TRAF2
  and TRAF5 activate IκB kinase (IKK) via TAK-1 kinase (the canonical NF-κB pathway)
  []. Follow-up phosphorylation of NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IκBα) induces ubiquitination
  of IκBα and its proteasome degradation []. In this way, IκBα is released from the
  phosphorylated heterodimer p50-p65, and p50-p65 then migrates to the nucleus [].
  BAFF-R signaling starts with TRAF2 and TRAF3 degradation and accumulation of NF-κB
  inducing kinase (NIK) []. In this noncanonical NF-κB pathway, NIK phosphorylates
  inhibitor of NF-κB kinase alpha (IKKα) []. IKKα then induces cleavage of p100 protein
  in the p100-RelB complex into a p52-RelB complex which acts as a modulator of nuclear
  gene transcription []. Both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways regulate the
  expression of genes encoding IL-1β [, ], IL-2 [], IL-6 [, ], and TNF-α []. Proinflammatory
  cytokines participate in manifestation of cancer cachexia symptoms such as insulin
  resistance [], fever [], inflammation [], and muscle [–] and fat tissue wasting
  [, , ].
