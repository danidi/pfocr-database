caption: Proposed signaling pathway involved in protectin D1 expression induced by
  Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 strain (CBM 588) against antibiotic-induced inflammation.
  CBM 588 stimulated poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism, and PUFAs served
  as ligands of G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) on Th2 cells. It was speculated
  that the stimulated Th2 cells produced IL-4 and activated 15-LOX, resulting in the
  induction of protectin D1. In addition, protectin D1 induced anti-inflammatory cytokines
  to control antibiotic-induced gut inflammation through IL-10 upregulation. Solid
  arrows indicate the results of the present study.
