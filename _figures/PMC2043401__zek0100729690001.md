caption: A schematic outline of fatty acid synthesis in apicomplexans. Enzymes that
  are engaged in fatty acid synthesis are shown in red, those providing precursors
  in blue. Glycolysis in the cytoplasm produces phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is
  imported into the apicoplast by triosephosphate transporters (TPTs) and converted
  to acetyl-CoA by the subsequent action of PK and PDH. Acetyl-CoA (Act-CoA) and malonyl-CoA
  (Mal-CoA) produced by ACCase are funneled into the apicoplast FASII pathway (FabD,
  -H, -G, -Z, -I, and -B/F), resulting in the formation of fatty acids (FA) and octanoyl-ACP
  (Oct-ACP). The latter is the precursor for PDH lipoylation. The activity of endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER)-resident ELO results in the production of long-chain fatty acids
  (LCFA) used for phospholipid (PL) synthesis. Substrates for ELO might be host cell-derived
  or apicoplast-produced fatty acids (the source of malonyl-CoA is unclear; in T.
  gondii and C. parvum, it might be supplied by ACCase2). FASI likely acts as an elongating
  enzyme, and the products of PKS are currently unknown (the presence of FASI, PKS,
  and ACCase2 appears linked). Note that these pathways occur in different combinations
  in different apicomplexans and that the compartmentalization and activity shown
  for some of the enzymes has not been experimentally validated yet. HK, hexokinase;
  PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; ALD, aldolase; TPI, triose
  phosphate isomerase; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
