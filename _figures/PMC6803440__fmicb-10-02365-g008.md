caption: Undirected pairwise correlation network (left) highlighting volatile acids,
  aldehydes, alcohols, and hydrocarbons produced during simulated anaerobic soil disinfestation
  (ASD) established using rice bran amendment at a rate of 20 t ha–1. The WGCNA network
  determines network neighborhoods (brown and blue metabolic modules) associated with
  the latter, anaerobic stages of the process (also see ). Production of many of these
  metabolites is associated with this anaerobic stage and, where all metabolites are
  present as demonstrated by the production of C6 compounds (right), co-production
  may outline a putative pathway contributed by one or more community members of the
  transitioning microbiome. Triacylglycerides or glycerolipids, most of which are
  members of the turquoise module, are suggested as possible sources of substrate
  for volatile organic compound production. Compounds outlined in the putative pathway
  are highlighted in red in the network.
