caption: Summary of the origins of the two-carbon unit in the biosynthesis. (A) YerE
  catalyzed the attachment of the C2 branched chain onto sugar from pyruvate by a
  ThDP-dependent decarboxylation process. (B) A hydroxymalonyl-ACP derived from the
  glycolytic pathway as an extender unit for PKS involved in the biosynthesis of zwittermicin.
  (C) A unique NRPS extender unit derived from ketose phosphates through (α,β-dihydroxyethyl)-ThDP
  and a lipoyl group-tethered ester intermediate catalyzed by the TKase-ACP platform
  in the context of NDM and QNC biosynthesis.
