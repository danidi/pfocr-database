caption: Schematic representation of the two-component and the multistep phosphorelay
  signaling systems. A, The prototypical two-component pathway uses a single phosphoryl
  transfer event between a His protein kinase and its cognate response regulator.
  B, The multistep His-to-Asp phosphorelay system in which a His-containing phosphotransfer
  protein serves as a phosphoryl acceptor and donor between the hybrid protein kinase
  and the response regulator. In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) osmosensing, the
  phosphorelay connects to an MAPK cascade (). In Arabidopsis cytokinin signaling,
  a response regulator directly regulates its target gene expression (). The vertical
  bars represent transmembrane domains. H, His; D, Asp; P, phosphoryl group.
