caption: 'a, WKM from Tg(β-actin:GFP) donors were dissected, dissociated as single
  cell suspension, and incubated with chemicals at room temperature for 4 hrs in a
  round-bottom 96-well plate. Meanwhile, WKM were dissected from RedGlo® zebrafish,
  counted and kept on ice. After the drug treatment, chemicals were washed off and
  cells were resuspended in 0.9 X DPBS + 5% FBS. 20,000 treated green WKM and 80,000
  untreated red WKM were co-injected retro-orbitally into sublethally irradiated capser
  zebrafish (n=10 per chemical). For every independent screening day, negative control
  (DMSO) and positive control (10 μM dmPGE2) were used for normalization and quality
  assurance. The engraftment was measured at 4 wpt (weeks post transplant) by fluorescence
  imaging and ImageJ quantification as described in . b, EET metabolic pathway: arachidonic
  acid is released by PLA2 (phospholipase A2) from the membrane lipid bilayer. EETs
  (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids) are synthesized directly from arachidonic acid by the
  cytochrome P450 family of epoxygenases, especially 2C and 2J in human, and get degraded
  by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), generating DiHET (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids).
  Four isomers of EET exist in vivo: 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12- and 14,15-EET.'
