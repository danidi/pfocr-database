caption: 'A: Standard N-glycosylation pathway in the ER. The early steps in N-glycosylation
  start with the synthesis of a dolichol-linked Man5GlcNAc2 glycan precursor that
  flips to the ER lumen, where it is further elongated with mannoses starting with
  the activity of Alg3p mannosyltransferase. The resulting dolichol-linked Man9GlcNAc2
  precursor is then also glucosylated starting with the activity of Alg6p glucosyltransferase.
  When complete, the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 glycan is transferred en bloc to the nascent
  polypeptide chain. These glycans are then subjected to a protein folding quality
  control process involving de-glucosylation by glucosidases I and II (GI, GII) and
  re-glucosylation glucosyltransferase. B: The engineering strategies used to obtain
  a Y. lipolytica strain that produces glycoproteins homogeneously modified with the
  trimannosyl core N-glycan (Man3GlcNAc2). First, ALG3 was knocked out (1), then Alg6p
  was overexpressed (2), then GII was overexpressed (3), and finally α-1,2-mannosidase
  was overexpressed (4). Conforming to the representation proposed by the Consortium
  for Functional Glycomics Nomenclature Committee, the green and blue spheres represent
  mannose (Man) and glucose (Glc), respectively, and blue squares represent N-acetylglucosamine
  residues (GlcNAc). C: Man3GlcNAc2-glycans can be further modified to any complex-type
  N-glycan structure using a combination of glycosyl-transferases, either in vitro
  or in vivo.'
