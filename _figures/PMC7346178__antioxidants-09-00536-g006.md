caption: Glutamine (Gln) cooperatively regulates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated
  nitric oxide (NO) production. In the presence of Gln, LPS activates the expression
  of SNAT1 and SNAT2 through ERK phosphorylation, which increases Gln uptake and NO
  production. In addition, the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway decreases LPS-mediated NO production,
  but the pathway cannot inhibit LPS-mediated NO overproduction. On the contrary,
  in a Gln-free condition, SNAT1 and SNAT2 expression is low, and ERK phosphorylation
  is minimum, even in the presence of LPS; however, Nrf2 and HO-1 are still expressed,
  inhibiting LPS-mediated NO production. These data indicate that Gln is an essential
  molecule for LPS-mediated NO production.
