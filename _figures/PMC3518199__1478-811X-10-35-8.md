caption: Scheme of the BK-mediated signals linked to MMP-9 expression and brain astrocytic
  migration. Binding of BK to its specific receptors (B2R) stimulates activation of
  Ca2+/PKC-α/Nox2/ROS cascade. MMP-9 transcription is AP-1-dependently regulated by
  an ROS-dependent pathway. This signaling pathway may contribute to sustained expression
  of MMP-9 which is required for cell migration in brain astrocytes (RBA-1 cells).
