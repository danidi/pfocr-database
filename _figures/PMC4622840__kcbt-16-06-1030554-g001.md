caption: 'c-Met-mediated oncogenic signaling (from Peruzzi et al). Activation of c-Met-mediated
  oncogenic signaling occurs most commonly through aberrant paracrine HGF stimulation
  and consequent receptor overexpression or through autocrine HGF production, receptor
  mutation, gene amplification or rearrangement. Increased cell proliferation, survival,
  motility, and extracellular matrix degradation resulting from pathway activation
  contributes to tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis. At least 3 routes of
  pathway intervention have been followed as selective anticancer drug development
  strategies: antagonism of ligand binding, inhibition of TK catalytic function, and
  blockade of interactions between activated receptors and downstream intracellular
  effectors.© American Association for Cancer Research. Reproduced by permission of
