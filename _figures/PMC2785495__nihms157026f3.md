caption: The Moumen Lab showed that hnRNP K and p53 act as co-regulators. This figure
  presents a simplified view of the role of p53 in the DNA damage response pathway
  () alongside hnRNP K functions discovered by the Moumen lab (). a.) Following DNA
  damage due to IR or other insult, b.) proteins ATM and ATR induce DNA PK and CKII
  which phosphorylate p53 and hnRNP K. c.) Phosphorylated hnRNP K and p53 proteins
  bind co-dependently to p53 promoter sites resulting in transcript upregulation for
  a number of DDR genes. d.) P53/hnRNP K targets, p21 and 14-3-3σ halt cell cycle
  progression at G1 and G2 phases respectively. e.) Another p53/hnRNP K target, murine
  double minute ubiquitin ligase (MDM2) plays an inhibitory role by adding ubiquitin
  to p53 and hnRNP K resulting in their degradation.
