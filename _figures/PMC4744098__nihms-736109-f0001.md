caption: Shaded chaperone and co-chaperones are those whose genes were included in
  this study. The first chaperone to interact with the AR as it is translated on the
  ribosome is Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Hsp40. Together, these proteins prevent irreversible
  aggregation of the AR in the cytoplasm. Next, Hip, another Hsp70 co-chaperone, prolongs
  the interaction of the AR and this intermediate chaperone complex. Hop then forms
  a bridge between Hsp70 and Hsp90 using tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which
  mediate protein-protein interactions. Next, co-chaperone p23 binds to Hsp90 to stabilize
  the AR in this intermediate conformation, while Hip, Hop, and Hsp70 dissociate.
  The release of Hop allows other TPR-containing co-chaperones, including FKBP52 and
  SGTA, to compete for the TPR binding site on Hsp90. FKBP52 binding generates the
  final complex prior to hormone binding. Upon hormone binding, the AR is transformed
  into the DNA-binding active state. Hormone binding leads to dissociation of the
  AR from the chaperone complex. However, Hsp70 and Hsp40 re-associate, and assist
  in transporting the AR across the nuclear membrane. In the nucleus, Hsp70 and Bag-1
  (a Hsp70 co-chaperone) are recruited with the AR to promoter regions of AR target
  genes. Bag-1 is thought to upregulate AR transcriptional activity, binding directly
  to the N-terminal domain of the AR which contains its major transactivation function.
  Degradation of structurally unsound AR occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
  CHIP (not depicted), a TPR-containing Hsp70 co-chaperone, interacts with the complex
  at multiple stages to cause dissociation and loss of ligand binding ability. This
  is followed by ubiquitylation and degradation via the proteasome.
