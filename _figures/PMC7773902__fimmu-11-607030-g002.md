caption: A summary of the different therapeutics applied in aGVHD treatment. This
  schematic depicts a summary of recent therapeutics that has been developed to control
  GVHD. Therapeutic approaches are divided to pharmacological drugs mostly aiming
  to target a signaling pathway or cellular therapy that renders vaster regulatory
  effects.
