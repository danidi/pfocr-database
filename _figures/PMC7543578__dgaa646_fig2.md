caption: (A) Sites of action of novel treatments for Graves hyperthyroidism. Four
  (I-IV) mechanisms of action are represented. (I) K1-70 is a human anti-TSH-R blocking
  mAb. (II) Iscalimab is an anti-CD40 mAb blocking CD40-CD40 ligand (CD154) costimulatory
  pathway. (III) ATX-GD-59 is an “apitope” restoring immune tolerance to the TSH-R.
  (IV) Rituximab is an anti-CD20 Mab that inhibits B-cells and reduces autoantibody
  production. (B) Sites of action of novel treatments for Graves orbitopathy. Seven
  (I-VII) mechanisms of action are represented. (I) Mycophenolate has a dual antiproliferative
  effect on B and T cells. (II) Anticytokine therapies inhibit inflammatory molecules,
  for example, proinflammatory cytokines, chemoattractants, adhesion molecules, growth
  factors, etc., and include an anti-IL-6R mAb, tocilizumab, as well as anti-TNFα
  Ab. (III and IV) B cell targeting therapies include rituximab, an anti-CD20 mAb
  causing B cell depletion, and an anti-BAFF mAb (belimumab) preventing BAFF from
  interacting with its receptors. (V) Teprotumumab, an anti-IGF-1R mAb blocking the
  activation of orbital target cells (fibroblasts) with subsequent excess release
  of hydrophilic acidic mucopolysaccharides (GAG) and signaling of IGF-1R has been
  recently cleared by the FDA. (VI) K1-70 is an anti-TSH-R mAb blocking TSH-R activation
  by stimulatory TSH-R-Ab. (VII) Small molecules bind to the transmembrane domain
  of the TSH-R blocking its activation. mAb, monoclonal antibody; BAFF, B cell activating
  factor; CD40L, CD40 ligand; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IL-6R,
  interleukin-6 receptor; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TSH-R, thyrotropin receptor;
  TSH-R-Ab, thyrotropin receptor antibody; MHC class II, major histocompatibility
  class II molecule.
