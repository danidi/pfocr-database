caption: 'The schematic representation of signalling cascades and activation of NF-κB
  and AP-1. The activation of NF-κB and AP-1 begin, in general, with stimulation of
  specific receptors at the cell surface and recruitment of adaptor proteins, which
  targets the external signal for specific transduction pathways controlled by various
  kinases. The NF-κB pathway converges upon a high-molecular mass multiprotein complex
  named IκB kinase (IKK) signalsome, which, in turn, promotes the phosphorylation
  of IκB. This targets IκB for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by 26S proteasome.
  As a consequence, NF-κB is released and rapidly translocated to the nucleus where
  it binds to specific promoter regions of various genes. The IKK signalsome is activated
  by the NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK), which lies immediately upstream of IKKs in the
  NF-κB activation cascades. NIK mutants block TNF-α-and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation.
  Although the upstream signalling pathways that regulate NIK has not been clarified
  yet, there is some evidence to support the involvement of MAPK/ERK kinase kinase-1
  (MEKK1), a kinase upstream of ERK as well as p38 MAPK. Many studies have revealed
  a close association between the MAPK activity and phosphorylation and degradation
  of IκB protein, which facilitates nuclear translocation and subsequent DNA binding
  of NF-κB in various cell systems. Recent reports showed that the NF-κB activation
  is also regulated by the Akt signaling pathway (,). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3-K) activates Akt/protein kinase B via phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Genistein specifically inhibits Akt activity and Akt-mediated
  NF-κB activation. Epiegallocatechin gallate (EGCG) can block the activities of PI3-K
  and Akt. There is crosstalk between the Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways- Akt phosphorylation
  leads to activation of NF-κB by stimulating IκB kinase (IKK) activity. IKK is also
  a target of chemopreventive phytochemicals, including curcumin, resveratrol and
  EGCG (see text for details). AP-1 heterodimers are constitutively localized within
  the nucleus, and transactivation of AP-1 is achieved through phosphorylation of
  its activation domain by MAPK. The MAPK family proteins have been shown to play
  a key role in regulating AP-1 activation in various types of cells in culture. AP-1
  represents a heterogenous set of dimeric proteins consisting of members of Jun,
  Fos, and ATF families. AP-1 mRNA expression is dependent on MAPKs: ERK1/2 phosphorylates
  Elk-1, JNK phosphorylates ATF-2 and c-Jun in c-fos and c-jun induction, respectively,
  while p38 phosphorylates both Elk-1 and ATF-2. c-Fos and c-Jun form heterodimers
  and bind to AP-1 response element in the promoter of target genes. The target molecule/event
  blocked/inactivated by chemopreventive phytochemicals is marked with a symbol (⦸).'
