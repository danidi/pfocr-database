caption: Schematic of canonical TGF-β signaling within distinct cell types located
  in tumor microenvironments. TGF-β predominantly activates a Smad2/3-based pathway
  in fibroblasts, epithelial, and immune cells (left panel), and in endothelial cells
  subjected to high TGF-β concentrations (right panel). In contrast, endothelial cells
  subjected to low TGF-β concentrations activate a Smad1/5/8-based pathway (middle
  panel). In general, TGF-β in the extracellular space binds either to TβR-III or
  endoglin, both of which present TGF-β to TβR-II. In some cells, TGF-β can bind directly
  to TβR-II independent of TβR-III or endoglin expression on the cell membrane. TβR-II
  bound to TGF-β then recruits, transphosphorylates, and activates the TβR-I isozymes,
  ALK-5 and ALK-1. Activated TβR-I/ALK-5 or TβR-I/ALK-1 then phosphorylate and activate
  Smad2/3 or Smad1/5/8, respectively, which then form heteromeric complexes with Smad4
  that readily accumulate in the nucleus to regulate changes in gene expression in
  a cell- and context-specific manner.
