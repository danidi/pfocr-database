caption: The accumulation of ceramide can be generated from three main pathways (sphingomyelin
  hydrolysis, de novo synthesis, or salvage pathway) or exogenously added (in the
  form of short chain ceramides), whereas the degradation of ceramide is facilitated
  by four main enzymes (SMS, GCS, CDase, and CerK). At a steady state, the level of
  ceramide is held stable, as flux through the system remains fairly constant. However,
  similarly to increasing flow through the faucet or clogging the drain, increasing
  the generation of ceramide or preventing its degradation can lead to an accumulation
  of ceramide, which can be selectively toxic to cancer cells.
