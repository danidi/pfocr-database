caption: Cilia-dependent and independent activation of Gli proteins. Both Gli1 and
  Gli2 are activated by Smo-mediated Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway inside the cilia,
  leading to maximal activation (thick arrows) of target gene transcription (Foxa2).
  Outside of the cilia, Smo partially activates Gli1 and lower levels of transcriptional
  response (arrows with dashed lines, Nkx2.2 and Olig2). There is no direct evidence
  for cilia-independent Gli2 activation, but this possibility cannot be completely
  ruled out yet.
