caption: Putative target gene interaction network graph generated using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis of miR-34 and miR-181 family miRNAs nodes within a simulated cell.
  Target mRNA interactions are denoted by green and blue edges for the seed sequences
  GGCAGUG and ACAUUCA using high stringency target predictions (TargetScan) and experimental
  observation for miR-34 and miR-181, respectively. Protein–protein interactions between
  miRNA targets are illustrated in pink. Gene ontologies related to neural functions
  are projected from the right side (grey lines) with the highest number of interactions
  at the top (axonal guidance signaling) and the least at the bottom (neuregulin signaling).
