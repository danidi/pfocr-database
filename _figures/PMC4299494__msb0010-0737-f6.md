caption: Nac plays a role in purine metabolism and a larger role in nitrogen metabolism
  than previously known. Nac also regulates Lrp through gcvB.Cra regulates tnaCAB,
  which is also subject to Crp regulation.MntR plays a regulatory role for four genes
  that are heavily regulated by ArcA/Fnr/Fur/PdhR and are utilized during anaerobic
  conditions.
