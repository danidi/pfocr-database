caption: Evolution of glutamate acetylation from a primordial N- acetyltransferase.
  The recruitment of a primordial N-acetyltransferase for L-glutamate acetylation
  in the first step of arginine biosynthesis has been made according to at least three
  different evolutionary ways. The events of gene duplication and gene fusion that
  allowed evolution toward either the two-domain N-acetylglutamate synthase (EC 2.3.1.1)
  or the bifunctional argH(A) fusion are schematized. This scheme does not specify
  whether the argH(A) fusion arose in an organism originally devoid of NAGS or in
  an organism having lost NAGS. The yellow domains in contemporary proteins (bottom
  line) are bearing the ArgA activity (EC 2.3.1.1). The contemporary proteins that
  have been experimentally studied are indicated between brackets.
