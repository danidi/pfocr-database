caption: PLP biosynthesis by the R5P-dependent pathway (PdxS/PdxT) in G. stearothermophilus.
  A, glutaminase reaction of PdxT. B, synthase reactions of PdxS. I1 forms upon R5P
  addition to Lys-81, I2 upon ammonia addition to I1, and PLP upon G3P addition to
  I2. A proposed structure () for the I2 chromophore is shown.
