caption: The illustration highlights the similarities and differences between budding
  yeast and mammals. The mechanism in both organisms involves i. end resection, ii.
  annealing of MHs, iii. flap removal, iv. fill-in synthesis, and v. ligation (see
  text for details). In S. cerevisiae, Exo1 or Sgs1-Dna2 can substitute for MRX and
  Sae2 to initiate end resection at endonuclease-induced DSBs.
