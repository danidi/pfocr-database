caption: Cyclic AMP-mediated induction of Treg cells and suppression of effector T
  cells. (A) The lymphoid infiltrate around solid tumours is inhibited by peripherally
  induced regulatory T cells exposed to a chronic antigenic stimulation and inflammation.
  Similarly, chronic infections such as by the HIV virus provide a continued antigenic
  stimulation leading to induction of a chronic inflammatory state and immunosuppression.
  (B) Continuous activation of T cells results in generation of adaptive Tregs that
  express COX-2, leading to PGE2 production. Increased PGE2 levels stimulate further
  FOXP3 expression in Treg cells in addition to inhibiting effector T cell function.
  Furthermore, naturally occurring Tregs have high cAMP levels and mediate their suppressive
  function by transferring cAMP to responder T cells through gap junctions. In addition,
  the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 expressed on naturally occurring Tregs degrade ATP/ADP
  and catalyze the generation of adenosine, acting via the adenosine A2a receptor
  on activated effector T cells and thereby suppressing their function by intracellular
  production of cAMP. Finally, T cell inhibition and induction of FOXP3 due to PGE2
  secretion can also be a result of LPS-activated monocytes secreting PGE2. (C) In
  T cells, cAMP inhibits TCR-induced T cell activation and thereby exerts important
  immunoregulatory functions through a receptor – G protein – AC – cAMP – PKA type
  I – Csk inhibitory pathway assembled in T cell lipid rafts and acting on the Src
  family kinase Lck. (D) Ezrin serves to link transmembrane receptors such as CD43
  to the actin cytoskeleton via its N-terminal FERM domain and with F-actin via its
  C-terminus. In T cell lipid rafts, ezrin functions as an AKAP, bringing PKA type
  I in the proximity to its downstream substrate Csk by forming a supramolecular signalling
  complex consisting of PKA type I, ezrin, EBP50, Cbp/PAG and Csk.
