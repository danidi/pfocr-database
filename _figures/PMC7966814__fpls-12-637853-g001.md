caption: Microbes interfere with chloroplast functions. (a) Activated nucleotide-binding
  leucine-rich repeat domain-containing receptors (NLRs) activate MPK3 and MPK6 through
  unknown mechanisms, regulating the immune responses by increasing the expression
  of immune-related genes. (b) Once pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered
  immune signals are transported to the chloroplast, Ca2+ flows out from the thylakoid
  lumen to the stroma through the calcium-sensing (CAS) receptor, transmitting the
  signals to the nucleus via the retrograde signaling pathway, eliciting immune response.
  SsITL interacts with CAS to inhibit salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and promotes
  infection. (c) Phosphorylated LHCB5 exists as a dimer or trimer instead of a monomer,
  which weakens the interaction with PsbS and then weakens non-photochemical quenching
  (NPQ), promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). S. sclerotiorum
  secretes oxalate during infection to acidify the host tissue and accelerates the
  synthesis of zeaxanthin from violaxanthin, which reduced the production of ROS and
  ABA. (d) The CP protein of the virus interacts with PsbS as dimers in the cytoplasm
  to sequestrate PsbS from functioning. (e) Proteins enter the chloroplast by interacting
  with the translocator located in the inner membrane (TIC)/outer membrane (TOC) on
  the chloroplast membrane via chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). Moreover, the cTP
  of cpHsp70 protein is age selective and the Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) virus interacts
  with it to preferentially enter the mature chloroplasts for more energy. (f) Pst_12806
  interacts with TaISP protein in chloroplasts to reduce ROS production and thus inhibit
  host cells death. (g) During the infection of P. infestans, CHUP1 anchors chloroplasts
  to the host–pathogen interface and restricts the entry of pathogen. Meanwhile, P.
  infestans secretes effector AVR3a to inhibit the formation of chloroplast stromules
  to reduce the contact area. (h) The production of ROS in chloroplast increases under
  light conditions.
