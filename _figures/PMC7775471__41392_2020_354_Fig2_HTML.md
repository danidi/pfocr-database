caption: NAD+ in cancer metabolism. Cancer cells rely on glycolysis (pathway in yellow)
  than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (in black) what is called
  the Warburg Effect. The pentose phosphate pathway (in purple), serine synthesis
  (in green), and fatty acid synthesis (in blue) are also upregulated in cancer and
  depend on glycolysis as the core of cancer metabolism. Glutaminolysis (in red) is
  also upregulated as the main nitrogen source. All these pathways require the cofactor
  NAD+/NADH/NADP+/NADPH as essential cofactors to support faster energy production,
  counteract ROS production, and synthesis building blocks for tumor proliferation.
  G6PD glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, GSH glutathione, GSSG glutathione disulfide,
  ROS reactive oxygen species, GAPDH glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, LDH lactate dehydrogenase,
