caption: Constitutive and activated protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) internalization
  are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Unactivated PAR1 cycles constitutively between
  the cell surface and an intracellular compartment, which generates an internal pool
  of uncleaved receptor that functions to rapidly resensitize cells after protease
  cleavage. In contrast, activated PAR1 is phosphorylated, internalized and sorted
  directly to lysosomes for degradation, a process critical for termination of activated
  receptor signalling. Both constitutive and activated PAR1 internalization occur
  through a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathway that is independent of β-arrestins.
  Rather than β-arrestins, the clathrin adaptor (protein) AP-2 binds directly to a
  tyrosine-based motif at the C-terminus of PAR1 to mediate constitutive internalization.
  Interestingly, PAR1 is basally ubiquitinated and ubiquitination appears to negatively
  regulate PAR1 constitutive internalization, perhaps by impeding AP-2 binding. In
  contrast, ubiquitination of activated PAR1 specifies a distinct clathrin-dependent
  internalization pathway that is independent of AP-2. However, both AP-2 and epsin,
  a clathrin adaptor that binds ubiquitin, mediate activated PAR1 internalization
  through clathrin-coated pits but precisely how this occurs remains to be determined.
  Moreover, deubiquitination of PAR1 occurs after activation through mechanisms that
  remain poorly understood.
