caption: Antineoplastic mechanisms of ultrasound. (a) Microbubbles are unevenly stretched
  by ultrasonic waves, causing an unequal distribution of force known as inertial
  cavitation. Microbubbles oscillating in a stable motion reflect stable cavitation,
  while the expansion and contraction of microbubbles that are unequal and markedly
  exaggerated are indicative of inertial cavitation. Subsequent stress results in
  microbubble implosion, creating considerable amounts of energy. (b) The energy provided
  by the collapse of microbubbles potentiates the formation of sonoluminescent light
  within the cell. The light subsequently activates endogenous compounds within the
  cell that release ROS when returning to the ground state. (c) Many tumors rely on
  angiogenesis to sustain increased metabolic activity. Microbubbles can enter the
  tumor vasculature, and at sufficiently high amplitudes, ultrasound induces significant
  vascular damage, shutting down blood flow. The vessels develop and harbor hypoxic
  regions, causing oxidative stress; lack of nutrients and increased acidity induce
  apoptosis. In addition, malignant cells exposed to ultrasound often undergo apoptosis
  through the intrinsic pathway. Caspase-3 is upregulated by proteins such as Bax
  and Bak that integrate into the mitochondrial membrane, facilitating apoptotic signaling.
  It is important to note that sonosensitizers have been developed to significantly
  increase the efficacy of each mechanism. Images courtesy of [].
