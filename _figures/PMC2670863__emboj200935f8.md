caption: A model for the reciprocal misregulation of 24p3 and 24p3R expression by
  BCR–ABL. (Left) In normal cells in the presence of IL-3, 24p3 is repressed and 24p3R
  is expressed. (Middle) BCR–ABL activates 24p3 expression by stimulating the JAK/STAT
  pathway, leading to phosphorylation and activation of Stat5, which binds to the
  24p3 promoter and results in transcription activation. Activation of Stat5 through
  Jak kinase-independent mechanisms (dashed line) may also contribute to induction
  of 24p3 transcription in 32D/BCR–ABL cells. Concomitantly, BCR–ABL represses 24p3R
  expression by increasing the levels of Runx1, which recruits the Sin3a–HDAC corepressor
  complex, resulting in 24p3R transcriptional repression. In the absence of 24p3R,
  BCR–ABL+ cells are resistant to 24p3-mediated apoptosis. (Right) In the presence
  of imatinib, which inhibits BCR–ABL kinase activity, Stat5 is inactive and absent
  from the 24p3 promoter. Inhibition of BCR–ABL also results in decreased Ras/MAPK
  signalling, which results in a switch from binding of Runx1 to Runx3 to the 24p3R
  promoter, thereby derepressing 24p3R transcription. In the presence of 24p3R, the
  pool of pre-existing 24p3 triggers apoptosis in BCR–ABL+ cells.
