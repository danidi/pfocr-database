caption: Role of TRAFs in TCR-, costimulatory receptor-, and cytokine receptor-associated
  signaling pathways controlling TFH differentiation. TFH differentiation depends
  on a variety of signals received through the TCR, costimulatory receptors of the
  Ig superfamily (yellow boxes), costimulatory proteins of the TNF receptor superfamily
  (orange boxes), and cytokine receptors (blue boxes). TRAF1, −2, −3, and −6 regulate
  TCR signals but TRAF3 activation depends on additional CD28 signaling. TRAF2 contributes
  to activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway that is critical for TFH differentiation.
  CD28 and ICOS plays a key role in TFH differentiation and can both activate PI3K.
  PI3K activation by ICOS is critical for TFH differentiation as compared to CD28-induced
  PI3K signals. Recently, we revealed that the TANK-binding kinase TBK1 functions
  downstream of ICOS to promote TFH differentiation. TRAFs are not recruited to ICOS
  but the presence of a TRAF-like motif in the intracellular tail of ICOS bypasses
  the need for TRAFs to recruit TBK1. The TNFR family members OX40, GITR, and 4-1BB
  signal through TRAFs and also contribute to TFH differentiation. TRAF2 is involved
  in recruitment and activation of PI3K by OX40. TRAF2 and−5 promote NF-κB pathway
  activation downstream OX40 and GITR while TRAF1 and−2 associate with 4-1BB to promote
  this pathway. TRAF3 plays a regulatory role in OX40 signaling. Signals through type
  1 IFN, IL-6, and IL-21 receptors converge through STAT1 activation, positively regulating
  TFH differentiation. Signaling through IL-6, IL-21, and IL-27 receptors activates
  STAT3 to promote TFH differentiation. TRAF2 and−5 can both inhibit IL-6 mediated
  activation of STAT3. STAT5, a negative regulator of TFH differentiation, can be
  activated by signals through the IL-2 and IL-7 receptors. TRAF3 and−6 both negatively
  regulate IL-2R-induced signaling. Finally, TRAF6 is involved in the suppression
  of IL-2 production in the presence of TGF-β and, thus, could indirectly promote
  early TFH differentiation by limiting signals received through the IL-2R.
