caption: The profiles of a nNOS-positive NOAC (red) and a type 4 OFF CBC (green) are
  projected onto the nNOS-labeled IPL (purple). The substrata of the IPL are indicated
  to the right. nNOS is most concentrated in the substrata 2–3 and 5 and largely absent
  from substratum 4. NOACs mainly ramify in sublayer 3 of the IPL . Glutamate (Glu)
  from cones or exogenous stimulation activates kainate and AMPA receptors (KaR and
  AMPAR), whose responses can be blocked by SYM-2081 (SYM) and GYKI-52466 (GYKI),
  respectively. NO, liberated by NOACs or the NO donor NOC-12, diffuses into CBCs,
  activating sGC, leading to cGMP elevation which stimulates protein kinase G (PKG).
  This pathway can be emulated by 8Br-cGMP application and inhibited by ODQ or KT-5823.
  Endogenous NO synthesis is stimulated by L-arginine and inhibited by 7-NI. The mechanism
  by which the AMPA-dependent glutamate response is inhibited via PKG remains to be
  shown.
