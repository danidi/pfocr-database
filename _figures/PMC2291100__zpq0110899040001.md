caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of Tcm PKS and a comparison of hypothetical
  intermediates for two possible folding pathways. (A) The pathway to Tcm C (1), RM80
  (4), RM80b (5), SEK15 (6), and SEK15b (7). (B) Expansion of the pathway to Tcm F2≈ACP
  detailing the proposed role of Tcm ARO/CYC in chain folding and the regiospecific
  cyclization/aromatization of the first two rings. (C) Possible alternate folding
  pattern of the linear decaketide intermediate results in first-ring cyclization
  between C7 and C12 and second-ring cyclization between C5 and C14.
