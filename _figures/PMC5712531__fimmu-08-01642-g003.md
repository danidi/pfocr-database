caption: 'Model of engulfment by follicle cells in the Drosophila ovary. Apoptotic
  cell recognition (left side): Draper binds to an unknown “eat me” signal (black
  circles) and activates the JNK signaling cascade (Mekk1, Bsk, Cka, Kay, Jra) through
  Shark to mediate engulfment. Eiger may or may not interact with a TNF receptor to
  activate the JNK signaling pathway. α-PS3/β-PS integrin heterodimer signals through
  Spg and Ced-12 to activate Rac1. Rac1 also activates the JNK signaling pathway.
  The Crb/Baz, Par-6, and aPKC polarity proteins are also required for engulfment.
  Dhc64C assists in the trafficking of α-PS3/β-PS. Phagosome maturation (right side):
  Draper is required for nurse cell phagosome maturation. Draper and corpse material
  first become enclosed in Rab-5 positive phagosomes and mature into Rab-7 positive
  phagosomes, until the phagosome fuses with lysosomes for degradation. Shi is required
  for early phagosome maturation. Dor is required for phagosome and lysosome fusion.
  Dashed arrows correspond to proteins that were tested without epistasis analysis
  and have engulfment defects. Question marks correspond to unknown proteins.'
