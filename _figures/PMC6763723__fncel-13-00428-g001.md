caption: VLC-SFA and VLC-PUFA elongation pathways. (A) VLC-SFA biosynthesis pathway.
  Elongation steps are performed by ELOVL1-7. Although some ELOVL family members catalyze
  specific steps in VLC-SFA synthesis, others are multifunctional and may catalyze
  multiple steps. Elongation of C24 substrates also may be performed by ELOVL4 (ELOVL4).
  (B) VLC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway. Desaturation and elongation steps are performed
  by ELOVL1-5, Δ5 Desaturase (fatty acid desaturase-1, FADS1), and Δ6 desaturase (fatty
  acid desaturase-2, FADS2) as indicated. Although some ELOVL family members catalyze
  specific steps in VLC-PUFA synthesis, others are multifunctional and may catalyze
  multiple steps. Elongation of C24 substrates also may be performed by ELOVL4 (ELOVL4).
  (C) VLC-PUFA are incorporated into phosphatidylcholine in the retina. Example shown
  contains the VLC-PUFA, 34:5n3 (green), and the long chain-PUFA, 22:6n3 (DHA). (D)
  VLC-SFA are incorporated into ω-O-acylceramides in the skin. Example shown contains
  the VLC-SFA, 28:0 (green) ω-O-linked with 18:2n3. (E) VLC-SFA are incorporated into
  sphingolipids in the brain. Example shown shows sphingomyelin containing the VLC-SFA,
  30:0 (green) (panels C–E from , used with permission).
