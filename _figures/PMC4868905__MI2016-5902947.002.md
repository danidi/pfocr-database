caption: Metabolic changes triggered by ischemic insult and possible evolutions of
  the injury with the crosstalk between chemokines. The pH decrease, provoked by ischemia,
  is the event turning on the process. The cell membrane is damaged and debris activates
  the classic complement pathway in the infarcted myocardium. ROS, adenosine, and
  complement activate mast cells to produce TNF and histamine, leading to leukocyte
  recruitment from the vessels. Depending on the presence or the absence of reperfusion,
  there is a different crosstalk between chemokines, aimed at restoring the balance.
  Dysregulated or exaggerated responses may actually lead to a progression of the
  disease (see text for details, chemokines in red).
