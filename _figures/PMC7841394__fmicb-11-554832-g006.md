caption: The photosynthesis pathway map for Skeletonema dohrnii during the changes
  of temperature and silicate (HTHS vs. HTLS). The down-regulated proteins were shown
  in light green color boxes and up-regulated proteins are given in red color. The
  comprehensive information of all the regulated proteins associated with photosynthesis
  metabolism are given in , . This image is obtained from KEGG website (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html)
