caption: 'Approximate cellular concentrations of Hsp70, Hsp90, HOP, and CHIP, the
  various complexes they form, and their effects on the folding/degradation balance.
  (A) Determination of the cellular concentrations of Hsp70, Hsp90, HOP, and CHIP
  under normal conditions and upon 17-AAG treatment using quantitative Western blot
  analysis. BT474 breast cancer cells were left untreated or treated with 0.178 µM
  17-AAG for 7 or 14 hours. Total cell lysates from a known number of cells were loaded
  in each lane and blotted for various proteins. Increasing amount of purified recombinant
  Hsp70 (0.02, 0.06, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 µg), Hsp90 (0.02, 0.06, 0.1, 0.14, 0.18 µg), HOP
  (0.005, 0.025, 0.045, 0.065, 0.085 µg), and CHIP (0.0003, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003 µg)
  were run along side for concentration calibration. Dashed line separates the endogenous
  from purified proteins. Cell lysates were also blotted for qualitative comparison
  of HER2 and GAPDH (loading control) levels. (B) A schematic depicting the approximate
  total cellular concentrations of Hsp70, Hsp90 dimer, HOP, and CHIP under normal
  conditions and the dissociation constants between interacting partners. Kd values
  for the interactions of CHIP with Hsp70 and Hsp90 are as determined here and those
  for the interactions of HOP with Hsp70 and Hsp90 are as reported (). (C) Calculated
  approximate concentrations of the various protein complexes formed by Hsp70, Hsp90,
  HOP, and CHIP as well as free protein components (not bound to a co-chaperone).
  Concentrations at normal conditions were calculated based on the total protein concentrations
  and dissociation constants in (B). Concentrations after 17-AAG treatment were calculated
  the same way; only the total Hsp70 concentration was increased from 10 µM to 39
  µM. (D) A schematic depiction of the folding/degradation balance under normal conditions
  based on the concentrations shown in (C). In the cell, 10 µM Hsp70 is a component
  of various complexes depicted in the schematic along with their approximate concentrations:
  Hsp70 can be free of a co-chaperone, bound only to HOP, bound to HOP-Hsp90, or bound
  to CHIP. The folding process of a client protein bound to Hsp70, which is free of
  a co-chaperone or only bound to HOP (~ 9.48 µM), cannot be completed. Client protein
  bound to Hsp70 within the Hsp70/HOP/Hsp90 folding complex (~ 0.43 µM) will be passed
  from Hsp70 to Hsp90 for final steps of maturation. Client protein bound to Hsp70
  which is associated with CHIP (~ 0.083 µM) will be ubiquitinated. Thus, a client
  protein is ~ 5 times more likely to be folded (outcome highlighted in bold) than
  ubiquitinated. There is, however, a low level of client protein ubiquitination.
  (E) A schematic depicting the shift to client protein degradation upon 17-AAG treatment
  based on the concentrations shown in (C). When Hsp90 is inhibited, the amount of
  Hsp70 which is a component of the Hsp70/HOP/Hsp90 folding complex (~ 0.83 µM) and
  Hsp70 which is part of the Hsp70/CHIP degradation complex (~ 0.095 µM) does not
  differ much from the amounts at normal conditions in (D). The client protein thus
  has a similar probability of encountering the Hsp70/HOP/Hsp90 folding complex or
  the Hsp70/CHIP ubiquitination complex under both conditions. Because Hsp90 is inhibited
  upon 17-AAG treatment, however, even if the client protein is bound to Hsp70/HOP/Hsp90
  complex, its folding process will be initiated, but not completed. Although the
  probability of the client proteins to encounter the degradation complex is low,
  all proteins will ultimately be degraded, because there is no alternative pathway.'
