caption: Activation of STAT3 (pTYR 705) represents a signaling event common to neurotoxic
  insults and neuroinflammation. Neurotoxicity-related damage results in astrogliosis
  dependent on activation of STAT3 but does not require upstream signaling from proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines. Suppression of this neuroinflammatory response to neurotoxicity
  does not affect expression of GFAP or pSTAT3. LPS causes brain-wide neuroinflammation
  (represented by flames) characterized by activation of microglia and elaboration
  of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines but not neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation-related
  activation of microglia due to LPS does not lead to astrogliosis but also is associated
  with activation of STAT3 suppressible by glucocorticoids. Neuroinflammation likely
  activates a separate STAT3 pathway, perhaps in microglia. Identification of upstream
  effectors in these STAT3 pathways will aid in defining and manipulating signal transduction
  events that likely play roles in repair and neuroimmune responses.
