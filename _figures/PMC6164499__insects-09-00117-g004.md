caption: 'Cellular PRRs: Toll and Imd pathways. (Left) a schematic view of fungine
  and Gram-positive bacteria stimulation of Toll pathway; the intracellular signal
  transduction involves adaptor proteins as MyD88, Tube and the serine/threonine protein
  kinase Pelle. Upon activation, Toll receptor-adaptor complex signals to a latent
  transcriptional factor, belonging to the NF-kB-Rel family, NF-kB factor is normally
  complexed to an inhibitor protein (IkB-like) named Cactus. The Toll signaling induces
  the degradation of Cactus and dissociation from Rel family proteins (Dorsal and
  Dif). Dif, a member of NF-kB-like proteins, seems to be the main transactivator
  factor responsible for antifungal and anti-Gram positive bacterial defenses. Dif
  translocates into the nucleus and switches on many AMPs (antimicrobial peptides)
  genes, probably several hundred, that in concert contribute to challenge microbial
  infection. (Right) the Imd pathway stimulated by Gram negative bacteria. The Imd
  gene encodes a 25 kDa protein with a death domain, the protein acts upstream of
  an adaptor protein named FADD; furthermore, for a full activation, a caspase-8 like
  protein is required (Dredd). Dredd can directly activate REL protein (Relish). Finally,
  Rel domain after cleavage, moves to the nucleus and activates AMPs genes. Otherwise,
  Relish can be phosphorylated by IKK signaling complex, which is itself activated
  by Tak1 (a MAP kinase) interacting downstream of Imd/FADD.'
