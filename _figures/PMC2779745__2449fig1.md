caption: 'A model presenting the three known stages of R protein-induced PCD in plant
  defense. The three stages of R protein-mediated PCD include the following. (1) Effector
  delivery and recognition: P. syringae (Ps) delivers effector proteins into the host
  cell via the type III secretion system. Interaction of a specific type III effector
  with host effector target (ET) proteins is shown. R protein guarding the ET proteins
  indirectly recognizes the type III effector. (2) Signal-competent state and transduction:
  R protein forms a dynamic complex with other host proteins like HSP90, RAR1, and
  an F-box protein, SGT1b. SGT1b interacts with SKP1, a component of the CUL1 E3 Ub
  ligase, to modify R proteins and/or other regulators of the resistance response.
  (3) PCD execution through the PBA1-dependent vacuolar release: The caspase-3-like
  activity of PBA1 is triggered by the R protein through an unknown mechanism. A negative
  regulator of tonoplast and cytoplasmic membrane fusion is removed by PBA1 through
  either a Ub-dependent (26S) or a Ub-independent (20S) pathway. The release of the
  vacuolar content into the apoplast inhibits bacterial growth and causes host PCD.'
