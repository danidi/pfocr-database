caption: Regulation between actin cytoskeleton and Yap/Yorkie at the apical cell cortex
  in Drosophila and in mammalian cells. (A) In Drosophila cells, cytoplasmic Yki can
  interact with Tsr at the apical cortex and thus prevent cortical F-actin from Tsr-mediated
  severing (left branch of the signalling pathway). In this case, Yki’s concentration
  in the nucleus decreases and the expression of cell proliferation genes is inhibited,
  thus preventing epithelial growth. Conversely, upstream regulatory mechanical or
  molecular stimuli, acting through the apical ECM, allow Yki through Strn-Mlck kinase,
  or independently, to activate Sqh (myosin light chain), which triggers the translocation
  of Yki to the nucleus (right branch of the signalling pathway). Thereby, cell-proliferation
  genes become upregulated and the epithelium grows. (B) In mammalian cells, Cofilin
  in response to low mechanical stresses limits YAP activity in the nucleus. Alternatively,
  the interaction of YAP with Trio/Dia at the apical cortex triggers the nuclear translocation
  of YAP and gene expression. Conversely, the expression of YAP target genes such
  as ARHGEF17, Bcam, S1pr2, and Nuak2 signals to pMLC, whereas the expression of ARHGAP29
  signals to Cofilin, which leads to F-actin severing and growth.
