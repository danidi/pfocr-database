caption: 'Possible origin of WM precursors from IgM+ memory cells. Of human splenic
  and peripheral blood B cells, ~70% are CD27− and ~30% are CD27+. The CD27− cells
  comprise a mixed population that contains both naive IgM+ B cells that express germ
  line IgV genes and IgG+/IgA+ memory B cells that harbor mutated IgV genes (not shown).
  Naive B cells have not yet participated in an immune response and not yet modified
  their expressed IgV genes using the somatic hypermutation (SHM) pathway. In contrast,
  memory B cells are immunologically experienced and have engaged the SHM machinery
  to increase the affinity of the expressed IgV gene to the underlying antigen. The
  CD27+ compartment is composed equally of “switched” IgM− B cells and “unswitched”
  IgM+IgD+ B cells. The former have performed H chain class switch recombination (CSR)
  and, thereby, replaced their μH with γ/α/εH chains, while the latter have not. The
  great majority of CD27+IgM+ cells coexpress IgD (IgM+IgD+)—a compartment that is
  often referred to as “natural effector” memory. CD27+IgM+IgD− B cells, sometimes
  called “IgM-only” cells for short, only represent a minor population (1%) in peripheral
  blood and spleen. Both CD27+IgM+IgD+ and CD27+IgM+IgD− memory B cells may be precursors
  of WM, although the weight of the evidence seems to favor the IgM+IgD+ compartment
  as the stronger candidate. This compartment likely constitutes a mixture of marginal
  zone (MZ)-, B1- and germinal-center- (GC-) derived B cells. The CD27+IgM+IgD− compartment
  is better defined as it originates from a single source: the primary GC response,
  which often selects for mutated IGKV3-20 alleles.'
