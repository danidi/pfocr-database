caption: Example of differences in use between glycolysis and the ED pathway by representative
  cells in our modeled population. The ED pathway requires one-half as much enolase
  flux to metabolize the same amount of glucose as glycolysis, but at the cost of
  substrate-level ATP generation. Slow-growing cells tend to use glycolysis (A), whereas
  intermediate to fast-growing cells tend to use the ED pathway (B).
