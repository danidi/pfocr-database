caption: Schematic view of gK transportation and its role in virus egress. gK binds
  to SPP in the ER, which is necessary for virus replication, although the precise
  binding domain between these two proteins has not been identified yet. gK has a
  signal sequence in its N-terminus, however, it is not clear if this gK signal peptide
  is cleaved by SPP. gK is then transported to the Golgi via a UL20-dependent pathway.
  UL20 is palmitoylated by the host cis-Golgi protein GODZ, and this post-translational
  modification by GODZ is necessary for transport of the gK, and UL20 complex to the
  plasma membrane and virus infectivity. The gK and UL20 complex is also required
  for gB transportation to the cell surface. The complex of three proteins, gB, gK,
  and UL20, is either assembled into virus capsid emerging from the nucleus in a vesicle
  derived from TGN (Upper right) or transported directly to the plasma membrane (Upper
  left).
