caption: Most enriched pathways after Foxa1 knockout in male bladders. Ingenuity pathway
  analysis (IPA) identified inflammatory disease, inflammatory response, and cell
  cycle as the top network after Foxa1 knockout in male bladders. Genes associated
  with this pathway included Clec4d, Clec4e, Nos2, S100a8, Saa3, and Reg3g. In addition,
  IPA identified a potential role for Dmbt1, Kap, Retnla/b, and Serpine1, all which
  are implicated in tumorigenesis.
