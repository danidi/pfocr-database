caption: Endothelial cell release of VWF upon stimulation with DDAVP [,]. VWF is packaged
  into elongated secretory storage organelles designated Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs)
  in endothelial cells. Upon DDAVP stimulation, WPBs release VWF indirectly by acting
  on vasopressin 2 receptors (V2R) that are expressed on lung endothelial cells [].
  Binding of DDAVP to V2R activates a protein kinase (PKA) dependent signaling pathway
  that induces release of WPBs via Gs [,,]. Gs is an alpha subunit of a receptor linked
  hetero-trimeric G protein that activates adenylate cyclase (AC) that catalyzes the
  formation of cAMP. In response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) raising
  agonist a subset of WPBs has been shown to cluster at the microtubule organizing
  centre (MTOC) which is located close to the nucleus. Subsequently, WPBs travel to
  the cell membrane and release VWF.
