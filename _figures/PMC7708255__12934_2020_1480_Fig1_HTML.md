  dzl mutant. Dashed arrow implies intermediate enzymes and products. The enzymes
  in red were targeted by CRISPR-Cas9 RNP mutagenesis. The grey or light grey-colored
  pigments were removed in the LCYE or ZEP knockout mutants, respectively. The bold
  arrow indicates that lycopene flux is concentrated in the dzl
