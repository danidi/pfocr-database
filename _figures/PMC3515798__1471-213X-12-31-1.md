caption: Schematic comparison of O2 and prolyl 4-hydroxylase signaling in animals
  and protists. (A) The upper panel shows current thinking about how O2- and α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG)-dependent hydroxylation of 2 Pro residues of HIFα by PHD2 generates a degron
  recognized by E3VBCUb-ligase leading to its poly-ubiquitination and degradation
  in the 26S-proteasome, thereby interfering with its heterodimerization with HIFβ
  and induction of genes appropriate to response to low O2[,]. (B) The lower panel
  shows current thinking [] about how the protist ortholog PhyA leads to hydroxylation
  and multi-step glycosylation of Pro143 (in Dictyostelium). Hydroxylation of Skp1
  does not generate a degron [], but it and glycosylation may affect interaction with
  F-box proteins (gray implies reduced activity; unpublished data) and consequently
  the poly-ubiquitination activity and proteasomal degradation of F-box proteins and/or
  substrates of the F-box proteins. Homology of elongin C of the E3VBCUb-ligase with
  Skp1 of the E3SCFUb-ligase is emphasized by the dotted purple line connecting their
  Ub-ligases.
