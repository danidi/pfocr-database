caption: 'Simplified native E. coli UQ-8 and menaquinone-8 pathways and recombinant
  carotenoid pathways introduced into noncarotenogenic E. coli to direct C30 and C40
  carotenoid biosynthesis are depicted. Recombinant enzymes overexpressed in this
  study in E. coli are boxed. Carotenoid desaturases were overexpressed in E. coli
  to investigate the production of UQs with conjugated prenyl side chains from E.
  coli''s native UQ-8 pathway. C20 GGPP synthase (CrtE) and C15 FPP synthase (IspA)
  (boxed), in addition to C25 FGPP synthase (Fgs), and C50 DPP synthase (Dds) (not
  depicted), were coexpressed with C30 carotenoid desaturase CrtN in E. coli to investigate
  synthesis of UQs with shorter and longer desaturated prenyl chains. The central
  three CDBs characteristic for carotenoids are highlighted. Isoprenoid enzymes are
  as follows: IDI, IPP isomerase; IspA, FPP synthase; IspB, OPP synthase. Carotenoid
  enzymes are as follows: CrtM, diapophytoene synthase; CrtN, diapophytoene desaturase;
  CrtE, GGPP synthase; CrtB, phytoene synthase; CrtI, phytoene desaturase; CrtI14,
  in vitro-evolved phytoene desaturase. Quinone enzymes are as follows: UbiA, p-hydroxybenzoic
  acid octaprenyl transferase; MenA, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate octaprenyltransferase.
  GPP, geranyl diphosphate.'
