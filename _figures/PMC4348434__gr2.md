caption: The oxidative Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle is the most central metabolic
  pathway for all life on Earth since it yields the necessary carbon intermediates
  required for either ATP formation or genesis of biomolecules like amino acids, lipids,
  and nucleotides. Different sources of carbon including glucose (and other monosaccharides),
  fatty acids, and amino acids are converted into common intermediates acetyl-CoA,
  oxaloacetate, and 2-oxoglutarate, Krebs cycle intermediates that are then systematically
  stripped of electrons (oxidized) to yield electron carriers NADH and succinate which
  are then oxidized by the respiratory chain for ATP production. Note that enzymes
  Idh and Gdh can utilize either NAD+ or NADP+ as cofactors which is isozyme dependent.
  Irreversible steps of the Krebs cycle involve enzymes that couple decarboxylation
  to electron movement. For clarity key metabolic cascades involved in the conversion
  of glucose and fatty acids into key intermediates, pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, have
  been omitted. Pdh; pyruvate dehydrogenase, PC; pyruvate carboxylase, CS; citrate
