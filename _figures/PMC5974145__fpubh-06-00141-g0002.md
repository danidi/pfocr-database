caption: Schematic view of (A) estradiol and (B) progesterone signaling in neural
  cells through both classical and non-classical pathways. In the classical signaling
  pathway (right) the steroid hormone binds to its receptor located in the cytoplasm;
  the activated receptor dimerizes and makes its way into the nucleus where it interacts
  with responsive elements to activate or inhibit gene transcription. Also steroid
  hormones can bind to mitochondrial receptors that regulate mitochondrial DNA transcription.
  In the non-classical pathway (left) steroid hormones act through membrane receptors,
  including the classical receptors, GPCR receptors, ionotropic receptors, tyrosine
  kinase receptors, and other neurotransmitter receptors. This non-classical pathway
  initiates cytosolic signaling cascades, modulating the activation of various proteins
  and of second messenger systems. Additionally, progesterone and its metabolites
  promote myelination and remyelination at the oligodendrocyte level in the CNS and
  that of Schwann cells in the PNS.
