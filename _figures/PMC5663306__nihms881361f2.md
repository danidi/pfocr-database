caption: A. Primary bile acids are metabolized to other bile acids in the liver and
  intestine. In mice, CDCA is converted to α-MCA, β-MCA, and ω-MCA. In humans and
  mice, CDCA can be converted to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or hyocholic acid. UDCA
  can be 7-dehydroxylated to LCA, which can be hydroxylated to hyodeoxycholic acid
  and muricholic acid. B. Bile acids can be conjugated to the amino acids taurine
  or glycine at the C24OOH group by bile acid Co-A synthase (BACS) and bile acid amino
  transferase (BAAT). Sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) transfers a sulfate to the 3β-HO
  position. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) transfers a glucuronide group to the
  C3-OH, C7-OH, and C24-OOH groups. In the intestine, FXR induces fibroblast growth
  factor (FGF) 15, which is secreted into portal circulation to activate the FGF receptor
  4/β-klotho complex, which activates ERK1/2 and JNK of the MAPK pathway to inhibit
  bile acid synthesis.
