caption: 'Scheme showing the Ca2+ pathways that have been shown to be involved in
  the modulation of aging and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. In red: genes that
  have been mutated to induce neurodegeneration by increasing Ca2+ entry from the
  extracellular medium; this includes Ca2+ entry through the clhm-1 and trp-4 Ca2+
  channels, and through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nonselective cation channel
  with mutated deg-3 or acr-2 subunits. It also includes the mutated mec-4 mechanosensitive
  Na+ channel, whose activation produces plasma membrane depolarization and activation
  of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels such as egl-19, unc-2, or cca-1. In green: genes
  whose inactivation has been shown to produce protection in C. elegans models of
  neurodegeneration or increase longevity; this includes the Ca2+-binding ER chaperone
  proteins calreticulin (crt-1) and calnexin (cnx-1), the ER Ca2+ channels IP3R (itr-1)
  and RyR (unc-68), and the mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters, both the mitochondrial
  Ca2+ uniporter (mcu-1) and the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (gene not yet identified
  within the large C. elegans ncx-1 to 10 family []). Finally, in purple: genes whose
  modulation has produced in some cases neurotoxicity and in others neuroprotection;
  this group includes the SERCA Ca2+ pump (sca-1) and the Ca2+ pump of the secretory
  pathway (pmr-1, placed in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus (GAp)). The figure
  also shows some of the most used inhibitors of Ca2+ pathways, thapsigargin for the
  SERCA pump, dantrolene for the RyR and CGP37157 for the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.
  The presenilin homologue sel-12 gene is depicted in the ER membrane, close to the
  ER-mitochondria contacts.'
