caption: Homocysteine metabolism in the liver. Homocysteine (Hcy) is methylated to
  methionine (Met) by cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MS) and betaine homocysteine
  S-methyltransferase (BHMT) using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) and betaine
  (Bet) as the methyl donors, respectively. Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) adenylates
  Met to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is a methyl donor for numerous SAM-dependent
  methyltransferases in the cell. SAM-dependent methyl transfer yields a methylated
  product (CH3-X) and S-adenosylhomosysteine (SAH). SAH hydrolase catalyzes the reversible
  hydrolysis of SAH to Hcy and adenosine. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes
  a one carbon transfer from serine (Ser) to tetrahydrofolate (THF) forming methylene-THF
  (CH2-THF) and glycine (Gly), and then CH2-THF is reduced to CH3-THF by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR). Transsulfuration pathway. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) conjugates
  Ser and Hcy to form cystathionine (CTH), which is hydrolyzed to cysteine (Cys),
  α-ketobutyrate and ammonium ion by cystathionase. Cys can be utilized for protein,
  glutathione (GSH) or taurine (Tau) synthesis in a multiply step (ms) reaction. Histidine
  oxidation. Histidine (His) is sequentially oxidized to glutamate (Glu) and formimino-THF
  (NHCH-THF). Regulation by SAM. SAM is an allosteric inhibitor of MTHFR (indirectly
  decreases Hcy methylation) and is a required allosteric activator of CBS (increases
  Hcy catabolism). SAM also inhibits BHMT transcription.
