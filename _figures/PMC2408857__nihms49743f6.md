caption: Signaling and bipolar cell reprogramming. A Rod bipolar cell remodeling in
  cone-sparing RP. Normal “phase 0” rod bipolar cells bypass cone synapses to contact
  rods. In phase 1–2 RP, rod stress and death trigger dendrite retraction and in persistent
  phase 2 cone survival, some rod bipolar cells successfully make ectopic contacts
  with cones. B The cone synaptic ribbon zone viewed as a flattened 2D structure with
  central glutamate release from a ribbon site, laterally displaced dendrites of target
  cells, and a gradient of extracellular glutamate. Ectopic dendrites from rod ON
  bipolar cells (black) likely access too little glutamate to activate the mGluR6
  (m) transduction cascade. Radially decreasing glutamate levels around the ribbon
  release site are effected by diffusion and transporter (black serrated border) losses.
  Dendrites near the ribbon expressing mGluR6 (cone ON BC) or AMPA receptors (HC)
  access perhaps a 30–90x higher glutamate level than peripheral dendrites (OFF BC)
  expressing more sensitive KA receptors (see Devries et al.). Enhanced KA receptor
  expression by reprogrammed rod BCs could render them responsive once again. C The
  canonical high-sensitivity scotopic pathway of the mammalian retina. Rods drive
  rod ON bipolar cells via sign-inverting (−) mGluR6 synapses and cones drive OFF
  bipolar cells mostly via sign-conserving (+) KA receptors and ON bipolar cells via
  sign-inverting mGluR6 synapses. Cone bipolar cells alone directly drive ganglion
  cells with sign-conserving AMPA receptors, creating distinct cone OFF (filled cells)
  and cone ON (open cells) channels that culminate in ganglion cell spiking to light
  decrements and increments respectively. In scotopic conditions, cones are silent
  and rods capture cone bipolar cell channels via an intercalary neuron, a glycinergic
  rod amacrine cell that receives sign-conserving input directly from rod bipolar
  cells and distributes those signals to ON cone bipolar cell terminals via sign-conserving
  gap junctions or OFF cone bipolar cell terminals via sign-inverting glycinergic
  synapses. Tracing the hyperpolarizing rod response to a flash of light reveals that
  this network preserves the polarity of ON and OFF channel signaling. D In cone-sparing
  RP, survivor rod bipolar cells attempt to contact cones. If such cells reprogram
  by expressing iGluRs, a collision network emerges, corrupting cone pathway signaling
  driven by remnant functional cones.
