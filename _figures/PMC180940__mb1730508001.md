caption: 'Schematic representation of the guanylic nucleotide synthesis pathway. Solid
  lines represent the plasma membrane. ext, extracellular medium; Gua, guanine; int,
  intracellular medium; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Genes are shown in
  italic type and encode the following enzymatic activities: FCY2, purine cytosine
  permease; GUA1, guanosine-5′-monophosphate synthetase; GUK1, guanosine-5′-monophosphate
  kinase; HPT1, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; IMD2, IMD3, and IMD4,
  IMPDH; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; and YNK1, nucleoside-5′-diphosphate kinase.
  IMD1 is not indicated here because it is not expressed (, ) and is thought to be
  a pseudogene.'
