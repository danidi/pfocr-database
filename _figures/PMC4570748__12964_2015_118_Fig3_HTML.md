caption: The Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. Under basal conditions Nrf2 is bound by
  two molecules of Keap1, poly-ubiquitinylated by the Cul3 system and thereby marked
  for proteasomal degradation. Only a small portion of Nrf2 escapes from this degradation
  process and translocates to the nucleus to maintain the basal expression of anti-oxidant
  response genes. Under stress conditions like elevated levels of H2O2 Keap1 is modified
  at redox sensitive cysteine residues leading to an impaired conformation and inactivation
  of Keap1. Newly translated Nrf2 escapes ubiquitinylation, translocates to the nucleus
  and induces the anti-oxidative stress response. Mechanisms for the continuously
  accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus of several cancer cells can be triggered by
  (i) mutations of Keap1 associated with its inactivation, (ii) epigenetic silencing
  of Keap1 and (iii) mutations of oncogenes such as K-ras, B-raf and c-myc leading
  to the transcriptional induction of Nrf2.
