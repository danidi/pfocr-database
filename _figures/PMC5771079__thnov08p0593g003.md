caption: 'The role of galectin-3 in inflammation is ambiguous. Some studies suggest
  that apoptosis of neutrophils and their clearance by macrophages is reduced in galectin-3
  KO mouse models. However, further research needs to be conducted as increased intracellular
  galectin-3 levels are usually associated with cellular longevity. The role of galectin-3
  in fibrosis is well-established, and increased galectin-3 levels contribute to (myo)fibroblast
  activation through a TGF-β independent pathway and also through a TGF-β dependent
  pathway. Syndecans also play an important role, especially by affecting profibrotic
  signalling in cardiac fibroblasts, and possibly also by interacting with galectin-3.
  Furthermore, galectin-3 can also affect the fibrotic pathway by inducing alternative
  (M2) activation in macrophages. KO: knockout; TGF-β: transforming growth factor
