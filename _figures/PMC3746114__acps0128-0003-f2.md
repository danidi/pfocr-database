caption: Brain circuitries involved in the stress response and reward experience.
  Key brain regions involved in the response to stress and reward experience. (a)
  Hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis. Psychological and physiological stressors are
  known to activate the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to corticotrophin
  releasing hormone (CRH) production by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone
  (ACTH) release from the anterior pituitary (indicated by the black arrows). ACTH
  induces glucocorticoid hormone release from the adrenal cortex into the circulation
  (indicated by the grey arrows). Moreover, GCs exert a negative feedback on the activation
  of the HPA activation, via GR in the hippocampus, therefore controlling their own
  release. Cortisol has important regulatory functions on the amygdala (AMYGD), hippocampus
  and prefrontal cortex (indicated by the grey arrows). Besides cortisol, another
  adrenal steroid hormone released under stress is (dehydroepiandrosterone) DHEA (indicated
  by dashed arrows). DHEA is released synchronously with cortisol from the adrenal
  glands. It has antiglucocorticoid and antiglutamatergic characteristics in the brain,
  and is – in general – related to inhibition of the HPA axis. (b) Norepinephrine
  and sympathetic nervous system (SNS).Next to activation of the HPA axis, stress
  increases norepinephrine release from the LC (locus coeruleus) to its projecting
  neurons in the amygdala, PFC and hippocampus (indicated by the long dashed arrows).
  As a result, the PFC is inhibited both by the LC itself and the amygdala (indicated
  by the black arrow), thereby favouring instinctive responses over complex thinking.
  Moreover, the amygdala stimulates brainstem autonomic centres (BAC). During stress,
  the sympathetic autonomous nervous system (SNS) releases epinephrine and NE. (c)
  Mesolimbic reward pathway. Activation of the hippocampus, amygdala and PFC also
  activates the mesolimbic reward pathway. These three structures have glutamatergic
  projections to the (nucleus accumbens) NAC (indicated by the long dashed arrows).
  The strength of the synapse is modulated by dopamine signalling that modulates glutamate
  release. A reward stimulus leads to phasic dopamine release from the VTA (indicated
  by short dashed arrows). GABAergic neurons in the NAc in turn exert negative feedback
  on the VTA, thereby controlling dopamine release, and dopaminergic signalling to
  the PFC. Integration of signals of the VTA, hippocampus (learned behaviour) and
  amygdala (emotional behaviour) by the PFC underlies the sensation of the reward
  feeling. In addition, BDNF is produced in the VTA and transported to the NAc via
  its dopaminergic afferent. It is likely that BDNF, when administered in the VTA-NAc
  also activates the GABAergic neurons in the NAc, thus inhibiting dopaminergic input
  from the VTA, possibly underlying blunted responses to emotional stimuli or symptoms
  of anhedonia.
