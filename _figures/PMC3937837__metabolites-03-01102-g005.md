caption: 'A portion of the pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway rendered
  from YeastCyc and enriched with the annotated features and MS/MS (*) identified
  compound results. The metabolites detected are highlighted inblue and accompanied
  by a heat strip that shows log2 normalized relative abundance, as detected per treatment
  condition; from left to right: calcium, red; CsA, orange; FK506, yellow; wild-type,
  grey. Boxes indicate gene/enzyme interaction nodes, which represent the genes described,
  but not depicted.'
