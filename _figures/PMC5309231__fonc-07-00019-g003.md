caption: Downstream effects analysis enables prediction of the effect of gene expression
  changes in each treatment. (A) The heat map visualizes the downstream effects analysis
  results across the multiple treatments. The top clusters of diseases or biological
  functions that are predicted to increase or decrease in at least one treatment are
  shown. The disease or function scores are displayed using a gradient from dark blue
  to orange for activation z-scores. (B) The network of the top activated biological
  function in 5-AZA-CdR + DZNep treatment (apoptosis of leukemia cell lines) is shown.
  The edges are colored orange when leading to activation of the downstream node,
  blue when leading to its inhibition, and yellow if the findings underlying the relationship
  are inconsistent with the state of the downstream node. The predicted downstream
  effect of the observed expression changes on apoptosis is stronger pathway activation
  under the joint effect of 5-AZA-CdR and DZNep (activation z-score = 0.22).
