caption: Illustration of the proposed mechanisms of nicotine in improving memory dysfunction.
  Nicotine activates nAChR, which can activate or inhibit the expression and functions
  of various proteins. Nicotine can activate PDE-5, TRβ and CaMKII, and activation
  of these proteins can lead to increased neuronal communication that ultimately improves
  memory function. In addition, nicotine activates the pro-survival PI3K/AKT pathway
  that increases LTP and improves memory dysfunction caused by AD. Also, nicotine
  can inhibit HDACs and SIRT6, which are increased in PD, thus reducing the activity
  of these proteins reduces neural apoptosis and improves memory dysfunction. PDE-5,
  phosphodiesterase-5; HDAC, histone deacetylases; PD, Parkinson's disease; SIRT6,
  Sirtuin 6; LTP, long-term potentiation; p-, phosphorylated; CAMKII, calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II; TRβ, thyroid receptor subunit β; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  AD, Alzheimer's disease; nAChR, nicotinic cholinergic receptors.
