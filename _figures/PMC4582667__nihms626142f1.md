caption: '(A) Chemical structure of C16:0/18:1 PA. This molecular species of PA was
  among several PAs that were found to be elevated in the livers of Agpat2−/− mice.
  This PA increased the glucose output when added to primary mouse hepatocytes obtained
  from Agpat2−/− mice.PA is a signaling molecule and the novel finding was that PA
  increased the glucose production (B) in primary hepatocytes isolated from Agpat2−/−
  mice. The increase in mRNA expression of key gluconeogenic genes, Pepck and G6pase
  (C & D) and increase in reporter activity of Pepck and G6pase (E & F) in the presence
  of C16:0/18:1 PA. (G) Various pathways leading to the synthesis of PA and its effect
  on gluconeogenesis. PA can be formed in four different ways: G3P is acylated by
  Gpat to form LPA with further acylation of LPA to PA by Agpat2; hydrolysis of PC
  to PA by Pld; phosphorylation of DAG to PA by Dagk; and by the PI cycle. In the
  PI cycle, PA is converted to CDP-DAG, an intermediate for the synthesis of PI in
  the presence of Cds. CDP-DAG is converted to PI by Pis. The conversion of PI to
  PIP2 is carried out by Pip5k. DAG can be formed by hydrolysis of PIP2 by Plc. This
  is a speculative PA synthesis cycle that awaits experimental confirmation. Shown
  also is the gluconeogenesis pathway activated by key gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (Pepck and G6pase).*p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.↑:
