caption: A. EPHRIN-A5 reverse signaling promotes activation of FYN, β1-integrins,
  and Erk in fibroblasts. B. Low-molecular-weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP)
  is activated by Src and dephosphorylates and inactivates p190RHOGAP. This increases
  RHOA activity to destabilize adherens junctions in EPHA2-overexpressing epithelial
  cells. EPHA2 (and EPHB2) activate RHOA through focal adhesion kinase (FAK),. EPHA4
  activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). A pathway
  involving EPHA2, PI3 kinase and Vav family exchange factors for RAC1 operates in
  endothelial cells,. Activation of EPHA2 activates Akt in pancreatic cancer cells.
  The C. elegans Eph receptor inhibits PTEN expression. C. EPHA2-ERBB2 crosstalk activates
  the HRAS-Erk pathway and RHOA in a mouse mammary tumor model, enhancing tumor growth
  and in vitro cell proliferation and migration,. Akt, activated by ERBB2 or other
  pathways, phosphorylates EPHA2. D. Ephrin-B reverse signaling affects pathways that
  promote invasiveness, including matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8) secretion and
  activation of STAT3, Src and RAC1113114. In contrast, non-phosphorylated EPHRIN-B1
  can bind PAR6 to inhibit atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). E. EphB forward signaling
  activates various RAC1 and CDC42 exchange factors,,, which could promote cancer
  cell migration and invasion. EphB4 activates RHOA. EPHB2-mediated RRAS tyrosine
  phosphorylation increases glioma cell invasiveness. EPHB2-mediated ABL activation
  increases CYCLIN-D1 levels. Pathways identified in neurons, endothelial/muscle cells,
  or C. elegans that are predicted to have tumor promoting activity are on gray, light-brown
  or light blue background, respectively. Most other pathways were identified in cultured
  cells and their significance in cancer remains to be proven. For more details see

  JAK2, Janus kinase 2.
