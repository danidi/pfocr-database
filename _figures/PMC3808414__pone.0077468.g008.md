caption: (A) Hyperglycemia increases miR-1207-5p level, which downregulates G6PD,
  PMEPA1, PDPK1 and SMAD7. G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) is the first and
  rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose pathway, which results in the production of
  NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. PMEPA1 (prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced
  1) antagonizes TGF-β signaling by sequestering phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 to
  prevent their nuclear translocation . PMEPA1 negatively impact on the duration and
  intensity of TGF- β/Smad signaling. PDPK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
  kinase-1) negatively regulates TGF-β signaling by preventing translocation of Smad3
  and Smad4 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and Smad7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  . Smad7 antagonizes TGF-β family by forming a stable complex with TGF-β type I receptor
  and, therefore, leading to inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation . Direct downregulation
  of G6PD by miR-1207-5p may induce increased production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). Increased ROS up-regulates proteins involved in ECM accumulation in the kidney,
  including TGF-β and PAI-1 (B) Proposed mechanism for a joint and independent effect
  of miR-1207-5p and PVT1 on ECM accumulation under hyperglycemic conditions. PAI-1,
  plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; FN1,
  fibronectin 1; ECM, extracellular matrix.
