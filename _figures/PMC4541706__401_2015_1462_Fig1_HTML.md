caption: 'The unfolded protein response. The unfolded protein response consists of
  three independent signaling pathways that work in parallel and are activated upon
  accumulation of unfolded proteins inside the ER. Each signaling pathway is defined
  by the different ER-resident transmembrane proteins that act as ER stress sensors:
  RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription
  factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). Activation of the UPR leads
  to an overall translational block and specific activation of ER stress responsive
  genes, which will increase the protein folding capacity and decrease the protein
  folding load in the ER. See text for further details'
