caption: Biochemical pathway proposed to regulate sperm capacitation and hyperactivation.
  The process is initiated by an influx of Ca2+ and HCO3−, possibly caused by the
  inactivation of an ATP-dependent Ca2+regulatory channel (PMCA) and alkalization
  of the cytosol. Both Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically O2−, activate
  adenylate cyclase (AC), which produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP
  activates downstream protein kinase A (PKA). PKA triggers a membrane bound NADPH
  oxidase to stimulate greater ROS production. In addition, PKA triggers phosphorylation
  of serine (Ser) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues that, in addition to other inter-connected
  pathways, lead to the activation of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). PTK phosphorylates
  Tyr residues of the fibrous sheath surrounding the axoneme, the cytoskeletal component
  of the flagellum. ROS, specifically hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), increases the amount
  of Tyr phosphorylation by promoting PTK activity and inhibiting phosphotyrosine
  phosphatase (PTPase) activity, which normally de-phosphorylates Tyr residues. The
  enhanced Tyr phosphorylation observed in capacitation is the last known step in
  the process, but intermediate steps or other (in)direct methods may be involved
