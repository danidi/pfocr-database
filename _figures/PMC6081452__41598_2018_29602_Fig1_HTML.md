caption: Heparan Sulfate (HS) biosynthetic pathway. After formation of the linkage
  region and polymerization of the chain (not shown), the chains undergo five modification
  steps catalyzed by corresponding enzymes, including the GlcNAc N-Deacetylase-N-Sulfotransferase
  (NDST), GlcA C5 Epimerase (HSEpi), 2-O-Sulfotransferase (HS2ST), 6-O-Sulfotransferase
  (HS6ST), and 3-O-Sulfotransferase (HS3ST). Differences from the products of the
  individual enzymes are highlighted in red. Five hexasaccharides were synthesized
  for this study and are numbered accordingly.
