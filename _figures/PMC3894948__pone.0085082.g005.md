caption: The diagram depicts pathways and processes providing a putative molecular
  basis for the association of diabetes with hypertension. Type-2 diabetic patients
  with a history of taking anti-hypertensive medication and normotensive diabetic
  patients were compared to their respective non-diabetic controls. Arrows in dark
  red indicate an increase or decrease of the specific metabolites in type-2 diabetic
  patients taking anti-hypertensive medication compared to controls; arrows in light
  red indicate an increase or decrease of the specific metabolites in type-2 diabetic
  patients not taking anti-hypertensive medication compared to controls. Arrows in
  grey indicate an increase or decrease of depicted metabolites as described in the
  literature. Type-2 diabetic patients taking hypertensive medication exhibit a stronger
  elevation of hexosamines and glyoxylate upon glucose challenge in comparison to
  normotensive diabetics. Concomitantly, we observed an increase of arachidonic and
  dihomo-gamma linolenic acids in type-2 diabetic patients taking anti-hypertensive
  medication and a decrease in normotensive diabetic patients compared to the corresponding
  non-diabetic controls. In addition, the ratios of some metabolites derived from
  arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities differ between diabetic
  and control subjects. Observed metabolic changes may further support an involvement
  of the RhoA pathway in the development of diabetes. An increase of glyoxylate might
  indicate a decrease in AGT2 activity which also leads to increased levels of asymmetric
  dimethylarginine, decreased NO availability and corresponding increased activity
  of the RhoA kinase pathway. Similarly, hexosamines can also affect RhoA kinase pathway
  activity.
