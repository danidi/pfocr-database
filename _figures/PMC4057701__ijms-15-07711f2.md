caption: The MyD88-IL-12-IFN-γ axis is important for P. acnes-induced LPS sensitization.
  After systemic treatment with heat-killed P. acnes, the Kupffer cells ingested the
  bacteria and activated the TLR-MyD88-NF-κB pathway, thereby producing IL-12. In
  response to the IL-12 expression, lymphocytes produced IFN-γ, which eventually activated
  dense granulomas consisting of macrophages in the liver.
