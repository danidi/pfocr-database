caption: The JAK/STAT pathway. Schematic of the signaling cascade induced by cytokines
  that signal via the JAK/STAT pathway. Cytokine binds to a specific receptor and
  allows transactivation of the associated Janus Kinases (JAKs). Activated JAKs then
  phosphorylate tyrosines on the intracellular domains of the receptor which recruit
  the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) transcription factors.
  STATs are translocated into the nucleus and upregulate the transcription of cytokine‐responsive
  genes. SOCS proteins are direct targets of STAT and act as negative‐feedback inhibitors
  to switch off the signaling cascade.
