caption: Pathway reactivation confers drug resistance by re-engaging index effectors
  downstream of the drug target, thereby maintaining the original oncogenic signaling
  output. In BRAF-mutant melanoma, MAPK pathway inhibitors target BRAF and its index
  effectors in the MAPK pathway. Pathway reactivation mechanisms include target alterations
  (e.g., amplification or alternate splicing), which render BRAF insensitive to drug
  inhibition, as well as recruitment of upstream, parallel, and downstream effectors,
  which re-activate index effectors in a BRAF-independent fashion. These mechanisms
  reactivate the index MAPK pathway effectors downstream of BRAF, conferring resistance
  to BRAF inhibition.In prostate cancer, oncogenic signaling through the androgen
  receptor (AR) is targeted by androgen-deprivation therapy and anti-androgen therapy.
  Resistance to AR-directed therapy can be mediated by pathway reactivation mechanisms
  including target alterations, which render AR itself resistant to drug inhibition,
  and recruitment of upstream effectors (non-gonadal androgens or alternate AR ligands),
  which reactivate drug-inhibited signaling through AR. In either case, the index
  oncogenic signaling downstream of AR is re-activated, conferring drug resistance.
