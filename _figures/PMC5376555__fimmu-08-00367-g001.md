caption: The differing metabolic phenotypes of quiescent versus activated lymphocytes.
  (A) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the key molecule that provides energy for cellular
  processes. Maintaining cellular ATP levels is essential for bioenergetic homeostasis
  and cell survival. Glucose, a key fuel source for mammalian cells, can be metabolized
  via two integrated metabolic pathways, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation
  (oxphos), that efficiently generate ATP. Glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate
  that, following transportation into the mitochondria, is further metabolized to
  CO2 by the Krebs cycle fueling oxphos and ATP synthesis. In addition to the breakdown
  of glucose via glycolysis, cells have the ability to metabolize alternative substrates
  including fatty acids by β-oxidation and glutamine by glutaminolysis, which feed
  into the Krebs cycle and drive oxphos. (B) Aerobic glycolysis supports biosynthetic
  processes of the cell as it allows the uptake of larger amounts of glucose and the
  maintenance of elevated glycolytic flux. Glycolytic intermediates are then diverted
  into various pathways for the synthesis of biomolecules that support biosynthetic
  processes. For instance, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) generated by the first step in
  glycolysis can feed into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to support nucleotide
  synthesis. This pathway also generates NADPH, a cofactor that is essential for various
  biosynthetic processes including lipid synthesis. Glucose can also be converted
  into cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA via citrate in the Krebs cycle for the production of
  cholesterol and fatty acids for lipid synthesis. Other glycolytic intermediates
  can also be converted into biomolecules used for protein and lipid synthesis. During
  aerobic glycolysis a significant proportion of pyruvate is also converted to lactate
  and secreted from the cell. Lactate export is important as it allows glycolysis
  to be sustained at an elevated rate. Alternative fuels including glutamine feed
  into the Krebs cycle and can also supply biomolecules for biosynthetic processes
  under certain conditions. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, GP, glycerate 3-phosphate,
  Ser, serine; Ala, alanine.
