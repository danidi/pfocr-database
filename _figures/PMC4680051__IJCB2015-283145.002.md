caption: 'Schematic diagram of metabolic networks placing mitochondria at the center
  of anabolic and bioenergetics pathways in cancer cells. Anabolic pathways are responsible
  for the production of macromolecules used for growth and proliferation of cancer
  cells. Red lines indicate glycolysis: multisteps conversion of glucose to pyruvate
  and pyruvate to lactate allowing the flux of glucose intermediates to fulfill anabolic
  pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway and the PHGDH/serine pathway for
  nucleotides, lipids, and AA biosynthesis (see text for details). The decoupling
  of glycolysis from mitochondria is also observed. Mitochondria participate in ATP
  production through oxidation of alternative substrates such as glutamine or fatty
  acid (FA). Furthermore, mitochondria are also involved in anabolic pathways for
  producing building blocks (AA, lipids). Glutamine refills TCA intermediates (anaplerosis)
  and can feed the reverse TCA cycle for lipid synthesis (blue arrows) (see text for
  details).'
