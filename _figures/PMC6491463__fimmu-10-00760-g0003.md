caption: Schematic depiction of the CD38/CD203a/CD73 adenosinergic pathway as a major
  mechanism of the acquired resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade within the BM niche.
  CD38+high MM cells catalyze NAD+ transformation to ADO via the CD38/CD203a/CD73
  ectoenzymatic pathway, discontinuously expressed by BM resident cells (MM, OCs,
  OBs, BMSC). This step is followed by (i) the activation of the ADOR A2A and A2B
  on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, with suppression of their anti-tumor functions and (ii)
  the induction of an anti-PD-1/PD-L1-mediated resistance to the increase of cytotoxic
  T-cell infiltration in the BM niche. Anti–PD-1/PD-L1-resistant MM cells also produce
  soluble mediators (such as IFN-β and ATRA) leading to increased expression of CD38
  on mPCs via RARα. This mechanism support the use of anti-CD38 mAbs (e.g., daratumumab
  and isatuximab) with the ability to inhibit CD38 cyclase activity. When used in
  combination with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., nivolumab and atezolizumab),
  the result may be an improvement of antitumor immune responses with reactivation
  of CD8+ T effector lymphocytes leading to a control of MM cells.
