caption: Illustration of a putative additional molecular mechanism for the ability
  of the inhibitory T cell signaling proteins CTLA-4 and PD-1 and the GPCR A2AR to
  diminish T cell activation leading to the enhancement of cancer development. The
  immune synapse between the antigen-presenting cell (APC) and T cell is shown. In
  the left part the accelerator costimulatory signaling protein CD28 in the plasma
  membrane of the T cell is shown being contacted by its activating protein B7-1linked
  to the plasma membrane of the APC. It is illustrated that that the inhibitory T
  cell proteins CTLA-4 and PD-1, activated by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, may both
  (shown) or separately (not shown) directly contact CD28 to form a putative receptor
  complex. Through an inhibitory allosteric receptor-receptor interaction, the signaling
  of the CD28 becomes inhibited involving e.g., inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3k) activation by CD28. To the right it is illustrated how the ligand bound PD1
  may directly allosterically inhibit the T cell receptor (TCR) of the T cell, activated
  by the peptide bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC). This may lead to reductions
  of TCR signaling through putative formation of a TCR-PD-1 complex. In addition,
  PD-1 L1 and L2 activation may also enhance the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase
  2 (SHP2) causing a reduction of phosphorylation of the TCR contributing to inhibition
  of TCR signaling. In the center of the immune synapse the adenosine activated adenosine
  receptor A2AR is proposed to directly interact with the TCR in the plasma membrane
  of the T cell to bring down its activation by pMHC through allosteric mechanisms.
  It is known that sustained activation of ERC produces strong T cell activation ().
  It is therefore possible that in addition to the putative formation of TCR-A2AR
  heteroreceptor complexes, the A2AR induced activation of the AC-CREB pathway may
  also counteract the activation of the TCR by blocking sustained activation of ERK.
  This figure serves to indicate that the molecular mechanisms involve not only integration
  of the signaling pathways and their modulation of the signaling receptors involving
  changes in protein phosphorylation but also the allosteric integration in heteroreceptor
  complexes of the T cell through allosteric receptor-receptor and receptor-protein
  interactions. The balance of the heteroreceptor complexes with each other in the
  same T cell may also have a relevant role for the T cell function and help determine
  the state of the T cells.
