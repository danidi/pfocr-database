caption: ADARs and the 26G pathway prevent antiviral RNAi-mediated silencing of self
  dsRNAs. During viral infection, viral replication generates dsRNAs that are processed
  into 23H siRNAs by a complex of DCR-1, RDE-1, RDE-4, and DRH-1. RDE-1 binds 23H
  siRNAs and stimulates 22G siRNA production by RRF-1. 22G siRNAs bind NRDE-3 and
  SAGO Argonautes to effect silencing. ADARs bind and edit EERs to prevent recognition
  as viral dsRNA and processing to 23H siRNAs by the antiviral DCR-1 complex. In the
  26G pathway, the ERI complex (containing RRF-3, DCR-1, and RDE-4) generates 26G
  siRNAs, which bind ERGO-1, promote 22G siRNA synthesis, and silence targets through
  NRDE-3 and SAGO proteins. Thus, absent viral infection, antiviral RNAi is kept inactive
  by ADARs binding and editing self dsRNAs and by 26G pathway sequestration of common
  RNAi factors (green). For simplicity, we show only factors relevant to this study
  (see Supplemental Fig. S1); complexes containing additional components are noted
  with asterisks.
