caption: Under normal fed conditions, Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis through Akt
  dependent pathways (boxed 1) which phosphorylate and retain Foxo1 in the cytoplasm.
  Insulin also suppresses (boxed 2) adipocyte lipolysis (boxed 5), thereby limiting
  the flow to liver of glycerol, which is a substrate along with lactate and amino
  acids for gluconeogenesis (boxed 3). According to this model, HFD/obesity mediates
  a primary effect to upregulate Foxo1 (boxed 6) and disrupt its suppression by insulin
  signaling to protein kinase Akt, causing increased glucose output. The resultant
  hyperglycemia/chronic hyperinsulinemia is hypothesized to disrupt the normal acute
  insulin suppression of adipocyte lipolysis (boxed 7). Increased fatty acid delivery
  and metabolism in liver promotes gluconeogenesis through allosteric regulation of
  fatty acid oxidation products such as Acetyl CoA (boxed 4). Thus, under conditions
  of HFD/obesity, gluconeogenesis is promoted by both directed upregulation and deregulation
  of Foxo1 and by products of adipose lipolysis, while under normal diet/lean conditions,
  the direct action of insulin on Foxo1 (boxed 1) is sufficient to suppress gluconeogenesis.
  Insulin is also required for lipogenesis through an insulin receptor-dependent,
  Akt-dependent pathway (boxed 8) that activates mTOR1, promoting SREBP1 and stimulates
  expression of enzymes in the de novo lipogenesis pathway (boxed 9). This model requires
  Akt to have significant activity, even under HFD and obesity conditions.
