caption: Endogenous small RNA pathways involved in host defense and viral pathogenesis
  in plants and animals. (A) Small RNA biogenesis pathways mediated by the four Dicer-like
  endonucleases (DCLs) in plant cells. (1) DCL3 generates short interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
  from transcripts produced via RNA Pol IV-dependent transcription. These siRNAs then
  form a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with Argonaute 4 (AGO4), which mediates
  chromatin modifications at complementary genomic DNA sites. (2) Plant primary-microRNA
  (pri-miRNA) transcribed by RNA Pol II is processed into a miRNA/miRNA* duplex by
  DCL1. The duplex is then transported to the cytoplasm by Hasty, a homolog of animal
  exportin-5, where the mature miRNA associates with Argonaute 1 (AGO1) to form a
  miRISC (miRNA-induced silencing complex). miRISC facilitates the degradation of
  targeted mRNAs. (3) RNA dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) produces dsRNAs from miRNA-mediated
  cleavage products of TAS gene transcripts. These dsRNAs are then processed into
  trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) by DCL4. Mature tasiRNAs form a RISC with AGO2 to
  mediate mRNA suppression. (4) Viral RNAs are utilized by RDR6 to produce dsRNAs,
  which are then processed into siRNAs by DCL2. These viral siRNAs undergo a second
  round of RDR6 amplification and are transported to peripheral sites, where they
  form RISCs with either AGO1 or AGO2. These RISCs then degrade viral RNA as part
  of the anti-viral response; (B) MicroRNA biogenesis pathway of animal cells. Pri-miRNAs
  transcribed from either cellular DNA or viral DNA via an RNA Pol II mechanism are
  processed into precursor hairpin molecules (pre-miRNA) in the nucleus. Pre-miRNAs
  are transported to the cytoplasm, where they are further processed into the mature
  miRNA, which associates with AGO2 and a several accessory proteins to form RISC.
  RISC then facilitates the suppression of mRNA expression.
