caption: 'Inflammation-associated BH4 pathway. Cytokine production elicited in response
  to an immune challenge induces GTP-cyclohydrolase-1 (GCH1), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin
  synthase (PTPS) and sepiapterin reductase (SR) activation (de novo synthesis pathway),
  leading to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis. GCH1 activity is modulated by the
  interaction of GTP-cyclohydrolase feedback protein (GFRP) and effectors molecules,
  BH4 and phenylalanine. BH4 is rapidly oxidized to BH2, which is subsequently reduced
  back to BH4 by the enzyme DHFR, representing a salvage pathway. In Human, PTPS becomes
  rate-limiting under inflammatory challenge and drives neopterin formation to the
  detriment of BH4. Under inflammatory conditions, BH4 is preferentially used as cofactor
  for NOS (nitric oxide synthase) activity, for synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), leading
  to a lower availability for PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase), TH (tyrosine hydroxylase)
  and TrypOH (tryptophan hydroxylase) activities and reduced synthesis of monoamines.
