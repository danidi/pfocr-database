caption: Diagram of the synthesis of capsaicinoids adapted from Mazourek et al. and
  Kim et al. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase (4CL), COMT, caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase; HCHL, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA
  hydratase lyase; AMT, aminotransferase; GS, glutamine synthetase; GOGAT, glutamate
  synthase; BCAT, branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase; FatA, acyl-ACP thioesterase;
  CS, capsaicinoid synthetase. Non-measured and non-detected metabolites are set in
  gray and metabolites quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry are set
  in black. Significantly changed (VIP > 1 from partial least squares discriminant
  analysis and p < 0.05 from t-test) metabolites are set in red. Genes marked by blue
  arrows were analyzed in this experiment.
