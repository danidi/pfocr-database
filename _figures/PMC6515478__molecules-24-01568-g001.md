caption: 'Ester synthesis pathway: During yeast metabolism, fermentable sugars and
  lipids are converted into acetyl-CoA and nitrogen metabolism induces the formation
  of fusel alcohols. These compounds are further used to produce ester molecules by
  the catalytic activity of the enzyme ester synthase. The picture was adapted from
  Verstrepen et al. (b) [].'
