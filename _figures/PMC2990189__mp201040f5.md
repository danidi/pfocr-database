caption: Schematic model of GEMS molecular cascade mediating the enhancement of stress-related
  memories. During stress, the increase in glucocorticoid secretion (1) activates
  the glucocorticoid receptors (GR) inducing its nuclear translocation (2). GR trigger
  the synthesis of the transcription factor Egr-1 (3) and then the activation of the
  MAPK pathway (4), which further increases Egr-1 production (5). Egr-1 stimulates
  the transcription of synapsin-Ia/Ib (6), which increases the number of SVs bound
  to actin and in this way the pool of readily releasable neurotransmitters. Activated
  MAPK do not modify synapsin-I expression, but induce their phosphorylation (7).
  Phosphorylated synapsin-Ia/Ib releases SVs bound to actin (8) allowing their transport
  to the pre-synaptic membrane (9) and neurotransmitter release (10). The double action
  of GR-induced Egr-1 expression and MAPK activation on both synapsin-I synthesis
  and phosphorylation can guarantee a sustained increase in neurotransmitter release.
  Specifically, an increase in glutamate release is likely to mediate the enhancement
  of stress-related memories that can be blocked both by inhibiting MAPK phosphorylation
  and synapsin-I expression. This model is based on several studies, including ours,
  which are discussed in the main text.
