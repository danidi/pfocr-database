caption: 'Proposed model for metabolic pathways affected by GAPCp activity. Lack of
  GAPCp activity reduces the  precursor for the , which provides Ser to specific nonphotosynthetic
  cells but also α-ketoglutarate required for ammonium assimilation through the Gln
  synthetase/Glu synthase (GS/GOGAT) pathway and/for anaplerotic reactions into the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The reduced activity of the GS/GOGAT pathway would
  increase Gln and would divert l-Glu to the biosynthesis of , which could play a
  role in balancing carbon and nitrogen metabolism in gapcp1gapcp2 by contributing
  to the anaplerotic flux of Gln-derived carbon into the tricarboxylic acid cycle

  by the transport of glycerate from the cytosol and subsequent conversion into  by
  glycerate kinase (GK). The enzymes participating in each biosynthetic pathway are
  as follows: for the phosphorylated pathway (), 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PGDH), 3-phospho-Ser aminotransferase (PSAT), and 3-phospho-Ser phosphatase (PSP);
  and for the ammonium assimilation pathway, GS/GOGAT. Other enzymes are as follows:
  PGAP, phosphoglycerate phosphatase; and PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; p stands for
  plastidial. Metabolites are as follows: 1,3-bis-PGAP, 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 3-PHP, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate; and 3-PS, 3-phospho-Ser.'
