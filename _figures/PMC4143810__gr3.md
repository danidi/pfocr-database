caption: Ethanol-induced necroptosis is RIP3-dependent. (A) In a healthy hepatocyte,
  under physiologic conditions, TNFα-activated signaling is cytoprotective. TNF receptor
  activation results in the activation NFκB, which promotes cell survival. Cell survival
  is also promoted by TNFα-mediated inhibition of p53-dependent apoptosis and induction
  of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins. In contrast, under conditions of cellular
  stress, such as during chronic ethanol exposure, there is a shift in the cellular
  response to TNFα from cytoprotection to cell death. Initially, this response shift
  to apoptosis, the less inflammatory mode of cell death. However, when expression
  of CYP2E1 is increased, there is an induction of RIP3, as well as loss of mitochondrial
  integrity. This combination likely shifts the mode of cell death to the more inflammatory
  necroptotic pathway. This shift in hepatocyte response to TNFα, coupled with an
  increase in TNFα expression in the liver, leads to an increase in RIP3-mediated
  cell death . This shift in the continuum of hepatocellular response to TNFα results
  in a switch from TNFα being cell protective to cell killing, first to the less inflammatory
  mode of apoptosis, but ultimately to the more injurious necroptotic mode of cell
  death (B).
