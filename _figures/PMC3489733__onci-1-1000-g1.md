caption: Figure 1. PolyI:C induces three antitumor effectors via different routes.
  Antitumor activity of polyI:C against tumor cells are assessed in mouse tumor-implant
  models. A unique point in this review is the third pathway where tumor-infiltrating
  myeloid cells are involved, effectively damages Lewis Lung carcinoma cells. This
  tumoricidal activity is mediated by the TICAM-1 pathway in the myeloid cells, and
  attributed to TNF-α. Although polyI:C is i.p. administered, it acts on tumor-infiltrating
  Mf and converts them to antitumor effectors.
