caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of data from meta-analyses of published
  proteomic studies on exosomes and microvesicles. a Molecules implicated in viral
  entry by caveola- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis as well as by macropinocytosis.
  Shaded symbols represent molecules identified in exosomes. As shown, several exosomal
  proteins are present in the IPA knowledgebase as molecules that facilitate the entry
  of different viruses. b Molecules involved in integrin signaling. Shaded symbols
  represent published microvesicle-associated proteins as key participants of integrin
  signaling
