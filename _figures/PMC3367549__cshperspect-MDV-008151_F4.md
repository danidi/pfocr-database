caption: The BMP signaling pathway and regulation of SMAD activity. Binding of BMP
  ligand to BMPRII results in dimerization with BMPRI and phosphorylation of receptor
  (R-)Smads (Smad1, 5, or 8) close to the carboxyl terminus. These activated R-Smads
  complex with a Co-Smad (Smad4) and the Smad complex translocates to the nucleus
  where they interact with other transcriptional regulators to control gene transcription.
  Negative feedback mechanisms include the expression of SMAD6,7, which competes with
  SMAD1,5,8 for binding to BMPRI. Both WNT and RTK signaling pathways have been shown
  to inhibit BMP signaling at the level of Smad1. ERK phosphorylates the linker region
  in between the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of Smad, which primes Smad for
  a further phosphorylation by GSK3. Dually phosphorylated Smad is targeted for degradation.
  Secreted BMP antagonists such as Noggin bind to and sequester BMP ligand in the
  extracellular space.
