caption: 'Enzyme names are shown along with their expression patterns at various stages.
  Grids represent the expression patterns of genes shown as FPKM values: 10, 18, 26,
  and 34 DAP, left to right. The absolute expression is represented by the grids at
  10, 18, 26, and 34 DAP, with FPKM values of 0–1, 1–2, 2–4, 4–8, 8–16, 16–32, 32–64,
  64–128, 128–256, 256–512, 512–1200 and >1200'
