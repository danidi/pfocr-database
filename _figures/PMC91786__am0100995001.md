caption: Simplified biosynthesis pathway for the carotenoids (boxed) that significantly
  accumulate in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. Gene names for biosynthetic enzymes
  that have been identified in the genome are in parentheses next to the enzymes that
  they encode. Arrowheads indicate pathways that remain hypothetical. DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate.
