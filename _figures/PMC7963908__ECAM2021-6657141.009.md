caption: TNBS-induced activation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signal transduction
  signaling cascade, which leads to the activation of canonical NF-kB pathway. Canonical
  NF-κB p65/p50 causes upregulation of myosin light chain kinases (MLCK) gene and
  protein expression, causing MLC phosphorylation, ultimately increasing tight junction
  (TJ) permeability in vivo. BZYQ treatment may inhibit activation of the toll-like
  receptor (TLR) 4 signal pathway to maintain intestinal epithelial function.
