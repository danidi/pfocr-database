caption: 'Intracellular negative immune regulators of dendritic cells (DCs). When
  immune receptors are triggered, downstream kinases such as Janus kinase (JAK) are
  activated. JAK then activates the signal transducers and activators of transcription
  3 (STAT3). Nuclear translocation of phosphorylated-STAT3 (P-STAT3) activates the
  transcription of STAT3-targeted genes. Silenced Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling
  (SOCS) 1 and SOCS3 can interact with JAK and block the phosphorylation of STAT3,
  inhibiting the transcription of STAT3-mediated cytokines. In addition, the canonical
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway is also triggered by immune receptors. This signal
  leads to the phosphorylation of the IκB kinase α (IκBα), which associates with the
  dimers of p50 and RELA (or c-REL). Proteasomal degradation of phospho-IκBα (P-IκBα)
  results in the nuclear translocation of canonical NF-κB family members, which activates
  the transcription of downstream genes. Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) is a transcription
  factor that inhibits the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Besides, cytosolic
  FOXO3 binds to RELA, and this complex decreases the nuclear translocation of NF-κB.
  Indoleamine 2,3-doixygenase 1 (IDO1) is an enzyme that degrades tryptophan into
  kynurenine. IDO-expressing DCs suppress the function of effector T cells and induce
  the expansion of regulatory T cells. Abbreviation: pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRS); tumor necrosis factor Receptors (TNFRs).'
