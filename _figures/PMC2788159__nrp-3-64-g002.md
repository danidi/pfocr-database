caption: 'Current proposed mechanisms of amino acid sensing by mTORC1 Amino acids
  are imported into the cells via various amino acid transporters and activate mTORC1
  either by amino acid metabolites or by undefined membrane/intracellular amino acid
  sensor(s). Figure depicts a case of L-leucine (for details, see text). AT: aminotransferase;
  α-KIC: α-ketoisocaproic acid; BCKDH: branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase; GDH:
  glutamate dehydrogenase; AOAA: aminooxyacetic acid'
