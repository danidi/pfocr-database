caption: Toll signaling pathway. The Toll signaling pathway and its multiple modes
  of activation in the Drosophila immune response. Three distinct mechanisms for microbial
  recognition, leading to the cleavage of Spätzle and activation of Toll, are illustrated.
  The mechanisms include peptidoglycan detection, by PGRP-SA, PGRP-SD and GNBP1, β-glucan
  detection through GNBP3, and protease activity sensing via the serine protease Persephone.
  All these detection modalities lead to the activation of the Spätzle processing
  enzyme (SPE) which converts this cytokine into its active form, for binding and
  activating Toll. The intracellular signal transduction downstream of Toll is very
  similar to the MyD88-dependent pathway, which functions downstream of most mammalian
  TLRs. The key features of this pathway include a trimeric receptor associated complex,
  containing MyD88, Tube and Pelle, which ultimately lead to the phosphorylation and
  degradation of the IκB homology Cactus and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB homologs
  Dif and Dorsal.
