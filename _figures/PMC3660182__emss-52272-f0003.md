caption: Schematic illustration of Wnt1/Fzd-1/β-catenin signaling as a candidate regulatory
  circuit controlling mesencephalic DAergic neuron–astrocyte crosstalk. In the intact
  unlesioned midbrain, crosstalk between astrocytes and DA neurons represents a cardinal
  neuroprotective mechanism against inflammation, oxidative stress, and growth factor
  deprivation. This function appears to be of paramount importance for DAergic neurons,
  which are known to be particularly vulnerable to increased inflammation and oxidative
  stress. Astrocyte-derived Wnts, particularly Wnt1, via activation of Fzd-1 receptors,
  may contribute to maintain the integrity of DAergic neurons via blockade of GSK-3β-induced
  phosphorylation (P) and proteosomal degradation of the neuronal pool of β-catenin.
  Stabilized β-catenin can translocate into the nucleus, associate with a family of
  transcription factors, and regulate the expression of Wnt target genes involved
  in DAergic neuron survival. β-Catenin may also function as a pivotal defense molecule
  against oxidative stress, and can act as a co-activator for several nuclear receptors
  involved in the maintenance/protection of DA neurons. Crosstalk with upstream survival
  pathways converging to β-catenin stabilization can also be envisaged. Neurotoxic
  injury or increased oxidative load as a result of aging may antagonize Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling in DA ergich neurons by upregulating active GSK-3β, leading to β-catenin
  degradation and increased DAergic neuron vulnerability. Neuronal injury also triggers
  reactive astrocyte expression of a panel of growth and neurotrophic factors, anti-oxidant
  and neuroprotective mechanisms, among which astrocyte Wnt1 may function, via Fzd-1
  receptors, as a vital component of the self-protective machinery of DAergic neurons,
  shifting the balance towards the programming of cell survival/neurorescue. From
