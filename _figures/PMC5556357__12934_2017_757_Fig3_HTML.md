caption: Predicted average fluxes of the biosynthetic pathways towards manoyl oxide
  (left) and dhurrin (right). The values were determined by random sampling (μmol
  product/gDW/h) in the presence and the absence of the heterologous biosynthetic
  pathway (values outside and inside the brackets, respectively). G3P glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate, IPP isopentenyl diphosphate, DMAPP dimethylallyl diphosphate, GPP geranyl
  diphosphate, FPP farnesyl diphosphate, GGPP geranylgeranyl diphosphate, PEP phosphoenolpyruvate
