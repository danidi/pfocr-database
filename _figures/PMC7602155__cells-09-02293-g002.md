caption: KCC is implicated in atherosclerosis and is a potential therapeutic target
  for hypertension. Potassium chloride channel (KCC) in vascular cells is regulated
  via the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and nitric oxide (NO), both of which
  are implicated in atherosclerosis and vasodilation respectively. PDGF regulates
  KCC through the dimerization of PDGF receptors (PDGFR) and the subsequent activation
  of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Through an unknown mechanism, PI3K activates
  protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) which dephosphorylates and actives KCC. Activation of
  KCC could enhance the phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
  into a diseased state. NO regulates KCC via the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate/protein
  kinase G (NO/cGMP/PKG) pathway. PKG activates PP1 through an unknown mechanism leading
  to KCC activation and consequent vasodilation. KCC could be a potential therapeutic
  target for hypertension. Apelin is cardioprotective and a common modulator of both
  pathways.
