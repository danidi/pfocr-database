caption: The major source of cellular ROS is the mitochondria. Leakage through the
  electron transport chain releases mitochondrial superoxides (O2−), which can be
  converted by mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
  Likewise, activity of oxidases such as NADPH oxidases (NOXs) at membranes, cytochrome
  p450 at the endoplasmic reticulum, lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenase and xanthine oxidase,
  can all lead to the production of O2, which can be converted by cytoplasmic SOD1
  into H2O2. SOD3 mediates a similar reaction in the extracellular space. H2O2 can
  further undergo a Fenton chemical reaction to yield hydroxyl radicals (OH•). Peroxiredoxin
  (PRX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) enzymatically mediate reduction
  of H2O2 into water (H2O). A number of metabolic enzymes generate reducing equivalents
  of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a byproduct, thus contributing
  to the maintenance of redox homeostasis. Examples of these include Glucose-6-phosphate
  Dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase (PGD) of the Pentose phosphate
  pathway, Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (MTHFD1), Isocitrate Dehydrogenase
  (cytoplasmic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2) and Malic Enzyme (cytoplasmic ME1 and
  mitochondrial ME2/3). Biosynthesis of reduced glutathione (GSH) is mediated through
  Glutamate-cysteine Ligase (GCL) while Glutathione Reductase (GR) catalyzes the reduction
  of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) back to the sulfhydryl form GSH. GSSG can be exported
  out of the cell through multidrug resistant proteins to maintain intracellular redox
  homeostasis. The oxidized dimer of cysteine, cystine, is a substrate for the cystine-glutamate
  antiporter (system xc–). This transport system increases the concentration of cystine
  inside the cell, which is quickly reduced to cysteine. Extracellular GSH can be
  hydrolyzed by Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) to yield products that are imported
  into cells as individual amino acids or as dipeptides. This salvage pathway represents
  a means by which GSH can be produced independently of GCL over the short term. Dotted
  lines denote H2O2 diffusion.
