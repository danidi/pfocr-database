caption: Schematic overview of previously reported metabolic pathways of LCA and CDCA
  in the liver. The hydrophobicity indices also are presented if the data were available
  from the literature. Conjugation pathways are only shown for LCA and CDCA, but other
  bile acids are also subject to glycine-, taurine-, sulfate-, or glucuronide-conjugation.
  (H) major pathway in humans; (R) major pathway in rats; 3-KCA, 3-ketocholic acid;
  6-KLCA, 6-ketolithocholic acid; BAAT, bile acid:amino acid transferase; BACS, bile
  acid:coA synthase; CA, cholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; CDCA-Gluc, chenodeoxycholic
  acid-glucuronide; CDCA-S, chenodeoxycholic acid-sulfate; CYP, cytochrome P450; GCDCA,
  glycochenodeoxycholic acid; GLCA, glycolithocholic acid; HCA, hyocholic acid; HDCA,
  hyodeoxycholic acid; ILCA, isolithocholic acid; LCA, lithocholic acid; LCA-Gluc,
  lithocholic acid-glucuronide; LCA-S, lithocholic acid-sulfate; αMCA, α-muricholic
  acid; βMCA, β-muricholic acid; γMCA, γ-muricholic acid; MDCA, murideoxycholic acid;
  SULT, sulfotransferase; TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; TLCA, taurolithocholic
  acid; TLCA-S, taurolithocholic acid-sulfate; UDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid; UGT, UDP
