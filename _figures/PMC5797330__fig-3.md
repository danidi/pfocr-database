  (a) New vessels arise from preexisting vessels on exposure to proangiogenic (+)
  factors VEGF-A and ANG-2 that induce vascular ECs to remove intercellular and PC,
  secrete proteases that degrade the basement membrane and surrounding ECM, alter
  polarity, and migrate. The degree of exposure and vicinity to VEGF-A determines
  tip cell selection. VEGF-A and tip cell VEGFR-2 interactions promote transmembrane
  Notch ligand DLL4 expression, laterally inhibiting tip cell differentiation of adjacent
  stalk cells by promoting Notch signaling. (b) Enhanced vascular permeability releases
  plasma proteins, which form a provisional matrix that interacts with VEGF-A, Semaphorins,
  and SLIT proteins, creating an angiogenic gradient that directs migrating sprouts.
  Tip cells secrete PDGF-B to recruit mural cells. Stalk cells maintain parent vessel
  connectivity through intercellular tight junctions and deposition of basement membrane.
  (c) Encountering tip cells initiates the end of angiogenesis by reforming intercellular
  junctional contacts. Lumen formation occurs by re-establishing apicobasal polarity,
  redistributing junctional EC proteins and recruiting actomyosin. Fusion of intracellular
  vacuoles also creates lumen through Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1. (d) Neovessel
  ECs secrete EGFL7 into the surrounding ECM to assist in tubulogenesis. Stabilization
  of mural cell contacts promotes vessel maturation by initiating quiescence. TGF-β1
  is released by ECs to further mural cell differentiation toward a vascular SMC phenotype.

  junctions that regulate permeability. Wnt signaling, Wnt7a, Wnt7b, Wnt3a genes,
  β-catenin, and astrocyte SSeCKS control BBB differentiation. Fenestrated endothelium
  in the EG contains diaphragms regulated through EG-VEGF, VEGF-A, and type II membrane
  glycoprotein PV-1. Podocyte-secreted VEGF and the Rho/Rac signaling pathway specify
  the kidney glomeruli. Discontinuous endothelium contains fenestrae 100–200 nm in
  size and lack a continuous basement membrane. BBB, blood–brain barrier; DLL4, Delta-like
