caption: Black lines indicate a current understanding of the Hippo signaling cascades
  that regulate YAP phosphorylation and stability, resulting in YAP cytoplasmic retention
  by 14-3-3 and proteasomal degradation by SCF(β-TrCP). Red lines indicate the novel
  findings presented in this report, showing that PR55α inhibits the MOB1-activated
  LATS1-S909/LATS2-S872 autophosphorylation that prevents YAP activation, while PR55α
  concomitantly inhibits YAP phosphorylation, both of which lead to YAP activation.
  Blue dotted lines indicate that PR55α activates MST1/2 levels and phosphorylation
  through an unknown mechanism
