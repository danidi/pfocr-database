caption: Overlay of log2-transformed SNP abundance for genes in the UDP-d-xylose biosynthesis
  pathway. Individual reaction representations are highlighted using the color code
  at the top left corner. The numbers in the color code define the ranges of the log2(SNP
  abundance) values of the genes in such a way that red, blue and green colors correspond
  to genes with high, medium and low SNP values, respectively. The reaction arrows
  for UDP-d-glucuronate formation, and for both the cytosolic and intra-Golgi conversions
  of UDP-d-glucuronate to UDP-d-xylose are highlighted in red since all the corresponding
  genes have high log2(SNP abundance). The color-coded log2(SNP abundance) values
  for the transcriptome genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing each reaction can be
  exhibited using pop-up bar diagrams, shown as inset figures. The absolute log2(SNP
  abundance) values for the genes that explicitly appear on the pathway diagram occur
  next to the corresponding gene locus tags and are color coded as well.
