caption: 'De novo serine biosynthesis diverges from glycolysis. The serine synthesis
  pathway utilises the glycolytic intermediate 3P-glycerate, which is converted by
  PHGDH, PSAT-1, and PSPH into serine. Removal of exogenous serine causes activation
  of its biosynthetic pathway. Serine accumulation accelerates glycolytic flux, although
  allosteric activation of PKM2 by serine. p53, via TIGAR, and TAp73, via G6PD, facilitate
  activation of the PPP, promoting NADPH and nucleotide synthesis. p53-dependent activation
  of p21 induces transient cell cycle arrest, blocking flux to purines, thus maintaining
  GSH synthesis. TAp73 drives glutamine/glutamate conversion by inducing expression
  of GLS-2, thus pushing serine biosynthetic pathway, while it represses intracellular
  ROS controlling COX4i1 subunit expression. Abbreviations: 3P glycerate, glycerate-3-phosphate;
  PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species; COX4i1, cytochrome C oxidase subunit 4 isoform
  1; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLS-2, glutaminase-2; GSH, glutathione;
  PSAT-1, phosphoserine aminotransferase 1; PSPH, phosphoserine phosphatase; TIGAR,
  TP53-inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator.'
