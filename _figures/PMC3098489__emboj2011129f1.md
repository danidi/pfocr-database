caption: Schematic of proposed role of PrP in pro-apoptotic signalling during neurodegenerative
  diseases. Native proteins exist in equilibrium with partially or completely unfolded
  forms. In some instances, partially misfolded proteins can adopt β structures with
  the propensity to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils. However, along the pathway
  to fibril formation, the smaller β oligomers mediate toxic effects. PrPC is one
  of the potentially multiple cell-surface receptors capable of binding to the toxic
  oligomers and mediating pro-apoptotic signals in conjunction with other molecules.
