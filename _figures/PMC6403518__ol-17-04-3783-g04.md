caption: Schematic model of the function of resveratrol in colorectal cancer cells.
  Resveratrol induces the expression of SET7/9 using an unknown mechanism. SET7/9
  methylates p53 at K372 and promotes the p53 transcriptional activity on the PUMA
  and BAX promoter, which results in apoptosis. In addition to the p53-dependent pathway,
  resveratrol augments PUMA and BAX expression by activating an unknown signalling
  pathway. SET7/9, SET domain containing lysine methyltransferase 7/9; Me-, methylation;
  p53, tumor protein p53; K372, lysine 372; PUMA, Bcl2 binding component 3; BAX, Bcl2
  associated X, apoptosis regulator.
