caption: Genes predicted to increase cardiovascular angiogenesis are strongly up‐regulated
  by CpG pre‐conditioning 24 h post‐I/R. (A) Network analysis of CpG ODN‐induced activation
  of angiogenic genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify the network
  of regulatory genes (open labels) contributing to CpG ODN‐induced activation. (B)
  IL1 complex is one regulator of angiogenesis 24 h post‐I/R. Figure shows network
  of genes significantly induced by IL1 complex. These genes are known to increase
  cardiovascular angiogenesis (see also Figure A). Asterisks indicate that fold change
  values of replicates have been averaged
