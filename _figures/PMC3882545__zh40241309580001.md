caption: Metabolic regulation in the insulin resistant heart. In the normal heart,
  the control of substrate supply and demand primarily occurs at the level of the
  plasma membrane and the mitochondria. In 1963, Randle et al. () first described
  a mechanism of competition between fatty acids and glucose for mitochondrial oxidation
  that would lead to decreased glucose utilization in the presence of increased fatty
  acid concentrations () (red). Fatty acid-mediated inhibition of glucose utilization
  stems from the allosteric effects of metabolites whose concentration rise in response
  to increased β-oxidation. At the same time, the activity of phosphofructokinase
  (PFK), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycolysis, is inhibited by citrate.
  The resulting increase in glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) levels in turn inhibits
  the activity of hexokinase (HK), and rates of glucose uptake are decreased. The
  mechanism for a reciprocal relation between glucose and fatty acid oxidation was
  first shown in the heart by McGarry et al. (). Increased flux of glucose through
  the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex inhibits β-oxidation through an increase
  in cytosolic malonyl-CoA, which acts as an inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1 (CPT1) reaction (green). We propose that in the stressed heart, an additional
  level of control exists to limit excess substrate supply through inhibition of the
  insulin signaling pathway. As suggested by Shulman (), an alternative mechanism
  for fatty acid-mediated inhibition of glucose uptake exists, in which the accumulation
  of fatty acid metabolites such as diacylglycerol, fatty acyl-CoA, and ceramides
  leads to the activation of novel PKC isoforms and to the inhibitory phosphorylation
  of insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) (purple). Recent studies by James and colleagues
  () and Beauloye and colleagues () suggest that both mitochondrial and cytosolic
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) decrease insulin sensitivity as a way to limit their
  own production (blue). Both mechanisms may therefore restore substrate homeostasis
  by decreasing the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4, and possibly of
  the fatty acid transporter CD36, at the sarcolemma. NOX2, NADPH oxidase 2; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; ACL, ATP citrate
  lyase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Fru-1,6-P2, fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase.
