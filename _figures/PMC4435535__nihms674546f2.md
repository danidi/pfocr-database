caption: In response to cold ambient temperature, sympathetic nervous system releases
  catecholamine, which binds with β-adrenergic receptor and activates lipolysis through
  the cAMP pathway. Fatty acids (FAs) can directly activate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)
  for heat production. Notch target gene Hes1 directly binds to the promoter region
  of Prdm16, Ppargc1a and Pparγ, and inhibit their transcription. This leads to reduced
  mitochondria numbers and expression of UCP1. Notch signaling promotes activation
  and production of proinflammatory cytokines mediated by NF-κB, which attracts macrophages
  and together cause low-grade systematic inflammation and exacerbates insulin resistance.
  In obesity, infiltrated macrophages activate transcription of Notch ligand Dll4
  through NF-κB. Dotted line indicates indirect effect. IL-1β, interleukin 1β; TNFα,
  tumor necrosis factor α; IL-1R, interleukin 1 receptor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor
  receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells;
  Dll4, delta-like 4; Pparγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; PGC1α,
  Pparγ coactivator 1-alpha; Prdm16, PR domain containing 16;.
