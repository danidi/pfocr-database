caption: A. Neurons utilize both SVs (blue) and SGs (yellow) to communicate; the vacuolar
  ATPase is involved in the acidification of both compartments. SGs can be released
  from axons and from dendrites. The synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh) from choline
  and AcCoA occurs in the presynaptic cytosol and is catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase
  (ChAT). The vesicular ACh transporter and plasma membrane choline transporter are
  shown; local control of choline uptake, ACh synthesis and vesicular packaging allow
  rapid adjustments to local conditions. B. Schematic showing formation of immature
  SGs by budding from the TGN. Removal of non-secretory granule proteins and membrane
  remodeling by clathrin coated vesicles occurs as immature SGs mature. The vesicles
  that bud from immature SGs can give rise to constitutive-like secretion or can be
  returned to the TGN. Secretion from constitutive-like vesicles is modulated by two
  Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho-GEFs), Kalirin and Trio. Mature secretory
  granules are formed by further acidification and can release their contents in response
  to secretagogue stimulation. The regulated secretory pathway is different from the
  constitutive pathway, in which vesicles that bud from the TGN fuse with the plasma
  membrane and do not require any stimulus for exocytosis.
