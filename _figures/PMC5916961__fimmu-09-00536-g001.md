caption: Mitochondria are a platform for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) signal
  transduction and regulation. In intact cells, intracellular signaling pathways of
  several critical PRRs physically interact with mitochondria to act as a modulator.
  RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (retinoic acid- inducible gene I and melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 MDA5) signals are dependent of MAVS, the activation of which (oligomerization)
  is enhanced by mtROS and mitochondrial fusion [regulated by mitofusin (MFN) 1 and
  MFN2]. NLRP3-inflammasome assembly also interacts with MAVS for proper activation.
  Moreover, mtROS and several mtDAMPs activate the NLRP3-inflammasome (see Figure
  ). Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1, TLR2, and TLR4 ligation leads to the enrichment of
  TRAF6 and Evolutionarily Conserved Signaling Intermediate In Toll Pathway (ECSIT)
  (a complex I–assembly factor) at the mitochondrial periphery and subsequent recruitment
  of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes were they produce mtROS. TLR7 signaling
  involves the mitochondrial protein membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger 5 (MARCH5),
  which catalyzes the polyubiquitination and degradation of TANK a repressor of TLR7
  signaling pathway.
