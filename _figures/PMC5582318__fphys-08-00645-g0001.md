caption: 'The multi-level complexity underlying the host-pathogen interaction in bacterial
  lung infection. Top: At the tissue level the infection involves the movement in
  the tissue compartment of multiple cell types, including bacteria, epithelial cells
  and immune cells like macrophages and neutrophils. During their movement, these
  cells interact with each other via physical contact (e.g., bacteria recognized by
  macrophages via TLR receptors) or through gradients of chemical signal secreted
  into the extracellular medium (chemokines from immune and epithelial cells, or virulence
  factors from bacteria). These events happen sequentially: for example, upon bacteria
  detection, epithelial cells secrete chemokines like IL-8 and CXCL5, and they guide
  neutrophils to the site of infection that can remove clear pathogens (see the plot).
  Centre: Cell-to-cell communications rely both on physical contact and the secretion
  of chemokines. Chemokines trigger the activation of distinctive, complex regulatory
  intracellular networks that can alter cell phenotypes or promote the secretion of
  more cytokines. For example, upon bacteria-mediated activation epithelial cells
  can secrete MCP-1, a chemokine that attracts macrophages. In turn, activated macrophages
  can secrete IL-1β, which activates epithelial cells. Bottom: At the intracellular
  level, the activation of epithelial or immune cells is governed by the NFκB pathway.
  NFκB is the key transcription factor mediating the inflammatory response at the
  intracellular level and controlling the production of cytokines in cells. One of
  the motivations to make use of mathematical modeling in the context of bacteria
  lung infection is that, both the cell-to-cell and intracellular levels contain feedback
  loops (see the examples). These loops are known to induce non-linear, counterintuitive
  dynamics, which requires quantitative data and mathematical modeling to be analyzed.'
