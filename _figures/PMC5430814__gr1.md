caption: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a double-edged role in cancer.
  AMPK stimulation promotes activation of tumor repressor p53, increases cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor p27, decreases cyclin A and cyclin B1, and suppresses ras and B-raf
  signaling pathway, resulting in cell cycle arrest and impaired cell proliferation.
  AMPK can induce phosphorylation of TSC2 and raptor to suppress mTOCR1 dependent
  protein synthesis and activate Hippo pathway to inhibit cell growth. The reduced
  HIF-1α transcription activity mediated by AMPK activation leads to the block of
  Warburg effect and the decreased energy supply, contributing to inhibition of tumor
  cell growth in further. Thus, AMPK may exert its anticancer activities through multiple
  approaches mentioned above. However, AMPK may also cooperate with either oncogenes
  or loss of tumor repressors to promote tumorigenesis.
