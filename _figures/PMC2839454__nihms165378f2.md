caption: Certain bacteria (P. gingivalis, M. tuberculosi, B. anthracis) bind CD14
  and induce TLR2-dependent inside-out signaling, mediated by Rac-1, phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K), and cytohesin-1 (Cyt-1), leading to activation of the ligand-binding
  capacity of CR3. The interaction of activated CR3 with bacteria leads to a relatively
  safe internalization and persistence of the bacteria within the cells (reviewed
  by ). On the basis of age-related alterations in the CD14/TLR2/CR3 pathway (), the
  exploitability of CR3 by periodontal pathogens like P. gingivalis could be enhanced
  in advanced age, contributing to increased susceptibility to periodontal disease.
