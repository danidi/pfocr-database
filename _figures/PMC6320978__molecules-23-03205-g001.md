caption: Schematic overview of the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway. Lesion
  recognition leads to GG-NER, whereas stalled transcription leads to TC-NER. This
  is followed by damage verification, incision at 5′ side by ERCC1-XPF and 3′ side
  of the lesion by XPG. The gap left after the incisions is refilled by DNA re-synthesis.
