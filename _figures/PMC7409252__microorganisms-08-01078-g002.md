caption: 'Pathophysiological hypothesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease in
  the context of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral reactivation. The rupture of the epithelial
  junctions increases intestinal permeability and facilitates the passage of microorganisms
  from the intestinal lumen to the lamina propria. Microorganisms are processed by
  dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages through toll-like receptor (TLR). Antigens
  are primed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type II to be presented to T helper
  cells (TH) by TCR (T cell receptor). In the presence of pathogenic bacteria and
  viruses (dysbiosis), MAMPs stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  from epithelial cells, DCs, and macrophages. Activated macrophages synthesize pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-23. ILC, NK, and NKT also participate in pathophysiology
  of IBD. Tregs have a reduced functionality that does not allow them to counteract
  the local inflammatory state. Chemokines such as CXCL1-3-8-10 allow cell recruitment,
  which amplifies local inflammation. MadCAM-1 and α4β7 integrin are important molecules
  for the passage of lymphocytes into the lamina propria. The hematopoietic cells,
  especially monocytes under the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α) and
  chemokines, are recruited from the intestinal mucosa, where they differentiate into
  macrophages. (A) In ulcerative colitis (UC), TH differentiate into TH2 with secretion
  of IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13 and into TH17 with secretion of IL-17 A/F, IL-21, and IL-22.
  IL-9 produced by TH9 cells inhibits cellular proliferation and repair and has a
  negative effect on intestinal barrier function. IL-22 produced by TH22 allow the
  epithelial proliferation. TH2 and TH9 polarization of ulcerative colitis would allow
  viral reactivation and multiplication. Then infection of intestinal cells such as
  epithelial cells would allow TNF-α production and induces an inflammatory amplifying
  loop promoting viral replication. (B) In Crohn disease (CD), TH differentiate into
  TH1 with secretion of INF-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α and into TH17 with secretion of IL-17
  A/F, IL-21, and IL-22. TH1 and TH17 polarization of Crohn disease would allow better
  activation of Tc and would prevent CMV replication by controlling the reservoir.
  The treatments shown in the figure have received approval in France for IBD. The
  monoclonal antibodies anti-TNF-α are commonly used in IBD: Infliximab, Adalimumab,
  and Golimumab are used for both CD and UC. Certolizumab is only recommended for
  CD patients. These treatments inhibit a key player promoting inflammation, the TNF-α.
  Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to the α4β7-integrin that blocks
  lymphocyte trafficking to the gut and is approved for treatment of patients with
  CD and UC. Ustekinumab, a human anti-IL-12 and anti-Il-23 monoclonal antibody, has
  been indicated in CD. JAKs (Janus kinase) are members of intracellular non receptor
  tyrosine protein kinases that convert extracellular signaling into a wide range
  of cellular processes, including immune and inflammatory responses (JAK/STAT pathway).
  Tofacitinib blocks JAKs-mediated inflammatory pathways and modulates the adaptive
  and innate immune responses involved in IBD pathogenesis. Adapted from [,,]. Abbreviations:
