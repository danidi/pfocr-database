caption: Engagement of CD40 induces association with TRAFs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. TRAF3
  competes directly with TRAF2 for CD40 binding, as shown. TRAF3 inhibits TRAF2-mediated
  activation of MAPK and JNK signals and downstream antibody production. Association
  with TRAF2 and cIAP2 induces the ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3, which
  restrains the degradation of the kinase NIK, and results in activation of the non-canonical
  NF-κB2 signaling pathway.
