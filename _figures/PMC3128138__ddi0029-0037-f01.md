caption: 'a Representation of signaling pathways that are modulated by BAs. Genomic
  and nongenomic actions of BAs are mediated by NRs and GPCRs. The BAs that modulate
  the activity of the receptor are indicated in the arrows and sorted by decreasing
  potency (left: high, right: low). Arrows in dark grey indicate agonistic actions,
  white indicates antagonistic/inhibitory actions and light grey indicates a modulatory
  effect, either agonistic or antagonistic. Receptors for which only a limited number
  of BAs were tested are indicated with dashed arrows. *Only conjugated forms of LCA
  and deoxycholic acid (DCA) are reported to activate the muscarinic receptors. FPR
  = Formyl-peptide receptor. b Simplified overview of the TGR5-signaling pathway leading
  to downstream signaling via cAMP induction. AC = Adenylate cyclase.'
