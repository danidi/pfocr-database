caption: Following recognition of the missing telomere, ATM and ATR phosphorylate
  checkpoint kinases Chk2 and Chk1. Caspase-dependent cell death is mediated by signaling
  through p53, or alternatively, via the aneuploidy-triggered pathway. A second p53-independent
  cell death pathway is mediated through Chk2. Portions of this model are based on
  identified DNA damage response pathways in Drosophila and the role of ATM in mammalian
  cells –, , , , , –.
