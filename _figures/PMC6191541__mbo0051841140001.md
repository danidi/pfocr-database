caption: Aromatic catabolism and gene regulation in R. palustris. (A) Benzoate is
  activated to its CoA thioester by BadA. Hydroxybenzoate can also be converted to
  benzoyl-CoA in multiple steps by HbaA and HbaBC. The benzene ring of benzoyl-CoA
  is reduced by BadDEFG, yielding cyclohex-1,5-ene-carboxyl-CoA, which is further
  reduced by BadJ to cyclohex-1-ene-carboxyl-CoA. The latter is the entry point for
  cyclohexanecarboxylate into the pathway. Cyclohex-1-ene-carboxyl-CoA undergoes a
  ring reduction, ring cleavage, and several β-oxidations to eventually form acetyl-CoA.
  Arrows between cyclohex-1-ene-carboxyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA represent a simplified
  version of enzymatic reactions carried out by BadK, BadH, and BadI. BadA, benzoyl-CoA
  synthetase; HbaA, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA synthetase; HcrABC, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA
  reductase; BadDEFG, benzoyl-CoA reductase; BadB, ferredoxin; AliA, cyclohexancarboxyl-CoA
  synthetase; AliB, cyclohexancarboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Adapted from Harwood and
  Gibson (). (B) Gene regulation of the badDEFGAB operon. Under low-oxygen conditions,
  phosphorylated FixL (FixL-P) relays its phosphate to FixJ, and FixJ-P activates
  expression of the global regulator, fixK. FixK activates aadR transcription, and
  AadR activates expression of the badDEFGAB operon (). BadM is an Rrf2-like regulator
  that represses the badDEFGAB operon (). The promoter region of BadM has been characterized
  and lies between badD and the upstream gene, badC (not shown). FixL, sensor histidine
  kinase; FixJ, response regulator; FixK, transcriptional regulator; AadR, Crp-like
  transcriptional activator; BadM, transcription factor.
