caption: JAK/STAT signaling pathway regulated autophagy and EMT. Activation of JAK/STAT
  protein is stimulated by IL-6, leading to the up-regulation of the expression of
  MMP-2 and SNAIL and activation of EMT. On the other hand, the extracellular IL-6–mediated
  JAK/STAT signaling pathway accelerates the cancer process by prohibiting autophagy.
  Furthermore, autophagy induction hinders EMT through suppressing JAK/STAT signaling
