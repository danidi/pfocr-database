caption: Identification of missing genes necessary for FK228 biosynthesis in Chromobacterium
  violaceum no. 968. (A) Local genetic map of two candidate PPTase-encoding genes,
  with the sfp gene product postulated to participate in phosphopantetheinylation
  of carrier proteins of the FK228 biosynthetic pathway. (B) Local genetic map of
  three candidate AT-encoding genes, with the fabD1 and fabD2 gene products postulated
  to provide AT activities to complement the AT-less PKS modules on DepBC proteins
  for FK228 biosynthesis. (C) Scheme of two AT-less PKS modules on DepBC proteins
  that require a PPTase for carrier protein phosphopantetheinylation and a trans AT
  for polyketide chain elongation in FK228 biosynthesis. An inactive DH domain is
  shown in light gray and labeled as DHi. KS, AT, ACP, DH, KR, and PPTase are standard
  abbreviations of domain/enzyme names that have been described in the text.
