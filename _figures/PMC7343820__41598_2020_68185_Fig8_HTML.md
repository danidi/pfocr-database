caption: AChR antibody-induced effects on myotubes expressing AChR clusters. 1. Cholesterol
  is involved in AChR internalization, modulation and recycling. 2. The dynamic process
  of actin polymerization and turnover is involved in AChR internalization. 3. Multiple
  myosin family genes and muscle contraction pathway genes were differentially expressed.
  4. AChR antibodies induced an active response of extracellular matrix molecules.
  5. Dysregulation of cellular homeostasis genes correlated closely with changes in
  lncRNA MEG3 gene expression.
