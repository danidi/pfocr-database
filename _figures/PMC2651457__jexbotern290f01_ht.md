caption: The monolignol biosynthesis pathway. The grey route is the most favoured
  in angiosperms. All the enzymatic reactions presented in the pathway have been demonstrated
  at least in vitro. Because of the variety of isoenzymes and kinetic properties,
  alternative routes through the metabolic pathway may exist. For reactions with a
  question mark, the respective enzyme is unknown. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase;
  C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; CAOMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; F5H, ferulic
  acid 5-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase; CCoAMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; HCT, p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydoxylase.
