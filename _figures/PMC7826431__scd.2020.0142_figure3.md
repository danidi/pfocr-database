caption: Open questions regarding NB–MSC interactions. (A) Metastasis is dependent
  on the cell's capacity to migrate to distant sites. Whether MSCs are a source of
  TGF-β and MMP-9 or activate Notch signaling in NB cells, all of which are known
  to be involved in EMT and invasion in NB [,,], remains to be elucidated in NB. Furthermore,
  the PI3K/AKT pathway and STAT3 signaling have been implicated to contribute to EMT
  [,]. (B) Additional signaling between NB cells and MSCs through cytokines, chemokines,
  and growth factors (purple) might contribute to tumor proliferation and -survival.
  CCL5 [], MMPs [], and Notch signaling [] have been described to contribute to cancer
  cell motility, invasion, and differentiation into CAFs. MSC-derived IFNα, in contrast,
  was suggested to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells []. Furthermore, the cargo
  of exosomes derived from metastatic NB cells (red) and the signaling it induces
  in MSCs is an interesting field of research []. (C) To prevent EMDR and induction
  of dormancy through MSCs, the signaling components from MSCs contributing to these
  processes need to be studied in detail. It has been described that MSCs induce expression
  of S1PR1 in NB cells, which protected NB cells from drug-induced apoptosis through
  the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway []. In breast cancer, miRNA-loaded exosomes promoted
  quiescence in tumor cells [,]. CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; EMDR, environment-mediated
  drug resistance; IFNα, interferon α; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinases. Color images
  are available online.
