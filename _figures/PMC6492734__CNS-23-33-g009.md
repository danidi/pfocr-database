caption: Schematic diagram suggested a neuroprotective mechanism for melatonin against
  LPS‐induced ROS, acute neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. The diagram depicts
  a potential mechanism by which melatonin prevents LPS‐induced oxidative stress,
  acute neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration via a SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway
  in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region of PND7 rat brains.
