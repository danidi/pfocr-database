caption: 'TGF-β signaling induced apoptosis is modulated by the UPR cascade. Under
  severe or prolonged endoplasmic reticulum stress caused by TGF-β signaling, UPR
  stimulates apoptosis through the following 3 proteins: PERK, IRE1 and ATF4. These
  proteins increase the expression of transcription factors CHOP, XBP1 and ATF4, which
  promote apoptosis and upregulate TGF-β1 expression, thus augmenting TGF-β signaling.
  Additionally, UPR propagates apoptosis via the JNK signaling pathway, which can
  also be induced by TGF-β. TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; UPR, unfolded protein
