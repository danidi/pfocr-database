caption: Risk factors/loci and associated cellular processes identified by genome
  wide association studies (GWAS) involved in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) converge to
  the proteostasis network. APP, amyloid precursor protein; PSEN1, presenilin 1; PSEN2,
  presenilin 2; ADAM10, ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10; CLU, clusterin; CR1, complement
  C3b/C4b receptor 1; ABCA7, ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 7; CD33, CD33
  molecule; MS4A, membrane spanning 4-domains A; PICALM, phosphatidylinositol binding
  clathrin assembly protein; CD2AP, CD2 associated protein; EPHA1, EPH receptor A1;
  BIN1, bridging integrator 1; APOε4, apolipoprotein E4; SORL1, sortilin related receptor
  1. Various risk loci have been identified by GWAS to be associated with AD. Some
  of these risk loci are clustered to important cellular processes in this figure
  to depict their relationship with the proteostasis network, highlighting its significance
  in AD pathology. Previous studies suggest an important role of the proteostasis
  network in cellular processes associated with AD, including amyloid formation pathway,
  immune response mechanisms, vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and lipid metabolism.
