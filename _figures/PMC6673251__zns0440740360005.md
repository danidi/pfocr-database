caption: 'Microarray analysis of the expression fold difference in TCA cycle and aspartate–malate
  shuttle enzymes between GLT1+/Gfap-GFP−/+ astrocytes (n = 6) and Thy1+ neurons (n
  = 3). The number- and color-coded circles indicate an enzyme (number) and the expression
  level (color) of that specific enzyme. The coding is indicated in the key; enzymes
  labeled “No difference” were not significantly different between astrocytes and
  neurons. “Up in astrocytes” and “Up in neurons” indicate a significantly increased
  fold difference (FD) in the gene expression in astrocytes relative to neurons and
  in neurons relative to astrocytes, respectively (unpaired two-sided Student''s t
  test, corrected p < 0.05). a, Key to TCA cycle enzymes: 1, Cs; 2, Aco1 and Aco2;
