caption: Antiviral signaling pathways induced during viral infection. Cellular detection
  of microbial molecules known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, i.e.,
  viral RNA) is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including cytosolic
  RNA sensors (i.e., RIG-I, MDA-5, or LGP2) and/or membrane-bound TLRs. PAMP/PRR interaction
  activates signal transduction cascades (black arrows) that result in the production
  of IFN and inflammatory cytokines. RIG-I and MDA5 contain two caspase recruitment
  domains (CARD) and an RNA helicase domain. In the case of RIG-I, ubiquitination
  (green circles) is required for its effective activation. Activated signals from
  either RIG-I or MDA5 are transmitted downstream via the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS
  resulting in the formation of MAVS filaments. At this stage, different PTMs such
  as ubiquitination or ISGylation (black circles) can regulate their functions. Endosomal
  RNAs are detected by TLR3 or TLR7/8 which signal through adaptor proteins TRIF and
  MyD88, respectively. MyD88 uses other adaptors, IRAK1/4, to allow for interaction
  with TRAF proteins. In addition to their role as adaptor proteins, TRAFs also serve
  as E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases to regulate signaling. TRAF-mediated induction of poly-Ub
  is sensed by NEMO, thus recruiting downstream effector kinases such as TBK1 or IKK.
  These proteins form different signaling complexes (i.e., NEMO/TBK1 and NEMO/IKK),
  leading to phosphorylation (blue arrows) of transcription factors IRF3/7 (to a lesser
  extent IRF1 and IRF5 are also phosphorylated). IRF phosphorylation triggers dimerization
  and translocation (orange arrows) to the nucleus where they bind mainly to IFN promoters/enhancers.
  Alongside with this pathway, TRAF6-E3 ligases can activate MAPK3 and other kinases
  including ERK1/2 and JNK which phosphorylate the components of the AP1 heterodimer,
  allowing for translocation to the nucleus and binding to the IFNβ promoter/enhancer
  to activate transcription. Activated IKK also phosphorylates IκB, releasing NF-κB,
  which then translocates to the nucleus and binds at the IFNβ promoter. AP-1, activating

    cytosolic RNA sensors (i.e., RIG-I, MDA-5, or LGP2) and/or membrane-bound TLRs.
    PAMP/PRR interaction activates signal transduction cascades (black arrows) that
