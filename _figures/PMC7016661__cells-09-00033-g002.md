caption: Overview of the TNF-TNFR2 signaling pathway. In both cancer cell and immunosuppressive
  cells, TNFR2 is activated by both soluble TNF (sTNF) and membrane-bound TNF (mTNF)
  but it is fully activated by mTNF. TNFR2 does not interact with an intracellular
  DD, while it interacts with complex I that consists of TRAF2 with cIAP1 and cIAP2
  and induction of homeostatic signals. The signals travel from complex I either via
  receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) or Etk (a member
  of the Btk tyrosine kinase family). RIPK1 trigger NF-κB via the IkB kinase (IKK)
  complex, which results in increasing the transcription of several genes associated
  positively with cell survival and proliferation. However, the Etk, through the PI3K/Akt
  pathway, is able to activate both AP1 and MAPK signaling pathways, which activate
  the promoter of proliferation, survival and other transcription factors. Further,
  it is associated with enhancing the phosphorylation of STAT5 that play a crucial
  role in immunosuppression.
