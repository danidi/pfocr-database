caption: 'Homocysteine (Hcy) metabolic pathway. Folate and vitamin B12 are cofactors
  in the one carbon metabolism, during which they promote the remethylation of homocysteine.
  Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency inhibits the metabolism from Hcy to methionine,
  and causes hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCy). Vitamin B6 deficiency also inhibits the
  conversion of Hcy to cystathionine and causes hyperhomocysteinemia. SAM: S-adenosylmethionine;
  SAH: S-adenosylhomocysteine; Hcy: homocysteine; Vit B6: vitamin B6, Vit B12: vitamin
  B12; THF: tetrahydrofolate; 5-Methyl THF: 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; MTHFR: 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; MS: methionine synthase.'
