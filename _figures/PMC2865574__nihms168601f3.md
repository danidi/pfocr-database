caption: Wnt signaling is a complex pathway, believed to be involved in the regulation
  of divergent processes, including the maintenance of pluripotency and commitment
  to differentiation. To resolve these divergent responses to activation of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling, we have developed a model in which β-catenin/CBP-mediated transcription
  is critical for the maintenance of potency, whereas a switch to β-catenin/p300-mediated
  transcription is the first critical step to initiate differentiation. Hence the
  balance between CBP and p300-mediated β-catenin transcription regulates the balance
  between maintenance of potency and the initiation of commitment to differentiate.
  The interaction of β-catenin with either CBP or p300 can be modulated by two small
  molecules, respectively ICG-001 and IQ-1, identified in our laboratory. As a consequence,
  these small molecules regulate Wnt signaling pathway outcomes.
