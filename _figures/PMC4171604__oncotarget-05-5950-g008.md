caption: Exposure of PCa cells to hydralazine probably leads to demethylation of a
  critical gene that codifies a protein X that regulates EGFR phosphorylation. The
  re-expression of this protein will induce a significant decrease in EGFR phosphorylation
  and, consequently, in downstream targets, namely, SRC, MEK1/2 and Akt. Reduced expression
  of SRC may cause a decrease in JNK and C-Jun proto-oncogene leading to decreased
  motility and invasion capacity of PCa cells. Moreover, a decrease in MAPK pathway
  induced by SRC and/or directly via EFGR impairment, could explain the decrease in
  proliferation and cell cycle arrest observed in this cell line after hydralazine
  exposure. Finally, a decrease in Akt expression may lead to cell death and decreased
  tumor angiogenesis. The disruption of these cancer networks through deregulation
  EGF pathway by hydralazine might be responsible for the attenuation of the malignant
  phenotype of DU145 cells.
