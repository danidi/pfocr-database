number: Figure 4
caption: This Figure reports those drugs that have been shown to modulate NF-κB in
  Ph+ leukemias. In particular, NF-κB signaling can be modulated by IKK inhibitors
  (such as PS1145, BAY11-67082, AS602868), proteasome inhibitors (Bortezomid) or with
  drugs able to act at the transcriptional level (alantolactone, parthenolide).
