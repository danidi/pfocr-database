caption: Possible mechanisms of estrogen/androgen action in the prevention of NAFLD/NASH.
  The estrogen/ERα pathway mainly suppresses hepatic steatosis by decreasing lipogenesis
  in zone 3 through the induction of P-ACC and improving mitochondrial function by
  inhibiting proton leakage (closed arrows). The androgen/AR pathway mainly suppresses
  hepatic steatosis by increasing CPT-1-mediated β-oxidation in zone 1 and decreasing
  cholesterol synthesis (open arrows). Altogether, estrogen/androgen modulate hepatic
  lipid metabolism and subsequently normalize the mitochondrial function.
