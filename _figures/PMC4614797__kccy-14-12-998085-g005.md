caption: 'Cyclins and CKIs regulate cell motility. (A) Cyclins and CKIs target RhoA-ROCK
  pathway: RhoA, stimulated by its GEF activates ROCK , that in return stimulates
  LIMK. Cyclins and CKI regulate the pathway at multiple levels. Phosphorylated cytoplasmic
  p27 interferes between RhoA and its GEF and also inhibit stathmin. Cyclin D1 represses
  ROCK and Thrombospondin gene transcription and when bound to p27, it interferes
  with RhoA activation. Furthermore, Cyclin D1 indirectly stabilizes p27 via the regulation
  of kinases involved in its degradation or its cytoplasmic localization. Cyclin A2,
  independently of CDKs binding and via direct interaction with RhoA and RhoC, regulates
  their activity. In contrast to p27, cyclin A2 stimulation RhoA GEFs. How cyclin
  A2 interferes with RhoC activation during EMT and whether it requires CDKs binding
  is still unclear. p21 and p57 target kinases downstream of RhoA. While cytoplasmic
  p21 directly inhibit ROCK activity, p57 sequesters LIMK in the nucleus, away from
  its substrates. (B) Cyclin B1-CDK1 is not only involved in phosphorylation of substrates
  involved in cell cycle progression, but also in the phosphorylation of a plethora
  of other targets including molecules intervening in cell motility.'
