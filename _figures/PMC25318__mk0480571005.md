caption: Proposed regulatory role of Ptc1p in the HOG response pathway (; ). When
  yeast cells are exposed to conditions of high extracellular osmolarity, the HOG
  MAP kinase cascade (shown above) is activated, producing a variety of cellular responses,
  including glycerol production. Under conditions of normal extracellular osmolarity,
  the kinase cascade is inactivated. Yeast cells also contain a second transmembrane
  osmosensor, Sho1p (not shown), which activates the Pbs2p kinase directly in response
  to high osmolarity (; ).
