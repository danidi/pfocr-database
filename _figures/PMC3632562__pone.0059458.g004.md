caption: PAK1 resides in inactive homo- or heterodimers. Binding of the Rho-GTPase,
  RAC1 (or CDC42) causes dissociation of the dimers and activation of PAK1. PAK1 activates
  LIMK1, which inhibits cofilin-mediated f-actin depolymerization. PAK1 may be subject
  to activation by non-GTPase mechanisms, and can activate other effector pathways,
  some of which (e.g. MLCK and MLC) may also impact spine dynamics. Blue indicates
  promotion of dendritic spine persistence, red indicates promotion of spine elimination.
