caption: A. Neurons expressing NAAG synthetase I (NAAGS I) mediate the synthesis of
  NAAG but not NAAG2. In this cell, NAAG is co-released with a primary amine transmitter,
  such as glutamate, under conditions of elevated neuronal activity. NAAG is released
  into the perisynaptic space where it activates presynaptic and glial type 3 metabotropic
  glutamate receptors (mGluR3). NAAG is inactivated by glutamate carboxypeptidases
  II (GCPII) and III (GCPIII), forming N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate (Glu),
  which are transported into glial cells. Inhibition of the peptidases GCPII and GCPIII
  by a NAAG peptidase inhibitor, such as ZJ43, reduces inactivation of NAAG and raises
  perisynaptic NAAG level. In animal models, the NAAG peptidase inhibitor-mediated
  elevation of peptide levels increases the activation of mGluR3 receptors on axon
  endings, inhibiting transmitter release and reducing pathology. In a second neuroprotective
  pathway, NAAG activation of mGlu3 receptors on glial cells stimulates the release
  of a trophic factor, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). B. Neuron synthesizing
  NAAG2 via NAAG synthetase II (NAAGS II) may release both NAAG and NAAG2.
