caption: Activation of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway in response to ampicillin
  and glycopeptides in Enterococcus faecium. (A) Map of the ddc locus and role of
  the encoded proteins in peptidoglycan synthesis. The black boxes represent the undecaprenyl
  lipid transporter inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane. Phosphates are indicated
  by circled Ps. Transcriptional activation by DdcRS involves autophosphorylation
  of DdcS on a His residue (H∼P) and subsequent transfer of the phosphate group onto
  an Asp residue of DdcR (D∼P). Peptidoglycan cross-linking by l,d-transpeptidase
  Ldtfm involves cleavage of the l-Lys3-d-Ala4 peptide bond of a stem tetrapeptide
  (acyl donor) and formation of an amide bond between the carbonyl of l-Lys3 and the
  α-amino group of d-iAsn of the acyl acceptor. (B) Characteristics of the parental
  strain D344S and mutants M1 to M9. Serial selection was performed with ampicillin
  (Ap), vancomycin (Vm), or teicoplanin (Tc) at the indicated concentrations. The
  resulting increases in MICs for the three drugs are indicated. Selection for resistance
  resulted in increased UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide (shown as a percentage of the total
  cytoplasmic pool of precursors) to the detriment of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide following
  hydrolysis of d-Ala5 by d,d-carboxypeptidase DdcY. NA, not applicable.
