caption: ADAR2-mediated RNA editing in metabolic disorders. The color of the first
  arrow in each pathway indicates the mechanism (refer to Figure ) by which ADAR2
  regulates its direct targets, depicted in pink icons or shapes. Dashed lines indicate
  suggested/unproven functions/relationships. Additional activators and inhibitors
  of specific pathway steps are depicted in red and yellow rounded rectangles, respectively.
  CVD, cardiovascular disease. The figure was created with BioRender.
