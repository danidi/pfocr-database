caption: 'Model of feedback regulation for the maintenance of zinc homeostasis in
  the ER (in the early secretory pathway). A disturbance in zinc homeostasis, such
  as zinc deficiency or zinc overload, in the ER (and perhaps in the early secretory
  pathway) induces homeostatic ER stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) leads
  to the activation of transcription factors such as ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1, and increases
  the transcription of several ZNT and ZIP transporter genes. These activities of
  ZNT and ZIP transporters then contribute to the maintenance of zinc homeostasis
  in the ER (and in the early secretory pathway), and thus attenuate homeostatic ER
  stress. Zn: zinc.'
