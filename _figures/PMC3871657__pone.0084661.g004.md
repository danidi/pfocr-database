caption: cerevisiae engineered strains. The engineered pathway in yeast with enhanced
  fatty acid synthesis was indicated by red dashed box. Both of the up-regulated and
  down regulated metabolic pathways in ∆idh1/2-acl strain were indicated by the different
  colored arrows. The proteins involved in other pathways that haven’t been detected
  from LC-MS/MS analysis were not shown in this diagram.
