caption: An illustrative model of amelioration of ER stress–induced β-cell apoptosis
  by GKA. Activation of glucokinase in β-cells induces insulin secretion and the upregulation
  of IRS-2, which results in the activation of insulin signaling and β-cell proliferation.
  Under ER stress, GKA correspondingly increases IRS-2 and inactivates GSK-3β by its
  phosphorylation (1). GKA also decreases CHOP expression via ERK-dependent pathway
  and increases the expression of ER stress–related molecules, such as Stc2, Ero-1,
  Sdf2l1, and Edem-2 (2). These multiple pathways in β-cells coordinately suppress
  the proapoptotic gene Bax, allowing adaptation and survival against ER stress. VDCC,
  voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel; KATP channel, ATP-sensitive potassium channel.
