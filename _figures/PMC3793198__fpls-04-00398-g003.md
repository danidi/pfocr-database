caption: 'Overview of the NO production and removal mechanisms in plants. (A) Main
  components of the NO biosynthetic machinery: (1) Nitrite-dependent NO production
  in plants includes a non-enzymatic pathway and several enzymatic pathways involving
  the action of cytosolic and plasma membrane nitrate reductases (NR), nitrite–NO
  reductase (NiNOR), mitochondrial electron transport chain (CIII/IV) and xanthine
  oxidoreductase (XOR). (2) L-Arginine-dependent NO production pathway involves a
  non-identified nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like enzyme and two still poorly characterized
  pathways using hydroxylamine (HA) or polyamines (PAs) as substrates. (B) Main components
  of the NO removal machinery: (3) the reaction of NO with molecular oxygen leads
  to the spontaneous production of nitrite and nitrate. (4) NO can react with non-symbiotic
  hemoglobins (nsHbs) resulting in nitrate formation. (5) Alternatively, NO may react
  with reduced glutathione (GSH) to form S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which, in turn,
  can be converted into oxidized GSSG and ammonia by the action of GSNO reductase
  (GSNOR). (6) NO can also react with superoxide (), resulting in the formation of
  peroxynitrite (OONO-). (7) By influencing the production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), NO-ASSOCIATED 1 (NOA1) protein indirectly impacts NO levels in plants.'
