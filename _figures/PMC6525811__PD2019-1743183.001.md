caption: miR-7 playing a neuroprotective role in PD. miR-7 has multiple direct targets,
  including α-syn, Bax, Sir2, RelA, Nlrp3, VDAC1, and Keap1. By directly targeting
  the 3′-UTR of α-syn, miR-7 significantly reduces α-syn expression. miR-7 downregulates
  Nlrp3 through direct targeting and inhibiting α-syn upstream, resulting in decreased
  levels of IL-1β and IL-18 and alleviating neuroinflammation. In another pathway,
  miR-7 inhibits Bax and Sir2 expression, preventing apoptosis. Additionally, miR-7
  downregulates RelA, which causes downstream upregulation of NF-κB and Glut3, resulting
  in the activation of gene expression in glycolysis and NF-κB pathways. Moreover,
  by directly targeting VDAC1, miR-7 activates mitochondrial function. miR-7 also
  reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. All of the above
  contribute to the neuroprotective roles of miR-7 in PD.
