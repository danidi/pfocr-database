caption: (1) NMBA induces Akt activation in esophageal epithelium cells, resulting
  in the acceleration of cell cycle and the inhibition of apoptosis. (2) At the early
  stage of carcinogenesis, α-Tocopherol effectively increases the expression of PPARγ
  and PTEN, which attenuated the activation of Akt signaling pathway leading to cell
  cycle arrest and enhanced cell apoptosis. α-Tocopherol is effective in ESCC prevention
  during this stage. (3) As the pathologic lesions progressed (late stage), PPARγ
  and Akt become constitutively activated and insensitive to α-Tocopherol. Supplementation
  with α-Tocopherol at this stage is not effective for ESCC prevention.
