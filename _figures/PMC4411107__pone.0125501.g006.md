caption: During infections or autoimmune responses, SSB molecules are released from
  damaged tissues and dead cells. The free SSB molecules activate PMN via MAPK pathways
  and NF-κB nuclear translocation to transcribe the IL-8 gene. TNF-α and SSB-anti-SSB
  immune complexes, which may utilize TNF-α receptors (TNFR) and Fc-gamma receptors
  (FcγR), respectively, augment IL-8 production probably through a final common pathway.
