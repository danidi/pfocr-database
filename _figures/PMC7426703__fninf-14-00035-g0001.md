caption: Metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons. Astrocytes, supply
  neurons with several metabolites, including amino acids like alanine and aspartate,
  antioxidant molecules like glutathione or lactate which is metabolized by astrocytes
  from glucose through the glycolytic pathway and exported to the extracellular space
  and internalized by neurons. Moreover, astrocytes are important in de novo synthesis
  of neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate, as they express pyruvate carboxylase, and
  high-affinity excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Finally, astrocytes also
  recycle the excess of glutamate from the extracellular space, thus preventing neuronal
  excitotoxicity.
