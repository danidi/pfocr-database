caption: Signaling pathways and deregulation of its modalities such as Stat3/mTor,
  Hedgehog, Notch and Wnt/-catenin cascade defined as a new therapeutic strategy in
  the prevention of cancer extension, especially CSCs growth behaviors modification
  (). Multiple aspects of cell signaling make this alternative so susceptible and
  targeting that kind of treatment item seems so difficult to utilize in the clinic.
  A lot of new generation drugs withdraw after several experimental and clinical trials,
  in terms of the complexity of signaling pathways., Mentioned signaling items directly
  involved in the developmental of the body during intra uterine life and similarity
  of normal stem cells to CSCs reveal more knowledge in both of them mutually. The
  notch signaling pathway and its cascade in multiple biological aspects finally affected
  CSCs stemness, MDR, and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway. On the intermediated
  modalities in this cascade such as γ-secretase inhibitors and antibodies directed
  showed accepted resulted in a clinical trial in various types of cancers. It is
  critical to know about the diversity of Notch signaling to manipulee of the final
  events in special cancer like breast cancers. Utilizing of Notch signaling inhibitors
  in oncology related to many alternatives such as type of cancer, exact pharmacodynamic
  effects identification and mechanistic understanding of it signaling. For example,
  CD44 as a biomarker in CSCs is Wnt signaling target and knockdown of CD44 diminished
  tumor formation. In another study administration of an antagonist of Wnt decreased
  mammosphere formation.
