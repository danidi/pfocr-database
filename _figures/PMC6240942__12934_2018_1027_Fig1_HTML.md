caption: Diterpene biosynthetic pathways from the universal precursor geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate (GGPP) towards forskolin and ferruginol, compounds present in the root
  cork cells of Coleus forskohlii. The common diterpene precursor GGPP is formed by
  four C5 units from the plastid based 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway
  (MEP). GGPP is cyclized by the class II diterpene synthase (diTPS), CfTPS1, to (+)-copalyl-diphosphate
  and further to miltiradiene by class I diTPS, CfTPS3. Miltiradiene can undergo non-enzymatic
  oxidation into abietatriene, which is hydroxylated to ferruginol by CYP76AH15. The
  forskolin precursor 13R-manoyl oxide is formed from GGPP through (+)-8-hydroxy-copalyl
  diphosphate by the class II diTPS, CfTPS2, and further to 13R-manoyl oxide by the
  class I diTPS, CfTPS3. 13R-manoyl oxide is further converted by CYP76AH15 to 11-oxo-13R-manoyl
  oxide, which is further converted to 9-deoxy-7-deacetylforskolin by the multifunctional
  CYP76AH11 and to deacetyl-forskolin by CYP76AH16. Finally, deacetyl-forskolin is
  acetylated at carbon 7 by CfACT1-8 to forskolin
