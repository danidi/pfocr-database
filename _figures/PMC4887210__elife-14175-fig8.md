caption: 'Body pigment cells produce both porphyrins and ommochrome, using the indicated
  biosynthetic pathways (black arrows). Together, these molecules confer the normal
  brown body color, possibly as a result of a physical interaction or joint use as
  precursors in a downstream biosynthetic step. Porphyrin formation entails PBG deaminase-dependent
  HMB synthesis; limiting (or absent) expression of downstream enzymes in the heme
  biosynthesis pathway (grey) leads to non-enzymatic cyclization of HMB to form uroporphyrinogen
  I, as in the erythroid cells of CEP patients (Discussion). Uroporphyrinogen I is
  a reduced porphyrin that can undergo spontaneous oxidation to form the potent photosensitizer
  uroporphyrin I. Intense light exposure causes porphyrin molecules to generate reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). This has the potential to initiate a positive feedback loop
  in which ROS drive further uroporphyrinogen I oxidation, leading to oxidative stress
  and pigment cell death. Starvation accelerates this response, at least partly through
  induction of ALAS expression and a consequent increase in porphyrin levels.DOI:
