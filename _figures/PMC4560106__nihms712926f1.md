caption: Major changes in the development of hormone-dependent prostate cancer relative
  to normal prostate tissue include decreased levels of zinc (Zn2+), enabling the
  utilization of citrate through the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
  and decreased accumulation polyamines. Upon acquiring castration resistance, the
  prostate metabolic profile exhibits elevated levels of lipids, cholesterol and sterols.
  Furthermore, the level of sarcosine, a derivative of glycine, has been reported
  to accumulate in both hormone-dependent and castration resistant prostate cancers.
  Red indicates significant increase in either metabolite or enzymatic pathway activity.
