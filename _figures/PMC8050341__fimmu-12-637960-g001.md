caption: The mitochondria and fatty acid metabolism in Tregs. The core of Treg metabolism
  centres around mitochondrial activity, which is partially supported by glycolysis.
  Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate; however, glycolytic intermediates
  can feed into other pathways, such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for NADPH
  production and the hexosamine pathway for amine sugar production (i.e. UDP-GlcNac)
  involved in post-translational modifications (PTM). If the end product of glycolysis
  is pyruvate, which can enter the mitochondria, it is termed oxidative glycolysis.
  However, if glucose-derived pyruvate is shunted toward lactate production it is
  termed aerobic glycolysis. Pyruvate enters mitochondria through the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) and generates acetyl CoA to drive the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. PHD
  is negatively regulated by PDH kinase. While the TCA cycle can generate amino acids,
  its function is to regenerate NADH which is critical for electron transport chain
  (ETC) function. The ETC, composed of complexes I-IV, builds a proton motif force
  to drive the generation of ATP by ATP synthase. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
  (mROS) are produced at complex I and III. Fatty acids through fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) can also provide acetyl CoA units for the TCA cycle. Tregs store fatty acids
  in the form of lipid droplets, which are partially taken up from the environment.
  The fatty acid binding protein (FABP5) is a chaperone for long chain fatty acids
  (LCFAs) and plays a key role in mitochondrial structure. LCFAs require assisted
  entry into the mitochondria, which is mediated by CPT1 and CPT2. Other sources of
  fatty acids are the short chain (SCFAs) and medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), that
  pass freely into the mitochondria. Tregs also perform fatty acid synthesis (FAS)
  which takes mitochondrial citrate and exports it into the cytoplasm to regenerate
  acetyl CoA by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). Acetyl CoA is then committed to fatty acid
  synthesis by the acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). The glycolytic enzyme, enolase (ENO1)
  can also moonlight as a transcription factor and bind to the FOXP3 promoter to mediate
  the generation of different splice forms.
