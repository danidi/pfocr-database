caption: Schematic diagram outlines the proposed pathway of mechanotransduction linking
  β1-integrin to fibronectin expression in HK-2 cells. Cyclic stretch increases β1-integrin
  expression, which leads to the phosphorylation and activation c-Src. This results
  in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, which promotes TGF-β1 production.
  TGF-β1 increases fibronectin synthesis.
