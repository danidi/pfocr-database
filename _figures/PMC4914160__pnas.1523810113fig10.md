caption: Model depicting autophagy receptor recruitment to depolarized mitochondria
  over time. (1) Before a depolarizing injury, mitochondria are elongated and motile.
  (2) Within 15 min of injury, damaged mitochondria recruit PINK1 and Parkin, resulting
  in the phosphoubiquitination of outer membrane proteins and mitochondrial fragmentation.
  (3) Twenty-five minutes after initial damage, and within ∼10 min of the first Parkin
  recruitment, autophagy receptors OPTN, TAX1BP1, and NDP52 are weakly recruited to
  the surface of fragmented mitochondria. OPTN shuttles its upstream kinase TBK1 to
  the mitochondrial surface. Expression of the Parkinson’s disease-associated Parkin-T240R
  mutant blocks recruitment of all three receptors. Additionally, ALS-linked OPTN-E478G
  and OPTN-Q398X mutants are not recruited to ubiquitinated mitochondria. (4) Within
  5–10 min of weak autophagy receptor recruitment, a small number of mitochondria
  display enhanced autophagy receptor recruitment and stabilization, coincident with
  the recruitment of the autophagosome membrane protein LC3. This step is dependent
  on TBK1 phosphorylation of OPTN S177, and is blocked in cells expressing ALS-linked
  TBK1-E696K. Although OPTN and TAX1BP1 depend on TBK1 activity in this pathway, NDP52
  can stabilize on mitochondria and facilitate autophagic engulfment of mitochondria
  even in the absence of TBK1. Thus, high levels of NDP52 can compensate for OPTN
  or TBK1 loss of function. (5) By 40–45 min after the initial damage, fully formed
  autophagosomes develop around mitochondria, effectively sequestering the damaged
  organelles from the surrounding cytosol. Bolded mutants have been linked to neurodegenerative
  disease.
