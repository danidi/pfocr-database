caption: Schematics of the effect IL-1β on the alveolar capillary barrier. Our model
  diagrams the IL-1β signaling pathway that leads to an increase in lung epithelial
  and endothelial permeability. IL-1β causes an increase in RhoA activity (a), leading
  to TGF-β activation via the αvβ6 integrin (b). TGF-β induces an increase in permeability
  (c) and an inhibition of the Na+-driven fluid transport (d) in alveolar epithelial
  cells. Subsequent binding of TGF-β on its receptor on endothelial cells induces
  an increase in lung endothelial permeability via a RhoA-dependent phosphorylation
  of the VE-cadherin (f) and a formation of actin stress fibers (i). We further show
  that IL-1β activates RhoA (g) and increases lung endothelial permeability via the
  phosphorylation and endocytosis of β-catenin (h) and αvβ5 integrin–dependent stress
  fiber formation in lung endothelial cells (i).
