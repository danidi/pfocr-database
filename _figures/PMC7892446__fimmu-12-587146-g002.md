caption: Mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 promotes muscle wasting and sarcopenia. A
  proposed mechanism is attributed to the direct viral infection, given that ACE receptors
  are widely expressed in skeletal muscle, especially in satellite cells. Another
  mechanism is attributed to the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 receptor
  in respiratory epithelial cells that diminishes the biodisponibility of the ACE2
  receptor. This promotes a deregulation in the renin-angiotensin-system with elevation
  in Ang II and decreasing in Ang 1-7. Ang II leads to increased levels of myostatin
  and IL-6 and decreased IGF-1 expression. Myostatin modulates the intracellular signaling
  molecules SMAD2/SMAD3, leading to increased expression of atrogens, such as MuRF-1
  and atrogin-1, and inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Moreover, increased IL-6 expression
  plays a role through SOCS3 which also inhibits the IGF1-R signaling pathway. Together,
  these activities promote increased protein breakdown and decrease protein synthesis
  in muscle, which leads to muscle wasting and disability. Ang, angiotensin; MuRF-1,
  muscle ring finger 1; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor 1; IGF1-R, insulin-like growth
  factor 1 receptor; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling.
