caption: The findings in the current study support a signaling pathway wherein hypoxia
  activates ERK1/2 and increases NF-κB p65 levels and activity. Our previous work
  demonstrated that hypoxia stimulated p65 binding to and activation of the Nox4 promoter
  []. The current findings demonstrate that hypoxia-induced Nox4 activity contributes
  to reductions in PPARγ and activation of NF-κB. Hypoxia-induced inhibition of PPARγ
  expression may further enhance NF-κB p65 activation leading to a feed forward cycle
  of increased Nox4 and decreased PPARγ expression and activity. ERK1/2 and NF-κB
  p65 may also directly inhibit PPARγ expression and activity. As a consequence of
  hypoxia exposure, the balance between NF-κB and PPARγ signaling becomes dysregulated
  resulting in the generation of H2O2 which promotes pathological pulmonary vascular
  wall cell proliferation, vascular remodeling, and PH. Interventions that interrupted
  this hypoxic signaling cascade are depicted in italicized text.
