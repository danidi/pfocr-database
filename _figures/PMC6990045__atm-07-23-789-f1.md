caption: The role of mitochondria in metabolism, apoptosis and gene expression. For
  caspase activation by mitochondria, multiple signal factors (such as Ca2+, cAMP
  and ROS) can modify permeability of mitochondrial membrane by activating Bax then
  releasing cyt c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Thereby, cyt c triggers caspase-9
  and initiates the proteolytic cascade that culminates in apoptosis. Simultaneously,
  caspase-8 can also activate Bax by slicing Bid, which results in the similar apoptosis
  pathway. Additionally, mitochondria could provide enough energy for cell by synthesize
  ATP via ETC. Mitochondrial metabolites of TCA cycle (such as ATP, α-KG and citrate)
  could also regulate gene expression via remodeling chromatin. ATP synthesis is dependent
  on mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation driven by the ETC and ATP synthase. SAM
  is one of metabolites of methionine and folate cycles that supported by mitochondrial
  one-carbon cycle. While SAM synthesis requires ATP to support necessary energy for
  chromatin modulating and then binding to genes specially. mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA;
