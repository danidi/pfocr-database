caption: 'Proposed mechanism of glycine-promoted complement-dependent killing. First,
  exogenous glycine passes into the cytoplasm, where it is converted to serine and
  threonine by GlyA and Kbl, respectively; second, serine fluxes to the TCA cycle
  and promotes α-Ketoglutarate generation, which inhibits ATP synthase, while elevated
  glycine, serine and threonine catabolic pathway does not favor fluxing purine metabolism
  due to stronger substrate activation to GlyA, thereby decreasing AMP and ADP biosynthesis.
  These lead to ATP reduction and the decrease of ATP affects cAMP and cAMP-CRP complex;
  third, glycine in conjunction with serum elevates expression and membrane deposition
  of HtrE, NfrA, and YhcD by FlhC and CsgD in a manner of cAMP-CRP complex; and fourth,
  these outer membrane proteins promote binding of complement, formation of MAC and
  subsequent cell death. On the catabolic side, glycine enters the TCA cycle and stimulates
  synthesis of NADH and increases membrane potential, which facilitates the binding
  of complement to the outer membrane. It is clear that metabolites dominate the novel
  demonstrated metabolic regulation pathways. Colors: pink, upregulation; grass green,
  down-regulation'
