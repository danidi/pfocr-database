caption: Elevated expression of mutated / overexpressed oncoproteins activates HSF1
  and leads to elevated HSP expression in mammary carcinomata. HSP expression may
  also be activated through breast cancer signaling pathways altered in cancer, including
  the HER2/ PI-3-kinase pathway. The Hsp70 gene is repressed by p53 family proteins
  either through HSF1 or by direct effects on the HSP70 promoter and these effects
  are reversed in cells in which p53 proteins are inactivated.
