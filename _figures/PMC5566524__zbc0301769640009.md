caption: Schematic representation of TF-FVIIa-dependent PAR2-activated signaling pathway
  that accounts for β-catenin accumulation and expression of metastatic proteins leading
  to enhanced migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells. In the normal condition,
  GSK3β binds to Axin and APC to form an “active phosphorylation complex,” which readily
  phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its proteasomal degradation. In the presence
  of FVIIa, active TF–FVIIa complex is formed and activates PAR2 receptor, leading
  to intracellular activation of AKT via phosphorylation, which again phosphorylates
  GSK3β and inactivates it. As a result, β-catenin remains in a non-degradable unphosphorylated
  state and accumulates inside the cell nucleus to promote the expression of several
  prometastatic genes like cyclin D1, c-Myc, COX-2, MMP-7, MMP-14, and Claudin-1,
  leading to enhanced cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.
