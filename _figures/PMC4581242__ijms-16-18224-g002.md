caption: Hypothetical model for stress response to mitochondrial dysfunction. In response
  to various stresses, several kinases, such as HRI, PKR, PERK, and GCN2, are activated
  and converge to phosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF2α. In turn,
  the phosphorylation of eIF2α has at least two consequences. While the cytosolic
  translation is globally attenuated as it inhibits CAP-dependent translation, mRNAs
  containing a uORF are preferentially translated, such as the transcription factor
  ATF4, which controls the expression of CHOP-10. The profit of this GCN2-eIF2α-ATF4
  pathway might be stress attenuation gained by relieving the load of proteins imported
  into the mitochondria and increasing the expression of integrated stress responsive
  genes.
