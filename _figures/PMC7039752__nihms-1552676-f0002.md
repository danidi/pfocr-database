caption: Anti-inflammatory neural circuits elicited by the stimulation of the efferent
  vagus nerve. In the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, stimulation of the efferent
  vagus nerve appears to transmit a signal to the splenic nerve, although a direct
  connection between the efferent vagus and splenic nerves remains controversial.
  Norepinephrine (NE), released from splenic nerve terminals, interacts with β2-adrenergic
  receptors expressed on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive (acetylcholine-producing)
  T cells in the spleen, which leads to the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from these
  cells. Subsequently, ACh binds to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs)
  expressed on macrophages, resulting in the suppressed production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines by macrophages and suppressed inflammation. This pathway has been demonstrated
  in many inflammatory disease models, including endotoxemia, colitis, and acute kidney
  injury (AKI). Another anti-inflammatory circuit involves a direct interaction between
  ACh released from the myenteric nerve and α7nAChRs expressed on muscularis macrophages
  of the intestine in postoperative ileus. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) causes phenotypic
  changes in peritoneal macrophages toward anti-inflammation, and adoptive transfer
  of these macrophages confers protection from AKI, which requires the spleen. The
  mechanism underlying changes in the phenotype of peritoneal macrophages after VNS
  and interaction of peritoneal macrophages with immune cells in the spleen remains
  unclear. CNS, central nervous system.
