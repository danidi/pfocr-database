caption: Therapeutic approaches of splicing modulation in cancer. (A) Pharmacological
  splicing inhibition using drugs that physically bind to the SF3B complex and disrupt
  its ability to recognize the branchpoint within the intron. See  for representative
  examples. (B) Anticancer sulfonamide compounds promote degradation of RBM39. These
  compounds physically connect RBM39 to the DCAF15-CUL4 ubiquitin ligase, resulting
  in ubiquitinylation of RBM39. This subsequently promotes proteasomal degradation
  of RBM39. See  for representative examples. (C) Pharmacological inhibition of post-translational
  modifications using drugs that interfere with the functions of several enzymes,
  including SR protein kinase family (SRPK), CDC2-like kinases (CLKs), and AKT kinases.
  See  for representative examples. (D) Decoy oligonucleotides containing short repeats
  of RNA-binding motifs can inhibit the function of specific splicing factor by sequestering
  them and prohibiting binding to the target transcript(s). One representative example
  was the transfection of specific decoy oligonucleotides into cancer cells targeting
  SRSF1-binding which resulted in changes in splicing of known targets of SRSF1, including
  MKNK2 []. This subsequently activated the p38–MAPK stress pathway and inhibited
  the proliferation and survival of cancer cells []. (E) Antisense oligonucleotides
  (ASOs) can bind to splicing regulatory sequences or motifs in a targeted transcript,
  and switch splicing to a favorable isoform. One representative example was specific
  ASOs targeting a poison exon of BRD9 in SF3B1-mutant cells, which showed satisfactory
  results in splicing modulation and suppressing tumor growth [].
