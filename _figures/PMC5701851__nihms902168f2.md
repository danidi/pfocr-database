caption: (A) Summary of neuroblast temporal patterning events from embryogenesis through
  the end of the neuroblast lineage in the early pupal stage. In the embryo, a neuroblast-intrinsic
  TTF cascade generates temporal patterning (see text for gene abbreviations). In
  the early larva, extrinsic nutritional cues generate the properly timed exit from
  quiescence. In the late larva, extrinsic hormonal cues generate a switch from early
  candidate TTFs to late candidate TTFs).(B) The nutritional extrinsic signaling pathway
  that triggers neuroblast exit from quiescence (see text for gene abbreviations).(C)
  Comparison of mushroom body neuroblast (MB NB) temporal pattering in the presence
  of dietary amino acids (top) or in the absence of dietary amino acids (bottom).
  Note the failure to undergo proper temporal patterning in the absence of extrinsic
  nutritional cues.
