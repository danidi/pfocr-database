caption: Enrichment of genes for major carbon fixation pathways. (a) CBB cycle; (b)
  rTCA cycle; (c) 3-HP cycle; (d) reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. Diagrams are based
  on KEGG pathway maps. When available, enzyme classification numbers for each step
  were included in boxes. Box color indicated the odds ratio of each enzyme with darker
  red and green color representing higher odds ratio of respective enzyme in the chimney
  4143-1 and lost city chimney metagenome, respectively.
