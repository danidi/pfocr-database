caption: 'Model of spontaneous hprt mutational outcome in wild-type, rad51d and fancg
  mutant cells during replication. Each panel represents one of the three genotypes:
  wild type, rad51d and fancg. On the right in each panel are shown the potential
  mutational outcomes due to a replication fork encountering a polymerase-blocking
  lesion (upper fork) or a single-strand break or gap such as a repair intermediate
  (lower fork). Arrows represent the options for resolving each situation, leading
  to the viable or lethal mutagenic events. Upper panel: In wild-type cells, there
  are two major outcomes (large green arrows): translesion synthesis (TLS) bypasses
  fork blocking lesions (sometimes leading to base substitution, ‘m’), and homologous
  recombination (HR) restarts broken replication forks and prevents mutations. Middle
  panel: The HR-defective rad51d cells, which are presumed to have normal TLS, inefficiently
  restart broken forks in an error-free manner, but retain efficient NHEJ activity,
  as evidenced by a high frequency and proportion of small-sized (non-lethal) deletions
  (large red arrow). NHEJ acts on replication-associated DSBs that arise when replication
  forks break and free-ends persist as replication continues. Lower panel: In the
  fancg cells, the reduced absolute number of base substitutions and small deletions,
  along with the increased rate of gene amplification, suggest diminished TLS and
  HR, as well as the loss of NHEJ activity that produces deletions that are recoverable
  in the hprt mutagenesis assay (as in rad51d cells). The predominant events in fancg
  cells appear to be inviable deletions or rearrangements (large red arrow).'
