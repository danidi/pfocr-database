caption: FO increases the expression of β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus
  to transactivate osteogenesis-related genes. Under normal condition, β-catenin is
  phosphorylated by GSK-3β and consequently degraded through proteasome. FO inhibits
  degradation of β-catenin and increases the movement of β-catenin to nucleus. FO;
  fermented extract of C. gigas and GSK-3β; glycogen synthase kinsase.
