caption: Two signal requirement for inflammasome activation. Inflammasome activation
  requires at least a two signal process. Signal 1 results in transcriptional upregulation
  of procytokines and inflammasome components via an NF-κβ pathway. Signal 2 is provided
  by a diverse range of stimuli and results in assembly of the inflammasome, cleavage
  of caspase-1, and activation and secretion of cytokines. To see this illustration
  in color, the reader is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertpub.com/ars
