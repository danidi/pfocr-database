caption: (A) The Butyricicoccus sp. B MC N15, -N54, and -K4410 genomes contain an
  incomplete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a feature of anaerobes. The genes required
  for the TCA cycle that are present in these genomes are indicated by the colored
  boxes in the pathway map. (B) The N15, N54, and K4410 genomes support acetate production.
  The genes required for acetate production that are present in these genomes are
  indicated by the colored boxes in this pathway map; they indicate that acetate is
  produced from acetyl-P, mediated through an acetate phosphatase. (C) The N15, N54,
  and K4410 genomes support butyrate production, a trait shared by other members of
  the clostridial cluster IV/Clostridium leptum subgroup. The genes required for butyrate
  production that are present in these genomes are indicated by the colored boxes
  in this butyrate pathway map. The diagram shows a complete pathway for synthesis
  of butyrate, starting from acetyl-CoA exiting the TCA cycle.
