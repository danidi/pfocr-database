caption: A, A conceptual model for steroid biosynthesis. Classical steroid production
  begins with a tropic stimulus, which drives the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone
  and maintenance of the downstream enzymes in the steroidogenic cell. Peripheral
  tissues and target cells further metabolize these steroids. B, Major steroidogenic
  pathways in human beings. Enzymes are indicated above and aside arrows, and main
  product steroids of the adrenals, testis, and ovary are underlined. Thin line from
  17-hydroxy-(17OH)-progesterone to androstenedione indicates minor pathway. C, Canonical
  terminal steps of T synthesis from DHEA(S) and fates of T in different tissues.
  T acts directly on AR or indirectly after metabolism to DHT, and aromatase changes
  the biological activity of T via metabolism to E2.
