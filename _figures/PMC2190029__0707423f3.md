caption: Potential mechanisms of cannabinoid/PPAR interactions. (1) Some studies have
  shown that cannabinoids and endocannabinoids directly bind to PPARs to bring about
  changes in target gene expression. (2) Some studies have implicated that it is the
  conversion of cannabinoids into metabolites, which are active at PPARs. (3) A third
  possibility is that cannabinoids, acting at cell surface receptors, may initiate
  intracellular signalling cascades that lead to the activation of PPARs. Potentially,
  all three pathways contribute to the effects of cannabinoid at PPARs, and the relative
  contributions of each pathway may be different between cells and tissues depending
  on the expression of various receptors and enzymes within that cell. PPARs, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptors.
