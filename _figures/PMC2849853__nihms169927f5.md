caption: This diagram shows the two subgroups of TRH neurons recently identified based
  on their signaling modalities. Leptin acts directly on TRH neurons expressing ObRB
  through P-STAT3 signaling, and indirectly by acting on POMC neurons expressing ObRB
  that in turn release α-MSH and stimulate TRH neurons expressing the MC4 receptor
  through P-CREB signaling. A third unidentified group of TRH neurons is proposed
  to be potentially present in the PVN carrying both ObRb and MC4R. The TRH neurons
  carrying the MC4R are mainly involved in the regulation of the HPT axis, whereas
  the direct pathway could be essential in the obese condition. Other neurons stimulated
  by the melanocortin pathway might be involved in sympathetic activity or food intake
  regulation. NPY may regulate TRH neurons through mechanism 1 or 2 depending upon
  the status of the melanocortin system.
