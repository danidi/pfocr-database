caption: Schematic of the molecular pathways proposed to be aberrant in PH-HFpEF and
  the drugs which have targeted these pathways. Patients with HFpEF have abnormal
  nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability which results in an abnormal NO-sGC-CGMP pathway
  ultimately leading to impaired vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) and myocardial
  relaxation which impairs myocardial relaxation and results in myocardial stiffness.
  Aberrancies in this pathway have been the molecular target of drugs including nitrite,
  vericiguat, riociguat, and sildenafil. The Endothelin-1 pathway has also been implicated
  in HFpEF. Endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, is increased in HFpEF. Via the
  interaction with the Endothelin receptor a (ETAR) and endothelin receptor B (ETBR)
  this results in a vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and vasoconstriction
  which is more profound than the co-occurring ETBR mediated endothelial cell vasodilation.
  Vascular smooth muscle cell and fibroblast ETAR and ETBR are the targets of ambrisentan,
  bosentan, and macitentan.
