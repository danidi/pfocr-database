caption: (A) Representation of typical cells in which K-RAS and its two downstream
  arms are not activated. (B) In most tissues, including pancreatic cancer cells,
  activation of K-RAS results in activation of downstream targets, including the RAF/MAPK
  pathway, which generally drives proliferation, and the tumor-suppressor family of
  RASSF proteins. K-RAS activates both pathways, but the mitogenic balance swings
  in favor of proliferation, as occurs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. (C) In contrast,
  in pancreatic endocrine β cells, K-RAS activation drives both pathways, but the
  mitogenic RAF/MAPK arm is inhibited by the downstream tumor suppressor menin; therefore,
  the proliferation-inhibiting RASSF arm tips the balance in favor of inhibition of
  proliferation. (D) In menin-deficient β cells, the balance swings back in favor
  of proliferation. For a more detailed biochemical schematic, see Figure 5J in Chamberlain
  et al. (). This paradigm appears to apply to other endocrine cells such as pituitary
  and parathyroid cells.
