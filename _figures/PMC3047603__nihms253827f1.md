caption: The growth and development of the normal prostate requires a functioning
  androgen signaling pathway, which is regulated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal/gonadal
  axis. Androgens [testosterone (T), androstenedione (AD), dehydroepiandrosterone
  (DHEA)] and other steroids are synthesized in the testes or adrenal glands and released
  into the circulation in response to specific hormonal signals [follicle stimulating
  hormone (FSH), gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH),
  luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH)]. Testosterone is transported by steroid
  hormone binding globulin (SHBG) to the prostate, where it is predominantly converted
  by 5α-reductase to its more active metabolite, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The
  adrenals are stimulated to produce AD and DHEA by adrenocorticotropic hormone, released
  by the pituitary.
