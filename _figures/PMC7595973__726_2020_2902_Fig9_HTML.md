caption: Proposed decomposition pathway of α-ketoacyl peptides (9) in the absence
  of water leading to carbonyl-free compounds and in the presence of water leading
  to hydrolysis into α-keto acid (11) and C-terminal amino compound (12), which can
  further react with each other forming a Schiff base (13). The latter can cleave
  and decarboxylate forming the Strecker aldehyde (14) of the α-keto acid or hydrolyze
  causing transamination and the formation of amino acid (15) and C-terminal α-keto
  compound (16). R1 and R2 are amino acid side chains, R3 is -OH or amino acid
