caption: Two step cysteine biosynthesis pathway. The first step of cysteine synthesis
  is catalyzed by serine acetyltransferase, produced by the gene cysE. Serine acetyltransferase
  converts serine into O-acetylserine. From this step, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase,
  produced by gene cysK, converts the intermediate into cysteine. O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase
  function can also be provided by the homologous cysM gene. Thus, cysteine production
  in bacteria requires either cysE and cysK or cysE and cysM. In addition, genes similar
  to cysE, cysK, and cysM can be found within certain archaeal genomes.
