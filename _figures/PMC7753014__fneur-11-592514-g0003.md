caption: Antiepileptic mechanism of glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose. As a classical
  glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) would inhibit the energetics of glucose
  and decrease the ATP. Glycolysis reduction will enhance the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) metabolism and resulting in GABAergic strength (). On the other hand, 2-DG
  reduces epilepsy progression by NRSF–dependent metabolic regulation of BDNF and
  TrkB (). Glc, glucose; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; 2-DG-6-P, 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate;
  NRSF, neural restrictive silencing factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  TrkB, tyrosine kinase receptor B; 5α-R, 5α-reductase.
