caption: Proposed Metabolic Map of the Blastocystis Mitochondrion-like OrganellesProteins
  with predicted leader peptides have solid black outlines and protein complexes for
  which leader peptides for only some of the subunits have been predicted have dashed
  black outlines. The blue pathway represents the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
  via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) or pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase
  (PFO). PFO reduces flavodoxin (Fld) and the [FeFe] hydrogenase (HYD) oxidizes flavodoxin
  with the concomitant production of molecular hydrogen; the question mark indicates
  that hydrogen production has not been demonstrated for Blastocystis. Acetyl-CoA
  is converted by the acetate:succinate CoA transferase (ASCT) to acetate (acetate
  production has not been tested for Blastocystis, but we identified an acetyl-CoA
  hydrolase like that known to function as ASCT in Trichomonas hydrogenosomes ). Transporters
  and translocators are shown in yellow. Components of the ETC and the partial TCA
  cycle are orange. Proteins involved in DNA transcription and translation are light
  pink. The mitochondrial part of the urea cycle is green. Pathways for the metabolism
  of the amino acids leucine, valine, and isoleucine are purple. Protein import and
  folding are light green. Pathways of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly are depicted
  in brown. Light blue represents the glycine-cleavage-system pathway. The question
  mark next to propionate shows that propionate production has not been assayed for
  Blastocystis; propionate is a metabolic end product of succinate degradation. For a
  complete list of abbreviations and numbers used in this figure see the .
