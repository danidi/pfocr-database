caption: SRC constitutive activation modulates inflammation and metabolism concurring
  to tumor microenvironment sustainment in GBM. SRC constitutive activation in GBM
  is mainly caused by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) aberrant signaling. SRC hyperactivation
  affects metabolism by inducing the activity of hexokinase (HK), responsible for
  the formation of glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) intermediate, feeding both the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis. Importantly, SRC aberrant activity directly
  induces aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) causing lactate accumulation and its
  secretion in the extracellular matrix. SRC aberrant activity is also responsible
  for the stabilization and activation of transcription factors (i.e., NF-κB, STAT3,
  HIF1α, and AP-1) inducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines,
  growth factors, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Massive production of pro-inflammatory
  molecules and growth factors, glucose deprivation, and lactate accumulation in the
  extracellular matrix concur with the formation of an important tumor microenvironment
  in which tumor and nontumor cells cooperate to sustain each other in a positive
  feedback loop concurring to GBM tumor aggressiveness and invasiveness.
