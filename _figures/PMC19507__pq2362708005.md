caption: The role of the CREM feedback loop in transducing  a rhythmic clock-directed
  signal into rhythmic hormone synthesis.  Schematic representation of the regulatory
  pathway responsible for  generating rhythmic melatonin synthesis. Nighttime adrenergic
  signals  originating from the clock, activate PKA and thus phosphorylate CREB.  During
  the day, dephosphorylation is achieved by phosphatase action.  Thus clock-directed
  signals determine the equilibrium position.  Phosphorylated CREB activates the P2
  promoter of the CREM gene and thus  induces the expression of ICER. ICER down regulates
  its own expression  constituting the CREM feedback loop. The balance between the
  proportion  of phosphorylated CREB (positive effect) and ICER protein levels  (negative
  effect) determines the transcriptional activity of the NAT  promoter. Thus the promoter
  cycles between activated and repressed  states as a function of time. In this way,
  NAT mRNA oscillates between  high nighttime and low basal daytime levels and determines
  the  characteristic day–night oscillation of NAT activity (alternating  black and
  white bars below the activity curve denote night and day,  respectively). The conversion
  of serotonin to  N-acetylserotonin catalyzed by NAT importantly  constitutes the
  rate limiting step of melatonin synthesis. Therefore  this oscillating transcriptional
  control mechanism ensures rhythmic  melatonin synthesis.
