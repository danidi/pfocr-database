caption: An overview of roles of miRNAs as a regulator of DDR in response to radiation
  in cancers. When SSB or DSB occurs, DNA damage repair pathway is initiated. This
  pathway contains a cascade of components including sensors (MRN and PAPR-1), transducers
  (ATM and ATR) and effectors (DNA-PK, RAD51 and BRCA1/2), in order to achieve DNA
  damage repair through NHEJ and HR pathways. Multiple miRNAs play important roles
