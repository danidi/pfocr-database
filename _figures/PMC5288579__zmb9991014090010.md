caption: Model of group I Paks as components of the Ncad/Cdo signaling pathway. Ncad
  ligation triggers assembly of signaling modules for Cdc42 and p38 MAPK on the intracellular
  region of the Ncad coreceptor Cdo. Cdo-dependent activation of Cdc42 activates Pak1
  and Pak2, initiating a MAPK cascade that culminates in activation of p38, which
  in turn promotes muscle-specific gene expression and myogenic differentiation. TAK1
  and ASK1 are the likely MAP3Ks in the pathway (), and MKK3 and MKK6 are promyogenic,
  direct activators of p38 kinases (), although the work in this paper does not demonstrate
  that these kinases are those that reside between group I Paks and p38.

    the intracellular region of the Ncad coreceptor Cdo. Cdo-dependent activation
    of Cdc42 activates Pak1 and Pak2, initiating a MAPK cascade that culminates in

    the work in this paper does not demonstrate that these kinases are those that
    reside between group I Paks and p38.
