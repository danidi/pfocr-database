caption: Over-expression of Lin28b in HNSCC cells inhibits let-7 miRNA family biogenesis.
  In turn, down-regulation of mature Let-7 miRNAs in Lin28b-expressing cells allows
  the over-expression of several Let-7 gene targets with known roles in tumor progression,
  such as HMGA2, and CCND2. Furthermore, down-regulation of Let-7 miRNAs in Lin28b-expressing
  cells also leads to up regulation of several genes in the IGF pathway such as IGF1R,
  and IGF2BP2, which promotes tumor survival under stress conditions.
