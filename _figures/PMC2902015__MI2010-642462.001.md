caption: Nicotinic anti-inflammatory pathways. The inflammatory response to the infection,
  hemorrhage, or tissue trauma is mediated through the pathways of cytokine HMGB1,
  TNF, and interleukins which are released from immunized cells of lymph system including
  spleen tissue. Such immune pathway can be modulated by vagus nerve via its acetylcholine
  transmitter through either muscarinic or nicotinic receptor. A nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor (α7nAChR) agonist, such as nicotine, or transmitter released from vagus
  nerve stimulation, can inhibit the inflammation through restraining the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines from lymphocyte macrophage line. As cholinergic selective,
  nicotine is more efficient than acetylcholine in anti-inflammatory response through
  α7nAChR-dependent mechanism.
