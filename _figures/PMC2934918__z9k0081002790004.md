caption: Model. The finding that LTP priming by mGluR activation occurs in the Fmr1
  KO without a need for acute protein synthesis suggests a bifurcation in the signaling
  pathway. The priming step (1) occurs in response to mGluR activation via a mechanism
  involving posttranslational modification of synaptic proteins (possibly the AMPA
  receptor itself). In WT animals, priming is not possible without (2) concurrent
  mGluR activation of mRNA translation and synthesis of protein(s) that gate plasticity.
  In the absence of the translational repressor FMPP, the gating proteins are constitutively
  overexpressed, rendering priming no longer sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors.
  The identity of the hypothetical gating proteins remains to be determined. AMPA,
  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid.
