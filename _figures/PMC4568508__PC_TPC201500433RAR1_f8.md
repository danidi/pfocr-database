caption: Model for the Control of -Regulated Growth by .1. Upon activation of  signaling,
  BES1 accumulates in its nonphosphorylated form and induces the expression of multiple
  genes encoding enzymes of the  biosynthetic pathway by binding to a non-E-box motif.
  2. As a consequence,  production is increased, which promotes DELLA degradation
  and releases their repressive action on BES1 in the transcription of targets further
  downstream in signaling. Also in this stage,  signaling is required to maintain
  BES1 in its nonphosphorylated, active form. 3. This results in the promotion of
  growth and development and is of relevance throughout the plant life cycle.
