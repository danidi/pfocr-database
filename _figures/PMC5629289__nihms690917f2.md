caption: Type I-IFN/IFNAR2/IFNAR1 ternary complex induces transphosphorylation of
  receptor associated JAK kinases which in turn phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues
  on IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues are docking sites for
  signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) which are then recruited
  to the receptor complex and phosporylated (pSTAT) on specific tyrosine residue.
  pSTAT2 and pSTAT1 heterodimerize to form together with IRF9 the ISGF3 complex which
  translocates into the nucleus and binds to IFN stimulated responsive elements (ISRE)
  in the regulatory region of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)
