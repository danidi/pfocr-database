caption: The hypothetical mechanism of cPLA2α activation in response to inflammatory
  agonists and the generation of ceramide 1-phosphate. The role of C1P in cPLA2α activation
  and eicosanoid synthesis in response to inflammatory agonists begins with the activation
  of CERK by increases in intracellular calcium (light blue) and other possibly other
  unknown mechanisms (e.g. CAMKII phosphorylation) after activation of a receptor
  by an inflammatory agonists (e.g. ATP via the purinergic receptor). CERK utilizes
  ceramide (dark purple) provided by CERT (ceramide transport protein) to produce
  C1P membrane structures (dark green) localized near phosphoinositides (dark blue).
  Simultaneously, cPLA2α is phosphorylated by CAMKII and enzymes of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway in the C terminus leading to a fully active enzyme. cPLA2α
  is then recruited to the trans-Golgi via C1P association with the C1P interaction
  site (light pink) in the CaLB domain, which penetrates the membrane via calcium
  binding subdomains I and III (dark red). Membrane penetration of the catalytic (cat)domain
  follows, which is dramatically enhanced by association with PIPs via the specific
  PIP interaction site (yellow). AA is then produced via the action of this enzyme
  and utilized by cyclooxygenases or lipoxygenases (e.g. COX-2 or 5-LO) beginning
  the eicosanoid biosynthetic pathway.
