caption: JA biosynthesis and degradation pathways are up-regulated simultaneously
  in response to NO2. The schematic pathway of jasmonate metabolism illustrates the
  change in expression levels [log2(FC)] of the respective genes obtained from the
  microarray analysis immediately (0 h, left part of the colored sections) or 6 h
  (right part of the colored sections) after fumigation with 10 µL L−1 NO2. Expression
  levels of all depicted genes can be found in Supplemental Table S1. JAR1, Jasmonate-amido
  synthetase; JMT, JA-carboxyl methyltransferase; MeJA, methyl jasmonate
