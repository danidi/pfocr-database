caption: 'A model for the control of germline proliferation, oocyte growth, and meiotic
  maturation by GLP-1/Notch and MSP signaling. One of the two adult hermaphrodite
  gonad arms is depicted (indicated are: DTC, distal tip cell; TZ, transition zone;
  and proximal oocytes, −1 to −3). p-rMLC is shown in brackets to indicate that MSP
  signaling is sufficient to promote rMLC phosphorylation in the germline, whereas
  the glp-1 pathway appears dispensable.'
