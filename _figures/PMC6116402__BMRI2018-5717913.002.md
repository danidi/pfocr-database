caption: Highly connected networks built using reperfusion-upregulated mRNAs coding
  for proteins known to interact with human proteins. (a) Protein-Protein Interaction
  Network (PPIN) generated using the intersection of mRNAs sets unidirectionally overexpressed
  after reperfusion in Kidney 1 and Kidney 2. (b) PPIN generated using set of mRNAs
  detected to be overexpressed after comparing combined amounts of reads from both
  kidneys before and after reperfusion. Network was generated by Pathway Studio Network
  Building. Each node represents a protein. Network hubs are highlighted in blue (Jun/Fos/ATF
  hub) or green (HSP1A/ HSPA5 hub). In , stars indicate the targets of transcription
  factors overexpressed in reperfusion. In , protein ITGB3 is highlighted in yellow
  as the only entity added to the network as a result of read combining.
