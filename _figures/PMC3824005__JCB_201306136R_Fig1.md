caption: 'Core components of the apoptotic machinery. The likelihood that a neuron
  undergoes apoptosis is determined by the interplay of the tightly interlinked apoptotic
  machinery, many components of which are highly conserved between species. The critical,
  and often terminal, step in programmed cell death is the proteolytic activation
  of the executor caspases (such as caspase 3, 6, 7) by the initiator caspases (i.e.,
  caspase 8, 9, and 10; ). In mammalian cells, initiation of the executor caspases
  is regulated by two distinct protein cascades: the intrinsic pathway, also known
  as the mitochondrial pathway, and the extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway integrates
  a number of intra- and extracellular signal modalities, such as redox state (for
  example, the reactive oxygen species; ), DNA damage (), ER stress () and growth
  factor deprivation (; ; ), or activation of the p75NTR neurotrophin receptor by
  pro-neurotrophins (). The stressors converge onto pro- and anti-apoptotic members
  of the Bcl-2 protein family (for example: BCL-2, BCL-Xl, BAX, and tBID; ). These
  proteins regulate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which activates
  the initiator caspase 9 through Apaf1 (). The extrinsic pathway links activation
  of ligand-bound death receptors (such as Fas/CD95 and TNFR) to the initiator caspase
  8 and 10, through formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC; ; ).
  Together with additional regulatory elements (including the Inhibitors of apoptosis
  proteins [IAP]; ) and cFLIP (; ), the apoptotic machinery forms a balance that determines
  the propensity of the neuron to undergo apoptosis.'
