caption: Model for potential signaling mechanisms mediating enhanced G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR)-induced vasoconstriction of resistance arteries from Eln+/− mice.
  Vasoconstrictor agonists such as ANG II and PE activate GPCRs coupled to Gq/11 and/or
  G12/13 classes of G proteins. Activation of G12/13 can cause vasoconstriction by
  activating a GTP exchange factor (RhoGEF) that, in turn, activates RhoA-Rho kinase
  (RhoK), resulting in smooth muscle contraction. On the other hand, activation of
  Gq/11 triggers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) release by phospholipase C (PLC)-β
  that, in turn, triggers the rise of intracellular Ca2+, leading to smooth muscle
  contraction. Vasoconstriction may also result from activation of the Rho-Rho kinase
  pathway after the activation of Gq/11 via an unknown protein(s). In Eln insufficiency,
  there is decreased endothelium-dependent regulation of Gq/11-evoked intracellular
  Ca2+ transients and uncoupling of Gq/11-RhoA-RhoK pathways, resulting in enhanced
  GPCR-induced vasoconstriction.
