caption: 'Schematic representations of: A) the native MEP pathway (in black) and the
  metabolic engineering strategies adopted in this study for bisabolene production
  (green) and carbon partitioning towards terpenoid biosynthesis (orange and blue);
  and B) the synthetic devices designed and built in this study. Abbreviations: G3P
  - glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DXP - 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate; MEP - 2-C-methylerythritol
  4-phosphate; IPP - isopentenylpyrophosphate; DMAPP - dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate;
  GPP - geranyl-pyrophosphate; FPP - farnesyl-pyrophosphate; GGPP - geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate;
  DXS - native DXP synthase; CfDXS - DXP synthase, from Coleus forskohlii; sIDI -
  IPP/DMAPP isomerase, from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803; EcIspA - FPP synthase, from
  Escherichia coli; AgB - bisabolene synthase, from Abies grandies; CrtE - native
  polyprenyl synthase). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
