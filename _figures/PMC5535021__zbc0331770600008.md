caption: A model of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of BR-C involved in the 20E pathway.
  As an early response gene of 20E in the silkworm, BR-C is transcriptionally triggered
  by the presence of 20E. The subsequently translated BR-C protein initiates the transcription
  of the downstream genes that are involved in metamorphosis as long as Ser-186 remains
  unphosphorylated. Activated PKA promotes BR-C phosphorylation at Ser-186, which
  in turn blocks the transcriptional activity of BR-C. Continued 20E signaling during
  insect development inhibits cAMP/PKA signaling, which may contribute to the maintenance
  of BR-C transcriptional activity.
