caption: 'Terpene and terpenoids biosynthesis. The precursors for biosynthesis of
  terpenes and terpenoids (isopentyl-pyroP, IPP and dimethylallyl-piroP, DMAPP) are
  synthetized by two biosynthetic pathways: The mevalonate pathway (MVA, in red) and
  the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP, in green). As shown in the the square
  with blue dotted line, MVA was found in eukaryotes and archaea, while MEP was found
  in bacteria or in eukaryotes equipped with plastid. Horizontal gene exchange has
  allowed the acquisition of MVA (for the bacteria) or MEP genes (for the eukaryotes).
  GPS (geranyl-pyroP synthase), FPS (farnesyl-pyroP synthase) and GGPS (geranylgeranyl-pyroP
  synthase) assemble IPP and DMAPP into linear long-chain precursors used by the biosynthetic
  enzymes to produce the terpenes-like ring. In the figure, the examples are reported
  (from precursor to ring cyclization), including monoterpene synthases, diterpene
  synthases, and sesquiterpene synthases. Abbreviations: MVA: AACT = acetoacetyl-CoA
  thiolase, HMGS = 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- CoA synthase, HMGR = 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-
  CoA reductase, MVK = mevalonate kinase, PMK = phosphomevalonate kinase, MDC = mevalonate-
  5-decarboxylase. Abbreviation of MEP: DXS = 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase,
  DXP = deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate, DXR = 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-reductase; MEP =
  methyl-erythritol phosphate, CMS = MEP cytidylyltransferase, CDP-MEP = cytidylyl-MEP,
  MCS = ME-cPP synthase, ME-cPP = methyl-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (ME-cPP),
  HDS = hydroxymethylbutenyl 4-diphosphate synthase, HMBPP = hydroxymethylbutenyl
  4-diphosphate, IDS = IPP/DMAPP synthase, IDI1/IDI2 = IPP-DAMPP isomerase.'
