caption: Schematic representation of the hypothetical model of the copper stress signaling
  pathway in the development and metabolism in G. lucidum. A model of the events that
  occur in hyphal cells. The intracellular copper content increases rapidly under
  copper stress. Intracellular copper promotes the production of ROS and leads to
  a burst of ROS that is required for G. lucidum hyphal branching and secondary metabolism.
  The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is also increased in response to the accumulation
  of ROS. In addition, the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activates antioxidases
  to reduce the ROS content and intracellular copper accumulation. The black solid
  arrows indicate data supported by our own experiments, and the dotted arrows indicate
  hypothetical steps.
