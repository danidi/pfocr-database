caption: Role of Rap1 in EC barrier restoration after thrombin. In parallel with rapid
  activation of the Rho pathway leading to increased EC permeability, thrombin causes
  activation of Src kinase, which stimulates the Rap1-specific GEF C3G and, via Rap1-Tiam1,
  turns on the Rac1 signaling. Activation of Rap1-Rac1 signaling axis down-regulates
  the Rho pathway of barrier disruption and promotes reassembly of AJ complexes and
  endothelial monolayer barrier restoration.
