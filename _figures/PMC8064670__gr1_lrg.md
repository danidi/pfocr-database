caption: GM-CSF signaling pathways. To activate downstream signalling, multiple events
  occur as depicted (1-4) in this ) GM-CSF binds to the α subunit of the GM-CSFR.
  2) Dimerization of the two subunits upon GM-CSF binding. 3) Formation of the GM-CSFR
  hexameric complex followed by the lateral association of two hexameric complexes.
  4) Several signalling pathways could result from GM-CSFR activation; JAK2 binds
  the β cytoplasmic tails and transphosphorylate each other, which activates the PI3K,
  MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways, as well as the NFκB pathway. Activated NFκB dimers
  translocate into the nucleus and result in the transcription of genes for the differentiation
  and survival of myeloid cells such as RelB and IRF4. The JAK/STAT pathway induces
  the phosphorylation of STAT5, eventually causing STAT5 dimerization and translocation
  to the nucleus for transcriptional regulation of genes for the differentiation,
  proliferation, and survival of myeloid cells including c-fos, RelB, IRF4, pim-1,
  cis, and osm. The MAPK pathway also results in the differentiation and survival
  of myeloid cells via ERK kinase activation, through the transcription of genes such
  as c-fos. Finally, PI3K is phosphorylated by JAK2 resulting in signal transduction
  through a PIP3 intermediate, causing membrane recruitment of PKB followed by its
  phosphorylation by mTORC2 and PDK1, eventually leading to the proliferation and
  survival of myeloid cells.
