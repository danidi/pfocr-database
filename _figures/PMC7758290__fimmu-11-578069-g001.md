caption: 'The complement system. Three pathways can lead to complement activation:
  the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP) and the alternative pathway
  (AP). Activation of the CP (left) starts with binding of C1q to target cells, often
  via antibodies. Binding of C1q leads to cleavage of C1r, which in turn cleaves C1s.
  The proteolytic activity of C1s results in the cleavage of C2 and C4. These components
  form the C3 convertase of the CP, C4bC2a. Activation of the LP (middle) starts with
  the binding of MBL or ficolins to carbohydrate structures on target cell surfaces.
  As a result, the proteases of the LP, MASPs, cleave C2 and C4, also leading to the
  formation of C4bC2a. The AP pathway (right) is activated by spontaneous hydrolysis
  of C3, which leads to the formation of C3(H2O), or by C3b from the CP or LP. After
  assembly of C3b, FB binds to C3b or C3(H2O) and is cleaved by protease FD. This
  results in the formation of the C3 convertases of the AP, C3bBb or C3(H2O)Bb. C3
  convertases of the CP/LP and the AP cleave C3 into C3b and C3a. Usage of C3b in
  the AP causes an amplification loop, which can amplify the CP and LP. In addition,
  C3b deposition leads to formation of two C5 convertases: C4b2aC3b (CP/LP) or C3b2Bb
  (AP). C5 convertases cleave C5 in C5a and C5b. C5b is used for the formation of
  the MAC which is formed after assembly of C6, C7, C8 and multiple C9 molecules (C9x).
  The MAC is inserted into the membrane to induce lysis. C3a and C5a (depicted in
  red) are anaphylatoxins important for chemotaxis and the initiation of inflammation.
  Complement components are depicted in bold, scissors indicate cleavage. Complement
  regulators can be divided in two groups: soluble (depicted in blue) and membrane-bound
  (depicted in green). These regulators prevent complement activation by targeting
  the complement pathway in different places, as depicted here. The inactivating breakdown
  pathways of C3b and C4b respectively by complement regulators are indicated here
  with a dotted arrow, showing the different breakdown products.'
