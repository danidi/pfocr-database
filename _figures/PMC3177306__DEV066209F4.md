caption: 'Models for how Wnt signaling maintains pluripotency in ES cells. (A) In
  the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin (βcat) is degraded, and TCF3 in complex
  with transcriptional co-repressors (CoR) constitutively represses Wnt target genes.
  (B-E) Upon Wnt pathway activation, several alternative models leading to pluripotency
  are possible: (B) stabilized β-catenin associates with OCT4 to activate OCT4-dependent
  transcription; (C) HIPK2 is activated by Wnt signaling, associates with β-catenin
  and phosphorylates TCF3; this phosphorylation results in the removal of TCF3 from
  target promoters, leading to transcriptional derepression; (D) stabilized β-catenin
  associates with TCF3, causing the removal of the co-repressors resulting in target
  derepression (this model predicts that TCF3 is still bound to the promoter but no
  longer represses its gene targets); and (E) the TCF switch model, in which TCF3
  repressor is replaced by TCF1 activator, leading to target activation and pluripotency.
