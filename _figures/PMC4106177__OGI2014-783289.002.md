caption: Elements of mechanical signaling. A simplified pathway of mechanical signaling
  in cells is depicted. As the cell cytoskeleton contracts (a process called cell
  contractility) and ECM accumulates in the cell microenvironment, integrin activation
  occurs leading to activation of Rho (as discussed in []). Rho in turn activates
  ROCK leading to activation of ras. In fibroid cells obtained either at the time
  of hysterectomy or myomectomy, RhoA activity is attenuated. This adaptation of the
  fibroid cell is not ROCK dependent (as discussed in []). These findings suggest
  that fibroid cells in symptomatic tumors where treatment was needed are fundamentally
  adapted to their stiff microenvironment and thus become insensitive to moderate
  mechanical cues. It is not certain when in the natural history of fibroid development
  that this adaptive response to mechanotransduction occurs. Nevertheless, mechanical
  sensing does occur in fibroid cells.
