caption: A- The knowledge acquired on canonical Notch signaling offers several targets
  to modulate the pathway. The generation of Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) could
  be restricted by targeting the processing of Notch after cleavage by Furin (S1),
  metalloproteases (S2) and/or γ-secretase complex (S3). Modulation of Notch signaling
  can also be achieved by affecting the interaction of with the transcriptional complex
  (MAML/CSL). These approaches have caveats and OFF-targets effects. Disruption of
  Notch signaling can be accomplished by perturbation of Ligand/Receptor interactions.
  B- Blockade of Notch signaling by ligand-specific Notch decoy peptides. N1–13 specifically
  inhibits DLL binding to Notch leading to hyper-sprouting angiogenesis secondary
  to VEGFR-2 overexpression. In contrast, N10–24 binds and blocks JAG-mediated Notch
  signaling resulting in overexpression of VEGFR-2 together with soluble VEGFR-1 (sVEGFR1)
  that competes with VEGFR-2. As a result, endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis
  are blocked. In addition, specific blockade of JAG-mediated Notch signaling affects
  pericyte coverage and subsequent vascular integrity. Finally, N1–24 a pan-Notch
  inhibitor, have dominant ligand-effect depending on context. The use of either of
  the decoy Notch peptides blocks functional angiogenesis and decreases tumor growth.
