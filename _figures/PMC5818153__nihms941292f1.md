caption: Ceramide is the central molecule in sphingolipid metabolism and can be synthesized
  de novo (dark blue boxes) by the functions of serine palmitoyl-transferase (SPT),
  3-ketosphinganine reductase, (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CERS1–6) and dihydroceramide
  desaturase (DES). Ceramide can also be generated by the hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids
  such as sphingomyelin (SM) by the action of sphingomyelinases (SMases) (purple box).
  Conversion of sphingosine to ceramide is catalysed by the salvage pathway (red boxes)
  via CERS1–6, the same enzymes involved in de novo ceramide synthesis. Ceramide is
  metabolized to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by the functions of ceramidases
  (CDases) and sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) and SPHK2. S1P is further hydrolysed by
  S1P lyase to exit the sphingolipid metabolic cycle. The metabolism of ceramide to
  generate complex sphingolipids such as glycosphingolipids or gangliosides requires
  the synthesis of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) by glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) (green
  box), which is a precursor for the synthesis of complex sphingolipids (dotted arrows).
  Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) enzymes convert ceramide to SM via insertion of a choline
  moiety into ceramide as a head group using phosphatidylcholine (PC) as a donor,
  yielding free diacylglycerol (DAG), and ceramide kinase (CERK) converts ceramide
  to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) (orange boxes). Ceramide is hydrolysed by CDases,
  including acid ceramidase (AC), to release free fatty acids and sphingosine. Ceramide
  can be synthesized by the hydrolysis of SM by SMases, including acid sphingomyelinase
  (ASMase; encoded by SMPD1). Mutations in enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism
  have been associated with various lysosomal storage disorders (grey boxes), including
  Farber, Gaucher, Niemann–Pick and Krabbe diseases. Patients with Gaucher disease
  have increased susceptibility to the development of cancer, such as myeloma. Mutations
  in the genes encoding SPT subunits, such as SPTLC1, are associated with hereditary
  sensory neuropathy type I (REF. ). GCDase, galactosylceramidase; GlcCDase, glucosylceramidase;
  SGPP, S1P phosphatase.
