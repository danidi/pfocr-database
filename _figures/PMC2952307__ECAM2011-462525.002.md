caption: Significantly altered genes by PEITC from the current study are presented
  in yellow boxes, and the effects of PEITC that have already been reported in previous
  studies are presented in blue boxes. All genes (ATF-2, p53, Hsp27, p57, BRCA2, IL-2)
  were upregulated. ATF-2, p53, Hsp27 are transcription factors which are all located
  downstream of MAPK signaling pathway (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Induction
  of ATF-2, p53 and Hsp27 in response to various stresses correlates with increased
  resistance to subsequent cellular damage []. Transcriptional activation of the p53
  target genes plays a critical role in the cellular response to DNA damage, cellular
  stress and other signals regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis [, ]. IL-2 induces
  G2 cell cycle arrest via Akt pathway []. BRCA2 is essential for the maintenance
  of genetic stability through a function in DNA repair [].
