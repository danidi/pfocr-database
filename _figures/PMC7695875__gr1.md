caption: Nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (Keap1) signalling pathway and its downstream target effects. Under normal conditions,
  transcription factor Nrf2 is sequestered and degraded in the cytoplasm by its repressor
  Keap1 and proteosomal degradation, respectively. Activation of Nrf2 in response
  to stress signals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) results in partial or complete
  dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1. This allows dissociated or newly synthesised Nrf2
  and its stabilizer protein DJ-1 to bypass Keap1, which is sequestered by p62, and
  translocate into the nucleus. Upon nuclear translocation, Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant
  response element (ARE) modulating the expression of an array of defensive genes
  including those that encode Phase II detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase
  (SOD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1),
  catalase (CAT) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). This constitutes the endogenous antioxidant
  response. The activation of Nrf2 leads to broad downstream effects aside from detoxification
  and cellular defence against potentially harmful ROS, including calcium handling,
  mitohormesis (including biogenesis, maintenance and function), anti-inflammation
  (including suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines), stem cell regeneration (i.e.
  satellite cell proliferation) and protein protection and homeostasis (namely, autophagy
  and heat shock protein expression). Nrf2 can amplify its own activation pathway
  by increasing p62 expression, which targets Keap1 and promotes degradation of the
  p62-Keap1 aggregate through autophagy. Created with BioRender.com
