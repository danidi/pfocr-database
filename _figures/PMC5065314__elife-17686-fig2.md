caption: '(A) GABA synthesis, secretion, uptake and degradation pathway. (B) unc-25
  reporter transgene schematics and the unc-25 locus with the knock-in allele ot867[unc-25::SL2::gfp]
  which is targeted to the nucleus to facilitate the detection and the identification
  of expressing cells. (C) Fosmid-based reporter transgenes for unc-46, unc-47, snf-11
  and gta-1. Note that the reporters are targeted to the nucleus to facilitate the
  identification of expressing cells. (D) Reporter expression. Images are color-inverted.
  The last panel shows a summary of all reporter expressing neurons. Font color indicates
  the known neurotransmitter used by the neuron, the colored circle which gene is
  expressed in the neuron and the grey shade if the neuron is GABA stained. (Scale
  bar = 10 μm) (E) Summary of all GABA-positive cells in the head of the worm (left
  view). Color coding same as in . Pharyngeal neurons are not shown. In the remainder
  of the body of the hermaphrodite, only the D-type motor neurons (some shown here)
  and the DVB tail neuron are GABA-positive. Dashed circle indicates neurons that present
  only on the right side of the animals, but shown here on the left side.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17686.004'
