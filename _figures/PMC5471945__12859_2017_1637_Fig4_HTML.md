caption: Sphingolipid metabolism pathway in Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease is caused
  by a deficiency in the glucocerebrosidase enzyme. Miglustat inhibits the ceramide
  glucosyltransferase enzyme to reduce the glucocerebroside which accumulates in Gaucher
  disease. Glc, glucose; Gal, galactose
