caption: 'TLR and NLR signaling. DAMPs released from necrotic and damaged cells and
  extracellular matrix bind to the TLRs, which are comprised of an extracellular leucine
  rich repeat (LRR) domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic
  Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain, which serves as docking site for other TIR-containing cytoplasmic
  adaptor proteins (top left box). The binding of DAMPs, and often co-receptors such
  as CD14 and MD2, to TLR4 engages the adaptor MyD88 via the adaptor TIRAP. MyD88
  recruits IRAK4 and the IRAK1/2 and TRAF6 complex, which activates TAK1. TAK1, a
  MAPKKK, then activates the MAPK cascade and also phosphorylates IκB kinase (IKK),
  that leads to NF-κB p65 and p50 nuclear translocation and the transcription of a
  panel of inflammatory genes, including cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules,
  and complement factor B. Further, after endocytosis, TLR4 signals in a MyD88-independent
  manner via the cytoplasmic adaptor TRIF, in turn recruited through the bridging
  adaptor TRAM. This pathway results in non-canonical IKK and NF-κB activation, as
  well as the induction of type I IFN via TBK1 and the transcription factor IRF3.
  Except for TLR3, the other TLRs also signal, directly or indirectly as depicted,
  via MyD88. Endolysosomal TLR3 activates IRF3 signaling via TRIF and TBK1, whereas
  endolysosomal TLR7/8 and TLR9 also induce type I IFN via TRAF3 and IRF7 in a MyD88-dependent
  manner (not pictured). In addition to TLRs, intracellular NLRs respond to a variety
  of PAMPs via the formation of multiprotein inflammasomes, comprised of an activated
  NLR protein, the adaptor protein ASC, and procaspase-1. One proposed model of NLRP3
  inflammasome activation results from stimulation of the P2X7 ion channel by extracellular
  ATP, resulting in K+ efflux, recruitment of the pannexin-1 pore, DAMP entry into
  cytosol, and activation of NLRP3. This activates caspase-1, which then converts
  pro-IL18 and pro-IL1β to active IL-18 and IL-1β. As discussed in the text, cell
  type-specific innate immune signaling can result in distinctive, and sometimes divergent,
  in vivo physiological responses during acute MI. Schema adapted from references
  13, 14, 18, 76, and 83. (Illustration credit: Ben Smith).'
