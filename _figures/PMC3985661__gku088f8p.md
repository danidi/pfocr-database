caption: Schematic representation of PARP1–TDP1 coupling for the repair of Top1–DNA
  covalent complexes. (1) The C-terminus domain of PARP1 binds the N-terminus regulatory
  domain of TDP1 (double-headed arrow). The PARP1–TDP1 molecular complex is shown
  as a black node. (2) PARP coupling with TDP1 stimulates (open arrow) the excision
  of Top1-DNA covalent complexes by the phosphodiesterase activity of TDP1 (jigsaw
  line) (3). The parallel pathway for Top1–DNA complex removal involves various endonucleases
  (4) including XPF-ERCC1, CtIP and Mre11. Graphical symbols for molecular interactions
  are derived from Kohn’s MIM conventions ().
