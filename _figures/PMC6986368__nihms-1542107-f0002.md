caption: Glucose from systemic circulation (green spheres) can be converted to glucose-6-phosphate
  and fructose-6-phosphate through the enzymes hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase, respectively. Fructose-6-phosphate can then enter the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway or continue in glycolysis. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway provides
  precursors for O-GlcNAcylation, which forms the metabolic intersection between T2D
  (blue circle) and cancer (yellow circle). Increased O-GlcNAcylation in T2D can lead
  to insulin resistance; increased O-GlcNAcylation in cancer can lead to the de novo
  induction of oncogenic mutations, namely KRAS. Metabolites are shown in black. Enzymes
  are shown in light blue. Metformin, shown in pink, is a pharmacological inhibitor
  used in T2D and is currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy due to its inhibition
  of mitochondrial complex 1, glycolysis, and glycogenesis.
