caption: Model for A2BP1 function in the Notch pathway. In the absence of Notch signaling,
  Su(H), Gro, CtBP and H form a repressor complex and transcriptionally downregulate
  the targets of N, such as the E(spl)-C genes. In the presence of activated N (NICD),
  this repressor complex is dissociated and the Su(H)-N complex activates target genes.
  Our results suggest that A2BP1 acts as a positive regulator of Notch signaling.
  It is part of the Su(H)-N complex and activates E(spl)-C. Our biochemical analysis
  indicates that, irrespective of Notch signaling, A2BP1 is complexed with Su(H).
  Interestingly, however, A2BP1 is not part of the repressor complex as it is not
  detected with either CtBP or Gro. Thus, the fraction of Su(H) complexed with A2BP1
  is likely to be different from that which participates in the repressor complex.
  This indicates that A2BP1 might be involved in setting aside a small fraction of
  Su(H) to potentiate lateral inhibition. In the presence of NICD, increased levels
  of Su(H) would be available upon dissociation from the repressor complex to strengthen
  the process further.
