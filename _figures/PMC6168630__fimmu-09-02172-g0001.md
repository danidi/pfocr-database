caption: Schematic representation of PI3Kδ activation in B- and T-cells during class-switch
  recombination. In B cells, PI3Kδ is activated mainly after the BCR (B-cell receptor)
  cross-linking or upon cytokine stimulation, as with IL-4. CD19 is a co-receptor
  for the BCR which also p85α can bind. Similar to the T cell, PI3K can signal through
  Akt to phosphorylate and remove FOXO1 from the nucleus, thus inactivating it. FOXO1
  acts as a transcription factor to activate RAG genes, IKAROS, CD62L, and AICDA (critical
  in CSR and SHM). PI3Kδ signals through mTOR to promote B-cell activation (not shown;
  reviewed in ()). In T cells, PI3Kδ is mainly activated upon TCR (T-cell receptor),
  ICOS and IL-2R stimulation. Akt causes FOXO1 to leave the nucleus and helps with
  PI3Kδ dependent downregulation of IL-7Rα and CD62L. These changes in turn allow
  the T cell to exit the lymph node and enter circulation. PI3Kδ via mTOR promotes
  T-cell activation and T-cell effector phenotypes (not shown). In both B and T cells,
  PTEN and SHIP act as negative regulators of PI3K (reviewed in ()). Interaction of
  T cells and B cells in germinal centers through CD40-ligand (CD40L)/CD40 joining
  is required for class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM),
  two events necessary for antibody maturation. Activated CD4+ T cells in the lymph
  nodes interact with CD40 on B cells, inducing cytokine specific B-cell receptors
  (IL-R). Signaling through CD40 activates the NF-kB signaling pathway, which ultimately
  leads to expression of AID and UNG. Mutations affecting components of CD40 mediated
  B-cell activation can also result in CSR/HIGM syndromes. CD40 has also been associated
  with PI3K activation. Blue represents signaling elements associated with B cells.
  Green represents signaling elements associated with T cells. Yellow represents signaling
  elements that are present in both B- and T- cells. Red arrows point to genes/proteins
  that when mutated are associated with CSR/HIGM syndromes. Other genes/proteins (e.g.,
  ATM, PMS2, MSH2, and NFKBIA, not included in this figure) can also be associated
  with CSR/HIGM defects when mutated. BLNK, B-cell linker protein; BTK, Bruton tyrosine
