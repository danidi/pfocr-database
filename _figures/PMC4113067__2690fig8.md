caption: Development of hepatic and secondary systemic insulin resistance in DIO.
  In response to dietary excess, availability of lipids that directly activate aPKC,
  e.g., ceramide and phosphatidic acid, increases. Subsequent activation of hepatic
  aPKC increases binding of aPKC to ProF, a scaffolding protein that couples Akt and
  FoxO1, and this leads to impaired ability of Akt2 to phosphorylate FoxO1 on Ser256;
  as a result, expression of PEPCK and G6Pase and hepatic glucose output increase.
  Ensuing increases in blood glucose levels stimulate insulin secretion, and both
  glucose and insulin, as well as fatty acids, increase phosphatidic acid production
  via the de novo pathway. Increased insulin secretion activates hepatic Akt2, as
  well as aPKC, which together increase hepatic lipid production, thereby providing
  more substrates for phosphatidic acid and ceramide synthesis. In short, a vicious
  cycle is set up for lipid production and aPKC activation. This cycle is abetted
  in human (but not rodent) liver by virtue of the fact that increased aPKC activity
  provokes increases in levels of PKC-ι mRNA and protein (). As a by-product of increases
  in circulating levels of liver-derived lipids and cytokines, insulin signaling in
  muscle and certain other tissues (e.g., adipose tissue [data not shown]) is impaired,
  adding further to diminished glucose disposal and systemic insulin resistance.
