caption: Intracellular trafficking path for SORLA. Nascent SORLA is an inactive pro-receptor
  (pro-SORLA) that is activated by proteolytic removal of an amino-terminal pro-peptide
  in the TGN, resulting in transfer of the active receptor (SORLA) through the constitutive
  secretory pathway to the cell surface. Some receptor molecules at the cell surface
  are subjected to ectodomain shedding, resulting in release of the extracellular
  receptor domain. Ectodomain shedding disrupts the ability of SORLA to act as a sorting
  receptor, but may serve to produce a soluble receptor fragment termed soluble (s)SORLA
  that acts as a signaling molecule. Still, most SORLA molecules at the cell surface
  remain intact and undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis facilitated by the clathrin
  adaptor protein (AP) 2. The bulk of internalized receptors move from endosomes back
  to the TGN to continuously shuttle between TGN and endosomal compartments thereafter.
  Adaptors GGA1 and GGA2 guide anterograde movement of SORLA from the TGN to endosomes,
  whereas PACS1 and the retromer complex facilitate retrograde sorting from endosomes
  back to the Golgi. AP1 may be involved in bi-directional sorting. As alternative
  routes, SORLA may sort from endosomes to the cell surface (aided by adaptor SNX27)
  or to lysosomes (aided by GGA3). Figure adapted from []. AP, adaptor protein; GGA,
  Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear homology domain, ARF-interacting protein; PACS1,
