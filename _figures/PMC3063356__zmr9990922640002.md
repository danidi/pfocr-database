caption: Sources of energy and building blocks in oxidatively stressed D. radiodurans.
  (A) Extracellular proteolysis. D. radiodurans contains many secreted proteases and
  ABC transporters, which provide exogenous amino acids as protein building blocks
  and peptides as components of manganese complexes. (B) The pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) for the conversion of glucose into dNTPs. Glucose is essential for recovery
  from oxidative stress; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (the marker enzyme of PPP)
  converts glucose into the precursors of dNTPs as DNA building blocks and, possibly,
  components of Mn complexes. (C) Carbohydrate and polyphosphate granules. Shown is
  a schematic representation of a D. radiodurans tetrad viewed by electron microscopy
  (based on data from reference  and unpublished data from J. R. Battista). The small
  light granules contain carbohydrates, while the large dark circles represent polyphosphate
  granules. Both can be used as sources of energy, while polyphosphates also serve
  as a phosphate source for the synthesis of nucleic acids and, presumably, for manganese-phosphate
  complexes.
