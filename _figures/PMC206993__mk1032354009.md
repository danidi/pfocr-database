caption: Schematic of SPARC-mediated regulation of and coupling to the TGF-β signaling
  system. Inset, long-term TGF-β treatment of Mv1Lu cells stimulates their synthesis
  of SPARC transcript and protein. Conversely, long-term SPARC treatment induces Mv1Lu
  cells to produce and secrete TGF-β1, presumably leading to enhanced autocrine TGF-β
  signaling. Dysregulation of this regulatory loop may exacerbate the development
  and progression of diseases characterized by alterations in tissue remodeling and
  repair, including cancer. Newly synthesized SPARC is also endowed with the potential
  to regulate short-term TGF-β signaling. Although it is unknown whether SPARC acts
  directly on TGF-β (i.e., activation of latent TGF-β complexes; dashed arrow) or
  its receptors (dashed arrow), these molecules are in fact necessary and required
  for SPARC to stimulate the TGF-β signaling system. Activation of TGF-β receptors
  by SPARC stimulates TGF-β–regulated Smads, which translocate into the nucleus to
  induce or repress TGF-β–responsive genes, ultimately leading to epithelial cell
  growth arrest. The ability of SPARC to couple to TGF-β signaling is mediated via
  its EC domain. Alternatively, cells resistant to TGF-β (i.e., loss of TGF-β receptors
  or Smad inactivation) remain competent to partial growth arrest by SPARC, a response
  that is not recapitulated by SPARC-EC. Activation of this unknown pathway likely
  inhibits the expression and activities of cell cycle components (e.g., cyclin A,
  Rb-like p107, CDK2, and Rb). Although the contribution of TGF-β signaling to regulation
  of this unknown SPARC pathway remains to be defined (dashed arrow), both systems
  cooperate to maximally inhibit epithelial cell proliferation by SPARC.
