caption: A model summarizing the signaling functions of Cl−. Intracellular Cl− concentration
  tightly controls by Cl− influx and efflux transporters that keep [Cl−]in above electrochemical
  potential. Cell stimulation often rapidly reduces [Cl−]in or causes [Cl−]in oscillations.
  The changes in [Cl−]in are translated to cellular responses by direct binding of
  Cl− to a variety of proteins and changes in their activity. The best understood
  form of signaling by [Cl−]in is regulation of protein kinases and phosphatases.
  However, regulation of several transporters by binding of Cl− to them, including
  transporters that do not transport Cl−, is well documented. By regulation of K+
  channels, [Cl−]in indirectly affects the membrane potential, in addition to its
  direct effect on the membrane potential as a conductive ion. [Cl−]in also has long-term
  effects by binding and activating transcription factors to regulate gene expression.
  Although [Cl−]in binding to the various proteins and regulation of their activity
  are well documented, the [Cl−]in binding sites are not always known, and the physiological
  roles of signaling by [Cl−]in in animal studies is mostly not documented. The exception
  is the role of [Cl−]in in the WNK/SPAK pathway. Regulation of enzymes, ion channels
  and transporters, and signaling by G protein-coupled receptors by [Cl−]out is also
  well documented. However, this is the least understood form of signaling by Cl−,
  and its physiological role is rarely documented or understood.
