caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed Npc1 gene-diet metabolic pathway
  that promotes weight gain. A: dietary saturated fatty acids have been reported to
  increase expression of the Pgc1a and Pgc1b genes and the amounts of encoded PGC-1α
  and PGC1-β proteins. B: the PGC-1α and PGC1-β proteins serve as transcriptional
  coactivators for the nuclear receptor LXR (activated in the presence of oxysterol)
  that forms a heterodimer with RXR (activated in the presence of retinoic acid) to
  increase expression of the Srebp1 gene and the amounts of encoded precursor SREBP-1
  protein. C: decreased Npc1 gene dosage and decreased amounts of encoded NPC1 protein
  has been reported to impair feedback inhibition of the SREBP pathway characterized
  by an increased amount of mature SREBP-1 protein that serves as a transcription
  factor. D: the increased amounts of PGC-1β protein (but not PGC-1α protein) have
  also been reported to serve as a transcriptional coactivator for the increased amounts
  of mature SREBP-1 protein to increase expression of target genes encoding proteins
  that regulate increased glycolysis and lipogenesis but also decreased expression
  of the Ppara gene and the amounts of encoded PPARα protein. E: the PGC-1α protein
  (but not PGC-1β protein) serves as a transcriptional coactivator for the decreased
  amounts of PPARα protein that forms a heterodimer with RXR and decreases expression
  of target genes. F: these PPARα target genes encode proteins that regulate triacylglycerol
  lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation. Therefore, the proposed Npc1 gene-diet interaction
  metabolic pathway promotes weight gain through increased glycolysis and lipogenesis
  in addition to decreased triacylglycerol lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation. PGC-1α,
