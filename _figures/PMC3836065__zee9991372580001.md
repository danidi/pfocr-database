caption: Glucose metabolism and generation of NADPH in the cumulus cell and oocyte.
  The pentose phosphate pathway metabolizes glucose to produce ribose-5-phosphate
  for DNA synthesis and NADPH for reduction, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol
  and steroid hormone production. When the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate
  pathway, G6PDH, is inhibited by DHEA, a greater amount of glucose is shunted to
  glycolysis, leading to ATP and citrate production. Citrate is converted in the TCA
  cycle to malate to produce NADPH to support lipid synthesis in hormone-dependent
  tissues such as the oocyte. G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
