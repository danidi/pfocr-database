caption: 'Schematic diagram depicting the proposed role of bone morphogenetic protein
  (BMP) signaling pathway, HJV, HFE, and TFR2 in iron sensing and hepcidin regulation
  in the liver. In response to iron, bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) binds to
  the BMP co-receptor hemojuvelin (HJV) as part of the BMP6/HJV/BMPR complex on the
  hepatocyte membrane to activate the SMAD1/5/8 pathway. Activated SMAD complexes
  bind directly to BMP responsive elements (BMP-REs) on the hepcidin promoter to induce
  hepcidin transcription. Holotransferrin (TF-Fe) competes for HFE binding to transferrin
  receptor 1 (TFR1), causing HFE displacement to form a complex with TFR2 and TF-Fe
  to induce hepcidin expression, possibly through an interaction with the BMP6-HJV-SMAD
  signaling pathway and/or alternative signaling pathways such as the ERK1/2 pathway.
  In the setting of iron deficiency, the serine protease TMPRSS6 inhibits hepcidin
  expression by cleaving membrane-bound HJV to form soluble HJV, thereby inhibiting
  downstream SMAD signaling by loss of membrane-bound HJV and sequestration of BMP6
  ligand. Abbreviations: BMPR, BMP receptor, TF, transferrin.'
