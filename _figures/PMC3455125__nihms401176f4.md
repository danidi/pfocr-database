caption: Schematic respresentation of anterograde and retrograde trafficking pathways
  for KCa2.x (left) and KCa3.1 (right) channels. The important motifs and regulatory
  proteins in channel assembly are illustrated. The molecular determinants of the
  forward trafficking of KCa channels are not fully determined at this time. Once
  at the plasma membrane, KCa2.x channels reside in caveolae. KCa2.3 is endocytosed
  in a dynamin and Rab5-dependent manner, after which KCa2.3 enters a recycling endosome
  (RE) compartment and is returned to the plasma membrane in a Rab35/EPI64C/RME-1
  dependent manner. In contrast, KCa3.1 undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis and
  is rapidly targeted for lysosomal degradation via an ESCRT- and Rab7- dependent
  pathway. Ubiquitylation (Ub) mediates the targeting of membrane KCa3.1 to the lysosomes
  and USP8 regulates the rate of KCa3.1 degradation by deubiquitylating KCa3.1 prior
  to lysosomal delivery. CAM=calmodulin; MVB=multivesicular bodies. See text for additional
  details.
