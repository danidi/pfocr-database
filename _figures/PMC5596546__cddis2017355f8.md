caption: 'Hypertonicity boosts cytotoxicity of SMAC mimetics. Left side: SM trigger
  degradation of cIAP and thereby abolishes ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal
  degradation of NIK. Increase in NIK levels results in non-canonical activation of
  the NFκB pathway and transcription of target genes such as TNF. In the absence of
  cIAP1/2, autocrine TNF secretion induces cell death via TNFR1. Right side: Under
  hypertonic conditions, SM also deplete cIAP1/2 and enable non-canonical NFκB activation,
  TNF release and TNFR1-induced cell death. Additionally, establishing an osmotic
  pressure gradient activates NFAT5, a vitally important transcription factor for
  a cell’s adaptive response to hyperosmotic stress. NFAT5 also triggers TNF transcription,
  which may restore SM cytotoxicity in cancer cells lacking autocrine SM-induced TNF
  production. RSC, receptor signaling complex'
