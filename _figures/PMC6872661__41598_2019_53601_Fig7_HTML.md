caption: A model depicting the role of TFG mediates progression of CCA through the
  EGF/EGFR axis. TFG favors EGF-EGFR activation which stimulates its downstream signals
  by increasing the phosphorylation of Akt and Erk, and consequently enhances epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition by decreasing the epithelial marker (claudin-1) and increasing the mesenchymal
  marker (vimentin). The signal cascade promotes migration and invasion abilities
  of CCA cells.
