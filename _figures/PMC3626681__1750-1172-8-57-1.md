caption: Molecular and biochemical studies in hyperlysinemia patients. (A) Schematic
  representation of the lysine degradation pathway. Lysine can be degraded via two
  pathways. The pathway with L-pipecolic acid as an intermediate operates in brain
  and starts with oxidative deamination. The main pathway in other organs, however,
  proceeds via deamination with saccharopine as an intermediate. All genes known to
  operate in this pathway are indicated. ALDH7A1 is deficient in children with pyridoxine-dependent
  seizures []. GCDH is deficient in glutaric aciduria type 1 []. The intermediate
  2-oxoadipate is metabolized by 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase, resembling the TCA cycle
  enzyme complex 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. The E1 subunit of this complex is encoded
  by DHTKD1 and is deficient in 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria []. (B) Immunoblot
  analysis of fibroblast homogenates of hyperlysinemia cases. Cell lysates of 2 control
  subjects and hyperlysinemia cases were resolved by SDS-PAGE (30 μg of protein) blotted
  onto nitrocellulose and analyzed with a polyclonal antibody against AASS. (C) Relative
  expression levels of AASS in fibroblasts determined using qPCR with a primer sets
  specific for the 5′ (R) and 3′ (S) part of the cDNA. Average and SD are provided
  for 3 control fibroblasts. ND denotes not detectable. Expression was normalized
  to the level of cyclophilin B (PPIB). (D) Electropherogram showing that the heterozygous
  c.460G>A mutation in patient 5 appears homozygous at the cDNA level, indicating
  nonsense mediated decay of the other allele (c.2076dup).
