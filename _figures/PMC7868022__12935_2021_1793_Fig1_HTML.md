caption: EBV-induced oncogenesis through the NF-κB signaling pathway. LMP1 can enhance
  the activity of NF-κB, enter the nucleus to activate transcription and promote cell
  proliferation, migration and invasion. LMP1 can inhibit the expression of miRNA-203
  through NF-κB, resulting in high expression of CDH6 and EMT. At the same time, LMP1
  can also activate the IKK2/TPL2/JNK signaling axis, which is beneficial to the survival
  of LCL. The combination of LMP1 and p65 can activate hTERT and inhibit PINX1, which
  together promote cell immortalization. EBV-miRNA-BART13 inhibits NKIRAS2, thereby
  promoting cell proliferation, migration and invasion
