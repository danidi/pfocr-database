caption: The hypothesis includes an assertion (about “motor response inhibition”)
  and associated evidence. The evidence is derived from a particular publication,
  which used a specific cognitive task (the Stop Signal Reaction Time test) to measure
  a specific functional process (which in this example is the cognitive concept “response
  suppression” according to one author [Poldrack]). The hypothesis suggests that this
  process is dependent on functioning of a specific corticostriatal pathway, and this
  circuit (the “indirect pathway”) is linked to a graphical representation of the
  relevant connectional anatomy. The evidence also includes neuroimaging data, including
  functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as supporting links to
  implicate the neuroanatomic circuit components that are putatively involved in the
  behavioral process.
