caption: Terpene biosynthetic pathways and their subcellular compartmentalization
  in plants. Thick arrows denote the classical understanding of terpenoid synthesis
  compartmentalization among cytosol and plastid (Bohlmann et al., ; Chen et al.,
  ; Tholl and Lee, ), reflecting the circumstance that monoterpene and diterpene synthases
  harboring a chloroplast-targeting peptide are functionally active in plastids and
  sesquiterpene synthases lacking the target peptide are active in cytosol. However,
  recent findings of the capacity for multi-substrate use of several mono, sesqui-,
  and, diterpene synthases suggest that when substrate becomes available, several
  cytosolic “sesquiterpene” synthases could also operate as monoterpene synthases,
  and analogously, multi-substrate “monoterpene” and “diterpene” synthases could operate
  as sesquiterpene synthases in plastids (denoted by thin arrows). In addition, terpenoid
  synthesis can also potentially occur in mitochondria (Nagegowda, ; Tholl and Lee,
  ; Dong et al., ). For instance, targeting linalool/(E)-nerolidol synthase (FaNES1)
  from Fragaria ananassa (Table  for protein specifics) to the mitochondria led to
  the production of (E)-nerolidol and homoterpene 4,8-dimethyl nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT)
  in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Kappers et al., ). DMADP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate (C5); MEP pathway, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate pathway; IDP, isopentenyl diphosphate (C5); FDP, farnesyl diphosphate
  (C15); GDP, geranyl diphosphate (C10); GGDP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20); NDP,
  neryl diphosphate (C10).
