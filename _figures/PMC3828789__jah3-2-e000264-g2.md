caption: 'Schematic of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation represented in a mathematical
  model. The 2 pathways to initiate coagulation are shown: the primary extrinsic pathway
  (on the right), and the contact, intrinsic pathway (on the left). These multicomponent
  processes are illustrated as enzymes (open circles), inhibitors (hatched circles),
  zymogens (open boxes), or complexes (open ovals). The contact pathway has no known
  bleeding etiology associated with it and thus is considered accessory to hemostasis.
  The shaded area represents what kinetic reactions are included in our mathematical
  model. On injury to the vessel wall, tissue factor, the cofactor for the extrinsic
  tenase complex, is exposed to circulating factor VIIa and forms the extrinsic tenase
  complex. Factor IX and factor X are converted to their serine proteases, factor
  IXa (FIXa) and factor Xa (FXa), which then form the intrinsic tenase and the prothrombinase
  complexes, respectively—the combined actions of which lead to an explosive burst
  of the enzyme thrombin (IIa). In addition to its multiple procoagulant roles, thrombin
  also acts in an anticoagulant capacity when combined with the cofactor thrombomodulin
  in the protein Case complex. The protein Case reaction generates activated protein
  C (APC), which inactivates the cofactors factors Va and VIIIa, which then no longer
  support the respective procoagulant activities of the prothrombinase and intrinsic
  tenase complexes. The procoagulant response is also downregulated by the stoichiometric
  inhibitors tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin (AT). AT directly
  inhibits thrombin, FIXa, and factor Xa. FPA indicates fibrinopeptide A; FPB, fibrinopeptide
  B; mz‐IIa, meizothrombin.'
