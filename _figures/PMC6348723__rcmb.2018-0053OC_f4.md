caption: Pathway analysis of gene expression identifies IL-13 to be a mediator of
  the sarcoidosis granulomatous response. (A) The gene network most highly overrepresented
  (see the Methods section regarding AmpliSeq analyses) in PBMCs from patients with
  sarcoidosis (n = 6) relative to control subjects (n = 5) 7 days after PPD treatment
  was predicted to be strongly regulated by IL-13 and IL-1β. Genes and gene products
  are represented by their common abbreviated names according to established direct
  (solid lines) or indirect (dashed lines) interactions and the specific nature of
  the interaction. These include binding (straight line), activation (arrow), inhibition
  (truncated line), or either activation or inhibition (truncated line with arrow).
  Genes that are significantly overexpressed in the sarcoidosis group relative to
  controls are highlighted in shades of red, wherein darker shades conform to higher
  differential expression values. The shape of each gene “node” denotes the function
  of the gene product, as indicated in the key. (B) Pathway analysis of gene expression
  results (from Affymetrix GeneChip arrays) obtained from human sarcoidosis lymph
  nodes (n = 5) compared with disease-free control lymph nodes (n = 8) using a cutoff
  of greater than or equal to twofold change (P < 0.05) identified IL-13 and IL-2
  as putative mediators of the granulomatous response, including induction of STAT1
  (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1)-mediated inflammatory signaling.
  (C) Pathway analysis of gene expression results (from Affymetrix GeneChip arrays)
  obtained from human sarcoidosis lung tissues (n = 6) compared with disease-free
  control lung tissues (n = 6) using a cutoff of greater than or equal to twofold
  change (P < 0.05) identified IL-13 as a putative mediator of the granulomatous response,
  including regulation of metalloproteases MMP-12 and ADAMDEC1, the expression of
  which correlated significantly with pulmonary sarcoidosis disease severity ().
