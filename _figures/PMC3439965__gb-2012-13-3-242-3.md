caption: 'Simplified overview of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The typical
  mammalian genome harbors 19 genes encoding Wnt secretory factors and 10 Frizzled
  (Fzd) genes encoding their receptors. Two low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  proteins (Lrp) 5 or 6 act as Fzd co-receptors. Activating combinations of Fzd/Lrp/Wnt
  initiate signaling activity by silencing the activity of a dedicated β-catenin (βcat)
  destruction complex. Dvl gene products are instrumental in achieving this. (a) In
  the absence of Wnt signals, constitutively synthesized cytoplasmic βcat is the immediate
  target of this complex. Essential components of this complex are two tumor suppressor
  proteins: Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) and axin, which act as scaffolds to capture
  newly synthesized βcat and allow its phosphorylation by the constitutively active
  kinases casein kinase-1 (Ck1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), also residing
  in this complex. (b) The Wnt-binding-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of βcat leads
  to import into the nucleus and binding to T-cell transcription factor (Tcf)/Lef
  transcription factors, upon replacement of the transcriptional Groucho repressors.
  Bipartite Tcf/Lef-βcat complexes are the ultimate effectors of this signaling cascade.
  A series of secreted antagonists control signaling activity at the level of ligand
  perception. Secreted Frizzled-related proteins (Sfrp1, 2, 4 and 5), Frzb and Wnt
  inhibitory factor (Wif) can bind Wnt directly and prevent it from activating their
  receptors [-]. The other Wnt antagonists, Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) [] and Wise [], inhibit
  by binding to the Lrp co-receptor. R-spondins, also operating at this level, are
  unique in enhancing Wnt activity. The seven transmembrane Lgr (4, 5 and 6) receptors
  mediating their action were recently uncovered [,,].'
