caption: 'Potential mechanisms underlying the developmental programming of NAFLD.
  (1) Maternal obesity and high fat diet induced mitochondrial dysfunction may be
  programmed in the fetus; (2) maternal circulating lipids are shuttled to the fetal
  liver contributing to mitochondrial oxidative stress; this is characterised by reduced
  MRC activity, overproduction of ROS, and mitochondrial DNA damage. Increased concentrations
  of TAG and FFA contribute to ER stress which can induce additional oxidative stress,
  increase de novo lipogenesis, and activate inflammatory responses via JNK/NF-κB
  pathway. Lipid toxicity can active inflammation via TLR4 signalling pathway in both
  Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, where the former is a major source of proinflammatory
  cytokines including TNFα, IL1β, and IL6. Chronic low-level hepatic NF-κB activation
  further contributes to local and systemic insulin resistance, which in turn influences
  de novo lipogenesis. (3) Maternal undernutrition can reduce 11-β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase (11-β-HSD) in the placenta and therefore increase fetal exposure to
  maternal glucocorticoids. Increased glucocorticoids can lead to fetal de novo lipogenesis.
  Markers that indicate ER stress and de novo lipogenesis can be modified by early
  life epigenetic mechanism which may represent a path for intergenerational transmission
  of disease risk. MRC: mitochondrial respiratory chain; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
