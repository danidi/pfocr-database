caption: RNAi‐mediated regulation of gene expression. (A) Simplified schematic of
  miRNA biogenesis and their subsequent effect on gene expression. In brief, the ribonuclease
  III enzyme DROSHA, together with the DGCR8–microprocessor complex subunit, processes
  the pol II transcribed primary miRNA transcripts to release the precursor miRNA
  (pre‐miRNA). The translocation of the pre‐miRNA to the cytoplasm requires the RAN–GTP
  binding protein (Ran‐GTP)‐dependent export protein Exportin 5 (XPO5). In the cytoplasm,
  a second ribonuclease III enzyme, DICER further processes the pre‐miRNA and together
  with TRBP (TARBP2 subunit of RISC loading complex) facilitates the loading of the
  mature miRNA guide stranded into the RNA‐induced silencing complex or RISC, with
  a member of the argonaute (AGO) family of proteins at its core. The miRNA‐RISC binds
  one or more complementary mRNA sequences, predominantly in the 3ʹUTR of mRNAs with
  a tolerance of some nucleotide mismatches, altering mRNA stability and/or the efficiency
  of translation. (B) An outline of the principal methods used to deliver RNAi reagents
  (shRNAs or synthetic siRNAs) into cells. The delivery of shRNAs typically involves
  the cloning of the sequences corresponding to both strands of the duplex siRNA linked
  through a region that will form a stem‐loop into a viral vector system (usually
  lentiviral‐based) that will facilitate the expression of the shRNA in a mammalian
  cell. The delivery of chemically synthesized duplex RNA molecules, synthetic siRNAs,
  typically involves using a lipid‐based reagent that facilitates uptake into the
  cytoplasm. (C) A simplified schematic of shRNA and siRNA‐mediated targeting of a
  transcript for degradation via the RNAi pathway. Following the delivery or generation
  of the duplex RNA, the guide strand loads into RISC with argonaute RISC catalytic
  component 2 (AGO2) at its core. The RNA‐loaded AGO2‐RISC can interact with all regions
  of an mRNA, and through perfect or near‐perfect base‐pairing catalyzes the cleavage
  of the mRNA, resulting in transcript degradation. 3ʹUTR, 3ʹ untranslated region;
  miRNA, microRNA; mRNA, messenger RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; shRNA, short hairpin
  RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA
