caption: Mechanisms of HIF activation in cancer. Hypoxia is a common mechanism of
  HIF activation in cancer. Low oxygen tensions inhibit both prolyl-4-hydroxylase
  domain (PHD) and factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) activity, which negatively regulates
  HIF stability and cofactor (p300/CBP) recruitment, respectively. Under normoxic
  conditions, PHD enzymes (PHD 1–3) utilize oxygen as a substrate to hydroxylate key
  proline residues located within the HIF-α ODD domain. This hydroxylation event mediates
  pVHL binding and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome.
  Under conditions of hypoxia or loss of pVHL, HIF-α is stabilized and translocates
  to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with ARNT and binds to hypoxia response
  elements (HREs) within regulatory regions of target genes. The HIF heterodimer activates
  gene expression at these sites upon cofactor (p300/CBP) recruitment. The interaction
  between HIF and p300 is regulated in an oxygen-dependent manner by FIH. FIH uses
  oxygen to hydroxylate asparagine residues within the HIF-α C-terminal transactivation
  domain, thereby preventing p300 binding. HIF activity can also be induced in tumor
  cells through activation of the PI-3 kinase/Akt-signaling pathway. Growth factor
  signaling, oncogenic Ras activation, or inhibition of negative regulators, including
  PTEN and TSC2 can activate the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway and induce HIF activity in
  tumor cells
