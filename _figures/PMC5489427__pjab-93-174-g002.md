caption: Increase of P2X4R expression through the actions of fibronectin in activated
  microglia after nerve injury. (A) Fibronectin increases after nerve injury and binds
  to α5β1 integrin on microglial cells, resulting in the activation of the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (MEK-ERK) signaling cascades through the action of the tyrosine
  kinase Lyn. Signaling through the PI3K-Akt pathway induces degradation of p53 via
  MDM2 and enhances P2X4R gene expression. Activated MEK-ERK signaling enhances eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) phosphorylation via activated MAPK-interacting
  protein kinase-1 (MNK1), which may lead to enhancement of P2X4R translation. Thus,
  fibronectin enhances the expression of functional P2X4Rs. (B) The subcellular localization
  of P2X4R is restricted to lysosomes and is translocated into the cell membrane by
  stimulation. Fibronectin increases the release of CCL2 from activated microglia
  and CCL2 stimulates the CC chemokine receptor CCR2, resulting in the stimulation
  of P2X4R trafficking to the cell surface from lysosomes of microglia. (C) Interferon
  8 (IRF8) expression is markedly enhanced in microglia after PNI. IRF8 binds directly
  to the promoter loci of IRF5 and activates the transcription of IRF5, resulting
  in the increase of IRF5. Fibronectin activates IRF5 to translocate it from the cytosol
  to the nucleus. IRF5 induces de novo expression of P2X4R by binding directly to
  the promoter region of the P2rx4 gene. Altogether, fibronectin has a very important
  role for the expression of P2X4R after nerve injury.
