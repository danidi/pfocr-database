caption: The de novo hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and GlcNAc salvage pathway.
  In most cell types, 2–5% of cellular glucose (Glc) enters the HBP, resulting in
  the end product, UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc can be used by OGT to catalyze the addition
  of GlcNAc to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, whereas OGA catalyzes the removal
  of the O-GlcNAc PTM. GFAT is the rate-limiting enzyme for the HBP. GK, glucokinase;
  G-6-Pase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase;
  GAT, acetyl-CoA:D-glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase; GNK, GlcNAc kinase;
  AGM, phosphor-N-acetylglucosamine mutase; AGX1, UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase. (see
