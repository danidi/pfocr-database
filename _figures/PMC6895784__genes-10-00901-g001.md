caption: Double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
  Solid lines correspond to single DNA strands and dotted lines correspond to newly
  synthesized DNA; 3′ ends are indicated by half arrowheads. General mechanistic details
  are described in the text. (a) Unresected DNA ends are joined by non-homologous
  end-joining (NHEJ) while resection commits repair to a process that involves invasion
  of a donor repair template. During the resolution of the double Holliday junction
  (HJ) intermediates of the DSB repair pathway, the paired open and filled triangles
  reflect positions of junction cleavage and ligation. Cleavage of both junctions
  in either the horizontal or vertical orientation (open and closed triangles, respectively)
  yields non-crossover (NCO) products; cleavage in different orientations results
  in crossovers (COs). In break-induced replication (BIR), the invading end is extended
  to the end of the repair template and then is used as the template for synthesis
  of the complementary strand. Both new strands are on the repaired molecule, and
  the donor is unchanged. (b) Homology between direct repeats is exposed by end resection,
  and the annealing of the complementary strands generates tails that must be removed
  before ligation. Single-strand annealing (SSA) requires more homology than microhomology-mediated
  end-joining (MMEJ).
