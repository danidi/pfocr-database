caption: Proposed roles of mesaconyl-CoA hydratase/β-methylmalyl-CoA dehydratase in
  two bacterial pathways of central carbon metabolism. The boxes mark the postulated
  reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. (A) Proposed 3-hydroxypropionate cycle of autotrophic
  CO2 fixation in C. aurantiacus. 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; 2, malonyl-CoA reductase;
  3, propionyl-CoA synthase; 4, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; 5, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase;
  6, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; 7, succinyl-CoA:l-malate CoA transferase; 8, succinate
  dehydrogenase; 9, fumarate hydratase; 10, l-malyl-CoA lyase/β-methylmalyl-CoA lyase;
  11, mesaconyl-CoA hydratase; 12, unknown reactions; 13, succinyl-CoA:citramalate
  CoA-transferase; 14, citramalyl-CoA-lyase. (B) Proposed alternate glyoxylate cycle
  for acetate assimilation in isocitrate-lyase-negative bacteria, such as R. sphaeroides.
  This pathway, termed the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway, also serves to assimilate acetyl-CoA
  produced from methanol and CO2 in methylotrophic bacteria, such as M. extorquens,
  which uses the serine cycle for formaldehyde fixation during growth on methanol.
  1, β-ketothiolase; 2, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; 3, crotonase; 4, crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase;
  5, ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase; 6, methylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase; 7, mesaconyl-CoA
  hydratase; 8, l-malyl-CoA lyase/β-methylmalyl-CoA lyase; 9, malyl-CoA hydrolase;
  10, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; 11, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase; 12, methylmalonyl-CoA
  mutase.
