caption: Model for the regulation of Hippo and Notch by Lgl. In epithelial cells,
  Lgl/aPKC regulate the Hippo pathway by promoting the correct localization of Hpo/Rassf,
  therefore allowing the phosphorylation of Yki and preventing its translocation into
  the nucleus and the activation of Hippo pathway targets, dIAP1 and CycE. Lgl also
  regulates the ligand-dependent activation of Notch, in an aPKC-independent manner.
  In ligand-dependent Notch activation, the ligand (Delta) binds to the extracellular
  domain (N-ecd), it is cleaved by S2 protease and the Delta/Necd complex is internalized
  in the signal sending cell. S2 cleaved Notch (N-ext) is endocytosed and cleaved
  by γ-secretase (S3) in early endosomes (EE), or in early-multivesicular body (early-MVBs),
  releasing the active cytoplasmic N-icd fragment, which translocates into the nucleus,
  thereby inducing transcription of target genes, such as Enhancer of split complex
  (E(spl)-C). Unprocessed Notch can traffic through to the late endosome (LE)/lysosome
  where it undergoes proteasomal degradation. Extrapolating from our data, we propose
  that Lgl plays a role in controlling the activity of Notch by regulating its trafficking
  from the EE, early-MVB, to MVB-LE stage. Lgl also directly or indirectly limits
  the acidification process of the endosomes, thereby attenuating Notch signaling
  by preventing its cleavage by γ-secretase.
