caption: Current model of the BB pathway. Functional components for biosynthesis,
  secretion, uptake, and hydrolysis are indicated in rectangular boxes. Regulatory
  components are shown in star-shaped boxes. Positive or negative regulation is indicated
  at the arrows with plus or minus sign, respectively. Iron or ligand sensing (s)
  is also indicated. Dashed arrows and question marks in the case of Mta ligand sensing
  and degradation or export of BB hydrolysis products indicate that these processes
  are to be analyzed. NRPS, nonribosomal peptide sythetase.
