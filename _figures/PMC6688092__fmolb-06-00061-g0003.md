caption: 53BP1 recruitment DSBs and its regulation by phosphorylation. Recruitment
  of 53BP1 to DSBs involves recognition of the DSB by the MRN complex, ATM activation,
  and phosphorylation of histone H2A.X on residue Ser139 (γH2A.X). 53BP1 is phosphorylated
  on its 28 S/TQ sites by ATM. The ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 are recruited
  downstream of ATM phosphorylation of yH2AX and are required for 53BP1 recruitment
  to chromatin. DYRK1A modulates the recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs through interaction
  with RNF169. RNF169 competes with RNF168 for binding of 53BP1 and has a function
  in repair pathway choice by limiting 53BP1 at DSBs. Thus, DYRK1A enhances NHEJ by
  regulating the recruitment of RNF169 and 53BP1 to DSB sites. BRCA1 together with
  the DNA endonuclease CtIP trigger dephosphorylation of 53BP1, which repositions
  53BP1 to the periphery and allows recruitment of HR factors such as BRCA1, Exo,1
  and RPA to the center of the DDR focus, promoting HR (created by Biorender).
