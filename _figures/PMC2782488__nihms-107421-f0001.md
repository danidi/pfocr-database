caption: (A) Stat5 signaling from cytokines that use γc is essential for T cell development.
  Mice or humans lacking key components of this pathway (γc, Jak3, Stat5) fail to
  develop T cells. (B) Stat5 signaling controls the development of FoxP3-positive
  T regs. (C) Stat3 is crucial to the development and function of Th17 cells. IL-23
  and IL-6 enforce Th17 development via the direct or indirect induction of Rorc and
  Rora expression. Stat3 also regulates the expression of IL-17-encoding genes and
  Il21, which acts in an autocrine/paracrine way to regulate Th17 cells. Socs3 is
  an important inhibitor of cytokines that use gp130 (IL-23R and IL-6R) while Socs1
  is anticipated to inhibit any cytokines that use γc (IL-7, IL-21 as shown).
