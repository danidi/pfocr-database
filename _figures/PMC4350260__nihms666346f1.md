caption: 'Canonical NF-κB, a homodimer of p65 and p50 proteins, is cytoplasmic and
  inactivated by IκB proteins. NF-κB is activated by numerous stimuli including pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. In this figure, we demonstrate TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. Specifically,
  TNF-α binds to the TNF-α receptor, which undergoes receptor trimerization and recruits
  TRADD and other molecules (not shown). Collectively, this activates the IKK complex,
  which is composed of three subunits: α, β and γ. IKKβ phosphorylates (yellow circle)
  IκB, which targets it for proteasomal mediated degradation. As a consequence, the
  newly liberated NF-κB molecules translocate to the nucleus, bind DNA and induce
  the expression of target genes such as IL-6 and IL-8. In the nucleus, Pin1 enhances
  NF-κB signaling while LRRFIP1 and ING4 inhibit NF-κB activity. Several miRs also
  influence NF-κB signaling. In particular, miR-31 inhibits NF-κB signaling by targeting
  TRADD, while miR-30e* and miR-21 enhance NF-κB signaling by targeting IκB and LRRFIP1,
  respectively. STAT3 signaling is activated by cytokines of the IL-6 family. These
  proteins bind to a receptor complex composed of a common gp130 subunit, and a cytokine
  specific receptor, i.e., IL-6 receptor. Members of the JAK family of kinases are
  associated with the gp130-receptor complex and are activated by ligand binding.
  JAKs trans- and auto-phosphorylate the receptor and STAT3 proteins. Next, STAT3
  dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, binds DNA and induces the expression of
  target genes including SOCS3 and miR-21. STAT3 signaling is inhibited by PIAS3,
  PTPRD, SOCS3 and miR-9. Some target genes contain response elements for both NF-κB
  and STAT3, such as ICAM and VEGFA. NF-κB and STAT3 signaling is also positively
  influenced by RTKs, which activate IKK and JAK kinases. We and others have shown
  that CK2 can directly phosphorylate NF-κB p65 and IκB to promote NF-κB signaling
  and that CK2 can interact with JAK1/2 to activate STAT3 signaling. CK2 also phosphorylates
  Akt. Akt signals through mTORC to positively impact STAT3 signaling. Recently, Akt
  was shown to interact with EZH2, a methyltransferase, to promote STAT3 methylation
  (orange circles) and activity. Finally, MAPK signaling also positively influences
  signals through both the NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathway. In GBM, these pathways
  are aberrantly activated and ensure maximal NF-κB and STAT3 activation.'
