caption: DN Tregs employ multiple mechanisms to exert antigen-specific control over
  immune responses. This figure summarizes the major mechanisms discussed in the text.
  Note that the different mechanisms have been demonstrated to be operative in different
  models and contexts. (1) Immature/tolerogenic DCs secreting EBI3 can elicit IFNγ
  from DN Tregs, resulting in allograft tolerance by an undetermined mechanism ().
  (2) Mature or immature DCs presenting alloantigen to DN Tregs are susceptible to
  apoptosis via, at least partially, the Fas pathway (). (3) DN Treg-expressed CTLA4
  also interacts with CD80/CD86 on mature DCs causing downregulation of these molecules
  on the DC surface, making the DCs less capable of priming allogeneic T cell responses
  (). (4) DN Tregs can acquire alloantigen from DCs via trogocytosis and present them
  to T cells bearing the same TCR specificity as the DN Tregs. The T cell is then
  susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis (). This mechanism has only been demonstrated
  for CD8+ T cells, but CD4+ T cells are also susceptible to killing by DN Tregs.
  (5) Similarly, B cells presenting specific antigen in the context of MHC class II
  are susceptible to killing by DN Tregs (), and this appears to be via a perforin/granzyme-mediated
  process (). NK cells can also be killed by DN Treg perforin/granzyme (). (6) The
  ability of DN T cells from lpr mice to kill syngeneic Fas+ T cells is under the
  control of autocrine IFNγ, secreted upon TCR stimulation (our unpublished data).
  (7) IL-10 secreted by DN Tregs can inhibit autoimmune diabetes development by an
  as-yet unknown mechanism (indicated by the question mark) while also limiting DN
  Treg expansion ().
