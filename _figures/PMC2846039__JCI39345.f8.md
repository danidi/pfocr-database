caption: Chronic inhibition of ACE reduces its direct effects on Ang I to Ang II conversion,
  but it increases bradykinin/B2 receptor窶電ependent chymase release from MCs, which
  counteracts the direct effect of ACE inhibition on Ang II formation through the
  chymase pathway of Ang II formation. In this scheme, we suggest that the effect
  of bradykinin on MC chymase release is direct; however, it is also possible that
  the bradykinin/B2 receptor mechanism indirectly causes chymase release. Chymase
  release also has a myriad of effects on factors that promote the inflammatory response
  and tissue remodeling. ET-1, endothelin-1; TIMP-1, tissue inhibitor-1 of metalloproteinase.
