caption: In a variety of associative learning systems, a potential coincidence between
  the trained stimulus and the reinforcement is detected at the pre-synapse by a particular
  kind of adenylate cyclase. The stimulus acts on the respective neurons, raising
  the intracellular Ca++ concentration. The reinforcement induces the release of a
  transmitter that binds to its respective G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) on the
  very same neurons and activates the G protein (G*). If stimulus and reinforcement
  are appropriately timed, the two types of input act synergistically on the adenylate
  cyclase (AC*), triggering cAMP signalling, and thus lead to the strengthening of
  the output from these neurons to the respective conditioned behaviour pathway.
