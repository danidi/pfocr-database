caption: 'A three-stage pathway for tau-dependent cell cycle re-entry induced by Aβ1–42
  oligomers. The pathway includes three sequential steps: (1) Aβ1–42 oligomer-induced
  activation of fyn, PKA and CaMKII; (2) phosphorylation by these kinases of tau at
  Y18, S409 and at S416, respectively; and (3) exit of neurons from G0 into G1.'
