caption: Drug actions in the heme degradation pathway. HO-1 (inducible) and HO-2 (constitutive)
  cleave free heme or denatured heme proteins to generate CO, ferritin, and biliverdin,
  which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. CO has both
  anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties ,,,, Ferritin is essential for cellular
  redox reactions ,, Serum bilirubin levels are positively linked with a decreased
  risk of CVD and protection against diabetes and vascular dysfunction ,. Drugs focused
  on the heme degradation pathway predominantly induce HO-1 activity, possibly by
  interacting with the gene promoter. Biliverdin reductase functions via a direct
  increase of HO-1 or an increase in bilirubin levels to promote a reduction in oxidative
  species ,. And mesobiliverdin enhances β-cell function in the pancreas through its
  antioxidant properties  This pathway provides the basis for multiple pharmaceutical
  and genetic agents that can protect against CVD by increasing HO-1 expression.
