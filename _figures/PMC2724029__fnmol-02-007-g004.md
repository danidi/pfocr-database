caption: Signaling networks upregulated in migrating neuroblasts. (A) Calmodulin-signaling
  network. (B) Akt1-DNA transcription network. Networks were identified by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis and subsequently modified using Bibliosphere, PathwayArchitect,
  GO and pathway databases. The intensity of the red color indicates the extent of
  gene upregulation. Connecting lines with arrowheads indicate activation of proteins,
  without arrowheads protein–protein interaction. Continuous and dashed lines are
  direct and indirect activation/interaction, respectively. Node description is indicated
  in the right upper corner.
