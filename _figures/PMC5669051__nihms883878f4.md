caption: 'A. Stimulation of AC and PKA potentiates the N-acyltransferase (Ca2+-dependent
  transacylase, CDTA). An arachidonic acid chain is transferred by CDTA from the sn-1
  position of a phospholipid to the primary amine of phosphatidylethanolamine, in
  a Ca2+-dependent manner, forming N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (N-ArPE),
  an intermediate. This N-ArPE is then hydrolyzed by a phospholipase D (PLD)-like
  enzyme to yield anandamide (AEA) (, , ). It is not clear whether the N-acyltransferase
  (NAT) or the N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD)
  controls the rate-limiting step of AEA synthesis (, , ). NAPE-PLD knockout mice
  exhibit normal AEA biosynthesis, suggesting the involvement of other enzymes ().
  Another pathway that regulates the conversion of NAPE into 2-lysol-NAPEs by the
  activity of secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) has also been proposed. 2-Lysol-NAPEs by the
  action of selective lysophospholipase D (lyso-PLD) () is then converted into N-acyl-ethanolamides,
  including AEA. 2-Lysol-NAPEs, through the action of abhydrolase domain 4 (ABHD4)
  (), are turned into glycero-p-AEA, which is then converted by glycerol phosphodiesterase
  (GDE1) () into AEA. A recent study using mouse brain and RAW264.7 macrophages proposed
  the existence of an analogous pathway where NAPE converted into pAEA by the action
  of PLC. The pAEA is subsequently dephosphorylated by a protein tyrosine phosphatase
  (PTPN22) (). As a putative neuromodulator, AEA that is released into the synaptic
  cleft is expected to be rapidly inactivated. In general, there are two known mechanisms
  for removing endocannabinoids from the synaptic cleft to ensure rapid signal inactivation:
  re-uptake or enzymatic degradation. AEA is inactivated by reuptake (, ) via an uncharacterized
  membrane transport molecule, the ‘AEA membrane transporter’ (AMT) (, , , , , , ),
  and subsequently, undergoes intracellular enzymatic degradation. FAAH metabolizes
  AEA to arachidonic acid, and ethanolamine leading to rapid clearance of AEA from
  extracellular compartments (, ). B. Intracellular Ca2+ initiates 2-AG biosynthesis
  by activating the process of formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) (, ) in the membrane
  by stimulating the phosphatidyl-inositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) pathway. 2-AG
  is the product of DAG-lipase (DAGL) acting on DAG (, ). The second route involves
  hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) by phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and hydrolysis
  of the resultant lyso-PI by a specific lyso-PLC (). 2-AG is also synthesized through
  the conversion of 2-arachidonyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by phosphatase (). 2-AG
  activates CB1Rs with greater efficacy than does AEA. Like AEA, 2-AG is inactivated
  by reuptake (, ) via the AMT (, , , , , , ) and subsequently undergoes intracellular
  enzymatic degradation (, , ) by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL).'
