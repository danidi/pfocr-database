caption: Hypothetical Model for BMP9 Regulation of ESC-Derived Vascular Precursor
  Differentiation in Co-culture with Murine OP9 Stromal CellsLow BMP9 concentrations
  induce the formation of LYVE-1+ early lymphatic-specified endothelial cells through
  ALK1 activation. BMP9 was observed to directly activate FLK-1+ vascular precursors
  and earlier stages of vascular committed cells through mobilization of the NFATc1
  signaling pathway. Moreover, an increase in the proliferation of the LYVE-1-positive
  cell population was found to largely contribute to its expansion. At higher doses,
  BMP9 could, in addition to ALK1, also activate ALK2 present on OP9 stromal cells.
  This leads to a significant rise in the secretion of VEGF-A by OP9 cells, with as
  a resultant effect an increase in LYVE-1− endothelial cell population at the expense
  of the LYVE-1+ early lymphatic-specified endothelial cell formation.
