caption: RNA viruses often encode structured RNAs or produce double‑stranded RNA (dsRNA)
  intermediates. Some DNA viruses produce convergent transcripts that form dsRNAs
  and also transcribe structured RNAs. These RNAs are recognized and cleaved by Dicer‑2
  to form virus‑derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are loaded into an
  Argonaute 2‑containing RNA‑induced silencing complex (RISC) to silence viral expression.
  Dicer‑2 also initiates the transcription of antiviral genes through an as‑yet‑unidentified
  pathway. Endogenous retrotransposon‑encoded reverse transcriptase can generate viral‑derived
  cDNA, which can be further transcribed and amplify the RNA interference (RNAi) response.
  Another RNAi pathway, the PIWI‑interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, protects the cell
  from endogenous mobile genetic elements, especially those in the germ line. In addition
  to these nucleic‑acid‑triggered responses, some viruses can be directly sensed by
  Toll‑7 to induce antiviral autophagy dependent on the conserved AKT pathway involving
  phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K) and target of rapamycin (Tor).
