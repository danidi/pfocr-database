caption: Of the several different complexes that are thought to be important for MLL-leukemogenesis,
  the Dot1l complex (a), the SEC complex (b) and the Brd4 complex (c) are depicted.
  Overlapping components are highlighted by enclosing with dotted rectangles. The
  Dot1l complex (DotCom) consists of the histone methyltransferase Dot1l and the MLL
  fusion partners AF10, AF9, ENL and AF17, along with components of the Wnt signaling
  pathway. The AEP/EAP and SEC complexes comprise of a number of unique and overlapping
  components and notably, several proteins in these complexes participate in fusions
  with MLL. The PAFc complex, which physically interacts with the N-terminal part
  of wild-type MLL as well as with MLL fusion genes is a multi-protein complex that
  consists of the core components PAF1, LEO1, CDC73, CTR9 and WDR61 (reviewed in()).
  Recently, BRD4 was shown to co-purify with some components of both the SEC as well
  as the PAFc complexes; however, it is yet unclear whether BRD4 is part of the MLL-AF9/PAFc/SEC
  multi-subunit complex or if it associates with PAFc/SEC in other complexes which
  are independent from the MLL-fusion protein.
