caption: In the presence of the synthetic Smo agonist SAG or in cancers expressing
  a constitutively active Smo protein, Gli is predominantly regulated by Smo found
  in an extraciliary compartment. On the other hand, Hh-induced Smo activation in
  the primary cilium may be dependent upon Smo interaction with an endogenous small
  molecule.
