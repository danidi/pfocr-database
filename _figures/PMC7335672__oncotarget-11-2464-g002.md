caption: (A) Diagram depicting the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) into PGE2/other
  prostaglandins and LTB4/leukotrienes by cyclooxygenases or Lipoxygenases, respectively.
  Enzymes within the pathway are represented in red. AA pathway short-lived intermediates
  and mature eicosanoids are represented in black. (*) Indicate genes with putative
  miR-708 binding sites. (B, C) Sequence and predicted miR-708 binding sites to the
  full length wild-type COX-2 (B) and mPGES-1 (C) 3′ UTRs. miR-708 seed sequence is
  indicated in red, straight lines indicate matched pairing while dotted lines represent
  G-U mismatch pairing.
