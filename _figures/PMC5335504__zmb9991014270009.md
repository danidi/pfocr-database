caption: 'Proposed model for the role of ADAP2 in antiviral response. A cartoon showing
  the proposed model to explain the mode of action of ADAP2 during RIG-I signaling.
  The proteins are shown with their domains labeled. The interactions of ADAP2 with
  individual protein are specifically marked at their experimentally identified sites
  of interaction, except for TRAF3. (A) In uninfected cells, ADAP2 is not in complex
  with any other protein of PRR signaling pathway. (B) Upon viral infection, two independent
  events will happen: (i) sensing of virus by RIG-I activates and induces polymerization
  of MAVS, and (ii) ADAP2 forms a complex with TRAF3, NEMO, TBK1 and IRF3, triggered
  by signal-1. This will bring IRF3 in proximity to TBK1. (C) In the later stages
  of viral infection, ADAP2-NEMO-TBK1-IRF3 complex will bind to polymerized MAVS,
  likely triggered by an unidentified signal-2. This will activate TBK1 to phosphorylate
  IRF3. KBD, kinase binding domain; KD, kinase domain; CC, coiled coil; ULD, ubiquitin
  like domain; IAD, IRF association domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; CARD, caspase
  activation and recruitment domain.'
