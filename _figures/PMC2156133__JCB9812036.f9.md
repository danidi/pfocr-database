caption: 'Hypothetical signaling pathways by which β-catenin might integrate cell
  adhesion, cell cycle, and apoptosis. A, The individual regulatory relationships
  depicted by unbroken arrows and blockades have been demonstrated in various published
  reports. However, these signaling pathways have never been demonstrated in their
  entirety within a single experimental system. The broken blockades are hypothetical
  regulatory events suggested in the present report. Integrin-activated FAK activity
  may regulate β-catenin signaling by two different pathways. In both cases, two sequential
  negative regulatory interactions downstream of FAK may result in the activation
  of β-catenin signaling. By a parallel pathway, ILK can regulate the activities of
  PKB and GSK-3β, as well as upregulate the expression of the transcription factor
  LEF-1. Together, β-catenin and LEF-1 might stimulate the G1/S transition in the
  cell cycle (possibly via c-myc) and inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis. The inhibition
  of apoptosis may be through direct modulation of p53 action or through a parallel
  antiapoptotic pathway. The role of p53 in β-catenin–mediated signaling is speculative.
  B, β-catenin may regulate the cell cycle by two separate mechanisms: 1, β-catenin
  can stimulate the expression of c-myc, which is a strong stimulator of cell cycle
  progression; 2, the G1/S transition represents an important decision-point for the
  cell. It is known that this transition requires the presence of survival factors.
  In their absence, the cell chooses apoptosis over proliferation. β-Catenin may regulate
  the G1/S transition as a survival factor functioning to permit cell cycle progression
  by preventing apoptosis.'
