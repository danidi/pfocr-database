caption: Regulation of Rac activity by FAK paxillin. (A) FAK/p130cas stimulates Rac
  activation, whereas FAK/paxillin may inhibit Rac activity. This may occur via direct
  targeting of Rac by FAK/paxillin-associated regulators of Rac (1). Alternatively,
  FAK/paxillin signaling may interfere via crosstalk with a distinct signaling pathway
  (X) that promotes Rac activation (2). (B) In this schematic of the edge of a cell,
  peripheral Rac activity is low (red), whereas nonperipheral Rac activity is high
  (green). At the periphery, FAK/paxillin may function to reduce Rac activity. This
  could be achieved by discrete relocalization of FAK/paxillin or spatially dependent
  modulation of the Rac-inhibiting activity of FAK/paxillin. (C) In this schematic
  of two cells in contact, FAK/paxillin signaling and N-cadherin signaling may both
  contribute to the reduced levels of active Rac near cell–cell junctions.
