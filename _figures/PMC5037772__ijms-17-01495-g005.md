caption: 'Pin1 regulates multiple signal transductions in metabolic organs. Pin1 enhances
  insulin signaling through binding to IRS-1 and suppresses gluconeogenesis by associating
  with CRTC2, CREB and Stat3 in the liver. In addition, Pin1 increases liver fibrosis
  through regulation of the TGF-Smad pathway. In adipocytes, upregulation of insulin
  signaling by Pin1 leads to the induction of lipid synthesis and obesity. However,
  Pin1 suppresses myogenesis via degradation of MEF2C and decreases fatty acid synthesis
  by inhibiting AMPK phosphorylation. Pin1 also enhances osteoblast formation and
  suppresses osteoclast fusion, thereby preventing osteoporosis. Furthermore, Pin1
