caption: NPY inhibits BAT thermogenesis via reduced SNS outflow. Increased release
  of NPY in the hypothalamus inhibits sympathetic nerve system (SNS) outflow, particularly
  norepinephrine (NE) release. Consequently, it inhibits the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway
  via β-adrenergic receptors. Reduced lipolysis decreases the level of fatty acid
  storage in the brown adipose tissue, together with reduced uncoupling protin 1 (UCP1)
  expression and secretion, resulting in reduced thermogenic potential. Consequently,
  with less fatty acids being transported into the mitochondria by the carnitine palmitoyl
  transferase (carnitine shuttle) and also reduced UCP1 functioning to dissipate the
  proton-motive force across the mitochondrial membrane, there is less heat production.
  Part of the picture is summarized from [].
