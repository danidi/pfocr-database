caption: 'Host-Helminth interaction: There are two sides of immune response against
  a parasite invasion, one leads to worm survival in host and the other to worm killing.
  The breaking of intestinal epithelial barrier by helminth generate alarmins and
  recruit dendritic cells to the site of infection. Helminth’s associated immunogens
  like excretory secretory (ES) products, eggs, helminth derived products etc., plays
  important role. The immunomodulation by helminth and host response have specific
  cytokine signature. The immune regulation from worm survival to worm killing is
  tightly regulated at post-transcriptional level by microRNA. Immune cells and cytokines
  have specific microRNA profile which decide the course of pathway. Here, microRNAs
  stated in gray boxes have been found in host of diseases and are suspected to play
  role in host-helminth interaction by controlling the immune cells or associated
  cytokines.'
