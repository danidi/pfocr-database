caption: Summary of several known kinases (blue/purple diamonds) and RNA binding factors
  (orange/red ovals) that have been shown to be regulated in response to antigen (Ag)
  stimulation or Fas Ligand (FasL) signaling in T cells, and the genes (text) that
  they regulate. Solid arrows and lines indicate direct activities, dotted arrows/lines
  indicate known relationships that are likely indirect. ‘other’ indicates the fact
  that there are likely many other signaling pathways that are also involved in mediating
  antigen-induced changes in AS that are yet to be discovered. Question marks are
  meant to emphasize that although each signaling pathway so far has only been linked
  to regulation of 1–2 genes, each branch likely regulates a program of co-regulated
  genes. Cross-coordination between branches is also anticipated, as observed for
  CD45. See text for detailed description of each pathway.
