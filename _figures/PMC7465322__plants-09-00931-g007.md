caption: A possible functional network of the AR induction pathway in sugarcane. After
  supplementation with exogenous IBA and NAA mixture, proteins related to auxin homeostasis
  and transport facilitated auxin accumulation in sugarcane, which promoted auxin
  signaling. Enhanced ethylene biosynthesis accompanied changed ethylene signaling.
  Meanwhile, the cytokinin, brassinosteroid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid signals
  were affected. Auxin signaling plays a positive role in stimulating phenylpropanoid
  biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis. Flavonoids, which are produced via phenylpropanoid
  biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis, can affect auxin transportation. The accumulation
  of flavonoids induced by auxin can promote AR formation. Genes related to cell wall
  modification are also associated with AR formation through the degradation and loosening
  of the cell wall, which might be the limiting factor for rooting ability. In addition,
  the cell cycle plays a key role in cell division and differentiation, and this process
  is also critical for AR formation. However, the gene that determines cell fate transition
  remains elusive.
