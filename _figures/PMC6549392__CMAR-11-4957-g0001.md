number: Figure 1
caption: The negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling. Binding of the ligand to cytokine
  receptor induces receptor dimerization and activation of receptor associated JAK
  kinase, which in turn phosphorylates STAT proteins. After forming a homodimer, STAT
  proteins translocate to the nucleus to control gene expression. Negative regulation
  of the JAK-STAT pathway is provided by PTPs, SOCS and PIAS proteins.
