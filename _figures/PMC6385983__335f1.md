caption: 'Formation and modification of the pyridine heterocycle in PLP biosynthesis.
  Two biosynthetic strategies for the formation of the pyridine heterocycle of PLP
  are depicted. The final two steps of the DXP-dependent pathway for PLP biosynthesis
  are shown in black arrows, and the DXP-independent pathway is shown with gray. Enzymatic
  steps involved in salvage of B6 vitamers are depicted with hashed arrows. Proteins
  catalyzing each step are noted by the relevant arrows, using E. coli (black/hatched)
  or S. cerevisiae (gray) nomenclature. Abbreviations: DXP – deoxyxyulose-5-phosphate;
  PL – pyridoxal; PM – pyridoxamine; PN – pyridoxine; PLP – pyridoxal-5′-phosphate.'
