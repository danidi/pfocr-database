caption: Tetraspanin roles during HIV-1 infection. (A) Tetraspanins regulate transinfection
  of T-lymphocytes. Dendritic cells stablish contacts with T-lymphocytes during antigen
  presentation. HIV-1 takes advantage of immune synapses to enhance the infection
  of T-lymphocytes, the main target cells for the virus. This strategy is called trans-enhancement
  or transinfection and takes place through two different pathways. One involves the
  endocytosis of viral particles by DCs, which gives them access to endosomal compartments.
  As happens with exosomes, viral particles accumulate in multivesicular bodies that
  finally fuse with the plasma membrane releasing those particles together with exosomes
  into the intercellular space. The second pathway involves TSPAN7, which inhibits
  viral endocytosis and promotes formation of actin rich protrusions in DCs. In this
  scenario, viral particles are sequestered on the surface of these cells, allowing
  virus exposure and transfer to T-lymphocytes. (B) TEM regulation of HIV-1 entry.
  CD4 and co-receptors CCR5/CXCR4 segregate within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains
  (TEMs), which control their proper distribution and dynamics enhancing HIV-1 attachment
  efficiency and subsequent entry. CD63 regulates the expression of CXCR4 on the cell
  surface by stimulating its degradation through the lysosomal pathway. Env binding
  to its receptor and co-receptor brings them closer and triggers several intracellular
  pathways where actin polymerization is the main response. Active LIMK1 phosphorylates
  and inactivates cofilin, stimulating actin polymerization. Proteins such as moesin
  or α-actinin have a structural function as they link receptors and tetraspanins
  to the subcortical actin network. Other proteins such as drebrin control the stability
  of the actin web. TSPAN7 is also a positive regulator of actin polymerization, although
  the effectors downstream have not been addressed yet. (C) HIV-1 assembly occurs
  at TEMs. Viral protein Gag interacts with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane
  via its myristoylation, which increases the affinity for cholesterol-enriched areas.
  Gag also interacts with the positively charged PIP2 and the inner loop of different
  tetraspanins such as CD81 and CD82. Gag induces CD9 clusterization. However, there
  is no direct evidence indicating an essential requirement for tetraspanins during
  HIV-1 budding. Recruitment of all these components into restricted areas may involve
  the presence of the subcortical actin web for their stabilization, where talin and
  vinculin would act as a link. (D) HIV-1 reverse transcription (RT) is regulated
  by tetraspanins. SAMHD1 is a negative regulator of viral RT as it decreases the
  concentration of deoxynucleotide triphosphates available in the cell. CD81 regulates
  SAMHD1 activity by stimulating its degradation via proteasome. CD81 depletion induces
  the relocalization of SAMHD1 inside early endosomes. ADAM-10 activity is regulated
  by tetraspanin TSPANC8 subfamily. The resulting intracellular domain when cleaved
  by a γ-secretase has been identified recently as a component of the PIC. When RT
  is completed, viral DNA is transported into the nucleus where it integrates in the
  cell genome.
