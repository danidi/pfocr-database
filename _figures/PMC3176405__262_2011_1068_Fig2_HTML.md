caption: 'In tumors, an increase in Trx1 levels (1) leads to abnormal redox cellular
  regulation determining imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant Trx1(2) and between
  oxidized and reduced states of RCD30 (3), so establishing RCD30 inability to engage
  CD30L (4) and transducer signals of intracellular pathways for Treg/Th1/Th17 cytokine
  production (5). When levels of sCD30 (shed from the plasma membrane upon CD30L binding
  (6) increase (7), sCD30 binds to CD30L with high affinity blocking CD30/CD30L transmembrane
  signaling (8). Thus, abnormal increases in the levels of Trx1 and sCD30 (biomarkers
  9 of extracellular pathways of Trx1/CD30 target) result in both deregulation of
  M and DC pathways of Treg/Th1/Th17 cytokine production (biomarkers 5 of intracellular
  pathways of Trx1/CD30 target) and immunological deficit: Th17 expansion and Treg
  and Th1-cell functional deficit'
