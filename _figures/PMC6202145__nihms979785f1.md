caption: Structure of hRLX2, hypothetical pathway intermediates of RXFP1/2 and the
  benefits of hRLX2 therapy in radiation cystitis. A and B, The α-chain of hRLX2 can
  bind to RXFP1/2 receptors located on detrusor smooth muscle to increase cAMP levels
  and the expression of Cav1.2 (potentially via inhibition of RhoA activity) resulting
  in enhancement of force generation. hRLX2-mediated cAMP generation in the bladder
  vasculature may also increase Akt phosphorylation, platelet derived growth factor
  (PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression to promote angiogenesis.
  The β-chain of hRLX2 can interact with RXFP1 to selectively stimulate pERK1/2 pathways
  upregulating nNOS and cGMP levels. This leads to decreased collagen synthesis and
  tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (TIMP), and increased matrix metalloprotease
  (MMP) expression to reverse fibrosis in the ECM. C, One of the initial responses
  following radiation exposure is inflammation due to urothelial apoptosis and urine
  infiltration. Concurrently, there is damage to the vascular endothelium leading
  to ischemia. These processes cause increased collagen deposition, and decreased
  bladder compliance and force generation. Treatment with hRLX2 reverses fibrosis
  through inhibition of collagen synthesis and enhancement of its degradation by MMPs.
  It also enhances contractile function through increased Cav1.2 (ie, L-type Ca2+
  channel) expression and improved tissue perfusion via NO• induced vasodilation.
  hRLX2 is also anti-inflammatory, inhibiting recurrent damage to the bladder wall
