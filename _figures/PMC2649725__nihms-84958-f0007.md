caption: Model showing the activation of the JNK pathway upon challenge by UVB. Upon
  UVB irradiation, ROCK1 is activated and recruits and phosphorylates JIP-3. Phosphorylated
  JIP-3 (P* denotes phosphorylation) triggers the phosphorylation and activation of
  JNK. Activated JNK causes the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and
  stimulates the intrinsic cell death pathway. Activated JNK also phosphorylates γ-H2AX,
  which is essential for apoptosis to occur.

  description: Model showing the activation of the JNK pathway upon challenge by UVB.
    Upon UVB irradiation, ROCK1 is activated and recruits and phosphorylates JIP-3.
    Phosphorylated JIP-3 (P* denotes phosphorylation) triggers the phosphorylation
    and activation of JNK. Activated JNK causes the release of cytochrome c from the
    mitochondria and stimulates the intrinsic cell death pathway. Activated JNK also
    phosphorylates γ-H2AX, which is essential for apoptosis to occur.
