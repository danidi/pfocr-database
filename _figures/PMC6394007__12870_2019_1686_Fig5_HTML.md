caption: 'Module for ABA signaling pathway in osmotic stress responses of Z. xanthoxylum
  roots. a Functional network based on known Arabidopsis ABA-dependent signaling components,
  cross-referenced against the complete DEG functional network. Node colors represent
  different classes of signaling components: orange, ABA biosynthesis; red, receptors;
  yellow-green, PP2Cs, green, kinases; dark magenta, transporters; magenta, transcription
  factors; and blue, UPS enzymes. Border colors of nodes represent expression as log2
  fold-change. Magenta, increased expression; the deeper the color, the higher the
  expression. Green, decreased expression; the deeper the color, the lower the expression.
  Edge (line) colors, interactions of proteins in the core ABA signaling pathway (red),
  kinases (green), UPS enzymes (blue), transcription factors (magenta), and proteins
  except in the same class (cyan). Thickness of edges, normalized link closeness;
  the thicker the edge, the closer the link. b ABA signaling and biosynthetic pathway
  components. Shading, colors represent different classes of signaling components:
  orange, ABA biosynthesis; red, receptors; yellow-green, PP2Cs, green, kinases; dark
  magenta, transporters; magenta, transcription factors; and blue, UPS enzymes'
