caption: Figure 1A. Involvement of Rac in NADPH oxidase activation and superoxide
  production and cell migration. Inactive GDP and RhoGDP inhibitor(RhoGDI)-bound Rac
  is located in the cytoplasm. Activation signals mediated by formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine
  (fMLP) binding to its G-coupled receptor, results in dissociation of RhoGDI from
  Rac and subsequent cycling of Rac to the GTP-bound, active form. Together with p40phox,
  p47phox and the p67phox subunit, activated Rac translocates to the cell or phagosomal
  membrane to form the active NADPH oxidase complex together with the membrane-bound
  proteins large glycosylated protein (gp91phox) and the smaller adaptor protein p22phox.
  Subsequent electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen via flavin adenine dinucleotide
  (FAD) leads to formation of superoxide (O2-) radicals. It is postulated that phosphorylation
  of p47phox and p67phox is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) and that PKC is also
  involved in phosphorylation and dissociation of RhoGDI from Rac and thus regulates
  Rac activation. Activated, GTP-bound Rac also regulates cytoskeleton reorganization
  via downstream mediators of interaction with F-actin. Lack of Rac therefore disrupts
  formation of the phagocytic oxidase complex and inhibits migration in phagocytes.
  (Figure adapted from).Figure 1B. Involvement of RhoH in T cell receptor signaling.
  The T cell receptor (TCR) complex consists of TCR chains, CD3 and ξ-chain accessory
  molecules and the co-receptor CD4 or CD8. RhoH is required for phosphorylation of
  Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (Zap70) and CD3ξ and recruitment of Zap70
  and lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) to the immunological synapse.
  Thus, in the absence of RhoH the subsequent downstream events including phosphorylation
  of IL2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) and complex formation mediated by the linker
  for activation of T cells (LAT) and SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76
  kDa (SLP76) are disrupted. Phosphorylated ITK normally also activates phospholipase
  C (PLC) which then induces generation of phosphor-inositol-triphosphate (PtdIns)
  regulating calcium (Ca2+) flux and diacylglycerol (DAG) that activates members of
  the protein kinase C and RAS guanyl-releasing protein family. These proteins regulate
  activation of mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK) such as JUN amino-terminal
  kinase, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1 and other effectors involved in
  regulation of gene transcription. Following TCR activation cytoskeleton modifications
  are also mediated by two downstream pathways that are organized by the LAT-SLP76
  complex and thus defective in the absence of RhoH. One pathway depends on degranulation
  promoting adaptor protein (ADAP), which controls T cell adhesion to the antigen-presenting
  cell (APC) by up-regulating leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1) integrin
  avidity and the other pathway involves Cdc42, the tyrosine phosphorylated guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor Vav1, which activates Rac GTPases and controls actin
  polymerization and TCR clustering through Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)
  and the actin nucleating actin related protein (ARP)-complex. Thus, lack of RhoH
  results in defective TCR signaling, migration and adhesion. Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein
  kinase (Fyn), non-catalytic region of tyrosine kinase adaptor protein 1 (Nck), Grb2-like
  adaptor protein (GADS), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), Ras guanine
  nucleotide exchange protein Son of sevenless (Sos), Phosphoinositid-3-Kinase (PI3K)
  . (Figure adapted from).Figure 1C. Impaired recruitment of Lck to the immunological
  synapse in Rhoh−/− T cells. CD8+ T cells from wt or Rhoh−/− p14 TCR transgenic mice
  were conjugated with gp33 peptide-preloaded APC cells (CH.B2 cells) for 5 min. Cells
  were fixed and stained with anti-Zap70 (green) and anti-Lck (red). The localization
  of the immune synapse is indicated with a white arrow. T cell-APC conjugates were
  fixed and stained with TRITC-Phalloidin for detection of F-actin. Differential interference
  contrast (DIC) images show the antigen-specific T cell-APC conjugates. In the absence
  of RhoH localization of Zap70 and LCK to the immunological synapse is impaired,
  which indicates that RhoH is required for activation and recruitment of Zap70 and
  Lck to the immunological synapse. (Figure from).
