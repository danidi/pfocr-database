caption: GC upregulates miR-103 expression by direct binding of activated GR to a
  GRE sequence in the promoter of its host gene PANK3. miR-103 inhibits CDK2 and Cyclin
  E1 translation thus reducing cellular proliferation. In addition, miR-103 inhibits
  c-Myb and/or DVL1 by binding to their 3′UTR. c-Myb downregulation results with c-Myc
  transcription inhibition, whereas DVL1 downregulation results with β-Catenin degradation
  and transcription inhibition of c-Myc. c-Myc ablation is followed by downregulation
  of miR-18a and miR-20a. As miR-18a inhibits GR translation, expression of GR is
  upregulated. GR accumulation accelerates the response to GC and further elevates
  miR-103 in a positive feedback pathway. miR-20a inhibits BIM translation and, therefore,
  miR-103-induced miR-20a downregulation is followed by BIM upregulation. Pro-apoptotic
  BIM activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by it inhibitory interaction with
  Bcl-2 proteins, which is followed by BAK and BAK oligomerization, release of cytochrom
  C and SMAC/Diablo, thus leading to GCIA [].
