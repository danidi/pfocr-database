caption: The regulatory protein GacA controls ARs synthesis by two different pathways,
  one dependent on the Rsm system, that regulates the expression of the transcriptional
  activator ArpR, and a second pathway that positively controls expression of the
  ars biosynthetic genes independently of these regulators. Dashed lines indicate
  unknown intermediates or unknown mechanism of regulation.
