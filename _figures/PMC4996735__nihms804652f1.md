caption: The studies are for the endogenous production of H2O2. H2O2 produced by Nox2
  can activate Src kinases [] and cause inactivation of PTP1B through glutathionylation
  []. Together the activation of a Src kinase and inactivation of PTP1B cause ERK
  activation []. H2O2 produced by Nox2 is also used to oxidize thioredoxin, which
  allows activation of the ASK1 to JNK pathway. Stimulation of Nox2 also leads to
  H2O2-dependent NF-κB activation []. H2O2 produced by redox cycling of quinones activates
  Nrf2 and Phase 2 gene expression []. Silica activates Nox2 generation of H2O2 that
  is then used in the Fenton reaction to initiate localized lipid peroxidation that
  results in lipid raft disruption, activation of PC-PLC, and NF-κB-dependent cytokine
  production.
