caption: APP bound to the cell surface is primarily processed by the α-secretase favoring
  the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Endocytosis of APP to the endosomal/lysosomal compartments
  results in increased β-secretase mediated cleavage and enhanced Aβ-production. The
  fast internalization rate of LRP1 facilitates APP endocytosis and its processing
  to Aβ. By contrast, LRP1B and Apoer2 endocytose slowly, which results in a longer
  residence time of APP at the cell surface promoting non-amyloidogenic processing.
  Apoer2 is associated with caveolae shifting APP from membrane non-raft to raft domains
  and thereby facilitating processing by β-secretase. SorLa prevents β-secretase access
  to APP and subsequent Aβ production by intracellularly shuttling APP to the Golgi
  compartment.
