caption: 'Mechanisms involved in the tendon stem/progenitor cells during the process
  of diabetic tendinopathy. High glucose inhibits the expression of the tenogenic
  genes collagen I (Col I), scleraxis (Scx), and tenomodulin (Tnmd) in tendon stem/progenitor
  cells (TSPCs), indicating the suppressed tenogenic differentiation. Moreover, diabetic
  TSPCs exhibit increased osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation abilities and
  decreased tenogenic differentiation ability with increased expression of osteochondrogenic
  markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone morphogenetic protein 2, osteocalcin, osteopontin,
  Col II, and SOX9 and reduced expression of tenogenic genes Col I, Scx, and Tnmd.
  Insulin interacts with insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor to promote osteogenic
  differentiation of TSPCs by activating the expression of ALP, OSN, and runt-related
  transcription factor 2. These findings reveal that the erroneous differentiation
  of TSPCs plays important roles in the development and progression of diabetic tendinopathy.
  High glucose upregulates the expression of COX2 and downregulates the expression
  of FPR1, ChemR23, and ALOX15 in TSPCs, suggesting that high glucose stimulates an
  inflammatory response and weakens the pro-resolving responses, which results in
  persistent chronic inflammation in diabetic tendons. Advanced glycation end-products
  (AGEs) increase the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9, suggesting
  an increase in TSPC apoptosis induced by AGEs. AGEs elevate the ratio of LC3B/LC3A
  and decrease P62 expression, indicating AGEs-induced autophagy. Autophagy plays
  protective roles against the AGE-induced apoptosis. AGEs also induced the TSPC senescence,
  with elevated expression of P53 and P21. Pioglitazone could decrease AGE-induced
  apoptosis by stimulating autophagy via activating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. AGEs: Advanced
  glycation end-products; RAGE: Receptor for AGEs; HIF1α: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α;
