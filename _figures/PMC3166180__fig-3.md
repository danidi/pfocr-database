caption: Zn2+-dependent signaling in neuronal cell death. Central to Zn2+-dependent
  neuronal cell death are roles for mitochondria and oxidative stress. Free Zn2+ can
  be taken up by mitochondria leading to changes in mitochondrial potential (ΔΨm),
  release of ROS and pro-apoptotic proteins, and induction of mitochondrial swelling
  (). These effects on mitochondria could also be produced after oxidant-induced liberation
  of intracellular Zn2+ (). Several downstream neuronal cell death signaling pathways
  have been shown to be Zn2+-dependent. Oxidant- or microglia-induced Zn2+ liberation
  triggers 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) activity, resulting in p38-dependent enhancement
  of K+ efflux through newly inserted Kv2.1 channels. Alternatively, Zn2+-coordinated
  activation of 12-LOX and protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibition of MAP kinase phosphatase
  can trigger a necrotic cell death pathway involving extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, NADPH-oxidase activation, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase
  (PARP-1) cleavage. In addition, Zn2+ has also been shown to be critical for p75-NTR-mediated
  apoptosis and has recently shown to inhibit K+/Cl− co-transporter 2 (KCC2) after
  oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). (To see this illustration in color the reader
