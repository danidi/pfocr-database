caption: Model of caspase activation and apoptosis in Drosophila. In living cells,
  caspases are inhibited by forming complexes with DIAP1 protein. In response to various
  apoptotic stimuli, the binding of Reaper, Grim, and HID to DIAP1-(pro)caspase complexes
  leads to caspase activation. Reaper and Grim, but not Hid, appear to specifically
  activate DCP-1, perhaps through directly binding to DIAP1–DCP-1 complexes. In addition,
  the Ras/MAPK pathway inhibits the function of HID, but not Reaper or Grim. The caspase
  that is activated by HID, caspase X, remains unknown. Likewise, details of the presumptive
  proteolytic cascade(s) that may result from the activation of an apical caspase
  remain to be determined.
