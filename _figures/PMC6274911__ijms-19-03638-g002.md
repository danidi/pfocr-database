caption: 'Schematic diagram of TGF-β signaling in palatal fusion. In the Smad-dependent
  signaling pathway, TGF-β initiates signaling by assembling receptor complexes that
  activate Smad transcription factors []. Initially, the ligand (TGF-β1, TGF-β2 or
  TGF-β3) induces downstream signaling by binding to TβR2 []. Upon the TβR2-TGF-β
  complex formation, TβR2 is phosphorylated and activated by TβR3 []. TβR1 is subsequently
  recruited to the complex and activated by TβR2-mediated phosphorylation in TβR1
  GS region (a GSGS sequence) []. Through being bound by TGF-β ligands, TβR3 promotes
  complex formation and activates downstream signaling. Then receptor-associated Smads
  (Smad2/3; R-Smads) are specifically phosphorylated by TβR1 []. This phosphorylation
  induces dissociation of R-Smads from the receptor complex, thereby allowing them
  to associate with Smad4 and undergo translocation to the nucleus to mediate activation
  or repression of TGF-β target genes [,,]. Alternatively, TGF-β can also activate
  non-Smad signaling pathways, including MAPK pathways (such as the ERK, TAK1, p38,
  and JNK), PI3K signaling, and RhoA-ROCK signaling []. Activation of these pathways
  has been identified under certain physiological and pathological conditions [,].
  During the palatal fusion process, Smad2 is preferentially activated in the Smad-dependent
  pathway [,,]. Among the non-Smad pathways, the TAK1-p38 axis is reported to activate
  Stat3 transcription to promote the EMT process []. PI3K signaling activation is
  also critical for palatal fusion as a downstream target of both Smad and non-Smad
  pathways [,]. Image modified from Reference []. TAK1: Transforming Growth Factor
