caption: BMP receptors phosphorylate receptor-SMADs upon ligand binding. SMAD6 is
  a member of the inhibitory-SMAD family that prevents nuclear translocation of activated
  SMAD4/receptor-SMAD complexes. TCF12 and TWIST1 are basic helix-loop-helix transcription
  factors that heterodimerize and inhibit transcription downstream of BMP signaling.
  The co-occurrence of loss-of-function mutations in two master regulators of this
  signaling pathway that can cause craniosynostosis independently was predicted to
  result in severely impaired inhibition of BMP/SMAD signaling and excessive osteogenic
  drive
