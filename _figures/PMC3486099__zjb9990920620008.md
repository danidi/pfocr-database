caption: Model for the regulation of mutacin production in S. mutans UA159. Competence-stimulating
  peptide (CSP) is translated as a prepro-CSP (i). During secretion through the ABC
  transporter, NlmTE, the leader peptide, is cleaved to generate the 21-residue-long
  pro-CSP (iia). A cell surface Lon-like protease, SepM, then cleaves the C-terminal
  three amino acids of the pro-CSP to generate the functional matured 18-residue CSP
  (iib). When the 18-residue CSP reaches a certain threshold concentration, it activates
  the ComDE two-component signal transduction pathway. The activated ComE response
  regulator further stimulates the expression of mutacin-encoding genes (such as nlmAB
  or nlmC) by binding to the direct repeats present in the upstream promoter region
  (iii). Mutacins are also translated as prepeptides and secreted through the same
  ABC transporter, NlmTE, that also removes the leader sequence.
