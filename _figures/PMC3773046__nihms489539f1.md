caption: '(A) This diagram summarizes known links between inducers (nutrients and
  stresses), signaling pathways, transcription factors (TFs), cellular processes vital
  of CLS, and GO terms enriched in the myriocin-responsive gene set. Activation, inhibition
  and repression are not indicated in order to emphasize linkage relationships. Details
  about signaling pathways can be found in a review (). TFs are ones with known roles
  in longevity and were selected from those predicted to control expression of myriocin-responsive
  genes (). Shown in red (up-regulated genes) or green-shaded boxes (down-regulated
  genes) at the bottom of the Figure are enriched GO terms which support inclusion
  of the indicated signaling pathways, transcription factors and cellular processes.
  Abbreviations: HAP, Hap2/3/4/5 complex; NDP, nitrogen discrimination pathway; AA
  syn, amino acid biosynthesis.'
