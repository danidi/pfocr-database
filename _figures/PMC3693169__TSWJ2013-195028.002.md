caption: Glycolytic phenotype cancer cell may be treated by DCA (up to now the only
  known drug capable of restoring normal function of cancer cells). (a) The pyruvate
  pathway into the mitochondrial matrix space is blocked. PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase)
  enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix (the grey area) phosphorylated by kinase PDK
  are dysfunctional, and pyruvate is not transferred to be broken down into the two-carbon
  acetyl groups on acetyl CoA (Coenzyme A). (b) DCA inhibits activity of PDK. Function
  of PDH enzymes is restored, and the pyruvate pathway in mitochondria is open (after
  []). The cell needs sufficient amount of oxygen for normal function.
