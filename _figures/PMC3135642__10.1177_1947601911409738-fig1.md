caption: Regulation of metabolism by p53 in proliferating cells. p53 induces TP53-induced
  glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), hexokinase, inhibits phosphoglycerate
  mutase (PGM), and represses glucose transporter 1 and 4 (GLUT1 and GLUT4), resulting
  in inhibition of glycolysis and opposing the Warburg effect that is seen in many
  cancers. Oxidative phosphorylation is enhanced by p53 induction of synthesis of
  cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) and glutaminase 2 (GLS2). p53 can also regulate the
  glycolytic pathway through IKK/NF-κB signaling.
