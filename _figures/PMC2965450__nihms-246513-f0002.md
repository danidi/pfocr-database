  Subtilis. Two critical feedback loops control levels of the master transcriptional
  regulator ComK: a positive auto-regulatory loop (purple) and a ComS-mediated triple-negative
  (net negative) feedback loop (). This architecture defines an excitatory circuit:
  stochastic fluctuation in ComK levels can cause the basal state of the circuit (which
  specifies sporulation) to transition to an unstable, excitatory state (which specifies
  competence) by triggering positive feedback loop activation. Competence switching
  is controlled by the positive feedback loop, while return to the basal state is
  mediated by the negative loop. Results from rewiring experiments support this model.
  In one case, bypassing the negative feedback loop resulted in cells that switched
  to irreversibly to competence. The addition of negative feedback regulationresulted
  in faster recovery from competence back to the basal state as well as lower cell-to-cell
  variability in switching times. (c) The MAP kinase pathway that mediates mating
  in yeast displays a graded, linear response with respect to input in both dose and
  time regimes, while other MAP kinase pathways in other organisms or cells show distinct
  dynamical behaviors. The scaffold protein Ste5 specifies mating pathway connectivity
  by coordinating the kinase cascade. In Bashor et al. (), positive and negative pathway
  modulators were recruited to the scaffold using synthetic protein-protein interaction
  domains in order to up- and down-regulate pathway activity. When placed under the
  control of pathway responsive promoters, positive and negative feedback loops can
  be engineered. By using competitive interactions to create a sink for modulator
  binding, or to create competitive, reciprocal recruitment of modulator to the scaffold,
  a number of different types of complex input/output behaviors were achieved, including
  adaptive and activation-delayed temporal profiles, as well converting the dose-response
  profile for the circuit from a graded to switch-like. Thus this single platform
  can be used to generate many of the diverse behaviors observed within the greater
  MAPK cascade family.'
