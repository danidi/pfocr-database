caption: Cellular and signaling pathway view of gene expression changes during alcohol
  withdrawal. (A) Network layout of processes and molecules of interest. The 139 genes
  measured are represented as light gray squares and are grouped according to functional
  class. Relative positioning is maintained as in . (B) –ΔΔCT values were superimposed
  on the map presented in A with the color and size scale presented for all 65 genes
  found to have a statistically significant treatment effect by ANOVA regardless of
  whether the post hoc testing revealed significant changes at any individual time
  point. Small black points are included for positioning and represent the genes that
  did not show significant changes (NS). All –ΔΔCT values were calculated relative
  to the mean expression in sacrifice-time matched control animals. Values of 1 and
  –1 represent doubling and a halving of mRNA levels, respectively. The heavy black
  arrow indicates the progression of alcohol withdrawal from the chronic state through
  48 hours of withdrawal at each of the 5 measured time points. Size changes are proportional
  to the absolute value of the –ΔΔCT changes. Positive values (red) indicate an increase
  in expression as compared to control animals, whereas negative values (blue) indicate
  a decrease.
