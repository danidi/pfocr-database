caption: Molecular interactions and outside versus inside cell identity. Outer and
  inner cells are generated during two waves of a/symmetric divisions between 8‐ and
  32‐cell stage. This is followed by cell specification to either TE or ICM, involving
  cell‐specific regulatory molecular networks. In the outside cells, the key for TE
  development is the activity of transcription factors such as Cdx2, Gata3 and Eomes.
  Moreover, a positive feedback loop between Cdx2 and cell polarity (aPKC, Par6, Par3)
  ensures stable TE epithelium formation. In addition, asymmetric contact patterns
  inactivate the Hippo signalling pathway (Lats) leading to zygotic Cdx2 up‐regulation
  and maintenance of TE identity. In the inside cells, interplay between pluripotency‐related
  factors, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, promotes the ICM fate. Cell pluripotency is also
  strengthened in response to Cdx2 inactivation due to antagonistic interaction between
  Oct4 and Cdx2, as well as activation of the Hippo signalling pathway
