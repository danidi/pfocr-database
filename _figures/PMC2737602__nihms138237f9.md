caption: At the left side of the panel, P. gingivalis W83 (injected in the bottom
  of mandibular anterior vestibule) stimulate TLR2 expressed by hitherto uncharacterized
  resident sentinel cells (e.g., gingival epithelial cells, macrophages, mast cells).
  This innate recognition response translates into secretion of chemokines/cytokines,
  which then rapidly amplify inflammation through the activation of neutrophils/endothelium.
  Owing to increased vascular permeability, plasma proteins extravasate, leading to
  the accumulation of blood-borne kininogens in extravascular tissues (center of panel).
  Further downstream, the cysteine protease gingipain proteolytically liberates the
  vasoactive kinin moiety from kininogens. Plasma leakage is fueled through reiterative
  cycles of B2R-dependent triggering of the endothelium by the vasoactive kinins.
  Based on analysis of the immunological roles of kinins released by T. cruzi (, ,
  ), we hypothesize that immature (myeloid) DCs patrolling the inflamed mucosa (see
  rectangle) are activated via the kinin/B2R pathway. After migrating to submandibular
  draining lymph nodes, the fimbriae-bearing DCs prime naïve T cells, while at the
  same time instructing their development into IFN-γ-producing effector T cells (in
  Balb/C and C57BL/6 mice) and IL-17-producing T cells (Balb/C mice).
