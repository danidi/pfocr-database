caption: Mutation rates of Wnt pathway components in selected cancer entities. Percentage
  of cancer patients with mutations of selected canonical Wnt pathway related genes.
  Information was retrieved from the ICGC data portal (accessed 5/2016). The frequency
  of exonic mutations was determined based on cases with single nucleotide variant
  data in the MELA-AU, SKCA-BR, SKCM-US, PACA-US, PACA-CA, COAD-US, COCA-CN, READ-US,
  BRCA-UK and BRCA-US studies.
