caption: Figure 1. The differential modes of STAT3 activation and its genomic and
  nongenomic functions in responsive cells. (A) The IL-6/IL-6R complex induces dimerization
  of the common cytokine receptor subunit, gp130 leading the sequential activation
  of JAK2 and STAT3. (B) OSM binds gp130 and signals through LIF receptor (LIFR)/gp130
  heterodimers, or through OSM receptor (OSMR)/gp130 heterodimers to activate JAK2-STAT3.
  (C) Ligand-activated EGFR forms a molecular complex with STAT3, leading to its activation.
  (D) FN adhesion induces formation of integrin-EGFR complexes and subsequent EGFR-dependent
  STAT3 activation. (E) FN-induced cell adhesion is also associated with STAT3 activation
  via an integrin:Pyk2:JAK2 molecular complex that functions independent of EGFR.
  (F and G) Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 dimers undergo nuclear translocation (F)
  where they regulate several “master” EMT transcriptional networks (G). (H) Various
  miRs discussed in the text either restrict (−) or enhance (+) STAT3 signaling and
  EMT programs by targeting molecules associated with distinct aspects of the STAT3
  pathway. (I) SOCS3 inhibits STAT3 signaling via blockade of upstream signaling through
  interactions with gp130 and JAK family members. (J) Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3
  can localize to focal adhesions where it interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
  and paxillin, and also regulates the phosphorylation status of the adaptor protein
  p130Cas. (K) Cytosolic STAT3 also promotes microtubule polymerization by sequestering
  the microtubule-destabilizing factor stathmin.
