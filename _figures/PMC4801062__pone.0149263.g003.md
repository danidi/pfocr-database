caption: (a) Predefined Galaxy workflow for creation of kinetic models from BioPAX
  files. BioPAX files are used by many pathway databases to describe pathways and
  qualitative relations of molecules. BioPAX2SBML is used to convert the BioPAX encoded
  pathway to a draft SBML model. SBMLsqueezer infers reaction equations and kinetic
  rate laws for the relations defined in the resulting SBML model. SBML2LaTeX creates
  a human-readable report for model inspection to facilitate interpretation and curation.
  (b) Subnetwork of the SBML model of the ceramide signaling pathway. This network
  represents a small part of the full ceramide signaling pathway that is involved
  in creation and degradation of ceramide. This network contains four reversible reactions
  (dark gray squares) and 13 reactants. The black arrows indicate the participation
  of reactants in reactions. Blue lines indicate enzymatic behavior of reactants.
  The reaction highlighted in red degrades ceramide to sphingosine and fatty acid
  and is catalyzed by Platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGFA). This network
  was created with CySBML [] from the draft SBML model generated by SBMLsqueezer.
  For the full model see . (c) Reaction equation for ceramide degradation. SBML2LaTeX
  creates reaction equations for all reactions in the PDF report. This reaction degrades
  ceramide to sphingosine and fatty acid and is catalyzed by PDGFA. The reaction is
  also part of the subnetwork shown in (b) and is highlighted in red.
