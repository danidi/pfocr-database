caption: Hypothetical representation of the carotenogenic complex in X. dendrorhous
  (left) and a recombinant strain overexpressing the phytoene desaturase (CrtI)-encoding
  gene (right). Increased levels of a carotenogenic enzyme might alter the sequence
  of reactions. In the β-carotene-accumulating strain PR-1-104, the astaxanthin synthetase
  (Ast) enzyme is inactive or absent (above dotted line). The main carotenoids under
  each specific condition are indicated in boxes. *, the 3,4-didehydro ends of torulene
  and HDCO are not substrates for lycopene cyclase (CrtYB) and astaxanthin synthetase
  (Ast), respectively. The number and stoichiometry of enzymes are speculative and
  based on the number of different enzymatic steps. CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase.
