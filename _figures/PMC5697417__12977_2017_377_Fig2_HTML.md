caption: IFITM proteins are involved in various cellular processes with direct and
  indirect impacts on immunity. Virus restriction; In the event of successful virus
  invasion, nucleic acid sensors including RIG-I and MDA5 are triggered and IRF transcription
  factors are activated to induce the production of type-I interferons, which, in
  turn, initiate transcription of IFITM genes and other interferon-stimulated genes.
  IFITM proteins restrict the cytosolic access of virions undergoing endocytosis,
  possibly via inhibition of virus-cell fusion and destruction in an endolysosomal
  pathway. Cytokine regulation; IFITM3 is a negative regulator of the interferon response
  because it accelerates the turnover of IRF3 in autophagosomes. It also suppresses
  the production of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine which, itself, can also induce
  the expression of IFITM genes. IFITM2, in contrast, promotes the upregulation of
  IL-6 by acting as a cell surface receptor for secreted BAG3. As BAG3 is also a well-characterized
  chaperone for selective autophagy, it will be of interest to determine if IFITM2
  also participates with BAG3 in autophagy-related processes. Cell migration and invasion;
  IFITM3 is a central component of a multi-protein interaction involving Src, FAK,
  and Ambra1, which is important for regulating cell adhesion and movement. IFITM3
  assists in the subcellular trafficking of Src between focal adhesion points and
  autophagosomes. Cell growth, proliferation, and cell cycle regulation; Interferon
  signaling is known to negatively regulate cell division and growth via STAT signaling,
  with IFITM proteins serving as downstream effectors. IFITM1 interacts with caveolin-1
  (CAV-1) to inhibit ERK/MAPK signaling, a pathway which stimulates cell proliferation
  when active. IFITM1 also stabilizes p53, a tumor suppressor with anti-proliferative
  functions
