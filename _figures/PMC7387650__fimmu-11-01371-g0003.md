caption: Regulation on the suppressive nature of MDSCs by subset composition and the
  tumor microenvironment. Differential suppressive capacity and mechanism(s) between
  PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs influence the suppression by MDSCs as a whole population (left).
  In peripheral lymphoid organs where PMN-MDSCs predominate, suppression by MDSCs
  is mainly antigen-specific, since the activity of PMN-MDSCs depends largely on reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and peroxynitrite (PNT). In tumor where the proportion of M-MDSCs
  increases, suppression is more potent and is both antigen-specific and non-specific,
  since M-MDSCs are more suppressive and mainly rely on arginase 1 (ARG1), nitric
  oxide (NO), and immunosuppressive cytokines. A network of cytokines, hostile physical
  conditions, and cells in the tumor microenvironment regulates MDSCs in multiple
  aspects (right). Soluble mediators derived from tumor regulate the suppressive activity
  of MDSCs and also drive their development. After being taken by MDSCs, the contents
  of tumor-derived exosomes, which act as intercellular messengers, promote the expansion
  and potentiate the suppressive capacity of MDSCs. Like tumor cells, MDSCs undergo
  metabolic reprogramming to adapt to varying surroundings. Hypoxia-inducible factor
  1α (HIF-1α) induced by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway enhances
  glycolysis and may potentiate suppression by MDSCs, whereas glycolysis has also
  been reported to be a negative regulator. The heightened fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
  is associated with upregulated ARG1 and increased NO and PNT production. Hypoxic
  signaling, primarily through HIF-1α, is another central regulator. HIF-1α promotes
  many non-immunological activities of MDSCs, including differentiation, pro-angiogenesis,
  and pro-metastasis. HIF-1α augments MDSC-mediated suppression by upregulating several
  effector molecules. The hostile conditions in the tumor milieu, such as oxidative
  stress, nutrient deprivation, and acidic waste accumulation, causes ER stress and
  induce unfolded protein response (UPR) in MDSCs. ER stress response marker C/EBP
  homologous protein (CHOP) regulates ARG1, superoxide, and PNT production by MDSCs.
  The bidirectional communication with stromal cells fine-tunes the induction, homeostasis,
  differentiation, and suppressive function of MDSCs. Bregs, regulator B cells; CAFs,
  cancer-associated fibroblasts; DCs, dendritic cells; iNOS, nitric oxide synthase;
  LOX-1, lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor-1; NK, natural killer; PD-L1, programmed
  cell death-ligand 1; Tregs, regulatory T cells.
