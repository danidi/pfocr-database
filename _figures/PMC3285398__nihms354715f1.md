caption: Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) recognize specialized structural motifs on the
  microbes known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The cellular distribution
  of TLRs represents the site of their encounter with the pathogens – TLRs which recognize
  cell wall moieties (TLR-2,-4, -5) are present on the cell-membrane whereas TLRs
  which recognize nucleic-acids (TLR3, -7, -8, -9) are localized in the endosomal
  compartment. TLR1, -6 signal through heterodimerization with TLR2 and thereby localized
  on the cell membrane. Upon ligand binding, the cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)
  domain of the TLRs associate with TIR domain of the adaptor proteins MyD88, TIRAP,
  TRIF and TRAM. MyD88 is required for signaling by all TLRs except TLR3 which together
  with TLR4 signal through TRIF dependent-MyD88 independent pathway. TLR4 is unique
  in that it utilizes all the four adaptor proteins for signaling. The use of alternative
  adaptors provides specificity to the TLR signaling pathway. Further MyD88 recruits
  IRAK4 and IRAK1 molecules to the TLR signaling complex through interaction with
  their death domains (DD). This leads to the activation of TRAF6 which further activates
  several effector molecules such as transcription factors NF-κB, IRF3 and MAP kinases
  like p38, ERK1/2 and JNK. Downstream signaling events by these molecules regulate
  the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
