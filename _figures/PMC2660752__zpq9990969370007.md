caption: 'Comparison of C1 assimilation pathways in isocitrate lyase-negative (ICL−;
  A), proposed from this study, and positive (ICL+; B) serine cycle methylotrophs.
  Note than CO2 is derived from methanol, and therefore the overall carbon balance
  is the same in the 2 organisms: 3 methanol→1 C3.'
