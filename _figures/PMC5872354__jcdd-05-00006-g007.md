caption: Schematic of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling. Binding of an
  active TGF-β ligand initiates the co-localization of the type II (TβR-II) and type
  I (TβR-I) TGF-β receptors. The TβR-II remains constitutively phosphorylated and
  when co-localized phosphorylates the Ser/Thr kinase domain (KD) of the TβR-I. The
  intracellular signal is subsequently transmitted by phosphorylation of Smad proteins,
  primarily Smad2/3 in cardiovascular tissues. The phosphorylated Smad proteins combine
  with Smad4, a common Smad, to form a heterotrimeric complex that can then be shuttled
  through the nuclear membrane ultimately acting as a transcription factor for inflammatory,
  synthetic, and growth-promoting genes. The cyclic GMP/PKG system is known to inhibit
  this pathway by sequestering p-Smad in the cytosol, in turn not allowing it to be
  shuttled into the nucleus and affect gene transcription.
