caption: The Par complex, composed of an atypical PKC family member, the Par-3 scaffold,
  the cdc42-binding Par-6, and cdc42 phosphorylates a number of downstream polarity
  proteins, including LKB1, the MARK family, and Lethal giant larvae (LGL). LKB1 also
  requires a signal from E-cadherin to be recruited and competent to phosphorylate
  AMPK at the adherens junction. LKB1-dependent AMPK activation is known to modulate
  the phosphorylation state of myosin light chain (MLC) in Drosophila mutants, which
  may be through indirect regulation of the kinase (MLCK) and phosphatase (MYPT1)
  for MLC. LKB1-dependent MARK kinases in turn phosphorylate the Par-3 scaffold, hence
  leading to the mutual exclusion of the Par complex and the MARK kinases within the
  cell. MARKs also are well-established to phosphorylate MAPs including tau, MAP2,
  and MAP4, and have been reported to phosphorylate DLG and Dishevelled (DVL) proteins
  in some contexts.
