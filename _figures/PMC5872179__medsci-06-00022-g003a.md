caption: 'Bioenergetics of macrophage subsets. Monocyte-derived macrophages can be
  differentially polarized by the cytokine milieu [,]. (A) M1 macrophages originate
  from cells in the bone marrow and develop in inflammatory environments. Nitric oxide
  (NO) is the major byproduct of these cells arising from the reaction of arginine
  with oxygen through the actions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which
  produces citrulline and NO (see detailed pathway C). Citrulline is then exported
  and re-imported to re-generate arginine and sustain NO production. A product of
  the degradation of arginine through this cycle is fumarate which is derived from
  the conversion of argininosuccinate to arginine (see C). M1 macrophages are also
  critical for the production of cytokines and chemokines and for the production of
  itaconate which acts as an anti-microbial cellular metabolite. Succinate, a proinflammatory
  molecule that controls IL-1β expression, accumulates and stabilizes the oxygen sensing
  pathway regulated by hyposia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) [,]. (B) Unlike M1
  macrophages, the polarized M2 subtype reduces their ability to make NO and instead
  hydrolyzes imported arginine into ornithine and urea through the urea cycle (detailes
  in C). M2 macrophages are therefore suppressive by competing for both arginine and
  glutamine that is necessary for effector T-cell functions [,,]. To fuel their functions,
  including proliferation, M2 macrophages use fatty acids oxidation (FAO) which supports
  oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport through the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle. Also present in the suppressive tumor microenvironment is a population
  of bone marrow derived immature myeloid cells known as myeloid derived suppressor
  cells [,]. While bioenergetics for these cells needs further analysis, they retain
  NO production and FAO, TCA and deplete arginine and glutamine [] from the microenvironment.
  (C) Also detailed is the metabolism of arginine, l-citrulline and l-ornithine to
  produce fumarate from conversion of argininosuccinate. Citrulline plus aspartate
  generates argininosuccinate via the actions of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS)
  in the cytosol and ornithine is converted to citrulline by carbamylphosphate plus
  ornithine via the enzymatic activity of ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC). Additional
  enzymes and reactions include those metabolized by ODC: ornithinine decarboxylase,
  ARG: arginase 1 or arginase 2, ADC: arginine decarboxylase which is the biosynthetic
  enzyme for agmatate [], OAT: ornithine aminotransferase, NOS: nitric oxide synthase,
  PRMT: protein arginine methyltransferases which is important for epigenetic regulation
  [], and AGAT: l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase which is the enzyme that catalyzes
  the transfer of an amidino group from l-arginine to produce l-ornithine and guanidinoacetate
  and acts as the immediate precursor of creatine.'
