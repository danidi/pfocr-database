caption: Autophagy regulators and functions associated with anti-aging effects. Different
  cellular components can be degraded by either non-selective or selective autophagy.

  Upon autophagy initiation, a phagophore is formed and expanded, thereby producing
  an autophagosome. The matured phagosome fuses with the lysosome, initiating degradation

  important role in the DNA damage response and the nuclear-associated genes, TFEB
  and FOXO, play important roles in regulating autophagy. (D) Defective mitochondria

  mitochondria can be degraded by the PINK1-Parkin pathway, which is ubiquitin-dependent.
  In cells with healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is continuously degraded, while Parkin
  is in the cytoplasm. Upon stress, PINK1 is stabilized on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, where it phosphorylates ubiquitin and E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Once
  Parkin is recruited to the mitochondria, it then ubiquitinates some of the outer
  membrane mitochondrial proteins. These polyubiquitin K63-linked chains are phosphorylated,
  creating a degradative signal for autophagy. Receptor proteins involved in this
  pathway include NDP52 and TAX1BP1. These proteins recognize phosphorylated polyubiquitin
  chains and link damaged mitochondria to LC3-II. Another mechanism for mitochondrial
  degradation involves receptor-mediated autophagy by BNIP3, NIX and FUNDC1. These
