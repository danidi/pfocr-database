caption: A summary of the synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin
  in relation to the observed effects on this pathway following UV-irradiation of
  vitamin D3-deficient female and male mice. Post-UVR changes in 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3
  levels are depicted by arrows with no change shown as (−).
