caption: 'Control of differentiation and 37°C growth by a bifurcated Ca2+signaling
  pathway. Both the Ca2+-bound and the Ca2+-free forms of calmodulin govern cellular
  morphology and 37°C growth in C. neoformans. Ca2+-bound calmodulin functions via
  the activation of calcineurin, and Ca2+-free calmodulin functions via targets that
  remain to be determined, which may include Myo2. Abbreviation: CaM, calmodulin.'
