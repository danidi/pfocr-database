caption: Insulin signalling exerts rapid stimulation of glucose transport as well
  as fatty acid uptake, synthesis and esterification to triacylglycerol (TG). (a)
  Stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by insulin leads to inhibition of AS160 and
  GLUT4 translocation. Glucose is converted to glycerol 3-phosphaate and fatty acids.
  (b) Insulin-stimulated Akt may inhibit AMPK by phosphorylation. This in turn would
  lead to dephosphorylation and activation of ACC, increasing malonyl CoA production
  and de novo lipogenesis. (c) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are reported to activate
  AMPK, which then phosphorylates and inhibits FAS. Insulin treatment decreases the
  inhibition of FAS induced by ROS. (d) Insulin increases fatty acid uptake by stimulating
  the translocation of FATP1 from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane mediated
  by PI3K or the MAPK pathway. (e) Insulin increases fatty acid uptake by stimulating
  LPL levels and activity through PI3K. (f) Insulin triacylglycerol synthesis or retention
  in adipocytes can be altered through regulation of lipid droplet protein S3-12 redistribution
  or FSP27 levels

    (a) Stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by insulin leads to inhibition of AS160

    acids. (b) Insulin-stimulated Akt may inhibit AMPK by phosphorylation. This in

    treatment decreases the inhibition of FAS induced by ROS. (d) Insulin increases
    fatty acid uptake by stimulating the translocation of FATP1 from intracellular
    vesicles to the plasma membrane mediated by PI3K or the MAPK pathway. (e) Insulin
    increases fatty acid uptake by stimulating LPL levels and activity through PI3K.
    (f) Insulin triacylglycerol synthesis or retention in adipocytes can be altered
    through regulation of lipid droplet protein S3-12 redistribution or FSP27 levels
