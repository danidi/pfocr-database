caption: Major signaling pathways regulating RSV-induced NF-κB and IRF activation
  in airway epithelial cells. Infection of airway epithelial cells with RSV triggers
  a multitude of signaling pathways, some of which have been shown to be redox sensitive.
  For lack of space, only the pathways leading to the redox-sensitive transcription
  factors NF-κB and IRF are illustrated. Production of specific RNA moieties during
  viral replication leads to activation of the RIG-I-MAVs pathway, which subsequently
  activates the IKK complex, which is upstream NF-κB activation and of the TBK1/IKKɛ
  complex, which regulates IRF-3 activation. Activation of these pathways has been
  shown to be affected by antioxidant treatment in the context of RSV infection. IRF,
  interferon regulatory factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; IKK, IκB kinase.
