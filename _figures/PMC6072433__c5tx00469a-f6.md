caption: . Summary of molecular pathways affected by APAP treatment (5 mg APAP per
  mg cellular protein for 48 h) observed using label free proteomics and SNO/SOH TMT.
  Detoxification of NAPQI leads to depletion of GSH and accumulation of endogenous
  RNS and ROS that contribute to generation of modified proteins. In response, cells
  activate pathways that lead to decreased protein synthesis and increased production
  of reducing power via the pentose phosphate pathway.
