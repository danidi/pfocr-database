caption: Illustrative diagram showing the possible intervention/therapeutic effects
  on endometriosis through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP). Endometriosis
  can induce pain and infertility, which can cause stress and depression, which, in
  turn, can lead to the activation of the HPA/SAM axes, resulting in increased release
  of catecholamines such as noradrenaline. The increased noradrenaline levels may
  induce the suppression of the DRD2 signaling pathway, the activation of the adrenergic
  receptor β2 (ADRB2), and the subsequent activation of the ADRB2/CREB/PKA signaling
  pathway, leading to increased angiogenesis and cellular proliferation, and thus
  lesional progression. Endometriotic lesions and inflammation are mutually stimulatory,
  and inflammation may also activate nociceptors such as TRPV1, facilitating pain
  sensation. The CAIP can be activated either by VNS or by α7nAChR agonists, leading
  to suppression, abrogation or attenuation of depression, pain, and inflammation,
  thereby achieving the therapeutic results.
