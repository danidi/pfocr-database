caption: 'Activation of cutaneous and/or circulating T cells by fungal antigens could
  induce a Th2-dominant response leading to elaboration of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-5. The
  first 2 cytokines can lead to two pivotal effects: Synthesis of IgE by B cells and
  endothelial activation leading to eosinophil recruitment by a vascular cell adhesion
  molecule (VCAM)-very late activating antigen 4 (VLA-4) adhesion molecule pathway.
  Both IgE and eosinophils play a prominent role in atopic disease. IgE in the presence
  of antigen can cross-link mast cells leading to further cytokine, chemokine and
  mediator production. The other cytokine, IL-5, enhances eosinophil production from
  the bone marrow, eosinophil activation, survival, recruitment and degranulation.
  These processes can result in expression of atopic disease, from rhinitis and asthma
  to atopic dermatitis.'
