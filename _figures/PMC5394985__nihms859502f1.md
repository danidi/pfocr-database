caption: Naïve CD4 T cells differentiate into IL-17 producing T cells under the cytokine
  environment including TGF-β, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-23. Th17 differentiation is controlled
  by transcription factors including RORA, RORC and STAT3. Type 3 innate lymphoid
  cell (ILC3) and γδ-T cell can also produce IL-17 in respond to IL-1β and IL-23 stimulation.
  IL-17A acts on structural cells such as epithelial cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes
  in various tissue including skin, gut as well as lung. Structural cells that express
  IL-17 receptor produce inflammatory cytokines such as G-CSF and IL-6 as well as
  chemokines to attract neutrophils and macrophage to the inflamed tissues. These
  inflammatory cells can both clear the infection and initiate pathogenic inflammation.
