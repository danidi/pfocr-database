caption: 'Right side: In the regulated pathway, activation of β-adrenergic receptors
  leads to cAMP production and activation of a phosphatase which dephosphorylates
  plasma membrane Mct1, and caveolin-1 (hairpin structures), facilitating an interaction
  between Mct1 and caveolin-1 to promote internalization of Mct1 into caveolae (CAV)
  and early endosomes (EE). From here Mct1 could be trafficked to various compartments
  such as late endosomes and lysosomes (LE/LYS), similar to the protein-kinase dependent
  trafficking of kainite receptors and aquaporins (; ). Left side: In the constitutive
  pathway, Mct1 is internalized into clathrin coated vesicles (CCV) where it is trafficked
  to recycling endosomes (RE) for redistribution on the plasma membrane, however,
  adrenergic signaling does not affect this trafficking pathway.'
