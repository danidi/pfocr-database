caption: Interaction network of lysine-succinylated proteins in D. officinale. The
  lysine-succinylated proteins in the top four clusters are shown in red, light purple,
  cyan and yellow, respectively. Red indicates cluster ‘Glycolysis’, light purple
  indicates cluster ‘TCA Cycle’, cyan indicates cluster ‘Oxidative Phosphorylation’,
  yellow indicates cluster ‘Ribosome’ and blue indicates other lysine-succinylated
  proteins in D. officinale
