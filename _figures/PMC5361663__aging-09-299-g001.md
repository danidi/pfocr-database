caption: A schematic model depicting the hypothetical role of ERK5 (red bars) in the
  cellular response to unrepaired DNA damage in VDJ recombination in thymocytes. NHEJ,
  non-homologous end-joining pathway of DSB repair. HR, homologous recombination.
  gH2AX, phosphorylated H2AX. ATM-RAG, indicates the cooperation between both proteins
  to stabilize the DSB. The bars indicate inhibitory function.
