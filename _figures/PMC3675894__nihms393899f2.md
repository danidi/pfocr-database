caption: Summary of association of genetic alterations of the HH pathway and cancer
  type. In the case of SHH and IHH is by overexpression without any reported mutations,
  for PTC1 and SU(FU) the defect is deficiency or loss-of-function mutations, for
  SMO is gain-of-function mutations and for GLI is gene amplification.
