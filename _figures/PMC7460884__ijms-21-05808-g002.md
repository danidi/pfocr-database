caption: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cholesterol homeostatic machinery. Membrane-bound
  sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) precursors are retained in the
  ER through a tight association with the SREBP escort protein SCAP and the ER-resident
  protein INSIG. When ER cholesterol levels fall below a critical threshold level,
  SCAP dissociates from INSIG and mediates the COPII-dependent transport of SREBP
  precursor to the Golgi. Mature SREBP transcription factors are released by Golgi-resident
  proteases, and subsequently translocate to the nucleus where they activate genes
  involved in cholesterol uptake and de novo cholesterol synthesis. Excess-free cholesterol
  is stored in lipid droplets (LD) as acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-generated
  cholesteryl esters. Negative SREBP feedback control and ACAT activity are both impaired
  in cells with reduced NPC1 and NPC2 function as well as following treatment with
  U18666A, a drug that phenocopies NPC by a direct interaction with the sterol-binding
  domain in NPC1. Ectopic RIDα expression is sufficient to restore ACAT activity,
  but not sterol regulation of SREBP, associated with reduced NPC1 function and U18666A
  treatment.
