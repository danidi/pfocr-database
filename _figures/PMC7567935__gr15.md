caption: Pre-treatment of rats with melatonin (10 mg/kg bw) prior to ISO treatment
  (25 mg/kg bw) prevented occurrence of myocardial infarction and averted mitochondrial
  dysfunction caused by ISO mediated oxidative stress. Melatonin prevented ISO induced
  changes in mitochondrial LPO, PCO, GSH,GPX,GR, Kreb's cycle enzyme activity along
  with preventing the release of inflammatory cytokines thereby checking mitochondrial
  oxidative stress. Melatonin was also shown to inhibit ISO induced oxidative stress
  mediated increase in NFκβ by stimulating SIRT1 release which in turn activated the
  downstream cascade of PGC 1α and SIRT3 signalling. Activated or upregulated SIRT3
  signals MnSOD production which ultimately was shown to improve the GSH/GSSG ratio
  which could effectively prevent mitochondrial oxidative stress to prevent cell death
  and necrosis. Activation of PGC 1α and SIRT3 is also known to prevent mitochondrial
  dysfunction and furthermore upregulation of PGC 1α promotes mitochondrial biogenesis.
  The red arrows indicate the effect of ISO treatment alone and the green arrows indicate
  the effect of melatonin pretreatment before ISO treatment.
