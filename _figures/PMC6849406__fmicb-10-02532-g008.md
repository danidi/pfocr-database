caption: Requirement of DedA family and PMF for efficient synthesis of Ara4N-lipid
  A. The Arn operon produces undecaprenyl-P-Ara4N that is found initially in the cytoplasmic
  leaflet of the inner membrane. The EmrE-like transporters ArnEF catalyze the transbilayer
  movement of undecaprenyl-P-Ara4N to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane
  () where it is a substrate of the glycosyltransferase ArnT (; ). ArnT modifies lipid
  A with Ara4N on the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane, followed by transport
  to the outer membrane by the lipopolysaccharide transport pathway (Lpt) (; ) contributing
  to colistin resistance. Undecaprenyl-P produced is recycled to the cytoplasm possibly
  by UppP/BacA, the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase, which bears similarity
  to MdfA and other transporters (; ). Both MdfA () and EmrE () are proton-dependent
  transporters suggesting that the PMF may be required for both the transbilayer movement
  of undecaprenyl-P-Ara4N and the recycling of undecaprenyl-P. Perturbation of the
  PMF in DedA family mutants may interfere with either or both of these steps. We
  have shown that DedA family proteins are likely proton-dependent transporters and
  efflux of MdfA and EmrE substrates is compromised in the E. coli DedA family mutant
  BC202, resulting in hypersensitivity to these compounds (, ).
