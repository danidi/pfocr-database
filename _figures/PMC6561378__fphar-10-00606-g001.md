caption: The mechanism of anti-hOrai1 channel monoclonal antibody (mAb) action on
  the human T-cell. mAb binds to the Orai1 extracellular domain and induces either
  internalization, which may lead to the channel recycling, or it completes degradation
  via the autophagy pathway. On the other hand, the inhibition of Ora1 channel was
  demonstrated by decrease in calcium flux. This decrease in calcium flux will affect
  Ca2+-calmodulin binding, leading to the inhibition of calcium-dependent phosphatase
  calcineurin. Dephosphorylation of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) is
  a required event for its translocation to the nucleus and activation of gene transcription
  regulated by NFAT. In both cases, i.e., inhibition or internalization of Orai1,
  this binding of antibody provokes the impairment of Orai1-mediated signaling, leading
  to the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and activation, and cytokine production
  as well.
