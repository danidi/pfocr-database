caption: The first step of heme synthesis occurs in the mitochondrial matrix with
  the condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine by ALAS to generate ALA. ALA may be
  exported in exchange for glycine by an IM transporter SLC25A38. The mechanism of
  ALA export across the OM into the cytoplasm is unknown. ALA is converted to CPgenIII
  by four enzymatic reactions. CPgenIII is then transported back into the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space (IMS), possibly via ABCB6, where it is converted to PPgenIX
  by CPO. The conversion of PPgenIX to PPIX by PPO, its transport into the matrix
  and the addition of Fe+2 by ferrochelatase (FECH) to generate heme are coupled processes,
  with transport of PPIX likely occurring via a proposed direct channeling through
  a complex of PPO-FECH (likely part of a larger complex with the mitochondrial iron
  importer, Mitoferrin, ABCB7 and ABCB10). The transfer of heme from the matrix to
  the IMS, for respiratory chain cytochrome assembly, may be mediated by ABCB10; the
  transporter responsible for its transfer across the outer mitochondrial membrane
  remains unidentified. See text for details.
