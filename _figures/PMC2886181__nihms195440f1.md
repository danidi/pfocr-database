caption: The mevalonate- (MVA-) pathway is a crucial metabolic pathway in almost all
  eukaryotic cells, which converts mevalonate into cholesterol. It is most recognized
  for the biosynthesis of cholesterol, while it provides the cell with further indispensable
  substrates, such as squalene and the isoprenoids farnesyl- (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate
  (GGPP). Initial steps of the MVA-isoprenoid pathway involve the synthesis of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-
  coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) from acetyl-CoA by acetoacetyl-CoA. Subsequently, the HMG-CoA
  reductase forms mevalonate. Subsequently, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is formed,
  which equilibrates with its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). IPP or DMAPP
  then undergo subsequent condensation reactions to produce GPP, FPP and GGPP. The
  synthesis of GPP and FPP is catalyzed by the farnesylpyrophosphate synthase (FPPS)
  and the geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), respectively. FPP and GGPP
  are substrates for post-translational prenylation of the small GTPases by the farnesyltransferase
  (FTase) and the geranylgeranyltransferases (GGTase), respectively. In general, prenylation
  of these proteins assists in proper localization in internal cell membranes as well
  as in their correct function. After isoprenylation, the CaaX motif containing proteins
  undergo two further sequential enzymatic reactions. Upon the enzymatic attachment
  of the isoprenoid, the diphosphate is cleaved off and endoproteases remove the terminal
  three amino acids (-aaX). Upon cleavage of the terminal tripepetide, the remaining
  prenylated cysteine residue undergoes carboxymethylation by a methyl group, delivered
  from S-adenosyl methionine. The enzymatic conversion is catalyzed by the isoprenylcysteine
  carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt). Moreover, FPP and GGPP serve as precursors for
  longer chain isoprenoids like dolichol or ubiquinone. FPP is the branching point
  of the pathway leading to squalene catalyzed by the farnesyldiphosphate farnesyltransferase
  (FDFT). Two subsequent enzymatic reactions result in the production of lanosterol,
  which basically represents the structure of all steroids. Subsequent reactions lead
  to production of desmosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol and finally to cholesterol.
