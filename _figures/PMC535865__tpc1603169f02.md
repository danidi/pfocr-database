caption: A Simplified Model Depicting the Induction of Ethylene Biosynthesis and the
  Downstream Ethylene Sensing/Signaling Pathway.Ethylene biosynthesis is induced in
  response to a variety of endogenous and environmental cues. One of the early responses
  after the sensing of these cues is the induction of ethylene, which is achieved
  via upregulation of ACS activity, the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first
  committed step of ethylene biosynthesis. Members in the two major subgroups of the
  ACS family, represented by ACS5 and ACS6, are regulated by different kinase pathways.
  Phosphorylation stabilizes ACS6 (and possibly ACS5), and interaction of ACS5 with
  ETO1 (and perhaps other unknown components) targets ACS5 for degradation by the
  proteasome. Fine-tuning of ethylene induction is achieved by tissue-specific expression,
  gene activation, and the formation of heterodimers between different ACS members.
  ACC oxidase (ACO) activity can also affect levels of ethylene induction. Ethylene
  gas is perceived by a family of ER-associated receptors (ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2,
  and EIN4). CTR1, a negative regulator of downstream responses, is proposed to be
  activated by the unoccupied receptors via physical interaction and is inhibited
  upon binding of ethylene by the receptor. CTR1 may function through unidentified
  MAPKK(s) and MAPK(s). Downstream components in the ethylene pathway include several
  positive regulators (EIN2, EIN5, EIN6, and EIN3). In the absence of ethylene, EIN3
  protein is targeted for degradation by an SCF complex containing one of the two
  F-box proteins, EBF1 and EBF2. In the presence of ethylene, EIN3 accumulates in
  the nucleus and activates gene expression, which eventually leads to ethylene-induced
  responses. Liu and Zhang present strong evidence that lands the MPK6 MAPK module
  in the pathway regulating ACS6 activity—upstream of ethylene biosynthesis in response
  to stress.
