caption: Bile acid-activated S1P2 signaling. Tauro-conjugated bile acids stimulates
  sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2), a Gαi protein-coupled receptor, which
  activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and AKT pathways.
  S1P2 signaling activates the insulin receptor/AKT pathway through activation of
  Src and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) leading to activation of the insulin
  receptor (IR), which phosphorylates and activates insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1).
  IRS-1 phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositol 4′, 5′ bis-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3′, 4′, 5′-trisphosphate
  (PIP3). PIP3 then ohosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1) to phosphorylate
  and activate AKT (also know as PKB). Phosphorylated AKT phosphorylates and inactivates
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and resulting in dephosphorylation and activation
  of glycogen synthase (GS), a key enzyme in glycogenesis. AKT also phosphorylates
  and inactivates a transcription factor, FoxO1 and resulted in inhibiting phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in gluconeogenesis. S1P2
  signaling also may activate FXR/SHP pathway to inhibit peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor αγ (PPARα/γ)/PGC-1α-mediated fatty acid oxidation and steroid response
  element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c)-mediated fatty acid synthesis. Therefore,
  SiP2 signaling may reduce serum glucose and triglycerides, and improve insulin sensitivity
  by stimulating glycogensis and inhibiting gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis.
