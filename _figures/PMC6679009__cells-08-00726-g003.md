caption: Circadian clock genes. The clock consists of a stimulatory circle, with the
  Bmal1/Clock heterodimer activating the transcription of Per and Cry genes, and an
  inhibitory feedback circle with the Per/Cry heterodimer translocating to the nucleus
  and repressing the transcription of the Clock and Bmal1 genes. An additional circle
  involves the RORs and RevErbs factors with a positive feedback by ROR and a negative
  feedback by RevErbs.
