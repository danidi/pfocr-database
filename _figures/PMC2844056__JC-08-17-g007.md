caption: Pathway analysis of genes involved in cell-cell signaling significantly associated
  with ERbreast cancer cells in response to AA. This cascade was down regulated in
  ER− cells only. Cells were treated with AA at 6 and 24 hrs. RNA was isolated and
  hybridized on the cDNA microarray slides as detailed in materials and methods. Images
  were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 and data were analyzed using GeneSpring 10.1
