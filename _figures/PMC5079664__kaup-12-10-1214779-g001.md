caption: CDK4-CDK6 protect DNMT1 from autophagy. The effect of CDK4-CDK6 on DNMT1
  levels can be inhibited by palbociclib or the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1.
  The model predicts that a phosphatase can also target DNMT1 for autophagy and that
  an autophagy receptor able to link DNMT1 to the phagophore (the autophagosome precursor)
  would be involved. Inhibition of CDK4-CDK6 and targeting of DNMT1 for autophagy
  allow changes in epigenetic marks, which facilitate the induction of the senescence
  program in tumor cells. The senescence program itself involves an increase in the
  autophagy pathway generating a potential positive feedback mechanism to reinforce
  senescence.
