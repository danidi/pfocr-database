caption: 'The AMPK pathway activation and energy homeostasis. Under energy stress,
  AMPK is phosphorylated at Thr 172 by LKB1 in response to variations in AMP: ADP/ATP
  ratios. Other upstream kinases such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase
  2 (CAMKK2) activated by intracellular calcium and transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase (TAK1) represent alternative AMPK activation forms. In this context, AMPK-activated
  can repress anabolic processes and increase catabolism to restore energy balance.
  AMPK suppresses the ATP-consuming anabolic pathways by direct phosphorylation and
  inhibition of several proteins: mTORC1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), SREBP (sterol
  response coactivator), HMGCoA reductase (HMGCR), which play critical roles in protein,
  fatty acid, sterol, and cholesterol synthesis, respectively. AMPK prevents glycogen
  storage by inhibitory phosphorylation of the glycogen synthases (GYS1 and GYS2).
  In addition, AMPK also stimulates the catabolic pathways to produce ATP by several
  mechanisms. First, increasing glucose utilization by phosphorylation and inactivation
  of domain family member 1 (TBC1D1) and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP),
  which control the translocation of glucose transporters GLUT4 and GLUT1 to the plasmatic
  membrane, respectively. Second, AMPK increases glucose flux along the glycolytic
  pathway by PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3) phosphorylation,
  which affects the PFK1 activity, a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. AMPK indirectly
  stimulates fatty acids transport into the mitochondria by ACC2 inhibition, in turn
  promoting fatty oxidation. On the other hand, AMPK induces autophagy directly by
  ULK1 phosphorylation, a kinase essential for autophagy, and indirectly by mTORC1
  inactivation. The arrows indicate: →, activation signals; ┴, inhibition signals.'
