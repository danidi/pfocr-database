caption: Until recently, the exact mechanism of 5-aza induced cardiomyogenesis was
  largely unknown and attributed to demethylation, and subsequent activation, of an
  unknown cardiac-related gene. However, a study by Cho et al in 2009 revealed that
  the upregulation in cardiomyocyte specific genes following 5-aza delivery resulted
  from the induced demethylation of CpG islands in the promoter of the glycogen synthase
  kinase (GSK)-3 gene, a major player in the Wnt signaling pathway []. Methylation
  of CpG sequences in a gene promoter has been postulated to play a role in silencing
  that gene. This study saw a time dependent increase in both GSK-3 isoforms, GSK-3α
  and GSK-3β , in response to 5-aza treatment. Genetically modified overexpression
  of GSK-3β resulted in a similar upregulation of cardiomyocyte specific genes in
  the absence of 5-aza. Furthermore, GSK-3β is known for phosphorylation of β-catenin,
  which leads to its eventual ubiquitinylated proteolytic degradation. This downregulation
  of β-catenin, either by 5-aza induced upregulation of GSK-3β or specific knockdown
  using silencing RNA, results in the apparent cardiomyogenesis of MSCs (). Conversely,
  this study also saw chondrogenesis of the MSCs in response to β-catenin upregulation.
  These results suggest that the differentiation of MSCs could be induced by controlling
  elements of the Wnt signaling pathway further downstream from where 5-aza acts.
  However, the Wnt pathway has extensive applications within the body and the specific
  transcription factors bound to β-catenin as it localizes to the nucleus to inhibit
  cardiomyogenic gene expression remain unknown. Thus, further studies are still required
  to fully define and control the chemically-defined cardiomyogenic pathway.
