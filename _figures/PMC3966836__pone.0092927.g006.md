caption: 'S100A7 stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis by up-regulating PGC-1α signaling
  pathway. S100A7 down-regulates autophagy but promotes inflammation. The mechanism
  of S100A7 attenuates HaCaT cells damage induced by LPS is mediated by mitochondrial
  homeostasis through biogenesis and degradation to increase mitochondrial function.
