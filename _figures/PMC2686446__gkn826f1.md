caption: 'Screen print of pyrimidine metabolism compared between Plasmodium falciparum
  and Cryptosporidium parvum from the metaTIGER site. The colouring scheme is described
  at the top of the image as found on the webpage. Only enzymes with profile match
  E-values <10–10 are included. The six-enzyme de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway
  is shown in the top left image and contains the enzymes 6.3.5.5, 2.1.3.2, 3.5.2.3,
  1.3.3.1, 2.4.2.10 and 4.1.1.23. Five of the enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis
  pathway are coloured yellow indicating that they are only found in P. falciparum,
  the sixth enzyme (6.3.5.5) is not coloured yellow as its E-value was 1.9 × 10–6
  which is greater than the E-value cut-off used. Of the four pyrimidine salvage enzymes
  three (2.7.1.21, 2.7.1.48 and 2.4.2.9) are shown in orange as they are only found
  in C. parvum and the fourth (1.5.1.3) in is not included in this KEGG pathway image.
  In the image the enzyme 2.4.2.3 forms part of a pyrimidine salvage pathway and is
  highlighted as being present in P. falciparum; however, this enzyme is known to
  only function in pyrimidine degradation in P. falciparum (,). (NB: enzymes labelled
  ‘not detectable’ are those for which PRIAM/SHARKhunt does not have a sequence profile).'
