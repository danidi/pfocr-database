caption: Proposed model of TβR signaling pathway in normal human keratinocytes and
  squamous carcinoma cells. In normal human keratinocytes (exemplified by HaCaT cells),
  TGFβ binds to the TβRII and activates the classic Smad2/3 pathway via TβRI (Alk-5).
  In addition, our studies indicate that TGFβ can activate BMP-Smads (Smad1 and Smad5)
  in a TβRI (Alk-5)-dependent manner. In analogy with endothelial cells, we assume
  that one of the BMP type I receptors is involved in this process (Alk-x), with Alk-2
  being the leading candidate. Moreover, one might speculate that the Smad2/3 arm
  of the signaling pathway mediates the homeostatic function of TGFβ, whereas the
  Smad1/5 arm is involved in the tissue injury response. In the case of some cancer-associated
  TβRII mutants (exemplified by TβRIIE526Q in SqCC/Y1 cells), both arms of the TGFβ/Smad
  pathway are abrogated. In contrast, in the case of TβRIIR537P-mutant A253 cells,
  the TβRII/Alk-5/Smad2/3 pathway is also abrogated, resulting in loss of TGFβ-mediated
  growth control. However, the Smad1/5 pathway is constitutively activated in an Alk-5-independent
  manner, apparently resulting in increased EMT, cell migration, and invasion. Thus,
  this type of mutant has a dual-function phenotype, associated with loss of one arm
  of the TGFβ/Smad pathway and activation of the second arm. Moreover, our studies
  indicate that this gain of function is inhibitable by the dual-receptor kinase inhibitor
  LY2109761, while it is resistant to selective TβRI kinase inhibitors.
