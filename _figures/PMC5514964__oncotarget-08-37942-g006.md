caption: Up-regulated PLK-1 inhibits the damage repair mechanism and releases the
  cells from G2/M arrest with damaged DNA. PLK-1 inhibits/degrades the various proteins
  that are associated either with the damage repair mechanism or with G2/M arrest,
  including Chk-2, p53, MYT1, WEE1, and claspin. PLK-1 also phosphorylates CDC25 to
  activate its’ phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated CDC25 activates the CDK-1-cyclin
  B1 complex to release the cell cycle from G2/M arrest with damaged DNA. b. In the
  HR repair pathway, PLK-1 phosphorylates RAD51 to activate BRCA1/2 for activating
  the repair pathways in a CK-II-dependent manner. Phosphorylated RAD51 interacts
  with NBS, and the RAD51-NBS complex is recruited to the damage site to repair the
  damage. Moreover, PLK-1 and CK-II-dependent phosphorylation blocks the G1/S transition
  and provides time for damage repair.
