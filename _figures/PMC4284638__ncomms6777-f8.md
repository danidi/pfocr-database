caption: The eight essential regulatory links of the β-AR signalling network are primarily
  responsible for the switching response of Bcl-2 (thin solid lines). Among these,
  the ERK1/2 and ICER-mediated incoherent feed-forward loop is the core regulatory
  circuit that robustly generates the Bcl-2 switching response of cardiomyocytes,
  in which the ERK1/2 pathway at a low concentration range of ISO positively regulates
  Bcl-2 induction and thus cell survival ensues, whereas the PKA-ICER-CREB pathway
  at a high concentration range negatively regulates Bcl-2 induction and therefore
  promotes cell death.
