caption: 'Functional interpretation of the IL-6 gene signature and its relationship
  to the three main downstream pathways of IL-6.Notes: The 17 genes are part of the
  Jak-STAT IL-6 downstream pathway. Members of the gene signature are represented
  by green boxes, and upstream pathway members are represented by white boxes.Abbreviations:
  IL-6, interleukin-6; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase; Akt, serine-threonine kinase; STAT3, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3; CEBPD, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein;
  MMP9, matrix metalloproteinase 9; TUBB3, β-tubulin isotype III; CFB, complement
  factor B; TMC-5, transmembrane channel-like protein 5; GBP2, guanylate binding protein
  2; AKR, aldoketone reductase; LCN2, lipocalin 2; IFITM, interferon-inducible transmembrane
  protein.'
