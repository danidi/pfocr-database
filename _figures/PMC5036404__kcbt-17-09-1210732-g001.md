caption: A schematic overview of the intrinsic and extrinsic arms of apoptotic signaling.
  The extrinsic portion can be activated by ligands binding their cell surface death
  receptors such as FASL binding FAS, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand (TRAIL) binding death receptor 5 (DR5) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)
  binding TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD) is recruited
  to the FASL-FAS or TRAIL-DR5 receptor complex as well as to the cytosolic complex
  IIa for activation of Caspase-8 in the context of FLIP inhibition and loss of cellular
  inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAPs). TNFR1–associated death domain protein (TRADD),
  receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) and TNFR2-associated factor-2 (TRAF2)
  are recruited to TNFα-bound TNFR1 forming the pro-survival complex I as a prerequisite
  to apoptotic signaling via this death receptor. K-63 and M-1 linked poly-ubiquitination
  of RIP 1 by cIAPs and LUBAC respectively, antagonised by the second mitochondria-derived
  activator of caspases (SMAC) and cylandromatosis (CYLD), stabilises complex I formation.
  This allows binding of the NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO) and transforming growth
  factor β-activated protein kinase (TAK) binding protein (TAB) to associate with
  RIP1 via the ubiquitin chains thus activating NF-κB and cell survival signaling.
  Pro-survival genes such as opa1, c-iaps, traf2, a20 and c-flip are transcribed in
  the nucleus. Intrinsic signaling requires removal of inhibition by BCL2 proteins
  as well as the activation of BAX and BAK and truncation of BID to tBID by active
  Caspase-8 for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP). This releases
  anti-apoptotic molecules such as SMAC and pro-apoptotic molecules, such as Cytochrome
  c. The apoptosome can then form by activated Caspase-9, apoptotic protease activating
  factor 1 (APAF1) and Cytochrome c and the 2 signaling arms culminate in executioner
  Caspase-3 and −7 activation for apoptosis. DNA damage results in autocrine TNFα
  signaling by activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase EDD, association with RIP1 and
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway signaling to transcription of TNFα.
