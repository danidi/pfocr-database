caption: LKB1-SIK2/3-class IIa HDAC pathway as a novel signaling module. A, schematic
  showing effects of the PKA-sensitive LKB1-SIK2/3 pathway on nucleocytoplasmic shuttling
  of class IIa HDACs. Although not illustrated here, HDAC phosphorylation and 14-3-3
  binding can also occur in the nucleus. Although HDAC4, -5, and -9 each contain three
  14-3-3-binding sites, HDAC7 possesses four; for simplicity, only three are shown
  here. The dotted line denote links that await formal demonstration or further investigation.
  B, schematic illustrating major targets downstream from LKB1 and the predominant
  physiological processes that they regulate. The 14 LKB1-activated kinases belong
  to several groups (, ) and lead to formation of different signaling branches downstream
  from LKB1. The AMPK branch has been most widely studied and plays a major role in
  metabolic control (, , ), but recent studies indicate that LKB1 regulates the hematopoietic
  stem cell compartment in an AMPK-independent manner (–), suggesting the importance
  of other groups. Downstream from the SIK group are three signaling axes, with the
  first two controlled by the CRTC2 and p300 transcriptional co-activators (–) and
  the third one being the SIK2/3-class IIa HDAC pathway characterized herein and in
  another study (). Although only MEF2 is illustrated here, other transcription factors
  may also interact with class IIa HDACs and are subject to regulation by the LKB1-SIK2/3
  axis. In addition, it remains to be investigated if this pathway regulates potential
  roles of class IIa HDACs in the cytoplasm. There is also evidence that LKB1 modulates
  cell polarity through amphid-defective (SAD) and microtubule-associated protein/microtubule
  affinity-regulation kinases (MARK) (, , ) and controls cell senescence () and adhesion
  () via NUAK1. CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein.
