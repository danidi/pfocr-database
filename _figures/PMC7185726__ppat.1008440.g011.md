caption: The figure shows the flea blockage rate for mutants lacking D-xylulose (ΔxylAB1),
  L-xylulose (ΔsgbK-sgbU), arabinose/D-ribulose (ΔaraAB), D- and L-xylulose and arabinose/D-ribulose
  (ΔaraD1 ΔaraD2 ΔxylB1 ΔxylB2) pathways with or without Rpe (ΔaraD1 ΔaraD2 ΔxylB1
  ΔxylB2 Δrpe), gluconate import (ΔidnK1 Δindk2 ΔkdgK) or use via the upper part of
  the pentose phosphate pathway (Δgnd), ΔtalB, Δrpe or ΔrpiA ΔrpiA2). Grey arrows
  indicate pathways that are not important for flea blockage. The other reactions
  are considered to be important for flea blockage because the mutant either (i) does
  not block fleas (Δrpe and ΔrpiA ΔrpiA2 mutants), (ii) was highly deficient for growth
  in vitro (ΔtktA) (see supplementary text) or (iii) could not be deleted (ΔprsA),
  presumably because it is essential (as reported for E. coli). The grey area encloses
  the enzyme reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway.
