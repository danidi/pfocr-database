caption: Figure 3. Model for ethylene signaling. Ethylene crosses the cell membranes
  presumably by passive diffusion and is perceived by receptors localized ER or Golgi
  (not shown in diagram). Two types of receptors, type-I and type-II, are present
  which are active and thus suppress the ethylene responses in the absence of the
  hormone. Binding of ethylene results in the inactivation of the type I receptors
  as well as the associated negative regulatory proteins, CTR1 and RTE1 (in Golgi,
  not shown in diagram). This activates a MAP kinase pathway which facilitates the
  ethylene response factors (ERFs) through the eventual activation of EIN3, EIL1.
