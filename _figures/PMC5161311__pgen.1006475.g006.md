caption: HGF/plasminogen-like protein SVH-1 is constitutively expressed in, and secreted
  from ADL sensory neurons in the head. Expression of SVH-2 is induced by axon injury.
  Following axon injury, DDR-2 accumulates at the severed end and is activated by
  EMB-9. DDR-2 facilitates the efficient activation of SVH-2 by SVH-1. Activated SVH-2
  phosphorylates MLK-1 MAPKKK at a tyrosine residue, creating a docking site for SHC-1.
  SHC-1 constitutively forms a complex with MEK-1 MAPKK, and thereby functions to
  connect MLK-1 and MEK-1. SHC-1 participates in restricting the SVH-1–SVH-2 signal
  to the MLK-1–MEK-1 pathway.
