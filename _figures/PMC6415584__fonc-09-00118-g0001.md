caption: Pyruvate and glutamate are 2 major metabolic hubs in GSCs. Tumor cells usually
  display a strong glycolytic metabolism. Glucose is uptaken by glucose transporter
  GLUT and then converted to pyruvate through several enzymes. All along this pathway,
  the glycolytic products are diverted from this main metabolic road to fuel other
  biosynthetic pathways such as the PPP as well as lipids and amino acids biosynthesis.
  PKM2 plays a key role in this dynamic process through conformational modulation.
  Glycolytic pyruvate will then either be converted to lactate or fuel mitochondrial
  OXPHOS and the TCA cycle. Another key metabolite that can fuel the TCA is glutamate
  once converted to αKG. Glutamate is produced either by GLS from glutamine or from
  glucose. Glutamate is involved in several biosynthetic pathways including amino
  acids and lipids biosynthesis as well as mitochondrial anaplerosis. Glutamate is
  also involved in glutathione synthesis, directly and indirectly by providing cysteine
  to the cells. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; FAS, Fatty acid synthase; FBP1, Fructose-1,6
