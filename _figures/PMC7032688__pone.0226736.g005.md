caption: Red color indicates Toll and Imd signaling pathway genes up-regulated in
  both TK♀×NJtet♂ (compare to TK♀) and NJ♀×TKtet♂ (compare to NJ♀) groups, pink color
  indicates up-regulated in TK♀×NJtet♂ but down-regulated in NJ♀×TKtet♂ group, orange
  color indicates up-regulated in NJ♀×TKtet♂ but down-regulated in TK♀×NJtet♂ group,
  green color indicates down-regulated in both TK♀×NJtet♂ and NJ♀×TKtet♂ groups, yellow
  color indicates up-regulated only in TK♀×NJtet group, blue color indicates down-regulated
  only in NJ♀×TKtet♂ group, white indicates unfound. The pathway was built with PathVisio
  software 3.3.0 based on the Toll and IMD Pathways of Drosophila melanogaster downloaded
  from wikipathways (WP3830_92694).
