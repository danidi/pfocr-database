caption: (A) Glucose inhibits PPARα-dependent ketogenesis and cellular adaptation
  programs required for tissue tolerance during LPS and Listeria-mediated (bacterial)
  inflammation. Ketones act as fuel source and as HDACi allowing for cellular and
  tissue adaptation. Inhibition of glucose utilization during bacterial inflammation
  with 2DG protects against tissue dysfunction and organismal mortality.(B) Glucose
  utilization is required for adaptation to Poly(I:C) and influenza mediated (viral)
  sepsis. Viral inflammation activates ER stress and the unfolded protein response
  (UPR) downstream of type I interferon signaling through IFNaR. Inhibition of glucose
  utilization in viral inflammation with 2DG enhances ER stress through a CHOP-dependent
  pathway leading to tissue dysfunction and death.
