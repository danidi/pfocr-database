caption: The straight-chain ester biosynthetic pathway from fatty acids. Apple sequences
  encoding enzymes involved in straight-chain ester biosynthesis were identified by
  BLASTx (e-05 cutoff) using the PIR NREF database (). Numbers in parentheses under
  ESTs refer to the number of apple NR sequences, singletons, TC sequences, and total
  number of ESTs, respectively.
