caption: Right side shows the MAPK pathway; left side shows the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway.
  The two classic signalling pathways are coupled to the receptor thyrosine kinase
  (RTK) at the cell membrane which transduces extracellular growth signals into intracellular
  signalling downstream of the two pathways. RAS can couple the signalling from RTK
  to both pathways. PTEN terminates the PI3K signalling. Genetic RTK amplifications
  are common. Common activating mutations in the MAPK pathway include RET-PTC rearrangement,
  RAS mutation, and BRAF mutation. Common genetic alterations in the PI3K pathway
  include RAS mutation, PTEN mutation or deletion, PIK3CA mutation or amplification,
  and AKT1 mutation. The two pathways, driven by these genetic alterations, have a
  fundamental role in thyroid tumorigenesis. Amplifications of RTK genes are also
  common. *Denotes therapeutic targets in the two pathways that are currently being
  actively tested clinically.
