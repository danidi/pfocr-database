caption: High levels of polyamines in macrophages treated with IL-4 increase the expression
  of genes encoding markers of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM), independently
  of Arg1 activity. Conversely, polyamines inhibit the expression of proinflammatory
  (pro-inflam.) genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages. How IL-4 increases polyamine
  synthesis by an ODC-dependent pathway (X), but independently of arginase activity,
  remains to be determined.
