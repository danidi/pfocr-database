caption: MiR-21, miR-126, and miR-148a directly or indirectly regulate DNMT1 in SLE
  CD4+ T cells.A. MiR-148a and miR-126 directly regulate DNMT1 validated experimentally.
  In particular, miR-148a binds to the DNMT1 coding sequence, as predicted by the
  program RNA22, while miR-126 binds to the 3'-UTR region of DNMT1, as predicted by
  the program Microcosm.B. DNMT1 is directly or indirectly regulated in SLE CD4+ T
  cells and it triggers the over-expression of autoimmune-associated methylation-sensitive
  genes involved in SLE. In normal human T cells, gene hypermethylation controlled
  by DNMT1 blocks the transcription activity of RNA pol II, thus silencing autoimmune-related
  methylation-sensitive genes such as CD70, LFA-1(CD11a) and EGFL7. In SLE CD4+ T
  cells, promoter hypomethylation allows binding of transcriptional factors (TF) and
  recruiting of RNA pol II (step 1). This leads to the overexpression of autoimmune-related
  genes, including EGFL7 (step 2). Interestingly, miR-126 is encoded in the 7th intron
  of EGFL7. Thus the expression of EGFL7 leads to elevated levels of miR-126, which
  downregulates the production of DNMT1 in a reciprocal negative feedback (amplification)
  loop (step 3). Low level of DNMT1 leads to the hypomethylation status which maintains
  the aberrant autoimmune response (step 4). Other miRNAs contributing to decreased
  DNMT1 activity are miR-148a, through direct inhibition, and miR-21 which indirectly
  regulates DNMT1, by targeting RASGRP1 in the Ras-MAPK pathway, and thus also influencing
  DNMT1 protein levels.DNMT1=DNA methyltransferase 1; TF= transcription factor; RNA
  pol II= RNA polymerase II; RASGRP1= RAS guanyl-releasing protein 1; bp= base pairs.
