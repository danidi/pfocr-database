caption: Plant metabolic pathways stemming from L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. Colour
  represents the abundance difference between the three most divergent Medicago (M.
  sativa (n = 6), M. littoralis (n = 6), M. orbicularis (n = 6)) and Trifolium species
  (T.pratense (n = 5), T. nigrescens (n = 6), T. repens (n = 7)) for the discrimination
  LD1 score (log(fold change) in the mean % TIC of the m/z bin putatively associated
  with the compound). The pathway is based on the M. truncatula pathway in the KEGG
  database (www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). Significance was tested by comparing
  the difference in the combined log %TIC between the Medicago and Trifolium groups
  using a linear regression model (using lm() function in R). Compounds underlined
  are those with putative m/z bins identified in RF models for both discrimination
  and overall acceptance.
