caption: 'E. histolytica interference with cell adhesion signalling may induce cell
  death. The scheme summarizes the levels at which E. histolytica may interfere with
  target cell integrin-mediated cell adhesion signalling, here LSEC. Several relevant
  virulence factors are presented: Gal/GalNAc lectin and KERP-1 []. Host cell receptors
  for both amoebic molecules remain to be identified. Amoebic β2-integrin like molecule
  (β2-like EhR) shown to bind to intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and -2 []
  whose expression is induced in activated endothelial cells. RGD motif containing
  proteins, like the ECM component fibronectin expressed by LSEC, may serve as binding
  sites for β1 integrin-like fibronectin receptor β1EhFNR which shares a high degree
  of homology with the intermediate Gal/GalNAc lectin subunits Igl1 and Igl2 ([] and
  references therein). Interaction may reinforce trophozoite adherence and eventually
  compete with integrins for RGD ligands, thus interfering with LSEC adhesion signalling.
  The immuno-dominant amoeba protein M17 [] may be involved in recognition of phosphatidyl-serine
  (PS) exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells, which are preferentially phagocytosed
  by amoebae. Pore-forming amoebapore proteins (AP) though involved in lysis of other
  host cells and ALA, are not essential for LSEC apoptosis and death. The calcium-binding
  proteins Grainin-1 and -2 (Gr) are found in secreted granules, but their potential
  role in LSEC killing has not been elucidated so far. Cysteine proteases, among which
  CP-A5, present at the trophozoite surface or released into the extracellular medium,
  are implicated in ECM degradation. The pro-form of CP-A5, localized in secreted
  and surface-bound fractions, contains a RGD sequence that confers to this protein
  a protease activity-independent additional function in adherence and host cell inflammatory
  response induction; binding to integrin αvβ3 from colonic enterocyte cells has been
  found [], potential receptors on LSEC are not characterized. Activation of vascular
  endothelial cell G-protein coupled receptors, like the protease-activated receptors
  (PAR), by pathogen-encoded CPs have been described for several microorganisms, including
  African trypanosome parasites. Anchorage-dependent survival of adherent cells relies
  on the activity of the integrin-mediated signal transduction pathway, regulating
  cell survival/death signalling activities and cytoskeleton organization. LSEC death
  results from abrogation of adhesion signalling leading to diminished adhesion, to
  inactivation of survival and to activity of cell death pathways. Loss of adhesion
  may in turn trigger apoptosis (anoikis). Elements intervening in E. histolytica
  contact-dependent apoptosis of LSEC were inferred from data obtained with the human
  lymphoma line Jurkat [–]. Upon contact with trophozoites, the protein tyrosine phosphorylation
  level rapidly decreases and the concentration of free intracellular calcium drastically
  rises. The initial trigger for both events remain yet unknown. Calcium-dependent
  activation of calpain in turn activates caspase-3 responsible for the execution
  of the apoptotic program. Calpain activity may also account for necrotic cell death
  and diminished protein phosphorylation levels, by cleavage-dependent activation
  of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B. Amoeba-induced activity of calpain, caspase-3
  and PTP1B and several other protein tyrosine phosphatases as well as increased calcium
  levels may negatively modulate integrin/FA pathway activity'
