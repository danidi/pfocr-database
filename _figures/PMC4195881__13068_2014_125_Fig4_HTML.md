caption: Proposed D-xylose metabolic pathway in the green microalga C. sorokiniana
  . D-xylose is transported across the cell membrane through the inducible hexose
  symporter. The uptake of D-xylose activates the expression of NADPH-linked XR and
  NADP + -linked XDH, which converts D-xylose to D-xylulose and enters the PPP pathway
  after catalyzing to D-xylulose 5-P. NADPH generated during the first stage of photosynthesis
  from light energy serves as the coenzyme for D-xylose metabolism. DCMU negatively
  affects the improvement of D-xylose catabolism from the light-dependent reaction
  by blocking electron flow from photosystem II (PSII) to photosystem I (PSI) and
  inhibiting NADPH production.
