number: Figure 1
caption: Feedback circuit between microRNAs and epigenetic machinery. The epigenetic
  modification, such as promoter CpG island hyper- or hypo-methylation and/or histone
  modifications, affect miRNAs and genes transcription. MiRNAs can themselves regulate
  the epigenetic machinery by post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), targeting
  DNMTs, HDACs, and the histone methyl-transferases (HMTs), establishing epigenetic
  pathway loops. In the figure, black lines represent the pathway starting from the
  epigenetic modifications and ending with the miRNAs maturation, while blue lines
  represent the pathway from the mature miRNA to the post transcriptional gene silencing
  of the epigenetic machinery.
