caption: 'Processes of liver fibrosis progression and regression during human hepatosplenic
  schistosomiasis. Profibrotic processes: Upon stimulation, by Schistosoma spp. eggs
  antigens, injured hepatocytes will release IL-33 as a danger alerting molecule.
  Moreover, schistosome eggs will drive, via cells such as Innate lymphoid cells,
  the release of IL-4. IL-33 and IL-4 will act on naïve T cells to promote Th2 differentiation.
  IL-33 will also induce through his receptor ST2 located on macrophages, the upregulation
  of the Hedgehog pathway which will then drive via osteopontin the alternative activation
  of macrophages (M2). The effect of IL-33 on endothelial cells will also promote
  angiogenesis which will increase the vascular permeability. With the support of
  TNF-α produced by Th1, Th2 cells will then produce large amount of type 2 cytokines
  (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) which will induce the activation of qHSCs. M2 differentiated
  under the flow of Th2-released type-2 cytokines can also foster the activation of
  qHSCs by releasing TGF- β1, VEGF or CTGF. While the two latter can directly stimulate
  the proliferation of aHSCs, TGF-β1 can act through the Hsp47. This action is sustaining
  by some chemokines especially (CCL3; MIF; CCL24 and sTNFR1). Moreover, necrotic
  hepatocytes might release High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein as an alarmin
  that will ultimately foster HSC activation. In the midst of advanced fibrosis, human
  livers might further release miRNAs that alter host metabolism, triggering HSC activation
  to promote tissue fibrosis. Altogether, proliferating aHSCs will produce a very
  large amount of collagen, which will accumulate and lead to fibrosis which can progress
  to cirrhosis and then ultimately to liver cancer. Anti-fibrotic processes: Three
  possibilities can account for regression of fibrosis: apoptosis; senescence or reversion
  of aHSCs to their quiescent stage. Upon stimulation, hepatic resident macrophages
  will produce IL- 12 which will drive the differentiation of Naïve T-cell to Th1.
  Th1 cells will release INF-ɤ which will classically activate macrophages (M1). Various
  regulatory T and/or myeloid cells are also known to produce IL-10 which can block
  the activation of qHSCs to consolidate an anti-fibrotic effect. This action is further
  supported by the large amount of INF-ɤ produced by Th1 although balanced by the
  level of secreted TNF-α. aHSCs might return to the quiescent/senescent state under
  the action of IL-6; CCL5 or INF-ɤ or undergo apoptosis depending on how strong the
  profibrotic signal was. INF-ɤ can also activate MMPs to digest the deposited collagen
  and this action is reinforced by estrogen in women. IL, Interleukin; HSCs, Hepatic
