caption: Hub-pathway network of GSZD. The pathway enrichment analysis showed that
  the hubs, identified from the interaction network of putative targets of GSZD and
  known RA-related targets, were more frequently implicated into T/B cell receptor
  signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Osteoclast differentiation,
  NF-kappa B signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway,
  VEGF signaling pathway and Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, which all play
  crucial roles in the main pathological events during the RA progression, such as
  inflammation, synovial pannus formation, inflammatory cell infiltration, angiogenesis,
  joint destruction and pain. Yellow nodes refer to the putative targets of GSZD;
  Blue nodes refer to the known RA-related targets; Green nodes refer to other human
  genes interacted with the putative targets of GSZD or the known RA-related targets
