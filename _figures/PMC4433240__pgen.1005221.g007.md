caption: Tetraspanins TSP-21, TSP-12 and TSP-14 (collectively TSPs) interact with
  each other to organize membranes into microdomains that are enriched in glycosphingolipids
  (GSLs). Via interacting with the type I receptor SMA-6, the tetraspanins may recruit
  the receptors or the ligand-receptor complex (DBL-1/BMP, SMA-6/RI, DAF-4/RII) and
  their associated modulators (DRAG-1/RGM, UNC-40/neogenin and SMA-10/LRIG) to these
  microdomains, resulting in enhanced BMP signaling. Alternatively, but not mutually
  exclusively, these tetraspanins may function to regulate the trafficking of their
  associated receptor SMA-6 and possibly other components in the Sma/Mab pathway to
  promote BMP signaling.
