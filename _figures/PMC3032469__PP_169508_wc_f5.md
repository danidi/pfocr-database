caption: Metabolic processes associated with proteins that are up-regulated upon Fe
  deficiency. The Met salvage cycle regenerates Met and SAM in several steps. SAM
  is synthesized by MAT from Met. SAM is then converted to methylthioadenosine (MTA)
  and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), a precursor of ethylene. SAM is also
  a precursor for the biosynthesis of NA by NAS. Phe ammonia-lyase (PAL) and 4-coumarate:CoA
  ligases (4CL) catalyze the initiation step and the last step of the general phenylpropanoid
  pathway, respectively, which ultimately lead to the formation of lignin or scopoletin.
  During the formation of feruloyl-CoA from caffeoyl-CoA, SAM is converted to S-adenosyl-l-homo-Cys
  (SAH). ARD, Acireductone dioxygenase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  KMTB, 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate; MTR-P, methylthioribose phosphate. Proteins with
  increased abundance upon Fe deficiency are framed in boxes. [See online article
  for color version of this figure.]
