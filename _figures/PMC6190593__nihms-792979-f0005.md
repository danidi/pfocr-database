caption: The Drosophila melanogaster immune response is integrated with multiple inter‑organ
  regulatory circuits. a | The fat body is a central regulator of metabolic control.
  Here, Toll signalling through the nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) transcription factor
  Dif inhibits insulin signalling and retards growth, whereas forkhead box subgroup
  O (Foxo) — the downstream target of the insulin pathway — regulates the production
  of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and anabolic genes. b | In larvae, the steroid
  hormone Ecdysone is produced in a secretory organ associated with the brain (known
  as the ring gland), whereas the source of Ecdysone is less well characterized in
  adult flies. Ecdysone is a major regulator of the D. melanogaster lifecycle, as
  well as the immune response, through controlling the expression of peptidoglycan
  recognition protein LC (PGRP‑LC) in the fat body and the phagocytic activity of
  pupal haemocytes. c | The gut microbiota further influences the insulin signalling
  pathway by regulating the production of Drosophila insulin‑like peptides (Dilps)
  in the brain. Dilp production and robust growth are triggered by acetic acid that
  is produced by Acetobacter species in the gut, and potentially triggered by optimization
  of amino acid levels provided by other components of microbiota. d | The central
  nervous system further regulates immune responses in the Malpighian tubules through
  the production of neuropeptides that are thought to trigger a nitric oxide (NO)‑dependent
  NF‑κB response in this organ. The faded part of this panel indicates a hypothetical
  role for the Imd pathway. cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; EcR, Ecdysone receptor;
  GC, guanylyl cyclase; Imd, immune deficiency; IPC, insulin‑producing cell; Nos,
  nitric oxide synthase; Tor, target of rapamycin.
