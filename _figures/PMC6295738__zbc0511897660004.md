caption: The enzymes of bile acid synthesis. The biosynthetic pathway from cholesterol
  to conjugated bile acids is shown. Individual enzymes are noted together with their
  symbols. Those marked with an asterisk were studied in the author's laboratory.
  The pathway is an explanatory convenience; with few exceptions, the order of reactions
  catalyzed and the flow of metabolites are not known.
