caption: Visualisation of transcripts showing differential regulation between Arabidopsis
  and rice. A) Transcripts encoding proteins involved in redox functions, including
  the ascorbate glutathione cycle components, were visualised on a custom pathway
  image. The log2 fold change is shown for the control vs. treated as a heatmap for
  rice and Arabidopsis in response to cold, heat conditions. Transcripts showing an
  opposite response under cold conditions (pink boxes) and heat conditions (green
  boxes) are indicated. APX-Ascorbate Peroxidase, MDHAR-Monodehydroascrobate Reductase,
  DHAR-Dehydroascorbate Reductase, GR-Glutathione Reductase. B) Phylogenetic analysis
  of non-symbiotic hemoglobin encoding genes in rice and Arabidopsis. Fold changes
  in response to each abiotic stress is indicated within the coloured boxes (Drought
  - Blue, Salt - yellow, Cold - pink, Green - heat) where the colour of the font indicates
  up-regulation (red) or down-regulation (blue).
