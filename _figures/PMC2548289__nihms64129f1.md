caption: A) Under normal conditions, plasma transferrin saturation regulates the expression
  of liver hepcidin via a HFE, TFR2 and BMP-HJV signaling pathway which in turn, is
  secreted into the blood, binding to FPN in the intestine and macrophages inducing
  FPN internalization and degradation, limiting intestinal Fe absorption and Fe recycling
  by macrophages to maintain plasma transferrin saturation. B) In HH, mutations in
  HFE, HJV and TFR2 impair hepcidin synthesis, increasing FPN levels and Fe release
  from intestinal cells and macrophages, elevating plasma transferrin saturation and
  deposition of iron in the liver and other tissues.
