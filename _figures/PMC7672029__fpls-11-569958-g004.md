caption: 'Flowering and sex determination metabolic pathways: identification of candidate
  genes underneath the QTLs. The QTLs for flowering time are found in different flowering
  dependent pathways (photoperiod, temperature, and endogenous flowering pathways).
  Photoperiod pathway involves genes of the perception and transduction of light signals
  [ultraviolet-B receptors (uvr8), circadian timekeeper (xap5), suppressor of PHYA-105
  (spa1), cryptochromes (cry1), phytochrome A (phyA), and phytochrome E (phyE)]. Temperature
  pathway involves vrn1, a vernalization dependent transcription factor. Both photoperiod
  and temperature pathways activate signaling pathways and/or transcription factors
  involved in the endogenous flowering pathway to regulate floral meristem identity
  genes, such as leafy (lfy). Genes that code for these transcription factors include
  flowering locus C (FLC), flowering locus D (FLD), flowering locus T (FLORIGEN or
  FT), suppressor of overexpression of constans1 (soc1), and gibberellic acid insensitive
  (gai gene – DELLA protein), among others. TF is used to summarize all transcription
  factors inducing floral meristem identity genes. Endogenous pathway also include
  the regulatory element of flowering genes, miR156. The QTLs for sex determination
  are found in metabolic pathways involved in regulation of phytohormones gibberellic
  acid (GA) or auxins. These pathways include B-class homeotic genes involved in the
  development of male flower organs and auxin response factors genes (ARFs) involved
  in female flower development.'
