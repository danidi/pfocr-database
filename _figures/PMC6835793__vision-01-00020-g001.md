caption: The CD40-ATP-P2X7pathway links cellular responses in Müller cells with the
  induction of inflammatory responses in bystander microglia/macrophages in DR. Blood
  levels of CD154 and expression of CD40 on Müller cells are increased in diabetes.
  CD40 ligation in Müller cells causes CCL2 upregulation and secretion of extracellular
  ATP. In turn, ATP binds P2X7 expressed in microglia/macrophages leading to upregulation
  of TNF-α and IL-1β as well as ICAM-1 and NOS2, pro-inflammatory molecules that can
  be induced by these inflammatory cytokines.
