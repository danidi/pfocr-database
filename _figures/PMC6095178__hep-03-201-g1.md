caption: (A) Activation of T cells requires recognition of antigen by the TCR in the
  context of an MHC molecule. MHC-II is involved in CD4 (helper) T-cell activation
  and is found on the surface of APCs, while MHC-I is involved in CD8 (cytotoxic)
  T-cell activation and is found on the surface of all nucleated cells. The intensity
  of the signaling downstream of this primary stimulus is modulated by several other
  cell surface receptors, two off which are shown here in simplified schematic. (B)
  CD28 is an example of a costimulatory receptor, which enhances stimulatory signaling
  in T cells upon binding to its ligand B7 on APCs. (C) By contrast, immune checkpoints,
  such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, are coinhibitory receptors, which diminish T-cell activation.
  Upon binding to its ligand (PD-L1), PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation and can promote
  T-cell apoptosis, thereby resulting in reduced T-cell mediated immune responses
  and, in the setting of malignancy, tumor cell survival via inhibition of cell death.
  (D) Immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab) are monoclonal
  antibodies that block these coinhibitory receptors. Disruption of these inhibitory
  pathways can tip the intracellular signaling balance toward T-cell activation, thereby
  promoting T-cell-mediated killing of cancer cells. The broad mechanics of the CTLA-4
  pathway and its inhibitors are similar to those diagramed above for PD-1, though
  CTLA-4 also directly binds to B7 (not shown), thereby also competitively inhibiting
  CD28.APC: Antigen-presenting cell; TCR: T-cell receptor.
