caption: The Snf3/Rgt2 signaling pathway. Transcription of hexose transporter genes
  (HXT) is repressed by Rgt1 in the absence of glucose; in contrast, Mig1 represses
  transcription of its target genes in the presence of glucose and cross-regulates
  the Snf3/Rgt2 pathway as shown. Relief from the repressor function of Rgt1 occurs
  via glucose signaling of the Snf3/Rgt2 sensors, which stimulate phosphorylation
  of Mth1 and Std1 by Yck kinases; the C-terminal tails of Snf3 and Rgt2 also appear
  to facilitate this event by interacting with both the kinases and their substrates.
  The Yck polypeptides are tethered to the plasma membrane via palmitate (red squiggles).
  Yck-phosphorylated Mth1 and Std1 are subjected to SCFGrr1-mediated ubiquitination
  and degradation by the proteasome. This releases Rgt1 from its upstream DNA binding
  sites and results in derepression of downstream HXT target genes. Removal of Mth1
  and Std1 converts Rgt1 into a transcriptional activator that may stimulate HXT expression
  in the absence of specific DNA binding activity.
