caption: Known TNF-α and TGF-β signaling of angiogenesis, and putative pathways by
  which PNF1 functions. We hypothesize that PNF1 activates endothelial cells and stimulates
  their production of TNF-α, an angiogenic cytokine that also recruits monocytes and
  promotes arteriogenesis. Additionally, TNF-α stimulates production of TGF-β, which
  stimulates both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in vivo (Wahl et al., ). Evaluation
  of PNF1 effects in CCL2 receptor mouse chimeras (CCR2−/−) recently suggested that
  monocyte recruitment is critical for PNF1 efficacy (Wieghaus et al., ).
