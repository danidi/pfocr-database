caption: Role of arginase in immunosuppression. During parasitic infections, mouse
  macrophage-specific arginase-1 induces T cell suppression due to arginase-mediated
  depletion of L-arginine in the T cell environment, which leads to CD3ζ chain down-regulation.
  Additionally, PD-1/PD-L pathway may be also involved in the T cell suppression.
  Furthermore, human granulocyte arginase can also induce immunosuppression by a similar
  mechanism. Upon human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) cell death, arginase
  is liberated and high activities of this enzyme accumulate extracellularly during
  purulent inflammatory reactions. PMN arginase induces a profound suppression of
  T cell and NK cell proliferation and cytokine synthesis.
