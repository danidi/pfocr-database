caption: In utero exposure to DEHP alters cholesterol metabolism. The scavenger receptor
  class BI (SR-BI) pathway, which facilitates the uptake of cholesterol from HDL,
  is the predominant source of cholesterol for adrenal steroidogenesis. The esterified
  cholesterol delivered by SR-BI and obtained from lipid droplets is de-esterified
  by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) for steroid biosynthesis. In utero DEHP exposure
  increases expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and de novo
  cholesterol synthesis pathway but decreases HSL expression. HSL function appears
  to be insufficient to release free cholesterol, thus decreasing the pool of free
  cholesterol. Some of the esterified cholesterol is shunted to lipid droplets, increasing
  their size. The data suggest that increased de novo cholesterol synthesis is critical
  to maintain steroidogenesis.
