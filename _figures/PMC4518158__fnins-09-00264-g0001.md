caption: The unfolded protein response. (A) The PERK pathway. Under conditions of
  ER stress the PERK protein becomes activated by homodimerization and autophosphorylation.
  p-PERK phosphorylates eIF2α which represses eIF2B, resulting in reduced ER load
  through inhibition of global protein synthesis and inducation of cytoprotective
  genes by preferentially stimulating translation of ATF4. ATF4 also enhances the
  expression of CHOP, which negatively regulates p-eIF2α levels through the production
  of GADD34 that binds PP1 and dephosphorylates eIF2α. (B) The IRE1 pathway. IRE1
  is activated by homodimerization and autophosphorylation in conditions of ER stress.
  p-IRE1 splices XBP1 mRNA to produce the sXBP1, which induces cytoprotective genes
  and ER expansion. IRE1 also induces mRNA degradation via RIDD to help reduce ER
  load. (C) The ATF6 pathway. ER stress results in the translocation of ATF6 to the
  Golgi complex where it is activated by proteolytic cleavage by the proteases S1P
  and S2P resulting in the 50 kDa cleaved ATF6 fragment, which stimulates the expression
  of chaperones.
