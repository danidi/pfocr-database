caption: 'The central metabolic regulation of ferroptosis. (a) Transferrin, TFRC,
  and NCOA4 regulate iron sequestration by increasing the levels of [Fe2+] LIP, thus
  triggering lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. (b) System Xc− (composed by SLC7A11
  and SLC3A2) exchanges intracellular glutamate for extracellular cystine, thereby
  supporting intracellular glutathione (GSH) synthesis, which is the primary endogenous
  antioxidant. GPX4 uses GSH to detoxify lipid hydroperoxide, thus protecting tumor
  cells against ferroptosis. And the transsulfuration pathway affects ferroptosis
  sensitivity by providing cysteine for GSH synthesis. (c) NADPH can be used for the
  regeneration of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) by glutathione reductase (GR).
  There are three significant ways for intracellular NADPH production—produced from
  pentose phosphate pathway, produced by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2
  through the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, and malic enzyme 1 (ME1)
  through the transformation of malate to pyruvate. In addition to GSH regeneration,
  the regeneration of thioredoxin (TXN) and the activity of CoQ10 are also required
  for the participation of NADPH to eliminate ROS and antiferroptosis. And in some
  cellular contexts, NADPH can be oxidized by NADPH oxidase (NOX), thus increasing
  intracellular ROS levels. (d) Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) produced from the
  mevalonate pathway is required for the cholesterol biosynthesis, Sec-tRNA, and CoQ10
  production, which all can be used to regulate ferroptosis sensitivity. Sec-tRNA
  is essential for the integration of GPX4 with selenocysteine. TF: transferrin; DMT1:
