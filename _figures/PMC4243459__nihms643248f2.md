caption: Dynamical constraints on a signaling pathway involved in tissue differentiation
  in rat correlate with allelic variation at the population level in the same pathway
  in fruit flies, revealing a link between dynamics and evolution. The “stiffest”
  combination of parameters was associated with the Ras and Raf proteins at the top
  of the pathway, and in fruit flies Ras and Raf exhibit the least allelic variation
  of all of the components of the pathway, consistent with the concept that stiff
  parameter combinations are constrained during evolution. The dotted box indicates
  that some accessory components of the two cascades are excluded here for clarity
  of presentation.
