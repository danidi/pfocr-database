caption: A simplified model of the potential contributions of selective sensors and
  cell types to IFN production during viral infections. Different innate immune recognition
  receptors are involved in sensing various types of viral nucleic acids in distinct
  categories of cells during viral infections, which may promote different types of
  anti-viral defenses. For each selected sensor shown, the types of viral nucleic
  acids recognized and the downstream signaling cascade induced are represented in
  a simplified, schematic manner. The potential specific role of each cell type in
  anti-viral defenses is also indicated at the bottom of each panel. (A) Potentially
  all types of infected cells can detect endogenous viral replication through cytosolic
  sensors triggering their local production of IFN-β/λ to control viral replication
  in an autocrine and paracrine fashion in infected tissues. (B) Uninfected XCR1+
  DCs selectively produce high levels of IFN-λ and IFN-β upon engulfment of materials
  containing dsRNA and the consecutive triggering of TLR3 in endosomes. The receptor
  of IFN-λ is mostly expressed by epithelial cells. Hence, XCR1+ DCs might be involved
  in inducing local IFN responses in virally infected epithelial tissues. Since XCR1+
  DCs are especially efficient at producing IFN-III upon HCV stimulation, they might
  contribute to local or systemic IFN production during infection with this virus,
  to promote IFN-λ-mediated protection of hepatocytes. Uninfected XCR1+ DCs and other
  uninfected cells may produce some IFN-β upon engulfment of materials containing
  ssRNA and the consecutive triggering of TLR8 in endosomes. The contribution of this
  pathway to anti-viral defense is not well understood yet, in part because mouse
  TLR8 is deficient for this function. (C) Uninfected pDCs selectively produce high
  levels of all subsets of IFNs upon engulfment of materials containing ssRNA or CpG
  DNA and the consecutive triggering of TLR7/9 in endosomes. However, pDCs seem to
  be activated for this function only in lymphoid tissues. Hence, pDC might contribute
  to systemic IFN production during blood-borne viral infections or as a failsafe
  mechanism activated upon abnormal widespread dissemination of a viral infection
  once it has escaped local confinement at its portal of entry. CM, cell membrane;
  NM, nuclear membrane.
