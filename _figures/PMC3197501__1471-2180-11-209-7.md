caption: Tentative model of the mechanistic function of the A. giganteus antifungal
  protein AFPNN5353 on Aspergillus sp. The response against AFPNN5353 attack is mediated
  via PkcA/MpkA signalling and results in increased agsA transcription. However, the
  activity of the CWIP occurs independently from RhoA and so far unidentified RhoA-GAP
  effector molecules might contribute to the AFPNN5353 toxicity. Furthermore, AFPNN5353
  leads to an immediate and significant increase of the [Ca2+]c resting level in the
  cell. The sustained perturbation of the Ca2+ homeostasis could lead to PCD [,].
  The presence of elevated concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ counteracts the toxic
  effects of AFPNN5353 and improves the resistance of the target organism by decreasing
  the elevated [Ca2+]c resting level. Whereas cell wall remodelling via CWIP seems
  to be insufficient to counteract AFPNN5353 activity, the fortification of the cell
  wall by the induction of chsD expression might represent an adequate response to
  increase resistance [].
