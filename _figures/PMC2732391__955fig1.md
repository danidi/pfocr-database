caption: (A) Semaphorins and their receptors in C. elegans. Two class I semaphorins,
  SMP-1 and SMP-2, function partly redundantly in PLX-1 plexin signaling. The secreted
  class 2 semaphorin MAB-20 binds PLX-2 (); however, genetic data indicate PLX-2 must
  act in concert with other receptors. (B) Positioning of ray cells in the male tail
  epithelium. Schematic diagram of part of the lateral male tail, anterior to the
  left and dorsal up. Epidermal cells are in orange, and the ray cell group cells
  (two neurons and a structural cell) are blue. In the wild type, ray groups 1 and
  2 form next to each other in the lateral epidermis; ray 1’s posterior position is
  dependent on attractive semaphorin signaling from the hook (green). Ray group 1
  normally clusters at the junction between R1.p and R2.p (which later fuse). In animals
  lacking the semaphorin signal, the R1.p cell is smaller; as a consequence, the ray
  1 cell group is separated from ray 2. A more anatomically correct view of ray formation
  is given at http://www.wormatlas.org. (C) Signaling from PLX-1 activates translation
  via eIF2α. PLX-1 reduces the level of phospho-eIF2α by an unknown signaling pathway.
  GCN-1 and PEK-1 together increase phospho-eIF2α, either indirectly or directly.
