caption: Regulation of DRP1 and mitochondrial fission by ERK1/2 signalling. (A) Cycles
  of fission and fusion help the mitochondrial network to adapt to the changing metabolic
  needs of the cell and allow the intermixing and spreading of metabolites, enzymes
  and mitochondrial DNA throughout the entire mitochondrial network. Mitochondrial
  fission also provides a mechanism for segregating dysfunctional mitochondria that
  can then be cleared by mitophagy as part of a fusion–fission–mitophagy quality control
  pathway. ERK1/2 signalling promotes mitochondrial fission. (B) The large GTPase
  dynamin‐related protein 1 (DRP1) is recruited to sites of mitochondrial constriction
  where it forms a higher order ring structure that promotes mitotic fission via GTP‐dependent
  scission. Phosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser616 by CDK1 or CDK5 reverses its sequestration
  at microtubules, promoting mitochondrial translocation of DRP1 and consequent mitochondrial
  fission/fragmentation. Recently it has been shown that ERK1/2 also phosphorylates
  DRP1 at Ser616 to promote mitochondrial fission/fragmentation as part of the metabolic
  reprograming that underpins RAS‐ or BRAF‐drive tumourigenesis and iPSC reprogramming
  following expression of the four stemness transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4
  and c‐Myc (OSKM).
