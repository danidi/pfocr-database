caption: The effects of PI3K/Akt modulation on neuropathic pain development and morphine-induced
  microglia migration, as well as the expression of pro- and anti-nociceptive factors.
  The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway signaling cascade is initiated by many cytokines
  and growth factors as well as by insulin and LPS. This cascade modulates nociceptive
  information and mediates the central sensitization induced by a noxious stimuli.
  Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway activation reduces symptoms of neuropathic pain,
  reduces morphine-induced migration and diminishes pronociceptive factors expression.
  However, it was shown that also activation of PI3K/Akt pathway diminishes pronociceptive
  and increases antinociceptive factors.
