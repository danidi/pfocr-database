caption: Model depicting the role of the Ckk2-Cmk1 pathway in Ca2+response. An increase
  in intracellular Ca2+ levels results in activation of Ca2+/CaM-dependent proteins,
  including the phosphatase calcineurin (Ppb1) and the Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinases
  Cmk1 and Ckk2. Ppb1 dephosphorylates Prz1 leading to its nuclear translocation and
  activation of cmk1 gene transcription. In parallel, activation of Ckk2 phosphorylates
  and fully activates Cmk1 which phosphorylates and inactivates both; Cdc25 and Prz1,
  promoting their nuclear export.
