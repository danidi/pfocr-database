caption: The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator
  1 (PGC-1α) in the onset of Parkinson’s disease. (A) In healthy subjects, damaged
  mitochondria are promptly replaced with new functional organelles. Mitochondrial
  depolarization induces PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) to phosphorylate serine
  65 residue of ubiquitin (pSer65Ub) and of Parkin, which in turn interact together
  to increase the PINK1 phosphorylation rate of Parkin. The activation of the PINK1/Parkin
  pathway promotes the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy and
  concomitantly induces the expression of PGC-1α by the ubiquitination of PARIS and
  α-synuclein. By coactivating nuclear receptors (NRs) or transcription factors (TFs),
  PGC-1α promotes the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (mitochondrial
  transcription factor A, TFAM) and antioxidant response (superoxide dismutase 2,
  SOD2; glutathione peroxidase 1, GPX1). (B) In Parkinson’s disease individuals, PINK1
  and Parkin usually display loss-of-function mutations. Therefore, the PINK1/Parkin
  axis cannot prevent the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria due to its inability
  to sustain mitophagy. At the same time, altered Parkin fails to promote the degradation
  of both PARIS and α-synuclein, which start to accumulate in the nucleus inhibiting
  PGC-1α transcription. The low levels of PGC-1α observed in PD patients are not sufficient
  to induce the expression of genes involved in the renewal of mitochondria and in
  the antioxidant response. Thereby, reactive oxygen species (ROS) start to accumulate,
  finally leading to the damage and the death of dopaminergic neurons. Dashed lines
  and soft colours represent inhibited actions/pathways.
