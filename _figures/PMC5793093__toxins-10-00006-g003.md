caption: Origin and functions of melanins in the central nervous system. Melanin accumulates
  in catecholaminergic neurons and retinal pigmented epithelial cells from catecholamines
  (dopamine in substantia nigra and noradrenaline in locus ceruleus) and dopa derivates
  respectively. Intraneuronal neuromelanin could play a protective role during its
  synthesis by preventing the toxic accumulation of cytosolic catecholamines and derivatives.
  Those can trigger proteosomal (dopamine and o-quinones) and mitochondrial (o-quinones)
  dysfunctions, oxidative stress reactions (o-quinones) and α-synuclein oligomerization
  (o-quinones and 5–6 indolquinol). All those events can ultimately lead to the neuronal
  death and development of a neurodegenerative process. Melanin polymers limit the
  accumulation of catecholamines and derivates, therefore fighting neuronal death.
  In addition, by its ability to scavenge reactive metals, pesticides and other toxins
  to form stable adducts, this pigment also limits the extent of neurotoxic insults
  and provide neuroprotection to CNS areas expressing it.
