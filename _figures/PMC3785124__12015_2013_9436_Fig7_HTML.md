caption: 'Simplified network controlling the fate decisions between osteogenic and
  adipogenic lineages in huAFMSCs. Stem cells, in appropriate cell culture conditions,
  initiate osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation. Osteogenic commitment is linked
  to the stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway that sequentially involves: activation
  of the LRP5/6 co-receptor via the frizzled receptors, signal transmission through
  Dishevelled (Dvl), phosphorylation of GSK-3β leading to the inactivation of a cytoplasmic
  complex composed of CK1, Axin, APC and GSK-3β, detachment of β-catenin phosphorylation
  from the complex. These events result in β-catenin stabilization and in the transcriptional
  activation of target genes mediated by β-catenin, i.e. the early osteogenic markers
  RUNX-2 and ALP. DKK1 is a secreted Wnt antagonist that may be used as a drug to
  inhibit Wnt signal. Adipogenic commitment involves early inhibition of Wnt signal
  leading to recruitment of β-catenin to the protein complex, which facilitates the
  GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation of β-catenin. These
  events favors the transcription of PPARγ and FABP4, considered as the main initiators
  of adipogenesis. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; βcat, β-catenin; CK1, casein kinase
  1; DKK1, dickkopf 1; Dvl, Dishevelled; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; LRP5/6,
