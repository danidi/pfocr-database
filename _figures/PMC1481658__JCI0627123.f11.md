caption: Insulin hyperpolarizes POMC neurons via robust (solid line) activation of
  PI3K (p85, regulatory subunit; p110, catalytic subunit) and generation of PIP3.
  PIP3 activates KATP channels, resulting in hyperpolarization and a decreased neuronal
  firing rate. By contrast, leptin depolarizes POMC neurons, probably by opening nonspecific
  cation channels (). Activation of the leptin receptor produces relatively weak (dashed
  line) stimulation of PI3K via IRS proteins but strong Stat3 phosphorylation via
  activation of Jak2, thereby leading to increased expression of POMC. KATP channel
  activity is also regulated by metabolically generated ATP and adenosine diphosphate
  (ADP) (). This has been proposed to play a role in sensing ambient glucose concentrations
  (), thereby regulating neuroendocrine sensitivity to glucose and metabolic efficiency
  (). Other hormonal receptors that activate the PI3K pathway are shown by an ×. GP,
  glucose-6-phosphate; GK, glucokinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol4,5-biphosphate.
