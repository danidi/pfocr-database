caption: 'ERK5 regulates the FAK signaling. (A) GeneGO pathway showing changes in
  expression of proteins involved in FAK signaling (higher definition image is shown
  in Supplementary file 2: Fig. S9). The various proteins on this map are represented
  by different symbols (representing the functional class of the protein). Thermometers
  with blue or red shading next to symbols depict proteins identified in the present
  study: blue color represents the proteins that were downregulated in ERK5-overexpression
  A549 cells relative to control A549 cells; red color represents the proteins that
  were upregulated. (B) The expression levels of FAK, ERK5, and p-ERK5 in ERK5-overexpression
  A549 cells. Band intensity was quantified by Image J software. (C) The expression
  levels of FAK, ERK5, and p-ERK5 in B16F1 cells transfected with MEK5D + ERK5, MEK5A
  + DN-ERK5, or control vector PRK5. Band intensity was quantified by Image J software.
  (D) B16F10 and B16F1 cells were transfected with MEK5D + ERK5, MEK5A + DN-ERK5,
  or control vector PRK5. Transfected cells were then cotransfected with FAK-Luc plasmid
  and pRL-TK Renilla vector. After 24 h, luciferase expression was measured. FAK luciferase
  activity was normalized to that of Renilla and expressed to control. (E and F) The
  phosphorylation level of ERK5 (E) and the FAK luciferase activity (F) in B16F1 cells
  transfected with ERK5 and MEK5D at different ratio. Data are represented as mean
  ± SD, *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 compared with respective control or indicated treatment'
