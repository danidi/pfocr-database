caption: Pathways depicted are based largely on evidence from mouse models. The conventional
  pathway is initiated by inactivation of the tumor suppressor APC in normal colonic
  epithelium which results in the formation of conventional-type adenoma, further
  followed by the additional sequential mutations of oncogenes or tumor suppressor
  genes to progress to adenocarcinoma (adenoma-carcinoma sequence). This type of CRCs
  generally displays chromosomal instability (CIN) with immune cold tumor microenvironment
  (TME). Oncogenic mutation in BRAF (less frequently in KRAS) leads to the development
  of serrated precursors such as microvesicular HPs and SSA/Ps. Hypermethylation in
  the CpG island promoter regions (CpG island methylation phenotype; CIMP) of tumor
  suppressor genes such as p16INK4a results in the silencing of these genes and allow
  a complete malignant transformation of these serrated lesions (classical serrated
  pathway). Epigenetic silencing of MLH1 in these tumor cells leads to the development
  of MSI-H CRCs with enhanced tumor mutational burden, which invokes a strong immune
  response in TME. Simultaneous loss of both PKCλ/ι and PKCζ results in the rapid
  development of serrated benign to invasive carcinoma lesions. These tumors display
  the highly activated mesenchyme and EMT/CAF signatures accompanied by a highly immunosuppressive
  TME. Loss of CDX2 in combination with alteration in other tumor suppressors (such
  as APC), also display the mesenchymal/stromal tumor phenotype. The loss of aPKCs
  or the hyperproduction of TGFβ in the TME has been proposed to skew the serrated
  precursors from the classical to the mesenchymal subtype.

  description: Pathways depicted are based largely on evidence from mouse models.
    The conventional pathway is initiated by inactivation of the tumor suppressor
    APC in normal colonic epithelium which results in the formation of conventional-type
    adenoma, further followed by the additional sequential mutations of oncogenes
    or tumor suppressor genes to progress to adenocarcinoma (adenoma-carcinoma sequence).
    This type of CRCs generally displays chromosomal instability (CIN) with immune
    cold tumor microenvironment (TME). Oncogenic mutation in BRAF (less frequently
