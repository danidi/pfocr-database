caption: Proposed mechanisms by which PTH activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway in osteoblasts
  and osteocytes to modulate bone turnover. In the osteoblast (left), PTH binding
  to Lrp6 and PTH1R activates PKA, which activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating
  Lrp6. The levels of β-catenin rise, which leads to modulation of RANKL and OPG expression
  resulting in a decreased RANKL/OPG ratio. PKA itself can also directly stabilize
  β-catenin through phosphorylation and also directly stimulates RANKL production.
  The increased production of RANKL when PTH is administered continuously might be
  mediated by this action of PKA. A similar mechanism occurs in the osteocyte (right),
  presumably also through Lrp6 signaling. While it is unconfirmed whether PKA can
  also directly stimulate RANKL transcription in osteocytes, continuous PTH in osteocytes
  activates RANKL production while only activating the Wnt/β-catenin instead increases
  OPG production. A notable difference between how both cell types respond to PTH
  is that PKA activation inhibits sclerostin production in osteocytes. The decrease
  in sclerostin could partly explain the resulting increase in bone formation when
  PTH is given intermittently. Moreover, expression of sclerostin in osteocytes seems
  to further upregulate RANKL in those same cells.
