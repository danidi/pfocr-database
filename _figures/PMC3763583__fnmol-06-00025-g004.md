caption: 'Hypothesis: expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the
  TLR recognition (and resultant innate inflammatory response) of repeat RNA as “non-self”
  due to their paucity of “self” modification that is exposed upon Dicer processing
  of double-strand RNA. Open circles represent sequence motifs for RNA modifying proteins;
  filled circles represent the modification of RNA at these specific sequence motifs
  (e.g., by methylation or A > I editing). Dicer is required for pathology in the
  Drosophila model and cleaves long high copy number repeat RNA down to 21mers [mainly
  r(CAG)7 mers; ]. These r(CAG)7 mers are, therefore, unmodified and recognized by
  TLRs as “non-self.” Toll-like receptor pathways (most probably the endosomal TLR3
  receptor) are required for pathology (), through activation of the innate inflammatory
  pathway. Autophagy reduces pathology, possibly by metabolizing r(CAG)7 mers.'
