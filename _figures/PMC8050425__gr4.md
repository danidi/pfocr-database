caption: 'Schematic representation of Gap1 endocytic pathways. During growth on non-preferred
  nitrogen sources (such as proline), Gap1 is stable and localized at the plasma membrane
  (PM). However, if a preferred N source is added (e.g., NH4+), Gap1 is rapidly internalized,
  which can be induced via two distinct pathways: (A) Activity independent-Gap1 endocytosis
  (induced by intracellular AAs). In this pathway, NH4+ is imported via Mep permeases
  and then converted to glutamate (the major N donor) by glutamate dehydrogenases
  (Gdh) enzymes. Glutamate, in turn, promotes an increase in the concentration of
  intracellular AAs, which activates the TORC1 signaling via the EGO complex. Once
  activated, TORC1 inhibits Npr1 kinase, by promoting its hyper-phosphorylation, and
  activates Sit4 phosphatase. Sit4 dephosphorylates Bul1/2 protein adaptors and, consequently,
  causes their dissociation with 14–3-3 proteins. Once free of the inhibitory action
  of 14-3-3 proteins, Bul1/2 are ubiquitylated by Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase. Lastly, the
  complex Bul1/2-Rsp5 triggers ubiquitylation of Gap1, causing its internalization
  and further degradation in the vacuole ,  (B) Activity dependent-Gap1 endocytosis
  (induced by extracellular AAs). In this pathway, internalization of Gap1 is dependent
  on substrate transport. AAs are imported through Gap1, which causes a transition
  of Gap1 from an OF to an IF conformation and exposes important residues that are
  further recognized by the ubiquitylation machinery (Bul1/2 and Rsp5) . Recent studies
  suggest that the influx of protons (H+) coupled to AAs import represents a general
  signal for the activation of TORC1 complex . AAs, amino acids; PM, plasma membrane;
