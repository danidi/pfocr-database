caption: 'Hypercalcuric hypomagnesemias such as FHHNC, ADH, and BS affect the TAL
  by disturbing the lumen-positive potential. A) Potassium secretion via ROMK constitutes
  one component of the lumen-positive potential (1.). The second (2.) component is
  due to the dilution potential: At the beginning of the TAL luminal Na+ has a concentration
  of 140 mM which decreases to 30 mM along the downstream TAL. As more Na+ and Cl−
  is absorbed along the TAL a major Na+ and Cl− gradient between lumen and interstitium
  is created. A higher Na+ and Cl− concentration in the interstitium result in a driving
  force for both ions to leak back into the tubular lumen. This is where Claudin-16
  and 19 come into play. While Claudin-16 increases the Na+ permeability, Claudin-19
  decreases the Cl− permeability, thereby contributing to a high permeability ratio
  of Na+ to Cl− and providing a strong cation selectivity for Na+ causing the lumen-positive
  potential to rise from 8 to 20 mV or even higher. B) Different mechanisms contribute
  to hypomagnesemia in case of CaSR activation including an inhibitable adenylcyclase
  and activation of inhibitory G proteins resulting in decreased intracellular cAMP
  levels (cAMP usually enhances NKCC2 and ROMK activities). A novel pathway involves
  calcineurin signaling and downregulation of NFAT which reduces transcription of
  two miRNAs called miR9 and miR374 (blue arrows). With CaSR activation there is downregulation
  of miR9 and 374 and upregulation of Claudin-14 which suppresses the Claudin-16 and
  19 complex, thereby interfering with the lumen-positive lumen potential. C) Mutations
  in CLCNKB and BSND disturb the intracellular Cl− regulation which is thought to
  affect apical NCC and NKCC2 function. Impaired NCC and NKCC2 function interferes
  with the generation of the lumen-positive potential and may thereby disturb tubular
  Mg2+ absorption.'
