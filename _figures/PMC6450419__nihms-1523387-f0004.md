caption: Selective autophagy removes dysfunctional/superfluous organelles downstream
  of metabolic cues. It also provides a source of raw material for several metabolic
  processes and pathways. Selective autophagy involves the sequestration of specific
  cargo by a LIR-containing receptor that links the cargo with LC3-II (see text for
  details). An example in (A) shows the selective targeting of ribosomes to the mitochondria
  by the ribophagy receptor NUFIP1. Designated receptors have not yet been identified
  for all types of selective autophagy. Selective uptake of lipid droplets (B) may
  simply occur by the formation and expansion of the phagophore on the surface of
  the droplet. (C) Ferritinophagy allows the iron-dependent regulation of Ferritin
  degradation. NCOA4 is the receptor that targets the iron-storing protein Ferritin
  to LC3-II. Under conditions of ironsufficiency, NCOA4 is ubiquitinated by HERC2
  via an iron-dependent interaction, leading to NCOA4 degradation. When the cellular
  levels of free iron decline, this interaction is weakened allowing NCOA4 to target
  Ferritin to the phagophore. The degradation of Ferritin releases free iron. (D)
  Healthy mitochondria are the principal source of cellular ATP and regulate multiple
  metabolic circuits. Damaged mitochondria, that are detrimental, are removed by mitophagy.
  In the PINK1-PRKN dependent pathway of mitophagy, the kinase PINK1 which is imported
  and cleaved in healthy mitochondria, and subsequently targeted for cytosolic degradation,
  is stabilized on the OMM (outer mitochondrial membrane). PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin
  and the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN promoting large-scale ubiquitination of mitochondrial
  OMM proteins. Ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by ubiquitin-binding autophagy
  adaptors such as OPTN and SQSTM1 which also bind LC3-II, promoting mitochondrial
  degradation (refer to text for details). Mitophagy may also be orchestrated by OMM/IMM
  (inner mitochondrial membrane) proteins that directly bind LC3-II and function as
  mitophagy receptors (refer to text and  for details).
