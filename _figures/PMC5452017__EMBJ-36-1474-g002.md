caption: 'In neurons after entering the cell via glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), glucose
  is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to glucose‐6‐phosphate (G6P), which is subsequently
  routed in the glycolytic pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The end
  product of glycolysis is pyruvate that enters the mitochondria where it is metabolized
  through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in the
  electron transport chain (ETC.), generating adenosine‐5′‐triphosphate (ATP) and
  carbon dioxide (CO2) while consuming oxygen (O2). Pyruvate can also be generated
  from lactate dehydrogenase 1 (LDH1)‐dependent conversion of lactate. In the PPP,
  G6P is converted to 6‐phosphogluconate (6PG) that is transformed in ribulose‐5‐phosphate
  (R5P), with the concomitant production of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH). NADPH is utilized to regenerate oxidized antioxidants such as
  glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin. Neurons are not able to store glucose in the
  form of glycogen due to constitutive degradation of glycogen synthase (GS) via glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylation, and subsequent ubiquitin‐dependent proteasomal
  digestion mediated by the malin–laforin complex. In astrocytes, glucose is imported
  trough glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and preferentially stored as glycogen, or metabolized
  via glycolysis. The pyruvate generated is converted to lactate thanks to the expression
  of lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)‐dependent
  inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). The presence of 6‐phosphofructo‐2‐kinase/fructose‐2,6‐bisphosphatase
  3 (Pfkfb3) allows astrocytes to generate fructose‐2,6‐bisphosphate (F2,6P) that
  acts as an allosteric modulator of PKF1 boosting glycolysis. Abbreviations are as
  follows: F6P, fructose‐6‐phosphate; PKF1, phosphofructokinase 1; F1,6P, fructose‐1,6‐diphosphate;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate; Mit, mitochondrion; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PKM1,
  pyruvate kinase M1; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; G1P, glucose‐1‐phosphate; GP, glycogen
  phosphorylase; APC/C‐Cdh1, anaphase‐promoting complex C/cytosome‐Cdh1; MCT, monocarboxylic
  acid transporter.'
