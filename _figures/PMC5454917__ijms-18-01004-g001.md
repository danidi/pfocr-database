caption: Schematic biosynthetic pathway of aliphatic and indole glucosinolates and
  involved genes (modified from Yi et al. []). Genes following numbers in brackets
  are analyzed in this study (). Gene names in light blue without a number were not
  analyzed in this study. The dashed line separates the biosynthesis pathway into
  three sections—chain elongation, core-structure biosynthesis, and secondary modification
  with addition of glucosinolate hydrolysis products. The dashed lines between compounds
  are to clarify and group the compounds from the same precursor or in the same group.
  Dotted arrow indicates another reaction pathway without involving of ESP. ESM1 regulates
  ESP (bar and dash).
