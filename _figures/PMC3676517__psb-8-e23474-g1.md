caption: Figure 1. AXR1 promotes the cytokinin response by suppressing the accumulation
  of response inhibitors. Cytokinin (CK) is perceived by the AHK receptors leading
  to their autophosphorylation. The phosphoryl group is then transferred from the
  AHKs via the AHPs onto the response-activating type-B ARRs and the response-inhibiting
  type-A ARRs. AXR1, a key enzyme of the RUB protein modification pathway, promotes
  RUB attachment on the CUL subunit of the CRL class of ubiquitin ligases. RUB modification
  of an as-yet-unidentified CRL increases its affinity for the type-A ARRs and leads
  to their polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome.
