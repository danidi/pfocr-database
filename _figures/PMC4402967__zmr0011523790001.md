caption: Curcuminoid biosynthetic pathway in Curcuma longa. Cinnamic acid is synthesized
  from phenylalanine by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and converted to coumaric
  acid by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H). Then, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) converts
  coumaric acid to coumaroyl-CoA, and p-coumaroyl shikimate transferase (CST), p-coumaroyl
  5-O-shikimate 3′-hydroxylase (CS3′H), and caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT)
  convert it to feruloyl-CoA. Coumaroyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA are then converted by
  diketide-CoA synthase (DCS) to diketide-CoAs by condensation with malonyl-CoA. In
  the end, curcumin synthases (CURSs) catalyze the formation of curcuminoids by condensing
  the diketide-CoAs with coumaroyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA. Depending on the combination,
  different curcuminoids are produced, namely, bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin,
  and curcumin. The route indicated by dashed arrows corresponds to a less central
  phenylpropanoid pathway and may not occur in vivo in C. longa.
