caption: 'Tumor microenvironment shapes NK cell metabolism and effector functions.
  (A) Schematic representation of multiple factors that modulate NK cell metabolism
  (black), and factors that modulate metabolism and/or negatively affect effector
  functions (red). NK cells compete for nutrients against tumor and myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs). Tumor cells consume large amounts of glucose and produce
  lactate, which is transported into NK cells through the SLC16A1 and SLC16A3 transporters,
  impairing ATP production. Tumor cells also generate extracellular adenosine through
  the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73. Extracellular adenosine inhibits NK cell oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolytic capacity. Additionally, tumor cells increase
  amino acid consumption and MDSCs upregulate arginase, IDO, and iNOS enzymes, thus
  generating an amino acid depleted environment and releasing the immunosuppressive
  metabolites NO and L-kynurenine. Some amino acids and their transport are necessary
  to sustain mTOR and cMyc signaling, which promote glycolysis. Moreover, mTOR signaling
  can be also impaired by TGF-β secreted by tumor cells and MDSCs. The glycolytic
  pathway can be also modulated by the FBP1 enzyme, which is found to be upregulated
  in the tumor-infiltrating NK cells of some cancers. Finally, high oxygen consumption
  by tumor cells and disorganized vascularization can generate hypoxic regions. Hypoxia
  impairs NK cell effector functions, but also sustains HIF1α, which promotes glycolytic
  metabolism. Solid lines: release or uptake of different nutrients, metabolites,
  and other factors. Dashed lines: metabolic processing of substrates. Dotted lines:
  factors that promote or sustain (green lines), or inhibit (red lines), specific
  pathways. (B) A schematic representation of several metabolites and other factors
  present in the TME that limit NK cell effector functions.'
