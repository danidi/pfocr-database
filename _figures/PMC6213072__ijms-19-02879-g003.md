caption: Glioblastoma vaccine consists of the presentation of glioblastoma-associated
  antigens, peptides or epitopes (derived from tumor lysate to T cells). The tumor
  cells could evade the destruction by CTLs through the increase of immune checkpoint
  ligands. The use of checkpoint inhibitors could prevent this interaction. The presence
  on the glioblastoma cell surface of IL-13 and EGFR receptors, which are presented
  independently of MHC class I, makes it possible to develop modified CAR T cells.
  Oncolytic viral therapy uses a virus that can activate the immunogenic cancer cell
  death pathway or kill the tumor cell directly.
