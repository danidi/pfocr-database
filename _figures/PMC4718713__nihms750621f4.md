caption: (A) In ER-negative breast cancer cells, EZH2 activates NFκB target genes
  through the formation of a ternary complex with the NFκB components, RelA and RelB,
  via a process that does not require other PRC2 subunits. (B) In ER-positive breast
  cancer cells, EZH2 physically interacts directly with ER-α and Wnt signaling components,
  activating their downstream targets, like c-myc and cyclin D1, via RNA polymerase
  II transcription. (C) In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), phosphorylation
  of EZH2 at Ser21, mediated by the PI3K-Akt pathway, alters its function from a polycomb
  repressor to a transcriptional co-activator of the AR.
