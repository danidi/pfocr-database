caption: IL-12 signaling pathway. IL-12 activates the Jak/STAT pathway. Following
  binding of IL-12p40 and IL-12p35 to IL-12R β1 and IL-12R β2, respectively, Jak-2
  and Tyk-2 get transphosphorylated. Phosphorylated IL-12R β2 binds to STAT4 which
  will then dimerize with another STAT4 molecule. STAT4 homodimers translocate to
  the nucleus and promote IFN-γ gene transcription. T-bet is another transcription
  factor that plays a role in Th1 development and IFN-γ production. The IL-12 and
  IFN-γ induce the activity and proliferation of MΦs, NK cells, and T cells, which
  also secrete IL-12. Modified from Ref. [].
