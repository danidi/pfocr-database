caption: LMP2A induces signaling pathways that promote membrane localization of αV-integrin
  and epithelial migration. This schematic diagram summarizes the data on mechanisms
  of LMP2A-induced migration. LMP2A induced two distinct signaling pathways from the
  ITAM domain by activating Syk and Akt. Syk and Akt promoted translocation of αV-integrin
  to membrane-enriched compartments of epithelial cells and subsequent activation
  of FAK and Src to control migration. A separate signaling pathway initiated by Akt
  through inhibition of GSK3β may also relieve an inhibitory phosphorylation of FAK
  to promote migration. TCN, triciribine; FAKI, FAK inhibitors; PP2, Src inhibitor.
