caption: Potential EVOO extracts mechanism of action. Upon cell penetration, EVOO
  extracts (BUO and OMN) act as competitive inhibitor of HMGCoAR leading to a reduction
  of intracellular cholesterol synthesis. When intracellular cholesterol level decreases,
  the transcription factor SREBP2 is activated and LDLR and HMGCoAR genes are transcripted
  with subsequent increase of LDLR and HMGCoAR protein levels and localization of
  LDLR in plasma membrane (a). In parallel, evidences suggest that in a synergic way,
  BUO and OMN are able to reduce the cholesterol level production through AMPK-pathway.
  In particular, both EVOO extracts activate AMPK through an increase of phosphorylation
  at Thr172, which in turn leads to an inactivation of its target substrate HMGCoAR
  through phosphorylation at serine 872 (b). For this reason, the distinct modulation
  of the two pathways leads to an increase of the LDLR activity, which can bind and
  carry the extracellular LDL in HepG2 cells with final hypocholesterolaemic effects.
