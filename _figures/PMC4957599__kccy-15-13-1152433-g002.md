caption: The molecular mechanism of disc cell senescence. The molecular mechanism
  underlying disc cell senescence includes 2 aspects, the arrest of cell cycle and
  the development of the senescent phenotype of disc cells. The p53-p21-Rb pathway
  and the p16-Rb pathway play major roles in the cell cycle arrest. Both pathways
  are activated by telomere shortening, DNA damage response or various stressful stimuli
  in the microenvironment of degenerative discs respectively. SIRT1 plays a protective
  role in disc cell senescence by suppressing p53 and p16. Caveoline-1 synergizes
  with p53 and p16 to accelerate disc cell senescence. The p38-MAPK pathway responds
  to various stimuli to activate the p53-p21-Rb and p16-Rb pathways. WNT-β-catenin
  pathway induces disc cell senescence. A positive-feedback loop of WNT signaling
  and cytokines enhances the pro-senescence effects of WNT-β-catenin pathway. Moreover,
  the mTOR pathway is required for cells to acquire the senescent phenotype.
