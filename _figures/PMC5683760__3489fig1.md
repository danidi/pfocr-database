caption: 'Overview of the Cox1 synthesis and assembly pathway. Cox1 is synthesized
  on mitoribosomes tethered to the inner membrane at the site of the cotranslation
  insertion machinery containing the Oxa1 protein. Synthesis of Cox1 is promoted on
  activation by the translational activators Mss51 (and Pet309, not depicted) by their
  binding to the 5′-UTR of the COX1 mRNA. Following insertion into the membrane, the
  newly synthesized Cox1 protein forms an assembly intermediate with COX-specific
  assembly factors, including Cox14 and Coa3, which support the recruitment of Mss51
  and its binding to the C-terminal end of the Cox1 protein. Further maturation of
  Cox1 (e.g., incorporation of heme) and assembly with nuclear encoded COX partner
  subunits, facilitated by specific chaperones, leads to the assembly of Cox1 into
  the active COX enzyme and promotes the release of Mss51, which in turn activates
  the next round of Cox1 synthesis. Abbreviations: IM, inner mitochondrial membrane;
  IMS, intermembrane space; Matrix, mitochondrial matrix space.'
