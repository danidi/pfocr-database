caption: Major Regulatory Networks Governing the Floral Transition.(A) Environmental
  and endogenous floral promoting signals stimulate increasing expression of the floral
  pathway integrator genes FT and LFY. Rising levels of FT and LFY proteins stimulate
  the expression of floral meristem identity genes, such as AP1, leading to the specification
  of flowers.(B) Regulatory interactions in the core network, including activities
  verified experimentally in this work. FDP acts redundantly with FD to activate flowering.
  LFY directly binds the FD promoter, accounting for the increase in FD expression
  upon the floral transition. The TFL1 floral repressive signal is mediated by FD.(C)
  A network of five regulatory hubs captures the major properties of the floral transition.
  Hubs are denoted by underlining, and reflect the likely activity of multiple genes
  in the plant. For example, the FT hub encompasses the activity of at least FT and
  TSF, the FD hub FD and FDP, while AP1 includes the biological activity of AP1, CAULIFLOWER,
  and FRUITFULL.
