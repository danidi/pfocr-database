caption: TM expression is increased soon after PMA induction in THP-1 cells. TM may
  regulate PMA-induced THP-1 cell differentiation via a direct interaction with PKCδ.
  TM acts as a scaffold for PKCδ docking, which keeps PKCδ in the region close to
  the membrane and promotes subsequent ERK1/2 activation. ERK1/2 activation subsequently
  enhances the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1/WAF1 via NF-kB p65 signaling,
  which causes cell cycle arrest and promotes differentiation. On the other hand,
  ERK1/2 activation participates in the phosphorylation of paxillin, cofilin, LIMK1,
  and PYK2, which interact with TM and mediate cytoskeleton remodeling to promote
  differentiation.
