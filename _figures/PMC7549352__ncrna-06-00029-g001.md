caption: 'miRNA biogenesis: the canonical pathway begins with the transcription of
  miRNA genes to form the pri-miRNA. Pri-miRNA is further processed by the Drosha–DiGeorge
  Syndrome Critical Region 8 (Drosha–DGCR8) complex to produce precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA).
  Non-canonical pathway, mirtrons bypass the Drosha cleavage and instead, is cleaved
  by the intron-lariat-debranching enzymes. Both the pre-miRNAs are then transported
  to the cytoplasm by the Exportin5/RanGTP complex and cleaved to produce mature miRNA.
  The miRNA duplex consists of guide miRNA (black strand) and passenger miRNA (red
  strand). The guide miRNA binds the Ago protein and RNA-induced silencing complex
  (RISC)-associated proteins to form the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC)
  complex while the passenger miRNA (red strand) is degraded. Guide miRNA facilitates
  the miRISC complex binding to mRNA targets. Perfect or near perfect complementarity
  of the guide miRNA to mRNA targets results in the direct cleavage by miRISC. Partial
  complementarity to the target site can result in translational suppression by interfering
  with the ElF4A/E/G complex. The miRISC complex binds to 3’-UTR elements of mRNA
  and recruit PAN2/3 and CCR4-NOT to induce mRNA deadenylation and eventually, its
  degradation. Alternatively, GW182 proteins can interact with miRISC and induce translational
  repression.'
