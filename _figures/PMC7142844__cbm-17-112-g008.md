caption: Schematic diagram of the molecular mechanisms of SNRPG-mediated p53 targeting
  of TMZ-induced glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) growth inhibition. The SNRPG-mediated
  inhibitory effect on glioma cells might have been due to the direct suppression
  of Myc as well as p53 and the ensuing modification of their downstream molecules
  including p21, CDK2, CCNB1, and cdc2, possibly promoting apoptosis and cell cycle
  arrest by interacting directly or indirectly with related proteins. Specifically,
  SNRPG suppression promoted the cytosolic translocalization of Myc, as well as the
  nuclear translocalization of p53. Furthermore, knockdown of SNRPG in GBM cells promoted
  the inhibitory effect of TMZ on cell proliferation by targeting Myc through the
  p53 signaling pathway, suggesting its regulatory effect on TMZ sensitivity. Besides,
  SNRPG decreased the protein expression of the mismatch repair (MMR) protein MLH1
  and increased MGMT methylation, which could all be well-established mechanisms of
  TMZ resistance. These findings could indicate that SNRPG-driven systemic Myc-regulated
  p53 activation and sensitization of GBM cells to TMZ are highly promising strategies
  for treating glioma.
