caption: 'Revised FR-900098 pathway. Each of the final steps in the FR-900098 biosynthetic
  pathway has been demonstrated in vitro using purified enzymes. Intermediates in
  the FR-900098 biosynthetic pathway are as follows: I, phosphoenolpyruvate; II, phosphonopyruvate;
  III, 2-phosphonomethylmalate; IV, 3-phosphonomethylmalate; V, 2-oxo-4-phosphonobutyrate;
  VI, 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate; VII, CMP-5''-3-aminopropylphosphonate; VIII, CMP-5''-N-hydroxy-3-aminopropylphosphonate;
  IX. CMP-5''-FR-900098.'
