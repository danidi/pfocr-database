caption: Full lines, H4MPT-dependent pathway, H4F-dependent pathway, serine cycle
  and ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for glyoxylate regeneration; broken line, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle reactions (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (and a dissimilatory
  TCA cycle) are not essential for methylotrophic growth , ). Key pathway outputs  used
  for carbon assimilation (biomass production) are shown in bold italics. Genes involved
  in the serine cycle, the TCA cycle and in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway are indicated.
  Genes given on the same line and not separated by hyphens are closely associated
  on the chromosome. Genes and their arrangement on the chromosome are strongly conserved
  in strains AM1 and DM4 (see Suppl. ), except the mau cluster for methylamine utilization
  and the dcm cluster for dichloromethane utilization which are unique to strain AM1
  and strain DM4, respectively.
