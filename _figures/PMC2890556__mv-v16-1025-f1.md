caption: 'Schematic representation of γ-glutamyl cycle in the bovine lens epithelial-cortical
  layer. Numbers refer to enzymes involved in the cycle. 1: γ-glutamyltransferase;
  2: leucine amino peptidase; 3, γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase; 4: glutathione synthetase.
  “a” and “b” refer to glutathione and Cys-Gly transporters, respectively. The connection
  of the cycle with trans-sulfuration pathway (5: cystathionine γ-lyase) and the effect
  of possible modulators of the cycle are also reported. SB: serine /borate; PPG:
  propargylglycine; BSO: butionilsulfoximine. Inhibition or activation effects are
  indicated by “- “ or “+,” respectively. Dashed lines refer to the proposed effects
  on extralenticular GSSG accumulation exerted by exogenous GSH, Cys-Gly or/and its
  disulfide derivatives (OXCys-Gly) as emerged from our results.'
