caption: a, Structure of ceramide, with a sphingosine backbone. b, De novo sphingolipid
  biosynthesis starts with the condensation of palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA) and serine
  by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), an enzyme that is negatively regulated by
  ORM1-like protein 3 (ORMDL3). This is followed by a series of reactions (catalysed
  by enzymes in red) leading to formation of ceramide and subsequent formation of
  sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids. Ceramide can be metabolized to other bioactive
  sphingolipid species, phosphorylated by ceramide kinase (CERK) to ceramide-1-phosphate
  (C1P), or hydrolysed to sphingosine, which is then phosphorylated to sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P) by sphingosine kinases (SphKs). S1P can be degraded by phosphatases to sphingosine
  or by the lyase (SPL) that cleaves it to phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal, which
  are subsequently reincorporated into glycerolipid metabolic pathways. For simplicity,
  degradative enzymes (blue) for reutilization of sphingolipids in the salvage pathway
  are included but these reactions take place in different subcellular compartments
  (see ). CDase, ceramidase; CerS, ceramide synthase; GCase, glucosylceramidase; GCS,
  glucosylceramide synthase; Pase, phosphatase; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  SMase, sphingomyelinase; SMS, sphingomyelin synthase; SPPase, sphingosine phosphate
  phosphatase.
