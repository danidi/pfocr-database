caption: Schematic illustration of the Sprouty-mediated regulation of cell proliferation,
  differentiation, and survival irrespective of the Sprouty isoform and cell type.
  Sprouty activity is resulted from or regulated through interaction with a number
  of players. This interaction impacts functionality of ERK and other signaling pathways.
  Sprouty binds c-Cbl and CIN85 and sequestrate c-Cbl to augment and prolong RTK signaling
  by inhibiting receptor endocytosis. This mechanism has been implicated in cell differentiation.
  E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, on the other hand, binds and induces degradation of Sprouty
  to restrict ERK activation. Sprouty has also been shown to interact with different
  phosphatases. It increases active contents of PTEN to mediate antiproliferative
  actions by inhibiting Akt activation. PTEN is also phosphorylated and accumulated
  in the nucleus in response to the Sprouty deficiency to induce p53-mediated growth
  arrest independently of its phosphatase activity. It is likely that the proto-oncogenic
  potential of NEDD4 is resulted in part from its ability to ubiquitinate both Sprouty
  and PTEN, resulting in unchecked activation of Akt. Sprouty also increases PTP1B
  content. However, there is no evidence of direct interaction between Sprouty and
  PTP1B in RTK dephosphorylation. Phosphatases PP2A and SHP2 differentially regulate
  the Sprouty activity. Although PP2A potentiates Sprouty binding to Grb2 and thus
  positively regulates Sprouty by serine dephosphorylation, SHP2 promotes dissociation
  of Sprouty from Grb2 through tyrosine dephosphorylation and checks Sprouty inhibition
  of ERK. Moreover, interaction between Sprouty and kinases yields different outcomes.
  DYRK1A is considered a negative regulator of the Sprouty activity by threonine phosphorylation.
  TESK1 interferes with Sprouty/Grb2 interaction as well as with Sprouty serine dephosphorylation
  by PP2A, thereby attenuating Sprouty functioning. Sprouty isoforms also exhibit
  differential cooperativity with Cav-1 to repress growth factor activation of ERK.
  At low cell density, however, Cav-1 inhibits the Sprouty function. Sprouty is a
  general inhibitor of PLC-dependent signaling and inhibits various PKC upstream and
  downstream signals, including PIP2 hydrolysis. Sprouty is an interacting partner
  of the Gα o/GRIN pathway. GRIN modulates Sprouty repression of ERK by binding and
  sequestering Sprouty. Activated Gαo, on the other hand, promotes inhibition of ERK
  via interacting with GRIN and releasing Sprouty. Finally, interaction among the
  Sprouty isoforms is a mechanism through which oligomers with more potent activity
  can form. Cav Caveolin-1; c-Cbl canonical Casitas B-lineage lymphoma; CIN85 Cbl-interacting
