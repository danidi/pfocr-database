caption: Redox regulation of cell–cell junctions. HIF-1α can be hydroxylated by PHD
  and subsequently undergoes degradation by interacting with pVHL. ROS inhibit the
  activity of PHD to stabilize HIF-1α, thus inducing the transcription of Snail and
  Twist. Moreover, ROS promote the IKK-mediated degradation of IκB and induce the
  nuclear translocation of NF-κB, leading to the transcriptional activation of Snail,
  Slug, Twist and ZEB1/2. However, ROS also inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway by
  oxidizing p50 in the nucleus. ROS can also activate the TGF-β signaling pathway
  by enhancing the dissociation of LAP from TGF-β. Furthermore, ROS promote ASK1 activation
  by inhibiting the association of ASK1 and Trx, leading to the activation of Smad.
  In addition, p53 can be phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress, leading
  to the formation of p53/Smad/p300 complex, which initiates the transcription of
  Snail, Twist and MMPs. HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase;
  pVHL, Von Hippel-Lindau protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IKK, IκB kinase;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; ZEB1/2, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1/2; TGF-β,
  transforming growth factor β; Trx, thioredoxin; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1; LAP, latency-associated protein; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases.
