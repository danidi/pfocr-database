caption: 'Multiple genes involved in interferon production and regulation are associated
  with risk for lupus.  Shown are components of the signal transduction pathway from
  TLR stimulation by nucleic acids to IFN production.  Genes that have been associated
  with risk for lupus are marked (*).  IFN: interferon, IRAK: interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase, IRF: interferon regulatory factor, MyD88: myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88, OPN: osteopontin, pDC: plasmacytoid dendritic cell, TLR: toll-like
  receptor, TNFAIP3: tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 3, TNIP1: TNFAIP3
  interacting protein 1, and TRAF6: tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
