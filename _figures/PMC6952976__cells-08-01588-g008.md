caption: ANT1-TG cardiomyocytes are highly sensitive to the TLR4-mediated AKT pathway
  activated by exHSP27. HSP27 is a component of the ANT1-specific protein-protein
  network, which disappears during hypoxia. ANT1-TG cardiomyocytes react to hypoxia
  with an increased release of HSP27 protein. This extracellular HSP27 activates TLR4
  and downstream AKT signaling. The HSP27-mediated TLR4 signaling subsequently induces
  HSP27 and ANT1 expression that support the stabilization of ∆ψm and the inhibition
  of caspase-3/7 activity, thereby leading to cell protection. Blue arrows indicate
  activation/increase, red lines indicate inhibition, and dashed arrows indicate release.
