caption: Examples of the modules identified in the ESP EMAP dataset. (A) The module
  is enriched in the N-Glycan biosynthesis pathway in KEGG; (B) the module is enriched
  in the cellular lipid metabolic process in GO; (C) the module possibly carries cross
  talk between pathways. The figure was produced using Cytoscape ().
