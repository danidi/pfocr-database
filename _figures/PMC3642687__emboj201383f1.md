caption: Pathway of reversible protein modification reactions that involve NAD+ consumption.
  Consumption of NAD+ through nicotinamide cleavage drives the catalysis of mono-
  and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins by ADP-ribosyl transferases, as well as deacetylation
  of proteins by Sirtuins. Formation of these modifications is important to various
  cell signalling events such as DNA repair, chromatin remodelling, transcription,
  telomere homeostasis, and cell death. ADP-ribose modifications are short-lived due
  to the activity of hydrolase enzymes reversing the modification to yield ADP-ribose.
  The recently identified macrodomains C6orf130/TARG, MacroD1, and MacroD2 now fill
  in previously unidentified roles of ADP-ribose and PAR hydrolysis from acidic residues.
