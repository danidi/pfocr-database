caption: Regulation of the parallel pathways that regulate the NER response to UV.
  Pathway I is regulated by Rad23 and operates independently of de novo protein synthesis.
  Rad23 functions, in part, by attenuating the inhibitory effect of the 19S proteasome
  on the rate of lesion removal. Pathway II relies on de novo protein synthesis and
  the ubiquitination of Rad4 via the action of the ECS ligase, depicted in the centre
  of the figure. Subsequently, Rad4 is degraded via the 26S proteasome, with de novo
  synthesis eventually restoring Rad4 to its pre-UV levels.
