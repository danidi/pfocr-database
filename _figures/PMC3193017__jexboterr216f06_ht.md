caption: The putative model of anthocyanin and butein synthesis in MJOr and MJY. For
  simplicity, the 3′ hydroxylation pathway is abbreviated. (A) The model for MJOr.
  DvIVS can function, then DvCHS1, DvF3H, DvDFR, and DvANS are activated, and anthocyanidin,
  flavone, and butein are synthesized. (B) The model for MJY. Because of Tdv1 insertion,
  only truncated DvIVS mRNA is expressed and transcriptional regulation cannot function.
  Although DvCHS1, DvF3H, DvDFR, and DvANS are not activated, DvCHS2 and DvCHI are
  not affected by DvIVS, resulting in accumulation of flavone and butein.
