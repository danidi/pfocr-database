caption: 'A proposed model of Ca2+ signaling in PCV2-induced autophagy in PK-15 cells.
  PCV2-nduced autophagy likely results from activation of IP3R and elevation of cytosolic
  Ca2+, which then upregulates CaMKKβ with subsequent activation of its downstream
  molecules AMPK and CaMKI. Two branches of the CaMKKβ signaling pathway are involved:
  CaMKKβ/AMPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/tuberous sclerosis complex
  2 (TSC2)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and CaMKKβ/CaMKI/WIPI1 in PCV2-infected
  cells.'
