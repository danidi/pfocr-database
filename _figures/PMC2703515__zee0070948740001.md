caption: An emerging model for progesterone action in the human breast shares common
  features with a proposed paracrine mechanism of action model for progesterone in
  the rodent mammary gland (,,). Based on findings of Graham et al., (), the schematic
  outlines a hypothetical model to explain the role of progesterone (P4) signaling
  in the expansion and morphogenesis of the epithelial compartment in the human breast.
  A subset of mammary epithelial cells (red), which are PR positive, receive, transduce,
  and subsequently relay, in a paracrine fashion, the proliferative signal imparted
  by P4 hormone to a juxtacrine cell subgroup (green) that is PR negative. Gene profiling
  studies implicate the notch pathway as possibly one of a number of paracrine signals
  that project the proliferative effects of progesterone from PR-positive cells to
  a subset of PR-negative cells (green) that exhibit bipotent progenitor properties.
  Upon receiving paracrine signal inputs, the progenitor cell subtype reprograms and
  proliferates to generate both luminal and myoepithelial cell lineages. Luminal epithelial
  descendants can be positive or negative for PR expression, whereas myoepithelial
  cell are PR negative. Together, the expansion and differentiation of these cell
  lineages contribute to increased lobuloalveologenesis. Induction of DNA replication
  licensing factors, minichromosome maintenance proteins, and kinetochore formation
  proteins are possible early molecular changes that precede progesterone-induced
  progenitor cell reprogramming and subsequent proliferation.
