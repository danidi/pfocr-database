caption: Regulation of the p53 signaling pathway by binding and ubiquitylation of
  tumor-regulating proteins in GC. The solid arrows represent activation, and flat-headed
  arrows represent inhibition. MKRN1 induces the ubiquitination and degradation of
  p14ARF and then downregulates the expression of MDM2. MDM2, PIRH2, TRIM59 and COP1
  directly bind to p53, and they promote p53 degradation in the UPS to promote GC
  progression. Cullin1 facilitates P27 ubiquitination for degradation and then regulates
  cell cycle of GC. GC, gastric cancer; CRL4, cullin-RING ligase 4; COP1, constitutive
  photomorphogenic 1; MDM2, MDM2 proto-oncogene; MKRN1, makorin RING finger protein
  1; p14ARF, tumor suppressor ARF; PIRH2, RING finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing
  1; SPA1, suppressor of PHYA-1; TRIM59, tripartite motif; Ub, ubiquitin; UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome
  system. The solid arrows means activate, and the flat tipped arrows means inhibit.
