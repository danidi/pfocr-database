caption: 'Unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in mammalian cells. Under non endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress conditions, BIP (immunoglobulin binding protein) is bound
  to the ER stress transducers ATF6, IRE1 and PERK, repressing their activation. Following
  ER stress-induced UPR activation, BIP dissociates from ATF6, IRE1 and PERK, and
  the following events occur: ATF6 translocates to the Golgi apparatus where it is
  processed by site 1 protease (S1P) and S2P, resulting in the cleaved active transcription
  factor ATF6f; in contrast, IRE1 and PERK homodimerize and autophosphorylate, resulting
  in the generation of the transcription factors XBP-1s and ATF4, respectively. These
  transcription factors mainly up-regulate the adaptive UPR pathway and normalize
  ER function via activation of downstream pathways. ATF6f controls the up-regulation
  of genes encoding ER chaperones, as well as XBP-1, CHOP and ERAD components. XBP-1s
  is responsible for up-regulating ER chaperones, ERAD components, lipid biosynthesis
  and inflammatory response genes. ATF4 up-regulates genes involved in anti-oxidant
  responses and amino acid synthesis and transport. Activation of PERK can also lead
  to phosphorylation of NRF2, a transcription factor involved in anti-oxidant responses.
  Under long-term ER stress, the adaptive UPR pathway fails to rescue the cells, and
  the apoptotic UPR pathways, namely the IRE1–TRAF2–ASK1–JNK or the PERK–eIF-2α–ATF4–CHOP
  pathways, are induced. Abbreviations: ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1;
  ATF, activating transcription factor; ATF6f, activating transcription factor 6 fragment;
  CHOP, C/EBP-homologous protein; eIF-2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  2α; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; GADD34-PP1, complex
