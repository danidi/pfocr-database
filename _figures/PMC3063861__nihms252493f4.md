caption: 'GPCR can preferentially activate various signaling mechanisms following
  ligand stimulation. A) Binding of a biased ligand (purple: β arrestin bias; blue:
  G-protein bias), to an unbiased receptor results in a biased response activating
  either G-protein mediated or β-arrestin pathway. B) Similarly, binding of an unbiased
  ligand to the biased receptor (β-arrestin-biased in purple or G protein-biased in
  blue) also results in a biased response (Reproduced with permission from Ref []).'
