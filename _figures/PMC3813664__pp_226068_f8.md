caption: Model showing proposed molecular steps of the Pep immune signal transduction
  pathway. This pictorial model presents a schematic of proteins and signaling molecules
  (identified with letters a–j) involved in the proposed signal transduction cascade
  linking Pep perception by its cognate receptor PEPR to the induction of immune responses
  and activation of plant defense genes. The work presented in this report expands
  upon prior studies of plant immune responses to support a signaling cascade involving
  the following steps. a, Pep peptides bind to the extracellular leucine-rich repeat
  domain of the PEPR receptors; BAK1 contributes to Pep/PEPR signaling, probably as
  a coreceptor. b, There is a functional interaction between PEPR and FLS2 facilitated
  by an unknown mechanism (indicated by a question mark); BAK1 is also a coreceptor
  for FLS2. c, Pep perception by PEPR results in an increase in cytosolic , possibly
  due to a putative guanylyl cyclase activity of PEPR. d, Pep-dependent rise in cytosolic  activates
  the cell membrane Ca2+-conducting CNGC2 channel. e, CNGC2-mediated cytosolic Ca2+
  elevation results in Ca2+ binding to CPKs, CaM, and/or CML proteins. f, Ca2+ activation
  of CPKs results in increased expression of defense genes and activation of RBOHD
  and RBOHF, leading to the generation of , including superoxide and H2O2. g,  can
  act as an antimicrobial compound or cell-to-cell signal and also has effects on
  defense gene expression. h, Ca2+/CaM or a CML protein can lead to  generation by
  an unidentified -type enzyme ().  can act as a cell-to-cell signal and also modulate
  defense gene expression. i, Ca2+/CaM or a CML protein can feedback on CNGC currents
  and prevent further activation by cyclic nucleotides (; ). j, Flagellin/FLS2 interaction
  leads to immune responses separately from Pep/PEPR signaling (but as noted above,
  there is a functional interaction between the two pathways). Experimental results
  included in this report probed steps of the Pep/PEPR immune signaling cascade using
  the following pharmacological agents and Arabidopsis genotypes. 1, The dnd1 mutant
  lacks a full-length CNGC2 polypeptide, which impairs Ca2+ influx into the cell.
  2, The bak1-3 mutant was used to evaluate BAK1 involvement in flg22- and Pep-dependent
  Ca2+ elevation in aeq-expressing plants. The bak1-4 mutant was used to evaluate
  BAK1 involvement in Pep-dependent gene expression and bacterial growth suppression.
  Mutation of BAK1 compromised Pep-dependent Ca2+ elevation, gene expression, and
  immunization against growth of virulent bacteria. See “Materials and Methods” for
  information about bak1-3 and bak1-4 phenotypes. Effects of bak1-3 and bak1-4 mutations
  on flg22-dependent gene expression and immune signaling were reported by . 3, Null
  mutation of FLS2 affected both flg22- and Pep-dependent  and  generation. 4, Null
  mutation of PEPR1 impaired both pep- and flg22-dependent  and  generation. 5, Pep-dependent
  gene expression was impaired in the cpk5 cpk6 cpk11 triple null mutant (and by kinase
  inhibitors). Null mutation of these CPK genes also compromised the ability of Pep
  to immunize the plant against growth of virulent bacteria. The cpk5 cpk6 cpk11 triple
  null mutant also affects flg22 defense signaling. 6, Pep-dependent defense gene
  expression and immunization against virulent bacterial growth was compromised in
  the noa1 mutant, which lacks the ability to generate  in response to external stimuli.
  Defense gene expression downstream from flg22 perception was affected by the noa1
  mutation in a fashion similar to effects on Pep/PEPR signaling. 7, Pep-dependent
  defense gene expression and Pep-induced immunization of the plant against growth
  of virulent bacteria were compromised in the rbohD/rbohF double mutant. In contrast
  to Pep/PEPR signaling, the rbohD/rbohF double mutation did not affect flg22-dependent
  defense gene expression. 8, Application of W7 leads to increased expression of pathogen
  defense gene expression without Pep application; this could be due to W7 antagonism
  of CaM function, leading to increased CNGC currents at ambient levels of cyclic
  nucleotide. 9, Application of the GC inhibitor LY83538 impairs Pep-dependent defense
  gene expression. 10, Application of the cyclic nucleotide  inhibitor  results in
  increased expression of WRKY33 without Pep application; this might be due to an
  increase in ambient cell  because breakdown of the cyclic nucleotide is impaired.
  11, Application of the  scavenger  impairs Pep-dependent defense gene expression.
  12, Application of the kinase inhibitor K252a impaired Pep-dependent defense gene
  expression, possibly due to inhibition of CPKs or other kinases involved in the
  signaling pathway. The kinase inhibitor K252a also blocks flg22 signaling (; ).

    this could be due to W7 antagonism of CaM function, leading to increased CNGC

    K252a also blocks flg22 signaling (; ).
