caption: 'Model of TNF-elicited O2−generation in adherent neutrophils: role of δ-PKC.
  In adherent neutrophils, binding of TNF and ligation of integrins lead to cooperative
  signaling and the activation of PI3K. Activation of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway modifies
  the phosphorylation pattern of δ-PKC and subsequent δ-PKC activity and substrate
  specificity. These post-translational modifications of δ-PKC promote recruitment
  of δ-PKC to p47phox, activation of ERK, and phosphorylation of p47phox. Phosphorylation
  and activation of p47phox lead to assembly of the NADPH oxidase and generation of
  O2−.'
