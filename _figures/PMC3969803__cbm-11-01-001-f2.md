caption: 'Summary of key changes in cancer metabolic reprogramming. Cancer metabolic
  reprogramming is characterized by enhanced glycolysis, PPP, lipid metabolism, glutaminolysis,
  mitochondrial biogenesis, among others. These pathways provide cancer cells with
  not only essential energy but also important precursors to support large-scale biosynthesis,
  rapid proliferation, continuous growth, tissue invasion, metastasis, survival and
  resistance to anti-cancer therapies. For instance, glycolysis generates 2 ATP per
  glucose consumed and provides materials for PPP and other biosynthetic programs.
  Similarly, PPP supplies tumors with ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH. Ribose-5-phosphate
  is a major element for nucleotide synthesis, which is used in DNA replication, RNA
  synthesis, and DNA damage repair, among others. NADPH is a key line of defense counteracting
  oxidative stress and a crucial metabolite for a number of biosynthesis reactions.
  NADPH is produced by 4 biochemical reactions mediated by G6PD, 6PLGD, ME1 and IDH1.
  In addition, fatty acid synthesis is indispensable for formation of new cellular
  membranes and proliferation. A number of fatty acid synthesis enzymes such as ACC,
  ACLY and FASN are upregulated or activated by oncogenes such as c-Myc, HIF-1α, Akt,
  among others. On the other hand, FAO is also important for cancer cells because
  it generates energy, NADPH and other necessary metabolites. Fatty acids are imported
  into mitochondria by CPT1 and oxidized to generate acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA fuels
  the TCA cycle to generate NADH and FADH2. The latter metabolites donate electrons
  to mitochondrial ETC for ATP generation. CPT1 also antagonizes Bax and Bad-mediated
  apoptosis by preventing the formation of mitochondrial membrane transition pores
  and reducing cytochrome c release. Citrate produced by the TCA cycle can be transported
  from mitochondria to cytosol. Cytosolic citrate is used in a number of reactions
  to produce acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate and isocitrate. These metabolites are important
  for lipid synthesis, NAPDH production, and many other central cellular processes.
  Mitochondrial biogenesis is also a striking feature of cancer metabolic reprogramming.
  Mitochondria are not only the energy generators but also the factories for synthesizing
  many essential metabolites for cancer growth, proliferation and metastasis. In addition,
  the metabolic lactate-based symbiosis is another remarkable characteristic of cancer
  metabolism. Cancer cells frequently upregulate LDHA to facilitate the conversion
  of pyruvate to lactate. Lactate is then secreted to tumor microenvironment via MCT4
  transporters and can be taken by neighboring cancer cell thanks to MCT1 importers.
  Lactate is thereafter used for other metabolic pathways in tumors. This metabolic
  symbiosis facilitates the survival of cancer cells in harsh conditions. Thus, metabolic
  reprogramming is a major cancer hallmark. It is characterized by the upregulation
  of a number of inter-connected metabolic pathways providing cancer cells with vital
  energy and metabolites. This metabolic plasticity is essentially important because
  it allows cancer cells to effectively and rapidly adapt to the rapidly changing
  conditions of tumor microenvironment. In addition, the flexibility of cancer bioenergetics
  also enables rapid proliferation, continuous growth, invasion, metastasis and resistance
  to anti-cancer therapies. Therefore, further knowledge about cancer metabolic reprogramming
  is very important for successful development of precise and efficacious anti-cancer
  metabolism therapies. Dashed arrows indicate indirect effects or multi-step processes.
