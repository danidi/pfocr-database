caption: A working model for CILK1 signalling. The activity of CILK1 can be regulated
  by phosphorylation of the TDY motif and the conserved N-terminal regulatory site
  Tyr15. CILK1 is localized to the primary cilium, which provides a unique cellular
  environment with higher concentration of second messengers such as calcium and cyclic
  AMP, and many signalling outputs such as GPCR, Hedgehog, PDGFRα, TGFβ, and WNT.
  How CILK1 is up and down regulated in this unique signalling environment is largely
  unknown. Four candidate substrates (KIF3A, Scythe, Raptor, and GSK3β) for CILK1
  have been identified that can potentially mediate CILK1 effect on cilia structure,
  signalling, and function. (1) KIF3A is in the kinesin II motor complex that mediates
  anterograde IFT (intraflagellar transport), which is essential for cilia formation
  and maintenance. (2) Scythe is a co-chaperone protein that has a critical role in
  autophagy by modulating the acetylation of p53 and ATG7. Autophagy regulates ciliogenesis
  by controlling the levels of ciliary proteins IFT20 and OFD1 through autophagic
  degradation. (3) Raptor is a key regulatory protein for mTOR in mTORC1, which can
  regulate cilia length or ciliogenesis through an unknown mechanism. (4) GSK3β is
  a positive regulator of ciliogenesis and ciliary Hedgehog signalling pathway. How
  these substrates mediate CILK1 effects on cilia morphology and function is still
  poorly defined.
