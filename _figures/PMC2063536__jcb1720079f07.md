caption: ES cell–based model describing the ontogeny of NSCs. When placed in minimal
  conditions, free of inhibitory influences, ES cells will acquire a primitive NSC
  identity through a default mechanism. This transition is negatively regulated by
  TGFβ signaling. The nascent primitive NSC then undergoes a separate survival challenge
  in these minimal conditions, with apoptosis mediated primarily by the Apaf1–Cas9
  pathway as well as contribution by the AIF apoptosis pathway. Survival can be promoted
  by NAC and cAMP, which mediate their effects largely through abrogation of the Apaf1–Cas9
  pathway. In the presence of LIF, the primitive NSC remains in an undifferentiated,
  proliferative state and generates a primitive NS containing a subpopulation of more
  mature (FGF2 dependent) definitive NSCs. Upon dissociation of the primitive NS,
  the definitive NSCs will proliferate in an FGF2-dependent manner to generate an
  NS. In the presence of FGF2, this self-renewal passaging can be performed repeatedly.
  With the addition of serum, the NS can be differentiated to produce neurons, astrocytes,
  and oligodendrocytes.
