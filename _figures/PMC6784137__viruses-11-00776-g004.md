caption: Interactions between autophagy and immunity in response to viral infection.
  ① Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) adsorbs onto the cell surface and triggers
  the recruitment of the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) adapter protein
  through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR9, resulting in the activation of autophagy
  in human acute myeloid leukemia (THP-1) cells. ② M11 binds to autophagy-related
  genes (ATG) to inhibit autophagy, viral-induced systemic inflammation, and interferon
  (IFN)-γ production in T cells. ③ It has been demonstrated that lysosomal-dependent
  Beclin-2 reduces viral G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) levels and viral GPCR-induced
  IL-6 signaling. ④ The murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) protein M45 binds to NF-κB kinase
  subunit gamma (NEMO/IKKγ) and is delivered to autophagosomes and transported to
  lysosomes for degradation, resulting in attenuation of the host inflammatory response.
  ⑤ Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) infected with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) release
  type I IFNs in response to TLR activation and autophagy. ⑥ HSV-2 infectious cell
  culture protein 10 (ICP10) is delivered to the autophagosome/lysosomal degradation
  pathway, thereby significantly increasing major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
  class I and class II antigen presentation. ⑦ HSV-1 ICP34.5 and its Beclin-binding
  domain suppress DC autophagy and increase MHC class II presentation capacity.⑧ ICP34.5-mediated
  autophagy inhibits the presentation of endogenous viral antigens to MHC class I
  molecules in primary DCs.
