caption: Schematic representation of the steps of coagulation factor activation (indicated
  by solid arrows) leading to thrombin formation and the corresponding steps of inhibition
  (indicated by broken arrows).Coagulation factors are represented by roman numbers.
  TF, tissue factor. AT, antithrombin. TM-APC-PS, thrombomodulin-activated protein
  C-protein S. TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor.
