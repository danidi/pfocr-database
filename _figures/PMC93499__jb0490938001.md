caption: Heme biosynthesis. The heme biosynthetic pathway consists of 10 reactions
  by which glutamate is converted to heme; minor branches lead to siroheme and cobalamin.
  Glutamyl-tRNA reductase (HemA) is considered the first committed enzyme in the heme
  pathway since the vast majority (>99%) of charged tRNAGlu is used for protein synthesis.
  Mutants defective in either hemA or hemL require either ALA or both heme and cysteine
  supplementation for wild-type growth. In contrast to hemA mutants, hemL strains
  are leaky auxotrophs and can adapt to growth in the absence of supplementation,
  as described previously ().
