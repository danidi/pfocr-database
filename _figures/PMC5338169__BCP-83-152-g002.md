caption: 'The role of the endothelial cell and monocyte in early stages of atherosclerosis:
  potential mechanisms of milk derived bioactive peptides. Activated ECs express selectins
  (P‐selectin and E‐selectin) and cell adhesion molecules (VCAM‐1 and ICAM‐1), which
  mediate the rolling and firm adhesion of the monocyte along the vessel wall. Firmly
  adhered monocytes undergo transendothelial monocyte migration from the lumen to
  the intima in response to chemokines such as MCP‐1. Upon entering the underlying
  intima the monocyte is exposed to the growth factor MCS‐F, which differentiates
  the monocyte into a macrophage. Macrophage differentiation results in the up‐regulation
  of the scavenger receptors, CD36 and SRA1, which are necessary for the subsequent
  formation of foam cells following the uptake of ox‐LDL and other modified lipids.
  Bioactive peptides have anti‐inflammatory effects on ECs by inhibiting activation
  of the NF‐κB pathway in a PPARγ dependent manner, and by modifying the expression
  of CCR2 and TLR4 receptors in monocytes'
