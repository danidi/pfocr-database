caption: Type-specific roles of inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) for cardiovascular
  development. Redundant roles of IP3R1 and IP3R2 in the development of atrioventricular
  cushion via calcineurin/NFATc signaling, and redundant roles of IP3R1 and IP3R3
  in the development of the right ventricle and outflow tract via the Mef2c-Smyd1
  pathway, and in the development of the extra-embryonic vessels of the placenta,
  allantois, and yolk sac are shown.
