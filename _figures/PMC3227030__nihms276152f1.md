caption: Nicotinamide, either derived from the degradation of NAD+ by NAD+ consuming
  enzymes or provided in the diet, is condensed with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate
  to yield nicotinamide mononucleotide under the catalysis of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.
  Nicotinamide mononucleotide is then adenylylated to form NAD+, by Nicotinamide mononucleotide
  adenylyltransferase. NAD+ and NADH can be interconverted by a reduction and an oxidation
  reaction, respectively.
