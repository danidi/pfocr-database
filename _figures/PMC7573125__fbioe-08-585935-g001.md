caption: 'Schematic illustration of the maFACR engineering strategy and metabolic
  pathway for the fatty acyl-CoA-dependent production of alkanes and alkenes (ALKs)
  in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (A) maFACR converts fatty acyl-CoA to alcohol
  without releasing the aldehyde intermediate. It putatively has two distinct domains:
  a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FACR) domain for reducing fatty acyl-CoA to aldehyde
  and a fatty aldehyde reductase (FALDR) domain to reduce aldehyde to fatty alcohol.
  The FALDR domain has catalytic residues A1, A2, and A3, which are found in this
  work to be Ser126, Tyr152, and Lys156, respectively. (B) Mutating the FALDR catalytic
  residues A1, A2, and A3 with the S126D, Y152F, and K156A modifications, respectively,
  inactivates the domain, thus allowing the release of aldehyde from the enzyme. (C)
  The engineered aldehyde-forming maFACR* is employed for conversion of endogenous
  fatty acyl-CoAs to aldehydes in S. cerevisiae and subsequent production of ALKs
  by deformylation of the aldehydes with cADO. To improve aldehyde titer, a transcription
  regulator (TR) was deleted to increase fatty acyl-CoA production, and ADHs were
  inactivated to diminish reduction of aldehydes to alcohols. INO1, inositol-3-phosphate
  synthase.'
