caption: 'The hub gene TNFα is presented as the initial point of 3 pathways: TNFα-Bmp4-Serpine1-Gata6
  in red color (a pathway in neural and cardiac development), TNFα-Ptgs2-Bcl2 in green
  color (a pathway in skeletal development), and TNFα-IL6-Cntn1 in yellow color (a
  pathway in nervous system development). Green arrow, activation; straight line with
  red bar, inhibition. SI/C, SMA I vs. Control; SI/SIII, SMA I vs. SMA III.'
