caption: Multiple feedback loops contribute to commitment and progression through
  meiotic cell-cycle progression. A schematic representation of the hierarchy of translational
  regulatory pathways and feedback loops that function sequentially to control commitment
  and progression through Xenopus oocyte maturation. Major translational control proteins
  (Pumilio, Musashi and CPEB) are represented by ovals while their specific target
  mRNAs are represented by rectangles. These mRNAs represent a selection of known
  target mRNAs, and so should not be considered an inclusive list for each factor.
  Key signalling components and their relative position with regard to activation
  timing are shown within the network. MPF activation usually coincides with oocyte
  GVBD. Within this network, translation of Ringo and activation of Ringo/CDK trigger
  phosphorylation of Musashi1 on serine-297 and -322 (S297 and S322, respectively)
  (). Musashi then activates translation of the endogenous Musashi1 mRNA to establish
  a positive feedback loop (this study), as indicated. Musashi-dependent translation
  of the Mos mRNA leads to activation of MAP kinase signalling, which occupies a multi-nodal
  hub in the pathway. MAP kinase signalling can trigger phosphorylation of additional
  Musashi1 protein in a positive feedback loop (), can phosphorylate CPEB to prime
  it for activation by a serine-174 (S174) kinase (), and can phosphorylate and inhibit
  Myt1, leading toMPF activation (). MPF activation leads to activation of Aurora
  A (; ), which can further phosphorylate CPEB S174 (). MPF has also been reported
  to phosphorylate and stabilize Mos protein (). For the sake of clarity, two additional
  pathways where Ringo/CDK phosphorylates and inhibits Myt1 () and MPF phosphorylates
  and targets degradation of CPEB () have been omitted. See text for further details.
