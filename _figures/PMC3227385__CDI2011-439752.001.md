caption: Confluence of SABR and Immunotherapy. Apoptosis can be initiated by SABR-induced
  DNA damage and upregulation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. In addition, apoptosis
  can be triggered by SABR-induced damage to the cellular lipid membrane, which can
  induce ceramide formation and activate the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway. Thus, SAPK/JNK
  can upregulate PKR expression, which can induce MHC and cytokines via NF-κB. SABR
  can induce cellular expression of MHC Class I, adhesion molecules, costimulatory
  molecules, heat shock proteins, inflammatory mediators, immunomodulatory cytokines,
  and death receptors.
