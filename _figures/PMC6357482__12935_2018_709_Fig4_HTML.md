caption: Schema of miR-19a-3p regulated Fra-1 gene pathway. miR-19a-3p, which regulates
  TAMs in the breast tumor microenvironment, is able to regulate the phenotype of
  TAMs by targeting the Fra-1 gene and other genes in its downstream signaling pathway.
  IL-6 activates M2 polarization-related signal pathways of TAMs by inhibiting miR-19a-3p
  expression. The downregulation of miR-19a-3p expression in TAMs is likely due to
  TME induction, which promotes transformation of M1 to M2 and results in the enhancement
  of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
