caption: Simplified ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in T. cruzi epimastigotes. Gene
  names are annotated with bold letters, followed by their current annotation in the
  TriTrypDB. In brackets are the T. cruzi locus identifiers of complete genes, followed
  by the haplotype to which they belong (P = Non-Esmeraldo; S = Esmeraldo). Sequences
  that have been identified as incomplete or pseudogenes are not included. In the
  case of TcIDI and TcNDSDHL complete sequences can be found in GeneBank and their
  accession numbers were used in these cases. Sequences classified as highly druggable
  (druggability index >0.7) according to the Target-Pathogen database (http://target.sbg.qb.fcen.uba.ar/patho/)
  are shown with green letters. Known drug classes that block enzymes within this
  pathway are identified by yellow boxes with blue letters. The only inhibitors that
  have gone clinical evaluation are shown in a green box with white letters. In a
  red box is highlighted the enzyme known to be essential in T. cruzi, and in orange
  boxes are highlighted enzymes that are essential in other trypanosomatids. Enzymes
  that have been genetically manipulated to evaluate their potential role as therapeutic
  targets in T. cruzi (§), T. brucei (*), or Leishmania (♯) have been annotated with
  a symbol.
