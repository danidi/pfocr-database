caption: Schematic of selenoprotein synthesis. As reviewed in Section II.B, in order
  for UGA to encode for selenocysteine insertion and not translational termination,
  the selenoprotein mRNAs require a downstream stem loop structure, the SECIS. The
  SECIS element binds SBP-2, which in turn interacts with a selenocysteine-specific
  elongation factor, EFsec. EFsec also binds the selenocysteine tRNA (Sec-tRNASec)
  and promotes selenocysteine incorporation in the elongating protein by the ribosome
  at the UGA codon. An additional SECIS binding protein, L30, can displace SBP-2 and
  anchor the loaded SECIS complex to the ribosome. The role of SECp43 remains to be
  defined; however this protein has been shown either to interact directly with or
  facilitate the interaction between many components needed for selenoprotein synthesis.
  The recently defined mammalian pathway of selenocysteine synthesis is also illustrated
  in the lower part of the figure, with the tRNASec initially being misacylated with
  serine, which is then phosphorylated by phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec kinase (PSTK).
  SLA then dephosphorylates this serine, which is then followed by acceptance of active
  selenium generated via SPS-2.
