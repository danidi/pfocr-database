caption: Signal pathway activation by different surface PRRs. All known PRRs activate
  MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways but may differ in the extent to which they activate
  these pathways or which combination of these pathways are activated, thus allowing
  differences in the responses generated. Here we show the different upstream mechanisms
  by which different families of PRRs activate these pathways. TLRs are the best-described
  family and utilize Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter proteins such as
  MyD88, MAL, TRAM, and TRIF. The other surface PRRs usually signal using ITAM and
  ITIM domains. Examples of ITAM domain-containing PRRs include the C-type lectin
  dectin-1. These proteins either contain an ITAM domain within their cytoplasmic
  region (as with dectin-1) or associate with an ITAM-containing transducing protein
  (e.g., dectin-2 with FcRγ). Dectin-1 utilizes Src kinases and Syk kinase to activate
  a complex containing CARD9, MALT1, and Bcl10 to activate the downstream signal pathways.
  ITIM domain-containing PRRs are generally considered to be inhibitory, activating
  the inhibitory phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, although there is some evidence to suggest
  that they may also play a role in activation. Examples of these proteins include
  the S-type lectins or Siglecs.
