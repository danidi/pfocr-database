caption: L1 retrotransposition and silencing pathways. L1 mobilization requires the
  key steps of transcription, mRNA export to the cytoplasm, translation, ribonucleoprotein
  particle formation, entry into the nucleus and, finally, integration. The Piwi‐induced
  methylation silencing pathway involves a selective amplification cycle fuelled by
  Piwi‐mediated cleavage of L1 transcripts. The repeat‐associated small interfering
  RNA degradation pathway is regulated by the generation of siRNAs from dsRNAs by
  Dicer and the fragmentation of L1 RNAs by AGO family proteins. L1 integration is
  also inhibited by several host factors, including members of the APOBEC3 family.
  Proteins and RNAs implicated in L1‐silencing pathways are represented in blue. L1
  RNAs and proteins are represented in pink.
