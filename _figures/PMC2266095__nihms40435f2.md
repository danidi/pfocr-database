caption: Schematic presentation of the NF-κB signaling network in radiation-induced
  adaptive radioresistance. Fractional ionizing radiation can directly induce DNA
  damage causing double-strand breaks (DSB) and single-strand breaks (SSB). The damaged
  DNA activates nuclear ATM, which in turn translocates to the cytoplasm to activate
  NF-κB via regulation of IKK activity, resulting in the dissociation of IκB from
  the complex and then activation of NF-κB. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated
  in cells by IR not only induce DNA damage in the nucleus but also activate NF-κB
  via the TRAFs pathway. Therefore, NF-κB activation by both nuclear and cytoplasmic
  pathways seems to be necessary for up-regulation of IR-effector genes that include
  at least partial antiapoptotic and cell cycle elements. The NF-κB effector genes
  have been shown to be necessary for an enhanced cell survival when the irradiated
  cells are exposed again to IR. In addition, the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme
  MnSOD, which detoxifies superoxide free radicals in mitochondria, is regulated by
  NF-κB, which may play a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis,
  although the exact mechanism is to be elucidated.
