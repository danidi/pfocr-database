caption: Step-wise schematic depiction of the ion-translocation pathway of an H+-PPase
  monomer showing the synthesis of PPi. In Step 1, binding of the 2 Pi molecules causes
  conformational change that opens the gate and the exit channel (not shown), and
  a proton from the high concentration side binds to the glutamate (E301) residue,
  stabilizing at the transient state, the hydroxyl anion released upon PPi synthesis
  (Step 2). The gate and the exit channel close, and the proton moves via the proton
  wire constituted by the serially arranged K742 ◊ D294 ◊ R242 residues (Step 3).
  Finally, the synthesized PPi and the water molecule get released (Step 4), and the
  protein reverts to its resting state. It is noteworthy that the K742, D294, R242,
  and E301 residues are 100% conserved in the plant kingdom. D = Aspartic acid, R
  = Arginine, E = Glutamic acid, K = Lysine.
