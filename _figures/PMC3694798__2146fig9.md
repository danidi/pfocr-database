caption: 'RasC/TORC2 regulation by chemokine signaling. (A) cAMP binds receptor CAR1
  and induces dissociation of its coupled heterotrimeric G protein complex Gα2/βγ.
  Folate binds its receptor and dissociates its coupled heterotrimeric G protein complex
  Gα4/βγ. Both cAMP and folate use the same GefA-RasC axis to mediate AKT and PKBR1
  phosphorylation by TORC2. Because cAMP and folate do not exhibit cross-inhibition,
  we suggest that adaptation must occur upstream and independently of GefA/RasC, potentially
  via the cAMP and folate receptors and their respective G protein complexes. (B)
  Receptor stimulation leads to G protein activation and dissociation. Many downstream
  pathways in Dictyostelium require signaling via Gβγ, although involvement of Gα-GTP
  is not excluded. RasC-GTP is required to activate TORC2. Subsequently, TORC2 activity
  may be suppressed through 1) adaptive responses that are specific to individual
  receptor/G protein complexes or 2) inhibitory down-regulation of RasC-GTP levels.
  Adaptation: 1a) Negative feedback regulation after G protein activation; 1b) delayed
  feedforward activation of an inhibitory signal that can sequester or inactivate
  specific G protein subunits. RasC down-regulation: 2a) Negative feedback regulation
  of the GefA activator (); 2b) slow, feedforward activation of an inhibitory rasGAP
  (; ). 3) Because folate and cAMP are not cross-adaptive (), we propose that any
  inhibitory effects that are mediated via GefA (2a) or rasGAP (2b) must be transient,
  allowing reversal of GefA/rasGAP (or PPase) activity to an initial basal state (
  and Supplemental Figure S7). The adaptive receptor/G protein circuits (1) are thus
  the primary pathways that maintain ligand-specific desensitization of the RasC/TORC2
  pathway but coordinate with downstream signaling (2, 3).'
