caption: 'The different steps of the synthesis and transport of a GPI-anchored protein
  in yeasts or fungi. The first steps of GPI anchor biosynthesis occur in the ER or
  at its surface: synthesis of the GPI core structure and translation through the
  ER membrane of the future GpiP. The subsequent attachment of the protein onto the
  GPI anchor takes place in the ER lumen. Then the GpiPs follow the secretory pathway
  to be presented at the cell surface. The particularity of some fungi is an additional
  step in which the GPI anchor is cleaved after the glucosamine and the protein with
  the remnant part of the anchor is directed to the cell wall and covalently linked
  to β-1,6-glucan.'
