caption: Schematic of ANDV N and GnGc protein regulation of TBK1 signaling. TBK1 autophosphorylation
  and its activation of IRF3 by phosphorylation are vital downstream steps in the
  type I IFN signaling pathway leading to IFN induction following hantavirus infection
  (). The results of our collective studies revealed novel roles for the ANDV N and
  GnGc proteins in regulation of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling pathway responses that induce
  ISGs and IFN-β. ANDV N protein blocks TBK1 activation by inhibiting its autophosphorylation
  through a yet unknown mechanism that may involve regulation of TBK1 ubiquitination,
  dimerization, dephosphorylation, or recruitment to scaffolding protein complexes.
  ANDV GnGc does not inhibit TBK1 autophosphorylation but blocks TBK1-directed IRF3
  phosphorylation. Thus, ANDV carries genes encoding two virulence determinants, the
  N and GnGc proteins, which restrict IFN induction by impeding discrete steps in
  TBK1-directed signaling responses that mediate RIG-I/MDA5-directed type I IFN induction.
