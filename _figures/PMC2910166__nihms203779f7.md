caption: Genetic epistasis suggests that eIF4H/drr-2 acts downstream of TOR/let-363,
  sams-1 and rab-10 but parallel to the S6K pathway, which controls other DR mediators
  such as PHA-4 and HIF-1, to influence protein translation and longevity. It is not
  clear, however, whether other translation initiation factors (eIFs), such as eIF4E/ife-2
  and eIF4G/ifg-1, act similarly as eIF4H/drr-2 to influence longevity in worms.
