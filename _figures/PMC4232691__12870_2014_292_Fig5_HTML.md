caption: 'Expression level of unigenes involved in MEP pathway. The number in green
  represents the expression level of a particular unigene in PGT (log2 of estimate
  abundance of transcripts by RSEM value). The number in red represents the fold change
  in expression level when compared to leaf-PGT (log2 fold change between PGT and
  leaf-PGT). In cases of enzymes with more than one unigene, the unigene with the
  highest abundance was taken into consideration. The number in brackets represents
  the number of unigenes identified for each enzyme in the pathway. DXS: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
  (DXP) synthase; DXR: DXP reductoisomerase, MCT:MEP cytidyltransferase, CMK:4-(cytidine
  5- diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase MCS: 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  (ME-2,4cPP) synthase, HDS: 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBPP) synthase,
  HDR: HMBPP reductase, IPPI : Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP,C5) Delta-isomerase.'
