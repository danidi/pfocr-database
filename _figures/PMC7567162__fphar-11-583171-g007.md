caption: 'Tripterygium ingredients could inhibit multiple pathways, such as the NF-κB
  pathway, JAK-STAT pathway, and PI3K-mTOR pathway, to regulate the hyperactive as
  well as pathogenicity biological functions in a various type of cells ( to ). In
  the initial phase, tripterygium ingredients inhibit the immunological recognition
  functions of APCs to block the pathogenicity signals which are responsible for activating
  the lymphocytes. In the secondary stage, tripterygium ingredients could inhibit
  the humoral immunity and cellular immunity of lymphocytes. Meanwhile, the pro-inflammatory
  signals are amplified by pro-inflammatory cells, such as macrophages. The pro-inflammatory
  cells release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to recruit and activate immune
  cells (i.e., APCs and T cells), connective tissue cells (i.e., macrophages and FLS)
  and OCs to infiltrate into the joints. Besides, the pro-inflammatory cells lead
  to a systemic inflammatory response, further promoting the pathogenicity signals
  of lymphocytes in central and peripheral immune organs. Tripterygium ingredients
  prohibit the pro-inflammatory signals, alleviate the infiltration and activation
  of pathogenicity cells in the joint, and finally interrupt the vicious circle which
  formed by pro-inflammatory cells and immune cells. In the final stage, tripterygium
  ingredients relieve the joint damage and bone destruction by mediating the expression
  of OPG and RANKL. Note: APC, Antigen-presenting cell; ACPA, Anti-citrullinated protein
  antibodies; FLS, Fibroblast-like synoviocytes; IL, Interleukin; OPG, Osteoprotegerin;
  RANKL, Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand; RF, Rheumatoid factor; TCR,
  T-cell receptor; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha.'
