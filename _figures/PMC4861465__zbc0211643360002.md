caption: Balanced and biased signaling by GPCRs. Top panel, in balanced signaling,
  both G protein-mediated and βarr-mediated signaling pathways are activated by the
  ligand·receptor complex. Bottom panel, in G protein- or βarr-biased signaling, one
  of the pathways is activated while the other pathway is blocked.
