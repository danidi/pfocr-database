caption: Schematic depicting an overview of the autophagy pathway and mechanisms used
  to manipulate autophagy. Activation of autophagy occurs upon the inhibition of the
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) in response to cell stress signals, such
  as low nutrient supply and genotoxic stress. Autophagy activation can be achieved
  by mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin or receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibition.
  This initiates a cascade of ATG protein complexes, beginning with the activation
  of the ULK1 and PI3KC3-C1 complexes and phagophore formation. PI3KC3-C1 activity
  can be chemically inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Elongation and closure of
  the phagophore results in autophagosome maturation and requires core ATG proteins,
  including ATG3, ATG4, ATG7, ATG5, ATG12 and ATG16L1, that can be genetically targeted
  to impede this maturation step. The final stage of the pathway involves the fusion
  of autophagosomes with lysosomes forming autolysosomes and resulting in the degradation
  of the cellular cargo by lysosomal hydrolases. The degradation products (including
  amino acids, fatty acids and sugars) are recycled and can be used to supply cellular
  metabolic needs. Chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and bafilomycin A1 (BafA1)
  are chemical inhibitors of lysosomal acidification that consequently block autophagic
  flux and lead to the accumulation of autophagosomes in cells.
