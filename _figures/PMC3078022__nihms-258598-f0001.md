caption: 'A). Pathway Switching: BRAF V600E melanoma cells chronically treated with
  BRAF inhibitors acquire drug resistance via switching between the three isoforms
  of RAF to activate the MAPK pathway. Establishment of IGFR1 and PDGFR signaling
  may also allow mutated BRAF to be bypassed. B) Pre-existing Clones: The presence
  of pre-existing mutations may affect the response of a tumor to BRAF kinase inhibition.
  NRAS mutated melanoma cells are not inhibited by BRAF inhibitors and may actually
  show increased growth, allowing the tumor to be repopulated. C) Intratumoral heterogeneity:
  Melanomas are highly heterogeneous tumors; a small subset of slow growing, JARID1b
  expressing melanoma cells have been observed with the ability to evade treatment,
  and may repopulate the heterogeneity of the tumor that existed prior to treatment.
  Targeted therapy toward the multiple phenotypes within a tumor may be required to
  adequately eliminate the whole tumor.'
