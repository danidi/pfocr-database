caption: 'Glucose and lipid metabolism in TAMs. TAMs exhibit a pronounced glycolytic
  signature enhanced lipid uptake and accumulation. Glucose-derived pyruvate is partly
  converted to acetyl-CoA by the PDH complex to fuel the TCA cycle, supporting OXPHOS.
  ATP, from both glycolysis and OXPHOS, can be used to activate the JAK–STAT6 pathway
  in M2-like activation. 2-DG inhibits TAM phenotype and function due to impaired
  OXPHOS in addition to glycolysis. Activation of the JAK–STAT6 pathway induces gene
  expression related to FAO and FA uptake. The caspase1-mediated cleavage of PPARγ
  attenuates MCAD activity, and FAO promotes LD formation. The elevated level of the
  scavenger receptor CD36 plays a crucial role in lipid uptake and accumulation in
  TAMs. The LD formation is essential for TAMs as a stable source of fatty acids for
  fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Acetyl-CoA converted from citrate feeds FA synthesis
  and acetylates histones to regulate TAM gene expression. Etomoxir, an inhibitor
  of CPT1, inhibits FAO and inhibits complex I of the electron transport chain and
  depletes CoA, eventually impairing M2 activation and the protumor growth activity
  of TAMs. 2-DG: 2-deoxyglucose; αKG: α-ketoglutarate; CoA: coenzyme A; CPT: carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase; FA: fatty acid; LD: lipid droplet; MCAD: medium-chain acyl-CoA
