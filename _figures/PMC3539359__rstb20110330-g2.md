caption: Pathways for removal of DNA methylation. Cytosine (C) is methylated at the
  5′ carbon position by DNMT enzymes to generate 5-methylcytosine (5mC). This can
  be lost passively owing to a lack of maintenance at DNA replication (dashed line),
  or actively processed by enzymatic activity. 5mC can be deaminated to thymine (T)
  by the AID/APOBEC deaminases (blue), or oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)
  by the TET enzyme family (brown). 5hmC itself may be deaminated to 5-hydroxymethyluracil
  (5hmC), or further oxidized by TET activity to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine
  (5caC). The T, 5hmU, 5fC and 5caC derivatives can be excised by glycosylases (beige)
  such as TDG, single strand-selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1)
  and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 4 (MBD4) to initiate the BER pathway resulting
  in their replacement with unmodified C. Alternatively, 5fC and 5caC can be lost
  passively through lack of maintenance; 5caC may also be converted to C by a decarboxylation
  reaction. For clarity, demethylation catalysed by the elongator complex is not shown.
