caption: Illustration of the AR signalling pathway. When A enters into the cell, it
  is converted into the more potent DHT by 5α-reductase and binds to the ligand-binding
  pocket of AR forming AR-A and AR-DHT complexes, respectively. Consequently, the
  AR-A or AR-DHT is translocated into the nucleus with help of other proteins to form
  the AR-dimer (or AR-DHT dimer, not shown) that is able to bind the ARE region in
  DNA to regulate the expression of downstream genes thus initiating the transcription
  of specific protein that exert the androgen effect.
