caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the specific cascade and signaling pathway
  in LPS-primed macrophages stimulated with MSU, silica or Alum salt crystals. LPS
  priming induces transcription of pro-IL-1β gene and other genes in the nucleus upon
  activation of the transcription factor NFκB and subsequent production of pro-IL-1β
  protein in the cytosol (1). Particle internalization (2), fusion to lysosome (3)
  and further phagolysosome destablization may lead to cathepsin leakage (4), which
  precedes pannexin/connexin (Panx/Conx) hemichannel and purinergic signaling dependent
  intracellular ATP release (5). Extracellular ATP may act through P2X7 receptor to
  amplify ATP release in a P2X7 receptor dependent way (6). ATP or its derived degradation
  products such as ADP, generated by ecto-endonucleases, act through an autocrine
  loop on other purinergic receptor P2X and/or P2Y receptors (7) leading to Nlrp3
  receptor activation (8). This allows inflammasome complex formation and maturation
  of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β production (9) and IL-1β secretion (10)
