caption: Proposed mechanism of the TKase-ACP systems involved in the tetrahydroisoquinoline
  biosynthesis by diverting a hydroxyacyl unit from ketosugars into a nonribosomal
  peptide assembly line. (A) Comparison between the TKase-ACP systems in NDM and QNC
  biosynthesis. aa, amino acid; I/S, identity/similarity. (B) The proposed biosynthetic
  pathway and catalytic cycle by TKase-ACP system. (C) The ThDP-dependent reaction
  mechanism catalyzed by TKase.
