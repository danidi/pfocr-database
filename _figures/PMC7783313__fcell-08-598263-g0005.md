caption: Macrophage and bone remodeling related diseases. Arrow represents “stimulatory
  modification;” the gray triangle means “enlarged display.” Osteoporosis is an age-related
  bone disease to some extent. The release and accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines
  can active osteoclasts and thus greatly accelerate the process of osteoporosis;
  The patients of osteoarthritis have a vital inducer that is tissue damage which
  can release various cytokines, leading to the imbalance between M1 and M2 macrophages.
  Usually, the quantity of M1 prevails, leading to the aggravation of OA; Caspase-8/RIPK3
  signaling pathway and HIF1-α have been found to play a role in regulating macrophages,
  through CD206 and glycolysis, respectively. Besides, macrophages can secret IL-26,
  an inducer of Th17 cells which can cause autoimmune tissue damage; Osteosarcoma
  always occurs in the metaphyseal region of the long bone and the growth and metastasis
  of tumor cells have a closely relationship with IL-34 and CCL18. Moreover, tumor
  cell-derived IL-34 stimulates the angiogenesis of TAM. Cancer-related thrombosis
  could be made by the interaction of clec-2-podoplanin and the ectopic expression
  of podoplanin in patient's macrophages is the inducer, leading to the severe complications.
