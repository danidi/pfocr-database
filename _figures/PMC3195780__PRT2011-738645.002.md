caption: 'A “tetrapartite” synapse in the CNS: A GABAergic synapse modulated by reciprocal
  signaling and homeostatic interactions with neighboring astrocytes and microglia
  []. GABAergic synapses employ ionotropic (GABA-A receptors) and metabotropic (GABA-B)
  receptors to evoke postsynaptic potentials []. The ionotropic GABA-A receptor is
  a ligand-gated chloride channel. The metabotropic GABA-B receptor activates a hyperpolarizing
  potassium conductance through a G-protein-mediated pathway []. As part of their
  neuroprotective response, activated microglia release brain-derived neurotropic
  factor (BDNF) in response to neuronal or vascular injury. BDNF triggers a transcriptional
  downregulation of KCC2 (potassium-chloride cotransporter 2), leading to reduced
  chloride extrusion from the cell []. Pathological accumulation of intracellular
  chloride can be reduced by blocking the inward sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter
  (NKCC1) with bumetanide []. Diminished functioning of the GABA-A receptor, because
  of a collapsed chloride gradient, could be compensated for applying baclofen, a
  GABA-B agonist []. As pain therapeutics, bumetanide and baclofen, offer different
  physiological approaches to deal with the chloride-opathy in the postsynaptic neuronal
  cell.'
