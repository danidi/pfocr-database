caption: Proposed relationship between the Lace and MAPK cascades in the imaginal
  disc cells. The black and gray arrows indicate metabolic conversions and enzymatic
  actions, respectively. The solid and broken arrows indicate direct and indirect
  conversions and/or actions, respectively. It is predicted that the Lace protein
  associates with an LCB1 subunit to form an apoenzyme of SPT, based on knowledge
  of the budding yeast and CHO cells (, , ). Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is thought
  to bind to Lace as a coenzyme. SPT catalyzes the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis,
  that is, condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to yield 3-ketosphinganine. 3-Ketosphinganine
  is metabolically converted to ceramide and various other sphingolipids. Ceramide
  is also produced through the sphingomyelin pathway, which is initiated by hydrolysis
  of sphingomyelin. In dipteran insects, ceramide phosphoethanolamine, instead of
  sphingomyelin, is presumed to be hydrolyzed. A decrease in the rate of de novo sphingolipid
  synthesis via SPT removes repression of the DJNK cascade and elicits apoptosis.
  The Rl cascade is antagonistic to the apoptotic DJNK pathway. Ksr (CAPK) is known
  to be activated by ceramide (). The mammalian homologs are indicated in parentheses.
