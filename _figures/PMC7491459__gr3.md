caption: Schematic diagram sketching three well-characterized pathways (3 vertical
  lanes) in which TGFβ plays a role via signaling and/or transactivation/crosstalk
  and which may act to promote or prevent hypertension. At the top of each lane, preparation
  steps needed for a master product that is essential for the pathway's activation
  are summarized. Asterisks and daggers indicate gene products for which common SNPs
  in the gene or its vicinity have been reported to be associated with blood pressure
  or hypertension in ref. [,] (∗; (∗) for pathway) or have been reviewed as being
  associated with BP or hypertension in ref. [] (†). Dashed horizontal arrows indicate
  experimentally observed or hypothesized crosstalk/transactivation between pathways
  (not just receptors). Not shown, for simplicity, is another potentially relevant
  system, descending alongside the classic RAS pathway at left, namely the ‘nonclassical’
  RAS, composed primarily of the AngII/Ang III-AT2R pathway and the ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-AT7R
  axis [], which generally counteracts the effects of a stimulated classic Ang II-AT1R
  axis as shown in the Figure, and which is currently of great interest for understanding
  and possibly treating the Covid-19 disease [].
