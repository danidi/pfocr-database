caption: Hierarchical QS network in P. aeruginosa and regulation of virulence factors.
  (A) So far, four pathways including Las, Rhl, Pqs, and IQS have been understood
  as mediating QS responses in P. aeruginosa while LasR resides at the top of the
  cascade. In response to specific stimuli/stress, each pathway synthesizes cognate
  autoinducers (AIs) [HSL(3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactone)], BHL (N-butyrylhomoserine
  lactone or C4-HSL), PQS (2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone) and IQS [2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-thiazole-4-carbaldehyde
  (aeruginaldehyde)]. Export and import of HSL, BHL, and PQS is mediated by the efflux
  pumps MexAB-OprM/MexEF-OprN, free diffusion and membrane vesicles, respectively.
  Question mark indicates unknown pathway of IQS transportation. As fine-tuned individual
  circuits, but interconnected (dashed lines), transcriptional factors (i.e., LasR,
  RhlR, and PqsR) are activated by AIs for upregulating expression of cognate AI synthases
  (respectively, LasI, RhlI, PqsABCDH) as well as others such as virulence factor
  genes. The IQS pathway remains unraveled and the IQS receptor is still unknown.
  Various secretion systems mainly type 1 and 2 secretion systems (T1SS/T2SS) and
  also PvdRT-OpmQ efflux pump mediate the secretion of virulence factors. (B) QS initiates
  upon cumulative production of AIs (small colorful circles) by increasing cell density
  and results in collective responses. AprA, alkaline protease; Pyd, pyoverdine; PLC,
  phospholipase C; Tox, toxin A; LasA, LasA elastase; LasB, LasB elastase; HCN, hydrogen
  cyanide; Pyo, pyocyanin; Rhld, rhamnolipids; Lec A, lectin A; CM, cytoplasmic membrane;
  OM, outer membrane.
