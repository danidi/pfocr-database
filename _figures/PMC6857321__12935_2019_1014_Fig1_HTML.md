caption: Biosynthesis of S1P. S1P is generated from sphingosine (SPH) by two sphingosine
  kinases (SphK1 and SphK2) in the catabolic pathway. SphK1 mainly exists in the cytosol,
  but SphK2 exists in the nuclei and mitochondria. S1P produced by SphK1 is exported
  to the extracellular space, where it exerts various functions associated with cancer
  via S1P receptor (S1PR). S1P produced by SphK2 is thought to play important roles
  in intracellular functions
