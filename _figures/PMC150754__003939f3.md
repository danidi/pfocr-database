caption: The Sterol Biosynthetic Pathway.A simplified version of the sterol biosynthetic
  pathway is shown. Sterol intermediates are labeled. Genes that are enzymes and that
  have been identified by mutation, with the exception of SMT3, are shown in uppercase
  letters (; , , ; ; ; ). The site of SMT methyl addition, C-24, is indicated. SMT2
  is shown in boldface and underlined. Brz is a BR biosynthetic inhibitor (). Dashed
  arrows indicate multiple biosynthetic steps.
