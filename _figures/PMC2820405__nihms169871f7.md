caption: Under physiological levels of stress, FoxO1 shuttles between the nucleus
  and the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, FoxO1 interacts with ATF4. This interaction promotes
  the transcriptional activity of FoxO1 and is required for amino acid import and
  protein synthesis. Normal protein synthesis allows FoxO1 to orchestrate an anti-oxidant
  defense mechanism that maintains redox balance by suppressing expression of p19ARF
  and p16 and downstream activation of their target protein p53. Transcriptional repression
  of the p19ARF/p16/p53 pathway prevents cell cycle arrest in osteoblasts and maintains
  their normal proliferation and bone homeostasis
