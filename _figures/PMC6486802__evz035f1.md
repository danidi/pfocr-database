caption: —Nomenclature and homology/analogy relationships among the proteins involved
  in the last two steps of the purine biosynthetic pathway. PurH is composed of two
  domains, IMPCH and AICARFT. The relationships of homology and analogy among the
  domains of PurH and other proteins are shown. PurH is shown in an inverted position
  to match the steps of the purine biosynthetic pathway.
