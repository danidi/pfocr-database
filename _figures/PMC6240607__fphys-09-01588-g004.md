caption: Schematic depiction of GDNF/RET/GFRα1 signaling in the ureteric bud (UB)
  tip during kidney development. Gdnf is first expressed in the CM (dark blue) and
  later also in the surrounding stroma (S, brown). GDNF binds to RET/GRFα1 complex
  in the UB tip (T, olive green), initiating downstream cascades such as the MAPK
  and PI3K pathways. Several factors are transcriptionally activated downstream of
  RET signaling and include Ret itself; Wnt11, which upregulates GDNF; Crlf1, which
  induces nephrogenesis; and Dusp6 and Spry1, which inhibit RET/GFRα1. ETV4 and -5
  are transcription factors mediating the GDNF/RET response to UB epithelium and their
  expression depends on PI3K signaling. Signaling via the MAPK pathway is important
  for proliferation, growth, and adhesion, and plays a major role in branching morphogenesis
  ().
