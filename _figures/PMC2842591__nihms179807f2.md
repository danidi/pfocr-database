caption: Plants possess plasma-membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
  that consist of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a cytoplasmic
  serine/threonine kinase domain. In Arabidopsis, FLS2 and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu)
  receptor (EFR) are PRRs that recognize the flg22 peptide of flagellin or the elf18
  peptide of EF-Tu, respectively ,,,,. Other bacterial elicitors such as lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), harpins, and cold-shock protein have been identified,,,. PRR activation triggers
  signalling events that lead to the upregulation of over 300 plant genes,,,. A complete
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and several WRKY transcription factors
  that function downstream of FLS2 and induce the expression of genes such as FRK1
  and NHO1 have been identified. Phenotypes that are associated with activated basal
  defences include cell wall fortifications and the production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and nitrogen species (NO). Delivery of effector proteins through the
  type III secretion system (T3SS) into plant cells is one strategy that is used by
  bacteria to suppress PRR-mediated defences. As many as 16 effectors have been identified
  that suppress basal defences,–,. The model highlights the effector AvrPto that is
  required for suppressing the recognition of flg22 and other pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs),. In Arabidopsis, AvrPto functions upstream of MAPK kinase
  kinase (MAPKKK), indicating that it targets components that function early on in
  the PRR pathway. The residue I96, which resides within an extended Ω-loop, is required
  for the basal defence suppression of AvrPto in Arabidopsis. See text for more details.
