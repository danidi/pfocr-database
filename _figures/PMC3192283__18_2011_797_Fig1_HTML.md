caption: Coupling of the IL-15R and NKG2D signaling components in NK cells. The figure
  roughly summarizes interactions between signaling components of the IL-15R and NKG2D,
  which was proposed by Horng et al. []. Jak3, as a part of canonical IL-15R signaling
  pathway, is essential for the phosphorylation of DAP10. Activated DAP10 recruits
  PI3K and Grb2, which control proliferation, survival, and cytotoxicity of NK cells.
  DAP10 also associates with IL-15Rβ and -γ chains
