caption: Working model of innate immune sensing of tumors that leads to spontaneous
  T cell responses in vivo. The STING pathway is activated within intra-tumoral dendritic
  cells (DCs) by tumor-derived DNA. Recognition of cytosolic DNA by cyclic GMP-AMP
  (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) leads to the generation of cGAMP, the endogenous ligand
  of STING (stimulator of interferon genes). Therapeutically, the STING pathway can
  be stimulated by direct STING agonists, when the compounds are injected into the
  tumor site. This results in the phosphorylation of tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)
  and the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which induces
  expression of the type I IFN genes. Type I IFN signaling in the BATF3 (basic leucine
  zipper transcription factor ATF-like 3)-lineage of DCs leads to antigen-specific
  T cell priming, generating spontaneous anti-tumor T cell responses in vivo. Recruitment
  of effector T cells into the tumor microenvironment is then facilitated by the release
  of CXCL9/10 chemokines from DCs and other cells at the tumor site. Successfully
  recruited activated T cells induce direct tumor cell killing, leading to measurable
  tumor shrinkage.
