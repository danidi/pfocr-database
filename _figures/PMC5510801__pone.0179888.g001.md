caption: (A) The central part of the scheme shows the regulation of the β-catenin
  level in the cell. This process is described by the following cascade of reactions.
  The Wnt ligand binds to the Frizzled receptor (reaction labeled k±2). The resulting
  receptor–ligand complex may recruit an unoccupied LRP receptor and create a ternary
  complex consisting of Wnt, Frizzled and LRP (k±3). The latter complex transduces
  the signal inside the cell and interferes with the destruction cycle of β-catenin,
  by binding a specific destruction complex comprising Axin, APC and GSK3β (k±5).
  This complex regulates the intracellular level of β-catenin; when unbound to the
  Wnt/Frizzled/LRP ternary complex, the destruction complex binds β-catenin and causes
  its phosphorylation (k±6). Phosphorylated β-catenin dissociates from the destruction
  complex and is rapidly degraded. The reverse rate constants of these reactions are
  denoted by a minus in the subscript. Production and degradation of β-catenin, independent
  of the destruction complex, are also modelled and their rates are labelled k7 and
  k8, respectively, and the circled part shows β-catenin function inside the nucleus
  as TCF activator. The greyed part describes the formation of the destruction complex
  (GSK/Axin/APC); KD1 and KD2 are dissociation constants of APC from the Axin/APC
  dimer, and of the dimer from the destruction complex, respectively. The boxes show
  reactions between SFRP and Wnt and Dkk1 and LRP receptor, with the rates k±1 and
  k±4, respectively. The circled part shows β-catenin function inside the nucleus
  as TCF activator. (B) A schematic illustration of the APC gene, showing the location
  of the 1572T mutation, truncated close to the MCR, and of the min mutation. These
  mutations form a truncated APC protein, lacking more functional binding sites as
  the gene is truncated closer to the translation starting site. Note that all other
  mutations referred to in this work are not known to form a truncated APC protein,
  but rather attenuate the expression of the full length APC protein.
