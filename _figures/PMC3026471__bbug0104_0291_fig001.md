caption: 'Carbon and electron flow in E. coli K24KP. Main metabolic pathways involved
  in glucose and glycerol catabolism for recombinant strain K24KP, carrying phaBAC
  and phaP from Azotobacter sp. strain FA8. Relevant native biochemical pathways and
  enzymes are shown by blue arrows and boxes, respectively. The heterologous pathway
  for PHB synthesis and enzymes involved are depicted in green. Dashed lines represent
  more than one biochemical step. Pathways that generate ATP are indicated by yellow
  arrows, while reduction/oxidation of adenine dinucleotides are represented by green
  and red arrows, respectively. Abbreviations used are as follows: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  CoA, coenzyme A; LdhA, D-lactate dehydrogenase; Pfl, pyruvate-formate lyase; Pdh,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; Pta/AckA, phosphotransacetylase/acetate kinase; AdhE, acetaldehyde/alcohol
  dehydrogenase; PhaB, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; PhaA, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; PhaC,
  poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) synthase.'
