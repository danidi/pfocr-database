caption: A putative scheme for ATF3-mediated regulation of ER stress-induced cancer
  chemokine expression. Actively proliferating cancer cells undergo detrimental conditions
  such as hypoxia and misfolded protein stress, leading to ER stress responses. As
  a central proinflammatory transcription factor, EGR-1 mediates ER stress-induced
  expression of cancer chemokines CXCL-1 and MCP-1. Preventive exposure to the dietary
  apigenin epigenetically suppresses EGR-1 induction via ATF3, which leads to reduced
  production of cancer chemokines, independently of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Mechanistically,
  apigenin potentiates ATF superinduction by promoting cytosolic translocation of
  HuR protein and subsequent stabilization of ATF3 transcript.
