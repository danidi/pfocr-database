caption: SHH pathway activity leading to phenotypical changes in esophageal epithelial
  cells. 1. In the esophageal epithelium, SHH is expressed in response to damage caused
  by acid reflux. 2. SHH is modified and exported out of the epithelium. 3. SHH binds
  to and inhibits PTCH1 4. Due to inhibition by SHH, PTCH1 inhibition of SMO is released
  and SMO is activated. 5. Activated SMO initiates a signaling cascade that leads
  to the activation of GLI2. 6. GLI2 translocate to the nucleus. 7. GLI2 activity
  in the nucleus ultimately leads to the transcription of SHH pathway targets, as
  well as intestinal phenotypes such as CDX1 and CDX2. 8. SHH begin the previously
  mentioned steps (3–7) in a neighboring fibroblast where SHH induces BMP4 translation.
  9. BMP4 is exported out of the fibroblast and feeds back to the esophageal epithelial
  cell. 10. In response to fibroblast-created BMP4, SOX9 is expressed in the esophageal
  epithelial cell where it is sufficient to drive columnar differentiation of squamous
  epithelium and expression of intestinal markers.
