caption: Afferent vagus nerve fibres transmit danger signals from peripheral organs
  to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). This signalling leads to activation of
  the efferent vagus nerve arising in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV),
  and of the splenic nerve, leading to noradrenaline release in the spleen. This noradrenaline
  release activates choline acetyltransferase positive (ChAT+) T cells, which express
  β2-Activated ChAT + T cells release acetylcholine, which binds to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptors (α7nAChRs) on macrophages, leading to suppression of the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and reduced inflammation and/or tissue injury. In addition to activation
  of this cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) by this vagal preganglionic
  efferent pathway, direct stimulation of brainstem C1 neurons (or indirect stimulation
  by a variety of physiological stressors) elicits activation of the CAP via a sympathetic
  efferent pathway that might involve C1 projections to sympathetic preganglionic
  neurons (which innervate sympathetic ganglia such as the coeliac and suprarenal
  ganglia) or other C1 projections in the brain that stimulate a sympathetic pathway.
  Dashed lines represent unconfirmed pathways, and solid lines represent confirmed
  pathways.
