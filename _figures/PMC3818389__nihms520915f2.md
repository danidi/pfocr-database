caption: '(a) Immune surveillance: astrocytes (AS, blue), microglia (MG, purple) and
  neurons (N, blue) are components of the innate immune system of the brain (blue,
  purple) that modulate acquired immune responses (red) by promoting death of activated
  T cells through Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interactions, death or conversion of T cells
  to TH2 cells through indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) biochemical reactions and
  co-inhibitory ligand (B7-H1) mediated actions, respectively, and/or conversion of
  naïve T cells to T regulatory cells (Tregs) through transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β) signaling. Bioenergetics: Within the complex cellular ecosystem of mitochondria
  (yellow), amino acids, glucose and lipids are metabolized directly and via metabolic
  intermediates through the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle and the fatty acid (FA) β-oxidation
  cascade. NAD+/NADH are involved in mediating a spectrum of interrelated processes
  including energy homeostasis and immunological functions. Reducing equivalents generated
  by the Krebs cycle and by the β-oxidation pathway are subsequently shuttled through
  the electron transport chain to generate energy through a tripartite series of energy-generating
  and - conserving reactions. Within this energy cascade, adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP) gives rise to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and this factor, in turn,
  phosphorylates and activates both peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor gamma
  co-activation-1-beta (PGC-1α) and cryptochrome (CRY), thereby linking components
  of mitochondrial biogenesis (mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA]) and function, through the
  mediation of specific co-factors (nuclear respiratory factor ½ [NRF1/2], estrogen-related
  receptor [ERR], retinoid X receptor [RXR], peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor
  gamma [PPARγ]), with the circadian pacemaker (brown), respectively. Gut microbiome:
  Within the gastrointestinal system (green), immunological (red), endocrine and neuronal
  afferent signals respond to commensal bacteria and infectious pathogens, nutrient
  signals and gut-associated stimuli and these cues are transmitted to the peripheral
  and central nervous systems (blue) and non-neural organ systems. Dendritic cells
  (DC) sample commensal bacteria and nutrient signals through luminal sensing and
  convey their signals to adjacent Peyer’s patches where associated dendritic cells
  (pDC), B cells and Tregs interact to generate appropriate degrees of tolerance and
  protective immunological reactions that are disseminated through humoral mechanisms.
  Specific forms of gut-associated signals are conveyed through spinal afferents and
  extrinsic vagus afferents to spinal cord and brainstem regions. Multimodal gastrointestinal
  cues can activate networks of enteric, myenteric, spinal and vagal afferent nervous
  system elements. A spectrum of diverse immune-associated molecules, feeding peptides,
  neuropeptides and additional hormonal cues are released by immune cells within Peyer’s
  patches and the gut epithelium to activate corresponding receptors on spinal and
  vagal afferents and related signals are also released from enteroendocrine cells
  (EE cells) in response to luminal antigens, toxins and nutrients through humoral/circumferential
  organ and receptor-mediated paracrine mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, enterochromaffin
  (EC cells) convey complementary gut-related signals to enteric nervous system circuits
  and via vagal efferents to the brainstem. (b) Representation of how the levels of
  key nervous system processes dynamically evolve over time and are mediated by the
  interplay of signals (color bars) derived not only from brain (blue) but also from
  immune surveillance (red), bioenergetic (yellow) and circadian (brown) processes
  and diverse gut-associated cues (green).'
