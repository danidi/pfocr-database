caption: Metabolic crosstalk between key signaling pathways in stem cells via ROS
  and other metabolic co-factors. Glycolysis (depicted by light-blue arrows) is a
  catabolic process, creating energy via the conversion of glucose to pyruvate. The
  glycolytic intermediate glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) can also be shunted into the pentose
  phosphate pathway (dark-blue arrows) to produce precursors for nucleotide biosynthesis
  and also to regenerate NADPH, a co-factor that replenishes the reduced glutathione
  pools. In turn, the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) mitigates oxidative stress. The
  pentose phosphate pathway is especially important for the anabolic (energy consuming)
  demands of stem cells and for the regeneration of glutathione. Pyruvate can be catalyzed
  to lactate to regenerate NAD+, a required co-factor for continued flux through glycolysis
  and is the preferred path for stem cells. Pyruvate can also be further metabolized
  inside the mitochondria, beginning with the conversion to acetyl CoA, which feeds
  into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle generates reducing
  co-factors that power the electron transport chain (ETC) and subsequent production
  of ATP, a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. Some key metabolic enzymes
  that are described in the text are outlined in black. The metabolic processes described
  can affect concentrations of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), metabolic intermediates
  (acetyl CoA, α-ketoglutarate), co-factors (NADPH, NAD+, AMP/ADP) and ROS, which
  in turn affect the function of nutrient-sensing (depicted by green arrows) and redox-sensitive
  proteins (depicted by gold stars). Many of these proteins can then alter cellular
  processes and ultimately regulate stem cell fate. Additionally, some proteins, such
  as the transcription factors FOXO3 and HIF1α, can modulate the expression of metabolic
  genes to fit the needs of stem cells (pink background depicts the metabolic reactions
