caption: Model for SHP-2 regulation of myogenesis. SHP-2 associates with p190-B RhoGAP
  and stimulation of SHP-2's phosphatase activity leads to tyrosyl dephosphorylation
  of p190-B RhoGAP. Tyrosyl dephosphorylation of p190-B RhoGAP by SHP-2 facilitates
  the activation of RhoA which promotes muscle-specific gene activation and myogenesis.
