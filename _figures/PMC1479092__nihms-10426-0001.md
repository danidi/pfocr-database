caption: The mitochondrial generated ROS-mediated activation of the p38 MAPK stress
  response pathway. The pathway depicts (a) the effect of mitochondrial ROS production
  on levels of oxidized thioredoxin [Trx (S)2] and reduced thioredoxin [Trx (SH)2];
  (b) the effects of (a) on the ASK1/Trx (SH)2-ASK1 ratio; the oxidation of Trx-ASK1
  causes release of the ASK1 and makes it available to activate downstream p38 MAPK
  pathway targets; (c) Phospho-ASK1 activates MKK3 by phosphorylation of its catalytic
  site; (d) P-MKK3-P activates p38α by phosphorylation of its catalytic site; (e)
  P-p38α-P translocates to the nucleus where it complexes with and activates MAPK
  activating protein kinase 2 (MK2); (g) the P-p38α-P [unk] MK2 complex activates
  a transcription factor (TF) and complexes with (h) MAPK phosphatase (MKP). The complex
  translocates to the cytoplasm (i) where it dissociates (j) into p38α, MK2, and MKP,
  and the stress response cycle starts again; (k) under normal unstressed conditions
  MK2 translocates to the nucleus where it is activated by P-p38α-P in response to
  a stress stimulus. (l) it is not established that MK2 complexes with P-p38α-P in
  the cytoplasm and that the complex translocates to the nucleus in response to a
  stress signal.
