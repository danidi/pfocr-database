caption: Schematic depiction of main conclusions. Thapsigargin (Tg) binds to and blocks
  SERCA (the ER Ca2+ pump), thus causing ER Ca2+ depletion and ER stress. ER stress
  upregulates LC3B and DR5 protein levels in a manner that requires individual contributions
  from ATF4 and CHOP. Tg-induced activation of caspase-8 (casp8), caspase-3 (casp3),
  and apoptosis is strongly dependent on DR5, and partially dependent on LC3B. PERK
  is required for Tg-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, but not for upregulation
  of LC3B- and DR5 protein levels. Thus, PERK delivers an essential pro-death signal
  via a different pathway. The IRE1-XBP1 axis is partially required for Tg-induced
  upregulation of DR5, but not LC3B. Moreover, IRE1-XBP1 is required for the second-phase
  activation of JNK by Tg, which contributes to caspase activation and apoptosis in
  a cell type-dependent manner with JNK being required for Tg-induced cell death in
  LNCaP but not HCT116 cells
