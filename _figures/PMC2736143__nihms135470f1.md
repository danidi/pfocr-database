caption: A model of cell competition. (A) Neighboring epithelial cells recognize relative
  differences in ribosome function through a sensing mechanism that may involve the
  production of secreted factors by each cell (orange and green dots). (B) Once a
  difference is sensed, cells acquire “winner” or “loser” status, determined by their
  relative ribosome function. Loser cells sense stress and activate the JNK signaling
  pathway and expression of the proapoptotic factor, Hid. Hid induces apoptosis and
  leads to loser-cell death. Winner cells, with optimal ribosome function, are stimulated
  to proliferate faster. They also can activate genes required for cell engulfment,
  leading them to engulf dying loser cells (asterisk). Arrows depict genetic relationships
  rather than direct biochemical interactions.
