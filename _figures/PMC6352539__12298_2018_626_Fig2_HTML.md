caption: Network diagram of differently expressed probe profiling. The position of
  the IAA metabolic sub-network was displayed with black arrow. a Network diagram
  based on 1331 up-regulated probes over three fold-change between fertile monocyte
  anthers (Fer-anther) and F1 tetrad panicles (F1-rachis), which showed the complex
  metabolic network. b Network diagram based on 875 up-regulated probes over three fold-change
  between anthers at tetrad stage of sterile plant (Ste-anther) and anthers at F1
  tetrad stage (Ste-rachis), which showed inddoxal compound was the connection node
  from the sub-network to the amino acid metabolism main network. c The main network
  diagram of 347 up-regulated probes over five fold-change between anthers at tetrad
  stage of sterile plant (Ste-anther) and anthers at F1 tetrad stage (Ste-rachis),
  which showed IAA sub-network and regulation route. d The structure of IAA metabolic
  sub-network. It contained 4 nodes of inddoxal biosynthesis, inddoxal metabolism,
  alkaloid biosynthesis and alkaloid metabolism
