caption: In response to oxidative stress, electrophiles challenge, or protein kinase-mediated
  phosphorylation (e.g., via the PI3K-Akt pathway), the NRF2 protein is released from
  KEAP1 and then translocated into the nuclei. The SNP–617C>A in the ARE-like motif
  is considered to play a role in the positive feedback loop of transcriptional activation
  of the NRF2 gene. The SNP homozygote (–617 A/A) significantly attenuates the positive
  feedback loop and also expression of NRF2-target genes, such as MDM2 and ABCG2.
  In the case of MDM2 gene expression, the SNP (c.309 T>G) in the first intron of
  the MDM2 gene increases the binding affinity toward Sp1 and results in higher expression
  levels of MDM2 protein. MDM2 protein, thus highly expressed, binds to p53 (wild
  type; Wt) protein and leads to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p53
  (Wt) protein. Combination of the 309G (SNP) allele of the MDM2 gene and the –617C
  (Wt) allele of the NRF2 gene may have negative impacts on p53 (Wt)-mediated tumor
  suppression. On the other hand, lung cancer patients harboring both the 309T (Wt)
  allele of the MDM2 gene and the –617A (SNP) allele of the NRF2 gene may have better
  prognosis due to the tumor suppressor function of p53 (Wt), such as apoptosis and
  p21WAF1/cip1-mediated cell cycle arrest. Expression of the ABCG2 gene is known to
  be up-regulated by NRF2. Gefitinib, an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, is extruded
  by ABCG2 out of cancer cells. Thus, NRF2-mediated induction of ABCG2 expression
  can confer cancer cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib and other anticancer
  drugs.
