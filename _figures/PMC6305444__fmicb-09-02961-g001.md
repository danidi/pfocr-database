caption: SOS pathway activation and inhibition. At left, under non-stressed conditions
  the intact LexA dimer binds to the SOS promoter region and tightly represses SOS
  protein production. Upon DNA damage RecA binds to DNA fragments to form RecA∗ filaments
  that stimulate free LexA to undergo auto-proteolysis. Auto-proteolysis of LexA renders
  it unable to bind to the SOS promoters leading to expression of the effectors of
  the SOS pathway. These effectors promote DNA repair, accelerate gene transfer and
  mutagenesis, and contribute to virulence. At right, genetic inhibition of the SOS
  response has been shown to antagonize these antibiotic-evasion associated phenotypes
  and small molecule inhibition of the pathway is therefore a viable pathway for improving
  the efficacy of antibiotics or targeting virulence.
