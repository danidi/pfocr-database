caption: Schematic diagram showing the cross talk between HCV and miR-373 inhibiting
  IFN signaling. HCV infection upregulates miR-373 in hepatocytes, which in turn inhibits
  JAK1 and IRF9 expression. Inhibition of JAK1 and IRF9 restricts STAT1 phosphorylation
  and blocks ISGF3 complex formation, respectively. This results in the inhibition
  of ISRE promoter activity. Arrows denote upregulation, and blunt arrows denote inhibition.
