caption: Glycero-3-phosphate (G3P) is acylated to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and
  then to phosphatidic acid (PA). PA formation occurs on the outer face of the outer
  mitochondrial membrane (OM) and in the endoplasmic reticulum. PA is transferred
  from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IM) via the intermembrane space
  (IMS) and is converted to CL on the matrix face of the IM via the intermedates CDPdiacylglycerol
  (CDP-DG), phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The
  final step of the pathway is the remodeling of nascent cardiolipin (CLn) to mature
  cardiolipin (CLm). Remodeling occurs in the outer leaflet of the inner membrane
  and requires disturbance of the bilayer packing order. Mammalian genes are shown
  for the enzymes of PA synthesis and yeast genes are shown for all other enzymes.
