caption: Expanding High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) chromatin functions. HMGA1 participates
  in the chromatin opening process by displacing histone H1 from chromatin via a competitive
  mechanism. Once bound to nucleosomes and/or DNA, HMGA1 is involved in the recruitment
  of transcription factors (TFs) and in the formation of protein platforms for the
  landing of other chromatin proteins [,]. In this work, we provided evidence that
  in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells HMGA1 could be an essential co-factor
  for conveying onto chromatin ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-3 (RSK2) and CREB-binding
  protein (CBP) activities.
