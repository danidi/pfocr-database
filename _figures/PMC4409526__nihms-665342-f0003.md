caption: Diagram depicting altered mRNA expression of molecules involved in the regulation
  of the actin cytoskeleton by NMDA signaling pathways in schizophrenia. Green represents
  increased mRNA expression, red represents decreased expression and no color represents
  no significant expression change. The diagram was generated using Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis using data from the qRT-PCR study (double circles, McLean 75 cohort) and
  microarray data obtained from the DLPFC of schizophrenia subjects in the McLean
  66 cohort. Both PARD3 (par-3 family cell polarity regulator) and ARHGEF6 (Rac/Cdc42
  guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 6) regulate dendritic spine formation (;
  ).
