caption: Schematic diagram of NPY(1–36) expression and secretion in activated LX-2
  cells and the signalling pathway involved. Activated human immortalized hepatic
  stellate cells synthesize and release NPY(1–36). Both autocrine and exogenous NPY(1–36)
  induce fibrogenic responses via NPY1R and activate the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 signalling
  pathway, further phosphorylating 4EBP1 and releasing eIF4E to initiate mRNA translation.
  The fibrogenic response can be blocked by either the selective NPY1R antagonist
  BIBP3226 or Lenti-sh-NPY1R. The speculated mechanism is circled with the grey dotted
  line.
