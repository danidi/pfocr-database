caption: The myelin-associated inhibitors, such as Nogo, and scar-rich CSPGs activate
  intracellular RhoA to collapse axon growth cones. Cyclic AMP surmounts the suppression
  of these inhibitory signals and promotes axon growth. Intracellular PTEN phosphatase
  blocks axon growth by inactivation of mTOR pathway. Cytokine signaling, such as
  STAT3, may promote neuronal growth by alternating the expression of some regeneration-associated
  genes. RhoA might also modulate PTEN activity and suppress neuronal growth via inactivation
  of mTOR signaling. (Adaptation from a book chapter by Toby Ferguson, Michael Selzer
  and Zhigang He).
