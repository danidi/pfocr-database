caption: PRR activated signaling and antiviral responses during virus infection. An
  overview of signaling pathways triggering IFN and cytokine production and mediates
  an endogenous antiviral states after sensing of invading virus. TLR2, TLR4, TLR7/8,
  and TLR9 all signals via the adaptor molecule Myd88 and via TRAF6 and/or TRAF3 and
  IRAKs. TLR2 primarily mediates activation of NF-κB, whereas TLR3 and TLR4 also mediate
  activation of IRF3 via the adaptor molecule TRIF. TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation induce
  IFNβ production. TLR7/8 and TLR9 primarily activate IRF7 leading to immediate IFN-α
  expression, but also NF-κB activation leading to stimulation of proinflammatory
  cytokines. RNA sensors and DNA sensors lead to activation if both IRF3 and NF-κB
  thus regulating both IFN and cytokine production. DNA sensors IFI16, DAI, and DDX41
  signals via STING located at the ER whereas the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 signal
  via MAVS. Finally, the DNA sensors AIM2 and IIF16 and the RNA sensor NLRP3 participate
  in inflammasome formation and cleavage of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β. Secreted IFN binds
  to its receptor and activates JAK/STAT signaling pathways leading to enhanced IFN
  expression and induction of antiviral mediators, including OASs, PKR, IFIT1, APOBEC3,
  and viperin, as well as production of IRF7 inducing IFN-α responses and thus increase
  overall IFN secretion. The MAPK signaling pathway activated by several PRRs, including
  TLRs and RLRs, has been omitted in the figure. ER = endoplasmic reticulum.
