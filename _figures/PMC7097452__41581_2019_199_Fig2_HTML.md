caption: 'The community approach to mortality risk prediction in a sepsis study identified
  65 risk-predicting genes based on publicly available gene expression data from adults,
  children and neonate with sepsis. Similarly, during the initial discovery phase
  of the PERSEVERE biomarkers used for prognostic enrichment, 80 genes associated
  with poor outcome were selected based on transcriptomic data from a cohort of paediatric
  patients with septic shock. An analysis of the genes identified in these two studies
  revealed 11 genes in common: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E3 (ADGRE3), CD24
  molecule (CD24), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 8 (CEACAM8),
  CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 2 (CKS2), C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor
  1 (CX3CR1), DNA damage inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), G0/G1 switch 2 (G0S2), C-X-C
  motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8, also known as IL-8), MAF bZIP transcription factor
  F (MAFF), regulator of G protein signalling 1 (RGS1) and transforming growth factor
  beta induced (TGFBI). The network was generated by uploading these 11 genes to the
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis platform. Solid lines represent direct interactions and
  dashed lines represent indirect interactions; solid arrowheads can represent activation,
  modification and phosphorylation among others (for more details see Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis legend), open arrowhead represents translocation and bar-headed arrow indicates
  that the gene inhibits and acts on its target. The gene network contains three highly
  connected central nodes relevant to the pathobiology of sepsis and inflammation:
