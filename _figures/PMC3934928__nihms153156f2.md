caption: The Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptors have one of two roles.
  MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) and TRIF (TIR domain-containing
  adaptor protein inducing IFNβ) function as signalling adaptors that biochemically
  link Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are found in several organelles to the downstream
  kinases that define a given signalling pathway. The recruitment of MYD88 to plasma
  membrane TLRs and of TRIF to endosomal TLRs depends on the sorting adaptors TIRAP
  (TIR domain- containing adaptor protein) and TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule).
  Sorting adaptors do not directly engage downstream kinases but instead directly
  engage signalling adaptors, promoting their delivery to activated receptors. The
  recruitment of sorting adaptors to specific subcellular locations is controlled
  by their intrinsic phosphoinositide-binding activity, which restricts their localization
  to a subset of organelles that contain TLRs. As such, TIRAP and TRAM can recruit
  their signalling adaptor partners to a subset of organelles. Whether additional
  sorting adaptors exist to recruit signalling adaptors to the other subcompartments
  of the cell is currently unknown. IL-1R, interleukin-1 receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphospate; TRAF3, TNFR-associated factor
  3.
