caption: 'Glial cell modulation of T lymphocytes via the programmed death (PD)-1:
  PD-L1 pathway. (A) Engagement of the PD-1 receptor by its ligand PD-L1 results in
  functional suppression of brain-infiltrating T-cells. This results in controlled
  neuroinflammation, suppression of disease severity, and limited bystander tissue
  damage, but may also support persistent viral infection. (B) Blocking the PD-1:
  PD-L1 negative checkpoint results in the attack of infected glia by effector T-cells
  resulting in rapid viral clearance, but it may also promote reactive gliosis, exacerbated
  neuroinflammation, and disease severity.  represents blocking either PD-1 or PD-L1
  using inhibitors;  indicates blocking the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway;  engagement of PD-1
  to PD-L1;  binding of major histocompatibility complex-antigen (MHC-Ag) to T-cell
  receptor (TCR).'
