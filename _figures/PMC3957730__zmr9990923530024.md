caption: Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the aerobic thermoacidophile Sulfolobus
  solfataricus. Sul. solfataricus utilizes the branched ED pathway for d-glucose and
  d-galactose degradation. Gluconeogenesis proceeds via the EMP pathway; for functional
  glycolysis, only PFK is missing. The ED pathway is characterized by promiscuous
  enzymes for glucose and galactose degradation up to the level of aldol cleavage.
  The spED branch is characterized by KDGK, glycolytic, allosterically regulated GAPN,
  and glycolytic PK, and the npED branch is characterized by GK, which shows substrate
  inhibition. For gluconeogenesis, the EMP pathway utilizes PEPS, the PGK/GAPDH enzyme
  couple, as well as FBPA/ase, with PGK and TIM being allosterically regulated. Enzyme
  reactions with catabolic function are indicated by red arrows, anabolic reactions
  are indicated by blue arrows, and reversible reactions are indicated by black arrows.
  Effectors are given in green and red boxes for activators and inhibitors, respectively.
  Enzymes identified as phosphoproteins under glycolytic (glucose) or gluconeogenic
  (tryptone) growth conditions are marked by black dots, with T for tryptone and G
  for glucose (). Enzymes that were upregulated (>1.5-fold) at the protein level in
  response to glucose or complex medium (tryptone and yeast extract) are marked with
  red and blue open arrows, respectively (). The net equation of glucose conversion
  to pyruvate via the branched ED pathway is depicted in the box (GLGA, glycogen synthase;
  GLPG, glycogen phosphorylase; AMYA, α-amylase; PGM, phosphoglucomutase). (Electron
