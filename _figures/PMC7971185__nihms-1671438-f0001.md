caption: The signaling pathway of MerTK-mediated inflammation resolution. MerTK activation
  by Gas6, protein S, or apoptotic cells activates ERK, which is followed by the induction
  of SERCA2 expression. The decrease in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+
  i) caused by the increased SERCA abundance suppresses CaMKII activity, which then
  reduces the activities of the kinases p38 and MK2. The decrease in MK2 activity
  promotes the cytoplasmic localization of 5-LOX, leading to SPM production and inflammation
  resolution.
