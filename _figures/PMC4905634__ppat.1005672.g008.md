caption: (1) P. aeruginosa (P.a.) resides in the airway mucus layer and produces OMVs.
  (2) OMVs traverse the mucus layer and reach the airway epithelial cells. (3) Pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the outside of OMVs induce the host innate immune
  response by activating the Toll-like receptor and MAP-kinase (TLR/MAPK) signaling
  pathway. (4) Activation of transcription factors leads to up-regulation of IL-8
  mRNA and IL-8 protein secretion. (5) IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils,
  which infiltrate the lungs and phagocytose P. aeruginosa. (6) OMVs also fuse with
  and deliver sRNA52320 into cells, which targets the mRNA of MAP-kinases upstream
  of IL-8, leading to reduced host IL-8 secretion and neutrophil recruitment. sRNA52320-mediated
  attenuation of the innate immune response to LPS is a novel mechanism of pathogen-host
  interaction that may facilitate chronic infection by P. aeruginosa.
