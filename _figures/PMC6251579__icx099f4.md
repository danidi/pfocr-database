caption: Summary of present findings. (A) Diagram of neural loci through which chemosensory
  information is processed. Unlike upstream chemosensory processing loci, the response
  of the POA to chemosensory information is modulated by photoperiod, represented
  by dark shading. Symbol ♀ represents chemosensory information, i.e., FHVS. (B) Diagram
  of the neuroendocrine reproductive axis. The RFRP neuronal system is sensitive to
  chemosensory information, and this response is modulated by photoperiod. The dotted
  line indicates that the pathway by which chemosensory information is transmitted
  to the RFRP neuronal system remains to be established.
