caption: a. The roles of EZH2 mediated transcriptional silencing are context specific.
  For cell types in which its hyperactivity drives oncogenesis, contributions from
  silencing of lineage specification genes, the tumor suppressor Rb and DNA repair
  genes have been identified. b. Cancers harboring SWI/SNF mutations and gain-of-function
  EZH2 mutations confer dependency on EZH2 inhibition. Early pre-clinical evidence
  suggests potential benefit of combination therapy with an EZH2 inhibitor. At least
  in the case of cancers driven by SWI/SNF mutation, Ras pathway mutations can confer
  resistance to EZH2 inhibition.
