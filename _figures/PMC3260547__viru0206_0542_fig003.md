caption: 'Model for the molecular bridge of the pro-apoptotic and anti-interferon
  functions of PB1-F2. MAVS is an important mediator of the type I IFN production
  pathway. It has also been shown that MAVS has a negative regulatory effect on VDAC1-mediated
  apoptosis. PB1-F2 affects MAVS-mediated IFN production by possibly binding to MAVS,
  which may have two effects: (1) the inhibition of the type I IFN response and (2)
  the lifting of the inhibitory effect of MAVS on VDAC1-mediated cell death. Please
  see text for further details and discussion. Please note: drawing is not to scale.'
