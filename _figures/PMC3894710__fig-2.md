caption: Molecular regulation of autophagy. Autophagy responds to negative regulation
  by growth factor stimuli (e.g., insulin) that regulate the class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K/AKT) pathway, which upregulates the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway. mTOR resides in a macromolecular complex (mTOR complex 1 [mTORC1]) This
  multiprotein complex is activated by nutrient-associated signals including amino
  acids and growth factors, and it negatively regulates autophagy by interacting with
  the ULK1 complex. Autophagy also responds to regulation by depletion of cellular
  energy charge through the increased activity of the 5’ adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK). In response to elevated AMP levels, AMPK inactivates mTORC1.
  The macrolide antibiotic rapamycin also stimulates autophagy by inactivating mTORC1.
  The initiation of autophagosome formation is also regulated by the autophagy protein
  Beclin 1 (Atg6). Beclin 1 associates with a macromolecular complex that includes
  hVps34, a class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3KC3), p150, and ATG14L. The
  basic sequence of steps of autophagy include (i) initiation and autophagosomal nucleation
  (formation of the phagophore), (ii) elongation of the nascent autophagosomal membrane,
  (iii) maturation of the double-membraned autophagosomal structure with cargo assimilation,
  and (iv) autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Autophagosome elongation requires two ubiquitin
  (Ub)-like conjugation systems, the ATG5-12 conjugation system and the ATG8 (LC3)
  conjugation system. Autophagy protein LC3-II remains associated with the maturing
  autophagosome. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the
