caption: 'The vaccine enters into cell, attached to dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages
  (MP) via toll like receptors (TLRs), and thus in turn trigger innate immune response.
  Then, antigen-presenting cells (APC) processed the vaccine’s epitopes and presented
  it to the T-cell which in turn trigger adaptive immune response. The T-cell prompt
  other immune cells or directly kills the infected cells (cellular immune response),
  whereas plasma B-cells (PLBC) produced antibodies to neutralize the viruses and
  memory B-cells (MBC) store all the information to trigger robust immune response
  in the case of re-infection (humoral immune response). (CD: cluster of differentiation;
  MHC: major histocompatibility complex; TCR: T-cell receptors; CTL: cytotoxic T lymphocytes;
  IFNs: Interferons; NK: natural killer cells). Figure was created using BioRender
