caption: 'Diagrammatic representations of putative mechanisms of microRNA 375 in regulating
  metadherin-induced cell proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis in human
  colorectal cancer. Decreased microRNA 375 (MIR375) expression in colorectal cancer
  (CRC) cells leads to upregulation of cellular metadherin (MTDH) levels. Subsequently,
  upregulated expression of MTDH promotes inhibition of NFKBIA and thus, NFKB1 and
  RELA expression is upregulated in CRC tissues and CRC cells. Upregulated MTDH expression
  level stimulates the BRAF-MAPK and PIK3CA-AKT signaling pathway. However, KRAS expression
  is unaltered by upregulation of MTDH. Consequently, downregulated MIR375 expression
  levels in CRC leads to upregulation of cell proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis.
  This simple hypothetical mechanism of MIR375-mediated upregulation of angiogenesis
  is based on the results of previous studies and our current study. MTDH: Metadherin;
  MIR375: MicroRNA 375; CRC: Colorectal cancer.'
