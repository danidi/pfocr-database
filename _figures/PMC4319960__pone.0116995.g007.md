caption: TGF-β1 activates the cell surface TGF-β receptor(s) complex that leads to
  rapid activation of the canonical SMAD pathway as well as the SMAD-independent p38
  MAPK pathway. Activation of the SMAD pathway is required for the induction of a
  cellular program of growth-arrest and myofibroblast differentiation. In contrast,
  activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, independently of SMAD2/3, is required the down-regulation
  of Cav-1 by TGF-β1. Down-regulation of Cav-1 by TGF-β1 “primes” differentiated myofibroblasts
  for enhanced proliferative responses to mitogens and resistance to apoptosis. These
  divergent TGF-β signaling pathways may explain, in part, the contextual effects
  of TGF-β1 as both a growth-inhibitor and –promoter on the same target (mesenchymal)
  cells.
