caption: Schematic diagram of proteins associated with LGMD and other muscle diseases
  such as DMD. When specific proteins are known to interact, they are portrayed as
  overlapping. The extracellular space occupies the upper portion of the diagram.
  The double line in the middle represents the sarcolemma. The bottom portion shows
  the intracellular compartments, including the sarcoplasm, sarcomere, nucleus, and
  mitochondria. The diverse cellular localizations of proteins associated with both
  recessive and dominant forms of LGMD highlight the need to organize the proteins
  into functional clusters that can identify common disease mechanisms and new therapeutic
  targets. The best known functional cluster to date is the glycosylation pathway
  that helps create and maintain the dystroglycan complex. The dystroglycanopathy
  genes include FKTN, FKRP, POMT1, POMT2, POMGnT1, POMGNT2, ISPD, and GMPPB. The postulated
  second functional cluster relates to mechanical signaling, which is critical for
  communications among the contractile apparatus, the surrounding sarcoplasm, the
  sarcolemma, and the extracellular matrix. The MAPK pathway has been found to be
  involved in numerous subtypes of LGMD. The sarcoglycan complex in particular is
  emerging as a key mechanosensor. Other LGMD proteins such as calpain 3 and dysferlin
  may be additional components of this cluster, or represent independent clusters.
  The postulated third functional cluster centers around mitochondrial dysfunction,
  which has been shown to be present in LGMD R1-R6 (LGMD2A-2F), with hints of involvement
  in newer LGMD genes such as PYROXD1
