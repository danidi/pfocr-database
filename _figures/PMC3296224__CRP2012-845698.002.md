caption: Possible mechanisms that make the diabetic heart more or less susceptible
  to infarction following ischemia reperfusion. (A) Diabetes can render the heart
  more susceptible to infarction. (A1) A diabetes-associated increase in the activity
  of p53, leading to the initiation of cell death pathway []. (A2) High-glucose causes
  a decrease in the activity of transcription factor HIF-1α, a subsequent downregulation
  of VEGF and less revascularization following ischemia []. This results in cell death
  and larger infarct volume. (B) Diabetes can protect the heart against infarction.
  (B1) Hyperglycaemia is cardioprotective due to the increased availability of glucose
  which is the hearts preferred substrate in times of stress. (B2/3) The Na+/Ca2+
  and Na+/H+ exchangers in the diabetic heart reportedly have decreased activity;
  therefore the diabetic heart accumulates less of these ions preventing overload
  and the associated detrimental effects []. (B4) Diabetes is associated with an increased
  release of reactive oxygen species (ROS); a possible subsequent release of free
  radical scavenging enzymes increase the level of antioxidants within the myocardium
  protecting the heart from the consequence of IRI []. (B5) An increased basal level
  of prosurvival kinases in diabetes []. (B6) PKC-ε increases in diabetes, activating
  the mitochondrial KATP channel causing subsequent reduction in calcium accumulation
  and increasing ATP synthesis. PKC-ε also persistently translocate during ischemia
  but only in diabetic hearts []. (B7) High glucose caused reduction in cell death
  proteins and increased anti apoptotic bcl-2 [].
