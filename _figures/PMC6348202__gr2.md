caption: Proteomic and Functional Analysis Reveals an Increased Chk1 Activity in Lung
  Cells that Contributes to Cisplatin Resistance(A) Identification of genes involved
  in differential cisplatin response. Breast and lung cells were treated with a cisplatin
  dose that caused an equal amount of DNA damage (20 μM and 30 μM, respectively).
  A protein array (366 unique UniProt IDs covered by both pan-specific and phospho-specific
  antibodies) was carried out to assess proteomic changes at 6, 12, and 24 h. Gene
  set enrichment was performed on differentially expressed proteins to identify differentially
  regulated pathways. After validation of the array results using both antibodies
  present on the array and antibodies from different manufacturers, inhibitors were
  used to screen for genes that modified the cisplatin response. For details see  and
  .(B) Overview of BioCarta pathways enriched for differentially expressed genes (DAVID
  pathway analysis). For details, see .(C) Overview of the most differentially activated
  pathways after cisplatin treatment. After array antibody validation (), activity
  of differentially regulated pathways was determined using quantitative western blot
  (). The colors indicate whether protein activity (e.g., highest phosphorylation
  levels) is the highest in lung (red) or breast (blue) cells.(D) Inhibition of Chk1
  activity differentially affects cisplatin sensitivity. Cells were treated for 1 h
  with the Chk1 inhibitor PF477736 (1 μM) or an equivalent amount of DMSO, after which
  cisplatin was added. Viability was determined after 48 h. Error bars represent the
  SD (n = 7). A two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test was carried out to test
  if differences were significant (**p < 0.01).
