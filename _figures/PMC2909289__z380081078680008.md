caption: Proposed mechanism of action for AICAR in human retinoblastoma cells. AICAR,
  on entering the cell, is converted by adenosine kinase to ZMP, which activates AMPK.
  On activation, AMPK inhibits mTOR pathway. In addition, induction of AMPK by AICAR
  decreases the levels of cyclins A and E, which control the progression through S
  phase, as well as the levels of p21, which was recently found to inhibit apoptosis
  and promote cell proliferation. Overall signaling leads to loss of viability due
  to apoptosis and proliferation block.
