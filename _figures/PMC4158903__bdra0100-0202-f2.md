caption: NFκB Dependent and Independent Actions of the IKKs. Both IKKα and -β phosphorylate
  IκB leading to NFκB mediated gene regulation. IKKβ can promote cell proliferation
  by inhibiting the anti-proliferative effects of FOXO3a, and activating the pro-proliferative
  MAP kinase pathway. IKKβ can also enhance gene transcription in an NFκB dependent
  manner by stabilizing mRNA transcripts containing AU-rich element (ARE) motifs.
  IKKα can either promote proliferation by increasing β-catenin-mediated transcription
  of cyclin D1, or inhibit proliferation by increasing cyclin D1 degradation. IKKα
  can also broadly affect gene transcription, independent of NFκB, by regulating chromatin
  remodeling.
