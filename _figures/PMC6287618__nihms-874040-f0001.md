caption: The EGFR signaling pathway is responsible for keratinocyte and mesenchymal
  cell proliferation and migration at the eyelid tip and meibomian gland epithelial
  cell proliferation. Ligands binding EGFR activates EGFR/ERK and EGFR/RhoA/ROCK/MAPK
  cascades and results in epithelial cell and eyelid stromal cell proliferation and
  migration at the tip of eyelid. The activation of EGFR upon ligand binding can activate
  a5b1 integrin and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors S1PR, which mediates epithelial
  cell binding to ECM and cell proliferation via ERK signaling cascades (black arrows).
  Perturbations of the signaling cascades due to genetic mutations manifest Eye Open
  at Birth (EOB) phenotype and malformation of meibomian glands. EGFR ligands are
  regulated by multiple molecules and signals from both epithelial and mesenchymal
  cells. Adam 17, the sheddase, releases the membrane-bound EGFR ligands such as TGFα
  and Hb-EGF that serve as paracrine and autocrine to epithelial cells. Growth factor
  FGF10 and extracellular matrix component biglycan secreted from stromal cells modulate
  the expression of ligands through mesenchyme/epithelium interaction which contributes
  to eyelid fusion and formation of meibomian glands (blue arrows). The activation
  of EGFR signaling finally leads to cell proliferation, actin cytoskeleton formation
  and nuclear transactivation of related genes such as c-Jun, MAP3K1 and HB-EGF to
  regulate eyelid morphogenesis.
