caption: Metabolic regulation by BAF60c in skeletal muscle. BAF60c drives glycolytic
  muscle metabolism through Deptor-mediated AKT activation. Mechanistically, BAF60c
  forms a transcriptional complex with Six4 and recruits the SWI/SNF complex to the
  proximal Deptor promoter to induce Deptor gene expression. This pathway is important
  for muscle glucose metabolism and whole body glucose homeostasis in both physiological
  and diabetic states. In severe diabetic condition, expression of BAF60c and Deptor
  is downregulated due to activation of ERK pathway by meta-inflammation. Rescue of
  this pathway by either treatment with an ERK inhibitor or transgenic expression
  of BAF60c in skeletal muscle ameliorates insulin resistance and improves whole body
  glucose homeostasis in HFD-induced or genetically obese mice. Under physiological
  condition, BAF60c acts as a glucose sensor in skeletal muscle. Glucose triggers
  KATP channel-dependent Ca2+response, which elicits the phosphorylation and nuclear
  exclusion of HDAC5 downstream of CaMKII activation, resulting in BAF60c and Deptor
  induction and insulin-independent AKT activation. This glucose sensing pathway works
  in concert with insulin signaling pathway to maintain postprandial glucose homeostasis
