caption: The role of the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) pathway in regulating the transcriptome.
  (A) Overall, ORF transcripts (ORF-Ts) in yeast are statistically under-enriched
  for NNS motifs, in particular the extended Nab3 motif UCUUG. The presence of NNS
  motifs on the antisense strand promotes early termination of antisense cryptic transcription
  (green Pol II) to minimize transcriptional interference on the ORF-T promoter. NNS-terminated
  transcripts are degraded by the combined action of TRAMP and the nuclear exosome
  (orange PacMan). (B) Medium and high levels of NNS motifs promote the release of
  Pol II paused at general regulatory factor (GRF) binding sites by roadblock-dependent,
  punctuated NNS termination (top panel). In the absence of GRFs, medium levels of
  NNS signals result in inefficient and diffuse termination by the NNS pathway (bottom
  panel).
