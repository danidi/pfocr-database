caption: The GR signal transduction pathway. (a) Corticosteroid-binding globulin-free
  cortisol diffuses into the cell, where it is either inactivated by 11β-HSD2 or bound
  by the cytosolic GR heterocomplex to initiate signal transduction. (b) GR is a modular
  protein that is composed of an N-terminal transactivation domain (AF-1), a central
  DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge region (H) and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain
  (LBD). A ligand-dependent transactivation domain (AF-2), nuclear localization signals
  (NLS) and protein–protein interaction domains are also found within the LBD. The
  GR heterocomplex contains the chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) that is associated
  with co-chaperones such as p23 and one of several tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)
  domain-containing proteins [,]. Ligand binding induces molecular rearrangement of
  the GR complex and importin-mediated nuclear translocation. (c) Cis regulation of
  gene expression involves a direct interaction between ligand-activated GR homodimers
  and DNA. GR induces inhibitory κB (IκB) gene expression by interacting with glucocorticoid
  response elements (GREs) and represses Fas ligand (FasL) gene transcription by interacting
  with negative GREs (nGREs) []. (d) Trans regulation of gene expression involves
  the tethering of GR to other transcription factors. Ligand-activated GR interacts
  with DNA-bound Stat5 to co-activate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) transcription
  from the Stat5-response element (Stat5-RE) []. However, ligand-activated GR interacts
  with the p65 subunit of NFκB [] and reduces recruitment of p65 to the κB-response
  element (κB-RE), thereby inhibiting NFκB-mediated fractalkine (CX3CL1) gene transcription
  [].
