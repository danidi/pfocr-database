caption: The JNK pathway promotes and maintains mitosis until the mitotic-to-endocycle
  transition point. At the transition, the Notch pathway acts through ttk on the cell
  cycle components stg, dap, and fzr in follicle cells to stop mitotic cycling and
  induce endocycling. Notch, which is modulated by Dl, dsh, and sgg, also plays a
  role in cell differentiation without the involvement of ttk, as shown by its effect
  on FAS3 expression.
