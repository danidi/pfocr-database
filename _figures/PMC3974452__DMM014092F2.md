caption: Pathways for the disposal of the mutant form of AT, ATZ, as potential therapeutic
  targets in ATD. Unlike wild-type AT, which efficiently traverses the conventional
  secretory pathway, the majority of mutant ATZ accumulates in the ER. Soluble forms
  of ATZ (ATZ monomers) are presumably degraded by the proteasomal pathway, whereas
  insoluble forms of ATZ (ATZ aggregates) are degraded by autophagy. Emerging candidate
  therapies that target these disposal pathways include carbamazepine, which has been
  shown to increase both proteosomal and autophagic disposal of ATZ. Autophagy enhancers
  such as certain phenothiazines and the novel Tat-beclin 1 peptide, an autophagy-inducing
  peptide, enhance autophagic disposal of ATZ. Ub, ubiquitin.
