caption: In response to MMS, human cells induce a signaling pathway that culminates
  in BRCA1/BARD1 downregulation. This prevents the unwanted assembly of the HR machinery
  at the early stage of the MMS-induced DNA damage response. At the second stage,
  recovery and assembly of HR proteins ensure the repair of DSBs generated by replication
  blocks.
