caption: Pathway diagram customization is available via the web interface, and lets
  the user control many aspects of the pathway diagram. A new option allows painting
  user-supplied Omics data directly to the pathway. The modified diagram can be exported
  to a pdf or postscript format file for incorporation in presentations or manuscripts.
