caption: Activation of PPRs in cardiomyocytes by DAMPs during myocardial I/R injury.
  Cardiomyocytes express a variety of PRRs including transmembrane receptors such
  as TLRs and CLRs, and cytoplasmic receptors such as NLRs. During myocardial I/R,
  DAMP molecules including HSP60, HSP72, HSC70 and HMGB1 can be released from ischemic
  cardiomyocytes, as well as cardiomyocytes undergoing lysis, necrosis and apoptosis.
  The release of HSP60, HSP72 and HSC70 is dependent on exosomes and/or lipid rafts,
  but not the classical secretory pathway. All the above DAMPs have been demonstrated
  to be able to activate TLR4 in cardiomyocytes. HSP72, but not HSP60, were shown
  to be able to activate TLR2 in cardiomyocytes. The activation of TLR2 and TLR9 by
  HMGB1 was demonstrated by studies in immune cells, but remains to be examined in
  cardiomyocytes. Endogenous DAMPs for other TLR subtypes, NLRs and CLRs remain unclear,
  though their expression has been recognized. The activation of cardiomyocyte TLR4,
  TLR2 and TLR9 results in NF-kB activation, which subsequently leads to inflammation,
  cardiac dysfunction and apoptotic effects. The activation of NLRs majorly results
  in the formation of inflammasome, which activates caspase-1 and trigger inflammation.
