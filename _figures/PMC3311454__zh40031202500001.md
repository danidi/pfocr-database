caption: Predations of chronic heart failure (CHF) on the O2 transport pathway. Although
  a dysfunctional heart and impaired ability to generate cardiac output are the core
  events, CHF is a multiorgan disease affecting all steps in the O2 transport pathway.
  CHF-induced lung dysfunction redistributes blood flow (Q̇) to the respiratory muscles
  via locomotory muscle vasoconstriction; there may be systemic anemia, systemic vasoconstriction,
  and elevated left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressures (LVEDPs) as well as a
  plethora of structural and functional adaptations (increased vasoconstriction, impaired
  vasodilation, and muscle pump) that compromise skeletal muscle perfusional and diffusional
  O2 transport. V̇A, alveolar ventilation; V̇E, expired ventilation; SNS, sympathetic
  nervous system; Q̇o2, whole body oxygen delivery (cardiac output × arterial O2 content);
  V̇o2, oxygen uptake; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; GPX, glutathione peroxidase. See text
  for more details.
