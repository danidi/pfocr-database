caption: Proposed model of p53 mediated PIK3CA regulation during stress. A. In sensitive
  cell, cisplatin activates p53 via PTM's (acetylation, phospho‐S15, phospho‐S20 and
  phospho‐S46) which alters p53 binding preference from binding site 1 to site 3 and
  4 present on PIK3CA promoter. Altered p53‐PIK3CA promoter interaction leads to PIK3CA
  attenuation and subsequently reduced AKT phosphorylation. Under these circumstances,
  cells experience reduced protein synthesis, survival and proliferation and up‐regulation
  of apoptotic machinery. B. In contrary, resistant cells in response to cisplatin
  acquire a ‘sensitive like’ state in terms of p53‐PIK3CA promoter interaction (occupancy
  only at site 1) and show reduced S15, S20 phosphorylation and acetylation with complete
  loss of pS46. Such p53‐PIK3CA promoter interaction is insufficient to decrease PIK3CA
  transcript level hence AKT phosphorylation remain unchanged. Under such condition,
  cells overcome the damage caused by cisplatin via active PI3K/AKT pathway and adapt
  an arrested state by down regulating apoptotic machinery.

  description: Proposed model of p53 mediated PIK3CA regulation during stress. A.
    In sensitive cell, cisplatin activates p53 via PTM's (acetylation, phospho‐S15,
