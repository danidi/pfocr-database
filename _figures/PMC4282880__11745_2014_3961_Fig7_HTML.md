caption: Proposed mechanisms for ischemia/reperfusion injury and for microvascular
  protection elicited by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA). a During ischemia/reperfusion,
  phospholipase A2 is activated and releases lyso PAF factor), the precursor of platelet
  activating factor (PAF) and arachidonic acid (ARA) from membrane phospholipids of
  leukocytes and endothelial cells. ARA is then converted to pro-inflammatory prostaglandins
  by cyclooxygenase (COX) and leukotrienes by (lipoxygenase). Leukotriene B4 (LTB4)
  and PAF elicit the disruption of the endothelial cell barrier with a consequent
  increase in macromolecular permeability. PAF and LTB4 also induce an increase in
  leukocyte-endothelium interactions. Simultaneously, an increase in nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity occurs in endothelial cells
  and in leukocytes. The excessive ROS production causes a depletion of NO and activates
  the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Reduced NO bioavailability results in an impairment
  of endothelium dependent vasodilation, an increase in leukocyte rolling, adhesion
  and transmigration. In the interstitium, the leukocytes release toxic metabolites
  and proteolytic enzymes, which induce parenchymal cell death; b Chronic oral treatment
  with n-3 PUFA results in their incorporation in membrane phospholipids. The lyso-PAF
  generation is inhibited, interrupting the pathway for PAF synthesis. PLA2 releases
  only eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Subsequently they
  are converted to prostanoids and leukotrienes with less inflammatory activities
  by COX and LOX, respectively. In the absence of PAF and LTB4, reduction of microvascular
  permeability occurs. EPA and DHA downregulate NADPH oxidase activity and neutralize
  ROS directly, reducing ROS concentration. A decrease in ROS concentration inhibits
  NF-κB activation and increases NO bioavailability. Consequently, an improvement
  of endothelium dependent vasodilation, inhibition of leukocyte-endothelium interactions
  and subsequent tissue damage occur
