caption: 'Signaling pathways involving the molecules reviewed. Molecules in pink boxes
  have oncogenic activities, while those in green boxes have tumor suppressive functions.
  Molecular markers that are reviewed in this article are shown in red to demonstrate
  where they work in oncogenic signaling. Mitogenic signals mediated by Ras induce
  Fos/Jun as early growth response genes, which, in turn, transactivate the cyclin
  D1 promoter and increase the protein. Cyclin D1 binds to Cdk4 and phosphorylates
  Rb and HDACs, releasing E2F/DPs from their negative constraint, and the cells enter
  S phase of the cell cycle.– Cyclin E and B-Myb are both direct targets of E2F/DPs
  and are explained in this review. Dmp1 is also a target for E2F/DPs. There are two
  classes of naturally occurring Cdk inhibitors: the Ink4 family proteins (p15, p16,
  p18, and p19) directly bind and antagonize the activities of Cdk4/6, while Cip/Kip
  family proteins (p21, p27, and p57) are pan-Cdk inhibitors for cyclin D/Cdk4/6,
  cyclin E/Cdk2, cyclin A/Cdk2 (or Cdc2), and cyclin B/Cdc2.– The Arf/Ink4a locus
  generates two independent tumor suppressor genes p19Arf and p16Ink4a that regulate
  the p53 and Rb pathways, respectively.– Arf is induced by potentially oncogenic
  signals stemming from the overexpression of oncogenes, such as c-Myc, E2F1, and
  activated Ras, which quenches inappropriate mitogenic signaling by diverting incipient
  cancer cells to undergo p53-dependent growth arrest or cell death.– In total, 30–50%
  of human BCs overexpress INK4a/ARF repressors (eg, Bmi1, Twist1, Ezh2, Tbx2/3, Pokemon,
  and Geminin),, to inactivate the tumor suppressive locus. Dmp1α directly binds and
  activates the Arf promoter and induces cell cycle arrest in an Arf-dependent fashion
  in the mesenchymal cells.,– Dmp1α also physically interacts with p53 and neutralizes
  all the activities of Mdm2 to activate the p53 pathway. Both Dmp1−/− and Dmp1+/−
  mice show hypersensitivity to develop tumors in response to carcinogen and γ-irradiation.,
  D-type cyclins inhibit Dmp1α’s transcriptional activity in a Cdk-independent fashion
  when E2Fs do not bind to the same promoter; however, cyclin D1 cooperates with Dmp1α
  to activate the Ink4a and Arf promoters to eliminate incipient tumor cells., YY1
  binds to Mdm2 to accelerate Mdm2-mediated polyubiquitination of p53. The Dmp1 promoter
  is activated by the oncogenic Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK-Jun or HER2-PI3K-Akt-NF-κB pathways,
  and thus, Ras- or HER2-driven carcinogenesis is accelerated in Dmp1-null mice. The
  DNA damage represses the Dmp1 promoter through activation of NF-κB suggesting dual
  regulation of the Arf-p53 pathway by NF-κB via different signaling cascades. Dmp1α
  induces both Ink4a and Arf proteins in vivo, and thus, Dmp1α-transgenic mice can
  be a novel model of aging. DMP1β is an oncogenic splice variant from the DMP1 locus;,
  the DMP1β/α ratio is significantly elevated in human BC and is associated with poor
  prognosis of patients. Both cyclin D1 and Ki67 proteins are upregulated in tumors
  from MMTV-DMP1βV5His mice, suggesting that they are critical targets. Cyclin E,
  B-Myb, Twist, and DMP1β are frequently overexpressed in human cancers (breast [this
  review], lung,– and others) and are associated with aggressive disease/shorter DFS,
  and thus are novel targets for molecular therapy.'
