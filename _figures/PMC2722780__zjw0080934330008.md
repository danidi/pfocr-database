caption: Putative BK-BKAP interactions derived from the BK interactome in mouse cochlea.
  A, 1), putative primary BKAPs at the membrane include calmodulin, GSTμ, 14-3-3,
  ApoA1, γ-actin, Lin7c, annexin V, cofilin. BK channels are known to have a functional
  link to RyR () and, thus, possibly to intracellular stores. This link may occur
  via CaM or GSTμ. Another putative link is through annexin, which is known to regulate
  intracellular Ca2+ stores (–) and also binds to ApoA1 (). ApoA1 alters the functional
  characteristics of BK. A, 2) Lin7, a primary BKAP, potentially interacts with BK
  as part of the Lin7·β-catenin complex. A BK link to Ca2+ channels in presynaptic
  sites may occur via the Lin7·Lin2 complex because Lin2 is known to interact with
  Ca2+ channels (). A, 3) The cytoskeletal protein γ-actin and cofilin, a protein
  involved in disassembly of actin, are BKAPs that may link BK to the cytoskeleton.
  Thus, the link between BK and γ-actin may be disrupted in DFNA20/26, a mutation
  of γ-actin that causes deafness in humans. Protein 40 kDa and calreticulin are part
  of this matrix as determined from the interactome. A, 4) BKAPs associated with BKmito
  may play a role in regulating intracellular Ca2+ in mitochondria, thus influencing
  apoptosis and phosphorylation. This premise is based on the interaction with cytochrome
  C, ATP synthase, and GAPDH, which regulate mitochondrial Ca2+. BKα interactions
  with antioxidants such as SOD, GSTμ, and glutathione peroxidase (GluPOD) may be
  involved in mediating hair cell apoptosis initiated by the activation of ROS that
  can cause NIHL. The BKAP, cytochrome C, is shown in relation to BAD and Caspase-9,
  which are part of the hair cell apoptosis pathway (). In addition, our data suggest
  HSP60 as a part of this pathway because it regulates BK expression inversely. A,
  5) While the ER is another source for Ca2+, here BKAPs such as GRP78 and calreticulin
  regulate the folding and assembly of BK. B, NMDAR is a binary partner of BK, forming
  a major hub in the BK interactome. There is a functional relationship to BK as NMDARs
  are known to provide an extracellular source for Ca2+ that activates BK. BKAPs common
  to both BKα and NMDAR include the structural and signaling proteins, neurofilament,
  and 14-3-3, respectively, and the Ca2+-binding proteins, calbindin, and calmodulin.
