caption: (A) Cytokines can be made up of multiple subunits. Some subunits are specific
  to 1 cytokine while others are shared by 2 or more cytokines. When a cytokine interacts
  with its receptor, which is also frequently composed of subunits (some shared),
  signals are initiated which induce gene expression patterns. Many cytokine receptors
  activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In designing therapeutic agents, is important
  to consider whether to target the shared vs unique components of cytokines, cytokine
  receptors, signaling molecules, transcription factors or downstream regulated genes,
  because each can produce different outcomes. It also is important is to design therapeutic
  agents that reduce inflammatory effects while retaining immune regulatory effects.
  (B) IL23 signaling is mediated by the engagement of the heterodimeric IL23 cytokine
  (comprising IL23p19 and IL12p40) with its heterodimeric receptor (comprising IL23R
  and IL12Rβ1). This engagement activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which in
  turn, regulates transcription of genes including IL17, IL21, and IL22. IL23 is important
  for maintenance of Th17 cells and for the generation of the more ‘pathogenic’ Th17
  cells that contribute to intestinal inflammation. IL23 and its receptor share subunits
  with IL12 (IL12p40) and the IL12 receptor (IL12RB1), respectively. IL12 contributes
  to the differentiation of Th1 cells. Therefore, agents that target the IL12p40 subunit
  affect IL12 and IL23 signaling, and therefore, Th1 and Th17 cells. In contrast,
  agents that target IL23p19 disrupt only IL23 signaling and therefore the IL23-dependent
  regulation of Th17 cells, as well as other cells regulated by IL23. The figure shows
  agents targeting molecules at distinct levels in the pathway.
