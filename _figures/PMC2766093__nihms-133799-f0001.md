caption: During liver injury, ligation of surface death receptors by FasL, TNFα or
  TRAIL (extrinsic apoptosis pathway), promotes hepatocyte apoptosis, through recruitment
  of cytoplasmic adaptor molecules and activation of caspase-8. Caspases amplify the
  apoptotic signaling cascade, and commits the hepatocyte to the final execution (apoptosis)
  pathway (activated caspase-3). The organelle-based (intrinsic apoptosis pathway),
  non-receptor mediated apoptosis-pathway involves various stimuli (growth factors,
  cytokines, free radicals, hypoxia, viral infections and toxins) that disrupt the
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane
  potential. These changes lead to the release of pro-apoptotic proteins, which initiate
  the mitochondrial-apoptosis pathway. Clearance of apoptotic bodies occurs through
  phagocytosis by resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) and hepatic stellate cells.
  Engulfment of apoptotic bodies is associated with increased ROS production and activation
  of transcription factors, NF-κB. In turn, this leads to enhanced production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (TNFα) and chemokines (MIP2, IL8). TNFα may further drive the extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway through a feed-forward, paracrine loop. Phagocytosis of apoptotic
  bodies also induces the production of the pro-fibrogenic cytokines, TGFβ and IL13,
  via the PI3K and MAPK pathways.
