caption: Graphical summary illustrating how molecular signatures, such as the p53(box-I)
  motif, co-evolve at the mRNA and protein levels along with interacting partners,
  such as the MDM2 E3 ligase (MDM family), to mediate the transition from an environmentally-induced
  type of interaction and function to a well-regulated interplay, driven by specific
  molecular interactions forming a signalling pathway that mediates the regulation
  of p53. Such signatures are of high potential value in molecular diagnostics for
  genetic diseases such as cancer and in precision medicine
