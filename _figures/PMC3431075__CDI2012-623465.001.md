caption: 'NF-κB members and NF-κB signaling. The NF-κB family is composed of five
  related transcription factors: p50, p52, RelA (p65), c-Rel, and Rel-B. These transcription
  factors are related through homology domains in which they form homodimers and heterodimers
  that bind NF-κB DNA sites, thus modulating gene expression. P50 and p52 are derived
  from p105 and p100 precursors, respectively. NF-κB is silenced by interactions with
  inhibitory IkB family members in the cytoplasm. There are two NF-κB signaling pathways
  known as the canonical pathway (or classical) and the noncanonical (or alternative)
  pathway. In both pathways, IkB kinase is activated and induces proteasomal degradation
  of the IkB inhibitor, thus allowing the translocation of the transcription factor
  subunits into the nucleus and induce transcription of target genes. BCR crosslinking
  provides the canonical NF-κB signal and p100 production, while BLys receptor induce
  accumulation of p52, a protein deriving from p100 that activates NF-κB 2 via the
  noncanonical pathway.'
