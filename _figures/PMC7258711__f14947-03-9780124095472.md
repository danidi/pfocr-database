caption: Glycoprotein ERQC/ERAD system in mammalian cells. Immediately after transfer
  of the N-glycan to the nascent polypeptide by OST, the non-reducing end Glc is removed
  by the action of α-glucosidase I. That reaction is followed by the action of α-glucosidase
  II, which removes the middle Glc residue, thus generating the mono-glucosylated
  core glycan. Calnexin (CNX) or calreticulin (CRT), depending upon the accessibility
  to the location of the glycan, are associated with the mono-glucosylated glycan.
  This interaction affords time for the proteins to mature with the aid of various
  lumenal chaperones. At the same time, the CNX/CRT-binding protein, ERp57, provides
  assistance in forming the correct disulfide bond while being associated with CNX/CRT.
  When α-glucosidase II removes the final glucose, the glycoprotein dissociates from
  CNX/CRT. The protein then either (A) leaves the ER, if it is folded properly or
  forms the correct complex to acquire a functional conformation, or (B) is recognized,
  and reglucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glycoprotein glucosyltransferase
  (UGGT), if the protein is partially malfolded, thus permitting it to reenter another
  CNX/CRT cycle, or (C) is retrotranslocated from the ER into the cytosol for degradation
  (ERAD), if the protein folding state is not recognized by UGGT. The (C) process
  is guided by the trimming of α1,2-linked mannose residues by EDEM1/3/MAN1B1/Golgi
  α-mannosidase I, and the recognition of the exposed α1,6-linked mannose by OS-9/XTP-3B.
  In pathway (A), lectins such as ERGIC-53 serve as a cargo receptor to facilitate
  the exit of glycoproteins to their respective destination. Glycoproteins without
  the correct processing of N-glycans can sometimes still exit the ER; in such cases
  there are several back-up systems to correct the problem. For example, VIP36 may
  return proteins with immature glycans back to the ER to allow them more time to
  fold properly, or endo-α-1,2-mannosidase (not shown in this figure) may remove the
  improper Glc residue(s) and the first mannose of the A branch, to assist N-glycans
  to mature correctly. In pathway (C), aberrant glycoproteins, which are disposed
  of into the cytosol through retrotranslocation-specific channels (“retrotranslocons”),
  are recognized by an SCFFbs ubiquitin ligase complex for polyubiquitination or are
  deglycosylated by PNGase, and the proteins are ultimately degraded by 26S proteasomes.
  Note that a part of this scheme is still hypothetical and not all the processes
  have been unequivocally confirmed. For more details, see the text.
