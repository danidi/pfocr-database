caption: Myeloid cells that lack signaling (due to Ifnar gene deletion, pharmacological
  blockade with anti-IFNAR MAbs, or IFN signaling antagonism by viruses) are more
  susceptible to infection. In the context of WNV infection, increased viral replication
  results in enhanced RNA PAMP generation, which activates MAVS via recruitment to
  the mitochondria. This results in downstream activation of IRF-3 and NF-κB and also
  assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. IRF-3 activation and nuclear translocation promotes
  induction of a limited set of ISGs. NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation promotes
  expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNF-α) and chemokines (CCL5
  and CXCL10). Soluble TNF-α can modulate endothelial cells function and integrity
  and also induce complement factor expression in myeloid and hepatic cells, including
  C3 and factor B. Higher levels of C3 and factor B in the context of increased WNV
  in plasma results in excessive complement activation (via the alternative pathway),
  which can liberate the C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins. Along with TNF-α, these promote
  changes to vascular permeability and tone that result in hypotension and visceral
  organ (e.g., liver and kidney) damage. Independently, excessive virus infection
  in restricted tissues (e.g., spleen and LN) can cause organ damage. The pathological
  effects of this cascade can be mitigated by administration of blocking MAbs to TNF-α
  or C5.
