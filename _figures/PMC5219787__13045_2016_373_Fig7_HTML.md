caption: Jak/STAT pathway. The corresponding cytokine or growth factor ligand binds
  to the cell surface receptor prompting activated JAK2 protein to phosphorylate tyrosine
  residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. More so, JAK2 also phosphorylates
  recruited signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) which results
  in STAT dimerization via conserved Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. STAT dimers then
  translocate to the nucleus where they induce transcription of target genes. In addition,
  JAK acts as a docking site for SH2 containing adapter proteins including Src homology
  2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), growth factor receptor bound protein-2
  (GRB2), and Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein (SHC). GRB2 which
  is associated with Son of Sevenless (SOS) can bind the tyrosine phosphorylated receptor
  directly or indirectly by way of the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein (SHC).
  This binding results in the translocation of SOS to the membrane. At the membrane,
  SOS exchanges GDP for GTP on Ras guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. Ras-GTP can
  then activate MAPK cascade. Aside from RAS, JAK/STAT also interacts with PI3 and
  AKT pathways []. Under normal conditions gene expression is regulated by negative
  feedback mechanisms including the production of the negative regulator suppressors
  of cytokine signaling (SOCS)
