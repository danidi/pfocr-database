caption: Ras is normally activated in response to the binding of extracellular ligands
  to various receptors. Among these is epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to its
  cognate receptor EGFR, as shown in Figure . Upon EGF binding to the extracellular
  domain of EGFR, the intracellular domain of EGFR forms an asymmetric dimer in the
  cytosol. EGFR and its ERBB receptor family members can form homo- or hetero-dimers.
  Downstream signaling proceeds through Ras in the Raf-MEK-ERK and/or PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  pathways. The figure provides a sequence of events induced by a constitutive mutation
  taking place in EGFR, keeping it in an active state even in the absence of its ligand.
  Drug treatment abolishes EGFR signaling; however, a drug resistant mutation leads
  to overexpression of another receptor, populating an otherwise low-activity second
  receptor. (A) L858R mutation in EGFR kinase (the circled R) causes non-small cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC) by constitutively activating its kinase domain []. Under normal
  conditions EGFR largely populates its inactive state. The mutation shifts the free
  energy landscape of EGFR stabilizing its active with respect to its inactive conformation
  even in the absence of a bound EGF. (B) Drugs such as the 4-anilinoquinazolines
  gefitinib (Iressa) [] and erlotinib (Tarceva) [] can inhibit the activity of EGFR
  L858R mutant. (C) However, tumors develop resistance, in this case one possibility
  is through overexpression of MET []. Overexpressed MET leads to phosphorylation
  of ERBB3 which interacts with ERBB2. The ERBB2/ERBB3 receptor can activate Ras and
  thus its PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, independent of EGFR. A key question is how
  the blockage of an addicted growth pathway is able to rewire the oncogenic cellular
  network within a short period, leading to MET's overexpression and ERBB3 activation.
