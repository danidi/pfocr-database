caption: Schematic representation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. DNA damages
  are sensed and repaired in multi-protein complexes. Signaling caused by this damage
  results in the activation of different mediators of the damage response and then
  results in cell cycle arrest and a choice between repair or progression to apoptosis
