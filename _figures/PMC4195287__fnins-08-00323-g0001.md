caption: Model of the intracellular mechanism of GnIH and its receptor (GPR147), glutamate
  and its receptor, dopamine that may control male socio-sexual behavior by regulating
  the activity of aromatase and neuroestrogen synthesis in the brain. GPR147 is expressed
  on aromatase immunoreactive cells in the brain. GPR147 is coupled to Gαi protein
  that inhibits the activity of adenylate cyclase (AC) and decreases cAMP production
  and the activity of protein kinase A (PKA). Inhibition of AC/cAMP/PKA pathway may
  thus decrease phosphorylated aromatase and increase dephosphorylated aromatase.
  17β-estradiol (E2) synthesized from androgen such as testosterone (T) by aromatase
  in the brain especially in the preoptic area (POA) regulates male aggression. It
  has been previously demonstrated that aromatase activity is rapidly down-regulated
  by phosphorylation, and this down-regulation is blocked by kinase inhibitors. The
  administration of GnIH activates aromatase by decreasing phosphorylated aromatase,
  and stimulates neuroestrogen synthesis in the brain. Aromatase activity and estrogen
  concentration in the brain especially in the POA are low in the morning when the
  birds are active, but aromatase activity and E2 concentration gradually increased
  until the evening when the birds became inactive. E2 release in the POA also increased
  in the evening. Finally, centrally administered E2 at higher doses in the morning
  inhibited aggressive behavior. These results suggest that GnIH inhibits aggressive
  behavior by directly activating aromatase and increasing neuroestrogen synthesis
  in the brain beyond its optimum concentration for the expression of aggressive behavior.
  Glutamate was shown to decrease the activity of aromatase by phosphorylation, and
  dopamine may act as an alternative substrate for aromatase to compete with testosterone
  and prevent its transformation into estrogens. Glutamate and dopamine may thus facilitate
  male socio-sexual behavior by decreasing the activity of aromatase and maintaining
  the optimum concentration of neuroestrogen for the expression of male socio-sexual
  behavior.

  description: Model of the intracellular mechanism of GnIH and its receptor (GPR147),

    coupled to Gαi protein that inhibits the activity of adenylate cyclase (AC) and
    decreases cAMP production and the activity of protein kinase A (PKA). Inhibition
    of AC/cAMP/PKA pathway may thus decrease phosphorylated aromatase and increase
