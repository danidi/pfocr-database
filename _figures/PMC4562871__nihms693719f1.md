caption: Paracellular flux across the tight junction epithelium can defined as two
  distinct pathways, pore and leak. The cytokine IL-13 induces claudin-2 expression
  that, in turn, enhances water and small solute, e.g. ion, flux across the high capacity,
  size- and charge-slective pore pathway. Conversely, TNF activates myosin light chain
  kinase (MLCK) that triggers caveolin-mediated occludin removal from the tight junction.
  This results in increased macromolecular flux across the low capacitry, relatively
  nonslective leak pathway.
