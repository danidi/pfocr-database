caption: 'Schematic diagram summarizing potential tamoxifen targets related to sphingolipid
  biosynthesis in Leishmania. Reduced IPC levels (blue arrows) in L. amazonensis promastigotes
  treated with tamoxifen are related to IPC synthase inhibition (red bars). Reduced
  PI and IPC intracellular levels (blue arrows) could also be related to reduced incorporation
  of inositol into the cell or to direct or indirect inhibition of PI and/or IPC synthase
  (purple bars). The increased levels of acylated ceramide may be a result from intracellular
  ceramide accumulation (green arrow) due to its reduced use as a source for IPC synthesis.
  Labeled PI observed in [3H]-Sphingosine-labeled parasites may be generated by hexadecenal
  pathway from sphingosine-1-phosphate degradation. DAG: diacylglycerol; CDP-DAG:
