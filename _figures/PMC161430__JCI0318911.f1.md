caption: (a) Generic schema for the cytokine/adaptor/MAPK signaling paradigm. Cytokines,
  such as TNF-α, trigger oligomerization of their enzymatically inactive cognate receptors.
  The conformational change in the receptor complex following ligand binding facilitates
  recruitment of adaptor proteins. These adaptor proteins within the receptor complex
  interact directly or indirectly with upstream kinases (MAPKKK) permitting their
  activation with subsequent phosphorylation and activation of downstream kinases
  (MAPKK/MAPK). (b) Model of TNF-α signaling pathway through TRAF2/ASK1 employing
  the cytokine/adaptor/MAPK paradigm. Triggering of TNF-R1 leads to recruitment of
  the adaptor TRAF2, and concomitant activation of an unknown phosphatase via a mechanism
  yet to be identified. TRAF2 mediates the association of ASK1 with the newly identified
  Ras-GAP AIP1, which facilitates the release of ASK1 from its endogenous inhibitor
  14-3-3. Disruption of the ASK1/14-3-3 complex and de-phosphorylation of ASK1 by
  the unknown phosphatase result in the activation of ASK1. ASK1, in turn, activates
  JNK via an MKK4- or MKK6-dependent pathway. Activation of JNK positively regulates
  the apoptotic machinery by transcription-dependent (i.e., activation of the transcription
  factor AP-1) and transcription-independent (i.e., phosphorylation and activation
  of proapototic Bcl-2 proteins Bim and Bmf) mechanisms. P, phosphate.
