caption: APP trafficking and co-residence with secretases. After synthesized in the
  membrane-bound polysomes, the N-terminal signal peptide is removed during its translocation
  into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). N-glycosylation (N-Gly) and palmitoylation
  (Pal) is crucial for APP transporting to the Golgi apparatus and Trans-Golgi-Network
  (TGN), while O-glycosylation (O-Gly) in Golgi apparatus is essential for APP transporting
  to the plasma membrane (PM). The uncleaved APP is rapidly internalized by the endosome
  and sorted into three pathways. Most APP is sorted into late endosome-lysosome pathway
  for degradation while a small fraction of APP is recycled back to the PM or retrograded
  to the TGN. Moreover, the co-residence of APP with secretases (e.g., α-, β-, γ-secretase)
  along the secretory pathway might contribute to the APP processing and Aβ generation.
