caption: Proposed pathway for the cell restitution induced by UDP/TGF-β signalling.
  UDP released from wounded cells affects neighbouring cells to induce de novo synthesis
  of TGF-β through activation of the P2Y6 receptor. Up-regulated P2Y6 receptors promote
  UDP-induced responses (positive-feedback loop). UDP and TGF-β cooperate with each
  other to induce migration and contribute to the intestinal epithelial wound healing.
