caption: Increased Flux in Isoprenoids Metabolism in Response to Chloroquine. Illustration
  of isoprenoid metabolism reactions showing increases in flux levels in both chloroquine-treated
  models versus untreated models (represented in grey). 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
  synthase utilizes thiamine diphosphate as a cofactor (marked by dotted arrow). We
  also predict a shift in thiamine diphosphate production, where the de novo synthesis
  pathway (shown in white) and the import pathway (shown in solid black) is used during
  short- and long-term treatment, respectively. Pharmacologic inhibitors target isoprenoid
  metabolism (fosmidomycin, indicated in red). Connectivity to other metabolic pathways
  are shown (dotted lines)
