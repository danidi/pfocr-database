caption: Outline of the major cell surface receptor-mediated signaling pathways important
  in the differentiation, survival, and function of melanocytes. In melanoma, regulatory
  disruption via activating mutations or gene amplifications of oncogenes or deletion,
  epigenetic silencing, or inactivating mutations of tumor suppressor genes of either
  upstream or down stream constituents of these pathways can be commonly found. Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway
  are 2 crucial pathways activated by numerous growth factors and cell surface receptors.
  Binding of growth factors to their respective receptors leads to, via adapter proteins
  (not shown), activation of RAS proteins, which phosphorylate the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MEK) kinases, which then act on extracellular-related kinase (ERK)
  kinases. ERK kinases also interact with the PI3K-AKT pathway. Phosporylated ERK
  kinases (ERK-P) translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription factors, which
  promote cell cycle progression and proliferation. The PI3K-AKT pathway mediates
  cell survival signaling via growth factors such as PDGF, NGF, and IGF-1. Phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN) inhibits growth factor signaling by inactivating phosphatidylinositol
  triphosphate (PIP3) generated by PI3K. Activated PI3K converts the plasma membrane
  lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphonate to PIP3, which acts as a second messenger
  leading to the phosphorylation AKT and subsequent up-regulation of cell cycle, growth,
  and survival proteins. AKT can also up-regulate mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin),
  S6K, and NFκβ leading to cell growth and inhibition of apoptosis. Wnt-Frizzled-β-catenin
  pathway. In the Wnt-Frizzled-β-catenin pathway, β-catenin plays a central role in
  cell adhesion and cell signaling. Wnt ligands activate the G-protein—coupled receptor,
  Frizzled, which blocks the breakdown of β-catenin by inactivation of the kinase
  GSK3. β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus, where
  it binds to LEF—TCF transcription factors and increases the expression of several
  genes, including microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) important in melanocyte
  survival and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) crucial for cell invasion. JAK/Stat
  pathway can be activated by cytokines as well as growth factors such as EGF. JAK-STAT
  pathway is mediated by Janus kinase (JAK), a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates
  STAT proteins localized to the plasma membrane. Phosphorylated STAT proteins are
  translocated to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription leading to inhibition
  of apoptosis and angiogenesis. α-MSH-MC1R or Microphthalmia-associated transcription
  factor (MITF) pathway. MITF is regulated at both the transcriptional level via activation
  of melanocortin receptor 1 (MCR1) pathway and at the posttranslation level via ERK
  phosphorylation (not shown). MC1R activates cyclic AMP (cAMP), which activates the
  camp response-element binding protein (CREB) leading to increased expression of
  MITF. MITF stimulates melanin production and cell cycle arrest in normal melanocytes,
  and in melanoma cells, it protects against apoptosis and adds chemotherapy resistance.
