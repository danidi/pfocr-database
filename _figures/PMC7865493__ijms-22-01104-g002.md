caption: Molecular interactions within the AhR signaling pathway []. In the nucleus,
  AhR/ARNT complex binds to the XRE sequence, thus initiating the transcription of
  AhR-responsive genes, such as CYP1A1. CYP1A1 activity is associated with ROS production.
  Furthermore, AhR ligands are degraded by CYP1A1. Regarding chemically stable ligands,
  such as dioxins, sustained CYP1A1 activation leads to enhanced ROS generation. On
  the other hand, several AhR ligands activate nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related
  factor-2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor, which induces expression of antioxidative
  enzymes (e.g., heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and NQO1). Moreover, AhR signaling is associated
  with the differentiation of immune cells, such as Th17 and Treg. Regarding inflammatory
  skin diseases, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, AhR-mediated IL-22 production
  plays a crucial role in alleviating skin lesions. AhR/ARNT interaction upregulates
  filaggrin (FLG) and loricrin (LOR) expression via activation of the OVO-like 1 (OVOL1)
  transcription factor. Both FLG and LOR play a key role in epidermal differentiation.
  However, IL-4/IL-13-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 6
  (STAT6) activation inhibits the OVOL1/FLG/LOR pathway. AhR stimulation may inhibit
  STAT6 and upregulate FLG and LOR expression. The pathogenic implication of AhR signaling
  in inflammatory skin diseases is not fully understood as the activation of the AhR/OVOL1/FLG/LOR
  pathway may become harmful. As the use of rapid metabolizing AhR ligands, such as
  FICZ, may alleviate skin inflammation, sustainable activation of this pathway by
  dioxins exacerbates epidermal barrier dysfunction. The scheme is based on previously
  reported data [,,,]. ↑-activation, upregulation, ↓-downregulation, T-arrow-inhibition.
