caption: A schematic overview of the molecular pathways involved in necroptosis. Signaling
  can occur via 4 mentioned modes, namely TNFα binding TNFR1 in a paracrine as well
  as autocrine manner, interferon (IFN) binding IFN receptors (IFNR) and endosomal
  viral double stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). TNFα-induced
  signaling results in the formation of the pro-survival complex I which signals to
  apoptosis, necroptosis or, as seen in , to cell survival. An NF-κB-independent JNK
  signaling pathway via EDD activation following DNA damage and association with RIP1
  results in autocrine TNFα production, also seen in . TRAF2 stabilization of complex
  I is inhibited by the interaction between the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein
  (MLKL), TRAF2 and TNFR2 as promoted by cIAP-induced TRAF2 ubiquitination. Removal
  of caspase inhibition and ubiquitination of RIP1, either by loss of cellular inhibitors
  of apoptosis (cIAPs) or deubiquitination by cylindromatosis (CYLD), allows for the
  formation of the cytosolic complex IIa and IIb which may result in apoptosis or,
  upon inhibition of caspases, necroptosis via the formation of the necrosome. The
  necrosome forms by the interaction between RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL which then results
  in the interaction between RIP3 and the long and short isoforms of the phosphoglycerate
  mutase family member 5 protein (PGAM5) to activate dynamin-related protein (DRP1)
  or induce plasma membrane permeabilisation (PMP). DRP1 causes mitochondrial fission
  and PMP results in the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).
  The ripoptosome can be recruited to the necrosome by an unknown mechanism to result
  in necroptotic cell death. Within the ripotosome, cellular FLIP isoforms either
  promote or inhibit cell death. Dimerised RIP1 interacts with FADD to either activate
  Caspase-8 or, if cFLIPL dimerises with Caspase-8 a non-canonical catalytic complex
  is formed both resulting in inactivation of RIP1/3. One outcome is apoptosis and
  the other pro-survival signaling. Another pro-survival cascade involves NF-κB-dependent
  JNK and IKK signaling, as seen in . The pathway can be artificially activated by
  SMAC-mimetics, as well as zFAD.fmk through the inhibition of apoptosis or by activation
  of ripoptosome formation with Poly(I:C). Necroptosis is inhibited experimentally
  by inhibition of RIP1 kinase activity with Nec-1s and at MLKL by Necrosulfonamide
  (NSA).
