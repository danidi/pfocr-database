caption: Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced activation of the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (Erk) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. On
  binding of TGF-β to its receptor complex, the constitutively active type II receptors
  phosphorylate the type I receptors at Ser/Thr residues, and induce tyrosine phosphorylation
  of both the type I and II receptors and ShcA. The phosphorylated tyrosines then
  recruit Grb2/Sos to activate Erk1/2 MAPK through activation of Ras, Raf, and MEK1/2
  in a Smad-independent manner. ShcA directs the TGF-β receptors to caveolin-1-containing
  lipid raft for Erk MAPK activation. Clathrin-dependent internalization of TGF-β
  receptors into the Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA)-containing early endosome
  is required for Smad activation. Activated Erk MAPK contributes to epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) by phosphorylating targeted transcription factors, which in turn
  control transcription of EMT-related genes without or in cooperation with activated
  Smad complexes. Erk MAPK also directly phosphorylates R-Smads, thus controlling
  their activity.
