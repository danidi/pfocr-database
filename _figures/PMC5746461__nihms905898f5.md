caption: Depicted regulatory interactions (arrows) at the indicated stages of life
  are based on germ line or conditional loss of function data for each indicated TF.
  Terminal effector genes are depicted in rectangles and transcription factors in
  ovals. 5-HT pathway genes encoding 5-HT synthesis (Tph2, Ddc, Gch1, Qdpr), reuptake,
  (Slc6a4, Slc22a3), vesicular transport (Slc18a2) and metabolism (Maoa, Maob) are
  shown in rectangles with black letters. Terminal effector genes depicted in blue
  letters (Gria4, Htr1a, Htr1b, Adra1b, Lpar1, Hcrtr1) encode AMPA receptor subunit
  GLUR4 and GPCRs required for responses to diverse synaptic inputs. Arrows indicate
  that deficiency of a specific TF results in complete or partial loss of gene expression
  of a particular target gene in some or nearly all 5-HT neurons in which the TF expressed.
  Red blunted line from Pet1 to Hcrtr1 indicates that loss of Pet1 leads to upregulation
  of Hcrtr1. Slc17a8 (VGLUT3) is a subtype-specific terminal effector of 5-HT neurons.
  Homeobox gene, Engrailed1, (En1) encodes a 5-HT subtype specific TF as it is expressed
  only in r1-derived 5-HT and non-5-HT neurons but not at more posterior hindbrain
  levels. Dashed line indicates that Lmx1b controls maintenance of Pet1 at fetal stage.
  Solid circles indicate that evidence in support of direct regulation of a TF or
  terminal effector gene by a particular TF was obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation
  (ChIP)–PCR or ChIP sequencing. In the case of Htr1a, evidence in support of direct
  regulation by Pet1 was obtained with cell line reporter assays and in vitro mobility
  shift DNA binding assays (). Further ChIP studies may reveal PET1 occupancy at the
  other PET1 regulated effector genes shown in the scheme. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
  has not been reported for LMX1B in 5-HT neurons. Red curved arrow indicates positive
  autoregulation by Pet1.
