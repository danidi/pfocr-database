caption: Model/summary of RECQ1 as a mediator of replication stress response induced
  by gemcitabine in MDA-MB-231 cells. RECQ1 is involved in RPA recruitment to DNA
  damaged sites and facilitates activation of ATR–ChK1 pathway to resolve the DNA
  damage induced by gemcitabine. In the absence of RECQ1, RPA recruitment to damage
  sites is decreased, leading to defective checkpoint activation accompanied by DNA
  damage accumulation that eventually leads to cell death by apoptosis. RECQ1 loss
  in combination with gemcitabine and ChK1 inhibitor facilitates cell death by mitotic
  catastrophe.
