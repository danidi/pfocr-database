caption: Transcriptional co-ordination between YAP1/Hippo and p53 family proteins
  in tumorigenesis or apoptosis. (A) YAP1 can directly bind to mutant p53 and induce
  a pro-tumorigenic transcriptional program (). (B) Super-tumor suppressor p5353.54,
  a stable p53 mutant due to its diminished ability to interact with MDM2, hyperactivates
  Ptpn14 expression that negatively regulates YAP1 in pancreatic cancer (). (C) p63
  physically interacts with the chromatin-remodeling factor, ACTL6A, to suppress the
  expression of WWC1, a negative regulator of YAP1 nuclear translocation, which leads
  to tumorigenesis in head and neck cancer (). (D) YAP1 recruits factors such as PML
  and p300 to the p73 pro-apoptotic target gene promoters (; ).
