caption: Cytokine signalling networks in women with chlamdyial infections (a) or gonorrhoea
  (b) were evaluated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The networks that included
  the most up‐regulated cytokines with the greatest degree of interconnectivity in
  women with chlamydia or gonorrhoea both included interleukin‐17 (IL‐17) and multiple
  pro‐inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Median cytokine concentrations in cervicovaginal
  lavage from women who had chlamydia or gonorrhoea that were more than twofold above
  the median in the no sexually transmitted infection/bacterial vaginosis (STI/BV)
  group were considered up‐regulated (coloured red). Relationships between IL‐17 and
  other cytokines are coloured blue. Dotted lines indicate indirect associations.
