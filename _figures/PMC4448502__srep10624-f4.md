caption: 'Pathway analysis showed a strong role for early response genes and sterol
  regulatory elements. Lung epithelial cells from three patients with no known lung
  diseases underwent the following treatments: no treatment/vehicle control, pneumolysin
  (400 ng/mL) alone for 4 hours, simvastatin (1 μM) 24 hour treatment alone and both
  simvastatin (1 μM) 24 hour pretreatment and pneumolysin (400 ng/mL) for 4 hours.
  Iregulon cytoscape plugin was used to interrogate the proximal promoter (500 bp
  within the TSS) of statistically significant transcripts (p value adjusted for false
  discovery by Benjamini–Hochberg cutoff of 0.1 or less) upregulated in response to
  treatment as compared to no treatment. EGR1 (Early growth response gene 1), EGR2
  (Early growth response gene 2), SREBP1 (Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription
  factor 1) and SREBP2 (Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2)
  were all found to have putative binding sites to all transcripts shown (pink nodes).
  Normalized mRNA-seq expression levels, averaged across all three patients, are shown
  via a pink to red gradient for all transcripts as fold change values, comparing
  treatment indicated to no treatment/vehicle controls.'
