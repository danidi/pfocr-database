caption: A hypothesis of the heme biogenic plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling
  pathway. (a) In plastids (left), the transition of proplastid to chloroplast is
  indicated from left to right. Blue circles indicate GUN1-dependent droplets and
  red symbols represent ferrochelatase (FC)1-dependent heme. 1. At the initial phase
  of proplastid to chloroplast transition, a putative GUN-dependent droplet may form
  in proplastids, which enhances nuclear-encoded polymerase (NEP)-dependent transcription
  and translation, import of nuclear-encoded proteins, and heme biosynthesis. Synthesized
  heme may bind to the GUN1-dependent droplets. 2. During chloroplast biogenesis,
  GUN1 is degraded by Clp-protease-dependent manner, causing disappearance of the
  blue circles. 3. FC1-derived hemes bound to GUN1 condensates were released and emitted
  from plastids via cytosolic or ER-plastid membrane contact sites (MCSs)-dependent
  pathway (dashed lines) through a plastid-envelop-localized putative transporter
  (orange circles). In the cytosolic pathway, heme may bind to cytosolic heme carrier
  proteins (green circles) to reach other organelles. 4. In the nucleus, heme may
  inactivate PIFs or activate transcription factors, GLK1, and/or HY5. 5. Consequently,
  PhANG expression is activated. (b) In the wild type, when chloroplasts are rendered
  dysfunctional by inhibitor treatments, Clp-protease-dependent degradation is protected
  resulting in the dispersion of the GUN1 droplet (blue circle), as well as retention
  of heme (red symbols) in plastids. (c) In gun1, when the chloroplasts become dysfunctional,
  heme can be emitted from plastids because the GUN1-dependent condensates are deficient.
