caption: 'Oxidative stress as an intermediary pathway of OSA-associated CV disease.
  The intermittent hypoxia characteristic of OSA leads to increased oxidative burst
  of leukocytes via activation of NOX. Excessively produced ROS enhance lipid peroxidation
  and isoprostane formation. NO bioavailability is reduced by diminished expression
  of eNOS and its inhibition by ADMA. Finally, antioxidant capacity is impaired in
  affected patients. ADMA: asymmetric dimethylarginine; eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase; NO: nitric oxide; NOX: NADPH oxidase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SOD:
  superoxide dismutase.'
