caption: A model for TNF-α-induced expression of the inflammation-associated genes
  mediated by PLCϵ. In Caco2 cells, TNF-α stimulation induces the early phase of NF-κB
  activation via the canonical NF-κB pathway involving IKK, leading to the expression
  of the inflammation-associated genes (left). Concomitantly, it induces the late
  phase of NF-κB activation via enhancing the production and secretion of LPA, which
  activates the PLCϵ-PKD axis in an autocrine manner and leads to phosphorylation
  of PEA15. The phosphorylated PEA15 binds to the activated RSK and holds it in the
  cytoplasm, thereby inducing IκB phosphorylation.
