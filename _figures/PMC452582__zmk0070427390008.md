caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed survival mechanism induced by 17-β-estradiol.
  Estradiol activates ERK/p90RSK1 and PI-3K/Akt pathways possibly through Ras-dependent
  mechanisms. On activation of these signal pathways, proapoptotic BAD is phosphorylated
  at S112 and S136. Phoshphorylated BAD is sequestrated by 14-3-3 (and possibly by
  other molecules), thus preventing its action on the mitochondrial membrane. This
  mechanism ensures cell survival and may constitute the antiapoptotic effects observed
  when the apoptotic stimuli are present simultaneously with E2. E2 could not exert
  this protective effect when phosphorylation sites in BAD are mutated to unphosphorylatable
  residues. E2-mediated signaling pathway is indicated by black arrows. Apoptotsis-inducing
  agents change mitochondrial membrane integrity and facilitate the release of substances
  such as cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. These in turn mediate a cascade of reactions,
  eventually leading to apoptosis that can be readily identified by characteristic
  features pointed out in the figure. Inhibition of BAD protein level by antisense
  mRNA could drastically reduce the amount of apoptosis observed with apoptotic agents,
  providing evidence for the critical involvement of BAD in this scenario. Signal
  pathways mediated by apoptotic stimuli are indicated by white arrows. Dominant negative
  Ras (RasN17) dramatically increases apoptosis even under exponential growth conditions
  and blocked the protective effects of E2, suggesting an essential cell survival
  role for Ras.
