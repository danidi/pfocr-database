caption: Interaction of CLL cells and the lymph node microenvironment. Stimulation
  of the BCR complex and other receptor and cell surface genes (CD79B, CD22, CD83,
  FCRG2B) leads to downstream changes in regulation. Affected genes such as those
  of the DUSP family, involved in the regulation of the MAPK pathway, may explain
  transcriptional differences observed for this pathway. Up-regulation of transcriptional
  regulators, like FOS and JUN, may trigger proliferation and inflammation processes
  that could be at the origin of C2 cells. Other genes involved in cell–cell signaling
  are also up-regulated in C2.
