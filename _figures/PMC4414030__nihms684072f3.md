caption: Proposed role of apoE isoform-specific effects on the cerebrovascular system
  via regulation of CypA-NF-κB-MMP9 pathway and Aβ clearance. A. Astrocyte (A) secreted
  apoE2 and apoE3 interacts with LRP1 on pericytes and suppresses the proinflammatory
  CypA-NF-κB-MMP9 pathway which maintains blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Additionally,
  apoE2 and apoE3 interact with LRP1 in the endothelial cells to mediate Aβ clearance
  from brain to blood. B. Astrocyte secreted apoE4 interacts weakly with LRP1 in pericytes
  (P) and endothelial cells (E) and its binding to LRP1 on vascular cells is barely
  detectable. In pericytes, this weak interaction results in increased intracellular
  CypA which activates the proinflammatory NF-κB-MMP9 pathway leading to BBB disruption
  and accumulation of neurotoxic blood-derived molecules in brain causing neuronal
  injury. In endothelial cells, the weak interaction between apoE4 and LRP1 fails
  to efficiently remove Aβ from brain contributing to Aβ accumulation and Aβ-mediated
  neuronal injury.
