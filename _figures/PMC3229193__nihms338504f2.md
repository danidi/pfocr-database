caption: Model for transcriptional–3′-end processing alternatives during the DNA damage
  response (DDR). The DNA damage-induced lesions may affect the elongating RNA polymerase
  II–cleavage stimulation factor (RNAP II–CstF) holoenzyme in different ways. The
  lesion is bypassed, generating a mutant transcript. Alternatively, RNAP II stalled
  at sites of DNA damage can reengage in a transcriptional process. In that scenario,
  the BRCA1–BARD1–CstF complex reassures the correct 3′-end processing of the nascent
  RNA. For some other lesions, RNAP II–CstF holoenzyme is stalled, causing premature
  termination or transient arrest of elongation process. BRCA1–BARD1-containing complexes
  are recruited to sites of DNA repair, resulting in RNAP II ubiquitination and inhibition
  of transcription by degradation of RNAP II. The nascent RNA product is released
  and its 3′-end processing is inhibited by both the CstF–BARD1 interaction and RNAP
  II degradation. This process facilitates repair by allowing access of the repair
  machinery to the DNA damage site, and at the same time prevents the formation of
  aberrantly processed mRNAs, which are eliminated by exosome-mediated degradation
  in a nuclear surveillance pathway.
