caption: 'Schematic representation of the CNS-immune system crosstalk. There are bi-directional
  circuits linking CNS and immune system. The CNS can communicate with the immune
  system to modulate its activity, through different ways: through the autonomic nervous
  system (via the sympathetic and vagus nerve innervation, see the text for deeper
  details), the catecholaminergic pathway, or the neuropeptides and hormones release.
  In this context, leptin modulates immune system, by increasing the activation of
  T cells and decreasing Treg cells functions, thus representing a key player in the
  susceptibility to immune-mediated disorders (β2R, β2 receptor; α7 nAChR, α7 subunit
  of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor).'
