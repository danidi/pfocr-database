caption: Relative expression of genes mediating carotenoid biosynthesis and sequestration
  in tomato and wild species. The relative transcript levels were measured from 26,
  29 and 39 dpa fruits after normalization with β-actin and ubiquitin (Table S7 shows
  means±SE (n=3) along with corresponding P-values). Dotted arrows indicate multiple
  steps in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. The genes mediating carotenoid sequestration
  are enclosed in a rectangle. The overlapping symbols are enclosed in a box. Error
  bars smaller than the symbol are masked underneath. chrc, chromoplast-specific carotenoid
