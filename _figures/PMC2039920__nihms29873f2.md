caption: The differential stimulation of the units of the receptor heteromers determines
  the predominant signalling pathway and the consequent changes in neuronal excitability
  and gene transcription, with implications for plastic changes in the glutamatergic
  synapse, such as phosphorylation and recruitment of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) to the
  postsynaptic density. Under conditions of weak glutamatergic neurotransmission,
  there is a predominant effect of D2 receptor (D2R) signalling, with decreased neuronal
  excitability and gene transcription. Under conditions of strong glutamatergic neurotransmission,
  which is associated with adenosine release, there is a potent stimulation of metabotropic
  glutamate mGlu5 receptors (mGlu5Rs) and adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs), which dampens
  D2R signalling through intramembrane receptor interactions and favors increased
  neuronal excitability and gene transcription (see text). In black and red, stimulatory
  and inhibitory effects, respectively. VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channel; MAPK,
  mitogen activated protein kinases; PKA, protein kinase A; PLC, phospholipase C;
  PP-2B, protein phosphatase 2B or calcineurin.
