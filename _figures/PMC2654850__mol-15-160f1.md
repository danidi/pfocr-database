caption: 'Here we diagram the possible role GSTM-1 enzyme plays inside the mitochondrial
  matrix as mtDNA protector factor regarding damage caused by reactive species. The
  biological systems can produce these compounds by different pathways. One of the
  most important endogenous mechanisms is the respiratory chain, generating great
  levels of ROS during the O2 reduction. Lipid peroxidation over the membrane lipoprotein,
  caused by ROS action, is another source of active compounds (HNE: 4-Hydroxynonenal,
  for example). Another important mechanism involved in ROS generation is the biotransformation
  of different exogenous compounds or xenobiotics by action of different XME. The
  ROS action into the cell could produce lesions in different mt compounds, such as
  lipids; damage different kinds of proteins, Pol-γ for example; damage the mtDNA
  directly by action of these active species on the bases, or indirectly by DNA replication
  with a faulty Pol-γ that introduces errors. Altogether, those deleterious processes
  lead to genotoxic damage, as shown in the right side of the image. The left side
  shows the possible metabolic pathway of the GSTM-1 enzyme, promoting the elimination
  of reactive species and blocking their deleterious effect over the mt component.
  It is important to note the possible protective action of GSTM-1 over the mtDNA.
  The picture shows only a schematic pathway for the GSTM-1 enzyme; the other mitochondrial
  matrix events are simplified.'
