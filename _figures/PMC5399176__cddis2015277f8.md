caption: Proposed mechanism for ion flux-dependent regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Activation of the P2X7 receptor pathway with extracellular ATP results in the exchange
  of potassium and calcium across the plasma membrane, dominantly regulated by efflux
  of potassium from the cytosol to the extracellular space. Influx of calcium causes
  a mitochondrial calcium overload resulting in mitochondrial destabilization and
  mROS generation, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through an unknown mechanism,
  but possibly by involvement of TXNIP or Syk., , , ,  P2X7 receptor activation also
  results in a mitochondrial potassium efflux that may be involved in mitochondrial
  destabilization and mROS generation. Inhibition of potassium efflux prevents calcium
  influx and downstream mROS generation. Likewise, chelation of intracellular calcium
  prevents mROS generation
