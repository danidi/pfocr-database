caption: DBH- dopamine β- hydroxylase, DDC- Dopa decarboxylase, PNMT- phenyl ethanolamine-N-methyltransferase,
  PO- phenoloxidase, TDC- tyrosine decarboxylase, TBH- tyramine beta hydroxylase,
  TPH- tryptophan hydroxylase. The green and blue squares mark the metabolic reactions
  specific for either invertebrates or vertebrates respectively. The dotted arrow
  represents a salvage pathway which might exist. Its physiological relevance is unknown.
