caption: A section from a pathway that describes the biosynthesis of Lewis-type epitopes
  by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. This pathway was drawn using a modified version
  of the GlycanBuilder software (). The modifications, introduced by the SRI International,
  allow the software to display text strings or other, non-glycan, compounds as part
  of the structure (shown as R in this example). As in non-glycan type pathways, each
  item in the diagram is a clickable hyperlink to a dedicated page for that item.
