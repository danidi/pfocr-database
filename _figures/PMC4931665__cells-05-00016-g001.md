caption: 'NF-κB signaling consists of two main branches: canonical and non-canonical.
  On the left, canonical NF-κB is driven by the IKK complex containing IKKα, β, and
  γ subunits. Phosphorylation of IκBα leads to its degradation, allowing the p65-p50
  dimer to accumulate in the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes. On
  the right, non-canonical NF-κB is driven by IKKα homodimers, leading to p100 processing.
  Here the dimer consists of the RelB and p52 subunits. Canonical and non-canonical
  NF-κB subunits regulate expression of distinct and overlapping sets of target genes
  [].'
