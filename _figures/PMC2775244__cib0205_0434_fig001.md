caption: The TGN is a meeting point where conventional and unconventional routes of
  intracellular transport merge. To illustrate this point, the classical biosynthetic
  pathway from the ER to the cell surface is depicted with green arrows. Alternative
  transport routes by which various large cargos such as HSV-1, chylomicrons, procollagen
  and some viruses that assemble in the cytoplasm reach the TGN are indicated by red
  arrows. In addition, the TGN is not only a merging point for molecules newly synthesized
  but also for proteins recycled from organelles along the endo-lysosomal system (shown
  with blue arrows). At the TGN, large and small cargos merge and are sorted towards
  the cell surface (green arrows) and various endosomal compartments (yellow arrows).
  Dotted green arrows illustrate the uncertainty as to whether large cargo, in particular
  viruses, share the PKD mediated pathway with smaller cargo or whether they monopolizes
  it.
