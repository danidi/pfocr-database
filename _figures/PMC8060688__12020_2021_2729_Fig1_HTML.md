caption: In mammalian cells, SARS-CoV-2 shifts cellular metabolism from oxidative
  phosphorylation to glycolysis, which results in a decrease in ATP generation. The
  key rate-limiting enzymes in glycolysis, including PKM2 and HK2, were upregulated
  in COVID-19. The decreased PDC can lead to an uncoupling between glycolysis and
  TCA, which would induce intracellular acidosis and energy depletion. Under an anaerobic
  condition in COVID-19, the depletion of GSH from the pentose phosphate pathway’s
  blockage could cause oxidative damage by SARS-CoV-2. The new virus elevates the
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which would result in massive amounts of IRF5.
  IRF5 involves worsening pro-inflammatory pathways that ultimately lead to hyper
  inflammation, a cytokine storm, and multiorgan failure. GSH, glutathione; HK2, hexokinase
  2; IRF5, interferon regulatory factor-5; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NADPH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; PKM2, pyruvate kinase isozyme M2; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid
