caption: Proposed genetic networks of osseointegration. The osteotomy procedure used
  to prepare an implant placement site creates an ablation wound in the bone marrow.
  Intramembranous ossification occurs during the healing of bone marrow ablation without
  cartilage tissue formation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in bone marrow possess
  multipotent differentiation capability and undergo osteoblastic differentiation
  with a sufficient oxygen supply. Under hypoxic conditions, however, MSCs can develop
  chondrogenic differentiation. The puzzling expression of a mixture of osteoblastic
  and chondroblastic genes in the peri-implant tissue may be induced by the microenvironment
  derived from titanium (Ti) implant fixture. The proposed mechanisms may involve
  a thin layer of hypoxic zone due to continuous oxidization of Ti implant fixture,
  affecting the differentiation course of MSCs. It is also possible that MSCs may
  recognize implant fixture as a foreign material and activate xenobiotic responses.
  Either a hypoxic or xenobiotic microenvironment may commonly stimulate PAS domain-containing
  molecular sensors. ARNTL (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like) is
  such a PAS sensor for hypoxic or xenobiotic cell response. ARNTL has been found
  to dimerize with hypoxia-inducible factors and thus potentially activates the hypoxia-inducible
  factor/ARNTL pathway for chondrogenic differentiation, at least in a transient phase.
  Separately, ARNTL is also an essential circadian rhythm molecule. ARNTL dimerizes
  with NPAS2 or CLOCK and regulates the transcription of Per and Cry molecular clock
  proteins. Therefore, the implant fixture-mediated microenvironment may have a significant
  effect on the peripheral circadian rhythm. Furthermore, NPAS2, one of the most affected
  genes by the implant placement and vitamin D deficiency, was found to directly upregulate
  Col2 and Col10 in mouse MSCs (). It may be suggested that an alternative pathway
  may regulate the expression of a selected set of cartilage ECM molecules without
  full chondrogenic differentiation. Small but critical synthesis of proteoglycans
  has been postulated to facilitate the adhesion of bone tissue to implant surface.
  In addition, although highly speculative, the peri-implant bone may contain a mixture
  of bone and cartilage ECM. Type X collagen may increase the tensile strength of
  interface tissues such as peri-implant bone. In addition, a study on Col9 knockout
  bone showed significantly increased susceptibility to osteoclastic bone resorption
  (). The long-term resistance of peri-implant bone against catabolic remodeling might
  be contributed, in part, by its unique ECM composition.
