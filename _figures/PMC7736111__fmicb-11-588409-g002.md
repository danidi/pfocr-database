caption: Molecular and signaling pathway implicated in host cell antiviral response.
  (A) After the viral contents are released into the cytoplasm, the viral RNA is recognized
  by host cell NASs like RIG-I and MDA5. Counter-defense may be provided by the viral
  proteins, NSP14 and NSP16 to shield the viral RNA from sensing by the NASs. However,
  if successfully recognized, RIG-I and MDA5 get activated and subsequently activate
  the centrally placed MAVS located on mitochondria. MAVS acts as a molecular adaptor
  that further recruits TRAF2/3/5/6. Association of the type of TRAF with MAVS is
  suggested to determine the type of downstream signaling, i.e., IRF3/7 and/or NF-κB.
  At the MAVS junction, the association of TRAF5/6 with TRADD, FADD, and RIPK1 activates
  NF-κB. Whereas, binding of MAVS with STING activates TBK1 and IKKε by interacting
  with TRAF2/3, which eventually results in the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 (). Activated
  IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB translocate to the nucleus and induce the expression of IFN
  genes. (B) The transcribed IFNs act on the respective IFN receptors (IFNRs) present
  on the host cells as well as on other innate immune cells, thus signaling in a both
  autocrine and paracrine manner. Signaling via IFNRs activates the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway and subsequently induces the expression of ISGs. These molecular events
  were recently reviewed (). ISGs transcribed will eventually inhibit viral propagation.
  However, SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 have developed counter-defense mechanisms
  to interfere at various steps in the NAS signaling pathway. NSP4a inhibits TRIM25,
  which is required for RIG-I activation. N protein inhibits MDA5, NSP14 inhibits
  MAVS, ORF9b inhibits RIG-I/MDA5 activation complex, M protein interferes with TANK,
  IKKε, and TBK1 signaling, and PLpro inhibits various RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVs downstream
  signaling steps. SARS-CoV-2 proteins acting at various steps in blocking NAS and
  IFN signaling are shown in the red box. NAS, Nucleic acid sensors; RIG-I, Retinoic
