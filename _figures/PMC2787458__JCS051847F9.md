caption: 'Wnt3a stimulates Src docking to, activation by, and phosphorylation of  Dvl2.
  In this working model, at resting state (in the absence of Wnt  stimulation), Src
  family TKs are in an autoinhibitory `inactive'' confirmation.  For Src family kinases,
  two intramolecular interactions tightly regulate  enzymatic activity: an interaction
  between the SH2 domain and the C-terminal  tail and an interaction between the SH3
  domain and a polyproline type II helix  in the SH2-kinase linker region. Wnt3a stimulation
  of Frizzled-1 and LRP5/6  activates the `canonical'' pathway in which multi-protein
  complexes that  include Dvl2 docking via PDZ ligand and PDZ-binding domains. Our
  results  indicate that the SH3 domain of Src family kinase binds to Dvl2 SH3-binding  domain
  (residues 370-376) as well as to a larger, proline-rich C-terminal  domain (511-736;
  proline-rich binding domain, PRO-RD) of Dvl2, or  both. Through docking to Dvl2,
  autoinhibitory conformation of Src is released,  disrupted by the SH3 domain and
  a polyproline type II helix in the SH2-kinase  linker region. Wnt3a not only induces
  the docking of Src to Dvl2, but also  release of Src from autoinhibition (i.e. activation),
  as well as Src-catalyzed  phosphorylation of Src substrates (including Dvl2 in the
  DIX, PDZ and DEP  domains) found in the Dvl2-based multiprotein complexes. Thus,
  Src is a  positive regulator of Wnt canonical signaling, which acts by docking to
  and  being activated by Dvl2 in response to Wnt stimulation. Red circles represent  tyrosine
  phosphorylation sites. The schematic of the multiprotein complexes  has been simplified.
  Axin, GSK3β, APC and many other components of the  multiprotein complexes are not
  identified individually in this schematic.'
