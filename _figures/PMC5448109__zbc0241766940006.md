caption: Simplified models of ribonucleotide excision repair in Eukarya (A), Archaea
  (B), and Bacteria (C). A, rNMPs are incorporated into eukaryotic genomic DNA by
  any of the replicative polymerases (Polϵ, Polδ, or Polα) with the incorporation
  frequencies shown (, , ). The RER pathway begins with incision by the heterotrimeric
  RNaseH2 followed by strand displacement synthesis by either of the replicative polymerases
  Polϵ or Polδ, flap cleavage by Fen1 or Exo1, and sealing by DNA ligase I. B, archaeal
  genomic DNA acquires rNMPs primarily through incorporation by the leading and lagging
  strand polymerase PolD at a rate of 1 rN in 1,500 nucleotides synthesized. Monomeric
  RNaseH2 nicks DNA at rNMP sites. Following cleavage, strand displacement synthesis
  by PolB creates a flap that is cleaved by Fen1 and DNA ligase seals the resulting
  nick. C, in bacteria, the replicative polymerase PolIII incorporates rNMPs in genomic
  DNA and monomeric RNaseHII nicks at these sites. PolI then fulfills two functions
  in RER by performing both strand displacement synthesis and flap cleavage. DNA ligase
  then seals the nick.
