caption: Following cholestatic liver injury, TLR2+ monocytes of the intestinal lamina
  propria are activated and produce TNFα. TNFα binds to TNFRI on enterocytes to activate
  the RhoA/MLC pathway resulting in disruption of tight junctions. Bacteria and bacterial
  products such as LPS cross the mucosal barrier to reach the liver via the portal
  circulation. LPS binds to TLR4 on hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and causes liver
  fibrosis.
