caption: A proposed model for HA-CD44-mediated PKCϵ activation and Nanog signaling
  in the regulation of miRNA-21 production, oncogenesis, and chemoresistance in breast
  tumor cells. The binding of HA to CD44 (step 1) promotes PKCϵ activity (step 2),
  which, in turn, causes phosphorylation of Nanog (step 3). Phosphorylated Nanog then
  translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus and interacts with the microprocessor
  complex containing the RNase III (DROSHA) and the RNA helicase (p68) (step 4), resulting
  in miR-21 production (step 5). The resultant miR-21 then functions to down-regulate
  the tumor suppressor protein (PDCD4) (step 6a; indicated by the arrow with solid
  lines) and promotes oncogenesis (step 7a; indicated by the arrow with solid lines),
  leading to IAP (survivin and XIAP)/MDR1 (P-gp) expression, breast tumor cell anti-apoptosis/survival,
  and chemoresistance (step 8a; indicated by the arrow with solid lines). In direct
  contrast, treatment of breast tumor cells with an anti-miR-21 inhibitor (indicated
  by the arrow with dashed lines) induces tumor suppressor protein (PDCD4) up-regulation
  and PDCD4-eIF4A complex formation, which then inhibits translational machinery (step
  6b; indicated by the arrow with dashed lines). Subsequently, these changes result
  in the inhibition of IAP (survivin and XIAP) and MDR1 expression (step 7b; indicated
  by the arrow with dashed lines), stimulation of apoptosis/cell death, and enhancement
  of chemosensitivity (step 8b; indicated by the arrow with dashed lines) in breast
  tumor cells. This newly discovered PKCϵ-Nanog signaling pathway leading to miR-21
  functioning should provide important drug targets for sensitizing tumor cell apoptosis
  and overcoming chemoresistance in HA-CD44-activated breast cancer cells.
