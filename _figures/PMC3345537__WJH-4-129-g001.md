caption: 'The glucose-6-phosphate transporter - hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase -
  11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 triad. Local glucocorticoid activation is
  catalyzed by a triad of the endoplasmic reticulum, composed by glucose-6-phosphate-transporter,
  hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. The
  role of their cooperation is the enhancement of local glucocorticoid effect. PPP:
  pentose phosphate pathway; G6PT: Glucose-6-phosphate transporter; H6PDH: Hexose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; 11βHSD1: 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1; NADP: Nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ER: Endoplasmic reticulum.'
