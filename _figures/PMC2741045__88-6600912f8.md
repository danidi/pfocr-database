caption: Schematic diagram of how integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and glycogen synthase
  kinase-3β (GSK-3β) might be involved in the acute radiation response with regard
  to cell survival, cell cycle progression and initiation of G2 phase arrest. Binding
  of cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) components via β1-integrins stimulates ILK
  and downstream targets protein kinase Bα/Akt (PKBα/Akt) (phosphorylation at amino-acid
  residues Ser473 and Thr308) and GSK-3β (phosphorylation at amino-acid residue Ser9).
  These events suppress apoptosis and promote survival by inhibiting Bad and caspase-9
  and cell cycle transition by blocking proteolysis of cyclin D1. Facilitating growth
  factor binding to growth factor receptors (GFR) activates similar pathways downstream
  of the central regulator phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K). In bold letters,
  arrows and circles, we suggest and thereby support the hypothesis of direct ILK
  phosphorylation of GSK-3β when PI3-K is inhibited and cells are attached to ECM.
  Irradiation (IR) is able to activate this pathway, which then does not stimulate
  proliferation but rather blocks cells in the G2 phase possibly allowing damage repair.
