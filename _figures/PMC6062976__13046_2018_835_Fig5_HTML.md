caption: Function of CD44 in promoting resistance to oxidative stress with metabolic
  reprogramming. Alternative splicing of the CD44 gene results in the generation of
  multiple protein isoforms. CD44 standard isoform (CD44s) binds to PKM2, thereby
  promoting aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells (Warburg effect) and the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). The PPP provides enough NADPH to convert oxidative form of glutathione
  (GSSG) to reduced form of glutathione (GSH) [, ]. On the other hand, CD44 variant
  isoform (CD44v) is overexpressed in epithelial cancer stem cells (CSCs), and its
  colocalization with the xCT subunit of system Xc(–), a glutamate/cystine antiporter,
  promotes the uptake of cystine and the consequent synthesis of the antioxidant GSH,
  which reduces the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [, , ]. The red region
  of CD44v indicates the variable exons 8-10 which are inserted by ESRP1-induced alternative
  splicing
