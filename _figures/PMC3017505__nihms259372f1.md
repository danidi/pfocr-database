caption: In the ‘classic’ pathway, pheromone binding to a cognate seven-transmembrane
  receptor leads to the activation of the Gα subunit of a receptor-coupled heterotrimeric
  G-protein. Active Gα releases Gβγ, which then binds to both the Ste20 protein kinase
  (PAK) and the Ste5 scaffold protein. Ste5 tugs Ste11 (MEKK), the first domino in
  the MAP kinase cascade, to the membrane, where it is phosphorylated and thereby
  activated by Ste20PAK. The new work by Slessareva et al. [] provides evidence for
  the existence of a new branch of the pathway (surrounded by dotted frame) that modulates
  the efficiency of signaling through the classic branch. In the new branch, active
  Gα is proposed to move to the endosome, where it binds PI 3-kinase (Vps34) and to
  an associated protein kinase (Vps15) and stimulates the production of PI 3-phosphate
  at the endosome. The figure shows the PI 3-phosphate recruiting an unknown phospholipid-binding
  protein (represented by ?), perhaps Bem1, which reconnects to the classic pathway
  at an unknown point upstream of MAP kinase activation.
