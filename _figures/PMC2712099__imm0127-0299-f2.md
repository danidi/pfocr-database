caption: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signalling pathway. Hydrophobic ligands
  enter the cell via diffusion through the cell membrane. Ligands bind to the AHR
  in the cytosol. Ligand binding causes conformational changes leading to nuclear
  localization sequence (NLS) exposure and the AHR complex translocates to the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, the AHR binds its heterodimeric partner, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
  nuclear translocator (ARNT) and directs transcription from dioxin response elements
  (DREs), upstream of target genes. Signalling through the AHR is down-regulated by
  two means, the proteasome and a feed-back pathway involving the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor repressor (AHRR). The AHRR is an AHR gene target and its expression is
  up-regulated by AHR signalling. Signalling by the AHR leads to three biological
  pathways referred to as the adaptive metabolic pathway, the toxic pathway, and the
  developmental pathway. ARA9, aryl hydrocarbon receptor associated 9; Hsp90, heat
  shock protein 90.
