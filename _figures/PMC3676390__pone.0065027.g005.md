caption: Integrated pathway map shows the role of MeJA-induced genes involved in GA
  biosynthesis, primary metabolism, signaling regulation and transcriptional regulation.
  Dashed lines indicate the probable pathway involved in GA biosynthesis. Solid lines
  indicate the result supported by cDNA-AFLP and real time PCR. The ESTs from cDNA-AFLP
  results are indicated in stars.
