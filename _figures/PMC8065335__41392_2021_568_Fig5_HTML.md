caption: The putative mechanisms for CVL218 as a PARP1 inhibitor to combat the COVID-19
  disease, derived based on the data present in this study and the known antiviral
  activities of PARP1 inhibitors previously reported in the literature. a Schematic
  diagram showing the possible antiviral mechanisms of PARP1 inhibitors in the life
  cycle of coronavirus in human cells. PARP1 inhibitors have been previously reported
  in the literature to suppress viral replication and imped the binding of nucleocapsid
  protein to viral RNAs, thus preventing the virus infection.–b Potential protective
  effects of PARP1 inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19. The anti-inflammation
  effects of PARP1 inhibitors may be achieved through two possible molecular pathways.
  The first one is to modulate the expression of pro-inflammation factors such as
  NF-κB, AP-1, IL-6 and downstream cytokines and chemokines.– The second possible
  pathway is to prevent the overactivation of PARP1 and thus avoid the depletion of
  NAD+ and ATP, and the consequent cellular energy failure and cell death caused by
  necrosis.–c The potential antiviral effects of PARP1 inhibitors through suppressing
  the ADP-ribosylation of viral proteins and intervening the host-pathogen interactions,
  thus resulting in the inhibition of viral replication,,,
