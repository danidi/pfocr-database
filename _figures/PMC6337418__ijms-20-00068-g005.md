caption: The stress signal path model of WRKY participation. (a) MYC2 is a major positive
  regulator of JA gene expression and is capable of binding to the G-box region upstream
  of the JA gene to increase gene expression levels. JAZ can suppress the combination
  of MYC2 and G-box area, and salt tolerance zinc finger (STZ) is involved in the
  early signaling response of JA and regulates the expression of the JA synthetic
  gene LOX3. (b) The JA/ABA signaling pathway regulates the second messenger cAPPR
  and cGMP to close stomata. (c) The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade,
  MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3)-MAPK 6 (MPK6), is activated by JA in Arabidopsis and is capable
  of inducing downstream wounding stress response genes. (d) MPK6 activation by MEKK1
  is mediated by MKK2. MKK2–MPK6 cascades mediate cold and salt stress tolerance in
  plants. (e) WRKY70 can inhibit the expression of the JA gene and activate the SA
  signaling pathway to induce more WRKY transcription factors to inhibit JA. (f) WRKY25,
  WRKY26, and WRKY33 transcription factors interact to regulate cooperation between
  ethylene-activated protein- and heat shock protein-related signaling pathways. (g)
  ACS6 is a synthetic precursor of ethylene, and WRKY33 binds directly to the promoters
  of ACS2 and ACS6 to promote gene expression. (h) ERF can be activated by ethylene
  and act on PDF (plant defensin) to activate downstream pathogen response genes,
  which can also be regulated by JA. (i) When the receptor receives signals of cold
  or osmotic stress, it will stimulate the MAPK signal pathway and thus improve plant
  resistance.
