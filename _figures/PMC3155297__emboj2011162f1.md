caption: General and organelle-specific stress response pathways influenced by the
  ageing process. Depending on the type of macromolecule and the site of damage, distinct
  stress response pathways, such as autophagy, heat shock response, UPRmt, UPRER,
  remodelled proteasome and the DNA damage response are initiated. Ageing broadly
  affects stress response pathways in multiple steps. For simplicity, only proteins
  with functions modulated by ageing are depicted. Double arrows denote bi-directional
  communication with the nucleus, which involves generation of stress signals in the
  stressed organelle or the cytoplasm, transduction of the signals to the nucleus
  and upregulation of stress-relieving proteins, which in turn function to ameliorate
  damage. Question marks denote lack of information about specific molecules mediating
  the effects of ageing. Although, a typical Golgi stress response pathway has not
  been described yet, several types of stress and also ageing may influence gene expression
  in the nucleus and cell homeostasis by impinging on Golgi function. BER, base-excision
  repair; BiP, Ig-binding protein; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; CMA, chaperone-mediated
  autophagy; DAF-16, abnormal dauer formation 16; DVE-1, defective proventriculus
  1; GRP94, glucose-regulated protein 94; HSF1, heat shock factor 1; HSP, heat shock
  protein; HR, homologous recombination; IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1; LAMP-2A,
  lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A; NER, nucleotide-excision repair; NHEJ,
  non-homologous end joining; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase; UPRER/mt, unfolded protein
  response endoplasmic reticulum/mitochondrion; XBP-1, X-box-binding protein 1.
