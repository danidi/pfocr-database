caption: Main reactions involved in the utilization of nitrogen sources in the yeast
  S. cerevisiae. The nitrogenous compounds indicated in gray boxes are the 27 nitrogen
  sources utilizable by the yeast S. cerevisiae. Those tested in this study are indicated
  in bold. Thick gray arrows represent the catabolic pathways leading to either ammonium
  or glutamate, and narrower arrows point to carbonaceous products resulting from
  these catabolic pathways. Among these compounds, those which cannot be metabolized
  by the cell are circled. The enzymatic reactions involved in the central pathway
  of nitrogen metabolism and associating ammonium, glutamate, and glutamine are also
  indicated and correspond to the anabolic NADPH glutamate dehydrogenase Gdh1 (1),
  the catabolic NAD+ glutamate dehydrogenase Gdh2 (2), the glutamine synthetase Gln1
  (3), and the glutamate synthase Glt1 (4). TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; CoA,
  coenzyme A.
