caption: Differential response of normal and tumor cells to metabolic stress. Normal
  cells regulate cell growth in response to nutrient availability by modulating the
  activity of the PI 3-kinase pathway, which through mTOR promotes cell growth and
  downregulates the catabolic process of autophagy. In periods of starvation, normal
  cells downregulate mTOR, which slows cell growth, while upregulating autophagy to
  allow adaptation to metabolic stress. In contrast, tumor cells frequently acquire
  mutations that constitutively activate the PI 3-kinase pathway that efficiently
  promotes cell growth in the presence of nutrients. In starvation conditions, however,
  tumor cells inefficiently adapt to metabolic stress through the failure to downregulate
  cell growth and upregulate autophagy, which can result in apoptotic or necrotic
  cell death though metabolic catastrophe.
