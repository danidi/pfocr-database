caption: The small GTPase Rab27a recruits the effector JFC1 to secretory organelles.
  JFC1 interacts with the RhoA-GAP GMIP through its C2B domain [], but whether this
  interaction is sufficient to recruit GMIP to secretory organelles is still obscure.
  RhoA localizes at azurophilic granules, and GMIP down-regulation induces RhoA activation
  and increases actin polymerization []. Down-regulation of GMIP or JFC1 increases
  granule entrapment in cortical actin and decreases exocytosis, while inhibition
  of the RhoA-downstream signaling pathway has the opposite effect []. In the absence
  of Rab27, JFC1, or GMIP, secretion is impaired.
