caption: 'The transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) ligands are synthesized as a large
  latent TGFβ complex consisting of mature dimeric TGFβ associated with its latency-associated
  peptide (LAP) and a latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP) (not shown). Upon activation,
  TGFβ dimers induce heteromeric complex formation between specific type II and type
  I receptors (such as TGFβ receptortype II (TpRII) andTpRI, respectively). Type II
  receptors then transphosphorylate the type I receptors, which propagate the signal
  into the cell by phosphorylating TGFβ receptor-specific SMADs (R-SMADs: SMAD2 and
  SMAD3). They form heteromeric complexes with the common mediator SMAD (co-SMAD:
  SMAD4) and translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the R-SMAD-co-SMAD complex
  preferentially associates with the genomic SMAD-binding element (SBE) in a sequence-specific
  manner. However, high-affinity binding of the R-SMAD-co-SMAD complex with the SBE
  generally occurs in concert with other DNA-binding transcription factors that bind
  to distinct sequences adjacent to the SBE. The nuclear proteins SKI and SNO (also
  known as SKIL) antagonize the transcriptional regulation by SMADs. An inhibitory
  SMAD (I-SMAD), SMAD7, inhibits the TGFβ pathway through multiple mechanisms, including
  by mediating the degradation of the type I receptor, inhibiting phosphorylation
  of R-SMADs by the type I receptor kinase or inhibiting the formation of the R-SMAD–co-SMAD
  complex. In addition to regulating transcription, R-SMADs can modulate microRNA
  (miRNA) biogenesis by facilitating the processing of primary miRNA into precursor
  miRNA in the nucleus. The co-SMAD is not required for the regulation of miRNA biosynthesis
  by R-SMADs. ‘mG’ and ‘AAAAA’ represent 5′ capping and 3′ polyadenylation of mRNAs,
  respectively.'
