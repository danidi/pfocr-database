caption: Balance between life span and growth is maintained by the activities of the
  TOR and insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways. Arrows represent molecular interactions
  based on studies in various model organisms. Growth is slowed by increased activity
  of proteins shown in yellow and by decreased activity of proteins shown in blue.
  PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate;
  PKB, protein kinase B; PKD1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1.
