caption: 'Schematic diagram linking central carbon metabolism (CCM) and lipid metabolism
  in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). (A) Catabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids
  (dark blue and black arrows) produces a variety of substrates, including succinyl-coenzyme
  A (CoA), propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, which are channeled into CCM. While acetyl-CoA
  enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle (gold arrows), succinyl-CoA and
  propionyl-CoA enter the methylmalonyl cycle (dark purple arrows) and methylcitrate
  cycle (green arrows), respectively. Dashed (- -) dark blue arrow indicates catabolism
  of odd-chain fatty acids while solid dark blue arrow indicates catabolism of even-chain
  fatty acids. Fatty acids further serve as building blocks for other lipids, including
  triglycerides, which are involved in dormancy, while methylmalonyl-CoA serves as
  precursors of more complex Mtb lipids, including sulfolipids, acylated trehalose
  (light purple arrows). (B) Mtb is able to adapt to varying conditions through the
  diversity of its central carbon metabolism pathways, including the pentose phosphate
  pathway (dark green arrow), and variations in the TCA cycle. When under favorable
  conditions, carbon will flow through the classic TCA cycle (gold arrows), favoring
  the biosynthesis of precursors and generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During
  infection when the bacterium is exposed to various stress conditions, carbon intermediates
  can also go through the reductive branch of the TCA cycle (orange arrows) or glyoxylate
  shunt (red arrows) in Mtb. These pathways are important for the regeneration of
  metabolites such as succinate, which is essential for instance in adaptation to
  hypoxia. During growth, intermediates of the TCA cycle must be withdrawn for the
  biosynthesis of fatty acids, nucleotide bases and amino acids through gluconeogenesis.
  These intermediates are replenished to achieve steady levels for normal TCA function
  by anaplerosis. The anaplerotic node is the metabolic link between glycolysis, gluconeogenesis
  (dark red arrows) and the TCA cycle (gold arrows) and acts as a switch that directs
  the flow of carbon distribution within the CCM. An example of anaplerosis is during
  growth on fatty acids, when the glyoxylate shunt (red arrows) serves to replenish
  malate via isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. Glucose further serves as a precursor
  for trehalose (grey arrow), which is a building block of glycolipids. Abbreviations:
  SL-1 = sulfolipid-1; FA = fatty acid; TCA = tricarboxylic acid cycle, CoA = coenzyme
  A; CO2 = carbon dioxide; DAT = diacyl trehalose; PAT = poly-acyl trehalose; PDIM
  = phthiocerol dimycocerosate; TMM = trehalose monomycolate; TDM = trehalose dimycolate.
  Note: the schematic is a simplified form and do not represent all steps of the biosynthesis
  and catabolic pathways of the various metabolites.'
