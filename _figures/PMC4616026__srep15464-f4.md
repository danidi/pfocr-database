caption: (a) The network formed by differentially expressed miRNAs in CXCR6-negative
  cells before the overshoot (3 days after sorting) and pathways identified to be
  significantly targeted by those miRNAs. (b) The same network as in a) restricted
  to Wnt and PI3K signalling pathways. (c) The network formed by differentially expressed
  miRNAs in CXCR6-negative cells at the overshoot (10 days after sorting) and pathways
  identified to be significantly targeted by those miRNAs. (d) The same network as
  in (c) restricted to Wnt and PI3K signalling pathways. For all panels the miRNAs
  are shown in red when they increase and in blue when they decrease; the arrows are
  red when they induce an increase of the targeted pathway and in blue when they induce
  a decrease.
