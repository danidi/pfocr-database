caption: Glutamate can be converted by one of two different pathways into α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG), and the choice of which pathway is influenced both by oncogene input and
  cell proliferation and metabolic state. GLS, kidney-type glutaminase; GLS2, liver-type
  glutaminase; GLUD, glutamate dehydrogenase; ISR, integrated stress response; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
