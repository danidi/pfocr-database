caption: (A) Mammalian Set1/COMPASS is recruited to chromatin of transcriptionally
  active genes through interaction with the Paf1 Complex (1) (), where it is only
  capable of implementing H3K4 monomethylation. Upon H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub)
  by Rad6/Bre1 (2), WDR82 (Cps35 in yeast) interacts with chromatin and associates
  with COMPASS (3), enabling the complex to trimethylate H3K4 (4), whose presence
  at promoters is a mark of actively transcribed genes (see ). (B) MLL is part of
  a COMPASS-like complex that shares many subunits, but importantly lacks WDR82, and
  therefore, its methyltransferase activity is likely to be independent of H2Bub.
  MLL, like its Drosophila homolog Trithorax, is well known for its role in activating
  Hox genes. Recruitment of MLL via Menin and sequence-specific binding factors could
  help activate transcription of its target loci by mediating trimethylation of H3K4
  (1) which can form a binding site for TAF3, a component of TFIID in the pre-initiation
  complexes (PIC) (2), thereby, mediating recruitment or stabilization and the basal
  machinery (PIC) and RNA Pol II (3) (; ). Thus, H3K4 trimethylation implemented by
  the MLL complexes is instructive for transcription (), while H3K4 trimethylation
  implemented by Set1/COMPASS may be recruited subsequent to initiation of transcription
  by PIC and RNA Pol II through the H2Bub-WDR82 pathway (; ).
