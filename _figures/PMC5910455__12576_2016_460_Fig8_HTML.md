caption: Proposed schema on inhibitory effects of nicotine on LPS-induced microglial
  activation. LPS, glycolipids found in the outer membrane of some types of Gram-negative
  bacteria, bind to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and activate signaling pathways; extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), AP1,
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), or IRFs (IRF3/IRF7), and hence production and release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) via inducible NO synthase and tumor
  necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). LPS also upregulates NADPH oxidase (NOX) assembly. The
  voltage-gated H+ channel, HVCN1, enables NOX function by compensating cellular loss
  of electrons with protons, which are required for phagocytosis. Furthermore, HVCN1
  was required for NOX-dependent ROS generation. Nicotine binds to α7 nAChR in microglia,
  causing transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ in phospholipase C (PLC)/inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent manner [], negatively modulates LPS-induced
  release of TNF-α. Cholinergic protection via α7 nAChR and PI3K-Akt pathway in LPS-induced
  neuroinflammation is also reported []. Nicotine may inhibit LPS-induced NOX. On
  the other hand, nicotine inhibits H+ current without affecting LPS-increased expression
  of HVCN1. Presumably, α7 nAChR signaling inhibits function of HVCN1 either directly
  or by inhibiting NOX, hence attenuating ROS production and further stimulation of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, NO and TNF-α
