caption: Aβ protein inhibited cell proliferation and activated apoptosis of RPE cells
  via the RAGE/NF-κB signaling pathway. Aβ protein could down-regulate the mRNA expression
  of CCNE to hinder the cell cycle, and activate CASP3 to enhance the apoptosis by
  the decrease of the RAGE/NF-κB activities.
