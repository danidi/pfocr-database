caption: Viral entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and RAS impairment. Angiotensinogen is
  cleaved into angiotensin I by renin, and then into angiotensin II by ACE-1. Then,
  Angiotensin II binds angiotensin receptor type I (AT1R) and modulates the gene expression
  of several inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB signaling, inducing deleterious effects
  (i.e., inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, vasoconstriction, and tissue damage).
  In normal conditions with a balanced RAS, both ACE-1 and ACE-2 are activated. Therefore,
  ACE-2 counteracts AT1R activation, inducing the cleavage of angiotensin II into
  angiotensin 1–7. Angiotensin 1–7 interact with the MAS receptor (MAS-R), promoting
  vasodilatation, and anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory processes. SARS-CoV-2 enters
  the host cell by binding with the ACE-2 receptor. The virus endocytosis causes a
  decrease of ACE-2 expression on the surface membrane that results in a down-regulation
  of the MAS-R pathway (faded image). Moreover, the accumulation of Angiotensin II
  induces an overactivation of AT1R signaling, increasing the cell damage.
