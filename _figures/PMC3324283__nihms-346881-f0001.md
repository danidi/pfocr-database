caption: Binding of the TNFα ligand to its receptor, TNFR1, leads to recruitment of
  TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD). These proteins associate with other
  cytoplasmic proteins, including RIP1, TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), and
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) to form Complex 1. Complex 1 can
  also activate NF-κB and thereby transcription of FLICE-like inhibitory protein long
  (FLIP). Several steps later, the RIP1-associated complex can functionally interact
  with RIP3 and caspase-8, forming Complex 2. With high levels of FLIP, the complex
  does not result in RIP3 signaling and cell death is averted. Without FLIP, as with
  cycloheximide (CHX) addition, caspase-8 activation predominates and apoptosis results.
  When caspase-8 is inhibited, as with zVAD addition, RIP3 kinase is activated, resulting
  in programmed necrosis, or necroptosis. Necrostatin-1 blocks the kinase activity
  of RIP1, which is necessary for both apoptotic and necrotic pathways directed by
  Complex 2. Not shown here, in a similar death receptor mediated pathway, ligand
  binding to CD95/Fas induces a conformational change in the receptor, which promotes
  the assembly of a complex with Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8.
  Similarly to the TNF pathway, FLIP can prevent caspase-8 apoptosis and cycloheximide
  addition can promote cell death.
