caption: A) KsgA associates with a SSU biogenesis intermediate and once a certain
  level of maturation has occurred and B) KsgA methylates A1518 and A1519 residues
  of 16S rRNA thus prompting its release and serving as a checkpoint (green checkmark)
  within the SSU maturation cascade (). Following methylation by KsgA two competing
  pathways facilitate an additional checkpoint in SSU maturation prior to incorporation
  into the translation cycle. C) In one pathway association of S21 exposes the anti
  Shine-Dalgarno region of 16S rRNA thus making SSUs competent for translation initiation.
  D) In another pathway, which is induced by excess RbfA, 50S subunits associate with
  immature SSUs to produce “70S-like” particles, which are then either act as a repository
  for nearly mature SSUs and would under appropriate conditions be further processed
  into mature particles.
