caption: Innate immune stimulation by LPS positively impacts T cell priming. (A) LPS
  stimulation through TLR4 causes APCs to upregulate Ag-bearing MHC class II chains
  and costimulatory molecules, both of which push T cell clonal expansion and effector
  differentiation. In addition, activated APCs secrete cytokines that enhance T cell
  survival. The link between TNF and T cell survival is not known (dashed arrow),
  while IL-6 is thought to render effector CD4 T cells resistant to suppression by
  Tregs. Since only the TRIF pathway, not MyD88, participates in upregulation of the
  costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86, this suggests LPS can use independent
  signaling pathways to drive T cell effector differentiation versus survival. In
  this context, TRIF-dependent responses may require direct contact between APCs and
  T cells while MyD88-dependent responses may not. The identity of the LPS-responsive
  cell types in vivo is unclear. (B) In order for naïve T cells to become effector
  or memory cells, they must overcome suppressive barriers that are intrinsic (GSK-3β)
  and extrinsic (Treg) to the starting population. LPS-derived signals render T cells
  resistant to suppression, allowing them to undergo full clonal expansion, effector
  differentiation, and survival. LPS-induced T cell survival is associated with their
  expression of Bcl-3 and Bcl-6.

    (A) LPS stimulation through TLR4 causes APCs to upregulate Ag-bearing MHC class

    and effector differentiation. In addition, activated APCs secrete cytokines that

    LPS can use independent signaling pathways to drive T cell effector differentiation
    versus survival. In this context, TRIF-dependent responses may require direct
