caption: Proposed model for Ca2+signaling in response to P. haemolytica-derived Lkt
  and LPS in BAMs. The LPS-LBP complex interacts with CD14, resulting in the release
  of intracellular Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. This pathway does not involve
  activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins but requires activation of protein
  tyrosine kinase (PTK), since it is inhibited by herbimycin A. Modulation of LPS-induced
  [Ca2+]i elevation in BAMs by PLC inhibition suggests the involvement of IP3-induced
  Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Lkt elevates [Ca2+]i through G-protein-coupled
  activation of Ca2+ influx via L-type channels. This G protein is coupled to PLA2
  and PLC. Arachidonic acid (AA) derived from PLA2 activation gates the Ca2+ channels.
  PLC activation by Lkt may result in AA formation through the conversion of DAG by
  DAG lipase and/or by regulation of phospholipase activity by PKC, which is activated
  by DAG.
