caption: 'Phytochemicals activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
  (Nrf2) pathway. Exposure of cells to phenolics of vegetables or coffee leads to
  cell stress, including oxidative stress via mostly unknown pathways, except for
  some involvement of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Major sources of radical
  oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative stress are the mitochondrial respiratory chain
  and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases of the NOX family.
  The nuclear factor Nrf2 is usually bound to Keap1 and the Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin
  ligase (Cul3), which is followed by transport to the proteasome for degradation.
  This process can be blocked by modification of one or more cysteine residues of
  Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) by ROS, ROS-modified fatty acids or
  cyclic nucleotides, by nitric oxide (NO), or by direct action of phytochemical electrophiles.
  The protein p62 blocks binding of Nrf2 to Keap1 and channels Keap1 to autophagic
  destruction. Several kinases, such as members of the Src family, can phosphorylate
  Nrf2 and may also interfere with routing to proteasomes. All these mechanisms prevent
  newly formed Nrf2 from being captured by Keap1, so that translocation to the nucleus
  is possible. In the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma
  (sMaf) protein, and the heterodimer interacts with the antioxidant response element
  (ARE) upstream of several hundred genes involved in cell defense mechanisms, resulting
  in enhanced transcription. The following points are not depicted in the scheme:
  AHR forms a complex with several other proteins including heat shock protein (hsp)
  90. AHR activation by selective phytochemicals not only increases intracellular
  oxidative stress but also leads to translocation of the factor to the nucleus where
  it upregulates a set of genes involved in xenobiotic defense and immunoregulation.
  Some of the intranuclear Nrf2 molecules are phosphorylated. Nrf2 gene expression
  can be modified by affecting its transcription, such as by inhibitory microRNAs;
  additionally, Keap1 gene expression can also be modified.'
