caption: Proposed model for the role of SPHK/phyto-S1P and PLDα1/PA in the ABA-mediated
  stomatal closure signaling pathway. This model depicts the known targets of PLD/PA
  in the ABA-mediated stomatal closure and other ABA regulators are not included in
  this model. ABA activates SPHKs through unknown mechanisms and ABA receptors may
  be involved. The activation of SPHKs produces phyto-S1P that activates PLDα1 to
  produce PA. PA inhibits ABI1 function but promotes NADPH oxidase to promote ABA-mediated
  stomatal closure. Meanwhile, PLDα1-produced PA stimulates SPHK activity through
  a positive loop. Arrows with solid lines indicate established links and arrows with
  dashed lines denote putative links.
