caption: 'Graphical illustration of pericytes’ recruitment and their potential targeting
  delivery.Notes: Pericytes are regressed or activated depending on the up- and downregulation
  of VEGF and PDGF-β mainly. Targeting tools of pericytes are diverse as a form of
  peptides, small chemical molecules, DNA, and antibody, exploiting overexpressed
  marker on the pericyte cellular membrane or blocking the pathway of PDGFR-β+ under
  tumor microenvironment.Abbreviations: PDGF-β, platelet-derived growth factor β;
  PDGFR-β+, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β-positive; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor.'
