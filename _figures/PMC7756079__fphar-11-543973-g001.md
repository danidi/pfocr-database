caption: 'Mitochondrial damage leads to renal inflammation and fibrosis. Mitochondrial
  transcription factor A (TFAM) is critical in the regulation of mtDNA structure,
  replication, and stability. Suppression of TFAM is a key event in renal fibrosis
  in 2 ways: 1) By leading to the leakage of mtDNA in the cytosol which activates
  the STING pathway and results in transcription of NFkB-associated cytokines and
  release of cytokines outside the cells, induces pathological inflammation in tubular
  cells and neighboring cell types i.e. macrophages. Higher release of cytokine may
  influence macrophage-to-mesenchymal transition and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  and contribute to the accumulation of mesenchymal-like cells in the extracellular
  matrix; 2) Deficiency of TFAM causes reduced oxidative phosphorylation that is involved
  in the alteration of metabolic shifts and metabolic insults, influences the reactive
  oxygen species level; cumulative effects may lead to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  program and accumulations of EMT-derived myofibroblasts in the extracellular matrix
  and contributes to renal injury and renal fibrosis.'
