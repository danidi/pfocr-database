caption: (A) Under normal conditions (for example, when IL-1β or TNF-α [represented
  by the circle and triangle] binds to its respective receptor, IL-1R or TNFR1 or
  TNFR2, or when HCMV initially binds to the target cell through glycoprotein binding
  to EGFR and cellular integrins), a signal transduction pathway is initiated converging
  on the IKK complex. This in turn results in serine phosphorylation of IκBα, leading
  to its ubiquitination and degradation, thus freeing NF-κB to translocate to the
  nucleus and transactivate high levels of proinflammatory cytokine genes such as
  IL-6, CCL5, and TNF-α. (B) Late during HCMV infection, once the US5-1 and UL112-3p
  miRNAs are produced, there will be the targeted reduction in the expression of IKKα
  and IKKβ gene products through binding of the miRNAs to the 3′ untranslated region
  of both mRNAs. For simplicity, in the figure this is represented as direct targeting
  of the IKKs. By decreasing IKKα and IKKβ expression, HCMV blocks or downregulates
  IκBα degradation. Consequently, only low levels of NF-κB can translocate to the
  nucleus, and thus, only low levels of proinflammatory cytokine genes will be transactivated.
  In addition to a reduction in the transactivation of proinflammatory genes due to
  the internal stimuli of the ongoing infection, there will also be diminished IKK
  signaling due to any external stimuli such as that provided by the addition of IL-1β
  or TNF-α to infected cells.
