caption: Gene Cluster and Proposed Pathway for Biosynthesis of Conglobatin(A) Genetic
  organization of the conglobatin gene cluster (see also ).(B) Proposed biosynthetic
  pathway for conglobatin production in S. conglobatus (see the amino acid sequence
  alignment of each functional domain in ).(C) Proposed process of 5-methyloxazole
  formation on the Cong-PKS, catalyzed by putative cyclodehydratase CongE. Phosphorylation
  of the amide backbone oxygen (mechanism 1) has been previously shown to promote
  thiazole/oxazole ring formation in microcin natural products (). CongE may instead
  activate the amide oxygen by adenyltransfer from ATP with release of pyrophosphate.
  The timing of cyclodehydration with respect to the first polyketide elongation step
  remains to be established. In alternative mechanism 2, ATP is proposed to activate
  the other keto group for ring closure.
