caption: Regulation of antioxidant and detoxifying genes by the NRF2-Keap1 pathway.
  Under normal conditions, NRF2 is continuously degraded by the KEAP1-Cul3-proteasome
  axis. When Cys residues of KEAP1 protein are modified by sulfhydryl reactive chemicals,
  conformational KEAP1 changes lead to NRF2 liberation and transcriptional activation
  of an array of ARE-bearing genes, encoding detoxifying enzymes, ROS scavenging enzymes,
  thiol molecules, and their generating enzymes.
