caption: Bacterial mRNA recognition by monocytes increases follicular T helper cell
  differentiation, enhances IgG antibody response through higher follicular T helper
  cells and higher germinal center formation for mouse, human, and porcine (not shown)
  models. In mice, TFH cell differentiation by a live vaccine comprised of Gram-negative
  bacteria or a dead counterpart vaccine supplemented with bacterial mRNA is dependent
  on TRIF signaling and downstream cytokines IFN-β and IL-1β. Both cytokines act directly
  on mouse T cells to promote full TFH differentiation. In the human model, activation
  of the MyD88-dependent TLR8 receptor on monocytes induces the expression of IL-12,
  the main cytokine promoting human TFH cell differentiation, and induces TFH differentiation
  of co-cultured activated CD4 T cells. Human IL-1β is also produced in response to
  live bacteria by a yet to be explored inflammasome pathway and has additive effects
  on TFH differentiation. Despite the different cytokine requirements for TFH cell
  differentiation, detection of bacterial viability by either mouse or human monocytes
  serves as the physiological trigger for TFH cell differentiation and subsequent
  B cell class-switching and IgG production.
