caption: The Potential Schematic Diagram of the Effects of CPE on the β Cell and Liver
  Tissue(A) The potential pathway involved in inflammation and apoptosis under CPE
  treatment in the pancreas of diabetic rats. CPE treatment may significantly downregulate
  expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-17R, which blocks NF-κB and Jak-STAT
  pathways and then contributes to reduce β cell apoptosis. (B) The potential mechanisms
  that CPE treatment improves impaired glucose and lipid metabolism. CPE treatment
  downregulates Srebf1 and Mlxipl, which decreases the synthesis of TG/TC. Meanwhile,
  CPE treatment upregulates PPARa, which enhances the lipid transport and oxidation,
  as well as promotes glycogen synthesis. All the above effects contribute to alleviate
  liver injury and decrease blood glucose. Red arrow, upregulate; blue arrow, downregulate.
