caption: Schematic diagram of proposed mechanisms of DHA-induced autophagy. DHA suppresses
  Akt activity and its downstream mTOR signaling pathway. MTOR inhibits the formation
  of phagophore, which initiates autophagy by expanding to an autophagosome. During
  the expansion from phagophore to autophagosome, cytoplasmic LC3-I is conjugated
  with phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) and is changed into LC3-II. LC3-II is recruited
  to the membrane of phagophore and autophagosome, and then autophagy is induced.
