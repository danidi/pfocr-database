caption: 'Cell types and factors regulating bone in rheumatic disease. Resorption:
  The inflamed synovium/pannus produces several inflammatory mediators that enhance
  osteoclastogenesis and inhibit osteoblast maturation in the joint, leading to the
  development and persistence of articular bone erosions. These mediators promote
  the differentiation of osteoclast precursors to mature osteoclasts, in part by the
  upregulation of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). Anti-citrullinated protein
  antibodies (ACPAs) can also promote osteoclastogenesis by binding to macrophages
  and/or osteoclast precursor cells and inducing TNF production, thus enhancing cellular
  expansion and differentiation. Formation: Bone formation occurs through the action
  of mature osteoblasts that produce organic bone matrix and orchestrate bone mineralization.
  These derive from mesenchymal precursors, whose differentiation is inhibited by
  antagonists of the Wnt signaling pathway, including Dickkopf (DKK) and secreted
  frizzled-related protein (SFRP) family members, and sclerostin, derived from osteocytes
  embedded in bone matrix. Inflammatory mediators also induce the production of RANKL,
  and inhibit the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG) by stromal cells/ osteoblasts.
  Furthermore, microRNAs can regulate these processes at several levels'
