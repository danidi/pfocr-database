caption: The E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1p contains binding sites for proteins containing
  Type 1 (Arg, His, and Lys) and Type 2 (Ile, Leu, Phe, Trp, and Tyr) N-terminal amino
  acids. In the absence of di/tripeptides, the PTR2 repressor Cup9p is abundant and
  PTR2 expression is minimal. Upon binding of Type 1 and/or Type 2 di/tripeptides
  to Ubr1p, an autoinhibitory domain blocking the recognition of an internal Cup9p
  degron dissociates from the Cup9p binding site, decreasing the half-life of Cup9p
  (t ½) from approximately 5 min to less than 1 min. Consequently, PTR2 repression
  is relieved and elevated levels of Ptr2p enhance di/tripeptide uptake, initiating
  a positive feedback loop. This figure was adapted from the diagram of Turner et
  al. [], with the authors' permission.
