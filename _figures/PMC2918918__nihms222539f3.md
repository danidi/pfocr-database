caption: Overexpression and activation of glucose-6-phospahte dehydrogenase (G6PD)
  in adipocytes and liver of obese rats and mice enhances signaling in several pathways
  that presumably feedback to stimulate food intake (solid arrows) and induce hyperinsulinemia
  and hyperglycemia. The increased insulin and glucose levels putatively activate
  G6PD, thereby increasing food intake via the aforementioned feedback loop (broken
  arrows).
