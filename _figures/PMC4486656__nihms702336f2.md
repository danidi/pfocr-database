caption: Glycolysis and the TCA cycle are two separate yet connected biochemical pathways
  that function to generate ATP as well as metabolic precursors for biosynthesis.
  Glucose is broken down to pyruvate by glycolysis (orange); pyruvate can be further
  oxidized by the TCA cycle in the mitochondrion. Glycolytic intermediates can be
  used to generate other metabolites required for growth and proliferation. Glucose
  6-phosphate and 3PG produced from glycolysis are metabolized in the PPP (green)
  and the SBP (blue), respectively, providing important precursors for nucleotide
  biosynthesis. Similarly, acetyl-CoA, generated from glucose-derived citrate in the
  TCA cycle, can be used for lipid biosynthesis. OAA, produced as part of the TCA
  cycle, can be used to generate aspartate, another precursor for nucleotide synthesis.
  An alternate source of carbon for the TCA cycle occurs via glutaminolysis (purple);
  in this pathway, glutamine is converted to glutamate and then to α-KG, which joins
  the TCA cycle. Glutamine is also a precursor for amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis.
  Key enzymes in these pathways are PHGDH; PKM2; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase; PDH;
  GLS, glutaminase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; and FH.
