caption: Pathway studio network analysis of PLA2R1 and PLA2R1 promoter methylation
  in breast cancer []. The created biological network demonstrated that PLA2R1 was
  involved in several vital biological processes of breast cancer, which included
  triggering DNA damage, carcinogenesis, cell death and cell differentiation.
