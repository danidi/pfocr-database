caption: A model for TORC2 regulation of autophagy and the GAAC response. TORC2 and
  Ypk1 promote autophagy upon amino acid starvation in a pathway distinct from TORC1.
  Specifically, TORC2 and Ypk1 promote amino acid starvation-induced autophagy by
  negatively regulating Calmodulin (CaM)/Calcineurin, whose activity inhibits the
  GAAC response (Gcn2-Gcn4). Dashed line depicts potential autophagy-mediated degradation
  of Ypk1 protein upon nutrient limitation (see  for details).
