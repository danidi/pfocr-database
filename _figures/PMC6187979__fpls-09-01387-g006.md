caption: Overview of MAPKs regulated by ABA in different plant species. A single ABA-activated
  MAPK cascade MAPKKK17/18-MKK3-MPK1/2/7/14 has been identified in Arabidopsis. This
  pathway is involved in drought resistance, senescence, stomatal development and
  signaling. In addition, MKK3 in both maize and cotton has been shown to function
  in response to ABA. In maize, MKK3 acts downstream of MEKK1 and transcripts for
  both kinases are upregulated on ABA treatment. In cotton, ABA and drought induce
  activation of a MAPK cascade composed of MKK3, MPK7 and PIP1. These two pathways,
  MEKK1–MKK3 in maize and MKK3–MPK7–PIP1 in cotton, are associated with drought resistance
  and stomatal signaling. Another module in cotton, MAPKKK49-MKK4/MKK5, is involved
  in the ABA-mediated response to abiotic stress. MPK17 is another well-characterized
  MAPK in cotton, which regulates the response to salt and osmotic stresses. ABA-inducible
  genes encoding cotton MAPK cascade components presented in the scheme are MKK3,
  MAP3K49 and MPK17, respectively. Some MAPK cascades have a similar function in different
  plant species. In Arabidopsis and apple, the MKK1-MPK6 module affects seed germination
  and early seedling growth. ABA treatment induces transcription of the genes encoding
  MKK1 and MPK6 in both plant species. In Arabidopsis, MKK1 mediates activation of
  MPK6, thereby regulating CATALASE1 expression in ROS homeostasis. Additionally,
  glucose treatment significantly increases MKK1 and MPK6 activities. In apple, ABA-responsive
  transcription factor ABI5 may act as a downstream target of this MAPK cascade. MPK5
  and MPK3 in maize and MPK1 and MPK5 in rice are required for ABA-induced antioxidant
  defense and play a similar role to Arabidopsis MPK6. In maize, ABA treatment significantly
  increases MPK5 and MPK3 activities. In rice, ABA treatment induces MPK1 and MPK5
  expression.
