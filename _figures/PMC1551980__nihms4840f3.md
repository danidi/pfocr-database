caption: Stimulation of IL-1R or TLR leads to the recruitment of MyD88, IRAK and TRAF6
  to the receptor complex. This may facilitate TRAF6 oligomerization and activate
  its ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to K63-linked polyubiquitination of targets
  including Nemo (not shown) and TRAF6 itself. This polyubiquitination reaction requires
  E1 and Ubc13/Uev1A, and can be reversed by deubiquitination enzymes such as CYLD
  and A20. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 is recruited to the TAK1/TAB2 complex through binding
  of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to the NZF domain of TAB2 as well as by the direct
  interaction between TRAF6 and TAB2. This binding may facilitate the dimerization
  or oligomerization of the TAK1/TAB2 complex, promoting its autophosphorylation and
  TAK1 activation. TAK1 then phosphorylates IKKβ, resulting in its activation.
