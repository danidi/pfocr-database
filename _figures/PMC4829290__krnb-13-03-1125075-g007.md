caption: Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolic pathway. The porphyrin and chlorophyll
  metabolic pathway was revealed by KEGG analysis. Small boxes represent proteins
  or enzymes (with EC nos.), with red boxes corresponding to the candidate target
  genes encoding them. Specific genes or enzymes are indicated in green for some species.
  Small circles indicate metabolites, and arrows represent the different metabolic
  pathways.
