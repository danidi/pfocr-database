caption: 'Redox reactions involved in fatty acid synthesis. A, acetyl-CoA can be synthesized
  from glucose, glutamine, or free acetate, and each pathway relies on different redox
  cofactors. B, fatty acid synthesis and elongation use two molecules of NADPH per
  molecule of acetyl-CoA. In this figure, two carbon atoms from acetyl-CoA are added
  to a fatty acyl-CoA containing n carbon atoms. Substrate oxidation is indicated
  in blue; substrate reduction is in pink; and transamination is in green. Abbreviations
  used are: αKG, α-ketoglutarate; OAA, oxaloacetate.'
