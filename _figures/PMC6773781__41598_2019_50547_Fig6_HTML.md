caption: CD98hc sustains cellular nutrition, redox homeostasis and nucleotide availability,
  all key for cell proliferation. CD98hc-xCT is required for the counterbalance of
  the oxidative stress, thereby avoiding the activation of the eIF2α-mediated integrated
  stress response pathway. In addition, CD98hc sustains BCAA and AAA availability,
  mostly mediated via LAT1, although contribution of y+LAT2 cannot be discarded, for
  general protein synthesis and cell proliferation, as evidenced by the downregulated
  mTORC1 activity, protein synthesis and proliferation rate in both cellular models
  CD98hc KO and low 6AA cells. Furthermore, as demonstrated in low 6AA cells, AA availability
  sustains RRM2 expression, and, as a consequence, has an impact in the reduction
  of ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxynucleotides, thereby balancing the
  cellular nucleotide content. In the same line, CD98hc regulates the cellular nucleotide
  pool, likely through the regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway flux, which
  enables cells to progress adequately throughout the cell cycle. The lack of CD98hc
  triggers a reduction in the glucose uptake and disposal, resulting in repressed
  glycolysis, which probably underlies the pentose phosphate pathway abrogation and
  the subsequent DNA replicative stress. Solid lines represent established connexions
  proposed in this work. Dashed lines represent connexions suggested by the data provided
  herein and literature.
