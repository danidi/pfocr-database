caption: Fanconi anemia and acquired aplastic anemia share several phenotypic features
  but have very different causal mechanisms. Computable relationships can be represented
  among diseases, phenotypic features, genes, and environmental exposures by interlinking
  terms (concepts) from sources including the Orphanet Rare Disease ontology (ORDO)
  (pink denotes diseases), the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for phenotypic features
  (orange), the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology for the chemical
  compounds (green denotes factors such as chemical exposures that can influence severity
  or trigger development of disease), and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations
  for the comet assay (single-cell gel-electrophoresis assay) of DNA breakage (aqua),
  as well as the Gene Ontology (lavender denotes a biologic pathway) and the Reactome
  for molecular pathways (blue denotes disease genes and mode of inheritance). Ontologies
  can be used to support the integrative analysis of these data sources for precision
  stratification and treatment and to clarify underlying mechanisms, as suggested
  by the dashed lines. The labeled arrows between concepts represent description-logic
  definitions that specify the formal relationships between the concepts. FA-A denotes
  Fanconi anemia, complementation group A; FA-B, complementation group B; and so on.
  In the diagram of the Fanconi anemia pathway, the blue circles represent the proteins
  encoded by the Fanconi genes (e.g., A is the protein encoded by FANCA), and the
  grayish-blue ovals represent other interacting proteins; P denotes phosphorylation,
  and ub ubiquitination.
