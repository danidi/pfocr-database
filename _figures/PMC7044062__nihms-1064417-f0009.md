caption: THP-1 cells were pretreated with vehicle or DCA (30 min) followed by stimulation
  with LPS (1 μg/ml) as described in . Biochemicals in the urea cycle pathway were
  measured, and box plots of the levels of selected analytes in the pathway shown.
  Significant differences are indicated for LPS relative to untreated cells (LPS)
  or DCA pretreatment relative to LPS (DCA+LPS) for each corresponding time point.
  Green boxes indicate a significant difference (p≤0.05) between the groups shown;
  metabolite ratio of <1.00. Red boxes indicate a significant difference (p≤0.05)
  between the groups shown; metabolite ratio of ≥1.00. Pink boxes indicate narrowly
  missed the statistical cutoff for significance 0.05<p<0.10; metabolite ratio of
  ≥1.00. N=5.
