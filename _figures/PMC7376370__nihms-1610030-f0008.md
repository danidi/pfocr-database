caption: Proposed mechanism and pathway of RUT in suppressing DSS-induced IBD in mice.
  In cytoplasm, KEAP1 protein is usually bound to NRF2 to stabilize NRF2 in the cytoplasm.
  Upon oxidative stress treatment, RUT directly binds to KEAP1 resulting in NRF2 release
  and translocation to the nucleus to bind to AREs and initiate the anti-oxidative
  response by upregulating the expression of downstream target genes including Nqo1,
  Hmox1, and Sod1, which then decreases intracellular ROS production and alleviates
  oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity. Pharmacologically, RUT improved DSS-induced
  colitis and alleviated intestinal inflammation dependent on NRF2 activation.
