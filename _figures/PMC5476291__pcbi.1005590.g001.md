caption: Central carbon metabolic network is composed of photosynthesis, the glyoxysome,
  citric acid cycle, glycolysis, carbohydrate synthesis, pentose phosphate pathway,
  lipid synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, protein, DNA, RNA, chlorophyll and biomass
  synthesis. During photosynthesis, inorganic carbon (CO2) is assimilated using light
  energy to produce a 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). In the glyoxysome,
  fatty acids (including acetate and butyrate) are degraded to Acetyl-CoA, which is
  then transformed to succinate (SUC) thanks to the glyoxylate cycle. SUC and GAP
  are then used as primary precursors to produce precursor metabolites and energy
  via the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle for protein, DNA, RNA, carbohydrate and lipid
  synthesis.
