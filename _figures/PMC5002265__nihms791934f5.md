caption: TA biosynthesis and modification pathways. LTA and WTA biosynthetic pathways
  in S. aureus are shown here. Although both are anionic sugar-phosphate backbones,
  they are assembled differently by separate biosynthetic pathways in S. aureus. TAs
  are further modified with d-alanine residues by the dlt pathway and with α- or β-
  GlcNAC residues installed by glycosyltransferases TarM and TarS, respectively. TAs
  perform several functions for the cell including playing roles in biofilm formation,
  adhesion, phage attachment, virulence and antibiotic resistance, most notably resistance
  to β-lactams. d-alanylation has been shown to play an important role in these functions
  as well. Specifically, the absence of d-alanine modifications sensitizes to cationic
  antimicrobial peptides, including host defensins. The only known roles for α- and
  β- GlcNAC modifications are in phage attachment, and for β-GlcNAcs, in β-lactam
  resistance. Due to its roles in adhesion, virulence and antibiotic resistance, attempts
  are being made to target TA biosynthesis and modification pathways. The known compounds
  targeting these pathways are shown here.
