caption: 'Tryptophan metabolism mediated immune cell response. L-tryptophan (Trp)
  can only be obtained in the human body from dietary sources. It is catabolized by
  the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) to L-kynurenine (Kyn). Interferon-γ
  produced by Th1 cells stimulates IDO-1 production in antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
  Tumor cells are also known to have increased production of IDO-1. Increases in IDO-1
  cause conversion of Trp to Kyn resulting in lower Trp and higher Kyn in plasma.
  Kyn is a ligand for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Mitochondrial AhR (MitoAhR)
  is localized in the inner membrane space of mitochondria and is also affected by
  Kyn. (1) Immune tolerance by kynurenine: increased Kyn causes immune tolerance by
  inhibiting proliferation of both T cells and NK cells by inhibiting maturation of
  dendritic cells and increasing proliferation of immune suppresser cells (Treg and
  MDSC). Tryptophan depletion also causes apoptosis of T cells due to nutrient deficiency.
  (2) NAD+ mediated immune function: in addition, Trp is one of the sources for NAD+
  biosynthesis. NAD+ is an important metabolite for metabolic processes [glycolysis,
  TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)] and production of NADPH. During
  oxidative burst in macrophages, NAPPH is oxidized in the presence of NADPH oxidase
  to produce superoxide which is utilized to kill pathogens. NAD+ contributes to CD4+
  T cell differentiation and SIRT3-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. (3) mTOR inhibitor
  rapamycin can be used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mitochondrial
  disease: T cell dysfunction is associated with SLE. In SLE, an increase in kynurenine
  and kynurenine mediated mTOR stimulation was observed. In addition, accumulation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing mitochondria and decreased Drp1 are associated
  with SLE. Rapamycin can increase Drp1 by inhibiting mTORC1. (4) Rapamycin inhibits
  mitochondrial ROS (mtROS): rapamycin inhibits mtROS through several mechanisms.
  Complex I in mitochondria is a source of ROS generation. Rapamycin can inhibit mtROS
  production by inhibiting complex I formation. In addition to this, rapamycin can
  inhibit mtROS by inducing autophagy and activating p62 and the NRF2 pathway.'
