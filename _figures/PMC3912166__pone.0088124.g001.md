caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway of sphingolipids relevant to this study is shown.
  Underlining indicates enzymes for sphingolipid biosynthesis. Pink-shaded boxes indicate
  the products of genes that were targeted by TALENs in this study. Red-lined boxes
  indicate the toxins used in this study. Cer, ceramide; SM, sphingomyelin; GlcCer,
  glucosylceramide; LacCer, lactosylceramide; Gb3, globotriaosylceramide; GalCer,
  galactosylceramide; Gb2, galabiosylceramide (Galα1-4GalCer); SMS, sphingomyelin
  synthase; UGCG; UDP-glucose: ceramide glucosyltransferase, B4GalT5, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase
