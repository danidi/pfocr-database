caption: PPARγ as a key regulator of lipogenesis in adipocytes and hypothetical major
  target for inhibitors of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis in obesity. Adipocytes from
  obese rodents and humans display decreased levels of lipogenic transcription factors
  (SREBP1c and ChREBP) and lipogenic enzymes (FAS, SCD1, ELOVL, DGAT) compared with
  lean controls. (a) Attenuation of PPARγ by candidate inhibitors generated in obesity
  would explain the downregulation of all of these proteins. Direct inhibition of
  the lipogenic transcription factors and enzymes by such inhibitors is also possible.
  (b) Inhibition of early steps in insulin signalling is also evident in adipocytes
  in obesity, through attenuation of IRS tyrosine phosphorylation and other inhibitory
  mechanisms, as shown in . While the factors listed as candidate inhibitors in the
  top box can be shown in vitro to exert such effects, the extent to which they contribute
  to insulin resistance in adipocytes in vivo remains to be fully elucidated. It should
  be noted that PPARγ also stimulates production of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (not shown in the Figure), which in turn stimulates lipogenesis through
  the pathway of glyceroneogenesis []. Thus PPARγ disruption will also lead to attenuation
  of this pathway. DGAT, Diglyceride acyltransferase; ELOVL, Elongation of long-chain
  fatty acids; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase
