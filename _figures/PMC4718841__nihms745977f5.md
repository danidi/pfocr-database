caption: Kyn signaling through AhR activation and increased hpol κ expression leads
  to constitutive DDR/RSR activation and higher levels of endogenous DNA damage. A
  model depicting the relationship between aberrant Kyn signaling, AhR activation,
  and over-expression of hpol κ is shown. Modulation at any point along this pathway
  alters endogenous DNA damage levels in glioblastoma cells.
