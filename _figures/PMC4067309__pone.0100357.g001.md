caption: 'The major products previously found in E. breviscapus are surrounded by
  shaded boxes. Enzymes found in this study are boxed; new putative enzyme (flavone
  6-hydroase, F6H) was surrounded by dashed line box. Enzymes involved in the pathways

  4-hydroxylase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase, DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; F3′5′H flavonoid 3′5′ hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase  =  flavonol synthase (FLS); FSII, flavone synthase
  II; HCGQT, hydroxycinnamoyl D-glucose: quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; HCT,
  hydroxycinnamoyl CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; HQT, hydroxycinnamoyl
  CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase  = 
  anthocyanidin synthase (ANS); OMT, O-methyltransferase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; RT, rhamnosyl transferase; UFGT, UDPG-flavonoid glucosyl transferase; UGCT,
