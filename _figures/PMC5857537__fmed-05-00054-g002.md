caption: Molecular alterations in aldosterone-producing benign adrenal cortical neoplasms.
  In normal physiology, aldosterone production by adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells
  is mediated by the calcium/calmodulin signaling pathway. In the resting state, ZG
  cells are hyperpolarized, a process mainly mediated by K+ channels. Activation of
  the renin–angiotensin system results in the production of angiotensin II, which
  binds to type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT2R) causing inhibition of K+ currents
  and depolarization of cell membrane. The latter activates voltage-gated Ca2+ channel
  leading to influx of Ca2+ and activation of the calmodulin kinase pathway, which
  enables aldosterone synthesis. In primary aldosteronism, mutations implicating the
  K+ channels (KCNJ5), ATPases (ATP1A1, ATP2B3), and Ca2+ channels (CACNA1D) have
  been identified in ~60% of sporadic aldosterone-producing adenomas. These molecular
  alterations are thought to result in autonomous aldosterone production and cellular
  proliferation through aberrant activation of the calcium/calmodulin kinase signaling
  pathway.
