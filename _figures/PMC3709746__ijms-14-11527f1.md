caption: Complex regulatory network of cold acclimation, including key components.
  (A) Light signalling; (B) Circadian regulation; (C) Photoperiodic regulation.   Indicates
  cold acclimation pathway in which HY5 regulates the expression of anthocyanin pathway
  genes through by Z-box/LTRE to control photo-oxidative stress generated by low temperature.
  → Indicates cold acclimation pathway in which phytochromes negatively regulates
  the expression of CBF regulon under high red/far red light condition.   Indicates
  circadian clock-regulated cold acclimation pathway in which CCA1 showed selfregulation
  activity through alternate splicing event in response to cold and it can form heterodimers
  with LHY to bind directly to promoter region of CBF genes.   Indicates influence
  of circadian clock over light and photoperiod mediated cold acclimation pathway
  which is unclear.   Indicates photoperiod involvement in cold acclimation pathway
  which is regulated by the PHY B and the activity of PIF4/7 in response to SD and
  LD which can repress the CBF expression under LD by direct binding to promoter region.  /  Width
  of arrow indicates the expression levels of CBF genes in response to photoperiod.
