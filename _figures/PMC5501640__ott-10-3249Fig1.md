caption: 'The sketch of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. The Hh signaling pathway
  contains three Hh homologs: Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh. (A) When the ligand
  is absent (“Off” state), the patched (Ptc) receptor inhibits the downstream protein
  Smoothened (SMO). Henceforth, glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli) proteins
  are sequestered by Suppressor of Fused (SuFu). The Hh pathway is, generally, inhibited
  at “Off” state. (B) After activation of the Hh ligand, Hh proteins are released
  from the signaling cell. Hh then subsequently binds (“On” state) to PtcH, removing
  the inhibition and further activating SMO. SMO then regulates the downstream transduction
  molecules of Gli proteins (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3). Gli proteins are subsequently
  transferred to the nuclei and they exert their transduction functions.'
