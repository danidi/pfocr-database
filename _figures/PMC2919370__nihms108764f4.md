caption: RAD17 functions as a clamp loader for the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 trimer. This trimer
  acts as a ring that can slide on DNA to act as a sensor of DNA damage, and activates
  ATR in response to replication stress or blockage of replication forks by DNA damage.
  RPA is a single-strand DNA binding protein that independently recruits the ATRIP-ATR
  complex through direct binding of RPA to ATRIP. ATR then activates the downstream
  Chk1 kinase by phosphorylating it. Claspin also forms a ring-like structure that
  can slide on DNA and which is required for phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR. ATR also
  phosphorylates a large number of other DNA damage response proteins, including RAD17
  and RAD9. (B) ATR or Chk1-dependent phosphorylation of multiple FA proteins, including
  FANCA, FANCE, FANCDD2, and FANCDI, may regulate their recruitment to sites of replication
  stress. Phosphorylation of FANCA, FANCI, and FANCD2 by ATR ultimately upregulates
  monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI in response to replication stress or DNA
  damage. The stability of FANCE, a member of the FA nuclear core complex, is regulated
  by Chk1-mediated phosphorylation.
