caption: Cleavage of full length TNF/Eiger by ADAM17 leads to the production of soluble
  TNF/Eiger, which can engage the TNF receptor, Grindelwald. TNF signalling inhibits
  the production of mitochondrial ROS inside pigmented glial cells, through unknown
  mechanisms. In the absence of TNF signalling, glial‐generated ROS combines with
  ROS from neighbouring photoreceptor neurons to trigger production of LDs. Upon their
  later dispersal, the combination of fatty acids and ROS leads to high levels of
  toxic peroxidated lipids, which are toxic to the glia. Finally, glial degeneration
  is followed by neuronal degeneration.
