caption: The biology of HPV infection and malignant transformation provides several
  sequential points for HPV recognition. Concurrent evidence for HPV DNA, transcriptional
  activation, and disruption of key growth regulatory pathways (e.g. retinoblastoma
  pathway) confirms the presence of clinically and biologically relevant HPV.
