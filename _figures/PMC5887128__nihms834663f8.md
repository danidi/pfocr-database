caption: CCN5 exerts its anti-CF effects by inhibiting both EndMT and the transdifferentiation
  of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. In addition, CCN5 induces apoptosis specifically
  in myofibroblasts. CCN5 mediates these functions at least partly by inhibiting the
  TGF-β signaling pathway. CF = cardiac fibrosis; EndMT = endothelial-mesenchymal
  transition; TGF = transforming growth factor.
