caption: 'Chitin synthesis pathway derived from Drosophila melanogaster (KEGG: dme00520)
  showing genes are conserved across insects and copepods. The gene name provided
  by KEGG is on top followed by the gene name for sea lice (taken from microarray
  annotation) and the abbreviated gene name on bottom with the corresponding e-value
  derived from a BLASTx search using the D. melanogaster sequence against the TSA
  database (NCBI) limited to L. salmonis sequences. Those sequences highlighted in
  red were differentially expressed in at least one condition. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)'
