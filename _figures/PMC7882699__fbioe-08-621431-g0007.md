caption: Significantly differentially expressed genes in important metabolic pathways,
  including the glycolysis pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA cycle,
  and the amphotericin precursors synthesis. The red arrow in the metabolic pathway
  diagram represents gene upregulation. The blue arrow represents gene downregulation.
  The fold difference in gene expression is presented in histograms. The red column
  represents gene upregulation, and the dark green column represents gene downregulation.
