caption: Examples of pathway duplication in (a) Avida and (b窶電) yeast. (a) The evolution
  of the FGA within one lineage of digital organisms. These FGAs show that the instructions
  first involved in the AND function also contribute to the NAND function and the
  NOT function. With respect to the instructions that constitute them, it seems that
  the two subsequent functions are partial copies of the AND function, or in other
  words that the AND function has been duplicated to form the two other functions.
  (b窶電) Three pairs of pathways which suggest a similar type of function duplication
  in yeast (downloaded from http://www.yeastgenome.org/, 18 October 2008; ). (b)(i)
  4-Aminobutyrate degradation and (ii) glutamate degradation I; (c)(i) isoleucine
  biosynthesis and (ii) valine biosynthesis; (d)(i) fructose degradation and (ii)
  mannose degradation. In all these examples, the larger pathway was probably formed
  through the addition of one or two genes.
