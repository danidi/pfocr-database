caption: Sources of hydrogens for the synthesis of palmitoyl-CoA from glucose and
  body water via fatty acyl-CoA synthase, with the butyryl acyl carrier protein (Butyryl-ACP)
  intermediate also shown. When glucose is metabolized via glycolysis, hydrogens 1
  and 6 (shown in blue) are transferred to pyruvate and then to acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
  (represented by blue italic). During the first cycle of fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA
  and malonyl-CoA hydrogens are incorporated into the terminal methyl group and one
  of the position 2 hydrogens of butyryl-ACP, respectively. In the palmitoyl-CoA product,
  this corresponds to the terminal methyl hydrogens and one of the methylene hydrogens
  attached to each even-numbered carbon. When glucose is metabolized via the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), hydrogens 1 and 3 (shown in red) are transferred to NADPH.
  During the first cycle of fatty acid synthesis, these are incorporated into both
  position 3 hydrogens of butyryl-ACP and subsequently into both methylene hydrogens
  attached to each odd-numbered carbon of palmitoyl-CoA. The remaining hydrogen in
  position 2 of butyryl-ACP is derived from body water (shown in gray) and is incorporated
  into one of the methylene hydrogens attached to each even-numbered carbon of palmitoyl-CoA.
  The color scheme indicates possible labeling sites only and is not meant to represent
  the stoichiometry of hydrogen transfer.
