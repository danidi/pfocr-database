caption: Proposed model for future research into pathogenesis of DAIH. Acute rejection
  episodes may prime the immune system to mount a self-directed response. Acute rejection
  is initiated by the large number of recipient T cells that recognize donor alloantigens
  encoded by MHC., Alloantigen presentation may be via direct pathway or indirect
  pathway. Graft injury reveals previously unseen epitopes. IL-17 would contribute
  to an inflammatory milieu and lead to the production of antibodies by B cells. In
  the absence of other negative regulatory mechanisms, this possibly contributes to
  the development of autoimmunity.
