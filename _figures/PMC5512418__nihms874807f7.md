caption: Poorly immunogenic tumor cells evade host immune defenses, despite expressing
  antigenic neoepitopes. LATS1/2 deletion in tumor cells stimulates nucleic-acid-rich
  EV secretion, which induces a type I IFN response via the TLRs-MYD88/TRIF pathway.
  Type I IFN stimulates multiple components of host immune responses, including cross-presentation
  of tumor-derived antigens by antigen-presenting cells and T cell activation. Activated
  T cells, in turn, facilitate tumor-specific responses of cytotoxic T cells and antibody
  production by B cells, promoting tumor destruction. Thus, loss of LATS1/2 in tumors
  leads to the rejection of both LATS1/2-deficient and LATS1/2-adequate tumor cells
  by enhancing host anti-tumor immune responses.
