caption: 'Cellular contributors to tau-dependent degeneration. The development of
  tau-related pathogenesis has characteristic stages, starting from the formation
  of tau species consisting of phosphorylated tau dissociated from microtubules ①.
  Abbreviation: pTau, phosphorylated tau. Hyperphosphorylation of tau incorrectly
  sorts tau into the somatodendritic compartment, which is linked to dysfunctional
  axonal transport ②, one of the earliest pathological features of tauopathies. Glial
  cells adapt a more neuroprotective phenotype with microglia classically activated
  ③ and astrocytes actively phagocytosing tau species ④. As disease progresses, astrocytes
  transform into a loss-of-function phenotype via lower-level expression of astrocyte-specific
  transporters, leading to neuronal excitotoxicity and upregulated tau release. Additionally,
  alternatively activated microglia in a pro-inflammatory phenotype are necessary
  and sufficient to induce reactive astrocytes with the capability of releasing neuroinflammatory
  cytokines ⑥. At the later stages of disease progression, the microglial-exosomal
  pathway acts as the essential tau propagation pathway ⑧ as an alternative to transsynaptic
  transduction, due to extensive synaptic degeneration and neuronal death ⑨. The formation
  of neuronal and glial tau plaques is the most important hallmark of tauopathies
  ⑩. Red arrows indicate pathological consequences of change. Created in BioRender.com.'
