caption: Trumpp and colleagues described a progression marked by acquisition of CD48
  (MPP2 and 3)  and we show it as the top pathway. This option and particularly MPP
  that lack CD86, is promoted by the JAK2 mutant transgene. Alternatively, the Morrison
  lab showed that HSC can lose CD150 (formation of MPP 1, 2, 3 in the lower pathway)
  . This route is diminished in the transgenics and most of the loss is in CD86+ MPP.
