caption: Before entering into this field, a short recall of the state of the art of
  the sterol biosynthesis is needed. Sterol biosynthesis is complex and involves at
  least 25 steps from isopentenyl diphosphate, the commited precursor of all isoprenoids,
  to end pathway sterols. The biosynthetic scheme of  is common to most higher plants
  and also applies to Arabidopsis. From isopentenyl diphosphate to 2,3-oxidosqualene
  (OS) the biosynthetic pathway is the same in eukaryotes, however profound differences
  exist downstream of OS (). Whereas OS is cyclized to lanosterol in nonphotosynthetic
  eukaryotes, it is cyclized to cycloartenol, an isomer of lanosterol possessing a
  cyclopropane ring in place of the Δ8 double bond, in photosynthetic eukaryotes.
  However some exceptions to this rule will be discussed below. As end pathway plant
  sterols do not contain a cyclopropane ring, an enzyme capable of opening it exist
  in photosynthetic eukaryotes. A third difference consists in the presence in higher
  plant sterols (sitosterol, stigmasterol…) of an extra 24-ethyl group, resulting
  from two methylation steps situated between cycloartenol and end pathway sterols.
  Sterols from vertebrates are not alkylated at C-24, whereas sterols from most fungi
  possess only one methyl at C-24. Finally the passage from cycloartenol to end pathway
  sterols involves three demethylation steps at positions C4 and C14 of the sterol
  skeleton. The order and the position of these steps strongly differ in non photosynthetic
  and photosynthetic eukaryotes.
