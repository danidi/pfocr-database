caption: Mechanism of PMN recruitment and PMN transmigration. S. typhimurium utilizes
  its T3SS to secrete effector proteins into epithelial cells to activate inflammatory
  signaling pathways. In particular, the activation of Rho-GTPases by SopE, SopE2,
  and SopB result in the induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
  The stimulated pathways include ERK, JNK, and p38, resulting in the terminal activation
  of major inflammatory regulator NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB results in the basolateral
  secretion of IL-8 producing a chemoattractant gradient that recruits neutrophils
  to the subepithelial region from the underlying microvasculature. Th17 cells are
  also present in the subepithelial region, and function to recruit and activate neutrophils
  in the subepithelium. PMN transmigration is facilitated by another chemattractant
  HXA3. HXA3 is a bioactive eicosanoid that is synthesized from arachidonic acid via
  the 12/15-lipoxygenase pathway in epithelial cells. It is secreted into the lumen
  via the action of an ATP-binding cassette transporter called MRP2. S. typhimurium
  effector protein SipA stimulates the recruitment of PKC-α to the apical membrane,
  which in addition to the ERM protein ezrin, modulate the localization of MRP2 to
  the apical membrane, thereby allowing secretion of HXA3 into the lumen and production
  of the chemoattractant gradient that induces PMN transmigration.
