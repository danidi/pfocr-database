caption: Longitudinal multistage observation model, including a lung cancer pathway
  (top) and an effective other-cause mortality pathway (bottom). The longitudinal
  data used for model calibration consist of individual smoking histories and variable
  combinations of sequential events, or observations. The lung cancer pathway includes
  three cell populations (circles), with j = 0 representing a deterministic number
  of normal stem cells, and two stochastic stages (j = 1 and j = 2) representing populations
  of pre-malignant and malignant cells, respectively. Pre-malignant and malignant
  cells undergo stochastic birth at rates αj, death or differentiation at rates βj,
  and mutation at rates μj,j+1 (with mutation modeled as an asymmetric cell division
  process), and observations at rates ξk. Observation probabilities in the lung cancer
  pathway (boxes labeled k = 0, ···, 3) are related to the size of the malignant cell
  population (j = 2), and also to the indolent cell population (j = 2′) for CT screening.
  Survivals and hazards for CT screen detection and histological confirmation of lung
  cancer (k = 1), lung cancer incidence (k = 2), and lung cancer morality (k = 3)
  are conditioned on subjects being healthy at study entry (k = 0) and on prior observations.
  Symbols δ represent a fraction of states or observations, with δ2 representing the
  indolent fraction of lung cancers that are detectable by CT and histologically confirmed
  as lung cancers while not contributing to lung cancer incidence or death during
  follow-up; δ3 is the “missing” fraction of expected lung cancer deaths that do not
  occur due to apparent cure, treatment related delay of death beyond end of follow
  up, or excess other-cause mortality after lung cancer incidence; δ4 is the sub-fraction
  of previously diagnosed lung cancers that (due to morbidity or misclassification)
  contribute to excess other-cause mortality instead of lung cancer mortality. The
  other-cause mortality pathway is separate from the lung cancer pathway. However,
  individual deaths occur through a competition between these pathways. Similar notation
  is used for the other-cause mortality pathway with k = 4 representing other-cause
  death, but with effective rates that are not interpretable in terms of cell kinetics.
  The pi (i = 1, ··· 19) label model parameters which are estimated from likelihood-based
  fitting to cohort data (See ).
