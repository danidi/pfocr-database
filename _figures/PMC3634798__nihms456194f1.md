caption: Stress response pathways. Air pollutant effects may occur in large part through
  the generation of ROS or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) from organic chemicals
  either directly from air pollutant components, or through activation of bronchial
  epithelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and endothelial cells (specific details
  in text). Air pollutant components from fossil fuel combustion including polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), quinones, and transition metals (e.g., Fe) have pro-oxidant
  properties and may induce oxidative stress through the production of free radicals
  and subsequent activation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways (e.g., Nrf2, ARE,
  NF-κB). These pathways may be behind findings indicating that exposure to fine particles
  trigger inflammatory and cytotoxic responses in the human lung as well as systemic
  inflammation and thrombosis when oxidant defenses are inadequate. Systemic oxidative
  stress and inflammation may occur as a result of effects of pollutants on the airways
  (indirect pathway) or from the direct systemic distribution of pollutant chemicals
  following pulmonary deposition
