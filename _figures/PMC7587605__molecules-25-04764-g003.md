caption: 'Mechanism of resistance: (A) impaired binding of the ADC to the target antigen
  by antigen downregulation, loss of antigen expression or mutations in the antigen;
  (B) defects in the internalization pathway and reduced cell surface trafficking;
  (C) impaired degradation of ADCs in lysosomes due to reduced lysosomal proteolytic
  or acidification function or loss of lysosomal transporter expression inhibiting
  the release of cytotoxic payload lysosomes to the cytoplasm; (D) cytoplasmic factors,
  e.g., aberrant polo-like kinase 1 activity preventing mitotic arrest or due to defective
  cyclin B1 induction; (E) the overexpression of drug efflux transporters; (F) dysregulation
  in the apoptotic pathway through the deficient activity of proapoptotic proteins
  Bak and Bax or the overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins BCl-2 and Bcl-x.'
