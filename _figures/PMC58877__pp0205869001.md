caption: Flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis (adapted from ). The scheme
  is simplified to show essentially the steps leading to proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins,
  and flavonols. Only the mutants corresponding to genes of known function are presented.
  The mutants in parentheses correspond to regulatory genes, the others to structural
  genes encoding the enzymes chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavonoid
  3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H), dihydroflavonol reductase
  (DFR), and a dihydroflavonol reductase-like (DFR-like), as indicated in square brackets.
  The dashed arrow represents several steps.
