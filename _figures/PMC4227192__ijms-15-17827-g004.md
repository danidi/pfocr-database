caption: The mechanisms increasing the intracellular glucose level on insulin stimulation
  and GS desensitization in 3T3-L1 cells. In the basal state (Control), insulin stimulation
  does not result in increased intracellular free glucose, because glucose transport
  and its utilization are in equilibrium. In experiments where GS is resistant to
  insulin stimulation (dGS), insulin augments glucose transport, which exceeds the
  rate of glucose utilization. Hence, an increase in free glucose is measured. IR,
  insulin receptor; GLUT, glucose transporters; GS, glycogen synthase; dGS, desensitized
  glycogen synthase. The red arrow in combination with + indicates stimulation, red
  arrow with ┴ designates inhibition. Short black arrows indicate insulin signaling
  and long black arrows indicate glucose pathway. Blue arrow indicates increased glucose
  level.
