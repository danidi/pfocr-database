caption: Metabolic perturbations of the phenolic biosynthetic pathway in the transgenic
  tobacco HR clones caused by heterologous gene expression. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; STS, stilbene synthase; CHS, chalcone synthase; TFC, total flavonoid content;
  Stilb, total stilbene contents; Inh, amiRNA-CHS expression; TF, AtMYB12 TF expression;
  In red, activated pathway; In grey, inhibited pathway; Blue box, value of the mathematical
  correlation between gene expression and/or plant secondary metabolite accumulation;
  ccP, Pearson correlation coefficient.
