caption: A schematic depiction of the pathway for CaMK-dependent signaling. Graphical
  abstract from Ref. []. Cartoon representations of the various players are used for
  the sake of simplicity. The dodecameric structure of the CaMKII enables intramultimer
  autophosphorylation and persistent activation in the case of α/βCaMKII, as shown
  in the work of Schulman and colleagues [], and provides a large capacity to trap
  and transport Ca2+/CaM in the case of γCaMKII. Thus, the evolutionary development
  of CaMKII involvement for signaling upstream of the classic CaMK cascade (Soderling
  and colleagues and Means and associates [,]) offers multiple functional advantages.
