caption: 'Degradation and down-regulation pathways containing alternative paths to
  HIV-1 targeted paths. A. Ubiquitin dependent degradation of cyclin D1. The colored
  circle represents the proteasome complex. B. Vif-mediated degradation of Apobec3g.
  The same proteasome complex shown in A is part of this pathway also. This is an
  HIV-1 specific pathway as per its listing in the pathway database, and thus already
  contains HIV-1 proteins as part of the pathway. C. EGFR down-regulation. Here, down-regulation
  is achieved via internalization. The color coding is as follows: Purple - HIV target
  (according to G1, except in the cholesterol one where the purple is according to
  predictions). Blue - si-RNA, Red - Drug Target, Yellow - All 3, Green - si-RNA and
  Drug, Target, Silver - Drug Target and Group 1, Brown - siRNA and Group 1.'
