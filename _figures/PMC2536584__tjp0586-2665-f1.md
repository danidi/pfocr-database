caption: A schematic illustration of the brain glycolytic pathway under aerobic conditions
  in which glucose is broken down to the glycolytic end-product lactate. Lactate,
  in turn, becomes the mitochondrial substrate, via its conversion to pyruvate, for
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle. At maximal work load, as measured in the study of
  Larsen et al. (2008) most of the lactate that is utilized by brain mitochondria
  is muscular in origin and thus exogenous. Under resting conditions, most of the
  lactate used by brain mitochondria originates from glucose that is metabolized glycolytically
  in neurons and glia.
