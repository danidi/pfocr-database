caption: Glucose sensing pathway in β cells and glucose-stimulated insulin release.
  Glucose initially affects the cell-surface glucose sensing receptor (GSR) that produces
  a signal to initiate metabolism in mitochondria. Glucose then enters β cells by
  facilitated diffusion via D-glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and is metabolized to
  pyruvate. Pyruvate enters the TCA cycle either through oxidative decarboxylation
  to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex or through carboxylation to
  oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Elevation of ratio of ADP to ATP inhibits
  ATP-sensitive K+ (K+ATP ) channels and subsequently leads to depolarization of the
  plasma membrane that leads to opening of a voltage-dependent calcium channel in
  plasma membrane and calcium entry into the cell, and finally leading to exocytosis
  of insulin granules
