caption: TRB3 at the crossroads of ER stress and mTORC function. Acute and chronic
  kidney disease are associated with activation of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress
  pathway. During ER stress Protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) phosphorylates
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor α (eIF2α) and inhibits protein translation.
  Additionally, there is selective translation of activating transcription factor-4
  (ATF4), which induces expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and drives TRB3
  expression. Kidney disease is also associated with activation of mTORC and inhibition
  of autophagy flux. We propose that in the kidney, TRB3 binds to Rictor and mTORC2
  and inhibits phosphorylation of pAKTSer473. This in turn reduces inflammatory gene
  expression (IL-6 and MCP-1) and potentially modifies activation of mTORC1 and autophagy.
