caption: Type 1 diabetes pathogenesis and β cell protective factors. CD8+ effector
  T cells are considered the mediators of β cell killing, with the final common pathway
  involving a multitude of cells including autoreactive CD4+, CD8+, and B cells, failures
  of Tregs, and β cells that have changed susceptibly to killing and apoptosis. The
  pathogenesis is thought to begin with the release of β cell antigens, which antigen
  presenting cells (APCs) uptake and present to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by Class II
  and Class I major histocompatibility molecules (MHC II and MHC I). This activates
  several pathways that ultimately lead to the immune destruction of β cells, via
  FasL-mediated apoptosis, release of chemokines and cytokines, and direct cytolytic
  killing. Recent studies have focused on new therapeutic targets that may help protect
  β cells from immune attack (highlighted in blue). These include therapies that target
  immune dysregulation, such as IL-2 and Treg infusions. There is also interest in
  understanding how intrinsic factors in β cells affect their response to immune attack
  and immune therapies. Endoplasmic reticulum stress may contribute to β cell death,
  and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib may inhibit this pathway. There is also
  some evidence that β cell dedifferentiation contributes to the pathology of T1D,
  with a subpopulation that is able to resist immune killing, which has increased
  expression of immune inhibitory proteins like PD-L1. Therapies that target these
  protective factors, used in combination with other immune therapies, could be beneficial
  for the treatment of T1D.
