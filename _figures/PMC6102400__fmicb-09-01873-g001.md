caption: Interactions of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or LRY (green) with Helicobacter
  pylori (red) and damaged epithelial cells at the gastric mucosal surface. (A) H.
  pylori upregulates TNF-α () and IL-8 (; ), which in turn upregulate gastrin-17 ().
  H. pylori produces urease to reduce the pH in its immediate environment as means
  of survival (). (B) Interactions under A are causing inflammation and apoptosis.
  (C) Gastric inflammation and apoptosis lead to ulceration. (D) LRY binds specifically
  at affected (mucosal) tissue due to change in microbiota and inflammatory markers
  (immunoglobulins and cytokines) and qualitative and quantitative changes in the
  mucus (). LRY upregulates COX-2 protein expression in damaged (ulcerated) stomachs
  (), which induces PGE2 modulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression,
  causing angiogenesis (; ; ). LRY inhibits H pylori induced IL-8 (interleukin-8)
  release (; ) and TNF-α release (; ). Through suppression of TNF-α and IL-8, H pylori
  induced elevated gastrin-17 levels are attenuated (). (E) LRY inhibits H pylori
  adhesion (), which appears to be related to competition for binding sites (; ).
  LRY activates Akt/protein kinase B, which is an anti-apoptotic signaling pathway
  (). LRY blocks p38 MAP, which is a pro-apoptosis (cell survival) signaling pathway
  (). LRY induces upregulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (enzyme essential
  in DNA stabilization and thus cell growth) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) causing
  attenuation of apoptosis (). LRY shows antagonistic activity against H. pylori in
  vitro, possibly associated with lactic acid production (; ). Lactic acid increases
  the cell wand permeability of H. pylori. Besides, production of exopolysaccharide
  (), lectin (), and/or peptides with antimicrobial activity () by LRY has been shown
  to inhibit other pathogenic bacteria, however, this effect has not been shown for
  H. pylori specifically. LRY inhibits urease activity of H. pylori (). (F) LRY upregulates
  COX-1 (cyclooxygenase-1) protein expression (; ) in normal stomachs (ulcer prevention),
  which increases PGE2, which in turn protects mucus cells and increases trans mucosal
  resistance, thereby protecting mucosal cells from apoptosis (; ). LRY upregulates
  the expression of MUC3 and MUC6 mucin gene, causing significant increase in thickness
  of the basal mucus layer (; ). (G) LRY causes upregulation of phosphorylation level
  of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF receptor), leading to cell proliferation
  and angiogenesis and suppresses cell apoptosis (). LRY initially improves epithelial
  (mucosal) barrier function (; ) but increases H. pylori induced barrier deterioration
  after incubation for 24–42 h, hence causes delayed cell membrane damage and leakage
  ().
