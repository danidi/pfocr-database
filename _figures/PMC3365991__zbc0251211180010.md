caption: Model for AP-3, AP-1, and BLOC-2 cooperation with Rab38 and Rab32 to mediate
  transport to maturing melanosomes. Rab38 and Rab32 interact with AP-3, AP-1, and
  BLOC-2 at early endosome membrane domains where cargo such as the tyrosinases are
  concentrated and packaged into transport intermediates. Upon budding, some components
  of the coat (AP-3, AP-1, and clathrin) dissociate from the vesicle but others remain
  bound (Rab32, Rab38, and possibly BLOC-2) to mediate further transport, tethering,
  and fusion with maturing melanosomes. During melanosome biogenesis, transition between
  stage II and stage III occurs upon incorporation of the melanogenic enzymes with
  the concomitant beginning of melanin synthesis, and thus vesicles defined by Rab32
  and Rab38 likely target this melanosome maturation stage. Deficiency in different
  components of these pathways elicits cargo accumulation in the early endosomes that
  eventually leaks into other pathways such as the recycling pathway toward the plasma
  membrane or the late endosome/multivesicular body (MVB) degradative pathway.
