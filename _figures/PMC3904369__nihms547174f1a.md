caption: (A) DNA damage-induced miRNA biogenesis. DNA damage activates a signaling
  cascade which activates the processing of miRNA precursors. DNA-damage induced ATM
  phosphorylates KSRP and enhances its ability to recruit pri-miRNAs to DROSHA. BRCA1
  directly interacts with both pri-miRNAs and the DROSHA complex. Processing by the
  DROSHA complex allows cytoplasmic export of pre-miRNAs. The MAPK ERK is also phosphorylated
  after DNA damage. ERK phosphorylates TRBP and phospho-TRBP stabilizes the TRBP-DICER
  complex to promote pre-miRNAs processing in the cytoplasm. Increased levels of mature
  miRNAs could play a role in the DNA damage response by (i) decreasing the levels
  of anti-repair genes (such as the anti-recombinases, Srs2, PARI, RTEL1) (ii) down-regulate
  DDR proteins through a feedback regulation loop to restore pre-DNA damage levels.(B)
  DNA damage-induced repression of miRNA transcription. BRCA1 associates with HDAC2
  which deacetylates histone H2A and H3 on miR-155 promoter, leading to miR-155 transcriptional
  repression. Transcriptional repression of miRNAs could contribute to the DDR by
  allowing increased expression of target proteins that are involved in DNA repair
  and checkpoint control.(C) miRNAs impacting DSB repair pathway choice. There is
  inter-play of NHEJ and HR pathways during the course of the cell cycle, and this
  is critical for cell health. NHEJ is known to be active throughout the cell cycle
  phases and HR activity is maximum in S phase and gradually decreases over G2 phase,
  , . In G1, NHEJ is promoted by 53BP1 and H2AX which prevent CtIP-mediated resection
  of the broken end, . Resection at a DSB impedes NHEJ and allows HR. In S-phase HR
  is active and BRCA1 is a key player in recruitment of HR proteins to DSBs, thereby
  excluding NHEJ factors like 53BP1, . CtIP promotes ends resection to allow formation
  of RPA-coated ssDNA at a DSB, . BRCA2 is the mediator protein that is essential
  for replacing RPA with RAD51 and the formation of the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein
  filament. In normal cells, miRNAs maintain optimal expression of DNA repair factors
  allowing efficient repair of DSBs. However, when miRNAs are aberrantly expressed
  it disrupts the correct choice of DSB repair pathway. For example, over expression
  of miRNAs targeting H2AX (indicated by bold arrow) may allow CtIP-mediated resection
  in G1 preventing NHEJ. HR-mediated repair in G1 is detrimental to cell health as
  it would lead to the loss of heterozygosity. Conversely, in S-phase over-expression
  of miRNAs targeting BRCA1 will impede HR and allow factors such as 53BP1 to direct
  the DSB to the NHEJ-mediated repair pathway, which in turn leads to higher mutation
  rates and chromosomal instability.
