caption: A model for the BRCA2/RAD51 pathway in response to DSBs. Not all proteins
  and protein–protein interactions are shown and the outlines are for illustration
  only. a After their recruitment by BRCA1/MRN, BRCA2/RAD51 complexes act upstream
  and downstream of ATR (see text for details). b After disruption of nucleosomes
  and transformation of DSB ends into ssDNA by BRCA1/MRN and ATM (1), RPA/BRCA2/RAD51
  recruits ATR (2) to enhance SCC/alignment before the formation/stabilization of
  D-loop at which the 3′-ssDNA end primes new DNA synthesis (3). ATR recruitment/activation
  could also occur during or after strand invasion and D-loop formation/stabilization,
  since transformation of DSB ends into 3′-ssDNA could be performed by the unwinding
  activity of MRN rather than its exonuclease activity that normally yields 5′-ssDNA
  ends. In this case, unwinding, strand invasion and D-loop formation/stabilization
  could occur simultaneously after the search for homology, alignment/pairing between
  DSB ends and the intact homologous dsDNA partner. In either case, the resulting
  intermediate can either disassemble, the newly synthesized strand can be displaced
  by unwinding to anneal with the non-invading 3′-ssDNA end to elicit non-crossover
  gene conversion only, or be processed to yield gene conversion with or without crossover
  (4). Short EMSY interferes with ATR recruitment/activation by overriding RPA (5),
  without affecting the ability of BRCA2/RAD51 to bind ssDNA and perform SSA (6).
  At D-loops, such as at gene promoters and replication origins, free RAD51 oligomers
  could also compete with RNA and DNA polymerases for ssDNA and thereby block initiation
  of transcription, replication and repair until activation/recruitment of PIKKs that
  would disrupt RAD51 oligomers into monomers. The loading of RAD51 oligomers by BRCA2ex27
  on ssDNA may also act similarly until disruption of RAD51 filament by post-translational
  modifications (i.e., phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation) that would allow
  transcription, replication and repair to proceed and thereby resume cell-cycle arrest.
  In this case, transcription and replication factors could act as cellular GPS (guiding
  position system) elements, recruiting checkpoint proteins to specific sites. Such
  BRCA2/RAD51 transcription/replication-checkpoint function could explain why checkpoint-deficient
  cells exhibit radio-resistant DNA synthesis, a characteristic feature of CIN syndromes,
  including BRCA-deficiency (see text). Thus, whereas RAD51 oligomer can act as a
  transcription/replication/repair repressor upstream of PIKKs, BRCA2/RAD51 complex
  can behave as both an activator and a repressor upstream and downstream of PIKKs,
  respectively
