caption: a) During infection, both the alternative and classical complement pathways
  may be activated by N. gonorrhoeae. N. gonorrhoeae binds complement proteins to
  prevent opsonization and killing by membrane attack complexes, as well as siaylates
  its LOS to hide from the complement system. N. gonorrhoeae binds host Factor H and
  C4bp, becoming serum resistant by presenting as ‘self’ and shielding itself from
  complement recognition,N. gonorrhoeae also binds to the alternative complement pathway
  receptor CR3 and the receptor for iC3b, a process thought to aid in epithelial cell
  invasion. N. gonorrhoeae binds C3b through Lipid A on its LOS, rapidly inactivating
  C3b to iC3b through factor I. b) N. gonorrhoeae is able to survive in and around
  macrophages and neutrophils during infection, and modulate the immune activating
  properties of dendritic cells,,,,,,. In macrophages, N. gonorrhoeae is able to survive
  inside the phagosome and modulate apoptosis and production of inflammatory cytokines
  . The bacteria polarize macrophages, resulting in macrophages less capable of T
  cell activation, and similarly, dendritic cells exposed to N. gonorrhoeae are less
  capable of stimulating T cell proliferation. The interactions of N. gonorrhoeae
  and neutrophils is complex and is discussed in detail in the text. c) N. gonorrhoeae
  infection does not generate immunological memory, due to the ability of N. gonorrhoeae
  to antigenically and phase vary its surface structures including Type IV pili, Opa
  proteins, and LOS. In addition, N. gonorrhoeae modulates the adaptive immune response
  by suppressing T helper cell proliferation and subsequent activation through influencing
  cytokine production,,.
