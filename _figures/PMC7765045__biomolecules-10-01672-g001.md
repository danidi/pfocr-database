caption: 'Schematic representation of the main pharmacogenetic biomarkers associated
  with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) treatment.
  (A) Methetrexate (MTX) is absorbed by reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) transporter,
  encoded by human solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1). Patients with RFC1-80AA
  genotype responded better to MTX than -80AG and -80GG individuals. ATP-binding cassette
  subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)-3435CT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may influence
  the MTX absorption and therapy response. MTX is converted into MTX-polyglutamates
  (MTX-PGs), which in turn inhibit folate pathway enzymes thymidilate synthase (TS),
  dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)
  and increase adenosine release. Individuals carrying -3R allele of the genetic variant
  in the enhancer region of thymidylate synthase (TYMS; thymidylate synthase enhancer
  region (TSER)), encoding TS (TYMS-TSER-2R/3R) have higher TYMS mRNA expression than
  those with -2R and require a higher MTX dosage. MTHFR -677CT and -A1298AC SNPs lead
  to lower MTHFR enzyme activity. Moreover, MTX response and toxicity may be affected
  by SNPs in genes involved in adenosine signaling (adenosine monophosphate deaminase
  1 (AMPD1)-34C>T, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/inosine
  monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC)-347C>G, inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase
  (ITPA)-94C>A). (B) Leflunomide (LEF) is converted into the active form, teriflunomide,
  mainly by CYP1A2. CC genotype of CYP1A2-164AC SNP is associated with increased LEF
  toxicity. Teriflunomide inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH; enzyme involved
  in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide
  gene enhancer in B cells inhibitor alpha (IκBα) degradation. DHODH-19CC patients
  respond better than -19AA. The efficacy of LEF is superior in patients with ESR1
  rs9340799 AA and ESR1 rs2234693 TT genotypes. (C) Polymorphisms in genes coding
  for N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2),
  involved, respectively, in drug metabolism and elimination, could influence response
  and safety of sulfasalazine. Patients carrying loss of function (LoF) allele A of
  the ABCG2 -421CA SNP respond better than carriers of LoF allele of NAT2-341TC, and
  -282CT is associated with high-risk toxicity. csDMARDs, conventional synthetic disease-modifying
