caption: 'Direct import of external N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) induces the signaling,
  but its metabolism is not required for GlcNAc signaling. Detection of external,
  non-phosphorylated GlcNAc provides sensitivity against internally synthesized GlcNAc-6-phosphate.
  (A) The internal de novo synthesized GlcNAc-6-P is utilized in the anabolic processes/functions,
  such as chitin synthesis, N-glycosylation, GPI-anchors, etc., and is not involved
  in the GlcNAc signaling pathway. De novo synthesis of GlcNAc-6-P involves sequential
  action of GlcN-6-P synthase (Gfa1) and GlcN-6-P acetyltransferase (Gna1) from fructose-6-P
  (Glycolysis). GlcNAc-6-P gets further converted to UDP-GlcNAc by the sequential
  action of phosphor acetylglucosamine mutase (Agm1) and UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase
  (Uap1) []. (B) The internalized GlcNAc through the GlcNAc specific transporter (Ngt1)
  can directly induce the signaling by binding to GlcNAc sensor (Ngs1). GlcNAc is
  also metabolized to GlcNAc-6-P by GlcNAc kinase (Hxk1), which is either catabolized
  using sequential action of Deacetylase (Dac1) and Deaminase (Nag1) to provide energy,
  or converted to UDP-GlcNAc involved in anabolic functions. The overlapping area
  between A and B represents the steps that are common to both the de novo pathway
  and imported GlcNAc pathway used for anabolic functions. Note: while steps involved
  in the anabolic pathways are represented with green arrows, the steps involved in
  the GlcNAc catabolic and GlcNAc signaling pathways are represented with blue and
  orange arrows, respectively.'
