caption: 'Oncogenic drivers in ALCL cells dirout intrinsic pathways leading to a self
  autonomous cell growth and overcoming host confinements; ALCL cells are also capable
  to modulate immunoresponsiveness changing the function of regulatory and effector
  T-cell through alternative mechanisms including antigen-camouflaging and producing
  lymphokines able to suppress immune-sorveillance (i.e. TNF/FasR, PD-L1/PD-L1R).
  Through cytoskeleton changes and production of pro-invasive mechanisms tumor cells
  have the ability to migrate locally and disseminate to distant organs. Moreover,
  production of pro-angiogenetic factors stimulates new vessels formation providing
  the necessary growth support for tumor survival. Many of these phenomena largely
  depend on the deregulated activation of multiple signalling pathway, and among them
  JAK-STAT represents a master culprit modulating gene-expression transcription (positive
  and negative regulation).Legend: CDC42, Cell division control protein 42 homolog,
