caption: Schematic description of EET-mediated perturbations in the Wnt1-NOV-PGC-1α-HO-1
  pathway in cardiac and adipose tissue of db/db mice. Obesity-mediated decrease in
  EET, HO-1, and PGC-1α promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and thermogenic genes that
  contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy. EET induction leads to a decrease
  in adipogenic FAS, MEST, and aP2 expression in adipose tissue. The EET-A-mediated
  stimulation of Wnt signaling causes a reduction in NOV and subsequent increases
  in PGC-1α and HO-1 that lead to increased V̇o2, increased mitochondrial integrity,
  thermogenic protein expression levels, and insulin sensitivity that, in concert,
  results in an improvement in cardiac function.
