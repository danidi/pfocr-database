caption: Shown is our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms by which agonists
  and antagonists can induce receptor internalization and down-regulation. Both agonists
  and antagonists internalize 5-HT2A receptors via the endosome-clathrin coated pit
  pathway. Whether arrestins are crucial scaffolds for internalization is cell-type
  specific. Once receptors are internalized they may be recycled to the cell surface
  or, following chronic drug exposure, degraded via lysosomes and, perhaps, other
  pathways (e.g. ubiquitination).
