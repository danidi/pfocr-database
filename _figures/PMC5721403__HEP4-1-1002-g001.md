caption: 'Targeting to bile acid and lipid metabolism in NASH treatment. Bile acids
  are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes. Cyp7a1 is the first and rate‐limiting
  enzyme in the classic bile acid synthesis pathway to synthesize CA and CDCA. Cyp8b1
  is required for synthesis of CA. Cyp27a1 is involved in steroid side‐chain oxidation.
  The alternative pathway is initiated by Cyp27a1, followed by Cyp7b1. Bile acids
  are conjugated to amino acids glycine and taurine for secretion into bile. In mice,
  CDCA is converted to α‐ and β‐muricholic acids. CDCA activates FXR to induce a negative
  factor, SHP, which inhibits Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 gene transcription. Bile acids are
  stored in the gallbladder and secreted into the gastrointestinal tract for nutrient
  absorption. In the intestine, conjugated bile acids are deconjugated by bacterial
  BSH and bacterial 7‐dehydroxylase activities convert CA and CDCA to DCA and LCA,
  respectively. In the ileum, FXR induces FGF15 (or human FGF19). Bile acids and FGF15/FGF19
  are secreted into portal blood for circulation to the liver. In hepatocytes, FGF15
  and FGF19 activate the FGF receptor 4/β‐Klotho complex to activate cJun/ERK1/2 of
  the MAPK pathway to inhibit Cyp7a1 gene transcription. Conjugated bile acid‐activated
  S1PR2 may also be involved in inhibiting Cyp7a1. In NAFLD and NASH, hepatic bile
  acid and lipid metabolisms are impaired to accumulate toxic bile acids and lipids
  along with cholestatic liver injury. Ceramides and diacylglycerols have been linked
  to insulin resistance in diabetes. FGF19 and M70 inhibit bile acid synthesis and
  reduce bile acid hydrophobicity. FGF19 and M70 stimulate fatty acid oxidation and
  inhibit fatty acid synthesis to reduce lipogenesis, ceramides, and diacylglycerol
  and to increase unoxidized‐cardiolipins in mitochondria; reduced ROS reduces inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines (CCl2, Ccr2, IL‐1β, Tnf‐α), fibrosis markers (Col1a1, Timp2),
  and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bad). In colon, activation of TGR5 stimulates cAMP and
  secretion of GLP‐1 to improve insulin sensitivity. Abbreviations: BSH, bile salt
