caption: MicroRNA biosynthesis pathway. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transcribed by RNA
  polymerase II (Pol II) activity to generate the primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs).
  miRNA production is a two-step process involving nuclear cropping and cytosolic
  dicing processes. First, pri-miRNA cleavage is mediated by a processing complex
  comprising the RNase III, Drosha, and DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8),
  which is also known as the microprocessor complex. This generates a hairpin-shaped
  pre-miRNA, which is recognized by nuclear exportin 5 and is exported to the cytoplasm
  where the RNase III, Dicer, cleaves pre-miRNA into 22-nucleotide miRNA duplexes.
  One strand from the cleavage products remains as a mature miRNA on the Argonaute
  (AGO) 1–4 proteins, whereas the other strand is degraded. Dicer, TAR RNA-binding
  protein (TRBP), protein kinase R-activating protein (PACT), and AGO 1–4 proteins
  mediate the assembly of the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex). Finally, miRNAs
  guide translational repression by base-pairing with their target mRNAs, while AGO
  proteins recruit factors that induce this translational repression.
