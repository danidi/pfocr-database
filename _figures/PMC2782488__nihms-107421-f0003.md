caption: The left side depicts IL-10 signaling in a macrophage activated by the TLR
  pathway (or other similar inflammatory stimuli). Socs3 expression is strongly induced
  by IL-10, along with the Stat3-dependent genes whose products regulate the anti-inflammatory
  signaling system (‘anti-inflammatory response’ AIR gene) illustrated as inhibiting
  the expression at the transcriptional level of classic pro-inflammatory genes. On
  the right side is shown IL-6 signaling via gp130, which also activates Socs3 and
  other genes. Unlike the IL-10R, the IL-6R cannot activate the expression of the
  AIR gene(s) unless Socs3 is absent. Thus, IL-6 and IL-10 (and any other receptors
  that activate Socs3 expression in macrophages) enforce the inability of the IL-6R
  to produce the anti-inflammatory response. Note that Socs3 (or any other Socs protein)
  does not inhibit the IL-10R.
