caption: 5-HT3R stimulation by the selective agonist 2-Me-5-HT causes an influx of
  extracellular Ca2+ through 5-HT3Rs/L-type Ca2+ ion channels which increases the
  free cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+, thereby promoting Ca2+ release via calcium-induced
  calcium release (CICR) from the endoplasmic reticulum stores through ryanodine receptors
  (RyRs). This elevation in cellular Ca2+ level initiates attachment of calmodulin
  (CaM) with the 5-HT3R, and leads to CaMKIIα activation and subsequent ERK1/2 signaling.
  The 5-HT3R antagonist palonosetron(1), the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker amlodipine(2),
  the RyR blocker dantrolene(3), the CaMKII inhibitor KN93(4), and the ERK inhibitor
  PD98059(5), respectively exhibit anti-emetic efficacy against 2-Me-5-HT-induced
  vomiting. These findings demonstrate that the 2-Me-5-HT-induced emesis is regulated
  by 5-HT3R-mediated Ca2+/CaMKII-dependent ERK signaling pathway.
