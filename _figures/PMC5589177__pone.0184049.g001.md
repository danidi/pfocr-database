caption: Three HIF prolyl-4-hydroxylases (PHDs) and one HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase
  (factor inhibiting HIF; FIH) act as oxygen (O2) sensors by regulating the hydroxylation
  of HIF-α, which controls the stability and transcriptional activity of the HIF system.
  In this schematic, under Normoxia hydroxylases utilize oxygen as a co-substrate
  to catalyzing hydroxylation of a specific proline (P via PHDs) and a specific asparaginyl
  (N; via FIH) amino acid residues on HIF-α. Proline hydroxylation by PHD marks HIF
  for degradation (i.e., specifically ubiquitination (UB) occurs by VHLE3 ubiquitin
  ligase (VHL) binding and then rapid degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway
  occurs). Hydroxylation at a conserved asparaginyl residue in the HIF-α carboxy-terminal
  activation domain also blocks interaction with the CBP/p300 transcriptional co-activator
  required for binding to HIF-α and to DNA. Thus, in normoxia HIF-α is degraded and
  “Transcriptional Repression” of the HIF system occurs. Under Hypoxia PHDs and FIH
  are inhibited. Without the binding of VHL to non-hydroxylated HIF-α, HIF-α is not
  degraded. The coactivator CBP/p300 does bind to non-hydroxylated HIF-α that then
  binds to HIF-β and then to DNA resulting in HIF system “Transcriptional Activation”,
  which further up-regulates the expression of a large array of target genes. These
  increased target genes increase protein expressions and cellular processes that
  result in red blood cell production (e.g., erythropoietin; EPO), angiogenesis (e.g.,
  vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF), free radical scavenging and stem cell
  homing and differentiation. GSK360A mimics hypoxia by inhibiting PHDs and producing
  HIF transcriptional activation and the upregulation of EPO and VEGF target genes
  and EPO and VEGF protein synthesis. This schematic was modified from Schofield and
  Ratcliffe, 2004 [].
