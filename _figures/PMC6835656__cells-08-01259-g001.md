caption: 'A simplified diagram of estrogen signaling pathways, including genomic (canonical)
  and nongenomic (non-canonical) pathway. The intercellular effects of estrogen are
  mediated by two main pathways: genomic (canonical) and nongenomic (non-canonical).
  In the genomic pathway (A), estrogens (blue colored) bind and activate two nuclear
  receptor isotypes, estrogen receptor α (ERα, colored with yellow) and estrogen receptor
  β (ERβ, colored with green). Binding of estrogen with ERs in the cytoplasm induces
  homo- or heterodimerization of ERs, and the complex of estrogen and ERs translocate
  to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences, known as estrogen response
  elements (EREs), and regulates the transcription of target genes, such as ATP binding
  cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3) and growth regulation by estrogen in breast
  cancer 1 (GREB1). In the nongenomic pathway (B), estrogens activate several signaling
  pathways without direct interaction with DNA. Estrogen rapidly increases the level
  of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by activating adenylyl cyclase and mediates
  intracellular signaling transduction, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Estrogens also bind to G-protein
  coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) at the plasma membrane and mediate the activity
  of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk).'
