caption: SSADH is a part of the GABA degradation pathway. Following the breakdown
  of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) to SSA (succinic semialdehyde), further degradation
  is mediated by SSADH (succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase; ALDH5A1) which provides
  succinate to the Krebs cycle. In addition, SSA may be converted into GHB (γ-hydroxybutyrate)
  by an aldo-keto reductase. Genetic block of SSADH leads to accumulation of GABA
  and GHB. GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase); GABA-T (GABA transaminase); SSAR (succinic
  semialdehyde reductase); GHBDH (GHB dehydrogenase)
