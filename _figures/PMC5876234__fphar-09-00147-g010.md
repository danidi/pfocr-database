caption: Lico A-mediated Nrf2 signaling pathway protects APAP-induced ALF via inhibition
  of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Licochalcone A (Lico A) can induce the
  Nrf2 activation, which contribute to up-regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway resulting
  in expression of abundant antioxidant genes. Furthermore, Lico A effectively reduced
  APAP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by the inhibition of Bax mitochondrial
  translocation, AIF and cytochrome c release, and cleaved-caspase-3 formation, which
  were obviously abrogated in Nrf2-/- mice.
