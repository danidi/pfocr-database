caption: Immune cell subsets promote stemness properties in CSCs. IL-6 secreted by
  TAMs can convert non-stem cancer cells into CSCs and foster their drug resistance.
  The secretion of TGF-β by M2 macrophages can support the EMT process and the acquisition
  of stem-cell properties. M2 macrophages also produce VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis
  and the tumorigenicity of CSCs. Furthermore, the secretion of pleiotrophin by TAMs
  supports the CSC-driven tumor growth through activation of the Akt pathway. Besides
  soluble molecules, macrophages can interact with CSCs via CD90 and EphA4 in a cell-cell-contact-dependent
  manner, inducing the production of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF. MDSCs can facilitate
  the expression of microRNA101 in CSCs, which increases their tumorigenicity and
  metastatic potential. The secretion of NO and IL-6 by MDSCs leads to a STAT3-dependent
  increase of the stemness properties of CSCs. Furthermore, Tregs can enhance the
  expression of genes, which are associated with CSCs and secrete TGF-β, which promotes
  the EMT and dedifferentiation of cancer cells. Moreover, Th17 cells contribute to
  the formation of CSCs by secretion of IL-17. Low IFN-γ levels produced by Th1 cells
  and CD8+ T cells enhance the stemness of tumor cells by activation of the Akt pathway.
  Non-lytic interactions of CD8+ T cells further promote this process by inducing
  the expression of genes that are associated with cancer cell dedifferentiation.
