caption: Activation of p53 on Akt/PI3 kinase may be critical downstream of PGP9.5,
  which affects tumorigenesis. Our hypothesis is based on the notion that p53 might
  be a direct or indirect substrate of PGP9.5, and it is consistent with the previous
  report that p53 protein level was associated with PGP9.5 protein level in a stress-induced
  states of p53 wild type myeloma cells KMS27. PI3 kinase/Akt could be regulated by
  PTEN-dependent or PTEN-independent inhibition by p53,, which may in turn be regulated
  by PGP9.5. That is why PGP9.5 induced growth suppression of p53 wild type cells
  (011 and 022), and the PI3 kinase pathway is constantly activated irrespective of
  PTEN or other mechanism in p53 mutant cells (013 and 019).
