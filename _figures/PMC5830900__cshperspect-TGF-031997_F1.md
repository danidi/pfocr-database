caption: Role of the TGF-β family in mammary gland development and maturation. (A)
  Morphogenesis of a ductal tree in the mammary gland proceeds with epithelial cell
  proliferation, which is inhibited by TGF-β1, TGF-β3, and activins (TGF-β2 is not
  well-expressed during breast morphogenesis), by blocking hepatocyte growth factor
  (HGF), growth hormone (GH), estrogen (ES), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
  expression and activities. TGF-β1, TGF-β3, and activins also block differentiation
  in ductal trees by inhibiting the actions of progesterone and prolactin, thus repressing
  colostrum production. These TGF-β members induce apoptosis during involution by
  inhibiting the survival signals provided by progesterone and prolactin. (B) Bone
  morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play an opposite role to TGF-β by promoting mammary
  epithelial cell proliferation through induction of HGF, GH, ES, and IGF-1 expression.
  BMPs also promote lactation by inducing progesterone and prolactin expression and
  signaling, which lead to terminal differentiation. The role of BMPs during involution
  is unclear. (C) More detailed TGF-β signaling that promotes some of the biological
  effects shown in panel A. TGF-β induces Smad signaling, which represses SnoN expression
  and, in turn, promotes signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)
  activation. STAT5 is also activated by prolactin signaling and triggers expression
  of SnoN, cyclin D1 (CycD1), and β-casein. SnoN opposes the action of TGF-β signaling.
  CycD1 promotes the cell cycle and controls morphogenesis, and β-casein is an important
  milk protein expressed at terminal differentiation during lactation. (D) More detailed
  BMP signaling pathway that mediates some biological effects shown in panel B. BMP-4
  activates BMPRIA signaling, and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) induces
  expression of this BMP receptor, resulting in Smad signaling, which induces expression
  of the transcriptional regulator Msx2. BMP signaling also induces β-casein expression,
  marking terminal differentiation during the lactation phase.
