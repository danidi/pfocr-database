caption: Enzalutamide metabolism. The proposed pathway to form N-desmethyl enzalutamide
  is via M6 and M1 through CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolism. N-desmethyl enzalutamide
  is metabolized by carboxylesterase 1 to the carboxyl metabolite; no CYP enzymes
  involvement in further metabolism were identified. CYP cytochrome P450
