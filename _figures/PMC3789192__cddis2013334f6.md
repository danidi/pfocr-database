caption: Proposed model for the role of TLR4 signaling pathway in GC cell proliferation.
  A drawing depicts the hypothetical role of TLR4 signaling in GC cell proliferation.
  We hypothesize that increased ROS generation, resulting from the activation of TLR4
  signaling, mediates the activation of phosphorylated Akt, and then induces NF-κB
  p65 nuclear translocation, which leads to GC cell proliferation
