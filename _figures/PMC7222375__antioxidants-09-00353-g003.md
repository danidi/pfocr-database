caption: Schematic diagram of the main cell signaling pathway involved in red cell
  homeostasis. (a) Under steady state conditions, Lyn and Syk are inactive. Cellular
  stress such as physiologic oxidation related to aging or osmotic stress triggers
  Lyn–Syk sequential activation, resulting in increased tyrosine (Tyr) band 3 (B3)
  phosphorylation (PY). This modulates B3 interaction with neighboring proteins such
  as band 4.1, band 4.2, or adducin or ankyrin. These multiprotein complexes bridging
  the membrane to the cytoskeleton contribute to membrane mechanical instability.
  Red cells from patients with chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) loose the canonical Lyn–Syk
  signaling pathway targeting B3, resulting in membrane–cytoskeleton network instability.
  (b) Red cells from patients with either G6PD deficiency exposed to oxidation or
  β-thalassemia are characterized by severe oxidation. This results in membrane damage
  and abnormal activation of Syk independently from the canonical Syk–Lyn pathway.
  The damaged, over-Tyr phosphorylated B3 forms clusters, which favor erythroid vesicle
  release and the fast removal of the damaged red cells by splenic macrophages.
