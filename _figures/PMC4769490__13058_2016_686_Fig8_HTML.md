caption: 'Summary: Mcl-1 confers protection of Her2-positive BC cells to hypoxia—therapeutic
  implications. Homodimerization of Her2 with Her2 or heterodimerization of Her2 with
  Her3 enhances phospho-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and RAS/mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathways, which regulate BC cell proliferation, survival, and migration,
  as well as angiogenesis [, ]. The Her2 inhibitor trastuzumab [] binds to the C-terminal
  portion of Her2. Another Her2 inhibitor, lapatinib [], binds to the ATP binding
  site of Her2, but also Her1. Similar to siHER2, trastuzumab and lapatinib inhibit
  downstream signaling events, induce apoptosis, and inhibit proliferation of BC cells
  (red lines). Here we show a novel role for the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member
  Mcl-1 in Her2-positive BC cell adaptation to hypoxia. Specifically, our results
  show that Mcl-1 forms a protein complex with Her2 at the mitochondrial membrane
  and stabilizes Her2 by inhibiting its ubiquitination. Conversely, genetically (siMCL1)
  or pharmacologically (EU-5346) targeting Mcl-1 triggers ubiquitination and proteosomal
  degradation of Her2, thereby inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting proliferation and
  spheroid formation under hypoxic conditions. In addition, our results indicate the
  existence of a Mcl-1-dependent survival pathway in Her2-positive BC cells, which
  is independent of the Mcl-1–Her2 axis supporting the therapeutic benefit of combining
  Her2 (red lines) and Mcl-1 inhibitor (blue lines). Importantly, based on these findings,
  targeting Mcl-1 is also active in Her2-positive BC cells resistant to Her2 inhibitors,
  including a brain-primed Her2-positive cell line. Her human epidermal growth factor
