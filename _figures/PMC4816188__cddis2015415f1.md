caption: The TP53 pathway in CLL. The level of TP53 protein is downregulated via binding
  of proteins, such as, MDM2 that promote TP53 degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome
  pathway. As MDM2 is upregulated by TP53, this leads to a regulation loop, which
  maintains a very low level of TP53 protein in normal cells. This function also requires
  MDMX, which binds both MDM2 and TP53. Disruption of this equilibrium leading to
  TP53 accumulation is the main outcome of the upstream pathways to promote a TP53
  biological response. In CLL, two pathways associated with DNA damage (double-strand
  breaks or telomere uncapping) are clearly impaired. Genes depicted in red are impaired
  in CLL. Whether or not trisomy 12 can alter the TP53 pathway by increasing mdm2
  activity is controversial. The links between BIRC3 and the TP53 pathway remain elusive
