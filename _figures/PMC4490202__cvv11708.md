caption: Proposed signalling pathway linking impaired nitric oxide bioavailability
  to PDE3 function. In healthy lymphatic endothelium (A), basal nitric oxide production
  leads to cGMP production that then inhibits PDE3 (also known as the cGMP-inhibited
  PDE). In combination, basal levels of cAMP and cGMP lead to a low basal permeability
  of ∼2 × 10−7 cm/s. In type II diabetes (B), lymphatic endothelium loses its ability
  to produce nitric oxide and, as a result, cGMP levels fall. This relieves the inhibition
  of PDE3 (dashed line). At the same time, high insulin and leptin concentrations
  are known to phosphorylate and activate PDE3. PDE3 then hydrolyzes intracellular
  cAMP, which normally maintains a low permeability, leading to loss of endothelial
  barrier function.
