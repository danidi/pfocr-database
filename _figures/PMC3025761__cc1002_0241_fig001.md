caption: Schematic illustration of the various steps involved in the ubiquitin proteasome
  pathway and general architecture of the cullin 1 (CRL1) and cullin 4 (CRL4)-based
  E3 ubiquitin ligases. (A) Ubiquitin molecules (red circles) are covalently attached
  to the substrate in three consecutive steps. The last step of the reaction is mediated
  by the specific recognition of the substrate (light magenta), often tagged with
  a degradation signal, by an E3 ubiquitin ligase (blue) and the transfer of ubiquitin
  from the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (blue) to the substrate. In many cases
  the degradation signal results in the phosphorylation of the substrate at a specific
  residues(s). Also shown in blue, is the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme involved
  in charging ubiquitin in the first step of the reaction. The polyubiquitylated protein
  substrate is directed to the 26S proteasome (light green) where it is degraded proteolytically.
  (B and C) The scaffold cullin 1 and cullin 4 (cullin 4A or cullin 4B) proteins (light
  blue) in complex with Rbx1 or Rbx2 small ring finger proteins (purple) form the
  catalytic core of CRL1 (also known as SCF) and CRL4 respectively. Rbx1/2 proteins
  recruit the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (beige) to mediate the covalent attachment
  of ubiquitin (red) to the substrate (light green). Skp1 and Ddb1 (damage-specific
  DNA binding protein 1) (orange) are adaptor proteins for CRL1 and CRL4 respectively
  and function to bridge the cullin proteins with a number of substrate recognition
  factors (SRFs) (brown). For Ddb1, one β-propeller domain (BPB) interacts with cullin
  4, whereas the two other β-propeller domains (BPA and BPC) make contacts with the
  SRFs. For CRL1, the SRF are collectively termed F-box proteins because they invariably
  contain the conserved F-box motif, whereas for CRL4 ubiquitin ligases, SRFs are
  collectively termed DCAFs (Ddb1 and cullin 4-associated factors). (C) A schematic
  of the CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase showing the DCAF Cdt2 (brown) and its ability to recognize
  substrates only when they are bound to the trimeric PCNA ring (red) encircling DNA
  (blue helix).
