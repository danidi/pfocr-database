caption: 'Schematic representation of selected polyphenols that interfere with p27
  expression and activity (see  and text for details). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate
  (EGCG) increases the expression of p27, acting at multiple levels: stimulating the
  activity of its transcription factors (TFs, mainly FoxO) or inhibiting its proteasomal
  degradation. Resveratrol inhibits the pathway (PI3K/AKT) that negatively regulates
  the transcription of the CDK1B gene. Tannins also act by directly binding and inhibiting
  the proteasome-dependent degradation of p27. Acteoside increases CDK1B mRNA synthesis
  and favors the binding of p27 to CDK4/6, contributing to the reduction of their
  kinase activity. The increased expression of p27 potentiates its inhibitory effect
  on cell cycle progression, blocking malignant cells at the G1/S transition. Dashed
  red and green arrows indicate inhibition and activation, respectively, mediated
  by “indirect” interactions between the indicated polyphenols and p27-regulating
  factors.'
