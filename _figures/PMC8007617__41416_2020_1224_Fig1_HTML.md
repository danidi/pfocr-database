caption: Cancer cells frequently demonstrate increased levels of glycolysis including
  conversion of glucose into pyruvate and subsequently into lactate (the Warburg effect).
  Consequently, increased import of glucose into tumour cells is maintained by increased
  expression of glucose transporters (GLUT). The intravenously injected positron emission
  tomography (PET) tracer [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) is similarly
  taken up via the same transporter and also undergoes subsequent phosphorylation
  catalysed by hexokinase; this phosphorylation prevents its subsequent export from
  the cell. Hyperpolarised [1-13C]pyruvate can be used to image metabolic alterations
  further down the glycolytic pathway. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) mediate
  its uptake into cancer cells, where it undergoes reduction to [1-13C]lactate catalysed
  by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), transamination to [1-13C]alanine by alanine-aminotransferase
  (ALT), or irreversible oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl Co-A, a reaction catalysed
  by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). During the latter oxidation, the hyperpolarised
  13C-label is transferred from the carboxyl (C1) position of pyruvate to 13CO2 and
  is detectable on spectroscopic imaging as bicarbonate (H13CO3−). An alternative
  fate of [1-13C]pyruvate is carboxylation via pyruvate carboxylase (PC) to [1-13C]oxaloacetic
  acid, which can then be metabolised to [1-13C]malate. Any fumarate that is formed
  through the reverse fumarase reaction is symmetrical and therefore any subsequent
  forward exchange via fumarase results in the production of four-carbon intermediates
  with the 13C-labelling also present at C4 ([4-13C]malate and [4-13C]oxalacetic acid).
  The metabolites of this pathway have been detected using hyperpolarised 13C-MRI
  in preclinical liver studies;, increased conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetic
  acid has been demonstrated in lung and breast cancer using non-imaging studies,
  which raises important applications for detecting this reaction more generally within
  tumours. However, none of these four-carbon intermediates have been detected in
  cancer using clinical hyperpolarised 13C-MRI. The 13C-label in the C1 position is
  shown as yellow circles and in the C4 position as red circles. For clarity, enzymatic
  cofactors and some of the additional substrates and products have been omitted.
  Other metabolic alterations relevant for cancer imaging are accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate
  (2HG) due to mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  and accumulation of succinate due to succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency.
