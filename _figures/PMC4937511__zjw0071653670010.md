caption: 'Three pathways identified as altered based on the 12 SCI biomarker candidate
  proteins as input. Based on 1 Biology pathway analysis, (), three pathways were
  found to have the most interactions between these 12 candidate biomarkers: A, Cell
  growth and Aging; B, Metabolic Dysfunction; and C, Neural Death. Original SCI biomarkers
  are in red ovals with blue aura. Additional interacting partner proteins are in
  red ovals. Cell processes are in blue rectangles, disease pathway in purple rectangles,
  while regulation are annotated by gray arrows.'
