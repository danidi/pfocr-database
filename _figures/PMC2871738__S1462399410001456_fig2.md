caption: 'Molecular determinants of mitochondrial quality-control networks.               Mitochondria
  are dynamic organelles that are continuously remodelled by fusion and               fission
  events. Fusion requires the joining of both the inner and outer mitochondrial               membranes
  of two mitochondria. Mitofusin 1 (MFN1) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) carry out the               initial
  joining of the outer membrane fusion, whereas OPA1 mediates the fusion of the               inner
  membrane. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by DRP1 and FIS1; DRP1 oligomerizes               into
  8–12 subunit chains and is recruited to mitochondria via the adaptor               FIS1.
  This recruitment allows the full oligomerisation of DRP1 into spiral chains that               wrap
  around the mitochondria and, by constriction, causes mitochondrial fission. In               this
  figure, fission is shown as a means to selectively eliminate damaged               mitochondrial
  components by packing them in one of the fission products, and it has               been
  proposed to involve the asymmetrical segregation of OPA1 (Ref. ). In this context,
  fission produces               metabolically different daughter units that may either
  maintain (red) or lose (grey)               an intact membrane potential. Depolarised
  mitochondria are targeted to degradation by               autophagy (mitophagy)
  through a mechanism that is still poorly defined. Here, we               illustrate
  two possibilities: (1) the presence of proteins associated with               mitochondrial
  membranes, such as the mammalian BNIP3L/NIX (Ref. , ), and the               yeast
  proteins Uth1p (Ref. ) and Aup1               (Ref. ), which are involved in the
  direct               entrapment of mitochondria by autophagosomes; (2) the activity
  of E3 ligases, such as               LISTERIN (Ref. ), MULAN (Ref. ) and Parkin
  (Refs , ), which might               regulate the conjugation of monoubiquitin (Ub)
  or polyubiquitin chains to an exposed               mitochondrial protein, thereby
  targeting the organelle to autophagic degradation. p62               and NBR1 are
  autophagic receptors that bind both Ub and ATG8/LC3 on the phagophore               (Ref.
  ), which might constitute the               mechanistic link between mitochondrial
  ubiquitylation and mitophagy. The mTOR               signalling pathway acts as
  a major positive modulator of mitochondrial metabolism and               biogenesis.
  We propose that the inhibition of mTORC1 upon mitochondrial damage caused               by
  loss of ATP and consequential activation of AMPK, might be crucial to ensure an               enhancement
  of the autophagic degradation of defective mitochondria. Abbreviations:               AMPK,
