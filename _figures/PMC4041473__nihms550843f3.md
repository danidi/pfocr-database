caption: Metabolic activation is considered to be a critical step for styrene-induced
  pulmonary toxicity. The main pathway to metabolize styrene is the epoxidation of
  the vinyl group to styrene-7,8-oxide (styrene oxide, SO, 2, ) catalyzed by cytochromes
  P450. The resulting styrene oxide is further hydrated to styrene glycol (SG, 3)
  or conjugated with glutathione to glutathione conjugates., Styrene oxide is both
  mutagenic and carcinogenic., It is thought to be one of the major toxic styrene
  metabolites. Aromatic hydroxylation is another metabolism pathway of styrene, which
  leads to the formation of 2-vinylphenol (2-VP, 4), 3-vinylphenol (3-VP, 5), and
  4-vinylphenol (4-VP, 6) (). Metabolic hydroxylation of styrene to 4-VP has been
  well studied in vitro and in vivo.,– Recently, Linhart et al. and our group characterized
  2-VP and 3-VP as styrene metabolites in mice., We found 2-VP was the major isomer
  among the VP metabolites detected in mouse liver and lung microsomes. 4-VP has been
  reported more toxic than SO,, and our earlier study also showed that 4-VP was more
  toxic than 2-VP and 3-VP in mice. The VPs were further metabolized to the corresponding
  hydroxystyrene oxides, vinylcatechols, and/or vinylhydroquinone in mouse microsomes,
  but whether these metabolites cause cytotoxicity remains unclear.
