number: Figure 1
caption: 'Cellular toxicity induced by nanoparticles (NPs). Exposure to NPs potentially
  leads to toxic side effects such as enhanced ROS generation, disruption of redox
  homeostasis, lipid peroxidation, impaired mitochondrial function, and membrane damage.
  Upward arrows indicate increased and downward arrows indicate decreased protein
  abundance in response to NPs stress, respectively. Dotted arrow represents shikimate
  pathway, a common biosynthetic route for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.
  Abbreviations: APX, ascorbate peroxidase; AsA, reduced ascorbate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate;

  peroxide; MDA, malondialdehyde; MDAR, monodehydroascorbate reductase; PS, photosystem;
