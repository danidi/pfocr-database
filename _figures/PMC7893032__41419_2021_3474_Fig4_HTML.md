caption: HNSCC cells undergo numerous metabolic changes including increased glutaminolysis.
  Glutaminolysis produces large pools of intracellular glutamate. Upregulation of
  the cystine/glutamate antiporter ((Xc–) system) and excitatory amino acid transporter
  (SLC1A3) promotes aberrant glutamate (Glu) release from cancer cells. Increased
  stiffness of extracellular matrix during tumour progression induces cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) to import glutamate (through SLC1A3) and release aspartate (Asp)
  and glutamine (Gln) supporting cancer cell purine/pyrimidine synthesis. Glutamine
  synthetase (GS) is often overexpressed in these CAFs. CAFs can also promote chemoresistance
  through the production of glutathione (GSH). Establishing of this metabolic symbiosis
  is coordinated by a YAP/TAZ-dependent mechanotransduction pathway. Green bubbles
  indicate activation and pink inhibition of the process.
