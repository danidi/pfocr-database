caption: NSE activates AMPK in the liver and muscles to improve glucose metabolism.
  NSE mediates its action by stimulating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), an enzyme essential. It also reduces the enzymatic pathway involved
  in increasing fatty acid production by the liver (ACC = acteyl-CoA carboxylase);
  thus, it increases the sensitivity to insulin. The activation of AMPK can inhibit
  the pathway of gluconeogenesis in the liver. In the muscle, NSE activates AMPK towards
  allowing the increased synthesis and translocation of Glut4 and consequently increases
  glucose transport in muscle. NSE also acts on the pancreas by increasing the secretion
  of insulin.
