caption: Network related to lipid metabolism in islets cultured at 23 mM glucose concentration.
  For the explanation of the symbols and letters, see the legend to Figure . A total
  of 19 differentially expressed focus genes were brought into this network with a
  highly significantly score of 22. The node Srebf1 was identified by the pathway
  analysis as part of the network, and its differential gene expression was determined
  subsequently by qRT-PCR. The node Ywhaz was tested for being included in the pathway,
  but it was not Pioglitazone dependent.
