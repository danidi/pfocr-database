caption: 'Effects of conventional and arrestin pathway-selective biased PTH1R agonists
  on bone metabolism. Stimulation of the PTH1R results in the activation of two distinct
  signalling pathways: one G-protein-mediated and the other β-arrestin-mediated. Concomitantly,
  β-arrestins also desensitize the G-protein-activated response. The binding of the
  conventional PTH1R agonist, PTH(1–34) results in the activation of G-protein- and
  β-arrestin-dependent signalling, whereas PTH-βarr activates only the β-arrestin-dependent
  pathway. PTH-βarr stimulates anabolic bone formation through a β-arrestin-dependent
  mechanism independent of G-protein activation. Summarized are the effects of PTH(1–34)
  and PTH-βarr on markers of osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated
  bone resorption.'
