caption: A simplified display of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. (A) In the absence
  of Hedgehog ligand, full-length Gli is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, glycogen
  synthase kinase-3, and casein kinase 1. This leads to proteolytic cleavage of the
  full-length Gli into Gli repressor. Gli repressor represses the expression of target
  genes, (B) after binding of Hedgehog ligand, Smoothened protein is phosphorylated
  by protein kinase A and casein kinase 1. The inhibitory effect of Sufu is removed
  and Gli activator is formed. Gli activator induces the transcription of target genes.
  Red symbols represent the inhibitory effect, and green arrows show the activating
  effect. Hh - Hedgehog; Ptch - Patched; Smo - Smoothened; Gli - glioma-associated
  oncogene; GliFL - full-length Gli; GliA - Gli activator; GliR - Gli repressor; CK1
  - casein kinase 1; PKA - protein kinase A; GSK3 - glycogen synthase kinase-3.
