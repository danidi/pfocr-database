caption: 'The reciprocal regulation of autophagy between cancer cells and cancer‐associated
  fibroblastsNote: The cytokine‐mediated cross‐talk and the exchange of metabolites
  between cancer cells and CAFs reciprocally regulate the actual level of autophagy
  in the cells. Cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia released by
  cancer cells as well as hypoxia (which triggers the HIF1α pathway) and lack of nutrients
  in the tumor microenvironment induce autophagy in CAFs, which leads to loss of mitochondria
  (mitophagy) and of Caveolin 1. The latter events favor glycolysis. Because of increased
  autophagy and glycolysis in CAFs, metabolites (including glutamine), lactic acid,
  and ketones are supplied to cancer cells. As a result, in these cells autophagy
  is downregulated, while anabolism is stimulated, with consequent growth of cancer.'
