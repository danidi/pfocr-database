caption: A proposed model of action for demonstrating regulatory function of PbrWRKY53
  in response to drought stress. The ABA signalling pathway is triggered by drought
  stress, leading to enhancing the expression levels of PbrWRKY53, which in turn regulates
  PbrNCED1 through binding to W‐box element in its promoter. Up‐regulation of the
  PbrWRKY53‐PbrNCED1 module promotes AsA synthesis and ROS scavenging, allowing the
  drought‐associated damage to be alleviated by maintaining ROS homeostasis and adjustment
  of stomatal aperture.

  in drought tolerance and AsA accumulation.
