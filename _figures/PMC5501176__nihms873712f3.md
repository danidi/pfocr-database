caption: 'Roles of SIRT1 signaling pathway in cancer in type 2 diabetes. SIRT1 signaling
  pathway is an important energy sensing pathway bridging energy metabolism to DNA
  stability. In type 2 diabetes, the high level of glucose and FFA will reduce the
  level of NAD+/NADH, which then decrease SIRT1 activity. The decreased SIRT1 activity
  loses its stimulation of fatty acid metabolism and its ability to maintain genomic
  stability, as well as its inhibition of inflammation and angiogenesis. All of those
  alterations may initiate the formation and growth of cancer cell. FFA: free fatty
  acid; PRKA: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin;
