caption: Functional gene regulatory modules during early flower development.Common
  molecular modules act during early meristem morphogenesis from the SAM both before
  and after reproduction. During floral organogenesis, these modules interact among
  themselves and with the FOS-GRN that includes the floral homeotic genes. Anlagen
  positioning in the SAM flanks depends on auxin gradients. Transport and signal transduction
  proteins, as well as other factors regulated by auxins (letters in blue), participate
  in the establishment of such gradients and finally determining the position of primordia.
  The auxin pathway also downregulates some members of the NAC family (CUC1 to 3 are
  important for organ boundary establishment), which also participate in the positive
  regulation of STM and KNOX genes. Since WUS maintains the apical meristem stem cells
  in a proliferating state with CLV proteins that in turn regulate its expression
  in a non cell-autonomous negative-positive feedback loop, and STM prevents meristem
  cell differentiation by inducing the production of cytokinins (CK) and the ARR transduction
  pathway (see text), floral primordia may emerge if cells in the anlagen are able
  to downregulate STM. This can be achieved by the action of AS1 and ANT. Upregulation
  of LFY by the flowering genes (Section 3.2; ) in conjunction with some KAN and YAB
  proteins, activate the expression of ABC homeotic genes (in red) for the establishment
  of the floral organ primordia identity and growth (gene acronyms in black, see text
  and Table S1 for full names). Lateral organ primordia acquire apical/basal, lateral/medial
  and adaxial/abaxial polarities by the action of protein families that include PHABs
  (PHB, PHV and REV), KANs (KANADI1–3, ATS/KAN4), YABs (FIL/YAB1, YAB2, YAB3, INO/YAB4,
  YAB5 and CRC/YAB6), JAG and NUB (letters in green). Some of these are organ-specific
  while others are shared by different floral organ primordia (see ). Not all the
  genes involved in each module are depicted, just some of the most representative
  ones, which help us to understand how they are interconnected. Arrows and bars indicate
  positive and negative regulatory interactions, respectively, and dashed lines a
  postulated interaction not yet proven. The text color used for the gene names in
  each module is the same as in , , and  where specific organ developmental processes
  are summarized and the ABC genes are shown in boxes on the organ specified as in
  the model shown below. Hormones are in purple.This figure was composed partially
