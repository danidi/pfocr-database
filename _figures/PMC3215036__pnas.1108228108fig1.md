caption: Pathways and genes of modified tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. (A) Outline syntheses
  of modified tetrapyrroles highlighting key intermediates along the branched pathway.
  Known reaction sequences are shown in black whereas those not yet elucidated are
  highlighted in magenta. (B) The known transformation of uroporphyrinogen III into
  siroheme and heme is shown. The numbering system for the tetrapyrrole macrocycle
  is highlighted on uroporphyrinogen III. (C) Precorrin-2 as the template for both
  d1 heme and heme synthesis is shown, with the latter derived via the alternative
  heme pathway. In both cases the two methyl groups at C2 and C7, highlighted in red,
  are derived from AdoMet. The enzymes involved in the transformation of precorrin-2
  into d1 heme (Nir enzymes) and heme (Ahb enzymes) are shown. (D) The similarity
  between some of the Nir proteins implicated in d1synthesis and proteins found in
  sulfate-reducing bacteria and Archaea thought to be associated with the Ahb pathway
  are indicated by black arrows.
