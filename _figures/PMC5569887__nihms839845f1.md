caption: Mechanisms of action of PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathway inhibitors. Immune checkpoints
  operate at multiple points in the activation of specific anti-tumor responses to
  downregulate the immune response. Shown here for illustration are PD-1 and CTLA-4.
  PD-1 is important both in lymph organs and in the tumor environment for inhibiting
  the effector response to tumor cells, whereas CTLA-4, expressed on the surface of
  APCs, inhibits the activation of T-cell responses. In reality, immune checkpoints
  operate at multiple levels and it is likely a balance of inhibitory and activating
  signals that modulates the strength of the immune response.
