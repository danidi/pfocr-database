caption: (A) Host and virus control of immediate early (IE) gene expression. pUL38
  and pUL29/28 interact with the HDAC1-NuRD complex to help induce expression of IE
  genes from the MIEP. pUL97 phosphorylates HDAC1 and inhibits its deacetylase activity,
  promoting viral gene expression by potentially de-stabilizing HDAC1 association
  with the NuRD complex. The DNA sensor IFI16 binds the HCMV genome to induce antiviral
  cytokine production. pUL83 interacts with IFI16 to restrict its oligomerization
  and cytokine production. Additionally, IFI16 is repurposed to activate the MIEP.
  (B) Protein complexes involved in HCMV genome replication. pUL84 is part of the
  HCMV DNA replication machinery, interacting with oriLyt and host and viral proteins.
  To function within the replication complex, pUL84 has to be phosphorylated (P) by
  CKII. pUL84 also interacts with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 and becomes
  mono ubiquitinated (Ub). The DNA processivity factor, pUL44, is thought to be a
  part of multiple protein complexes and is important for efficient DNA replication.
  (C) Viral modulation of cellular stress response through TSC1/2. pUL38 interacts
  with TSC1/2 to block its activity and maintain an active mTOR pathway following
  infection. (D) Control of cell cycle progression and induction of the DNA damage
  response. pUL21a interacts with APC members, leading to their degradation, reduced
  APC activity, and dysregulation of the cell cycle. pUL27 interacts with Tip60, targeting
  this protein for degradation and contributing to cell-cycle arrest. pUL35 interacts
  with subunits of the Cul4 ubiquitin ligase complex, causing cell cycle arrest and
  induction of DNA damage response.
