caption: 'Physiological activators of AMPK in ECs include hypoxia/ischemia, shear
  stress, adiponectin, thrombin, bradykinin and VEGF (synthesis of which is stimulated
  by AMPK in other tissues). AMPK is reported to stimulate VSMC relaxation through:
  (i) increased NO synthesis and possibly endothelium-dependent hypopolarising factor
  (EDHF); (ii) inhibition of MYPT1/MLC phosphorylation and Ca2+ levels in VSMCs, reported
  to be mediated by reduced RhoA activity and increased sarco/endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase
  (SERCA) activity respectively. AMPK activation in ECs stimulates proliferation and
  migration, whereas in VSMCs, proliferation and migration are inhibited, associated
  with p53 phosphorylation, Rb dephosphorylation and p27(Kip1) stabilisation. AMPK
  also inhibits VSMC calcification by reducing Runx2 and pro-inflammatory signalling
  pathways leading to leukocyte adhesion and cytokine/chemokine synthesis.'
