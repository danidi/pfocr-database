caption: a The subcellular localization of the three isocitrate dehydrogenase isoforms
  and their roles in normal cellular metabolism. IDH isocitrate dehydrogenase, 1 pyruvate
  dehydrogenase, 2 citrate synthase, 3 mitochondrial aconitase, 4 2-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase, 5 succinyl CoA synthetase, 6 succinate dehydrogenase, 7 fumarate
  hydratase, 8 malate dehydrogenase, 9 cytosolic aconitase, 10 glutaminase, 11 glutamate
  transaminase. b The roles of wild type and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and
  2 in cellular metabolism. CT citrate, (D)-2HG (d) 2-hydroxy glutarate, FAs fatty
  acids, ICT isocitrate, IDH isocitrate dehydrogenase, Mut mutant, PPP pentose phosphate
  pathway, Wt wild type, 2KG 2-keto glutarate, 1 mitochondrial aconitase, 2 cytosolic
  aconitase, 3 citrate lyase, 4 glutaminase, 5 glutamate dehydrogenase, 6 glutamate
  transaminase, 7 2-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases. The dotted red line indicates
  inhibition
