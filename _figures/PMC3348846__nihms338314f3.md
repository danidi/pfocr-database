caption: 'Role of Rac1/RhoA balance in endothelial barrier integrity: impact of ROS
  and NO. (A) Basal permeability. In quiescent endothelial cells, cytosolic Rac1 is
  dominant and inhibits RhoA activation. Rac1/Cdc42 stabilizes both the cortical actin
  and the adherens junction components (VE-cadherin/β-catenin). Basal eNOS activity
  generates NO (blue pathway), which dampens any superoxide production within endothelial
  cells. In addition, low levels of NO increase cAMP, whereas high levels decrease
  cAMP. Agents that tend to strengthen barrier integrity can either increase cAMP,
  leading to an increase in the Rac1/RhoA ratio (e.g., ANP), or increase eNOS activity
  (e.g., S1P). (B) Increased permeability. In response to proinflammatory mediators
  (e.g., VEGF, thrombin, histamine), RhoA becomes dominant and inhibits cytosolic
  Rac1. Activation of GPCRs increases intracellular Ca2+ levels (via TRP channels)
  and activates RhoA. RhoA (via Rho kinase) (1) increases the PTK/PTP ratio, leading
  to disorganization of adherens junctions, and (2) activates MLCK and inhibits MLCP,
  leading to actomyosin-mediated contraction. Paradoxically Rho kinase activates Rac1
  at the membrane, leading to activation of NADPH oxidase and superoxide production
  (red pathway), which in turn increases the PTK/PTP ratio. The increased intracellular
  Ca2+ also activates eNOS. Although low levels of NO (not shown) tend to stabilize
  adherens junctions, higher levels of NO (shown) favor disruption of the junctions
  as well as increasing MLCK activity (blue pathways).'
