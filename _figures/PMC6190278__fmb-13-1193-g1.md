caption: 'BCG training of human monocytes in vitro or by vaccination increases their
  surface marker expression and cytokine production in response to heterologous antigen
  stimulation [,]. In monocytes, these changes are regulated by metabolic shift from
  oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and histone modifications [], with increased
  frequency of permissive H3K4me3 and reduced presence of inhibitory H3K9me3 at the
  promoters of cytokine, receptor and metabolic pathway component encoding genes [,,].
  The left side of the diagram depicts model innate immune cells prior to the BCG
  training and the right side – post-training. Enhanced cytokine production post-training
  is indicated by arrows. Heterologous microorganism – secondary, nonmycobacterial
  infectious agent.+ BCG – in vitro or in vivo cell training with BCG.TLR4: Toll-like
  receptor 4; H3K4me3: Trimethylation of lysine at position 4 on histone 3; H3K9me3:
  Trimethylation of lysine at position 9 on histone 3.'
