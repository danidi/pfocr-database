caption: Ozone inhalation results in hyaluronan fragments with molecular weight lower
  than 300KD in the airspace, which is recognized to have immunostimmulatory properties.
  Both ozone and HA fragments can prime macrophage-derived innate immunity through
  trafficking oftlr4 to cell surface membrane. Hyaluronan interaction with the tlr4-cd44
  complex on cell surface results in activation of the MyD88-tirap signaling pathway
  resulting in NF-κB activation and both the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors
  and the development of AHR.
