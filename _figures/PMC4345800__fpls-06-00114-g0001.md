caption: Epigenetic regulation in the drought stress response. Under drought stress,
  NCED3, a key gene in the abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis pathway, is activated
  with an increase in H3K4me3 marked by the histone methyltransferase ATX1. Active
  histone marks, such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac were enriched on many drought-responsive
  genes. During recovery from drought stress, H3K9ac is rapidly removed, while H3K4me3
  is removed more slowly, indicating that H3K4me3 may be involved in epigenetic memory.
