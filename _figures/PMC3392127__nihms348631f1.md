caption: Artery wall formation begins with the interaction of jagged1 (Jag1)-expressing
  endothelial cells with mural cell progenitors expressing notch receptors (Notch).
  This interaction both promotes smooth muscle differentiation and upregulates expression
  of Jag1 in the newly formed smooth muscle cells thus initiating a feed-forward pathway
  in the nascent medial layer (Layer 1). Jag1 expressed by cells in Layer 1 engages
  notch receptors in surrounding mural cell progenitors leading to smooth muscle differentiation
  and upregulation of Jag1 expression in mural cells that will go on to form Layer
  2. This positive feedback response of Jag1 induction by Notch signaling in the developing
  artery wall is called lateral induction. By this sequential lateral induction process
  a multilayered artery wall is formed.
