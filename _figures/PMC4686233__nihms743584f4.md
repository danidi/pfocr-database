caption: Impairment of protein degradation machinery. Redox proteomics studies identified
  oxidatively modified proteins in DS and AD brain that are members of the protein
  degradative system. Specifically, UCHL1 is involved in the proteasome pathway; GRP78
  and HSC71 in unfolded protein response (UPR) and GFAP in autophagy. Dysfunction
  of all these three processes contributes significantly to accumulation of oxidized/misfolded
  proteins
