caption: The illustration shows the step-by-step synthesis of fatty acids. Significant
  loci have been identified for the ratios of substrates to products linked by red
  arrows. Plausible candidate genes that we highlighted for significant loci in this
  study are indicated alongside red arrows. For fatty acids linked by blue arrows,
  the loci for the metabolic ratios between these fatty acids remain unexplored.
