caption: 'The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway emerged as
  a pivotal regulator of protein synthesis and energy metabolism. It is present in
  at least two functionally and structurally distinct complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2.
  mTORC1 integrates a number of signals via various upstream pathways. For instance,
  hormones and growth factors (e.g. insulin and IGFs) which activate receptor tyrosine
  kinases (e.g. insulin receptor) lead to activation of PI3K which via AKT inactivates
  TSC1/2 complex. TSC1/2 complex acts as a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) towards
  the Ras homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) GTPase, which converts RHEB-GTP to its
  inactive RHEB-GDP form thus preventing activation of mTORC1. In addition, nutrients
  and in particular amino acids activate mTORC1 via RAG GTPases, while the effects
  of oxygen tension and energy status in the cell on mTORC1 activity are mediated
  by REDD1 and AMPK, respectively. mTORC1 stimulates translation by modulating the
  activity of its downstream effectors including S6Ks, 4EBPs and eEF2K. mTOR simultaneously
  perturbs other metabolic processes including induction of lipogenesis and glycolysis,
  and suppression of autophagy. Increase in energy consumption under conditions wherein
  mTOR is activated is compensated by the perturbations in the translatome that allow
  selective increase in translation of the nuclear-encoded mRNAs that encode proteins
  that bolster mitochondrial number and functions. In addition to mTOR, a number of
  stress conditions including amino acid deprivation, ER stress, heme deficiency and
  viral infection translation is downregulated via eIF2α kinases which phosphorylate
  eIF2α and impedes the recycling of ternary complex. Emerging results suggest that
  the activity of AMPK, mTOR and/or eIF2α phosphorylation may be co-regulated. Abbreviations:
