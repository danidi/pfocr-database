caption: The Notch signalling pathway derived from the KEGG database with the genes
  on the microarray encircled (A) and their corresponding expression profiles of genes
  during porcine myogenesis (B). The expression profiles indicate the gestational
  age at the X-axis and the expression profile as indicated by the differential expression
  on the microarray on the Y-axis. Since all genes are located in a single biochemical
  pathway there are no subpathways.
