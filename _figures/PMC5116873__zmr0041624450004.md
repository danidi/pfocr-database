caption: Inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways by YopJ effectors produced
  by animal pathogens. The Yersinia effector YopJ, the Salmonella enterica effector
  AvrA, and the Vibrio parahaemolyticus effector VopA directly target specific immune-related
  kinases in the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways and modify them through acetylation.
  Common targets of these effectors include MAPKKs and IKKβ, which are acetylated
  on Ser and Thr residues in the activation loop and/or ATP-binding pocket. The MAPKKK
  TAK1 is also targeted by YopJ. As a result, these effectors inhibit target kinases
  and suppress the subsequent activation of inflammatory responses. The Aeromonas
  salmonicida effector AopP suppresses the NF-κB pathway by an unknown mechanism.
  By suppressing the NF-κB pathway, YopJ effectors inhibit the activation of the inflammatory
  response and induce apoptosis in macrophages.
