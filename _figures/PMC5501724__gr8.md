caption: Model of Endocytic Regulation of TGFβ/BMP SignalingActivation of TGFβ family
  receptors by ligand binding (i) leads to formation of receptor oligomers, receptor
  phosphorylation, and internalization (ii). As the activated receptor complexes are
  targeted to the endosome they recruit SARA/endofin (iii), which bind the HD-PTP
  Bro1 domain to prevent receptors engaging the ESCRT pathway. SARA/endofin recruit
  R-Smads to the receptor complex (iv), leading to R-Smad phosphorylation and subsequent
  binding to the co-Smad, Smad4, allowing transcriptional regulation. Dephosphorylated
  receptors either fail to engage with or are released from SARA/endofin, allowing
  HD-PTP to then recruit CHMP4/ESCRT-III (v) to target receptors to ILVs (vi) and
  ultimately toward lysosomal degradation. Interaction between HD-PTP and ESCRT-0
  may provide an intermediate step prior to CHMP4 recruitment, and it is likely that
  receptor ubiquitination promotes its engagement with ESCRTs. These details are not
  shown.
