caption: Regulation of the Spc1 SAPK by PP2C and the Pyp tyrosine phosphatases. Spc1
  is activated by various forms of stress including high osmolarity stress, oxidative
  stress, and heat shock. The Wis1 MEK activates Spc1 by phosphorylating Thr-171 and
  Tyr-173. Osmostress and oxidative stress activate Wis1 through phosphorylation of
  Ser-469/Thr-473, which is carried out by MEKKs, Wis4 and Win1. Heat shock brings
  about weak activation of Wis1 in a MEKK-dependent manner as well as inhibition of
  Pyp1 and presumably Pyp2, the Spc1 Tyr-173 phosphatases, which results in strong
  activation of Spc1. Although Tyr-173 remains phosphorylated in heat-shocked cells
  because of inhibition of the Pyp phosphatases, Spc1 activity is attenuated by Thr-171
  dephosphorylation, which is carried out by Ptc1, Ptc3, and other threonine phosphatases.
  Transcription of pyp2+ and ptc1+ is induced by the Spc1–Atf1 pathway in response
  to stress stimuli, which constitutes dual loops of negative feedback. Expression
  of pyp1+ and ptc3+ is constitutive; however, they might be subjected to post-transcriptional
  regulation.
