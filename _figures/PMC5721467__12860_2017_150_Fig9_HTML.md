caption: Regulatory network elicited by nuclear translocation of syndecan-1 leading
  to inhibition of proliferation and survival. Data are based on differentially expressed
  genes obtained by microarray and transcription factor array on fibrosarcoma cells
  with preserved and impaired nuclear translocation of syndecan-1. Nuclear syndecan-1
  activates several transcription factors (ovals) and induces immediate early genes.
  Transcription factors activate (arrows) or inhibit (bars) their targets, and in
  addition, they trigger the TGF-β pathway (rectangle). In turn, TGF-β can also induce
  EGR-1 and other transcription factors, which can provide a feedback loop. The arrows
  in blue represent the current knowledge about the role of target genes in governing
  different processes. The functional outcome of nuclear syndecan-1 signaling is the
  measured inhibition of proliferation and cell survival
