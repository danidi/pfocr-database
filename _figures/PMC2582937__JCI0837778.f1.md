caption: (A) In normal airways, CFTR and ENaC coexist in the apical plasma membrane
  of airway epithelial cells with CaCC, outwardly rectifying Cl– channel (ORCC), and
  Cl– channel 2 (CLC2). Basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase pumps provide the driving force
  for active transport, and the Na+K+2Cl– cotransporter assists in moving Cl– across
  the basolateral membrane. Active Cl– secretion via CFTR (baseline unstimulated and
  agonist activated) tempers ENaC-mediated Na+ reabsorption. The combination of Cl–
  secretion and reduced Na+ reabsorption favors a healthy ion composition and depth
  of airway surface liquid, enabling effective ciliary beat–driven mucociliary clearance.
  Mucus is secreted from submucosal glands and is propelled by cilia and cough in
  a proximal direction. (B) In CF airways, CFTR is absent or dysfunctional and ENaC
  is no longer regulated, leading to hyperabsorption of Na+ and an increased driving
  force for fluid reabsorption. The airway surface liquid depth is reduced, the submucosal
  glands are hypertrophied, excessive mucus is secreted, and mucociliary clearance
  becomes impaired. In both CF and non-CF airway epithelial cells, P2Y2 receptors
  coexist in the apical membrane and are stimulated by ATP or other purinergic agonists
  to initiate increased intracellular Ca2+. Ca2+signaling stimulates Cl– secretion
  through the CaCC pathway. In this issue of the JCI, Coakley et al. () show that
  17β-estradiol intersects with this pathway. Higher 17β-estradiol levels are sensed
  through estrogen receptors, and the authors show that Ca2+-activated Cl– secretion
  is decreased in women with CF at times when 17β-estradiol levels are high. The net
  result in CF is a worsening degree of airway surface dehydration and decreased mucociliary
  clearance.
