caption: Brief description of the interaction of a CD4+ T cell with B cells. CD40L
  is transiently expressed on the surface of the CD4+ T cell after interaction between
  the T-cell receptor complex and MHC class II molecule. CD40L interacts with CD40
  on the B cell and recruits TRAFs, leading to the expression of co-stimulatory molecules
  (CD80 and CD86) and IL-12 secretion, and the promotion of IFN-γ-dependent T-cell
  differentiation. Additionally, CD40 signaling in B cells activates NF-κB translocation
  to the nucleus via IKK-γ and IκB-α, leading to the expression of AID, UNG and DNA
  repair enzymes (latter not shown) in B cells, which results in CSR and SHM, and
  the generation of germinal centers and production of high-affinity Abs. The deficient
  molecules involved in HIGM are labeled in red and red box.
