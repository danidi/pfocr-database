caption: A model for differentially regulating Numb and Notch signaling during mammalian
  neurogenesis through Golgi fragmentation and reconstitution. In this model, the
  mammalian Numb proteins, Numb and Numbl (in green), inhibit Notch signaling to specify
  progenitor fates when neural progenitor cells divide asymmetrically to self-renew
  and produce a neuron, but this occurs only when ACBD3 (in red) is present in the
  cytosol after Golgi fragmentation during mitosis. Newborn neurons have higher Notch
  activity, which also prevents them from terminal differentiation. Newly synthesized
  Numb and Numbl proteins subsequently accumulate in newborn neurons but, with ACBD3
  localized to the Golgi, inhibit Notch signaling by tapping into a different pathway
  to promote neuronal differentiation. Notch activation is also necessary for preventing
  progenitor cells from differentiating during interphase, and this activity is not
  affected by Numb presence because ACBD3 associates with the Golgi. Stem cells in
  other tissues may also use this mechanism to balance self-renewal and differentiation.
