caption: In myeloid cells, chemokine mRNA instability is dependent upon AUUUA-containing
  ARE motifs that are recognized by TTP while in non-myeloid cells, AUUUA-free sequences
  produce comparable instability through undefined RNA binding protein(s). TIR signaling
  couples to mRNA stabilization via the adaptor protein MyD88 with IRAK4 and IRAK1
  kinases, TRAF6, TAK1, and the p38 MAP kinase cascade. IL-17 signals in non-myeloid
  cells through the adapter protein Act1 and couples with a second mRNA stabilization
  pathway that operates independently of TRAF6 and p38/MK2. This second pathway also
  appears to be utilized by IL-1 in non-myeloid cells and segregates from the NFκB
  activation pathway at IRAK1. These pathways link to an instability/stabilization
  mechanism that depends upon non-AUUUA containing sequence and does not require TTP.
  The details of this second pathway, including the specific target nucleotide sequence
  motifs, the RNA binding proteins, and the signaling events remain to be identified.
