caption: In the classic bile acid synthesis pathway, cholesterol is converted to cholic
  acid (CA, 3α, 7α, 12α) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 3α, 7α) CYP7A1 is the rate-limiting
  enzyme and CYP8B1 catalyzes the synthesis of CA. In mouse liver, CDCA is converted
  to α-muricholic acid (α-MCA, 3α, 6β, 7α) and β-MCA (3α, 6β, 7β) Most bile acids
  in mice are taurine (T)-conjugated and secreted into bile. In the intestine, gut
  bacteria de-conjugate bile acids and then remove the 7α-hydroxyl group from CA and
  CDCA to form secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA, 3α, 12α) and lithocholic
  acid (LCA, 3α), respectively. T-α-MCA and T-β-MCA are converted to T-hyodeoxycholic
  acid (THDCA, 3α, 6α), T-ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, 3α, 7β), T-hyocholic acid (THCA,
  3α, 6α, 7α) and T-murideoxycholic acid (TMDCA, 3α, 6β). These secondary bile acids
  are reabsorbed and circulated to liver to contribute to the bile acid pool. Secondary
  bile acids ω-MCA (3α, 6α, 7β) and LCA are excreted into feces.
