caption: The sun’s ultraviolet light damages DNA in cells in the skin, particularly
  keratinocytes and melanocytes. In keratinocytes, DNA damage triggers p53, which
  induces expression of POMC. POMC is cleaved to produce αMSH, a hormone that is released
  from the keratinocyte. MC1R, a receptor on melanocytes, binds αMSH, causing activation
  of PKA through production of cAMP. PKA then phosphorylates CREB, activating it as
  a transcription factor that up-regulates the expression of MITF, a melanocyte lineage
  specific transcription factor. MITF in turn activates multiple genes involved in
  pigmentation and cell survival, allowing continued melanin production despite UV-induced
  DNA damage. Because the melanocyte has sustained DNA damage, some proteins produced
  downstream of MITF may harbor mutations. Proteins expressed downstream of MITF are
  degraded by the proteasome and epitopes, including those with mutations, are presented
  on MHC class I.
