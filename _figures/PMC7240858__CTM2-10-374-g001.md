caption: Innate immune checkpoints influencing DC function in the TME. A variety of
  innate immune checkpoints may limit DC function within the TME when engaged by ligands
  expressed on or secreted by tumor cells or other tumor‐associated populations, such
  as Tregs. Signaling through these innate checkpoint receptors compromises several
  DC functions that are critical to the induction, stimulation, and maintenance of
  antitumor immune responses. Mechanisms indicated with “?” represent those that have
  yet to be directly demonstrated in DC but that have been identified as outcomes
  of checkpoint receptor engagement in other innate populations (ie, macrophages)
  regulated by the same checkpoint pathway. Many of these checkpoint pathways are
  now targets for therapeutic interventions that aim to enhance the antitumor immune
  functions of DC, as described in detail in the main text
