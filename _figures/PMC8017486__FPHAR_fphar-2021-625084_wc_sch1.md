caption: Schematic illustration of the design and application of AE@NPs for enhanced
  PC treatment. (A) The design of ALA and ERL co-loaded nanoparticles (AE@NPs). (B)
  The action mechanisms of AE@NPs in PC cells. AE@NPs firstly entered cells via endocytosis
  and released ALA and ERL within PC cells. The released ALA could inhibit the activation
  of STAT, and ERL could inhibit the EGFR signal pathway. In addition, AE@NPs-induced
  upregulated ROS could activate p38-MAPK pathway. These effects collectively contributed
  to the enhanced cell-killing, anti-proliferation, and anti-metastasis effects of
  AE@NPs in PC cells.
