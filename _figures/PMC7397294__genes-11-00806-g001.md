caption: Diagram of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-malic enzyme (NADP-ME)
  biosynthetic pathway of C4 photosynthesis (adapted from []). In the mesophyll cells,
  CO2 is converted to HCO3− catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (CA) and fixed into the
  four-carbon acid, oxaloacetate (OAA), by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC).
  Phosphorylation of PEPC is carried out by PEPC kinase (PPCK). The OAA generated
  by PEPC is then reduced to malate by the NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) or
  trans-aminated to aspartate. The resultant C4 acids, malate and aspartate, are transported
  to the bundle sheath and then decarboxylated in the vicinity of Rubisco to release
  CO2 and pyruvate. Pyruvate is transported back to mesophyll cells to regenerate
  PEP by pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), while CO2 enters the Calvin–Benson–Bassham
  cycle and is fixed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco). Activation
  and inactivation of PPDK is catalyzed by PPDK regulatory protein (PPDK-RP).
