caption: Schematic representation of low temperature signal transduction. Solid arrows
  represent connections with at least two pieces of bioinformatic support (triangular
  arrowhead represents gene activation, flattened arrowhead represents gene repression).
  Dashed arrows represent regulatory connections with experimental/bioinformatic support
  but accomplished by unknown (and possibly posttranscriptional) mechanisms. Boxes
  represent cis-elements within the 500 bp promoters of the genes listed (ICE1, AT3G26744;
  ZAT12, AT5G59820; HOS9, AT2G01500; CBF2, AT4G25470; NAC072, AT4G27410; CBF1, AT4G25490;
  and CBF3, AT4G25480) and are color coded according to cis-element identity (red
  box, ICEr3; orange box, ICEr4; blue box, DRE; green box, ICEr1; purple box, I HOS9r1;
  and yellow box, EP2). Protein phosphorylation events, where known, are indicated
  by circles containing “P” attached to the protein TFs. Unknown types of posttranslational
  modification are indicated by circles containing “?” attached to the protein TFs.
  The ICEr4 element present in the CBF3 promoter contains the CCACGT core, but lacks
  an “H” in the first position.
