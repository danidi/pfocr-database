caption: Thalidomide bypasses the requirement of the TGF-β1–endoglin–Alk-1 signaling
  pathway for vascular stability. (a) In normal developing vessels, TGF-β1 signals
  via endoglin, TGF-β type I receptor and Alk-1, in a complicated positive feedback
  loop, to enhance endothelial cell–pericyte contact, vessel quiescence and stabilization.
  TGF-β1 also directly stimulates pericyte differentiation. (b) In HHT, signaling
  by the endoglin–Alk-1 receptor complex is reduced, disrupting this positive regulatory
  loop and leading to a breakdown of endothelial cell–pericyte contacts and increased
  angiogenesis. Thalidomide administration in HHT stimulates PDGF-B expression, independently
  of the TGF-β1–endoglin–Alk-1 pathway, thereby bypassing a requirement for this regulatory
  pathway in vessel stability. The quiescent state of the endothelial cell is re-established
  by molecular interactions between the closely apposed pericyte and endothelial cell
  and the downregulation of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF. The molecular interactions
  stimulated by the intimate cellular contact between endothelial cell and pericyte
  redresses the balance from active angiogenesis toward a stable functional blood
  vessel.
