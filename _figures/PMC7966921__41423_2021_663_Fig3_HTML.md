caption: The role of myristoylation in regulating TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM)
  during LPS-induced TLR4 inflammatory responses. TRAM is myristoylated and anchored
  to the plasma membrane. After LPS stimulation, TLR4 dimerizes to recruit the TIR
  domains of cytoplasmic adaptor molecules, including Mal, TRAM, MyD88, and TRIF,
  which further activate NF-κB and IRF3 signaling to produce the proinflammatory cytokine
  IFNβ. Notably, following interaction with TLR4, TRAM is transiently phosphorylated
  by PKCε on Ser-16, which is near its N-terminus. This phosphorylation event adjacent
  to the myristoyl group reduces the electrostatic interaction between multiple residues
  and phospholipid head groups, leading to TRAM dissociation from the membrane. This
  process is not only essential for the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB but also, more
  importantly, constitutes a negative feedback mechanism of the TLR4 signaling pathway,
  avoiding excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, LPS-induced
  activation of the TLR4 pathway promotes the expression and activation of heme oxygenase-2
  (HO-2, a myristate-binding protein). HO-2 binds to the myristoyl group and inhibits
  the function of TRAM, thereby negatively regulating TLR4 signaling. It is not yet
  known how or whether proteins trapped by HO-2 are released. If they are not released,
  we speculate that the HO-2-TRAM complex will be degraded via the ubiquitin-mediated
  protein degradation pathway or delivered to another membrane with the help of an
  unknown cofactor
