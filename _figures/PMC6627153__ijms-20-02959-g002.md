caption: PCOS–disease subnetwork 1. This subnetwork highlights shared proteins and
  one shared pathway (ribosome biogenesis) between PCOS and migraine. Different coloring
  of nodes and lines represents PCOS-related proteins (red), shared proteins (orange),
  PCOS–disease interactions (blue), and protein–pathway interactions (green). Circle
  nodes refer to PCOS-related proteins, triangle nodes refer to disease, and square
  nodes refer to pathway.
