caption: HCC is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. The present study by Takeda et
  al. () indicates that a subclass of patients with activated HGF-MET signaling might
  also display induction of MLL expression. This induction stabilizes the MLL-ETS2
  complex and increases H3K4me3. Activation of this signaling cascade confers invasive
  tumor growth of HCC cells and seeding of distant metastasis via MMP1 and MMP3 upregulation,
  which might explain the poor outcome associated with MET activation. Therefore,
  this newly described engagement of HGF-MET and MLL might provide a promising approach
  for selection of HCC patients most likely to benefit from targeted therapies with
  MLL, taspase-1, or MET inhibitors and ultimately improve patient survival.
