caption: A model for targeting the breast and ovarian cancer type 1 susceptibility
  protein (BRCA1) to damage-induced foci at DNA double-stranded breaks that involves
  a ubiquitin-dependent signal transduction pathway. The current hypothesis is that
  DNA damage (1) first triggers the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–ataxia telangiectasia
  and RAD3-related protein (ATR)-dependent phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX
  (2). Subsequently, phosphorylated H2AX directly recruits mediator of DNA damage
  checkpoint 1 (MDC1), which in turn promotes the accumulation of the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex RING finger protein 8 (RNF8)–ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13;
  also known as UBE2N) to mediate ubiquitylation of histones and other yet-to-be-identified
  substrates at or near the sites of DNA breaks (3). The newly identified E3 ubiquitin
  ligase RNF168 recognizes ubiquitylated histones and, in concert with UBC13, amplifies
  the local ubiquitylation events involving Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains (4). These
  ubiquitin chains are recognized by the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-containing
  receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80; also known as UIMC1), which recruits the
  BRCA1A complex (including breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1)) to
  DNA double-stranded breaks (5). Chromatin retention of BRCA1 promotes checkpoint
  kinase 1 (CHK1; also known as CHEK1) phosphorylation and G2–M checkpoint activation.
