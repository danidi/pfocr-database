caption: Cigarette smoke exposure induces autophagy and apoptosis. Our recent studies
  indicate that exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in lung epithelial cells
  leads to the activation of autophagy. Specifically, CSE activated microtubule-associated
  protein-1 light chain (LC) 3B, a regulator of autophagosome formation, through an
  early growth response (Egr)-1–dependent transcriptional mechanism. Furthermore,
  CSE stimulated the increased expression of other molecules involved in activation
  of the autophagic pathway, including Atg4B, Atg5, and Atg7, in cultured epithelial
  cells. CSE exposure concurrently activated the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in lung
  epithelial cells, involving the activation of the death-inducing signal complex
  (DISC), and activation of downstream caspase-8, -9, and -3, leading to cell death
  by apoptosis. In the CSE model, we demonstrated that activation of the autophagic
  pathway led to increased apoptosis, as siRNA-directed knockdown of LC3B inhibited
  DISC formation and caspase activation in this model. Further studies are needed
  to define the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in the CSE model. ROS
  = reactive oxygen species.
