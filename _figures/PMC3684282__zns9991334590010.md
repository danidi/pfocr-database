caption: Schematic of myelin-mediated activation of the TGFβ signaling pathway and
  downregulation of Smad2 by SLPI. A, Myelin-associated inhibitors activate the TGFβ
  receptor complex through as yet undefined means. The activated receptor complex
  phosphorylates Smad2, which is essential for inhibition of neurite outgrowth by
  myelin. B, SLPI, either exogenously applied or produced in response to elevation
  of cAMP, localizes to the nucleus of the neuron and binds to the Smad2 promoter,
  inhibiting transcription and reducing the amount of Smad2 protein within the neuron.
  Thus, less Smad2 is available for phosphorylation, which allows the neuron to extend
  neurites in the presence of myelin.
