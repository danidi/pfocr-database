caption: Cartilage damaged by trauma, mechanical stress such as obesity, and chronic
  inflammation initiates the release of DAMPs including HMGB-1, AGEs, and S100A8 and
  S100A9 calgranulin proteins. HMGB-1 released from the nucleus of the damaged cell
  into the extracellular environment binds to both TLRs and RAGE. The binding of HMGB-1
  and RAGE can be facilitated by the proteoglycan and heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate
  is activated via interactions with heparanase. Homodimers of S100A8 and S100A9 have
  been shown to have a proinflammatory effect, while the S100A8 and S100A9 heterodimer
  has not been shown to facilitate inflammation. Binding of HMGB-1with RAGE and TLRs,
  and calgranulin with TLRs initiates a signaling cascade involving JAK, ERK, MyD88
  TRAF/TRIM pathway and acts through the transcription factor NF-κB. This results
  in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are translated and released
  from the host cell to interact with immune cells such as macrophages leading to
  secretion of additional inflammatory cytokines to recruit more immune cells, as
  well as MMPs that break down collagen and degrade cartilage. The degradation of
  cartilage triggers the release of additional DAMPs and the process continues. DAMPs,
  damage associated molecular patterns; JNK, Jun amino-terminal kinases; HMGB-1, high
  mobility group box-1; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa beta; RAGE, receptor for advanced
  glycation end product; TLRs, toll like receptors;
