caption: 'Reaction scheme for EGFR signal transduction pathway in H1299 cells. The
  reaction steps of the EGFR signaling pathway are labeled from 1 to 27. These numbers
  correspond to the biochemical reactions in Additional file , Table S1. Steps 4,
  11, and 15-27 are described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the other reactions
  by mass action. The individual reaction equations, the estimated parameters, and
  the estimated ranges are explained in Additional file , Table S2-5. The inhibitory
  effects of Mig6 and gefitinib are indicated by red lines. E11: EGFR homodimer; ShcP:
  free phosphorylated Shc; E11P: phosphorylated EGFR homodimer; Raf1A: activated Raf1;
  MEKP: singly phosphorylated MEK; MEKPP: doubly phosphorylated MEK; ERKP: singly
  phosphorylated ERK; ERKPP: doubly phosphorylated ERK.'

  of MIG6 alters gefitinib sensitivity.
