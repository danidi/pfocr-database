caption: Schematic of glycolysis and ancillary glucose metabolism pathways. Once glucose
  enters the cell, it can be phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which
  isomerizes to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The F6P is then phosphorylated by PFK1—the
  major rate-limiting and committed step in glycolysis—to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
  (F-1,6-P2). These reactions comprise the preparatory phase of glycolysis and utilize
  ATP. In addition, glycolytic metabolites in this phase of glycolysis serve as precursors
  to several ancillary biosynthetic pathways, including the PPP and the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP), as well as the polyol pathway (not shown) and glycogen
  synthetic pathway (not shown). The payoff phase commences with the splitting of
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into DHAP and GAP. DHAP is a precursor for the GLP, important
  for the synthesis of glycerophospholipids, and it can be isomerized to GAP. GAP
  is oxidized and phosphorylated to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Energy (ATP) is released
  as these 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate molecules are converted to pyruvate, which is then
  transaminated to alanine, converted to lactate, or oxidized in mitochondria. The
  activity of PFK1, which sits at the nexus between the preparatory and payoff phases,
  is increased by the product of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2), fructose-2,6 bisphosphate
  (F-2,6-P2).
