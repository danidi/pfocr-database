caption: Mode of Cmk2 function in the feedback regulation of calcium/calcineurin signaling
  pathway. In response to high levels of extracellular calcium, Ca2+ enters the cell
  through unknown pathways, and both calcineurin and Crz1 are activated to induce
  expression of target genes including CMK2, RCN1, PMR1 and PMC1 []. Arrows indicate
  activation, and T bars represent inhibition. A dashed line means that more data
  is needed to confirm
