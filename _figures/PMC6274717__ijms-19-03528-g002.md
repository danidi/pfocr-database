caption: IL-6 signal transduction and modes of the IL-6 receptor system. IL-6 binds
  to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). The IL-6/IL-6R complex is associated with gp130, resulting
  in a hexamer structure. Homodimerization of gp130 activates Janus kinase (JAK) and
  subsequently activates Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),
  STAT1 and SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). STAT3 and
  STAT1 move into the nucleus and SHP-2 activates the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. STAT3
  induces the negative feedback molecules suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1)
  and SOCS3. SOCS1 inhibits JAKs. SOCS3 inhibits the SHP2 pathway. STAT3 also induces
  Arid5a, which stabilizes Stat3 mRNA by binding to the Stat3 3′UTR. IL-6 signaling
  via membrane IL-6R or soluble IL-6R is called classic signaling or trans-signaling,
  respectively. When an IL-6R-expressing cell and a gp130-expressing cell are in close
  proximity, IL-6 is presented by between cells, a process called trans-presentation.
  IL-6 also activates gp130 in the endosomal compartment, endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
  or Golgi body through intracellular signaling. The red arrow indicates signal transduction.
