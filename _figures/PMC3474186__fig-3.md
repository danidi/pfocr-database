caption: Overview of apoptotic signaling through tumor necrosis factor superfamily
  receptor 6 (Fas) and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR). When Fas ligand (FasL)
  (CD95L) binds to Fas it initiates the formation of the death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC) involving the association of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and
  pro-caspase-8 (pro-casp-8). In the absence of caspase-8-FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting
  enzyme inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), pro-caspase-8 is activated and initiates the
  caspase proteolytic cascade, leading to apoptosis. DISC formation can also lead
  to the activation of the MKK7 pathway and jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation,
  resulting in apoptosis. There are other cell-type-specific pathways that are affected
  by FasL. One of these pathways involves Bid, which can become truncated Bid (tBID)
  leading to the release of cytochrome C, and subsequently caspase activation. FasL
  can also stimulate the IκB kinase (IKK)/NFκB pathway resulting in the phosphorylation
  of IκB, leading to proteasome degradation and the translocation of NFκB to the nucleus.
  NFκB is responsible for initiating transcription of proteins, such as Grx, iNOS,
  and TNFα. The NFκB pathway can also be activated through the binding of TNFα to
  the TNFR, acting through NIK or TAK1. Proteins in these pathways for which there
  is experimental evidence implicating that they are regulated by Grx and protein
  glutathionylation are indicated by an asterisk (*).
