caption: Suggested Schemes for PGI1-Mediated Biosynthesis of MEP Pathway Isoprenoid-Derived
  CKs and GAs in Cells of Vascular Tissues, and FAs and Proteins in Mixotrophic Maturing
  Embryos of Arabidopsis. In both cases, cytosolic G6P can be glycolytically converted
  to PEP and pyruvate, which can enter plastids via the PPT and BASS2 transporters,
  respectively. According to the scheme in (A), some of the cytosolic G6P can be incorporated
  into plastids through the hexose-P transporter (GPT) and subsequently glycolytically
  converted to GAP and pyruvate. Plastidial GAP and pyruvate are then metabolized
  by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase (DXS) to products that enter the
  MEP pathway and fuel synthesis of isoprenoid hormones (; ). DMAPP can be converted
  to ent-kaurene in a three-step process catalyzed by geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP)
  synthase (GGPPS), ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), and ent-kaurene synthase
  (KS). ent-Kaurene can be then transported to other parts of the plant or oxidized
  to GA12, which is converted to bioactive GA in the cytosol by GA20ox and GA3ox.
  DMAPP can also be converted to CKs (). In heterotrophic cells lacking plastid-localized
  phosphoglyceromutase (PGAM), enolase (ENO), and the triose-P translocator (TPT),
  3PGA produced in the plastid via PGI1 can be exported to the cytosol via GPT or
  other nonspecific transporters then glycolytically converted into PEP and pyruvate,
  which can then enter plastids through the PPT and the BASS2 pyruvate transporter,
  respectively. According to the scheme in (B), some of the cytosolic G6P can be incorporated
  into plastids through GPT and converted to 3PGA by the Rubisco shunt, which involves
  reactions of the early steps of glycolysis (PFK and aldolase), reactions of the
  nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway, phosphoribulokinase (PRK), and Rubisco.
  In plants lacking plastidial PFK, part of the 3PGA generated can be converted to
  GAP necessary for Ru5P production by means of plastidial GAPDH and PGK (highlighted
  in blue). 3PGA can leave plastids via the TPT, the GPT, or other nonspecific transporters
  and glycolytically converted to PEP and pyruvate in the cytosol, which can enter
  plastids, as indicated above. Alternatively, and/or additionally, plastidial 3PGA
  can be converted to pyruvate in plastids. The ATP required for FA synthesis can
  be generated from photosynthesis and the PK reaction in the plastidial compartment
  or obtained from the cytosol via the NTT transporter (). NADPH and NADH can be generated
  in plastids from the light photosynthetic and pyruvate dehydrogenase reactions,
  respectively. ALD, aldolase; TA, transaldolase; TK, transketolase; TPI, triose-phosphate
  isomerase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; HMBDP, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl

  are highlighted in red.
