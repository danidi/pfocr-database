caption: Comparison of cAMP metabolism and intracellular signaling pathway in Treg
  and Tcon subsets. (A) Tregs contain a high concentration of cAMP compared to Tcons
  as a consequence of their high cAMP anabolism. Tregs express mainly AC compared
  to Tcons, and AC catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP). In addition, G protein-coupled receptors, such as A2A, are able to activate
  AC. In contrast to Tcons, Tregs exhibit low cAMP catabolism due to a low expression
  of PDEs, which decompose cAMP into AMP. The presence of FOXP3 in Tregs, but not
  in Tcons, suppresses PDE transcription, while it favors ICER and AC expression.
  The localization and expression of molecules, such as ICER/CREM (high expression
  and nuclear), NFAT (low expression and cytoplasmic) and EPAC (high expression),
  are associated with the maintenance of Treg phenotype and function. (B) Tcons contain
  low levels of cAMP due to their reduced AC but high PDE expression. In contrast
  to Treg, NFAT is active in the nucleus of Tcons. The low and cytoplasmic expression
  of ICER/CREM and EPAC are also associated with cell cycle progression and active
  cytokine secretion in Tcons.
