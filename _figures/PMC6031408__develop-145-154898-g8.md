caption: Schematic describing the proposed role of MYC and CDKN1A in Wnt/β-catenin
  (CTNNB1) and angiopoietin pathway-dependent hyaloid vessel regression. This model
  describes the role of three cell types, macrophages, pericytes and VECs, in hyaloid
  vessel regression. Prior to the initiation of regression (A, maintenance phase)
  macrophages do not express Wnt7b. Through mechanisms not currently understood, Akt
  activity is sufficient to maintain cell survival during this phase. Regression phase
  (B) is initiated by the suppression of VEGFA expression by a light-response pathway
  (not shown) and by the upregulation of Wnt7b expression in macrophages. Expression
  of Wnt7b is dependent on expression of Ang2 in pericytes. Ang2 has the dual role
  of suppressing the activity of Akt to promote cell death but at the same time providing
  an alternative means with which to activate β-catenin and thus promote cell cycle
  entry. Myc is known to be positively regulated by β-catenin to promote cell cycle
  entry and cell death. The loss of both of these cellular responses in the hyaloid
  vessels of Myc conditional mutant VECs is consistent with these observations. In
  the hyaloid vessels, CDKN1A is crucial for regulating cell cycle progression and
  thus influences the balance between maintenance and regression. CDKN1A levels are
  suppressed by MYC but are also likely to be regulated directly via Akt-dependent
  phosphorylation.
