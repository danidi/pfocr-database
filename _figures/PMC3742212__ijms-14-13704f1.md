caption: Melatonin molecular signaling pathways in Plasmodium. Melatonin (MLT) crosses
  the erythrocyte (RBC) surface membrane (EM) and the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane
  (PVM) into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Plasmodium senses MLT from the RBC
  and a cascade of signaling is initiated through an as yet unidentified melatonin
  receptor located in the parasite plasma membrane (PM) (?). Melatonin signaling activates
  phospholipase C (PLC) that induces the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3).
  IP3 is able to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading
  to a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration through open ER-localized IP3-sensitive
  Ca2+ channels. In addition, melatonin signaling activates adenylyl cyclase (AC)
  producing an increase in cAMP level and further activation of protein kinase A (PKA).
  PKA is involved in controlling the balance of gene expression in the nucleus (N).
  Melatonin is also implicated in the activation of gene transcription for the UPS
  (ubiquitin proteasome system) machinery. Protein kinase 7 (PfPK7) seems to participate
  in the melatonin signaling pathway since parasites with a knockout of this kinase
  are not responsive to melatonin treatment, as measured by parasite intraerythrocytic
  stage distribution and activation of a subset of genes involved in UPS. However,
  how PfPK7 plays its role in melatonin signaling has not been identified yet. Most
  recently, it has been shown that melatonin increases ubiquitination of PfNF-YB transcription
  factor and increases its expression.
