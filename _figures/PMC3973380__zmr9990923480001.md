caption: Two pathways for glutamate synthesis. The left panel shows the GDH pathway,
  and the right panel shows the cyclic GS-GOGAT pathway. The basic characteristics
  of the two pathways are shown in the box below the scheme. The GDH pathway consists
  of a single enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). One net glutamate is produced
  from the reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate; no ATP is involved, and GDH had
  a relatively low affinity for ammonium. The cyclic GS-GOGAT pathway consists of
  two enzymes, i.e., glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT), which,
  in a cyclic configuration in effect, also produces one net glutamate by reductive
  amination of 2-oxoglutarate. However, one ATP is invested for every amino group
  assimilated, and GS has a relatively high affinity for ammonium.
