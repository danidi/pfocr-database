caption: 'Immune responses induced by DNA damage response (DDR). Radiotherapy (RT)/chemotherapy
  change the immune microenvironment to be advantageous in combination with immune
  checkpoint inhibitors. Three types of immune responses are included in these responses:
  (1) neoantigen production induced by mutations in gene loci and the induction of
  HLA class I (HLA)-neoantigen complex expression, (2) PD-L1 upregulation via DNA
  damage signals, and (3) the accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA and activation of the
  cGAS/STING pathway.'
