caption: Leptin receptor signaling. Leptin binding to the long isoform of the leptin
  receptor results in autophosphorylation and activation of JAK2, which then leads
  to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in the intracellular domain of the
  leptin receptor (pY-985 and pY-1138). pY-1138 recruits the transcription factor
  STAT3, which is appears to be crucial in the action of leptin on energy expenditure.
  STAT3 activation also results in the transcription of the signaling inhibitor SOCS3.
  Leptin receptor signaling also results in the activation of the IRS-phosphorylation–PI3-kinase
  pathway, probably through phosphorylation sites on JAK2. SOCS3 attenuates leptin
  receptor signaling by binding to pY-985 and to JAK2.
