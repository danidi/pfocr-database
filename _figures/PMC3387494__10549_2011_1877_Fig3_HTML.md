caption: The regulatory network of EZH2. A model for the modulation of the expression
  and activity of EZH2 based on our results and available data in the literature.
  Binding of miR-101 and miR-26a to the 3′-UTR blocks transcription of EZH2 [, ].
  Our data linked expression levels of miR-26a and EZH2 by the GTA of pathways to
  the cyclins and cell cycle regulation pathway with two significant genes [CCNE1
  and CDC2 (CDK1)]. CDC2 (CDK1) and CDK2 activate EZH2 through the phosphorylation
  of its Thr350 residue [–]. Our study shows that, in breast cancer, miR-26a and CDC2
  might be involved in the regulation EZH2 expression and activity, respectively,
  and as a result associate with response to tamoxifen

  and with favorable outcome on tamoxifen in metastatic breast cancer.
