caption: Hypotheses for the mechanisms involved in the coordination of morphogenetic
  events at the end of mitosis. Hypothesis (a) implies that the Cdc15p-mediated pathway
  is directly or indirectly involved in B cyclin degradation by the APC and that the
  consequent inactivation of the Cdc28p–B cyclin complex accounts for the polarization
  of the morphogenetic apparatus to the neck area for septum development. Hypothesis
  (b) argues that the Cdc15p pathway, similar to the cdc7 pathway in the fission yeast,
  would directly trigger the morphogenetic response for septum formation, perhaps
  activated by signals derived from Cdc28p–B cyclin inactivation or coordinated with
  it via feedback mechanisms (broken line). The arrest in anaphase observed in cdc15
  and related mutants would be due to a cell cycle checkpoint that would inactivate
  Cdc28p until morphogenetic events at the neck are settled. The fact that a septin
  (cdc10) mutation prevents the delay in budding observed in a cdc15 mutant suggest
  that the components of such putative checkpoint rely on the integrity of the septin
  ring for their functionality.
