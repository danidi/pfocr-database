caption: 'Current therapeutics targeting the HGF/MET signaling pathway. NK4, a four-kringles-containing
  intracellular fragment of HGF, was identified as a competitive inhibitor of HGF/MET
  signaling through suppression of specific binding of HGF to the receptor. An engineered
  soluble MET receptor, decoy MET, interferes with HGF binding to MET. L2G7 is an
  anti-HGF monoclonal antibody that suppresses tumor growth by inhibition of the MET
  signaling pathway. A neutralizing, fully human monoclonal antibody against human
  and nonhuman primate HGF, AMG 102, inhibited HGF-induced c-MET autophosphorylation.
  A novel OA-5D5 anti-c-MET antibody suppresses the growth of U87MG cells. An adenosine
  triphosphateanalog, K252a, potently inhibits HGF-mediated morphology changes and
  suppresses MET-mediated proliferation. A selective small molecular inhibitor, PHA-665752,
  inhibits the catalytic activity of c-MET and downstream kinases. PHA-665752 also
  suppresses the HGF-driven cell growth, motility, and morphology changes. SU11271,
  a potent and selective pyrrole-indolinone inhibitor of MET tyrosine kinase, suppresses
  HGF-mediated cell proliferation, survival, and invasion in various cancer cells.
  SU11274 reduces the activity of constitutively active TPR-MET fusion protein, followed
  by inducing apoptosis in cells transformed by the oncogenic TPR-MET. Crizotinib,
  a dual inhibitor of MET and ALK tyrosine kinases, inhibits cells dependent upon
  c-MET or ALK activity. Cabozantinib, a multityrosine kinase inhibitor, suppresses
  the activity of MET and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Tivantinib,
  a potent small molecular inhibitor of c-MET, induces cell-cycle arrest and inhibits
  the invasive growth of various cancer cells.Abbreviations: ALK, anaplastic lymphoid
  kinase; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; OA-5D5, one-armed 5D5.'
