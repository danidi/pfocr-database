caption: A model for the role of eEF-2K in the induction of autophagy during amino
  acid starvation and ER stress. The phosphorylation of eIF2α activates eEF-2K, as
  evidenced by the phosphorylation of eEF-2 in cells treated with the PP1/GADD34 inhibitor
  sal. During amino acid starvation, the activation of eEF-2K is dependent on the
  phosphorylation of eIF2α. During ER stress, in addition to the PERK/eIF2α pathway
  eEF-2K is activated by at least another signaling pathway dependent on Ca2+.
