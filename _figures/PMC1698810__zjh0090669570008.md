caption: Model for the involvement of JAB1 in TNF-α signaling pathway. Although TRAF2-JAB1
  forms a complex in the cytosol, the activation of kinase(s) because of TNF-α stimulation
  leads to the replacement of a suppressor with activated kinase(s), which is associated
  with JAB1. As a result, JAB1-mediated activation of TRAF2 is initiated by a cascade
  of phosphorylation reactions followed by ubiquitination TRAF2 at position of K63.
  Eventually, TRAF2 is activated and recruited to the TNFR1 complex.
