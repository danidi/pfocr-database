caption: (A) A model of the human TCA cycle and glycolysis pathways drawn using the
  mEPN scheme. The insert shows a small section of the pathway demonstrating the different
  shapes and colours used to depict different classes of molecule and how different
  types of processes can be distinguished using differently labelled process nodes.
  This is a purely graphical model, but with parameterisation it could be used to
  run simulations of this pathway. (B) Depiction of the nuclear pore complex as an
  example of how the mEPN scheme can be used to represent large structures composed
  of multiple subunits. In all models constructed by us, standard nomenclature is
  used to define entities (e.g., Human Genome Nomenclature Committee [HGNC]-approved
  names for human proteins and genes) to remove ambiguity of what is being represented.
