caption: Models for the trafficking and regulation of prenylated proteins. The farnesyl
  group is depicted here to represent prenylation. A) The prenylation of a Caax-containing
  protein is catalyzed by FTase or GGTase-I in the cytsosol. Next it is trafficked
  to the ER where it is proteoylzed by a CaaX protease such as Rce1 and carboxymethylated
  by isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase (ICMT). If the protein contains another cysteine
  near the C-terminus, a protein acyltransferase (PAT) can catalyze the palmitoylation
  of the protein at the Golgi. Then, the modified protein is trafficked to the plasma
  membrane. A protein acylthioesterase (APT) can catalyze the removal of the palmitoyl
  group, allowing for regulation of proteins between different cellular compartments.
  B) The SmgGDS-607 isoform and possibly a GEF-like protein may interact with an unmodified
  CaaX protein containing a polybasic region (PBR), promote GDP/GTP exchange, and
  allow the CaaX protein to enter the prenylation pathway. Once prenylated by GGTase-I
  or FTase, SmgGDS-558 may facilitate the release of the protein from the prenyltransferase
  and/or traffic the protein to the ER where it is subsequently proteolyzed and methylated.
  SmgGDS-558 may also transport the fully processed prenylated protein to and from
  the plasma membrane.
