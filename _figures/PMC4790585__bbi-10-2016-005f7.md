caption: The general role of the proteins used for in silico experiments. APC protein
  is a part of the complex that favors ubiquitination of β-catenin and thus its destruction
  and NKD2 inhibits the disruption, promoting the complex of β-catenin. Usually, when
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is inactive, ie, Wnt has not joined its FZD receptor,
  β-catenin linked to the degradation complex (Axin, APC, CKI, and GSK-β), and in
  the β complex, catenin is phosphorylated at residues 33, 35, 41 and 47. Then the
  protein is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. NKD2 inhibits
  the DVL, and DVL prevents β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation.
