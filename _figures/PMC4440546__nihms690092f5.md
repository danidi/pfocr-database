caption: Both internal and external signals can influence alternative splicing through
  post-transcriptional modification of specific splicing regulators as illustrated,
  which may modulate both protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions to produce
  a network response to affect many regulated splicing events. In terms of signal
  transduction pathways, the SR protein system seems to have a dedicated pathway through
  SR protein kinases (SRPKs) and CDC-like kinases (CLKs) in the cytoplasm and the
  nucleus, respectively. These kinases are responsible for controlling the phosphorylation
  state of SR proteins to modulate their activities in splicing. Various phosphatases
  may be also involved to antagonize the activity of these splicing kinases. EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; FASTK, Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase;
  GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; hnRNP A1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein
  A1; IGFR, insulin-like growth factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  p38 is a MAPK involved in the DNA damage response; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; PSF,
  PTB (polypyrimidine-tract binding protein)-associated splicing factor; RBP, RNA-binding
  protein; TCR, T cell receptor; TIA 1, nucleolysin TIA 1 isoform p40; TNFL6, tumour
  necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 6 (also known as FasL).
