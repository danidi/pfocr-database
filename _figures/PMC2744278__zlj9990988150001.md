caption: Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are activated
  by receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases through several mechanisms. (A) The
  receptor-associated Janus family tyrosine kinases (JAKs) are activated on cytokine-receptor
  binding through cross-phosphorylation in the classical pathway. Activated JAKs phosphorylate
  tyrosine residues on the receptor (R), which become docking elements for cytoplasmic
  STAT proteins. STATs are subsequently phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue
  in the carboxy (COOH) -terminal portion and form homo- or heterodimers through reciprocal
  interaction between the phosphotyrosine of one STAT and the Schmidt-Ruppin A-2 viral
  oncogene homolog (avian) (SRC) -homology-2 (SH2) domain of another. Dimerized STATs
  shift into the nucleus via importins to induce target gene transcription by binding
  to specific regulatory elements. (B) Receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities
  (RTK), including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR), and FMS (formerly McDonough feline sarcoma viral oncogene
  homolog) -related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), may directly activate STATs without
  involvement of JAKs. (C) STATs can be phosphorylated by constitutively active nonreceptor
  protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as SRC and BCR-ABL. (D) Unphosphorylated STATs
  can independently enter the nucleus to mediate gene transcription possibly by acting
  as a transcriptional coregulator to bind DNA. IL-6, interleukin-6; P, phosphorus.

  description: Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are
    activated by receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases through several mechanisms.
    (A) The receptor-associated Janus family tyrosine kinases (JAKs) are activated
    on cytokine-receptor binding through cross-phosphorylation in the classical pathway.
    Activated JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor (R), which become
    docking elements for cytoplasmic STAT proteins. STATs are subsequently phosphorylated
    on a single tyrosine residue in the carboxy (COOH) -terminal portion and form
    homo- or heterodimers through reciprocal interaction between the phosphotyrosine
    of one STAT and the Schmidt-Ruppin A-2 viral oncogene homolog (avian) (SRC) -homology-2
    (SH2) domain of another. Dimerized STATs shift into the nucleus via importins
    to induce target gene transcription by binding to specific regulatory elements.
    (B) Receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities (RTK), including platelet-derived
    growth factor receptor (PDGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and FMS
    (formerly McDonough feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) -related tyrosine kinase
    3 (FLT3), may directly activate STATs without involvement of JAKs. (C) STATs can
    be phosphorylated by constitutively active nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases
    (PTKs), such as SRC and BCR-ABL. (D) Unphosphorylated STATs can independently
    enter the nucleus to mediate gene transcription possibly by acting as a transcriptional
    coregulator to bind DNA. IL-6, interleukin-6; P, phosphorus.
