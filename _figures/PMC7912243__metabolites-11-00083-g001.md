caption: 'Methionine metabolism. Overview of the methionine cycle and other tightly
  coupled metabolic pathways. In green the methionine cycle, which quickly converts
  methionine to S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) to generate methylation potential for the
  cell. Enzymes in the methionine cycle: MAT2A (methionine adenosyl transferase),
  SAM1/2 (SAM synthetase), Methyltransferases (MTs), SAHH (SAH hydrolase), HMT (Homocysteine
  methyltransferase). SAM is the primary methyl-group donor and is required for epigenetic
  regulation and other methylation-controlled processes. In red the methionine salvage
  pathway: SAM is also required for the synthesis of polyamines. Byproducts of this
  pathway are recycled to regenerate methionine. In blue the transsulfuration pathway:
  Homocysteine is converted to cysteine, which feeds into the generation of glutathione
  (GSH) and taurine to maintain the redox balance in the cell. In yellow the sulfate
  assimilation pathway: Most fungi are able to generate methionine from absorbed sulfate.
  This process is energy demanding and consumes 2 ATP and 4 NADPH molecules per one
  molecule of methionine.'
