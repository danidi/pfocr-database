caption: Intermittent metabolic switching (IMS) involves repeating time periods of
  a bioenergetic challenge (fasting and/or exercise) when the metabolic switch is
  on (that is, liver glycogen stores are depleted and ketones are produced) and recovery
  periods (eating, resting and sleeping) when the metabolic switch is off. When the
  metabolic switch is on, levels of circulating ketones, ghrelin and myokines are
  elevated, whereas levels of glucose, leptin, insulin and pro-inflammatory cytokines
  are maintained at low levels. Adaptive responses of neurons to fasting and exercise
  include utilization of ketones as an energy substrate; increased expression of brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2); activation of
  the transcription factors cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), which induce the expression
  of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis;
  and upregulation of autophagy and DNA repair pathways. During the bioenergetic challenge,
  activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; also known as serine/threonine-protein
  kinase mTOR (MTOR) and mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway and global protein
  synthesis are reduced in neurons, and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the
  brain are reduced. Collectively, the pathways activated when the metabolic switch
  is on enhance neuronal stress resistance and bolster repair and recycling of damaged
  molecules. When the metabolic switch is off, circulating levels of glucose, leptin,
  insulin and pro-inflammatory cytokines increase, whereas levels of ketones, ghrelin
  and myokines decrease. In brain cells, the mTOR pathway is active, protein synthesis
  increases and mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during the recovery period. The activation
  state of neurotrophic signalling and adaptive cellular stress-response pathways
  may decrease when the metabolic switch is off. Cycles of IMS may optimize brain
  health by promoting synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, improving cognition, mood,
  motor performance and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and bolstering resistance
  of neurons to injury and neurodegenerative disease. SIRT, NAD-dependent protein
  deacetylase sirtuin.

  description: Intermittent metabolic switching (IMS) involves repeating time periods
    of a bioenergetic challenge (fasting and/or exercise) when the metabolic switch
    is on (that is, liver glycogen stores are depleted and ketones are produced) and
    recovery periods (eating, resting and sleeping) when the metabolic switch is off.
    When the metabolic switch is on, levels of circulating ketones, ghrelin and myokines
    are elevated, whereas levels of glucose, leptin, insulin and pro-inflammatory
    cytokines are maintained at low levels. Adaptive responses of neurons to fasting
    and exercise include utilization of ketones as an energy substrate; increased
    expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor
    2 (FGF2); activation of the transcription factors cAMP-responsive element-binding
    protein (CREB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α
    (PGC1α), which induce the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity,
    neurogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis; and upregulation of autophagy and DNA
    repair pathways. During the bioenergetic challenge, activity of the mammalian
    target of rapamycin (mTOR; also known as serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR
    (MTOR) and mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway and global protein synthesis
    are reduced in neurons, and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain
    are reduced. Collectively, the pathways activated when the metabolic switch is
