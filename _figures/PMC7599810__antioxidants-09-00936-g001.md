caption: 'Molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 virus can bind to specific
  receptors in host cells, such as alveolar epithelial cells or immune cells, by mediating
  an inflammatory cascade through inflammasome activation, usually through NLRP3,
  and by damaging, or even killing, host cells. Immune host cells, like macrophages
  and monocytes, are activated by the virus on a direct or indirect pathway, and contribute
  to the host response by causing inflammation and a cytokine storm. Other immune
  cells, such as NK cells and T-cells, can contribute to the immune response. On the
  other hand, Ang II is processed by ACE2 into Ang I-7. Ang II contributes to ROS
  production in an NAD(P)H-dependent mechanism thanks to the ACE2–Ang-(1–7)–Mas axis.
  AT1R mediates the production of ROS through a mechanism dependent on NADH and NADPH
  oxidases. ROS contributes to nuclear factor-kB (NF-κB) and TXNIP overexpression.
  NF-κB increases the expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-18, and pro-IL-1β whilst TXNIP modulates
  the structure of NLRP3, thereby allowing NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and facilitating
  pro-caspase-1 (pro-casp-1) autocleavage. Arrows denote activation. ACE2: angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; GM-CSF: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; TNF: Tumor Necrosis
  Factor; INFγ: Interferon gamma; IL-R: Interleukin Receptor; AT1R: Angiotensin type
  1; NADPH oxidase: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; ROS: reactive
  oxygen species. TXNIP: thioredoxin interacting/inhibiting protein. This figure is
  adapted from the work of Merad et al. [].'
