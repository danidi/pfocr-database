caption: Immune responses to protein antigens involve the formation of germinal centres
  (GCs) within B cell follicles, in which activated B cells undergo clonal expansion
  and a series of differentiation events, which leads to the generation of antibody-secreting
  plasma cells or memory B cells. The initial step of GC formation involves interactions
  between antigen-primed T cells and B cells on the border of the T cell zone and
  the B cell follicle, which are required for differentiation of the CD4+ T cells
  into follicular helper T (TFH) cells. The T cell–B cell interaction is initiated
  through TCR interaction with the MHC–antigen complex and also requires the ICOS–ICOSL
  interaction. Ligation of CD40 and BAFFR by their ligands, CD40L and BAFF, induces
  non-canonical NF-κB signalling in B cells, which is important for maintaining high
  levels of ICOSL expression and, thus, TFH cell differentiation. TFH cells, in turn,
  promote the clonal expansion and differentiation of B cells in the subsequent steps
  of GC reactions. Non-canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling regulates GC
  reactions through promoting the survival of naive B cells, the differentiation of
  TFH cells by inducing the expression of inducible co-stimulator ligand (ICOSL) in
  B cells, GC cell expansion, GC B cell survival, immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching,
  somatic hypermutation (SHM) and plasma cell survival,,,–,. In addition, non-canonical
  NF-κB signalling also functions in stromal cells to mediate the induction of chemokines
  required for the formation of B cell follicles and the follicular dendritic cell
  network, which in turn are crucial for GC formation (not shown in Figure). BAFF,
  B cell activating factor; BAFFR, BAFF receptor; BCR, B cell receptor; CXCR5, CXC-chemokine
