caption: Schematic presentation of Nrf2-ARE pathway. In the cytoplasm, under basal
  level, newly synthesized Nrf2 is constitutively bound to Keap1 forming a dimer,
  Nrf2-Keap1. Keap1 is a cytosolic protein that inhibits Nrf2 signalling by promoting
  Nrf2 degradation through proteasomal pathway. When oxidants such as ROS, RNS and
  dietary chemopreventive compounds react with redox reactive cysteines in Keap1,
  Nrf2 will be released from Keap1, hence allowing the transcriptional factor Nrf2
  to translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 dimerizes with basic leucine
  zipper partners (bZip) such as small MAF-family proteins and bind to ARE, which
  is located in the promoter of the phase II and antioxidative genes, triggering the
  transcription of ARE-regulated genes. The critical role of Nrf2 in protecting cells/subjects
  from neoplastic transformation when subject to oxidative stress and carcinogens
  is performed by enhancing the expression of detoxifying metabolizing enzymes and
  maintaining oxidative stress homeostasis by producing antioxidant enzymes. Application
  of chemopreventive compounds can further enhance the expression of phase II detoxifying
  and antioxidant enzymes by up-regulating the Nrf2-ARE expression.
