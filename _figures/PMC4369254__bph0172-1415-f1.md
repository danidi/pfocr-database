caption: NO signalling and metabolic syndrome-related pathways. ROS generated by NADPH
  oxidases and other sources (e.g. mitochondria, XO, uncoupled NOS, among others)
  leads to increased NF-κB activity followed by eNOS and iNOS up-regulation. eNOS
  produces NO which prevents activation of both NADPH oxidase and NF-κB. The leptin/STAT3
  pathway may also up-regulate the gene for iNOS whereas the leptin/JAK2/IRS-1 pathway
  increases eNOS activity via Akt stimulation, as does insulin. Increased circulating
  free fatty acids lead to ceramide elevation with increasing effects on NADPH oxidase
  activity and diminishing effects on Akt activation. NO produced by neuronal NOS
  (nNOS) and putative mtNOS may affect heart function in metabolic syndrome by different
  specific routes.
