caption: Protumorigenic effects of TNF-α in breast cancer. a TNF-α promotes growth,
  migration and invasion of diverse breast cancer cell lines (4,5,21). b TNF-α stimulates
  the expression of miRNA-23b and miRNA-27b through the AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway,
  inhibiting Nischarin, a suppressor of tumor growth. TNF-α also stimulates the expression
  of MMP-9. All of this is associated with poor prognosis and cell invasion in HER2
  and triple negative breast cancer cells (24, 29). c Blocking m/sTNF-α activity with
  the antibody infliximab directed against TNF-α receptor (TNFR) slows tumor growth,
  induces tumor regression and inhibits bone metastases in mice, highlighting TNF-α
  tumorigenic effects (23). d Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment might result
  from TNF-α inflammatory activity (57). e TNFα-activated mesenchimal stromal cells
  (MSCs) enhanced tumor metastasis via neutrophil recruitment (22)
