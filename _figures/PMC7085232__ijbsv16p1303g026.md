caption: Schematic representation of the proposed anti-apoptotic signaling pathways
  triggered by ALDH2 in ischemic neurons. Cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury caused
  ALDH2 downregulation, leading to an increase in mitochondrial ROS (mROS) production.
  ROS served as a potential inducer of JNK. Then, activated JNK initiated the pro-apoptotic
  Cyt-C leakage from mitochondria into cytoplasm, launching the caspase-9 related
  mitochondrial apoptosis. Meanwhile, phosphorylated JNK was also bound to the caspase-3
  promoter, leading to caspase-3 transcriptional activation. However, recovery of
  ALDH2 activity could cut off the excessive mROS and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis,
  providing prosurvival advantages for the brain in the context of ischemic injury.
