caption: Schematic representation of receptors and signaling pathways mainly contributing
  to anti‐inflammatory polarization of microglia. Stimulation of histamine receptors
  H1R and H4R induces persistent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, that leads to pNF‐κB downregulation
  and reduces the expression of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), dampening pro‐inflammatory
  responses. Similarly, the endocannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) induces sustained
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation causing pNF‐κB downregulation. GABA receptors are also involved
  in reducing microglia reactivity through the activation of NOX4. The nicotinic α7
  receptor decreases pNF‐κB and its p65 subunit and inhibits p38‐MAPK. Blocking the
  voltage independent KCa3.1 channels and the voltage‐gated Kv1.3 also results in
  inhibition of p38‐MAPK pathway and of iNOS and COX expression. IL‐10, upon binding
  of its receptor, suppresses pro‐inflammatory cytokine production through induction
  of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)1 and (SOCS)3 proteins. These proteins,
  in turn, inhibit the cytokine‐activated Janus kinase (JAK)/ STAT‐1 signaling pro‐inflammatory
  pathway. The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) 3 is instead induced by the activation of sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P) receptors
  through its ligand FTY720, resulting in attenuation of microglia‐mediated neuroinflammation.
  NGF, through activation of Trk‐A receptor, reduces cytokine/chemokine secretion,
  microglia motility, phagocytosis, and degradative pathways. The activation of the
  tyrosine kinase AXL receptor by pro‐resolving lipid mediators suppresses the pro‐inflammatory
  microglial phenotype by dampening type I interferon (IFN) signaling. The melanocortins
  α‐MSH and NDP‐MSH, through G protein‐coupled receptors, enhance PPAR‐γ, and Arg1
  expression and promote IL‐10 release. Upon stimulation with IL‐4, IL‐4 receptor
  (IL‐4R) induces activation of STAT‐6, with consequent increase in Arg1, mannose
  receptor CD206 and PPAR‐γ expression and with induction (and release) of anti‐inflammatory
  cytokines like IL‐4, IL‐10, IL‐13. For specific references see text
