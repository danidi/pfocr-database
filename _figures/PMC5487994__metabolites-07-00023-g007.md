caption: Upregulation of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway by compound
  3b in HepG2 cells leading to increased ribose synthesis. PAR means peak area ratio
  (relative concentration). Horizontal lines represent medians. n.s. means not statistically
  significantly different; *** means p < 0.001; and **** means p < 0.0001.
