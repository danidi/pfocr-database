caption: Notch signaling on T cells. Antigen-presenting cells provide multiple signals
  required for full T cell activation, including MHC-peptide complex (signal 1), costimulatory/coinhibitory
  signals (signal 2) and signal 3 that includes cytokines and ligand-receptor interactions
  such as Notch signaling. Notch signaling is initiated by ligand binding to the receptor,
  which subsequently undergoes two successive proteolytic cleavages, leading to the
  intracellular release of Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Once NICD is released,
  it may either combine with RBPJ and other coactivators such as MAML1-3 (A) and induce
  transcriptional expression of downstream target genes (canonical pathway), or it
  may bind to NF-κB (B) in a non-RBPJ dependent manner (non-canonical pathways). The
  ultimate fate of the T cell will depend on the combination of these signals with
  Notch playing a critical role on this process. For simplification, different Notch
  ligands and receptors as well as additional cofactors and binding partners of NICD
  were not depicted. MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T cell receptor;
  RBPJ, recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa j region, MAML,
  mastermind-like; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B.
