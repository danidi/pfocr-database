caption: Glucose entering the cell is immediately phosphorylated by Hexokinase 2 (HK2),
  producing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). G6P can enter both glycolysis and the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). Expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) promotes the ATP-free
  conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by a currently unknown enzyme,
  which may prevent ATP-mediated inhibition of glycolysis. Citrate is exported from
  the mitochondrial TCA cycle to fuel the fatty acid synthesis pathway by conversion
  to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA) initiates
  the first committed step to fatty acid synthesis to produce malonyl-CoA. Seven malonyl-CoA
  molecules are added to acetyl-CoA by fatty acid synthase (FASN) to produce palmitic
  acid (16:0). Palmitic acid can be further elongated to stearic acid (18:0) and desaturated
  by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) to produce oleic acid (18:1). Citrate may also
  be recycled to produce NADPH for fatty acid synthesis by malic enzyme (ME1), which
  produces pyruvate, or by cytosolic aconitase (ACO1) followed by cytosolic isocitrate
  dehydrogenase (IDH1) to produce α-ketoglutarate. Glutamine can be converted to α-ketoglutarate
  upon entering the cell, to replenish TCA cycle intermediates or fuel fatty acid
  synthesis. The reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH),
  a critical reductant for fatty acid synthase (FASN), is produced from the activity
  of the PPP, ME1, and IDH.
