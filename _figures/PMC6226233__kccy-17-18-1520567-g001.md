caption: 'Models depicting the recruitment of BLM, FANCJ and other DNA repair proteins
  to double-strand breaks. A, Homologous recombination repair. Early recruitment:
  Early responders including the MRN complex recruit to the DSB and activate ATM during
  S or G2 phases of the cell cycle. 1) ATM is activated by autophosphorylation which
  in-turn can amplify MRN-mediated signaling. MRN with its protein partner CTIP begin
  resection at the DSB, thereby initiating DSB repair by HR. 2) BLM is recruited to
  the DSB along with BRCA1 and FANCJ. It is unclear whether FANCJ and BRCA1 form a
  complex in solution before recruitment to the DSB or interact at the DSB. The interaction
  between FANCJ-BRCA1 and BLM may potentiate DSB repair by the HR pathway. 3) The
  short DNA overhangs created by the MRE11 nuclease of the MRN complex are stabilized
  by RPA. Late recruitment: Long 5ʹ strand resection occurs through the BLM-DNA2 or
  EXO1 pathway. FANCJ may functionally interact with BLM and MRE11 leading to the
  formation of RPA nucleated stable 3ʹ ssDNA. 1) The long RPA filament is replaced
  by RAD51 and this replacement is facilitated by BRCA2. Both BLM and FANCJ can negatively
  regulate HR by inhibiting RAD51 interaction with ssDNA filaments. Further, BLM’s
  retention at the DNA is aided by ubiquitylation, which is important for interaction
  of NBS1 with the MRN complex. B, Non-homologous end-joining. Early recruitment:
  Early responders including ATM and the MRN complex recruit to the DSB and set up
  a cascade for NHEJ during any phase of the cell cycle. 1) Upon detection of DSBs,
  ATM becomes phosphorylated and in turn phosphorylates other proteins functioning
  later in NHEJ. 2) The recruitment of DNA-PKcs followed by KU 70/80 complex at DSBs
  displaces MRN complex and initiates NHEJ. 3) BLM and potentially FANCJ may be recruited
  at this stage. Late recruitment: Whether BLM and FANCJ interact to modulate NHEJ
  is an important area of investigation. 1) BLM regulates the recruitment of the repair
  protein XRCC4 which enhances the joining activity of LIG4.'
