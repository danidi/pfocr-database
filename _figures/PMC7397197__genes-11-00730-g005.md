caption: Nonautonomous replication stress response in the central nervous system.
  The detection of self-nucleotides (ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA) in the cytoplasm can trigger
  the activation of two main proinflammatory signaling pathways. Cytoplasmic DNA may
  be recognized by cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which leads to the activation of
  Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) that may activate TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)
  and, consequently, its downstream targets IRF3 and NF-κB. These may stimulate the
  transcription of type I interferons (IFN), interleukin (IL)-6, and the tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF), among other proinflammatory factors. The AIM2 inflammasome also recognizes
  dsDNA (foreign or self) and activates caspase-1, leading to the maturation and/or
  externalization of proinflammatory interleukins (e.g., IL-1β and IL-18). The activation
  of this pathway can lead to pyroptosis. In the CNS, the activation of both pathways
  was reported in the microglia of Atm knockout mice. The cGAS-STING-mediated activation
  of microglia and an increased cytokine secretion were associated with chronic inflammation
  and neuronal cell death in the context of cerebellar neurodegeneration. The pronounced
  activation of AIM2 inflammasome in the context of DNA damage was also reported in
  the developing CNS. The inactivation of AIM2 decreased the developmental cell death
  and impacted adult mice behaviors. Whether the endogenous replication stress of
  NPCs contributes to the activation of AIM2 inflammasome remains to be determined.
