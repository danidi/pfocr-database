caption: 'Canonical Hippo pathway complexes act to phosphorylate Yki or YAP/TAZ and
  prevent assembly of the Sd or TEAD transcriptional complexes with MASK. Phosphorylated
  YAP/TAZ is cytoplasmically retained by 14-3-3σ and targeted for degradation. Similar
  coloration is used to highlight the level of homology and conservation of the pathway
  between Drosophila and mammals. Note: This schematic is simplified to clarify the
  major components in Hippo pathway.'
