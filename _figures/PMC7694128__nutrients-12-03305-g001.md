caption: Inorganic arsenic metabolism pathway as proposed by Challenger, 1947. Inorganic
  arsenic metabolism occurs in the liver, by a series of oxidative methylation and
  reduction steps. Methylation occurs using the arsenic-3-methyltransferase (AS3MT)
  enzyme, and methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).
