caption: Schematic representation of death receptor signaling. Engagement of death
  receptors by their cognate ligands triggers the recruitment of different adaptor
  proteins. Distinct pathways originate from the adaptor proteins. A classic proapoptotic
  pathway is initiated when the adaptor proteins recruit large amounts of the initiator
  caspases 8 and 10, resulting in their autoactivation. Active caspases 8 and 10 initiate
  a signaling cascade that results in activation of the effector caspases (caspases
  3, 6, and 7) either by directly processing the effector caspases themselves or by
  engaging the mitochondrial death pathway mediated by the cleavage of the BH3-only
  protein Bid. The release of proapoptotic proteins from the mitochondria, such as
  cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, ultimately promotes effector caspase activation and
  apoptosis. Several noncytotoxic signaling pathways can also originate from the association
  of adaptor proteins with the receptor, which generally results in the activation
  of MAPK- and/or NF-κB-mediated survival signals.
