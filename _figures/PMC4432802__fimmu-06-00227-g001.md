caption: Schematic representation of the principal pathways involved in glucose catabolism
  summarizing recent findings discussed in the Mini Review (red boxes). (1) 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,
  6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) has a key role in regulating endothelial cells (ECs)sprouting;
  (2) switching to aerobic glycolysis is important for trained immunity in monocytes;
  (3) contact-inhibited fibroblasts rely on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to
  produce NADPH; (4) GAPDH can function as an mRNA binding protein when not engaged
  in glycolysis, preventing the production of IFNγ; (5) succinate can act as intracellular
  signaling molecule, being involved in the production of IL-1β in BMDM; (6) Lactate
  secreted by cancer cells can act as extracellular signaling molecule, inducing the
  differentiation of macrophages into tumor-associated macrophages.
