caption: Enzymes involved in proximal pyruvate metabolism. Pyruvate plays an essential
  role in central carbon metabolism. Pyruvate is generated from several sources, including
  the oxidation of lactate, the transamination of alanine, or as the terminal product
  of glycolysis. Entry of pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix is mediated by the
  MPC. Once in the matrix, pyruvate can be converted to acetyl-CoA or oxaloacetate.
  Oxaloacetate can enter the citric acid cycle to replenish intermediates, or be converted
  to phosphoenolpyruvate as part of the gluconeogenic pathway. Phosphoenolpyruvate
  can be formed from oxaloacetate by PEPCK within the mitochondria or within the cytoplasm.
  The molecular structures of pyruvate and related metabolites, as well the names
  of the enzymes involved in their catalysis, are shown. PK pyruvate kinase, LDH lactate
  dehydrogenase, ALT alanine aminotransferase, MPC mitochondrial pyruvate carrier,
  PDH pyruvate dehydrogenase, CoA Coenzyme A, IMS mitochondrial inner membrane space,
  PEPCK phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
