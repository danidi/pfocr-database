caption: Microbiome–gut–brain axis in relation to AD. In our studies, a serial experiments
  and analysis were carried out to explore the connections between gut and CNS through
  metabolic and endocrine pathways. XAN could exert its therapeutic effect by affecting
  the amino acids metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and purine metabolism
  via gut–metabolic–AD pathway. Simultaneously, XAN could also result in the significant
  changes of phenylalanine metabolism and finally affect the levels of dopamine and
  other endogenous substances, which were established as gut–endocrine–AD signaling
  pathway.
