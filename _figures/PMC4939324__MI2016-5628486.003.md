caption: Anti-inflammatory mechanisms of MFG-E8 in a LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway. (a)
  Apoptotic cell-dependent anti-inflammatory role of MFG-E8. MFG-E8 mediates the phagocytosis
  of apoptotic cells, leading to the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production
  through the inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. (b) Apoptotic cell-independent
  anti-inflammatory role of MFG-E8. MFG-E8 binds with integrin α vβ 3/α vβ 5 and induces
  STAT3-mediated SOCS3 activation, leading to the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, thereby suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
