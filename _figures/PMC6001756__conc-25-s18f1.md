caption: 'Estrogen receptor (ER) signalling pathway. (a) Classic ER signalling leads
  to genomic function through estrogen ligand–receptor binding, leading to dimerization
  of ERs that complex with co-activators (CoA) and co-repressors and that then bind
  to specific DNA sites called estrogen response elements (EREs), which in turn regulate
  gene expression. The ER can also bind to other transcription factors, such as activation
  protein 1 (Ap1) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1), and functions as co-regulator to
  facilitate binding to serum response elements (SREs) and activate transcription.
  (b) The ER can also be activated through downstream events of receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGRF), human epidermal growth
  factor receptor 2 (HER2, ERBB2), insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR)], which
  is sometimes called ligand-independent ER receptor activation. (c) Nongenomic functions
  can be mediated by ER activation inducing the assembly of protein complexes that
  activate signalling cascades that ultimately lead to transcription factor activation
  independent of ER binding to DNA. This pathway can rapidly regulate cellular processes
  through interaction with various signalling pathways including (d) ER–phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)–Src–focal adhesion kinase (FAK) complex that activates AKT, and
  (e) ER–Src–proline-, glutamate-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) complexes that
  activate ERK. (Adapted with permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd.: Musgrove
