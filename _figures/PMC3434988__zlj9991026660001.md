caption: The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)–cMET axis signaling network and ongoing
  targeted therapy strategies. The pathway, which transduces invasive growth signals
  from mesenchymal to epithelial cells (secreted by mesenchymal cells), is activated
  by HGFA and binds to the cMET receptor on epithelial cells. cMET kinase activation
  results in trans-autophosphorylation and binding of adaptor proteins, forming scaffolds
  for recruitment and activation of signaling proteins. Signals generated from these
  structures lead to activation of signaling pathways related to increased proliferation,
  survival, motility, invasiveness, and stimulation of angiogenesis. EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GRB2, growth factor receptor–bound
  protein 2; HER, human epidermal growth factor receptor; mTOR, mammalian target of
  rapamycin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RAS, renin–angiotensin system; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription.
