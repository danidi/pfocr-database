caption: 'The calcineurin–NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) pathway and its
  possible regulation by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In resting cells, NFAT
  resides in the cytoplasm, where it is maintained in a phosphorylated, inactive state.
  Stimulation of cell-surface receptors coupled to phospholipase C (PLC) results in
  calcium mobilisation, initially from intracellular stores, followed by influx of
  Ca2+ through specialised voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) and Ca2+ release-activated
  Ca2+ channels (CRAC). Upon activation by Ca2+, the phosphatase calcineurin dephosphorylates
  NFAT, triggering its activation and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, NFAT
  interacts with other transcription factors, including activator protein (AP)-1,
  to stimulate gene expression. When NFAT is re-phosphorylated it is exported back
  to the cytoplasm. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A inhibits calcineurin
  interactions with all its substrates, whereas VIVIT selectively inhibits NFAT activation.
  VIP appears to inhibit this pathway, but its mechanism of action has yet to be determined.
