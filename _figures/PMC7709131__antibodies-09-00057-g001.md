caption: The complement system schematic summary. The classical pathway is activated
  by the binding of the C1 complex to immunoglobulins or endogenous ligand. The lectin
  pathway is analogous to the classical one but its activation is triggered by the
  fixation of the MBL-MASP complex to the pathogen surface. The alternative pathway
  is spontaneously initiated by the tick-over mechanism and can be amplified in case
  of recognition of an unprotected surface by complement regulators. These pathways
  will lead to the formation of the C3 convertase, an enzymatic complex able to cleave
  C3 into the anaphylatoxin C3a and C3b. The assemblage of a C3b molecule to the C3
  convertase is at the origin of the C5 convertase. The C5 molecule can then be cleaved
  into the anaphylatoxin C5a and C5b, the latter initiating the terminal pathway.
  The complement cascade culminates with the formation of the multimeric Membrane
  Attack Complex (MAC, C5b-9) leading to cell activation or death. The complement
  system is very powerful in triggering inflammation, phagocytosis, opsonization or
  also lysis, therefore it is tightly regulated at each step by soluble regulators
  (C1 inhibitor, Factor I (FI), C4 Binding Protein (C4BP), Factor H (FH), Properdin
  (FP) clusterin, vitronectin) or membrane proteins (Complement Receptor 1 (CD35,
  CR1), Membrane Cofactor Protein (CD46, MCP), Decay acceleration Factor (CD55, DAF),
  CD59). The figure is created with BioRender.com.
