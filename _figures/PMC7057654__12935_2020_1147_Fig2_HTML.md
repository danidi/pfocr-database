caption: Vaccinations can inhibit the release of various pro-tumor cytokines. Programmed
  death-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibits the antitumor effects of Dendritic cell (DC) immunization
  and regulates regulatory T cells (Treg) which as a result upregulate IL-10 and IL-2
  as well as downregulate IFN-γ. 2) ARF6/AMAP1 signaling pathway is closely correlated
  with the intracellular recycling of PD-L1. Inhibition of ARF6/AMAP1 can reduce PD-L1
  cell surface expression. 3) Tumor antigens in PC such as telomerase, enolase, WT1,
  and mesothelin can stimulate cancer-specific T-cell responses. For example, CD4+
  and CD8+ T cells that specifically target mesothelin can be enhanced by vaccination.
  4) Vaccines such as live attenuated bacteria expressing mesothelin (CRS-207) and
  GM-CSF transduced allogeneic whole tumor cell vaccine (GVAX) can improve the immune
  system in PC by stimulating anti-tumor T cell infiltration. (+) Promote (−) Inhibit
