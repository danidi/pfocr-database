caption: A scheme illustrating the lactate shuttling pathway in glycolytic and oxidative
  cancer cells. Glycolytic cancer cells (Left), dependent on glucose uptake via glucose
  transporters (GLUTs), undergo glycolysis to produce pyruvate and ATP, in which pyruvate
  undergoes further metabolism into lactate via lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Proton
  symport-mediated lactate efflux occurs by MCT4. In oxidative cancer cells (Right),
  proton symport-mediated lactate influx and efflux occurs by MCT1. In these cells,
  lactate is transformed into pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) with the
  generation of NADH as a byproduct. These two metabolic products are then incorporated
  into the TCA cycle in mitochondria, to supplement the production of ATP via the
  oxidative phosphorylation pathway. This figure and caption was adapted from Perez-Escuredo
  et al.
