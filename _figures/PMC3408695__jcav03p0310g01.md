caption: 'Part of the metabolic pathway of estradiol and the role of various enzymes
  involved: Estradiol is metabolized into 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) and 4-hdroxyestradiol
  (4-OHE2) by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 respectively. These catechols undergo further oxidation
  into semiquinones and quinones that react with DNA to form depurinating adducts
  leading to mutations associated with breast cancer. NQO1 reduces these quinones
  back to catechols which are detoxified into methoxy derivatives by the action of
  COMT. This protects the cells against DNA adducts formation and lowers the potential
  for mutagenic damage.'
