caption: Vascular smooth muscle contraction pathway. Genes belonging to the vascular
  smooth muscle contraction pathway were significantly overrepresented and upregulated
  in normal tissue (15/36 genes, p < 0.0001). None of the genes of the smooth muscle
  cell membrane (according to KEGG pathways) were overexpressed in SQ, SCLC, and mesothelioma.
  Red indicates significantly overexpression, dark green significant downregulation,
  and light green no differential expression. COID, carcinoids; AD, adenocarcinoma;
  SCLC, small- cell lung cancer; SQ, squamous cell lung cancer; MESO, mesothelioma.
