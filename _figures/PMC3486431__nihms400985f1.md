caption: 'Oxidative and NF-kB pathways are highly interactive in DMD muscle collaborating
  to produce muscle fiber necrosis. Macrophages generate inflammatory cytokines and
  reactive oxidative species (ROS) are the direct consequence of dystrophin deficiency
  and membrane instability. The illustration shows a macrophage with activated NF-κB
  leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules, TNF-α, IL-1 & IL-6. A dystrophic
  muscle fiber shows reactive oxygen species generated by multiple insults to the
  muscle fiber: 1) Ca2+ influx through muscle membrane related to membrane fragility
  leads to Ca2+ overload in the mitochondria and energy deficiency; 2) increased NADPH
  oxidase activity known to accompany dystrophin deficiency adds to ROS generation
  which in turn stimulates stretch-activated channels (SAC) resulting in Ca2+ entry
  into muscle fiber further contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction; 3) ROS exacerbates
  the dystrophic pathology by peroxidation of the lipid bilayer of the muscle membrane.
  ROS provokes the NF-κB signaling pathway leading to production of TNF-α and other
  cytokines. Moreover, TNF-α produced by activated macrophages enhances NF-κB activation
  in the muscle.'
