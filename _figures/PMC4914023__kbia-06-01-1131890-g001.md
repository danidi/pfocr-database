caption: Melanosome biogenesis is a typical model for studying LRO biogenesis. The
  biogenesis of melanosomes begins in early endosomes (Stage I) where the amyloidogenic
  fibrillar protein PMEL is internalized and forms fibrils (Stage II, not shown).
  Further, the melanin-synthesising proteins TYRP1 (BLOC-1-dependent cargo, orange
  symbols) and TYR (AP-3-dependent cargo, blue symbols) were delivered from tubular-vesicular
  structures of recycling endosomes to maturing Stage II (not shown) or Stage III
  melanosomes. Upon cargo transport and melanin synthesis, Stage III melanosomes mature
  into Stage IV melanosomes. The cargo transport to maturing melanosomes is possibly
  mediated by the pairing of cytosolic SNARE domains of STX13 (Qa SNARE, green) and
  2 other unknown SNAREs (Qb, Qc; black) on recycling endosomes with the SNARE domain
  of VAMP7 (R-SNARE, black) on Stage III or Stage II (not shown) melanosomes. Moreover,
  the current studies suggest that BLOC-2, Rab9A, BLOC-3, Rab38/32 and VARP molecules
  modulate the STX13-mediated cargo delivery to melanosomes, possibly functioning
  during membrane fusion. In contrast, BLOC-1 and AP-3 possibly function at early
  steps of cargo transport or sorting, respectively. Curved arrows represent the SNARE-mediated
  fusion of endosomal transport carriers with melanosomes. The dotted black arrow
  indicates the possible route of melanosome secretion, and the dotted gray arrows
  represent the different routes of the endocytic pathway. The solid black lines in
  the Stage III melanosome represent the PMEL fibrils. The question marks indicate
  the roles of those molecules that need to be validated in future studies. EE, early
  endosome and PM, plasma membrane.
