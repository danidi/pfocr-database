caption: Schematic drawing of the suggested intracellular signaling pathways of LIF
  and OSM receptors in osteoblasts mediating expression of osteoclastogenic factors,
  osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Common LIFR/OSMR signaling pathways induced
  by JAK-mediated phosphorylation of the signal transducer gp130 involve activation
  of STAT3, as well as activation of JNK through a possible SHP2/Ras/Raf/MAPK cascade
  (Left). The figure indicates that LIF binds to the LIFR. As discussed in the Introduction
  section, 2nd paragraph, OSM can also bind to the LIFR to regulate sclerostin expression.
  In addition to the gp130-mediated pathways common for LIFR and OSMR, the OSM receptor
  has previously been shown to activate a Shc1-mediated pathway where phosphorylation
  of the OSMR on Tyr861 results in docking and phosphorylation of the adapter molecule
  Shc1 (, ). The activated pShc1 is recruited to the Grb2:SoS complex which in turn
  induces a Ras/Raf/MAPK cascade that ultimately activates ERK. The Shc1-mediated
  signaling pathway (Right) is suggested to explain the stronger effects by OSM on
  expression of osteoclastogenic factors, osteoclast formation and bone resorption
  in comparison to activation of the LIFR:gp130 complex by LIF.
