caption: Signaling pathways frequently deregulated in MDS. The transmembrane receptors
  Fas (CD95), TNFR1, TNFR2, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR)
  and their associated signal transducers are frequently overexpressed and/or constitutively
  activated in MDS. Fas/CD95 is specifically engaged by Fas-L/CD95L, which induces
  caspase-dependent cell death by activating the initiator caspase-8 via its FAS-associated
  death domain (FADD). TNFR1 and TNFR2 activate the adapter protein TNFR-associated
  death domain (TRADD), which in turn activates TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) to
  ultimately induce the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
  JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and/or p38 MAPK, the latter via the receptor-interacting
  protein (RIP). JNK induces the transcriptional activity of AP-1 and p38 MAPK, in
  turn, activates other transcription factors (TF) that carry out various functions.
  TNFR1/2 can also activate the transcription factor NF-κB via IκB kinase (IKK). In
  addition, TNFR1 can directly induce apoptosis through the death receptor pathway
  by activating FADD via TRADD, initiating caspase cleavage. TNFR2 lacks a death domain,
  so its functions are predominately pro-survival. After recognition of pathogen-
  or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively), TLRs signal
  through several specific adapter molecules that ultimately lead to the activation
  of AP-1, p38 MAPK and NF-κB. Lastly, IFN-γ initiates a transcriptional response
  mediated by the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT) pathway. The transcriptional programs activated by these
  receptors generally lead to the expression of genes involved in the innate immune
  response, survival and differentiation but may also lead to the transcription of
  pro-apoptotic genes.
