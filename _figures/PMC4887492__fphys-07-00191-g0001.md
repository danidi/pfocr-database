caption: A schematic model of metabolism, autophagy, and epigenetics in HSC-to-MFB
  transdifferentiation based on evolving research insights. In this model, quiescent
  HSC exposed to various stimuli transdifferentiate to activated HSC (MFB) and loose
  lipid droplets (LDs). Prior to or during transdifferentiation, transcription-level
  alterations modulate the expression of relevant metabolic, autophagy, and epigenetic
  mediators (?). Epigenetic modifiers (e.g., HDACs, DNMTs, MECP2, etc.) may determine,
  which transcriptional networks are switched on or off. In the transdifferentiated
  state, increased glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and antioxidant system
  as well as loss of LDs could synergize to sustain energy production (Hernández-Gea
  et al., ) and provide the metabolite pool for extracellular matrix (ECM) and collagen
  synthesis (?). In the activated state, MFB may rely on nutrients from accelerated
  de novo metabolism, microenvironment, or autophagic breakdown of organelles to sustain
  their function in fibrosis and inflammation, e.g., cytokine production. Microenvironmental
  factors may signal the end of healing by (a) activating antifibrotic epigenetic
  modifiers, (b) attenuating transcriptional activators of metabolism and autophagy,
  or (c) by inducing self-destructive autophagy in MFB (?). LPS, lipopolysaccharides;
  ?, unknown mechanisms.
