caption: Signaling pathways regulating dendritic spine actin remodeling with the induction
  of LTP by theta burst stimulation (TBS).Schematic of signaling pathways linking
  three classes of synaptic to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Neurotransmitter
  receptors (glutamate-receptors), integrins, and modulatory receptors including the
  A1 adenosine receptor, estrogen receptor beta (ERB) and the TrkB receptor for BDNF)
  are all activated by LTP-inducing theta burst stimulation and, in turn influence
  signaling cascades that influence the state of filamentous (F) actin within dendritic
  spines. As illustrated our studies have shown that the modulatory and integrin receptors
  regulate signaling through two pathways. The first, through the RhoA GTPase drives
  new actin polymerization whereas the second, through Cdc42/Rac>PAK, mediates stabilization
  of the new actin filaments. The downstream effectors of the latter pathway are not
  known but are likely to involve actin nucleating factors such as cortactin and Arp2/3,
  both of these are concentrated within dendritic spines and are influenced by TBS
  in adult tissue (grey lettering denotes elements which may influence these processes
  but have not been tested).
