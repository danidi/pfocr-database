caption: Schema of the migratory modes of the excitatory neurons during neocortical
  development and molecular mechanisms downstream of Reelin signaling that control
  neuronal migration. In the early developmental stages (Left), neurons generated
  from the radial glial cells undergo somal translocation, in which they extend processes
  to the MZ and shorten their leading processes to move their cell bodies to their
  final positions just beneath the MZ. During somal translocation, nectin-mediated
  activation of N-cadherin promotes cellular interaction between the neurons and the
  CR cells. In addition, n-cofilin expressed in the migrating neurons promotes anchoring
  of the leading processes to the MZ. N-cadherin also stabilizes the leading processes
  of the migrating neurons elongating into the MZ. In the later stages (Right), the
  neurons sequentially change their migratory modes. First, in the MAZ, they exhibit
  multipolar migration, in which they extend and retract multiple processes dynamically
  while their somata wander. Multipolar cells then transform into a bipolar morphology.
  Reelin signaling controls the multipolar-to-bipolar transition via the Rap1/N-cadherin
  pathway. N-cofilin-mediated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is involved in
  the radial migration of the neurons in the IZ. Bipolar neurons show locomotion,
  in which they directionally migrate in the IZ and CP using radial glial fibers as
  the scaffold. Finally, when they arrive at the outermost region of the CP, they
  switch to the terminal translocation mode, in which the somata move rapidly in a
  radial glia-independent manner to just beneath the MZ to complete migration. N-cadherin
  promotes neuronal accumulation in the PCZ. Reelin signaling activates integrin α5β1
  in the migrating neurons, causing them to adhere to the fibronectin localized in
  the MZ. LIMK1/n-cofilin and integrin α5β1/fibronectin promote anchoring of the leading
  processes to the MZ.
