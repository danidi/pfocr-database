caption: The role of dormancy in metastasis and chemoresistance of cancer cells. (a)
  Dormancy-regulated metastasis affected by the balance between p38 and ERK. When
  tumor cells disseminate, there are three different outcomes in different microenvironments.
  Firstly, with upregulation of MAPK p38 combined with decreasing ERK signals, tumor
  cells degenerate without metastasis during dissemination; Secondly, increasing ERK
  with decreasing MAPK p38 promotes metastasis; Thirdly, decreasing ERK with increasing
  p38 brings about metastatic cells dormancy; (b) UPR-induced dormancy is associated
  with cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. MAPK p38 can suppress FoxM1, c-Jun
  and the uPAR (Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) transcript, which is
  crucial for the activation of ERK. Furthermore, it can also trigger the downstream
  signaling of UPR. Activated PERK can phosphorylate elF2α for the G0–G1 arrest and
  induce ATF4 for survival. Besides, phosphorylated elF2α can trigger ATF4 for survival.
  Activated IRE-1α can induce Grp78/Bip for survival as well as block the pro-apoptotic
  signal, Bax. Furthermore, ATF6α can promote survival through the mTOR signaling
  pathway. Redrawn from Sosa et al. [].
