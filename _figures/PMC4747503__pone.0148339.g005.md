caption: '(A) Transverse section through the cochlea on E15.5. (B-D) High magnification
  views of the apical, mid and basal turns of an E15.5 cochlea. (B) Dkk3 expression
  was not observed. (C) Dkk3 was detected in the GER. (D) Dkk3 was detected in the
  GER adjacent to a single inner hair cell (labeled in red with hair cell marker Myo7a).
  (E) Transverse section through a cochlea on P0. Dkk3 was detected in all three turns
  of the cochlea. (F-G) High magnification views of the apical, mid and basal turns.
  (F) Dkk3 was detected at low levels in luminal cells of the GER. (G, H) Dkk3 was
  detected at high levels in the GER. (I) Transverse section through a P6 cochlea.
  Dkk3 expression was down regulated. Hair cells were labeled by Myo7a (red). (J)
  Transverse section through a P30 cochlea showing Dkk3 expression at the inner edge
  of spiral limbus and broadly in the stria vascularis. Abbreviations: PSE: prosensory
  epithelium; GER: greater epithelial ridge; LER: lesser epithelial ridge; HC: hair
  cell; Asterisk (*): inner hair cell; OHC: outer hair cell; SV: stria vascularis.'
