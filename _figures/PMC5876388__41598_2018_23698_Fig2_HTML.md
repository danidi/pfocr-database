caption: 'The T-REx assay system. Without Dox, expression of Notch1(1704–2531) is
  suppressed by TetR. The addition of Dox inactivates TetR to initiate expression
  of Notch1(1704–2531), which is then cleaved by endogenous γ-secretase to form NICD.
  NICD then translocates to the nucleus and forms a heterotrimer with RBP-J and MAML
  that binds to a 12× RBP-J binding site to drive luciferase expression. Luciferase
  activity was detected as Notch signaling pathway activity. Dox: doxycycline, TetR:
  tetracycline repressor, Luc.: luciferase.'
