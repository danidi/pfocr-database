caption: Simplified Scheme of the Biosynthetic Pathway in Arabidopsis Leading to PAs,
  Flavonols, and Anthocyanins, Including Proposed Vacuolar Transport Steps.Dihydrokaempferol
  is synthesized from 4-coumaroyl CoA and three molecules of malonyl CoA by the sequential
  action of chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), and flavanone 3-hydroxylase
  (F3H). Enzymes are represented in uppercase bold letters. Corresponding genetic
  mutations are in lowercase italic letters. Regulatory mutants are indicated by parentheses.
  AHA10, P-type H+-ATPase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; CE, condensing enzyme; DFR,
  dihydroflavonol reductase; F3′H, flavonol 3′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  (F)GT, (flavonol) glycosyltransferase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase.
