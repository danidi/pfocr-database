caption: Macrophage signaling network scores for seven-month smoke vs seven-month
  fresh air using the E-MTAB-3150 dataset. A selection from the TopoNPA-scored version
  is shown. Arrow edge indicates a positive relationship, while ball and stick edge
  indicates a negative relationship (includes causal and correlative statements).
  Nodes are colored by NPA score; yellow indicates inferred increase and blue indicates
  inferred decrease. Darker colors denote higher magnitude scores. Leading nodes contribute
  to 80% of the network score and are denoted by their shapes outlined in gray. Nodes
  added within this section of the network during the NVC process are labeled in red.
  Nodes boxed in yellow reflect prediction of TLR pathway.
