caption: Network modeling. (A) A focused view of a module of the EGFR/ErbB signaling
  pathway linking two proteins identified in this study, Pdcd6 and Pabpc1. Gene symbols
  used are from HPRD. Yellow and purple boxes represent known and previously unrecognized
  Her2 signaling proteins identified in this study, respectively. White boxes represent
  connecting proteins not identified by MS but known to be involved in EGFR signaling.
  (B) Bayesian network model showing a directed graph of influence on protein phosphorylation.
  Blue hexagons, tan ovals, and white ovals represent ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases,
  other protein kinases, and other proteins, respectively. Edges in green, yellow,
  and red are conserved in >400, >300, and >200 of the 500 highest scoring networks,
  respectively. Based on the underlying assumptions of Bayesian networks, loops are
  not permitted, and red edges represent alternate routes taken by the simulation
  on different runs.
