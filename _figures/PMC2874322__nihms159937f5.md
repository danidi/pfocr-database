caption: In this summary of approaches used to date to identify candidate genes for
  AD, the first consideration is the complex pathology of AD (panel A), which includes
  defects and damage at the epithelial barrier, and penetration of allergens, microbes,
  pollutants and irritants into the epidermis and dermis, ultimately interacting with
  antigen presentation cells (i.e., Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells).
  The ‘brick wall-like’ structure of the stratum corneum is compromised, possibly
  by defects in genes residing in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), including
  FLG, LOR, LCEs, S100s, SPRRs, SCTE, and SCCE. Additional candidates include tight
  junctions (TJ), proteins that constitute the “gate” to the passage of water, ions
  and solutes through the paracellular pathway in the stratum granulosum (i.e., CLDN1).
  A defective innate immune response (involving, for example, the TLRs, CD14, NOD1,
  NOD2, DEFB1, and IRF2) may contribute to a heightened IgE-mediated, systemic Th2
  response. Combining a candidate gene approach with robust, genomewide gene expression
  profiling has the potential of both elucidating novel candidates and validating
  suspected candidates, as illustrated in panel B, in which genes in the EDC on chromosome
  1q21 are significantly differentially expressed in a human skin biopsies taken from
  AD patients compared to healthy nonatopic controls (courtesy L.A. Beck). Candidate
  genes are selected, and substitutions (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms, or
  SNPs) and simple structural variants (i.e., insertions/deletions, repeats) are genotyped
  in large populations selected for AD and tests for association are performed.
