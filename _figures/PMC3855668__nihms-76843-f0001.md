caption: The model of the signaling pathway mediated by ATM in response to DSBs induced
  by IR, as proposed by Kitagawa et al. (). Upon induction of DSB the MRE11, RAD50,
  and NBS1 proteins (MRN complex), as well as BRCA1, are recruited to its site. The
  MRN complex, when recruited to a DSB, combined with the “structural” change in chromatin
  resulting from DNA breakage (unwinding and altered torsional stress of the DNA double
  helix) activate ATM by triggering its auto-phosphorylation, which causes dissociation
  of the ATM dimer into two enzymatically active monomers, located at some distance
  from the DSB. After activation, ATM may phosphorylate several nucleoplasmic substrates
  such as p53, Chk1, Chk2, E2F1. The activated, monomeric ATM is recruited to the
  DSB when NBS1 and BRCA1 are already at the break site, at which point it phosphorylates
  several substrates, including NBS1 and SMC1. Phosphorylation of NBS1 targets ATM
  to Chk1 (), phosphorylation of SMC1 activates the S-phase checkpoint (,), while
  BRCA1 phosphorylation engages this protein in DSB repair involving either nonhomologous
  end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HR). Phosphorylation of NBS1 is
  also essential for MRN stimulation of ATM activity towards Chk2 (). The MRN complex
  is critical for recruitment of ATM to the site of DSB and in mediating phosphorylation
  of p53 and H2AX by ATM (). Phosphorylation of p53 may lead to upregulation of p21
  or Bax thereby arresting the cell in G1 or inducing apoptosis, respectively.
