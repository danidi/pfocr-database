number: Figure 3
caption: 'Pathway analysis of major gene products affected by virulent infection.
  A sub-network of the response network from Figure 2 reveals interactions between
  the major gene products affected by virulent infections. This network is in accordance
  with Figure 5 of Djavani et al. (2007) []. In contrast to Djavani et al., PTGS2
  and IL1RL1 (not shown: as well as IL1R1 and IL1R2) are up-regulated. EGR1, EGR2,
  FOS, FOSB are transcription factors. PTGS2 encodes prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase
  2, IL1A/B code for interleukin 1 and IL1RL1 belongs to the interleukin 1 receptor
  family. Color coding is according to Figure 1. Black arrows indicate known connections
  not realized in this particular response network (see Additional files  &).'
