caption: βOHB production is controlled by at least two nutrient-responsible pathways
  that are implicated in longevity and may be subject to regulation by βOHB via HDAC
  inhibition. Rapamycin and down-regulation of the mTOR pathway promote ketogenesis;
  rapamycin and FGF21 enhance mammalian longevity. FOXA2 also enhances ketogenesis,
  and its activation is regulated by both class III (sirtuins) and class I/II HDACs.
