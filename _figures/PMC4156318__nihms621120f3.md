caption: ATM-NF-κB-regulated signaling network causing the adaptive resistance to
  IR in normal human skin epithelial HK18 cells. Low level radiation induces ATM-NF-κB
  p65 interaction through NF-κB activation by an ATM-dependent fashion (ATM/unknown
  kinase/MEK/ERK pathway). These events result in up-regulation of 14-3-3s and cyclins,
  and a reduction of 14-3-3ζ-cyclin D1 complex. Overall, these results demonstrate
  a novel molecular events of adaptive radioresistance involving ATM-NF-κB connection
  in human keratinocytes.
