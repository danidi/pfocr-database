caption: 'Schematic of the “classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS)” and “anti-RAS”
  arms in different conditions as follows: physiology (A, top), severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (A, bottom), angiotensin II type 1
  receptor blocker (ARB) therapy (B, top), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
  (ACE-I) therapy (B, bottom). The schematic includes circulating factors and local
  synthesis by the main cells involved (pneumocytes type 1 and 2, interstitial mesenchymal
  cells, and capillary endothelium). The thickness of the connecting lines and arrows
  or dashed arrows represents proportional increases or reductions of the pathways.
  SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to a downregulation of ACE2 with a consequent decrease
  of the anti-RAS arm, mainly Ang(1–7) and alamandine. Treatment with ARB could counteract
  this imbalance, through angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade and the angiotensin
  II (Ang II) increase, moving the pathway toward anti-RAS prevalence. The reequilibrium
  of the anti-RAS arm could be done also likely by treatment with ACE-I through a
  different mechanism [increased availability of Ang(1–9), decreased degradation of
  Ang(1–7)] that also involves angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) stimulation.
