caption: PINK1/PARKIN pathway activation in polarized mitochondria. Depolarization
  of mitochondria/mitochondrial damage activates PARKIN-dependent mitophagy by induction
  of PINK-1 kinase in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Loss of membrane potential
  necessary for component replacement is responsible for increased concentration of
  PINK1 in the OMM. PINK1 stabilizes and phosphorylates Parkin, which, when activated,
  is responsible for ubiquitinylation of proteins on mitochondrial surface, which
  is a signal for proteasomes to degrade the mitochondrion. In polarized mitochondria,
  PINK1 is continuously being imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space,
  where it is degraded by PARL proteases. Low levels of PINK1 prevent mitophagy of
  healthy mitochondria.
