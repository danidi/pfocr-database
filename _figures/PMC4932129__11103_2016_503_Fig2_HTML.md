caption: Stomatal closure signalling pathways. ABA produced in the guard cells or
  imported to the apoplast from other tissues unleashes the production of NO and ROS,
  the subsequent release of Ca2+ controls the activity of several ion channels causing
  decreased osmotic pressure in the cell, leading to H2O efflux and stomatal closure.
  This pathway can be activated by MeJA. Question marks highlight the lack of information
  on the individual activity of JA, MeJA and OPDA activating this pathway or modifying
  ABA biosynthesis. An alternative hydraulic pathway activated by ABA (Pantin et al.
  ) is described where ABA deactivates PIP aquaporins in the bundle sheath decreasing
  leaf hydraulic conductivity (Lleaf), which will decrease ψleaf and gs. Question
  marks reflect steps that are theorized but not sustained by experimental data. Mutants
  in red designate an interruption in the pathway that has been experimentally verified
