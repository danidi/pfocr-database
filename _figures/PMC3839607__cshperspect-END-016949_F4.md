caption: Endosomal sorting regulates integrin-based focal adhesions. Focal adhesions
  containing active conformers of integrin β1 establish strong, yet dynamic, contacts
  between the ventral aspect of migrating cells and the underlying extracellular matrix.
  Both actin filaments and microtubules projecting from the microtubule-organizing
  center (MTOC) regulate cell adhesion. The latter polymers dissolve focal adhesions
  once they approach the plasma membrane. This requires protein kinases, such as FAK,
  and recruitment of both dynamin 2 and disabled 2 (Dab2), a clathrin adaptor, which
  directly binds with the cytoplasmic tails of integrin β-subunits. Once internalized
  by activated dynamin, the formed clathrin-coated vesicles mature to integrin-loaded
  EEs. These organelles are transported backward along microtubules to reach the PNRC
  and the recycling pathway, or these EEs deliver their cargo to lysosomes for degradation.
  These alternative itineraries are regulated by specific Rab proteins. Note that
  the flux of integrins through the endocytic pathway, rather than their surface levels,
  dictates migration speed. Accordingly, the levels of both Dab2 and dynamin display
  broad variation in several types of carcinomas (see ).
