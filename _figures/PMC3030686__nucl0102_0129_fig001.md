caption: Loss of A-type lamins induces genomic instabilitySummary of the recently
  identified alterations in telomere biology and in the DNA damage response pathway
  upon loss of A-type lamins in mouse cells., Lmna−/− fibroblasts exhibit alterations
  in the structure of telomere chromatin Specifically, a decrease in H4K20me3 and
  TERRAs levels was observed. The decrease in H4K20me3 is consistent with destabilization
  of Rb family members in these cells. In addition, loss of A-type lamins leads to
  alterations in the nuclear distribution of telomeres as determined by 3D FISH, and
  in telomere metabolism. Telomere shortening—as shown by TRF and Q-FISH assays—and
  telomere dysfunction—increased number of chromosomes that feature undetectable telomere
  tracks—were observed. Furthermore, Lmna−/− fibroblasts feature aneuploidy, chromosome
  and chromatid breaks, and basal γH2AX foci indicative of unrepaired DNA damage.
  Loss of A-type lamins also hinders the processing of dysfunctional telomeres by
  NHEJ. The concomitant destabilization of 53BP1 protein could be in part responsible
  for the increased genomic instability and the defects in NHEJ upon loss of A-type
  lamins. Collectively, these data indicate that A-type lamins function in the maintenance
  of genome stability.
