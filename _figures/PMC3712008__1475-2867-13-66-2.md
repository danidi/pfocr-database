caption: 'Subnetwork representation of protein interactions based on 78 mutated genes
  in 602 breast cancers []-[]. Gene networks were inferred using the Reactome FI Cytoscape
  Plugin []. A total of 182 genes with more than 7 mutations in 602 breast cancer
  samples were used. Among them, 78 (43%) were mapped in the subnetwork and subsequently
  clustered into 12 modules, six of which were greater than 4. Finally, modules functions
  were assessed with pathway enrichment analysis (FDR < 0.05). Three main pathways
  can be recognized: the P53 pathway and DNA repair (14 genes/18%) in blue, the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway (13 genes/18%) in pink and the MAPK pathway (8 genes/10%) in green.'
