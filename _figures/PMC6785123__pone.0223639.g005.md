caption: Nephrin Interactions is an example of a top-ranked light pathway, defined
  as a pathway highly covered with HNSCC mutations (~100%) and frequently mutated
  in the patient cohort (36%). Nodes in green are genes mutated in the GDC HNSCC cohort
  and nodes in yellow are mutated in the cohort as well annotated as targets for cancer
  drugs in the Cancer Targetome. Drugs are indicated by red diamonds and represent
  FDA-approved cancer drugs with targets in this pathway. For drug-target interactions
  shown here, we required supporting binding assay evidence to be <1000nM.
