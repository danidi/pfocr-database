caption: RNA sensing and viral manipulation of TLR and RLR signaling pathways. (A)
  Foreign RNA sensing is mediated by TLR3, 7, and 8 in the endosomal compartment.
  These signals are transduced via TRIF in the case of TLR3 and by intermediary of
  MYD88 for TLR7 and TLR8. Their activation leads to the production of type I IFNs
  via IRF3/7 and to the expression of other genes such as IL-1β and NLRP3 via the
  NF-κB pathway. HBV has been reported to impair TLR signaling pathways via decreased
  expression of TLR3. Similarly, HCV affects TLR signaling by decreasing the presence
  of dsRNA in endosomes and via NS3/4A-mediated degradation of TRIF. (B) Foreign RNA
  sensing is mediated by MDA5 and RIG-I in the cytoplasmic compartment. K63-linked
  ubiquitination of RIG-I by RIPLET is necessary for its activation. MDA5 and RIG-I
  signals converge in the activation of MAVS and are carried via TRAF, TBK1 and IKKϵ
  for the induction of IFNs, or via IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ for induction of the NF-κB
  pathway. Alternatively, MAVS signaling can also induce apoptosis via activation
  of caspase 8. HBV has been reported to impair RLR signaling pathways via miR-146a–mediated
  downregulation of RIG-I. Similarly, HCV affects RLR signaling via NS3/4A-mediated
  degradation of RIPLET and MAVS.
