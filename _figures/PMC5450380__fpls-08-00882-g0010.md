caption: Sugarcane responses to S. scitamineum colonization during disease progression
  and whip emission. Identified metabolites in GC-MS analysis were incorporated in
  pathways and each square represent the sampling days after inoculation (5, 65, 100,
  and 120 DAI). “x” assigned represent significant regulation (p < 0.05), blue squares
  represent metabolites less accumulated and red represent more accumulated in infected
  samples. Nuclear compartment represents genes with differential expression in RT-qPCR
  analysis. Right squares in dotted lines summarize the hypotheses built on metabolomics
  and previous transcriptomics analysis of sugarcane-smut interaction as discussed
  in the main text. Smut-infected plants increase energetic demands to feed whip development,
  along with changes in several sugars, which may involve changes in plant signaling.
  Hormonal imbalance in infected plants is exemplified by ethylene biosynthesis pathway
  regulated in both metabolites and gene expression assays. Phenylpropanoid pathway
  is activated in meristems of infected plants probably through activation of a bifunctional
  PTAL and Tyr accumulation. Conversely, metabolites and genes related to precursors
  of plant cell wall are less accumulated in meristem of infected samples, indicating
  that cell wall loosening occurs to allow whip emission. Whip growth as well as pathogen
  sporulation may be fed by the starch accumulated in meristems of infected plants.
