caption: 'unctions and subsequent pathways of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2 in
  human digestive system neoplasms. Overexpression of Eukaryotic initiation factor
  5A2 (eIF5A2) induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) by enhancing RhoA/Rac1-GTPase
  and ITP60 GNC5-MTA1 activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of
  EIF5A2 also promotes colorectal carcinoma and gastric cancer cell aggressiveness
  by upregulating the C-myc/MTA axis to induce EMT. Increased expression of eIF5A2
  contributes to angiogenesis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via the P38 MAPK/MMP2
  pathway. eIF5A2 promotes cell proliferation and triggers cellular metabolic reprogramming
  in HCC cells, including glucose metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis via upregulation
  of FASN and ACSS2. In HCC, eIF5A2 stimulates rearrangement of the cytoskeleton through
  activation of the RhoA/Rac1 GTPase signaling pathway. eIF5A2: Eukaryotic initiation
  factor 5A2; EMT: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition.'
