caption: Illustrations of the type 1 IFN – MHC class I pathway in skeletal muscle
  and the creation of an MHC class I (HLA-B)-HiBit luminescent reporter fusion protein
  using Cas9 genome-editing in myoblasts. A, Type 1 IFNs activate the interferon-α/β
  receptor on the cell surface, which drives the expression of IFN responsive genes
  including MHC class I. In skeletal muscle, MHC class I expression leads to an ER
  stress response, further activation of the IFN signature, and autoimmune attack
  by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). B, For high throughput screening assays, the
  HiBit reporter peptide was fused to the C-terminus of endogenous HLA-B in immortalized
  human myoblasts by transfecting single-stranded DNA template for HiBit, flanked
  by homology arms, and Cas9 protein-guide RNA (gRNA) complex. HLA-B expression could
  then be measured using a lytic luminescence assay via complementation of HiBit with
  the LgBit subunit from NanoLuc plus furimazine substrate.
