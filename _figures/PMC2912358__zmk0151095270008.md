caption: The model depicts a variety of routes followed by newly synthesized EGFR
  in polarized renal cells. EGFRs are transported to the CRE where they undergo AP-1B–dependent
  transport to the basolateral membrane via route B1. EGFR also follows an AP-1B–independent
  pathway that may bypass CREs using a direct route from the TGN to the basolateral
  membrane (B2). Alternatively this pathway may involve a hypothetical route from
  CREs to BSEs (B3). Introduction of an aspartic acid residue for Thr654 unmasks a
  third route that traverses AREs en route to the basolateral membrane (B4). Receptors
  in this pathway may reach AREs by a direct route from the TGN (A1) or via a CRE
  intermediate (AT). The B1 pathway is impaired in μ1B-null LLCPK1 cells as well as
  cystic cells from the BPK model with constitutive μ1B expression. The B4 pathway
  bypasses AP-1B and reconstitutes polar EGFR expression in both cell types. Apically
  missorted EGFRs probably follows the N-glycan–dependent A1 pathway rather than the
  lipid raft–dependent pathway that involves ASE intermediates (not shown). Gray arrows
  indicate polarized protein cargoes that may be presorted in the ER or Golgi. AJ,
  adherens junction; TJ, tight junction; ⊤, clathrin.
