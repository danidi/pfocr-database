caption: The locus tag and fold induction of the proteins based on the proteomic data
  are indicated in the brackets. Fd, ferredoxin; ND, not detected; Ppase, pyrophosphatase;
  Rnf, proton pumping Rnf cluster. According to our model, fructoselysine is taken
  up by ABC transporter (AF_00952-00955), which is phosphorylated by fructoselysine
  kinase (AF_00949) to form fructoselysine-6-phosphate that is subsequently cleaved
  by fructoseamine deglycase (AF_00951) into lysine and glucose-6-phosphate (indicated
  by the purple arrows). Lysine is then degraded via the lysine pathway (black arrows)
  while glucose-6-phosphate is metabolized via glycolysis and the acetyl-CoA pathway
  (blue arrows) as described in the text (). There are various links between the lysine
  and acetyl-CoA pathways and the one at the level of acetoacetyl-CoA, involving acetate
  to generate acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA, is indicated (dashed black arrows). For
  simplicity, only the key reactions are shown and other links or the conversion of
  acetyl-CoA formed via acetyl-CoA pathway to acetate have been omitted. Fructoselysine,
  lysine, butyrate, acetate, lactate and CO2 are indicated in different colours highlighting
  their distinctive positions in the pathways. ATP is in red to indicate reactions
  that either require or generate energy via substrate-level phosphorylation and electron
  transport chain. Lactate formation is dependent on the amount of exogenous acetate
  and redox state (hence both lactate formation and acetate uptake are indicated by
  dashed green arrows). Therefore, the overall fructoselysine stoichiometry depends
  on the presence or absence of exogenous acetate as well as environmental conditions
  and activity of biosynthetic pathways. In the presence of acetate (such as in the
  human colon), fructoselysine is converted in approximately three butyrate (two butyrate
  are formed via acetyl-CoA pathway and one butyrate through the lysine pathway),
  while no lactate is produced; however, when no exogenous acetate is present, fructoselysine
  is converted into approximately two butyrate and one lactate (see  for details).
