caption: Roles of defective mitophagy in AD with a vicious cycle between them. In
  normal condition, different mitophagy pathways are activated to efficiently eliminate
  damaged or superfluous mitochondria. E.g., the PINK1-Parkin pathway is a well-characterized
  mitochondrial recycling pathway. PINK1 is stabilized on the OMM of a damaged mitochondrion,
  promoting Parkin recruitment. Parkin ubiquitinates several outer membrane components.
  Poly-Ub chains are subsequently phosphorylated by PINK1 for the autophagic machinery.
  Adaptor proteins (e.g., p62, OPTN, NDP52, ULK1, and TBK1) recognize phosphorylated
  poly-Ub chains on mitochondrial proteins and initiate autophagosome formation through
  binding with LC3. Furthermore, the PINK1–Parkin pathway modulates mitochondrial
  dynamics and motility by targeting MFN and Miro for proteasomal degradation. However,
  aging, genetic, and non-genetic factors cause impairment of the NAD+-mitophagy axis,
  which exacerbates disease defining pathologies of AD, including higher Aβ, pTau,
  and inflammation. These disease pathologies can further cause the damage of mitochondria
  and the inhibition of mitophagy, thus, generating a vicious cycle.
