caption: A model of the regulation of DREB1 expression under circadian control. PIF7
  binds to the G-box sequence in the promoter regions of DREB1B and DREB1C and represses
  their expression under circadian control. PIF7 forms both homodimers and heterodimers
  with other PIFs, such as PIF4, in Arabidopsis cells. These other PIFs may function
  redundantly to repress the expression of these DREB1 genes. PIF7 activity is regulated
  by one of its binding partners, TOC1, downstream of PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 (). PIF7
  also interacts with and is regulated by PhyB. Another transcriptional regulatory
  pathway is expected to exist downstream of PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 to repress the expression
  of DREB1A. Thus, the expression of DREB1s is repressed by the central oscillator
  under the unstressed conditions. TFs, Transcription factors.
