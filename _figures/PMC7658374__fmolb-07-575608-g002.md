caption: ERAD mechanism for misfolded glycoprotein through the HRD-1/SEL-1L complex.
  Triglycosylated form of protein-bound oligosaccharide (Gl3Man9GlcNac2) is processed
  by glucosidase enzymes (GluI/II) that cleaves off two glucose molecules. This is
  followed by cycles of interaction between the nascent protein and lectins such as
  Calnexin and Calreticulin (CNX/CRT), that binds specifically to monoglucosylated
  oligosaccharides (GlMan9GlcNac2) and ensure the proper folding of newly synthesized
  protein. This cycling effect is generated by the enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein
  glucosyltransferase (UGGT), that transfers back a glucose residue to the improperly
  folded protein to enable further encounters with the ER chaperones (CNX/CRT). A
  properly folded protein is then released after the cleavage of the remaining glucose
  molecule. Properly formed protein is dispatched to its functional destination, while
  misfolded protein that cannot reach its mature form will undergo mannose cleavage
  by ER α1,2-mannosidase I (ERMan1), which produces Man8GlcNAc2. Terminal mannose
  cleavage (α mannose) function as a recognition signal for ERAD lectins OS-9 and
  XTP3-B that recognize and binds to exposed mannose residues after cleavage of α
  mannose. The three chaperones EDEM1, OS9 and XTP3-B function together as recognition
  complex that interacts with misfolded proteins and the HRD-1/SEL-1L retrotranslocation
  channel. Derlins which are candidates for the translocon channel also interacts
  with the EDEMs and facilitates the interaction of EDEMs with cytosolic AAA-ATPase
  p97, that provides ATP hydrolysis for successful extraction of mutant proteins.
  Retrotranslocation is coupled by Uniquitination, a process that targets proteins
  for degradation by 26S proteasome by tagging them with ubiquitin chains.
