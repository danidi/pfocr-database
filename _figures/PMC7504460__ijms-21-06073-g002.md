caption: 'Insulin-PI3K signaling facilitates cell proliferation and glucose metabolism
  via serine/threonine protein kinase B (AKT)-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
  The interaction of insulin with the insulin receptor (IR) triggers phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)-regulated signaling, in which phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3) recruits phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), the serine/threonine
  kinase AKT, and other factors to the cell membrane where the signals are propagated
  via a series of serine/threonine kinase and tyrosine kinase activities. Phosphatase
  and tensin homologue (PTEN) can dephosphorylate PIP3 to form PIP2, limiting activation
  of this pathway, and loss-of-function mutations in PTEN cause significant elevations
  in PIP3, a driving force of this pathway. Phosphorylated AKT inhibits downstream
  targets via phosphorylation, including forkhead box protein O (FOXO)-1 and glycogen
  synthase kinase (GSK), both of which normally function to inhibit cell growth. Phosphorylated
  AKT also inhibits thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an adaptor for endocytosis
  of glucose transporters (GLUTs), leading to dissociation from the GLUTs, inhibition
  of their endocytosis, and rapid glucose uptake upon insulin stimulation. AKT phosphorylation
  leads to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein kinase that
  controls cell proliferation via activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding
  protein-1 (4E-BP-1) complex and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which phosphorylates ribosomal
  S6 protein (rpS6). Insulin-PI3K signaling also activates an AKT-independent pathway,
  in which PIP3-recruited Ras-related C3 botulinus toxin substrate (RAC) activation
  leads to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and release of filamentous actin (F-actin)-bound
  aldolase A (ALDOA), resulting in aldolase activation that promotes the glycolysis
  pathway. Additionally, PI3K signaling activates serum and glucocorticoid-induced
  protein kinase (SGK1) via PDK phosphorylation independent of AKT and can phosphorylate
  overlapping substrates of AKT, resulting in bypass of the AKT pathway. Metformin
  inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) at the mitochondrial level, resulting
  in a decrease in the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and
  leading to a reduction in proton-driven synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  and an increase in the ratio of cellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to ATP. This
  leads to preferential AMP binding to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and a conformational
  change that allows for phosphorylation/activation of AMPK by liver kinase B1 (LKB1).
  Activated AMPK converts cells to a catabolic state through AMPK-mediated phosphorylation,
  leading to the inhibition of downstream transcription factors involved in ATP-consuming
  synthetic pathways. AMPK activation also induces FOXO1 nuclear translocation, activating
  function of this protein. Additionally, activated AMPK inhibits mTOR to inhibit
  cell growth. IRS: insulin receptor substrate, p85: regulatory subunit of PI3K, p110:
  catalytic subunit of PI3K, NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, LDH: lactate
