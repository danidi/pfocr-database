caption: Strategies to overcome NK resistance in solid tumors. To enhance targeting
  specificity, NK cells have been engineered to express CAR such as anti-HER2 CAR,
  anti-EGFR CAR, anti-GD2 CAR et al. to target a specific antigen on tumor cell surface.
  NK cells can be activated by cytokines and cytokine fusion proteins such as IL-2,
  IL-15, IL-12, IL-18, IL-21, ALT-803 (an IL-15 superagonist), NKTR-255 (a polymer-engineered
  IL-15 molecule), anti-GD2-IL2, and anti-GD2-RLI fusions et al. Bispecific antibodies
  are novel molecules where two antigens can be targeted at the same time by combining
  the specificities of two antibodies. Bispecific antibodies can enhance NK cells
  targeting and killing. Preventing CD16 shedding and expressing high affinity CD16
  on NK cells combined with novel engineered humanized antibodies will enhance NK
  mediated ADCC. The inhibitory roles of checkpoint proteins PD-1, TIGIT, IL-1R8,
  and KIR on NK cells are well documented. Blocking PD-1, TIGIT, and KIR with specific
  antibodies or knocking down IL-1R8 in NK cells unleash human NK-cell effector function.
  The membrane-bound ligands such as MICA/B binding to NKG2D play an important role
  in NK cell activation and tumor immune surveillance. Therapeutic strategies have
  focused on enhancing NKG2D expression and signaling on NK cells and enhancing the
  level of membrane-bound NKG2D ligand on tumor cells; and eliminating soluble NKG2D
  ligands. To enhance NK homing and tumor infiltration, NK cells can be enhanced to
  express chemokine receptors such as CXCR3, CXCR2 to be attracted to tumor cells
  that secret CXCL10, CXCL1, CXCL8, or CCL5. TGF-β plays an immunosuppressive effect
  of on NK cells. The approaches to block TGF-β and inhibit TGF-β pathway including
  TGF-β neutralizing antibody, TGF-β receptor I kinase inhibitors, SMAD3-Silenced
  (Smad3knd) NK Cells, NK cells engineered with a dominant negative receptor II for
  TGF-β (DNRII), NK cells engineered to express a chimeric receptor with TGF-β type
  II receptor extracellular and transmembrane domains and the intracellular domain
  of NK cell-activating receptor NKG2D (RIIG2D).
