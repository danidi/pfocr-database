caption: 'Proposed model of OGP(10-14) differentiation signalling. (A) Control cells:
  TPO induces M07-e cells proliferation by SFK activation and RhoA inhibition. (B)
  OGP(10-14)-treated cells: the pentapeptide induces cell differentiation by activating
  RhoA and preventing SFKs activation through a down-modulation of Mpl induced by
  an increase of TGFβ1.'
