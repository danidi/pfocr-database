caption: GSH biosynthetic route and GSH cycle. GSH biosynthesis occurs in two different
  and ATP-dependen steps. The first and limiting step is carried out by GCL, formed
  by two subunits GCLc and GCLm. In this step l-Glu and l-Cys react to form γ-glutamyl-cisteine.
  GS is responsible of the second step, that joins l-Gly forming γ-glutamyl-cisteinyl-glicine
  (GSH). As well as aerobic respiration or other ROS sources increase H2O2, that should
  be metabolized, in this case GPx generating GSSG. This GSSG could be reduced to
  GSH again with the help of GR GR, creating a redox cycle, using as reducing agent
  NAPDH, from Penthoses Phosphate Pathway (PPP).
