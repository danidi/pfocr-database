caption: Hypothetical pathway for the biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursors IPP
  and DMAPP in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 under photosynthetic conditions. The
  carbon atoms originate from photosynthetically produced phosphorylated sugars (e.g.,
  GA3P, DHAP, GL6P, FR6P, 6PG, ER4P, and RU5P). These are shown in the study to stimulate
  isoprenoid synthesis in a cell-free system and could enter primarily via RU5P and/or
  XY5P, and after a reductoisomerase reaction, they could be converted to diphosphocytidyl
  hydroxymethyl d-erythritol (CDP-HME), followed by phosphorylation and cyclization
  to give 2,4 hydroxymethyl cyclodiphosphate (HME-2,4 cPP). LytB is considered to
  be near the branch point leading to formation of IPP and DMAPP (). Interconversion
  between IPP and DMAPP appears to be lacking under these conditions.
