caption: A simplified scheme of kidney development (top row) and acute kidney injury
  (AKI) induced regeneration (circle). During development, RA drives renal progenitor
  cells to undergo specification followed by proliferation events while expressing
  the early pre-tubular markers Pax2/8, Lhx1 and Wnt4. Later, RA induces expression
  of Lhx1 which has a role in the patterning of the renal vesicles together with Pax2,
  and Bmp proteins which induce mesenchyme polarization. The formation of the S-shaped
  bodies coincides with activation of the Wnt pathway, which is essential for the
  proximo-distal patterning of the nephron together with RA signaling. Branching of
  the ureteric bud within the metanephric mesenchyme is regulated by Pax2 and Wnt9b/11
  among other factors. Bmp signaling has a role in regulating branching, both positively
  (Bmp7) and negatively (Bmp4 and Bmp2). Following tubular damage induced by AKI,
  epithelial cells are lost and the basement membrane is denuded. Wnt7b might act
  as a pro-survival signal from macrophages that preserves basement membrane integrity.
  During the regeneration process, the surviving epithelial cells undergo dedifferentiation
  and reactivation of nephrogenic markers such as Pax2, Bmps, and Lhx1. Proliferation
  and differentiation of these cells is possibly mediated by RA and Wnt4, providing
  the source of replacement cells necessary for restoring a functional tubule
