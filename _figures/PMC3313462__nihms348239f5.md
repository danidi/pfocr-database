caption: The tick creates a feeding pit with its mouthparts, using its hypostome (a
  barbed protuberance) as an anchor to the skin of its host. Initial salivary secretions
  form a cement cone around the hypostome that further anchors the tick during feeding.
  Subsequently, the tick produces copious amounts of saliva containing a plethora
  of bioactive agents that Borrelia burgdorferi exploits to help establish infection.
  The diagram shows just a few of these bioactive agents, including SALP15 (which
  binds to the spirochaetes and inhibits killing of the bacteria and T cell priming)
  and sialostatin L (which blocks neutrophil chemotaxis),. A group of borrelial surface
  lipoproteins, collectively referred to as BbCRASPs (complement regulator-acquiring
  surface proteins), bind complement factor H, preventing activation of the alternative
  complement pathway –. B. burgdorferi cells are recognized by innate immune effector
  cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils and macrophages, initially via
  surface-exposed pattern recognition receptors; activation of these cells increases
  following internalization and degradation of spirochetes within phagolysosomes.
  DCs that have taken up spirochetes migrate to the lymph nodes, where they present
  processed borrelial antigens to T cells and B cells. Sensitized T cells enter the
  circulation and are recruited to the site of infection. Plasma cells secrete specific
  antibodies that can kill B. burgdorferi via complement-dependent and –independent
  pathways. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated macrophages results
  in the recruitment of additional neutrophils, T cells, macrophages and DCs to the
  bite site, and eventually the development of erythema migrans. OspC, outer surface
  lipoprotein C; TLR, Toll-like receptor. .
