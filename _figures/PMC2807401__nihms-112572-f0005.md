caption: Cytokinin binds to AHK receptors, which auto-phosphorylate and subsequently
  transmit a phosphoryl group to the AHPs. The AHPs can then phosphorylate type B
  or type A ARRs. The type B ARR1, and perhaps other untested type B ARRs, act to
  prevent degradation of type 2 ACS, in a non-C-terminus-dependent manner. The type
  A ARRs negatively regulate ethylene biosynthesis, and also cytokinin signaling.
  The blocking arrow denotes negative feedback on cytokinin signaling, but not at
  a particular point in the cytokinin-signaling pathway. BR blocks degradation of
  type 2 ACS, presumably through receptor BRI1. PM denotes the plasma membrane; S
  in the ACS protein represents Ser461, a putative CDPK phosphorylation site.
