caption: Potential signaling pathways through which KOR agonism could enhance remyelination.
  KOR binding by agonists, such as (±)-U50488, leads to downstream ERK1/2 activation,
  CREB phosphorylation, and myelin-related gene (MOG/PLP/MBP) expression. Alternatively,
  KOR activation could lead to JAK2/STAT3 signaling and pSTAT3-mediated gene transcription.
