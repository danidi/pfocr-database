caption: To understand the metabolic pathways disrupted in HCC at the genetic, mRNA,
  and metabolite levels, we used data from the Liver-SB/HBV screen (), human expression
  data, and metabolomic results (). Metabolites are written with larger font size,
  and genes with smaller font size. Red or green fonts mean the gene expression or
  metabolite amount is increased or decreased, respectively, in HCC tissue versus
  adjacent non-tumor tissue. CIS genes listed in  are labeled with *. This map focuses
  on glycolysis, TCA cycle, glutaminolysis, and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway.
  Despite the increased glucose uptake (Glut1/2) and consumption, the tumor cells
  predominantly expressed the pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (Pkm2), which converts phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) to pyruvate less efficiently than Pkm1 . This promotes the accumulation and
  shuttling of glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate
  (F6P), and fructose-1,6-biphosphate 2 (FBP) to the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway
  and macromolecular synthesis. Thus, this termination of the glycolysis metabolic
  pathway together with dysregulation of Pcx and Pdk1/2, would prevent pyruvate from
  entering the TCA cycle. This would also lead to a truncated TCA cycle and insufficient
  glucose-dependent citrate production. However, most of the TCA cycle genes (Idh1/2,
  Sdha, Fh, Odgh) and corresponding intermediates are up-regulated in tumor cells,
  except for the down-regulation of the aconitase gene family (Aco1/2), suggesting
  the TCA cycle is at least partially activated. Our results imply an activation of
  glutaminolysis (Cat2, Gls, Glud1/2) converting glutamine to α-ketoglutarate to replenish
  TCA cycle intermediates. Effective maintenance of citrate synthesis is possible
  through reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate by Idh1/2.
  These adaptations around glycolysis and the TCA cycle could allow rapid generation
  of both ATP for bioenergetics and important metabolites for biosynthesis. In addition,
  the breakdown of citrate by Acly could constitute a primary source of acetyl-CoA
  for fatty acid and lipid synthesis. Moreover, up-regulation of Ldha, could convert
  glutamine-derived pyruvate to lactate that is excreted by Mct4 transporter outside
  the cells.
