caption: Regulation of PTPase catalytic activity by oxidation, and reduction of the
  catalytic cysteine residue. The regulation of signal transduction by PTPases involves
  the modulation of their activity by modification of the oxidation–reduction state
  of the catalytic center. The catalytic cysteine of the PTPases is especially reactive
  because of the ionized state of the cysteinyl hydrogen. The stepwise oxidation of
  the catalytic cysteine residue by reactive oxygen species results in inactivation
  of the enzyme. Oxidation of the catalytic thiol to the sulfenic (−SOH) form is reversible;
  oxidation to sulfinic (SO2H) and sulfonic (–SO3H) forms lead to irreversible PTPase
  inactivation. Mildly oxidized PTPase can undergo disulfide conjugation in the cell
  with glutathione. A novel sulfenyl-amide derivative of PTP1B has been shown to undergo
  GSH conjugation or direct biochemical reduction with DTT. Active enzyme can be regenerated
  from glutathiolated enzyme by cellular GSH reductases. (This figure is a modification
  from .)
