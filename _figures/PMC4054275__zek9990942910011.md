caption: Proposed regulatory mechanism of protein tyrosine phosphatases in C. neoformans.
  Both PTP1 and PTP2 were strongly induced in response to environmental stresses in
  a Hog1-dependent manner, partly through the Atf1 transcription factor. Ptp1 and
  Ptp2 localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with greater enrichment in
  the nucleus. Both PTPs appeared to have a Hog1-anchoring function. Ptp2 was a major
  negative-feedback regulator of Hog1 and controlled stress responses, virulence factor
  productions (melanin, capsule, and urease), and sexual differentiation. However,
  Ptp2 may also be involved in other signaling pathways, which controlled susceptibilities
  to heavy metal, flucytosine, and H2O2. In contrast, Ptp1 played minor roles in the
  HOG pathway and also controlled the filamentation process during mating of C. neoformans
  in a Hog1-independent manner.
