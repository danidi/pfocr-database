caption: TNF binding to TNFR1 stimulates two signaling complexes with opposing effects
  on cell survival. Complex I (pro-survival) triggers the NF-κB pathway which up regulates
  the expression of XIAP, a protease that inhibits apoptosis by blocking the caspase
  signaling cascade. On the other hand, complex II (pro-death) promotes apoptosis
  by stimulating Fas associated death domain (FADD). This induces apoptosis by stimulating
  cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and by activating caspases-3, -8 and
  -10. Cell fate is influenced by the balance of these signaling effects.
