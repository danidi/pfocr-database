caption: 'Mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance and the key pathway of drug action.
  Delivery of FFAs to the liver and skeletal muscle is increased in insulin resistance
  conditions, and these are metabolized via mitochondrial β-oxidation. Consequently,
  hyperglycemia and increased hepatic FFA uptake reduce glucose uptake and oxidation
  in skeletal muscle. Diet and exercise are the main treatment strategies for this
  pathogenesis; insulin sensitizers and MUFA may contribute to reducing peripheral
  insulin resistance. Pioglitazone and fenofibrate act on β-oxidation of mitochondria
  and reduce hepatic steatosis. Accelerated β-oxidation also causes increased production
  of ROS. Vitamin E can reduce oxidative stress. Adipose tissue inflammation of the
  liver leads to inflammatory activation of hepatic Kupffer cells via classic response
  (M1) and produce inflammatory cytokines. This is also associated with decreased
  adiponectin levels and promotes hepatic steatohepatitis. Pentoxifylline inhibits
  TNF-α and alleviates steatohepatitis. Hyperglycemia caused by insulin resistance
  up-regulates lipogenic gene expression, such as SREBP-1c and ChREBP, and induces
  lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Cilostasol may inhibit SREBP-1c. FFA: Free fatty acid;
  TG: Triglyceride; CPT-I: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I; ACC: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
