caption: Drosophila antimicrobial autophagy in bacterial and viral infection. a L.
  monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that invades the cytoplasm. Intracellular
  bacteria are detected by the PRR PGRP-LE, which senses PGN derivatives that are
  components of the bacterial cell wall. PGRP-LE recognition activates several signaling
  pathways, including the activation of AMP production by the IMD and Jak-Stat signaling
  pathways, as well as autophagy. L. monocytogenes is found within autophagosomes,
  which mature and degrade the captured bacteria. The exact signaling pathway involved
  in triggering autophagy during L. monocytogenes infection remains to be determined,
  as canonical pathways such as the IMD and Toll pathways are not required. b VSV
  activates autophagy in flies likely through the viral glycoprotein VSV-G, which
  acts as a PAMP. Viral infection is sensed by the Toll receptor Toll-7, which localizes
  to the plasma membrane and binds to VSV virions. This binding is required to activate
  autophagy through an undefined signaling pathway (but is independent of the canonical
  Toll, IMD and Jak-Stat pathways). Previous research suggests that the nutrient signaling
  PI3K-Akt-TOR pathway, which typically constrains autophagy, is downregulated during
  VSV infection to trigger autophagy activation. It is still not understood exactly
  how autophagy restricts VSV replication, i.e. whether intact virions or viral proteins
  are captured by autophagosomes.
