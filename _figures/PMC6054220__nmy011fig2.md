caption: 'Autophagy induced by nutrient and nutrition stresses via the mTOR and AMPK
  signal pathways. In response to nutrient deficiency or stress conditions, mTOR is
  activated following the suppression of the autophagy pathway, whereas energy withdrawal
  stimulates AMPK activation. This then inhibits mTOR activity by phosphorylation,
  which promotes the induction of autophagy. ER stresses, hypoxia, and ROS can induce
  autophagy by enhancing autophagy gene transcription or stimulating the AMPK pathway.
  (a) The highly conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase TOR is a key sensor and integrator
  of the amino acid pool signaling. mTORC1 comprises mTOR, Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40,
  and Deptor. (b) The growth factors regulate mTORC1 through the AKT-TSC1/TSC2 pathway.
  When growth factors exist, AKT is activated to inhibit TSC1/TSC2 to activate mTORC1,
  which inhibits the autophagy pathway. (c) The Rag GTPases can activate mTORC1 in
  response to amino acid signaling by directly binding and activating mTORC1. (d)
  ATG13 and ULK1, which form complexes with FIP200, can be directly phosphorylated
  by mTOR to inhibit ULK1 complex activity. (e) AMBRA1, with its ULK1-dependent pattern,
  induces autophagosome nucleation by promoting Beclin 1 interaction with VPS34. (f)
  The flux of L-glutamine has been found to be controlled by 2 transporters: SLC1A5
  and SLC7A5/SLC3A2. (g) Environmental AMP, ADP, or ATP can directly bind AMPK via
  the adenine nucleotide-binding sites of the γ subunit. (h) Under glucose deficiency,
  activation of AMPK promotes autophagy induction by increased ULK1 autophosphorylation.
  (i) Upon glucose deficiency, the activity of different VPS34 complexes, which include
  VPS34, p150, ATG14, and Beclin 1 or UVRAG, is regulated. (j) The ER is the site
  of cellular Ca2+ storage, and continuous removal of Ca2+ from the ER lumen to the
  cytosol can induce ER stress. An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ has been shown to lead
  to initiation of autophagy. The ROS-mediated autophagy induction is P53 and P38
  dependent. When ROS accumulate, P53 and P38 pathways activate to upregulate autophagic
  gene expression, which initiates autophagy. AMBRA1, autophagy and beclin regulator
