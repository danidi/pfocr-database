number: Figure 8
caption: BDNF pathway. The colors of the symbols correspond to levels of expression
  or activity, with darker shades of orange indicating an increase in Meth-SIVE, and
  darker shades of blue decreasing in Meth-SIVE. Solid lines signify direct interactions,
  and dashed lines signify indirect interactions. Blue lines denote inhibitory interactions,
  yellow denote findings inconsistent with the state of the downstream molecule, and
  black lines denote that the nature of the effect is not predicted. Figure adapted
  from an IPA-generated diagram.
