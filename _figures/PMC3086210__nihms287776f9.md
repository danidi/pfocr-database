caption: The left side of the diagram depicts the classical TGFβR/Smad pathway. TGFβ1,
  which interacts initially with a betaglycan co-receptor, activates TGFβRII, which
  then dimerizes with and phosphorylates TGFβRI. Activated TGFβRI phosphorylates receptor
  Smad2 and Smad3 (R-Smad-P), which in turn interacts with mediator Smad4. The complex
  then translocates to the nucleus and activates the promoters of genes with appropriate
  cis-acting elements, such as Col1a1. The right side of the diagram shows a modified
  pathway that we propose accounts for the function of N-propeptide (N-prop.). N-propeptide
  interacts with a homologous bi-dimeric TGFβR-like complex, indicated by quotation
  marks, in secretory vesicle membranes. “TGFβRI” is capable of phosphorylating only
  Smad3. “TGFβRI” and “TGFβRII” independently activate PI3K, which in a complex series
  of steps phosphorylates Akt. We hypothesize that pAkt interacts with pSmad3 and
  that this complex is then hindered from entering the nucleus and activating transcription,
  perhaps because of sequestration. The dashed arrows indicate that the latter steps
  are hypothetical.
