caption: Functional network overrepresented in the list of differentially expressed
  miRNAs in response to infection of bovine macrophages with Streptococcus agalactiae
  strain (a) ST103 and (b) ST12. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified 6 associated
  molecules with a network score of 16 for ST103 and 13 associated molecules with
  a network score of 31 for ST12
