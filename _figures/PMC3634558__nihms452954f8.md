caption: Proposed pathway illustrating the interplay between FAK and nesprins. In
  corneal epithelial cells, although expression of FAK is unaltered by topographic
  cues, expression of SYNE1/2 (Nesprin1/2) is differentially altered. Importantly,
  knockdown of FAK led to the suppressed expression of SYNE1 accompanied by an elevated
  expression of SYNE2. Our results suggest a role for SYNE2 in facilitating cell adhesion
  in the event of FAK knockdown.
