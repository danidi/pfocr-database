caption: Schematic representation of the E-cadherin (E-cad) interactions and signaling
  pathway. Newly synthesized E-cad are transported from the Golgi apparatus to the
  cell surface where they are available to engagement in intercellular interactions.
  The model presented reflects evidence that E-cad homodimers are involved in adherens’
  junctions. Loss of E-cad expression in epithelia results in loosening of intercellular
  contacts. E-cad regulates the intracytoplasmic pool of α-cat and β-cat acts as a
  signal transducer molecule in response to upstream Wnt pathway (). Briefly, the
  Wnt pathway is initiated by the binding of an extracellular Wnt ligand to a surface
  receptor composed of Frizzled, a seven transmembrane (7TM) molecule and low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (Lrp5/6). As a result of the Wnt pathway
  activation that mobilizes several intracytoplasmic molecules (including disheveled,
  adenomatous polyposis coli – APC binds axin and β-cat and inhibits glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β – and ΑΚΤ kinase) (; ; ), free cytoplasmic β-cat destruction is inhibited
  and β-cat translocates to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, β-cat activates expression
  of genes such as cyclin D1 or c-MYC, otherwise repressed by the T cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) (). To achieve trans-activation, β-cat recruits a range
  of nuclear co-factors including CBP/p300, Brg-1, and the adaptor protein BCL9 (;
  ; ; ). Cad-free p120ctn can also trigger the nuclear translocation of β-cat through
  its association with the Vav2 small GTPase and activation of JNK kinase (; ). It
  is worth noting that TCF/LEF-binding sites have been identified in the CDH1 gene
  promoter, which may permit a feedback control loop where β-cat might activate E-cad
  mRNA production (). E-cad expression can also be regulated by microRNAs (not shown),
  such as miR200, which favor E-cad mRNA expression (). Cells with greater E-cad abundance
  can sequester and thereby inhibit the ability of β-catenin to translocate to the
  cell nucleus to derepress the activity of its DNA-binding factor TCF/LEF. When unable
  to engage in interactions, E-cad enters an endocytic uptake and is directed to early
  sorting endosomes from which they can either be recycled back to the cell surface
  by recycling endosomes or routed from late endosomes to proteasome where they undergo
  degradation (for details see the reviews by (; ; ). During infection with bacteria,
  the pathogen can either regulate the expression of the CDH1 gene and thereby the
  cell-surface abundance of E-cad or trigger the catalytic cleavage of E-cad. This
  can result in the release of a cytosolic pool of β-catenin acting as a downstream
  effector in the Wnt signaling pathway and induction of oncogenic signals. The sE-cad
  can associate with intact E-cad present on other cells to alter Cad-dependent cellular
  behavior. It can also interact with the EGFR molecule to activate the ERK signaling
  pathway.
