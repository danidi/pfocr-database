caption: NSAIDs, Natural products, TCM and metformin can all activate AMPK. AMPK negatively
  regulates the mTOR signal pathway, resulting in inhibition of cancer proliferation
  and growth. Activated AMPK negatively regulates COX-2, a pro-inflammatory enzyme
  associated with tumorigenesis. AMPK can induce phosphorylation of tumor suppressor
  p53, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Activation of AMPK can also induce phosphorylation
  of ACC influencing lipid metabolism. Interactions leading to activation of molecular
  targets are indicated by arrows; those inhibited are indicated by a bar. Activation
  of AMPK can modulate multiple pathways leading to anticancer activities. TCM=Traditional
  Chinese Medicine; NSAIDs=Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
