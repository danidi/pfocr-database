caption: A. Protease pathways for neuropeptide biosynthesis. Pro-neuropeptides undergo
  proteolytic processing at dibasic residue cleavage sites by dual cysteine and serine
  subtilisin-like protease pathways. The cathepsin L cysteine protease cleavages pro-neuropeptides
  at paired basic residues. Resultant peptide intermediates require removal of N-terminal
  basic residues by aminopeptidase B or cathepsin H, and removal of C-terminal basic
  residues by carboxypeptidase E (CPE). The human-specific cathepsin V cysteine protease
  functions only in human cells for neuropeptide production, because the cathepsin
  V gene is present only in the human genome (and not in the genome of other species
  of organisms). The serine protease pathway consists of the pro-protein convertases
  (PC) PC1/3 and PC2 that cleave at paired basic residues. Resultant peptide intermediates
  then require removal of C-terminal basic residues by CPE.B. Pro-neuropeptide structures.
  Schematic illustration of the opioid pro-neuropeptide precursors are shown for proenkephalin
  (PENK), prodynorphin (PDYN), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC), as well as the precursors
  of neuropeptide Y (NPY), cholecystokinin (CCK), and galanin (GAL). Mature neuropeptides
  are indicated in colored areas within the pro-neuropeptides. Neuropeptides within
  the precursors are typically flanked by paired basic residues (Lys-Arg (KR), Lys-Lys(KK),
  Arg-Lys (RK), and Arg-Arg (RR)), and occasionally at monobasic Arg sites, that are
  recognized and cleaved by processing proteases to generate mature neuropeptides.
