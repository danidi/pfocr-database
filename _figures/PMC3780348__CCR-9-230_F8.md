caption: Schematic representation of the proposed signalling pathway involved in the
  prevention of cardiac hypertrophy by AT1 receptor blockade. In our scheme, the AT1
  receptor-sensitive part of the transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac
  hypertrophy is maladaptive and related to redox-sensitive p90RSK activation, NHE-1
  phosphorylation/activation, increase in intracellular Na+ and the consequent increase
  in intracellular Ca2+ through the NCX. The increased Ca2+ concentration would then
  activate the calcineurin-NFAT signalling pathway responsible for triggering an abnormal
  cardiac growth. On the other hand, the same mechanical stimulus (stretch of cardiac
  muscle) may trigger other prohypertrophic signals intended to compensate for the
  increased wall stress ("adaptive hypertrophy"). The fact that in vivo TAC-overloaded
  myocardium presents increased NHE-1 activity (evidenced by the increase in NHE-1.and
  p90RSK phosphorylation), supports that the stretch-induced activation of the exchanger
  detected in in vitro experiments persists after 7 weeks and it is able to be blunted
  by AT1 receptor blockade. Considering that A2 probably induces the activation of
  the myocardial MR, a contribution of the activation of this latter receptor to the
  development of inappropriate hypertrophy should be considered. Modified from Cingolani
