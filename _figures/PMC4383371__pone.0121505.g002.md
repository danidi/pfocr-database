caption: The key steps in type II polyketide biosynthesis—priming of the minimal polyketide
  synthase, extension of the polyketide chain by the ketosynthase α/β heterodimer
  to generate the poly-β-ketone intermediate, cyclization and aromatization of the
  poly-β-ketone by the immediate tailoring enzymes (aromatase/cyclase and cyclases)
  to form the cyclized core structure, and tailoring by various polyketide tailoring
  enzymes—are shown, using the elloramycin biosynthetic pathway as an example. Structural
  elements of the intermediates and final product are color-coded according to which
  enzymes catalyze their formation.
