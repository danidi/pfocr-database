caption: Working model of how the EphA1-activated SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling promotes EPCs’
  homing to HCC neovascularization. a In the HCC tumor mass, cEPCs incorporate into
  the EC layers and tumor vessels (angiogenesis) or migrate to non-vascularized tumor
  sites to facilitate the initial establishment of the tumorous endothelium, contributing
  to angiogenesis by providing structural support for nascent vessels (vasculogenesis).
  b In the tumor microenvironment, ephrinA1/Fc-forced expression of EphA1 activates
  its downstream signaling molecular AKT and mTOR and then increases the expression
  and secretion of SDF-1 to the tumor microenvironment. Secreted SDF-1 in turn binds
  with its receptor CXCR4 on the EPC cell membrane and contributes to the increased
  angiogenic potency of EPCs and their ability to chemotax to ECs and tumor cells
