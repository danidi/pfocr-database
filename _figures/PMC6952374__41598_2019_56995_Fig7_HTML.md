caption: Model for role of ALK5 and non-canonical androgen signaling in ADPKD. (a)
  TGFβ binds to ALK5 (TGFβ-receptor 1) or ALK4 (not shown) at the plasma membrane
  to activate the transcription factors SMAD2/3. SMAD2/3 in turn activate other TGFβ
  regulated genes to promote cyst expansion and disease progression by effects on
  inflammation, extracellular matrix accumulation, proliferation and apoptosis. (b)
  Androgens bind to androgen receptors (AR) in the cytoplasm resulting in translocation
  of the complex to the nucleus. The AR-androgen complex modulates gene transcription
  of androgen related genes in the canonical signaling pathway. Androgens can also
  bind to and inhibit non-genomic receptors such as L-type calcium channels, ZIP9,
  GPRC6A or OXER1 in a non-canonical, AR-independent pathway. Androgen activation
  of this non-canonical pathway promotes cyst expansion and upward tail curvature.
