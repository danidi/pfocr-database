caption: 'By surveying the literature on the function of each of the 20 gene products
  that were most dramatically changed in RSV transformed CEFs, we propose a model
  of their concerted action of promoting cellular transformation and tumor progression.
  Detailed study of individual genes rather than computer-aided annotation of the
  genes and their networks was employed to reveal functional outputs of changed transcripts,
  assuming that changes in transcription corresponded to changes in the protein level.
  Out of the 20 genes modulated by v-src, 10 could be linked to promoting a cancer
  phenotype based on their functional characteristics. These include: Follistatin
  (FST) that contributes to cell growth stimulation by titrating out activin(s) (ACT)
  and keeping TGF beta receptor (TGFBR) signaling in “low gear”. The low activity
  of TGFBR is also kept in check by decreased levels of TGF beta 3 (TGFB3). As a consequence,
  one of the TGF beta-induced genes (TGFBI) that encodes an adhesion protein, is down
  regulated, contributing to the anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells.
  Reduced levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, (TFPI) together with high levels
  of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU), play a role in tumor metastasis.
  Upregulated arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) should contribute to tumor development
  and progression by promoting inflammation. Downregulated type 2 deiodinase (DIO2)
  would decrease the levels of endogenous tri-iodothyronine and indirectly activate
  AP-1 transcription factor contributing to signals that enhance cell growth, inflammation
  and metastasis. The role of four and half LIM domain protein 1 (FHL1) in cell adhesion
  has been documented and the repression of FHL1, which is regulated by src-phosphorylated
  CAS, promotes anchorage-independent growth. Tumor suppressive action of nephroblastoma
  overexpressed gene (NOV) is linked to the control of cell adhesion. The reduced
  levels of NOV promote anchorage-independent growth. Induction of AHNAK, a gene that
  encodes a large phosphoprotein, may also contribute to the loss of contact inhibition.
