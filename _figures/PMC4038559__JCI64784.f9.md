caption: Ca2+ stored in the SR is released into the cytosol to activate cardiac muscle
  contraction and subsequently reaccumulated to promote relaxation. PLN phosphorylation
  on serine-16 as well as threonine-17 occurs via the EPAC/PLC/PKCε/CaMKII pathway
  (, ). However, under physiological conditions, PLN phosphorylation on serine-16
  by PKA rather than on threonine-17 by CaMKII is the major regulator of Ca2+ cycling
  in the heart (, ). Our current study indicates that PLN on serine-16 and RyR2 on
  serine-2808 and serine-2814 are phosphorylated by EPAC1 in addition to and independently
  of PKA or CaMKII. More importantly, hyperphosphorylation of PLN on serine-16 was
  recently reported to be associated not only with an increase in cardiac function
  in young animals (, ), but also with arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy after adrenergic
  stress, aortic banding, or ischemia (, , ). Our results suggest that Epac1-mediated
  hyperphosphorylation of PLN and RyR2 might be required for the development of heart
  failure as well as arrhythmia, in addition to PKA- or CaMKII mediated activation.
