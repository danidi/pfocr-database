caption: 'GLI proteins are regulated by PKA. PKA is a conserved inhibitor of GLI proteins,
  and the strength of HH signaling is inversely correlated with the activity of PKA
  in cells. The pathway regulating cAMP levels and PKA activity in cells is shown:
  proteins that increase PKA activity (red background) inhibit HH signaling, whereas
  those that decrease PKA activity (green background) enhance HH signaling. Among
  positive regulators of signaling, GPCRs coupled to Gαi reduce cAMP synthesis by
  inhibiting AC, phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze cAMP and ARHGAP36 inhibits PKA.
  GPCRs coupled to Gαs, such as GPR161, inhibit signaling by increasing cAMP synthesis
  by AC. The kinases GRK2 and GRK3 are strong positive regulators that may function
  either by downregulating GPCRs coupled to Gαs or by directly promoting SMO activity.
  The mechanism by which SMO antagonizes the PKA axis is not clear (dashed arrows
  with ‘?’), but may involve direct activation of Gαi, inhibition of a Gαs-coupled
  GPCR or activation of a Gαi-coupled GPCR. PKA is composed of catalytic (C) and regulatory
  (R) subunits.'
