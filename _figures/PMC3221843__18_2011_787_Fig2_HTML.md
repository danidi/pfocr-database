caption: Novel functions of MICAL proteins. a Role of MICAL-1 in CRMP-2 (collapsin
  response mediator protein 2) phosphorylation during axon guidance. Stimulation of
  axons with Sema3A induces H2O2 production by MICAL-1. H2O2 oxidizes CRMP-2 to form
  a disulfide-linked homodimer. Oxidized CRMP-2 is then reduced by thioredoxin (TRX)
  and TRX forms a disulfide link with one molecule of CRMP-2. Formation of a complex
  between CRMP-2 and TRX promotes phosphorylation of CRMP-2 by GSK-3β resulting in
  growth cone collapse []. Npn neuropilin. b Role of MICAL-3 in vesicle docking and
  fusion. During vesicle docking, Rab8 interacts with LL5β/ELKS-positive sites in
  the plasma membrane through MICAL-3, which binds Rab8 and ELKS. Redox activity of
  MICAL-3 promotes MICAL-3 turnover and remodeling of the docking complex leading
  to vesicle fusion []. c Role of MICAL-1 in NDR kinase-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling.
  Pro-apoptotic signals such as TNF-α induce activation of NDR1 and NDR2 kinases through
  the RASSF1A-MST1 pathway. MST1 phosphorylates the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of
  NDR kinases leading to their activation and apoptosis. MICAL-1 competes with MST1
  for binding to the C-terminal part of NDRs and thereby negatively regulates pro-apoptotic
  signaling through the MST1-NDR pathway. The signals that regulate MICAL-1 in this
  pathway are unknown []
