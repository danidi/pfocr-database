caption: Metabolism in pluripotent stem cells. (A) Glucose flux increases with the
  increase in GLUT1/3 expression, and the hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase
  1 (PFK1) enzymes become activated to sharply increase glycolytic flux. As a result,
  flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for nucleotide synthesis increases.
  (B) ATP synthesis is more dependent on the reactions carried out by glycolytic phosphoglycerate
  kinases (PGKs) and pyruvate kinases (PKs), and is decoupled from O2 consumption
  by the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). (C) Activation of threonine
  dehydrogenase (TDH), glycine C-acetyltransferase (GCAT) and glycine decarboxylase
  (GLDC) promotes Thr-Gly catabolism to feed the folate one-carbon (1C) pool, which
  in turn fuels S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and nucleotide synthesis to maintain pluripotency
  and proliferation. Ac-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GPI,
  glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PK, pyruvate kinase;
  TPI1, triosephosphate isomerase.
