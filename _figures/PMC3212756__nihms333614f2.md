caption: SRF regulates PRGs by virtue of association with different cofactors. In
  the absence of signaling (serum starvation) MAL can associate with G-actin, which
  prevents its nuclear residency as well as transcriptional activity. Upon signaling
  with serum via the Rho pathway, MAL dissociates from actin, which enhances its nuclear
  import and transcriptional activity, resulting in its recruitment to target genes.
  Concomitantly, actin polymerization is enhanced under these conditions. These changes
  in cytoskeletal organization are associated with proliferation, metastasis. In cardiac
  muscle cells, SRF can associate with other MRTF family cofactors (e.g., Myocardin)
  and regulate cardiac responses. In T cells, SRF associates with the NURF chromatin
  remodeling complex and regulates thymocyte development. In neuronal cells, SRF and
  its co-factors or CREB regulate different sets of genes to regulate neuronal plasticity
  versus survival respectively. Note, not all cofactors associate with SRF at the
  same time in same cells. For the sake of simplicity, only the MRTF/MKL cofactors
  are shown. The basal transcriptional machinery, comprising of general transcription
  factors is indicated by the light blue oval.
