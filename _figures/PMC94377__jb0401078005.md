caption: 'Schematic representation of arginine catabolism in Synechocystis sp. strain
  PCC 6803. [H], reducing power (normally in the form of NADH, reaction 6, or of NADH
  and FADH2, reaction 7); [N], nitrogen recovered through a transamination reaction
  (normally with 2-oxoglutarate as the acceptor); ∼P, energy-requiring reaction (energy
  provided by the hydrolysis of ATP). Enzymes: 1, arginase; 2, ornithine carbamoyltransferase
  (argF gene product, mutated in strain CSMJ1); 3, argininosuccinate synthetase; 4,
  argininosuccinate lyase; 5, ornithine transaminase; 6, Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  reductase (proC gene product, mutated in strain CSMJ39); 7, proline oxidase (putA
  gene product, mutated in strain CSMJ15); 8, glutamine synthetase.'
