caption: Astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway in X. dendrorhous. Initially, a molecule
  of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  (IPP) are combined to obtain geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) by means of the
  GGPP synthase. Secondly, two molecules of GGPP are coupled by the phytoene synthase
  (crtYB gene) to reach phytoene. The phytoene desaturase(crtI gene) introduces four
  double bonds in the molecule of phytoene to to obtain lycopene. Then, the lycopene
  cyclase (crtYB gene) converts one of the ψ acyclic ends of lycopene as β-ring to
  form γ-carotene, and subsequently the other to form β-carotene. Xanthophylls bioconversion
  in X. dendrorhous from β-carotene and γ-carotene includes the addition of two 4-keto
  groups in the molecule of β-carotene by the ketolase (K, discontinuous line) activity,
  and the inclusion of two 3-hydroxy groups by the hydroxylase (H, continuous dotted
  line) activity. Both K and H activities are presented in a single enzyme (astaxanthin
  synthetase; CrtS) encoded by a single gene (crtS). The cytochrome P450 reductase
  encoded by the crtR gene is a CrtS helper protein, providing with electrons for
  substrate oxygenation. The existence of a monocyclic pathway to DCD was also proposed
  []. Main carotenoids detected in X. dendrorhous broths are shown inside a rectangle
  in concordance with their natural colours. This figure has been based on Rodríguez-Sáiz
  and co-workers [].
