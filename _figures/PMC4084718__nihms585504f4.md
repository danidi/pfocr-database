caption: Contextualizing Sharpin within the NF-κB pathway by comparative analysis
  of mutant transcriptomes. (a) The heat map shows the effects of numerous mutations
  on 284 genes robustly induced by Pam3 (12 h) in macrophages. Blue indicates impaired
  gene induction compared to wild type, whereas pink indicates enhanced gene induction
  compared to wild type. The mutant with the most similar responses to Sharpincpdm
  was Nemopanr2 (correlation coefficient = 0.82). (b) SHARPIN is an essential adaptor
  downstream of the branch point defined by the panr2 mutation in NEMO. The signaling
  responses most strongly impaired by SHARPIN deficiency and NEMO L153P (panr2) are
  the phosphorylation of p105 and ERK, suggesting that p105 IκB activity and Tpl2
  sequestration are dominant regulators of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-induced proinflammatory
  cytokine expression (left). The greater deficiency in signaling and proinflammatory
  cytokine induction observed in panr2 compared with cpdm macrophages may result from
  SHARPIN-independent interactions between NEMO and the SHARPIN paralog RBCK1, which
  are also abrogated by NEMO L153P. TLR2-induced IκBα degradation, phosphorylation
  of p38 and c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK), and Nfkbia gene induction were unimpaired
  in cpdm macrophages and panr2 mutant macrophages, implying the existence of a branch
  of NEMO-dependent IκB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity
  that proceeds independently of SHARPIN and NEMO L153 (right). (Figure adapted from
  Reference .)
