caption: The canonical Notch signaling pathway. Jagged- and Delta-like ligands (dark
  blue) expressed on the surface of neighboring cells induce the proteolytic cleavage
  of the Notch extracellular domain (teal) from the intracellular domain (purple)
  by A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease (ADAM) and γ-secretase (lightning bolts). Following
  cleavage, the intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus where it associates
  with RBP-Jk (orange circle) to release the transcriptional co-repressors (red hexagon)
  and recruit co-activators (green hexagon and circle). These co-activators change
  the epigenetic landscape, allowing transcription to occur. NICD, Notch intracellular
  domain.
