caption: 'The connection between convolutional networks and the recognition pathway
  of the human visual cortex is illustrated. The recognition pathway in the visual
  cortex has multiple relays of information processing: retina, LGN, V1, V2, V4, PIT,
  AIT. Similarly, these relays of processing are represented in convolutional neural
  network layers. DoG, difference of Gaussians; LGN, lateral geniculate nucleus; LN,
  convolution—batch-normalization—RELU—max-pooling; RGC, retinal ganglion cell; T(*),
  transformation.'
