number: Figure 2
caption: Schematic of the PG biogenesis pathway in E. coli. Synthesis of PG precursors
  begins in the cytoplasm where nucleotide-linked precursors UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  and UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-A2pm-d-Ala-d-Ala are made. The latter
  precursor is linked to Und-P by MraY to generate lipid I. Then, MurG utilizes lipid
  I and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to synthesize lipid II. A lipid II flippase translocates
  lipid II across the inner membrane (IM) so that transglycosylases (TG) can polymerize
  the disaccharide-pentapeptide into glycan chains. In addition, TPs catalyze peptide
  bonds between stem peptides that are properly oriented in adjacent glycan chains,
  while CPs remove the terminal d-Ala residue of stem peptides. For more detailed
  description, refer to relevant reviews.,,
