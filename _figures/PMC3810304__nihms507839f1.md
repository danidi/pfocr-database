caption: 'Potential pathways by which CKD modulates the accumulation of arterial macrophages.
  CKD potentiates macrophage infiltration into the vessel wall by increasing the expression
  of vascular adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1 and selectins) and chemoattractants
  (CCL2 and MCSF). CKD modifies extracellular matrix components of the vasculature
  (for example, the oxidation or glycation of glycoproteins, collagen, and elastin),
  thereby increasing lipoprotein retention and the migratory capacity of macrophages.
  CKD impairment of macrophage egress from the vessel wall might involve disruption
  of the CCR7 pathway. Abbreviations: CCL2, CC-chemokine ligand 2; CCR7, CC-chemokine
  receptor 7; CKD, chronic kidney disease; ICAM1, intercellular adhesion molecule
  1; MCSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; VCAM1, vascular cell adhesion molecule
