caption: Figure 1. (A) Endothelial cell barrier dysfunction. During severe infections,
  endothelial activation and dysfunction may lead to the loss of microvascular endothelial
  barrier integrity, resulting in edema, multiple organ failure and death. Phosphorylation
  of adherens junction protein p120 catenin precipitates VE-cadherin internalization/junction
  disassembly. Endothelial integrity may also be compromised by rearrangements/degradation
  of the actin cytoskeleton. Molecular pathways implicated in this response include
  MYD88-ARNO binding that results in enhanced ARF6 signaling and decreased VE-cadherin
  localization at the cell surface. Endothelial activation may also cause an increase
  in the Ang-1 antagonist, Ang-2. Ang-2 binds to its cognate receptor, Tie2, and impedes
  the vascular stabilizing effects of Ang-1 by promoting proinflammatory endothelial
  responses and upregulating cell surface adhesion molecules. Vascular permeabilizing
  VEGF binds to VEGFR2 resulting in increased dissociation of VE-cadherin from the
  adherens junction through a VEGFR2-Src-VE-cadherin signaling pathway. (B) Endothelial
  cell barrier enhancement. SecinH3, a GEF (e.g., ARNO) inhibitor, inhibits ARF6-induced
  VE-cadherin internalization. Ang-1/Tie2 agonists activate Tie2 resulting in increased
  vascular quiescence via strengthening of endothelial cell junctions, downregulation
  of surface adhesion molecules and transdominate blockade of VEGR2 signaling. Fibrinopeptide
  Bβ15–42 provides barrier protection via maintenance of membrane VE-cadherin and
  inhibition of actin degradation via RhoA signaling inhibition. Upon binding its
  receptor Robo4, Slit2N reduces p120 catenin phosphorylation and inhibits ARF6, thereby
  increasing VE-cadherin retention at the cell surface. ANP administration decreases
  microvascular permeability via inhibition of RhoA-induced actin degradation and
  NFκB/P38 MAPK inhibition. S1P agonist administration reinforces the endothelial
  barrier via Rac1 and αvβ3 integrin signaling, resulting in formation and stabilization
  of cortical actin. Administration of S1P agonist enhances cortical actin formation
  (via Rac1 and αvβ3 integrin signaling) and downregulates IFN-α, thereby decreasing
  cytokine/chemokine production and enhancing endothelial cell barrier stability.
