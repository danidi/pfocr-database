caption: The mTOR pathway as a central signaling pathway causing malformations of
  cortical development and epilepsy. The mTOR pathway involves two complexes, the
  rapamycin-sensitive, mTORC1, and the relatively rapamycin-insensitive, mTORC2 (not
  shown), is regulated by a number of upstream signaling pathways, and controls many
  important downstream functions, including cell growth and proliferation. Genetic
  mutations in different components of the mTOR pathway have been identified that
  cause abnormal activation of mTORC1 and may lead to various malformations of cortical
  development and epilepsy syndromes involving increased cell growth and proliferation
  (blue). Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or other mTORC1 inhibitors may represent
  a rational therapy for epilepsy and malformations of cortical development due to
  abnormal mTOR pathway activation. AMPK - 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
  kinase; DEPDC5 - Dishevelled, Egl-10 and Pleckstrin domain-containing protein 5;
  FCD - focal cortical dysplasia; MCD - malformation of cortical development; FFEVF
  - familial focal epilepsy with variable foci; GATOR1 - GTPase-activating protein
  activity towards Rags; mTORC1 - mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; NPRL2 -
  nitrogen permease regulator 2-like protein; NPRL3 - nitrogen permease regulator
  3-like protein; PI3K - phosphoinositide-3 kinase; PMSE - polyhydramnios, megalencephaly,
  symptomatic epilepsy; PTEN - phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10; Rheb
  - Ras homolog enriched in brain; STRADα - STE20-related kinase adapter alpha; TSC1
  - tuberous sclerosis complex 1 protein; TSC2 - tuberous sclerosis complex 2 protein.
