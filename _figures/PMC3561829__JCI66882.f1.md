caption: (A) Aldosterone (Aldo) interaction with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
  induces SGK1 activity, which suppresses the ubiquitin ligase activity of Nedd4-2.
  Nedd4-2 normally catalyzes the addition of ubiquitin moieties (Ub) to ENaC (step
  i). Ubiquitylated ENaC is then removed from the plasma membrane (step ii) and undergoes
  degradation (or recycling) inside the cell (step iii). Poorly defined alternate
  pathways for SGK1 to stimulate ENaC independently of Nedd4-2 also exist. Ronzaud
  and colleagues () found that Nedd4-2 deletion increased in intracellular ENaC, suggesting
  that Nedd4-2 may affect step iii (dotted blue arrow) more than step ii. (B) Similar
  signaling pathway to NCC. An alternative pathway for SGK1 activation of NCC may
  involve WNK4, as described in text. In contrast with effects on ENaC, NCC abundance
  was increased at the plasma membrane by Nedd4-2 deletion, suggesting a defect at
  step ii, as shown by the dotted blue arrow. Note that sites of ubiquitylation on
  NCC have not been defined.
