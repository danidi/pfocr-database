caption: Iron and inflammatory signaling to hepcidin. Increases in serum or tissue
  iron promote transcriptional induction of hepcidin via the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway.
  Key upstream events are an increase in transferin saturation and the secretion of
  BMP6, and to a lesser extent BMP2 from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. BMP6
  binds to type I and II receptors on the surface of hepatocytes. With the critical
  aid of auxiliary factors, such as HJV, HFE, and TfR2, this leads to phosphorylation
  of regulatory SMAD1/5/8, recruitment of SMAD4, and translocation of the complex
  to the nucleus for binding to the hepcidin promoter. TfR2 likely operates as plasma
  iron sensor; TfR1 is thought to mediate uptake of transferrin-bound iron but can
  also negatively affect iron signaling by sequestering HFE. Iron signaling to hepcidin
  is negatively regulated by the serine protease matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6), which cleaves
  and inactivates components of the signaling complex. The major inflammatory signaling
  pathway to hepcidin involves IL-6, which binds to IL-6 receptors on hepatocytes.
  This promotes dimerization of the receptors and activation of associated JAK1/2,
  which in turn phosphorylate STAT3. Subsequently, phospho-STAT3 dimerizes and translocates
  to the nucleus for binding to the hepcidin promoter.
