caption: TrkA activation promotes anti-inflammatory pathways. In human monocytes the
  expression of TrkA is enhanced when TLR4 is activated. Auto-phosphorylation of TrkA
  induced by NGF binding activates intracellular pathways that influence the downstream
  signaling of TLR4. The NGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt inhibits NF-κB translocation
  in the nucleus. The inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 induced by Akt further prevents
  NF-κB activation, and the NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine
  genes. Concomitantly, NGF activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway induces the expression
  of IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), promoting a net anti-inflammatory
  effect. Black bold arrow shows dimerization of NGF and binding to TrkA. Red and
  green bold arrows show respectively decrease and increase of cytokine levels. Black
  slim arrows and black T bar show respectively activation and inhibition of molecular
  pathways. Dotted line arrow show nuclear translocation.

  description: TrkA activation promotes anti-inflammatory pathways. In human monocytes
    the expression of TrkA is enhanced when TLR4 is activated. Auto-phosphorylation
    of TrkA induced by NGF binding activates intracellular pathways that influence

    NF-κB translocation in the nucleus. The inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 induced
