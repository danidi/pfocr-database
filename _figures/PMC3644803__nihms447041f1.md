caption: AR acts to enhance cancer cell motility, while ERβ is inherently anti-motility.
  Systemic therapy targeting AR is used to slow down the progression of cancer, perhaps
  by tipping the balance towards ERβ signaling. However, local ROS production serves
  to inactivate ERβ, and thus allows unopposed AR activity. It is the balance in action
  of these 2 receptors that ultimately can determine the motility of the cancer cells.
  Thus, therapies targeted at swaying the balance towards ERβ activity may serve to
  limit cancer cell motility by utilizing an inherent regulatory pathway.
