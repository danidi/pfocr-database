caption: The canonical T2R signaling pathway. (A) The invariant portion of T2R-mediated
  signaling in the tongue and extraoral cells/tissues includes bitter compounds binding
  (outside the cell; not depicted) with the receptors to increase intracellular calcium.
  (B) The remaining components of the T2R pathway in the taste bud.
