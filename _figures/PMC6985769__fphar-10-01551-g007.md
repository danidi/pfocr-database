caption: Potential mechanisms of luteolin in ameliorating intracerebral hemorrhage
  (ICH)-induced secondary brain injury (SBI). Luteolin enhances autophagy, activates
  the sequestosome 1 (p62)/kelch‐like enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase(ECH)‐associated protein
  1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, and plays
  an important role in neuroprotection and anti-oxidative processes, which suggests
  that luteolin may represent a promising drug for ameliorating ICH-induced SBI.
