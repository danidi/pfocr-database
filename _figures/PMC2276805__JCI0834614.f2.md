caption: Evidence from experimental models, from rare human genetic conditions, and
  from HIV-associated TB demonstrate that the Th1-mediated IL-12–IFN-γ axis is essential
  for prevention of progressive disease. Priming this response provides the major
  focus for the vaccine candidates currently being assessed in clinical trials. A
  broader view of the immune response suggests multiple alternative strategies that
  may influence the outcome of infection, including delivery of IFN-γ by alternative
  lymphocyte subsets, release of bacteria by cytolysis of poorly microbicidal cells,
  and activation of IFN-γ–independent pathways of mycobacterial killing. It is probable
  that all of these activities are subject to regulatory control mechanisms in vivo,
  and successful vaccination may ultimately depend on establishing or resetting multicellular
  immune networks rather than overactivation of a single pathway.
