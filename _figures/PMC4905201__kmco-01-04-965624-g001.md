caption: Alterations in the PTHrP→PTHR1→PKA pathway in osteosarcoma. (A) In normal
  osteoblasts, autocrine or paracrine parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)
  binds and activates its receptor, PTHR1. Activation of PTHR1 causes the generation
  of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP through adenylyl cyclase. cAMP induces the dissociation
  of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) from its regulatory subunits, including the
  α regulatory subunit of PKA type I (PRKAR1A). Once activated, PKA is able to move
  to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates and activates CREB. This leads to the activation
  of target genes downstream of PTHR1 signaling. (B) In osteosarcoma cells, various
  aberrations in the PTHrP→PTHR1→PKA pathway that result in increased activation of
  the PKA pathway have been described. 1. Elevated production of PTHrP that can bind
  PTHR1 and stimulate cAMP formation. 2. Increased surface copy number of PTHR1. 3.
  Mutations in PRKAR1A that lead to increased PKA activity. 4. Amplification of Prkaca,
  which encodes the catalytic component of PKA.
