caption: Fig. 7. Regulation of cellular protein synthesis by P56. Transcription of
  561 mRNA is induced by IFN or virus/dsRNA using two different signaling pathways.
  P56, produced upon translation of 561 mRNA, binds to the P48 subunit of eIF-3 and
  blocks its function in peptide chain initiation. As a result, synthesis of cellular
  proteins, including that of P56 itself, is inhibited.
