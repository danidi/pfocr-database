caption: Cytosolic DNA sensing pathways. A panel of DNA sensors exists to mediate
  type I IFN induction upon HSV infection. cGAS, DDX41, DNA-PK, and IFI16 signal via
  the adaptor STING. DAI activates TBK1 and triggers NF-κB via RIP1/RIP3. RNA PolIII
  transcribes DNA into RNA that serves as a RIG-I ligand. Furthermore, DHX9, DHX36,
  and Ku70 relay signals to activate IRF7 and IRF1. Although MRE11 serves as a DNA
  sensor, it does not mediate HSV recognition. LRRFIP1 acts via a β-catenin-dependent
  pathway but its role in HSV recognition has not been reported. IFI16 assembles inflammasomes
  in response to HSV infection but AIM2 is not required in HSV-induced inflammasome
  activation.
