caption: A simplified diagram depicting the proposed signaling pathway of the CB1
  activation that inhibits the activity of small GTPase RhoA to inhibit motility of
  PC-3 cells. PC-3 cells have undetectable endogenous AEA and very low expression
  of FAAH, a membrane enzyme that hydrolyzes AEA and 2-AG (, ). However, PC-3 cells
  have high specific hydrolysis activity for 2-AG (, ) in the membrane fractions ().
  The binding sites of CB1 have been suggested to be in the transmembrane domains
  (–). Thus, the inhibition of enzymes hydrolyzing EC is important for an increase
  of EC concentrations, the CB1 activation and the activity of CB1 signaling pathway(s)
  to inhibit cell motility.
