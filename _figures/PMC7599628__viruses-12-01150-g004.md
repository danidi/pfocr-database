caption: Initial immune response to any pathogen involves the activation of innate
  immunity. Innate immunity is activated by germline encoded PRRs which recognize
  PAMPs and DAMPs of the microbes. Specific PRRs mainly include membrane-bound several
  TLRs, cytosolic DNA sensor, e.g., STING, Rig -1 like receptor (RLR), MDA5, NOD-like
  receptor, all of which coordinate with the host innate immune responses through
  the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), activator protein 1 (AP-1) and
  interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-signaling pathway which triggers the antiviral
  interferons type I (IFNI) pathway. Activated innate immunity can commence the adaptive
  immunity by triggering both the T-cells and B-cells.
