caption: Distinct functions for TPPII in the nucleus and cytosol. (a) TPPII contributes
  to protein turnover in concert with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
  and other cytosolic peptidases. The expression and activity of TPPII is influenced
  by the following. (1) The cellular recycling of amino acids from protein building
  blocks, that is, through degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway,
  inhibited recycling leads to increased activity of TPPII [, , ]. (2) The external
  supply of amino acids. Dilution of cell culture medium in PBS increases TPPII levels
  []. (3) The organismal demand for amino acids. An increased demand, as observed
  in cachexia also increases TPPII activity [, ]. (4) Endogenous demand for amino
  acids; a factor that potentially increases TPPII; remains to be tested. (b) In response
  to ROS production and DNA damage, TPPII shifts its localization from cytosolic to
  nuclear. This may contribute to the DNA damage response and apoptosis triggering,
  a model that is under debate. The cytosolic-nuclear shift of TPPII may create a
  link between mitochondrial respiration and DNA damage signaling in the nucleus.
