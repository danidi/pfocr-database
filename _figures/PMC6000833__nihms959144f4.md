caption: a ∣ Relief of negative feedback. At steady state, hyperactivated ERK downstream
  of mutant BRAF suppresses RAS due to negative feedback. Addition of a RAF inhibitor
  results in relief of negative feedback and RAS activation, which in turn promotes
  increased flux through ERK signalling and RAF dimerization,,. Activation indicated
  by a green halo around the protein. b ∣ Pathway reactivation due to paracrine signalling
  by components of the tumour microenvironment (TME). Stromal cells in the TME release
  growth factors (exemplified here by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)) and cytokines,
  which promote resistance to RAF inhibitors by activating parallel survival pathways,
  such as PI3K signalling, or by activating RAS-. c ∣ Structural constraints. RAF
  dimerization promotes an adaptive response to αC-OUT RAF inhibitors due to negative
  allostery for inhibitor binding to the second protomer of a RAF dimer when the first
  is occupied by inhibitor. αC-IN RAF inhibitors are predicted to overcome this resistance
  mechanism by binding with similar affinity to both protomers of the RAF dimer. All
  of these mechanisms of adaptive response are interconnected and converge upon structural
  constraints for inhibitor binding. Relief of negative feedback promotes upstream
  receptor tyrosine kinase activation, which may be further enhanced by growth factors
  and cytokines released in the TME. Both mechanisms promote increased flux in the
  pathway and levels of active RAF molecules. They also promote RAF dimerization,
  which prevents effective RAF inhibition by current clinical αC-OUT RAF inhibitors
  due to negative allostery. GAB1, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2-associated
  binding protein 1; GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2.
