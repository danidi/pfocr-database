caption: '2D 1H{13C}-HSQC NMR analyses reveal in vivo metabolic reprogramming in human
  lung tumor tissues resected from an NSCLC patient infused with 13C6-glucose (adapted
  from Fan et al. []). U-13C6-glucose was infused into the patient 2–3 h prior to
  resection and cryopreservation of cancer and surrounding benign (normal) tissues.
  The liquid N2-frozen tissues were pulverized and extracted for polar metabolites,
  which were analyzed by 2D 1H{13C}-HSQC at 14.1 T. The 1D 13C projection spectrum
  is shown in (A), where the increase in 13C abundance of various metabolites at different
  carbon positions is evident in cancer versus paired benign tissues. The pathway
  scheme in (A) traces 13C atoms from 13C6-glucose into intermediates of glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the Krebs cycle, Ser-Gly pathway, and uracil biosynthesis.
  Based on this scheme and 13C abundance data in (A), the cancer tissue displays enhanced
  capacity for all of these pathways. ●: 12C;  ,  : respective 13C tracing of pyruvate
