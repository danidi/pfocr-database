caption: Differential ganglioside metabolism pathways between Hs 578T and MDA-MB-231
  breast cancer cells. Glycosyltransferase gene expression profile obtained by qPCR
  were mapped onto a subpart of the “Ganglio-sphingolipid metabolism” pathway from
  WikiPathways [,] based on the differential expression between two cell lines. In
  the squared nodes, colors vary from blue (≤ −2) to white (= 0) and red (≥ 2) to
  indicate the repression to the over-expression of the glycosyltransferase gene in
  Hs 578T compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (thick black arrows). Quantitative data concerning
  the relative amounts of gangliosides obtained by MALDI-QIT-TOF mass spectrometry
  were added to the pathway based on the comparison between Hs 578T and MDA-MB-231
  cells. In the octagonal nodes, colors vary from green (≤ −8) to white (= 0) and
  fuchsia (≥ 8) to indicate a restraint to a rise of the amount of a given ganglioside
  based on the differences observed between the two cell lines. Grey color indicates
  the absence of any available quantitative data about the expression.
