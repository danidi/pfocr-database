caption: 'Nodes of the mirror neuron system (MNS) and areas of top-down control as
  included in the social top-down response modulation (STORM) model, EP-M model and
  broken mirror hypothesis (BMH) of autism spectrum condition. The crosses indicate
  suggested locations of abnormality/dysfunction proposed by different models. (a)
  This includes all regions and pathways across the three models. (b) This represents
  global dysfunction of the MNS stated by the BMH. (c) This demonstrates dysfunction
  to the Mimicry Pathway (M) but no dysfunction to the planning (P) or emulation (E)
  pathway of the MNS, proposed by the EP-M model. (d) This represents how top-down
  dysfunction could disrupt appropriate MNS functioning as suggested by the STORM
  model.PFC: prefrontal cortex; IFG: inferior frontal gyrus; IPL: inferior parietal
  lobe; MTG: middle temporal gyrus.'
