caption: Bone metastasis leads to skeletal muscle weakness. Metastatic cancer cells
  induce the breakdown of bone and the release of TGF-β into the circulation. This
  increase in TGF-β signals myofibers in skeletal muscle to promote NOX4 expression
  that, in turn, causes post-translational modifications of the ryanodine receptor
  channel (RyR1) and calcium leaks from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Altered calcium
  homeostasis alters the regulation of sarcomere proteins, leading to contractile
  dysfunction and muscle weakness.
