caption: Pathway to protein phosphorylation and cysteine modification of sarcoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+ handling proteins. a In response to an increased sympathetic drive,
  catecholamines bind to and alter structural conformation of G-protein (Gs) coupled
  β-AR on the sarcolemma. The resultant activation of adenyl cyclase (Ac) stimulates
  3′-5′cyclic adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) generation, activating PKA. PDE4 acts
  to modulate cAMP production. CaMKII is reported to be activated by a rise in cellular
  cAMP; however, the prevailing consensus supports a Ca2+-mediated mechanism. PKA
  and CaMKII target and phosphorylate Ca2+ handling proteins including the LTCC, RyR2
  and phospholamban (PLN), depicted by blue circles. In healthy muscle, the ensuing
  increase in systolic SR Ca2+ release through RyR2 and SR Ca2+ uptake through SERCA2a
  (SERCA) during diastole drives a larger Ca2+ transient and enhances contractility. Only
  proteins involved in or modified by β-AR signalling are included in this figure,
  for simplicity. b The major sources of reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen
  species (ROS/RNS) in the heart are xanthine oxidase (XO), nitric oxide synthase
  (NOS), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase or NOX)
  and the mitochondria, all of which generate superoxide (O2.-), which can S-oxidize
  cysteine residues. NOS produce nitric oxide (NO), which in the presence of O2−,
  forms peroxynitrite (ONOO−); these processes can both S-nitrosylate cysteine residues
  and nitrate tyrosine residues. The major targets of ROS/RNS include the LTCC, NCX,
  RyR2, CaMKII, SERCA and PLN, depicted by red circles. For simplicity, and as there
  has been no role implicated in failing heart, the process of cysteine S-glutathionylation
  is not presented in this figure. In healthy muscle, the basal levels of tyrosine
  and cysteine modification (maintained by the opposing antioxidant system) have a
  potential ionotropic role to increase Ca2+ release under conditions of increased
  heart rate. Only proteins involved in or modified by ROS/RNS signalling are included
  in this figure, for simplicity
