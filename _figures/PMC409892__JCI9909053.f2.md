caption: Apoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling pathways. (a) Death pathways. Death
  ligands typified by FasL, TNF-α, Apo2L, and Apo3L bind to and activate death receptors
  (e.g., Fas). This activation can be blocked by the presence of nonfunctioning decoy
  receptors (DcRs). Receptor trimerization and activation leads to the recruitment
  of adaptor molecules (such as FADD) that can recruit and activate caspase 8. Activation
  of caspase 8 can be blocked by inhibitors of apoptosis such as cIAP-1 and cIAP-2,
  as well as TRAF-1 and TRAF-2. (b) The NF-κB survival pathway. In addition to eliciting
  a death signal, TNF-α transmits a survival signal. Here, binding to the TNF-R1 receptor
  leads to the recruitment of adaptors that are capable of indirectly activating IκB
  kinase 2 (IKK-2), which phosphorylates IκB, leading to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
  of IκB. Loss of IκB allows NF-κB to localize to the nucleus and to induce the expression
  of antiapoptotic factors such as the IAPs, the TRAFs, and Bfl-1. (c) The PI3K/Akt
  pathway. Soluble growth and survival factors such as IL-3 and IGFs bind to and activate
  transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Activation and phosphorylation of the receptors
  allows the recruitment and activation of PI3K. PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol
  3,4-bisphosphate (PI3,4P2) to generate PIP3. This step is antagonized by the product
  of the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN, which acts as a lipid phosphatase. PIP3 activates
  downstream targets, such as the serine-threonine kinase Akt. Akt, in turn, phosphorylates
  and inactivates a number of substrates including the proapoptotic proteins Bad,
  caspase 9, and FKHR, and thereby inhibits apoptosis. (d) The p53 pathway. Cellular
  stresses — particularly DNA damage —are sensed by proteins such as ATM and DNA-PK,
  which phosphorylate and stabilize p53. p53 induces apoptosis by an as-yet undefined
  mechanism. The action of p53 is opposed by Mdm2, which binds to and inactivates
  p53. Mdm2, in turn, is inhibited by p19arf, the product of the INK4A tumor-suppressor
  gene.
