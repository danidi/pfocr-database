caption: PPI network of the DEGs, and the expression levels of the hub genes in PDAC
  tissues and normal tissues. (A) The Cytoscape software was used to construct a DEG-based
  PPI network. Upregulated genes are marked in red, while downregulated genes are
  marked in blue. (B) BiNGO was used to construct the biological processes of the
  hub genes. The color depth of the nodes refer to the corrected P-value of ontologies,
  while the size of the nodes refer to the number of genes that are involved in the
  ontologies. (C) The Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database was
  used to analyze the differences in the expression levels the hub genes between PDAC
  tissues and normal pancreatic tissues. *P<0.05. PPI, protein-protein interaction;
  DEGs, differentially expressed genes; PDAC, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
