caption: 'Main steps of arginine metabolism. Arginine may be derived from diet or
  endogenously synthesized from the amino acid citrulline as an immediate precursor.
  This de novo biosynthetic pathway involves the conversion of citrulline to arginine
  catalyzed: first by arginosuccinate synthase (ASS1) catalyzing the conversion of
  citrulline and aspartate to arginosuccinate, with the concomitant use of one molecule
  of ATP converted to AMP and PPi; then, by arginossuccinate lyase, catalyzing the
  conversion of one molecule of arginosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. The catabolism
  of arginine implies either the conversion of arginine to NO, catalyzed by nitric
  synthases (not shown) or the conversion of arginine to ornithine and urea catalyzed
  by arginase. Ornithine may generate citrulline through ornithine transcarbamylase
  (OTC), polyamines through ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) or proline through ornithine
  amino transferase (OAT).'
