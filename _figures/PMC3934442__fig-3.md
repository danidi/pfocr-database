caption: Rho/ROCK crosstalk with NO in the vascular wall. Endothelium-derived NO diffuses
  into VSMCs, stimulates synthesis of cGMP and leads to the activation of cGK. cGK
  blocks Rho/ROCK signaling by phosphorylating GTP and GDP-bound RhoA at Ser188, which
  increases Rho binding to Rho GDI and results in the sequestration of RhoA into the
  cytosol. On the other hand, Rho/ROCK in endothelial cells inhibits eNOS expression
  and activity leading to endothelial dysfunction that underlies vascular diseases,
  such as atherosclerosis. cGK, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; cGMP, cyclic GMP; eNOS,
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle
  cells.
