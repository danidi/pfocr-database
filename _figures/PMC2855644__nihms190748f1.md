caption: Laminin, which is present in the extracellular matrix surrounding the myofiber
  membrane, binds to α dystroglycan. This interaction requires the O-mannosyl-linked
  glycans present in the middle third of the α dystroglycan molecule. α dystroglycan
  binds to β dystroglycan, which spans the muscle membrane. The intracellular domain
  of β dystroglycan binds to dystrophin, which links the complex both to actin and
  to number of signaling components. The sarcoglycans are additional transmembrane
  components within the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex.
