caption: (A) Pathways implicated in responses to infection by Drechmeria coniospora.
  Drechmeria spores adhere to the cuticle and extend hyphae that penetrate the epidermis
  . A signal transduction pathway involving PKC, the SARM ortholog TIR-1, and the
  p38 MAPK cascade is involved in upregulation of transcription of the nlp-class AMPs
  , . A G-protein coupled receptor may be involved early in recognition of damage,
  as the same pathway is activated by sterile wounding; conversely, the Tribbles-like
  kinase is required for the response to infection but not to wounding. The GATA factor
  ELT-3 appears to be permissive for nlp upregulation . Drechmeria infection also
  triggers transcription of caenacin AMPs; cnc induction is partly independent of
  the p38 MAPK cascade and involves a non-cell-autonomous TGFβ signal, possibly from
  neurons . (B) Epidermal wounding by microinjection needle or laser irradiation triggers
  expression of the NLP-type AMPs, via a pathway similar to that involved in Drechmeria
  responses, but does not induce the cnc genes . A Gαq-PLCβ-Ca2+signalling pαathway
  is involved in wound closure after puncture wounding ; DAPK-1 can negatively regulate
  both the innate immune response pathway and the wound closure pathway. (C) Infection
  by the bacterium M. nematophilum induces swelling of rectal epidermal cells. Genes
  required for bacterial adhesion are likely involved in biogenesis of the surface
  coat and/or epicuticle. M. nematophilum infection triggers expression of a variety
  of genes, some of which are involved in the epidermal swelling response . Swelling
  requires phospholipase C β (EGL-8)  and the ERK MAPK cascade ; it is not known if
  all transcriptional responses are ERK-dependent. (D) Osmotic stress may be sensed
  by structures at cuticle furrows coupled to epidermal cell surface receptors. Epidermal
  responses to hyperosmotic shock include elevated transcription of gpdh-1 (leading
  to glycerol accumulation) and expression of a subset of AMPs .
