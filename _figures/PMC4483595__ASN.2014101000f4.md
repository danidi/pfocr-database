caption: Proposed mechanism to explain the protective effect of CFHR1,3 deletion on
  the development of IgAN. CFHR1 and CFHR3 proteins can bind to C3b in competition
  with FH. The regulatory activities of CFHR1 and CFHR3 are less efficient than those
  of FH. CFHR1,3 deletion, thus, allows FH to bind C3b effectively and thereby to
  strongly inhibit the initiation and amplification of the alternative pathway cascade.
