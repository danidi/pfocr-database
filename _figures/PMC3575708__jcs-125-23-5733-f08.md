caption: Model for Ctip2 functions in the proliferation and differentiation of epidermal
  keratinocytes. In proliferative keratinocytes, Ctip2 interacts with the EGFR promoter
  and positively regulates EGFR expression, thereby promoting keratinocyte proliferation
  and survival. Activated EGFR signaling also promotes Ctip2 phosphorylation and inhibits
  Ctip2 expression at the mRNA level (proliferating conditions). Keratinocytes entering
  spinous layers after exiting the basal layer express both Ctip2 and Notch1. Upon
  depletion of growth factors from cultured keratinocytes, equivalent to the exit
  of cells from the basal compartment, Ctip2 is recruited to the Notch1 promoter,
  positively regulating the expression of Notch1 and triggering onset of early differentiation.
  Subsequently elevated extracellular calcium levels facilitates onset of late differentiation
  and Ctip2 is degraded by high-calcium signaling through the SUMO–Ub–proteasomal
  pathway.
