caption: Model for Gq-Rho-ERK signaling. Gq directly activates Trio and Rho (solid
  arrow) (). The core ERK cascade acts either downstream of Rho or in parallel (dashed
  arrows) to modulate locomotion behavior. ERK activation occurs independently of
  the extracellular growth factor LIN-3, its receptor LET-23, or Ras/LET-60. It is
  possible that Raf/LIN-45 is activated by a Ras family member other than the canonical
  worm Ras/LET-60. Our model suggests that Gq-Rho signaling regulates the worm waveform
  by acting cell autonomously in head acetylcholine neurons in an ERK-dependent pathway.
  By contrast, we propose that Gq-Rho signaling regulates synaptic transmission at
  the neuromuscular junction by acting in an ERK-independent pathway, possibly in
  the ventral cord motorneurons themselves.
