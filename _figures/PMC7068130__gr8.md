caption: The Molecular Mechanism of Loss of Function of TLR9 Might Play a Major Role
  for NPC Susceptibility in Specific Ethnic Groups of NE IndiaSome populations, called
  “mongoloids,” show a significantly higher incidence for NPC. Their similar characteristics
  are related to lipid metabolism via NF-κβ signaling pathway. Biogenesis of BAT in
  these populations requires an evolutionarily conserved protein Plac8, the transcription
  factor C/EBPβ, and the zinc finger protein Prdm16. Plac8 expression and function
  may be regulated by its interaction with phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), which
  can regulate TLR9-mediated type I IFN production. Another gene called the uncoupling
  protein 1 (UCP1) decreases TLR9 expression in mongoloids during colder climates.
  NF-κβ signaling pathway itself can suppress the promoter of TLR9 and make it nonfunctional.
  Therefore the genes involved in lipid metabolism and TLR9 regulation, and the NF-κβ-mediated
  signals, all might contribute to NPC susceptibility. In the present study, we report
  a set of polymorphisms in the 3′ end of exon 2 of TLR9 gene, i.e., amino acid modifications
  in the N-terminal region of the TLR9 protein. Polymorphisms in this region might
  affect the structure-function relationship of TLR9 and downstream signaling pathways
  related to EBV-infected NPC occurrence in NE Indian populations.
