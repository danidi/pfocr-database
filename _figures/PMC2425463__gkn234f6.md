caption: Comparison of pathway analysis on the data set using the MBCB, RMA or RAW
  background corrections. (A) IPA canonical pathway analysis depicting the top 9 signaling
  pathways that changed in AML tissues. The MBCB methodology identified more genes
  than either methodology in most categories. It also identified the death receptor
  pathway as the pathway that showed the most differences between the MBCB, RMA and
  RAW methods. (B) Scheme of death receptor pathway overlaid with the expression ratio
  of the MBCB data set. (C) Scheme of death receptor pathway overlaid with the expression
  ratio of the RMA data set. (D) Scheme of the death receptor pathway overlaid with
  the expression ratios from the RAW data set. Red, over-expressed in AML; green,
  under-expressed in AML; white, no significant change between AML and normal tissues.
  The cartoons show activation of Tnfr2 and NF-kappaB signaling in the MBCB data set
  and the failure of detection of the same pathway by the RMA and RAW data sets.
