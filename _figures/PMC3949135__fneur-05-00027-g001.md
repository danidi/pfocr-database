caption: Schematic Ig synthesis pathway. Naïve B-cells are classically recruited in
  lymphoid organs where they undergo somatic hypermutation, proliferate, and recirculate
  as short-lived plasmablasts (PB). PB migrate to bone marrow, differentiate to long-lived
  plasma cells (PC), and synthesize the bulk of plasmatic IgG. However, secondary/tertiary
  lymphoid organs may also retain PC in survival niches, where they participate in
  IgG synthesis.
