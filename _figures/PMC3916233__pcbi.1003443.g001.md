caption: 'A: A yeast bud grows first in a particular direction (polar growth) and
  eventually switches to growth in all directions (isotropic growth). B: The Rho1
  signaling pathway starts with inactive Rho1 flowing into the bud attached to membrane
  vesicles. Rho1 is then activated and binds to Pkc1, forming an upstream system.
  The downstream system describes the activation of the PP2A/Zds1 dimer leading up
  to the modification of cell cycle regulatory protein Cdk1. Multiple intermediate
  feedback loops are shown to allow for robust hysteretic and switch-like behavior.'
