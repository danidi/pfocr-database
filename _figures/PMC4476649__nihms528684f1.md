caption: 'Cyclic AMP accumulates in T cells in the region of lipid rafts in response
  to TCR activation, and more globally in response to strong Gs-coupled A2AR activation.
  Cyclic AMP inhibits proximal TCR signaling through a pathway involving activation
  of protein kinase A-1 (PKA-1) and C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) to inhibit lymphocyte-specific
  protein kinase (Lck) and to reduce recruitment to CD3 of zeta-chain-associated protein
  kinase 70 (zap-70). PKA-1 also phosphorylates (indicated by red dots) and inhibits
  NF-AT. NF-AT activation is reversed by the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase,
  calcineurin. TCR-induced accumulation of cAMP near lipid rafts is reduced upon CD28
  stimulation due to the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) to produce
  PIP3. This results in translocation from the cytosol to the lipid raft of a complex
  consisting of AKT, PDE4 and β-arrestin (β-arr) by binding of the plextrin homology
  (PH) domain of AKT to PIP3. PDE4 degrades cAMP to relieve inhibition of TCR signaling.
