caption: Signal pathways in systemic regulation of hepcidin. Many stimuli regulate
  expression of Hepcidin gene (HAMP) in the liver. One of the best known positive
  modulator is represented by Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) that bind BMP-Receptor
  (BMP-R) on the surface of the hepatocyte resulting in SMAD-mediated induction of
  HAMP transcription. Hemojuvelin (mHJV) increases this signal acting as BMP co-receptor
  on the cell surface. In contrast, the soluble forms of HJV (sHJV), produced by HJV
  cleavage by furin at position 335, act as “decoy-receptor” competing with mHJV for
  the BMP ligand. Matriptase-2 (Mt2), which is activated by iron deficiency and by
  hypoxia, is the most potent inhibitor of hepcidin production by cleaving mHJV on
  hepatocyte surface and so preventing BMP-mediated hepcidin production. HAMP expression
  is also stimulated by inflammation, via the soluble mediator Interleukin-6 (IL6)
  and its specific membrane receptor (IL6-R) activating a STAT3-dependent signal pathway
  promoting HAMP transcription. HFE, TfR2 and TfR1 positively influence HAMP transcription
  in a ERK1/2 mediated way acting as a functional molecular complex on the cell surface
  playing a primary role in the hepatocyte sensing of circulating iron levels. Erythropoiesis,
  via the soluble mediator Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) and Twisted Gastrulation
  (TWSG) 1, and hypoxia, via Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), decrease HAMP expression
  (see text for further explanation).
