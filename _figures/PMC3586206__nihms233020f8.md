caption: Schematic summarizing the effects of MIF on the canonical MAPK pathways.
  (A) MIF activates signalling through ERK1/2, whereas evidence for effects on the
  p38 pathway has been scarce. Both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of MIF on JNK
  signalling have been observed. (B) Rapid stimulation of the JNK pathway by exogenous
  MIF is dependent on CXCR4 and CD74.
