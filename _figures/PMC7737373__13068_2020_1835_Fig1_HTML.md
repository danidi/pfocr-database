caption: 'Biosynthesis of itaconic acid. Glucose is taken up from the medium and converted
  into pyruvate via glycolysis. Pentose sugars are converted to pyruvate via pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). Box shows the reaction stoichiometry and resulting respiratory
  quotients (RQ) using different pathways: Pathway a: To reach the maximum theoretical
  yield of 1 mol/mol glucose, itaconic synthesis must involve anaplerotic CO2 fixation:
  for each mol of glucose, 1 mol of the produced pyruvate is transported to the mitochondrion
  and 1 mol of pyruvate is converted to malate in the cytosol (1a). In the mitochondrion,
  pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA (1b) and further to citrate by citrate synthase
  (2) using oxaloacetate. Citrate is then converted into cis-aconitate by aconitase
  (3). Via a mitochondrial tricarboxylate-malate shuttle (4), cis-aconitate is exported
  to the cytosol in exchange for malate, which replenishes the oxaloacetate used for
  citrate synthesis. In the cytosol cis-aconitate is then directly decarboxylated
  to itaconic acid by cis-aconitate decarboxylase (5) in the case of A. terreus or
  first isomerized into transaconitate before being decarboxylated in the case of
  U. maydis. Finally, itaconic acid is exported outside the cell (6). The respiratory
  quotient for this pathway would be 0.67. Pathway b: If itaconic acid is produced
  without anaplerotic CO2 fixation, the pathway has to be exclusively fed from acetyl-CoA
  (1a). In this case, the spent C4 acids such as oxaloacetate also have to be replenished
  by reactions relying on acetyl-CoA. Hence, 1/3 of the carbon is lost into CO2 at
  pyruvate decarboxylase step, which is why a minimum of 1.5 mol of glucose will then
  be needed for producing 1 mol of itaconic acid, resulting in a maximum yield of
  0.67 mol/mol glucose. The respiratory quotient for this pathway would be 0.89. Pathway
  c: The RQ for respiration biomass formation can be considered to be 1. Depending
  on the share of substrate used for respiration or biomass formation, the itaconic
  acid yield can be anywhere between 0 and 1 mol/mol glucose while the corresponding
  respiratory quotient would be between 1 and 0.67, respectively. However, when CaCO3
  is used in the medium, the itaconic acid will react to calcium itaconate once exported
  outside the cell, which releases an additional mol of CO2 (7). This leads to an
  apparent RQ between 1 and 1.33 for pathways a–c, depending on the itaconic acid
  production yield. The apparent quotient when using CaCO3 is shown in blue letters.'
