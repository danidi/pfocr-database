caption: A mechanism used by MDV to disable the ATR-Chk1 pathway via activation of
  STAT3. MDV infection induces DNA damage, which can activate the ATR-Chk1 pathway.
  MDV replication was promoted when the ATR-Chk1 pathway was blocked using the ATR
  inhibitor VE-821. In contrast, MDV replication was suppressed by ATR-Chk1 pathway
  activation caused by the ATR activator HU. The phosphorylation of Chk1 was also
  attenuated by MDV infection through STAT3 activation. Together, these data suggest
  that MDV infection inhibits the phosphorylation of Chk1 to subsequently promote
  viral replication, the underlying mechanism of which is related to STAT3 activation.
