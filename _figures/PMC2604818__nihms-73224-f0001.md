caption: Proposed role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the regulation
  of sleep in Drosophila. (a) Rho-mediated activation of ERK signaling increases sleep
  duration. During the night, Rho activation in the pars intercerebralis (PI) leads
  to the production and secretion of an EGFR ligand. The resulting phosphorylation
  of EGFR activates ERK in the tritocerebrum (TriC). Although the final targets of
  this signaling pathway are not known, the phosphorylated ERK seems to stay in the
  processes of the TriC neurons and may well regulate electrical activity and synaptic
  transmission in these neurons. (b) During wakefulness, Rho signaling in the PI is
  proposed to be downregulated, resulting in basal levels of ERK signaling. Inhibition
  of Rho expression in PI neurons results in decreased sleep levels, with short, fragmented
  sleep bouts. This observation suggests that these mutant flies have an increased
  need for sleep but are unable to stay asleep (making them a fly model of insomnia).
