caption: 'Activation pathways of the complement system and complement regulatory proteins.
  Three pathways of activation of the complement system (the classical, alternative
  and lectin pathways), their convergence on a common pathway, and the components
  of each pathway are depicted. The effect of different complement regulatory proteins
  is shown as dashed lines.Abbreviations: MBL, mannan-binding lectin; MASP1/2, MBL-associated
  serine protease 1 and 2; C1INH, C1 inhibitor; C4bBP, C4b binding protein, DAF, decay
  accelerating factor, CR-1, complement receptor 1.'
