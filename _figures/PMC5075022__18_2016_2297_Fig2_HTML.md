caption: ERK1/2 MAPK signalling in response to different oncogenic stimuli. a In cells
  with mutation or amplification of upstream components [e.g., RTKs (1)] and expressing
  wild-type Raf proteins, negative feedback mechanisms are highly active (2,3) and
  significantly reduce the activity of several upstream pathway components. This leads
  to relatively low (but still elevated) steady-state levels of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
  activity. When either Raf or MEK1/2 are inhibited, this negative feedback is reduced.
  As a result, signal flux is increased, restoring MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity and
  requiring significantly higher inhibitor doses (intrinsic resistance). Loss of negative
  feedback (2) due to pathway inhibition also results in increased Ras-GTP levels,
  which promotes the dimerisation of wild-type Raf proteins and results in the paradoxical
  promotion, rather than inhibition, of ERK1/2 signalling. Finally, the observed transcriptional
  output (4) of tumour cells with mutated RTKs or Ras is only partially driven by
  ERK1/2 activity because of the relatively small increase in the overall signalling
  flux due to extensive negative feedback. Inhibition of Raf or MEK1/2, therefore,
  does not sufficiently reduce the expression of those mitogenic genes to result in
  therapeutic changes. b Mutant B-Raf (5) is constitutively active and, therefore,
  not sensitive to direct feedback phosphorylation by ERK1/2 (6). In addition, as
  mutated B-Raf is independent of upstream activation, negative feedback to the upstream
  components has no effect on B-Raf activity (7). Because mutated B-Raf bypasses negative
  feedback, persistent hyperactivation of MEK1/2 (and ERK1/2) results in significantly
  increased transcriptional output of mitogenic genes (8). As mitogenic gene expression
  critically depends on high signalling flux through the pathway, those tumours are
  sensitive to the inhibition of MEK1/2 or B-Raf. In addition, the increased expression
  of DUSPs (9) in B-Raf mutant cells leads to the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
  a reduction of its apparent activity to levels that support oncogenic transformation
  (rather than senescence). As a result, MEK1/2 (rather than ERK1/2) activity is a
  major hallmark and determinant of inhibitor selectivity (#)

  description: ERK1/2 MAPK signalling in response to different oncogenic stimuli.
    a In cells with mutation or amplification of upstream components [e.g., RTKs (1)]
    and expressing wild-type Raf proteins, negative feedback mechanisms are highly
    active (2,3) and significantly reduce the activity of several upstream pathway
    components. This leads to relatively low (but still elevated) steady-state levels
    of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity. When either Raf or MEK1/2 are inhibited, this negative
    feedback is reduced. As a result, signal flux is increased, restoring MEK1/2 and
    ERK1/2 activity and requiring significantly higher inhibitor doses (intrinsic
    resistance). Loss of negative feedback (2) due to pathway inhibition also results
    in increased Ras-GTP levels, which promotes the dimerisation of wild-type Raf
    proteins and results in the paradoxical promotion, rather than inhibition, of
    ERK1/2 signalling. Finally, the observed transcriptional output (4) of tumour
    cells with mutated RTKs or Ras is only partially driven by ERK1/2 activity because
    of the relatively small increase in the overall signalling flux due to extensive
    negative feedback. Inhibition of Raf or MEK1/2, therefore, does not sufficiently
    reduce the expression of those mitogenic genes to result in therapeutic changes.
    b Mutant B-Raf (5) is constitutively active and, therefore, not sensitive to direct
    feedback phosphorylation by ERK1/2 (6). In addition, as mutated B-Raf is independent
    of upstream activation, negative feedback to the upstream components has no effect

    hyperactivation of MEK1/2 (and ERK1/2) results in significantly increased transcriptional
    output of mitogenic genes (8). As mitogenic gene expression critically depends
    on high signalling flux through the pathway, those tumours are sensitive to the
