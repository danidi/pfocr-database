caption: 'Ras1 regulates mating, morphogenesis, and thermotolerance via a branched
  signaling pathway. In this work, we have investigated the contribution of Cdc42
  paralogs to morphogenesis and thermotolerance. Based on data presented here, as
  well as previously published work, we propose a pathway in which Ras1 signals through
  multiple Rho-GTPases: Cdc42, Cdc420, Rac1, and Rac2; with Cdc42 and Rac1 playing
  the major roles, and Cdc420, and possibly Rac2, playing minor roles. Rac1 primarily
  is required for hyphal morphogenesis, and may act through Ste20 and Pak1 to organize
  the actin cytoskeleton during cytokinesis. Cdc42, and to a lesser extent Cdc420,
  organize the septins during cytokinesis, and play a role in actin organization during
  growth under stress conditions. We additionally propose the existence of multiple
  as yet uncharacterized GEFs, which may provide specificity to Ras1 Rho-GTPase-mediated
  signaling.'
