caption: 'In order for the TCA cycle to function properly, it must be supplied with
  intermediate metabolites to ensure continuation of its reactions, a process known
  as anaplerosis. Both, excess of oxaloacetate and acetyl-coA are required for the
  TCA cycle to continue. Glycolysis can fulfill this requirement by supplying TCA
  with oxaloacetate and acetyl-coA derived from pyruvate. Moreover, acetyl-coA derived
  from FAO and ketogenic amino acids can supply the TCA cycle in parallel with pyruvate
  coming from glycolysis or α-ketoglutarate derived from glutamine. Glycolysis and
  TCA cycle generate ATP and biosynthetic intermediates. Glucose is necessary not
  only for glycolysis, but also for the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates
  intermediates for nucleic acid synthesis and glycolysis and also NADPH. NADPH is
  a critical co-factor for anabolic reactions such as FA synthesis and also for antioxidant
  enzymes such as glutathione reductase, and thus important for the maintenance of
  cellular redox homeostasis. Naïve, resting, Tm and Treg T cells (panel A) depend
  mainly on OXPHOS, FAO and on either glucose or glutamine to support anaplerosis
  of the TCA cycle. Tm cells have high spare respiratory capacity and thus are immediately
  ready for maximal activation upon antigen encounter. In contrast, Teff cells Th1,
  Th2 and Th17 cells (panel B) depend on high rate of glycolysis and to a lower degree
  on OXPHOS for maximum energy production and biosynthesis. TG: triglycerides, FAs:
  fatty acids, FAO: fatty acid oxidation, FAS: fatty acid synthesis, A-CoA: acetyl-coenzyme
  A, TCA cycle: tricarboxylic acid cycle, PPP: pentose phosphate pathway, OXPHOS:
  oxidative phosphorylation.'
