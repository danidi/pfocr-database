caption: 'Regulation of the estrogen signaling pathway inside the nucleus. The figure
  displays gene expression of cofactors that modulate the ER + estrogen complex inside
  the nucleus. The first bar, from left to right, represents the fluorescent expression
  of a particular gene in MSEn, and the second bar in the graph represents PCOScc.
  Genes represented in red are up-regulated, and genes represented in green are down-regulated
  in PCOScc relative to MSEn. These values were obtained from the microarray analysis
  and exported to IPA. Note that each gene represented in the MSEn has the opposite
  expression in the PCOScc. The genes represented with a graph bar are those that
  reached a P < 0.05. Among the coactivators are: glucocorticoid receptor-interacting
  protein 1 (GRIP1); cAMP-response element binding protein (CBP/p300); thyroid hormone
  receptor-associated protein complex component (TRAP220); peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1); nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (ACTR); SWItch/Sucrose
  NonFermentable-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin,
  subfamily a, member 4 (BRG1); E1A binding protein p300 (p300) and K (lysine) acetyltransferase
  2B (PCAF); proline glutamate and leucine rich protein 1 (PELP1); and steroid receptor
  RNA activator (SRA). Several corepressors regulate the activity of ERα either directly
  or via inhibiting a coactivator. Examples of direct inhibition include receptor-interacting
  protein (RIP140), silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT), and
  nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1 (DAX-1). Corepressors of ER that
  inhibit indirectly include SMRT/HDAC1 associated repressor protein (SHARP) and C-terminal
  binding protein 2 (CTBP2).'
