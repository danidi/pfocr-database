caption: Putative signalling model for leptin-induced human myometrial cell proliferation.
  Leptin 6.25 ng·mL−1 is able to induce human myometrial cell proliferation via activation
  of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway, in an leptin receptor (OB-R)-dependent manner.
  At 25 ng·mL−1, leptin is able to bind both the IL-6 and leptin receptors. Leptin
  25 ng·mL−1 induces the pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway, which is supposed to inhibit
  leptin receptor signalling and thus to inhibit proliferation. Leptin 50 ng·mL−1
  is able to induce the anti-proliferative NF-κB signalling pathway and the pro-proliferative
  STAT3/ERK1/2 pathway, in an IL-6 receptor-dependent manner, resulting in the proliferation
  of human myometrial cells.

    proliferation. Leptin 6.25 ng·mL−1 is able to induce human myometrial cell proliferation
    via activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway, in an leptin receptor (OB-R)-dependent
    manner. At 25 ng·mL−1, leptin is able to bind both the IL-6 and leptin receptors.
    Leptin 25 ng·mL−1 induces the pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway, which is supposed

    the pro-proliferative STAT3/ERK1/2 pathway, in an IL-6 receptor-dependent manner,
    resulting in the proliferation of human myometrial cells.
