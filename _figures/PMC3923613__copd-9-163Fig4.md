caption: 'Interrelation of proteinases and TNF. Cigarette smoking leads to TNF release
  and sequential events leading to emphysema (1). Serine proteinases released by recruited
  neutrophils activate MMP12 and inactivate its’ cognate inhibitor/s (2). MMP12 inactivates
  α1AT facilitating its own activation by serine proteinases (3). MMP12 then leads
  to extracellular processing of the interaction of TNF with its receptor (4) facilitating
  the main pathway (1).Abbreviations: α1 AT, alpha 1-antitrypsin; CT, computed tomography;
  MMP12, matrix metallopeptidase 12; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase;
  TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α.'
