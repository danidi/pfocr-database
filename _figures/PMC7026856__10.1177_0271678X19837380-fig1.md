caption: Schematic of [U-13C6]-glucose metabolism in the brain. Simplified schematic
  of 13C-labelling patterns following the metabolism of [U-13C6]-glucose via glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the TCA cycle. Empty circles represent 12C and
  black-filled circles represent 13C. Grey coloured intermediates represent the metabolites
  that were not measured in this study. Glucose (GLC), glucose 1-phosphate (G1P);
  glucose 6-phosphate (G6P); fructose 6-phosphate (F6P); fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
  (F16BP); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P); dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP); 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate
  (13BPG); 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG); 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG); phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP); pyruvate (PYR); Acetyl CoA (Ac-CoA); citrate (CIT); aconitate (ACO); 2-oxoglutarate
  (2OG); succinate (SUC); fumarate (FUM); malate (MAL); oxaloacetate (OAA), ribulose
  5-phosphate (RL5P). Please note that G6P can be produced from glycogen and lactate
  can leave the brain.
