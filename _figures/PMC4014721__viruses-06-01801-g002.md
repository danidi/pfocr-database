caption: Functions of Hantavirus Envelope Glycoproteins during Virus Life Cycle. Once
  hantavirus particles attach to cell surface receptors by one, or both glycoproteins
  (1) they are uptaken by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (2a) or alternatively by other
  pathways that do not involve clathrin (2b). After virus particle uptake, the viral
  glycoproteins dissociate at one point from cellular receptors (3). Virus particles
  traffic down through the endocytic pathway until the low pH of endosomes, and possibly
  other cellular factors, trigger the Gc-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion process,
  releasing RNCs to the cytosol (4). After the transcription/replication of the viral
  genome and the synthesis of new viral proteins have taken place (5), the glycoproteins
  accumulate at internal membranes, where they can mediate virus assembly and budding
  (6a) and egress through the secretory pathway (7). Alternatively, new viruses may
  assemble and bud directly from the plasma membrane (6b). E.E. indicates early endosome,
  L.E. indicates late endosome.
