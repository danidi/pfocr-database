caption: New targeted therapies in advanced primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell
  lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin is a drug composed of a chimeric anti-CD30 antibody
  linked to four monomethyl auristatin (MMAE) molecules (on average) (1). This antibody-drug
  conjugate first binds to CD30 on the surface of pcALCL cells (2). It is then internalized
  by a receptor-mediated endocytosis process (3 and 4). The resultant vesicle fuses
  with lysosomes (4), leading to proteolytic cleavage of the dipeptide linker and
  the presence of free MMAE molecules, which inhibit tubulin polymerization of the
  cellular cytoskeleton and arrest growth of pcALCL tumor cells. Gamma-secretase (γ-secretase)
  inhibitors prevent release of intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1) from membrane-tethered
  heterodimeric NOTCH1 protein. This causes the downregulation of the tumor cell nuclear
  factor-kB (NFKB) pathway and the inactivation of survival genes. JAK1/2/3 inhibitors
  are effective in vitro for controlling pcALCL cell growth. This mechanism involves
  oncogenic JAK1 or STAT3 mutations associated with the hyperactive pSTAT3 shown in
  pcALCL with an NPM1-TYK2 gene fusion and oncogenic STAT3 activation. In addition,
  anti-ALK molecules such as crizotinib, alectinib, and ceritinib in pcALCL patients
  with ALK rearrangements could downregulate the STAT3 pathway, ultimately inducing
  tumor-cell death. IPH4102 is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the
  cellular receptor KIR3DL2 (CD158K). This receptor has been shown to be aberrantly
  expressed in advanced pcALCL. IPH4140 targets KIR3DL2 in tumor cells and promotes
  cell lysis after linking to the CD16 activating receptor through antibody-dependent,
  cell-derived cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells. At the epigenetic level, histone
  deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and demethylating agents have demonstrated a degree
  of effectiveness at inducing cell-cycle arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis
  of tumor cells.
