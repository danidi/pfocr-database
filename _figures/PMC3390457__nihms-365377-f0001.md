caption: Neuroprotective signaling pathways employed by Erythropoietin. During a hypoxic
  event, HIF-1a stabilization is promoted, which in turn activates hypoxia-sensitive
  genes (including EPO) inducing transcription of endogenous EPO. Endogenous and exogenous
  EPO are capable of binding the extracellular EPO receptor (EPOR), causing its homodimerization.
  Once EPO has coupled with EPOR, JAK2 is phosphorylated leading to several downstream
  signaling pathways including Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein
  kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and the transcription factor signal transducers and activators
  of transcription-5 (STAT-5). PI3-K activation leads to AKT phosphorylation which
  may inhibit GSK3 and subsequent caspase formation. Moreover, AKT inhibits p53 activity
  through mdm2 activation (p53 acts as pro-apoptotic by stimulating cytochrome c release
  from mitochondria via Bad/Bax) leading to a diminished cytochrome c release through
  inhibition of Bad/Bax functioning. Additionally, EPO has been shown to enhance the
  antioxidant defense mechanisms, which are possible after unbounding of NFk-B from
  its inactive complex, which in turn induces transcription of p53, x-lynked (xIAP)
  and cellular (cIAP) inhibitors of apoptosis, superoxide dismutase and anti-apoptotic
  genes (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL). Nuclear transcription of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is also possible
  via the STAT-5 pathway induced by JAK2 phosphorylation. Binding of EPO to its receptor
  (EPOR) on the endothelial cells leads to phosphorylation of JAK2, which activates
  PI3-K/AKT pathway, causing endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase phosphorylation;
  then increasing NO production resulting in cerebral vasodilation. Finally, EPO also
  induces Ras-Raf pathway, activating MAPK leading to phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 inducing
  the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes.
