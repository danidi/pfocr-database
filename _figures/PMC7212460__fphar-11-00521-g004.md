caption: ERK/MAPK signaling pathway is involved in both cell growth and death, based
  on the cell condition. (A) The presence of growth factors activates the ERK1/2 pathway,
  promoting cell proliferation and survival. (B) Under oxidative stress, ER stress,
  and in the presence of cytokines, MAPK subgroups such as p38 and JNK, are activated,
  leading to apoptosis and inflammatory responses.
