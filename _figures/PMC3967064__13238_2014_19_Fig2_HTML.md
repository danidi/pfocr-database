caption: 'The model of Axin autoinhibition. Based on the findings of Kim et al. and
  us, we proposed a possible model for Axin “autoinhibiton”: without Wnt stimulation,
  the N-terminus of Axin interacts with its C-terminus, forming “type I” closed conformation,
  which blocks its binding with LRP5/6 but spares the binding site for β-catenin;
  upon Wnt stimulation, this type I auto-inhibited state of Axin is released for binding
  to LRP5/6 and the latter was subsequently phosphorylated, which inhibits the activity
  of GSK3 and thus moves Axin towards to the dephosphorylated state conferred by PP1.
  Dephosphorylated Axin forms a “type II” closed conformation through an intramolecular
  interaction between the C-terminus and the β-catenin binding region, making it unable
  to bind both of LRP5/6 and β-catenin'
