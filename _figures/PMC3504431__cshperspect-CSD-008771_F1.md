caption: The mTOR pathway. The mTOR kinase exists in two distinct complexes called
  mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. In addition to mTOR, both complexes also contain
  mLST8 and DEPTOR. RAPTOR and PRAS40 are unique to mTORC1, whereas RICTOR, mSIN1,
  and PROTOR are specific to mTORC2. mTORC1 is well known to control cell growth.
  Although the downstream mechanisms by which mTORC1 controls growth are still being
  elucidated, several direct mTORC1 substrates have now been validated. For example,
  mTORC1 can regulate growth by directly phosphorylating S6K1 and 4EBP1, two regulators
  of protein translation; by regulating autophagy through the direct phosphorylation
  of ULK1; by regulating lipid metabolism at least in part by phosphorylating Lipin1;
  and by modulating insulin signaling through Grb10. In cells, mTORC1 activity is
  controlled by nutrient availability, particularly that of amino acids, through a
  novel pathway requiring the Rag GTPases. In the presence of amino acids, the Rags
  deliver mTORC1 to the lysosome, which is thought to be the signaling center for
  mTORC1-driven growth control (not shown but described in text). Growth factor signaling
  through PI3K–AKT, as well as numerous stresses, such as energy deprivation and hypoxia,
  can also impinge on mTORC1 activity through the TSC1–TSC2 complex. TSC2 negatively
  regulates a small GTPase called Rheb that directly activates mTORC1 by an unknown
  biochemical mechanism. AKT can also activate mTORC1 by directly phosphorylating
  PRAS40, which relieves an inhibitory function of this subunit. mTORC2 was discovered
  more recently, and although it is known to be activated in response to growth factors,
  the mechanisms are unknown. The best described substrates of mTORC2 are AKT and
  SGK, which require mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation for full biochemical activity.
  PKC is also regulated by mTORC2.
