caption: Summary of CD83 pathway regulating display of MHC II and CD86 on DCs. CD83
  mRNA is induced by TLR signaling, whereas MARCH1 mRNA is induced by IL-10 and diminished
  by TLR signaling. The CD83 TM binds to MARCH1, decreasing MARCH1 association with
  the TM segments of MHC II or CD86 and preventing ubiquitination of lysines in their
  cytoplasmic tails by the MARCH1 RING-CH domain, thereby promoting MHC II or CD86
  surface display.
