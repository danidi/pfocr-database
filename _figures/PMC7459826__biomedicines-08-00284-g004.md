caption: Diagrammatic presentation of Parkinson’s disease, cause, and role of phytochemicals
  to reverse the sign of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and uncontrolled
  cell death leads to the accumulation of Lewy bodies and resultant neuronal damage.
  Phytochemicals function with multiple targets. Curcumin targets the inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS) and regulates the ratio of BCL-2/BAX which leads to the restoration
  of mitochondrial function. Genistin increases the activity of SOD, Catalase, and
  GSH and protect the neurons from damage ignited by oxidative stress. Resveratrol
  inhibits the formation of Lewy body (aggregation of α-syn protein-a major cause
  of PD). Rutin protects the neuron by leading the anti-inflammatory pathway and EGCG
  inhibits the transcriptional factor NFκB and restores the normal function of mitochondria.
  EGCG also plays a role to inhibit DNA fragmentation. All over the activities of
  phytochemicals escape neurons from damage.
