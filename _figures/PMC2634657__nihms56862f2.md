caption: 'The leptin receptor shares several signaling cascades with other receptors
  found in the brain. Here the pathways are shown along with known and possible sites
  of crosstalk between them. Both the leptin and erythropoietin (EPO) receptors become
  functional dimers upon ligand binding, allowing their associated JAK proteins to
  undergo activation and autophosphorylation (P). Insulin receptors form a larger
  heterotetramer of α and β subunits, which undergoes insulin-induced autophosphorylation.
  For leptin, the second messenger kinase JAK2 contributes to several different cascades.
  One of its major actions is to phosphorylate the three tyrosine residues on the
  ObRb intracytoplasmic loop. The Y1138 residue will recruit STAT3 monomers, aiding
  in STAT3 activation by increasing the rate of phosphorylation and dimerization by
  JAK2. The phosphorylation of Y985 instead recruits SHP2 (also phosphorylated by
  JAK2), binds and activates GRB2. Activation of the SHP2/GRB2 complex will then activate
  the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, a pathway shared by all three receptor cascades shown
  above. One interesting consequence of activation of this particular pathway that
  we have demonstrated includes the leptin/ERK-dependent stimulation of BDNF production,
  which occurs via phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB. JAK2 also directly
  activates two molecules, STAT3 and (to a smaller degree) GRB2 by phosphorylation
  and association with SHP2. STAT3 dimerization allows it to translocate to the nucleus
  and affect the transcription of a number of factors that mediate neuronal activity,
  survival and a negative feedback loop on JAK2 activity via socs3. Leptin also has
  a significant and more direct crosstalk with the insulin receptor via JAK2 mediated
  activation of IRS1,2 and Y1077 interaction with IRS4. Insulin receptor signaling
  depends on these molecules to activate effector cascades, including MEK/ERK via
  GRB2 and PI3-K. Subsequent signaling by these cascades induce the prosurvival factor
  AKT/PKB and, further downstream, the inhibition of GSK-3β and transcriptional control
  via FOXO1, which is involved in modulation of gluconeogenic responses. Erythropoietin-mediated
  activation of JAK2 activates both the MEK/ERK pathways shared by leptin and insulin,
  and activates STAT5 to alter transcription. There is some evidence from cell lines
  (see text) that insulin can activate STAT5 in addition to STAT3. Although not shown
  to occur in bona fide neurons, the ability of JAK2 to signal via other common substrates
  might represent another avenue of crosstalk between leptin, erythropoietin and other
  neurotrophic factors.Abbreviations and terms used: Akt/PKB: AKT kinase/protein kinase
