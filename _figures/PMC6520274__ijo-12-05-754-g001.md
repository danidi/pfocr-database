caption: 'A: Dietary folic acid (Vitamin B9) enters the folate cycle after its conversion
  first to dihydrofolate (DHF) and then to tetrahydrofolate (THF). The 5,10-methyltetrahydrofolate
  reductase, MTHFR is a key enzyme that converts 5,10-methylene-THF to 5-methyl-THF.
  B: Cobalamin (a cofactor form of vitamin B12), together with folate (B9) is required
  for the conversion of Hcy to methionine by methionine synthase (MS), and is responsible
  for the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine (Hcy). B12 is essential for
  the transmethylation cycle. C: Dietary methionine is converted to Hcy through S-adenosyl
  methionine (SAM) and S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and then back to methionine.
  Hcy also bifurcates to the transsulfuration pathway where it is converted to cysteine
  in presence of rate-limiting enzymes cystathionine-β synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ
  lyase (CSE). Cysteine generated through transsulfuration pathway is further converted
  to glutathione. Methionine and Hcy are written in bold while pathways are underlined.'
