caption: Hypothetical model of epithelial cancer cell invasiveness and sensitivity
  mediated by K8/18 loss. K8/18 knockdown in epithelial cancer cells promotes collective
  migration and sensitivity to apoptosis in a different way than epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition. A, at the leading edge of the migrating sheets, K8/18 loss improves
  PI3K/Akt/NF-κB/MMP activation through an increase of claudin1 in specific regions
  of the plasma membrane and in the cytosol/nucleus, thus promoting the direction
  of the movement and local matrix degradation. In the following cell rows, K8/18
  loss promotes cohesion between neighboring cells by increasing claudin1 at the plasma
  membrane. B, localized accumulation of claudin1 at the plasma membrane generates
  specific membrane regions suitable for PI3K/Akt activation, which leads to an increase
  of NF-κB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. NF-κB induces MMP2
  and MMP9 expression as well as claudin1 expression, revealing a positive feedback
  process. K8/18 loss also increases FasR membrane targeting in a claudin1-dependent
  manner, thus enhancing cisplatin-induced apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway. ECM,
  extracellular matrix; IKK, IκB kinase; pAkt, phospho-Akt; pIκBa, phospho-IκBa.
