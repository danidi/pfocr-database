caption: The mechanism depicted is based on work with the mouse mammary gland as an
  experimental model. RANKL is a direct target of PR induced by progesterone (P4)
  and is then released to interact with the RANK receptor on either PR+ or nearby
  PR− cells. In PR− cells, RANKL activates the downstream IKK/IkB/NFkB/cyclin D1 signaling
  pathway to stimulate proliferation. RANKL does not generate a sustained activation
  of the NFkB/cyclin D1 proliferative pathway in PR+ cells due to the suppressive
  actions of TGFβ and/or other unknown mechanisms.
