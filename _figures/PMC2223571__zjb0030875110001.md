caption: Reactions catalyzed by the TrpE, TrpD, and TrpC enzymes in the tryptophan
  biosynthetic pathway. (A) The heterotetrameric complex (TrpE2D2) catalyzes glutamine-dependent
  anthranilate synthesis. The second activity, PR-anthranilate synthesis, is performed
  by the phosphoribosyl transferase subunit (TrpD). Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate;
  Pyr, pyruvate. (B) Reactions catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme TrpC. The carboxy-terminal
  domain catalyzes the isomerization of PR-anthranilate to CdRP. The amino-terminal
  domain catalyzes the decarboxylation of CdRP to indole-3-glycerol-phosphate. PR-Ant,
  PR-anthranilate; InGP, indole-3-glycerol-phosphate.
