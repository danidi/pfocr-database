caption: The HCV life cycle steps targeted by proteomic approaches are presented.
  Following virus entry, viral RNA is released into the host cytosol and translated
  as a large polyprotein (polyprotein translation). Non-structural proteins processing
  (polyprotein processing) then allow the formation of viral replication complexes
  (membranous web) and production of new viral RNA copies (viral replication). Viral
  particles are then assembled into ER-derived membranes through tight interactions
  with lipid metabolism (viral assembly) before viral particle maturation and particle
  budding (virus production maturation and egress) out of the cells via the secretory
  pathway. Red arrows link the different HCV life cycle steps (red rectangles or squares)
  to the proteomic tools (written in red) used to decipher these steps. RNA translation
  and viral assembly steps are enlarged. The fundamental purpose for using proteomic
  approaches for each step of the HCV life cycle is mentioned in italic. In addition,
  proteomic approaches used to decrypt virus association with lipoproteins, as well
  as to characterize virus cross-talks with host innate immune responses are also
  presented. MS, Mass spectrometry; MALDI/TOF, Matrix-assisted laser desorption /ionization
  time of flight mass spectrometry; SILAC, Stable isotope labeling by amino acids
  in cell culture; Co-Ip, Co-immunoprecipitation; 1/2DE, 1 or 2 dimensional electrophoresis;
  ABPP, Activity-based protein profiling; LC, Liquid chromatography.
