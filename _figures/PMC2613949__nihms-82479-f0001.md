caption: Modified from Ref.  and our unpublished results. The germline and soma meiotic
  maturation control network is depicted in two states, according to whether the MSP
  signal is absent (left) or present (right). DAB-1 and VAV-1 function in the VAB-1
  MSP/Eph receptor pathway in the germ line. Gαo/i negatively regulates meiotic maturation
  and oocyte MAPK activation and antagonizes a Gαspathway that promotes maturation.
  The Gαspathway is drawn showing the involvement of the regulatory subunit (KIN-2)
  of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and adenylate cyclase-4 (ACY-4).
  Unidentified sheath cell G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are proposed to receive
  the MSP signal in parallel to VAB-1 on the oocyte, such that GPCR's coupled to Gαo/i
  are antagonized by MSP, whereas Gαs-coupled receptors are stimulated by MSP. The
  Gαspathway is proposed to antagonize inhibitory sheath/oocyte gap junctions [, ].
  The CEH-18 POU-homeoprotein localizes to sheath cell nuclei where it functions in
  the control of sheath cell differentiation and function, in part, by directly or
  indirectly affecting the assembly of sheath/oocyte gap junctions.
