caption: Mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The activation of the NLRP3
  inflammasome requires two signals. (1) TLR4 stimulation increases the production
  of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. (2) K+ efflux,
  cathepsin release by ruptured lysosomes and ROS generation provide a second signal
  that may activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and produce activated caspase-1, leading
  to the maturation of IL-1β. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is potentially
  negatively regulated by small molecules, such as COPs and POPs, cells and cytokines,
  autophagy, NO, and CO. Finally, IL-1β induces beta-cell dysfunction and death, which
  will ultimately lead to the development of T1DM.
