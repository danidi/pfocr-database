caption: MYC coordinates multiple metabolic events to activate nucleotide metabolism.
  MYC activates ODC, SMS, and SRM to promote polyamine biosynthesis. MYC drives nucleotide
  biosynthesis (1) by facilitating generation of PRPP, which offers skeleton for de
  novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis; (2) by facilitating generation of serine
  and glycine, which offers one-carbon unit for folate cycle; and (3) by directly
  inducing enzymes involved in de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Enzymes labeled in
  red are upregulated by MYC. ARG1 arginase 1, AMP adenosine monophosphate, CAD carbamoyl-phosphate

  description: MYC coordinates multiple metabolic events to activate nucleotide metabolism.
    MYC activates ODC, SMS, and SRM to promote polyamine biosynthesis. MYC drives
    nucleotide biosynthesis (1) by facilitating generation of PRPP, which offers skeleton
    for de novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis; (2) by facilitating generation
    of serine and glycine, which offers one-carbon unit for folate cycle; and (3)
    by directly inducing enzymes involved in de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Enzymes
    labeled in red are upregulated by MYC. ARG1 arginase 1, AMP adenosine monophosphate,
