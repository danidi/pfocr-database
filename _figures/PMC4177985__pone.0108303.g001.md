caption: (A) Chemical structure of L-aminopterin (top) and D-aminopterin (bottom).
  (B) The anti-inflammatory activity of L-aminopterin and methotrexate have been attributed
  to inhibition of thymidylate (red) and purine (green) de novo biosynthesis. In the
  de novo pathway of thymidylate (dTMP) synthesis, serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) catalyzes the conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate polyglutamates (THF)
  to 5,10-CH2-THF and glycine. Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) converts 5,10-CH2-THF and
  deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to dihydrofolate polyglutamates (DHF) and dTMP.
  Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) completes the cycle by catalyzing the conversion
  of DHF to THF in an NADPH-dependent reaction. The purine, inosine monophosphate
  (IMP), is synthesized de novo in 10 chemical steps (shown numbered) catalyzed by
  six enzymes. The six enzymes are phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT;
  1); a trifunctional enzyme composed of glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase (GARS;
  2), GAR formyltransferase (GART; 3) and aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase
  (AIRS; 5); formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase (FGAMS; 4); a bifunctional
  enzyme composed of carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthase (CAIRS; 6) and
  succinoaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide synthetase (SAICARS; 7); adenylosuccinate
  lyase (ASL; 8); and a bifunctional enzyme composed of aminoimidazolecarboxamide
  ribonucleotide transformylase (AICART; 9) and inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase
  (IMPCH; 10). Evidence indicates that 10-formyl-7,8-dihydrofolate (10-CHO-DHF) is
  the predominant in vivo substrate for AICART, making AICART and TYMS the only enzymes
  to produce the DHFR substrate DHF . Inside the cell, L-aminopterin and methotrexate
  and their polyglutamate metabolites (antifol) bind with high affinity to DHFR, resulting
  in accumulation of DHF and depletion of the reduced folate pool. Depletion of folates,
  as well as the direct inhibition by antifol and DHF, have all been implicated in
  the inhibition of PPAT, GART, AICART and TYMS , , , . In the case of AICART, the
  accumulation of DHF may cause this reaction to run backwards, since AICAR is normally
  driven towards the biosynthesis of FAICAR and IMP by the DHFR-catalyzed reduction
  of DHF to THF, as the equilibrium of this step actually lies in the direction of
  AICAR formation .
