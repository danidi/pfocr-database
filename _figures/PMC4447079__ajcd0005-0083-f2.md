caption: Illustration of protein modification by the ubiquitin proteasome system.
  Ubiquitin is activated, transferred and conjugated to a target protein by the action
  of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. This process is balanced by the action of de-conjugating
  enzymes. Modified proteins can undergo degradation, either via the endosome/multi-vesicular-body
  (MVB)/lysosome pathway or via the 26S proteasome with and without adaptor proteins.
  Alternatively, they can undergo functional activation (e.g. IκB kinase (IKK) via
  ubiquitination of its regulatory subunit NEMO or associates) or translocation (e.g.
  polyubiquitination of p53). Proteins, modified by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers
  such as NEDD8 or FAT10, are escorted to and recognized by the 26S proteasome by
  ubiquitin-domain proteins. Besides this recognition and substrate binding, the 19S
  complex facilitates deubiquitination and unfolding of the target protein by virtue
  of its ATPase activity as well as opening of the proteolytic tunnel of the 20S proteasome,
  which is composed of two flanking alpha and two central beta rings. The poly-amino
  acid-fragments of the target proteins are subsequently degraded further by proteases.
