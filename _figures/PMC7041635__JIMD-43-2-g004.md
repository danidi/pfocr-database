caption: Simplified scheme of the pathways for conversion of B6 vitamers in the diet
  (or given as treatment, circled) to the active cofactor, pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate
  (PLP) and for recycling to salvage PLP. Pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase (PNPO)
  is required for conversion of pyridoxine (in the diet or given as a medicine) to
  PLP and for the salvage pathway but conversion of PLP given orally to PLP in body
  cells does not require PNPO
