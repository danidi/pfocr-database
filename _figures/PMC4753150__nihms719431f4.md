caption: RNA was extracted from skin wounds and in epiVDRKO and littermate control
  mice 3 days post wounding. The RNA was evaluated by Illumina microarray (Mouse Ref
  8 v 2.0), and fold changes were calculated. Pathway analysis by Ingenuity IPA software
  demonstrated that the β-catenin signaling pathway is decreased in epiVDRKO wounds
  as indicated by the genes in green. The TCF/β-catenin transcriptional complex is
  shown by the white double circle in the center. The β-catenin target genes are aligned
  under the complex. They are categorized by their function such as cell cycle or
  stem cell fate. The arrows denote the regulation through β-catenin signaling found
  in the IPA database. The crosses symbolize DNA. The potential location of VDR to
  regulate β-catenin signaling is added. Green represents down regulation, red represents
  up regulation, and the intensity of the hue indicates the degree of change.
