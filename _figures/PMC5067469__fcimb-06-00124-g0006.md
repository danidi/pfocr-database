caption: The signaling pathways of pathogen protective mechanisms based on HPCNs in
  Figure  in Mϕs and DCs during Mtb infection. (A) The proteins Rv0667, Rv1696, Rv2404c,
  Rv0762c, Rv1438, and Rv1098c are expressed on the cell membrane of Mtb, and Rv0667
  and Rv1438 are essential for the survival of Mtb. These proteins may counteract
  the defensive mechanisms of both cell types through interactions with EGFR and UBC.
  Therefore, these proteins with higher expression and more specific edges in Mϕs
  than DCs could cause the dysfunction of cell growth and DNA repair in Mϕs. Some
  of these proteins have differential basal levels, whereas only Rv1438 has been found
  to undergo acetylation, which could facilitate its interaction with host proteins.
  (B) The metal-dependent homeostasis signaling pathway plays an important protective
  role to counteract the defense mechanisms of host cells. However, the metal-dependent
  homeostasis signaling pathway of Mtb varies between Mϕs and DCs. Mtb evolves this
  pathway to counteract the metal burst from host cells and induce metal homeostasis
  in Mϕs and DCs during infection. The function of Rv0970 is still unknown, whereas
  rv0970 is regulated by different transcription factors (TFs) of Mtb in Mϕs and DCs,
  and interacts with Rv0967 and Rv0969 after translation, a member of the metal-dependent
  homeostasis signaling pathway. Rv1675c regulates itself and interacts with metal-dependent
  proteins or TFs in Mϕs. Furthermore, Rv1675c is highly expressed and demonstrates
  specific edges in Mϕs, which plays an important role in the metal-dependent homeostasis
  signaling pathway in Mϕs. The inhibition of mir-636 on rv0353 in Mϕs could decrease
  antibody production.
