caption: 'Comparison of fluxes of central carbon metabolism determined by MFA and
  predicted from a genome-scale metabolic model. The metabolic diagram shows the reactions
  of glycolysis, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and the TCA cycle. Each
  reaction is numbered, cross-referencing , and each bar graph showing flux values
  (in mmol d−1 L−1 cell culture) is labeled with the corresponding reaction number.
  Metabolites are as follows: G6P, Glc 6-P; F6P, Fru 6-P; GL6P, gluconate 6-phosphate;
  PenP, pentose phosphate; F-1,6-BP, Fru 1,6-bisP; 3-PGA, 3 phosphoglyceric acid;
  2-PGA, 2 phosphoglyceric acid. Enzymes are as follows: (1) G6P DH, Glc 6-P dehydrogenase;
  (2) PGDL, 6-phosphogluconolactonase; (3) PGDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase;
  (4) PFK, phosphofructokinase; (5) TK1, transketolase 1; (6) TK2, transketolase 2;
  (7) TA, transaldolase; (8) ALD, aldolase; (9) TIM, triosphosphate isomerase; (10)
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; (11) PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase;
  (12) PGM, phosphoglyceromutase; (13) enolase; (14) PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase;
  (15) PK, pyruvate kinase; (16) ME (NADP), NADP-dependent malic enzyme; (17) PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; (18) CS, citrate synthase; (19) MDH, malate dehydrogenase;
