caption: 'Signaling pathways of the UPR in response to ER-stress. The UPR is regulated
  through signaling cascades from three sensor proteins: IRE1, ATF6 and PERK. During
  non-stressed conditions, BiP (red pie) is bound to the three sensors to maintain
  their inactive state. When misfolded proteins accumulate in the lumen of the ER,
  BiP dissociates from the sensors and binds to unfolded and misfolded proteins. This
  results in activation of the IRE1, ATF6 and PERK signaling cascades. Dissociation
  of BiP from IRE1 results in its dimerization which activates its kinase and RNAse
  activities to promote splicing of Xbp1 mRNA resulting in a frame shift of the Xbp1
  gene. Translation of spliced Xbp1 produces an active transcription factor which
  subsequently induces the translation of ER chaperones and genes involved in ER-associated
  protein degradation (ERAD). ATF6 is a basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) containing transcription
  factor. During ER-stress, BiP dissociates and ATF6 is translocated to the Golgi
  apparatus where it is cleaved by two proteases (serine protease site-1 protease
  (S1P) and serine protease site-2 protease (S2P). The cytosolic fragment of ATF6
  migrates to the nucleus and activates transcription of UPR-responsive genes such
  as chaperones and CHOP, through promoter binding at their ER-stress response element
  binding sites. PERK is a serine/threonine protein kinase activated by ER-stress
  through dimerization and autophosphorylation upon dissociation of BiP. Activated
  PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, resulting in the inhibition of global translation. However,
  ATF4 is translated because it contains multiple 5’ open reading frames. ATF4 induces
  CHOP (a proapoptotic transcription factor) which activates the apoptosis pathway.'
