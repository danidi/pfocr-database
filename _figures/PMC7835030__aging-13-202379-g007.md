caption: 'NLRC4 gene regulates inflammatory reaction and immune response of DCs in
  septic shock by mediating the NLR pathway. NLRC4 is the receptor of the NLR pathway.
  Activated NF-κB pathway induces inflammatory reaction with secretion of inflammatory
  factors: IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 outside cells, as well as increases in CD80, CD86
  and MHC II on the cytomembrane, thus activating DC immune response. Importantly,
  siRNA-mediated silencing of NLRC4 blocks the NLR signaling pathway to inhibit DC
  maturation and immune response, which alleviates the lung tissue injury of mice
  induced by septic shock.'
