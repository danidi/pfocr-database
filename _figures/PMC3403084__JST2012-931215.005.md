caption: Necrosis signaling pathways. (a) Necrosis is induced downstream of death
  domain-containing receptors, including TNF receptors 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2. When TNFα
  binds to TNFR1, RIP1 is recruited to the activated TNFR1. In this receptor-associated
  complex, E3 ligase cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) mediate the
  Lys63-linked polyubiquitin of RIP1, activating the NF-κB pathway. Conversely, when
  the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin is removed by deubiquitinating enzymes, including
  CYLD, RIP1 functions as a cell death inducer rather than as a survival-promoting
  factor. When caspase 8 activity is blocked by inhibitors, such as a pan-caspase
  inhibitor or Z-VAD-fmk, or by the genetic ablation of caspase 8 itself, RIP1 interacts
  with RIP3 and forms a necrosis-inducing complex. RIP1 and RIP3 become phosphorylated
  and activated in this complex. Although the kinase activity of RIP1 is not required
  to activate the NF-κB pathway, its kinase activity is essential for necrosis induction.
  (b) The mitochondrial Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PGAM5 is a substrate of RIP3.
  The RIP3-mediated phosphorylation of PGAM5 enhances its protein phosphatase activity.
  Once activated by phosphorylation, PGAM5 dephosphorylates and activates the mitochondrial
  fission regulator Drp1, promoting mitochondrial fission and subsequent necrosis.
  PGAM5 has two splice variants in humans, PGAM5L and PGAM5S, each of which appears
  to have different functions in necrosis (see text for details).
