caption: Schematic overview of the PAI-1 (I) conformations as well as its interactions
  with plasminogen activators (PAs, E) and cofactor vitronectin. Following the formation
  of a non-covalent PAI-1/PA Michaelis complex (EI), the P1-P1′ bond is cleaved to
  generate an acyl-enzyme intermediate (E~I). From here on, the reaction proceeds
  through a branched pathway, resulting in either the formation of an irreversible
  inhibitory complex (E-I) or the generation of cleaved PAI-1 (I*) due to the hydrolysis
  of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. PAI-1 is shown in white; the central β-sheet A
  of the PAI-1 molecule in blue; the flexible reactive center loop (RCL) in red, and
  Arg346 and Met347 (P1-P1′) of the reactive center are indicated by magenta and cyan
  spheres, respectively. The PA is shown in green. Vitronectin is shown in orange.
  PDB structures 1DVN (), 1DB2 (), 5BRR (), 3EOX (), 1EZX (), 1H4W (), and 1OC0 ()
  were used to generate this figure. Figure adapted from Sillen et al. ().
