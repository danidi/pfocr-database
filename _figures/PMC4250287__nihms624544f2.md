caption: Signal transduction pathways integrate activity of multiple cytokines. For
  example, despite opposing effects on the modulation of memory, IL-6 and IL-10 converge
  on the JAK/STAT3 pathway. STAT3 mediates transcription of SOCS3 which forms an inhibitory
  feedback pathway, blocking JAK/STAT3 signaling specifically at the IL-6 receptor
  complex. Thus high STAT3 activity with low SOCS3 suggests preferential IL-6 mediated
  outcomes, whereas STAT3 and high SOCS3 activity suggests IL-10 dominated signaling.
  Patterns of intracellular signaling cascades during inflammation therefore provide
  complementary information about the role of networked cytokine activation on learning
  and memory.JAK Janus kinase; STAT3 Signal transduction and transcription 3; IL-6
