caption: The effects of resveratrol on a simplified signaling pathway involved in
  metabolic control in the liver. Resveratrol increases expression of insulin receptor
  substrate 1 (IRS-1). Insulin receptor substrate 1, when stimulated by insulin, activates
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which then activates AKT by phosphorylation at
  threonine 308 (phosphorylated AKT [pAKT]). Resveratrol also increases the expression
  of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which activates AKT by phosphorylation
  at serine 473. Activation of AKT enhances glycogen synthase activity by inhibiting
  its inhibitor, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Increased glycogen synthase activity
  increases glycogen production, facilitating increased movement of glucose into the
  liver from the circulation and reducing blood glucose levels. AKT activation also
  signals for forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) to be transported out of the nucleus. This prevents
  transcription of proteins needed for gluconeogenesis and thus reduces the level
  of gluconeogenesis, which diminishes the amount of glucose released from the liver,
  also reducing the blood glucose level.
