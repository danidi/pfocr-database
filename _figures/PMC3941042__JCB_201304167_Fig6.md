caption: Proposed new mechanism for regulation of PI3K–Akt–FoxO pathway by Trim32.
  By promoting plakoglobin dissociation from PI3K–p85, Trim32 reduces PI3K–Akt–FoxO
  signaling in normal and atrophying muscle and regulates growth. In addition to its
  role in myofibril breakdown during fasting (), Trim32 also functions as a novel
  inhibitor of PI3K–Akt–FoxO signaling. Because Trim32 and plakoglobin are expressed
  in most tissues (; ), they probably serve similar roles in regulating the growth
  of other cells. This novel mechanism probably contributes to the insulin resistance
  during fasting and catabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes, sepsis), and perhaps to the
  myopathies and cardiomyopathies seen with Trim32 and plakoglobin mutations.
