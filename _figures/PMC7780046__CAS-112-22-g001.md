caption: N‐myc downstream‐regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a key regulator of cellular
  stress responses. NDRG2 maintains cellular homeostasis by regulating multiple biological
  processes in response to genotoxic stress that involves p53, hypoxic stress mediated
  by hypoxia‐inducible factor 1‐alpha (HIF‐1α), hyperthermia mediated by AKT signaling,
  inflammation mediated by the NF‐κB signaling pathway, and anabolic stress mediated
  by estrogen‐related receptor‐alpha (ERR‐α). Under stress conditions, cells may activate
  signaling pathways such as AKT or gene transcription to promote stress‐defense responses
  including apoptosis, the immune response, inflammation, or metabolic regulation,
  and these cellular responses can be terminated by the dephosphorylation of important
  signaling molecules such as phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
  10 (PTEN), NF‐κB‐inducing kinase (NIK) or others by the NDRG2‐protein phosphatase
  2A (PP2A) complex as a negative feedback loop
