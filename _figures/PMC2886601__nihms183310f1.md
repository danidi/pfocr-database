caption: (A) Notch (blue) and Delta (red) interactions are indicated schematically.
  (B) Notch activity integrates cis- and trans-Delta. (C) CHO-K1 cell line for analyzing
  Notch activity. (C) The hN1G4esn cell line stably incorporates a variant of hNotch1
  in which the activator Gal4esn replaces Notch ICD. This cell line also contains
  genes for Histone 2B (H2B)-Citrine (YFP) reporter controlled by a UAS promoter,
  a Tet-inducible Delta-mCherry fusion protein, and a constitutively expressed H2B-Cerulean
  (CFP) for image segmentation (not shown). A similar cell line expressing full length
  hNotch1 (hN1 cell line) was also analyzed (). These cells exhibit no detectable
  endogenous Notch or Delta activities. Notch-Delta interactions are indicated schematically
  and do not represent molecular interaction mechanisms.
