caption: '(a) Venn diagram showing the number of ‘above-high parent'' and ‘below-low
  parent'' genes in each Arabidopsis thaliana hybrid at three time points. (b) Venn
  diagram showing the number of genes (selected from (a)) in each Cluster Analysis
  Group in F1 hybrids. Group I: expression continuously increased; group II: expression
  continuously decreased; group III: expression increased first and then decreased;
  and group IV: expression decreased first and then increased. (c) Enrichment of selected
  GO categories for genes selected from (b). The biological process with false discovery
  rate (adjusted P<0.05, Student''s t-test) is shown. (d) Some genes in the salicylic
  acid pathway, categorized as ‘response to bacterium'' by GO analysis, were upregulated
  in F1 hybrids.'
