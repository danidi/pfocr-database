caption: 'The autophagy–lysosomal–endosomal system and the Parkinson’s disease (PD)-related
  proteins. Lysosomes are the terminal compartment where the intracellular macromolecules
  delivered by autophagy (orange) and the extracellular macromolecules delivered by
  endocytosis (green) are degraded. Three types of autophagy are described in mammalian
  cells: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Macroautophagy
  eliminates intracellular components including proteins and organelles; these substrates
  are enclosed in a double membrane vesicle called an autophagosome (APH) that can
  be directly fused with lysosomes forming an autolysosome (AL). Alternatively, an
  APH can also first fuse with a late endosome (LE) to form an amphisome (AMPH) before
  fusing with the lysosome in order to degrade the cargo. Extracellular macromolecules
  and plasma membrane components can also be eliminated inside the lysosomes by endocytosis.
  Following the internalization, cargo is transported to early endosomes (EEs), the
  initial sorting station in the endocytic pathway; then EEs can be sorted into different
  routes, recycled back to the cell surface, enter the retrograde pathway to be sent
  to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), or maturate into multivesicular bodies (MVB) or
  late endosomes (LE), which enter the degradation pathway, and finally merge with
  the lysosome. PD-related proteins are listed alongside the pathway or organelle
  in which they are involved.'
