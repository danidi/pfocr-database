caption: 'The O-glycosylation of proteins in hematopoietic cells: Mucin-type O-glycosylation
  of proteins initiates mainly in the Golgi when polypeptide α-GalNAc-transferases
  (ppGalNAcTs) transfer GalNAc from UDP-Gal to Ser/Thr on a protein going through
  the secretory pathway to form Tn antigen (GalNAcα-Ser/Thr). Tn antigen is normally
  further modified by the T-synthase (Core 1 β3GalT) which transfers Gal from UDP-Gal
  to GalNAcα-Ser/Thr in a protein to form core 1 (T antigen) in all cell types. Cosmc
  is the specific molecular chaperone for the T-synthase. In all cell types, the T
  antigen is usually sialylated by ST3Gal-I, which transfers the N-acetylneuraminic
  acid (sialic acid) from CMP-Neu5Ac to form α3sialyl Core 1 (Neu5Acα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr),
  which can be further sialylated by ST6GalNAc-II to form di-sialyl Core 1 [Neu5Acα2,3Galβ1,3(Neu5Acα2,6)GalNAcα-Ser/Thr]
  structures. In hematopoietic cells, besides synthesis of sialyl core 1 structures,
  the T antigen is usually further modified by core 2 β6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
  (C2GnT) to form Core 2 [Galβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcα-Ser/Thr] based O-glycans. Mutations
  in Cosmc or loss of T-synthase activity results in pathological expression of Tn
  and/or STn antigens. The STn antigen (Neu5Acα2,6GalNAcα-Ser/Thr) results from the
  actions of ST6GalNAc-I, which transfers Neu5Ac from CMP-Neu5Ac to the Tn antigen.
  Because of poor efficiency of ST6GalNAc-I, it is likely that only very high expression
  of ST6GalNAc-I could outcompete functional T-synthase to result in pathologic STn
  expression in the absence of corresponding Tn expression.'
