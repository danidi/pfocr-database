caption: Proposed mechanism of the regulation of cell migration and invasion by PTHrP,
  involving activation of Rac1. PTHrP increases cell surface levels of integrin α6β4,
  which signals synergistically with growth factor receptors to activate the PI3-K
  pathway. This results in activation of the GTPase Rac1 through the Rac1-specific
  guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1. Rac1 activation in turn increases cell
  migration and invasion. PTHrP may also increase Tiam1 protein levels through upregulation
  of Tiam1 mRNA levels via a transcriptional/post-transcriptional pathway.
