caption: All hepatoblastoma cells are commonly derived from immature hepatocytes with
  aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, whereas heterogeneity among cases
  arises from the diversity of the differentiation stage of the origins. Clusters
  E1/E2 are derived from liver progenitor cells at an earlier differentiation stage
  and consequently harbor hypermethylation of HNF4A/CEBPA-binding regions that leads
  to expression profiles mimicking fetal liver, which explain the poorly differentiated
  pathology and aggressive cell proliferation. In addition, clusters E1/E2 highly
  express NQO1 due to promoter hypomethylation, which induces chemoresistance. Cluster
  F arises from hepatoblasts at a relatively mature stage, harbors genetic features
  that are opposite of those observed in clusters E1/E2, and represents good prognosis.
