caption: '17 post-translational modification sites that impact PR-mediated transcriptional
  action. PR-B, but not PR-A, includes 164 additional amino acids in the NTD (called
  B upstream segment) where the third activation function domain and multiple phosphorylation
  sites are located. PR-B and PR-A are transcribed from the same gene and their protein
  isoforms are identical from amino acids 165-993. The protein tertiary structure
  results in a folding at the hinge region between the DBD and HBD. Post-translational
  modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation) can occur basally
  or in response to ligand binding and affect PR transcriptional activity. In particular,
  activated protein kinase pathways input to PR via phosphorylation and these pathways
  are heavily altered in breast, ovarian, and uterine carcinomas. Numbering reflects
  amino acid residue positions. The color of phosphorylation sites is associated with
  the following: red = MAPK; green = CDK2; yellow = CK2; purple = unknown kinases.
  PR, progesterone receptor protein isoforms A, B, or C; NTD, N-(amino)-terminal domain;
  DBD, DNA binding domain; H, hinge region; HBD, hormone binding domain; AF, activation
  function 1-3; P, phosphorylation; A, acetylation; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier
  (SUMOylation). Dysregulation of Kinase Inputs to PR in Cancer: The percent of TCGA
  (The Cancer Genome Atlas) tumors containing alterations in MAPK, CDK2, or CK2 components
  were identified using the cBioPortal.org analysis tool. For analysis of dysregulated
  kinases: MAPK includes canonical c-Raf, Mek, and Erk signaling pathway genes: RAF1,
  MAP3K1, MAP3K2, MAPK3, MAPK1; CKD2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2; CK2, casein kinase
  2, alpha 1 polypeptide, CSNK2A1.'
