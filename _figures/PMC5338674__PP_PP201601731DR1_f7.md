caption: Model for Pol ε function in plant DDR. A, In the wild type, Pol ε catalytic
  subunit POL2A is involved in replication stress sensing; this leads to ATR-dependent
  activation of the WEE1 and SOG1 pathways, allowing the expression of genes involved
  in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and nucleotide biosynthesis, ultimately leading
  to fork stabilization and completion of DNA replication and cell survival. B, In
  pol2A mutants with point mutations affecting POL2A activity, the abnormal Pol ε
  subunit likely gums up replication, leading to constitutive replication stress and
  activating ATR. The WEE1 branch of the downstream pathway is essential to plant
  survival, whereas the SOG1 branch of the pathway is dispensable, but confers tolerance
  to replicative stress. SOG1 activation may also negatively regulate ATM signaling
  leading to enhanced sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. C, When accumulation of
  POL2A is reduced, Pol δ likely replaces it and replicates both DNA strands. In the
  absence of Pol ε, replicative stress signaling is not properly activated, which
  may lead to fork collapse and DNA lesions that can in turn activate ATM signaling
  and promote tolerance to DSB-inducing agents. In all panels, dashed arrows indicate
  putative pathways that remain to be molecularly identified.
