caption: Schematic summary of the most common mutations found in melanoma patients.
  The most common risk for melanoma is UV, and most DNA alterations are typically
  UV-induced. Family history of melanoma accounts for a two-fold risk increase, through
  mutations at the level of CDKN2A gene. These often affect the tumor suppressors
  p16INK4a or p14ARF, which have roles in the cell cycle and apoptosis, respectively.
  On the other hand, there is the RAS/RAF signaling pathway, which importance is underlined
  by the fact that exclusively NRAS or BRAF is mutated in melanoma. However, the presence
  of BRAF mutations in benign nevi suggest that BRAF per se does not suffice for the
  tumor progression. Often mutations in PTEN pathways have been found to cooperate
  with RAS/RAF to reduce RAS/RAF-mediated senescence.
