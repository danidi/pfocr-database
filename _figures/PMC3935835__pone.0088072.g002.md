caption: The  strain requires additional oxaloacetate to grow. Growth is achieved
  through direct synthesis of oxaloacetate by alternative pathways such as the glyoxylate
  shunt or pck, or through an increase of PEP levels, which drives flux through these
  pathways. The top seven mutated pathways identified by pathway phenotype sequencing
  are shown in red. It has been shown that Ppc knockouts cause increased flux through
  the glyoxylate shunt , consistent with our observed mutations in AceK and IclR.
  Mutations in PtsI have previously been observed in response to a growth-based selection
  for increased succinate production, in a scenario where Pck overexpression was also
  observed . Similarly, deletion of ptsH, which also deactivates the PTS system and
  increases the intracellular PEP pool, has also been shown to increase succinate
  yields .
