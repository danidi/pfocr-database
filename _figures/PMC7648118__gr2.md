caption: Therapeutic strategies targeting the NMJ in dystrophic muscle. Several recent
  pre-clinical studies have provided mechanistic insights into potential therapeutic
  approaches targeting the NMJ in DMD. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-MuSK administration
  improves the dystrophic phenotype by stimulating low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 4 (LRP4)/MuSK activation, thereby enhancing AChR clustering and driving
  gene expression in subsynaptic (also known as fundamental) myonuclei. In particular,
  downstream of MuSK are the transcriptional activators Ets variant 5 (Erm) and GA-binding
  protein (GABP⍺/β; also known as nuclear respiratory factor 2, or NRF-2) that bind
  to the N-box response element found in numerous synaptic genes, including Musk,
  Rapsn, Utrn, and Chrn. Similarly, mini-agrin treatment likely improves dystrophic
  NMJ biology through LRP4/MuSK activation, however this has yet to be directly demonstrated.
  Elevating neural activity, for example via a prescribed chronic exercise program,
  evokes synaptic gene expression by stimulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor ɣ coactivator-1α (PGC-1⍺)/GABP⍺/β signalling. The
  chronic induction of Utrn expression results in augmented utrophin and UAPC content
  throughout the myofiber, most notably extrasynaptically along the sarcolemma where
  it serves to functionally compensate for the lack of dystrophin. Exercise and AMPK
  also elicit autophagy-mediated AChR recycling, a complementary molecular pathway
  that beneficially remodels the dystrophic NMJ. β2 adrenergic agonists increase cAMP/protein
  kinase A (PKA) signalling and normalize AChR recycling and may correct NMJ morphology
  in dystrophic animals. Lastly, dystrophin replacement strategies, such as mini-dystrophin,
  have also been shown to improve the stability and function of the NMJ, at least
  in part via rescue of dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) expression. Solid
  lines indicate established connections between events and dashed lines refer to
  potential linkages between steps.
