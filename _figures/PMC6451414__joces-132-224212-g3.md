caption: Extracellular vesicles affect host responses during vector-borne pathogen
  infection. (A) Cerebral malaria in humans is linked to damage of the blood–brain
  barrier. These symptoms may be associated with extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion
  by P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (iRBCs). These vesicles contain the P.
  falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), host miR-451a and DNA. PfEMP1
  and miR-451a increase the permeability of the cell barrier through the downregulation
  of host gene expression. In addition, P. falciparum DNA in these vesicles activate
  immune responses in circulating monocytes through the stimulator of interferon genes
  (STING) pathway. (B) Leishmania spp., the causative agent of Leishmaniasis, secrete
  EVs during host infection. As shown in mice, these vesicles are taken up by monocytes
  and T cells, where they suppress the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  steer T cell differentiation towards Th2 responses. (C) The Chagas disease parasite
  Trypanosoma cruzi secretes EVs that exert an immunosuppressive activity in the human
  host by blocking complement formation, suppressing macrophage antigen presentation
  (MHC-II), inhibiting T cell stimulation through CD86, dampening the secretion of
  TNF and the expression of iNOS, and increasing invasion of cardiac tissue through
  the elevated levels of IL-4 and IL-10, leading to tissue damage in the heart.
