caption: A, CCK signalling through the CCK2 receptor exerts opposing effects on PV
  and CCK basket cells, as described in B and C, with the net effect on PV BCs being
  depolarization and firing, and the net effect on CCK BCs being a suppression of
  GABA release. B, in PV BCs, CCK2 receptors couple to an unusual, pertussis toxin-sensitive
  pathway utilising a Gi/o-coupled mechanism involving cyclic ADP ribose, ryanodine
  receptors on intracellular calcium stores, and ultimately activating a non-selective
  cationic conductance through TRP channels. C, in pyramidal cells, CCK2 receptors
  signal through the more canonical Gq–PLC pathway in which PLCβ produces diacylglycerol
  (DAG) which is converted by DAG lipase to endocannabinoids that can travel in a
  retrograde fashion to cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors on presynaptic CCK basket
  cell terminals, decreasing GABA release. Adapted by permission from Journal of Neuroscience;
