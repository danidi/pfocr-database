caption: The POR:FldA:FqrB pathway in H. pylori. Flavodoxin (Fld) shuttles electrons
  between pyruvate oxidoreductase complex (POR) and flavodoxin:quinone reductase (FqrB)
  in a reversible pathway which plays a central role in the bacterial metabolism,
  as it represents an essential route for CO2 fixation and pyruvate metabolism. The
  pyruvate decarboxylation pathway is represented by solid lines, whereas the pyruvate
  synthesis pathway (contributing to gluconeogenesis) is indicated by dotted lines.
