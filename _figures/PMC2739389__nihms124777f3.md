caption: 'Apoptotic cell death can be initiated through two main pathways: the death
  receptor (extrinsic) pathway and the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. The death
  receptor pathway is activated by the binding or FAS or TRAIL ligands to their receptors
  (DR4 or DR5), stimulating receptor aggregation. This aggregation stimulates recruitment
  of FADD and caspase (casp) 8 activation, which is regulated by cFLIP (also known
  as CFLAR) and growth factor signaling through the MAPK pathway. Casp 8 activation
  leads to casp 3 cleavage, which initiates multiple proapoptotic processes, including
  CAD stimulation of DNA cleavage. Through the mitochondrial pathway, prosurvival
  signaling through AKT activation stimulates phosphorylation of BAD, which allows
  BCL2 to exert its antiapoptotic effects by blocking proapoptotic proteins NOXA and
  BAX. However, dephosphorylated BAD blocks BCL2 by heterodimerization (BAD/BCL2),
  which allows proapoptotic proteins to form pores in the mitochondria. This process
  then releases apoptogenic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, including
  cytochrome C (Cyt C), APAF1, and casp 9. These factors form the so-called apoptosome,
  which stimulates apoptosis through casp 3 cleavage. Recent data have suggested that
  the proteasome regulates the activity of the proapoptotic protein, NOXA, as proteasomal
  inhibition with bortezomib induces NOXA up-regulation and apoptosis in melanoma
  cell lines. P = phosphate. For expansion of other abbreviations, see Glossary on
  page 846.'
