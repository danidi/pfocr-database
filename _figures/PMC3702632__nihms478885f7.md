caption: Model of TLR4 and chemokine receptor crosstalk. A. MCP-1 binding to CCR2
  induces monocytes migration, as well as GRK2 translocation to membrane which results
  in CCR2 internalization and desensitization (blue arrow and dotted line), thereby
  negatively regulating monocyte migration. B. LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling
  and p38 MAPK pathway induces the phosphorylation of GRK2 at Ser670 inhibits the
  translocation of GRK2 to membrane, thereby suppressing the internalization and desensitization
  of CCR2, which leads to augmented monocyte migration (red arrows and dotted lines).
  TLR4 signaling-activated ERK plays a negative regulatory role in the phosphorylation
  of GRK2 at Ser670; this role can be observed while ERK is inhibited.
