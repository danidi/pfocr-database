caption: Metabolism of folates. Folic acid cycle involves the recycling of homocysteine
  to methionine and contains the methyltetrahydrofolate receptor (MTHFR) necessary
  for the formation of 5-THF. MTHFR catalyzes the reduction of methylentetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-methylen-THF) to methyl (5-methyl THF) by donating a methyl group. MS can
  catalyze the transfer of the methyl group from 5-methyl THF to homocysteine, which
  generates methionine and THF. The cystathionine-beta synthase pathway allows the
  formation of cysteine from homocysteine, that is a precursor of glutathione and
  hypotaurine. Impaired methylation will thus lead to a number of major genetic health
  problems. DHF, Dihydrofolate reductase; THF, Tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR, Methylene
  Tetrahydrofolate Reductase; CBS, Cystathionine-beta synthase; Cystathionine lyase.
