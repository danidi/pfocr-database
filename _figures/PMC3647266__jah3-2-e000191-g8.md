caption: Protein quality control and autophagy–lysosomal systems (ALS). Myocyte proteins
  are normally turned over by the activities of the ALS and the ubiquitin–proteasome
  system (UPS). In CTSL‐deficient myocyte, an accelerated response to pathological
  stress represents a basis for pathogenic protein accumulations, resulting in exacerbated
  cardiac hypertrophy, cell dysfunction, and death. This was associated with the defective
  lysosomal function, leading to an impairment of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway,
  and ultimately resulting in impaired protein degradation and intracellular homeostatic
  remodeling. CTSL indicates cathepsin‐L; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; ub, ubiquitin.
