caption: 'Model for a postsynaptic FMRP signaling. At synapses, FMRP translational
  control is released upon TrkB tyrosin kinase signaling activated by BDNF (Napoli
  et al. ) and/or group I mGluRs cascade activated by DHPG (Napoli et al. ; Narayanan
  et al. ; Narayanan et al. ; Osterweil et al. ). Two alternative models have been
  proposed for the mGluR signaling upstream FMRP. The first one (A) proposes that
  the kinase ERK1/2 activation releases FMRP translational inhibition (Osterweil et
  al. ). The second one (B) implicates a bimodal PP2A/S6K signaling: an early dephosphorylation
  by PP2A (B.1) activates translation; sustained DHPG stimulation activates mTOR pathway
  (B.2), which suppresses PP2A activity and stimulates S6K, thus leading to FMRP phosphorylation
  and translational block (Narayanan et al. ; Narayanan et al. ). Furthermore, activation
  of group I mGluRs induces an early raise of FMRP due to protein synthesis (Antar
  et al. ; Ferrari et al. ; Kao et al. ) followed by a proteasome-dependent degradation
  of the protein (Hou et al. ; Zhao et al. ), restoring normal FMRP levels. Early
  events are indicated with black arrows, while late events induced by sustained stimulation
  are indicated by white arrows'
