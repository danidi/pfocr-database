caption: Schematic representation of proposed mechanisms by which lycopene prevents
  oxidative stress in MSCs. Oxidative stress triggers the induction of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in MSCs. ROS lead to the phosphorylation of ATM and apoptosis-associated
  MAPK (p38 and JNK) signaling pathway, resulting in augmentation of the phosphorylation
  of p53. Moreover, ROS break the balance between Bax and Bcl2, resulting in the induction
  of apoptosis via the cleavage of PARP-1 and Caspase-3. Lycopene suppresses oxidative
  stress-induced apoptosis through Akt-MnSOD axis. In addition, lycopene decreases
  the phosphorylation of apoptosis-associated MAPK (p38 and JNK). These effects of
  lycopene on oxidative stress induce the decrease in the phosphorylation of ATM-p53
  signaling pathway and the protection of cleavage PARP-1 and caspase-3, resulting
  in prevention of apoptosis and augmentation of survival in MSCs. ATM; ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated serine/threonine protein kinase, MAPK; mitogen-activated protein kinases,
  PARP-1; poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1, PI3K; phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase.
