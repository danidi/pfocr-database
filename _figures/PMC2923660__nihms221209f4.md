caption: Printed in red are fourteen of the eighteen carbon sources that permitted
  highest amounts of biofilm in the Phenotype MicroArray experiment (parent strain,
  ). Metabolic intermediates that are involved in their degradation are printed in
  black. D-glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and D-trehalose enter glycolysis through
  glucose 6-phosphate; D-mannose, D-mannitol, and D-fructose through fructose 6-phosphate.
  L-asparagine, L-aspartate, and L-alanine have a pathway that leads into glycolysis
  at the level of pyruvate. Succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid can serve
  as substrates for the synthesis of hexoses through gluconeogenesis; the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase converts oxaloacetate back to the glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate.
  Printed in blue are the Pta and AckA enzymes that are involved in the interconversion
  of acetyl-CoA, acetyl phosphate and acetate. Printed in green is the response regulator
  RcsB that gets phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate. Biofilm associated cell surface
  organelles that are affected by RcsB-P are printed in purple.
