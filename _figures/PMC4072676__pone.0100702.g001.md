caption: There are three modules in the network. These modules are connected by two
  distinctive forms of β-catenin. In additional to the normal form of β-catenins,
  a second form, active β-catenin, is presented in our model. Only the active β-catenins
  can activate the gene expression. The activated genetic pathways further affect
  expressions of proteins in both cadherin adhesion and β-catenin degradation modules
  through genetic feedback loops. The interplay between Wnt signaling and cell adhesion
  is captured by inter-module crosstalk, which are labeled with numbers.
