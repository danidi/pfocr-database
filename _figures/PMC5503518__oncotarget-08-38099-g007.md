caption: 'In physiological conditions, free cholesterol is derived from two main sources:
  LDLR-mediated uptake and subsequent endosomal/lysosomal processing and SREBP-mediated
  de novo synthesis. A. In TSC2-deficient cells with mTORC1 hyperactivation, increased
  cholesterol synthesis is regulated by the transcription factor SREBP. B. Lysosomal
  inhibition of TSC2-deficient cells with CQ activates compensatory mechanisms for
  maintaining cholesterol levels, involving both SREBP-mediated activation of the
  mevalonate pathway and uptake of exogenous lipoprotein uptake via LDLR. In TSC2-deficient
  (but not TSC2-expressing) cells co-treated with simvastatin, the uptake of exogenous
  lipoprotein via LDLR is sufficient to over-ride the impact of simvastatin and promote
  cell survival. C. In TSC2-deficient cells, but not TSC2-expressing cells, combination
  treatment with CQ and SAR405, a PI3KC3 inhibitor, blocks uptake of exogenous cholesterol
  esters and inhibits cell survival.'
