caption: 'Schematic representation of TLR4 signaling (adapted from  and ). Lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) binding to TLR4 stimulates both myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent
  and -independent pathways. The MyD88-dependent pathway involves activation of the
  IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which degrades the inhibitor of NF-κB IκB, allowing translocation
  of the NF-κB transcription factor to the nucleus. NF-κB binds to specific κB recognition
  sites and to coactivators, such as cAMP-response-element-binding-protein-binding-protein
  (CBP), that have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. The end result
  is acetylation of core histone H4, causing activation of gene transcription encoding
  multiple inflammatory proteins. The MyD88-independent pathway starts with engagement
  of Toll / IL-1 receptor domain (TIR) domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta
  (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), which activates TANK-binding-kinase-1
  (TBK1). TBK1 phosphorylates interferon response factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in its
  translocation to the nucleus and subsequent activation of interferon-beta and other
  genes. Corticosteroids decrease inflammation by two mechanisms: 1). activation of
  glucocorticoid receptors (GR), resulting in translocation to the nucleus and binding
  to coactivators that inhibit HAT, 2). binding to glucocorticoid-response elements
  (GREs) in the promoter region of steroid-sensitive genes, resulting in increased
  transcription of anti-inflammatory genes.'
