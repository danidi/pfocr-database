caption: Figure 5. The conceptual model for salicylic acid role on vanillin synthesis
  involving phospholipid signaling pathway. (i) Salicylic acid can be sensed on or
  near the plasma membrane by a receptor and activate a signaling cascade through
  phospholipases (PLC and/or PLD) function. This is followed by the regulation of
  PAL enzymatic activity and increased vanillin content. (ii) In the presence of U73122
  or neomycin (inhibitors of PLC signaling) the levels of DAG and Ins(1,4,5)P3 (second
  messengers), reduced which lead to modifications of intracellular Ca2+ levels that
  may affect the activity of PAL as well as the promoter of reduced vanillin production.
  (iii) The inhibitory function of 1-butanol on formation of PA could be affecting
  phosphorylation processes through the regulation of protein kinases activities that
  may be responding to PA levels. This event also could be affecting PAL activity
  following vanillin production. Therefore, response to SA resulting in the production
  of second messengers such as DAG, Ins(1,4,5)P3, and PA produced in phospholipid
  signaling pathway may be involved in regulating of PAL activity, and consequently
  vanillin production.
