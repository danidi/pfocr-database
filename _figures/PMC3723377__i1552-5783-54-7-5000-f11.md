caption: Schematic diagram showing phagocytic roles of αvβ5 and αvβ3 integrins. Model
  of how αvβ5 integrin–FAK signaling events could regulate phagocytosis in TM cells
  is based on the pathway known to be active in RPE cells. In this paradigm, activation
  of αvβ5 integrin leads to actin remodeling events which promotes the formation of
  the phagocytic cup and possibly activation of coreceptor (or coreceptors) such as
  Mer. How activation of αvβ3 integrin interferes with αvβ5 integrin-mediated phagocytosis
  in unknown. One possibility is that αvβ3 integrins redirect the signaling events
  required for F-actin remodeling during phagocytosis.
