caption: 'Schematic illustrations of identified pathways in hepatitis C virus-induced
  liver carcinogenesis. Viral DNA components promote host cell apoptosis deregulation,
  while certain viral proteins trigger proliferation signaling in the hepatic cell:
  Core and NS5A through the β-catenin pathway and NS5B by triggering tumor suppressor
  protein (pRb) degradation. Core, E1, E2, NS1 and NS2 proteins induce apoptosis,
  forcing a regeneration process, thereby promoting fibrosis. Oxidative stress due
  to inflammation also facilitates host cell genome instability and fibrosis. Inflammation
  activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that in response secrete cytokines and chemokines,
  further promoting the inflammation, damage and regeneration cycle. HSCs also play
  a crucial role in fibrosis progression, as under chronic activation they switch
  their phenotype to matrix-secreting fibroblasts. Additionally, hepatitis C virus
  genotype 3 (as well as genotypes 1 and 2) induces steatosis, which further extends
  the oxidative stress, leading to earlier fibrosis. HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma;
  HSCs: Hepatic stellate cells; HCV: Hepatitis C virus.'
