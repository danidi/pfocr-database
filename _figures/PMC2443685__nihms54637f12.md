caption: We have reported that pretreatment with EET increases (i) PI3K activity (ii)
  phosphorylation of Akt (iii) phosphorylation of BAD (iv) intracellular XIAP and
  (v) inhibition of activity of caspases-9. Each of these events decreases activity
  of caspase 3, a late effector, to protect the cardiomyocyte from apoptosis by HR.
  These targets are known to align in a signaling cascade as illustrated in the schematic.
  It should be noted that the results do not implicate absence of other pro-survival
  or mitotic pathways that may also be targeted by EETs.
