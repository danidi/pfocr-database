caption: Effects of silver nanoparticles on the cell stress response pathways. Smaller
  sized nanosilver (~10 nm diameter) enters the cell either through being taken up
  into endosomes/lysosomes by endocytosis or through simple diffusion across the cell
  membrane (potentially due to induced lipid peroxidation and disruption of the plasma
  membrane). Larger sized nanosilver or large aggregates of nanosilver cannot enter
  the cell by these means, but can instead activate various receptor-mediated signalling
  mechanisms, such as through PAK, MAPK, and PP2A. Increased lipid peroxidation causes
  increased LDH release from the cell due to cell membrane damage. Nanosilver treatment
  results in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway may be induced. The levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase
  (SOD), and catalase (CAT) are affected and an increase in oxidative stress response
  gene expression occurs. In the nucleus, an increase may occur in genotoxicity (DNA
  damage, DNA base oxidation, DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks, and chromosomal aberrations)
  and epigenetic changes (DNA methylation, various histone tail modifications, and
  changes in non-coding RNA expression), potentially in a transient manner. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased ATP production,
  and mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptosis may also occur. As well, nanosilver
  treatment increases the protein and gene expression levels of p53, leading to anti-cancer
  effects. High dose nanosilver treatment disrupts endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis
  and induces the ER stress response through activated PERK, ATF-6, and IRE-1α, and
  their respective pathways. Contact between the ER and the mitochondria increases
  with nanosilver treatment, and increased transfer of calcium from the ER to the
  mitochondria occurs, resulting in increased calcium levels in the mitochondria.
