caption: Proposed model for fasting induced activation of NRF2-ARE pathway and expression
  of downstream target genes. Fasting increases circulating glucagon and epinephrine
  levels activating cAMP/PKA cascade, which eventually will increase Pgc-1α expression
  and also activate SIRT1. cAMP/PKA induces NRF2 binding to various AREs in a SIRT1-dependent
  manner leading to an increase in Nqo1, Abcc2–4 expression. Specifically, induction
  of Pgc-1α and SIRT1 can induce Nrf2 mRNA expression, which can lead to subsequent
  induction of Nrf2-regulated target genes, such as Nqo1 and Abcc2–4. In addition,
  activation of the PKA pathway increases NRF2 and SIRT1 recruitment to MARE_ARE elements
  in the ABCC2 promoter. It is hypothesized fasting will result in the production
  or accumulation of metabolic intermediates, which could be eliminated from hepatocytes
  via Abcc2–4. Fasting increases NAD+/NADH ratios, cAMP, bile acids, lipid peroxidation,
  glucuronide and glutathione (GSH) conjugation, and decreases GSH levels within the
  hepatocyte. GSH and glucuronide conjugates are substrates for Abcc2–4, some lipid
  peroxidation products are substrates for Abcc3. Abcc4 transports cyclic nucleotides,
  such as cAMP and cGMP. Overall, fasting could increase the hepatic efflux of metabolite
  conjugates and intermediates resulting from induction of the fasting response to
  maintain cellular homeostasis.
