caption: Alternative mechanisms exist for the induction of inflammatory and apoptotic
  genes in the absence of the IFN-α/β receptor during influenza virus infection. An
  Ingenuity Pathways Analysis network diagram of select genes shown in Fig.  was created.
  “Interferon response” genes are in light blue, and “inflammatory/apoptotic response”
  genes are in orange. Also included in this network are genes that were at least
  2-fold (P < 0.01) upregulated only in infected IFN-αβR−/− and IFN-αβγR−/− MEFs but
  not in WT and IFN-γR−/− MEFs (shaded in yellow). The Venn diagram represents genes
  included in each set described above. Two genes are connected by an edge if they
  interact directly, with an arrow indicating the direction of interaction/activation.
  Solid lines represent interactions between yellow and orange gene sets or within
  the orange gene set. Dotted lines represent interactions between light blue and
  orange gene sets. Genes within categories which did not exhibit direct interactions
  between the gene sets were removed from the network. An example pathway is highlighted
  with blue edges to show how a gene that is activated only in the absence of the
  IFN-α/β receptor can potentially induce commonly regulated “inflammatory/apoptotic
  response” genes.
