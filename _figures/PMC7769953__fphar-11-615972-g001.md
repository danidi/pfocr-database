caption: IL-6 signaling pathway and inhibitory agents. IL-6 binds to mIL-6R (①) or
  sIL-6R (②), which triggers the dimerization of transmembrane gp130, followed by
  the activation of JAK which induces intracellular signaling including MAPK and STAT
  signaling pathways, and the activation of the SRC family kinase (YES, SRC), with
  the YES-associated protein signaling pathway subsequently induced. Three types of
  antibodies have been applied clinically against IL-6 signaling including anti-IL-6
  (siltuximab), anti-IL-6R (tocilizumab, sarilumab), and anti-JAK (baricitinib, ruxolitinib)
  monoclonal antibodies.
