caption: P2Y receptor activation in red blood cells. (A) Plasmodium malarial parasite
  infection of red blood cells causes oxidative stress to induce adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) release, which activates P2Y1 receptors to open an osmolyte permeability pathway
  (OPP) to facilitate parasite growth by supplying incoming nutrients and removing
  outgoing metabolic waste products. (B) Cellular stress (acidosis, adrenaline, hypoxia,
  or shear force) of red blood cells increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) to cause ATP release. Released ATP can be degraded by ectonucleotidases (NTPDases)
  to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which then activates P2Y13 receptors to reduce cAMP
  and prevent further ATP release.
