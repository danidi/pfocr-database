caption: Schematics representing different tissues using varied forms of cellular
  communication within a lineage hierarchy (solid arrows indicate cell lineages; dotted
  arrows represent signaling between different cells). A, In the fly hematopoietic
  organ, high levels of extracellular adenosine cause hematopoietic progenitor cell
  replication by enhancing PKA activity in the progenitor cells. Conversely, PKA activity
  is directly inhibited in progenitor cells by a niche cell-derived paracrine hedgehog
  signal that causes progenitors to remain quiescent. Remarkably, niche cells also
  send Pvf1 ligands to daughter cells and activate the STAT signaling pathway in these
  daughters which in turn positively regulates their expression of Adenosine deaminase
  growth factor-A. Daughter cells then secrete this enzyme which acts to decrease
  extracellular adenosine levels, again resulting in progenitor cell quiescence. Thus,
  differentiated cells negatively regulate progenitor cell replication directly, and
  also act as a conduit for a niche-derived signal that further inhibits progenitor
  cell replication. B, In the Drosophila midgut, control of mitogen expression by
  the Sox21a transcription factor in enteroblasts regulates the proliferation of intestinal
  stem cells (ISCs) through a negative feedback mechanism. Interestingly, the negative
  feedback signal, Spi1, is de-repressed during regeneration to allow increased ISC
  replication. C, In the airway epithelium, SMAD activity in basal cells is inhibited
  by basal cell-derived follistatin (FST), thereby promoting basal cell replication
  in an autocrine fashion. However, follistatin is downregulated following injury,
  which in turn activates SMAD signaling to initiate stem cell differentiation. Daughter
  cells, in contrast, send a positive feedback BMP signal that activates SMAD signaling
  in stem cells to inhibit basal cell replication when daughters accumulate. D, The
  airway epithelium employs feedforward signaling in which a tonic feedforward Notch
  ligand signal, originating in airway epithelial basal stem cells, activates steady
  state notch signaling in the daughter luminal cells to tonically maintain secretory
  daughter cells identity and stability.
