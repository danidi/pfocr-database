caption: 'Following the creation of a double-strand break, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  kinases Tel1 and Mec1 (ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) mutated (ATM) and A-T and RAD3-related
  (ATR) in mammals) phosphorylate H2AX. The non-histone protein 10 (Nhp10) subunit
  of the INO80 complex is needed for the complex to associate with phosphorylated
  H2AX (γ-H2AX). Once localized to the DNA break site, core catalytic subunits, such
  as actin-related protein 5 (Arp5) and Arp8, participate in DNA repair processes.
  The Tel1 and Mec1 kinases also phosphorylate INO80 subunit 4 (Ies4) to regulate
  the cell cycle checkpoint response. Therefore, Tel1 and Mec1 regulate two aspects
  of the INO80 complex when cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents: the phosphorylation
  of H2AX, leading to the recruitment of the INO80 complex at DNA damage sites, and
  phosphorylation of the Ies4 subunit to influence the cell cycle checkpoint response.'
