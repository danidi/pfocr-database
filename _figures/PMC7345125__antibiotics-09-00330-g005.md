caption: Schematic representation of l-lysine biosynthesis via α-aminoadipate pathway.
  It illustrates that precursors acetyl-CoA and α-ketoglutarate in the presence of
  homocitrate synthase form homocitrate (a tricarboxylic acid). Homoaconitase enzyme
  dehydrates homocitrate to form homoaconitate (homoaconitatic acid) that leads to
  the formation of homoisocitrate in the presence of homoaconitase and water. Homoisocitrate
  dehydrogenase converts homoisocitrate into α-ketoadipate. NAD is converted into
  NADH and CO2 is generated during this step. Now, glutamate reacts with α-ketoadipate
  and forms α-amino adipate which converts into l-lysine. 2-oxoglutatarte (de-amination
  of glutamate) is also generated in the process. Concept adopted (and modified) from
  Fazius, F., 2012, Jastrzebowska, K., 2015 and Miyazaki, J., 2001 [,,].
