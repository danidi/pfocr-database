caption: Schematic Representation of the Therapeutic GADD45β/MKK7-Targeting Strategy
  in CancerDepicted is the crosstalk between the NF-κB and JNK pathways promoting
  the survival of cancer cells and cells exposed to inflammatory stimuli. Also illustrated
  is the NF-κB-dependent, Gadd45β/MKK7-mediated mechanism suppressing apoptotic JNK
  signaling in MM cells. Our therapeutic strategy to block the NF-κB survival function
  in a cancer-selective manner with DTP3 (green) is compared with conventional therapeutic
  approaches (e.g., IKKβ and proteasome inhibitors; red) also aimed at inhibiting
  the NF-κB pathway in cancer. MAP3Ks, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
