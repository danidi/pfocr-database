caption: 'The molecular mechanism of SOCS- and IRF-regulated cytokine signaling in
  macrophages during ALI/ARDS. (a) Normal resident AMs are activated and shift into
  the M1 phenotype upon certain stimulation during the exudative phase of ALI/ARDS.
  Proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-β are excreted by M1 macrophages
  into the site of inflammation. The JAK–STAT1 pathway is activated by IFN-γ, and
  SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced. SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibit the signaling pathway by different
  mechanisms. IRF5 promotes M1 polarization by directly binding to IL-12 and IL-23
  promoters. Leukocytes migrate into the cellular airspace by the activation of chemokines
  such as KC, MIP-2, and IL-8. Monocytes from the circulation are also recruited by
  chemokines such as MCP-1 and shift into the M1 phenotype. Crosstalk between SOCS3
  and IRF5 may exist. (b) Macrophages shift from the M1 phenotype to the M2 phenotype
  during the later phase of ALI/ARDS. This process is regulated by several factors,
  including IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, STAT6, and IRF4. IL-4 or IL-13 activates the JAK–STAT6
  pathway, and SOCS1 is induced. SOCS1 feedback inhibits the IL-4/IL-13 signaling.
  IRF4 inhibits IRF5 activation by a competing interaction with the adaptor MyD88.
  Recruited macrophages play an important role in eliminating apoptotic cells, debris,
  and pathogens. AMs: alveolar macrophages; IFN-γ: interferon-γ; JAK: Janus kinase;
  IL: interleukin; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; IRF: interferon
  regulator factor; SOCS: suppressors of cytokine signaling; KC: keratinocyte-derived
  chemokine; MIP: macrophage inflammatory protein; MCP: monocyte chemoattractant protein;
  TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor α; TLR: toll-like receptor; MyD88: myeloid differentiation
  factor 88.'
