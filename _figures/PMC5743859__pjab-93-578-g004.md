caption: Involvement of NOD1 in acute pancreatitis. Excessive drinking of alcohol
  and intake of high fat foods cause cholecystokinin receptor (CCKR) signaling pathways
  to induce intra-acinar activation of trypsinogen. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain 1 (NOD1) expressed in pancreatic acinar cells detects peptidoglycan (PGN)
  derived from intestinal microflora translocated into the pancreas. CCKR-mediated
  signaling pathway causes nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) subunits
  through the interaction between protein kinase C (PKC) and TGF-β-activated kinase
  1 (TAK1). NOD1-mediated signaling pathway causes nuclear translocation of NF-κB
  subunits through the interaction between receptor interacting protein 2 (RIP2) and
  TAK1. Synergistic activation of NF-κB is achieved by simultaneous activation of
  CCKR and NOD1. Sensing of PGN by NOD1 causes nuclear translocation of interferon
  regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) through activation of TNF receptor associated factor
  3 (TRAF3) to induce production of IFN-β. Production of IFN-β induced by NOD1 activation
  acts together with CCKR activation to induce optimal activation of signal transduction
  and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Simultaneous activation of NOD1 and CCKR
  leads to a robust production of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) by pancreatic
  acinar cells through activation of NF-κB and Stat3, which mediates migration of
  inflammatory myeloid cells into the pancreas.
