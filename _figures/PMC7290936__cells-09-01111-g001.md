caption: Role of exosomes in intercellular communication during infection with Crohn
  disease (CD)-associated adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC). AIEC infection leads to
  increased levels of miR-30c and miR-130a in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs),
  thereby inhibiting autophagy. These miRNAs can be transferred via the exosomal shuttle
  from cell to cell, impairing autophagy-mediated AIEC clearance and favoring AIEC
  colonization in intestinal epithelium (unpublished data). Moreover, the exosomes
  secreted by AIEC-infected IECs activate the NF-κB pathway in recipient IECs, enhancing
  IL-8 production. Similarly, increases in AIEC intracellular replication and the
  activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, leading to enhanced secretion of the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, were observed in macrophages receiving exosomes derived
  from IECs and macrophages infected with AIEC.
