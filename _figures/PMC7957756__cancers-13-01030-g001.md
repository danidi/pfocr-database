caption: Schematic illustration of the vessel stability regulation by Ang/Tie signaling.
  (a) Ang1 binds to Tie2 promoting vascular stability. (b) Ang2 has a dual function
  acting as a Tie2 agonist or antagonist to promote vascular stability or sprouting,
  respectively. (c) Tie1 forms a complex with Tie2. Upon Ang2 stimulation, Tie1 and
  Tie2 remain associated and Ang2 induces vascular sprouting. (d) Ang1 stimulation
  promotes Tie2 clustering leading to vascular stability. This schematic representation
  includes the most consensual theories; however, this pathway is not yet fully understood.
  Besides that, this figure is a schematic representation that is not intended to
  translate the real chemical conformation of the proteins.
