caption: Schematic model of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulated by PARG
  gene silencing during BaP-induced lung cancer. After activation of the canonical
  pathway, Wnt ligands bind to Frzzled and LRP5/6 on the cell surface to form a trimer,
  which weakens the stability of a destruction complex composed by β-catenin, Axin,
  GSK-3β, and APC to prevent the phosphorylated degradation of β-catenin. The concentration
  of β-catenin increases in the cytoplasm, and then transfers into the nucleus to
  ultimately activate the expression of downstream target genes. PARG gene silencing
  may promote binding of phosphorylated proteins to the Axin scaffolding proteins,
  affecting the stability of the key protein β-catenin, and then suppressing the activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to stabilize the expression of Wnt2b against the progression
  of lung cancer.
