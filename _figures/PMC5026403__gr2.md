caption: Complement activation and immune regulation. The complement system can be
  activated by the classical pathway (CP), mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway and
  the alternative pathway (AP); all leads to the cleavage of C3 and C5 and the formation
  of C5b-C9. C3 is cleavaged by C3 convertases, which include C4bC2b of the CP and
  MBL pathways and C3bBb of the AP. C5 is cleavaged by C5 convertases, which include
  C4bC2bC3b of the CP and MBL pathways and C3bBbC3b of the AP. Activation of the complement
  system generates C4a, C3a, C3b and C5a fragments that are actively involved in immune
  responses. C3b opsonizes foreign antigens and apoptotic cells, promoting phagocytosis.
  C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins that have multiple immune regulatory roles. The C5b-C9
  may directly kill pathogens or cells. The sub-lytic C5b-9 can also promote inflammation.
