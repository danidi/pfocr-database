caption: PAM sf-CD signaling pathway. Secretory granules contain neuropeptides and
  processing enzymes like the prohormone convertases, carboxypeptidase E, and PAM.
  Granules release their soluble content during regulated exocytosis. PAM, a secretory
  granule membrane protein, reaches the plasma membrane and can be recycled and reused.
  In the granules, PAM is cleaved by prohormone convertases, generating a TMD-CD fragment
  with a longer stalk region. When PAM is cleaved by an α-secretase-like enzyme on
  the plasma membrane or in the endocytic pathway, a TMD-CD fragment with a shorter
  stalk is generated. These TMD-CD fragments can be degraded or cleaved by a γ-secretase-like
  enzyme, possibly in the endocytic pathway, generating sf-CD. sf-CD is produced in
  response to stimulated exocytosis and is more stable in primary pituitary cells
  than in AtT-20 cells. sf-CD accumulates in the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent
  manner, modulating the expression of genes like Aqp1, which is involved in secretory
  granule biogenesis.
