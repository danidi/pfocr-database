caption: Mouse ESCs were differentiated in serum free conditions for four days. At
  day 2 of differentiation, embroid bodies were dispersed and Activin A was added
  to the culture media to stimulate Activin A/TGFβ signaling pathway. Cells were harvested
  at day 4 from serum free media control (SFM) and Activin A containing well (AA100)
  and mRNA was isolated. The mRNA was later subjected to serial dilutions ranging
  from 50 ng– 25 pg. Std. RNA-seq libraries were prepared from 50 ng of mRNA derived
  from SFM and AA100 samples. Sequencing libraries were prepared from serial dilutions
  (1 ng, 100 pg, 50 pg and 25 pg) of mRNA using Smart-seq, DP-seq and CEL-seq. All
  sequencing libraries were prepared with two technical replicates where same mRNA
  source was used and the library preparation steps were replicated. Salient details
  of all the methods are shown.
