caption: Proposed pathway for B12 targeting to methionine synthase for MeCbl synthesis.
  Cofactor transfer from MMACHC to MS precedes conversion of inactive cob(II)alamin
  to MeCbl, in a process that requires MSR, NADPH, and AdoMet (S-adenosylmethionine).
  During turnover, B12 bound to MS shuttles between the MeCbl and cob(I)alamin states.
  Oxidation of the latter creates the dependency of the MS reaction on reductive activation
  by MSR.
