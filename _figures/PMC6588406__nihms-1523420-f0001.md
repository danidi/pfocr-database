caption: Nascent procollagen polypeptides, comprised of N-propeptide (~15 kDa), triple-helical
  (up to ~100 kDa), and C-propeptide (~30 kDa) domains, are first co-translationally
  imported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Within the ER, they undergo extensive
  co- and post-translational modifications prior to folding. These modifications include
  introduction of an N-glycan in the C-propeptide domain, extensive hydroxylation
  of proline residues that is required for thermal stability, and lysine hydroxylation
  that promotes extracellular crosslinking. Procollagen folding in the ER begins with
  the autonomous folding of the ~30 kDa C-propeptide domain on each monomeric strand,
  which can only begin after the entire protein is translated. The C-propeptide is
  a cysteine-rich domain whose folded state is stabilized by multiple intramolecular
  disulfide bonds. After the C-propeptide folds, individual C-propeptide domains recognize
  each other and assemble, a process that, at least for the fibrillar collagens, is
  mediated by Ca2+- and intermolecular disulfide bonds []. The resulting assembled
  C-propeptide trimer controls the triple helix register and initiates zipper-like
  folding of the proline- and glycine-rich triple-helical domain, a process that itself
  requires isomerization of hundreds of proline peptide bonds to the trans configuration.
  Triple-helix formation attenuates further procollagen hydroxylation, and sets the
  stage for secretion of the protein via a non-canonical pathway. For the fibrillar
  collagens, the mature protein is produced by cleavage of the propeptide domains,
  initiating extensive supramolecular assembly and the generation of hierarchical
  tissue architectures. This process is orchestrated by an extensive suite of ER chaperones
  and quality control mechanisms that are regulated by the three arms of the unfolded
  protein response (IRE1, ATF6, and PERK), as well as the related transcriptional
  responders OASIS and BBF2H7, which are highlighted in the lower portion of the figure.
