caption: Physiological and pathophysiological stimuli regulate tonicity-responsive
  enhanced binding protein (TonEBP) in diverse cell types. Novel, tonicity-independent
  stimuli regulate TonEBP expression, transactivation, nuclear translocation, reporter
  activity, and downstream TonEBP-dependent gene activation. Solid lines represent
  more defined signaling cascades, whereas dashed lines represent less defined pathways.
  In T-cells, T-cell receptor activation and PMA + ionomycin (a calcium ionophore)
  upregulate TonEBP expression and activity via the calcineurin (CaN) pathway. CaN
  inhibitors cyclosporine A (CsA) and FK506 block T-cell receptor and PMA + ionomycin
  stimulation of TonEBP. In carcinomas, α6β4 integrin clustering stimulates TonEBP
  expression and activity leading to enhanced s100 calcium binding protein a4 (s100a4)
  gene expression and increased carcinoma migration and invasion. TPA + ionomycin
  stimulation also upregulates TonEBP activity in carcinomas. In nucleus pulposus
  cells of the intervertebral disc, PMA + ionomycin stimulates TonEBP expression,
  independent of calcineurin, which leads to increased β1,3-glucuroosyltransferase-I
  (GlcAT-I) gene expression. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and transforming
  growth factor β (TFG-β) both upregulate TonEBP expression and transactivation in
  nucleus pulposus cells resulting in increased GlcAT-1 expression. In fibroblast-like
  synoviocytes within rheumatoid arthritic joints, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor
  necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) upregulate TonEBP expression resulting in fibroblast-like
  synoviocyte proliferation and increased cell survival. In vascular smooth muscle
  cells, angiotensin II stimulates TonEBP nuclear translocation and activity independent
  of calcineurin, which results in increased smooth muscle α-actin (SMαA) gene expression.
  Also in vascular smooth muscle cells, platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB)
  upregulates TonEBP expression and activity, independent of calcineurin, leading
  to increased smooth muscle cell migration. In kidney cells, superoxide + NaCl-induced
  hypertonicity augments TonEBP transactivation and activity resulting in increased
  expression of the sodium chloride/betaine cotransporter (BGT1) gene and increased
  kidney cell survival. Also in kidney cells, nitric oxide increases TonEBP S-nitrosylation
  leading to decreased TonEBP activity, inhibited expression of aldose reductase (AR),
  and sodium/myoinositol cotransporter (SMIT) gene expression and is believed to contribute
  to diuresis.
