caption: Cop-1 induced T cell-mediated neuroprotection in a PD model. In MPTP-intoxicated
  mice, regulatory T cells infiltrate the inflamed nigrostriatal pathway where they
  encounter cross-reactive self-antigens (myelin basic protein) presented in the context
  of MHC by resident microglial cells. Activated T cells secrete anti-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β that suppress toxic microglial activities.
  Neurotrophin expression may occur directly from T cells or T cell derived IL-4 and
  IL-10 may induce neurotrophin production in neighboring glia. These activities lead
  to neuroprotection indirectly by suppression of microglial responses and directly
  through the local delivery of neurotrophins.
