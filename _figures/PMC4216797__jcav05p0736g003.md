caption: Mechanism and Role of AMPK activation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
  a serine/threonine kinase, is an energy sensor whose activity is regulated by glucose.
  AMPK activation, secondary to a change in the AMP/ATP ratio, activation by upstream
  kinases, such as CAMKK (CaMK kinase) and LKB1, or administration of metformin by
  direct activation of LKB1, slows metabolic reactions that consume ATP and stimulates
  reactions that produce ATP, thereby restoring the AMP/ATP ratio and the normal cellular
  energy stores. AMPK activation will in turn induce catabolic pathways, such as fatty
  acid oxidation by inactivating acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC2), and will inhibit anabolic
  pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis, mediated by ACC1. The mTOR pathway suppresses
  apoptosis via its effect on the tumor suppressors p53 and p27 and inhibits autophagy
  by suppressing UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and ULK2. AMPK activation downregulates
  the tumorigenic effects of mTOR through the TSC1/TSC2 complex, thus leading to increased
  apoptosis and autophagy-mediated cell death. AMPK activation also inactivates P70S6K
  and 4E-BP1 subsequently inhibiting protein synthesis. AMPK activation regulates
  the transcription factor FOXO3, which in turn increases antioxidant gene expression.
