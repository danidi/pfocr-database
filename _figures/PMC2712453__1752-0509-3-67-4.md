caption: MAKP signaling pathway of yeast. Depicted is the KEGG pathway and the pathway
  inferred by BowTieBuilder. The membrane-bound proteins are drawn at the top, and
  the TFs are drawn at the bottom. The inferred proteins are depicted in between.
  Proteins that do not overlap between the KEGG and BowTieBuilder pathways are depicted
  in gray. The core proteins are embedded in a gray box, where FUS3 is contained in
  all core structures. The recall and precision values are given in Table 1.
