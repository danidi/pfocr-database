caption: 'A schematic illustration of the PI3-k/Akt pathway initiated by PDGF/PDGFR
  which leads to proliferation and anti-apoptosis in megakaryocytes. An interaction
  between PDGF and PDGFR induces receptor dimerization and auto-phosphorylation on
  tyrosine kinase. The phospho-tyrosine functions as the docking sites for PI3-k molecules.
  Activated PI3-k leads to downstream Akt phosphorylation. Activation of Akt protects
  the mitochondrial membrane from depolarization and inhibits the release of cytochrome
  c, which negatively regulates the expression of activated caspase-3. Additionally,
  phosphorylation of Akt also inactivates caspase-3 directly. These signaling cascades
  lead to inhibition of megakaryocytes apoptosis. Imatinib mesylate used as a tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor, blocks the activation of the PDGF receptor. Wortmannin specifically
  inhibits PI3-kinase activity. Abbreviations: TK, tyrosine kinase; P, phosphorylation;
  PI3-k, phosphoinositide 3-kinases; Arrows (|) indicate experimentally verified stimulatory
  interactions, which may not be direct. Inhibitory interactions are denoted as ⊥.'
