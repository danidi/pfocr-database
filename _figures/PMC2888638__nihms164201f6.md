caption: '(A)Schematic model showing the role of PKCδ in neurotoxin-induced neuronal
  apoptosis. Exposure to neurotoxins, such as MPP+, dieldrin, manganese and H2O2,
  induces early events of apoptosis including generation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and release of cytochrome C into cytosol. The
  released cytosolic cytochrome C activates caspase-9, which subsequently activates
  caspase-3. Activated caspase-3 mediates proteolytic cleavage of PKCδ to produce
  an active PKCδ fragment. Proteolytic activation of PKCδ eventually contributes to
  cell death. The proteolytic activation of PKCδ can also regulate upstream the mitochondrial
  dependent caspase cascade by a positive feedback loop. (B). Schematic model for
  cell death and cell survival signaling pathway regulated by MLK3: Under growth factor
  sufficient conditions, PI3 kinase-AKT pathway remains active that leads to inhibition
  of GSK3β. AKT also phosphorylates MLK3 at Ser674 site and attenuates MLK3 kinase
  activity. The inhibition of MLK3 kinase activity prevents the activation of JNK,
  finally leading to cell survival. On the contrary, the proinflammatory cytokines,
  TNFα activates MLK3 probably via ceramide generation or by some unknown mechanism.
  The activation of MLK3 by its agonists leads to activation of JNK and finally leading
  to cell death.'
