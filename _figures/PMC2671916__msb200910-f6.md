caption: 'Novel functional modules with dynamic gene expression changes potentially
  linked to prion pathophysiology: (A) androgen metabolism, (B) iron metabolism, (C)
  arachidonate/phospholipid metabolism. Hypothetical networks of proteins and metabolites
  that are potentially involved in three novel functional modules were constructed
  based on genes selected from the list of 333 shared DEGs and metabolic pathway information
  from literature. The temporal expression changes at six time points (10, 14, 16,
  18, 20, and 22 weeks after inoculating BL6 mice with RML prions) are represented
  by the circular heatmaps of the network nodes: the center color of each node indicates
  the differential expression at 10 weeks, whereas the outer circle colors represent
  expression changes at increasing time points. Large nodes indicate DEGs whose expression
  change patterns are shared by five mouse-prion combinations; asterisks indicate
  DEGs whose prion-related changes are unique in this study. See text for detailed
  description of the three pathways.'
