caption: 'Oxidative Phosphorylation System (OXPHOS). Electrons derived from cellular
  metabolism reach complex I or complex II through NADH or FADH2, respectively. These
  electrons are then transferred to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone), a carrier of electrons
  from complex I or II, to III. In the latter, particles are shifted form cytochrome
  b to cytochrome c with a consequent transfer to Complex IV (cytochrome oxidase)
  where they reduce O2. This electrons transport through mitochondrial complexes is
  coupled to shipment of protons in the intermembrane space. The electrochemical gradient
  generated is used by Complex V for ATP synthesis. Adapted from the KEGG Oxidative
  phosphorylation pathway (Reference number: 00190, http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00190)'
