caption: Cartoon showing intracellular signaling associated to the expression of S1P1
  on the membrane. The binding of S1P to S1P1 receptor increases mTOR/HIF-1α activation
  as well as increase of JAK2/pSTAT3 pathway. Both signaling routes increase TH1/TH17
  effector phenotype and prevent Treg-cell differentiation. CD69 expression in activated
  lymphocytes prevents S1P1-induced signaling by promoting the internalization and
  degradation of the receptor (1) and by increasing the JAK3/pSTAT5 pathway (2), which
  counteract STAT3-induced expression of IL-17 and promotes Treg development. The
  interaction of CD69 with putative ligands, for example Gal-1 (soluble, bound to
  the plasma membrane of dendritic cells, either directly or through an unidentified,
  glycosylated, co-receptor) could potentially modulate these CD69-mediated effects.
