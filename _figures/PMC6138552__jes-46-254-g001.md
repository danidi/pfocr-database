caption: Proposed mechanisms by which dietary NO3− influences muscle contractile function
  in humans. After ingestion, NO3− is converted to NO2− by bacterial nitroreductases
  in the oral cavity and endogenous nitroreductases (e.g., xanthine oxidoreductase)
  in muscle itself. This increase in NO2− in turn leads to enhanced production of
  the free radical NO. Elevated NO bioavailability then results in multiple effects,
  as shown in the figure. These include nitrosylation of the sarcroendoplasmic reticululm
  RyR, which increases Ca2+ release by “locking” this channel in the open configuration.
  The subsequent increase in free intracellular [Ca2+]i contributes to the improvements
  in twitch force (Ftw), rate of force development (dF/dt), estimated maximal shortening
  velocity (Vmax), and maximal power (Pmax) of muscle that have been observed after
  dietary NO3− intake. Simultaneously, however, the increase in [Ca2+]i also results
  in activation of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK) via the Ca2+-CaM
  pathway and hence an increase in myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation (pRLC).
  This results in greater Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, thereby also
  contributing to the increases in Ftw, dF/dt, Vmax, and Pmax. Paralleling these events,
  the increase in NO also results in activation of sGC and hence an increase in cGMP
  production. This increase in cGMP stimulates PKG activity, which in turn enhances
  regulatory light chain phosphorylation and hence Ca2+ sensitivity, thus improving
  muscle contractile function. Finally, also shown are the effects of increased NO
  on TropI, on the myosin heavy chain, and on the SERCA. An increase in NO can enhance
  nitrosylation of TropI in fast-twitch (but not slow-twitch) fibers, but this inhibits
  (lines) Ca2+ sensitivity, which is the opposite of what has been observed after
  dietary NO3− supplementation. Similarly, elevation in NO could increase nitrosylation
  of myosin, but this would diminish, not enhance, muscle contractile function. Elevated
  NO also can inhibit SERCA directly, but this would also tend to diminish muscle
  function, by slowing the rate of relaxation and resulting in eventual depletion
  of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. Thus, these other potential effects of NO
  cannot explain the dietary NO3−-induced improvements in contractility that have
  been found repeatedly. cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; NO, nitric oxide; NO2−,
  nitrite; NO3−, nitrate; PKG, protein kinase G; RyR, ryanodine receptor; SERCA, sarcoendoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+ ATPase; sGC, soluble guanyl cyclase.
