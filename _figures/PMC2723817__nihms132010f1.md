caption: Exposure to cigarette smoke in susceptible individuals leads to an abnormal
  inflammation which appears to be self-perpetuating and is perhaps linked to infection.
  Alveolar macrophages and pulmonary epithelial cells release all kinds of inflammatory
  mediators in response to cigarette smoke which activate and stimulate migration
  of pulmonary inflammatory cells including neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes.
  The chronic and persistent inflammation that ensues is thought to be responsible
  for both the symptoms of disease and also the progressive decline in lung function
  that is seen in COPD patients. The loss of airway function appears to be related
  to the destruction of alveoli resulting in a loss of elasticity linked to increased
  protease activity, and obstruction and fibrosis of the small airway as a result
  of inflammation and mucus hyper-secretion. Emerging anti-inflammatory therapies
  under clinical investigation attack this chronic pulmonary inflammation via several
  strategies. Signaling pathway inhibitors such as PDE4 inhibitors, p38 MAPK inhibitors,
  NF-κB signaling inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors are in development. Reduction of
  pleiotropic inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α using monoclonal antibodies that
  target the ligands, or soluble receptors that bind and inactivate TNF-α may also
  reduce the inflammatory burden in the lung. Targeting chemokines such as MCP-1 and
  IL-8 may reduce the influx of inflammatory cells into the lungs from the circulation
  by reducing the chemotactic gradient. Inhibition of protease activity in the lung
  may attenuate lung tissue damage and reduce the numbers of lung neutrophils. Increase
  HDAC2 expression restores the steroids sensitivity for treatment of COPD. Reducing
  the severity of inflammation in the lung may improve lung function and slow the
  progression of COPD.
