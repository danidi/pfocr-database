caption: Elevation of activity impairs Erk1/2-STAT3 signaling to control p53 expression.
  In mature neurons, Erk1/2 activates STAT3, and STAT3 binds and regulates p53 transcription,
  leading to resistance to the loss of neurotrophin-Akt survival signaling. This alternative
  survival pathway is impaired when neurons are challenged by elevated activity.
