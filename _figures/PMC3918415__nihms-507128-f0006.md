caption: 'Contemporary multistep, two-dimensional model of human breast cancer progression
  derived from morphological, immunohistochemical, genetic and gene-expression data.
  Distinct molecular events occur in normal breast epithelium, giving rise to two
  distinct divergent molecular pathways within which linear pathological stage progression
  (horizontal black arrows) and intrastage heterogeneity (i.e., tumor-grade evolution;
  vertical red dashed arrows) occur. (a) The low grade-like gene-expression molecular
  pathway is characterized by chromosome 16q loss, predominant estrogen and progesterone
  receptor expression (ER+, PR+) and a low-grade gene-expression profile populated
  with genes associated with ER positivity (ER+). This low-grade pathway is observed
  in preinvasive lesions of both the ductal subtype (light blue rectangles) and lobular
  subtype (green rectangles). (b) The high grade-like gene-expression molecular pathway
  is characterized by loss of chromosome 13q; gain of 11q13 and/or amplification of
  17q12; infrequent expression of ER and PR; and a high grade-like gene-expression
  signature populated with genes associated with cell cycle, centrosomal function,
  and DNA repair. Although pleomorphic atypical ductal hyperplasia (ALH), pleomorphic
  lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC),
  phenotypically resemble high grade tumors, immunohistochemical (ER positivity) and
  genetic (16q loss and 1q gain) data support an evolutionary association with the
  low grade-like gene-expression molecular pathway. Recent immunohisto-chemical, morphological
  and genetic data support the concept of intrastage tumor-grade progression (red
  dashed arrows), which probably accounts for the observation of intratumoral heterogeneity.
  Light blue and green rectangles denote ductal and lobular morphological subtypes,
  respectively. Abbreviations: ALH, atypical lobular hyperplasia; DCIS, ductal carcinoma
  in situ; FEA, flat epithelial atypia; HER+(−), presence (absence) of immunohistochemical
  expression or HER gene amplification; IDC, invasive ductal carcinoma; −16q, loss
  of chromosome 16q; +1q, gain of chromosome 1q; −13q, loss of chromosome 13q; +11q13,
  gain of chromosomal region 11q13; +17q12, amplification of chromosomal region 17q12.'
