caption: BABA-influenced changes within the mevalonate pathway. The effect of 10 mM
  BABA on transcripts encoding genes within the mevalonate pathway in leaves of potato.
  BABA caused a down-regulation of several transcripts involved with sterol biosynthesis,
  whereas transcripts involved with sesquiterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis were up-regulated.
  Transcripts with significantly changed expression (adj. p-value <0.05) are denoted
  in red (up-regulation) and green (down-regulation).
