caption: Figure 1. Model of melanosome biogenesis. Schematic diagram of the four stages
  of melanosome maturation (I–IV), endosomal organelles and biosynthetic transport
  pathways followed by the cargo integral membrane proteins Pmel17, tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related
  protein-1 (Tyrp-1) and Tyrp-2. Melanosomal cargoes derive from the Golgi complex
  and traverse early/recycling endosomal domains either directly or through the cell
  surface. Sorting of Pmel17 to intraluminal vesicles from the limiting membrane of
  vacuolar early endosomal domains mark Stage I melanosomes. This process initiates
  the segregation of pre-melanosomes from the degradative late endosome/multi-vesicular
  body (MVB) pathway to lysosomes. Formation of Pmel17 fibrils across the length of
  the organelle characterizes stage II melanosomes. Tyrosinase and Tyrp1 reach the
  maturing melanosome from specialized tubular domains of early/recycling endosomes
  and catalyze the synthesis of the melanin pigment observed in stage III and IV melanosomes.
  Rab32 and Rab38 interact with AP-1, AP-3 and BLOC-2 on early/recycling endosome
  tubules, where cargo such as tyrosinase and Tyrp1 are loaded into vesicles or transport
  intermediates. This trafficking machinery is organized into at least two parallel
  or alternate routes for transport of cargo to the maturing melanosome, such that
  deficiency of one component typically causes a partial defect rather than complete
  failure of melanosome biogenesis. Rab32, Rab38 and possibly BLOC-2 remain associated
  with the vesicles or transport intermediates to promote their motility, tethering
  and fusion with the maturing melanosome. The pathway taken by Tyrp2 is not known,
  but it is at least partially different from that of tyrosinase or Tyrp1 and it depends
  strictly on Rab32—not on Rab38—and BLOC-3.
