caption: FA-regulated ICL repair. ICL-stalled replication forks (one fork on each
  side of the ICL) are recognized by FANCM–FAAP24–MHF complex, which in turn recruits
  FA core complex to the damage site and activates ATRIP/ATR signaling via the recruitment
  of replication protein A. ATR phosphorylates FA pathway components and promotes
  FANCD2 (D2) monoubiquitination, and one of the forks continues to progress to the
  cross-link site. By the time the fork reaches position −1, FANCD2 has been monoubiquitinated
  by the FA core complex. FANCD2-Ub–FANCI recruits FAN1 to the damage site, where
  FAN1 performs nucleolytic incisions and promotes the unhooking of the cross-link,
  allowing lesion bypass by TLS polymerases. FAN1 may also be involved in later steps
  in this model, such as DNA excision and homologous recombination (HR). P, phosphate;
  I, FANCI.
