caption: 'Induction of the glycolysis/pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) transition during
  oxidative stress. The PPP plays a pivotal role in counteracting oxidative stress
  and is implicated in (i) maintaining metabolic and redox homeostasis via NADP+ to
  NADPH reduction, (ii) by synthesizing ribose 5-phosphate used in nucleotide biosynthesis
  (increased synthesis is required upon DNA damage stress), and (iii) an important
  role in activating stress-responsive gene expression. In a stress situation, activity
  of the PPP is increased through orchestrated allosteric/post-translational (=metabolic)
  and transcriptional regulation, but these are not necessarily acting at the same
  time. The fastest response (~seconds timescale) is made possible through oxidative
  inhibition of glycolytic enzymes represented by the arrow moving from glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (illustrated as a crystallographic structure),
  which acts as one of the metabolic switches, while the PPP remains active. This
  process is supported by post-translational modifications that increase glucose 6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity. The comparatively slower (=minutes) process of altering
  transcript and protein levels allows for cellular adaptation to stress in the long(er)-term
  response. The GAPDH crystallographic structure was obtained from RCSB-PDB (www.rcsb.org).
