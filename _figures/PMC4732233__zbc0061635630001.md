caption: Schematic flow-chart of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide biosynthesis. A, the soluble
  peptidoglycan precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide is synthesized in the cytoplasm
  by the sequential action of the six MurA-F enzymes. B, through catalysis by the
  integral membrane protein MraY this soluble precursor is linked to the membrane
  carrier molecule C55-P. The resulting lipid I is modified by the membrane-associated
  protein MurG by addition of the sugar molecule GlcNAc leading to the formation of
  lipid II.
