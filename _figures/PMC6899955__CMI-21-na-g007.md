caption: Model of the interaction mechanism between Mtb FadD13 and macrophage. When
  Mtb cells enter the phagosome in macrophage through endocytosis, the acidic condition
  induces FadD13 upregulation. Due to the cell membrane and the membrane of Mycobacterium‐containing
  vacuole have similar structure; we deduced that when Mtb enter the vacuole in macrophages,
  FadD13 is secreted, together with ESX‐1 and DIM, causing Mycobacterium‐containing
  vacuole membrane damage. However, this speculation needs to prove experimentally.
  This may help further to explain that FadD13 promotes Mtb to survive in macrophages.
  Simultaneously, the macrophage eEF1A1 binds with FadD13 in cytoplasm to prevent
  itself from degradation, allowing it to promote the activation of NF‐κB signalling
  pathway, so as to increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines
