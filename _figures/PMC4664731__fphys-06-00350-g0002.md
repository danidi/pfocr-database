caption: Possible actions of metabolic syndrome on glia-to-neuron communication mediated
  by hemichannels. Metabolic syndrome (MS) may induce a generalized inflammatory state
  that could affect the nervous system (1). In this context, autocrine/paracrine release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β and TNF-α) by reactive glial cells could
  lead to the activation of a p38MAPK/iNOS-dependent pathway and further production
  of nitric oxide (NO) (2). NO could cause the nitrosilation of Cx43, resulting in
  opening of Cx43 glial cell hemichannels (3). Alternatively, for an unknown mechanism,
  NO could increase the activity of Panx1 hemichannels. Along with the systemic inflammatory
  state, MS impairs mitochondrial function in glial cells, leading to redox potential
  imbalance and subsequent uncontrolled production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  (4). Modulation of oxidative status of Cx43 and/or Panx1 hemichannels by ROS could
  increase their activity (5). High levels of triglycerides and fatty acids during
  the progression of MS could directly enhance the opening of hemichannels in glial
  cells (6). In addition, paracrine release of gliotransmitters through glial cell
  hemichannels (e.g., ATP, glutamate, D-serine) (7) could act on neighboring or distant
  neurons, resulting in the activation of P2X7 and NMDA receptors (8). The latter
  increase levels of [Ca2+]i, (9) and thereof the activity of neuronal Panx1 channels,
  resulting in neuronal function impairment and cell death (10).
