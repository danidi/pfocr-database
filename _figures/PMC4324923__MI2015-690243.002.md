caption: 'Current model of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RPE. (1) Priming of the
  RPE by one of the following factors (LPS [], TNF-α [], IL-1α [], CEP [], and Aβ1-40
  []) is needed in order to activate the NF-κB pathway, which can be specifically
  blocked by vinpocetine or BAY 11-7082 []. Intriguingly, DICER1 deficiency induced
  Alu RNA accumulation has also been demonstrated to prime NF-κB signaling, independent
  of toll-like receptors (TLRs) []. (2) Once the NF-κB pathway is active, it promotes
  the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. (3–7) For the production of mature IL-1β
  and IL-18; separate inflammasome components are assembled as a multiprotein complex
  triggered by one of the following mechanisms: K+ efflux via P2X7 receptor activation
  in response to extracellular ATP accumulation or intracellular Alu RNA [] (3); cytoplasmic
  cathepsin B release from destabilized phagolysosomes of lipofuscin/A2E [] (4); ROS
  overproduction caused by 4-HNE [] (5). Other NLRP3 inflammasome activation mechanisms
  that have been reported in immune cells but not validated in RPE cells are shown
  in red text and arrows. These include drusen components (C1q [] and fibrillar Aβ
  []) induced lysosomal damage (4), C3a triggered ATP efflux [], MAC formation []
  (6), BRCC3-mediated deubiquitylation [], and LUBAC-mediated ubiquitylation [] (7).
  (8) Successful assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome triggers autoproteolysis of procaspase-1

  into bioactive peptides. (9) The biological significance of NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  is to release active IL-1β and IL-18 into extracellular space through exocytosis.
  The secreted IL-1β will facilitate inflammation process in the tissue whereas IL-18
  will either promote caspase-3 dependent RPE apoptosis via MyD88 signaling or suppress
  neovascular vessels growth in the choroid capillaries.'
