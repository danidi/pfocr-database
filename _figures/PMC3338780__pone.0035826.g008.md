caption: In the basal cell state, cytoplasmic β-catenin levels are low due to rapid
  turnover mediated by the destruction complex (AXIN1, APC, CK1 and GSK3), where CK1
  and GSK3-mediated phosphorylation targets β-catenin for degradation. WNT binds to
  its cell surface receptors FRIZZLED and LRP6, inducing the clustering of WNT/FRIZZLED/LRP6
  into the multimeric complexes called signalosomes. In signalosomes, LRP6 becomes
  phosphorylated at PPPS/TP motifs, which allows for AXIN1 and GSK3 binding. Signalosomes
  also facilitate the amplification of the WNT signal, where initially phosphorylated
  LRP6 molecules serve as high affinity docking sites for GSK3 that, in turn, phosphorylates
  additional LRP6 molecules to create even more AXIN1/GSK3 binding sites. AXIN1/GSK3
  sequestration by LRP6 leads to dissolution of the destruction complex, allowing
  for β-catenin stabilization, its nuclear translocation, and activation of gene transcription
  dependent on TCF/LEF transcription factors. WNT-induced LRP6 phosphorylation requires
  signalosome assembly and therefore can only involve the mature, transmembrane LRP6.
  This contrasts with the ERK-mediated LRP6 phosphorylation, since ERK, activated
  by RTKs, is a cytosolic kinase than can phosphorylate both the mature (transmembrane)
  LRP6 and immature (intracellular) LRP6 during its Golgi-based membrane transport
  (gray arrow). In the absence of a signalosome, ERK-phosphorylated LRP6 may recruit
  a limited amount of AXIN1/GSK3 that is not sufficient to fully stabilize β-catenin.
  In the presence of WNT, however, LRP6 molecules pre-phosphorylated by ERK integrate
  into the newly formed signalosomes and help to amplify the WNT signal by providing
  more initial binding sites for AXIN1/GSK3. In addition to the ERK/LRP6 pathway,
  RTKs also directly phosphorylate β-catenin at Tyr142, possibly liberating β-catenin
  from its association with the cell membrane, and allowing for its transcriptional
  activation.
