caption: Osteocalcin signals through Gprc6a, a GPCR, in pancreatic β-cell and testis
  Leydig cell to carry out its endocrine functions. In Leydig cells, osteocalcin signaling
  stimulates the release of cAMP to activate CRED and thereby increases the expression
  of a set of key enzymes of testosterone biosynthetic pathway, such as StAR, Cyp11a,
  Cyp17, 3β-HSD, Cyp19, and HSD-17, to facilitate testosterone synthesis and spermatogenesis.
  In pancreatic β-cells, osteocalcin signaling increases the expression of Insulin
  and Cyclin D1 to promotes insulin synthesis and proliferation.
