caption: 'Simplified representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of grapevine
  leading to the three major classes of end products: flavonols, PAs, and anthocyanins.
  Note that the activity of FLS is required for the synthesis of flavonols, the activity
  of UFGT is required for the synthesis of anthocyanins, while the activities of ANR
  and LAR are specifically required for the synthesis of the precursors catechin and
  epicatechin of PA formation. ANR, Anthocyanidin reductase; 4CL, 4-coumaroyl-CoA
  synthase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; F3H, flavanone-3β-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid-3′,5′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; OMT, O-methyltransferase; PAL,
  Phe ammonia lyase; RT, rhamnosyl transferase; UFGT, UDP-Glc:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase;
  UGT, UDP-glycosyltransferase. Note that for simplification, flavonoids catalyzed
  by the enzymes DFR, LDOX, LAR, and ANR have been omitted; therefore, only the final
  products anthocyanins and PAs are shown.'
