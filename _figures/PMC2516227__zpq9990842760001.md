caption: Schematic of cholesterol synthesis and turnover in the brain showing selected
  pathway intermediates and inhibitors used in this study. Statins inhibit HMG CoA
  reductase early in the biosynthetic pathway, whereas FTI-277, GGTI-2133, and 3-PEHPC
  block the addition of isoprenyl groups to protein targets. The 24-hydroxylase turns
  over cholesterol by converting it to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, a membrane-permeable
  end-product. Synthesis of new cholesterol to replace that turned over ensures a
  constant flow of intermediates through the pathway, one of which, geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate or a derivative of this polyisoprenoid, is required for LTP. Apolipoprotein
  E (ApoE) facilitates the movement of cholesterol between different cell types, either
  as a component of lipoprotein particles or in the form of ApoE-cholesterol complexes.
