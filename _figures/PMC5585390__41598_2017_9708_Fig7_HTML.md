caption: A schematic model based on the present study for plant defense responses
  under salinity with or without 2,4-D application. Under saline stress conditions,
  Na+ passes through the cell membrane via nonselective cation channels (NSCC), induces
  membrane depolarization, which deactivate potassium (K+) inward rectifier channels
  (AKT) that limits plant growth by interfering with major physiological functions,
  disrupting ion homeostasis, diminishing nutrient uptake and produce excessive ROS
  and lipid peroxidation due to enhanced cellular Na+ level. 2,4-D application modulates
  the expression of cation transports proteins and antioxidant defense system to reduce
  ROS production and Na+  uptake in cell through the activation of the salt overly
  sensitive (SOS) signaling pathway and compartmentalization of sodium in vacuole
  by Na+/H+ exchangers (NHX).
