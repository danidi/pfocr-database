caption: 'Proposed anticancer mechanisms of itraconazole. Itraconazole can inhibit
  cholesterol trafficking and release from endosomes/lysosomes, leading to hyperaccumulation
  of cholesterols in those organelles. This is thought to interfere with the mTOR
  and angiogenesis pathways in endothelial cells. Itraconazole also inhibits smoothened
  activation in the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is known to be upregulated in
  lung cancer cells. Reproduced from [] with permission from the publisher.Abbreviations:
  LDL, low-density lipoprotein; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; VEGFR2, vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor 2; SMO, smoothened.'
