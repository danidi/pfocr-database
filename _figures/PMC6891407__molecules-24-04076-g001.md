caption: The diagram of the mogroside biosynthetic pathway. It was divided into upstream
  and downstream in this study. Acetyl-CoA is transformed into mogrol in the upstream
  by catalysis of HMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase), SQS (squalene
  synthase), SQE (squalene epoxidase), CDS (cucurbitadienol synthase), and CYP450
  (cytochrome P450). Mogrol can be converted into different grades of mogrosides by
  UDP-glycosyltransferases. CAS (cycloartenol synthase) could translate 2,3-Oxidosqualene
  in to cycloartenol, which is the beginning of the steroid biosynthetic pathway.
  EPH, epoxide hydrolase; UGT, UDP-glycosyltransferases.
