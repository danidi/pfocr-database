caption: Proposed model for the involvement of the EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway in autophagy
  response to AIEC infection in intestinal epithelial cells. Upon AIEC infection,
  the EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 signaling pathway is activated in host cells, inducing transcription
  of several autophagy genes including SQSTM1, MAP1LC3B, BECN1, ATG3 and ATG7 and
  thereby a functional autophagic response. This serves as a host defense mechanism
  to eliminate intracellular AIEC and to inhibit AIEC-induced intestinal inflammation.
