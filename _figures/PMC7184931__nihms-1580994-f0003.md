caption: cGAS-STING-IFN pathway activation in SLE. The exogenous cyclic GMP–AMP dinucleotide
  (2′3′cGAMP) released by bacteria or tumors is imported through the reduce folate
  career transporter SLC19A1 into the cell. cGAS binds to cytosolic DNA and results
  in endogenous cGAMP production. Both the exogenous and endogenous cGAMP binds to
  STING adapter protein and induces transcription of type 1 interferon, the major
  mediator in SLE pathogenesis. TREX 1, DNAse 1 mutations in humans, results in DNA
  accumulation and increased susceptibility to SLE like syndromes. SLC19A1 is a potential
  target to control SLE disease activity and existing drugs like folate, methotrexate,
  and sulfasalazine known to inhibit it in studies.
