caption: Possible mechanisms underlying the reinforcing and analgesic effects of alcohol
  exposure. (A) Acute alcohol exposure induces eOP release but inhibits Glu release
  from Gluergic neurons, resulting in suppression of GABAergic neurons. Downregulation
  of GABAergic neurons disinhibits DAergic neurons, resulting in an increase in DA
  release and ensuing reinforcement. Opioid exposure induces analgesia via cAMP/CREB
  signaling. (B) In addicted subjects consuming alcohol, OPergic, Gluergic and GABAergic
  neurons respond like the non-addicted subjects, but DAergic neurons and the analgesic
  pathway are less responsive. Cumulatively, addicted subjects drinking alcohol exhibited
  poor opioid-induced analgesia and euphoria. (C) Alcohol abstinence in addicted subjects
  result in hyperactivity of Gluergic but downregulation of GABAergic neurons, causing
  neuronal excitation and the withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol resumption restores opioid’s
  analgesic potency but to a lesser degree, but eOP release is restored.
