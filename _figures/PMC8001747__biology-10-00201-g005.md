caption: The pathway diagram of key drought-responsive metabolites from two cherry
  rootstocks. Solid arrows indicate direct reactions between metabolites. Dashed arrows
  indicate indirect reactions between metabolites. CCL and CSL represent control and
  drought treatment samples of CDR-1. GCL and GSL represent control and drought treatment
  samples of Gisela 5. Because the relative content of substances was detected by
  nontarget GC-MS, there are no units.
