caption: 'a. BBB ‘sealing’ effect and direct vasculoprotection: Beneficial cytoprotective
  activities of APC and its cytoprotective-selective variants involve direct effects
  on endothelial cells that require the cellular receptors EPCR and PAR-1 and EPCR-dependent
  PAR1-mediated cross-activation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1). Cross-activation
  of S1P1 activates Rac1 leading to Rac1-dependent stabilization of the cytoskeleton,
  which results in enhanced integrity of the endothelial membranes (right). APC also
  suppresses NF-kB-dependent transcriptional activation of MMP-9 which in turn blocks
  degradation of the BBB basement membrane, thereby preventing intracerebral bleeding
  (middle right). By controlling Nf-κB nuclear translocation, APC blocks expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby limiting neuroinflammation (middle left).
  By activating PAR-1 in a EPCR-dependent manner, APC suppresses the pro-apoptotic
  p53 transcription factor and p53-dependent transcription of Bax (not shown) and
  directly upregulates anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (not shown), which results in blockade
  of caspase-9 activation and controls the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (middle left).
  APC can also block the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and caspase-8 activation (left).
  b. Direct neuronal protection: APC and its cytoprotective cell signaling variants
  act through PAR-1 and PAR-3 to inhibit p53 activation in injured neurons resulting
  in blockade of caspase-9-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway (left) and caspase-8-dependent
  extrinsic apoptotic pathway (right). APC also blocks nuclear transport of the transcription
  factor, Sp1, through phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Sp1 resulting in transcriptional
  suppression of mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) expression in motor neurons in a mouse ALS model
  (middle). c. Anti-inflammatory activity: In SOD1 mutant mice, APC and its cell signaling
  variants downregulate mSOD1 expression though PAR-1 and the downstream mechanisms
  as noted in panel b. This suppresses microglia activation resulting in reduced number
  of activated microglia as well as blockade of inflammatory cytokine production from
  microglia (right). On the left is shown that APC blocks NF-κB activation in microglia
  providing another anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by a blockade of NF-kB-dependent
  transcriptional expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines as noted above
  in a. for endothelial cells.'
