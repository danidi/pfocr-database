caption: In one arm of the pathway, putrescine is synthesized from arginine via ornithine
  by the enzymes arginase (1) and ODC (2), the latter being the target for the trypanocidal
  agent DFMO. In the other arm of the pathway, methionine is converted into SAM (S-adenosylmethionine)
  and on to dcSAM by the activities of SAM synthetase (3) and SAMdc (4) respectively.
  SpSyn (5) then catalyses the formation of spermidine from putrescine and dcSAM.
  In trypanosomatids, spermidine is required for biosynthesis of the unique thiol
  trypanothione.
