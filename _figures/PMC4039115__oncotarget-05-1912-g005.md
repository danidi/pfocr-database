caption: Oncogenic stress or DNA damage may activate p53 leading to cell cycle arrest,
  senescense and/or apoptosis. This is mediated via its downstream effectors miR34A
  -B and -C, which in turn downregulate known DLBCL proto-oncogenes. Our data indicate
  that DLBCL cells with concomitant TP53 mutation and MIR34A methylation have a growth
  advantage compared to “single-hit” tumors, suggesting that in DLBCL miR-34A may
  also be upregulated independently of p53 by oncogenic stress, probably via the ERK/ELK
  pathway as suggested by Christoffersen et al [].
