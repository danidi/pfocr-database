caption: Metabolism of excess glucose through the AR polyol pathway induces ROS production,
  leading to ER stress, mitochondria damage, and RPE cell death. Inhibition of AR
  by BGG protects against these downstream effects. Furthermore, blockade of AR in
  RMG reduces the production of TNF-α, which could otherwise induce apoptosis of RPE
  through a paracrine mechanism.
