caption: Schematic representation of an immune synapse and downstream events. Signal
  1 is generated by T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide antigen presented
  on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs, e.g.
  dentritic cells) or tumour cells. Signal 2 is provided by co-regulatory (co-stimulatory
  or inhibitory) molecules interacting with their cognate ligands expressed on APCs.
  These co-regulatory molecules can be expressed constitutively in naive T-cells (e.g.
  CD28 and CD27) or induced by TCR engagement leading to expression at different time
  points of T-cell activation. Signal 3 is mostly provided by cytokines secreted by
  APCs or other immune cells including CD4 T-helper cells to help regulate the effector
  differentiation pathway. Successful activation of a naive CD8 T-cell allows survival
  and proliferation of the reactive clone, allowing their progeny to differentiate
  into cytotoxic T lymphocytes that kill tumour cells expressing the tumour associated
  antigen. Unsuccessful activation leads to anergy or deletion of the T-cell. Transient,
  abortive activation of T-cells leading to deletion or anergy may occur in the context
  of antigen presentation by immature (or insufficiently activated) dendritic cells.
  CD40/CD40L and 4-1BB/4-1BBL are known as bi-directional signalling molecules and
  ligand engagement activates intra-cellular signalling transduction pathways. Furthermore
  the receptors can also be expressed on the target cell and may play a part in therapy
  with mAb. LAG3, lymphocyte activation gene 3; TIM3, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin
