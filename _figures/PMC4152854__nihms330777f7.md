caption: 'Proposed model of SE-induced progenitor proliferation: Pilocarpine-induced
  SE triggers glutamate release, resulting in excitotoxicity, inflammation and reactive
  microgliosis in the SGZ. In reactive microglia CRE-dependent transcription is activated
  (see ), thus leading to the expression of IGF-1. IGF-1 stimulates MAPK pathway activation,
  which in turn stimulates progenitor proliferation at 2-days post SE. [Color figure
