caption: Schematic diagram of local molecular signaling and brain function after acupuncture
  treatment. The peripheral mechanism (right) and central mechanism (left) after acupuncture
  treatment are illustrated. Acupuncture-induced ERK1/2 activation acts as a triggering
  molecule that induces multiple signaling transduction around the acupoint. These
  local signals are received by the peripheral nerve ending and then transmitted to
  the afferent sensory nervous tract. The brain regions of Sol and Cg are mainly involved
  in acupuncture-mediated brain functional connectivity, and these brain regions are
  functionally connected with variable brain regions of SC, MC, HIP, Insul, HyTH,
  SN, and RMg. These central signals might activate the descending inhibitory pathway
  that provokes the acupuncture effect. The solid line is the mechanism of the findings
  in this study, and the dotted line is the potential prediction mechanism. Cg cingulate
  cortex, Insul insular cortex, HIP hippocampus, HYTH hypothalamus, MC motor cortex,
  PAG periaqueductal grey, RMg raphe magnus nucleus, SC somatosensory cortex, SN substantia
  nigra, Sol nucleus of solitary tract, ST striatum, TH thalamus.
