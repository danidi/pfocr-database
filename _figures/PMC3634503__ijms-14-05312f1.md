caption: The cold signaling pathway, which involves ICE1 and CBF3/DREB1A. ICE1 is
  a MYC-type transcription factor and binds to cis-elements in the promoter of CBF3/DREB1A
  to induce its expression. CBF3/DREB1A is an AP2-type transcription factor to regulate
  expression of COR (cold-regulated genes) and cold tolerance. Ubiquitylation of ICE1
  is mediated by HOS1, an ubiquitin E3 ligase for proteasome-dependent degradation.
  SIZ1, a SUMO E3 ligase, mediates sumoylation (SUMO conjugation) of ICE1, probably
  leading to blocking of ubiquitylation and stabilization of ICE1.
