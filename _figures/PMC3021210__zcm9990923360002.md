caption: Key airway signaling pathways induced by respiratory viruses. TLR3 is expressed
  in intracellular endosomes and recognizes viral ssRNAs, such as those of rhinovirus,
  RSV, and influenza virus. TLR3 activates IRF-3 via the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing
  adaptor (TRIF), resulting in IFN-β and IFN-λ1 production. TLR3 also activates IRF-7
  and NF-κB through MyD88 activation. Activation of NF-κB and IRF-7 leads to the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines and the production of IFN-α, -λ1, and -λ2/3, respectively.
  Other endosomal TLRs (TLR7/8 and TLR9) detect ssRNAs and dsRNAs, such as those of
  influenza virus and adenovirus. Both TLR7/8 and TLR9 signal through a MyD88-dependent
  pathway, leading to the activation of NF-κB and IRF-7. TLR4 is expressed on the
  cell surface and responds to the RSV fusion protein. TLR4 signals through MyD88
  to activate NF-κB and through TRIF to activate IRF-7. The two RNA helicases RIG-I
  and MDA5 detect viral replication products in the cytosol to activate IRF-3 via
  the adaptor protein IPS-1/MAVS/VISA/Cardif.
