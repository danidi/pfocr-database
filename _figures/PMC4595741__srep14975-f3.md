caption: Flux values marked in blue are the ones that were found to be same throughout
  the simulation under combined activity of Rubisco carboxylase and oxygenase. Similar
  to what we found under Rubisco carboxylase activity, same interlink was observed
  between chloroplastic GS and Mal-2OG transporter; chloroplastic ammonia transporter
  (x_am_tx) and chloroplastic Glu-Gln (the flux values increased due to photorespiration).
  In addition, the reactions of the peroxisome also were involved. (a) Fluxes through
  various transporters when flux through the chloroplastic ammonia transporter (ex_ammonia_tx)
  was set at 0 and 1 flux unit. (b) Fluxes through various transporters when flux
  through the chloroplastic ammonia transporter (ex_ammonia_tx) was set at 4 flux
  unit.
