  Regulatory System of Arabidopsis According to .The network nodes (ovals) represent
  genes and are differentiated by color into cryptochrome (yellow), phytochrome (light
  blue), clock genes (orange), light-dependent downstream genes (light green), and
  other relevant genes (gray). The edges (lines) represent inferred causal relationships
  in a spectrum between activation (red) and repression (blue). Edges corresponding
  to activation are additionally marked by terminating arrows, and inhibitory edges
  are marked by terminating blunt segments. Combinatorial regulation is indicated
  by edge junctions shown as filled squares or circles. A filled square attached to
  a line indicates where an edge starting from a regulatory node bifurcates to affect
  several downstream nodes. A filled circle attached to a line indicates the case
  when several upstream nodes regulate the same target node. Figure reproduced from
