caption: (A) The cN cross-talk signaling network model is composed of the β-adrenergic
  pathway (red background), the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway (blue background), and
  cross-talk between them (yellow background). Cross-talk is mediated by PDEs 1–5.
  In the regulation of cAMP- (B) and cGMP- (C) hydrolysis, cNs exert positive (green
  arrows) or negative (red arrows) regulation of PDE activities. In particular, PDE2
  hydrolysis rate of either cN is stimulated (green arrow) by low concentrations of
  the other cN but is suppressed (red arrow) if the concentrations are sufficiently
  high. To avoid crowding the figure, the hydrolysis reactions of cNs are omitted
  in (B) and (C), which would have been drawn as red arrows originating from each
  PDE to cAMP in (B) and cGMP in (C). Instead, hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP are respectively
  represented by ovals of faded red in (B) and faded blue in (C).
