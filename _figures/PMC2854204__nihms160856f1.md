caption: Multiple inputs regulate activity of the TOR/Raptor/Lst8 complex (TORC1)
  through redundant upstream signaling pathways. Interactions leading to activation
  of a downstream component are indicated by arrows; those that inhibit are indicated
  by a bar. The canonical Tsc1/Tsc2-dependent TOR pathway is indicated by the blue
  lines. Recently described Tsc1/Tsc2-independent signals are shown in red. Decreases
  in cellular energy level (ATP/AMP ratio) cause phosphorylation of Raptor by the
  AMP-dependent protein kinase, leading to 14-3-3 mediated inhibition of TORC1 [].
  In response to insulin and other growth factors, Akt phosphorylates and inactivates
  PRAS40 (not shown), an inhibitor of TORC1 [–]. Decreases in cellular oxygen levels
  lead to increased expression of hypoxia-induced genes, including Bnip3, which binds
  and inhibits the small GTPase Rheb [].
