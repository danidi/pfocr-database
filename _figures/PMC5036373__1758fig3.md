caption: Apoptotic signaling networks in hepatocyte lipotoxicity. Hepatocyte treatment
  with palmitate results in ligand-independent clustering and activation of the TRAIL-R2,
  causing caspase-dependent cell death. Active caspase 8 cleaves Bid into its truncated
  form (tBid), which translocates to mitochondria to promote release of proapoptotic
  factors, such as cytochrome c. Palmitate also induces ER stress, which upregulates
  proapoptotic PUMA and TRAIL-R2 via transcription factor CHOP. Increased levels of
  PUMA facilitate hepatocyte apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Palmitate has
  also been found to cause cellular depletion of miR-296-5p, a microRNA that, via
  complementary binding to the 3′-UTR of PUMA mRNA, causes its degradation. Loss of
  miR-296-5p during lipotoxicity removes this break on PUMA posttranscriptional regulation,
  thereby increasing cellular levels of PUMA. Finally, palmitate induces autophagic
  degradation of Keap1, resulting in JNK activation and PUMA upregulation. Along with
  other proapoptotic inputs, PUMA sensitizes the hepatocyte to Bax activation and
  MOMP culminating in cell death.
