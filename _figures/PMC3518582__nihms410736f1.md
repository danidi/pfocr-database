caption: The Wnt Signal Transduction Pathways. a A brief summary of the canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. When Wnt binds to a complex of the Fz and LRP co-receptors,
  that causes translocation of Axin and Dvl to the membrane to form a signalosome,
  along with concomitant dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex that includes
  Axin, APC, GSK3β and other proteins not included in this diagram. The outcome is
  to decrease GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, which otherwise targets
  β-catenin for proteasome-mediated degradation. In the absence of this degradation,
  β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus where it
  interacts with Lef/Tcf transcription factors to regulate target gene transcription.
  b The divergent canonical Wnt pathway. The same upstream events as the canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway that inhibit GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin
  also inhibit GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of microtubule associated proteins such
  as MAP1B, allowing for their regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangements and stability.
  c The Wnt/PCP pathway. Wnt-Fz binding leads to changes in the interaction and subcellular
  localization of several transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins. Through cellular
  and biochemical mechanisms that remain to be elucidated, this leads to activation
  of downstream mediators including JNK, RhoA, and Rac1, leading to dynamic alterations
  in actin and microtubule cytoskeletal components. This pathway is subject to down-regulation
  through Vangl-mediated recruitment of Prickle, a Dvl-binding protein that inhibits
  Fz-recruitment of Dvl. d The Wnt/Ca2+pathway. Wnt-Fz binding activates PLC in a
  Dvl-dependent manner leading to a transient increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels
  and activation of PKC and CaM-KII. PKC has multiple downstream intracellular effectors
  including transcriptional activators; CaMKII promotes nuclear import and activity
  of NFAT. e The FNI pathway. Wnt-Fz binding causes internalization, cleavage, and
  subsequent GRIP-dependent nuclear trafficking of Fz
