caption: Threonine synthesis pathway from aspartate in E. coli. The reactions are
  catalyzed by aspartate kinase (ThrA, MetL, LysC), aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  (Asd), homoserine dehydrogenase (ThrA), homoserine kinase (ThrB) and threonine synthase
  (ThrC). ASA aspartic β-semialdehyde, aspartyl-P β-aspartyl phosphate.
