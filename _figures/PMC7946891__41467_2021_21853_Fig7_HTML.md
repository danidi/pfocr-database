caption: Two types of acyltransferases distributed in distinct subcellular compartments
  are involved in the biosynthesis of chicoric acid. In the cytosol, the BAHDs including
  EpHTT and EpHQT use caffeoyl CoA from phenylpropanoid metabolism as an acyl donor
  to synthesize caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid, respectively. Both products are
  then transported into the vacuole. EpCAS, a specialized SCPL acyltransferase, uses
  chlorogenic acid as its acyl donor instead of 1-O-caffeoyl-β-D-glucose and transfers
  the caffeoyl group to caftaric acid to generate chicoric acid.
