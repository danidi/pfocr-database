caption: Proposed model of PBP2 inactivation-mediated L1 and L2 expression in S. maltophilia.
  Inactivation of mrdA results in the accumulation of GlcNAc-anhMurNAc tetrapeptide
  (M4N) in the periplasm. M4N is transported from the periplasm into the cytosol by
  the AmpN/AmpG permease system. The imported M4N is hydrolyzed into GlcNAc-anhMurNAC
  and free tetrapeptide by AmpDI, and the resulting products are further recycled
  into UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide, which is introduced into the PG monomer biosynthetic
  pathway. Once the AmpDI activity is saturated, surplus M4N is processed by NagZ,
  generating the AL, anhMurNAc tetrapeptide. The AL binds to the transcriptional regulator
  AmpR and converts AmpR into an activator for L1 and L2 expression.
