caption: Figure 3. Cytokinesis in plants is regulated by a distinct MAPK signaling
  pathway. (A) Schematic overview of all the components involved in the MAPK signaling
  cascade that mediates de novo cell plate formation in tobacco and Arabidopsis cells.
  Proteins with a proven function in male meiotic cytokinesis are underlined. Full
  black arrows represent phosphorylation steps, dotted arrows indicate for an indirect
  or not fully known regulatory pathway. Figure based on previously published network
  figures., (B) Putative model for the downstream regulatory cascade mediating MAPK-activated
  cell plate expansion in both “conventional” and PMC cytokinesis.
