caption: 'Synthesis and mechanisms of gaseous neurotransmitters in the relaxation
  of penile or other vascular tissues. Unbold fonts indicate evidence obtained in
  other vascular tissues rather than the penis. Dashed red lines indicate inhibition,
  whereas straight lines indicate activation. Endothelial cells (EC) are shown as
  pink boxes and smooth muscle cells (SMC) are shown as grey boxes. 1: CBS, CSE and
  MPST synthesize H2S from L-cysteine. (CBS, CSE and MPST are expressed in smooth
  muscle cells in the penis. MPST can be also expressed in the endothelium of some
  vascular tissues). 2: eNOS synthesizes NO from L-arginine. 3: CO is synthesized
  from hemine by constitutive (HO-2 and HO-3) and inducible (HO-1) haem oxygenases.
  4: Caveolin interacts and inactivates both eNOS and HO-1. 5: Hsp90 (HSP90) activates
  eNOS. 6: ROS decreases the availability of NO to act on sGC. 7: NO induces relaxation
  via inhibition of Rho-kinase (ROCK) signalling in the penile tissue. 8: H2S-induced
  relaxations are increased in CC precontracted with endothelin, indicating a possible
  involvement of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in H2S-induced erectile function. 9: Both NO
  and CO activate sGC to produce cGMP. CO-induced activation of sGC is lower than
  NO-induced activation of sGC. However, CO favours YC-1-induced haem-independent
  activation of sGC. 10: H2S inhibits cGMP breakdown by PDE-5. 11: H2S activates KATP
  and leads to membrane hyperpolarization, which decreases intracellular calcium level
  via KCa channels and consequently causes relaxation. 12: Testosterone induces relaxation
  by activating smooth muscle KATP channels in human CC strips. 13: NaHS treatment
  increases testosterone level in aging rats. 14: Testosterone causes an increase
  in H2S level. 15: NO activates large conductance KCa (KCa1.1 also known as BKCa)
  in horse penile resistance arteries. 16: PKG can cause relaxation through activation
  of MLCP and reduce Ca2+ sensitivity in the penis.'
