caption: Proposed model of iron-induced effects in gynecological cells. (a) FAC treatment
  leads to the activation of MAPK through which it mediates effects on LC3-II/autophagy
  in an ATG5/7-dependent, beclin-1/hVps34-independent, and Ras-independent manner.
  In addition, FAC modulates lysosome abundance in a Ras-independent pathway. Further,
  reduction of the cell death response was altered by U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK.
  (b) Ras-dependent changes in HO-1 were observed in T80 cells treated with FAC. HO-1
  overexpression leads to decreased cell survival in T80 cells. (c) In HEY cells,
  DFO (an iron chelating agent) leads to induction of apoptosis, whereas FAC induces
  a necrotic cell death response. Increased cell survival was observed upon cotreatment
  of FAC and DFO in HEY, TOV21G, and TOV112D cells
