caption: Schematic representation of the Hippo signaling pathway. In response to activation
  of upstream signaling, MST1/2 interacts with SAV1 and phosphorylates LATS1/2 and
  MOB1A/B. LATS1/2 in turn phosphorylates and inhibits YAP/TAZ by causing cytoplasmic
  retention and degradation. Unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocates into the nucleus
  and act as transcription coactivators by interacting with various transcription
  factors, resulting in cell survival, proliferation, hypertrophy, and changes in
  metabolism.
