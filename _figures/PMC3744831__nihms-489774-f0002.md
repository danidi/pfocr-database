caption: The DDR-adapted model in meiotic silencing. There are two DDR pathways that
  underlie mammalian meiosis. a Spo11-dependent DSBs accompany the ATM-dependent DDR
  pathway and lead to meiotic recombination. After DNA end resection at DSBs, ATR
  is also activated on the ssDNA region. b Asynapsis regions are recognized by the
  ATR-dependent pathway, but are independent of ATM. This DDR pathway is distinct
  from the DSBs-associated DDR pathway and leads to meiotic silencing. MDC1 directs
  γH2AX amplification and chromosome-wide spreading. c In somatic DDR, the pathway
  following DSBs is regulated by ATM and is associated with silencing, DSBs repair,
  and checkpoint activation. d In somatic DDR, the ATR-dependent pathway is activated
  following DNA replication stress at the stalled replication fork in the S phase.
  At the stalled replication fork, ssDNA is recognized by RPA and the ATR-TOPBP1 complex
  is activated. This pathway is associated with silencing, DNA repair, and activation
  of the replication checkpoint
