caption: 'Flowchart of MRI pathway including patient risk stratification, when to
  perform biopsy. On the left suggested pre- and post-MRI risk stratification (purple)
  and related actions (blue), on the right the flowchart with actions (ovals) and
  results (rectangles). Identification of low-risk (light gray boxes) and intermediate-/high-risk
  men (darker gray boxes). Pathway preference (continuous lines) and alternative routes
  (dashed lines) are combined. *This route is more theoretical: a man with a PI-RADS
  4 or 5 score at first diagnosis most likely will not be categorized in low risk,
  only after negative biopsies despite consistent PI-RADS 4 or 5 scores, as a results
  of MRI false positives. **This route with targeted and systematic biopsies can further
  be adapted to specific clinical scenarios. A man with a large PI-RADS 5 focus may
  already benefit from only MRI-directed targeted biopsy. A man with a small PI-RADS
  4 focus may benefit from only MRI-directed focal saturation biopsy, sampling the
  suspected region and its penumbra. PSA prostate-specific antigen, MRI magnetic resonance
