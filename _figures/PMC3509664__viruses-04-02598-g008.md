caption: PKR, ISG15 as modulators of IFN induction during HCV infection. HCV triggers
  associations of PKR with TRAF3 and MAVS early in infection. This involves the first
  DRBD of PKR but leaves PKR inactive as a kinase. The PKR/MAVS association leads
  to the activation of IRF3 and induction of VSIGs. Among these, ISG15 prevents the
  TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I and its association with MAVS, thus inhibiting
  the IFN induction pathway. Later in infection, PKR is activated as a kinase, phosphorylates
  eIF2α, with subsequent transient inhibition of the general translation including
  IFN and IFN-Stimulated Genes (ISGs) while the translation process of the HCV polyprotein
  proceeds unabated since it is eIF2α-independent.
