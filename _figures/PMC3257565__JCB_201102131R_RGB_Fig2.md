caption: HSC cell cycle entry is regulated by a complex network of cell-intrinsic
  and cell-extrinsic factors. The entry of quiescent HSCs from G0 into the G1 phase
  of the cell cycle is governed primarily via competing activating and inhibitory
  mechanisms that regulate the activity of cyclin–Cdk complexes. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, which is activated in response to numerous extrinsic signals, is considered
  a central activator of HSC cell cycle activity, primarily via activation of the
  cyclin D–Cdk4/6 complex. This pathway is heavily regulated, primarily by PTEN and
  TSC1/2. Moreover, the Ink4 CKI family inhibits cyclin D–Cdk4/6 activity, and CIP/KIP
  family CKIs are also capable of inhibiting Cdk4 activity. Progression from the G1
  to the S phase of the cell cycle is regulated by Cyclin E–Cdk2. This complex is
  regulated via the CIP/KIP family of Cdk inhibitors, as well as by the Rb family.
  Expression of CIP/KIP family members is in turn regulated by transcription factors
  such as Hes1, JunB, and FoxO3a, which are activated by extrinsic growth-repressive
  signals. Furthermore, HSC cell cycle activity is subject to regulation via p53,
  either in response to cellular damage or p19ARF activity. Solid arrows indicate
  direct activation/inhibition events, dashed arrows indicate transcriptional regulation
  events. Functionally related groups of cell cycle activators are shaded in green;
  functionally related groups of cell cycle inhibitors are shaded in red.
