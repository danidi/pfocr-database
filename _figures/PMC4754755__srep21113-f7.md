caption: (a) Under normal conditions, cells acquire adequate amounts of Fe2+ through
  cellular uptake via DMT1 and degradation of ferritin to maintain the labile iron
  pool (LIP). (b) However, Mn2+ overexposure competes with Fe2+ for uptake by DMT1.
  In addition, the accumulation Mn2+ in the cytoplasm disrupts LIP, resulting in enhanced
  autophagy to degrade ferritin for Fe2+ mobilization. Mn2+-mediated cellular iron
  depletion also results in the activation of JNK via the TRX-ASK1 pathway, leading
  to cell death.
