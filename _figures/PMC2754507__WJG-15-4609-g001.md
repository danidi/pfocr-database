caption: Hypothetical view of the pathogenic effects of IL-15 and IL-21 in celiac
  disease. In active celiac disease mucosa, IL-15 is produced by epithelial cells
  and antigen presenting cells (APC) in response to gluten stimulation. APC also produce
  interferon (IFN)-α, which stimulates CD4+ T cells to polarize along the Th1 pathway.
  IL-21 is produced by activated CD4+ T cells, including Th1 cells. IL-15 activates
  various pathways, which lead to the lysis and death of epithelial cells. IL-15 augments
  the production of granzyme B by IELs and IFN-γ by IELs and Th1 cells; enhances the
  expression of the activating NGK2D receptor on IELs; induces the NKG2D ligand, MICA,
  on epithelial cells. IL-21 seems to contribute to the tissue-damaging immune response
  in CD, given that this cytokine is able to enhance the production of perforin by
  IELs and IFN-γ by T cells, and to stimulate stromal cells to make extracellular
  matrix-degrading metalloproteinases.
