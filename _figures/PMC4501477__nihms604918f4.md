caption: Viral infection and viral gene products (shown outside the gray boxes) activate
  DDR signaling (shown within the gray boxes) directly or indirectly through induction
  of ROS and replication stress. Viral oncoproteins activate and are acted upon by
  damage kinases, as indicated by two-way arrows. Viruses act at every stage of the
  DDR pathway to disrupt signaling checkpoints and repair processes, as shown. Many
  of these have been shown to contribute to the process of cellular transformation
  (see the main text for details and references).
