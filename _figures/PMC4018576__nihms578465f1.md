caption: Five papers published in 2009 describe a role for HIF-1 as a longevity regulator
  in C. elegans. Three of these papers (Mehta et al, Muller et al, and Zhang et al.)
  define the hypoxic response as an important longevity-promoting pathway that is
  distinct from insulin-like signaling and dietary restriction. Three papers (Zhang
  et al., Chen et al., Bellier et al.) also identify a longevity-limiting role for
  HIF-1 (deletion increases life span), but differ on the downstream mechanism. Zhang
  et al. report that life span extension from loss of HIF-1 requires DAF-16, while
  Chen et al. report that life span extension from loss of HIF-1 is DAF-16-independent
  and acting through IRE-1. Bellier et al. do not address potential downstream mechanisms
  of life span modulation by HIF-1.
