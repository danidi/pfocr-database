caption: Model of polι function in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions. Different
  repair pathways the 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxo-G, abbreviated as OG) lesion undertakes
  within the cell. The polι associates with 8-oxo-G translesion DNA synthesis (TLS)
  during DNA replication and 8-oxo-G:A mismatch repair via a Base Excision Repair
  TLS-BER pathway. The modification at C8 (atom O8) and the addition of H at N7 are
  highlighted in a grey circles. The C1′-C1′ distance indicates the size of basepairs.
