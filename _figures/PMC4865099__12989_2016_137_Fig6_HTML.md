caption: The cluster analysis indicates a potential pathway for MWCNT-induced fibrosis
  based on two distinct phases. In summary of the results of the cluster analysis,
  a pathway can be constructed representing the two phases of the lung response to
  the MWCNT with relation to the disease models that share similar gene expression.
  The genes and GOs identified in the meta-analysis are organized into the events
  along the pathway where they are likely involved. Due to the lack of clustering,
  the response to nanoTiO2 and CB could not be similarly summarized
