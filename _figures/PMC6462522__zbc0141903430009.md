caption: BIN1 loss enables ATM activation by the nuclear protein E2F1. A, BIN1 is
  an E2F1 corepressor (), so BIN1 loss, one of the hallmarks of advanced cancers,
  constitutively activates E2F1. In contrast, BIN1+12A, an aberrant BIN1 splicing
  variant, does not physically bind E2F1, so it does not participate in BIN1-dependent
  E2F1/ATM regulation. In BIN1-deficient cancer cells, E2F1 stimulates ATM transcription
  and increases the amount of ATM homodimers (the latent form). In parallel, by physically
  interacting with NBS1 (which is not involved in E2F1-dependent transcriptional machinery),
  E2F1 retains MRE11A at DNA termini and facilitates the MRE11A/RAD50 binding in vivo
  even in the absence of DNA damage. Consequently, E2F1 facilitates the formation
  of the MRN DNA end-binding complex, thereby promoting ATM autophosphorylation in
  BIN1-deficient cancer cells. Accordingly, BIN1 loss constitutively promotes ATM-dependent
  γH2AX formation (thus, producing a pseudo-DSB signal) and then ATM-dependent MDC1
  phosphorylation, which is essential for activating the downstream DSB repair/cell
  survival signals (, ). We propose that late-stage cancer cells, which are frequently
  deficient in BIN1 expression, may develop cisplatin resistance through the E2F1/ATM-dependent
  pathway even before they are exposed to the DNA-damaging agent. B, loss of BIN1
  enables E2F1 to activate ATM, thereby provoking cisplatin resistance. In BIN1-deficient
  cancer cells (which creates the 1st deficit), it may be recommended to specifically
  inhibit ATM autophosphorylation (thus, causing the 2nd deficit) to establish new
  synthetic lethality that increases cisplatin sensitivity.
