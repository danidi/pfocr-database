caption: The potential pathway of MT2A involved in NF-κB signaling. MT2A mediated
  IκB-α up-regulation to suppress the NF-κB pathway activation. Ectopic expression
  of MT2A could induce upregulation of IκB-α in mRNA and protein levels, as well as
  down-regulation of p-IκB-α and cyclin D1expression. Moreover, MT2A could be one
  of the transcriptional factors to induce the activity of IκB-α promoter, which indicates
  that MT2A is the negative regulator in NF-κB signaling pathway.
