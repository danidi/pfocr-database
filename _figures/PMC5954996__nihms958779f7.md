caption: 'Collectively the data herein support a model whereby ETBF infection triggers
  a specific relay of cellular interactions initiated by the action of the single
  bacterial virulence protein, BFT, on CECs that results first in IL-17-producing
  mucosal immune cells that then turn to act on the CECs to initiate a NFκB-associated
  CEC immune response that directs distal colon myeloid mucosal infiltration key to
  ETBF tumor localization in the distal colon. ETBF orchestrated colon carcinogenesis
  occurs in the absence of IL-6 and IL-23. CEC Stat3 activation is a necessary, but
  not sufficient, complement to the actions of IL-17. Steps in this model include:
  1, ETBF produces BFT, a zinc-metalloprotease that induces E-cadherin cleavage that
  contributes to barrier permeability dysfunction as well as Wnt/βcatenin and NF-κB
  signaling pathway activation. 2, a diminished colonic mucosal barrier likely contributes
  to resident myeloid cells activation that contributes to the rapid onset ETBF IL-17
  signature characterized by the accumulation of Th17, γδT17 and ILC3. Further, dependent
  on redundant cytokines due to the BFT virulence protein of ETBF, Stat3 is highly
  activated in lamina propia ICs including lymphocytes and myeloid cells. 3, IL-17/IL-17R
  and BFT signaling pathways converge on CECs to activate a distal colon NF-κB cascade
  resulting in the production of a C-X-C chemokine distal colon mucosal gradient,
  including CXCL1 (homologous to human IL-8). 4, although the ETBF-altered colon barrier
  progressively recovers its integrity, ETBF persistence maintains IL-17 production
  and the chemokine gradient that promotes the accumulation of distal colon MDSCs,
  including high proportions of PMN-MDSC. 5, the oncogenic properties of BFT including
  BFT-induced CEC proliferation and DNA damage likely allow the rapid loss of the
  second Apc allele (loss of heterozygosity, LOH) and rapid promotion of microadenoma
  formation (; ). MDSC accumulation in the distal colon provides growth factors promoting
  adenoma growth.'
