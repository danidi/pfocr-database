caption: Ras-dependent versus Ras-independent extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) signaling. In peripheral T lymphocytes, two molecular complexes, both of which
  are capable of signaling to the Raf–MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)–ERK kinase cascade, compete
  for phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 binding. Association of PLC-γ1 with linker for activation
  of T cells (LAT) promotes canonical T cell receptor (TCR) signaling () and activation
  of the Raf–MEK–ERK kinase cascade via Ras. This pathway requires PLC-γ1 catalytic
  activity (red). By contrast, association of PLC-γ1 with the adapter B cell lymphocyte
  adaptor molecule of 32 kDa (Bam32) and the kinase p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1)
  causes dissociation of PAK1 dimers promoting PAK1 activation. PAK1 can then signal
  to the Raf–MEK–ERK kinase cascade by phosphorylating both Raf and MEK. In this alternative
  pathway, PLC-γ1 is catalytically inactive (blue) and instead acts as a scaffold
  to dissociate pre-existing PAK1 dimers. Normally, both pathways act together to
  promote ERK activation, as MEK1 phosphorylation on S298 (by PAK1) potently enhances
  its phosphorylation on S217/S221 by Raf. Changes in the balance between expression
  of the adapters LAT and Bam32 can sequester PLC-γ1 and alter the relative activities
  of these two pathways. These two PLC-γ1-dependent pathways are likely to be responsible
  for the majority of TCR-dependent ERK activation, although LAT–son of sevenless
  (Sos) and lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck)–protein kinase C (PKC)θ–Ras
  guanine nucleotide-releasing protein 1 (RasGRP1) pathways also contribute to TCR-dependent
  ERK signaling.
