caption: NRX-based and LAR-RPTP-based synaptic organizing complexes display contrasting
  Aβ sensitivity. AβOs exert a pathological influence on NRX-based synaptic organizing
  complexes. In contrast, LAR-RPTPs and their post-synaptic binding partners appear
  to be resistant to AβO-induced deleterious effects on synapses. AβOs bind to the
  HRD of β-NRXs as well as to the SS4 of NRX1/2. Furthermore, AβOs reduce the expression
  of β-NRXs on axon surface in an HRD-dependent but SS4-independent manner. However,
  the role of the NRX SS4 in Aβ synaptic pathology remains to be understood. In addition
  to NRXs, NLGN1 can interact with Aβ and act as an Aβ deposition stabilizer to accelerate
  Aβ oligomer formation and fibrillar aggregation. Although AβOs affect not only NRXs
  but also LRRTMs and NLGNs, we propose that AβO-mediated β-NRX surface reduction
  may account the most in Aβ-impaired synapse organization. As an additional role
  of LRRTMs in the Aβ pathway, LRRTM3 interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP)
  as well as β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and promotes amyloidogenic APP processing
  to enhance Aβ production. Thus, NRXs and their partners are highly linked with Aβ
  pathology, which may result in Aβ vulnerability of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease
  (AD). In contrast, AβOs do not interact with LAR-RPTPs or their postsynaptic partners
  including TrkC and Slitrks. Accordingly, LAR-RPTP-based complexes may contribute
  to making synapses more tolerant of Aβ pathology in AD. Solid lines indicate protein
  interactions.
