caption: Summary of the signaling pathways regulated by LCBs in S. cerevisiae. Heat
  stress is known to produce a transient increase in LCBs, which then activate Pkh1
  and Pkh2. In vitro, Pkh2 is more strongly stimulated by LCBs than is Pkh1 (), but
  the situation in vivo has not been analyzed directly by enzyme activity measurements.
  Studies in vitro suggest that LCBs can directly produce small increases in the activity
  of Ypk1, Ypk2, and Sch9 (indicated by dotted lines), whereas the stimulation of
  Pkc1 has not been examined (). Pkh1/2 phosphorylate Ypk1, Ypk2, Sch9, and Pkc1 in
  their activation loop (PDK1 site), but the proteins are not enzymatically active.
  To become active, they also need to be phosphorylated in a hydrophobic region (PDK2
  site) and in a turn motif in their C termini. Phosphorylation of these sites in
  Ypk2 is mediated by TORC2 (), and for Sch9 phosphorylation is mediated by TORC1
  (). Ypk1/2 and Pkc1 are shown working in parallel pathways to control cell wall
  integrity, but data also support an alternative pathway in which Ypk1/2 work upstream
  of Pkc1 (, ).
