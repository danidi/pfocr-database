caption: Environmental factors and associated regulatory elements that affect OTA
  biosynthesis through cluster-specific transcription factors.| Through various global
  transcription factors or specific pathways, related environmental cues affect the
  regulation of OTA gene clusters, which contain four highly conserved biosynthetic
  genes (pks, nrps, hal/chl, p450) and a cluster-specific, transcription factor gene
  (bZIP). bZIP plays a pivotal role in processing various environmental signals for
  a carbon source (CreA transcription factor and the carbon catabolite repression
  pathway), a nitrogen source (AreA transcription factor and the nitrogen catabolite
  repression pathway), light (Velvet complex proteins, VelB-VeA-LaeA, and the global
  regulator VosA), temperature and humidity, redox status (Yap transcription factor
  and ROS), and osmotic stress (the high osmolarity glycerol system). At the same
  time, there are also some examples where G protein pathways are partly involved
  in the perception of environmental cues, such as Gα(GanB) and PKA (PkaA) in A. nidulans
  and GPCR (NopA) in A. fumigatus. In this figure, the black solid arrows indicate
  connections verified in OTA-producing fungi; the gray solid arrows indicate connections
  that have been verified in other toxin-producting fungi, but not verified in OTA-producting
  fungi; and the gray dashed arrows indicate possible, yet unproven, connections.
