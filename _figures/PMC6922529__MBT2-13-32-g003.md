caption: The metabolism of glycerol in Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 involves a combination
  of special processing pathways coupled to both glycolytic and gluconeogenic routes.
  Reactions within the upstream central carbon metabolism in strain KT2440 affected
  by growth on glycerol as indicated by transcriptome and metabolic flux analyses
  are shown in this scheme. The biochemical network sketches the main pathways involved
  in carbon processing along with the enzymes catalysing the corresponding conversions.
  In some cases, reactions have been lumped to simplify the diagram (e.g. within the
  non‐oxidative pentose phosphate pathway), and only some isoforms of the corresponding
  enzymes are shown. Further metabolism of acetyl‐coenzyme A (acetyl‐CoA) is indicated
  by a wide shaded arrow. Glyceraldehyde‐3‐P (GA3P) is highlighted as a key node connecting
  the main metabolic blocks (indicated in the diagram as ‘initial processing steps’,
  ‘gluconeogenesis and anabolism’ and ‘catabolism’) active in glycerol‐grown cells.
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone‐P; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. The transcriptomic and fluxomic
  data used in this diagram have been gathered from Nikel et al. (), Nikel et al.
  () and Beckers et al. ().
