caption: SINE RNAs are robustly induced in response to MHV68 infection. Through both
  MAVS-dependent and independent mechanisms, they stimulate the activity of the IKKβ
  component of the NF-κB pathway. IKKβ is co-opted by the virus to promote phosphorylation
  of RelA/p65, blunting the NF-κB transcriptional response. Additionally, IKKβ phosphorylates
  RTA, thereby enhancing viral gene expression and replication.
