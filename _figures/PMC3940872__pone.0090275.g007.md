caption: IL-3 binding to the α/βc chains of the IL-3 receptor leads to activation
  of the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase by trans-phosphorylation. In turn,
  JAK2-mediated activation of the STAT5, MAPK and AKT pathways via phosphorylation
  (broad arrows) results in induced transcription of downstream target genes (thin
  arrows). We showed that α-Br-TMC inhibits JAK2 phosphorylation, hence impairing
  JAK2-regulated signaling pathways. In addition and independently of JAK2, α-Br-TMC
  inhibits STAT5 activity. Concomitantly, STAT5A and STAT5B protein mobility in SDS-PAGE
  is altered, indicating a change in their post-translational modification state induced
  by α-Br-TMC, which might be associated to STAT5 altered transcriptional activity.
