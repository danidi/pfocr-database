caption: Protein–protein interaction network of two-component systems (TCS) signaling
  pathway in Arabidopsis. Interactions confirmed both in in vitro and in vivo are
  indicated by a line, while interactions found only in the Y2H analysis are indicated
  by dashed lines. Shaded oval shapes represent proteins not studied.
