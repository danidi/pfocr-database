caption: Studies in D. discoideum and those subsequently validated in human cells
  have shown that altering the balance between ceramide and S-1-P by modulating the
  levels of sphingosine kinase, sphinginosine-1-phosphate lyase, or ceramide synthase
  has profound effects on the cytotoxic action of the anti-cancer drug cisplatin.
  Genetic or pharmacological (sphingosine kinase inhibitors) approaches that elevate
  ceramide or decrease S-1-P result in increased sensitivity to cisplatin and carboplatin.
  In contrast, decreasing ceramide or increasing S-1-P results in a loss of sensitivity
  (increased resistance) to cisplatin. Numbers in parentheses refer to published results.
