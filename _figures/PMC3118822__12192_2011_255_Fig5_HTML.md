caption: Schema flowchart illustrating the role of HSP90α in the mechanisms of cellular
  survival. HSP90α induction in response to environmental pollutant-mediated oxidative
  stress promotes the activation of its client proteins such as STATs of the JAK/STAT
  pathway, ERK1/2 of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, and Akt of the PI3K pathway. STATs
  upon activation during HSP90α induction favor survival after translocation to the
  nucleus. ERK1/2 and Akt activations under similar conditions promote cellular survival
  via their downstream effectors like Elk-1 activations and Bcl-2 upregulation, respectively.
  Activation of NF-κB by both the survival kinases also provides anti-apoptotic effect
  facilitating cellular survival. HSP90α-mediated Akt activation at the same time
  also acts to downregulate ASK1 allowing inhibition of ASK1-mediated JNK1/2 apoptotic
  signaling. Thus, HSP90α by modulating a series of signaling cascades protects against
  apoptosis and promotes hepatocyte survival
