caption: A model illustrating the role of the endocannabinoid system within the BLA
  in integrating the effects of glucocorticoids and the norepinephrine and CRF systems
  on memory consolidation. Corticosterone (CORT) is released during emotionally arousing
  events and binds to a membrane-bound GR, which activates the intracellular cAMP/PKA
  signaling pathway to induce endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis. Endocannabinoids are
  then released into the synapse where they bind to CB1 receptors on GABAergic terminals
  and thereby inhibit the release of GABA. This suppression of GABA release subsequently
  disinhibits norepinephrine (NE) release, and increases the excitability of BLA pyramidal
  neurons, rendering them more sensitive to the effects of norepinephrine and CRF.
  Together, these effects will result in an increased activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway
  and phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein. These stress
  hormone effects in the BLA are required for enhancing memory consolidation of emotionally
  arousing experiences.
