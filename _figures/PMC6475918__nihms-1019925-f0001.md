caption: (A) DRP1 re-localizes from the cytosol to the OMM by binding to a docking
  protein, MFF. Once at the OMM, DRP1 associates with Zip1, which promotes the entry
  of Zn2+ into the matrix via a MCU-dependent manner. The mechanism by which DRP1
  activates Zip1 to stimulate MCU activity remains unclear. There are two proposed
  outcomes from this pathway (B and C).(B) Upon Zn2+ entry into mitochondria, components
  of the electron transport chain are inhibited, resulting in decreased ΔΨM. Normal
  mitochondrial function (e.g., responsive changes to nuclear-mitochondrial signaling
  to re-establish ΔΨM) allows for the rapid recovery of ΔΨM and protection against
  mitophagy.(C) Alternatively, Zn2+-induced inhibition of ΔΨM is not repaired, and
  the mitochondrion is destined for mitophagy. This mechanism may identify distinct
  organelles or regions of the mitochondrial network that fail to recover from bioenergetic
  stress due to aberrations in mitochondrial gene expression, coordinated nuclear-mitochondrial
  signaling, or compromised electron transport chain assembly.
