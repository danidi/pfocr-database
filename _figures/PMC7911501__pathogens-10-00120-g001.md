caption: TLRs are involved in regulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-induced
  production of proinflammatory cytokines. Stimulation with MTB [], lipoarabinomannan
  [] or 19 kDa lipoprotein from MTB [] causes formation of TLR1/TLR2 heterodimer [,],
  inducing clustering of lipid rafts through interaction with protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ)
  and subsequent ROS formation []. Accumulation of ROS activates mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) [,], which promotes expression and secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines via activation of NF-κB signaling pathway [,,]. The class A scavenger
  receptor macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) tethers trehalose
  6,6’-dimycolate (TDM/cord factor) that is the predominant cell wall glycolipid of
  MTB to the macrophages to activate TLR2 []. Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) negatively
  regulates TLR2- and TLR4-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines []. MTB
  stimulation activates TLR4 [,], which facilitates NF-κB-dependent production of
  proinflammatory cytokines []. TLR4 expression is negatively controlled by some microRNAs,
  including MiR-21-5p [], MiR-708-5p [] and MiR-1178 []. TLR9 cooperates with TLR2
  to promote generation of proinflammatory cytokines [].
