number: Fig. 2
caption: This figure outlines the role of KLF10 protein as a target and as a regulator
  of the TGFβ-Smad 2,3 signaling pathway. TGFβ binds to its membrane receptors (R2
  R1) to activate the Smad signaling pathway. KLF10 (TIEG) is one of the rapid, early
  response genes whose expression is activated. KLF10 mRNA is rapidly translated into
  the KLF10 protein, which as a gene transcription repressor inhibits Smad 7 gene
  expression and, as a gene activator, induces Smad 2 gene expression. The ultimate
  outcome is a continued activation of the TGFβ-Smad signaling pathway, that is, an
  extension of the signaling period. The KLF10 mRNA and protein are rapidly turned
  over, thus the signaling is fine tuned to the KLF10 levels and activity. The steroid,
  estrogen (E), also induces the expression of KLF10 gene transcription, which is
  one mechanism of the well documented crosstalk between TGFβ and estrogen signaling.
