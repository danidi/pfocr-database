caption: 'The inflammasome and the complement system can be activated via so-called
  danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPS). Activation of the classical, the lectin, and the alternative pathway of
  complement activation all result in the activation of complement C3. The alternative
  pathway functions as an amplification route for all pathways of complement activation.
  Activation of C3 leads to the generation of C3a and the activation of the terminal
  effector pathway. Activation of the NOD-like receptor family Pyrin domains-containing
  protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome includes the formation of a cytosolic multiprotein
  complex that activates caspase 1. Caspase 1 cleaves pro-interleukin (IL)-1β into
  IL-1β. Pharmacological compounds that are used to dampen the effects of inflammasome
  activation primarily act at the level of IL-1β. In the dotted squares, we have indicated
  some selected drugs that are already used to target complement and/or inflammasome
  activation in other diseases. Compstatin inhibits complement activation by binding
  C3 and interfering with convertase formation and C3 cleavage ; eculizumab binds
  to complement protein C5, thus inhibiting the formation of C5a and the terminal
  complement complex C5b-9 . Canakinumab (a neutralizing monoclonal anti-IL-1β), anakinra
  (an IL-1 receptor antagonist), and rilonacept (a soluble decoy IL-1 receptor) all
  block the IL-1β effector pathways of inflammasome activation . The intermittent
  lines indicate the emerging link between activated complement and the NLRP3 inflammasome
  . Abbreviations: ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD.'
