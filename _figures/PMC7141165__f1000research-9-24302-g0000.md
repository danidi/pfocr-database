caption: 'Mycobacteria are recognized and phagocytosed, leading to IL-12 (p40/p35)
  secretion by macrophages. Binding of IL-12 to its receptor on the surface of T H1
  (or NK) cells activates the downstream JAK2 and TYK2 signaling cascade, resulting
  in STAT4 phosphorylation and dimerization. STAT4 homodimers translocate to the nucleus
  and induce the transcription of IFN-γ. Phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers translocate
  to the nucleus, resulting in the transcription of host defense genes. Similarly,
  IL-23 comprising the p40 and p19 subunits binds to the IL-23 receptor, leading to
  JAK2/TYK2 activation and STAT3 phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation,
  where it associates with IRF4 and RORγt in the transcription of IL17- , IL21- ,
  and IL22-related genes. The membrane-bound gp91 phox and p22 phox heterodimer (cytochrome
  b558) is stabilized by the transmembrane chaperone protein EROS. The remaining cytosolic
  components, p67 phox, p47 phox, and p40 phox, along with RAC2-GTP, associate to
  form the activated NADPH complex. Secondary signal from CD40/CD40L signaling activates
  the NF-κB pathway. GATA2, GATA binding factor 2; gp, glycoprotein; IFN, interferon;
