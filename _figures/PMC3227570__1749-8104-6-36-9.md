caption: Model of divergent BMP signaling pathways controlling transcriptional and
  cytoskeletal responses. The distinct responses of dI neurons to BMP7 (neural induction
  and axon orientation) occur through independent pathways. The neural specification
  pathway, activated by both BMP7 and BMP6, at 'high' concentrations, leads to stimulation
  of the Smad cascade and induction of target genes. This signaling pathway requires
  the kinase activity of type I BMP receptors but appears not to depend on specific
  type II BMP receptors. The chemotropic response of dI neurons, axon orientation
  and growth cone collapse, is evoked by BMP7 but not BMP6, is activated at low concentrations
  of agonist and is not dependent on type I BMP receptor activity. Rather, this path
  involves PI3K-dependent signaling mechanisms and may be initiated through recruitment
  of a specific type II receptor pair selectively by BMP7.
