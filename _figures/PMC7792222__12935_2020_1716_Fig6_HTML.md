caption: miRNA-mediated regulation of BCSCs via targeting the STAT3 signaling pathway.
  a STAT3 has six functional domains and two phosphorylation sites, as indicated.
  b STAT3 is mainly activated by Tyr705 phosphorylation within the SH2 domain, which
  leads to its dimerization. Activated STAT3 dimers interact with importins, translocate
  into the nucleus and activate target gene transcription by binding to the GAS motif
  of target genes. The immediate targets of miRNAs are marked
