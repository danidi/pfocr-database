caption: SUMO as a regulator of PCNA ubiquitylation and repair pathway choice. (1)
  SUMOylation on K164 by Siz1 or K127 by Siz2 mediates interaction with Rad18 through
  Rad18 SIM, thus switching to the ubiquitin modification upon DNA damage. (2) SUMOylation
  of PCNA also serves to recruit Srs2, leading to inhibition of Polδ/η limiting D-loop
  extension and crossovers. (3) SUMOylation of PCNA also facilitates its interaction
  with Elg1 alternative clamp loader, to unload PCNA from DNA upon completion of DNA
  synthesis. (4) K63 linked poly-ubiquitylation on K164 is mediated by Mms2-Ubc13/Rad5
  and requires the prior mono-ubiquitylation by Rad6/Rad18. It results in template
  switching through either fork regression or SCJs. (5) Ubiquitylation of K164 of
  PCNA is mediated by Rad6/Rad18 and leads to translesion synthesis by recruiting
  TLS polymerases to the damage site.
