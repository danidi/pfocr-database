caption: Schematic illustration of a working model for the TGF-β1/SMAD/Snail pathway
  in modulation of EMT-dependent fibrosis in SGEC. TGF-β1 stimulates epithelial cells
  by binding and activating transmembrane kinase receptors leading to phosphorylation
  and activation of Smad2/3. Once activated, pSmad2/3 form heterocomplexes with Smad4,
  which collectively translocate to the nucleus to mediate signaling events linked
  to EMT activation. The activation of the transcription factor Snail and induction
  of EMT markers have, as consequence, the upregulation of the mesenchymal marker
  Vimentin and the downregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. During the
  activated EMT program, SGEC exhibit dramatic morphological changes and the gain
  of mesenchymal properties including increased migratory capacity and contractility.
  Finally, these mesenchymal cells become myofibroblasts which are responsible for
  progressive SG fibrosis.
