caption: 'A) Anthracycline-induced generation of ROS is a central mediator of: 1)
  accelerated myofilament apoptosis via upregulation of p53 pathway, 2) suppression
  of myofilament protein synthesis via inhibition of CPCs and GATA-4, 3) alterations
  in cardiac energy metabolism via downregulation of AMPK, 4) ultrastructural changes
  to myocytes via calcium overload. These changes lead to myocardial and vascular
  dysfunction. B) Radiation-induced vascular injury occurs via downregulation of endothelial
  cell-specific p53/activation of nuclear transcription factor NF-κB, which ultimately
  up-regulates matrix metalloproteinases, adhesion molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  while inactivating vasculoprotective nitric oxide. Eventually, coronary vascular
  injury characterized by endothelial cell proliferation, intimal thickening, medial
  scarring, lipid deposits and adventitial fibrosis may occur. ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; mitogen activated protein kinases, MAPK; cardiac progenitor cells, CPCs;
  AMP-activated protein kinase, AMPK.'
