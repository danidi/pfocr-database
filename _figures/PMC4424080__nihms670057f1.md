caption: Viruses can enter most cells through the endocytic pathway or by crossing
  the plasma membrane. TLRs detect viral genomes in endosomes. Once in the cytoplasm,
  genomic viral RNA (vRNA) can be detected by the RLRs and activate type-I IFN through
  MAVS, located on mitochondria and ER membranes. Genomic viral DNA (vDNA) is detected
  in the cytoplasm by cGAS or in the nucleus by IFI16. Both sensors activate STING
  to induce type-I IFNs. cGAS and RLRs can also detect viral replication intermediates
  in viral factories. All pathways activate the IRF and NF-kB transcription factors
  to stimulate IFNB transcription.
