caption: RAD51-mediated RF reversal (A) and an overview of replication fork restart
  mechanisms (B). (A) At stalled replication forks, ssDNA tracks are protected and
  coated with RPA. The DNA recombinase RAD51 replaces RPA and binds to DNA, contributing
  to the remodeling of the stalled fork into a reversed fork (4-way) structure. Besides
  RAD51, there are other replication fork remodelers, mentioned in the main text,
  but for simplicity only RAD51 is represented in this figure. (B) PARP1-mediated
  suppression of RECQ1 helicase is an important regulator of a premature restart of
  reversed forks (upper panel). Because of the least amount of processing involved,
  RECQ1-mediated pathway represents the first-choice restart mechanism of reversed
  forks. DNA2/WRN-driven restart involves regulated processing of the regressed arms
  and uses HDR to resolve the replication intermediate (middle panel). Reversed forks
  that could not be restarted in S phase are processed by MUS81 endonuclease later
  in mitosis and DSB break is formed in the process. The collapsed fork is then rescued
  by POLD3-driven D-loop formation and synthesis re-initiation (lower panel). PCNA,
  proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RPA, replication protein A.
