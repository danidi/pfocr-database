  non-amyloidogenic pathway which digests with α-secretase followed γ-secretase and
  takes place at the plasma membrane (PM). APP can be endocytosed back to endosomes
  or sent directly there from the trans-golgi network (TGN), either of which begins
  the amyloidogenic pathway via β-secretase and then γ-secretase cleavage leading
  to Aβ production. Once in extracellular space Aβ can form the plaques and deleterious
  Aβ pores or be cleared via ApoE binding to shuttle across the blood-brain barrier,
  proteolytically digested, or removed by the innate immune response. Macromolecules
  and molecular pathways which increase and decrease Aβ are shown in red and green
  respectively. AICD: Activiation-induced cell death; Apoε: apolipoprotein ε; ER:
