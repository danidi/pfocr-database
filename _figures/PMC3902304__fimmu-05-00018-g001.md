caption: The TWEAK/Fn14 signaling cascade. TWEAK cytokine is initially synthesized
  as membrane-anchored protein (mTWEAK). mTWEAK is then cleaved by furin into soluble
  form of TWEAK (sTWEAK). Binding of trimeric mTWEAK or sTWEAK to Fn14 receptor leads
  to the recruitment of cIAPs and various TRAFs resulting in the activation of multiple
  downstream signaling cascades. TWEAK stimulates canonical NF-κB pathway through
  activation of TAK1 and IKKβ and phosphorylation and degradation of IκB protein.
  TWEAK activates non-canonical NF-κB pathway through activation of NIK and IKKα leading
  to proteolytic processing of p100 protein into p52. TWEAK-mediated signaling also
  causes the activation of various MKKs, which phosphorylate ERK1/2, ERK5, JNK, and
  p38MAPK resulting in the activation of downstream transcription factors such as
  AP1 and SP1. TWEAK, TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis; Fn14, fibroblast growth
  factor inducible 14; cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated
  factor; TAK1, transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1, TAB, TAK1 binding
  protein; IKK, IκB kinase β; IκB, inhibitor of nuclear factor of kappa B; NIK, NF-κB-inducing
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKKs, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulating kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; AP1, activator protein 1; SP1, specificity protein 1.
