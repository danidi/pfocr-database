caption: Indoximod mechanisms of action. Tryptophan catabolism proceeds through pathways
  leading to serotonin or NAD production, the latter through the kynurenine pathway
  which handles ~95% of Trp catabolism in mammals. Indoximod is a Trp mimetic which
  mTORC1 interprets as L-Trp under conditions of high Trp catabolism and autophagy.
  Thus, the drug acts to block the suppressive signal on mTORC1 function generated
  by IDO/TDO activity. Other suggested mechanisms of action include an indirect suppression
  of IDO2 activity; a modulation of kynurenine-regulated AHR function, which may also
  influence feedback on IDO1 expression and activity; and an influence on gut microbial
  physiology influencing systemic immunity (see the text).
