caption: Transcript levels of DoC5-MTase and DodMTase genes, as well as the genes
  involved in the biosynthesis of WSPs, at different developmental stages. a The expression
  patterns of DoC5-MTase and DodMTase genes during different developmental stages.

  of genes involved in the biosynthesis of WSPs during different developmental stages.
  The three developmental stages are protocorm-like bodies (S1), shoots (S2) and plantlets
  (derived from protocorm-like bodies, S3), which were collected at 2, 4 and 10 months
  after germination, respectively. The heat map was generated by log2 transformation
  of the average of the expression values of D. officinale DoC5-MTase and DodMTase
  genes during different developmental stages. Blue and red in the color scale indicate
  low and high transcript expression, respectively. In C, error bars indicate the
  mean ± SD (standard deviation) of three individual experiments, and were quantified
  with three independent replicates. Different lowercase letters above bars indicate
  a significant difference among different stages at p < 0.05 based on Duncan’s multiple
  range test. CSLA, cellulose synthase-like A; Fru, fructose; Gal, galactose; Glc,

    a The expression patterns of DoC5-MTase and DodMTase genes during different developmental
    stages. b Proposed biosynthetic pathway of WSPs in D. officinale. c The expression
    patterns of genes involved in the biosynthesis of WSPs during different developmental
    stages. The three developmental stages are protocorm-like bodies (S1), shoots
