caption: '(A) Diagram of yeast de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis shown is derived
  from (). Enzymes are in ovals. Metabolites are in boxes. Increased color intensity
  indicates level of metabolite increase in response TORC2-Ypk1 activation. TORC2-Ypk1
  signaling globally activates de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis via derepression
  of the SPT complex (; ; ), potentially increasing levels of all metabolites. However,
  Ypk1 also upregulates ceramide synthesis via phosphorylation of Lac1 and Lag1, thus
  primarily directing this increased flux towards ceramides and away from LCBs and
  LCBPs. (B) In the absence of Ypk1 mediated ceramide biosynthesis regulation, increased
  sphingolipid flux raises LCB and LCBP levels. This slows cell growth by activating
  autophagy. Thus, TORC2-Ypk1 signaling not only activates sphingolipid biosynthesis
  in response to stress, but also insulates this flux towards ceramides to prevent
  metabolite mediated crosstalk to the autophagy machinery.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03779.011'
