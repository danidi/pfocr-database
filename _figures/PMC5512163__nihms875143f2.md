caption: Panel A shows that papillary thyroid carcinomas have mutually exclusive activating
  mutations in BRAF, RAS, and RTK. The photomicrographs show hematoxylin and eosin–stained
  slides of the indicated variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Mutant RTKs, RAS,
  and BRAF activate mitogen−activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling but do so to
  different degrees. The symbol > indicates more frequent than. The signaling output
  driven by BRAF V600E is highest, because this oncoprotein signals as a monomer and
  is unresponsive to the negative−feedback effects of activated ERK on upstream inputs
  into the pathway.– By contrast, the MAPK−signaling flux that is evoked by fusion
  RTK proteins or by mutated RAS is dampened by negative feedback. The expression
  of genes that is required for iodide uptake and metabolism, which are hallmarks
  of the differentiated state of thyroid follicular cells, is inhibited by MAPK signaling.
  This is consequential, because responsiveness to radioiodine therapy requires preservation
  of thyroid−differentiated function. The weight of the lines and arrows indicates
  the magnitude of the flux through the MAPK pathway and the transcriptional activities,
  respectively. The term mTOR denotes mammalian target of rapamycin, and PI3K phosphatidylinositol
  3−kinase. Panel B (left side) shows that the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib
  decreases extracellular signal−regulated kinase (ERK) activation and restores expression
  of the sodium iodide transporter (NIS) and other thyroid differentiation genes in
  mice with Braf V600E–driven papillary thyroid carcinoma. The insets on the right
  side of Panel B are fused iodine−124 positron−emission tomographic–computed tomographic
  images showing the restoration of iodine−124 uptake with selumetinib treatment in
  a patient with radioiodine−refractory lung metastases of thyroid cancer. Adapted,
