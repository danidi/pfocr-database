caption: 'Proposed c-Kit–IR interplay within the β-cell. (A) Transient receptor activation:
  c-Kit and IR both promote PI3K/Akt intracellular signaling, which leads to maintained
  insulin secretion. c-Kit receptor activation is proposed to promote upregulated
  IR/IRS signaling (via phosphorylation of tyrosine resides, green) through (i) direct
  activation and (ii) indirect activation through insulin secretion. Phosphorylation
  of IRS-1 tyrosine 608 in rodents and 612 in humans is linked to PI3K binding ().
  (B) Chronic receptor activation: Sustained signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway
  can lead to negative feedback through IRS-1 phosphorylation of serine residues (red)
  and impair insulin release. Multiple serine sites (e.g., Ser612) have been reported
  as phosphorylation targets from PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K1 signaling [for an extensive review,
  please see Copps and White ()].'
