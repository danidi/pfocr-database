caption: Markers of Coenzyme Q10 synthesis and Function. Elevation of organic acids
  in urine can reveal inhibition of the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway (A) or interruptions
  of the electron transport system (B) from inability to sustain adequate CoQ10 levels
  in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Both endogenous regulators, such as glucagon
  and statin drugs, act at the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme gateway to inhibit two-carbon
  unit entry into the pathway that leads to synthesis of cholesterol and CoQ10. Accumulation
  of intermediates of the citric acid cycle, on the other hand, signals a functional
  insufficiency of inner mito-chondrial membrane CoQ10 to sustain the flow of electrons.
