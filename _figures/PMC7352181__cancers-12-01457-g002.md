caption: Angiotensin-associated pathways associated with cell proliferation, invasion,
  and migration in lung tumor microenvironment. Membrane-bound and soluble ACE and
  ACE2 catalyze the production of angiotensin II or angiotensin (1,7), ligands that
  exert regulatory functions in tumor microenvironment cells. The effects of activating
  Ang II/AT1R, Ang II/AT2R and Ang (1,7)/MasR axes’ signaling has been mostly studied
  in tumor cells, including lung cancer cells. Overall, in contrast to the Ang II/AT1R
  that mediates several pathological events associated with activated RAS, the Ang
  (1,7)/MasR and Ang II/AT2R pathways are thought to antagonize many of the cellular
  actions of the Ang II-AT1R axis. In cancer cells, upon binding of Ang II to AT1R,
  a pleiotropic downstream signaling cascade is triggered, ultimately causing, either
  directly or indirectly, upregulation of cell proliferation, survival, motility,
  migration, invasion and EMT. Activated AT1R subunits stimulate PLCβ, that hydrolyses
  membrane lipids, activates PKC and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, while free
  Gβ and Gγ subunits bind and gate ion channels. Activated Gαq/11 units also activate
  the JAK-SHP2/STAT pathway and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) transactivation. Activation
  of RTK, depicted in the figure as EGFR, occurs through second messenger’s stimulation
  of ADAM family and MMPs to cleave its ligands (in the figure EGF and TGFα) that
  bind and activate RTK. Alternatively, the AT1R-mediated activation of MMPs can follow
  a PLCβ/DAG/PKC/c-SRC signaling mechanism to elicit increased ligands for RTK. Subsequent
  signaling upon activation of EGFR is represented in the figure using dashed arrows.
  Other intracellular cascades mediated by Ang II/AT1R include the activation of CXCR4/SDF-1
  signaling through FAK/RhoA/ROCK1-2/MLC increasing cell contraction, migratory potential
  and tumor invasion. The Ang (1,7)/MasR activation inhibits NFAT transcriptional
  regulation that reduces proliferation. Notably, this pathway blocks the NF-kB molecule
  formation thereby impacting EMT (including Snail1-mediated), invasion and survival.
  In addition, the inhibitory effect over ERK1/2 and NAPH oxidase signaling pathways
  significantly impact cell proliferation. The Ang II/AT2R pathway signals are mediated
  through protein phosphatases PTP1B, PTP and PP2A. The inhibition of CAV-1 phosphorylation
  stops the Rab5/Rac1/GTP migratory potential of malignant cells, thus suppressing
  invasion. Furthermore, AT2R-associated increase in PTP and PP2A exerts blocking
  effects in RTK-mediated signals of the RAS/RAF/MEK1-2/ERK1-2 pathway at the level
  of MERK1/2 and RAS molecules, reducing cell proliferation. Macrophages, endothelial
  cells and fibroblasts are important components of the tumor microenvironment and
  capable of generating and expressing RAS components. These cells, beyond their functional
  ligands and receptors that are altered in tumor microenvironment, and reflect the
  crosstalk between all cell constituents, also use the RAS signaling pathway (mostly
  AT1R, but also MasR in endothelial cells) to yield functional characteristics that
  ultimately may favor the cell itself and enhance tumor growth. BIRC5, surviving
