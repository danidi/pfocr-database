caption: Illustration of the effects of Sal B on hepatocyte differentiation from human
  ESC. Under the culture conditions with HGF and FGF4, the Wnt signaling pathway was
  activated to regulate hepatocyte differentiation from human ESC. Free β-catenin
  after dephosphorylation was translocated into the nucleus where β-catenin binds
  to LEF1/TCF3 to trigger the expressions of the downstream genes, including those
  that promote hepatocyte differentiation, c-Myc and cyclin D1, which facilitate cell
  proliferation, as well as Numb, which acts as a negative regulator of the Notch
  signaling pathway to inhibit cholangiocyte differentiation, is also upregulated.
  Thus, Sal B treatment upregulates the Wnt signaling pathway (red arrow) to enhance
  hepatocyte differentiation and downregulates the Notch signaling pathway to inhibit
  cholangiocyte differentiation (red T).
