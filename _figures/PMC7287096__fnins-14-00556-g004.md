caption: 'Schematics of EGFR degradation and recycling assays. Left: Under conditions
  of high ligand concentrations, fluorescent EGF is internalized by endocytosis and
  sorted to lysosomes for degradation. EGFR surface availability can be assessed upon
  binding of Alexa555-EGF to cells at 4°C (t = 0 min), and endocytic trafficking and
  degradation can be followed by quantification of endocytosed fluorescent EGF over
  time (t = 10 min and t = 30 min). Right: under conditions of low ligand concentrations,
  the EGFR is endocytosed and recycled to the cell surface using either a fast recycling
  pathway dependent on Rab4, or a slow recycling pathway via the ERC and dependent
  on Rab8a. Non-fluorescent EGF is bound to cells at 4°C, cells are shifted to 37°C
  to allow for EGFR internalization (pulse), followed by a chase for various time
  points to assess recycling rates back to the cell surface (chase). Reappearance
  of the EGFR at the cell surface is detected using an antibody against the extracellular
  domain of the EGFR (yellow) in the absence of cell permeabilization. SE, sorting
  endosome; LE/MVB, late endosome/multivesicular body; and ERC, early recycling compartment.'
