caption: Our data support a model in which inhibition of integrin αvβ3/αvβ5 signaling
  by RGDfV activates c-Abl (26). c-Abl in turn increases expression of ASM, which
  results in increased ASM activity and changes in sphingolipids, including increase
  in ceramides and decrease in sphingomyelins. The consequence of the increase in
  ASM expression and activity is apoptosis. Since ASM mediates the apoptosis, but
  it is not known which sphingolipid(s) is/are the mediator(s) of the apoptosis downstream
  of ASM, the downstream arrows are placed below ASM rather than below specific sphingolipids.
  Since downregulation of ASM expression leads to inhibition of caspase 3 and caspase
  8 activity, caspases are placed downstream of ASM. Inhibition of c-Abl blocked the
  increase in ASM mRNA and activity and prevented the apoptosis, placing c-Abl upstream
  of ASM. It is likely that the interaction between c-Abl and ASM is not direct and
  that other yet-unknown mediators (denoted by the three small arrows and question
  mark) exist within this pathway. Not shown are possible initial upstream regulation
  of ASM by caspase 8 and other intermediate effectors.
