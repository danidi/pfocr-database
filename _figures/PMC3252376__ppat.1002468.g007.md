caption: (1) The inactive SKI-1/S1P zymogen is biosynthesized in the ER and traffics
  to the Golgi apparatus following intramolecular autocatalytic maturation of the
  proenzyme , , , . (2) During HCV infection, the SREBP pathway is activated by a
  variety of molecular mechanisms , –. (3) For SREBP to activate genes involved in
  lipid biosynthesis, its N-terminal domain must be released through sequential endoproteolytic
  cleavage first by SKI-1/S1P and then by S2P , . (4) The released N-terminal domain
  translocates to the nucleus and activates various aspects of lipid metabolism .
  (5) Activation of lipid biosynthesis increases LD formation where the HCV core protein
  localizes to orchestrate HCV assembly and subsequent secretion , , . (6) Biosynthesis
  of LDLR, a proposed receptor for HCV entry, is also activated by SREBP signaling
  , , . (7) Spn4A.RRLL(s) is a secretory pathway-expressed serpin (). (8) Spn4A.RRLL(s)
  interacts and forms a covalent complex with enzymatically active SKI-1/S1P molecules
  ( and ) in the Golgi apparatus preventing SKI-1/S1P-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage
  of SREBP protein (). (9) A small-molecule inhibitor PF-429242 also efficiently inhibits
  SKI-1/S1P endoproteolytic activity (). (10) SKI-1/S1P inhibition blocks expression
  of the putative HCV receptor, LDLR (4), and reduces HCV entry (). (11) The expression
  of other SREBP-regulated genes, such as PCSK9 and SREBP-2, are also blocked ().
  (12) Downstream lipid synthesis is interrupted resulting in overall reduced intracellular
  cholesterol-ester and triglyceride abundance (). (12) This is then detected as a
  decrease in LD abundance (), which impedes assembly and secretion of infectious
  HCV particles.
