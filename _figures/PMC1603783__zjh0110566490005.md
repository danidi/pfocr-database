caption: Schematic of the integrin signaling pathway in glioblastoma. Overall FAK
  activation may be primarily accomplished by direct GFR signaling. However, in certain
  morphologically defined regions (perivascular, perinecrotic, tumor infiltration
  zone), in which extracellular matrix components (ECM) are present, integrins are
  up-regulated in a GFR-overexpressed background and might enhance FAK and ERK1/2
  phosphorylation, potentially resulting in increased motility and transcription.
