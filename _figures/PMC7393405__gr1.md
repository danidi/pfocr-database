caption: Activation of the Main Innate Immune Receptors Involved in CVDs(A) Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. The interaction of TLR agonists with their corresponding
  TLRs induce a downstream signaling pathway that are mainly mediated by adaptor proteins
  that are capable of activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) and finally
  induce the nuclear translocation of the transcription factors nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB), Activator protein 1 (AP-1), and interferon regulatory
  factor (IRF), promoting the activation of pro-inflammatory molecules. Main effectors
  molecules upstream to this pathway are myeloid differentiation primary response
  protein 88 (MyD88) or TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-β (TRIF).
  TLR4/TRIF binding is depicted to happen on the cell surface for simplicity reasons,
  although it is believed to occur in endosomes after receptor internalization. (B)
  Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing
  receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome priming and activation signaling. Appropriate NLRP3
  inflammasome activation requires an initial priming step triggered by several inflammatory
  cytokines, which, in turn, upregulates the transcription of the different inflammasome
  components. Next, a plethora of stimuli ultimately causing potassium (K+) efflux
  induce inflammasome assembly, which is then capable of activating interleukin (IL)-1β
  and IL-18 as well as gasdermin D (GSDMD), leading to pyroptosis and exacerbating
  the inflammatory response. (C) Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
  protein 1 (NOD1) signaling pathway. NOD1 agonists mainly consist of pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and/or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that
  induce conformational changes on NOD1, leading to receptor self-oligomerization
  and recruitment of Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2).
  This adaptor protein then triggers a signaling cascade that subsequently activates
  NF-κB and MAPKs, eventually upregulating the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes.
