caption: Androgenic-inducible miRNAs involved in the process of BC progression. (A)
  In Luminal A BC cells, DHT treatment induces an androgen-related miRNA-mRNA pathway,
  involving miR-363 and its possible target gene IQWD1. In the presence of high levels
  of androgens, a IQWD1 feed-forward regulation activates its own AR-mediated expression
  (), and miR-363 significantly increased. Under relatively low level of DHT, IQWD1
  is negatively regulated by miR-363. (B) In MA and TNBC cells, the DHT administration
  results in an androgen-induced AR activating signal pathway which upregulates let-7
  expression and negatively regulates CMYC and KRAS that are targets of let-7. (C)
  In TNBC cells, the lncRNA ARNILA is negatively regulated by AR after DHT treatment,
  causing a decreased adsorption of miR-204 which in turn inhibits Sox4 expression,
  a gene known to promote EMT. (D) In TNBC cells, DHT induces upregulation of miR-328-3p
  with concomitantly decrease of its target CD44, diminishing EMT, migration and adhesion.
