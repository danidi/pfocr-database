caption: Schematic model of the proposed mechanism for SPRY1 promotion of lysosomal
  degradation of uPAR and inhibition of uPAR-mediated cell adhesion and proliferation.
  First, upregulation of SPRY1 could inhibit growth factor receptor signaling pathway
  and inhibit Raf/MEK/ERK-induced proliferation. On the other hand, SPRY1 interacts
  with uPAR to trigger degradation of uPAR via the lysosomal pathway, and then decrease
  the amount of uPAR recycled back to the cell surface. Cell surface uPAR decrease
  not only reduces adhesion functions, but also inhibits activation of FAK and ERK,
  which finally inhibits cell proliferation.
