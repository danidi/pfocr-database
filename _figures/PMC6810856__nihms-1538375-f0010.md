caption: Illustration showing defective mechanisms in COPD airway epithelial cells
  that leads to exaggerated IFN responses to RV infectionIn normal cells RV-induced
  TLR2 signaling induces SIRT-1 activation, which in turn limits amplification of
  RV-stimulated IFN expression by inhibiting JAK/STAT pathway. COPD cells are defective
  in both TLR2 signaling and expression of SIRT-1 which leads to excessive amplification
  of RV-induced IFN expression.
