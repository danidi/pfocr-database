caption: A schematic illustration of how dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (DPPA) might
  inhibit angiogenesis in breast cancer. DPPA functions as an anti‐tumour drug in
  breast cancer by partially inhibiting tumour angiogenesis. The constitutive inhibition
  of CUX1 by DPPA decreases the mRNA and protein expression of FGF1 and further suppresses
  HGF expression, which results in the suppression of angiogenesis and abnormal tumour
  growth in luminal‐like breast cancer and TNBC
