caption: 'A schematic representation of skewed Th17/Treg cell differentiation in patients
  with BD, a hypothesis. TGFβ activates Smad pathway via TGFβ receptor I/II complex,
  and activated Smad protein leads to forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) expression which is
  a master gene of Treg cells []. TGFβ also activates p38 mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) which regulates Th17 cell differentiation [, ]. In the presence of
  TGFβ, IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway plays a critical role in the reduction of Foxp3
  expression and in the induction of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor
  C (RORC) expression which is a master gene of Th17 cells []. In patients with BD,
  monocytes and T cells overproduce IL-6 in the presence of HSP []. Overexpression
  of RORC [, ], underexpression of Foxp3 [, ], and higher frequencies of Th17 cells
  [–, ] are reported in patients with BD. PHA: phytohemagglutinin, TGFβRI/II: TGFβ
  receptor types I and II, STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription
