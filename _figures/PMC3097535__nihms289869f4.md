caption: Connectivity of differentially expressed genes in the important signaling
  pathway following exposure of PCB 153 in human PBMC depicting the connectivity between
  genes expressed (≥1.0, t-test, p<0.001) and the important signaling pathways in
  human PBMC in vitro following exposure of PCB 153. Geometric figures in red denote
  up-regulated genes and those are green indicate down-regulation. The network shows
  genes mainly involved in cell cycle and cell. Solid interconnecting lines show the
  genes that are directly connected and the dotted lines signify the indirect connection
  between the genes and cellular functions. Canonical functions that are highly represented
  are shown within the box signaling (JAK/Stat, Integrin, Oncostatim M signaling,
  and fMLP signaling in Neutrophils). Genes in uncolored notes were not identified
  as differentially expressed in our experiment and were integrated into computational
  generated networks based on evidence stored in the IPA (Ingenuity Software) knowledge
  memory indicating relevance of this network.
