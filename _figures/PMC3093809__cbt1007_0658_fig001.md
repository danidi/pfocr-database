caption: Schematic representation of selected signaling pathways and the current targeted
  therapies related to RCC. Angiogenic and cell proliferating signaling cascades are
  upregulated in RCC tumor cells. VEGF and other related growth factors secreted by
  tumor cells stimulate angiogenic signaling in the surrounding vascular endothelial
  cells. In response to growth factor signaling mediated through VEGF, PDGF and KIT
  receptors, PI-3-kinase and Ras effectors activate HIF transcription factors, which
  in turn switch on gene expression needed for angiogenesis and cell proliferation
  in endothelial cells. In addition to the angiogenic pathway, the Wnt and HGF pathways
  are also upregulated in RCC tumor cells. While VEGF-targeted therapy for metastatic
  RCC is focused on blocking angiogenic signaling in vascular endothelial cells surrounding
  the tumor, mTOR inhibitors act directly on the tumor cells to suppress growth.
