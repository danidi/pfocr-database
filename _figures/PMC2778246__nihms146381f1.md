caption: In this pathway, ordinarily, l-arginine is converted by the isoforms of nitric
  oxide synthase (NOS) to citrulline plus nitric oxide (NO), which then diffuses to
  the smooth muscle cell, where NO binds to its principal receptor, soluble guanylyl
  cyclase (sGC), which in turn, converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inducing vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation
  through multiple mechanisms (; see Color Figures, page 500). Counter-regulation
  is provided in pulmonary and penile vascular smooth muscle by phosphodiesterase-5
  (PDE5), which hydrolyzes cGMP to 5′GMP. Attempts are being made to target each of
  these steps in recent or ongoing clinical trials.
