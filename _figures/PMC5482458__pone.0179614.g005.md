caption: Lipo-PGE1 strongly inhibits collagen synthesis in HDFs. Furthermore, an ERK-
  and Ets-1-dependent pathway is involved in Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen production.
  Lipo-PGE1 can be modulated to down-regulate collagen synthesis in human HDFs and
  may provide a therapeutic approach to inhibit fibrosis and its roles in the pathogenesis
  of skin disorders.
