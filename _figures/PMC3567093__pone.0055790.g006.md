caption: Enzymes and metabolites that are part of glycosis, fatty acide synthesis
  and the TCA cycle are shown. G6PD, Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase. ENO1, Alpha
  enolase. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway. ACAT2, Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. ACAMD,
  Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. IDH2, Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP]. MDHM, Malate dehydrogenase.
  GLUD1, Glutamate dehydrogenase1. α-KG, α-Ketoglutarate. This simplified diagram
  is based on the KEGG pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).
  The enzymes in circle were identified by 2-DE MS in this current study.
