caption: Following genotoxic stress, such as ionizing radiation, increased levels
  of cyclin E and the associated kinase activity are responsible for phosphorylating
  a critical cellular target implicated in apoptosis. Such a target may be associated
  with mitochondria, the critical cellular site for activation of apoptosis. Mitochondria
  releases apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome C and Smac. Cytochrome C, in the
  presence of ATP and the adaptor molecule Apaf-1, recruits and activates caspase
  9 within the apoptosome [], leading to further activation of the effector caspases,
  such as caspase 3. Activated caspase 3 can function to activate a feed-back loop,
  leading to further cytochrome c release and amplification of the apoptosis process
  []. During the late stages of apoptosis, a truncated Cyclin E is generated through
  its caspase-mediated proteolytic cleavage. The resulting p18-Cyclin E may trigger
  apoptosis by amplifying the mitochondrial death process. It may also block cell
  survival by preventing the DNA repair process, since p18-Cyclin E can bind to Ku70,
  a critical component in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), the major pathway for
  DNA repair following genotoxic stress.
