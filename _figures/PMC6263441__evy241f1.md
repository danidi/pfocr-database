caption: '—Life cycle highlighting main processes happening upon meiosis and plasmogamy/karyogamy:
  (a) duplication of DNA during interphase (synthesis phase); (b) meiosis-specific
  bouquet formation, promoted by BQT1 and BQT2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (; );
  (c) the assembly of synaptonemal complex (; ) involves many meiosis-specific structural
  proteins, some of them high conserved, PHC2 and HOP1 (; ) and ZMM complex protein
  ZIP4/SPO22 (); (d) sister chromatids are kept close together by cohesin complexes,
  composed by SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 or its meiotic paralog REC8 (; ; ; ), which keep together
  sister chromatids until anaphase II when they are finally cleaved by separases ();
  double-strand breaks are introduced onto DNA by SPO11 and TopoVIB-like proteins
  working as dimers or tetramers (; ; ); before the activation of the homologous recombination
  machinery SPO11 is removed and DNA strands are processed (resection) by MRN complex
  (MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1) resulting in the single 3′ strand used for invasion of the
  homologous chromosome, where it is extended by a DNA polymerase forming a D-loop
  (; ; ); (e) homologous recombination mediated by RAD51A and its meiotic paralog
  DMC1, HOP2 and MND1 (; ); (f) chiasmata contain double-Holliday junctions, which

  bearing pathway I, which involves MER3, MSH4-5, MLH1-3, EXO1, and SGS1 (; ; ; )
  and pathway II, which involves MUS81 and MMS4 (; ); the correct assortment of chromosomes
  depends on the occurrence of cross-overs (); both pathways work at the same time,
