caption: Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolome and abnormal class switching in CF. Arachidonic
  acid (AA) is metabolized by cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX1/2) and prostaglandin synthase
  (PGS) into the inflammatory eicosanoids, prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2). AA is also
  a substrate for 5LO to produce leukotriene A4 (LTA4). The 15 lipoxygenase (15LO)
  activity drives then the SPM, lipoxin A4 (LXA4) synthesis (from LTA4) at the expense
  of the production of the inflammatory lipid, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) that involves
  leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) activity. The sequential activities of 15LO and
  5LO drive the biosynthesis of LXA4, with an intermediate product, 15S hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  (15S-HpETE). Acetylsalicylic acid inhibited COX (ASA-COX) leads to the production
  of 15R hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-R-HpETE) which is converted by the 5LO
  to the SPM, 15-epi-LXA4. In CF, the abnormal class switching from inflammatory biosynthetic
  pathway to the pro-resolving pathway results into an increased LTB4 and decreased
  LXA4 biosynthesis in the airway which are responsible for the sustained inflammation.

  description: Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolome and abnormal class switching in CF.
    Arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized by cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX1/2) and prostaglandin
    synthase (PGS) into the inflammatory eicosanoids, prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2).
    AA is also a substrate for 5LO to produce leukotriene A4 (LTA4). The 15 lipoxygenase
    (15LO) activity drives then the SPM, lipoxin A4 (LXA4) synthesis (from LTA4) at
    the expense of the production of the inflammatory lipid, leukotriene B4 (LTB4)
    that involves leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) activity. The sequential activities
    of 15LO and 5LO drive the biosynthesis of LXA4, with an intermediate product,
    15S hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic (15S-HpETE). Acetylsalicylic acid inhibited COX
    (ASA-COX) leads to the production of 15R hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-R-HpETE)
    which is converted by the 5LO to the SPM, 15-epi-LXA4. In CF, the abnormal class
    switching from inflammatory biosynthetic pathway to the pro-resolving pathway
    results into an increased LTB4 and decreased LXA4 biosynthesis in the airway which
    are responsible for the sustained inflammation.
