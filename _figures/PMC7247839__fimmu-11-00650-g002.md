caption: Entosis in neoplastic hepatocytes. We recently showed that hepatocellular
  carcinoma cells were able to engulf their live neighbors by entosis (). Entosis
  is an important disease pathway in cancer epithelia involving E-cadherin and β-catenin
  (). Tumor cells that detach from matrix are prone to entosis, and further research
  is necessary to measure its implications in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
