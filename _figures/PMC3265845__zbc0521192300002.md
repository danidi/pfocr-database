caption: Metabolism in cones. Photoreceptors are highly active metabolically and require
  substantial glucose and oxygen, which are supplied by the choroidal vessels via
  the RPE cells. Lactate may also be released by retinal Müller glia and taken up
  by photoreceptor cells. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation provides cells with
  large amounts of ATP for neuronal functions but can also cause an excess of ROS.
  Removal of ROS requires the actions of the endogenous antioxidative enzymes (superoxide
  dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) and the natural antioxidant
  glutathione. The pentose phosphate pathway generates NADPH, which is important for
  glutathione recycling and lipid synthesis. Sufficient supplies of NADPH, ATP, and
  the metabolic intermediates ensure rapid macromolecular synthesis, underlying the
  continuous self-renewal of cone OS. Growth factor signaling, including activation
  of the insulin receptor, which stimulates mTOR phosphorylation, can positively regulate
  the key steps of glycolysis. Cones also need NADPH for an early step of the visual
  cycle, reduction of 11-trans-retinal, which ultimately results in regeneration of
  11-cis-retinal. The RPE participates in this cycle, with intermediates cycling between
  cone OS and the RPE. The major metabolic pathways are highlighted in blue, with
  the key proteins and molecules of therapeutic interest shown in red.
