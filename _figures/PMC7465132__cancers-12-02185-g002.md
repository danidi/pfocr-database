caption: Overview of the cell death receptor-associated signaling pathway. The signaling
  pathway is initiated by the interaction between the TNFR superfamily members and
  their ligands. (a) TNF-α binds with TNFR1, which recruits TRADD, TRAF2, CYLD, cIAP1,
  cIAP2 and RIP1 to form complex I. If cIAP1 polyubiquitinates RIP1, complex I activates
  both the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. However, if RIP1 is deubiquitinated
  by CYLD, complex IIa or complex IIb may be subsequently formed to induce apoptosis
  or necroptosis, respectively. When caspase-8 is intact, the formation of complex
  II, which leads to apoptosis and RIP3 inhibition, is favored. Conversely, if caspase-8
  is compromised, the formation of complex IIb (known as the necrosome), which consists
  of RIP1, RIP3 and FADD, is inclined to phosphorylate MLKL, leading to necroptosis
  via the translocation of phosphorylated MLKL and plasma membrane permeabilization.
  (b) Fas ligand (CD95L) binds with Fas receptor (CD95); this recruits FADD, procaspase-8
  and cFLIP to form DISC. Similarly, intact caspase-8 favors the formation of complex
  IIa and apoptosis. However, inactive caspase-8 contributes to the formation of complex
  IIb and necroptosis. (c) The interaction between TRAIL and DR4/5 leads to the apoptotic
  and necroptotic situations mentioned above, based on the activity of caspase-8.
  (d) In the presence of genotoxic stresses, the removal of IAP or anti-tumor drugs
  (e.g., etoposide), RIP1 is activated to form the ripotosome, which consists of RIP1,
  RIP3, FADD, procaspase-8 and . If  is present, the phosphorylation of MLKL by the
  ripotosome is inhibited, and apoptosis is favored. By contrast, the absence of  leads
  to the phosphorylation of MLKL, which favors necroptosis. The figure was redrawn
  and modified from [].
