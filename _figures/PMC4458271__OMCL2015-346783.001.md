caption: Ceramide formation via de novo synthesis, recycling, and degradation. In
  the catabolic pathway, ceramides are generated through sphingomyelin hydrolysis
  by sphingomyelinases (SMases). In de novo synthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase
  (SPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme. In the recycling pathway, sphingosine, the product
  of sphingolipid catabolism, is salvaged through reacylation, resulting in ceramide
  production.
