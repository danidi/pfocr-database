caption: Proposed models of the CoQ10biosynthetic pathway in mammals showing two alternative
  sequences of reactions (the decaprenyl chain is abbreviated as R). Path (a) corresponds
  to the traditional model in which COQ6 acts after the condensation of the ring with
  the isoprene tail, while path (b) shows the unknown decarboxylase and hydroxylase
  (in blue) acting before COQ6, consistent with the accumulation of 4-HP10 in COQ6-deficient
  cells. Path (c) depicts the same pathway when VA is employed instead of 4-HB. Biosynthesis
  can occur even in the absence of COQ6 because carbon C5 of the ring is already bound
  to a methoxyl group in VA.
