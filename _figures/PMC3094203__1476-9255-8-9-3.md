caption: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a ligand-activated
  nuclear receptor with potent anti-inflammatory properties that modulates the immune
  inflammatory response. It has been observed in human atherosclerotic lesions and
  is involved in macrophage cholesterol homeostasis, cellular differentiation, lipid
  storage, insulin modulation, macrophage lipid homeostasis and anti-inflammatory
  activities. Molecules such as oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) or fatty
  acids may stimulate inflammatory mediators such as 9- and 13- hydroxyoctadecadienoic
  acid (HODE) generated via the 12,15 lipoxygenase pathway. These are ligands for
  PPARγ. IL4 is a cytokine that can stimulate PPARγ. PPARγ activation is also associated
  with the expression of M2 macrophage markers such as the mannose receptor (MR) also
  known as CD206 []. AMAC1, alternative activated macrophage associated CC-chemokine
  1; AP1, activator protein 1; CD, cluster of differentiation; IL, interleukin; NFκB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; SR, scavenger receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription.
