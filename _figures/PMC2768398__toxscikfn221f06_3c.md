caption: Cd-induced alterations within the ingenuity canonical p53-signaling pathway
  in C57BL/6J and SWV embryos. Cd-induced alterations in C57 and SWV embryos were
  mapped to the p53 Signaling canonical ingenuity pathway (w/modifications). Genes
  are color coded based on Cd-effect specificity. Shapes of genes indicate known functions.
