caption: Regulation of the apoptosome and caspase activity by IAPs. The release of
  cytochrome-c from mitochondria which occurs during intrinsic pathway of apoptosis
  triggers an ATP-dependent conformational change and oligomerisation of the adaptor
  apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) in a heptameric complex apoptosome.
  Apaf-1 then recruits Caspase-9 via its pro-domain through a homotypic CARD-CARD
  interaction. Caspase-9 is activated by homodimerisation and promotes the activating
  cleavage of effector caspase-3 leading to apoptosis. Caspase-9 undergoes autocatalytic
  processing and is then quickly disconnected from the apoptosome which is free to
  recruit a new pro-caspase-9. XIAP can control caspase activating pathway at several
  steps. First, XIAP is present in the apoptosome where it directly binds processed
  caspase-9 and inhibits its activity. The inhibition of caspase-9 by XIAP could stabilize
  the caspase-9 apoptosome complex and block the cycle of caspase-9 activation. Second,
  XIAP can directly bind and inhibit active effector caspase-3. XIAP can inhibit caspase
  activity by hindering substrate accessibility or hiding the protease catalytic residue,
  and/or by promoting ubiquitination or neddylation. Although unable to inhibit their
  activity, cIAP1 can bind to processed caspases and promote their ubiquitination.
  An IBM-dependent binding of IAP antagonists such as Smac/Diablo prevents XIAP-mediated
  caspase inhibition while cIAPs could interfere with neutralizing binding XIAP-Smac/Diablo.
