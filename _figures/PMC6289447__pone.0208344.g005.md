caption: Vitamin E synthesis is largely divided into two pathways that are regulated
  by homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT) and homogentisate phytyltransferase
  (HPT). The 9 differentially expressed enzymes in vitamin E synthesis are ρ-hydroxy
  phenyl pyruvic acid dioxygenase (HPPD), 2-methyl-6-phytyl benzoquinone methyltransferase
  (MPBQ-MT), 2-methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-plastoquinol methyltransferase (MGGBQ-MT),
  tocopherol cyclase (TC), γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT), geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate reductase (GGDR), homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT), homogentisate
  phytyltransferase (HPT), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Heat map analysis shows
  the differential tissue-specific expression of 22 genes associated with the vitamin
  E pathways. The color bar indicates the value of expression in a sample, based on
  the color key at the upper left corner. Black indicates upregulation and green,
  downregulation.
