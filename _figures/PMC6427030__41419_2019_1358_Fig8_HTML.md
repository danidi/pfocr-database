caption: 'The scheme diagram summarizes the pathway described: androgen receptor (AR)
  signaling could suppress CSF-1 expression via upregulation of miR-185-5p in renal
  tubular epithelial cells (RTCs) in response to calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM)
  crystals stimuli. Tissue production of CSF-1 can induce M0-MΦs recruitment from
  the blood, and skew MΦs toward an M2 phenotype, which has a high crystals phagocytic
  ability'
