caption: 'Virus infection activates the RIG-I/MAVS pathway. Viral RNA binds to the
  C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) of RIG-I and induces a conformational change and
  dimerization. The central helicase domain is required for this process. The CARD
  domain of the RIG-I dimer then binds unanchored lysine-63 (K63) polyubiquitin chains
  and activates MAVS on the mitochondria membrane through the MAVS CARD domain. This
  interaction triggers a conformational switch of MAVS (changed color and shape of
  MAVS CARD in the diagram), which leads to the formation of MAVS aggregates on the
  mitochondrial membrane. MAVS aggregates are composed of MAVS polymers and potently
  activate downstream signaling cascade. Critical transcription factors IRF3 and NFκB
  are subsequently activated to induce the expression of interferon and other antiviral
  genes. MAVS aggregates behave like prions: they are partially resistant to detergent
  extraction and proteinase digestion and can efficiently self-propagate. The CARD
  domain of MAVS directly mediates the self-aggregation, and the transmembrane domain
  (TM) greatly facilitates MAVS aggregate formation on the mitochondria in vivo (left).
  Functional prion-like MAVS polymers can also form by self-aggregation in vitro in
  the absence of the TM domain (right). MAVS polymers formed in vitro can potently
  induce endogenous MAVS to form functional aggregates on the mitochondria from uninfected
  cells. This property closely resembles that of infectious prions.'
