caption: Loss of PTEN function results in accumulation of PIP3, which  activates a
  cascade of signaling molecules. Activation of AKT leads to the  inhibition of pro-apoptotic
  factors such as BAD and stimulates cell cycle  progression through down-regulation
  of the G1 cell cycle inhibitor  p27. PTEN and its effectors also interact with other
  signaling pathways known  to be essential for stem cell maintenance, including the
  Wnt/β-catenin  (β-cat) pathway. Emerging evidence shows that the loss of PTEN  function
  leads to activation of the active form of β-catenin, which leads  to the acquisition
  of self-renewal ability. PTEN loss also activates mTOR,  whose kinase activity is
  inhibited by the drug rapamycin. Increased mTOR  activity can lead to increased
  cell survival and proliferation. Other  downstream targets of AKT include the FOXO
  transcription factors that are  negatively regulated by phosphorylation of AKT.
  FOXO transcription factors  control cell proliferation and survival and help eliminate
  reactive oxygen  species (ROS). Cells without FOXO activity have an increased  proliferation
  rate and decreased quiescence. RTK, receptor tyrosine  kinase.
