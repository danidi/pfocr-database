caption: Platelets circulate with a lifespan of 7-10 days in humans. Platelet clearance
  is mediated by autoreactive antibodies towards the integrin αIIbβ3 and the VWF receptor
  complex GPIb-IX subunit GPIbα. Some anti-GPIbα, but not anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies induce
  platelet desialylation, thereby diverging platelet clearance to hepatic AMRs. Binding
  of VWF may also induce platelet desialylation and clearance under certain circumstances.
  Following plasma factor (autoantibodies or VWF) binding, platelets may be also cleared
  by galactose-binding lectins. Platelet survival also depends on the interplay between
  pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, which are critical regulators
  of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Platelet clearance via scavenger receptors is
  accelerated in mice lacking the pro-survival proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. In
  vivo aging (senescence signal) induces platelet desialylation, possibly by intrinsic
  sialidases normally contained in intracellular lysosome compartments.
