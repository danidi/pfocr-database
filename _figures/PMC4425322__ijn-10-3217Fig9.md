caption: 'Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism of LDH-NP-induced toxicity
  in A549 cells. Oxidative stress caused by LDH-NPs activates SFK-JNK and p38-NF-κB
  signaling pathway, which increases expression of protective antioxidant enzymes,
  such as CAT, GR, SOD, and HO-1. However, this signaling activation concomitantly
  leads to induction of the proinflammatory mediators, IL-6 and IL-8.Abbreviations:
  IL, interleukin; JNK, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase; SFK, Src family kinase; LDH-NPs,
  layered double hydroxide nanoparticles; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; CAT, catalase;
  GR, glucose reductase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1.'
