caption: Shikimate pathway from 3-dehydroquinate to the aromatic amino acid tryptophan.
  Pathway adapted and simplified from Maeda and Dudareva with overlay of log2 fold
  change (− 1.3 > log2 fold > 1.3 and p adj < 0.05) in regulation in C. fritschii
  PCC 6912 under both FR (red denotes upregulation, no downregulation for this pathway)
  and UV (blue denotes upregulation, pale blue downregulation). No significant change
  in regulation for other key enzymes including 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate
  synthase and chorismate synthase involved in conversion of shikimate to chorismate.
  No change in regulation from chorismate to tyrosine and phenylalanine.
