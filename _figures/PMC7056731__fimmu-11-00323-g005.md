caption: Interplays between Hippo signaling and ROS production. Recognition of bacterial
  infections by TLR1/2/4 triggers activation of MST1/2. Then MST1/2 phosphorylates
  PKC-α and activates PKCα-LyGDI-Rac cascade to induce assembly of the TRAF6-ECSIT
  complex, which is required for recruitment of mitochondria to phagosomes and ample
  ROS production. MST1 is activated by TRAF2 in response to H2O2 stimulation via unknown
  mechanism. MST1/2 phosphorylates Keap1 and prevents Keap1-mediated Nrf2 degradation,
  resulting in the expression of antioxidant genes. High intracellular ROS increase
  YAP expression independent of the canonical Hippo pathway; however, its mechanism
  is still elusive. The functions of Hippo-YAP in ROS production are highlighted with
  red color.
