caption: Twenty-nine probe sets (representing 26 genes) were identified as uniquely
  dysregulated in the differential expression analyses of dorsal versus tail lesions
  and dorsal versus facial lesions. These 26 genes were used as input in Ingenuity's
  Pathway Analysis tool. This tool generates networks by attempting to connect submitted
  genes of interest together using Ingenuity’s Knowledge Base constructed from curated
  literature. The cell morphology and connective tissue-associated cancer network
  (A) and the cellular development and growth-associated cancer network (B) are (statistically)
  significantly associated with the function of cancer. Red is upregulation while
  green is downregulation.
