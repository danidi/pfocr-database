caption: The estimated network topology and enriched pathways in the metabolomics
  study for the benign class (left) and cancer class (right). Dashed lines represent
  edges that are present in only one class. Nodes in multiple colors are present in
  multiple pathways (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)
