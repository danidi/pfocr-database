caption: The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the motoneuron–muscle communication.
  (A) Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation involves morphological changes both in
  presynaptic motor terminals and postsynaptic muscle membrane. Mounting evidence
  shows that EVs carry morphogens, such as Wnts and BMPs, and several miRNAs, suggesting
  their involvement in the instauration and maintenance of NMJ. In the extracellular
  milieu, soluble and EV-carried signals can activate agrin–Lrp4–MuSK signaling required
  for both aneural and neural AChR clustering. MuSK forms a receptor complex with
  Lrp4 acting as a central scaffold that orchestrates all steps of NMJ formation and
  maintenance in the postsynaptic side. Once released by the motoneuron, agrin together
  with Wnt bind their target receptors, activating MuSK tyrosine kinase which leads
  to AChR clustering in the postsynaptic membrane. Lrp4–MuSK interaction, along with
  the action of Dok7, is sufficient for the partial activation of MuSK, which is important
  for pre-patterning of AChRs in myotubes before innervation. Wnts can also bind to
  Fz receptors and Lrp5/6, activating Dvl, which inhibits Gsk-3β and leads to the
  disassembly of axin destruction complex (formed by Gsk-3β, axin, APC and β-catenin).
  Wnt pathway activation results in the inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation and
  its translocation into the nucleus to regulate target genes. (B) Dysregulation of
  signal exchange mediated by EVs at the NMJ in motoneuron disorders. Familiar amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (FALS) disease is caused by mutations in the prion-like domains
  of SOD1, TDP43 and FUS/TLS proteins. These mutations induce protein aggregation
  and the formation of insoluble granules which accumulate into the neuronal cells,
  leading to cell death and subsequently to denervation and NMJ degradation. The transmission
  of these misfolded proteins is mediated by EVs, which facilitate their spread through
  the surrounding neuronal cells. The involvement of EVs in the pathogenesis of ALS
  and other neurodegenerative diseases also arises through EV-carried miRNAs (including
  myomiR-218, -206, -133a, -133b, -1), regulating the establishment of the appropriate
  skeletal muscle–nerve interaction. An impaired expression of these EV-miRNAs has
  been observed during the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.
