caption: Recapitulative spatio-temporal scheme of the interactions between NF signaling
  and downstream hormonal pathways. Rhizobia produce NFs that are perceived in root
  hairs (RHs) through LysM-RLK receptors such as NFP and LYK3. NF perception leads
  to calcium spiking and activation of DMI3 that acts upstream of the CK receptor
  MtCRE1. The signaling cascade involving DMI3 and CRE1 is likely involved in both
  epidermal and cortical signaling (black boxes). NF treatment triggers early CK biosynthesis
  gene (IPT/CYP735A/LOG) expression and CK accumulation in M. truncatula roots downstream
  of DMI3 but independently of CRE1 signaling (). Although tissue specificity of this
  CK production was not determined, evidence from L. japonicus and M. truncatula suggests
  that epidermal CK accumulation is a negative regulator of RH infection (1) and NF
  signaling (2) (; ). In contrast, cortical CK is a positive regulator of nodule organogenesis
  (3) (; ; ). Bioactive CKs are perceived by CRE1 and induce expression of NIN and
  ERN1 (), which are positive regulators of both infection and nodule organogenesis
  (; ). This induction might be partly through regulation of DELLA activities. GA
  is a negative regulator of DELLA protein stability. Bioactive GA pools are likely
  present in both epidermis and cortex early after NF treatment (; ; ). DELLAs play
  a positive regulatory role on symbiotic gene expression such as ERN1 and they negatively
  regulate CK degradation (, ; ). In contrast, CK positively regulate GA inactivation
  enzymes and down-regulate expression of the GA20ox activation enzyme (), suggesting
  a negative feedback of CK on GA active pools. NF signaling induces ethylene production,
  both independently of the LHK1/CRE1 CK pathway (4) () and downstream of CK perception
  (5) (). Ethylene reduces CK production in M. truncatula roots, possibly through
  negative feedback on NF signaling (6) (). Ethylene negatively regulates NF-induced
  calcium spiking, RH infection, and nodule organogenesis (; ). Regulation of auxin
  biosynthetic and conjugation enzyme (GH3) genes occurs in NF treated RHs and upon
  S. meliloti inoculation in an NF-dependent manner (; ; ; ). Reciprocal positive
  and negative feedback regulatory loops between some auxin and NF regulated genes
  (7) was shown by comparing the combined effect of auxin and NFs to either treatment
  alone (). Downstream of CK perception, control of auxin transport in the cortex
  seems regulated by differential expression of PIN genes () or accumulation of flavonoid
  compounds. Auxin accumulation is also mediated by MtLAX2 that is induced upon S.
  meliloti infection in vasculature and early nodule primordia, and which is required
  for nodule organogenesis (). In parallel, epidermal auxin signaling controls infection
  thread (IT) formation, at least partly through ARF16a (). Exogenous application
  of high concentrations (μM range) of ABA or JA inhibits NF-induced calcium spiking
  (; ) but this inhibition is so far not supported by any transcriptomic data. Plain
  bars represent negative and plain arrows positive regulations. Dashed lines are
  hypothetical relationships, and solid lines have evidence from the literature. Different
  hormones are highlighted by different colors. CK, cytokinins; GA, gibberellins;
  ABA, abscisic acid; JA, jasmonic acid; NF, Nod factors. Bacteria entrapped in curled
  root hair and IT are shown in blue.
