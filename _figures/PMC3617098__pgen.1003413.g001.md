number: Figure 1
caption: (A) DNA base lesions induced by SN1 or SN2 alkylating agent are recognized
  and excised by the DNA glycosylase, Aag, to generate an AP site. The base excision
  repair (BER) pathway continues when an AP endonuclease cleaves the DNA backbone
  to generate 3′ hydroxyl and 5′ deoxyribose phosphate (5′dRP) termini. Polymerase
  β removes the 5′dRP species, and inserts the missing DNA bases; DNA ligase completes
  BER by sealing the nicked DNA. (B) Error-prone translesion (TLS) polymerases can
  assist in the tolerance or bypass of base lesions and AP sites. Parp1 has an important
  role in regulating the response to DNA damage. During times of moderate DNA damage,
  Parp1 activation facilitates BER. Upon high levels of DNA damage, Parp1 undergoes
  hyperactivation; cells consequently suffer NAD+/ATP depletion, triggering cell death.
