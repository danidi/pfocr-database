caption: 'The base excision repair (BER) pathway. Monofunctional DNA glycosylases
  (UNG, SMUG1, TDG, MPG, MBD4) excise the damaged base leaving an abasic site (AP
  site) in DNA. Subsequently, the DNA backbone is incised 5′ to the AP site by AP-endonuclease
  1 (APE1), which directly generates a strand break with 3′-hydroxyl (3′-OH) group
  and a 5′-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (5′-dRP) end. Bi-functional DNA glycosylases (NEIL1/2/3,
  OGG1, NTH1, MYH) utilise an amino group of the enzyme rather than a water molecule
  as a nucleophile to cleave the N-glycosidic bond. Resolution of the resulting Schiff-base
  intermediate in a β-elimination reaction leads to incision of the DNA backbone 3′
  to the AP site. This is referred to as the AP lyase activity and results in a single
  strand break with 3′-phospho-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (3′-PUA) and 5′-phosphate
  (5′-P) ends. APE1 generates 3′-OH termini using its 3′-phosphodiesterase activity.
  NEIL1 and NEIL2 utilise a β,δ-elimination reaction with removal of the deoxyribose
  residue and generation of 3′-phosphate termini. The 3′-phosphate may be removed
  by polynucleotide kinase (PNK) in an APE1-independent BER sub-pathway. BER proceeds
  further via two alternative sub-pathways: short-patch (SP) repair, which involves
  replacement of one nucleotide, or long-patch (LP) repair, which involves replacement
  of several nucleotides (at least two, and often 6–13 nucleotides). In SP-BER, DNA
  polymerase β (Pol β) inserts a new nucleotide and removes the 5′-dRP moity using
  an intrinsic lyase activity, before the nick is sealed by XRCC1 and DNA ligase III
  (LigIII). If, however, modification of the 5′-end is modified in some way that prevents
  its excision by Pol β, BER will be funnelled into the LP-BER pathway, which utilises
  DNA replication factors and synthesises a longer stretch of DNA (2–13 nucleotide-long
  repair patches have been reported). The 5′-terminal moiety is then removed as part
  of an oligonucleotide by Flap endonuclease (FEN1). The resulting nick is sealed
  by DNA ligase I (LigI)'
