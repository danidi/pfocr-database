caption: 'NCS1 as stress response protein: proposed mechanism. Environmental stressors
  such as TNF‐α or oxidative stress, which activate the transcription factor NFκB,
  lead to transcriptional up‐regulation of NCS1. NCS1 functions as cytosolic Ca2+
  buffer, increases InsP3‐dependent ER Ca2+ release, and activates the Akt pathway.
  Increased NCS1 expression therefore causes disrupted Ca2+signaling and increased
  Akt activity and consequently promotes cell survival and motility.'
