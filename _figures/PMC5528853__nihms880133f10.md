caption: ICD, intercalated disc.(Left side) Hippo signaling is low. YAP phosphorylation
  and YAP binding to the DGC is reduced.YAP-TEAD promote the transcription of target
  genes including Sgcδ and α-catenin.YAP-TEAD promote DGC assembly by promoting the
  expression of the core component Sgcδ.The ICD is immature in neonatal cardiomyocytes.
  Yap promotes the expression of the ICD component α3-catenin.(Right side) Hippo signaling
  is high. YAP phosphorylation and YAP binding to the DGC is increased.YAP-TEAD transcription-activating
  activity is reduced.The DGC sequesters phosphorylated YAP through an interaction
  involving the PPxY motif of DAG1.The ICD is mature in adult cardiomyocytes. YAP
  is incorporated into the ICD independent of Hippo through α-catenin binding.
