caption: Scheme for up-regulation of the PAI-1 gene by EGF in glioblastoma. In glioblastoma
  cells, binding of EGF to EGFR induces rapid phosphorylation of Src, which in turn
  results in phosphorylation and translocation of PKCδ into the membrane (likely recruited
  via an adaptor protein CDCP1). Phosphorylated PKCδ activates SphK1, which subsequently
  translocates to the membrane. The translocation of SphK1 can be efficiently blocked
  by both Src and PKC inhibitors (PP2 and Gö6983, respectively), and siRNA to PKCδ.
  Activation of SphK1 is indispensable for both EGFinduced c-jun phosphorylation and
  PAI-1 activation but not for ATF-2 phosphorylation. Depletion of either SphK1 or
  PKCδ expression blocks EGFactivated PAI-1 expression and c-jun activation. However,
  this depletion has no effect on ATF-2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated c-jun and
  independently activated ATF-2 may activate PAI-1 expression by binding to the regulatory
  elements located within 17 Alu elements in the 5′ flanking region of the PAI-1 gene.
