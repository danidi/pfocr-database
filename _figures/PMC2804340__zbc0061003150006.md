caption: A model for the regulation of C. elegans lifespan and innate immunity. A,
  a schematic demonstrating that daf-2 regulates both nematode lifespan and the innate
  immune response in a daf-16-dependent manner (based largely on the work in Refs.
  , , , ). In contrast, as depicted in B, while the germ line acts through daf-16
  to control lifespan (, ) under standard nematode growth conditions, the germ line
  acts independently of daf-16 and in parallel to the p38 MAPK pathway (this work).
  Under modified nematode growth conditions (depicted with an asterisk), daf-16 does
  mediate the effect of the germ line on host defense (, ). The p38 MAPK pathway also
  plays a role in lifespan regulation in wild-type () but not germ line-deficient
  nematodes; for simplicity, this is not shown in these models.
