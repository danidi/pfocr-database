number: Figure 1
caption: MiRNA targeted signaling pathways in four different important cells including
  plaque macrophage, platelet, monocyte and endothelial cell. Bioinformatic analysis
  was used to find significantly upregulated miRNAs target genes. Those target genes
  were clustered based on SAGE genie and categorized into four cell types. Each cell
  specific genes were then functionally clustered according to Reactome pathway. The
  two steps were performed in DAVID functional clustering tools and the figure was
  generated using CytoScape. The pathway which was targeted by only one miRNA was
  not displayed.
