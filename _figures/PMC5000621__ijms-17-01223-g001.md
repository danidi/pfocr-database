caption: Mechanisms of beneficial effects of increased-based therapy. Dipeptidyl peptidase
  (DPP)-4 inhibition increases active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels and GLP-1
  signaling through its receptor. DPP-4 inhibition also inhibits degradation of its
  substrates other than GLP-1 (e.g., stromal-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α)), thereby
  activating incretin-independent signaling. GLP-1 inhibits inflammation and oxidative
  stress by downregulating inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α),
  NF-κB, Rho-kinase activation, and the glycation end-products (AGE) pathway. GLP-1
  inhibits apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of BAX/Bcl-2, which are a pro-apoptotic
  protein and an anti-apoptotic protein. The beneficial effects are also exerted via
  glucose-lowering by GLP-1.
