caption: In the canonical pathway (left), long primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are transcribed
  by RNA polymerase II and are then capped and polyadenylated, forming RNA with a
  hairpin secondary structure. Cropping is the first step in the maturation mediated
  by the RNase III enzyme Drosha and produces a ∼65 nucleotide hairpin RNA with a
  2-3 nucleotide overhang termed precursor—miRNA (pre-miRNA). pre-miRNA is recognized
  and exported into cytoplasm by the Exportin-5 (EXP5)-Ran-GTP complex for further
  processing by Dicer with its partner TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and Arogonaute
  proteins 1-4 (AGO). Dicer processing generates the miRNA:miRNA* duplex. One strand
  of the miRNA duplex is selected to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC),
  which mediates translation inhibition or mRNA degradation. In the non-canonical
  pathway (right), some miRNAs called mirtrons are embedded in short introns and bypass
  the Drosha procession. After the splicing and production of the mature mRNA, the
  excised intron is debranched and trimmed to generate the pre-miRNA that can be EXP5
  and exported by EXP5-Ran-GTP complex, and then subsequently enter the canonical
  pathway for miRNAs biogenesis.
