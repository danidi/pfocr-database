caption: Possible mechanism of Wilms tumor 1 antisense RNA (WT1-AS) functioning. (A)
  A heteroduplex formed by the combination of WT1-AS and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA
  could regulate the expression of WT1 protein. (B) WT1-AS can bind to WT1 protein
  to regulate the abundance of WT1 protein. (C) WT1-AS can directly bind to the TATA
  region of the WT1 promoter, inhibit WT1 transcription, and downregulate WT1 protein
  expression, thereby inhibiting the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. (D) WT1-AS can bind
  as a molecular decoy to miR-203a-5p and miR-330-5p and can inhibit the translation
  of downstream genes, including TP53 and FOXN2. (E) WT1-AS can reduce extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation.
