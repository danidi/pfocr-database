caption: 'Analysis of the overlap between our combined approach and Nermal for the
  GO biological process term “Cell cycle process” (GO:0022402). Top 150 of either
  our combined ranking or Nermal alone were analyzed for GO term “DNA repair” (GO:0006281)
  and these genes were discarded. The remaining lists (Ranking combination scheme:
  89 genes and Nermal: 88 genes) were further compared. In total, 7 genes were found
  in common (BACH1, NFE2L3, DDX11, CHEK2, MAPT, BUB1B, UBASH3A). A combined list of
  the remaining genes (Ranking: 81 genes and Nermal: 82 genes; total 163 genes) was
  analyzed with the Genomatix Pathway System (GePS). The biological process term “Cell
  cycle process” was the most enriched (P-value: 4.83E−25). The relation between the
  different cell cycle proteins is depicted (red: candidates combined ranking scheme,
  blue: candidates Nermal).'
