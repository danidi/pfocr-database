caption: Areca nut first comes in contact with epithelial cells where it's both the
  constituent, alkaloids and polyphenols acts on the epithelial cells and induces
  TGF-β signaling. This induced TGF-β signaling in the epithelial cells could be source
  of inflammation and can also diffuse into the connective tissue where it suppresses
  anti-fibrogenic cytokines like BMP7. In the connective tissue, areca nut acts on
  fibroblast cells along with TGF-β produced from the epithelium and potentiates its
  action in activating fibroblast cells responsible for inducing fibrosis.
