caption: 'Model of the role of Irf1, Irf8, and NLR family members in the host response
  to Legionella in macrophages. In addition to Naip5 and Nlrc4, Irf1 and Irf8 are
  essential for complete restriction of L. pneumophila replication in mouse macrophages
  by regulating either constitutive transcription of a key component of the Naip5-Nlrc4
  pathway (A) or an inducible transcription activity following signaling by the Naip5-Nlrc4
  pathway (B). Abbreviations: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Lp, L. pneumophila; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; IFNγR, IFN-γ receptor; T4SS, type
  IV secretion system; TLR, Toll-like receptor; Naip5, neuronal anti-apoptotic inhibitor
  protein 5; Nlrc4, Nod-like receptor, CARD domain-containing 4; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription.'
