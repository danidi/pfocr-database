caption: Signaling pathway of protection by tadalafil. Tadalafil, an inhibitor of
  phosphodiesterase, is highly specific for PDE5A and inhibits its activity. cGMP
  is increased upon inhibition of PDE5A. PKG-I is an effector kinase of cGMP and its
  activity is also increased during the early phase of protection. During the late
  phase, STAT3 was phosphorylated upon ischemic stimulus (HR) in the presence of tadalafil.
  It entered into the nucleus and bound to the promoter of PKG-I and thus transcriptionally
  enhanced its expression, which led to the late phase of protection. An increase
  in PKG-I expression by tadalafil, but not its activity, provided protection during
  the late phase. Color images available online at www.liebertpub.com/scd
