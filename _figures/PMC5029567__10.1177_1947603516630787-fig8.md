caption: Schematic diagram of the effects of erythromycin (EM) on interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
  and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced catabolic gene expressions in chondrocytes.
  IL-1β signaling and Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling form a positive regulatory
  loop activate the NF-κB pathway and the expression of catabolic gene such as matrix
  metalloproteinases (MMPs) or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). EM inhibits
  the nucleus translocation of NF-κB/p65 protein, and MMPs and iNOS expression as
  well as the positive loop between IL-1β and TLR4.
