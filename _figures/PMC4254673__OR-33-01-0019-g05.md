caption: Proposed model for the role of autophagy. The process of autophagy is regulated
  by autophagy-related genes (Atg) and their homologs in various eukaryotic cells.
  The diagram shows the primary stages of autophagosome development, including phagophore
  formation, elongation, autophagosome formation and its fusion with the lysosome
  (Pattingre et al, 2008) ().
