caption: 'A model of the role of sphingosine kinase localization on substrate utilization
  and delivery of S1P to specific sites for secretion or loading of intracellular
  effectors. During agonist stimulation SK1 is phosphorylated by ERK1/2, or a related
  kinase, resulting in translocation to the plasma membrane (PM). This translocation
  is mediated by the CIB1 protein and binding to acidic phospholipids. Translocation
  to the PM enhances secretion of S1P, and ultimately S1P binds to a member of the
  S1P receptor (S1PR) family. Additionally, SK1 binds in part to TRAF2 and this may
  load S1P onto TRAF2 to activate the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF2. Similarly,
  the nuclear localization of SK2 is essential for its binding to histones, which
  may optimize the loading of S1P onto histone deacetylases-1 or -2 (HDAC1/2) and
  the subsequent inhibition of histone deacetylase activity. Membrane binding of SK1
  may specify whether the lipid substrate is sphingosine (Sph) (plasma membrane) or
  dihydrosphingosine (DH-Sph)(endoplasmic reticulum, ER). Localization of SK1 at the
  ER diverts dihydrosphingosine from the ceramide biosynthetic pathway. (Note: A color
  version of this figure is available online).'
