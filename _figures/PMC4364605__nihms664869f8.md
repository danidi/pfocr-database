caption: '(A) Basal transmission: the synaptic response, evoked by low-frequency stimulation,
  is due to glutamate activating AMPARs in the ACC.(B) Chronic pain: peripheral nerve
  injury enhances excitatory synaptic transmission through postsynaptic LTP. The activation
  of NMDARs leads to an increase in postsynaptic Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+ binds to calmodulin
  (CaM) and leads to activation of Ca2+-stimulated signaling pathways via AC1. The
  pathway leads to the enhancement of postsynaptic AMPARs containing the GluA1 subunit
  and produces post-LTP.(C) Anxiety: normal anxiety enhances the release of glutamate,
  which feeds back onto presynaptic GluK1 containing KARs. The presynaptic Ca2+ influx
  via GluK1 KARs leads to activation of the AC1-PKA pathway, which then results in
  modulation of HCN channels resulting in a long-lasting increase in glutamate release
  (pre-LTP).(D) Chronic pain and anxiety: nerve injuries and the associated anxiety
  activate both pre-LTP and postsynaptic LTP of excitatory transmission in the ACC.
  The synergistic interaction between pre-LTP and post-LTP underlies the heightened
  behavioral response.'
