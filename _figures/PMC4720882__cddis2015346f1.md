caption: Alcohol and HIV-related neuroinflammation and cytotoxicity contribute astrocyte
  cPLA2 activation into the limelight. Alcohol (EtOH), fat- and water-soluble dangerous
  teratogen, crosses the blood brain barrier, whereas HIV-1 invades the brain via
  infected monocytes. (1) Infected microglia (resident macrophages of the brain) and
  local HIV-1 reservoirs are activated and secrete cytokines, virus and other neurotoxic
  agents, such as viral proteins and ROS/or reactive nitrogen species. (2) Astrocytes,
  in turn, are activated perpetuating neuroinflammation leading to neurodegeneration.
  (3) Our data established that how alcohol and HIV-1 activate astrocytes regulate
  inflammation. EtOH and HIV-1 alone or in combination induce cPLA2 phosphorylation,
  thereby inducing hydrolytic release of AA from membrane phospholipids. (3a) AA is
  metabolized by COX2 and CYP2E1 enzymes into eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin E2
  (PGE2), leading to neuroinflammation via NF-κB. (3b) In addition, EtOH and/or HIV-1
  increased mitochondrial damage, analyzed as mPTP opening. (3c) Arachidonyl-tri-flouro
  methyl ketone (AACOCF3), a cPLA2 specific inhibitor, blocked this signaling process
  thereby diminishing inflammatory responses. (4) We propose that cPLA2signaling is
  a critical regulator in alcohol and HAND co-morbidity and a promising future therapeutic
  target
