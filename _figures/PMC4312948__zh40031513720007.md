caption: 'Role of TRP channels in the vascular system. A: TRP channels expressed in
  endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are involved in various functions
  of ECs and SMCs, including vasorelaxation, vasoconstriction, endothelial permeability,
  myogenic tone regulation, and SMC proliferation. B: schematic diagram illustrating
  endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and agonists as well as stretch/pressure-induced
  vasoconstriction. Activation of TRPV4 or other TRP channels in ECs by shear stress
  induces vasorelaxation through at least 2 pathways: 1) Ca2+ entry-mediated by TRPV4
  activates SKCa and IKCa, leading to hyperpolarization of ECs and relaxation of SMCs
  through myoendothelial coupling (gap junctions); 2) Ca2+ influx via TRP channels
  in ECs enhances the synthesis and release of vasodilator factors such as nitric
  oxide (NO), which can inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) and TRPC6 via cGMP-dependent
  pathway to induce relaxation. In SMCs, TRPV4 activation by EETs or other agonists
  triggers SR Ca2+ release and activation of BKCa, leading to hyperpolarization and
  vasorelaxation. Activation of TRPC channels such as TRPC6 or TRPC3 in SMCs via Gq-linked
  GPCRs stimulation by agonists (ANG II, ET-1, or PE) causes depolarization, and subsequent
  activation of VGCC leading to vasoconstriction. Moreover, stretch or pressure-induced
  activation of TRP channels, such as TRPM4 and TRPP2, can also depolarize SMCs, resulting
  in vasoconstriction.'
