caption: A proposed model for TFA-mediated enhancement of ATP-induced apoptosis. ATP
  binding to the P2X7 receptor leads to the generation of ROS through the activation
  of NADPH oxidases, which subsequently induces the activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway,
  resulting in caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, as we have shown previously ().
  Meanwhile, TFAs promote extracellular ATP-induced p38 activation and apoptosis by
  potentiating activation of ASK1 mediated by CaMKII. The excessive apoptosis by TFAs
  may exceed the phagocytic capacity of macrophages, leading to the development of
  TFA-related disorders, including atherosclerosis.
