caption: Stages of the neuroinflammatory process in which astrocyte calcineurin may
  participate. Initiation, Inflammatory signals set in motion by the neuropathological
  process activate calcineurin, which in turn activate the canonical NFκB/NFAT pathway.
  Activation of local and peripheral proinflammatory mechanisms together with the
  recruitment of autocrine and paracrine neuroprotective mediators follows. The time
  course of this simultaneous anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cascade may be
  critical to the eventual outcome of the inflammatory response. Both agonistic and
  antagonistic inflammatory signals are produced by reactive astrocytes and microglia,
  damaged neurons and activated endothelia, and eventually from peripheral cells recruited
  to the lesion site. Resolution, If already activated calcineurin is stimulated by
  signals such as IGF-I, a neuroprotective network is activated; Progression, if calcineurin
  continues to be activated by inflammatory signals, the inflammation proceeds and
  neurons die. Both phases may be reversibly interrelated depending on the time course
  of the pathological process. Mechanisms whereby calcineurin is recruited toward
  either inflammation or neuroprotection, which involve differential interactions
  with transcription factors such as PPARγ and GATA3 or proteasome degradation and
  which depend on the upstream signal stimulating calcineurin, warrant additional
  analysis.
