caption: The phenazine structure might be derived from the combination of two biosynthetic
  pathways which are phenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) and 4-methoxybenzene-1,2-diol
  (MBD). These two pathways are originated from the shikimic acid pathway. Dehydration
  process between two functional groups of hydroxyl that present in both PDC and MBD
  will form 6-((2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenoxy) carbonyl) phenazine-1-carboxylic acid
  (HCPCA).
