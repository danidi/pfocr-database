caption: Potential targets for immune modulation during chronic progression of implant-related
  bone infections. Biofilm formation skews the immune response toward an anti-inflammatory,
  immune inhibitory and tolerant environment that is associated with high numbers
  of MDSCs, M2 macrophages, and an ineffective T cell response. Immune modulation
  by therapeutic intervention offers the possibility to generate a more effective
  immune response that supports bacterial killing and the reduction of biofilm burden.
  An early inhibition of MDSC activity and the induction of a more pro-inflammatory
  (M1) Mϕ response are potential targets to strengthen innate defense mechanisms.
  Re-stimulation of T cell effector functions by targeting immune checkpoint molecules
  can overcome T cell dysfunction caused by chronic disease progression and might
  prevent re-infection after revision surgery. Targeting TIGIT as well as using DC-based
  vaccination strategies may provide the opportunity to direct T cell polarization
  toward Th1 or Th2 -dominated responses. When boosting the immune system, its impact
  on inflammatory tissue destruction has to be considered as a balance between anti-bacterial
  activity and cytotoxicity is required. CTLA-4 and the TIM-3/galectin-9 pathway are
  important immune regulators that can also be used as checkpoints to control osteoclast
  numbers as a means to reduce bone resorption. MDSCs, myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells; Mϕ, macrophage; DC, dendritic cell; OCs, osteoclasts; ICI, immune checkpoint
  inhibitor; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4; PD-1/PD-L1, programmed
  cell death protein-1/PD ligand-1; LAG-3, lymphocyte activation gene-3; TIM-3, T
  cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein-3; TIGIT, T cell immunoglobulin
  and ITIM domain.
