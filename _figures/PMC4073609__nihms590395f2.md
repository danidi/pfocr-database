caption: 'By activating Sirt1, NAD+ conjoins two feedback loops necessary for cross-talk
  between the circadian clock and metabolite production. The NAD+-salvage pathway
  is important for regulating intracellular NAD+ levels. After the conversion of nicotinamide
  (NAM) into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by NAM phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT),
  NMN is further modified into NAD+ by the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases
  (Nmnat1,-2 and -3). Whereas NAM inhibits Sirt1 activity, NAD+-activated Sirt1 feeds
  back into the NAD+-salvage pathway by directly regulating Nampt gene expression
  in a Clock–Bmal1-dependent manner. By this mechanism, NAD+ conjoins the two feedback
  loops, contributing to the fine tuning necessary for achieving energy balance.EdSumm:
  The mammalian circadian clock controls many biological functions, including metabolic
  activity. In this Perspective, the authors present recent literature and discuss
  the two-way relationship between the clock and metabolism, with NAD+ playing a central
  part in their integration.'
