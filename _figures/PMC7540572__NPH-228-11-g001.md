caption: The tricin biosynthetic pathway from the key pathway‐branching intermediate,
  p‐coumaroyl‐CoA, with generic enzymes in grasses noted in green (Lam et al., ; Eloy
  et al., ), and in red are those from Medicago sativa (Ms) and M. truncatula (Mt)
  from the paper published in this issue of New Phytologist by . (pp. 269–284). Note
  that the pathway via tricetin (light gray) has been ruled out in rice and presumably
  other grasses (Lam et al., ). As noted by ., the FNS enzyme (in orange) responsible
  for converting naringenin to apigenin (via 2‐hydroxynaringenin) was earlier determined
  to be via MtFNSII. Also shown is the general pathway into the hydroxystilbenes,
  including resveratrol and piceatannol, that have also served as lignin monomers
  in various endocarp tissue cell walls (del Río et al., , ). It remains unclear whether
  piceatannol can derive from resveratrol, or if it is formed directly using STS from
  caffeoyl‐CoA, itself derived from p‐coumaroyl‐CoA via the monolignol pathway C3′H.
  On the left hand side (bold downward arrow) is the abbreviated pathway from p‐coumaroyl‐CoA
  to the monolignols (with enzymes simply shown, abbreviated, on the arrow); these
  pathways and enzymes have often been reviewed, most recently by Vanholme et al.
  (). The relatively newly understood pathways from the monolignols to their various
  acylated analogs are shown in the bottom left of the figure; BAHD transferases for
  p‐coumaroylation and feruloylation of monolignols have been revealed and reviewed
  (Vanholme et al., ); these acylated monolignols are also ‘monomers’ in lignification
  and in fact the available acetate and p‐coumarate conjugates in corn have been shown
  to combinatorially, along with the monolignols, couple with tricin to form variously
  acylated flavono‐oligolignols and polymeric flavonolignins (Lan et al., ).
