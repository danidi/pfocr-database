caption: Overview of the canonical hippo signaling pathway. Signals such as mechanical
  stress, and GPCR can activate Mst1/2, bound with Sav1 through the SARAH domain.
  The activated Mst1/2 kinases phosphorylate and activate Lats1/2, which can interact
  with YAP through their respective PPxY and WW domains. Lats1/2 then phosphorylate
  YAP, which traps it in the cytoplasm upon binding to 14-3-3. This results in the
  loss of YAP function, which is involved in promoting the transcription of cell proliferation-related
  genes.
