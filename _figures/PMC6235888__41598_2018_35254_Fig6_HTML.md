caption: 'Schematic pathway summarizing the manipulation of GAL via the activation
  of α7 nAChR to mediate its anti-inflammatory effect. GAL mediated its anti-inflammatory
  effect by inhibiting the IL-18-IL-6/ p-JAK2/ p-STAT3/ SOCS3 and NF-κB/ HMGB-1/ IL-18
  trajectories. This was associated with improvement in kidney function (Cr, Cys-C,
  IL-18, NGAL) and histological structure. The beneficial renocurative effect of GAL
  was abolished by the use of MLA in ZYM-induced AKI in BALB/c mice. SOCS3 works as
  negative feedback pathway to inhibit IL-6/ STAT3, while here GAL inhibited SOCS3
  possibly due to the ability of GAL to directly inhibit IL-6, which does not necessitate
  the activation of SOCS3. ACh: acetylcholine; AKI: acute kidney injury; CAP: cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory pathway; Cr: creatinine; Cys-C: cystatin-C; GAL: galantamine;
