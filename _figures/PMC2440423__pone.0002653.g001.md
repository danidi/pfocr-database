caption: The three key regulatory enzymes in ganglioside biosynthesis, GM3 synthase
  (1), GD3 synthase ((2) from the ST8SIA1gene), and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
  ( GalNAcT) are shown. Ganglioside biosynthesis initiates with a stepwise glycosylation
  of ceramide (cer) to form glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and lactosylceramide (LacCer)
  mediated by the enzyme ceramide glucosyltransferase (CGT) and lactosylceramide synthase
  (LCS) respectively . The action of different sialyltransferases converts LacCer
  into gangliosides GM3 and then GD3G. Sequential addition of N-acetylgalactosamine
  (GalNac), galactose and sialic acid residues generate the a-series and b-series
  respectively.
