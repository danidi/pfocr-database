caption: Environmental regulation of GSC proliferation at developmental stages of
  the gonad. During L1, starvation conditions reduce canonical DAF-2/IIR signaling
  that depends upon both AGE-1/PI3K and AKT-1 but is independent of DAF-16/FOXO, resulting
  in loss of GSC proliferation (). Persistent NOS-1 and NOS-2 activity during starvation
  conditions also prevent GSC proliferation during L1 arrest (), although whether
  DAF-2/IIR signaling regulates NOS-1 and NOS-2 is unknown. During the establishment
  of dauer during L2D, DAF-7/TGFβ and DAF-2/IIR signaling is reduced, resulting in
  the activation of DAF-18/PTEN, AAK-2/AMPK, and PAR-4/LKB1. PAR-4/LKB-1 activates
  AAK-1 and at least one other target which collectively prevent GSC proliferation.
  After dauer is well established, DAF-16/FOXO is necessary to maintain the control
  of GSC proliferation (). During L3 and L4, nutritional availability is potentially
  mediatedby INS-3 and INS-33 ligands activating DAF-2/IIR signaling using the canonical
  pathway to promote optimal GSC proliferation (). If starvation is sensed during
  late L4, NHR-49 steroid signaling induces ARD by undetermined pathways to prevent
  GSC proliferation (). Adult GSCs will also cease to proliferate in response to DNA
  damage in a CEP-1/p53 and PHG-1/Gas-1 dependent manner () that is held in check
  by VRK-1 activity during periods with low genotoxic stress (). [Parts of this diagram
  are modified from () and ().]
