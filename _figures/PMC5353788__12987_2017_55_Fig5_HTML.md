caption: Prevention of BBB dysfunction by targeting Mrp isoforms at the BBB. Results
  from our present study demonstrate increased mRNA expression of Abcc1, Abcc2, and
  Abcc4 at the BBB following an H/R insult. Furthermore, H/R stress is known to suppress
  GSH levels and increase GSSG concentrations in the brain. We propose that changes
  in GSH/GSSG transport occur during H/R as a result of altered functional expression
  of at least one Mrp isoform. Since Nrf2, a ROS sensitive transcription factor, is
  known to regulate Mrps, we hypothesize that this pathway is a critical regulatory
  mechanism for Mrps at the BBB. Our present data show involvement of Nrf2 signalling
  in regulation of Abcc mRNA transcript expression in rat brain microvessels following
  H/R. Future studies are ongoing in our laboratory to determine the functional implications
  of this observation, particularly with respect to GSH transport and redox balance
  at the BBB. Mrp isoforms where BBB localization has not been confirmed are indicated
  by (question mark)
