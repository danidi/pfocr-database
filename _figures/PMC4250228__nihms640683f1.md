caption: Previously, it was reported that PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation promoted
  proteolysis of RAF kinases thereby inhibiting MAPK pathway activation. In this work,
  Mazur et al. claim that, in cells expressing mutationally activated KRAS, the magnitude
  of ERK1/2, JNK and ERK5 MAPK activation is dependent on SMYD3-mediated methylation
  of lysine 260 of MAP3K2. However, the mechanism(s) by which mutated KRAS promote
  activity of the SMYD3→MAP3K2 signaling axis is not clear. In principle, there may
  be a direct biochemical link between KRAS and SMYD3→MAP3K2 signaling or the activity
  of this pathway may be sustained by an autocrine circuit due to KRAS-mediated induction
  of members of the EGF family of ligands (e.g. HB-EGF) or through secretion of inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g. IL-6).
