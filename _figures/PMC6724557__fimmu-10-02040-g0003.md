caption: Model of TNFR2-mediated regulation of NFκB transcriptions factors in Tregs.
  In absence of appropriate exogenous stimuli, the classical NFκB pathway is not active
  (Left). Constitutively active cytosolic TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complexes K48-ubiquitinate
  NIK and cRel triggering so the proteasomal degradation of these proteins (Left).
  This not only dampens the activity of the NIK-dependent alternative NFκB pathway
  to low basal levels but also diminishes the amount of cRel-containing dimers, which
  can be activated via the classical NFκB pathway. Since p100 can inhibit cRel- and
  RelA-containing NFκB dimers, it might also reduce the responsibility of the classical
  NFκB pathway. TNFR2 activation by memTNF results in the recruitment of TRAF-cIAP1/2
  complexes and activation of the IKK-dependent classical NFκB pathway (Right). The
  depletion of the cytosolic TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complexes associated herewith leads to
  reduced degradation of NIK and cRel, thus (i) to enhanced alternative NFκB signaling
  and (ii) more cRel-containing NFκB dimers that can respond to the classical NFκB
  pathway (Right). The model is based on what is known about the specific functions
  of NFκBs in Tregs and the mechanisms of TNFR2 signaling in general.
