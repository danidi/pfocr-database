caption: Oxidative Stress and PD pathobiology. Free radicals can arise as a result
  of glial cell activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, or protein aggregation. Increased
  microglial activation is attributable to increased neuronal cell death and cell
  debris including aggregated proteins. Microglial-derived NO and superoxide (•O−2)
  species react in extracellular spaces to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Peroxynitrite
  readily crosses cell membranes where it contributes to lipid peroxidation, DNA damage,
  and nitrotyrosine formation in α-syn and other cellular proteins. Damaged proteins
  are targeted to cellular proteosomes for degradation via the ubiquitin pathway.
  Excessive protein damage caused by oxidants and disruptions in the ubiquitin pathways
  may overload or inhibit protein degradation quality control measures leading to
  the accumulation of damaged proteins in cells. When reactive species exceed antioxidant
  defenses, oxidative stress is generated, destroying molecular structures, such as
  proteins, lipids, and DNA, causing irreversible and detrimental damage, neuronal
  cell injury and death. Adapted from Gao et al. (47). (For interpretation of the
  references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
