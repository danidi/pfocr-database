caption: The CoA biosynthetic pathway. The commitment step is the phosphorylation
  of pantothenate (Vitamin B5) by pantothenate kinase (PANK) to 4′-phosphopantothenate.
  This is followed by condensation with cysteine catalyzed by 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine
  synthase (PPCS) and then decarboxylation to form 4′-phosphopantetheine by 4′-phosphopanthenoylcysteine
  decarboxylase (PPCDC). 4′-Phosphopantetheine is adenylylated to dephospho-CoA by
  phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT), then phosphorylated by dephospho-CoA
  kinase (DPCK) at the 3′-OH of the ribose to form CoA.
