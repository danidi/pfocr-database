caption: The role of K63-linked polyubiquitination in the activation of canonical
  and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. In both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB
  pathways, ligand binding to receptors results in the recruitment of the TNF receptor-associated
  factors (TRAFs) to the receptors. In the canonical pathway, the recruitment of E3
  ligase TRAF6promotesits auto-polyubiquitinating and other neighboring target proteins
  via K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Unanchored free K63-linked polyubiquitin then
  directly activate TAK1 kinase, which then phosphorylates and activates IKK-β to
  induce NF- κB activation. In the non-canonical pathway, TRAF3, TRAF2, and cIAP promote
  rapid proteasomal degradation of NIK by the ubiquitin–proteasome system under un-stimulated
  condition. Various stimuli release NIK from TRAF3 inhibition by triggering cIAP
  activation by TRAF2-mediated K63-polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of
  TRAF3. NIK-mediated-phosphorylation of p100 and its subsequent processing promotes
  RelB/p52 nuclear translocation and NF- κB activation.
