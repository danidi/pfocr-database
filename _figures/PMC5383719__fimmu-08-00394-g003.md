caption: Low-avidity signaling of β2-integrin regulates toll-like receptors (TLR)
  signaling in macrophages. (A) Inside-out signals are initiated by TLR4 activation
  through phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and effector RapL β2-integrin by
  separation of the cytoplasmic domains of α- and β-integrin chains. (B) β2-integrin
  signals in a low-avidity (without even ligand binding) outside-in manner through
  ITAM-associated activation of the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) pathway, which induces
  phosphorylation of Tyr227 on MyD88 and of Tyr375 on TRIF. TLR4 signaling is regulated
  by Cbl-b-mediated degradation of MyD88 and TRIF. Skewed position of β2-integrin
  indicates conformational changes after separation of the cytoplasmic domains α and
  β. (C) Cbl-b associates with CD2-associated protein (CD2AP, CIN85) and enhances
  the ubiquitination and degradation of SYK and FcεRIγ. Ubiquitinated MyD88 and TRIF
  are degraded by the proteasome.
