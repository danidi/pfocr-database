caption: The diagram depicts the different strategies by which AHR function is controlled.
  In the canonical pathway, AHR activation is induced by exogenous or endogenous ligand
  binding, nuclear translocation, and recruitment to XREs in partnership with the
  Arnt protein. AHR signaling is silenced by one of several mechanisms, including
  1) induction of CYP1A1 and subsequent metabolic clearance of the ligand pool, 2)
  expression of the AHR repressor (AHRR), and 3) AHR degradation through the 26S proteosome.
  AHR activity is also influenced by the distinct properties of the bound agonists
  (depicted by the open diamond) which can alter the repertoire of responsive target
  genes.
