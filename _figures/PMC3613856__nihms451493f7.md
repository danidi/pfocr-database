caption: LH signaling through its receptor activates cAMP/PKA followed by the ERK
  pathway, leading to increased levels of LRBP. LRBP binds to the coding region of
  LHR mRNA in the ribosomes, to form an untranslatable ribonucleoprotein complex.
  LRBP also associates with the p body components such as DCP1A and rck/p54 resulting
  in the p body localization of LRBP-LHR mRNP complex. This is accompanied by the
  dissociation of eIF4E from the cap structure. In the next step, LHR mRNA undergoes
  decapping in the p bodies initiated by the enzyme DCP2. This leads to the 5’-3’
  exonuclease (XRN1) mediated degradation of LHR mRNA, in the final step.
