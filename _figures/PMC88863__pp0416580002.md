caption: Model for changes in epidermal cell  differentiation in response to P and
  Fe stress. Fe and P deficiency can  cause the formation of extra root hairs. Under
  Fe-deficient conditions,  root hair initiation is dependent on the ethylene signaling
  cascade. A  possible auxin response pathway including AUX1 and/or AXR1 may  represent
  a further pathway in which ethylene acts. Initiation of root  hairs is inhibited
  in mutants defective in ethylene signaling and in  those harboring defects in AUX1,
  AXR1, and AXR2, and by substances that  interfere either with ethylene synthesis
  or perception. Root hair  initiation induced by P deficiency is not affected in
  the respective  mutants and application of hormone antagonists implying that these  responses
  are controlled by an ethylene-independent pathway. This  pathway may be defined
  by transcription factors that can induce  expression of ethylene-response genes.
  Primary ethylene responsive  genes like ERF1 are assumed to be part of the  ethylene-dependent
  pathway. Adapted from figures in  and .
