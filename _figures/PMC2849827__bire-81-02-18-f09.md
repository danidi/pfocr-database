caption: The proposed role of VEGFA in endometrial epithelial cell proliferation and
  stromal remodeling. As E2 levels rise during proestrus (or in response to exogenous
  E2 in immature or ovariectomized animals), Vegfa is expressed by LE cells (Phase
  1). VEGFA induces a large increase in the permeability of stromal microvessels,
  flooding the stroma with plasma, the edema that is the sine qua non of the early
  effects of E2 on the uterus (Phase 2). The plasma is rich in growth factors such
  as IGF1 and carries additional E2 bound to serum proteins. Growth factors and E2
  act in concert to induce maximal LE cell proliferation (Phase 3). The plasma also
  contains plasminogen that triggers the collagenolytic cascade and the degradation
  of the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as fibrinogen, which is converted
  to fibrin, creating a temporary matrix that promotes cell proliferation, cell migration,
  and angiogenesis []. The E2 also primes stromal fibroblasts for later proliferation
  in response to progesterone.
