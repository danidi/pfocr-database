caption: '(A) A schematic comparison of hydrogenotrophic and methanogenic metabolism
  with that of A. fulgidus. The Wolfe cycle of autotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogens
  without cytochromes is shaded in red. The Mvh:Hdr is the only known ferredoxin-reducing
  complex present in A. fulgidus. A pathway analogs to the Wolfe cycle is indicated
  in orange—if Fdred is required for either APS or SO2−3 reduction, prior to the reduction
  of di-thiol (X-SH HS-X), an anaplerotic ferredoxin-reducing hydrogenase is required.
  (B) An overview of alternative complexes for Fd reduction (dotted borders), which
  are absent in A. fulgidus. Most methanogens and SRP maintain several of these complexes.
  The Wolfe cycle requires an anaplerotic ferredoxin (Fd)-reducing hydrogenase (Ech/Eha),
  in order to fixate carbon in anabolic processes. (C) Putative mechanisms for generation
  of F420H2. Complexes absent in A. fulgidus outlined in (B): the electron bifurcating
  [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase (Huang et al., ), the Rnf complex (Biegel et al., ; Tremblay
  et al., ), the energy converting hydrogenase (Ech), (C): the F420-reducing hydrogenase
  (Frh) (Thauer et al., ).'
