caption: 'Mevalonate pathway depicting inhibition of downstream intermediate molecules
  resulting from statin inhibition of mevalonate synthesis. Mevalonate is not only
  precursor of cholesterol synthesis but also host of other molecules downstream such
  isopentenylpyrophosphate, farnesylpyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, dolichols
  etc., Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes conversion HMG-CoA to mevalonate.
  Inhibition of these intermediates leads depletion of various essential molecules
  cause adverse effects of statins. CoQ: Coenzyme Q; IGF-1: Insulin-like growth factor-1;
  LXR: Liver X-receptor'
