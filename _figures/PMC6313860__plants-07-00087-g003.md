number: Figure 3
caption: Components of CLV-WUS signaling pathways and their functions in model and
  crop plants. Proteins with characterized genetic and/or biochemical interactions
  are listed. Unidentified peptides and receptors are denoted by question marks. Arrows
  depict positive regulation and bars depict negative regulation. SAM, shoot apical
  meristem; FM, floral meristem; VM, vegetative meristem; IFM, inflorescence meristem.
