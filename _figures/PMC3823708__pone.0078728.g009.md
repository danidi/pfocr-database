caption: NF-κB and STAT3 are competent to ensure activation of themselves and each
  other, either in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. Upon stimulation with TNF-α,
  the NF-κB pathway becomes activated, as shown by the phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB p65 and transcription of NF-κB genes, including IL-6 and
  LIF. Newly synthesized IL-6 is secreted by the cells, and binds in an autocrine
  or paracrine manner to the IL-6 receptor. This leads to activation of the IL-6R/gp130
  complex and the intracellular kinases JAK1/2. STAT3 proteins then become phosphorylated
  by JAK1/2, dimerize, enter the nucleus and begin the transcription of STAT3 driven
  genes such as SOCS3 and cIAP2.
