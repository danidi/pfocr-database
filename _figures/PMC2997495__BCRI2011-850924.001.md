caption: The biosynthesis of Moco and the families of molybdoenzymes. Shown is a scheme
  of the biosynthetic pathway of Moco from MPT in bacteria. The proteins involved
  in the reactions are colored red. In bacteria, Mo-MPT can be further modified by
  the MobA function which attaches GMP to the phosphate group of MPT, forming MGD,
  and two equivalents of MGD are bound to molybdenum, forming the so-called bis-MGD
  cofactor. For enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family, Mo-MPT or MCD (which is synthesized
  by the MocA protein by the attachment of CMP to Mo-MPT) can be modified by the replacement
  of one oxo-ligand by a sulfur ligand while forming the mono-oxo Moco. This reaction
  is catalyzed by a NifS-like protein in bacteria. The three molybdenum-containing
  enzyme families are divided into the DMSO reductase, the sulfite oxidase, and the
  xanthine oxidase families according to their active-site structures. The molybdenum
  center is shown in its oxidized state as MoVI. Moco is the general term for all
  different variants of the cofactor.
