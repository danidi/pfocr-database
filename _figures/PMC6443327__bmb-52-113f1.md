caption: The scheme of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation pathway. (A) Protein SUMOylation
  is associated with a recycling system consisting of conjugation and deconjugation
  pathways. Both conjugation and deconjugation enzymes mediate the dynamic and reversible
  process of SUMOylation. The protein SUMOylation alters protein activation, transcriptional
  activity, stability, and localization change. (B) SUMO proteins covalently modify
  certain residues of specific target substrates and change the function of these
  substrates. The conjugation pathway is mediated by SUMO E1, E2, E3 enzymes, whereas
  the deconjugation pathway is mediated by SUMOisopeptidase, SENPs.
