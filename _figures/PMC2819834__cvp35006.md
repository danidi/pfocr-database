caption: Proposed model for 17β-estradiol effect on human MMP-2 promoter activity
  mediated by ERα and MAP Kinase-ERK1/2 signalling pathway. Activation of ERα and
  MAP Kinase-ERK1/2 signalling pathway by 17β-estradiol mediates phosphorylation of
  the transcription factor Elk-1. The binding of phosphorylated Elk-1 leads to recruitment
  of co-repressor(s) and results into down-regulation of MMP-2 transcriptional activity.
  ICI 182,780 and PD98059 inhibit the 17β-estradiol mediated phosphorylation of Elk-1
  by blocking estrogen receptors and MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway, resulting in normal MMP2-promoter
  activity.
