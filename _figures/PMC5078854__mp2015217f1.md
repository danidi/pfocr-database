caption: Metabolic pathway of citrate and isocitrate on the citric acid cycle in the
  mitochondrial matrix and in the cytosol. ACO1 and ACO2 are localized in the cytosol
  and the mitochondrial matrix, respectively. ACO1 interconverts citrate and isocitrate
  in the cytosol, allowing the cell to balance the amount of NADPH generated from
  isocitrate by IDH1. ACO2 is an enzyme that catalyzes citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate
  in the citric acid cycle. IDH1 is localized in the cytosol, and IDH2 and IDH3 are
  found in the mitochondrial matrix. The IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes catalyze a redox reaction
  that converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (also known as 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)),
  while reducing NADP+ to NADPH and liberating CO2. The mitochondrial IDH3 enzyme
  is an essential element of the citric acid cycle, catalyzing the oxidation of isocitrate
  to α-ketoglutarate with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The electron transfer chain
  (ETC) in the mitochondrial membrane is a series of complexes, I–V, that transfer
  electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions.
