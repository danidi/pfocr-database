caption: The miRNA biosynthetic and processing pathway is diagrammed to illustrate
  the stages at which different genetic disruptions can be made. While genetic knock-out
  (KO) by random or targeted disruption of miRNA eliminates expression completely,
  such mutations offer conditional loss-of-function only in conjunction with other
  systems (e.g. mosaic technologies such as Cre-loxP, Flip-FRT, etc.). Antisense oligonucleotides
  (e.g. LNA morpholino) can block miRNA processing at the pri-miRNA stage to prevent
  processing to the pre-miRNA form, or later at the level of mature miRNA. Disruption
  of the Drosha/Pasha microprocessor also prevents formation of pre-miRNA, whereas
  disruption of Dicer block subsequent formation of mature miRNA. Finally, several
  genetically encoded antagomer techniques can compete with miRNA or target gene mRNAs
  to reduce the level of mature miRNAs or the number of miRNA-mRNA complexes. The
  most widely tested techniques are miRNA sponges (SP), tough decoys (TuD) and target
  protectors (TP).
