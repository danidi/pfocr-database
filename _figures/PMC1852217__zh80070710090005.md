caption: Proposed roles of HRI signaling pathway in stress erythropoiesis. Upon stress
  in erythroid cells, HRI is activated first to inhibit protein synthesis in order
  to reduce toxic globin precipitates. We propose that HRI also participates in the
  second arm of defense by increasing expression of specific genes such as Chop and
  GADD34, necessary for the adaptation to stress conditions. However, when the stress
  is insurmountable, this signaling pathway can also lead to apoptosis. In the absence
  of HRI, excess globins form inclusions and lead to hemolysis as well as apoptosis
  of erythroid precursors. Consequently, ineffective erythropoiesis occurs.
