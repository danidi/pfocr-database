caption: Transition to endocycles in Drosophila. (A) In follicle cells, the Notch
  signaling pathway blocks entrance into mitosis by inhibiting transcription of string,
  the gene encoding the protein phosphatase required for activation of Cdk1, as well
  as the genes encoding mitotic cyclins, and activates transcription of fzr, the gene
  required for APC(Fzr) activity. (B) In cells programmed for endoreduplication, inhibition
  of Cdk1 activity results in premature assembly of APC(Fzr), a ubiquitin ligase that
  operates in the absence of CDK activity and that targets Cyclins A and B as well
  as Geminin for degradation by the 26S proteasome (→Ø). Thus, a feedback loop exists
  that reinforces inhibition of Cdk1 activity triggered by endocycle entry. In the
  absence of Geminin and CDK-dependent protein phosphorylation, preRC assembly occurs
  as though cells had entered G1-phase. In Drosophila, ORC is essential for mitotic
  cell cycles in both the central nervous system and imaginal discs, and for gene
  amplification in ovarian follicle cells. Remarkably, however, ORC does not appear
  to be required for endoreduplication in the salivary gland. Since Double-parked
  (Dup) and the MCM DNA helicase are both required for endoreduplication under these
  conditions, an alternative mechanism for initiation of DNA replication may exist
  in some cell types. Symbols are as in . Inhibition of the target protein is indicated
  by (⊥).
