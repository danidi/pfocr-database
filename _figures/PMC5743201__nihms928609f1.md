caption: eNOS generates basal levels of NO, which activate sGC; this in turn leads
  to cGMP production and subsequent activation of cGMP-dependent PKG. Activated PKG
  causes vasorelaxation and inhibits pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation
  which underlies the mechanisms of pulmonary vascular remodeling, and thereby preserves
  normal pulmonary tension. Decreased NO bioavailability leading to impaired PKG activity
  is a common feature of PH. FDA-approved drugs by activating sGC (Riociguat) or inhibiting
  PDE5-mediated cGMP degradation (Sildenafil, Tadalafil) have been shown effectiveness
  in improving the symptom of PH and promoting modest survival, demonstrating the
  fundamental role of this signaling pathway in maintaining pulmonary vascular homeostasis.
  cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; GTP,
  guanosine triphosphate; NO, nitric oxide; PKG, protein kinase G; sGC, soluble guanylate
  cyclase.
