caption: Disruption of iron–sulfur (Fe–S) proteins can have a myriad of deleterious
  cellular consequences. Because Fe–S clusters are essential electron carriers and
  enzyme cofactors in many proteins, defects in Fe–S clusters biogenesis can disrupt
  many cellular process. (a) Fe–S clusters are essential cofactors in energy metabolism.
  Fe–S proteins are among the most important electron carriers in nature and are particularly
  important in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in which up to 12 different Fe–S
  clusters shuttle electrons through complexes I–III. Electrons from the oxidation
  of NADH and succinate are transferred through a chain of redox centers consist of
  flavins, Fe–S clusters, ubiquinone (Q and QH2), hemes and copper centers (CuA and
  CuB) to reduce O2 to H2O. The free energy of electron transport is coupled to ATP
  synthesis. In addition, the ability of Fe–S clusters to coordinate ligands and stabilize
  protein structures also allows them to facilitate various enzymatic functions. For
  instance, mitochondrial aconitase is an integral part of the tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA cycle), and its [4 Fe–4S] cluster is essential for substrate binding
  and activation. (b) Because Fe–S proteins play a critical role in a wide range of
  cellular activities, mutations or pathological conditions that disrupt Fe–S cluster
  stability or biogenesis/repair are associated with several human diseases. For instance,
  germline mutations of the gene encoding succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB),
  a Fe–S protein in respiratory complex II, are a major cause of cancer of the kidney,
  adrenal gland and thyroid gland []. Mutations that destabilize the Fe–S clusters
  in DNA repair enzymes XPD and FancJ are associated with the phenotypes in patients
  with trichothiodystrophy and Fanconi anemia respectively []. Severe defects in Fe–S
  cluster biogenesis/repair can profoundly decrease the activities of respiratory
  complexes, the TCA cycle and the heme biosynthesis pathway [–], resulting in decreased
  energy production and increased oxidative stress. In addition, disruption of Fe–S
  cluster biogenesis can lead to mitochondrial iron overload and cytosolic iron depletion.
  In the cytosol, defects in Fe–S cluster biogenesis might affect cytosolic aconitase
  (c-aconitase) activity and therefore citrate metabolism, which can disrupt the balance
  between glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis. Defects in cytosolic Fe–S cluster
  biogenesis/repair might also impair ribosome biogenesis, and purine catabolism pathways.
