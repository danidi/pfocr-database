caption: Model for genotype-specific basis for reprogramming competence. (A) Simplified
  network for gamete fate specification in wild-type XX adults. The sex determination
  pathway is set to the female mode and oocyte fate specification; MAP kinase activity
  is low and therefore does not promote the sperm fate; PUF-8 and FBF-1 promote the
  oocyte fate via repression of both sex determination and MAP kinase pathways as
  well as repression of terminal gamete fate regulators fog-1 and fog-3. This model
  is based largely on established regulatory relationships, but also posits the existence
  of a PUF hub composed of PUF-8 and FBF-1 RNA-binding proteins. Relevant MPK-1 substrates
  are not known, but FOG-1 and FOG-3 proteins are candidates. See text for further
  explanation and references. (B) Model for sperm/oocyte specification in mutants
  with a reprogramming competent genotype (puf-8; lip-1 and fbf-1; lip-1). Without
  drug (left), germlines are set to the male mode of sperm fate specification. The
  PUF hub operates at reduced strength because one PUF protein is removed, and MAP
  kinase is hyperactivated because lip-1 is removed; the reduced-strength PUF hub
  is postulated to generate a sexually intermediate molecular signature. With drug
  (right), the U0126 MEK inhibitor reduces MAP kinase hyperactivation and permits
  the reduced-strength PUF hub to drive the oocyte fate. (C) Model for sperm/oocyte
  specification in mutants with a noncompetent genotype (puf-8 fbf-1; lip-1 depicted
  here). Without drug (left) or with drug (right), elimination of the PUF hub prevents
  oocyte fate specification regardless of MAP kinase activity. A similar explanation
  would hold for puf-8 fbf-1, which would not experience the hyperactivated ERK/MAPK
  depicted here for puf-8 fbf-1; lip-1.
