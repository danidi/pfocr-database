caption: Bradykinin and kallidin, generated by the action of plasma or tissue kallikrein
  on precursor high-molecular-weight (HMW) or low-molecular-weight (LMW) kininogen,
  are ligands of the B2R. They are converted to corresponding agonists of the B1R
  by removal of the C-terminal Arg by membrane-bound carboxypeptidase M (CPM), which
  interacts with the B1R, or soluble plasma carboxypeptidase N (CPN). The B2R is constitutively
  expressed whereas B1R expression is induced by injury or inflammatory conditions.
  Both the B2R and B1R can couple through either Gαq/11 or Gαi/o to release downstream
  mediators such as intracellular Ca2+, NO and arachidonic acid, which leads to generation
  of prostaglandins and other metabolites such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (which
  can act as endothelial derived hyperpolarizing factor). On endothelial cells, activation
  of B2Rs results in Gαq/11 and Ca2+–calmodulin–dependent activation of eNOS as well
  as Akt activation and phosphorylation of Ser1177 (as well as other sites not shown),
  dephosphorylation of Thr495 and generation of NO. However, in endothelial cells
  under inflammatory conditions, B1R stimulation results in much higher and prolonged
  NO production via Gαi, Gβγ and Src-dependent activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway
  leading to activation of iNOS via phosphorylation at Ser745. See text for further
  details.
