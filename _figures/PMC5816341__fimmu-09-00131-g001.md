caption: (A) Schematic diagram of the three pathways of the complement system, highlighting
  the upregulator (properdin) and downregulator (factor H) of the alternative pathway.
  The three complement systems, the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways merge
  in C5 convertase. C5 convertase cleaves C5 forming C5b, which combines with C6,
  C7, C8, and C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). Activation of the classical
  pathway occurs upon recognition and binding of targets via C1q, which in turn activates
  C1r and C1s, and C1s cleaves C4 and C2. The lectin pathway is activated when mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL) or ficolins bind to microbial surfaces or other targets, and this binding
  activates MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), similar to C1s, which cleave
  C4 and C2. Classical and lectin pathway cleaved products of C4 and C2 form C3 convertase
  (C4bC2a), which cleaves C3 into C3b, the major opsonin of the complement system,
  binds covalently to targets. C3b also binds to C4b2a, altering its substrate preference
  to cleave C5 and thus forming C5 convertase C4b2a3b, which cleaves C5 into C5a and
  C5b. C5b assembles with C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form the MAC, which can cause disruption
  or lysis of target cells. The alternative pathway C3 convertase C3bBb is a homolog
  of C4b2a. It is formed by slow hydrolysis of C3 to form C3(H2O), which is similar
  to C3b in conformation. C3(H2O) forms a complex with factor B (FB), and FB in the
  complex is cleaved to form C3(H2O)Bb, plus Ba, by factor D (FD). C3(H2O)Bb itself
  cleaves C3 to form C3a plus C3b, and C3b then reacts with FB and FD to form C3bBb,
  in the same way as C3(H2O)Bb is formed. C3bBb is unstable, but is stabilized by
  properdin, which holds together the C345C domain in C3b and the vWF domain in Bb,
  and also repositions the thioester-containing domain in C3b that is involved in
  the decay process of C3 convertase. (B) Representative diagram of the modular organization
  of human properdin including thrombospondin repeats. Properdin is found in serum
  as monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers of a polypeptide made up of seven thrombospondin
  type I repeat (TSR) domains. It enhances alternative pathway activation by stabilization
  of C3 and C5 convertases. TSR0 is the N-terminal TSR. TSR4 and TSR5 modules expressed
  in tandem in E. coli have also been depicted.
