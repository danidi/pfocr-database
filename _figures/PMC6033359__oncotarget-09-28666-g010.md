caption: ZRF1 plays an important role in the progression of breast invasive ductal
  carcinoma into a more aggressive form. A decrease in ZRF1 protein levels results
  in decreased cell adhesion and significantly increased cell invasion capacities
  in vitro. ZRF1 has both stimulating and inhibiting effects on single cell migration
  depending on the experimental approach. However, in conditions where cells are migrating
  as clusters, such as in wound healing, ZRF1 increases cell motility. Furthermore,
  ZRF1 depletion contributes to drug resistance by decreasing cell death levels by
  disrupting the balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic genes and by promoting
  cell survival through the PI3K/AKT pathway.
