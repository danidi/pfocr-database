caption: For simplicity, only two homologous DNA molecules are represented, one red
  and one blue. The 3′ DNA end is identified by an arrow when appropriate. Newly synthesized
  DNA is represented as a dotted line. After a DSB is made, 5′ to 3′ end resection
  followed by 3′ end invasion of an intact homoduplex DNA molecule are common steps
  to all recombination pathways. Three major recombination pathways are distinguished
  according to the intermediates formed. On the left, after 3′ end invasion, DNA synthesis
  extends the invading end prior to the dismantling of this evanescent intermediate.
  The DSB is eventually repaired after annealing of the two ends, and gap fill in
  (a) (SDSA model, ). This pathway generates exclusively NCOs with only one hDNA tract.
  Both ends of a DSB can formally engage in two independent SDSA reactions, generating
  also a NCO but with two hDNA tracts distributed on the same chromatid in a trans
  configuration (b). In the middle, after 3′ end invasion, a stable SEI intermediate
  is formed and is processed into a double Holliday junction-containing intermediate.
  dHJ resolution can formally lead to CO if the four nicks (arrowheads) cleave four
  different DNA strands (e), or NCO if the four nicks affect only two DNA strands
  (d) (these two pathways illustrate the canonical DSBR model ). Note that filled
  and unfilled arrowheads illustrate the two possible resolutions of the same dHJ.
  The crossover point is defined by the two vertical arrowheads. The top CO pattern
  therefore corresponds to resolution by the filled arrowheads, and the bottom CO
  pattern corresponds to resolution by the unfilled arrowheads. Both COs and NCOs
  resulting from dHJ resolution present two hDNA tracts distributed on the two non-sister
  chromatids involved in the repair reaction. Alternatively, a dHJ can be dissolved
  by the combined action of a helicase and a type I topoisomerase and give rise to
  a NCO with two hDNA tracts on the same chromatid in a trans configuration (c). On
  the right, after 3′ end invasion, a less stable intermediate than the aforementioned
  SEI is formed and contains two nicked HJs (f). Structure-specific endonucleases
  like Mus81 can process such an intermediate into a CO with two hDNA tracts distributed
  on the two non-sister chromatids involved in the repair reaction, as for the canonical
  DSBR model (f). The notation 5:3_5:3* stands for two consecutive half conversions
  or hDNA tracts with the same global strand asymmetry but with different strand distributions.
  Trans hDNAs are defined by two such hDNA tracts on the same chromatid, while dHJ
  resolution leads to two such hDNA tracts on two non-sister chromatids.
