caption: NF-κB activation pathway. The diagram illustrates essential components of
  the NF-κB pathway. Briefly, stimulus induces recruitment of adaptor proteins and
  ligases, such as TNF-r Associated Factor-6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 is polyubiquitinated and
  acts as a ubiquitin ligase facilitating recruitment of other signaling molecules,
  notably the serine kinase TAK1 and its adaptor proteins TAB1/2. Aided by the polyubiquitination
  network, NEMO and its IKK1 and IKK2 partners are recruited to the TRAF6-TAK1 complex.
  TAK1 then phosphorylates IKK2 which in turn phosphorylates IκB leading to its degradation
  and translocation of NF-κB subunits to the nucleus (N) to initiate transcription.
