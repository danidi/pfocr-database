  extract. RCE is a potent activator of AHR. Ligation of AHR by RCE upregulates gene
  and protein expression of CYP1A1 as well as skin barrier proteins such as FLG, LOR,
  and IVL. The upregulation of CYP1A1 and IVL is directly regulated by AHR. However,
  the FLG and LOR upregulation is mainly regulated by AHR-OVOL1 signaling (solid arrows).
  However, there may exist another pathway in which AHR directly upregulates FLG and
  LOR expression (dotted arrows). Coordinated upregulation of skin barrier proteins
  by RCE may be beneficial for the management of barrier-disrupted inflammatory skin
  diseases such as atopic dermatitis.
