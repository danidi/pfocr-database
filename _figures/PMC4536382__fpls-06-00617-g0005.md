caption: The SL biosynthetic pathway. CL is produced from all-trans-β-carotene by
  three enzymes, D27, CCD7, and CCD8. CL is oxidized by MAX1 into CLA, and then CLA
  is converted to the methyl ester derivative, MeCLA, in Arabidopsis. CLA is converted
  to strigolactones such as ent-2′-epi-5-deoxystrigol in rice. In addition, one of
  the MAX1 homologs in rice, Os01g0700900, can catalyze the conversion from CL to
  ent-2′-epi-5-deoxystrigol by a single enzymatic reaction. Ent-2′-epi-5-deoxystrigol
  might be converted into other SLs. Blue, red, green, and orange letters indicate
  genes of rice, Arabidopsis, pea, and petunia, respectively.
