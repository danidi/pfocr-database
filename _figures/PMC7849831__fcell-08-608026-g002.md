caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes contributes to neuroinflammatory
  activation of astrocytes. Mutations in PINK1 and Parkin likely elicit neuroinflammatory
  activation in astrocytes. (1a) After mitochondrial stress, PINK1 protein accumulates
  on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Phosphorylation of polyubiquitin and Parkin
  induces autophagosome maturation and eventually delivery to the lysosome. (1b) Loss-of-function
  (LOF) mutations in PINK1 and Parkin prevent PINK1 accumulation on the mitochondrial
  membrane and the activation of Parkin during mitochondrial stress, resulting in
  the accumulation of damaged mitochondria within astrocytes. This likely facilitates
  chronic inflammatory activation through multiple inflammatory pathways, including
  NLRP3 activation. (2a) Functional mitophagy prevents the release of damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs)/pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activation
  of the NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in astrocytes.
  (2b) The accumulation of damaged mitochondria likely results in the release of intracellular
  DAMPs/PAMPs, cardiolipin, and mtROS, which activates NLRP3 and the cyclic guanosine
  monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate cGAMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon
  genes (STING) pathway, resulting in inflammatory activation and release of interleukin
  (IL)-1β and IL-18, and potentially inducing the activation of microglia via extracellular
  release of cGAMP. (3a) Transfer of functional mitochondria from astrocytes to neurons
  is thought to be neuroprotective; however, whether microglia release functional
  mitochondria to astrocytes is elusive. (3b) Joshi et al. have shown that activated
  microglia can release dysfunctional and fragmented mitochondria to astrocytes. Astrocytes
  then transfer dysfunctional mitochondria to neurons, resulting in neuronal death.
  However, whether this occurs in vivo is unknown.
