caption: Proposed GnRH-analog effect on NAV3 and resultant effect on leiomyoma development.
  It has prior been established that in a typical leiomyoma cell, GnRHR related pathway
  signaling is upregulated. This results in activated b-catenin contributing to tumor
  growth. Additionally, activated GnRHR pathways in the leiomyoma include upregulation
  of T cell factors which increase inflammation and also contribute to fibroid volume.
  With GnRH analog treatment GnRH receptors become downregulated, resulting in decreased
  GnRHR-mediated processes. We discovered that GnRH analogs increase NAV3 expression
  in fibroids. Based on NAV3 functioning in other tissues, the increase in NAV3 may
  affect the GnRHR pathway signaling through the mechanism of a feedback loop, ultimately
  resulting in decreased GnRHR-mediated tumor growth. It is currently unknown if NAV3
  is a byproduct of GnRHR pathway signaling or if it is a mediator. Currently, the
  most commonly accepted mechanism of action of GnRH analogs on leiomyoma is through
  the pituitary-mediated decrease in estrogen and progesterone. This represents the
  canonical or known pathway. Our results highlight the potential hormone-independent
  mechanisms, for how GnRH analogs decrease fibroid volume, by downregulated GnRHR
  pathways which may be mediated by an increase in NAV3, (non-canonical pathway)
