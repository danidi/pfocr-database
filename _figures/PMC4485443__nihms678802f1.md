caption: A. Schematic representation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway.1. The ligand TGF-β
  binds and brings together two pairs of type I and type II receptors, which are transmembrane
  Ser/Thr kinases. 2. In the receptor complex, the type II receptor phosphorylates
  and activates the type I receptor kinase. 3. The type I receptor phosphorylates
  and activates R-Smads (generally Smad2 and Smad3 in the case of TGF-β, activin,
  nodal and myostatin receptors; Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 in the case of BMP receptors).
  4. Phosphorylated R-Smads form trimeric complexes with Smad4 for transcriptional
  regulation. The genes to be regulated are targeted by the Smad complex in partnership
  with various DNA binding cofactors. Transcriptional regulation additionally involves
  the recruitment of histone and DNA modifying enzymes, nucelosome positioning complexes,
  and CDK8/9 components of transcriptional Mediator and Elongation complexes (not
  shown; Massagué 2012). 5. Target genes that regulate cell homeostasis include Smad7,
  an inhibitory Smad that provides a universal feedback loop for negative regulation
  of this pathway. 6. Receptor-activated Smad2/3 alternatively form a complex with
  Trim33, a reader of repressive H3K9me3 histone marks. 7. In collaboration with the
  Smad-Trim33 complex and lineage-specific DNA binding cofactors factors (e.g. FoxH1
  for mesoderm differentiation), the R-Smad-Smad4 complex regulates master differentiation
  genes (e.g. goosecoid in the case of mesoderm differentiation). 8. Activated Smads
  are targeted by phosphatases for additional rounds of signaling or by ubiquitin
  ligases for proteasome-mediated degradation.B. Model representing TGF-β (gray) bound
  to the receptor components type I and type II (gold). The MH2 domain of Smad2 (green)
  is bound to the adaptor protein SARA (blue). Smad2 is modeled to be in the proximity
  of the receptor kinase, for its activation through phosphorylation (step 3 in Figure
  1A). Phosphorylated Smad2 residues are represented as two green circles.C. The Smad
  protein family in Vertebrates. The proteins are grouped according to their function.
