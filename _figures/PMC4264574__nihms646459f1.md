caption: TLR4 signaling cascade. TLRs signal as dimers and heterodimers that recruit
  adaptor proteins such as CD14 and MD2. Depending on the adaptors recruited by the
  activated TLR, different pathways are triggered, all of which culminate in activation
  of the proinflammatory transcription factors. One pathway involves MyD88 and TIRAP
  and activates NF-κB via IκB kinase and also activates AP-1. Another pathway involving
  NADPH oxidase activates NF-κB via ROS. TRIF and TRAM signaling proteins (via MyD88-independent
  pathway) also initiate signal cascades, culminating in activation of NF-κB and other
  proinflammatory transcription factors. RAGE is another transmembrane receptor operating
  in innate immune cells that is known to respond to HMGB1, and this pathway also
  induces proinflammatory gene transcription via NF-κB activation. The release of
  cytokines such as TNF-α, HMGB1, IL-1β, chemokines, proteases, and ROS activate adjacent
  cells. These cytokines affect the brain and are thought to contribute to the etiology,
  progression, and persistence of alcohol addiction. Bold red font (bold grey in the
  print version) indicates a gene that has been manipulated and shown to affect ethanol-related
  behavior. NF-κB, nuclear factor-κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; AP-1, activated protein-1; TIRAP,
  toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor protein; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFNβ; IRF, interferon
  regulatory factor; TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule; RAGE, receptor for advanced
  glycation end products; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1 β, interleukin-1β;
  IL-6, interleukin-6; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.
