caption: Myo-inositol (referred to as inositol) can be either imported from the environment
  via inositol transporters (ITRs) or synthesized intracellularly by converting glucose
  to inositol. Intracellular inositol is a precursor for producing inositol polyphosphates
  through PI kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Inositol in C. neoformans can also be
  converted by inositol oxygenase (MIO) to glucuronic acid, which can be utilized
  as an energy source via a catabolic pathway. Kcs1 is the inositol hexakisphosphate
  (IP6) kinase, which, in S. cerevisiae, also activates transcription of inositol
  3-phosphate synthase gene INO1.
