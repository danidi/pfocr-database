caption: Schematic for alternative complement pathway activity in fHm/m/fP−/− mice.
  (A) The fH truncation mutation impaired cell surface attachment and also caused
  low level expression of fH, resulting in uncontrolled AP complement activation in
  the fluid phase with near complete C3 and C5 depletion. The fH mutation combined
  with the fP- knockout reduced fluid phase C3 and C5 consumption and elevated plasma
  C3 and C5 levels. (B) With a low level of truncated fH and impaired fH function,
  excess AP complement activation occurred in an fP-independent manner, leading to
  C3b accumulation in the PR IS/OS and sub-RPE/BrM region and terminal complement-mediated
  local tissue injury. The anti-C5 antibody used in our experiments likely impaired
  MAC formation, resulting in decreased hypopigmented spots on fundus imaging and
  improved ERG amplitudes. PRL, PR layer.
