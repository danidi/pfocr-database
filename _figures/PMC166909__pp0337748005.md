caption: 'Illustration of the labeling patterns in the hexose units of carbohydrates
  in the ERM that result from the activity of different pathways after providing 13C1
  Glc to the mycorrhizal roots. A, The direct export of carbohydrate from the IRM;
  Glc uptake in the IRM results in labeling in C1 of carbohydrate in the IRM that
  is then exported to the ERM. B, Hexose triose cycling: Hexose initially labeled
  in C1 is broken down to dihydroxyacetone phosphate labeled in the C3 position, this
  then labels the C3 of glyceraldehyde-3-P through the action of triose phosphate
  isomerase, subsequently, gluconeogenic flux results in the labeling of C6 of carbohydrates.
  C, Synthesis of carbohydrates from lipids made in the IRM: The fatty acids (mainly
  C16) of lipid made in the IRM from 13C1 Glc are labeled in the even-numbered positions,
  export of this lipid to the ERM followed by β-oxidation produces acetyl-CoA units
  labeled in C2, the glyoxylate cycle produces malate labeled in C2 and C3, which
  after decarboxylation labels triose in C2 and C3, this triose labels carbohydrates
  in C1, C2, C5, and C6. D, The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway operating in cyclic
  mode: Three hexose molecules are converted to two hexose molecules, three molecules
  of CO2, and one of triose. The fate of each of the six carbons of hexose is shown.
  The light and dark shading of C1 and C6 carbons in C is used to emphasize the loss
  of label from the C1 positions and the retention of label in the C6 positions. This
  acts to lower the ratio of 13C1:13C6 in carbohydrates.'
