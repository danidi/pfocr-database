caption: A proposed mechanism where Dexibuprofen could constitute a potential treatment
  for AD. DXI causes a reduction in neuroinflammatory process which decreases three
  key signaling pathways, CABLES/c-ABL, hippocampal insulin pathway and the β-secretase
  enzyme, which are directly involved in the production and metabolism of Aβ, TAU
  phosphorylation and memory improvement. These signaling pathways constitute an early
  target for the treatment of AD with DXI, probably in a presymptomatic stage which
  can explain the potential use of this drug in neurodegenerative diseases.
