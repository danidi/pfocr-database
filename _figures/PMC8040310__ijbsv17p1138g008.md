caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed molecular mechanism highlighting the
  role of betulinic acid in the pathophysiology of SCI and subsequent neurological
  recovery. Betulinic acid activates autophagy through AMPK-mTOR-TFEB signaling pathway.
  Then enhanced autophagy and mitophagy to contribute to the elimination of damaged
  mitochondria and ROS by forming autolysosomes with lysosomes. Subsequently, pyroptosis
  are inhibited, which further results in the promotion of functional recovery after
  SCI.
