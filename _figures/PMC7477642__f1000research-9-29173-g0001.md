caption: (1) Ovarian cortex fragmentation disrupts the Hippo signaling pathway leading
  to dephosphorylation of YAP and TAZ, which (2) stimulates transcription of growth
  factors (GFs), including GDF9 and BMP15 (transforming growth factor-beta family).
  (3) GF and Kit-ligand (Kit-L) as well as (4) 740YP administration increase PI3K
  activity, whereas PTEN serves to keep follicles dormant. (5) Activation of the PI3K
  complex activates PIP2 to PIP3, which (6) leads to increased Akt expression. (7)
  Phosphorylated Akt upregulates mTOR, leading to downstream GF transcription, and
  (8) inhibits activation of RAD51 and FOXO3A. (9) This prevents nuclear export of
  FOXO3A, decreasing primordial follicle activation. Similarly, (10) anti-Müllerian
  hormone (AMH) decreases activation of phosphorylation of FOXO3A. Green arrows represent
  activation steps, and red bar-headed lines represent inhibition. AKT, protein kinase
  B; FOXO3, forkhead box O3; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-bisphosphate;
  PMF, primordial follicle; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
  10; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif; YAP, Yes-associated
  protein.
