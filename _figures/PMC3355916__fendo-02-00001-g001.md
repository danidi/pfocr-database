caption: Different stages of vesicle budding from the donor compartment and fusion
  with the acceptor compartment. (1) Vesicle formation and initiation of coat and
  adaptor proteins assembly. Specific Rab proteins interact with tethering factors
  anchored to the donor membrane to form multi-subunit Rab tethers that address coat
  proteins such as COPI, COPII and clathrin, and adaptor proteins that determine the
  specificity of cargo to the surface of the budding vesicle. (2) Uncoating and specific
  transport of carrier vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks. Newly formed vesicles lose
  their coat by inactivation of particular Rab GTPases and activation of uncoating
  enzymes. Motor protein complexes recognize and recruit uncoated vesicles to cytoskeletal
  tracks to transport the cargo to the corresponding acceptor compartment. These motor
  protein complexes include Rab proteins that modulate the processivity and direction
  of the motor protein movement. During transport, specific v-SNARE complexes are
  added to the surface of vesicles, thus conferring specificity to their fusion with
  the corresponding target compartment. (3) Tethering of vesicles to the acceptor
  compartment. Vesicles in the proximity of the target compartment become tethered
  to its membrane in a process driven by a Rab protein/tether factor complex. (4)
  Docking of vesicles to the acceptor compartment. v-SNARE and t-SNAREs assemble into
  a four-helix bundle and vesicles are approached to the target membrane. (5) Membrane
  fusion and release of cargo into the target compartment. Trans-SNARE complexes promote
  fusion of the vesicle and acceptor lipid bilayers. Cargo is transferred to the acceptor
  compartment, and the SNAREs are recycled. Rab proteins are inactivated and released
  into the cytosol, wherein they remain until a new cycle of activation is initiated.
