caption: Chemical structures and proposed metabolic pathway of vicagrel (Representative
  metabolites surrounded by dashed lines were not considered in the present study;
  there were three competitive pathways involving 2-oxo-clopidogrel further metabolism,
  we mainly focused on the critical pathway to generate AM) ().
