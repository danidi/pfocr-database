caption: The unfolded protein response. On aggregation of unfolded proteins, GRP78
  dissociates from the three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress receptors, pancreatic
  ER kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)
  and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), allowing their activation. The activation
  of the receptors occurs sequentially, with PERK being the first, rapidly followed
  by ATF6, whereas IRE1 is activated last. Activated PERK blocks general protein synthesis
  by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). This phosphorylation
  enables translation of ATF4, which occurs through an alternative, eIF2α-independent
  translation pathway. ATF4, being a transcription factor, translocates to the nucleus
  and induces the transcription of genes required to restore ER homeostasis. ATF6
  is activated by limited proteolysis after its translocation from the ER to the Golgi
  apparatus. Active ATF6 is also a transcription factor and it regulates the expression
  of ER chaperones and X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1), another transcription factor.
  To achieve its active form, XBP1 must undergo mRNA splicing, which is carried out
  by IRE1. Spliced XBP1 protein (sXBP1) translocates to the nucleus and controls the
  transcription of chaperones, the co-chaperone and PERK-inhibitor P58IPK, as well
  as genes involved in protein degradation. This concerted action aims to restore
  ER function by blocking further build-up of client proteins, enhancing the folding
  capacity and initiating degradation of protein aggregates. CHOP, C/EBP homologous
  protein.
