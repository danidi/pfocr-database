caption: Intracellular microbial components, such as viral dsRNA, are recognized by
  cytosolic pattern-recognition proteins (PRPs) like the RNA helicase RIG-I. Binding
  of dsRNA to the helicase region of RIG-I induces a conformational change in the
  protein, which exposes twin caspase activation and recruitment (CARD) domains. The
  CARD domains on RIG-I can then interact with a similar CARD domain on MAVS, which
  is localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane, to initiate an immune signaling
  cascade. The RIG-I:MAVS interaction activates kinases (represented here by IKKε)
  that phosphorylate pro-immune transcription factors (e.g. IRF3), which then translocate
  to the nucleus to initiate the production of cytokines, such as type 1 interferon.
