caption: 'Schematic of mechanism involved in SVs. a Causes of double-strand breaks
  (DSBs) include several factors including endogenous, exogenous, and programmed sources,
  and results in breakage of both phosphodiester DNA helix backbones. b DSB repair
  (DSBR) occurs through two major pathways: 1) non-homologous end joining (NHEJ),
  which occurs throughout the cell cycle; or 2) homologous recombination (HR), which
  occurs primarily in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. In NHEJ, either classical
  NHEJ (c-NHEJ), where no resectioning has occurred, or alternative NHEJ (a-NHEJ),
  where minor resectioning has occurred, is employed. HR requires major resectioning
  and then can repair through single strand annealing (SSA) or form a D-loop which
  is rectified either by synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) or the canonical
  HR pathway, which forms a double Holliday junction (dHJ) that can dissolve as a
  non-crossover event (NCO) or resolve through cleavage in either a NCO or a crossover
  (CO) event. c DSBR can result in no normal repair, where the original chromosomal
  architecture is intact or result in structural variants (SVs) that can have a combination
  of losses, gains and/or rearrangements'
