caption: 'The ellipses are proteins; the rectangles are genes; and the triangles are
  metabolites. The linkage between shapes: sharp-end arrows indicate stimulation,
  T-end arrows indicate inhibition, and wavy lines indicate association. The information
  were extracted from Science Signaling Database of Cell Signaling  and KEGG database
  . The white ellipses are five of the eight kinases selected to be mutated in our
  experiments.'
