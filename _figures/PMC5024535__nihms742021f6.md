caption: A) Gene expression signature is plotted onto pathway map of pyrimidine metabolism
  in metastatic melanoma (KEGG pathway ID:00240). On the left side enzymes DPYD, DPYS
  and UPB1 are responsible for pyrimidine degradation, in the center TYMP connects
  uracil derivatives, and at the right pyrimidine kinases DTYMK and CMPK, nucleoside
  diphosphate kinases NME, and polymerases POLD and POLR provide synthesis of DNA
  and RNA nucleic acids. B) Frequency of somatic mutations in pyrimidine enzymes is
  color coded from 0% in grey to 25% in purple in metastatic melanoma (). C) Impact
  of DPYD mutations on enzymes of pyrimidine metabolism is indicated by regulatory
  symbols and shading of enzyme boxes (red, plus) for enhancement and suppression
  (blue, minus) (). Somatic frequency of mutations, enhanced gene expression signature
  of patients with DPYD mutations are provided in . D) Pathway map shows separation
  and directionality of upregulated pyrimidine degradation (red, left) and nucleic
  acid synthesis (red, right) by down-regulated uracil and thymidine salvage (blue,
  center). Concerted dysregulation of metabolic enzymes at a pathway level contributes
  to bifurcation of pyrimidine metabolism. The systems biology maps depict metabolites
  as circles, reactions with their respective directionality as arrows, and enzymes
  as boxes. Enzymes of anabolic direction are shown above reactions and enzymes of
  catabolic direction below reactions. Staggered boxes indicate metabolic redundancy
  that multiple genes encode enzymes for the reaction.
