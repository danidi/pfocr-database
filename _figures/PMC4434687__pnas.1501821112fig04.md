caption: Conversion of tabersonine to 3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrotabersonine by the combined
  action of T3O and T3R enzymes. In the absence of T3R, the proposed intermediate
  is spontaneously converted to byproduct MIAs 1′-3′. Reduction of MIA 1′ with sodium
  borohydride yields the expected diol.

  drug precursor vindoline and its assembly in yeast.
