number: Fig. 1
caption: Gene map of the signaling pathways of the Toll-like receptor, activation
  of complement and interaction of cytokines (shown only partly) derived from the
  KEGG database. Genes showing significantly different expression in the CoPS-3/4
  vs. H groups are marked with red asterisks. The figure shows the dependence of complement
  activation and cytokine pathways on the Toll-like receptor pathway (red arrows).
  Differentially expressed genes are located on the paths leading to the complement
  and cytokine pathways
