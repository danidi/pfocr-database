caption: 'Model of leaf lipid pathways and hypotheses for acyl flux into TAG. Plastid-localized
  fatty acid synthesis (F.A.S.) and the chloroplast-localized prokaryotic pathway
  are in the green box. All other reactions represent extraplastidial metabolism.
  Solid arrowheads represent flux of the glycerol backbone and open arrowheads represent
  acyl transfer reactions. Dashed lines and boxes represent uncertainty in acyl flux
  in HO tobacco lines, and uppercase letters A–C represent three hypotheses for altered
  acyl flux in HO tobacco lines: the use of de novo DAG by AtDGAT1 for a Kennedy pathway
  TAG synthesis (A); uncertain quantitative flux through acyl editing that affects
  incorporation of PC-modified fatty acids in TAG (B); and the use of a membrane lipid-derived
  DAG by AtDGAT1 for TAG synthesis (C).'
