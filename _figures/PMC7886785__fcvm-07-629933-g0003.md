caption: RAAS schematic. Simplified schematic focusing on the activity of ACE and
  ACE2 and the resulting receptor activation. The vasoconstrictive activity of this
  pathway is mediated by AT1R activation, which also causes increased oxidative stress;
  MasR and AT2R activation leads to vasodilation and a reduction in oxidative stress.
  Receptors are in boxes; enzymes that processes signalling peptides are in ovals.
