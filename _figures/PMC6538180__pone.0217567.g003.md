caption: Predicted involvement of TGF-β1 signaling pathway (A) and predicted activation
  of PDGF-BB signaling pathway (B) by molecule activity predictor analysis of IPA
  in HSV- infected versus mock infected TM cells. Gene networks enriched with genes
  associated with HSV-1 infection in human TM cells. Red and green color represents
  the up- and down-regulated genes in the HSV-1 infected TM cells, respectively. The
  intensity of color indicates the degree of over- or under-expression. Functional
  and physical interactions between the genes and the direction of regulation reported
  in the published literature are represented by each line and arrow.
