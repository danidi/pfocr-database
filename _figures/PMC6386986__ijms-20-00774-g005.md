caption: 'Mechanisms of CRPC development. AR signalling can be activated via AR amplification
  or mutation to allow signalling despite castrate levels of androgens (hypersensitive
  pathway), AR variants mediate AR signaling in the absence of androgens, or through
  intratumoral steroidogenesis de novo or from adrenal androgens. Alternatively, AR
  signaling may be mediated via non-androgenic steroids (promiscuous pathway), while
  RTK signalling cascades allow tumor cells to survive without androgens (RTK crosstalk).
  In the absence of AR, survival can be enhanced through cell-intrinsic pathways,
  such as loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) or upregulation of anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 proteins (bypass pathway). Androgen independent prostate cancer stem cells
  undergo androgen independent self-renewal, persist after ADT, and seed tumor relapse.
  The potential role of SEMA3C in each resistance mechanism is described as shown.
  AR: androgen receptor, DHEA: dehydroepiandrosterone, DHT: dihydrotestosterone, RTK:
  receptor tyrosine kinase. Dotted red arrows indicate multi-step process, curved
  blue arrows indicate cell self-renewal and red solid arrows signify signaling pathways.'
