caption: a) Pathway map showing the affected metabolic pathways. The map was generated
  in MetaboAnalyst and shows all matched pathways according to p-values from the pathway
  enrichment analysis, and pathway impact values from the pathway topology analysis.
  The size of each circle represents the strength of the impact on the pathway, and
  significance levels based on p-values range from yellow (least significant) to red
  (most significant). b) Pathway-based model and interpretation for the affected metabolites
  and corresponding metabolic pathways during schistosome infection. In response to
  schistosome infection and increased demands from the host, there is ↑ glycolysis,
  ↑ pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), ↑ fatty acid synthesis ↑ gluconeogenesis ↑glycogenolysis,
  as well as ↑ purine synthesis for salvage by the parasite, leading to the observed
  increases in the host metabolites identified (i.e. AMP, ADP, 3-PG, and G6P). AMP,
  adenosine monophosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  3-PG, 3-phosphoglyceric acid; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; SmAP, schistosome
  tegumental alkaline phosphatase.
