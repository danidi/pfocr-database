caption: Maresin biosynthetic pathway [].The pathway is initiated by the lipoxygenation
  of DHA to yield 13S,14S-epoxy-maresin. This intermediate is then enzymatically hydrolyzed
  to maresin 1 or via a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to maresin 2. 13S,14S-epoxy-maresin
  is also a substrate for glutathione S-transferase MU 4 (GSTM4) and leukotriene C4
  synthase (LTC4S) yielding MCTR1, which is then converted to MCTR2 by gamma-glutamyl
  transferase (GGT) and to MCTR3 by dipeptidase (DPEP).
