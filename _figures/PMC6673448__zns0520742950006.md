caption: Model depicting a novel, early signaling cascade linking group I mGluR stimulation
  to FMRP phosphorylation through mTOR and PP2A. Immediate (<1 min) DHPG-induced group
  I mGluR activation results in rapid FMRP dephosphorylation mediated by increased
  PP2A activity correlating with a burst of translation (FMRP ligands). Extended group
  I mGluR activation (1–5 min) reveals that FMRP is rephosphorylated by mTOR-dependent
  PP2A suppression.
