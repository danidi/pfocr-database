caption: Overview of the cellular TME composition and major molecular pathways associated
  with IO sensitivity (left) and resistance (right). IO sensitivity is depicted by
  an immunogenic TME, comprising the activation of effector immune cells (e.g. tumor
  infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), dendritic cells (CD) and natural killer cells (NK)).
  Naïve T cells undergo activation and priming in close association to B cells within
  tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). T effector cells transmigrate to the stromal
  TME compartment via high endothelial venules (HEV), tightly regulated by immunomodulatory
  tumor endothelial cells (TEC; not illustrated) in the HEV endothelium. Cancer cell
  intrinsic molecular pathways that enhance TME immunogenicity involve interferon
  type I (IFN I) expression, which is, amongst other stressors, induced by cytosolic
  RIG-I or by an activated STING pathway. IO sensitivity is enhanced in a TME with
  high PD-L1 expression by cancer and immune cells. High neo-antigen expression by
  cancer cells as result of high tumor mutational burden (TMB), e.g. induced by PARP
  inhibition, enhances TME immunogenicity and IO sensitivity. IO resistance is marked
  by an immunosuppressive TME and includes, on a cellular basis, infiltration of T
  regulatory cells (Treg) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) as well as M2
  macrophages (not shown). CD73 and, thus, adenosine expression by cancer cells or
  fibroblasts leads to inhibition of TIL and promotion of Treg; CD73 upregulation
  associates with cancer immune evasion. Also, up-regulation of alternative immune
  checkpoints e.g. LAG-3 and TIM-1 by immune cells enhances IO resistance. Cancer
  associated fibroblasts (CAF) depict both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory
  functions, e.g. via chemokine release. Upregulation of the chemokine receptor CCR-4
  is associated with IO resistance. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gets
  ubiquitously expressed in the TME (not illustrated, see Fig. ). It has immunosuppressive
  functions by inhibiting effector immune cells (e.g. TIL, NK, DC), upregulating inhibitory
  immune checkpoints (e.g. PD-L1) and by promoting Treg and MDSC. Tumor growth promoting
  neo-angiogenesis (not illustrated) is driven by hypoxia and, thus, VEGF expression
