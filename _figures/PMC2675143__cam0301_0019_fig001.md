caption: The scheme shows some of the potential kinase activity-dependent and scaffold-dependent
  mechanisms by which GRK2 may modulate epithelial cell migration. In response to
  pro-migratory stimuli acting through GPCRs, GRK2 would be recruited in a Gβγ-dependent
  manner to sites of the plasma membrane wherein chemotactic activation is taking
  place. At such specific locations, GRK2 could interact with different signalling
  complexes involved in cell migration in a receptor- and cell-type specific manner,
  what might drive different migratory responses. In response to Gi-coupled S1P receptors,
  GRK2 dynamically interacts with the adaptor protein GIT1 in epithelial cells and
  fibroblasts. Acting as a scaffold molecule, GRK2 facilitates the localized activation
  of the Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK pathway, leading to increased focal adhesion (FA) turnover
  and F-actin polymerization at the leading edge, events that are critical for cell
  motility and invasion. On the other hand, many chemokine receptors promote the phosphorylation
  of the receptor itself by GRK2 leading to desensitization of G-protein-dependent
  signalling pathways, what might be instrumental for the maintenance of motility.
  Finally, some chemoatractants can trigger GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of ezrin
  and tubulin. Phosphorylation-dependent activation of ezrin, a molecule that links
  the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane in order to promote membrane ruffles
  and filopodia among other structures, is essential for locomotion of cells adopting
  an amoeboid-like migration mode, while microtubule dynamics might affect cell polarization
  or protrusive activity in different cell types. See main text for details.
