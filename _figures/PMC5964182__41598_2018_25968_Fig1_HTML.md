caption: Schematic diagram of the kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan can be utilised for
  protein synthesis or serotonin and melatonin production. However, over 90% peripheral
  tryptophan has been reported to be metabolised via the kynurenine pathway (KP) in
  mammals. In the KP, tryptophan is metabolised into N-formyl-kynurenine followed
  by kynurenine (KYN) catalysed by enzymes indoleamine deoxygenase or tryptophan deoxygenase
  and formamidase. KYN is then converted to kynurenic acid (KYNA) by enzyme kynurenine
  aminotransferase. Alternatively, KYN is metabolised to anthranilic acid (AA) and
  3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) by enzymes kynureninase and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase,
  respectively. AA and 3-HK further get metabolised to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA),
  which in turn gets converted to aminocarboxymuconic semialdehyde (ACMA). ACMA spontaneously
  converts to neurotoxin, quinolinic acid, a substrate for the redox agent, NAD+.
  Alternatively, ACMA can be assisted by enzyme 2-amino-3-carboxymuconatesemialdehyde
  decarboxylase to generate picolinic acid. KP metabolites marked in bold, have been
  investigated in the current study.
