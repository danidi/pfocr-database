caption: Red dots and arrows represent metabolites and enzymatic reactions, respectively.
  Faucet and drain of kitchen sink are analogies of enzymatic reactions of upstream
  and downstream metabolic enzymes, respectively; the basin represents the accumulation
  level of the toxic metabolite. a The level of toxic metabolite candidate is constantly
  maintained at a nontoxic level as both faucet and drain are opened (active), balancing
  metabolite production and removal. b Example of toxic metabolite accumulation by
  targeting the downstream detoxification enzyme. SLC7A11 and SEPHS2 are the faucet
  and drain for toxic hydrogen selenide in the selenocysteine biosynthesis pathway.
  Many cancer cells have elevated SLC7A11 expression relative to normal cells and
  are able to import selenium and produce selenide at an elevated rate. Thus, their
  faucet is wide open, and disrupting SEPHS2 is akin to blocking the drain, resulting
  in toxic overflow. c However, in normal cells, disrupting SEPHS2/blocking the drain
  is not a problem as the faucet is relatively “closed”. In both b and c, building
  block metabolite cannot be produced, yet only b is toxic, indicating that the toxicity
  must have come from toxic metabolite accumulation rather than consequences of downstream
  building block production. d Similarly, in a cancer cell such as in scenario b,
  the preemptive KO of the upstream transporter SLC7A11 rescues the cells against
  the toxic effects of SEPHS2 KO, further demonstrating that toxicity in b was due
  to toxic metabolite accumulation. All diagrams were created with BioRender.com.
