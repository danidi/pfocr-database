caption: Hsp70 is thought to promote survival and block apoptosis through interactions
  with multiple steps in the pathway. For some substrates, Hsp70’s role appears to
  be stabilization of the substrate, while it appears to mediate the degradation of
  other substrates. The regulatory mechanisms that govern these activities are not
  known. See the main text and  for references.
