caption: Activation of the Nrf2 pathway with oxidative stress. Nrf2 is sequestered
  in the cytoplasm with Keap-1, facilitating its ubiquination and subsequent degradation.
  With oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released and migrates to the nucleus, where it binds
  to multiple antioxidant response elements (MARE) on heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and other
  genes to mediate gene transcription. To see this illustration in color, the reader
  is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertpub.com/ars
