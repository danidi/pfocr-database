caption: Effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs on anti-virus immune response. Schematic
  representation of how cholesterol-lowering drugs affect anti-viral immune responses.
  Depletion of cholesterol by statins alters lipid rafts in CD4+ T lymphocytes and
  avoids HIV-1 entry and its intracellular replication. Moreover, statin treatment
  results in the down-regulation of Th1 and in the induction anti-inflammatory Th2
  response. During anti-viral immune responses statins also increase frequency and
  functions of Treg cells while inhibit effector functions of T lymphocytes. Cholesterol
  inhibition by bisphosphonate determines maturation of antigen presenting cells (APCs)
  which antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Finally, IFNs induce the production
  of specific miRNAs which modulate cholesterol levels in macrophages, thus improving
  their anti-viral activity.
