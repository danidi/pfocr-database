caption: The schematic diagram delineating the Hsp90–NF-κB–Beclin1 pathway involved
  in the selenite-induced apoptosis and autophagy of NB4 cells. Sodium selenite decreased
  Hsp90 expression, which occurred through some unknown transcription factors and
  attenuated the interaction of Hsp90 with IKK, which suppressed the activation and
  nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The inactivated NF-κB then suppressed becn1 transcription
  and anti-apoptotic genes, leading to a cell signaling switch from autophagy to apoptosis
  and, finally, irreversible cell death. This mechanism probably mediates the selenite-induced
  regulatory balance of apoptosis and autophagy in NB4 cells.
