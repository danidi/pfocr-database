caption: 'Genes up- and downstream of flavonol biosynthesis are also affected in the
  Δy mutants. The figure represents the next biosynthetic processes upstream of flavonoid
  biosynthesis:  cycle; shikimate, chorismate, and arogenate pathways; core phenylpropanoid
  pathway; phenolic acid and lignin pathways; resveratrol biosynthesis; and l-Phe
  catabolism. In addition, the flavonoid transport process is shown downstream of
  flavonoid biosynthesis. Those genes differentially down-regulated (blue) are shown
  by arrows (the thicker the arrow, the higher the fold change).  motifs found in
  their promoters were also included (in colored boxes). Genes in gray were not differentially
  expressed in the Δy mutants. Genes and metabolites differentially expressed both
  in the y mutant and in other y-lines are marked “a” and “b,” respectively; those
  differentially expressed only in the Δy mutants are marked “c” (in red). NAD+-ME,
  NAD+-MALIC ENZYME; PDT, PREPHRENATE DEHYDRATASE; COMT, CAFFEIC ACID O-METHYLTRANSFERASE;
  HCT, CINNAMOYL COA TRANSFERASE; UDP-GT, GLUCURONOSYL TRANSFERASE.'
