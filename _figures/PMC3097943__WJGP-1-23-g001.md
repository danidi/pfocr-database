caption: The role IL-6 signaling in CCA inflammation-related epigenetic regulation.
  In CCA, the negative feedback of the IL-6 pathway is deficient owing to aberrant
  epigenetic silence of suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), which is mediated
  by the IL-6/STAT3 pathway to maintain gene promoter hypermethylated. Up-regulation
  of EGFR expression through decreasing its promoter methylation level mediated by
  undefined mechanisms. Moreover, overloaded IL-6 also increased let-7a expression
  via an undetermined mechanism, resulting in suppression of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)
  and subsequently increasing phosphorylated STAT3. Overloaded IL-6 in CCA can up-regulate
  expressions of two DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and HASJ4442, which leading to
  hypermethylation of the miR-370 gene promoter and abrogating suppressing effect
  of miR-370 on oncogenic mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 (MAP3K8).
