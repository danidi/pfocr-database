caption: Postulated model for regulation of large luteal cells of ruminants (left)
  and primates (right). In the ruminant large luteal cell, there is excess catalytic
  subunit for PKA (C in green) and this can phosphorylate and activate StAR (steroidogenic
  acute regulatory protein) as well as other proteins. This produces very high constitutive
  progesterone (P4) production in the ruminant large luteal cell due to high amounts
  of cholesterol substrate, in the form of HDL, and high enzymatic activity for CYP11A1
  (also known as P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme) and 3β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase
  enzyme (3βHSD). Inhibitory pathways that are activated by Prostaglandin F2a (PGF)
  binding to its receptor (PGFr) are also present, leading to inhibition of StAR,
  increases in PGF synthesis enzymes (PTGS2 and PTGFS) and inhibition of the PGF degradation
  enzyme (HPGD). This produces an auto-amplification pathway for PGF with PGF production
  in the large luteal cell increasing due to PGF action. In the primate large luteal
  cell, similar pathways for high P4 production are present, however, these pathways
  are under direct control by LH. Activation of the LH receptor (LHr) by LH increases
  cAMP, which binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA (R in red), releasing catalytic
  subunit to phosphorylate StAR and other proteins. In addition, the large luteal
  cells of primates convert androgens (A4, T) to estrogens (E2). It is postulated
  that a reduction in LH stimulation would lead to changes in PGF synthesis and degradation
  enzymes that may increase intraluteal production of PGF and activation of inhibitory
  pathways by PGF.
