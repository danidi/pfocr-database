caption: Model of our inducible axonemal deglutamylation system, STRIP, and proposed
  roles for tubulin glutamylation. The proximal end of the axoneme is subjected to
  polyglutamylation. Axonemal glutamylation facilitates kinesin-2-mediated anterograde
  IFT and the ciliary entry of the Hedgehog pathway components Smoothened (Smo) and
  Gli3 upon Hedgehog stimulation. The translocation of the CCP5 catalytic domain (CCP5CD)
  onto the MAP4m-appended axoneme by adding rapamycin specifically strips axonemal
  glutamylation and subsequently inhibits anterograde IFT and Hedgehog signaling without
  noticeably affecting the ciliary structure in the steady state
