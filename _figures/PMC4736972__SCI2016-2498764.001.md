caption: Basics of Notch signalling pathway. Notch signalling activation occurs via
  an interaction between DSL ligand and Notch receptor on adjacent cells. This interaction
  leads to force being applied to the extracellular domain of Notch, as DSL ligand
  undergoes endocytosis into the signalling cell, leading to a conformational change
  within the negative regulatory region (NRR). This conformational change exposes
  a cleavage site (S2) for the ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases. The extracellularly truncated
  Notch protein then undergoes cleavage at site 3 (S3), mediated by γ-secretase, which
  releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Finally, NICD translocates into
  the nucleus and interacts with the DNA binding protein RBPj and the transcriptional
  coactivators MAML and p300 to initiate transcription of downstream targets including
  the Hes and Hey family of genes.
