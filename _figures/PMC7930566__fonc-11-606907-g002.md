caption: Schematic portrayal of the possible mechanisms of mifepristone as a chemo-sensitizing
  agent for glioblastoma. Mifepristone decrease the level of anti-apoptotic protein
  Bcl-2 and increase the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax leading to apoptosis.
  Mifepristone has also been found to inhibit the expression of VEGF and block the
  function of drug transporting proteins such as P-gp and MRP. Another mechanism involved
  in the mifepristone-induced sensitization to temozolomide is the modulation of the
  expression of the MGMT enzyme, it has been reported that mifepristone reduces the
  expression of the MGMT protein in combination with temozolomide, leading to apoptosis.
  As described elsewhere, mifepristone decreases the growth of stem cells by inhibiting
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which involves glucocorticoid receptors and
  increasing the miRNA-153.
