caption: 'Androgen actions via intracellular androgen receptor mediated pathways.
  Testosterone (T) can be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the 5αR enzyme.
  1) In the classical pathway, androgen freely passes through the membrane bi-layer
  and binds cytoplasmic androgen receptor (AR). Bound AR translocates to the nucleus,
  binds to a DNA response element on a promoter of an androgen responsive gene and
  stimulates transcription. 2) Bound AR interacts with the SH3 domain of the tyrosine
  kinase c-Src to activate the MAPK pathway and influence AR-mediated transcription
  via phosphorylation of coactivator/receptor complexes. 3) Androgen bound to steroid
  hormone binding globulin (SHBG) can activate SHBG receptor (SHBGR) and lead to an
  increase in PKA activity. PKA may influence AR-mediated transcription via alteration
  of phosphorylation status of AR and AR coregulators. Abbreviations: T = testosterone,
  DHT = dihydrotestosterone, 5αR = 5 alpha reductase enzyme, AR = androgen receptor,
  PKA = protein kinase A, GP = g-protein, SH2 = Src homology domain 2, SH3 = Src homology
  domain 3, PTK = protein tyrosine kinase, MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase,
  SHBGR = steroid hormone binding globulin receptor, cAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate.'
