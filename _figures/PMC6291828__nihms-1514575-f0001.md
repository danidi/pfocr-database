caption: BCR may be activated either by antigen binding or via cell-autonomous pathways.
  Antigen binding to extracellular BCR results in phosphorylation of immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within CD79a and CD79b, which act as intracellular
  docking sites for additional adaptor molecules and kinases such as LYN. LYN phosphorylates
  the tyrosine kinase SYK to continue signal propagation. SYK is also activated through
  autophosphorylation when bound directly to phosphorylated ITAMs, at which point
  it promotes further ITAM phosphorylation and activates downstream signaling cascades,
  including those mediated by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K). PI3K activation generates PIP3, which complexes with AXL and BLNK
  to recruit BTK, PLCγ2, and AKT to the plasma membrane. Tonic BCR activity is mediated
  by the PI3K/AKT pathway, which coordinates downstream pro-survival effectors and
  cell cycle regulators. In a separate pathway, activation of PLCγ2 downstream of
  BTK activates PKCβ, which phosphorylates IKK recruited by a complex of MALT1, BCL10,
  and CARD11. Phosphorylated IKK activates NF-κB transcription factors that translocate
  to the nucleus to promote expression of genes associated with survival and proliferation.
  A20 acts as a negative regulator of NF- κB, while SHIP-1 and PTEN phosphatases inhibit
  PI3K signaling by hydrolyzing PIP3.
