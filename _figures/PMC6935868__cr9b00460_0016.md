caption: 'Three possible mechanisms (concerted, dissociative, and associative) for
  the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by ALP. Comparing with model systems,
  the dissociative mechanism (formation of a metaphosphate intermediate; reaction
  scheme in the middle) is most likely. The concerted pathway (no intermediate, only
  a transition state is passed; upper reaction scheme) and the associative pathway
  with the formation of a phosphorane intermediate (lower reaction scheme) are less
  likely. The energy vs reaction coordinate plots given as inserts indicate the progress
  of the reaction (concerted pathway: one transition state; and dissociative or associate
  pathway: two transition states).'
