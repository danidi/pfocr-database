caption: Regulation of priming and fusion of insulin granules by glucose and the incretin
  GLP-1. Uptake of glucose into the beta cell leads to increased intracellular ATP
  through metabolism. GLP-1 binds to G-protein coupled receptors and increase intracellular
  cAMP. The model is valid also for other compounds able to increase intracellular
  ATP and cAMP. ATP initiate the triggering pathway of beta cell stimulus-secretion
  coupling (right) leading to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ needed for fusion.
  Both cAMP and ATP facilitate granular priming and are therefore involved in amplification
  of the secretory response. Many different proteins and ion channels are involved
  as described in detail in the text. VDCC Voltage Dependent Ca2+ Channel, SUR1 Sulphonylurea
  Receptor, EPAC Exchange Protein directly activated by cAMP, CLC3 Cl− Voltage gated
  Channel 3, gSUR granular Sulphonylureas Receptor, CFTR Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
  Regulator, ANO1 Anoctamin 1 Ca2+ activated Cl− channel
