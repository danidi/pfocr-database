caption: Beclin 1 as a switch between homeostasis and apoptosis in neurodegeneration.
  Schematic representation of the potential roles of Beclin 1. Under homeostatic conditions
  (left) Beclin 1 acts as a scaffold for different protein complexes mediating various
  cellular processes. Long-lived proteins and organelles can be degraded in the autophagy-lysosomal
  degradation pathway. Beclin 1 can also regulate endocytosis and receptor recycling,
  crucial processes for growth factor signaling in neurons. In response to stress
  (right) caspases become activated and cleave Beclin 1 into N-terminal and C-terminal
  fragments, impairing its interactions with other proteins and homeostatic functions.
  Additionally, the C-terminal fragment can prime the cell for apoptotic stimuli.
  In the context of neurodegeneration, the C-terminal fragment can potentiate the
  effect of caspase activation and exacerbate apoptosis and neuronal cell death
