caption: 'The Fanconi anemia/BRCA repair pathway. Following DNA damage, ataxia telangiectasia
  and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) and its binding partner ATR interacting protein (ATRIP)
  are activated, and in turn activate Fanconi Anemia complex 1. This ubiquinates FANCD2/FANCI,
  which then colocalize with other key repair proteins on the damaged DNA. Following
  repair of DNA, FANCD2/FANCI are deubiquinated allowing replication to proceed.Abbreviations:
  ATR, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase; ATRIP, binding partner ATR interacting
  protein; Ub, ubiquinated.'
