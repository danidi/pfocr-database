caption: Metabolic engineering of xylitol production in E. coli. Xylose is transferred
  into E.coli cells by xylose transporters. Xylose can be converted into xylulose
  by native xylose isomerase, which is subsequently phosphorylated to xylulose-5-phosphate
  by xylulose kinase. Xylulose-5-phosphate is an intermediate of the pentose phosphate
  pathway. Introduction of heterologous xylose reductase or reversible xylitol dehydrogenase
  can achieve the xylitol production. Xylose reductase reduces xylose to xylitol using
  NADH or NADPH, and xylitol dehydrogenase reduces xylulose to xylitol using NADH.
  Blue lines represent the native pathway in E.coli and red lines represent the heterologous
  pathway for xylitol production.
