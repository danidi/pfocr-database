caption: Proposed model for the evolution of eye degeneration in the cavefish Sinocyclocheilus
  anophthalmus. (A) Surface fish. (B) Cavefish. In normal vertebrate eyes (A), otx2
  upregulates crx, which controls the differentiation of photoreceptor precursors;
  a number of other factors, including nr2e3, nrl, thrb, and crx itself, help to regulate
  the differentiation of precursor cells into mature rods and cones that express differentiation
  products, including gnat1, gnat2, guca1a, and irbp (; ). In cavefish eyes (B), transcriptomic
  data showed downregulation of crx, which would lead to decreased photoreceptor cell
  differentiation, fewer and malformed photoreceptors, and diminished expression of
  a series of photoreceptor-specific genes (rod opsins and cone opsins, otx5, gnat1,
  gnat2, guca1a, and irbp). Because otx2 expression was unchanged in cavefish eyes,
  another regulatory factor may lie upstream of crx, and/or evolved changes in the
  promotors of crx paralogs in cavefish may dampen the response of crx to normal otx2
  signal. Because fish can regenerate photoreceptors from the CMZ and from Müller
  glia cells, this pathway likely works throughout life and is thus involved in retinal
  maintenance. Downregulated genes in cavefish are indicated by green letters. Upregulated
  genes included several immune-related genes, which may represent response to inflammation
  associated with eye degeneration.
