caption: Proposed model for the transcriptional regulation of carotenoid metabolism
  by CsMADS6. Thick gray arrows indicate the simplified reaction flows in the pathway.
  The biosynthetic genes encoding enzymes that catalyze the reactions are shown at
  the sides of the arrows. CsMADS6 coordinately and positively modulates carotenoid
  metabolism by directly regulating the expression of LCYb1, PSY, PDS, and CCD1. The
  up-regulated expression of PSY, PDS, and LCYb1, together with the altered expression
  of other carotenogenic genes, induces carotenoid biosynthesis and directs flux into
  the β-branch, consequently forming more β,β-carotenoids in the transgenic lines.
  The up-regulated expression of CCD1 balances carotenoid content and composition
  and also permits the production of apocarotenoids, such as β-cyclocitral, which
  may act as retrograde signals that regulate the expression of carotenogenic genes.
  Moreover, CsMADS6 probably induces the notably high expression of PSY and PDS by
  an indirect mechanism that involves regulating the expression of HY5, RAP2.2, and
  PIF1. The feedback regulation by apocarotenoids and the indirect regulation by other
  TFs (indicated with dashed lines) remain to be determined. This model enriches our
  understanding of the complex transcriptional regulation of carotenoid metabolism
  in plants.
