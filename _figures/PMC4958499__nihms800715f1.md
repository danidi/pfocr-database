caption: 'A. PC and PE syntheses by the Kennedy pathway. Choline or ethanolamine undergoes
  sequential reactions with ATP, CTP, and DAG to produce PC or PE. The first two reactions
  are mediated by cytosolic enzymes, while the final steps involving DAG are mediated
  by enzymes that are embedded in the ERM.B. Phospho-headgroup modifications of PC,
  PE, and PS mediated by PEMT, PSS1, and PSS2. PEMT is located at ERM/MAM, whereas
  PSS1/PSS2 are located at MAM.C. Mitochondrial synthesis of PE by PSD at IMM.D. Mitochondrial
  CL synthesis by CLS, tafazzin, PL-A2, and MLCLAT-1. Nascent CL molecules produced
  by CLS are subsequently de/re-acylated to form mature and functional CL.E. Small
  quantity of CL can be synthesized on the ERM by ALCAT-1.F. PI synthesis by CDS and
  PI synthase on the ERM. Molecules synthesized in ERM, OMM and IMM can be transported
  at MAM or intra-mitochondrial contact site.Abbreviations: ALCAT-1 (acyl-CoA: lysocardiolipin
  acyltransferase-1), c (cytochrome c oxidase), CDS (CDP-DAG synthase), CK (choline
  kinase), CL (cardiolipin), CLS (cardiolipin synthase), CPT (CDP-choline phosphotransferase),
