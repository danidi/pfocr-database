caption: '(A) Natural nutrients control the growth or the stress-response state of
  a cell (reviewed in []). Growth stimulatory molecules are colored green, and growth
  inhibitory molecules are colored red. Broadly speaking, the presence of natural
  essential nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, glucose, sulfur, phosphorus) activates the
  TORC1 pathway. Glucose additionally activates the Ras/PKA pathway, although this
  activation is transient if essential natural nutrients are incomplete []. For simplicity,
  we have omitted other input pathways (e.g., in []). TORC1 and Ras/PKA pathways activate
  cell growth (green box) and inhibit stress response (red box). Conversely, the shortage
  of a natural nutrient or inhibition of TORC1 (via rapamycin) triggers stress responses,
  including cell-cycle arrest, autophagy, and oxidative metabolism. Note that the
  mRNA levels of greater than a quarter of yeast genes are linearly correlated with
  growth rate, independent of the nature of the nutrient limitation [,]. During slow
  growth, repressed genes include those involved in ribosome synthesis, translation
  initiation, and protein and RNA metabolism, whereas induced genes are involved in
  autophagy, lipid metabolism, and oxidative metabolism (including those annotated
  to peroxisomes and the peroxisomal matrix) [,,,]. (B) Left: when limited for a natural
  nutrient, an auxotroph responds properly with muted growth (red box) and survives
  with high viability. Right: when limited for the auxotrophic nutrient, an auxotroph
  suffers nutrient–growth dysregulation (orange box). Despite nutrient limitation,
  cells experience poor cell-cycle arrest, suffer reduced autophagy, and metabolize
  glucose via fermentation instead of respiration. Consequently, these cells suffer
  low viability.  offers additional discussions. Auxo, auxotroph; Bcy1, bypass of
