caption: 'Histopathological Features and Pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular
  cardiomyopathy (ARVC). With the azan trichrome stain, myocytes appear red, fibrous
  tissue appears blue, and fatty tissue appears white. Panel A shows a full-thickness
  histologic section (azan trichrome stain) of the anterior right ventricular wall
  in a normal heart; Panel B illustrates an analogous section from the heart of a
  patient with ARVC who died suddenly: Fibro-fatty tissue has replaced the muscular
  one. Desmosomes are not only structures supplying cell-cell adhesion, but they are
  also part of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway, which suppresses the expression
  of adipogenic and fibrogenic genes (Panel C and D). Therefore, on one hand the impairment
  of desmosomal lead to detachment of cardiomyocytes (double-headed arrow), on the
  other in a gene transcriptional switch from myogenesis to adipogenesis and fibrogenesis
  (Panel C and D) []. Modified from Ref [] with permission of the publisher.'
