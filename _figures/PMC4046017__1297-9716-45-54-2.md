caption: Inhibition of IFNg signaling by MAP. MAP infection inhibits JAK-STAT signaling
  via increased expression of negative regulators of the IFNγ receptor, SOCS1 and
  SOCS3, as well as decreased expression of IFNγ receptor chains 1 and 2. These modifications
  of cellular responsiveness occurred in temporal fashion with early induction of
  SOCS1 and 3 with subsequent repression of the IFNγ receptor. MAP inhibition of IFNγ
  responsiveness may be mediated by MAP effector molecule PtpB. PtpB may disrupt the
  normal IFNγ receptor immune signaling pathway by dephosphorylating a key signaling
  intermediate, or perhaps the receptor itself.
