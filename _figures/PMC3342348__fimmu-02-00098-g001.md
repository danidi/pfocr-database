caption: IL-1 signaling in the tumor microenvironment. IL-1 is a critical molecule
  in inflammation-associated carcinogenesis produced directly by tumor cells or cells
  of the tumor microenvironment. IL-1 signal transduction is initiated by binding
  of either form of IL-1 to IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI), which undergoes a conformational
  change allowing the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to recognize the
  ligated IL-1RI. IL-1RAcP does not recognize IL-1 but represents an essential component
  in the IL-1 signaling pathway (Wesche et al., ; Radons et al., ). The naturally
  occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) also binds to IL-1RI without leading
  to its activation. Ligand-mediated heterodimerization of the receptor complex leads
  to recruitment of dimeric myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88) via its TIR
  domain (Muzio et al., ; Wesche et al., ; Radons et al., ) followed by complex formation
  between IRAK-4, MyD88, and IL-1RAcP and subsequent phosphorylation of IRAK-4 (Cahill
  and Rogers, ). After recruitment of IRAK-1/Tollip to the complex, IRAK-1 is initially
  phosphorylated by IRAK-4 (Born et al., ; Dunne and O’Neill, ). Subsequently, IRAK-1
  (and possibly IRAK-2) becomes hyperphosphorylated and dissociates into the cytoplasm
  where it binds TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6; Cao et al., ). IRAK-1 interacts
  with membrane-bound TAK-binding protein 2 (TAB-2) as well as TAK-1/TAB-1 complex
  (Dower and Qwarnstrom, ) followed by translocation of TAB-2 from the plasma membrane
  to the signalosome and subsequent partial activation of TAK-1 by TAB-2. IRAK-1,
  presumably as dimer or oligomer, enables dimerization of TRAF-6 resulting in its
  ubiquitination and activation. In close proximity to TAB-2, TAK-1 is partially activated
  followed by complete activation through polyubiquitinated TRAF-6 (Kishimoto et al.,
  ; Martin and Wesche, ) enabling activation of numerous signaling cascades. Polyubiquitination
  of TRAF-6 obviously occurs through IRAK-2 (Keating et al., ). On the one hand, TAK-1
  activates certain members of the MAP kinase family leading to activation of AP-1
  and ATF (Ninomiya-Tsuji et al., ; O’Neill, ; Hefler et al., ; Blanco et al., ) the
  latter augmenting NF-κB-mediated transcription via transactivation (Jefferies and
  O’Neill, ; Cahill and Rogers, ). On the other hand, TAK-1 phosphorylates and activates
  IKK resulting in phosphorylation and inactivation of IκBα (Wang et al., ). Afterward,
  IκBα dissociates from the complex with NF-κB and undergoes proteasomal degradation.
  After phosphorylation, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and activates NF-κB-dependent
  gene transcription (Chen and Greene, ). Inhibitors of NF-κB activation are indicated
  that suppress the inflammatory network in cancer development. IL-1 signaling also
  involves recruitment of PI3-kinase (PI3K) to the IL-1 receptor complex via the p85
  regulatory subunit of PI3K (Reddy et al., ) and subsequent activation of AKT/PKB
  leading to IKK-dependent activation of NF-κB and AP-1 (Cahill and Rogers, ). Receptor
  ligation can also activate numerous G proteins resulting in activation of AP-1 and
  ATF mediated by several MAP kinases and an IκBα-independent transactivation of NF-κB
  (Singh et al., ; Jefferies and O’Neill, ). IL-1 signaling finally regulates gene
  expression of a great variety of tumorigenic factors including pro-angiogenic factors
  (IL-8, VEGF), growth factors (IL-6, GM-CSF), anti-apoptotic factors (Bcl-XL, c-FLIP),
  invasion-promoting factors (MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, uPA), inflammatory enzymes (PGHS-2,
  LOX), prostaglandins, iNOS, chemokines (CCL2, CCL20, IL-8), and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-23, TNF, TGF-β, EGF, RANKL).
