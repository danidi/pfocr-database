caption: '(A) Epithelial or astrocyte migrating into a wound area; (B) neuronal cell
  extending axon and dendrites; (C) Cytoskeletal organization and signaling proteins
  at the leading edge: The actin (G- & F-actin) cytoskeleton (red) provides a membrane
  protrusive force by actin polymerization at the leading edge. The microtubule (MT)
  cytoskeleton (green) delivers membrane components via the secretory pathway and
  provides a protrusive force by microtubule polymerization (pioneering) and bundling.
  The microtubule-organizing center (MTOC, green dots in A and B) orients towards
  the direction of extension, and microtubules orient along the axis of extension,
  being laterally guided by cortical actin bundles attached to focal adhesions. Growth
  factor signals and integrin-matrix adhesion at the leading edge stimulate small
  GTPases Cdc42, Rac and Rho. Cdc42 and Rac promote actin polymerization by activating
  the WASP- and WAVE-Arp2/3 actin-nucleation complexes in filopodia and lamellipodia.
  In epithelial cells, Rho promotes directed migration by inducing actin/myosin contractility
  in the rear and contraction forces at actin bundle-focal adhesion connections in
  the front. In neuronal cells, an actin arc separates the central microtubule rich
  area of the growth cone from peripheral actin rich lamellipodia and filopodia and
  Rho activity promotes growth cone repulsion. Small GTPases also activate the leading
  edge-enriched MAP APC. The mechanism of this activation is poorly understood but
  activated APC promotes directed cell extension probably by interacting with the
  microtubule plus-end binding protein EB1 and regulating microtubule dynamics at
  the leading edge. APC can interact with actin either directly via its actin binding
  domain or indirectly via binding to the CDC42/Rac effector and actin binding protein
  IQGAP.'
