caption: miRs regulate vascular medial calcification. miRs play an integral role in
  regulating vascular medial calcification by initiating vascular smooth muscle transition
  to calcifying vascular cells that express the master osteoblast transcription factors,
  Runx2 and osterix. These osteoblast-like cells also express alkaline phosphatase
  and elaborate bone matrix. Smooth muscle cell transdifferentiation occurs concomitant
  with the downregulation of smooth muscle cell contractile proteins. Calcifying smooth
  muscle cells generate matrix vesicles that contribute to vascular medial calcification
  by serving as a nucleation site for calcium phosphate. These matrix vesicles may
  also carry miRs that regulate phenotype in other cells. miRs also inhibit osteoclastogenesis
  and likely limit the bone resorptive capacity of osteoclast-like cells in the vessel
  wall to promote vascular calcification. This system has significant redundancy,
  and several miRs target the same protein or signaling pathway.
