caption: ER stress-mediated apoptosis. ER and mitochondria may directly initiate signaling
  pathways for the activation of the caspase cascade that results in apoptotic cell
  death. Members of all classes of the Bcl-2 family of proteins localize not only
  to the outer mitochondrial membrane, but also to the ER membrane. The anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 members of family proteins may inhibit activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
  such as Bax/Bak. Under ER stress conditions active BH3 domain-only proteins trigger
  the oligomerization of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and Bak, creation of Bax/Bak
  pores within mitochondrial outer membrane, and subsequently its permeabilization.
  As a consequence, cytochrome c is released into the cell cytosol where it binds
  to Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 and forms an apoptosome complex. This triggers the activation
  of the caspase cascade, which finally may elicit mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.
  On the other hand, prolonged ER stress can trigger caspase-12-mediated apoptosis.
  Caspase-12, associated with the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane, is activated
  under chronic ER stress in response to calcium leakage from the ER lumen. This leads
  to rapid activation of the calcium-calpain-caspase-12-caspase-3 cascade and, as
  a result, ER stress induced apoptotic cell death ensues.
