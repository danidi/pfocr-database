caption: Mechanisms of translation control of gene expression. At least three mechanisms
  have been identified via which extracellular signals can regulate the rate-limiting
  step of translation, initiation (Star 1 to 3). (Star 1) The kinase mTOR can be activated
  downstream of PI3Kinase/AKT signaling and under certain circumstances by ERK. The
  primary target for mTOR (when it is associated with raptor, forming the mTORC1 complex)
  is 4E-BP. When 4E-BP is not phosphorylated, it binds to eIF4E and suppresses translation.
  When 4E-BP is phosphorylated it dissociates from eIF4E, allowing the binding of
  eIF4G and the modulation of eIF4E activity by ERK/MNK1 signaling. mTOR also phosphorylates
  S6 kinase (S6K), leading to phosphorylation of eIF4B and ribosomal S6 protein (rS6).
  (Star 2) ERK and p38 signal via MNK1 to increase eIF4E phosphorylation. This phosphorylation
  of eIF4E is linked to an increased affinity for eIF4G and the formation of this
  complex is involved in the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit. (Star 3) The
  initiation factor eIF2α, when unphosphorylated, is also involved in the recruitment
  of the 40S ribosome subunit. eIF2α is phosphorylated by GCN2 in conditions of cellular
  stress, and genetic modulation of eIF2α phosphorylation has shown that eIF2α plays
  an important role in synaptic plasticity. (Star 4) A subset of mRNAs contain a 5′
  terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) and largely encode ribosomal proteins and elongation
  initiation factors. Increased mTOR activity is positively linked to the translation
  of these mRNAs as well as rS6 phosphorylation; however, genetic studies clearly
  show that rS6 is dispensable for this effect. (Star 5) Translation is also regulated
  by mRNA localization, miRNAs and the miRNA pathway. Key RNA binding proteins involved
  in RNA localization in neurons are staufen (which binds to hairpins) and FMRP (which
  binds to G-quartets, among other structures and sequences). FMRP has also been shown
  to bind to miRNAs and proteins involved in the miRNA pathway such as dicer and argonaute
  (AGO1).
