caption: T cells can be redirected to have specificity for tumors by the introduction
  of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) proteins. CARs targeting is controlled via an
  extracellular ectodomain that is comprised of light and heavy variable regions (VL
  and VH) from an antibody bound together with a peptide linker and attached to the
  transmembrane region with a hinge peptide. The endodomain controls intracellular
  signaling and activation and is comprised of conserved modules. First-generation
  CAR endodomains use the CD3-ζ ITAM, whereas second generation CARs include one costimulatory
  domain and third generation CARs contain multiple costimulatory domains. Fourth
  generation CARs termed “TRUCKs” that include an inducible pathway for the expression
  of a transgenic product.
