caption: Proposed model of p38 MAPK regulation of mRNA translation. The figure depicts
  pathways by which p38 in the setting of cytokine signaling has been previously shown
  to affect gene transcription (leftmost pathway) and mRNA translation (middle two
  pathways) by way of direct phosphorylation of targets (transcription factors, Mnk1/2,
  and eEF2K). With this study, we propose a new pathway (rightmost pathway in bold),
  whereby p38 regulates the activity of hypusinating enzymes (DHS and/or DHH), which
  subsequently control the action of eIF5A. The figure is not meant to indicate that
  regulation of the hypusination enzyme(s) by p38 is necessarily direct (i.e. by a
  phosphorylation event), because the mechanism of this regulation remains to be elucidated.
  eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; eEF2K, eukaryotic translation
  elongation factor 2 kinase.
