caption: Glutamate acts as a nitrogen donor for the transamination involved in the
  production of ‘dispensable amino acids’ alanine, aspartate, and serine through the
  actions of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvate transaminase
  (GPT) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), respectively. Glutamine can
  also act as a nitrogen donor for asparagine through asparagine synthetase (ASNS).
  In a reaction independent of transamination, proline can be synthesized by conversion
  of glutamate to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) by pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase
  (P5CS; also known as aldehyde dehydrogenase 18 family member A1, (ALDH18A1)) and
  subsequently to proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) and PYCR2.
  Glutamine also contributes to the tripeptide glutathione (composed of glutamate,
  cysteine and glycine), which neutralizes the ROS H2O2. The first step in glutathione
  synthesis is the condensation of glutamate and cysteine through glutamate-cysteine
  ligase (GCL; not shown in the figure). Glutamine input directly contributes to the
  availability of cysteine and glycine for production of glutathione. Glutamate can
  be exchanged for cystine (which is quickly reduced to cysteine inside the cell)
  through the xCT antiporter (a heterodimer of SLC7A11 and SCL3A2), which has been
  shown to be important in a variety of cancers and has been considered as a drug
  target , . Glycine is next added by glutathione synthetase (GSS; not shown in the
  figure). Additionally, glutamate can contribute to glycine through transamination
  by PSAT1 into phosphoserine (pSer) and α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and subsequent conversion
  to glycine through serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT; not shown in the figure)
  as part of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, which has been shown in numerous studies
  to be critical in cancer metabolism and is also reviewed in this Focus Issue by
  Dr. Karen Vousden , , . GLS, kidney-type glutaminase; GLS2, liver-type glutaminase;
