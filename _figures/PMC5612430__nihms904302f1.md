caption: 'Choline and methyl group metabolism and its relation to DNA methylation
  and influence on regulation of gene expression: a simplified diagram. Choline is
  used as a precursor of phosphatidylcholine, acetylcholine [in a reaction catalyzed
  by choline acetyltransferase (CHAT)], or betaine [in a reaction catalyzed by choline
  dehydrogenase (CHDH)]. The methyl groups of betaine are used by betaine:homocysteine
  S-methyltransferase (BHMT) to regenerate methionine from homocysteine. In an alternative
  pathway, catalyzed by vit. B12-requiring 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine S-methyltransferase
  (MTR), methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3THF) is used as a methyl donor. Methionine is
  used as a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in a reaction catalyzed by
  methionine adenosyltransferase(s) (MAT1A, MAT2A or MAT2B). AdoMet is used by multiple
  methylating enzymes including DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B) that
  use AdoMet as a donor of methyl groups to methylate DNA at the 5-position of cytosine
  residues within the CpG sequences. The DNA methylation state and pattern exerts
  a modulatory influence on expression of multiple genes (see text). The second product
  of this, and all other AdoMet-requiring methylation reactions, S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (AdoHcy) is hydrolyzed to free homocysteine by AdoHcy hydrolase (AHCY). The metabolic
  pathway linking choline to DNA methylation is indicated by thick arrows.'
