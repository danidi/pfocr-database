caption: HES1 usually functions to inhibit differentiation in normal cells and tumors.
  HES1 is induced in quiescent cells, possibly through signaling from the notch pathway,
  the JNK pathway or other pathways. In cancer cells, HES1 upregulation likely occurs
  via the notch pathway or the hedgehog pathway. Small molecule inhibitors of the
  notch and hedgehog pathways have shown promise as anti-cancer agents possibly in
  part due to their effects on HES1. HES1 functions as a transcriptional repressor
  by interacting with histone deacetylases including HDAC1. HDACi’s have many cellular
  effects, including inhibition of HDAC1 activity and might thereby repress the effects
  of HES1. Agents that directly induce differentiation can also be effective as anti-cancer
  agents. Further, combinations of these agents can often be even more effective than
  the agents individually, possibly due to regulation of different sets of targets
  or a stronger regulation of key target genes.
