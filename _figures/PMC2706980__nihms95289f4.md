caption: Regulation of L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) phosphorylation by psychostimulants.
  LTCC phosphorylation and activity are regulated by dopamine D1 and D2 receptors.
  Stimulation of D1 receptors activates protein kinase A (PKA) that phosphorylates
  LTCCs, increasing its activity. Stimulation of D2 receptors activates phospholipase
  C (PLC)/Ca2+pathway that in turn activates the phosphatase, calcineurin (PP2B).
  PP2B dephosphorylates LTCCs, decreasing its activity. Acute cocaine has been found
  to phosphorylate the striatal-enriched phosphoprotein, RCS (regulator of calmodulin
  signaling), also known as ARPP-21. Phospho-RCS acts as an inhibitor of PP2B, is
  regulated by D2signaling, and has been found to regulate LTCC activity. Hence we
  speculate that via phospho-RCS, psychostimulants increase phosphorylation of LTCCs,
  activating LTCC-mediated Ca2+signaling and gene expression.
