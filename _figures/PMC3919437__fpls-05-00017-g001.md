caption: Induction of carbohydrate metabolic pathways upon plant’s exposure to avirulent
  pathogens and pathogen-derived elicitors contributes to positive and negative regulation
  of defense responses. Carbohydrate metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the pentose
  phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) are shown in yellow, indicating
  upregulation in the presence of avirulent pathogens or pathogen-derived elicitors.
  Some proteins, such as CwINV, HXK, CPR5, and PDC, are highlighted as components
  proposed to play a positive (arrows) or negative (blunt-ended lines) role in regulating
  known defense responses (shown in pink) such as the generation of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and the activation of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR) leading to
  the hypersensitive response (HR). HXK, hexokinase; CPR5, constitutive expresser
  of PR genes 5; PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; ISL, isocitrate lyase. Dashed lines
  represent hypothetical regulatory mechanisms.
