caption: FunCoup subnetwork of candidate cancer gene RPA1 surrounded by functionally
  coupled known cancer genes. RPA1 is the yellow circle, whereas the known cancer
  genes are colored/shaped according to KEGG () pathway membership. Note that KEGG
  contains a relatively small number of cancer pathways; hence, most genes are not
  assigned to any pathway (gray balls). All green genes are from cancer pathways,
  however. The figure was made using the jSquid applet ().
