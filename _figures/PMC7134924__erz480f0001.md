caption: A summary of the trehalose biosynthetic pathway and its role in regulating
  resource allocation. TPSs (trehalose phosphate synthases) and TPPs (trehalose phosphate
  phosphatases) regulate the synthesis of trehalose 6-phosphate, a key metabolic signal
  and regulator of SnRK1 (SNF1-related kinase 1). SnRK1 regulates TPS by phosphorylation
  and activates TPP transcription through the C/S1 group bZIPs (; ). SnRK1 regulates
  biosynthetic pathways through regulation of gene expression (starch, oil, and cell
  wall) (; ; ) and sucrose allocation through regulation of SWEET transporter transcription
  ().
