caption: Glucose metabolism. Both glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) released from the intracellular
  glycogen stores by glycogen phosphorylase (GP), as well as the glucose introduced
  into the cell are converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucomutase (PGM)
  and hexokinase (HK), respectively. The G6P can be directed to different destinations.
  One of them is the pentose phosphate pathway for the formation of nucleic acids,
  which is directed by the G-6-P dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), forming the first product
  of 6-phosphoglucose δ-lactone (PGL). Another destination can be glycolysis, in which
  the phosphofructokinase (PFK) plays a primordial role, producing fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
  (F-1,6-BP); the glycolytic reactions will culminate in the production of pyruvate
  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate can be fermented in lactate by the catalysis
  of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as happens during anaerobic muscle exercise.
  On the other hand, pyruvate can be used to obtain ATP through oxidation. The first
  enzyme that participates in this chain of reactions is the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH), which produces Acetyl CoA, a substrate of the Krebs cycle, which together
  with oxidative phosphorylation produces molecules of ATP, carbon dioxide (CO2),
  and water (H2O). Glucose, moreover, in addition to being the fuel of the cell’s
  energy metabolism, is also used by the cellular machinery as a vitally important
  substrate for the production of key intermediaries of the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP). GS, glycogen synthase; O-GlcNAc, β-linked N-acetylglucosamine; GLUT,
  Glucose transporters.
