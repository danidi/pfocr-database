caption: In the extrinsic pathway, the apoptotic program is initiated by engagement
  of membrane-bound DRs with their ligands. Ligand binding leads to aggregation of
  DRs and recruitment of adaptor proteins and initiator pro-caspases, such as pro-caspase-8
  to form the DISC complex. Pro-caspase-8 is then converted to active caspase-8, which
  further activates the effector caspase-3. Active caspase-3 initiates the downstream
  caspase cascade leading to apoptosis. DR-initiated pathway is negatively regulated
  by c-FLIP, which inhibits DISC formation and activation of caspases 8 and 10 and
  prevents the downstream apoptotic signaling. The intrinsic pathway is initiated
  by receptor-independent stimuli, such as DNA damage, which triggers mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) by activation of Bcl-2 homologous proteins.
  MOMP causes inner membrane permeability and initiates release of pro-apoptotic proteins
  such as cytochrome C. The proteins released from mitochondria activate caspase-9,
  which further activates downstream caspase cascade leading to programmed cell death.
