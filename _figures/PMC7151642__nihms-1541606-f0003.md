caption: In early preneoplastic cells, the cGAS-STING pathway exerts its function
  as a tumor suppressor against oncogenic effects induced by DNA damage. Several sources
  of DNA damage, such as oxidative stress, radiation, low chromosome instability,
  hyper-activation of oncogene signaling, and chemotherapies, generates cytosolic
  DNA, which is sensed by cGAS within tumors. cGAS, in turn stimulates STING to upregulate
  the expression of type 1 IFN, ISG, and SASP genes. Through an unknown mechanism,
  STING-mediated autophagy may cooperate with IRF3 and canonical NF-κB signaling to
  inhibit or delay cancer progression. In addition, the cGAS-STING pathway allows
  crosstalk between tumors and neighboring immune cells to regulate antitumor immunity.
  Tumor-derived cGAMP and tumor DNA licenses antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic
  cells, to activate cGAS-STING signaling, triggering immune cells to mediate tumor
  clearance. Artwork by Terry Helms, Graphics Department, MSKCC.
