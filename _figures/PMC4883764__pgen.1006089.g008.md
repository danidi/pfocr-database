caption: Upon injury or septic injury, haemocytes release Upd3 into the haemolymph.
  Upd3 with Upd2 then activates the JAK/STAT pathway in both progenitor cells and
  in the surrounding visceral muscles to stimulate intestinal stem cell proliferation
  and differentiation. The modulation of the gut epithelium renewal by wounding and
  septic injury then promotes survival of flies. It is likely that septic injury damages
  the intestine, and that haemocytes provides an anticipatory mechanism to repair
  the gut.
