caption: 'All metabolites measured in our study for intermediary metabolism are shown
  in black boxes. Significantly changing (p<0.05, q<0.05) metabolites from day 1 to
  5 were identified by a one-way ANOVA. The direction of change is denoted by: Red=Increasing,
  Light Blue=Decreasing, and Black=No significant change. Similarly temporally regulated
  metabolites, but those that show significant difference between Control & Venomated
  at day 5, are indicated by *. (a) Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and polyol biosynthetic
  pathway: Although polyols increase in both treatments, sorbitol levels are significantly
  higher in Venomated hosts. In Venomated hosts, glycolysis is dysregulated, and the
  increase in lactate and alanine indicates a switch to anaerobic respiration. (b)
  TCA cycle: Synthesis of metabolites involved in succinate turnover (italicized)
  is under control of enzymes that are found only in the mitochondria. Hence the decrease
  in α-ketoglutarate and succinate in Venomated hosts may indicate altered mitochondrial
  function. Enzyme isoforms for fumarate and malate synthesis exist in the cytoplasm,
  and this could account for increases of these metabolites in Venomated hosts.'
