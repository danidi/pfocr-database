caption: 'Conceptual model for dystonia and motor control driven by a combination
  of imaging data, motor circuitry cytoarchitecture, and clinical features of dystonia.
  This model builds on previous models and proposes three key new features that help
  to provide a more explicit mechanism for dystonia; these features are highlighted
  in gray shaded areas, A, B, and C, and are discussed in more detail in []. The model
  argues that dystonia is stereotyped because it reflects excessive amplification
  of a normal brain functional system. It also argues dystonia can be qualitatively
  heterogeneous because that functional system has several qualitatively different
  subcomponents. The proposed toggle system between activation of rest versus movement-related
  posture/stabilization programs would not only provide a highly efficient mechanism
  for coordinating across different postural subcomponents with a single neuron, but
  also offers a potential explanation why dystonia can be observed in both “low” and
  “high” dopamine states, such as in peak and end dose dystonias in Parkinson’s Disease
  []. The circuitry diagram here is shown in the “rest” or “tonic” dopamine state,
  and would be reversed during the “activated” or “phasic” state. Blue=movement-related
  circuitry; Orange=posture/stabilization-related circuitry. Solid lines indicate
  neuron is activated; dotted lines indicate neuron is inhibited. Plus and minus signs
  indicate whether a given neuron has an excitatory or inhibitory effect on its efferents
  (where multiple neuron types are present in a pathway, such as cerebellar output,
  no specific sign is indicated). GPi: internal globus pallidus; RN: red nucleus;
  PPN: pedunculopontine nucleus; Thal: thalamus.'
