caption: Effects of AXT107-treatment in retinal vascular disease. (1) AXT107 binds
  to αvβ3 integrins and dissociates them from VEGFR2. (2) The disruption of these
  interactions directly inhibits the autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 in the presence
  of VEGF and further reduces VEGFR2 responses by increasing the internalization and
  degradation of the receptor, overall reducing the angiogenesis responses and induction
  of vessel permeability (3). (4) AXT107 also binds to α5β1 integrin heterodimers,
  which associate with Tie2, and dissociates the subunits. (5) α5 integrin and Tie2
  then relocate to the endothelial cell–cell junctions and form clusters that can
  be activated following the binding of either Ang1 or Ang2. (6) Active Tie2 clusters
  stimulate downstream pathways associated with improved endothelial cell survival
  and the reorganization of intracellular actin from stress fibers into cortical actin
  that is distributed around the edges of the cell to stabilize the vasculature. (7)
  Initial activation of TNFR by TNFα does not seem to be affected by AXT107 treatment,
  resulting in the release of Ang2 from Weibel-Palade bodies. The released Ang2 contributes
  to the activation of Tie2 clusters formed following AXT107 treatment. (8) Signaling
  by the phosphorylated Tie2 clusters prevent the degradation of IκBα molecules, retaining
  NF-κB within the cytoplasm and blocking the induction of inflammation and the associated
  effects on vessel permeability, thereby contributing to increased vessel stability
