caption: Schematic representation of the canonical JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The
  JAK/STAT pathway transmits extracellular cytokine signals to the nucleus. Upon binding
  of a cytokine to its transmembrane receptor, receptor-associated JAKs are activated
  and phosphorylate STAT proteins. Activated STAT proteins translocate as either homo-
  or hetero-dimers to the nucleus and modulate target gene transcription. In a negative
  feedback loop, SOCS proteins are expressed and inhibit the JAK/STAT signaling cascade
  by suppressing JAK kinase activity, by competing with STAT proteins for binding
  to the receptor and/or by proteasomal degradation of the proteins.
