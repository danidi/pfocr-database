caption: 'Schematic representation of the main cellular processes inhibited or activated
  by the silencing of HOTAIR in BC cells. HOTAIR knockdown in BC cells leads to the
  promotion of: (i) sensitivity to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapies
  and anti-HER2 therapies; (ii) luminal phenotype acquisition with the upregulation
  of luminal cytokeratins (KRT8), of cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, and of transcription
  factor GATA3, responsible of luminal epithelial differentiation in the adult mammary
  gland. Furthermore, HOTAIR silencing in BC cells leads to the inhibition of: (i)
  cell growth and proliferation by downregulating the main signaling pathways involved
  in these cellular processes, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathway, cyclin
  D1 and proliferation index Ki67; (ii) invasion and migration by downregulation of
  metalloproteinases; (iii) EMT by upregulating epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin,
  downregulating mesenchymal markers, such as Vimentin, and TGF-beta signaling; (iv)
  self-renewal, reducing colonosphere and mammosphere formation; (v) metastatic progression
  by upregulating metastasis suppressor genes, such as HOXD10, PCDHB5, and PCDH10.
  The green arrow indicates the activated processes, the symbol † the inhibited ones.
