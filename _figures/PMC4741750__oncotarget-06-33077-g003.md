caption: The expression of components of the Toll like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway
  in merged glioma datasets was plotted. The red color marks higher expression in
  high grade gliomas, while the blue color represents higher expression in low grade
  gliomas from merged datasets. The color scale represents magnitude of change. A
  gene which was not measured on analyzed microarrays, but is important for a graph
  structure, is marked in white. The lines link components of TLR pathway based on
  known gene-gene relations and their arrows indicate direction of downstream events.
