caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathway of the NOD-like receptors
  (NLR) containing a Pyrin Domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome following myocardial ischemic
  injury. Extracellular debris and intracellular stress signals activate the “danger
  sensor” NLRP3. NLRP3 recruits the adaptor protein ASC and the effector enzyme caspase-1.
  Caspase-1 converts the pro-forms of IL-1β and IL-18 into the biologically active
  forms, which are released into the interstitial space. In severe cases, the persistent
  inflammasome activity induces cell death. The release of active IL-1β and IL-18
  induces further myocardial damage and ventricular dysfunction.
