caption: Transcriptional Regulation of C2H4 Biosynthesis.Seven genes thought to encode
  C2H4biosynthetic enzymes are expressed in a ripening-related manner, five of which
  are under C2H4 control.(A) Pathway of C2H4 biosynthesis in tomato.(B) Expression
  profiles for TS, CGS, two likely MSR homologs, SAM1, ACS2, ACS4, and ACO1. Gray
  lines show pseudoreplicates in the TOM1 array for the gene shown; black lines show
  a running mean when pseudoreplicates exist or expression of the gene shown if no
  pseudoreplicates exist. Only ESTs with substantial sequence homology were considered
  (E-value <1 × 10−10), and all EST clones have been sequence verified. The vertical
  dashed line denotes the breaker stage of fruit development. E4, ripening-related
  protein E4.
