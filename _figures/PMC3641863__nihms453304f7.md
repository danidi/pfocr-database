caption: CASZ1 functions by binding to an intronic element within the Egfl7 locus
  to activate proper levels of Egfl7 in endothelial cells. EGFL7 is then secreted
  to the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it likely binds cell-surface receptors which
  signal downstream to activate RhoA expression. Consequently, RhoA signaling modulates
  endothelial cell behaviors such as adhesion and contractility to promote vessel
  assembly and morphogenesis.
