caption: Schematic representation of the possible mechanisms leading to ovarian cysts
  in female patients with ORD. Impaired sex steroid synthesis results in low E2 levels
  (right) causing hypergonadotropic hypogonadism with subsequent stimulation of the
  ovaries by the up-regulated gonadotropins. In addition, mutant POR affects the cholesterol
  synthesis pathway due to impairment of CYP51A1 activity (left) leading to decreased
  generation of MAS that are important for meiotic resumption and oocyte maturation.
  T-MAS, Testicular MAS. Each black arrow indicates an enzymatic reaction; dotted
  crosses indicate impairment of pathway reactions; gray arrows indicate increased
  (or decreased) serum levels.
