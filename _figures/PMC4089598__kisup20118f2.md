caption: Regulatory T cells and co-stimulatory pathways. (a) B7:CD28 pathway was demonstrated
  to have a major role in the generation and maintenance of regulatory T cells (Tregs),
  leading to some concerns on the effect of long-term B7:CD28 blockade on Tregs in
  transplantation. (b) Another concern arose from the discovery that Tregs use the
  inhibitory pathway B7:CTLA4 to suppress dendritic cell (DC) function via induction
  of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and inhibition of the maturation of DCs (not
  shown). However, Tregs also exert their suppressive function through other mechanisms,
  such as secretion of inhibitory cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-10, transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β) and granzyme B (GrB), possibly representing parallel pathways
  of immune regulation. APC, antigen-presenting cells; CTLA4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
  antigen-4; Teff, effector T cell.
