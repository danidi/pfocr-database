caption: A proposed model relating canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling with
  teneurin-3 expression. Our results suggest that upon Wnt3a activation, the canonical
  Wnt pathway is triggered, leading to the disassembly of the β-catenin destruction
  complex and to the accumulation of β-catenin within the cell. β-Catenin can then
  translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to the TCF/Lef transcription factor and
  thus causes the synthesis and release of the non-canonical ligand Wnt5a. Then, Wnt5a
  is released by the cell and is able to act in an autocrine or a paracrine manner,
  initiating transcription of the TEN-3 gene. In addition, the observation that several
  TCF7/Lef2 motifs are present in the promoter region of the TEN-3 gene and that Wnt5a
  can signal through β-catenin via ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) activity seem
  to further support this suggested cooperative mechanism between the canonical and
  non-canonical Wnt pathways.
