caption: 'Mathematical model describing the switch-like behavior of myogenic cells
  from proliferation to differentiation and its regulation by nuclear translocation
  of ERK. (A) Mechanistic model describing FGF-ERK signaling pathway. FGF signaling
  leads to phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in a sequential manner, followed by their
  translocation to the nucleus to activate target genes associated with proliferation
  of myogenic progenitors. (B) Inhibition of the FGF-ERK pathway leads to shuttling
  of ERK to the cytoplasm and consequently to myogenic differentiation. Inhibitors
  are SU5402 (green X), which blocks FGFR activity; UO126 (orange X), which prevents
  phosphorylation of ERK by MEK; EPE peptide (red X) reduces ERK translocation into
  the nucleus. (C) Simulated time course of the FGF-ERK pathway shows a switch taking
  place between FGF-treated cells in which myogenesis is inhibited and robust myogenesis
  in the presence of all other conditions. Low FGF signaling/SU5402, green solid line;
  UO126, orange dotted line; UO126+FGF, orange solid line; EPE, red dotted line; EPE+FGF,
  red solid line. (D) Modeling dose-response curves of phosphorylated ERK as a function
  of FGF levels. Shuttling of ERK between the cytoplasm and the nucleus transforms
  a graded response (no shuttling, blue) to a bi-stable on-off switch (shuttling,
  black) between the two cell fates: proliferation or differentiation.'
