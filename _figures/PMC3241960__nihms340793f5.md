caption: Sarcolemmal actin assembly and nuclear signaling. Recent studies have revealed
  that cytoplasmic actin assembly/disassembly may regulate transcriptional factors.
  The rho GTPase is a nodal molecule of this pathway and has been linked to various
  sarcolemmal activators (G protein coupling receptors, GPCR; tyrosine-kinase receptors,
  TyR; adhesion plaque complexes; and the caveolae-like structure). Cytoplasmic actin
  assembly has been found to regulate SRF transcriptional activities through G-actin
  association with megakaryotic acute leukemia (MAL)/myocardin-related transcriptional
  factors (MRTF) proteins. STARS (striated muscle activator of rho signaling) also
  regulates actin disassembly.
