caption: Schematic representation of the top‐scoring, statistically significant pathway
  map indicated downregulation of genes involved in immune response in myocardium
  of patients with repair of tetralogy of Fallot undergoing pulmonary valve replacement  (rToF‐PVR)
  . The top‐scoring map (map with the lowest P value) based on enrichment distribution
  sorted by "statistically significant maps" was the Immune response_Lectin induced
  complement pathway. This shows negative regulation (blue thermometer) of most genes
  involved in this pathway, implying suppression of immune pathways in rToF‐PVR myocardium.
  Only 1 gene displayed upregulated expression (red thermometer). Many genes in the
  second and third top‐scoring maps overlapped with this map. The material in this
