caption: HMGB1 participates in inflammatory processes. HMGB1 exists in redox form
  after initially being passively released or actively secreted from cells. The redox
  form of HMGB1 can form a heterocomplex with CXCL12 and this complex binds to CXCR4,
  and macrophages are recruited after that. Macrophages secrete ROS and transform
  HMGB1 to disulfide form. The disulfide form of HMGB1 cannot interact with CXCL12
  and CXCR. The disulfide HMGB1 binds to MD2-TLR4 complex and activates the NF-kB
  signaling pathway, proinflammatory cytokines are transcriptionally activated and
  secreted extracellularly subsequently. The disulfide HMGB1 is eventually oxidized
  to fully oxidized form and loses inflammation inducing capability. Black arrows
  indicate secretion or activation of the downstream targets, while blue arrows represent
  the alterations of the next inflammatory stage.HMGB, high mobility group box; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
