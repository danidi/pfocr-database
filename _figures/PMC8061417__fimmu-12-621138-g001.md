caption: Mechanisms of pre-sensitization via the indirect T cell-allorecognition pathway.
  (1) A patient is first exposed to foreign HLAs by pre-sensitizing events, such as
  blood transfusion, pregnancy, or prior organ transplantation. (2) The foreign HLAs
  are processed into smaller peptides by the patient’s antigen-presenting cells. Among
  them, non-self peptides are loaded onto the recipient HLA class II, and the antigens
  are presented on the cell surface. (3) Patient’s naïve CD4+ T-helper cells recognize
  T cell epitopes consisting of the foreign-HLA-derived peptide in the context of
  recipient HLA class II (pHLA), which allows naive CD4+ T-helper cells to differentiate
  into memory cells. (4) These memory CD4+ T cells lead to an enhanced rapid response
  after second encounters with the same pHLAs derived from the donor HLA. The donor-reactive
  memory CD4+ T-helper cells were considered to be positive if the foreign-HLA-derived
  pHLAs were shared with donor-HLA-derived pHLAs, and negative if not shared.
