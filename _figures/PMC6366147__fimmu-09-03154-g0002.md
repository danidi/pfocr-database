caption: Role of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway in antitumor
  immunity. By inducing Type I IFN release from antigen presenting cells (APCs), radiation
  therapy (RT) can enhance antigen uptake by specialized dendritic cells (DCs) known
  as Batf3 DCs. This stimulates maturation of DCs and the cross-presentation of tumor
  associated antigens (TAA) to CD8+ T cells, which exhibit antitumor immunity after
  proliferation and infiltration into tumor microenvironment. DNA from tumor cells
  is recognized by cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS to produce cGAMP for STING activation
  and cytokine production, which stimulate the maturation of DCs and stimulate the
  cross-presentation of TAA to CD8+ T cells, which exhibit antitumor immunity after
  proliferation and infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.
