caption: 'Upregulation of multiple genes involved in morphine biosynthesis due to
  inoculation of a consortium of endophytes. SM1B (Acinetobacter) endophytes upregulated
  the expression of most of the genes of BIAs pathway except T6ODM and CODM whereas
  SM3B (Marmoricola sp.) inoculation upregulated the T6ODM and CODM. Consortium-inoculation
  (SM1B+SM3B) could enhance the morphine production by upregulating, the expression
  of most of the BIA biosynthetic genes (TYDC, NCS, 6OMT, CNMT, NMCH, SalSyn, SalR,
  SalAT, COR) involved in morphine biosynthesis to a greater extent, than that of
  single-inoculations. Expression of different genes was presented in square boxes.
  Red color of boxes indicate upregulated expression (intensity of red color shows
  the level of expression, i.e., more red more expression and vice versa), yellow
  color shows the level of expression in non-inoculated endophyte free control plants
  and light yellow color shows downregulated expression. Enzyme abbreviations: TyrAT,
  tyrosine aminotransferase; TYDC, tyrosine/ dopa decarboxylase; NCS, norcoclaurine
  synthase; 6OMT, (S)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase; CNMT, (S)- coclaurine N-methyltransferase;
  NMCH, (S)-N-methylcoclaurine 3-hydroxylase; 4-OMT, (S)-30-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine
  4-O-methyltransferase; DRS, 1,2-dehydroreticuline synthase; SalSyn, salutaridine
  synthase; SalR, salutaridine reductase; SalAT, salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase;
  T6ODM, thebaine 6-O-demethylase; COR, codeinone reductase; CODM, codeine O-demethylase.'
