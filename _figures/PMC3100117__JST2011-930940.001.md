caption: The canonical structure of a MAPK cascade. We used the Systems Biology Graphical
  Notation (SBGN) [] to represent the interactions between the MAP Kinases. Activations
  of MAPK occur through enzymatic phosphorylation and ATP consumption. Interactions
  with other components and in particular with phosphatases are not shown. In the
  case of the HOG pathway in yeast, dual phosphorylation of the final MAPK (Hog1p)
  occurs within a few minutes after an hyper-osmotic stimulus.
