caption: 'Model of regulation of balanced LPS and phospholipid biosynthesis: R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP
  serves as a common metabolic precursor for the LpxC–dependent LPS biosynthesis and
  the FabZ-mediated phospholipid biosynthesis. LpxC stability is regulated by previously
  established FtsH/LapB and, from this study, via the negative regulation by LapC
  counteracting the LapB/FtsH pathway and also at high temperature by HslVU proteolysis
  of LpxC.'
