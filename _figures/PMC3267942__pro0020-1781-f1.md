caption: 'UV lesions and their repair. A: Diagrams of CPD, 6-4 and dewar photoproduct
  and three different repair pathways. B: An outline of multiple steps in NER. Each
  step is labeled in bold font and dark blue. UV lesions are represented by red TT
  with an inverted V above. The NER pathway is divided into global genome (GGR, highlighted
  in dark red) or transcription coupled repair (TCR, in pale green) based on how lesions
  are initially recognized. The two branches converge afterwards. Proteins responsible
  for each step are shown above (bacterial) or below (eukaryotic) each arrow. In the
  TCR branch RNA polymerase and co-factors are omitted for clarity. C: Bypass of UV
  lesions during replication is achieved by either translesion synthesis (TLS) or
  homologous recombination (HR). The template strands are shown in black and daughter
  strands in blue.'
