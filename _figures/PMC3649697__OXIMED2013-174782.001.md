caption: Normal endothelial function versus endothelial dysfunction. Schematic overview
  of nitric oxide (NO) production and relaxation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMC).
  In response to increased shear stress or as a result of insulin signaling, the phosphoinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K)/akt pathway is activated leading to phosphorylation of endothelial
  Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS). eNOS, together with the necessary cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4), converts L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO. NO activates guanylyl cyclase,
  which induces smooth muscle relaxation, through increased production of cyclic Guanosine
  MonoPhosphate (cGMP). Superoxide reduced NO bioavailability by reacting with NO
  to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which has strong oxidant properties. Endothelial
  dysfunction in obese children is characterized by insulin resistance impairing insulin-mediated
  NO production and subsequent vasodilation. Furthermore, oxidized LDL and ADMA are
  inhibitors of eNOS activation. In the situation of diminished availability of BH4,
  eNOS becomes “uncoupled” and paradoxically leads to increased reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) generation, which also contributes to reduced bioavailability of NO and vasoconstriction.
