caption: 'Components of the Legume SYM Signaling Pathway.The SYM pathway shared between
  AM and rhizobial symbioses consists of seven proteins: a receptor-like kinase encoded
  by SYMRK/DMI2 (; ); putative cation channels encoded by the highly homologous genes
  CASTOR and POLLUX/DMI1 (; ); nuclear porins, encoded by NUP85 and NUP133 (; ); a
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase encoded by CCAMK/DMI3 (; ); and a protein encoded
  by CYCLOPS (IPD3) (; ). SYMRK, CASTOR, POLLUX, NUP85, and NUP133 are required for
  Ca2+ spiking, an early response of root hairs to Nod factor application and to approaching
  AM fungi (). The calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase CCAMK/DMI3 is thought to decipher
  the calcium signals (DMI3) (; ; ). CYCLOPS (IPD3) interacts with CCAMK, serves as
  a phosphorylation substrate for CCAMK (; ), and is required for mycorrhizal colonization
  (). The proteins shown in boldface were investigated in this study.'
