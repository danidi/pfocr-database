caption: FoxO role in the regulation of oxidative stress is evolutionarily conserved.
  FoxO are the mammalian homologues of DAF-16 in Caenorhabditis elegans. These transcription
  factors are regulated by the highly conserved IGF-1 (Insulin)/PI3-kinase/AKT signaling
  pathway that suppress the activity of FoxO. Activation of DAF-16 enhances the worm's
  life span in part through resistance to oxidative stress. In mammals, active FoxO
  plays key roles in the regulation of transcription of several antioxidant enzymes,
  as well as the cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell-differentiation proteins.
