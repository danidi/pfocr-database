caption: 'Genes associated with AMD in extant studies are shaded in red. DHA = docosahexaenoic
  acid (a PPAR agonist). Diagram was generated with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® software.
  Full names for genes represented by symbols exist at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/.
  Direct effects of PPARGC1A are represented by blue arrows. Letters on the arrows
  represent the nature of evidence and are defined as follows: A = activation, E = expression,
  L = proteolysis, PP = protein-protein interaction, T = transcription.'
