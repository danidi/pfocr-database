caption: Overview of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways. T cells recognize the antigens
  presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) via their T cell receptor
  (TCR). This is not enough to turn on a T cell response and requires a second signal
  by the B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) costimulatory molecules. In the lymph node, where
  most of this interaction occurs, the molecules bind either to CD 28 and provide
  activation signals or to CTLA-4 and provide inhibitory signals. The blockade of
  CTLA-4 can therefore promote T cell activation and response. In the tumour microenvironment,
  long term antigen exposure leads to the expression of PD-1 receptor which inhibits
  T cell response when it binds to PD-L1 or PD-L2. The blockade of this inhibitory
  pathway results in the activation of T cells with more specificity to cancer cells.
