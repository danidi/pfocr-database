caption: (A) Schematic representation of the pheromone pathway. When α-factor binds
  its receptor Ste2, the GEF activity of this GPCR is activated, causing the dissociation
  of the heterotrimeric G protein. Free Gβγ can recruit the scaffold protein Ste5
  to the membrane, initiating the MAPK cascade. Phosphorylated Fus3 and Kss1 can phosphorylate
  other targets that initiate the mating response. (B) Image montage of YFP-Ste5 membrane
  recruitment. Saturating amounts of α-factor was added at time zero (indicated by
  the arrow) to strain YAB3770, and changes in fluorescence distribution were followed
  by time-lapse confocal microscopy. BF, bright field.
