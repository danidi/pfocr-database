caption: Model recapitulating the role played by HUWE1 in regulating Shoc2-supported
  ERK1/2 activity. (A) Shoc2 incorporates the E3 ligase HUWE1 into the Ras and RAF-1
  signaling complex. HUWE1-mediated ubiquitination of Shoc2 is necessary for the ubiquitination
  of RAF-1 and fine-tuning of RAF-1 activity and/or its levels in the complex. The
  identities of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and the E2 ubiquitin ligase (E2)
  allowing transient ubiquitination of Shoc2 remain to be determined. (B) The absence
  of HUWE1 impedes mechanisms modulating the activity of the ERK1/2 pathway.
