caption: Scheme for potential mechanisms underlying the protective action of IMP against
  alcoholic fatty liver. Our study suggests that the activation of ASMase and generation
  of ceramide in response to E feeding may underlie several effects of E, such as
  development of steatosis, glucose intolerance, impaired insulin signaling, and activation
  of stress kinases. Treatment with IMP inhibited the activity of ASMase, reduced
  hepatic ceramide content, and inhibited the activity of PP2A. IMP reversed several
  effects of E on the Akt and insulin signaling pathway, presumably from its effect
  on PP2A. The levels of p-p38 and p-JNK, but not p-ERK, were reduced by treatment
  with IMP. Further studies are needed to further determine the mechanism of IMP on
  these stress kinases and on the possibility that ceramide activates sterol regulatory
  element binding protein (SREBP)-1 in the liver of alcohol-fed mice. Ask1, apoptosis
  signal-regulating kinase-1.
