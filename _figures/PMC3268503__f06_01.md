caption: The Chl branch.The first step of the Chl branch is the insertion of Mg2+
  into Proto IX. As Proto IX is also a substrate for heme biosynthesis, the pathway
  is branched into the synthesis of Chl a or heme at this step. In the Chl branch,
  Mg-Proto IX is sequentially modified by methylation, formation of the fifth isocyclic
  ring and reduction of a side chain of the tetrapyrrole ring. The D ring of protochlorophyllide
  (Pchlide) is reduced stereospecifically to form chlorophyllide (Chlide) a. The resulting
  movovinyl Chlide a is esterified with a long chain polyisoprenol (geranylgeraniol
  or phytol) to synthesize Chl a. Phytol is provided from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate,
  which is produced via isopentenyl pyrophosphate in the non-mevalonate 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate
  pathway in plastids.
