caption: Gene map and enzymatic pathway leading to rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide
  (RGP) synthesis. (A) The gene loci responsible for synthesis of RGP are displayed.
  The overall fitness cost for losing each individual gene is color-coded and based
  on a combined score from growth phenotypes under various conditions compared to
  the wild-type parent strain, UA159, as described by Quivey et al. (). Briefly, a
  score of “0” indicated no viable organisms recovered (thus, presumably an essential
  gene); “1” was equivalent to <25% growth compared to the WT; “2” indicates between
  25% and 75% growth compared to WT; and “3” indicates >75% growth compared to that
  of the WT. (B) A depiction of the enzymatic pathway for RGP formation. The initiation
  of RGP synthesis relies on the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) onto a membrane-linked
  undecaprenol lipid carrier, facilitated by RgpG. RgpA, RgpB, and RgpF are rhamnosyltransferases
  that likely function in a stepwise fashion, each respectively adding the first three
  l-rhamnose units onto the lipid-linked GlcNAc, with further elongation of the polyrhamnose
  backbone carried out by alternating activities of RgpB and RgpF (). Side chains
  are formed by glucose linkages, carried out by the glucosyltransferase enzymes RgpE,
  RgpH, and RgpI (, ). The mature structure is then transferred to the extracellular
  space by the ABC transporter, made up of RgpC/RgpD ().
