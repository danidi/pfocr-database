caption: 'Schematic representation of epigenetic regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-α (PPARα) in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) genes (A–C) and PPARα signaling
  to the FAO metabolome (D). A: PPARα heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα)
  and binds to the specific region of DNA sequence known as the peroxisome proliferator
  receptor response element (PPRE)/direct repeat 1 (DR1) located in the promoters
  of PPARα target genes, which leads to initiation of transcription by recruiting
  RNA polymerase II (RNA POL II) and other transcription factors. Thus, PPARα positively
  regulates expression of FAO genes throughout the pathway. B: during pressure overload
  (PO), PPARα also interacts with sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which is a class III histone
  deacetylase (HDAC). PPARα recruits Sirt1 to the promoter regions of a subset of
  PPARα target genes that contain an “imperfect” PPRE/DR1, leading to transcriptional
  repression, presumably through deacetylation of histones. It is hypothesized that
  PPARα also interacts with other epigenetic modulators, which possibly affect the
  methylation (Me) and acetylation (Ac) of histones surrounding the PPARα-binding
  region. (“Me” in pink, associated with gene activation, e.g., H3K4; Me in gray,
  associated with gene repression, e.g., H3K9). C: promoters of genes that are upregulated
  by PPARα principally harbor the “perfect” PPRE/DR1, which contains the consensus
  sequence of two typical hexads with no more than one nucleotide mismatch (yellow).
  In contrast, the imperfect PPRE/DR1 contains one typical hexad and one nonconserved
  (atypical) hexad [red, bottom left, modified from Oka et al. ()] and is found in
  genes involved in β-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the electron
  transport chain (ETC) in the FAO downstream pathway. Thus, the PPARα-Sirt1 complex
  preferentially targets the FAO downstream pathway in the diseased heart, and the
  unique DNA sequences of PPREs allow PPARα to differentially regulate its target
  genes during PO. D: epigenetic modifications regulated by PPARα ultimately determine
  the metabolic phenotype of the diseased heart, which includes the FAO metabolome
  (i.e., free fatty acids, fatty acyl-CoA, carnitine, acylcarnitines, acetyl-CoA),
  fatty acid (FA) storage (triglycerides), and the redox status (cellular levels of
  NAD+, NADH, and FADH2). Free fatty acids are byproducts of lipolysis from triglycerides
  and are the ligands of PPARα. The altered myocardial contents of fatty acids and
  carnitine/acylcarnitine species (bold) are the signature of the metabolomic phenotype
  of the failing heart. OCTN2, organic cation/carnitine transporter 2; FABP, fatty
  acid-binding protein; FACS, fatty acyl-CoA synthetase; MCAD, medium-chain acyl-CoA
