caption: C21 steroids (pregnenolone and progesterone) are converted to androgens,
  such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (A-dione) by the sequential
  hydroxylase and lyase activities of CYP17A1 in the adrenal gland. Enzymes such as
  3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD)
  and steroid 5α-reductase (5α-SRD) participate in the intratumoural androgen metabolic
  pathway. The enzyme 3β-HSD metabolises DHEA to A-dione, Δ5-androstenediol (Δ5-Adiol)
  to testosterone (T) and epiandrosterone (EpiAND) to androstanedione (5α-A-dione).
  Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is reduced to 5α-androstane-3α, 17β -diol (3α-diol) and
  5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol (3β-diol) by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD)
  and 3β-HSD, respectively. 3β-diol is hydroxylated by cytochrome P450-7B1 (CYP7B1)
  to triols.
