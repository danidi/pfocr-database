caption: CoQ10biosynthetic pathway. Isopentenyl diphosphates derived from the mevalonate
  pathway generate geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Additional isopentenyl diphosphates
  are added by decaprenyl diphosphate synthase, which, in humans is a heterotetramer
  composed of two prenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 1 and two prenyl diphosphate
  synthase subunit 2 molecules. PHB is derived from the amino acids tyrosine or phenylalanine.
  After PHB and decaprenyl diphosphate are produced, at least seven enzymes catalyze
  condensation, methylation, decarboxylation, and hydroxylation reactions to synthesize
  CoQ10.,
