caption: Trans-interaction between cell type-specific CAMs, such as Duf (founder cell;
  with 5 Ig domains) and Sns (FCM; with 8 Ig domains), triggers distinct signaling
  events in founder cells and FCMs. Briefly, in the founder cell, activation of Scar
  results in the formation of a thin sheath of F-actin at the fusogenic synapse. In
  addition, the Rho1-Rok-MyoII pathway amplifies the mechanosensitive accumulation
  of MyoII at the fusogenic synapse. In the FCM, activation of both Scar and WASP
  leads to the formation of an F-actin-enriched focus, which is part of an invasive
  podosome-like structure. For the functions of other components shown here, see the
  text.
