caption: 'Simplified biotransformation scheme of tamoxifen in man. Tamoxifen is mainly
  N-demethylated to NDM-TAM and subsequently 4-hydroxylated to endoxifen. A minor
  pathway proceeds via 4-hydroxylation to 4OH-TAM followed by N-demethylation to endoxifen.
  The polymorphic CYP2D6 is involved in crucial steps of the endoxifen formation.
  Abbreviations used in diagram: cytochrome P450 (CYP), sulfonyltransferase (SULT),
  uridine-5′-diphosphoglucuronyltransferase (UGT), tamoxifen (TAM), N-desmethyltamoxifen
  (NDM), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH), endoxifen (END).'
