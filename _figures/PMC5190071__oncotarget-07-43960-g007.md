caption: AF1q enhances the expression of PDGF-B, which forms homodimers (PDGF-BB)
  that bind to the protein tyrosine kinase receptor PDGFR. Binding of PDGF-BB to PDGFR
  results in tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR. Src is recruited to phosphorated PDGFR
  and activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine 416. Activation of STAT3 occurs via
  phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 through the Src tyrosine kinase. Using selective
  inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (PP1 and imatinib), we showed that PDGFR and Src
  cooperate to mediate STAT3 activation in breast cancer cell lines. This signaling
  pathway affects multiple cellular processes including cell survival, metastasis,
  cell proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis, and immune modulation. Green arrows
  and red lines indicate activation and suppression, respectively.
