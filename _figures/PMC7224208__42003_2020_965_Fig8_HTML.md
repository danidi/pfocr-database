caption: a Transcriptome analysis of the subcutaneous (SCAT) and the visceral (EWAT)
  adipose tissues from mock-treated and IAV-infected mice revealed activation of the
  STAT1-dependent-IFN-mediated signaling pathway and the concomitant inhibition of
  the cholesterol biosynthesis pathways in both SCAT and EWAT. IAV infection was associated
  with rewired energy metabolism only in the SCAT, as reflected by activation of the
  sirtuin signaling pathway and inhibition of glycolysis, OXPHOS, and TCA cycle. This
  was associated with a white-to-brown phenotypic change of the SCAT. b In vitro IAV
  infection of preadipocytes and adipocytes led to activation of the IFN signaling
  pathways in both cell types. In preadipocytes only, IAV infection rewired cell metabolism
  through activation of the SGOC metabolic pathway. This was associated with the induction
  of a brown-like/beige genetic program in preadipocytes. OXPHOS = oxidative phosphorylation,
  ETC = electron transport chain, SGOC metabolism = serine-glycine-one-carbon metabolism.
  Activated and inhibited pathways are indicated in red and blue, respectively. Top
  upstream regulators are indicated in brackets.
