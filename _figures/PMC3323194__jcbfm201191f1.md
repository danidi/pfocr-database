caption: Two-compartment (neuron and astrocyte) model used to illustrate the metabolic
  pathway of label flow from BHB. CMRkb=(VAcCoA−kbA+VAcCoA−kbN)/2, CMRglc(ox)=(VpdhA+VpdhN+Vpc)/2.
  The OAA label distribution in astrocytes is shown for the pathway from succinate
  (equal labeling of OAA at C2 and C3) and pyruvate carboxylase (unlabeled carbon
  entry and dilution of OAA at C2). BHB, -β-hydroxybutyrate; OAA, oxaloacetate.
