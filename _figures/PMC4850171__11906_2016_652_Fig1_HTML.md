caption: 'Potential roles of fructose-derived de novo lipogenesis on cardiovascular
  health. De novo lipogenesis, i.e., synthesis of long-chain fatty acids from acetyl-coA
  precursors, can occur following the pre-respiratory degradation of any nutrients.
  This pathway is particularly active during fructose overfeeding experiments, however,
  and the high lipogenic potential of fructose is due to (1) an unregulated synthesis
  of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA and (2) a stimulation of lipogenic transcription factors
  CHREBP and SREBP-1c by intracellular fructose metabolites. In turn, this stimulation
  of de novo lipogenesis may be associated with increased VLDL-triglyceride secretion
  and intrahepatic fat accumulation. The outcome of this process may also depend on
  the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids (SFA:UFA) in blood lipids, affected
  by dietary fat as well as by the relative activities of the enzymes involved in
  synthesis (fatty acid synthase), elongation (elongases), and desaturation (stearoyl-CoA
  desaturase) of newly generated fatty acids. Abbreviations: ChREBP carbohydrate-responsive
  element-binding protein, SREBP-1c sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c,
  CoA coenzyme A, ACC acetyl-CoA carboxylase, FAS fatty acid synthase, SCD stearoyl-CoA
  desaturases, VLDL-TG triglycerides in very low-density lipoprotein fraction, SFA:UFA
  saturated-to-unsaturated fatty acids ratio'
