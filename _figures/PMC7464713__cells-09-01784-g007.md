number: Figure 7
caption: 'Schematic representation of the implemented model of the Wnt-independent
  β-catenin pathway. Arrows indicate the state change of the affected molecule, such
  as synthesis or degradation reactions (R1, R6, R9, R14, R15), complex formation
  or dissociation (R2, R3, R3r, R5, R11, R13), activation or inactivation (R4, R7),
  and shuttling (R10, R12). Note that double arrows represent reversible reactions/state
  changes. Reactions that occur more than once in the figure actually refer to one
  and the same reaction and have been included to increase readability. This applies
  in particular for complex formation, where for each molecule a separate arrow points
  to the final complex, while referring to the one reaction (e.g., R11: β-cat + ICAT
  ↔ β-cat/ICAT, β-cat (β-catenin), ICAT (inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF-4)). Arrows
  (or horizontal lines) that point towards another arrow indicate a promoting (or
  attenuating) effect of the molecule on the given reaction (R8, R14, R16). For example,
  SOX17 (SRY-box transcription factor 17) promotes the degradation of the β-catenin/TCF
  (transcription factor) complex (R14). Phosphorylated AXIN is labeled by a white
  P on a black circle while active, self-aggregated Dishevelled (DVL) complexes are
  indicated by an orange A. Please note that for some reactions the molecule’s state
  of activity is not relevant, e.g., the phosphorylation state of AXIN has no impact
  on its binding to activated Dvl (Dvl [A]). Please see the legend for a detailed
  description of the graphical elements used in the figure.'
