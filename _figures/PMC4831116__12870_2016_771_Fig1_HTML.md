caption: An overview of plant hormone signaling networks and their crosstalk in stress
  responses. ABA, SA, JA and ET are major players in stress response, with ABA mainly
  regulating osmotic stresses. SA, JA and ET control biotic stress responses. ABA
  and GA signaling pathways interact, with DELLAs serving as a crosstalk point, to
  influence the balance between seed dormancy and germination. SA and JA pathways
  are antagonistically regulated by several transcription factors. JA-ET crosstalk
  synergistically. Auxins, GAs and CKs participate in biotic stress responses via
  SA signaling pathway. CKs also crosstalk with ABA and function in drought and salinity
  stress responses. Arrows represent positive regulation (accumulation of transcripts,
  proteins or hormones), and blocked arrows represent negative regulation. For abbreviations
