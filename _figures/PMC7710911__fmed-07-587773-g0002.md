caption: 'ACAs and CENP-B: CENP-B bound to CCR3. Then, the cross-talk between CCR3
  and EGFR, which was mediated by the MMPs-dependent processing of pro HB-EGF, activated
  MAPK pathway, and production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, and promoted
  the migration of contractile-type PASMCs, further leading to vascular self-repair.
  ATAs from patients with SSc, when combined with CCR3-binding CENP-B, abolished the
  abovementioned pathway and inhibited the vascular self-repair. EGFR, epidermal growth
  factor receptor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like
  growth factor; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase.'
