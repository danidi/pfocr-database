caption: Results from our recent studies demonstrate that CNS drug delivery can be
  modified by targeting specific molecular structures of the BBB during pathophysiological
  stress such as H/R. TJ functional integrity can be maintained by scavenging ROS
  with an antioxidant drug such as TEMPOL. Targeting the TJ provides an opportunity
  to prevent blood-to-brain solute leak during ischemic stroke, thereby enabling control
  of CNS drug concentrations. In situations where increased uptake of therapeutics
  into the brain may be desirable, transporters such as Oatp1a4 can be targeted. Oatp1a4
  facilitates brain delivery of drugs that may exhibit efficacy in treatment of ischemic
  stroke such as statins and opioid peptide analgesics. The TGF-β signalling pathway
  offers an opportunity to control both TJs and transporters by targeting TGF-β receptors
  (i.e., ALK1, ALK5) with small molecule therapeutics such as SB431542. Although P-gp
  is also a critical determinant of CNS drug delivery, caution must be exercised when
  targeting this transporter to enable greater uptake of therapeutic agents into brain
  parenchyma. This warning arises from evidence obtained from several laboratories
  including our own that have shown that enhanced brain delivery of drugs can lead
  to CNS toxicity and unexpected adverse drug reactions.
