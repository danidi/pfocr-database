caption: Adenovirus-directed innate immunity through nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NFκB). (a) Adenovirus induces host cell secretion of IL-8
  (1), which regulates epithelial polarity of CarEx8 (2) and αV integrins (3), allowing
  adenovirus entry from apical surface of respiratory epithelial cells. (b) Host cell
  receptor binding also unmasks the viral membrane lytic protein-VI (green triangle),
  which activates a membrane repair system leading to the generation of plasma membrane
  ceramide lipids (4). Ceramides promote virus internalization and endosomal membrane
  penetration (5). Viral cell entry is also enhanced by elevated levels of autophagy
  via hypothetical mechanisms discussed in the text (6). (c) Adenovirus binding to
  host cell receptors elicits a first wave of NFκB activity (7). Endosomal penetration
  also contributes to NFκB activity through a cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway
  (8), and a p38-MAPK signaling cascade capable of activating EGFR (EGF receptor)
  stress responses (9). (d) In this review we discuss evidence suggesting that E3-RIDα
  regulates NFkB activity occurring downstream of TNF-α, by antagonizing stress-induced
  EGFR signaling in endosomes (10), and promoting post-internalization TNFR1 sorting
  to lysosomes (11); and downstream of LPS, by limiting cholesterol-dependent TLR4
  signaling from endosomes (12).
