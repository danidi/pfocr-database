caption: EET synthesis in endothelial cells. In response to bradykinin or other vasodilators,
  AA contained in endothelial phospholipids is released by a Ca2+-activated phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2). CYP epoxygenases oxidize the AA to EETs in a reaction that utilizes NADPH
  and O2, and the EETs are released from the cell. Although CYP epoxygenases can synthesize
  all four EET regioisomers as illustrated in the figure, 11,12- and 14,15-EET are
  the most abundant EETs produced by the endothelium and many other tissues. DHA or
  EPA epoxygenation by CYP epoxygenases has not been investigated in intact cells,
  so it is uncertain whether this receptor-mediated production mechanism also applies
  to ω-3 PUFA epoxides.
