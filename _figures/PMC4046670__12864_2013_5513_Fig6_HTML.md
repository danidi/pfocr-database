caption: Prioritized genes in apoptosis and TNFR2 signaling pathways. The graphical
  representation of the pathways is generated by the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)
  tool. The prioritized genes were highlighted by red dotted circles. The apoptosis
  and TNFR2 signaling pathways were extracted from the “canonical pathway” mappings.
  Genes are color coded by their differential expression levels between resistance
  and susceptible mouse strains. In particular, the genes with higher expression in
  susceptible mice than in resistance mice were colored red; whereas those having
  lower expression in susceptible than resistance mice were shown in green. The symbols
  used to represent molecules and relationships were illustrated in the legend.
