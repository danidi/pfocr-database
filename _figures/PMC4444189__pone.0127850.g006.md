caption: Pearson correlation coefficient analysis identified a number of miRNAs-mRNA
  correlation interactions. Only those interactions in which both miRNAs and target
  mRNAs significantly associated with differentiation and ATP level (FDR < 0.1) during
  C2C12 myotube induction were utilized to model an miRNA-regulatory network (IPA
  pathway designer tool). White nodes indicate mRNA target; edges indicate regulatory
  interaction between miRNA and target gene. Solid line label denotes negative regulation
  with negative correlation interaction; dashed line denotes indirect positive regulation
  with positive correlation interaction.
