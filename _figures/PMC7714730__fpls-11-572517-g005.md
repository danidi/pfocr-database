caption: 'A detailed schematic of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway as related to
  flower pigmentation in the four different cultivars of Primula vulgaris. Enzyme
  names and expression patterns are listed at each step. The expression level of each
  gene in each sample was averaged from three biological replicates of transcriptome
  sequencing. The color scale represents log2-transformed fold change values. Black
  indicates no change, green indicates downregulation, and red indicates upregulation.
  WL, HL, BS, and BO represent “White Lover,” “Huang Li,” “Beautiful Scenery,” and
  “Blue Onstar,” respectively. (A) In pink ellipse: quercetin-related compounds; (B)
  in pink ellipse: kaempferol-related compounds; (C) in yellow ellipse: gossypetin-related
  compounds; (D) in blue ellipse: herbacetin-related compounds. The yellow dashed
  frame represents the key steps of flavonoid synthesis in the yellow-flowered cultivar;
  the blue dashed frame represents the key steps of flavonoid synthesis in the blue-flowered
  cultivar; and the black dashed frame represents a lack of flavonoid synthesis in
  P. vulgaris cultivars.'
