caption: Working model for OmFCR. The genotoxic stress caused by cadmium might recruit
  the MMR system, which, in its turn, might promote the firing of OmFCR through protein–protein
  interactions with Mlh3p. The signaling pathway promoted by OmFCR appears to merge
  with the final part of the Mec1p-dependent phosphorylation cascade, at the Rad53p/Dun1p
  level. In pFL61-transformed cells (left) Dun1p is likely to recruit effector proteins
  that cause cell cycle arrest, while the presence of OmFCR (right) might enlist alternative
  effector proteins that ultimately allow the progression of cell division.
