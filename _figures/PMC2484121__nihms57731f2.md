caption: 'Small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs; bone sialoprotein
  (BSP), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) and osteopontin (OPN) are shown) can initiate
  Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD)-dependent and RGD-independent interactions with several integrins
  (such as αvβ3 and a9β1, respectively). OPN (and perhaps DMP1) can also interact
  with the CD44 family of receptors. Some of these complexes are able to mediate the
  following functions: (a) cell survival through phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ)–protein
  kinase C (PKC)–phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway activation that
  leads to anti-apoptotic signals in tumour cells. OPN-induced Akt phosphorylation
  can be blocked by the tumour suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue).
  However, PTEN is frequently mutated and thus rendered inactive in cancer cells such
  as melanoma and glioma; (b) motility through the activation of the canonical αvβ3
  integrin pathway where both nuclear factorinducing kinase (NIK)–ERK (extracellular
  signal-related kinase) and MEKK1 (also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase kinase 1 (MAP3K1)–JNK1 (also known as MAPK8) signalling promote cell migration
  by activating AP1- dependent gene expression (for a review see REF. ). Upon binding
  to αvβ3, OPN also stimulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation,
  ERK phosphorylation and AP1 activation; (c) bridging of otherwise soluble matrix
  metalloproteinases (MMPs) to cell membranes and their activation, enabling digestion
  of local extracellular matrix and thereby aiding tissue remodelling and cell migration
  through the extracellular matrix, a key step for cancer cell invasion; and (d) bridging
  and activation of complement factor H (CFH) to receptors including αvβ3 integrin.
  By promoting the degradation of the C3 convertase complex C3bBb, SIBLING-activated
  CFH disables the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and the subsequent
  lysis of cancer cells, thus favouring their escape from host immune defence. The
  ? illustrates that it is not known if all binding of SIBLINGs (with or without ligands)
  necessarily results in signal transduction. MKK4, MAP kinase kinase 4.'
