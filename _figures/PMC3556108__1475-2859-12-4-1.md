caption: The pathway for 1,2-Propanediol (1,2-PDO) production from CO2 in Synechococcus
  elongatus PCC 7942. A) Light reaction of photosynthesis generates ATP and reducing
  equivalents NADPH, which power the CO2 fixation through Calvin cycle and the synthetic
  1,2-PDO production pathway. gldA, yqhD and mgsA are from E.coli. Secondary alcohol
  dehydrogenases (sADHs) are from C. beijerinckii and T. brockii. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate. GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. F6P, fructose-6-phophate. B) Two possible
  pathways for 1,2-Propanediol synthesis from methylglyoxal.
