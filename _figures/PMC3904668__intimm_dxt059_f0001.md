caption: CD180 is a close relative of TLR4 and together with BCR signaling can promote
  B-cell activation and differentiation. The extracellular domains of CD180 and TLR4
  have 61% sequence similarity and 29% sequence identity and interact with 25kDa molecules
  MD-1 and MD-2, respectively. TLR4 and CD180 have different signaling domains in
  their cytoplasmic tails, but both molecules promote B-cell activation, proliferation
  and differentiation. Unlike TLR4, CD180 does not require MyD88/TRIF (TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor-inducing IFN-β)-dependent signaling. CD180 can activate PI-3K and Vav-1,
  and synergize with BCR signaling via a pathway yet to be defined to induce B-cell
  activation and differentiation.
