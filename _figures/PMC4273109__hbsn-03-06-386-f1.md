caption: Simplified TGF-β signaling. (A) The classical TGF-β signaling cascade is
  formed by different types of surface receptors (TβRI, TβRII), receptor-associated
  R-Smads (Smad2, Smad3) and common Smad (Smad4); (B) upon binding of TGF-β to TβRII,
  a TβRI is recruited that becomes transphosphorylated by TβRII. The R-Smads become
  phosphorylated, dissociate from the receptors and interact with Smad4. The R-Smad/co-Smad
  complex translocates into the nucleus and drives activation or repression of specific
  Smad-sensitive target genes; (C) simultaneous to the intermediation of the signal,
  an inhibitory I-Smad (Smad7) is transcriptionally induced by TGF-β. This I-Smad
  predicts a negative feedback inhibition loop that associates with activated TβRI
  thereby blocking further R-Smad phosphorylation and TGF-β signaling. Beside this
  simple pathway, TGF-β mediates signals via many other signaling cascades. In addition,
  TGF-β activity in various TGF-β sensitive cells is modulated by many other factors
  that can bind to TGF-β or enhance or blunt its activity. For details see text. TGF-β,
  transforming growth factor-β.
