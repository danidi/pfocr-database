caption: Molecular network based on some key metabolites reversed by resina draconis
  or isosorbide dinitrate treatment. Metabolites were represented as nodes, and the
  biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line. The colored
  nodes represent metabolites that occur in our data, while the transparent entries
  are molecules from the Ingenuity Knowledge Database. Red nodes represent upregulated
  metabolites, and green nodes represent downregulated metabolites. Solid lines between
  molecules indicate a direct physical relationship between molecules, and dotted
  lines indicate indirect functional relationships.
