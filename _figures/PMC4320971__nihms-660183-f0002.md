caption: De novo ceramide (Cer) synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). Cer is delivered by ceramide transport protein (CERT) or vesicular transport
  to the Golgi for synthesis of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) (by ceramide kinase, CERK),
  sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GluCer). Four-phosphate adaptor protein
  2 (FAPP2) then transports GluCer to the trans-Golgi for biosynthesis of complex
  glycosphingolipids (GSLs). SM and GSLs are delivered to the plasma membrane by vesicular
  transport and C1P by a C1P-specific transfer protein (CPTP). For signalling at the
  plasma membrane, sphingomyelinase (SMase), ceramidase (CDase), and sphingosine kinases
  (SphK) produce the bioactive metabolites Cer, sphingosine (Sph) and sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P), respectively. S1P is then transported across the membrane. Membrane sphingolipids
  are internalized by the endocytic pathway and in the lysosome they are degraded
  by acidic forms of SMase, glycosidase (GCase) and CDase. The Sph formed can be metabolized
  to glycerolipids after phosphorylation by SphKs (probably SphK1) and cleavage by
  S1P lyase (SPL) or reutilized for sphingolipid synthesis in the salvage pathway.
  In the nucleus, SphK2-produced S1P inhibits histone deacetylases.
