caption: '(A) The pathway analysis indicated that a large number of differentially
  expressed genes belong to canonical pathways such as IGF-1 signaling, steroidogenesis,
  chemokine signaling, prolactin signaling, cellular growth and proliferation, extracellular
  matrix modulation and apoptosis. The orange line represents score for the likelihood
  [-log (B-H p<0.05)] that genes belonging to a specific canonical pathway category
  affected at 3 h post PGF2α administration. The stacked bars indicate the percentage
  of genes distributed according to regulation, i.e., green (down), red (up) and open
  bars (no overlap with dataset) in each canonical pathway. (B) Network 0 vs. 3 h:
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the differentially regulated genes 3 h post PGF2α
  administration shows a network of 21 focus molecules with a score of 48, with top
  biological functions of cell death, cellular growth and proliferation (immune cells),
  and cell-to-cell signaling. The network is displayed graphically as nodes (genes/gene
  products) and edges (biological relationship between nodes). The node color intensity
  indicates the fold change expression of genes; with red representing up-regulation,
  and green representing down-regulation of genes between 0 vs. 3 h post PGF2α administration.
  The fold change value for individual gene is indicated under each node. The shapes
  of nodes indicate the functional class of the gene product and the lines indicate
  the type of interaction.'
