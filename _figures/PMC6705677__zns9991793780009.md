caption: Model of the non-cell-autonomous mechanism by which extracellular PPIA mediates
  motor neuron death and MM218 is protective. A, At an early phase of the disease,
  PPIA is upregulated by motor neurons and neighboring cells as a protective response
  against pathogenic pathways induced by mutant SOD1 (protein misfolding, oxidative
  stress, etc.). As the disease progresses, motor neurons especially, but also glial
  cells, secrete PPIA, which activates an inflammatory response mediated by the EMMPRIN
  receptor, leading to NF-κB activation and induction of MMP-9 and proinflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., TNFα). B, The crosstalk between motor neurons and glial cells further
  exacerbates the proinflammatory response by increasing NF-κB activation, ER stress,
  and motor neuron death. Treatment with extracellular PPIA inhibitor MM218 at the
  onset of symptoms blocks the EMMPRIN-initiated pathway upstream, leading to polarization
  of glia toward a prohealing phenotype associated with reduced NF-κB activation,
  proinflammatory markers, and ER stress. This resulted in the protection of motor
  neurons and increased survival of SOD1G93A mice.
