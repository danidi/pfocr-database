caption: EMT. (a) Morphological changes in epithelial cancer cells undergoing EMT
  under growth factors stimulation. EMT is triggered by an interplay between different
  extracellular signals. Besides TGFβ, the master regulator of EMT, other soluble
  growth factors like FGF and EGF can concur to activate EMT, which binding to their
  specific receptors and activating a cascade of intracellular mediators. (b) Schematization
  of TGFβ signaling pathways driving EMT in cancer. The TGFβ-activated receptors phosphorylate
  SMAD2/3, priming their dimerization with SMAD4, their translocation into the nucleus
  and their transcriptional activity. In addition to the SMAD-dependent pathway, TGFβ
  can directly activate both the MAPK and the PI3K-class I pathways and their respective
  signaling cascades. All these pathways converge on the regulation of a specific
  network of transcription factors (TFs). SNAIL, SLUG, ZEB1 and 2, the bHLH transcription
  factor TWIST, E-proteins (E12/E47) and their repressors Ids are among the most characterized
  TFs in the regulation of EMT. Once activated, these transcription factors mediate
  the complex changes in gene expression profile that underlines EMT. The ability
  of the cells to interact with the surrounding microenvironment has to be completely
  re-designed during EMT, which is obtained by a complete reorganization of the adhesion
  molecules profiles on the cell membrane. Epithelial adhesion molecules that mediate
  the rigid cell–cell junctions are displaced by the cell membrane (either by transcriptional
  repression or by protein degradation) and are substituted by mesenchymal surface
  proteins. This process influences cytoskeleton dynamics, leading to actin polymerization
  and the formation of stress fibers
