caption: Glycolysis inhibition by accumulation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate. Inhibition of ENO and PYK by oxamate, GAPDH inhibition by iodoacetate,
  induces accumulation of Fru1,6BP and DHAP, which behave as inhibitors of HK, HPI,
  GAPDH, and TPI at high concentrations, leading to a decrease in the L-lactate production
  (glycolysis inhibition). High levels of DHAP produce methylglyoxal that is converted
  in D-lactate by the glyoxalase system. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
