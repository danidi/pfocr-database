caption: This complex network incorporates most key biochemical reactions and pathways
  involved in cardiac metabolism including glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, fatty acids
  oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. It
  also includes species transport across cellular membrane and mitochondrial membrane,
  as well as proton influx and efflux between mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane
  space. GLU, glucose; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; GLY, glycogen; GAP, glyceraldyhe-3-phosphate;
  BPG, 1,3-bisphosphate-glycerate; PYR, pyruvate; LAC, lactate; TG, triglyceride;
  GLR, glycerol; FFA, free fatty acid; FAC, fatty acyl-CoA; PCr, phosphocreatine;
  Cr, creatine; CIT, citrate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; SCA, succinyl-CoA; SUC, succinate;
  MAL, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate; ACoA, acetyl-CoA; bADP, bound ADP; fADP, free ADP;
  ADO, adenosine.
