caption: 'ClueGO plug-in, in terms of biological process and biochemical pathway process
  annotations, revealed biological terms which were associated with the 7 hub-bottlenecks
  (see ). The statistical setting is as follows: gene per term: 2; gene percentage:
  2; grouping cut-off score ≥ 0.5; and P value ≤ 0.05. Six clusters including “positive
  regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation”, “amoebiasis”, “legionellosis”,
  “regulation of mononuclear cell migration”, “IL17 signaling pathway”, and “IL10
  signaling” were identified. The determined biological terms can be considered as
  a tool to screen the related genes. The action roles of the 7 central nodes are
  illustrated in . Except for CXCLs, activation is the prominent action between the
  other genes. Associated cellular components for the 7 central genes are shown in
  . As it is depicted in , the critical genes are related to the extracellular, plasma
  membrane, and intracellular components. TNF and IL6 are linked to all components
  while IL10 and CXCL2 are related to the extracellular component.'
