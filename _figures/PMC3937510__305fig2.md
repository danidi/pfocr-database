caption: Canonical Wnt signaling (). In cells devoid of a Wnt signal, free cytoplasmic
  β-catenin is actively targeted for degradation. This is accomplished by two scaffolding
  proteins (Apc and Axin) that bind β-catenin. They reside in the so-called destruction
  complex. Two kinases (CkI and Gsk3β) present in the same destruction complex sequentially
  phosphorylate a set of highly conserved Ser and Thr residues of β-catenin. Phospho-modified
  β-catenin becomes a substrate of the ubiquitin E3 ligase β-Trcp and is subsequently
  degraded in proteasomes. In the absence of Wnt signaling, Groucho proteins determine
  the nuclear DNA-binding proteins of the Tcf/Lef family to act as transcriptional
  repressors of Wnt target genes. Secreted Wnt proteins (19 family members) can induce
  signaling by interacting with Wnt receptor complexes consisting of a member of the
  Frizzled family (10 members) and the low-density lipid receptor family members Lrp5
  or Lrp6. Wnt binding inactivates the destruction complex. As a direct consequence,
  β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and nucleus and binds to members of the Tcf/Lef
  family, converting these into transcriptional activators. The Wnt signaling pathway
  is regulated extensively at the receptor–ligand level (). Secreted Frizzled-related
  proteins (Sfrp and Frzb) and Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF) can bind Wnt directly to
  prevent activation of receptors. Other Wnt antagonists, DKK1 and Wise, inhibit by
  binding to the LRP coreceptor. Recently discovered additional stem cell-specific
  regulators of canonical Wnt signaling (including Lgr4–6; the R-spondins; Rnf43;
  and its paralog, Znrf3) are the subject of this review.
