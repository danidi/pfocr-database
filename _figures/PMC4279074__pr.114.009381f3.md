caption: ROCK activation of MTRF-SRF–directed profibrotic gene expression. ROCK activation
  has been shown to induce profibrotic gene expression through its ability to drive
  actin polymerization, which induces the nuclear translocation of G-actin–binding
  transcriptional coactivators, such as MRTF-A and MRTF-B. In this pathway, activation
  of G protein–coupled receptors, such as LPA1, or matrix stiffening, induces ROCK
  activation, which, in turn, drives G-actin polymerization into F-actin. G-Actin
  binds MRTF-A and MRTF-B and sequesters them in the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization
  into F-actin liberates G-actin–bound MRTF-A and MRTF-B, allowing their translocation
  to the nucleus where they transactivate SRF-dependent transcription of important
  profibrotic genes containing serum response elements (SREs) in their promoters,
  such as CTGF.
