caption: 'Pathways involved in diabetes-induced EPCs toxicity and possible strategies
  to reverse EPCs damage during bone marrow mobilization. EPCs recruited from bone
  marrow are here represented. Hyperglycemia alters CXCR-4/SDF-1α pathway, reduces
  VEGF levels, increases eNOS-mediated production of ROS and a reduction in cleaving
  enzymes activity. ACE inhibitors and GM-CSF administration improve bone marrow ability
  to shed EPCs in the periphery. Diabetes-specific metabolic alterations are in red,
  linked by red arrows to the pathways they interfere with. Red vertical arrows, next
  to intracellular or extracellular molecules, indicate that their concentration is
  diminished or increased in diabetic condition compared to nondiabetic status. Drugs
  with beneficial effect on EPCs are in green, linked by green arrows to the pathways
  they interact with. MMP-9: matrix metalloproteinase-9; GLO-1: glyoxalase-1; ROS:
  reactive oxygen species; NO: nitric oxide; eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase;
  HIF1-α: hypoxia inducible factor 1-α; SDF-1α: stem cell-derived factor-1α; CXCR-4:
  C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; Kit-L:
  c-Kit ligand.'
