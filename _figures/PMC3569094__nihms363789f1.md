caption: 'Novel therapeutic approaches for overcoming limitations in the gemcitabine
  pathway. Gemcitabine enters the cell via nucleoside transporters (i.e., CNT1, CNT3,
  ENT1, ENT2). The drug is either phosphorylated into its active form (i.e., dFdC-phosphate)
  by dCK or deaminated into dFdU by CDA and eliminated from the cell. Activated gemcitabine
  can then terminate the cell by directly targeting DNA or inhibiting RRM1 and RRM2
  to deplete the dNTP pool necessary for DNA replication. Descriptions in boxes (red)
  indicate known methods for targeting a particular determinant (green) of gemcitabine
  chemosensitivity in pancreatic cancer. Abbreviations: CNT, concentrative nucleoside
  transporter; ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; dCK, deoxycytidine kinase;
  CDA, cytidine deaminase; RR, ribonucleotide reductase; dFdC, 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine;
  dFdU, 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyuridine; CDP, cytidine diphosphate; dCDP, deoxycytidine
  diphosphate; dCTP, deoxycytidine triphosphate.'
