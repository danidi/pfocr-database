caption: The Vascular Origin of Epilepsy. (A) Schema depicting the Vgat fl/fl or control
  embryonic telencephalon at day 15 that has normal periventricular vascular network
  (red lattice pattern) and a normal endothelial GABA signaling pathway that promotes
  long distance tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons (green) from the ventral
  telencephalon. A single vessel has been magnified to illustrate the positive feedback
  GABA signaling pathway that exists in normal telencephalic endothelial cells (red).
  Endothelial GABA activates GABAA receptors, thereby triggering Ca2+ influx and endothelial
  cell proliferation. Vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) is the primary mechanism for
  GABA release from telencephalic endothelial cells at embryonic day 15 (). Endothelial
  GABA release thus has autocrine roles in stimulating angiogenesis (↑) and paracrine
  roles in promoting long distance GABAergic neuronal migration in the embryonic telencephalon.
  (B) Schema depicting altered vascular profiles in Vgat ECKO telencephalon (red dotted
  pattern) in which there is complete loss of endothelial GABA secretion that causes
  GABAergic interneurons to stall in the ventral telencephalon. This has significant
  consequences for GABAergic neuronal tangential migration, resulting in neuronal
  reductions and abnormal cortical distribution in Vgat ECKO telencephalon. Magnification
  of a single vessel to depict abnormal Vgat ECKO endothelial cells (blue) and how
  lack of GABA release from these endothelial cells affects the positive feedback
  of GABA-GABAA receptor signaling, which in turn significantly affects angiogenesis-related
  gene expression (↓). Lack of endothelial GABA release also affects paracrine signaling
  and impairs long-distance migration of GABAergic interneurons.
