caption: 'Example yeast network. One flux distribution for the central metabolic and
  amino acid biosynthesis pathways of yeast. Metabolite abbreviations, reaction details,
  and the symbolic flux relations used to calculate this steady state are provided
  in additional file : yeast_example.pdf. The values of the independent flux variables
  substituted into the flux relations are set in italic font. The mitochondrial compartment
  is separated with a purple boarder and all inter-compartmental transport reactions
  are given as orange arrows. Amino acid synthesis reactions are green, and all transport
  fluxes out of the system are depicted with green cartoon bubbles. The pentose phosphate
  pathway reactions are given in red and the urea cycle is shown in brown. Dots are
  placed next to reactions that are coupled; pink dots indicate the transformation
  of glutamate to oxoglutarate, and the blue dot shows the transformation of glutamine
  to glutamate. Species that occur in more than one place within one compartment are
  circled with a dotted blue line.'
