caption: Schematic illustration of important metabolic pathways in associations of
  nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and host plant. The cell on the left represents a
  vegetative cell, while the cell on the right represents a nitrogen-fixing heterocyst.
  Important metabolic pathways in associations of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and
  host plant are glycolysis, carbon fixation, photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen
  fixation. The nitrogen fixed in the heterocyst is incorporated via the GS-GOGAT
  pathway and used for the synthesis of amino acids, although during symbiosis, most
  nitrogen is exported to the plant as NH3. In exchange, sugars are provided by the
  host plant. GOGAT, glutamate synthase; GlnA, glutamine synthetase; HCO3−, bicarbonate;
  NH3, ammonia; N2ase, nitrogenase; OAA, oxaloacetate; 3-PGA, polyglycolic acid; PGAL,
  phosphoglyceraldehyde.
