caption: The autophagy pathway functions as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism
  by directly engulfing foreign pathogens for lysosomal mediated degradation. The
  human tumor viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi’s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus
  (KSHV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) have evolved multiple
  strategies to either subvert or enhance steps in the autophagy pathway for their
  replication and pathogenesis. A. Upon autophagy initiation, Beclin-1 forms an activating
  complex with the class III PI3 kinase Vps34 for vesicle nucleation. The gamma-herpesviruses
  counteract autophagy initiation by encoding viral Bcl-2 homologs, which strongly
  bind to Beclin-1 to function as a repressor complex of vesicle nucleation. In contrast
  to gamma-herpesviruses, the HBV protein HBx stimulates autophagy induction by binding
  to Vps34. During vesicle elongation and autophagosome formation, LC3 undergoes lipid
  conjugation via an ubiquitin-like system. KSHV vFLIP blocks autophagosome formation
  by binding to Atg3, thereby preventing LC3 processing. HCV NS5B promotes autophagosome
  formation by enhancing LC3 lipid conjugation via its interaction with Atg5. HCV
  NS4B has been shown to complex with Vps34 and Rab5, but the mechanism of how HCV
  prevents the maturation of autophagosomes into autolysosomes remains unclear. Degradation
  of viral antigens in autolysosomes can be presented onto MHC molecules, such as
  the EBV EBNA1 epitope. B. The unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which is
  commonly activated during viral replication (EBV LMP1 and HBV HBs), can indirectly
  contribute to autophagy activation. Phosphorylation of the protein kinase PERK leads
  to downstream transcription of LC3 and Beclin-1 via ATF4 translation, thereby contributing
  to autophagy induction. C. Acute oncogenic stress activates DNA damage responses
  (DDRs), ultimately triggering autophagy and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Expression
  of KSHV v-cyclin activates an oncogenic stress response and DDRs. KSHV-infected
  cells remain refractive to OIS by vFLIP-mediated subversion of autophagy.
