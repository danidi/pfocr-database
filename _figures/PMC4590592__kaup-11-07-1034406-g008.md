caption: Schematic view of the signaling pathways involved in healthy and CMML monocytes
  during CSF1-induced differentiation. Upon CSF1 binding, the CSF1R triggers the activation
  of the P2RY6-PLCB3-CAMKK2-PRKAA1-ULK1 pathway leading to induction of autophagy
  and human monocyte differentiation. In a CMML-dependent context, immature dysplastic
  granulocytes synthesize and secrete large amounts of α-defensins DEFA1 and DEFA3,
  which antagonize P2RY6 and inhibit CSF1-induced differentiation of monocytes.
