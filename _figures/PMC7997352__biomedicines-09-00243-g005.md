caption: Different micro-RNA expression profiles between EVs from EGFR-mutant cells
  and EVs from EGFR wild-type cells and associated regulatory signal pathway. (A)
  Differential miRNA expression in EVs from PC9 cells compared to those from CL1-5
  cells. (B) A miRNA regulatory signal network analysis was performed using ingenuity
  pathway analysis (IPA) software. (C) This gene network displayed the top ranked
  network found associated with the mi200. Red and green tags represent the upregulated
  and downregulated genes, respectively.
