caption: Programmed cell death (PCD) pathways include the mitochondrial (or cell-intrinsic)
  death pathway that eliminates cells during development and homeostatic turnover
  as well as in host defense [,,,]. Viral (v)Bcl2 homologs and other virus-encoded
  mitochondrial suppressors block mitochondrial PCD, establishing conditions that
  selected for a Casp8-like activity to directly trigger effector caspases, bypassing
  mitochondrial Bcl2 function. Viruses adaptation included Casp8-targeted cell death
  suppressors, some specific, like herpesvirus vFLIPs, betaherpesvirus vICA, and some
  nonspecific, like the poxvirus serpin, CrmA. RIP3-dependent necroptosis via RHIM-dependent
  interaction with RIP1, TRIF or DAI, enables the host to bypass the impact of virus-encoded
  Casp8 inhibitors. The examples of MCMV vIRA and HSV1/HSV2 R1 RHIM signaling competitors
  are the first examples of viral suppressors of necroptosis [,,,]. Note that HSV1
  ICP6 inhibits necroptosis in human cells but promotes necroptosis in mouse cells
  [,]. This depiction is adapted from [].
