caption: Subnetworks (A–D) are examples of interesting conserved subnetworks discovered
  by the cross-species network search algorithm on differentially expressed genes
  between stem cells and differentiated cells. Each subnetwork represents a subgraph
  of mouse (left column) and human (right column) functional linkage networks, respectively.
  Nodes are genes and they are colored green if the gene is up-regulated in stem cells
  when compared to differentiated cells and red if down-regulated in stem cells relative
  to differentiated cells. The intensity of green or red color of the genes represents
  the normalized fold change of the expression. The edge thickness in the subnetworks
  represents the edge confidence based on the functional linkage networks. The subnetwork
  (A) shows a conserved subnetwork which contains important stem cell transcription
  factors. The subnetwork (B) highlights cell cycle related pathway genes. The subnetworks
  (C, D) are mixed subnetworks, as they contain both up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes. The genes are functionally related but their mode of function is antagonistic
  in nature.
