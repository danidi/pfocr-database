caption: 'Primary hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) intracellular distribution and key
  points of action in (A) Normoxia and (B) Hypoxia. Green arrows and text represent
  pathways of degradation of HIF. Red arrows and text represent effect of HIF-PHI,
  while blue arrows and text represent effect of hypoxia. T-bar represents inhibition
  of a pathway. Expression: HIF-1α: ubiquitous tissue expression; HIF-2α: brain, heart,
  lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, and intestine; HIF-3α: heart, lung, and kidney. Specificity:
  PHD2 and FIH, HIF-1α; PHD1 and PHD3, HIF-2α. * Effect of HIF-PHI on FIH unclear.
  Dotted lines represent translocation to nucleus. † PHD2 and PHD3 upregulated by
  hypoxia as part of a counter-regulatory mechanism. ‡ In certain situations, HIF-1α
  controls the early response to hypoxia. FIH: factor inhibiting HIF; HIF-PHI: hypoxia
  inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor; nd: not detectable; PHD: prolyl-hydroxylase
  domain.'
