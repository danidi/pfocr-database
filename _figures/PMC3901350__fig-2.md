caption: miRNAs in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway. ROS are constantly
  produced as superoxides, originating as by-products of cellular metabolism, or by
  oxygenases from specific signaling pathways. On oxidative stress, the nulcear factor-erythroid
  2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response is activated to maintain
  intracellular redox homeostasis and limit oxidative damage. miR-200a and miR-141
  form the Nrf2 positive feedback loop by targeting Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (Keap1), a negative regulator of Nrf2. Other miRNAs target the central regulators
  Nrf2, transforming growth factor (TNF)-α, and the ROS scavengers superoxide dismutatese
  (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSHPX), and thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD).
