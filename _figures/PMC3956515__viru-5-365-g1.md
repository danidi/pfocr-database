caption: Figure 1. Signaling pathways involved in the ER stress response in C. glabrata.
  The classic UPR pathway mediated by Ire1-Hac1 signaling (dotted lines) is not conserved
  in C. glabrata. In response to ER stress, Ire1 induces RIDD to degrade ER-localized
  mRNAs in an Ire1 nuclease-dependent fashion, whereas calcineurin regulates both
  Crz1-dependent and Crz1-independent pathways. In addition, Slt2 is required for
  the ER stress response independently of its downstream transcription factors Rlm1
  and SBF (Swi4/Swi6). Ire1, calcineurin, and Slt2 have also been implicated indirectly
  in antifungal resistance and virulence in C. glabrata. HAC1u, uninduced form of
  HAC1; HAC1i, induced form of HAC1; SBF, Swi4/Swi6 cell cycle box-binding factor;
  UPR, unfolded protein response; RIDD, regulated Ire1-dependent decay; CCS, calcium
  cell survival; ERSU, ER stress surveillance.
