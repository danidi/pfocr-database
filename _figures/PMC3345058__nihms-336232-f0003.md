caption: Connection between editing and modification. Following import into the mitochondria
  of kinetoplasts (T. brucei and Leishmania), tRNAs are edited and thiolated. In T.
  brucei thiolation at the unusual position 33 serves as a negative determinant for
  editing. In marsupials editing creates the recognition motif for the enzyme guanosine
  transglycosylase (GTG) required for the biosynthesis of the nucleotide queosine
  (Q). Mtu1, Nfs and Isd11 refer to factors of the FeS-cluster biosynthetic pathway
  that also required for thiolation.
