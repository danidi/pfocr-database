caption: TGFβ and BMP signaling stimulates the production of pre-miR-21 by promoting
  the Drosha-mediated processing by controlling nuclear localization of R-Smad proteins.
  Thus, Smads regulate gene expression in two distinct manners; (i) transcriptional
  regulation by DNA binding and (ii) regulation of miRNA maturation by associating
  with the Drosha/DGCR8 complex.
