caption: 'A diagram to show the organization of a hypothesized lipogenic metabolon.
  The flux of carbon from the mitochondrion, via citrate efflux and acetyl-CoA formation
  in the cytosol, then into fatty acids and finally into long chain PUFAs (LCPUFA)
  occurring in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, is shown by the continuous
  lines. The system uses pyruvate (from glycolysis) as the provider of intramitochondrial
  acetyl-CoA and for citric acid production as is shown in Fig. 1 but which is not
  repeated here for clarity. OAA: oxaloacetate; AC-CoA: acetyl-CoA; Mal-CoA: malonyl-CoA;
  FAS: fatty acid synthase; ACL: ATP: citrate lyase; ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  CMT: citrate/malate translocase; ME: malic enzyme; PC: pyruvate carboxylase; MDH:
  malate dehydrogenase. For sake of clarity, and in the absence of being able to depict
  the model in 3 dimensions, it should be noted that, although MDH is depicted in
  two locations, it is in fact the same protein. The ‘yellow’ enzymes form the citrate/malate
  cycle while the ‘purple’ enzymes represent the cytosolic “transhydrogenase cycle”.'
