caption: Schematic of layered dynamic regulation in the glucaric acid pathway. The
  initial branch point at glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is controlled using a quorum sensing
  system, where pfkA placed under control of the PesaS promoter is responsive to the
  AHL (produced by EsaI) concentration, corresponding to the cell density. Pfk-1 activity
  is knocked down at sufficiently high cell densities. Different levels of esaI expression,
  achieved by varying the strength of constitutive promoter Pcon, alters the timing
  of pfkA knockdown. Miox is controlled via a hybrid promoter () regulated by the
  MI-specific sensor IpsA.
