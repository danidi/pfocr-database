caption: HCA2 plays a critical role in the suppression of colonic cancer. (A) Expression
  of HCA2 is silenced in colon cancer cells. This tumor-associated silencing of HCA2
  involves DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation. (B) IFN-γ reverses DNA methylation-mediated
  HCA2 silencing without altering the methylation status of the HCA2 promoter. STAT1
  is rapidly activated by IFN-γ and binds to the p300 promoter to activate p300 transcription,
  resulting in a permissive chromatin conformation at the HCA2 promoter to allow HCA2
  transcription in colon carcinoma cells. Reexpression of HCA2 in cancer cell lines
  induces apoptosis by inhibiting of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cyclin D1, and NF-κB activity
  and upregulating the death receptor pathway in a ligand-dependent manner. (C) In
  mouse models of inflammation-associated colon cancer caused by AOM and DSS, the
  intestinal epithelium of HCA2−/− mice display upregulated expression of colon cancer-promoting
  genes and decreased genes that inhibit colitis and colon carcinogenesis. HCA2−/−
  mice also exhibit a severe impairment of IL-10 and IL-18 production, which leads
  to a decrease in Treg cell number.
