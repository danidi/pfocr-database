caption: 'A, Predicted network when entering CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCL6 genes from List
  I into the GeneMANIA and Cytoscape plugin allowing physical, signaling pathway and
  co-expression interactions. Node shape is hexagonal for the three query genes and
  circular for the rest of the predicted nodes of the network, whereas node color
  is proportional to its average fold change (FC) after co-culture with the MM.1S
  cell line (brighter red: higher FC after co-culture with respect to monoculture;
  white: absent in List I). Size of the nodes is indicative of its significance in
  the predicted network as determined by type and number of interactions. Physical
  interactions are depicted in blue, signaling pathway interactions in green and co-expression
  interactions in light gray; the strength of these interactions being indicated by
  line width. B, Schematic representation of Wnt canonical and non-canonical signaling,
  modified from www.Wikipathways.org. Upregulated genes on Lists I and II are shown
  in red, whereas downregulated genes on Lists I and II are coloured in green.'
