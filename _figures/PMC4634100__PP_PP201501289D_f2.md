caption: Relative pool sizes of metabolites from the photorespiratory C2 cycle in
  the ∆4 mutant, the -regulatory ΔndhR mutant, and the carboxysomeless ΔccmM mutant
  compared with the respective Synechocystis 6803 wild-type controls. Each bar represents
  the response ratio (i.e. the relative pool size of the mutant metabolite pool compared
  with the respective wild-type controls that were sampled under identical conditions,
  namely 24 h of  conditions, 3 h of  conditions, and 24 h of  conditions). Error
  bars indicate se. Data for the ∆ccmM mutant () and ∆ndhR mutant () were taken from
  previous studies. Glyoxylate was not detectable in all experiments. The position
  of the highlighted C2 cycle metabolites within central carbon metabolism is shown
  by the inserted pathway scheme. Significant changes in the mutant compared with
  the wild type are indicated by asterisks (P < 0.05). For complete underlying statistical
  assessments of the ∆4 mutant and the full set of profiled metabolites, see Supplemental
  Table S1. TCA, Tricarboxylic acid.

  description: Relative pool sizes of metabolites from the photorespiratory C2 cycle
    in the ∆4 mutant, the -regulatory ΔndhR mutant, and the carboxysomeless ΔccmM
    mutant compared with the respective Synechocystis 6803 wild-type controls. Each
    bar represents the response ratio (i.e. the relative pool size of the mutant metabolite
    pool compared with the respective wild-type controls that were sampled under identical
    conditions, namely 24 h of  conditions, 3 h of  conditions, and 24 h of  conditions).
    Error bars indicate se. Data for the ∆ccmM mutant () and ∆ndhR mutant () were

    The position of the highlighted C2 cycle metabolites within central carbon metabolism
