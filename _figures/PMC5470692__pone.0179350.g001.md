caption: Fig 1A. Role of RAS in fibrosis. AngII is a biologically active component
  of the RAS which is able to induce several pro-fibrotic actions upon activation
  of AT1. AngII has been shown to enhance keratinocyte and fibroblast migration and
  fibroblast proliferation. Furthermore, downstream signaling of the AT1 leads to
  increased production of TGF-β1 and extracellular matrix (ECM) components and seems
  to play a role in transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. In addition,
  AT1 activation induces inflammation by upregulation of several inflammatory cytokines,
  chemokines and growth factors [–]. Fig 1B. Pleitropic effects of statins. Besides
  their role in reducing cholesterol levels Statins have been shown to exert several
  pleiotropic effects. The different actions of statins are mediated by different
  routes in which the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the Rho/ROCK
  pathway play an important role. Statins were shown to reduce the AngII receptor
  AT1 (fig 1A), modulate the immune reaction and reduce the inflammation. In addition
  they reduce oxidative stress and improve endothelial cell function [, , , ]. ACE,
