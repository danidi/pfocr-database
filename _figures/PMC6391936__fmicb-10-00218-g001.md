caption: '(A) Biosynthesis of taxa-4,11-diene via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate
  (MEP) pathway in Bacillus subtilis. Intermediates in the metabolic pathway: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate (DXP), 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP), 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  (CDP-ME), 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-MEP),
  2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEC), (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl
  diphosphate (HMBPP), isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP),
  geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP). Enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase
  (Dxs), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, or 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4-phosphate synthase (Dxr, IspC), 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase
  (IspD), 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (IspE), 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF), (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate
  synthase (IspG), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (IspH), isopentenyldiphosphate
  delta-isomerase (Idi), IspA which act as geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) and
  farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS),
  and taxadiene synthase (TXS). (B) Plasmid constructs used for engineering B. subtilis.
  pDR_txs contains txs gene (red), preceded with B. subtilis mntA ribosomal binding
  site (dark red), to be inserted into the genome of B. subtilis between the amyE
  front flanking region and amyE back flanking region (purple), IPTG inducible hyperspank
  promoter (pink), and ampicillin and spectinomycin resistance cassettes (green).
  pBS0E_crtE contains crtE gene (yellow) encoding for GGPPS and preceded with B. subtilis
  mntA ribosomal binding site (dark red), xylose inducible promoter (orange), and
  ampicillin and erythromycin resistance cassettes (green). p04_SDFHCEGA contains
  seven genes of the MEP pathway, dxs, ispD, ispF, ispH, ispC, ispE, and ispG, along
  with the gene ispA (blue), each preceded with B. subtilis mntA ribosomal binding
  site (dark red), in a synthetic operon controlled by xylose inducible promoter (orange)
  and ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance cassettes (green).'
