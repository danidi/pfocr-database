caption: ARF impinges both on developmental processes (male germ cell development
  and ocular development in mice) and tumor angiogenesis. ARF is essential for normal
  spermatogenesis in mice possibly through interacting with the meiotic repair machinery.
  In the ocular development of the mouse, ARF is required for the involution of the
  hyaloid vascular system (HVS); a transient network of vessels that provides nutrients
  to the developing oculus. This is accomplished via a pathway in which ARF blocks
  platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-dependent signaling which in
  turn, is necessary for the investment of vessels by mural cells and their maintenance.
  This may also be possibly regulated via the ARF-dependent inhibition of internal
  ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation of PDGFRβ. ARF can also suppress
  the IRES-mediated translation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), thereby
  inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Unpublished data indicate that the stabilization
  of endogenous ARF upon inhibition of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase
  activity can also result in a decrease in VEGF levels; although it is not known
  whether the underlying mechanism involves the suppression of IRES-mediated translation
  of VEGF or an IRES-independent route. It may even involve a route that is not associated
  with the control of VEGF at the translational level. (The ATM/ARF/VEGF pathway is
  shown by lines.) ATM kinase itself, independently of ARF, has also been incriminated
  in pathological angiogenesis in adult mouse oculus and cancer (), but these effects
  are not depicted here for reasons of clarity. (HA, hyaloid artery.)
