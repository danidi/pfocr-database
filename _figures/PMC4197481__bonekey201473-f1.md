caption: Angiogenic–osteogenic coupling mediated by bidirectional cross talk between
  chondro-/osteoblast lineage cells and skeletal endothelial cells. Schematic view
  of the dynamic and reciprocal interplay between the different cell types in the
  bone environment that couples angiogenesis and osteogenesis. (Right and upper part)
  Previous work implicated the VHL–HIF–VEGF signaling pathway in the osteogenic compartment
  of the long bones as a key driver of angiogenic–osteogenic coupling by effecting
  both (i) cell autonomous roles in chondrocytes, osteoprogenitors and osteoblasts
  and (ii) VEGF-mediated paracrine effects on the blood vessels in the bone environment,
  stimulating angiogenesis (brown arrows and notifications). (Left and lower part)
  New work from the group of Ralf Adams (red in the scheme) identifies a specialized
  subtype of endothelial cells (ECs), constituting type H vessels in the metaphysis
  and endosteum. These ECs mediate the growth of the blood vessels in bone, through
  a tissue-selective mechanism of angiogenesis involving positive regulation by the
  VHL/HIF and Notch/Dll4 signaling pathways. Coupling of angiogenesis back to osteogenesis
  is mediated by osteo-regulatory signals produced by ECs (angiocrine, osteogenic
  signaling). Among the angiocrine signals released from H-type vessels, Noggin stood
  out as the candidate most influential in mediating the osteogenic effects; addition
  of recombinant Noggin rescued the abundance of perivascular osteoprogenitors, the
  growth plate abnormalities and the ossification defect in mice carrying EC-specific
  loss-of-function mutations in the Notch pathway.
