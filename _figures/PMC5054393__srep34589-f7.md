caption: '(A) The JAK/STAT pathway. The JAK/STAT pathway shows a common trend in expression
  levels: STAT1, STAT2 and JAK2 were up-regulated (↑) between 3 and 7 h p.i. and then
  down-regulated (↓) between 7 and 23 h p.i. in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells. The cytokine
  receptor IFNGR2 is not regulated between 3 and 7 h (=) and shows a 2X up-regulation
  between 7 and 23 h (2↑) (Figure ES6.22). (B) The PPP1R15A pathway. Growth arrest
  and DNA damage 34 (GADD34, officially known as PPP1R15A) can be rapidly induced
  by several types of cellular stress. In R06E-J cells, PPP1R15A was slightly up-regulated
  (2X) due to EBOV infection after 23 h; in HuH7 cells, we observed a strong up-regulation
  (45X) in EBOV-infected cells and no up-regulation in MARV-infected cells. (C) The
  DUSP pathway. DUSP1, 8 and 10 demonstrate the highest specificity for MAPKs (MAPK14
  and MAPK8). DUSP1 is localized in the nucleus, whereas DUSP8 and DUSP10 are also
  available in the cytosol. The nuclear DUSPs are thought to be inducible phosphatases,
  and the implications of DUSPs during viral infections have been demonstrated for
  DUSP1, which is up-regulated during Epstein-Barr virus and vaccinia virus infections.
  In response to the vaccinia virus, DUSP1 is actively involved in antiviral countermeasures
  of the host cell via the regulation of MAPK phosphorylation. Legend. Boxes indicate
  up/down-regulation from 3 to 7 h and from 7 to 23 h p.i. in EBOV-infected HuH7 cells
  (red); MARV-infected HuH7 cells (green); and EBOV-infected R06E-J cells (blue).
  For cases where the expression level changed by more than 15%, an arrow indicates
  the direction of regulation (↑/↓). When the expression level changed by more than
  100% (2-fold change in transcription), the number beside the arrow indicates the
  fold change. “=” indicates expression changes of <15%. Squares around gene names
  indicate differential expression within the HuH7 cell line (red), between EBOV-
  and MARV-infected cells (green) and between HuH7 and R06E-J cells (blue).'
