caption: Regulation of SA and JA Biosynthesis is Associated with Chloroplast. SA biosynthesis
  is predominantly accomplished by nucleus-encoded chloroplast-located isochorismate
  synthase (ICS1). In chloroplasts, ICS catalyzes the conversion of chorismate into
  isochorismate, which is further converted to SA by undetermined isochorismate pyruvate
  lyase (IPL). The MATE-transporter ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 5 (EDS5) is responsible
  for SA transportation from chloroplast into cytosol. Defense-elicited ENHANCED DISEASE
  SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4) complex works in a positive
  feedback loop to control SA synthesis, which is regulated by SA. While in a negative
  feedback loop, accumulation of ICS1-produced SA results in the deoligomerization
  of NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1), which is then translocated
  into nucleus where it suppresses the ICS1 expression (modified from Boatwright and
  Pajerowska-Mukhtar, ; Seyfferth and Tsuda, ). JA biosynthesis originates from polyunsaturated
  fatty acids released from chloroplast membranes. Firstly, α-linolenic acid (18:3)
  (α-LeA) is catalyzed by lipoxygenase (LOX) to yield the 13-hydroperoxy derivative
  13(S)-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid (13-HPOT). The dehydration of 13-HPOT by
  allene oxide synthase (AOS) results in the formation of unstable 12, 13(S)-epoxy-octadecatrienoic
  acid (12,13-EOT), which is the committed step of JA biosynthesis. Then the 12,13-EOT
  is converted to 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) by allene oxide cyclase (AOC) through
  cyclization and concludes the chloroplast-localized part of JA biosynthesis. Subsequently,
  OPDA is released from chloroplasts and taken up into peroxisomes by transporter
  COMATOSE (CTS3). The remaining steps are located in peroxisomes and JA is generated
  through reduction of the cyclopentenone by OPDA reductase 3 (OPR3) and subsequent
  three cycles of β-oxidation for side-chain shortening. The JA co-receptor complex
  of CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the negative regulator JAZMONATE ZIM DOMAIN
  (JAZ) proteins regulates the positive feedback loop of JA biosynthesis. Formation
  of JA subjects JAZ to proteasomal degradation, which allows MYC2 to activate the
  JA biosynthesis genes such as AOS, AOC, and LOX (modified from Wasternack, ; Schaller
  and Stintzi, ; Wasternack and Hause, ). NPR1 is the central transcriptional regulator
  of SA-mediated defense responses and directly regulates PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1 (PR1)
  expression (Wang et al., ). By wounding or JA treatment, COI1–JAZ co-receptor promotes
  the degradation of JAZ and release the positively acting transcription factors that
  binds to JA-responsive promoters to initiate the transcription of JA-responsive
  genes, such as PLANT DEFENSIN1.2 (PDF1.2) (Chini et al., ; Thines et al., ; Yan
  et al., ). During the antagonistic interplay between SA and JA, NPR1 suppresses
  COI1-JAZ mediated induction of JA-responsive genes via WRKY transcription factors,
  while JA also represses WRKY in COI1-dependent pathway (Li et al., ; Gao et al.,
  ). On the other hand, the JA signaling proteins, such as chloroplast factor SUPPRESSOR
  OF SA INSENSITIVITY 2 (SSI2), negatively regulate SA-mediated NPR1-dependent defense
  responses (Kunkel and Brooks, ). Further, the phytotoxin coronatine (COR), a molecular
  mimic of JA, activates NAC transcription factors via COI1-JAZ and MYC2, which eventually
  inhibits SA accumulation through repressing ICS1 expression (Zheng et al., ). In
  addition, the stress-induced methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) acts as a
  plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signal to increase the transcription level of ICS1
  (Xiao et al., ). Meanwhile, MEcPP increase the level of JA precursor OPDA and induce
  JA-responsive genes via a COI1-dependent manner in the presence of high SA (Lemos
  et al., ). Solid lines with arrow head represent activation or promotion, dotted
  lines with bar head to represent deactivation or inhibition.
