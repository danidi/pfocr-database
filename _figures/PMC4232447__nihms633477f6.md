caption: Schematic representation of the putative role of karilysin in TNF-α induction
  by macrophages. Karilysin is secreted by T. forsythia (1). Kly sheds the membrane
  form of TNF-α (2), thus generating the soluble and biologically active (3) form
  of the cytokine (sTNF-α). The released cytokine activates a pro-inflammatory signaling
  cascade via the autocrine pathway (4), leading to local accumulation of TNF-α and
  other cytokines (5). Figures were produced using Servier Medical Art.
