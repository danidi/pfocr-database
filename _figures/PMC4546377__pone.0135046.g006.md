caption: 'Frame numbers (instead of the enzyme number) indicate the corresponding
  genes associated with this enzyme. The pathway includes a number of different enzymes
  formed by complex biochemical reactions. Genes associated with this pathway are
  marked with different colored boxes: the red box is up-regulated genes, the green
  box is down-regulated genes, and the blue box is both up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes.'
