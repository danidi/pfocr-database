caption: Model of NADPH oxidases-mediated appressorium formation and penetration in
  M. oryzae. The host surface cues are sensed by the G-protein coupled receptor, Pth11.
  After recognition of the cues, the Gα subunit binds to GTP (guanosine triphosphate)
  and dissociates from the Gβγ dimer and the induction of downstream MAPK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase) cascades signaling occurs []. A component of the MAPK cascades signaling
  pathway, Mst12, interacts with the Zn(II)2Cys6 transcriptional regulator, Tpc1,
  to regulate the expression of the orthologue of the P22phox subunit (NOXD) of the
  NADPH oxidase complex. NoxD interacts with Nox1 and may be with Nox2 indirectly
  to control the elongation of the penetration peg. Both Nox1 and Nox2 interact with
  small GTPase, MgRac1, and may be regulated by MgRac1. In addition, the synthesis
  of ROS by the NoxR-Nox2 NADPH oxidase complex is required for the maintenance of
  the F-actin network and septin-dependent assembly of the exocyst at the appressorium
  pore to initiate plant infection.
