caption: The canonical taste transduction pathway. Caffeine, and other chemicals that
  elicit bitter taste sensations, activate T2R-type GPCRs. GPCRs have seven domains
  that span the plasma membrane. When bitter tasting chemicals bind to T2Rs, this
  elicits an intracellular signaling cascade that starts with activation of G-proteins
  (e.g., α-gustducin). Activation of Gα causes the dissociation of βγ subunits, which
  then activate the enzyme PLCβ2. PLCβ2 then cleaves PIP2 into IP3. The IP3 triggers
  release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to ITPR3s. This calcium
  release activates and opens TRPM5 leading to sodium influx and depolarization of
  the taste cell. This depolarization activates voltage-gated sodium channels (VGNC)
  boosting the depolarization triggered by TRPM5, which triggers the release of ATP
  through CALHM1 channels. The signal, transmitted by ATP release, is then conveyed
  to the brain through peripheral nerve fibers that express purinergic receptors.
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; T2R, taste 2 receptor; TRPM5, transient receptor potential
  cation channel subfamily M member 5.
