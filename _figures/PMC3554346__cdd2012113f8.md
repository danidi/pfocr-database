caption: Working model. ROC1 silencing induced p21-dependent senescence to suppress
  the growth of liver cancer cells, while it triggered autophagy as a survival signal
  by inducing accumulation of Deptor as a CRL/SCF substrate. Blockage of autophagy
  pathway via siRNA silencing of autophagy essential genes sensitized cancer cells
  to apoptosis upon ROC1 silencing
