caption: 'Mosquitoes ingest an arboviral-infected blood meal into the midgut. After
  replication in the midgut epithelial cells, the virus escapes into the hemolymph
  and subsequently spreads via the hemolymph circulation to the fat body, muscles,
  salivary glands and neural tissue. Mosquitoes have evolved systemic (A) and tissue-specific
  (B–E) antiviral mechanisms to limit viral propagation to a tolerable level. (A)
  The insect Toll and Imd pathways (left) are closely related to the mammalian Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways. The viral pattern recognition
  receptors in the Toll and Imd pathways are unknown. The Toll pathway uses viral
  pattern recognition to initiate an extracellular signaling cascade for the maturation
  of Spatzle (Spz), which is a ligand that binds the Toll receptor. The intracellular
  signaling pathway is mediated by Myd88 and results in the translocation of the NF-kB-like
  factor Rel1 to the nucleus to initiate downstream transcription. In the Imd pathway,
  there is an unknown pattern recognition receptor that binds viruses to recruit the
  adaptor molecules Imd and FADD, which results in activation of an NF-kB-like factor
  Rel2. The activated Rel2 translocates to the nucleus to induce the transcription
  of immune genes such as multiple AMPs. The functional information of the siRNA pathway
  (center) was obtained from Drosophila studies. Briefly, viral siRNAs are generated
  by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) either as viral replication intermediates or as a
  part of RNA viral genomes. Dicer-2 (Dcr2) acts as the pattern recognition receptor
  to recognize the dsRNA. R2D2 is a protein containing two dsRNA-binding domains (R2)
  and is associated with Dcr2 (D2), which is required to initiate the subsequent antiviral
  defense. The long dsRNA is processed into siRNAs that are approximately 21–23 bp
  in length. The siRNAs are then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex
  (RISC) to specifically recognize viral sequences and degrade viral mRNAs and genomes.
  The activation of the Drosophila JAK-STAT pathway (right) is initiated by the recognition
  of the extracellular unpaired ligand Upd by the transmembrane receptor Domeless
  (Dome). Dome is an ortholog of the mammalian type I cytokine receptor. The ligand-receptor
  interaction undergoes a conformational change that causes the auto-phosphorylation
  of Hop, which is a homologue of the mammalian JAK kinase. Activated Hop subsequently
  phosphorylate Dome, leading to the phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT. The
  activated STAT dimer translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription
  of specific target genes. Orthologs of the core JAK-STAT pathway components have
  been identified in mosquitoes. In addition to their systemic antiviral mechanisms,
  mosquitoes also contain the following specific antiviral responses in various tissues:
  RNAi/Toll/JAK-STAT pathways and microbiota in the midgut (B), the PO system and
  complement-like cascade in the hemolymph/hemocytes (C), and multiple antiviral effectors
  in the salivary glands (D) and neural system (E).Broken arrows represent secreted
