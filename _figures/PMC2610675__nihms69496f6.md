caption: 'Human CG binds to the LHR and activates the Gs and Gq/11, families of G
  proteins leading to an increase in cAMP, inositol phosphates (InsP) and diacylgylcerol
  (DAG) as shown. The hCG-engaged LHR also activates the Gi/o family but the functional
  consequence of this activation is not known. Cyclic AMP, acting through PKA, activates
  Ras and the ERK1/2 cascade by mechanisms that remain to be investigated (dashed
  line #1). This pathway has been previously documented by the finding that overexpression
  of a cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), a PKA inhibitor (PKI) or a dominant-negative
  Ras (DN-Ras) inhibit the hCG-induced ERK1/2 response [, , ]. In addition, PKA-selective
  analogs of cAMP activate Ras and stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation whereas cAMP analogs
  that are selective for cAMP-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factors do not
  [].The binding of hCG to the LHR also results in the formation of an LHR/arrestin-3
  complex [] and this complex is required for Fyn activation as shown herein. The
  co-culture experiments suggest that the involvement of Fyn as a mediator of ERK1/2
  phosphorylation involves activation of the proteolysis of the precursor form of
  an EGF-like growth factor (Pro-“EGF-like”) leading to the release of soluble, diffusible
  forms of this factor (EGF-like). This “EGF-like growth factor” stimulates the EGFR
  in an autocrine fashion leading to the activation of Ras by the classical pathway
  involving Shc, Grb2 and Sos. This pathway was documented by the ability of an arrestin-3
  siRNA, Dn-Fyn, an EGFR-siRNA, DNShc and DN-Ras to inhibit the hCG-induced ERK1/2
  response [this paper and refs. , , , ].Fyn could also directly phosphorylate Shc
  as shown by dashed arrow #2 and Arr3 could also more directly participate in the
  activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade by forming scaffolds as shown by dashed arrow
  # 3 (see ).'
