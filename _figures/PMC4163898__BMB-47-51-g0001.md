caption: Stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) signaling pathway. A variety of
  stimuli, such as telomere erosion, DNA damage, oncogene activation, oxidative stress,
  anticancer drugs and ionizing radiation, induce cell-cycle arrest and transcription
  of senescence-associated genes. Senescence signaling and growth arrest-response
  signaling pathways have been shown to overlap. Upon sensing senescence signals,
  the cell cycle checkpoint machinery can force the cell to exit the cell cycle via
  the CDK4 inhibitor p16 and the MDM2 inhibitor ARF. Senescence-inducing stimuli lead
  to upregulation of p21, which blocks the cyclin D/CDK4-mediated hyperphosphorylation
  of pRb, and provokes cell cycle arrest and, ultimately, cellular senescence. Alternatively,
  these events induce ARF, which blocks the activity of the p53 inhibitor MDM2 and
  thereby activates p53. One of the characteristics of senescent cells is a change
  in morphology, such as enlargement, flattening, and increased granularity. In addition,
  senescent cells or tissue exhibit increased activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase
  (SA-β-gal), a reliable biomarker of senescence.
