caption: DNA Sensing and ResponseNon-comprehensive overview of the most relevant DNA-sensing
  receptors at the relevant localization, their downstream signaling molecules, and
  the functional outcome and secondary consequences as applicable (e.g., STING sensing
  of cGAS product 2′3′cGAMP). DNA-sensing receptors are in gray, signaling molecules
  in yellow, nucleases in green, and inflammasome pathways is purple. The signaling
  competent form of TLR9 is exclusively localized to the endolysosome and preferentially
  detects ssDNA containing unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs which
  are less frequent in eukaryotic self DNA compared to bacterial DNA. TLR9 has two
  binding sites, one site binding ssDNA with an unmethylated CpG motif and the second
  site binding short ssDNA carrying a 5′ hydroxyl, both cooperatively promoting TLR9
  dimerization and signaling, including the recently identified signaling component
  TASL linking signaling to downstream IRF5. TLR9 ligands in the endolysosome are
  tightly regulated by endolysosomal DNase II, PLD3, and PLD4 which coordinately degrade
  single- and double-stranded DNA. Cytosolic DNA sensing includes the RNA sensor RIG-I
  which detects RNA transcribed from poly(dA:dT) by pol III. The cGAMP synthase (cGAS)/Stimulator
  of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway is the principle cytosolic dsDNA sensor pathway,
  activating a type-I IFN response, and via STING a NLRP3 dependent inflammasome response.
  Availability of cytosolic DNA for this pathway is regulated by DNase III (TREX1).
  Accessory proteins for cGAS are HMGB1, the GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding
  protein 1 (G3BP1), TFAM, and CCHC-type zinc-finger protein 3 (ZCCHC3) which bind,
  bend, and stabilize dsDNA in a manner amenable to the nucleation of cGAS dimers
  along the dsDNA strand. cGAS is also localized in the nucleus where it senses foreign
  but not self DNA. Here, non-POU domain-containing octamer binding protein (NONO),
  but also HMGB1 and TFAM, assist in binding of DNA to cGAS. IFI16 is a nuclear restriction
  factor, binding, and silencing viral or transfected DNA. The DNA damage protein
  RAD50 upon stimulation with dsDNA induces proIL1β via the CARD9-BCL10 pathway. In
  the human system, a STING-independent DNA sensing pathway via the DNA damage response
  protein DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) senses linear DNA, and signals via
  IRF3/IRF7 and HSPA8/HSC70. Absent in Melanoma (AIM2) is the principle cytosolic
  dsDNA sensor responsible for inflammasome activation. Several family members of
  the Apolipoprotein B editing complex (APOBEC) act as restriction factors by performing
  C-to-U editing on first(minus) strand cDNA, resulting in G-to-A mutations in the
  plus strand. The sterile alpha-motif (SAM) and histidine-aspartate (HD) domain-containing
  protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase
  removing tripolyphosphate moieties from dNTPs thereby reducing the intracellular
  dNTP concentration and inhibiting reverse transcription.
