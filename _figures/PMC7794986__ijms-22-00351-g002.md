caption: The molecular basis of chemoresistance in GBM. The major mechanisms of resistance
  of GBM to alkylating chemotherapy such as temozolomide (TMZ) revolve around DNA
  repair, cell cycle progression, and anti-apoptosis. One major resistance pathway
  involves the enzyme O6-MeG DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes TMZ-induced
  O6 methyl adducts to allow DNA replication to continue. Acquired DNA mismatch repair
  deficiency also contributes to alkylating agent resistance. As cells acquire TMZ
  resistance, downregulation of DNA methyltransferase-1 occurs, leading to epigenetic
  de-repression of oncogenes such as SNHG12 that activate MAPK signaling to lead to
  inhibition of apoptosis and G1/S transition.
