caption: Ceramides are generated through de novo synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  In the de novo synthesis pathway, serine palmitoyltransferase converts serine and
  palmitate into dihydrosphingosine. In a series of reactions dihydrosphingosine is
  converted into ceramide. Complex sphingolipids can also be degraded into ceramide.
  In the salvage pathway, sphingosine is metabolized into ceramide by ceramide synthase,
  and glucosylceramide is degraded into ceramide by glucosyl ceramidase. In the sphingomyelin
  hydrolysis pathway, plasma membrane sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed into ceramide via
  sphingomyelinase. Compounds that inhibit various enzymes in the ceramide biosynthesis
  pathway are shown in green.
