caption: Summary of the mechanistic findings presented in this paper. The ATM and
  FA pathways (white boxes/arrows) are two DNA damage response pathways that display
  synthetic lethal relationship. Inhibition of the FA pathway may therefore be used
  as a targeted therapy to selectively kill ATM-deficient tumors. Several enzymatic
  complexes have been proposed to modulate the FA pathway (light grey boxes). Monitoring
  the effect of the compounds used in this study (dark grey boxes) toward those enzymatic
  activities suggests that (i) in contrast with cell-based assays, the proteasome
  is not required for FA pathway activation in Xenopus extracts, (ii) in contrast
  with curcumin, EF24 is a weak proteasome inhibitor, (iii) EF24 does not inhibit
  the FA pathway through disruption of the core complex, and (iv) curcumin, EF24 and
  BMS-345541 might inhibit the FA pathway through inhibition of IKK.
