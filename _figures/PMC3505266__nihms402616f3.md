caption: 'Following antigen exposure and interaction with IL-4-producing CD4 helper
  T cells at the follicular border, B cells proliferate, isotype switch to IgG1 or
  IgE, and follow one of 2 fates: 1). Upregulate Blimp-1, migrate out of the follicle
  and become short-lived plasma cells; or 2). Upregulate Bcl-6, and migrate into the
  GC. IgE+ GC B cells appear to be rapidly shunted into the short-lived plasma cell
  pathway before affinity maturation can occur. In contrast, IgG1+ GC B cells undergo
  CD4+ T cell-dependent affinity-maturation and some exit the GC as long-lived plasma
  cells or memory B cells. Upon a second encounter with antigen, the GC-derived high-affinity
  IgG1+ memory cells form a rapid short-lived plasma cell response, where some of
  the cells undergo isotype switching from IgG1 to IgE.'
