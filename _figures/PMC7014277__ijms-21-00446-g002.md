caption: Involvement of protein phosphatases in the repair of a DNA lesion. Schematic
  representation showing the repair of a double-strand break (DSB) by non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Key factors involved in the
  execution of each repair pathway are shown. PP2A and PP1 stimulate NHEJ by dephosphorylating
  and activating DNA-protein kinase (PK). The dephosphorylation of MRE11–RAD50–NBS1
  (MRN), γ-H2AX, CtIP and RPA by PP2A and PP4 is required for the processing and repair
  of the DNA lesion by HR. PP4 participates in HR by facilitating DNA2 accessibility
  to the DSB vicinity, thus enhancing DNA end resection. CDC14 promotes both recombinational
  DNA repair and resolution of recombinant intermediates. Green and red represent
  active or inactive, respectively.
