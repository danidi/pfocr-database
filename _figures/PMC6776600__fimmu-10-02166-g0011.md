caption: Complement inhibitors target different levels and steps of the complement
  cascade. Complement inhibitors which are evaluated in clinical trials for various
  kidney diseases bind to different complement proteins and inhibit the cascade at
  different levels. C1 inhibitor binds to C1 and blocks C1 activation. OMS 721 binds
  to the lectin pathway protease MASP2. C3 targeting proteins include APL2 (Apellis)
  and AMY 101 (Amyndas). The Factor D inhibitor ACH-4471 (Achillion) binds to Factor
  D, a protease which cleaves in its active state Factor B. LPN023 (Novartis) a small
  Factor B binding protein blocks formation of the enzymatically active AP C3 Convertase.
  Several compounds target complement at the level of C5. Eculizumab, and the new
  version Ravulizumab (both Alexion) bind to C5 and block activation of the protein.
  Coversin is a tick derived C5 binding protein (Akari) and C5 inhibitor. C5 synthesis
  is blocked by Cemdisiran as an RNAi targeted strategy (Alnylam), and by LFG-316
  (Novartis). The complement inflammatory C5a—C5aR1 axis is inhibited by IFX-1 (InflaRx)
  and Avacopan (Chemocentryx).
