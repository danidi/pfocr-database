caption: This figure summarizes the possible effects of cellular stresses in neurons
  observed in Alzheimer's disease. In sensitive neurons to stress, it is proposed
  that mTOR and p70S6K activations as well as tau phosphorylation are reduced whereas
  in more resistant neurons, these signalling pathway are maintained.
