caption: Three major fates for acetyl CoA produced in neurons. Acetyl CoA can be used
  in neurons for lipid synthesis via the ATP citrate lyase pathway, or energy production
  via the TCA cycle. When local energy and lipid synthesis demands have been met,
  a third route of acetyl CoA utilization present in neurons is the Asp-NAT mediated
  synthesis of NAA using aspartate as co-substrate, followed by export to oligodendrocytes
  for further metabolism. Pathologies that impair neuronal energetics would be expected
  to reduce NAA production as acetyl CoA is diverted to energy production and membrane
  lipid synthesis.
