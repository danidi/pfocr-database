caption: “Pancreatic secretion”, “Protein digestion and absorption” and “Complement
  and coagulation cascades” are the 3 pathways that are highlighted exclusively due
  to their direct association with the genetic information network of IPF and are
  colored in green. The edge width is commensurate to the number of times an edge
  was traversed during the IPF PathWalks execution. The “Pancreatic secretion” and
  “Protein digestion and absorption” pathways are highlighted in IPF, Dupuytren’s
  Disease, Polycystic Kidney Disease and IgG4-related Disease. The “Pancreatic Secretion”
  pathway is also highlighted in SSc. The “Complement and coagulation cascades” pathway
  is highlighted in the use cases of IPF, CF, IgG4-related Disease, Polycystic Kidney
  Disease and Schistosomiasis.
