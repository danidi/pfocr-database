caption: 'Following its biosynthesis, PKC is in an open, and degradation-sensitive,
  conformation in which all its regulatory modules are unmasked (species i). It is
  processed by a series of ordered phosphorylations that depend on the binding of
  Hsp90, with Cdc37, to a conserved PXXP motif in the kinase domain, the kinase complex
  mTORC2, and PDK-1. Phosphorylation at three priming sites, the activation loop,
  and two sites on the C-terminal tail, the turn motif and the hydrophobic motif,
  promote PKC to adopt an autoinhibited conformation in which the Ca2+-sensing C2
  domain (yellow) clamps the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate segment (red) in the substrate-binding
  cavity of the kinase domain (cyan), and the diacyglycerol-sensing C1 domains (orange)
  become masked (species ii). Hydrolysis of PIP2 results in Ca2+-dependent recruitment
  of PKC to the plasma membrane via engagement of the C2 domain (species iii), where
  PKC binds its membrane-embedded ligand, diacylglycerol, via primarily the C1B domain
  (species iv). This active PKC phosphorylates downstream substrates, such as Ras,
  to suppress oncogenic signaling. The membrane-bound conformation of PKC is sensitive
  to dephosphorylation, with the first event being dephosphorylation of the hydrophoboic
  motif catalyzed by PHLPP; subsequent dephosphorylation by PP2A produces a fully
  dephosphorylated PKC that is shunted for degradation by a proteosomal pathway (species
  v). However, binding of Hsp70 to the dephosphorylated turn motif allows PKC to become
  rephosphorylated to sustain the signaling lifetime of the enzyme. Phorbol esters
  (not shown) bind the C1B domain with two-orders of magnitude higher affinity than
  diacylglycerol (highlighted in yellow) and are not readily metabolized, trapping
  PKC in the open, phosphatase-sensitive conformation and resulting in chronic loss,
  or down-regulation, of PKC. Novel PKC isozymes are regulated by similar mechanisms
  except their C2 domain does not function as a Ca2+ or plasma membrane sensor, resulting
  in tht localization of novel PKC isozymes primarily to the more abundant and diacylglycerol-rich
  Golgi membranes. Atypical PKC isozymes are activated upon binding to specific protein
  scaffolds that tether the pseudosubstrate out of the substrate-binding cavity. Proteins
  indicated in grey are key regulators of the steady-state levels of PKC: Hsp70, Hsp90,
  mTORC2, and PDK-1 function to increase the steady-state levels of PKC by permitting/catalyzing
  processing phosphorylations; Pin1 and the phosphatases PHLPP and PP2A function to
  decrease the steady-state levels of PKC by permitting/catalyzing the dephosphorylation
  of PKC. Targeting any of these proteins will disrupt the balance of PKC signaling.'
