caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed signalling pathway involved in
  myricitrin's inhibition of LPS-induced inflammation-associated proteins in RAW264.7
  cells. LPS activated the NOX2 (gp91phox/p47phox) pathway to enhance ROS generation,
  which in turn initiated the activation of JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1 and ultimately induced
  TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and NO production and iNOS expression in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover,
  pretreatment with myricitrin inhibited LPS-induced inflammation via gp91phox/p47phox
  inhibition.
