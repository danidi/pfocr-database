caption: 'Overview of viruses utilizing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during host
  cell entry. (a) Viruses using the pH-dependent route to enter the host cell are
  engulfed in endosomes and released inside the cell. Attachment of influenza A or
  vaccinia virus (VACV) results in a clustering of lipid rafts at the cell surface
  (here: accentuated part of the membrane), which is followed by PI3K/Akt-supported
  endocytosis. Inhibition of PI3K (LY294002 or Wortmannin) reduces the infection by
  both viruses. The endosomal entry of Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Avian leucosis virus
  (ALV), and African swine fever virus (ASFV) is also diminished after inhibition
  of this signaling pathway. In the case of Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) the signaling
  pathway is important for further trafficking into the cell as inhibition traps virus
  particles in vesicular compartments; (b) Likewise, the pH-independent entry of herpes
  simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)—carried out through fusion of the viral envelope with the
  plasma membrane—relies on PI3K activity. The receptor binding of human immunodeficiency
  virus (HIV-1) already affects several hundred intracellular phosphorylation events,
  which potentially support the viral life cycle. The respective viral receptors are
  shown in green.'
