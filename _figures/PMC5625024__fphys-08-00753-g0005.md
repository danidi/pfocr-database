caption: 'Distinct pathways enriched in diet and drug gene expression signatures found
  anti-correlated with diseases. The first two components from PCA accounted for 55.8%
  of the total variance. Colors denote two classes of administrations: diet (red)
  and drug (blue). Arrows denote representative variables (pathways) with a relative
  contribution ranked in the top 30 to either of the principal components and are
  labeled with pathway names.'
