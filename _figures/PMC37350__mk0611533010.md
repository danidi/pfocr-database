caption: Summary of trafficking and signaling of EGFR in  human mammary epithelial
  cells. Shown is a simplified diagram of the  endocytic pathway. Listed below is
  the time period during which the  EGFR traverses the different compartments after
  EGF addition as  determined by colocalization studies. The association of different  substrates
  with the EGFR is based on results from both 184A1 and HB2  cells.
