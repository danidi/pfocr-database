caption: Model of ESRP1-mediated cell cycle G1-phase arrest. ESRP1 directly binds
  to the cyclin A2 mRNA 3′UTR, which decreases the stability of the cyclin A2 mRNA
  and downregulates cyclin A2 protein levels. Furthermore, ESRP1 can upregulate the
  expression of CDC20, which leads to further downregulation of cyclin A2 expression
  via the APCCDC20-mediated ubiquitin degradation pathway in HeLa cells.
