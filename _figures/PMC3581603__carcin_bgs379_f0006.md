caption: Schematic model of BPA-induced cellular reprogramming and its reversal. We
  postulate that BPA exposure perturbs multiple regulatory hubs within target cells,
  thereby promoting the functional manifestation of well-accepted ‘hallmarks of cancer’
  and culminating in the sustained propagation of finite-life non-malignant HRBECs.
  Green arrow represents activation; red ‘T’ denotes inhibition. Our findings support
  the antagonist effects of ER and p53 on cellular programs altered by BPA (depicted
  by large circles), each of which is associated with clinical breast cancer outcome.
  For example (i) cell survival—mediated by activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  is known to result from estrogenic stimuli among others (). Activation of this pathway
  confers a poor prognosis (), as we demonstrated previously using a BPA-response
  gene signature (). (ii) Apoptosis evasion—a role for BPA in the inhibition of p53,
  and downstream effects on BAX expression is consistent with its estrogenic action.
  TP53 loss of function is a hallmark of all cancer in general. Specifically in breast
  cancer, p53 status identifies women at a high risk of disease-specific mortality
  among African-Americans () and other ethnicities. (iii) Cell cycle—analogous to
  estrogen-stimulated early G1 changes (), BPA exposure induces cyclin D, inactivates
  p21WAF1, facilitating cyclin E–Cdk2 activation and pRb inactivation in mid-to-late
  G1, allowing S phase entry to HRBECs. Overexpression of cell cycle progression genes
  is prognostic in breast cancer (). (iv) DNA replication—ERα interacts with PCNA
  to initiate DNA replication and repair (). Similarly, the MCM gene family required
  for DNA replication is frequently upregulated in various cancers, including breast
  tumors (). (v) Extended propagation potential—is often a prelude to in vitro cell
  immortalization and is a characteristic feature of tumor cells derived from aggressive
  high-grade breast cancer (). Our hypothesis predicts that BPA-induced aberrant gene
  expression alters the normal regulation of ER-responsive genes that influence pathways
  underlying tumorigenesis. As such, this model provides a molecular basis for BPA-promoted
  breast carcinogenesis and a mechanistically defined role for curcumin or curcumin-like
  agents in its prevention.
