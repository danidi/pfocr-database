caption: Sub-network of the innate signaling pathway obtained after IPA analysis of
  the differentially expressed genes in A549 lung epithelial cells infected with WM
  06.482 conidia. Significantly up-regulated genes are shown in red, the intensity
  of red color shows the level of up-regulation of the gene expressed as log2 (fold
  change). The genes that did not show any changes in expression after 8 h of incubation
  with WM 06.482 are shown in grey. The full network is presented as Supplementary
  Fig. S.
