caption: The terpenoid precursor secologanin was biosynthesized from MVA and / or
  MEP pathway through more than five steps of enzymatic oxidation. The amine precursor
  tryptamine was originated from shikimate pathway to tryptophan and followed by decarboxylation
  reaction. More than five cytochrome P450 enzymes were predicted to be involved in
  the conversion from strictosidine to CAM. The possible cytochrome P450 enzymes were
  highlighted in bold and its reduction partner CPR was in red. The other enzymes
  involved in the biosynthesis of CAM were omitted for clarity.
