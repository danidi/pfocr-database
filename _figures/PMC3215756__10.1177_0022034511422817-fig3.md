caption: Working model of the intracellular signaling pathway in the activation of
  mucous cell exocrine secretion by muscarinic cholinergic receptors. (Step 1 of Fig.)
  Salivary mucous cells express roughly equivalent amounts of muscarinic cholinergic
  M1 and M3 receptor subtypes that are coupled to the G proteins, Gq and G11 (). Binding
  of the parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine (A) to either receptor subtype
  (step 2) initiates the exchange of GTP for GDP binding to the α-subunits of Gq and
  G11 (step 3), resulting in dissociation of the G proteins (step 4) and the subsequent
  interaction of GTP-bound α-subunits to phosphatidylinositol 1,4,bisphosphate (PIP2)-specific
  phospholipase C (PLC) () (step 5). The subsequent activation of PLC generates inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) () and diacylglycerol (DAG) () (step 6). Interaction of
  IP3 with its cognate receptors (step 7) results in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular
  stores (step 8), associated presumably with the endoplasmic reticulum (). The initial
  transient release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores promotes the release of a fusion-competent
  pool of secretory granules at the apical membrane (step 9) and further induces the
  influx of extracellular Ca2+ through a store-operated Ca2+ entry mechanism (step
  10), resulting in a sustained increase in intracellular free Ca2+ (). DAG in concert
  with the sustained increase in cell Ca2+ activates cPKC isoforms in a synergistic
  manner (step 11), possibly through DAG lowering the Ca2+ requirement of cPKCs ().
  One or more cPKC isoforms may be responsible for activating mechanisms (e.g., granule
  docking and priming) required for the latent (post-5 min in time-course experiments)
  and sustained release of the pool of secretory granules that are initially fusion-incompetent
  at the time of M1/M3 receptor activation (step 12). PKC-α is an attractive candidate
  in mediating one or more of the cPKC-dependent mechanisms regulating secretion,
  as indicated by its rapid and persistent activation upon muscarinic stimulation
  and continual accumulation in apical membrane regions.
