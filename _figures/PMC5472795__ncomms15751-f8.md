caption: The DSBs in S/G2 cells can be processed by two competing factors, the Ku
  heterodimers and the MRN complex. (a) When a DSB is bound by Ku heterodimers, the
  break is then destined for NHEJ. (b) On the other hand, when a site is bound by
  MRN complex, the ends are resected and ssDNA generated, leading to the activation
  of ATR, Chk1 and APCCdh1, and eventually the destruction of USP1 and the recruitment
  of BRCA1. BRCA1 then expels RIF1 and reinforces the end resection, leading to further
  activation of ATR, Chk1 and APC.
