caption: Figure 1. Schematic of the spindle assembly checkpoint pathway. The spindle
  assembly checkpoint (SAC) controls cell cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis.
  The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) promotes anaphase onset by targeting
  cyclin B and securin for degradation by the proteasome. If chromosomes are not attached
  to microtubules, then the SAC inhibits the APC/C and the cell delays anaphase onset
  to provide more time for proper attachment of kinetochores to microtubules.
