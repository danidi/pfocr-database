caption: The SPPS-based strategy for GBAP synthesis. A) Pathway starting from Asn5;
  B) Pathway starting from Gln9. In both pathways, the initial amino acid is attached
  by its side chain to Knorr resin. The peptide is extended to the N-terminus. The
  acid-labile trityl protecting group is removed and the lactone linkage is made with
  Ser3 before the remaining amino acids are added. Finally, alloc is removed from
  the C-terminus, and the peptide is cyclized on the resin before final cleavage.
