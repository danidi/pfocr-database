caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanism of action of nimbolide in diethylnitrosamine
  and N-nitrosomorpholine induced hepatocellular carcinoma mice. Nimbolide treatment
  inhibits tumor growth in diethylnitrosamine and N-nitrosomorpholine induced Hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) mice by targeting tight junctions (TJs) proteins [Zonula occludens-1
  (ZO-1) and Occludin]. Nimbolide mediated up-regulation of ZO-1 represses the transcriptional
  activity of ZO-1 associated nucleic acid binding protein at a junctional site preventing
  its nuclear accumulation and thus preventing the induction of cell cycle related
  genes cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclinD1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.
  Nimbolide treatment also restores barrier integrity by up-regulation TJs proteins
  which prevent translocation of growth factors and nutrients necessary for cell growth
  from apical to the basolateral domain. Further, nimbolide also targets the nuclear
  factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells pathway ameliorating
  inflammation in HCC mice. ZO-1: Zonula occludens 1; ZONAB: ZO-1 associated nucleic
