caption: Reduction of hydrogen peroxide mediated by thioredoxin (A) and glutathione
  (B) pathways. Electrons are delivered by NADPH maintained reduced by the pentose
  phosphate pathway in the cytosol, and by the respiratory substrates in mitochondria.
  The proton-translocating transhydrogenase transfers electrons from NADH to NADP+
  to form NADPH. Sulfenic and selenenic acid residues appear as key intermediates
  in the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways, respectively.
