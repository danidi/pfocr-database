caption: 'Carbon metabolism of mammalian cells in quiescent and activated states.
  In the quiescent state (thin blue arrows) a low amount of glucose, the major carbon
  source under these conditions, is taken up and oxidized mainly via the glycolytic
  pathway (1) and to a lesser extent by the (2). Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis
  is transported to the mitochondria where it is further oxidized to CO2 through the
  TCA (3). NADH, NADPH, and FADH2, generated in (1), (2), and (3), respectively enter
  the electron transfer chain (ETC) where these electron donors are re-generated to
  NAD, NADP, and FAD thereby producing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (5).
  ATP is also produced in the glycolytic pathway (1) by substrate phosphorylation.
  The anabolic pathways biosynthesizing the non-essential amino acids Ala, Ser, Asp,
  Asn, Glu, Gln, Pro as well as FAs, lipids, sterols, and nucleotides (green letters)
  are shut off or are running at a low level. In the activated state (red arrows),
  induced e.g., by growth factors, cytokines, activation of oncogenes, inactivation
  of tumor suppressors (see text for details), (1) and (2) are frequently highly induced,
  whereas (3) and (5) are now running at reduced levels. This metabolic condition
  is termed aerobic glycolysis or “Warburg effect.” In this state, pyruvate is converted
  to lactate thereby regenerating NAD which is needed for continuous glucose oxidation.
  Glutamine (Gln) and FAs may serve as alternative or additional carbon substrate(s)
  under these conditions. Gln is converted through glutaminolysis (4) to α-KG and
  FAs through ß-oxidation (6) to acetyl-CoA. Both metabolites can replenish the TCA.
  Under these conditions anabolic pathways are also activated as metabolites serving
  as precursors for the biosynthesis of amino acids, FAs/lipids/sterols, and nucleotides
  are produced in excess. (1): Glycolysis; (2): Pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP); (3):
