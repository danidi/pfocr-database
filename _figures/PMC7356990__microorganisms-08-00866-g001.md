caption: Schematic representation of N-methylanthranilate (NMA) biosynthesis (A) embedded
  into aromatic amino acid metabolism of engineered C. glutamicum (B). Continuous
  arrows indicate single reactions, dashed arrows indicate multiple reactions. Green
  arrows and gene names indicate genome-based overexpression, yellow arrows and gene
  names indicate vector-based expression, crossed arrows and red gene names indicate
  gene deletion. (A) N-methylation of anthranilate by N-methylanthranilate transferase
