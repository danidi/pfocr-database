caption: 'Epithelial SC compartments in the mammalian intestine and the skin and Wnt
  signaling in SCs. A: The intestinal crypt-villus unit. Intestinal epithelial SCs
  are thought to reside at the base of the crypt, either in the +4 position counting
  from the bottom of the crypt (brown) directly above the Paneth cells (gray), or
  as CBC cells (red) located between the Paneth cells. Recent evidence demonstrates
  that Lgr5 marks these rapidly cycling CBC cells, which can both self-renew and give
  rise to TA progenitor cells (yellow). The intestinal TA cells differentiate into
  four lineages—long-lived Paneth cells (gray) that occupy the base of the crypt and
  the enteroendocrine cells (blue), goblet cells (purple). and enterocytes (green)
  that move upwards and cover the villus. B: The skin. Three distinct niches for multipotent
  epidermal SCs exist—the bulge region of the HF, the base of the SG, and the basal
  layer of the IFE. SCs of these niches (red) are essential for the self-renewal of
  their pertinent tissue during normal homeostasis. The IFE SCs give rise to rapidly
  cycling keratinocytes that differentiate while moving upward to form the spinous
  layer, granular layer, and stratum corneum. Sebocyte SCs reside near the base of
  the SG. They give rise to proliferative progeny that differentiates into lipid-filled
  sebocytes. SCs of the HF are located within the bulge area. After the first and
  all subsequent hair cycles, bulge cells generate cells of the outer root sheath
  (ORS), which is thought to contain SCs that continue to migrate down to the follicle
  base and fuel the proliferative compartment of TA cells located at the base of the
  hair (matrix cells, blue) and adjacent to the dermal papilla (DP, purple). Matrix
  cells differentiate to form the various layers of the inner root sheath (IRS) and
  the hair shaft (HS). Lgr5+ve rapidly cycling cells reside in the bulge and the ORS
  of the growing HF and give rise to all of the newly formed cells of HF. C: Canonical
  Wnt signaling in SCs. SCs in the intestine and the skin are regulated by Wnt signaling.
  Wnt ligands bind to the Frizzled/LRP co-receptor complex and activate the canonical
  signaling pathway. Axin is recruited to the plasma membrane resulting in the inactivation
  of the APC destruction complex and subsequent stabilization of β-catenin. β-catenin
  translocates to the nucleus, where it binds Tcf transcription factors, thus activating
  the Wnt target gene Lgr5. Lgr5 encodes a seven-transmembrane protein with a large
  extracellular domain for ligand binding and a short cytoplasmic tail for coupling
  to G proteins.'
