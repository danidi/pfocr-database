caption: Defective membrane repair and muscle inflammation. Plasma membrane damage
  to dysferlin-deficient muscle fibers with compromised membrane repair causes a prolonged
  release of "danger" molecules, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), high mobility
  group box 1 (HMGB1), ATP and uric acids. These "danger" molecules are recognized
  by receptors on leukocytes and the muscle fibers, stimulating generation of proinflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-1β. Other molecules that are exposed or released from the damaged
  cells activate the complement system, followed by the generation of proinflammation
  mediators (for example C3a, C5a) and opsonizing C3b. The proinflammatory mediators
  can trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines from host cells and make
  the local vascular endothelium "leaky", thus attracting migration of neutrophils
  and monocytes. C3b binds to the negatively-charged sarcolemma, stimulating phagocytosis.
  These molecular and cellular responses cause more severe muscle damage and necrosis,
  leading to further release of the "danger" molecules and extensive muscle inflammation.
  The complement system and the inflammatory signaling pathway thus become attractive
  therapeutic targets for the treatment of dysferlinopathy.
