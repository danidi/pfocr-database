caption: The figure shows signaling pathway that may be targeted by diabetic medications
  on epithelial cells (keratinocytes), vascular endothelial cells, “classically activated”
  M1-like macrophages, and “alternative activated” M2-like macrophages present in
  chronic wounds. Classically activated M1-like macrophages produce pro-inflammatory
  gene products that maintain wounds on a persistent inflammatory state. Alternative
  activated M2-like macrophages produce more pro-healing gene products that allow
  wound to resolve the inflammatory state and proceed to healing. All receptors (Insulin
  R, PPARγ R and GLP-1 R) and cell targets are present in both types of macrophages.
