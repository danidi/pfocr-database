caption: Basic pathway for miRNA biogenesis. Pri-miRNA is transcribed from a miRNA
  gene by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). DROSHA and DiGeorge syndrome critical region
  gene 8 (DGCR8) then bind together to form a microprocessor complex, which cleaves
  pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA. Pre-miRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  by exportin-5 (EXP-5), where DICER converts pre-miRNA to mature miRNA along with
  TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) or PACT (also known as PRKRA) and Argonaute protein
  (AGO). DICER, TRBP or PACT, and AGO mediate duplex separation and loading of the
  mature miRNA into the RISC complex (RNA-induced silencing complex), whereby the
  miRNA can regulate gene expression.
