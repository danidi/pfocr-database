caption: Influence of Tc-axin and Tc-pangolin on canonical Wnt signaling and role
  of Wnt signaling in axis formation in the bilateria. (A) In the absence of Wnt ligands,
  the destruction complex marks β-catenin/Armadillo protein for degradation. TCF/Pangolin
  is bound to enhancers of Wnt-responsive genes and represses transcription by recruiting
  corepressors. (B) After binding of the Wnt ligand to the receptor, the destruction
  complex is disassembled leading to transport of β-catenin/Armadillo to the nucleus,
  where it activates Wnt targets by binding to TCF/pangolin. (C) Loss of TCF/pangolin
  leads to derepression of Wnt target genes. This effect is independent of β-catenin
  and other upstream factors (shaded in gray). (D) In axin RNAi, the destruction complex
  cannot form. Hence, canonical Wnt targets are activated by β-catenin/Armadillo binding
  to TCF/Pangolin; this is independent of upstream events (shaded in gray). (E) Throughout
  bilateria and their sister group, the hydrozoa, posterior activity, and anterior
  repression of canonical Wnt signaling have been shown to be essential for axis formation.
  Based on Drosophila data, insects have been regarded as an exception because Wnt
  activity is not required for axis formation. Previous data from Tribolium showed
  that it is required for posterior elongation. Here, we show that canonical Wnt signaling
  needs to be repressed for anterior patterning. Y, functional or expression data
  indicating involvement of the Wnt pathway; N, data not supporting involvement of
  Wnt pathway; ?, no data. Information in E is based on refs.  and  and references
  therein.
