caption: a. Certain gene responses, including the induction of LDTF-encoding genes
  by Nodal-driven SMAD2/3:SMAD4 in ES cells, require the participation of TRIM33.
  Through its PHD and Bromo domains, TRIM33 binds to histone H3 N-terminal tails that
  have repressive chromatin marks (H3K4me0, H3K9me3 and H3K18ac), displacing heterochromatin
  protein 1 (HP1) from these sites. Nodal-activated SMAD2/3 binds to TRIM33, an interaction
  that allows the recruitment of SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complexes by FOXH1 to induce gene expression
  and drive mesendodermal differentiation. TRIM33 can also act as a SMAD4 ubiquitin
  ligase to limit SMAD transcriptional action (not shown).b. Interactions of Nodal-activated
  SMAD2/3:SMAD4 with LDTFs and SDTFs on a target gene. In addition to SMAD2/3:SMAD4
  recruitment by FOXH1 to the Gsc promoter, the activation of this gene requires WNT
  signals. A WNT-driven β-catenin:TCF3 complex and a Nodal-driven SMAD2/3:SMAD4 cooperate
  in binding to a distal enhancer required for activation of Gsc transcription. The
  WNT input is delivered by WNT3, whose expression is induced by p53 and its family
  members p63 and p73. The p53 family, WNT and Nodal are all essential for gastrulation,
  providing evidence for their involvement in SMAD-driven mesendodermal specification.c.
  Representation of YAP-mediated eviction of Nodal-activated SMADs from the nucleus.
  When YAP is phosphorylated by LATS1/2kinases in response to Hippo pathway activation.
  The phosphorylation sites act as binding site for 14-3-3 proteins, which drag SMADs
  into the nucleus and prevents TGF-β signaling.
