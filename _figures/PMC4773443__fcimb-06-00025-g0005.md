caption: 'Metabolic intermediates regulate Yersinia virulence. Understanding the role
  of nucleotide-based second messengers in the regulation of Yersinia survival and
  virulence is still in its infancy. As determined from many studies in E. coli systems,
  three major regulatory molecules are known: (A) c-di-GMP, (B) cAMP and its receptor
  Crp, and (C) ppGpp and pppGpp [collectively known as (p)ppGpp]. Primary activation
  signals control diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF domain containing proteins) to generate
  c-di-GMP (A). Various effector molecules then interact with c-di-GMP to regulate
  gene expression, including Hms-mediated biofilm formation. Deactivating signals
  stimulate phosphodiesterase activity of proteins containing either EAL or HD-GYP
  domains, and this degradation pathway ensures that c-di-GMP levels are stringently
  controlled. Glucose availability and the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)—carbohydrate
  phosphotransferase system (PTS) control cAMP production by adenylate cyclase (AC)
  (B). Upon cAMP production when glucose is limiting, cAMP-CRP complexes form and
  this enhances RNAP holoenzyme binding to vast numbers of sensitive promoters including
  several secreted Yersinia virulence factors. Finally, various forms of starvation
  stimulates RelA-dependent and SpoT/acyl carrier protein (ACP)-dependent synthesis
  of (p)ppGpp (C). By direct binding to the RNA polymerase, (p)ppGpp can influence
  sigma factor competition for core RNAP, and through this affects transcription of
  a plethora of genes that in Yersinia includes the prominent Ysc-Yop plasmid-encoded
  T3SS.'
