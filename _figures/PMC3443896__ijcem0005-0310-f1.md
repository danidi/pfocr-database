caption: The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in
  thyroid cancer by mutant BRAF. The most common genetic alternation in papillary
  thyroid cancer, BRAF mutation, stimulates constitutive signaling which bypasses
  the need for extracellular mitogenic signals. Subsequently phosphorylation of downstream
  MER1/2 and ERK1/2 results in transcriptional regulation of various genes which are
  involved in cell proliferation, differential, survival, tumorigenesis, and the process
  of EMT.
