number: Figure 4
caption: '(A) Heatmap and expression values of probe sets related to irinotecan metabolism
  in both liver and tumor. Expression levels are depicted as the ratio of levels of
  fasted divided by ad libitum fed mice. The coloring scale represents the degree
  of either upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue) expression values. (B) Overview
  of the pathway of irinotecan metabolism outside and inside the liver cell, including
  the transportation into the intestine. The coloring scale represents the expression
  values in the liver depicted as the ratio of levels of fasted divided by ad libitum
  fed mice. These levels are also depicted in figure A. Dashed arrows are suggested
  actions of which the exact mechanisms are unclear. Abbreviations: AL, ad libitum;
  Ces, carboxylesterase; SN-38, active metabolite of irinotecan; SN-38G, SN-38 glucuronide
  form; Abcc, ATP binding cassette subfamily C; NPC/APC, carbonyloxycamptothecin;
  Cyp3a, cytochrome P450 3A; Ugt1a1, Uridine glucuronosyltransferase 1A1.'
