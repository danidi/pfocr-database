caption: (1) Exogenously applied double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and small interfering
  RNA (exo-siRNA) are thought to enter cells via SID (Systemic RNA Interference Defective)
  proteins SID-1/RSD-8 and SID-2. (2) Endogenous RNAi-based pathways begin in the
  nucleus; micro-interfering RNA (miRNA) synthesis begins with transcription of hairpin-looped
  primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts from intergenic, intronic or antisense regions.
  pri-miRNAs are processed by the DRSH-1/PASH-1 complex to pre-miRNA, which are exported
  from the nucleus by exportin proteins XPO-1, -2 and -3. Endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs)
  are also produced from genomic regions, and exported by XPO-1, 2, and -3. (3) Both
  pre-miRNAs and exogenously applied dsRNA molecules are bound and cleaved by the
  dicer complex, which consists of the RNAse III-like nuclease DCR-1, the dsRNA-binding
  proteins RDE-1 and -4, the helicases DRH-1 and DRH-3/EKL-3, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase
  (RdRP) RRF-1, and the uncharacterized protein, AIN-1. Dicer cleaves dsRNA to produce
  siRNA molecules, and pre-miRNA to mature miRNA, both of which are substrates for
  the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). (4) Both siRNAs and miRNAs are the focus
  of a battery of inhibitors, which allow down-regulation of the RNAi response. (5)
  The RISC complex incorporates a single strand of miRNA or siRNA (termed the guide
  strand), and binds a complementary mRNA strand, eliciting gene silencing by either
  mRNA destruction or translational repression (6). The central catalytic component
  of RISC is an argonaute (AGO) protein, allied with the nuclease TSN-1, the RNA-binding
  protein VIG-1, and AIN-1. (7) The RNAi response may be amplified by the action of
  the RdRPs RRF-1 and -2, SMG-5, RDE-2/MUT-8 and MUT-7, which produce a population
  of single-stranded RNAs bearing N-terminal tri-phosphates from a target mRNA template.
  (8) These secondary siRNAs interact with Secondary-siRNA-specific AGOs (SAGO-1 and
  -2), terminating in down-regulation of target transcript. Secondary siRNAs can also
  spread between cells through RSD-2, -3 and -6, resulting in intercellular spread
  of the RNAi effect (9), and can be imported into the nucleus by NRDE-3, which elicits
  transcriptional silencing of nascent RNA transcripts as part of nuclear RISC (nucRISC)
  (10). siRNAs may also control aspects of nuclear RNAi, including histone methylation,
  chromatin formation and chromosome segregation (11). Dashed lines indicate miRNA-based
  pathways, solid lines indicate siRNA-based pathways.
