caption: Hh signaling within the developing TMJ. Approximate representation of the
  murine expression patterns of various chondrogenic and osteogenic regulators (black
  text) including components of the Hh signalling pathway (red text) around (A) E15
  and (B) E18. The bulk of supporting data is from in situ hybridisation studies of
  mRNA expression [,,], with only IHH ligand protein expression established in E18
  tissue []. Please note that IHH is an extracellular signalling molecule capable
  of long-range transport, meaning that IHH protein does not necessarily have to co-localise
  with those cells expressing Ihh (e.g., the detection of IHH protein in non-Ihh expressing
  fibrous cells and articular disc cells). Such observations support a role for intra-
  and inter-tissue IHH-mediated signalling. (C) A generalised overview of the regions
  initiating Hh signalling (Ihh expressing), responding to and/or capable of being
  stimulated by IHH ligand. Figure adapted from Shibukawa et al. [].
