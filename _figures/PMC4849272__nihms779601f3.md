caption: Overview of hepcidin antagonists. Hepcidin antagonists reduce hepcidin production
  or inhibit hepcidin function. The interleukin-6 (IL-6), iron sensing, and bone morphogenetic
  protein (BMP) pathways increase hepcidin production, while erythroferrone (ERFE)
  decreases hepcidin production. In the IL-6 pathway, secreted IL-6 binds the IL-6
  receptor (IL-6R), activating janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and subsequently signal transducers
  and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3 binds to a STAT3 response element
  in the hepcidin promoter to stimulate hepcidin synthesis. Targeting the IL-6 pathway,
  siltuximab and infliximab reduce IL-6 availability while tocilizumab interferes
  with IL-6R binding. Downstream, JAK2 inhibitors AG490 and 3,3′-Diindolylmethane
  (DIM), and STAT3 inhibitors PpYLKTK and curcumin, also interfere with IL-6-stimulated
  hepcidin synthesis. In the iron sensing pathway, diferric transferrin (TF-[Fe+3]2)
  binds to transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and associated human hemochromatosis protein
  (HFE) to increase hepcidin synthesis. Small interfering RNA targeting TFR2 (siTFR2)
  reduces hepcidin production by the iron sensing pathway. Downstream signaling of
  the iron sensing pathway is yet to be worked out but may involve stimulation of
  the BMP pathway. In the BMP signaling pathway, secreted BMPs bind to BMP receptors
  (BMPRs) activating intracellular receptor SMADs (R-SMADs) and SMAD4. SMADs bind
  to BMP-responsive elements in the hepcidin promoter stimulating hepcidin synthesis.
  BMP signaling can be enhanced by the hemojuvelin (HJV) coreceptor. A soluble HJV
  conjugate (sHJV.Fc), SOSTDC1, and heparins reduce hepcidin expression by sequestering
  BMPs. Dorsomophin, LDN-193189, and TP-0184 interfere with BMP receptors while small
  interfering RNA against HJV (siHJV) and HJV targeted antibodies (ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8)
  also reduce BMP signaling. Finally, several hepcidin antagonists interfere with
  hepcidin-FPN interactions. Small interfering RNA against hepcidin (siHepcidin),
  PRS-080, NOX-H94, and 12B9m specifically target hepcidin, while LY2928057 and fursultiamine
  prevent hepcidin binding to FPN.
