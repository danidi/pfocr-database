caption: Immature and mature neutrophils have different metabolic requirements. A.
  In the presence of normal glucose levels, immature neutrophils undergo autophagy
  to a proper maturation through FAO associated with OXPHOS. In the same way, during
  a low glucose levels context (tumoral environment), immature neutrophils prioritize
  FAO associated with OXPHOS to increase NADPH levels and consequently oxidants production.
  Excess of oxidants leads to T cell inhibition, contributing to tumor growth. B.
  Mature neutrophils prioritize aerobic glycolysis and generate NADPH from PPP. NADPH
  is the Nox2 substrate to produce oxidants inside the phagosome and crucial to eliminate
  phagocyted pathogens. Oxidants from Nox2 are also important to NETs formation from
  genomic DNA while mtROS are important to mitochondrial NETs production. Intracellular
  Ca2+ levels stimulate mitochondrial ATP production by the mTOR pathway. The ATP
  acts in an autocrine way by binding the P2Y2 receptors in the neutrophils stimulating
  intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and chemotaxis. Mitochondrial fission also contributes
  to neutrophil chemotaxis.

  description: Immature and mature neutrophils have different metabolic requirements.
    A. In the presence of normal glucose levels, immature neutrophils undergo autophagy

    FAO associated with OXPHOS to increase NADPH levels and consequently oxidants

    NETs production. Intracellular Ca2+ levels stimulate mitochondrial ATP production
