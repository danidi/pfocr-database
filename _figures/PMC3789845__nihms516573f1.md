caption: Under normoxia, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by prolyl-4-hydroxylases and targeted
  for proteasomal degradation by the pVHL–E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. When prolyl-4-hydroxylation
  is inhibited—for example, in the absence of molecular oxygen—HIF-1α is not degraded
  and translocates to the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). HIF-1α/ARNT heterodimers bind to the HIF consensus
  binding site, RCGTG, followed by transactivation of target genes. Nitric oxide,
  reactive oxygen species, the Krebs cycle metabolites succinate and fumarate, cobalt
  chloride, and iron chelators such as desferrioxamine inhibit HIF prolyl-4-hydroxylation
  in the presence of oxygen. In normoxic mesangial cells, hyperglycemia results in
  increased HIF-1α protein levels and increased expression of HIF-regulated genes
  (for example, PAI-1 and CTGF) irrespective of oxygen levels. Increased glucose flux
  results in the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to xylulose-5-phosphate by the
  hexose monophosphate shunt pathway. Xylulose-5-phosphate activates protein phosphatase
  2A, which in turn dephosphorylates carbohydrate response element binding protein
  (ChREBP), allowing for its nuclear translocation. In mesangial cells ChREBP binds
  to the proximal HIF1A promoter, stimulating its transcription. The proposed mechanism
  for ChREBP activation in mesangial cells is based on studies with hepatocytes. CBP,
