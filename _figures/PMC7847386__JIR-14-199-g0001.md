caption: Nucleic acid-sensing pathways and their evasion by SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19
  infection. The nucleic acid-sensing pathways within the innate immune system recognizes
  the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) comprising of viral nucleic acids
  and other viral intermediates including single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or double-stranded
  RNA (dsRNA), via distinct pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The RNA-sensing
  arm is activated by RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, while DNA-sensing is triggered
  by host genome released as byproducts of viral reproduction and tissue injury. These
  receptors include toll‐like receptor (TLR), RIG‐I‐like receptor (RLR), C‐type lectin‐like
  receptors (CLmin) as well as certain cytoplasmic free‐molecule receptors, such as
  stimulator of interferon genes (STING), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and NOD‐like
  receptor (NLR). Coronaviruses (CoVs) which are typically ssRNA viruses, form dsRNA
  during their replicative stage. While ssRNA can be detected by TLR7 or TLR8 and
  potentially RIG-I and PKR, dsRNA engages TLR3 in the endosome and RIG-I, MDA5, and
  PKR in the cytosol. The cGAS-STING pathway is incapable of directly sensing RNA
  of CoVs; however, they are likely to get activated by danger-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMP) signals, such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), released as a result
  of CoV infection. These PRRs initiate a signaling cascade culminating in primarily
  type I interferon (IFN-α/β) and inflammatory cytokine production (IL-6 and IL-1β).
  The presence of low innate antiviral defenses to SARS-CoV-2 suggests the presence
  of effective evasion mechanisms by SARS-CoV-2 to escape immune surveillance. SARS-CoV-2
  is suggested to suppress IFN-I response by means of similar mechanisms as used by
  SARS-CoV-1, namely Nsp1, Nsp3d/PLpro, Nsp7, Nsp15/EndoU, Nsp16, ORF3, ORF6, ORF8,
  ORF9b, M, and N.
