caption: a | Various transcription factors regulate sirtuin expression. FOXO1, PPARα,
  PPARβ/δ and CREB enhance SIRT1 (in green), whereas PPARγ, ChREBP, PARP2 and HIC1
  repress SIRT1 expression (in red). Only CREB, ChREBP and PARP2 were also shown to
  possess this activity in vivo. Sirt1 expression is also repressed by the miRNAs
  miR-34a and miR-199a. b | Reversible post-translational modifications affect SIRT1
  activity. The cyclinB/Cdk1 complex phosphorylates (P) SIRT1 thereby allowing cell
  cycle progression. Activation of JNK by reactive oxygen species (ROS) results in
  SIRT1 phosphorylation and subsequent deacetylation of histone H3, but not p53. Genotoxic
  stress, for instance by UV light or H2O2 exposure, results in desumoylation of SIRT1,
  inactiving it. Sumoylation (sumo) by a yet unidentified enzyme activates SIRT1.
  c | Complex formation with other proteins influences SIRT1 enzymatic activity. A
  complex of NCoR1 and SIRT1 blocks the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Genotoxic
  and metabolic (high-fat diet) stress induce DBC1-SIRT1 complex formation, by which
  DBC1 inactivates SIRT1. Fasting relieves this inactivation. The LSD1-SIRT1 complex
  represses Notch target gene expression by demethylation and deacetylation of specific
  histones, but is derepressed by activation of the Notch pathway. Complex formation
  with AROS activates SIRT1. d | Controlling the levels of the cofactor NAD+ governs
  SIRT1 function. NAD+ levels are increased by providing precursors nicotinic acid
  (NA), nicotinamide (NAM) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), inhibiting its breakdown
  by means of PARP or CD38 inhibition, or by AMPK activation following energy stress
  or treatment with the AMPK activator resveratrol. Increased NAD+ levels subsequently
  lead to sirtuin activation.
