caption: 'Clinical imaging of cancer metabolism. Many cancer cells metabolize glucose
  preferentially to lactate, even in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect).
  Glucose is taken up on the glucose transporters (GLUT), while pyruvate and lactate
  enter cells through the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). The PPP is linked to
  glycolysis via glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), which is oxidized by glucose 6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Flux into the oxidative arm of the PPP is promoted by TIGAR.
  Serine and glycine can be produced from 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), and both amino
  acids can fuel the THF pathway. Glutamine is deamidated by glutaminase (GLS), which
  can yield NADPH via NADP+-dependent malic enzyme (ME, EC 1.1.1.40) activity. NADPH
  generated from the oxidative PPP, ME flux, and the THF pathway is used for lipid
  biosynthesis and redox balance, whereas; intermediates from the nonoxidative PPP
  and the THF pathway are used for nucleic acid synthesis. Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH) in the TCA cycle generates the “oncometabolite” 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG).
  IDH1 in the cytosol is mutated in most grade II/III gliomas, whereas IDH2 in the
  mitochondria is less commonly mutated. The hexosamine pathway branches off from
  glycolysis at G6P and produces substrates for cell surface glycosylation. Imaging
  agents that are used clinically and explore some of the aforementioned metabolic
  features of tumors are shown in blue (PET tracers), green (hyperpolarized substrates),
  and purple (metabolites detectable by 1H-MRS). Abbreviations: 18F-FDG, 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose;
