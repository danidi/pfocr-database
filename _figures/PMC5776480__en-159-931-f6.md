caption: Model illustrating how PNU attenuates nicotine plus HFD–induced hepatic steatosis.
  Nicotine plus an HFD promotes abdominal lipolysis, resulting in FFA release from
  adipose tissue into the circulation, thereby contributing to the buildup of lipids
  as TG in the liver. In addition, nicotine plus an HFD could promote hepatic lipogenesis
  through inactivation of AMPK and activation of its downstream target ACC, leading
  to the development of hepatic steatosis. Inactivation of AMPK can also stimulate
  lipogenesis through upregulation of key genes in the lipogenic pathway such as FAS
  and ACC by activating the transcription factor sSREBP-1c. Intrahepatic lipid accumulation
  can also trigger hepatocellular apoptosis through generation of oxidative stress.
  AMPK inactivation could further sensitize liver cells to nicotine plus HFD–induced
  apoptosis. PNU seems to protect nicotine plus HFD–induced hepatic steatosis through
  suppression of oxidative stress and activation of AMPK signaling, together with
  inhibition of its downstream target, including SREBP1c, ACC, and FAS. FFA, free
  fatty acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TG, triglyceride.
