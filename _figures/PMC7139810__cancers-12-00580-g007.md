caption: 'The reciprocal link between the serine biosynthesis pathway (SBP) and MYC
  oncogene. High PHGDH and PSAT1 activity leads to increased serine production, which
  fuels 1C metabolism, including folate and methionine cycles. One-carbon units from
  serine are utilized in the methionine cycle for the production of S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), which provides methyl groups for cellular methylation reactions, such as
  histone H3 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Increased H3K27me3 level is required to block
  miR-494 expression, which targets the transcription of MYC oncogene. MYC contributes
  to maintain high H3K27me3 level by indirectly regulating the expression of EZH2
  methyltransferase and promoting the expression of SBP enzymes PHGHD and PSAT1 through
  ATF4 transcription factor. Sharp arrows: activation; blunt arrows: inhibition.'
