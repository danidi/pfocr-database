caption: Proposed signaling pathway for LPI in cardiomyocytes that contributes to
  exacerbation of I/R injury. LPI is known to increase intracellular calcium in cardiomyocytes
  via direct entry through LTCC's and through PLC/IP 3‐mediated release from the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum (black arrows). Here we have shown that LPI results in both ROCK and p38
  MAPK activation (blue arrows); while p38 MAPK activation has been linked to a pro‐apoptotic
  effect during ischemia (pink), lack of evidence of activation of pro‐apoptotic pathways
  suggests this is not the cause of LPI‐induced cardiomyocyte cell injury. The proposed
  pathways (red arrows) are p38 MAPK‐induced mitochondrial release of Ca2+ and ROS
  production
