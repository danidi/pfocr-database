caption: Model for retrograde signaling during drought and EL stress. Drought shares
  a common feature with EL stress in that both stresses induce ABA-mediated signaling,
  which activates transcription of stress response genes such as ZAT10, APX2 and ELIP2.
  The production of ROS species during drought can also induce changes in gene expression
  leading to a drought response. At PSII, 1O2 accumulation can induce programmed cell
  death; this is also regulated by EXECUTER (EX), but the pathway beyond the chloroplast
  is unknown. ROS produced at PSI also influence gene transcription. O2− accumulation
  can influence gene transcription but the mechanism is unclear. While the role of
  H2O2 in stress response, particularly in ABA-signaling, is well-studied, it is unknown
  if H2O2 can directly move to the nucleus to influence transcription. Another interesting
  possibility is that retrograde signals may actually be metabolites normally regarded
  as by-products and broken down by catabolic enzymes; these molecules may accumulate
  during stress and influence nuclear transcription (question mark). All dashed lines
  indicate areas that require more research.
