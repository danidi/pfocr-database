caption: Model for fumarate metabolism in P. falciparum. Cytosolic fumarate generated
  from the purine salvage pathway is metabolized to malate by mitochondrial fumarate
  hydratase, which then is converted to oxaloacetate by malate quinone oxidoreductase.
  In the latter step, CoQ is reduced to CoQH2, which is subsequently oxidized back
  to CoQ by complex III. Finally, oxaloacetate is converted to aspartate by a cytosolic
  aspartate aminotransferase.
