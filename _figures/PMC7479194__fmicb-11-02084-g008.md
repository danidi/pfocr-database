caption: A model for Fic-mediated induction of bacterial cell filamentation and its
  regulation. Fic-1 and AntF form a dynamic complex under normal conditions in the
  cell. Potential signals from the environment such as phage infection, starvation,
  antibiotics, changes in temperature or pH, activate a signaling cascade that leads
  to the production of a sequestering protein (Seq) that competes for AntF or the
  activation of a protease that degrades AntF. Freed or activated Fic-1 then inactivates
  ParE or GyrB by AMPylation, following by inhibition of DNA replication and separation,
  and leading to initiation of the SOS response, which includes the induction of SulA
  and the formation of filamentous cells. Alternatively, inactivation of ParE or GyrB
  by AMPylation may induce cell filamentation through an SOS response–independent
  pathway (dashed arrows).
