caption: Chronic hyperglycemia impairs neuron function. Sensory neurons have a limited
  capacity to regulate their uptake of glucose. In the context of chronic hyperglycemia,
  such as in diabetes, high glucose concentrations drive mitochondria to produce ATP
  and transfer electrons. Excess glucose is also metabolized through the polyol pathway,
  leading to the production of advanced glycation end products. The electrons from
  the mitochondrial respiratory chain combine with intracellular oxygen and nitric
  oxide to produce ROS and RNS. Consequently, RNS, ROS, and AGE activate nuclear transcription
  factors, which enhance the expression of ion channel transducers (TRP and NaV channels)
  in addition to impairing neurons' capacity to self-repair. At the same time, microglia-released
  mediators (cytokines, ATP, BDNF, NO) stimulate GPCR and tyrosine kinase receptors,
  triggering downstream signaling cascades, which lead to the phosphorylation of TRP
  and NaV channels. A decrease in the activation threshold of these ion channel transducers
  can augment the influx of cations, which ultimately results in action potential
  firing and ectopic discharges. These effects enhance pain perception and signaling
  to the CNS. Chronic hyperglycemia also increases oxidative stress in the blood vessels
  that supply oxygen and nutrients to neuron terminals. This oxidative stress can
  cause microangiopathy, a phenomenon characterized by the loss of capillaries, which
  starves neuronal energy supplies. These phenomena are responsible for the loss of
  neuron terminals and pain insensitivity, as typically observed in later stage of
  DPN.
