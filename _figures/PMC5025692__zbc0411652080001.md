caption: Biosynthetic pathway of violacein (black), staurosporine (blue), and rebeccamycin
  (red). Orthologous enzymes VioA, StaO, or RebO and VioB, StaD, or RebD are involved
  in the initial pathway for the synthesis of violacein, staurosporine, and rebeccamycin,
  respectively (highlighted in gray). A Trp moiety (l-Trp) is converted into indole-3-pyruvic
  acid imine (IPA imine) and subsequently dimerized into a short-lived compound proposed
  as IPA imine dimer. Synthesis of rebeccamycin initially requires the chlorination
  of l-Trp to 7-Cl-Trp by virtue of RebH and RebF. Violacein biosynthesis then includes
  a VioE-dependent [1,2]-shift of the indole ring (curved arrow) resulting in protodeoxyviolaceinic
  acid. Subsequent VioD and VioC catalysis followed by a final autocatalytic oxidation
  step leads to the product violacein. A deoxyviolacein derivative is synthesized
  without involvement of VioD. For staurosporine and rebeccamycin biosynthesis, the
  IPA imine dimer is spontaneously converted into chromopyrrolic acid. Subsequent
  enzymes StaP, StaC, StaG, StaN, StaMA, StaMB or RebP, RebC, RebG, RebM then facilitate
  the synthesis of staurosporine or rebeccamycin.
