caption: a MEP pathway and related metabolism showing the major metabolic regulatory
  points. d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G-3P);1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP);
  methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP); diphosphocytidyl methylerythritol (CDP-ME);
  diphosphocytidyl methylerythritol 2-phosphate (CDP-MEP); hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate
  (HMBPP); isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP); dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP); farnesyl
  diphosphate (FPP). b The limiting step for lycopene production was divided into
  three modules. The feedforward module including dxs and dxr, feedback module including
  idi and crtE and lycopene synthetic module including crtI, crtE and crtB for lycopene
  production
