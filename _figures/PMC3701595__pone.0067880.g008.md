caption: Acetic acid is metabolized to acetyl-CoA with consumption of ATP in bovine
  hepatocytes, resulting in a significant elevation of the AMP/ATP ratio and the phosphorylation
  and activation of AMPKα. Activated AMPKα increases the expression and transcriptional
  activity of PPARα, thereby increasing the expression of lipolytic genes, including
  ACO, CPT1, CPT2, and L-FABP. AMPKα activation inhibits the expression and transcriptional
  activity of SREBP-1c and ChREBP, thereby reducing the expression of lipogenic genes,
  including ACC1, FAS, and SCD-1. In addition, activated AMPKα directly phosphorylates
  and inhibits ACC1. Consequently, acetic acid increases lipolysis and reduces lipid
  synthesis in bovine hepatocytes.
