caption: Folate mediated one-carbon cycle. Folic acid (vitamin B9) is a cofactor in
  one-carbon metabolism, acting as a shuttle for methyl groups that will be used in
  the metabolism of s-adenosyl methionine (SAM), de novo synthesis of purines and
  thymidylate. Dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), an enzyme involved in the recycling
  of this cofactor, reduces dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (THF), thereby preparing
  the folate derivative for subsequent methyl group addition. This enzyme is competitively
  inhibited by methotrexate (MTX), a chemotherapeutic drug with a thousand fold higher
  binding affinity for dhfr then its natural substrate, dihydrofolate TYMS – thymidylate
  synthetase, MTHFD – methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, MTHFR – methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase, MS – methionine synthase, MTRR – methionine synthase reductase, MAT-
  Methionine adenosyltransferase, SAHH - s-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase, SAH –
  s-adenosyl homocysteine. Enzymes in red are discussed in this paper.
