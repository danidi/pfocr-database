caption: Production of H2S from d-cysteine by the 3MST/DAO pathway. d-Cysteine is
  metabolized by the peroxisomal enzyme DAO to 3MP, which is transferred to the mitochondria
  and metabolized by 3MST to H2S. In the kidney, the production of H2S from d-cysteine
  is 60 times higher than that from l-cysteine. DAO, d-amino acid oxidase; 3MP, 3-mercaptopyruvate.
