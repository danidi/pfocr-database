caption: Model showing the proposed mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated regulation of the
  p53 pathway. p53 controls cell cycle arrest, repair, and apoptosis in response to
  DNA damage. lncRNA-RoR binds to hnRNP-I and collaboratively suppresses p53 mRNA
  translation. This is an autoregulatory feedback loop that controls p53 levels. In
  response to DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and activated via phosphorylation mediated
  by the ATM/ATR pathway. p53 directly binds the target genes and regulates their
  expression to control cell cycle arrest, repair, and apoptosis. eRNAs are involved
  in promotion of p53-target genes in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. p21 and lncRNA-p21,
  which is transcribed near the p21 Cip1 gene, are p53-target genes. lncRNA-p21 controls
  the expression of some p53-target genes. p53 function is partially mediated by gene
  regulation via lncRNA-p21
