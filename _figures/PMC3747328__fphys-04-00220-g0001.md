caption: 'Schematic illustration of the role of K+ channels during cell cycle progression
  and proliferation. (1) Membrane potential model: during progression into G1 phase,
  the membrane potential becomes hyperpolarized relative to the normal resting potential.
  The hyperpolarization relates to Kv channels activation (for example Kv1.3, Eag1)
  in early G1 and to Ca2+−activated K+ channels (for example KCa3.1) activation in
  late G1 and/or G1/S transition. Multiple growth factors in serum have been well-described
  to play an important role in initiating G1 progression to the S phase of the cell
  cycle, in which Ca2+ influx is a major determinant in serum-induced DNA synthesis.
  Growth factors (for example IGF-1) binding to the receptor tyrosine kinases [RTKs;
  for example, Insulin growth factor receptor (IGF-1R)] can activate effectors [Extracellular
  signal-Regulated Kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)] that
  increase the expression and the activity of K+ channels inducing a hyperpolarization
  of the membrane potential (MP). Moreover, RTKs also activate phospholipase C (PLCγ)
  to promote the generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and the release
  of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol. Ca2+ enters across
  plasma membrane by store-operated capacitive Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through the ORAI1
  (Hammadi et al., ) or ORAI3 (Faouzi et al., ) channels, through TRP Ca2+ channels
  (for example TRPC1, El Hiani et al., ), or via the constitutively active TRPV6.
  The Ca2+ entry, in turn, regulates the activity and/or the expression of Ca2+-activated
  K+ channels (for example KCa3.1), which maintains the hyperpolarization promoting
  a significant Ca2+-entry. The increase in [Ca2+]i triggers the activation of Ca2+-dependent
  signaling enzymes that may act by regulating the expression or activity of the transcription
  factors (TF), such as FOS, JUN, NFAT, C-MYC leading to the expression of cyclins
  and CDKs and the inhibition of the CDK inhibitor proteins (p27KIP1 and p21waf1/cip1).
  (2) Volume control: K+ channels in association with chloride channels regulate cell
  cycle progression by controlling the cell volume. For example, Eag2 channels control
  M phase by regulating the expression of cyclin B1 through the p38 MAP Kinase pathway.
  (3) Non-conducting roles: K+ channels may also promote cell proliferation independently
  of their ion permeation function. For example: Eag1 and KCa3.1 induce cell proliferation
  by (direct or indirect) interaction with MAP kinase signaling pathways (p38 for
  Eag1, ERK1/2, and JNK for KCa3.1). MP: membrane potential, (vol. CTRL): volume control,
  (PM): plasma membrane.'
