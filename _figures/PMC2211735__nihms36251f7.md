caption: (A) TGF-β and Dicer-1 are required for GSC maintenance in adult Drosophila
  ovary. We have identified bantam as the key microRNA in this process. Bantam has
  previously been studied in cell cycle and cell death in Drosophila imaginal disc
  epithelial cells. However, in GSC the bantam target process that leads to GSC maintenance
  in the niche remains to be revealed. (B) Surprisingly, we find that Mad and Dicer-1
  are not required for GSC maintenance if these components are lost in GSCs during
  larval/pupal development. Preadult GSCs lacking Dicer-1 are no longer maintained
  if they also lack Dicer-2. We propose that the Dicer-2 pathway prevents GSC loss,
  possibly by chromatin remodeling during developmental stages, which as a consequence
  promotes stem cell fate during adulthood.
