caption: Schematic representation of the ILK signaling and its putative regulation
  by the micro-RNA-1 (miR-1). This pathway was adapted from the pathway determined
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and represents the main genes differentially regulated
  in response to 3–7 days of mechanical overload. The gene expression of these components
  of ILK signaling was determined by microarray and is presented in . As shown in
  , the gene expression of two members of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family,
  IRS1 and SH2B2, is decreased and increased, respectively (represented by green in
  the figure). The gene expression of some components of myosin is either increased
  or decreased (represented by green in the figure; gene expression presented in ).
  The genes designated in purple are predicted targets of miR-1. ECM, extracellular
  matrix; PARVA, parvin-α; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; FN1, fibronectin 1; SNAI2, snail homolog 2; CTN-β,
  β-catenin; CCND1, cyclin D1; MYC, v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog.
