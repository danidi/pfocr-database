caption: Proposed model of the transgelin mechanisms involved in promoting colon cancer
  metastasis. Once the cancer cells receive signals from the tumor micro-environment,
  transgelin directly remodels the cytoskeleton. It also binds to the PARP1 forming
  a complex which translocates into the nucleus where it regulates the expression
  of the key genes. Subsequently, the Rho signaling pathway is stimulated and initiates
  cytoskeletal remodeling which promotes colon cancer metastasis
