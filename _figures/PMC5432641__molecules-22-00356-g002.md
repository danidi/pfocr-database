caption: Schematic of nucleotide excision repair and the ATR-CHK1-mediated DNA damage
  checkpoint. (A) In nucleotide excision repair, UV photoproducts (denoted by T<>T
  and yellow triangles) are initially sensed through either the XPC-dependent global
  genome repair pathway or the CSA/CSB-dependent transcription-coupled repair pathway.
  Regardless of the mode of damage recognition, the TFIIH, RPA, and XPA function to
  verify the presence of the lesion and promote the assembly of the active repair
  machinery. The subsequent recruitment and incisions by the XPF and XPG endonucleases
  generate a ~30-nt-long excision gap and a small (~30-nt-long), excised, damage-containing
  DNA oligonucleotide (sedDNA). Filling in of the gap by a DNA polymerase and ligase
  and degradation of the sedDNA completes the repair reaction. (B) Unfilled excision
  gaps and DNA polymerase stalling at UV lesions generate regions of ssDNA that become
  bound by RPA and dsDNA/ssDNA primer-template junctions. These structures lead to
  the assembly of an active ATR-CHK1 signaling complex comprised of the RHINO-9-1-1
  clamp and the ATR-activator TopBP1. In addition, RPA promotes the recruitment of
  the adaptor proteins Timeless-Tipin and Claspin, which function to specifically
  allow ATR to phosphorylate CHK1. The activation of these kinases leads to phosphorylation
  of a multiple downstream targets, many of which transiently prevent DNA synthesis
  in cells with UV-induced DNA damage.
