caption: 'Aβ peptides are derived from APP. APP can be processed by amyloidogenic
  and nonamyloidogenic pathways which lead to different outcomes. In a nonamyloidogenic
  pathway, APP is initially cleaved by α-secretase to release sAPP-α and the left
  fragment is further processed by γ-secretase complex. In the amyloid pathway, APP
  is cleaved by β-secretase followed by γ-secretase complex to produce Aβ40/42, sAPP-β
  and AICD. Aβ42 has a high potential to aggregate to form toxic Aβ oligomers which
  cause the impairment of synapses and neurons. The Aβ oligomers increase the influx
  of Ca2+ and other different ions resulting in membrane depolarization. These results
  affect the function of different receptors and channels such as NAMDR, AMPAR and
  VDCC. In addition, the elevated Ca2+ can affect the modulation of tau-phosphorylating
  kinases such as GSK3β and CDK5, and result in the hyperphosphorylation of tau and
  the subsequent NFTs. Aβ also cause ER stress and mitochondria dysfunction by increase
  of ROS and Ca2+ dysregulation, which finally lead to dysfunction, degeneration and
  death of neurons. Based on the mechanisms and underlying targets associated with
  AD, some promising therapeutics designated by medicine bottles are under development,
  such as cholinergic drugs, amyloid-targeted therapies as well as drugs to target
  tau protein, mitochondrial function and neurotrophins.Aβ: Amyloid β; AD: Alzheimer’s
