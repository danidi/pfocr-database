caption: Schematic representation of S100A8 induction in macrophages. LPS from bacteria
  is recognized by the surface receptor TLR4, activating MyD88-dependent and independent
  pathways. IRAKs and TRAF6 are recruited to MyD88 and subsequently activates a complex
  of TAK1 and TABs resulting phosphorylation of IκB and nuclear translocation of NF-κB.
  Simultaneously, TAK1 activates MAP kinase cascades leading to activation of AP-1.
  For the MyD88-independent pathway, TLR4 translocates to the endosome together with
  TRAM. In addition, TLR3 in the endosome, recognizes viral dsRNA. TLR3 and TLR4 activate
  TRIF-dependent signaling and subsequently activate NF-κB and IRF3. TLR-3 and TLR-4
  activation triggers S100A8 gene induction in macrophages, but requires other factors.
  Induction is a late event that relies on de novo synthesized proteins, particularly
  IL-10, and class II transcription factors e.g. C/EBPs. AP-1 and Stat-3 bind to the
  S100A8 promoter. S100A8 is considered a stress response gene, and intracellular
  ROS generation either via NOXs or mitochondria (Mt) may be essential for induction.
  Intracellular S100A8, together with S100A9, can interact with components of the
  cytoskeleton and may mediate their rearrangements and dynamics. S100A8 and S100A9
  directly bind to components of the NOX complex and mediate its activity. On the
  other hand, S100A8 is a potent oxidant scavenger and oxidative modifications of
  S100A8 can change its functions. S100A8 is actively secreted via a non-classical
  pathway which requires a functional microtubule network to exert its extracellular
  functions.
