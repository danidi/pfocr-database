caption: Accumulation of DNA SSB in cardiomyocytes induces persistent activation of
  DDR and subsequent activation of NF-κB pathway, resulting in increased expressions
  of inflammatory cytokines. These mechanisms may contribute, at least in part, to
  increased cardiac inflammation and the progression of pressure overload-induced
  heart failure.
