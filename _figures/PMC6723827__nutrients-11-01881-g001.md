caption: Schematic presentation of autophagic pathways. (A) Macroautophagy. The key
  event in macroautophagy is the de novo formation of a new organelle called the autophagosome,
  which surrounds and sequesters either random portions of the cytoplasm or selectively
  targets individual cytosolic components. Initially, double-membraned cup-shaped
  structures, called phagophores or membrane isolation, engulf the cytosolic cargo.
  The expansion of the double membrane ends with the completion of the autophagosome
  that is trafficked by microtubules. The fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome
  constitutes an autolysosome where the trapped cargo can be degraded. (B) Microautophagy.
  The cytosolic cargo (amino acids, lipids, sugar) is translocated into the lysosomes
  for degradation via direct invagination, protrusion, or septation of the lysosomal
  limiting membrane. (C) Chaperone mediated autophagy. It selects a defined pool of
  proteins that contains the KFERQ motif and delivers them to lysosomes via the chaperone
  HSC70 and cochaperones. The complex formed by HSC70 and the KFERQ-containing protein
  interacts with the lysosome-associated surface membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A).
  Then, the KFERQ-containing protein unfolds and is transported across the lysosome
  membrane by a lysosome form of HSC70 (lys-HSC70), which resides inside the lysosome.
  GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein.
