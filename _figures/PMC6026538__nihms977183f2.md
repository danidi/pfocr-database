caption: Recognition of pathogens and their components by their corresponding receptors
  initiates expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. IL-6). TLR4 and its co-receptor
  proteins are recruited to ABC transporter-suppressible lipid rafts upon activation
  by LPS, inducing pro-inflammatory gene expression through IRF3 and NF-κB, while
  inhibiting LXR-dependent induction of cholesterol efflux genes (ABCA1, ABCG1, apoE).
  Deficiency of ABCA1 or ABCG1 increases TLR4 surface expression and signaling. LXRs,
  activated by oxysterols originating from cholesterol synthesized in the ER via the
  acetyl CoA pathway or internalized by scavenger receptors, suppress NF-κB. Some
  oxysterols, such as 25HC, have complex actions on host inflammatory responses, inhibiting
  virus and the inflammasome while augmenting AP-1-dependent gene expression. Many
  pathogens co-opt host raft components and can hijack raft-associated signaling pathways.
  Examples shown include Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, West Nile
  Virus, and HIV-1. Cholesterol depletion by statins disrupts L. monocytogenes infection
  by preventing cholesterol-dependent listeriolysin-O-mediated phagosomal escape of
  bacteria. P. aeruginosa is dependent on membrane rafts for successful propagation.
  WNV redistributes host cell cholesterol to evade the immune response via inhibition
  of the JAK-STAT recognition system. HIV-1 requires lipid rafts for assembly and
  infection of target cells as well as budding, and inhibits ABCA1; however, treatment
  with 25HC reduces HIV-1 RNA in CD4+ T-cells. ABCA; ATP-binding cassette; TLR, toll
  like receptor; IL, interleukin; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  LXR, Liver X Receptor; 25HC, 25-hydroxycholesterol, ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WNV,
