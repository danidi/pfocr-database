number: Figure 2
caption: 'Schematic representation of canonical and non-canonical inflammasome signaling
  pathways.Notes: The figure describes both the canonical and non-canonical signaling
  pathways involved in the activation of different inflammasome components including
  NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2. The canonical inflammasome signaling pathway causes
  activation of procaspase 1 into mature CASP1 that cleaves immature proIL-1β and
  proIL-18 into mature IL-1β and IL-18 involved in the generation of inflammatory
  immune response. The intracellular LPS and type-1 IFNs cause induction of non-canonical
  signaling in macrophages and DCs via the induction of procaspase 11 that further
  activates NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing a decrease in cytosolic K+ through different
  mechanisms described in the text. Additionally, CASP11 cleaves GSDMD into N- and
  C-terminal components that, upon their cytosolic accumulation, form GSDMD oligomer
  causing cell death, while GSDMD-NT causes pyroptosis, but it does not cause the
  death of adjacent cells upon its extracellular release. Detailed mechanism of inflammasome
  signaling pathway is mentioned elsewhere in the text.Abbreviations: DAMP, death/damage-associated
  molecular pattern; DCs, dendritic cells; GSDMD, gasdermin D; IFN, interferon; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern.'
