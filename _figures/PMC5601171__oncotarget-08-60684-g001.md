caption: Gene activation, repression and cross-talk with other key self-renewal pathways
  (A) Activation of the Hh pathway begins with the binding of the SHH ligand to the
  membrane receptor PTCH1, removing the catalytic inhibition on SMO and promoting
  its displacement to the cell membrane for a posterior interaction with an endogenous
  ligand (a GTPase type protein has been proposed), promoting the nuclear translocation
  and transcriptional activity of GLI1A. The absence of SHH maintains the interaction
  of PTCH1 on SMO, contributing to the inhibition by blocking its displacement to
  the cell membrane, and promoting GLI proteolysis, which translocates as GLIR, this
  in turn modulates the transcriptional repression of, among others, PTCH1, Cyclin
  D and E, FOXM1, ABCG2, SOX2. (B) The cross-talk between renewal and cancer pathways
  is mediated by the PKA and GS3Kβ kinases, with the canonical Hippo PKA being able
  to phosphorylate the LATS and MOB proteins by carrying a cascade of phosphorylation
  to YAP, inactivating its nuclei translocation capacity. While the WNT pathway, through
  GS3Kβ in conjunction with APC phosphorylates β-Catenin, promoting proteasome degradation
  and inhibition of translocation to nucleus, while equally PKA and GS3Kβ phosphorylate
  members of the GLI family, preventing its translocation to nucleus and altering
  its functional cell signaling capacity.
