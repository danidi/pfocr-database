caption: Context-dependent function of HIPK2 in Wnt signaling. A positive or negative
  role of HIPK2 in Wnt signaling depends on the availability and type of TCF proteins
  that are present in the responding cell. HIPK2 would inhibit the pathway upon phosphorylation
  of an activator type TCF, such as LEF1, but would activate it upon phosphorylation
  of a repressor, such as TCF3.
