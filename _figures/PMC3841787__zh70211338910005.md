caption: The proposed signaling pathway model for VEGF-A signaling in hypoxia-stressed
  BM-EPCs compiled from the proteomic and gene expression analysis is highlighted
  here. All of the signaling cascade members in the generated pathways depicted above
  were observed as significantly increased or near significance in the VEGF-A hypoxia
  conditions during proteomic signaling pathway analysis or in the RT-PCR signaling
  data. The outcomes of this pathway model are also supported by functional data in
  this study. Based on the results in this study, we hypothesize that the influence
  of VEGF-A stimulation of BM-EPCs in a hypoxic environment induces cell migration
  of this cell type to sites of vascular regeneration through a variety of pathways,
  including inositol/calcium, NO, inflammatory, cell survival, and G protein signaling
  processes, among others.
