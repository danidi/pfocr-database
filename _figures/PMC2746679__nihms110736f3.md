caption: 'Negative- (closed arrow –•) and positive- (open arrow →) feedback loops
  involved in p53 signaling are highlighted and the manner in which they intertwine
  to synchronize regulation of the cell cycle with the regulation of protein synthesis.
  Indicated are classical components of the p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest pathway:
  Mdm2, Mdm4 and the p53-effector p21waf1; essential components of the metabolic fuel-sensing
  pathway: AMPK and mTORC; and the recently positioned sestrins, as discussed in the
  text.mTORC: Mammalian target of rapamycin complex.'
