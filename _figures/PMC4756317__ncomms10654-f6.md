caption: 'Schematic view of the sterol and SGA biosynthetic pathway. Dashed arrows
  represent multiple biosynthetic reactions whereas solid arrows represent a single
  step. The graphs next to each gene name show expression levels in wild-type (WT)
  and four GAME9-Ox independent lines (lines 1:#7, 2:#20, 3:#21 and 4:#22) determined
  by qRT-PCR. For genes where qRT-PCR data is not presented, it is due to technical
  reasons and differential expression awaits confirmation. According to RNA-Seq data,
  expression of HMGR, SQS, TTS1 was similar, and SGT2 was overexpressed in GAME9-Ox
  lines. Arrows next to each compound represent an increase (red) or decrease (blue)
  in potato GAME9-Ox lines (see  and ). Values represent means±s.e. (n=3). Student''s
  t-test was used to assess whether the transgenic lines significantly differ from
  wild-type plants: *P value<0.05; **P value<0.01; ***P value<0.001.'
