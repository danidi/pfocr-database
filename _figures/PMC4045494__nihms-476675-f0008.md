caption: Schematic of the mechanism of action for XRT-induced NFκB changes in U937
  cells, in which XRT induced double-strand breaks, results in phosphorylation of
  ATM, and subsequent activation and phosphorylation of NEMO. ROS may also directly
  phosphorylate NEMO, but this would be a minor pathway.
