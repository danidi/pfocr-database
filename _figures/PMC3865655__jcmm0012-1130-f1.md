caption: Caveolin-1 is a highly versatile regulator of cell signaling. (A) At the
  molecular level, Caveolin-1 can modulate the flow of information through different
  cellular signaling pathways in distinct ways. Caveolin-1 acts as a scaffolding protein
  by binding to proteins involved in different signal transduction pathways. The caveolin-1
  scaffolding domain (CSD) mediates interaction with and inhibition of protein tyrosine
  kinases (PTKs), G-coupled receptors (GCRs), elements of the MAPK/ERK pathway, members
  of the protein kinase C (PKC) family and nitric oxide synthases (NOS), in particular
  the endothelial isoform (eNOS). Additional mechanisms to CSD-mediated inhibition
  of target proteins that result in loss of target protein activity, include proteasome-mediated
  degradation as has been described for the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS). Furthermore, inhibition of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription of
  genes such as cyclin D1 and surviving by poorly characterized pathways has been
  observed. The general consequence of these interactions is that caveolin-1 presence
  is associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and/or survival. (B) Alternatively,
  however, caveolin-1 has been implicated as a positive element in insulin receptor
  (IR) signalling and coupling of the integrin signalling to the MAPK/ERK pathway
  via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and src family kinases (SFKs). Such positive signalling
  downstream of caveolin-1 is frequently associated with phosphorylation on tyrosine
  14, whereby downstream positive effectors include Csk, Grb7. Alternatively, however,
  positive signalling via fyn downstream of integrin receptors is not known to require
  caveolin-1 phosphorylation. Rather, phosphorylation on tyrosine 14 is implicated
  as a negative regulator of rac-1 in conjunction with integrin signalling (see text
  for details).
