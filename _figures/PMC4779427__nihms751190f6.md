caption: Cardiac-specific pathways were examined for enrichment in differentially
  methylated genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analytics, revealing cardiac development
  to be physiological process most targeted by differential methylation after ISO.
  Interestingly, several known cardiac genes underwent altered regulation, allowing
  relationships amongst the signaling network to be mapped. Red nodes are differentially
  methylated only in BALB/cJ; green nodes only in BUB/BnJ; orange in both and white
  in neither. Solid lines indicated validated direct relationships; dashed lines,
  validated indirect interactions.
