caption: Signaling pathway diagram. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI)
  increases ROS production, which promotes the association of TXNIP with NLRP3 to
  activate the inflammasome. Because cardiomyocytes show low levels of the pyroptosis
  effector protein GSDMD, the apoptotic pathway becomes instead activated due to caspase-1-mediated
  degradation of the transcription factor GATA4 and consequent downregulation of the
  anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. EVs derived from ADSCs exposed to anoxic preconditioning
  exert significant cardioprotective effects against MIRI due to a distinct abundance
  of miRNAs targeting TXNIP. TXNIP downregulation impedes caspase-1 activation and
  GATA4 degradation, which therefore sustains Bcl-2 expression and prevents MIRI-induced
  apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.
