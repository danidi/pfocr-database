caption: 'The glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP) are tightly connected.
  The glucose entering the in cell membrane is rapidly phosphorylated by HK and converted
  to G-6-P. The G-6-P is metabolized either by the glycolytic pathway, generating
  pyruvate and lactate, or by PPP to produce NADPH. The F-6-P and G-3-P generated
  from the non-oxidative branch of PPP can enter glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. The
  NADPH is generated from oxidative PPP in cytosolic space and serine-driven one carbon
  metabolism in mitochondria. Arrows indicate irreversible enzymatic steps, and bi-directional
  arrows indicate interconverting reversible reactions determined by substrate concentration.

  step of glycolytic flux. G-6-P: glucose-6-phosphate, F-6-P: fructose-6-phosphate,
