caption: A model for early determination of Teff cell fate versus TFH cell fate controlled
  by TCR signal strength. During the early phase of differentiation into the TFH cell
  subset, naive CD4+ T cells require the cytokine IL-6 and costimulation (including
  ICOS), as well as strong TCR signals, to induce the expression of Bcl-6 (right).
  Although strong TCR signals induce abundant production of IL-2 and expression of
  the IL-2R complex, transient inhibition of STAT5 activation, presumably through
  the action of the Erk pathway, leads to the failure to express Blimp-1 and allows
  Bcl-6 expression induced by IL-6 and stimulation via ICOS and thereby results in
  differentiation into the TFH cell subset. In contrast, T cells that have received
  weak TCR signals under TFH cell–polarizing conditions can activate STAT5 in response
  to small amounts of IL-2, which induces Blimp-1 expression and suppresses Bcl-6
  expression and thereby results in ‘preferential’ differentiation into the Teff cell
  subset (left).

    in differentiation into the TFH cell subset. In contrast, T cells that have received
