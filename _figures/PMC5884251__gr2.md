caption: Increase in pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)/PKM1 ratio by phosphorylation of tyrosine
  residue directs to glycine production. (A) PKM2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation
  in contrast to constitutively active PKM1. Phosphorylation of tyrosine (Tyr) residue
  activates it whereas that of serine (Ser) residue inhibits it. (B) When PKM2/PKM1
  ratio increases, the metabolic pathway directs to pyruvate (continues glycolysis).
  When the ratio decreases, glycolysis is prevented and metabolic direction changes
  to serine followed by glycine. Glycine condensates with γ-glutamylcysteine for glutathione
  synthesis (see ).
