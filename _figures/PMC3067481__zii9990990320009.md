caption: Model for CsrABb regulation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway activation. We
  propose that CsrABb regulates the activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway via the
  modulation of the level of Pta (BB0589). During the stationary phase, CsrABb reaches
  the maximum level and acts as a repressor to turn off the expression of Pta, which
  results in less conversion of acetyl-phosphate to acetyl-CoA and an increase in
  the intracellular level of acetyl-phosphate. An increased intracellular level of
  acetyl-phosphate leads to the autophosphorylation of Rrp2, which in turn activates
  the RpoN-RpoS cascade as well as the downstream RpoS-dependent genes. In the absence
  of CsrABb, the level of Pta is dysregulated and results in an enhanced conversion
  of acetyl-phosphate to acetyl-CoA. A low intracellular level of acetyl-phosphate
  prevents the autophosphorylation of Rrp2 and the activation of its downstream regulatory
  pathway.

  description: Model for CsrABb regulation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway activation.
    We propose that CsrABb regulates the activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway

    CsrABb reaches the maximum level and acts as a repressor to turn off the expression

    In the absence of CsrABb, the level of Pta is dysregulated and results in an enhanced
