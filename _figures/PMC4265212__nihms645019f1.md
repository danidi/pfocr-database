caption: piRNA biogenesis pathways in Drosophila. In the primary processing pathway
  in the germline, the antisense piRNA precursor transcripts produced from piRNA clusters
  are possibly processed by Zuc, a putative endonuclease [,]. The resulting piRNA
  intermediates with a U at the first nucleotide position are preferentially selected
  and loaded onto Piwi or Aub (In ovarian somatic cells, only Piwi is expressed and
  involved in the primary piRNA pathway). Hsp83 and its hypothesized co-chaperone
  Shu are required for the piRNA loading [,]. The 3′ end of piRNA intermediates is
  further trimmed by an unknown enzyme [], and then methylated by the methyltransferase
  Hen1 [,] to mature the piRNAs and complete primary processing pathway. Aub and its
  bound mature antisense piRNAs can then enter the secondary processing pathway (the
  ping-pong cycle). piRNAs guide Aub to cleave the transposon transcripts and sense
  piRNA precursors produced from piRNA clusters [,]. The resulting products are then
  loaded onto Ago3 with the help of Shu and Hsp83 [,], and undergo 3′ end trimming
  and methylation to mature the sense piRNAs [–]. In turn, Ago3 and its associated
  mature sense piRNAs further cleave the target antisense piRNA precursors based on
  the sequence complementarity [,]. The resulting antisense piRNA intermediates are
  loaded onto Aub, with the assistance of Shu and Hsp83 [,], and further trimmed and
  methylated at the 3′ end as in the primary processing pathway [–]. The piRNA biogenesis
  pathways are well conserved across species such as C. elegans, fish, and mice (reviewed
  in []). Figure modified from [].
