caption: Crosstalk between UPR signalling pathways and lipogenesis. Phosphorylation
  of eIF2α and activation of the PERK pathway under high-fat diet-induced ER stress
  conditions allow for enhanced lipogenesis by inducing C/EBPα and decreasing Insig1
  protein translation which increases activation of SREBP. However, under severe or
  prolonged ER stress conditions, CHOP expression may lead to dysregulation of the
  C/EBPs. Similarly, high-carbohydrate-diet-induced ER stress conditions depend on
  XBP1 for expression of lipogenic genes and increase of C/EBPα activity, both of
  which promote lipogenesis. However, severe ER stress conditions, imposed by tunicamycin,
  lead to XBP1-mediated inhibition of lipogenic gene expression. Furthermore, both
  XBP1 and ATF6 are important for apolipoprotein B secretion from hepatocytes and
  activation of fatty acid oxidation pathways (PPARα, PGC1α) under such conditions.
  These pathways culminate in attenuation of lipogenesis and prevention of fatty liver
  disease under severe ER stress.
