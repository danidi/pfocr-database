caption: 'Model of Wnt and Hippo signaling network that either promotes or inhibits
  Wnt signaling through cytoplasmic and nuclear interactions of the two pathways.
  Major regulators of Hippo signaling are cell-cell adhesion via cadherin-based adherens
  junctions [e.g., through alpha-catenin (αCAT)] and via tight junctions to integrate
  cell density. Canonical Wnt signaling is initiated through binding of Wnt ligands
  to Frizzled receptors. In both Wnt/beta-catenin (BCAT) and Hippo/YAP1 pathways,
  phosphorylation (red circles) at specific sites by GSK3B and LATS1/2, respectively,
  target BCAT and YAP1 for BTRC-mediated degradation. Several signaling components
  are utilized to mediate Wnt-Hippo signaling coordination: e.g., BCAT, YAP1, WWC3
  (WWC), DVL, and AXIN interact with components of the other signaling pathway. Another
  shared component is the destruction pathway BTRC (also known as E3-ubiquitin ligase
  β-TrCP). YAP/WWTR1 can be essential components of the BCAT destruction complex by
  interacting with AXIN (). Thereby, Wnt signaling also can regulate Hippo/YAP1 signaling
  since YAP1 is sequestered through AXIN in this destruction complex and is released
  upon WNT signaling activation. Both BCAT degradation and YAP1 degradation can be
  mediated through BTRC. In the nucleus several complexes exist that contain components
  of both pathways suggesting cooperation of Wnt and Hippo signaling upon Wnt activation.'
