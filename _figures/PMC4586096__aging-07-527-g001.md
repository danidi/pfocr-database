caption: When a DNA replication fork hits a damaged site, e. g. crosslinked nucleotides,
  a response to replicative stress is triggered. The ubiquitination of PCNA is part
  of this response and enables translesion DNA synthesis. Our recently published results
  [] suggest that another ubiquitin ligase, G2E3, governs the cellular response to
  replicative stress as well, through activation of the ATR and Chk1 kinase pathway.
  Both ubiquitination events thus attenuate replicative stress and support cell survival.
