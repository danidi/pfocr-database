caption: 'Pathway analysis of the differentially-expressed proteins. (A) Pathway analysis
  of significantly altered metabolites in A549 cells compared with baseline. (B and
  C) Compound reaction networks of the metabolites and genes were visualized using
  Metscape: genes (circles), metabolic enzymes (squares) are presented as nodes, and
  relationships are presented as edges. Input genes are shown in blue, input metabolites
  are shown in red. The metabolite-gene association network was primarily related
  to malate-aspartate metabolism.'
