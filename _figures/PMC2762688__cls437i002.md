caption: AMPK plays an important role in whole-body energy homoeostasis as it regulates
  and interacts with different key metabolic pathways. Activation of AMPK, secondary
  to a change in the AMP/ATP ratio or activation by upstream kinases, such as CAMKK
  (CaMK kinase) and LKB1 leads to a switching on of energy-production pathways, such
  as glucose and lipid metabolism, and a turning off of energy-metabolic processes,
  such as protein synthesis, which is not required for immediate cell survival. (i)
  Fatty acid metabolism. AMPK activation leads to increased translocation of CD36,
  a fatty-acid-transport protein, which increases fatty acid (FA) flux into cells
  and subsequent uptake into mitochondria for β-oxidation. CPT-1 inhibits fatty acid
  influx and acts as a gatekeeper for the mitochondrial uptake of fatty acids. Activation
  of AMPK leads to the inhibition of ACC2, which normally converts acetyl-CoA into
  malonyl-CoA. The inhibitory effect of malonyl-CoA on CPT-1 is hence removed, leading
  to unopposed intake of fatty acids into mitochondria. Furthermore, phosphorylating
  and inactivation of ACC1 by AMPK activation reduces fatty acid synthesis and turns
  off the expression of lipogenic genes, such as fatty acid synthase. MCD, malonyl-CoA
  decarboxylase. (ii) Glucose metabolism. Activation of AMPK increases translocation
  and retention of GLUT-4 in the plasma membrane, as well as increased transcription
  of the GLUT-4 gene, leading to increased glucose uptake. It also enhances glycolysis
  via activation and phosphorylation of PFK-2. (iii) Protein metabolism. p70RSK (p70S6K)
  is a one of the key kinases involved in protein synthesis. mTOR activates p70RSK
  and leads to increased protein synthesis. When AMPK is activated, the activation
  of p70RSK is blocked as a result of the inhibition of mTOR. Activation of AMPK also
  results in phosphorylation and inactivation of eEF2, and subsequent inhibition of
  protein synthesis. eEF2K, eEF2 kinase.
