caption: (A) The 22 candidate genes identified from human osteoblasts were analyzed
  by IPA for network analysis. The network analysis revealed 10 out of 22 genes involved
  in a network associated with cancer, endocrine system disorders, organismal injury
  and abnormalities, and three of the four putative targets (KLF7, SOX11 and SVIP)
  by miR-204-5p and miR-335-3p predictions were involved. Genes colored in green indicated
  down-regulated expressions, and genes in red indicated up-regulated expressions
  in our dataset. (B) miR-204-5p was analyzed by IPA as a potential upstream regulator
  in our dataset. Using the overlay tool in IPA, molecules involved in the canonical
  osteoarthritis pathway, Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and differentiation of osteoblasts
  were marked in purple, where SOX11 was the molecule simultaneously involved.
