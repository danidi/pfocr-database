caption: A model of FosB-mediated regulation of ECM genes by mechanical signaling
  in bladder smooth muscle. Exposure to acute bladder wall distension in vivo causes
  an increase in expression of AP-1 family proteins. The expression of FosB and c-Jun,
  in particular, is enhanced, along with an increase in JNK-dependent phosphorylation
  (P) (and activation) of c-Jun. Jun∼FosB dimers formed subsequent to stretch bind
  to the promoters of ECM and matricellular genes, such as TNC and CTGF, increasing
  their mRNA and protein expression. TNC and CTGF are secreted into the ECM and trigger
  a pro-inflammatory and profibrotic response in the bladder wall. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase pathway inhibitor.
