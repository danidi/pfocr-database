caption: (A) In the canonical TGFβ signalling pathway, ligands signal through type
  I and II transmembrane protein kinase receptors. After TGFβ binding, type II receptor
  recruits and phosphorylates type I receptor, which in turn activates R-Smads. Phosphorylated
  R-Smads oligomerize with the co-Smad Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus where they
  interact with DNA and transcription factors to regulate the expression of target
  genes. (B) During epidermal terminal differentiation, TGFβ1 stimulation of keratinocytes
  induces the formation of a complex between activated Smad2/3 and IKKα. This complex
  accumulates in keratinocyte nuclei independently of the presence of Smad4 and controls
  the transcriptional activation of Mad1 and Ovol1 probably with the cooperation of
  other transcription factors such as IRF6. The Smad4-independent TGFβ–Smad2/3–IKKα
  axis is required for cell cycle exit and induction of terminal differentiation of
  keratinocytes.
