caption: 'Schematic representation of the LPS-induced, TLR 4-mediated NF-κB signaling
  pathway: (1) LPS form Gram-negative bacteria complex with LPS-binding protein (LBP)
  in the cells; (2) This LPS and LBP complex then binds to CD 14 receptor; (3) The
  LPS, LBP, and CD 14 complexes in turn interact with MD 2 and the transmembrane protein
  TLR 4; (4) This induces the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway; (5) Translocation
  of NF-κB to the nucleus induces the transcription of mRNA for several proteins such
  as inflammatory cytokines; (6) Translation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6.'
