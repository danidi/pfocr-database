caption: Resveratrol has multiple biological functions that are relevant for AD. Resveratrol
  acts on the neuropathological hallmarks of AD via multiple routes. Resveratrol inhibits
  the expression of MID1, thereby activating PP2A and dephosphorylating Tau. Additionally,
  MID1 induces the PP2A opposing kinase mTOR. Resveratrol induces degradation pathways
  by inhibiting mTOR signalling and inducing AMPK, thereby stimulating the clearance
  of Aβ. Resveratrol inhibits BACE1, resulting in decreased Aβ production. Resveratrol
  induces ADAM10, resulting in a preferential cleavage of APP via the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway.
