caption: Illustration shows the proposed mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and activation
  of the immune system. SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by attaching to a cell surface
  receptor (ACE2) and by utilizing a human enzyme called transmembrane serine protease
  2 (TMPRSS2). Once bound to the receptor, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes endocytosis and enters
  into the cell, along with the ACE2 receptor. This process reduces the number of
  ACE2 receptors on cells, leading to an increase of angiotensin II (AngII) levels
  in the blood. Angiotensin II triggers an inflammatory pathway involving NF-κB and
  interleukin 6–signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protein (IL-6-STAT3),
  particularly in nonimmune cells including endothelial and epithelial cells. This
  pathway forms a positive feedback cycle, named IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 AMP), resulting
  in its excessive activation and therefore the cytokine storm and ARDS. Part of this
  pathway involving NF-κB, IL-6-STAT3, or both is enhanced with age, which could be
  the reason why older patients are more at risk for death following COVID-19 diagnosis
  compared with other age groups. S1 = viral spike protein subunit 1, S2 = viral spike
  protein subunit 2,TNF-a = tumor necrosis factor-α.
