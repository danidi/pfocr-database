caption: Gene symbols are shown for the protein involved in the transport of cholesterol
  to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Star), the four enzymes that convert cholesterol
  to testosterone (Cyp11a1, Hsd3b6, Cyp17a1, and Hsd17b3) and the two enzymes that
  metabolize androgens, Srda1 and Dhrs9 in Leydig cells (). Only the Δ4 pathway for
  testosterone synthesis is shown because this is the predominant pathway in murine
  Leydig cells (). The up and down white arrows highlight genes that are up or down
  regulated in the Leydig cells of 50 day-old Mek1f/f;Mek2−/−;Cre+ mice.
