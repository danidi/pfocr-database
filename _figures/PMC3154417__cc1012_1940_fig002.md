caption: mTOR signaling pathway. mTORC1 and mTORC2 receive distinct upstream signals
  from both extracellular and intracellular stimuli and have different downstream
  targets. Notably, interconnection between mTORC1 and mTORC2 occurs at several levels.
  For example, one of the mTORC2 downstream targets, Akt, serves as an upstream regulator
  of mTORC1, whereas one important mTORC1 target ribosome acts as an activator of
  mTORC2. Most of the signaling components are involved in growth and aging, and lots
  of mutations have been found in human diseases such as cancer. For simplicity, only
  typical mTOR components are shown. See the main text for details.
