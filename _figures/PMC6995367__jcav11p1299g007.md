caption: Schematic representation of the p62- Keap1- Nrf2 pathway in ovarian cancer
  cells with the treatment of VK3. Our study provides evidence that p62 promotes Nrf2
  signaling through interacting with Keap1, which blocks VK3-induced apoptosis by
  inhibiting ROS production in SKOV3/DDP cells.
