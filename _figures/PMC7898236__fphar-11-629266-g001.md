caption: DNA damage response. DNA damage is caused by endogenous agent oxygen species
  (ROS) or exogenous agents such as UV light, ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapy
  agents. DNA damage response (DDR) is induced to deal with the lesions, including
  signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, cell-cycle checkpoints, induction
  of apoptosis, multiple DNA repair pathways as well as damage tolerance processes.
  DNA repair pathways include nuclear and mitochondrial DNA repair pathways. Direct
  repair, BER, MMR and recombinational repair (HR and NHEJ) are existence in both
  nuclear and mitochondrial repair systems. NER has been reported only appearance
  in nucleus, and the existence of TLS pathway in mitochondria is unknown. NDNA, nuclear
  DNA; MtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; BER, base excision repair; HR, homologous recombination
  repair; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; MMR, mismatch repair; TLS, translesion
  synthesis; NER, nucleotide excision repair.
