caption: A figure illustrating a link between the neurobiology of depression and the
  mechanisms through which ketamine produces its antidepressant effects.A. Two consequences
  of glial deficits or dysfunction on glutamate neurotransmission are illustrated.
  It is hypothesized that glial loss elevates glutamate levels (blue circles) in the
  extracellular space. On the left side, this figure depicts how glutamate overflow
  may stimulate inhibitory presynaptic mGluR2 receptors, located at the periphery
  of these glutamate synapses. Through this mechanism, glial loss may depress glutamate
  neurotransmission, compromising functional connectivity. The right side of this
  figure shows elevated extracellular glutamate causing overstimulation of extrasynaptic
  NMDA receptors, particularly those containing the GluN2B subunit. Through this mechanism,
  glial loss may activate a signaling cascade responsible for loss of dendritic spines
  and dendritic regression, contributing to impaired functional connectivity.B. Ketamine
  is thought to produce its antidepressant effects by disinhibiting the release of
  glutamate by the presynaptic neuron, increasing the stimulation of the “go” pathway,
  i.e., postsynaptic AMPA receptors and signaling via the Akt/mTOR pathway (). In
  addition, it blocks extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, reducing signaling via ElF2, which
  suppresses BDNF levels (). Although other ketamine effects may contribute in important
  ways to its antidepressant effects, these converging effects of ketamine may contribute
  to its capacity to rapidly increase the number of dendritic spines and to restore
  aspects of functional connectivity.
