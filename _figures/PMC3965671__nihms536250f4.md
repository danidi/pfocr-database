caption: Immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The two major forms
  of IBD, Crohn’s disease (CD; left panel) and ulcerative colitis (UC; right panel),
  have distinct patterns of tissue involvement and immunopathogenic bases. However,
  recent GWAS data have identified shared Th17 pathway attributes in both (see ),
  and both share abnormal responses to the enteric microbiota. Although disease pathogenesis
  is complex and there appear to be different immune abnormalities in individual patients,
  CD is associated with defects in autophagy (an evolutionarily conserved mechanism
  to deliver intracellular microbes or cytoplasmic organelles to the lysosomal compartment),
  bacterial sensing and excessive Th17 pathway activation. UC, on the other hand,
  has been associated with excessive IL-13, thought to be produced by invariant NKT
  cells, as well as defects in epithelial barrier integrity and excessive Th17 pathway
  activation.
