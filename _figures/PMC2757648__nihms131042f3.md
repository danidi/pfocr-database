caption: 'Interferon response genes are coordinately upregulated relative to the rs17445836[G]
  allele of IRF8. Using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software suite, we illustrate
  the network of genes in the “interferon signaling pathway” whose expression is found
  to be correlated with the rs17445836[G] allele in untreated MS subjects. The diagram
  highlights those genes in this pathway whose expression are upregulated (red) in
  the presence of the rs17445836[G] allele. The magnitude of each gene’s association
  is reflected by the intensity of the color, with brighter red indicating a stronger
  correlation between rs17445836[G] and RNA expression. A white color denotes a gene
  found in the associated pathway but which failed to meet a nominal P < 0.05 threshold
  for association of its RNA expression with rs17445836[G]. The shapes of each gene
  symbol denote the class of that gene as defined by the Ingenuity Pathways application:
  horizontal oval, transcription regulator; vertical oval, transmembrane receptor;
  rectangle, G protein–coupled receptor; horizontal diamond, peptidase; vertical diamond,
  enzyme; triangle, kinase; square, cytokine; circle, other.'
