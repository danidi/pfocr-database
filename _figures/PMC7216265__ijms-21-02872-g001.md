caption: Canonical glutaminolysis pathway. Glutamine is captured in the outer cell
  membrane through different amino acid transporters such as solute carrier (SLC)1A3,
  alanine, serine, cysteine, and glutamate transporter (ASCT2/SLC1A5), L-type amino
  acid transporter 1 (LAT1), sodium-neutral amino acid transporters (SNATs), sodium-independent
  cysteine–glutamate antiporter (xCT) or SLC7A3. Once in the mitochondria, glutamine
  is converted to glutamate through glutaminase 1 and glutaminase 2 (GLS, GLS2); inversely,
  glutamine synthetase (GS) can generate glutamine from glutamate. Glutamate dehydrogenase
  (GDH) catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate (α-kG) and ammonia.
  Additionally, α-kG can also be obtained from the isocitrate that is derived from
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA); this reaction is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase
  2 (IDH2), and isocitrate is previously obtained from citrate by the activity of
  aconitase 2 (ACO2). In the cytoplasm, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mediates
  the conversion of α-kG to isocitrate, then isocitrate is transformed into citrate
  through aconitase 1 (ACO1), which, in turn, is converted to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)
  via adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase (ACLY), finally producing fatty acids
  through the activity of fatty acid synthase (FASN). Moreover, α-kG is generated
  from oxaloacetate (OAA) by glutamate–oxaloacetate transaminases 1 and 2 (GOT1 and
  GOT2) in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively. Then, cytoplasmic OAA is
  converted to malate by malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1), and further to pyruvate and
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) by malic enzyme 1 (ME1). Meanwhile,
  mitochondrial OAA is formed from malate by malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2). Additionally,
  glutamate is transformed to glutamic-γ-semialdehyde (GSA) by delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  synthase (P5CS), which is interconverted to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) and turned
  into proline through pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR); conversely, proline
  is oxidized to P5C by proline–dehydrogenase/proline–oxidase (PRODH/POX) impacting
  the production of H2O or O−2. Moreover, p53 and c-Myc promote the transcription
  of several proteins related to glutamine metabolism.
