caption: PIKKs-related signaling pathway in the aging brain. There are three types
  of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinases (PIKKs) DNA-dependent protein
  kinase including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA protein kinase catalytic
  subunit (DNA-PKcs) and taxia-telangiectasia and Rad-3-related (ATR). ATM can be
  activated by double-strand breaks (DSB) and it phosphorylates a multitude of substrates,
  including nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), H2A histone family member X (H2AX),
  mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1), p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1),
  breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) and MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN).
  As an interactor of ATM, ATMIN plays important role in its response to oxidative
  stress and aging related DNA damage. DNA-PKcs is required to form an active DNA-PK
  complex with Ku70/80. ATR is activated by single-strand breaks (SSB) and replication
  arrest. In aging and AD brain, all these DNA damage response pathways have been
  shown to progressively decline.
