caption: Biogenesis of miRNA. miRNAs are processed through the canonical pathway or
  mirtron pathway into pre-miRNA. After exporting the pre-miRNA from the nucleus to
  the cytoplasm, miRNA–miRNA* duplexes are formed after cleavage by Dicer. From this
  duplex, only the guide strand is loaded into the RISC complex, forming miRISC. This
  complex will cause translational repression or mRNA cleavage. DGCR DiGeorge syndrome
  critical region, Pre-miRNA Precursor miRNA, Pri-miRNA Primary miRNA, RISC RNA-induced
  silencing complex
