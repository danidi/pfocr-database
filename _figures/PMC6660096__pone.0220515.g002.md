caption: 'In presence of nitrogen sources the EGO complex is activated, stimulating
  the activation of TORC1, which phosphorylates its two proximal targets: Sch9 and
  phosphatase complex. The phosphorylation of Sch9 implies the expression of genes
  related to ribosomal proteins and ribosomal biogenesis. The phosphorylation of the
  phosphatase complex promotes its inactivation and the repression of genes related
  with nitrogen metabolism (RTG, NCR and GAAC) and stress response. The genes selected
  in this study are in bold.'
