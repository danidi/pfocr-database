caption: Model of KOR1 Transport Regulation.Upon synthesis and insertion into the
  ER, KOR1 undergoes N-glycan–assisted luminal folding and ERQC; but in case KOR1
  fails to fold correctly (such as KOR1∆all), the polypeptide is targeted to the TP
  for vacuolar degradation. After N-glycan maturation in the GA, folded KOR1 is transported
  to the TGN, and PM. Upon delivery to the PM, some KOR1 return to the TGN via an
  endocytotic pathway that is mediated by the LL motif and AP-2 complex. Internalized
  KOR1 is quality checked at the TGN (TGN sorting) and redirected to the PM, which
  is facilitated by the P-motif, or sorted to the TP for degradation. WT, the wild
  type.
