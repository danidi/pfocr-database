caption: CFTR is essential for the occurrence of bicarbonate-dependent capacitation
  events. In human sperm a fast and transient HCO3− influx occurs when sperm encounter
  high extracellular bicarbonate concentration in the seminal plasma at ejaculation.
  This transient raise in HCO3− concentration may stimulate the ADCY10, resulting
  in cAMP production and in an increase in the basal PKA activity to phosphorylate
  and activate CFTR (1). The sustained HCO3− (2) responsible of PKA activation or
  pHi changes could be transported either directly by CFTR or indirectly, by providing
  a recycling pathway for Cl−/HCO3− cotransporters associated with this channel (3).
  CFTR modulation of Em could be explained by its influence on HCO3− transport, or
  by its association with other transporters like ENaC (3). Because pHi, Em and CFTR
  activity depend on PKA, we propose a connecting-loop between PKA and CFTR activity
  in human sperm.
