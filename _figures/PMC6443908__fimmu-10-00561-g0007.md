caption: The APR signaling pathway is associated with ozone exposure and bacterial
  infection. A total of 36 proteins were identified in this study and were used for
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The canonical “APR signaling” pathway was found to be
  associated with these proteins (p < 4.17E-11). An example of the comparison among
  SP-A genotypes is shown for the SP-A2M_FA vs. KOM_FA comparison where proteins with
  increases in (>25%) expression are shown in red, proteins with decreases (>-25%)
  are shown in green, and proteins with changes <25% are shown in gray. ERK1/2 and
  NF-IL6 in the pathway are indicated with red arrows.
