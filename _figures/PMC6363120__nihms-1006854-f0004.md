caption: Pioneering studies of the mechanism of nickel-catalyzed cross-couplings.
  (a) Kochi’s experiments demonstrated that in nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions
  a Ni(III) intermediate likely undergoes reductive elimination to generate the product.
  (b) The catalytic cycle drawn by Kumada provides sufficient detail to understand
  the pathway for the nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction and focuses on intermediates
  for which there is experimental evidence.
