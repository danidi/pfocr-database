caption: 'Signaling pathways involving the MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1. (A) Diagram of Fus3
  and Kss1 signaling pathways. Either MAPK can induce transcription of mating genes
  in response to mating pheromones, which requires the scaffold protein Ste5 and the
  downstream transcription factor Ste12. Separately, Kss1 can induce transcription
  of filamentation genes in response to nutrient limitation, which requires a heterodimer
  of Ste12 with Tec1. In each pathway, the MAPK promotes transcription by phosphorylating
  and displacing the repressor proteins Dig1 and Dig2 from the transcription factor.
  PRE, pheromone response element; FRE, filamentation response element. (B) Fus3 has
  two negative effects that reduce the ability of Kss1 to activate filamentation pathway
  signaling: it triggers negative feedback that reduces activation of both MAPKs,
  and it phosphorylates Tec1, which is thus marked for degradation. (C) The Ste5-VASP
  mutation disrupts binding to Ste7, which reduces propagation of signal through the
  kinase cascade (as indicated by gray dashed arrows).'
