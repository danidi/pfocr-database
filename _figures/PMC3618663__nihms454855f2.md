caption: Inhibition of miR-33 in the liver increases the expression of ABCA1, which
  in turn enhances HDL biogenesis and the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Anti-sense
  oligonucleotides targeting miR-33 can also reach plaque macrophages, to increase
  expression of ABCA1, which promotes cholesterol efflux from these lesional cells.
  The increase in HDL biogenesis combined with increased cholesterol efflux from macrophages
  enhances reverse cholesterol transport to the liver for uptake by SR-BI and excretion.
  These combined effects of anti-miR-33 treatment have been shown to lead to a reduction
  in atherosclerotic plaque burden. In addition to changes in ABCA1, anti-miR-33 causes
  derepression of miR-33 target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and downregulates
  the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis via repression of SREBP-1.
  By increasing fatty acid oxidation and decreasing fatty acid synthesis, anti-miR-33
  leads to decreased triglyceride production by the liver.
