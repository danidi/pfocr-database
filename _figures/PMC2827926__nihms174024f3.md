caption: The refined scheme of the glyoxylate regeneration cycle, now termed ethylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway (right), and its connection to the serine cycle (left). Gene names are shown
  in blue. Each of these genes has been mutated in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1
  and the mutant phenotypes analyzed. The gene for succinyl-CoA hydrolase remains
  unknown.
