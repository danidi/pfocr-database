caption: Our proposed model for two distinct pathways in ICL-induced ATR signaling.
  RPA complex accumulates on exposed ssDNA region surrounding the ICL (middle). RPA-ATRIP
  binding, which is facilitated by the FA core complex, promotes ATR recruitment.
  In the left side of the pathway, which is dependent on the FA core complex but not
  on the RAD17-TOPBP1 pathway, FANCI is phosphorylated, triggering FANCD2 monoubiquitination.
  In the right side, CHK1 is phosphorylated depending on the RAD17-TOPBP1 pathway,
  but the FA core complex is largely dispensable for the CHK1 activation.
