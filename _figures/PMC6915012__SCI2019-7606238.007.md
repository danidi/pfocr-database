caption: Schematic representation of the PAME-induced G2/M arrest in hBM-MSCs. PAME
  decreased the expression of Mdm2, which in turn reduced the degradation of p53,
  subsequently upregulating the expression of Cdk1 and cyclin B1 through suppression
  of the p21 protein level, and eventually caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase.
