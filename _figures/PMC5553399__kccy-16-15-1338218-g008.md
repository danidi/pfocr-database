caption: Proposed mechanism for G2 phase-specific nuclear export of CENP-F. (A) During
  most of interphase, the cNLS has a strong affinity toward its receptor karyopherin
  α, which likely correlates with high nuclear import rates, resulting in the observed
  nuclear localization of CENP-F. While it is clear that an active nuclear export
  pathway for CENP-F exists, the nuclear export receptor and the rate of nuclear export
  during the cell cycle remains to be established. (B) In G2 phase, Cdk1 would become
  active and phosphorylate the cNLS of CENP-F. Phosphorylation would weaken the interaction
  of CENP-F and karyopherin α, thereby slowing down nuclear import. CENP-F would then
  be exported from the nucleus to the cytosol in G2 phase as the nuclear export pathway
  would still be active and nuclear export rates would now dominate over nuclear import
  rates. (C) Nup133/CENP-F pathway for dynein recruitment to the cell nucleus. In
  G2 phase, CENP-F is recruited to the nucleus by nuclear pore protein Nup133. CENP-F
  in turn recruits dynein to the nucleus via adaptor proteins NudE/NudEL. This initiates
  G2 phase-specific transport of the cell nucleus. This pathway is regulated by Cdk1,
  which controls G2 phase-specific nuclear export of CENP-F (red arrow). (D) Specifically
  in G2 phase, the cell nucleus is recognized as cargo for dynein-dependent transport
  toward the minus end of microtubules.
