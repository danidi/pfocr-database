caption: 'Pathogeny of thrombosis in SARS-Cov-2 infection. Binding of SARS-Cov-2 with
  the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on endothelium surface induces
  2 pathways: (A) Activation of endothelium infiltrated by leukocytes and damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) leads to immunothrombosis with cytokine storm, leukocyte
  and platelet recruitment, and activation of coagulation extrinsic pathway followed
  by intrinsic pathway[]; (B) A rise of the angiotensin II level, pro inflammatory
  hormone, caused by a decrease of conversion, and increased synthesis due to ACE1
  receptor shedding.[] The final goal is overproduction of fibrin and thrombosis,
  physiologic fibrinolysis leading to D-Dimer production. -: inhibition, a = activated,
