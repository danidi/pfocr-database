caption: The extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. (A) Depiction of the extrinsic
  apoptotic signaling pathway. The four major apoptosis-inducing death receptors are
  activated when Fas ligand (FasL) activates Fas, TRAIL activates DR4 or DR5, or TNF
  activates TNF-R1 (left inset). The binding of the ligand to the death receptor induces
  trimerization of the receptor which produces a conformation that recruits FADD and
  procaspase-8 to the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, altogether forming a protein
  complex known as the DISC. Within the DISC, caspase-8 is activated by auto-cleavage.
  In type I cells, sufficient active caspase-8 is generated to directly activate caspase-3
  to carry out the apoptotic program. In type II cells, activation of caspase-8 leads
  to activation of caspase-3 indirectly through cleavage and activation of Bid, forming
  tBid, which activates the mitochondrial apoptotic mechanisms that are involved in
  the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. (B) GSK3 inhibits the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
  by impairing transduction of the signal from activated death receptors to the activation
  of caspase-8.
