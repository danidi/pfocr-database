caption: Sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) treatment reproduces profibrotic effects of
  transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) through the enhancement of the endogenous TGF-β
  ligand/receptor signaling (Bu and Trojanowska, unpublished data), but the specific
  details of this process remain to be clarified. In contrast, dihydrosphingosine-1
  phosphate (dhS1P) suppresses TGF-β signaling through the TGF-β receptor-independent,
  PTEN-dependent mechanism []. DhS1P treatment triggers rapid phosphorylation of PTEN
  and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, in which PTEN facilitates Smad2/3
  dephosphorylation by stabilizing Smad1/2 phosphatase, PPM1A. Interestingly, both
  sphingolipid mediators utilize the same receptor, S1P1, suggesting that additional,
  presently unknown components of these pathways contribute to the distinct postreceptor
  signaling.
