caption: SPMs inhibitory mechanisms have been evidenced with decrease secretion of
  pro-IL-1ß and pro-IL-18, and likewise decreased IL-1ß and IL-18 (via diminished
  caspase activity). SPMs have also been shown to decrease NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  via suppressed lipid raft redox and decreased ROS generation, in addition to preventing
  the assembly of the inflammasome via hindering oligomerization of ASC. On a proinflammatory
  note, caspase-1 can diminish SPM synthesis. ATG inhibitory mechanisms against NLRP3
  inflammasome activation have been evidenced with decreased ROS generation (noted
  via SIRT3), increased cholesterol efflux, and inhibited anion flux. Additionally,
  an assembled NLRP3 inflammasome complex can be ubiquitinated and degraded via autophagic
  mechanisms, and thereby decrease caspase 1 activity to diminish IL-1ß and IL-18
  release. On a proinflammatory note, defective autophagy promotes a hyperactive response
  to PAMP/DAMPs and has been noted with cholesterol crystal substrate. Together, it
  is quite possible both SPMs and ATG offer routes to address atherosclerosis and
  atherothrombosis via these mechanisms described.
