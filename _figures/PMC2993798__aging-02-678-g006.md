caption: A conserved insulin signaling pathway in C. elegans regulates numerous functions
  including stress response, metabolism, dauer formation, and reproductive development
  by restricting the nuclear localization of the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor
  upon nutrient availability []. Upon ligand binding (top panel), the insulin-like
  receptor DAF-2 activates the AGE-1 PI3 kinase that facilitates the activation of
  PDK-1 and AKT-1. AKT-1-mediated phosphorylation sequesters DAF-16 in the cytoplasm.
  In the absence of PI3K/AKT signaling (bottom panel) DAF-16 enters the nucleus and
  regulates the expression of target genes to mediate numerous DAF-16 dependent processes,
  including those listed.
