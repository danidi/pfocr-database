caption: 'Wwox-partner protein interactions in signal pathways are affected by absence
  or reduction of Wwox expression. Wwox, via its first WW domain, binds PPxY domain-containing
  proteins and sequesters them in the cytoplasm, suppressing their transcriptional
  transactivation functions. Examples of these proteins are Ap2α/γ, p73, ICD of ErbB4
  and juxtamembrane fragments of Met (CTF). Moreover, Wwox competes with other WW
  domain-containing proteins for binding to these interactor proteins; for example,
  Wwox outcompetes Yap for binding to the ErbB4 ICD and inhibits the Yap-induced ICD
  activity. In addition to sequestering the active ErbB4 and Met fragments, Wwox binds
  and stabilizes the full-length forms of these proteins. In osteoblasts and probably
  in some solid cancer cells, Wwox associates with chromatin-bound Runx2 and suppresses
  its transactivation function. Wwox also regulates the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway
  by preventing the nuclear import of the Dvl protein. In response to UV stress, the
  Wwox–Jun complex is significantly enhanced. This sequesters Jun in the cytoplasm,
  suppressing its transcriptional activity mediated through Jnk activation. According
  to work in Chang’s laboratory, Jnk1 may also bind to murine Wwox, blocking cell-cycle
  progression and inhibiting Wwox-mediated cell death []. Wwox physically interacts
  with ezrin after PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ezrin, facilitating proton pump
  H,K-ATPase recruitment to apical membrane during the parietal cell activation. It
  is likely that there is tissue specificity of individual pathways in signaling growth,
  stasis, cell or substrate interaction, metabolic activity, differentiation or cell
  death, with dependence on WW domain networks active in particular organs or contexts.CKI:
