caption: Targeting molecules in astrocytes for dopaminergic neuroprotection. Upregulation
  of astrocytic xCT increases GSH synthesis leading to neuroprotection against oxidative
  stress. GLT-1 plays an important role in inhibiting glutamate toxicity. GLT-1 and
  xCT cooperate for continuous cystine uptake followed by GSH synthesis. MTs bind
  Cu with a high affinity and inhibit Cu-induced α-synuclein aggregation. The stimulation
  of 5-HT1A receptor on astrocytes activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway followed by
  the upregulation of antioxidants including GSH-related molecules and MTs. Astrocytes
  engulf the aggregated α-synuclein and damaged mitochondria released from neuronal
  cells and degrade these neuronal waste via the proteasome and autophagy pathways.
