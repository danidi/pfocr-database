caption: 'Contribution of type III effectors to proteasome-dependent protein degradation.
  (A) Model of the proteasome-dependent protein degradation pathway. Ubiquitin (Ub)
  is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and transferred to the ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme (E2), which interacts with the ubiquitin ligase (E3). E3 ubiquitin ligases
  are divided into several classes according to the presence of a HECT, RING or U-box
  domain. RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases can be part of a multimeric
  protein complex such as the SCF complex, which consists of a RING-box protein, the
  molecular scaffold protein cullin, an Arabidopsis SKP1-like protein (ASK1) and an
  F-box protein, which binds the substrate of the E3 ligase. E3 enzymes mediate the
  transfer of ubiquitin molecules to the substrate, thus leading to the formation
  of poly-ubiquitin chains, which allow the targeting of proteins to the proteasome.
  The proteasome consists of two 19S regulatory and a 20S core particle and catalyzes
  the unfolding and degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins. (B) Domain structure
  of the effector protein AvrPtoB from P. syringae. The regions of AvrPtoB, which
  provide binding sites for the AvrPtoB interaction partners Pto, Bti9, Fen, FLS2
  and BAK1, are indicated. References: (1) Dong et al. ; (2) Xiao et al. ; (3) Mathieu,

  of substrates of the SCF complex remains to be demonstrated. (F) XopJ from Xanthomonas
