caption: 'The text above each map indicates the pathway responsible for the phenotypic
  difference, the phenotype with which the strategy is associated, and the gene deletion
  for which the phenotype occurs. (A–B) Schematic views of the flux distributions
  associated with the indicated gene deletion set. Metabolites are represented in
  plain text. Metabolic transformations are indicated via arrows, with thicker arrows
  indicating higher flux. In some instances, multiple transformations are combined
  into a single dashed arrow or lumped into a subsystem. Subsystems are indicated
  by plain text enclosed in a grey rectangle. Fluxes active in the iAF1260 network
  are in red, fluxes active in the iJR904 network are in blue, and inactive fluxes
  are in grey. If gene (reaction) deletions occur in the fermentation pathway, they
  are indicated by black ‘X’s. Fluxes crossing the dashed boundary indicate transport
  to the extracellular environment. Metabolite abbreviations: 12 ppd, 1,2-propanediol;
  2aobut, L-2-Amino-3-oxobutanoate; actp, acetyl phosphate; athr, allo-threonine.
  All other abbreviations match those used in the iSyp611 metabolic model (see ).'
