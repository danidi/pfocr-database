caption: NOD-like receptors control various forms of PCD in mammals and filamentous
  fungi. NLRP3 and APAF1, given as examples, control pyroptosis and apoptosis, respectively.
  NLRP3 activity is triggered by various DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns),
  which leads to highly inflammatory pyroptotic cell death (Jones et al., ). APAF1
  controls the intrinsic apoptotic cell death pathway in mammals (Shakeri et al.,
  ). APAF1 is activated by cytochrome C, released from damaged mitochondria. Three
  examples are given of fungal NOD-like receptors controlling PCD. HET-E controls
  the HI PCD reaction in the ascomycete P. anserina. PCD is triggered by incompatible
  allelic variants of HET-C, a glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP). The downstream
  signaling pathway of HET-E activation and specific mechanism of cell death are currently
  unclear. Some fungal NLRs (e.g., NWD2 of P. anserina or PNT1 of Chaetomium globosum)
  use short amyloid motifs (R0 or PP (pseudo-palindromic) respectively) to induce
  a cell death reaction that has been linked to necroptosis—inflammatory PCD in metazoans
  (Loquet and Saupe, ). The molecular cues and events activating NWD2 and PNT1 are
  not yet identified.
