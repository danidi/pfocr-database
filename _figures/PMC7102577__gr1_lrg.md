caption: Overview of Enterovirus’ subversion of autophagy pathway. In enterovirus
  infections, the life cycle of enterovirus begins with recognition and binding to
  receptors on plasma membrane, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis which results
  in virus uncoating and release of viral genome RNA (vRNA) into cytoplasm induced
  by pH change in endosomal compartment. The vRNA was primarily used as mRNA template
  to translate and synthesis viral proteins which was required for subsequent genome
  replication. It is reported that poliovirus utilizes ULK1 complex and CVB3 requires
  Vps34 complex to initiate autophagy. EV-A71, CVB3 and EV-D68 were beneficial from
  virus-induced formation of autophagosomes to promote viral genome replication. During
  late autophagy, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes to degrade
  cargos engulfed by autophagosomes. However, in CVB3 and EV-D68 infection, viral
  protease 3C cleaves SNAP29, leading to blockage of auto-lysosome formation and autophagic
  flux. Poliovirus and CVB3 were capable of recruiting either proLC3 or LC3-I to replication
  organelles (ROs) (single-membrane or double-membrane) to promote viral replication
  in an autophagy-independent manner. Besides, CVB3 and EV-D68 manipulate extracellular
  membrane vesicles (EMVs) to promote non-lytic release of infectious progeny virions.
  3-MA is an early-stage autophagy inhibitor that blocked PI3K3C/Vps34, while bafilomycin
  A1 is a late-stage autophagy inhibitor that inhibit fusion of autophagosome with
  lysosome.
