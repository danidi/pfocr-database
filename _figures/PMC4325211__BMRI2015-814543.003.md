caption: Placental oxidative stress triggers the expression of transcription factors
  to regulate angiogenesis and trophoblast invasion. Mitochondria within the placenta
  (depicted in pale pink) are a major producer of ROS, such as O2−• which can cause
  a state of oxidative stress (illustrated in yellow). Oxidative stress within the
  placenta can act as a signaling pathway to influence the expression of transcription
  factors, such as KLF8, Ets-1, NFκB, Sp1, Sp3, STAT-3, and Nrf2 (depicted by the
  grey arrows). These transcription factors regulate the expression and activity of
  proteins related to angiogenesis and trophoblast invasion (as shown by the lines
  linking to the invasion and angiogenesis panels).
