caption: 'Ingenuity pathway network analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs. Depicting
  relationships among differentially expressed miRNAs in prostate cancer tissue compared
  with adjacent benign tissue (fold change ≥ 2, P< 0.05, virus miRNAs were excluded).
  Intensity of the red color indicates the degree of up-regulation. Intensity of the
  green color indicates the degree of down-regulation. Nodes are displayed using various
  shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product. Edges are displayed
  with various labels that describe the nature of relationship between the nodes:
  ___ represents direct relationship; ------- represents indirect relationship; →represents
  acts on.'
