caption: IPA Network. 119 unique probe sets were obtained through correlational analysis
  by coding UCMS BALB/cJ animals as group one and all other animals as group 2 at
  the stringent |R|>0.8 cut-off level. The results were uploaded on Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis and a significant network centred on the Nfkb gene hub was returned. The
  Nfkb has been associated with proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta which
  have been implicated in the cellular and behavioral effects of stress response and
  in mood disorders. Regulation of Nfkb has further been suggested to modulate hippocampal
  neurogenesis. Nodes on the diagram color coded represent reference molecules, with
  red indicating a positive correlation value and green indicating a negative correlation
  value.
