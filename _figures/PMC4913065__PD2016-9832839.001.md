caption: 'A simplified view of the functional anatomy of the basal ganglia (BG). The
  main input and output connections and the basic internal circuitry of the BG are
  shown. Here are represented the direct pathway (panel (a)), the indirect pathway
  (panel (b)), and the alteration of the balance between the direct and indirect pathways
  in Parkinson''s disease (panel (c)). Blue arrows show the excitatory glutamatergic
  pathways, red arrows indicate the inhibitory GABAergic pathways, and green arrows
  mark the dopaminergic pathway. CMA: cingulate motor area; D1: dopamine D1 receptor;
  D2: dopamine D2 receptor; GPe: external segment of the globus pallidus; GPi: internal
  segment of the globus pallidus; MC: primary motor cortex; PMC: premotor cortex;
  SMA: supplementary motor area; SNc: substantia nigra pars compacta; SNr: substantia
  nigra pars reticulata; STN: subthalamic nucleus; VA/VL: ventral anterior/ventrolateral
  thalamic nuclei.'
