caption: Caveolins negatively regulate signaling along the p42/44 MAPK cascade. Caveolae
  have been implicated in signaling through the p42/44 MAPK pathway. Caveolin-1 can
  inhibit signal transduction from the p42/44 MAPK cascade both in vitro and in vivo
  by acting as a natural endogenous inhibitor of EGF-R, MEK, and ERK (). Conversely,
  when NIH 3T3 cells are used, antisense-mediated reductions in caveolin-1 protein
  expression are sufficient to constitutively activate the p42/44 MAPK cascade and
  drive oncogenic transformation (). In normal NIH 3T3 cells, caveolin-1 expression
  levels are downregulated in rapidly dividing cells and dramatically upregulated
  at confluency. Thus, upregulation of caveolin-1 expression levels may be important
  in mediating normal contact inhibition and in negatively regulating the activation
  state of the p42/44 MAPK cascade. In accordance with these findings, the caveolin-1
  gene is localized to a suspected tumor suppressor locus that is deleted in many
  forms of human cancer (7q31.1/D7S 522 locus) (, ).

  description: Caveolins negatively regulate signaling along the p42/44 MAPK cascade.
    Caveolae have been implicated in signaling through the p42/44 MAPK pathway. Caveolin-1
    can inhibit signal transduction from the p42/44 MAPK cascade both in vitro and
    in vivo by acting as a natural endogenous inhibitor of EGF-R, MEK, and ERK ().
    Conversely, when NIH 3T3 cells are used, antisense-mediated reductions in caveolin-1
    protein expression are sufficient to constitutively activate the p42/44 MAPK cascade
    and drive oncogenic transformation (). In normal NIH 3T3 cells, caveolin-1 expression
    levels are downregulated in rapidly dividing cells and dramatically upregulated
    at confluency. Thus, upregulation of caveolin-1 expression levels may be important
    in mediating normal contact inhibition and in negatively regulating the activation
    state of the p42/44 MAPK cascade. In accordance with these findings, the caveolin-1
    gene is localized to a suspected tumor suppressor locus that is deleted in many
    forms of human cancer (7q31.1/D7S 522 locus) (, ).
