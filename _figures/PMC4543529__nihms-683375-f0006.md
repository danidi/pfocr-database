caption: In a mouse model of chemical-induced liver fibrosis Gas6/Axl signaling is
  induced. Increased Gas6 extracellular levels stimulate Axl activation in HSCs leading
  to HSC proliferation and phenotypic transformation via AKT phosphorylation and NF-κB
  nuclear translocation. Axl genetic deficiency (Axl KO mice) or Axl inhibition by
  BGB324 blocks fibrogenesis, effectively inhibiting Gas6-induced HSC activation in
  vitro and reducing experimental liver fibrosis in vivo by eliminating activated
  HSCs. Therefore, small molecule inhibitors of Axl may be interesting compounds for
  the medical treatment of chronic liver fibrosis and prevention of HCC development.
