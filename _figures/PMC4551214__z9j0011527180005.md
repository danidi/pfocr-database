caption: 'Potential mechanisms of interaction involving GRK5 and NFκB pathway. A:
  NFκB-IκBα complex can shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus. Alternatively, IκBα
  can be phosphorylated by IκBα-kinase leading to its degradation. Free NFκB can then
  enter the nucleus and activate transcription. GRK5 RH domain can bind to IκBα COOH
  terminus. Upregulation of GRK5 leads to the increase of nuclear IκBα, which can
  in turn inhibit NFκB and NFκB-driven transcription. B: alternatively, upregulation
  of GRK5 has been proposed to upregulate NFκB proteins (p50 and p65). This upregulation
  in NFκB would lead to its translocation to the nucleus and activation of gene transcription.
  In addition, NFκB can also activate the transcription of GRK5.'
