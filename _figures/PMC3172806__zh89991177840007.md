caption: A model of pericyte-induced EC survival signaling. Endothelial cells and
  pericytes communicate through the reciprocal exchange of growth factors. PDGF-BB
  produced by ECs acts to recruit pericytes along growing vascular sprouts. In turn,
  pericytes confer survival advantage to ECs through PDGF-dependent secretion of vitronectin,
  (1) which through an integrin αv (2) and NF-κB (3) mediated signaling pathway results
  in up-regulation of intracrine VEGF-A signaling (4) and Bcl-w expression. (5) Previously
  described survival factors induced by the paracrine action of pericyte- or tumor
  cell-derived VEGF-A, such as survivin, Bcl-2, and XIAP, are presumably sensitive
  to the action of both intra- and extra-cellularly acting VEGFR inhibitors (AG-028262
  and sFlt1, respectively), whereas the pericyte-induced autocrine signaling by VEGF-A
  is only sensitive to intra-cellularly acting inhibitors.
