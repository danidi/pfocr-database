caption: The exact mechanism of PAI-1-regulated apoptosis is not clear and several
  different scenarios are possible. The uPA/uPAR/PAI-1 complex (1) in the presence
  of LRP is endocytosed (2). Intracellular PAI-1 can complex with caspase-3 leading
  to its inactivation promoting an anti-apoptotic effect (3), while uPAR and LRP are
  recycled to the cell surface (4). Alternatively, PAI-1 due to its interaction with
  LRP can transduce signaling intermediates inhibiting apoptosis (5a) by an unknown
  mechanism or promote survival by up-regulation of the c-jun/ERK pathway and anti-apoptotic
  proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL(5b). In a PAI-1 deficient state (6) there is sustained Akt
  activation resulting in increased levels of phosphorylated caspase-9 and increased
  levels of pro- or inactive caspase-3 promoting an anti-apoptotic state (7). Alternatively,
  PAI-1 can bind to vitronectin (8) competing with EC integrins and preventing binding
  of the cell to the matrix causing anoikis.
