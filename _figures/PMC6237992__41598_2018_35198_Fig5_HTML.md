caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the mediators involved in the adaptation to
  ROS stress and cell death induced by avocatin B and AraC in AML cells co-cultured
  with BM adipocytes. (A) Energetic stress triggered by the inhibition of FAO with
  avocatin B increases ROS and promotes activation of AMPK pathway that represses
  mTOR, which results in cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition. (B) In the adipocyte-abundant
  BM microenvironment, the adaptive mechanisms upon FAO inhibition by avocatin B,
  including increase of FA (fatty adic) uptake, upregulation of glycolysis, and positive
  modification of mTOR signaling might contribute to survival of AML. In turn, AraC
  combination with avocatin B might associate with heightened ROS induction. Avocatin
  B also upregulates stress induced ATF4 in AML cells co-cultured with BM adipocytes.
  FAO inhibition which suppressed oxidative phosphorylation resulted in sensitization
  to AraC. These findings and our results indicate that the increased dependence on
  FAO metabolism of the AraC exposed AML cells might be responsible for a synergistic
  apoptotic effect of avocatin B with AraC under conditions of adipocyte co-cultures.
  Indeed, we observed that avocatin B and AraC combination treatment increased ROS
  production only in adipocyte co-cultured AML cells but not in mono-cultured cells.
