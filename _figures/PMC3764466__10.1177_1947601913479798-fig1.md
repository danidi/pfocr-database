caption: SIRT1 during neurogenesis. SIRT1 disruption alters the differentiation potential
  of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Two different models have been proposed. (A)
  In NPCs under differentiation conditions, SIRT1 transiently translocates to the
  nucleus, where it interacts with N-CoR. The N-CoR/SIRT1 complex binds to the promoter
  region of the Hes1 gene, a downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway, promoting
  neuronal differentiation. (B) Differentiation potential of NPCs is affected by the
  redox status via SIRT1 activation. In a reducing environment, Hes1 recruits transcription
  activators such as CREB binding protein (CBP) to the Mash1 promoter, a key transcription
  factor during neuronal differentiation. Under oxidizing conditions, Hes1 recruits
  SIRT1 to the Mash1 promoter, inducing histone deacetylation. This represses the
  transcription of Mash1 and promotes astroglial differentiation.
