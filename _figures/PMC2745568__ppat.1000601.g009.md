caption: This model also includes genes that are up-regulated in both the opaque and
  white responses, and therefore contain both an OPRE and a WPRE in their promoters.
  The two pathways share the same components from receptor through the MAP kinase
  cascade . However, there are two differences, circled in red. First, an extra region
  of the first intracellular loop (ICI) is essential for the white, but not the opaque
  response . Second, the transcription factor targeted by the pathway is CPH1 in the
  opaque response and a still unidentified factor in the white response .
