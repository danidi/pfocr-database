caption: In wild-type cells, interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) can be repaired by homologous
  recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The Fanconi anaemia (FA)
  pathway, however, promotes HR-dependent stabilization of the replication fork and
  DNA repair. In FA cells, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are frequently created that
  can be repaired by either HR or NHEJ. Because the DSB is one ended, NHEJ does not
  have a natural substrate to rejoin so these breaks can remain unrepaired (generating
  chromatid breaks) or may ligate with a DSB in a different chromosome (generating
  radial chromosomes). Suppression of NHEJ by deleting a component of this pathway
  or by using DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) inhibitors
  promotes the repair of the DSBs by FA-independent pathways of HR (dashed arrow).
