caption: The effects of two different biased agonists. (A) The biased agonist JMV3018
  is able to stimulate Gαq recruitment in purified ghrelin receptors in lipid discs,
  but no recruitment of Gαq or arrestin was observed for this compound. (B) The biased
  agonist wFw-Isn is able to couple to Gαq and the downstream signalling pathways
  IP and ERK phophorylation, but it is unable to activate the Gα12/13 coupled SRE
  pathway when compared with ghrelin.
