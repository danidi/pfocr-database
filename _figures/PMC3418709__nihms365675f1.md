caption: The figure shows a summary of the normal pathway of heme biosynthesis, with
  emphasis on uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase [UROD] and its inhibition by an oxidation
  product thought to be derived from uroporphyrinogen. Formation of the inhibitor
  is thought also to require the action of CYP1A2. Several sites of action of iron
  are shown, including synergistic induction of ALA synthase 1, increases in oxidative
  stress (reactive oxygen species [ROS], and induction of heme oxygenase 1. Alcohol
  and estrogens also increase ROS and induce ALA Synthase 1. HCV infection increases
  ROS and decreases hepcidin production. The latter decrease is due to up-regulation
  of histone deacetylase [HDAC] and C/CBP homology protein [CHOP], which result in
  decreased binding of C/EBP to the hepcidin gene promoter region and thus decreased
  hepcidin production. Mutations in the HFE gene, [or more rarely, HJV, and/or TfR2
  genes] also lead to decreased hepcidin production. The decrease in hepcidin leads
  to increased absorption of iron from the small intestine, leading to further hepatic
  iron overload and to amplification of the metabolic disarray.
