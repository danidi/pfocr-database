caption: Model for transcriptional regulation of human CYP17. In response to ACTH,
  PKA activation stimulates multiple proteins, including SK1 (sphingosine kinase 1),
  DGKθ (diaclyglycerol kinase theta). It is likely that PKA modulates the activity
  of several other proteins in adrenocortical cells. Activated DGKθ phosphorylates
  diacylglycerol (DAG) to form phosphatidic acid (PA). Increased nuclear concentrations
  of PA facilitate dissociation of sphingosine (SPH) and corepressor proteins [Sin3A,
  histone deacetylase (HDAC), silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors
  (SMRT)]. Binding of PA to steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) promotes the assembly of
  a transcription activator complex containing SRC1 (steroid receptor coactivator
  1), the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 (general control nonderepressed 5), p54,
  and polypyrimidine-tract binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF). PKA also
  activates SK1, which converts SPH to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P activates
  the cleavage and nuclear import of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c
  (SREBP1c) via a Ca2+-dependent pathway. Constitutive CYP17 expression is mediated
  by a complex containing specificity protein (Sp) 1, Sp3, and nuclear factor 1C (NF1C).
  Basal transcription is also mediated by GATA-6, which binds to Sp1. In response
  to cAMP GATA-6 synergizes with SF-1 to activate CYP17 transcription.
