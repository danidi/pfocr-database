caption: The dynamics of TET-mediated cytosine oxidation and its impact on DNA methylation
  patterns on regulatory elements in vivo. (A) Diagram illustrating the relative abundance
  of cytosines in the genome with “stable” levels of modifications as well as the
  small “transient” fractions that undergo rapid turnover and removal by active DNA
  demethylation processes. The stable levels of genomic 5caC have not been experimentally
  determined, as they are often under the detection limit. (B) Model illustrating
  the dual role of TET enzymes. The rate constant of TET enzymes to produce 5hmC from
  5mC is fast, whereas the rate constants for further oxidation to 5fC and 5caC are
  considerably slower. On a majority of TET target sites, 5mC is oxidized and persists
  as “stable” 5hmC, likely due to low TET residence time (“stalling TET modification”).
  On a minority of sites, preferably located in open chromatin associated with regulatory
  elements, 5mC is oxidized iteratively to 5fC and 5caC and results in net DNA demethylation
  by the TET/TDG/BER pathway (“processive TET modification”). (C) Model illustrating
  the impact of loss of TET protein function on different regulatory elements. The
  protection of active and inactive CpG island promoters by the TET proteins is only
  one of several mechanisms by which they are protected against ectopic DNA methylation.
  In contrast, distal regulatory elements such as active enhancers are vulnerable
  to aberrant DNMT activity and become DNA hypermethylated upon loss of TET activity.
