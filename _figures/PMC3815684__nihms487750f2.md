caption: Schematic representation of the role of T cells in the mechanism by which
  intermittent PTH treatment stimulates bone formation. PTH stimulates T cells to
  secrete Wnt10b, a Wnt ligand required to activate Wnt signaling in SCs and OBs.
  In the presence of T cell produced Wnt10b, stimulation of osteoblastic cells by
  PTH result in the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. This event leads to increased
  commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to the osteoblastic lineage, increased osteoblast
  proliferation and differentiation, and decreased osteoblast apoptosis. Reproduced
