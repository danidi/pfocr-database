caption: A model for the non-autonomous regulation of ISC proliferation by enterocyte
  pyruvate metabolism. A loss of the MPC in enterocytes results in increased lactate
  production by LDH, which activates the JNK stress signaling pathway and Upd3 expression.
  This secreted cytokine acts through the Dome receptor in ISCs to promote JAK/STAT
  signaling, resulting in up-regulation of Sox21a and Socs36E as well as stem cell
  proliferation. Note that this is a speculative model that is intended to summarize
  the conclusions from this study in the context of the well-established JNK/STAT
  stress response pathway in the intestine.
