caption: Action of estrogen on osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The principal activator
  of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is the ligand of the receptor associated
  with nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK-L), which is expressed on the surface of osteoblasts
  []. Binding of RANKL to the RANK receptor on osteoclasts stimulates osteoclast differentiation
  []. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is an endogenous inhibitor of the RANK/RANKL pathway and
  is secreted by osteoblasts. OPG binds to RANKL preventing its attachment to the
  RANK receptors. The presence of estrogen decreases the expression of RANKL on osteoblast
  cells, as well as increases the expression of OPG, allowing increased neutralization
  of RANKL, and stimulates apoptosis of osteoclasts []
