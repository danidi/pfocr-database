caption: 'Cancer cells undergo metabolic re-programming. The glycolytic pathway in
  normal cells (a) is used to generate pyruvate that enters the citric acid (TCA)
  cycle in the mitochondria. In cancer cells (b), many of the enzymes of the glycolytic
  pathway are upregulated and/or activated, although M2 pyruvate kinase activity,
  which catalyzes the penultimate step in the pathway, is inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation.
  Pyruvate produced by PKM2 is preferentially converted to lactate (as catalyzed by
  lactate dehydrogenase). Elevated glutamine metabolism, through the up-regulation
  and/or activation of GAC (which converts glutamine to glutamate) and GDH (converting
  glutamate to α-ketoglutarate), is then essential for ‘feeding’ the TCA cycle in
  cancer cells. Abbreviations: Glut1, glucose transporter 1; HK, hexokinase; PEP,
  phosphoenolpyruvate; PKM, pyruvate kinase M; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; AcCoA, acetyl CoA; PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; GAC, glutaminase
  C; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; αKG, α-ketoglutarate. Dashed lines represent multistep
  pathways; heavy lines represent preferred and/or accelerated pathways.'
