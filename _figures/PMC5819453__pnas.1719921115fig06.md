caption: Model of inflammatory response by Arid5a/Regnase-1/UPF1. Regnase-1 localizes
  to the cytoplasm. Arid5a is imported via an importin-α/β1 pathway. UPF1 shuttles
  between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In response to inflammation, the Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) is activated by LPS, and Il6 mRNA is induced by NF-κB. After that,
  Arid5a interacts with Il6 mRNA. Arid5a is exported to the cytoplasm via CRM1 pathway
  with UPF1.
