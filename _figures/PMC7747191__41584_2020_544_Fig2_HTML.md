caption: 'Two distinct pathways generate pathogenic antibody-secreting cells in patients
  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): germinal centre reactions and the extrafollicular
  pathway, both of which engage resting naive B cells. The germinal centre pathway
  generates the DN1 subset of double negative B cells (DN1 B cells; that is, IgD−
  CD27− cells that are CXCR5+) and the memory B cells produced in germinal centres
  can re-enter the germinal centre reaction or differentiate into antibody-secreting
  cells that produce isotype switched anti-Smith and anti-RNP. The spontaneous generation
  of the germinal centre is dependent on TLR7. TLR7 also drives the extrafollicular
  pathway, in which resting naive B cells become activated naive B cells (CD11c+IgD+CD27−CD21−MTG+CD23−)
  and, subsequently, the DN2 subset of IgD− CD27− double-negative B cells (DN2 B cells;
  IgD− CD27− CD11c+ Tbet+ CD69+CD21−CD24−CD38−CXCR5−FCRL4−FCRL5+). DN2 B cells are
  precursors of pathogenic antibody-secreting cells in patients with SLE, the differentiation
  into which is promoted by TLR7, IL-21 and IFNγ. Of note, resting naive B cells can
  also generate, in a manner dependent on the B cell receptor (BCR), regulatory plasma
  cells that are characterized by the cell surface expression of lymphocyte activation
  gene 3 protein (LAG-3). These regulatory plasma cells produce a uniquely high level
  of IL-10 in response to TLR signalling. At steady state, they also secrete IgM with
  reactivity against antigens expressed by damaged cells, suggesting that they might
  be involved in the clearance of damaged cells.'
