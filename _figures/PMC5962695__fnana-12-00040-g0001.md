caption: Extracellular matrix (ECM) in structural and functional synaptic plasticity.
  (A) (1) Cerebellin 1 (Cbln1) released from presynaptic neurons binds to its presynaptic
  α- and β-neurexins (α/βNrxn) receptors and directly recruits postsynaptic GluD2
  located on postsynaptic neurons. The tripartite complex induces and maintains excitatory
  synapses. (2) Neuronal pentraxin 1 and 2 (NP1/2) and neuronal pentraxin receptor
  (NPR) co-aggregate with GluA4 subunit-containing AMPARs in neurons. Cleavage of
  NPR by TACE triggers AMPAR endocytosis during LTD. NP1/2 are secreted mainly from
  the presynaptic side, but where they bind to NPR remains unclear. (3) Integrins
  are involved in homeostatic synaptic scaling. Pharmacological blockade of action
  potentials leads to a “scaling up” of the AMPARs present at the synapse. This requires
  an increase of β3 integrins at the surface, which results in inhibition of the small
  GTPase Rap1, which normally stimulates the endocytic removal of GluA2-containing
  AMPARs from the cell surface. As a net outcome, synaptic expression of AMPARs is
  increased, resulting in larger excitatory postsynaptic currents. This mechanism
  is most likely negatively regulated by SPARC. (4) Hevin secreted from astrocytes
  induces synaptogenesis by bridging direct interaction-incompatible Neurexin-1α (Nrx1α)
  and Neuroligin-1B (NL1B) across the synaptic cleft. SPARC strongly inhibits Hevin-induced
  excitatory synaptogenesis in vitro. (B) (5) The neuronal serine protease neurotrypsin
  (NT) is stored in presynaptic terminals and secreted in an inactive form in response
  to presynaptic action potential (AP) firing. NT contains a pro-domain that inhibits
  its proteolytic activity. Its activation requires a zymogen activation presumably
  by a proprotein convertase (PC). Activated neurotrypsin cleaves agrin and yields
  a C-terminal 22-kDa fragment (Ag22), which inhibits the α3 subunit of the Na+/K+
  ATPase (α3NKA) and induces dendritic filopodia formation. (6) Reelin signals through
  its receptors, very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein
  E receptor type 2 (APOER2), which interact with adaptor protein disabled 1 (Dab1).
  Activation of reelin signaling pathway results in cytoplasmic adaptor protein disabled
  1 (Dab1) phosphorylation via the Src family of tyrosine kinases (SFK), activation
  of SFKs and tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDARs that increases receptor activity.
  This mechanism induces LTP and spinogenesis and it is negatively regulated by ADAMTS
  dependent reelin cleavage. (7) Hyaluronic acid and tenascin-C support the activity
  of neuronal L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LVGCCs). Ca2+ influx through NMDARs
  and LGCCs induces diverse forms of LTP.
