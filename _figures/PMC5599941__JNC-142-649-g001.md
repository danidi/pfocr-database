caption: Endocannabinoid‐mediated long‐term depression of inhibitory transmission
  (iLTD) in GABAergic pre‐synaptic terminal induced by endogenous brain‐derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF)‐TrkB signaling during the critical period. Retrograde signaling of
  endocannabinoids from post‐synaptic pyramidal compartments negatively regulates
  GABA release from the pre‐synaptic membrane and subsequently causes maturation of
  the inhibitory circuitry through long‐term depression of inhibitory transmission
  (iLTD). An acute increase in endogenous BDNF decreases GABA release and promotes
  iLTD. Phospholipase C (PLC)‐diacylglycerol lipase (DGL) pathway generates the CB1R
  agonist 2‐arachidonoylglycerol (2‐AG). First, the precursor of 2‐AG, diacylglycerol
  (DAG) is generated by membrane‐associated PLC that cleaves the phosphate group from
  the membrane phospholipid precursors when in contact. DAG is then hydrolyzed by
  DGL to form 2‐AG which is released from the post‐synaptic compartment for retrograde
  signaling in the pre‐synaptic terminal. The exact mechanism for its release is still
  unclear. The endocannabinoids then bind to CB1R and sends feedback to decrease the
  secretion of GABA neurotransmitters.
