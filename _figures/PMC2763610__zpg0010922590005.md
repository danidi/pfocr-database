caption: Schematic diagram contrasting “classic” (“ionic”) versus “signaling” pathways
  for CTS effects. In the classic pathway, any signaling through the Na+/K+-ATPase
  requires inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase pumping activity, which in turn is accompanied
  by changes in cytosolic [Na+] and [K+]. As discussed in the text, some authors feel
  that the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase may be more sensitive to CTS in terms of enzymatic
  function. The increases in [Na+] and decreases in [K+] then induce an increase in
  cytosolic [Ca2+], which, in turn, activates a variety of pathways that have combinations
  of genomic and nongenomic effects. In contrast, the signaling pathway involves the
  association of Src with the Na+/K+-ATPase in a caveolar domain. Binding of the CTS
  to the Na+/K+-ATPase activates Src, which, in turn, transactivates the EGFR and
  phospholipase C (PLC). This leads to a cascade that involves generation of ROS,
  activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) through activation of its mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase (MEK), activation of PI(3)K, stimulation of endocytosis and
  activation of Akt as well as activation of protein kinase C. This signaling construct
  proposes that these steps induce increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] and induce the combinations
  of genomic and nongenomic effects. Note that whereas both the classic and signaling
  pathways allow for intervention at the level of CTS binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase
  [(a), immunoneutralization or pharmacological neutralization], the signaling pathway
  presents a number of potential targets such as (b) interference with Src activation
  and EGFR transactivation, (c) PLC activation, (d) MEK activation, (e) ROS generation
  or scavenging, or (f) PI(3)K activation. Modulation of the signaling pathways at
  the level of PKC (g), ERK, and Akt might also be possible.
