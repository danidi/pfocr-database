caption: Simplified schematic representation of the connections of the circumventricular
  organs and the DMH that may be involved in the lactate response. Many other connections
  of the DMH are not included for the sake of simplicity. It is suggested that the
  OVLT acts as the primary sensory site for peripheral lactate input and in turn activates
  the DMH to elicit a panic response. AII, Angiotensin II; BP, blood pressure; CG,
  central gray; DMH, dorsomedial hypothalamus;EAA, excitatory amino acids; GABA, γ-aminobutyric
  acid; HR, heart rate;IML, intermediolateral column of the spinal cord;LC, locus
  ceruleus; LH, lateral hypothalamus; mePOA, medial preoptic area;NTS, nucleus of
  tractus solitarius; OVLT, organum vasculosum lamina terminalis; PVN, paraventricular
  nucleus of the hypothalamus; RR, respiratory rate; SFO, subfornical organ.
