caption: Pathway analysis result showing 18 differentially expressed proteins following
  50% PH can be sorted into the c-myc pathway. There are 18 root nodes in the sub-network
  shown, of which ACAA2, ALDH2, ACOX1, GSTP1, ACADM, ASS1(ASSY) are up-regulated and
  VDAC1, MGST, RPL11, ALDX, RPS5 are "newly-induced" in response to 50% PH; ACTG1(Actin
  cytoplasmic 2), HSPA8(HSC70), CAT(catalase) are down-regulated and FAH(FAAA), NDUFS3,
  RPS10, eEF1A2 are below detection limit. These root nodes are connected to c-Myc
  directly or indirectly, and their expression levels or activities can be regulated
  by c-Myc, and some of them (such as RPL11) can regulate c-Myc activity in a feedback
  manner. Legend describing symbols in the network can be found in Additional file
