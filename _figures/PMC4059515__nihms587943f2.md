caption: Restructuring of adhesion at the apical ES and the BTB in the seminiferous
  epithelium during the epithelial cycle to facilitate the transit of developing germ
  cell across the epithelium is regulated by the intricate actions of polarity proteins
  (e.g., PAR6, 14-3-3, Cdc42) and actin regulatory proteins (e.g., Eps8, Arp2/3 complex,
  drebrin E) as depicted in this hypothetical model. The left panel illustrates the
  seminiferous epithelium of a stage VII tubule in which the integrity of the apical
  ES and basal ES is maintained by the rigid actin filament bundles. However, at stage
  VIII of the epithelial cycle when preleptotene spermatocytes are in transit in “clones”
  at the BTB and elongated spermatids begin the process of sperm release (i.e., spermiation),
  endocytosis of integral membrane proteins occurs at the basal ES (at the BTB) and
  apical ES, which is mediated by the intricate actions of the polarity proteins,
  Arp2/3 protein complex and drebrin E (and a concomitant loss and/or reduced Eps8
  activity) to increase the actin network plasticity to facilitate the endocytic vesicle-mediated
  protein trafficking events. While some of the endocytosed proteins are degraded
  via the endosome- or ubiquitin-mediated pathway, many of the internalized proteins
  undergo transcytosis and recycling, so that these proteins can be “reused” to establish
  the “newly” formed apical ES or basal ES and TJ/gap junction/desmosome components
  at the BTB. Thus, the extensive junction restructuring events that occur during
  the epithelial cycle do not lead to a disruption of the seminiferous epithelium.
