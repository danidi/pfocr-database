caption: Schematic of proposed signaling involved in the effect of COX-2 in H/R-induced
  cardiomyocytes apoptosis. In cardiomyocytes, COX-2 was strongly induced in response
  to H/R stimulation in NFκB-dependent way. Acute pretreatment with NS398, the COX-2
  specific inhibitor, can protect against H/R-induced cell injury and apoptosis through
  attenuation of proinflammatory cytokines expression, ROS formation, and activation
  of Akt/iNOS/NO signaling pathway.
