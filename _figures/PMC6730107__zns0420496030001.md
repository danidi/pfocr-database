caption: A, Schematic figure of the rate model of Parkinson's disease. The major nuclei
  of the basal ganglia, the predominant connections, and the neurotransmitters involved
  are depicted. Information flow is implied by the arrows. In this model, changes
  in neuronal activity attributable to loss of striatal dopamine are indicated by
  thick (increased) and thin (decreased) arrows. In Parkinson's disease, activity
  in the direct pathway from striatum to GPi/SNr is decreased and that in the indirect
  pathway via GPe and STN is increased, leading to increased firing rates in the output.
  This inhibits premotor centers, such as thalamus, that facilitate corticospinal
  motor output. B, Schematic figure of the oscillation model of Parkinson's disease.
  In the absence of dopamine in the striatum, pathological oscillations arise or are
  enhanced in the basal ganglia, which rhythmically drive other regions or nuclei
  (depicted by arrows). Frequencies under 10 Hz (i.e., rest tremor frequency at 3-7
  Hz) arise in the basal ganglia and spread to the cortex to produce an antikinetic
  effect. The STN is driven by oscillations in the cortex in the beta band (11-30
  Hz) that can also be considered antikinetic. Oscillations in the gamma band (>70
  Hz) that facilitate movement (prokinetic) are suppressed or absent in Parkinson's
  disease (thin blue arrow). Thal, Motor thalamus; glu, glutamatergic (excitatory)
  pathway; GABA, inhibitory pathway.
