caption: (A) α-ketoglutarate (α KG) is a critical co-factor for the Ten-eleven translocation
  dioxygenase (TET) which oxidizes 5-methylcytosine. TET regulates both DNA and histone
  methylation, and EGLN1 gene product, hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase
  2 (HIF-PH2), or prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2), is an enzyme
  encoded by the EGLN1 gene. It is also known as Egl nine homolog 1.The EGLN1 gene
  is responsible for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway by hydroxylation of
  proline-564 and proline-402 by PHD2. (B) The methylation cycle regulated by TET.
  The action of DNA demethytransferases (DNMTs) converts cytosine (C) for 5’ methyl
  cytosine. The TET enzymes oxidize 5’ methyC to 5’-hydroxylmethyC and 5’formylC.
  The 5’-hydroxylmethyC is removed by the BER enzyme, TDG, to restore C, which is
  subsequently methylated. 5’formylC is caboxylated by an unknown enzyme to restore
  C, which is subsequently methylated. Success of this cycle maintains a balance of
  methylation in the genome. The dotted line indicates the removal of 5-hydrolymethylcytosine
  and restoration to cytosine to re-set the cycle.
