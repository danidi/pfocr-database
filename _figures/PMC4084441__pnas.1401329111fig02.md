caption: Comparison of the reactions and genes available from AraCyc v.10.0 and PlantSEED
  for FAD biosynthesis. For the creation of the PlantSEED subsystem named “Riboflavin,
  FMN and FAD biosynthesis in plants,” 17 gene–reaction associations found in AraCyc
  were excised (black type with strike-through), and four additional gene–reaction
  associations curated from the literature were added (purple). Green indicates agreement
  between AraCyc and PlantSEED. Furthermore, two additional reactions were added to
  the pathway based on experimental support (yellow boxes). For the other reactions
  in the pathway, AraCyc contained the correct gene–reaction associations, and these
  were incorporated into the subsystem. The full list of genes is found in Table S3.
  The abbreviations and Roman numerals used to represent the reactions and metabolites,
  respectively, are detailed in the associated diagram found online at http://plantseed.theseed.org.
  The current version of AraCyc (11.5) includes the updated curation shown here.
