caption: Once into cytoplasm, platinum derivatives promote the Reactive Oxygen Species
  (ROS) synthesis, that cause the alteration of cell membranes permeability, the deregulation
  of different signal transduction pathways and calcium homeostasis but overall the
  DNA damage. Glutathione S-transferases protein 1 (GSTP1) catalyzes the conjugation
  reaction of platinum derivates with reduced glutathione (GSH), in order to increase
  their hydro-solubility and to facilitate their excretion. When platinum derivatives
  reach the nucleus, they form intra and interstrand DNA cross-links that block the
  cell cycle by activating tumor cell apoptosis through different pathways. DNA adducts
  however may activate sensor proteins and DNA repair systems by avoiding cytotoxicity.
  Excision repair cross complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is the main endonuclease of
  DNA NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair) pathway but it also interacts with the BER
  (Base Excision Repair) function in maintaining chromosomal stability and telomers
  integrity. X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is another enzyme of
  BER pathway that repairs DNA bases damaged by X-rays, ROS and mostly alkylating
  agents (. The efficiency of the GSTP1detoxification reaction and of DNA repairing
  systems affects the platinum-based treatments response. ROS - reactive oxygen species;
  GSTP1 - glutathione s-transferases protein 1; ERCC1 - excision repair cross complementation
  group 1; NER - nucleotide excision repair; BER - base excision repair; XRCC1 - X-ray
  repair cross-complementing group 1.
