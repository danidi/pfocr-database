caption: Nrf2/ARE pathway during basal and stressed conditions. During homeostatic
  conditions Nrf2 remains in tethering with Keap1 and Cul3-Rbx1-E2 ligase and undergoes
  proteasome degradation through ubiquitination. In normal brain functioning, mild
  ROS production dissociates Nrf2 from Keap1 and translocate it to the nucleus. After
  nuclear translocation, it binds with ARE to transcribe genes of various antioxidants
  enzymes to combat deleterious effects of ROS. On contrary during chronic stress,
  increased activity of inflammatory cascades and GSK-3β increased Nrf2 proteasome
  degradation via ubiquitination. Nrf2, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like
  2; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH associated protein-1; Cul-3, cullin 3; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; ARE, antioxidant response element; Rbx1, ring box-1; E2, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme; Ub, ubiquitin.
