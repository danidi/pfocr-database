caption: Simplified pathway diagram for synthesis of Asn-group and Gln-group amino
  acids and LAs. Translocation of Asn and Gln transports fixed nitrogen from older
  to younger tissues (). The lolines are derived from the Gln derivative, Pro, and
  the Asn-derivative, l-homoserine (Hse), probably via conjugation of its derivative,
  O-acetyl-Hse, to the ring nitrogen atom of Pro (; ). In fungi, O-acetyl-Hse is the
  precursor of Thr, Ile, and Met, whereas in plants, O-phospho-Hse plays the same
  role.
