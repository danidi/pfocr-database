caption: The IL-4-induced alternate pathway operates in parallel with the classical
  pathway, is blocked by rottlerin, and depends on Lyn. Several key elements of the
  classical (black arrows) and alternate (green arrows) BCR signalling pathways are
  shown. Naïve B cells contain only one signalling pathway that is entirely dependent
  on signalosome elements such as PI-3K or PKCβ. IL-4 treatment produces a new, alternate
  pathway for BCR signalling that operates in parallel alongside, but does not replace,
  the classical pathway. The alternate pathway does not utilize signalosome elements
  but, in contrast to the classical pathway, requires Lyn and a rottlerin-inhibitable
  factor. Complete interruption of BCR-triggered ERK phosphorylation in IL-4-treated
  B cells requires separate inhibition of both the classical and the alternate pathways
  with, for example, the combination of LY294002 plus rottlerin.
