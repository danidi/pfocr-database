caption: 'Differentially expressed genes were derived from the Training Set by comparing
  each disease to healthy controls matched for ethnicity and gender: TB = 2524, active
  sarcoidosis = 1391, pneumonia = 2801 and lung cancer = 1626 transcripts (≥1.5 fold
  change from the mean of the controls, Mann Whitney with Benjamini Hochberg FDR = 0.01).
  (A) IPA canonical pathways was used to determined the most significant pathways
  (i-iv) associated with each disease relative to the other diseases (Fisher’s exact
  with Benjamini Hochberg FDR = 0.05). The bottom x-axis and bars of each graph indicates
  the log (p-value) and the top x-axis and line indicates the percentage of genes
  present in the pathway. The genes in the EIF2 signalling pathway are predominately
  under-abundant genes however the genes in the other three pathways are predominantly
  over-abundant relative to the controls. Pathways above the blue dotted line are
  significant (p<0.05). (B) The IFN signalling IPA pathway is overlaid onto each disease
  group. Coloured genes are differentially expressed in that disease group compared
  to their matched controls (Fisher’s exact FDR = 0.05). Red genes represent over-abundance
  and green under-abundance. The pathway for TB is shown enlarged so the detail of
  the genes can be seen, it is also shown again in a much smaller scale besides the
  other diseases so that a visual comparison can be more easily made.'
