caption: 'Three major UPR pathways in metazoans. Misfolded proteins or homeostatic
  alterations in the ER activate three ER-resident sensors: IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6.
  Key players in each pathway are highlighted. Among the three branches, the IRE1α–XBP1
  pathway, the focus of this review, is the most evolutionarily conserved. IRE1α mediates
  Xbp1u mRNA splicing to generate a potent transcription factor XBP1s (the spliced
  form of XBP1). XBP1s regulates a diverse array of genes involved in ER homeostasis,
  adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and cell survival. In addition, activation of IRE1α may
  lead to phosphorylation of JNK and hence influence the outcome of inflammatory response.'
