caption: Schematic illustrating that phosphorylated MAP4 promotes hypoxic endothelial
  cell migration and proliferation. The hypoxic environment stimulates the activation
  of the p38/MAPK signaling pathway and consequently induces the phosphorylation of
  MAP4 at S768 and S787. Once phosphorylated, MAP4 detaches from MTs; this results
  in the depolymerization of MTs, which is required for the migration and proliferation
  of ECs.
