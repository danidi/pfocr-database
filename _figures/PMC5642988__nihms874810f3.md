caption: The mammalian intestinal mucosa is to form villi and crypts. YAP1 activity
  is highest at the bottom of the crypt, where ISCs and Paneth cells reside. The villus
  consists of differentiated cells. ISCs in the crypt base differentiate into transit
  amplifying cells, which further differentiate along a secretory lineage (into goblet
  cells, enteroendocrine cells and Paneth cells) or an absorptive lineage (into enterocytes).
  After differentiation, Paneth cells move down to the stem cell niche and reside
  beside ISCs at the bottom of the crypt. YAP1, Wnt signalling and Notch signalling
  play important parts in stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell differentiation.
  YAP1 interacts with KLF4 to induce progenitor cell differentiation into goblet cells,
  whereas Wnt signalling is involved in Paneth cell differentiation, and high Notch
  signalling induces differentiation along the absorptive lineage. ISC, intestinal
  stem cell; KLF4, krueppel-like factor 4; TEAD, TEA domain family member; YAP1, Yes-associated
  protein 1.
