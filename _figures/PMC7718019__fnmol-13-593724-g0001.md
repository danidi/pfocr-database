caption: Amyloid precursor protein (APP) synthesis and trafficking. (A) APP synthesis.
  APP synthesis commences with transcription on chromosome 21. Then, it is translated
  by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bound ribosomes, translocated into the ER, and trafficked
  to the Golgi to assume native structure and folding (Sun et al., ; Sole-Domenech
  et al., ). Eventually, the APP is inserted into the plasma membrane and reinternalized
  to produce Aβ. Otherwise, APP can be redirected to non-amyloidogenic pathways by
  the retromer complex and transported back to the Golgi or plasma membrane via the
  recycling pathway. Nascent Aβ peptides are either extracellularly released or degraded
  by the lysosome (Hernández-Zimbrón and Rivas-Arancibia, ). (B) ER stress. Aβ toxicity
  responds with consequential disruption of Ca2+ permeability via mitochondria-associated
  membrane (MAM), mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and eventual apoptosis.
