caption: A) eIF4E recognition of the 5’ mRNA cap facilitates binding of the 43S preinitiation
  complex in the canonical pathway of translation initiation. Upon recognition of
  the initiation codon the 60S subunit joins and translation is initiated. This mechanism
  of eIF4E and cap-dependent translation initiation is responsible for the majority
  of mRNA translation in the eukaryotic cell. B) N(6)-methyladenosine (M6A) in the
  mRNA 5’ UTR can directly bind the eIF3 multiprotein complex and allow recruitment
  of the 43S complex to initiate translation independent of the 5’ cap. C) A subset
  of mRNAs are bound by the d subunit of the eIF3 complex. eIF3d cap recognition directs
  translation initiation allowing cap-dependent translation independent of eIF4E,
  the canonical cap recognition protein. D) Highly structured mRNA elements, in many
  cases with the assistance of IRES trans acting factors (ITAF) recruit ribosomes
  to specific start codons in viral mRNAs, allowing cap-independent translation initiation.
  The requirement for mRNA structure, ITAFs, and other factors in eukaryotic IRES
  remains a subject of research. E) Ribosomes vary in their ribosomal protein composition,
  and selectively translate mRNAs. Ribosomal proteins, in tandem with cis elements
  of the message, may direct ribosomes to translate specific mRNAs in changing conditions.
