caption: In our system, we showed that Celastrol could induce ROS-mediated autophagy
  and apoptosis. Celastrol-induced autophagy occurred at an early phase and was initiated
  by ROS to stimulate AKT/p70S6K signal activation, which promotes HIF-1α translation
  and BNIP3 expression, leading to autophagy. Apoptosis occurred at a late phase,
  and the main mechanism by which Celastrol killed HepG2 and H1299 cells was through
  the ROS-mediated activation of JNK and inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function, which
  led to Akt protein depletion and a decrease in Akt activity, finally resulting in
  the induction of apoptosis.
