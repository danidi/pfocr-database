caption: Fisetin inhibits the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and impairs translocation
  of NF-κB to the nucleus. The decreased NF-κB in the nucleus reduces its binding
  on the promoter of the uPA gene, and results in repressing the expression and activity
  of uPA, thereby disrupting the migratory and invasive ability of cervical cancer
  SiHa cells.
