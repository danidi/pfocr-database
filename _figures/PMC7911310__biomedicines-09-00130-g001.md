caption: 'Methionine metabolism. Methionine cycle pathway: Methionine is catabolized
  by methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), producing the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine
  (SAM). Methyltransferases (MTs), including glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), use
  SAM as a methyl source, thereby producing S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH). SAH is
  then converted by SAH hydrolase (SAHH, also known as adenosylhomocysteinase, AHCY)
  to homocysteine. Homocysteine can then either contribute to the transsulfuration
  pathway for glutathione synthesis or be converted back to methionine by methionine
  synthase (MS) or betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), thus completing
  the methionine cycle. Salvage pathway and polyamine biosynthesis: Methionine contributes
  to polyamine biosynthesis by serving as a source of SAM. SAM is decarboxylated by
  SAM decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) to decarboxylated SAM (dcSAM), which acts as an aminopropyl
  group donor. Arginine is converted by arginase (ARG) to ornithine and is decarboxylated
  by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce putrescine. Putrescine is converted
  to spermidine and spermine through spermidine synthase (SRM) and spermine synthase
  (SMS), which both use dcSAM as an aminopropyl donor. On the other hand, dcSAM is
  converted to MTA after the donation of an aminopropyl group for polyamine synthesis,
  and MTA is converted by multiple enzymatic steps to methionine. Transsulfuration
  pathway: Homocysteine produced through the methionine cycle is metabolized in the
  transsulfuration pathway to generate cysteine. CBS synthesizes cystathionine by
  the condensation of homocysteine and serine. Thereafter, cystathionine is hydrolyzed
  by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CGL) to generate cysteine, and cysteine is further utilized
  in glutathione (GSH) and taurine synthesis. In addition, homocysteine is catalyzed
  by CGL, producing homoserine and H2S, and both CGL and CBS catalyze the H2S production
  from cysteine and the production of pyruvate and serine, respectively.'
