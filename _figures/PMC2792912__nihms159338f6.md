caption: Model of Six2 function during mouse pyloric sphincter development. Based
  on the results presented here and those published for chick PS development, we propose
  a model for PS formation in the mouse. Six2 activity in the GS region of the developing
  stomach functions to suppress expression of Bmp4 in the PS territory. It is possible
  that this regulation of the Bmp4 pathway is accomplished through transcriptional
  regulation of another unidentified factor. Other PS markers (Gremlin, Nkx2.5, and
  Sox9) are regulated downstream of Six2 activity either by an unidentified factor
  or by the Bmp4 pathway. Gremlin can further abrogate Bmp signaling to control smooth
  muscle thickness.
