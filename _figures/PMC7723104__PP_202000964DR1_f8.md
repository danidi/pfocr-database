caption: Working model of the senescence pathway for dual-localized WHY1 in response
  to SA. The nuclear isoforms of WHY1 are represented as both a large (37 kD [larger
  letters]) and a small molecular mass (29 kD [smaller letters]). WHY1 has a dual
  function in plastids and the nucleus. WHY1 loss-of-function mutation increases SA
  accumulation at an early developmental stage (37 dag) through increased PAL1 and
  repressed BSMT1 expression; elevated SA promotes nuclear WHY1 de-modification and
  promotes ICS1 and BSMT1 expression, thereby balancing SA homeostasis in the cells.
  High SA levels by ICS1 cause feedback enhancing ROS accumulation, thus promoting
  senescence. pWHY1 stimulates PAL1/ICS1 expression but represses BSMT1, allowing
  high levels of SA, also leading to early senescence. Thus, distribution of WHY1
  organelle isoforms and the putative feedback of SA form a circularly integrated
  regulatory network during plant senescence in a developmental-dependent manner.
  Plastid (Chl) is shown as a green ovary and nucleus (Nuc) as a gray ovary. Lines
  indicate regulation, wide arrows indicate transfer or translocation, and broken
  lines indicate uncertainty.
