caption: In this scheme some of the key mechanisms influencing temporal control of
  cardiac metabolism and redox tone are summarized in the cardiomyocyte. Dashed lines
  depict metabolic pathways. Italics depicts examples of clock regulated genes. In
  this model, circadian-dependent transcriptional regulation in the nucleus (represented
  by the clock at an arbitrary time of day) controls the protein levels of key metabolic
  proteins (examples shown here are Pik3r1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulator subunit
  1; Hk2, hexokinase 2 and Glut 4 Glut4, glucose transporter isoform 4; and Dgat2,
  diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2). This leads to changes in protein expression
  and substrate uptake/utilization, which in turn affects both mitochondria function
  and the hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP). A further level of regulation is provided
  by the impact of neurohumoral factors on glucose and fatty acid metabolism, as described
  in the text. The net effect is to integrate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) demand
  with metabolism, therefore meeting fluctuations in metabolic/energetic demands during
  the light/day cycle. The interface with redox signaling occurs at a number of levels,
  some of which involve the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
  2)-like 2). Increased levels of Nrf2 in the nucleus controls levels of glutathione
  (GSH) in the cell and the redox tone. Higher levels of GSH attenuate ROS (reactive
  oxygen species) signaling by changing the steady state levels of ROS signaling molecules
  such as H2O2, which can be generated by the mitochondria.
