number: Figure 1
caption: GSL synthesis and turnover. Schematic representation of the metabolism of
  the major GSL classes synthesized along the secretory and endocytic pathways. For
  details refer to the text. GSEs catalysing the major synthetic reactions and the
  enzymes involved in GSLs/SM dismantling are reported in red. GSLs, glycosphingolipids;
  Sph, sphinganine from the de novo pathway or sphingosine from the salvage pathway;
  Cer, ceramide; SM, sphingomyelin; GCS, GlcCer synthase; LCS, LacCer synthase; CERT,
  ceramide transfer protein; FAPP2, four-phosphate adaptor protein 2; SMSase, sphingomyelinase;
  CDase, ceramidase.
