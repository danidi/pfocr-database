caption: 'Schema on supraspinal locomotor control in humans. The left panel shows
  the presumed network in healthy subject as derived from animal electrophysiology
  and human functional imaging. The indirect pathway from frontal cortex via basal
  ganglia to the brainstem locomotor centers allows modulation of the gait pattern
  in response to external demands. The direct pathway from motor cortex to the spinal
  cord can bypass the brainstem centers during undisturbed locomotion. Rhythmic input
  from the cerebellum conveys with both pathways in the brainstem tegmentum. The insert
  shows BOLD signal increases during mental imagery of locomotion. The right panel
  illustrates network changes in PD. The direct pathway (depicted in red) compensates
  for deficiencies in the indirect pathways but does not allow adequate adaptation
  of gait to environmental demands. Abbreviations: CLR: cerebellar locomotor region;
  CPG: central pattern generator; DLPFC: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; MLR: mesencephalic
  locomotor region; PMRF, pontomedullary reticular formation; PMC: primary motor cortex;
  SLR: subthalamic locomotor region; SMA: supplementary motor area. Figure adapted
