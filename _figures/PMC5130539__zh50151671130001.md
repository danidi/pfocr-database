caption: Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) serves as a substrate that can be used in the glycolytic
  pathway resulting in generation of pyruvate. Alternatively, it can be used in the
  pentose phosphate pathway, in which glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes
  a reaction resulting in formation of NADPH as well as precursors for nucleotide
  synthesis (such as ribulose 5-phosphate).
