caption: 'Schematic model of the major Met1-Ub-controlled pathways activated by pathogens,
  and of the bacterial and viral effectors that modulate the Met1-Ub machinery. Activation
  of receptors by cytokines or molecular patterns from microbes leads to the formation
  of Met1-Ub and ultimately transmission of signals from the activated receptor to
  initiate anti-bacterial autophagy or transcription factor activation via nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon response factor 3 (IRF3). Red arrows and lines
  denote where in the pathway the effectors exert their function. The pathogen effectors
  depicted target Met1-Ub in various direct or indirect ways. Abbreviations: HBx hepatitis
  B virus X protein, IpaH1.4 invasion plasmid antigen H1.4, IpaH2.5 invasion plasmid
  antigen H2.5, IRF7 interferon regulatory factor 7, LMP1 latent membrane protein
  1, MAVS mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein, NS3 non-structural protein 3,
  NSP1α non-structural protein 1α, Nsp11 non-structural protein 11, OspG outer Shigella
  protein G, PPE60 proline–proline–glutamate motifs 60, RavD region allowing vacuole
  colocalization D, SopE Salmonella outer protein E, Tax trans-activator protein X.'
