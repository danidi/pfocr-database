caption: 'Upon binding of active TGF-β to the TGF-β type I (ALK5) and type II (TβRII)
  receptor, ALK5 is phosphorylated and activated by TβRII. ALK5, in turn, phosphorylates
  and activates the R-Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, which form a complex with Smad4. This
  complex translocates to the nucleus, binds to DNA-binding transcription factors,
  co-activators and co-repressors regulating TGF-β/Smad target gene expression. In
  addition, TGF-β is also known to regulate non-Smad pathways, including ERK, p38
  MAPK, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), PI3K-Akt and small GTPases. Several strategies
  to inhibit the TGF-β signaling have been preclinically tested, and are currently
  in clinical trials (see red boxes). Three of these classes of TGF-β inhibitors are
  tested in the clinic and include the following: ligand traps, including monoclonal-neutralizing
  TGF-β antibodies that bind and neutralize TGF-β ligand, preventing TGF-β ligand–receptor
  interactions; receptor kinase inhibitors, which are small molecules that inhibit
  TβRI (and TβRII) kinase activity, preventing the activation TGF-β R-Smads; and antisense
  oligonucleotides (ASOs) which inhibit TGF-β expression at transcriptional/translational
  level, preventing the production and release of TGF-β in microenvironment. Peptide
  aptamers are a class of TGF-β inhibitors that are not yet tested in vivo. They can
  specifically bind to R-Smads of interest and prevent complex formation with Smad4
  offering targeting of specific TGF-β responses.'
