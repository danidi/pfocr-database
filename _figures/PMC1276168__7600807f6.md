caption: Schematic representation of the Imd signaling pathway in Drosophila S2 cells.
  The asterisk (*) represents a physical interaction of PGRP-LC and Imd detected by
  immunoprecipitation assay (). Two asterisks (**) represents the interaction of TAB
  and TAK1 detected in a yeast two-hybrid screen (). As neither TAB, TAK1 nor Iap2
  dsRNA treatment affected Relish cleavage, we conclude that these factors affect
  antimicrobial peptide release via a cleavage independent mechanism. We speculate
  that the mechanism may involve Relish nuclear transportation, JNK pathway activation
  or possibly the activation of another yet unidentified transcriptional cofactor
  for Relish (question marks).
