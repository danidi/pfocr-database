caption: P. gingivalis impacts cell cycle control in GECs. Schematic representation
  of Kinexus antibody array results showing cell cycle pathways modulated by P. gingivalis
  infection (MOI 100, 6h). Pointed arrow indicates molecular interaction resulting
  in activation, flat arrow indicates molecular interaction resulting in inhibition.
  Magenta ellipsoids represent proteins that accumulate in infected cells as compared
  to non-infected cells, blue ellipsoids represent proteins reduced in amount, yellow
  ellipsoids indicate proteins whose expression was not affected by P. gingivalis
  infection, and coral pink ellipsoids represent proteins that were not present on
  the array. Violet and green circles respectively indicate more phosphorylated sites
  and less phosphorylated sites in infected cells, yellow circles show the sites that
  were equally phosphorylated in both cells, and coral pink circles represent phosphorylation
  sites that were not tested. % change in accumulation of phosphorylation of individual
  proteins is given. (A) Cell cycle checkpoint overview (B) Phosphorylation of CDK2
  at Thr160 and accumulation of Cyclin A suggested an increase in cell cycle progression
  into S and G2 phases. (C) Both the level and the activity of p53 were diminished
  by P. gingivalis. (D) Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by P. gingivalis.
