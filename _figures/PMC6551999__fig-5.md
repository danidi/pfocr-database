caption: Detrimental effects of H2S donation against cancer development. (a) H2S induces
  uncontrolled cellular acidification. H2S stimulates the rate of glycolysis by enhancing
  the uptake of glucose, which leads to the accumulation of lactate and intracellular
  acid. Due to the inhibitory effect of H2S on the activity of AE and NHE, the intracellular
  acid cannot be efficiently exported out of cells, which causes cancer cell death.
  (b) H2S suppresses the cell survival signaling pathway. H2S has been found to suppress
  the activity of cell survival pathways such as NF-κB and STAT3 and, therefore, downregulates
  the downstream anti-apoptotic proteins, which leads to cancer cell death. (c) H2S
  induces cell cycle arrest. H2S induces cell cycle arrest at G1/S by upregulating
  the expression of p21Cip1 and downregulating expression of cyclin D1. Besides, H2S
  was also found to induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M; however, the underlying mechanism
  has not been studied. AE, anion exchanger; NHE, sodium/proton exchanger; STAT3,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Color images are available online.
