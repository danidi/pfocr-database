caption: PPARs are mediators of lipid signaling in inflammation and cancer. Lipid
  mediators originate from and participate in the control of physiological and pathophysiological
  situations. Many lipid-modifying enzymes are involved in the production of PPAR
  ligands. The cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases (LO), epoxygenases/cytochrome
  (CYP)/P450s enzymes, and the lipases use either fatty acids, triglycerides, or phospholipids
  as substrates to generate PPAR ligands, which are guided to their receptors by the
  cytoplasmic fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). PPARs translate these lipid signals
  into responses, which maintain energy homeostasis, regulate inflammation and modify
  tumor growth. Among the pathways involved in inflammation and cancer, PPARs interact
  with COX2, NF-κB, MAPKs, and PTEN. PPARα and γ inhibit COX2 expression, thereby
  reducing the production of their own ligands. Conversely, PPARβ/δ is thought to
  activate COX2 expression, generating a positive feedback loop by increasing the
  production of PPAR ligands. PPARs reduce inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB, a major
  pathway that links chronic inflammation to cancer promotion. Several modes of interactions
  between PPARs and MAPKs have been reported, but the relevance and consequences of
  such crosstalks are unclear. Finally, PPARβ/δ and γ decrease and increase the expression
  of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome
  10), respectively. PPARγ activation of PTEN is thought to potentiate its tumor suppressor
  function, whereas PPARβ/δ would have the opposite effect.

  description: PPARs are mediators of lipid signaling in inflammation and cancer.
    Lipid mediators originate from and participate in the control of physiological
    and pathophysiological situations. Many lipid-modifying enzymes are involved in
    the production of PPAR ligands. The cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases (LO),
    epoxygenases/cytochrome (CYP)/P450s enzymes, and the lipases use either fatty
    acids, triglycerides, or phospholipids as substrates to generate PPAR ligands,
    which are guided to their receptors by the cytoplasmic fatty acid binding proteins
    (FABPs). PPARs translate these lipid signals into responses, which maintain energy
    homeostasis, regulate inflammation and modify tumor growth. Among the pathways
    involved in inflammation and cancer, PPARs interact with COX2, NF-κB, MAPKs, and
    PTEN. PPARα and γ inhibit COX2 expression, thereby reducing the production of
    their own ligands. Conversely, PPARβ/δ is thought to activate COX2 expression,
    generating a positive feedback loop by increasing the production of PPAR ligands.
    PPARs reduce inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB, a major pathway that links chronic
    inflammation to cancer promotion. Several modes of interactions between PPARs
    and MAPKs have been reported, but the relevance and consequences of such crosstalks
    are unclear. Finally, PPARβ/δ and γ decrease and increase the expression of the
    tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome
    10), respectively. PPARγ activation of PTEN is thought to potentiate its tumor
    suppressor function, whereas PPARβ/δ would have the opposite effect.
