caption: 'Mechanisms of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling in endothelial
  dysfunction. A depletion of eNOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an L-arginine
  deficiency, and an increase in endogenous eNOS inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine
  (ADMA), leads to eNOS uncoupling. Produced by the uncoupled enzyme, superoxide scavenges
  nitric oxide (NO) leading to the peroxynitrite formation. Peroxynitrite (1) oxidizes
  BH4, resulting in the eNOS uncoupling and perpetual superoxide production and subsequent
  peroxynitrite formation; (2) oxidizes low-density lipoproteins (LDL) forming oxidized
  LDL (ox-LDL) which in turn through the scavenger receptor, lectin-like oxidized
  low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), downregulate the enzyme expression.
  Furthermore, ox-LDL stimulate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase
  (NADPH oxidase) and xanthine oxidase to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
  excess and increase arginase activity leading to reduction in L-arginine availability
  for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and subsequent eNOS uncoupling and impaired NO generation.
  Moreover, arginase via increased formation of polyamines and L-proline stimulates
  vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, thereby
  contributing to intimal hyperplasia and remodeling processes; (3) nitrosylates the
  cationic amino acid transporter, therefore inhibiting the L-arginine transport in
  endothelial cells and increasing the rate of arginine efflux; (4) increases the
  activity of protein-arginine methyl transferase (PRMTs) and inhibits that of dimethylarginine
  dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), resulting in elevated ADMA levels, which in turn
  via inhibition of NO synthesis and eNOS uncoupling enhance production of ROS. Oxidative
  stress in turn upregulates ADMA levels; (5) through activation of transcription
  factor, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) induces
  expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), arginase, and inflammatory
  and immune genes (cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, acute phase proteins,
  regulators of apoptosis, and cell proliferation) potentiating inflammation via further
  recruitment of adaptive and innate immune cells and ROS generation, leading to persistence
  of inflammation and disease progression. Abbreviations: eNOS: endothelial nitric
