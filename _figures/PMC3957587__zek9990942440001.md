caption: Pal/Rim signaling cascades in Aspergillus nidulans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
  and Candida albicans. External pH sensing involves the plasma membrane complex,
  comprising PalH/Rim21-Dfg16 and its assistant, PalI/Rim9, an arrestin-like protein
  PalF/Rim8, and PalC/Rim23. At alkaline-neutral pH, the plasma membrane complex is
  endocytosed through PalF/Rim8 ubiquitination, which triggers interactions with the
  ESCRT complexes involved in the multivesicular body endocytic pathway. Vps32, a
  key component of ESCRT-III, interacts with PalC/Rim23 and PalA/Rim20. PalA/Rim20
  in conjunction with PalB/Rim13 (the signaling protease) are members of the endosomal
  signaling complex and recruit PacC/Rim101. PalB/Rim13 mediates the cytoplasmic proteolysis
  of the full-length PacC/Rim101. In A. nidulans, a second processing event occurs
  independently of PalB. In all species, whether PalI/Rim9 is endocytosed together
  with PalC/Rim23, PalH/Rim21, and PalF/Rim8 has not been demonstrated. In C. albicans,
  the role of Vps23 has not been described. Also in C. albicans, Rim8 is not ubiquitinated
  but hyperphosphorylated and it associates with Rim21 and Rim101, suggesting a role
  in bridging the cortical and the endosomal signaling complexes.
