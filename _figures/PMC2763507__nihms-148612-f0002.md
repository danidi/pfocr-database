caption: The biosynthetic pathway for glutamate involves synthesis from glucose and
  the transamination of α-ketoglutarate; however, a small proportion of glutamate
  is formed more directly from glutamine by glutamine synthetase. The latter is synthesized
  in glia and, via an active process (requiring ATP), is transported to neurons where
  glutaminase converts this precursor to glutamate. In astrocytes, glutamine is oxidized
  to α-ketoglutarate which can also be transported to neurons and participate in glutamate
  synthesis. Glutamate is either metabolized or it is sequestered and stored in secretory
  vesicles by vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluTs). Glutamate is then released
  by a calcium-dependent excitotoxic process. Once released from the presynaptic terminal,
  glutamate binds to many excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors, including ionotropic
  (e.g. AMPA and NMDA) and metabotropic receptors. Presynaptic regulation of glutamate
  release occurs through metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3), which act as
  autoreceptors. However, these receptors are also located on the postsynaptic element.
  The action of glutamate is terminated in the synapse by reuptake mechanisms that
  utilize distinct transporters (GLUTs) which exist on presynaptic nerve terminals
  and astrocytes. Current data indicate that astrocytic uptake of glutamate might
  be more important for clearing excess glutamate, raising the possibility that astrocytic
  loss (as documented in mood disorders) might contribute to deleterious glutamate
  signaling. It is known that there several intracellular proteins alter the function
  of glutamate receptors (see diagram).
