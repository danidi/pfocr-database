caption: CoA=coenzyme A. PDH=pyruvate dehydrogenase. PFK=phosphofructokinase. G6P=glucose-6-phosphate.
  HK=hexokinase. Red circle with minus sign represents inhibition. Black line with
  arrowhead represents increase or accumulation of substrate. Blue dotted line with
  arrowhead indicates a pathway that is inhibited.
