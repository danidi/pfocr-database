caption: 'The canonical and non-canonical JAK-STAT pathway and its subversion by BCR-ABL
  or mutant KIT. Cytokine receptors, devoid of any tyrosine kinase activity, are constitutively
  linked to members of the JAK protein family. JAK kinases are cytoplasmic kinases
  where many cancer driver mutations of constitutively active JAK kinases have been
  mapped acting in a similar fashion like cytoplasmic fusion kinases such as BCR-ABL1
  or the transforming membrane TK mutant KIT D816V. Upon activation of the cytokine
  receptor by ligand binding, conformational changes occur in the intracytoplasmic
  tail of the receptor, leading to activation of JAKs by auto- and transphosphorylation.
  Activated JAKs phosphorylate many substrates, among which are also the essential
  STAT proteins. Parallel STAT dimers are thought to be efficiently transported into
  the cell nucleus viaassociating with importins, bind then to specific DNA sequences
  and to activate the transcription through many cell type specific protein partners
  on target gene regulatory loci. This canonical pathway can be diverted in the presence
  of mutant KIT receptors (particularly, but not only KIT D816V), or by BCR-ABL1,
  both oncogenic proteins being able to phosphorylate STAT5 without JAK involvement
  (red arrows) by direct tyrosine phosphorylation via their kinase domain. This cascade
  of signalization is negatively regulated by at least three different families of
  proteins: protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs: SHP, CD45, PTP1B/TC-PTP and overall
  poorly studied), SOCSs (suppressors of cytokine signaling: CIS, SOCS1–SOCS3) or
  PIAS proteins (protein inhibitors of activated stats). PTPs dephosphorylate and
  recycle STAT5, while SOCS and CIS proteins bind either to the STAT5 activating receptors
  or they bind rather to the TKs. STATs are also negatively regulated by protein inhibitors
  of activated STAT (PIASs), which act in the nucleus through several mechanisms.
  For example, PIAS1 and PIAS3 inhibit transcriptional activation by STAT1 and STAT3,
  respectively, by binding and blocking access to the DNA sequences they recognize.
  Moreover, two non-canonical pSTAT5 cytoplasmic retention systems were found to be
  present in CML and/or neoplastic MCs, namely pSTAT5 retention by SRC and HCK kinases
  or docking to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K via the GAB2 scaffold protein that
  controls then AKT signaling. These cytoplasmic retention systems might block nuclear
  accumulation of pSTAT5, keeping STAT5-mediated transcription at bay.'
