caption: 'Cell polarity pathways are targeted by diverse human viruses.Interplay between
  the Scribble (SCRIB), PAR, and Crumbs (CRB) complexes is central to the control
  of cell polarity. These link to the TJ and AJs that control cell–cell contacts,
  and to the Wnt signaling pathway, through the SCRIB complex and cadherins. The CRB
  complex links to cell growth and proliferation through the Hippo signaling pathway
  and YAP/TAZ. The SCRIB complex also links to apoptotic pathways through β-PIX, and
  to growth factor signaling-induced proliferation through ERK, and to interferon-activated
  innate immune responses through STAT activation. The virus proteins are indicated
  by hexagons: red for cancer-associated virus proteins or blue for non-cancer causing.'
