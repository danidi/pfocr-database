caption: Regulation of fungal secondary metabolism by transcriptional regulatory elements.
  SM gene clusters are often silent in laboratory conditions. Activation of SM clusters
  is complex and involves several layers of transcriptional regulators from pathway
  specific regulators to more global regulators such as bZip proteins, StuA and Velvet
  (LaeA, VeA and VelB) and Hap-like complexes. This activation is associated with
  conversion of heterochromatin marks (silent cluster) to euchromatin marks (active
  cluster). In addition, environmental stimuli are translated by signal transduction
  cascades, including MAPK and PkaA, to activate SM synthesis.
