caption: Potential beneficial effects of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) inhibition
  on inflammation in patients with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Administration of
  a peripheral KMO inhibitor might modulate the immune response in COVID-19 by further
  increasing levels of l-kynurenine (l-KYN) in the periphery. Increased l-KYN can
  reduce inflammation by suppressing the proliferation of CD4+ T cells and promoting
  the differentiation of naïve T cells into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.
  Inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) in the periphery could lead to increased
  levels of l-KYN and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the central nervous system (CNS) because
  l-KYN can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Brain-permeable KMO inhibitors might
  be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 because KMO inhibition in the CNS results
  in increased levels of KYNA, which is neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory. Brain-permeable
  KMO inhibitors might also inhibit peripheral KMO, resulting in increased levels
  of l-KYN and KYNA in the periphery. KMO inhibition in the CNS might reduce the production
  of cytotoxic kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites, such as 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK),
  preventing neuronal cell death.
