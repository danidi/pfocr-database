caption: IPA Network. Ingenuity pathway analyses suggest a common network among miR-130b-3p
  and PCOS GWAS candidate genes DENND1A, LHCGR, and RAB5B and various signaling pathways
  in normal and PCOS theca cells that regulate androgen biosynthesis. We present a
  diagram of the resulting IPA network among miR-130b-3p, DENND1A (dark purple), and
  the two other PCOS GWAS candidates (i.e., LHCGR and RAB5B) and the signaling component
  MAPK1, which were predicted to be targets of miR-130b-3p and were previously reported
  to contribute to a PCOS theca cell phenotype. IPA core pathway and network analyses
  also identified several signaling pathway components [protein kinase A (Pka) and
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)]; transcription factors (GATA4/6), previously
  reported to be associated with augmented CYP17A1, CYP11A1, and HSD3B2 gene expression
  (red); and excess androgen production in PCOS theca cells. The resulting theca cell
  cellular network provides an illustration of the possible mechanism(s) by which
  decreased miR-130b-3p in PCOS theca cells may mediate the PCOS GWAS candidates DENND1A,
  LHCGR, and RAB5B, in addition to their associated signaling components and transcription
  factors, resulting in increased CYP17A1, CYP11A1, and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (HSD3B2) gene expression and hyperandrogenism in PCOS theca cells. INS, insulin;
  LHB, luteinizing hormone β.
