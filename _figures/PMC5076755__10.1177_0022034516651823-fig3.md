caption: Regulation of parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP)/Indian hedgehog
  (Ihh) signaling and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) signaling on cranial
  synchondrosis development. (A) PTHrP can maintain chondrocyte proliferation and
  inhibit their hypertrophic differentiation. Ihh promotes chondrocyte proliferation
  and maturation and also stimulates PTHrP expression. It is unclear whether Ihh stimulates
  PTHrP expression as in the growth plate of long bones. (B) Active mutation of FGFR3
  suppresses chondrocyte proliferation and down-regulates expression of the PTHrP
  receptor and Ihh. Premature fusion of synchondroses in FGFR3 mutant mice may be
  mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
