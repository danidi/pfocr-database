caption: Potential ways in which LRRK2 and α-synuclein act in PD. (A) LRRK2 and α-synuclein
  affect each other through a direct physical interaction. (B) LRRK2 and α-synuclein
  affect each other through an indirect physical interaction in which a mediator(s),
  such as a molecular chaperone(s), links the two proteins. (C) Both LRRK2 and α-synuclein
  act synergistically on targets within the same molecular pathway without interacting
  with each other. (D) LRRK2 and α-synuclein do not interact at all and each affect
  targets in distinct molecular pathways.
