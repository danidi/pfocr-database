caption: 'FRC development is incompletely defined, but a series of crucial checkpoints
  have been identified.a | Lymph node anlagen specification. Retinoic acid, likely
  provided by adjacent neurons, is required for lymph node anlage specification of
  retinoic acid receptor + mesenchymal precursors at the site, which develop into
  CXCL13+ early LTo-committed stromal precursor cells.b | Pre-adipocyte precursors.
  LTβR signalling is a molecular switch that drives lymph node stromal cell development
  at the expense of adipocyte development. The migration of pre-adipocytes to the
  lymph node site is augmented by CXCR4. On arrival, these cells upregulate CXCL13
  to become early LTo-committed stromal precursor cells.c | Early LTos differentiate
  into primed LTos when then begin to express low levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Signals
  involved in this differentiation step are unknown, but precursors do not require
  ILCs or LTβR signalling to proceed to this stage.d | The development of ICAM-1hi
  VCAM-1hi LTo cells requires cross talk with ILC3s via RANK and lymphotoxin signals.
  Rorc-/- mice, which lack ILC3s, do not develop lymph nodes. There is a partial block
  in lymph node development in mice lacking CXCL13, CXCR5 and IL-7R, and a complete
  block in CXCR5-/- CCR7-/- mice,, ,,. RANK signalling to ILC3s is a crucial checkpoint,
  inducing the upregulation of LTα1β2. LTβR signalling induces early lymphoid tissue
  organiser cells to differentiate to a mature form, and is a crucial checkpoint for
  lymph node development. Mice with blocks in this signalling pathway develop anlagen
  and early LTo cells but not lymph nodes,,.e| It is hypothesised that early FRC precursor
  cells develop directly from differentiated LTos, but this has not been formally
  demonstrated. Interactions between PDPN and CLEC2 are a crucial checkpoint for FRC
  development,, as Pdpn-/- and Clec1b-/- develop anlage but no lymph nodes. It is
  unclear exactly where this block lies, but it is prior to the development of FRC
  precursors. The source of CLEC2 is undefined.f | The development of mature FRCs
  from immature FRC precursors requires lymphotoxin signalling. Lymph nodes lacking
  the NF-κB2 signalling pathway (Relb-/-, Nfkb2-/- and Ikka-/- lymph nodes) are present,
  but hypoplastic and B cell deficient,, which indicates that the canonical NF-κB
  signalling pathway may partly compensate for loss of LTβR. The loss of LTβR from
  LTo cells at the point of CCL19 upregulation allows for the development of lymph
  nodes and FRC precursors, but blocks late-stage FRC development, thus identifying
  immediate FRC precurors. In humans and some primates, but not mice, CD4+ T cells
  are a crucial source of LT ligands.Abbreviations: CLEC2: c-type lectin receptor
