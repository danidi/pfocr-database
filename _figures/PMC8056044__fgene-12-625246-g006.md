caption: Illustration of neuronal and astrocytic pathways implicated in the disease
  according to the top scoring genes according to our integrated ranking. (A) Loss
  of signal from BDNF to PFN1 downregulates the activity of the gene, impairing F-actin
  structure in the neuron and astrocyte. (B) IQSEC1 mediates AMPAR and NMDAR receptor
  internalization. (C) PAK2 activity is partially regulated by the CDC42 GTPase which
  is activated by binding of the SLIT protein to ROBO at the membrane. This activity
  can be interrupted by the activity of SRGAP1 which inhibits ROBO signaling. (D)
  ENAH can bind to both ROBO and Fe65. When bound to ROBO it acts to inhibit actin
  polymerization and motility, but while bound to Fe65 and the AICD the ROBO pathway
  functions normally, promoting cell motility, and actin polymerization. (E) PRKCSH
  co-localizes with IP3Rs increasing calcium current through the channels, increasing
  cytosolic levels of Ca2+. (F) UBE2J2 and MOGS are both involved in the proper regulation
  of intra-ER processes. Impairment of the proper activity of post-translational modification
  by MOGS could drive ERAD mediated by ubiquitination by UBE2J2. (G) EDF1 is also
  a transcriptional regulator for PPAR-gamma. Activation of PPAR-gamma helps to regulate
  disturbed metabolic states and A plaque clearance. (H) HDAC3 regulates transcription
  of many genes that have an effect on Aβ burden, microglial activation, and dendritic
  spine density.
