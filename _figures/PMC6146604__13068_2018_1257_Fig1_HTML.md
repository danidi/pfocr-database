caption: Lignin biosynthesis. The red box shows the pentose phosphate pathway, the
  orange box shows the shikimate pathway and the synthesis of the aromatic amino acid
  phenylalanine, the green box shows the general phenylpropanoid pathway and the blue box
  shows the monolignol specific pathway. Dotted arrows indicate more than one (enzymatic)
  conversion. In blue are the mutant alleles studied, in green 5-hydroxyconiferyl
  alcohol, that upon incorporation in lignin, gives rise to 5-hydroxyguaiacyl units.
