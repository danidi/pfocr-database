caption: Regulatory complex for autophagy induction. Tor kinase regulates the induction
  of autophagy upon sensing the nutrient conditions. Atg1 kinase, which is essential
  for both autophagy and the Cvt pathway, forms a complex with several proteins that
  are characterized as being preferentially involved in the Cvt pathway (in white
  circles) or autophagy (in dark gray circle). Under nutrient-rich conditions, Tor
  kinase is active, and Atg13 is hyperphosphorylated. This highly phosphorylated Atg13
  has a lower affinity for Atg1 and Atg17, and autophagy is downregulated. Under starvation
  conditions, Tor is inactive and Atg13 is hypophosphorylated. Dephosphorylated Atg13
  interacts with Atg1 and Atg17 with a higher affinity. The enhancement of the formation
  of the Atg1-Atg13-Atg17 complex mediates the induction of autophagy. The Atg20-Atg24
  complex, Atg11, and Vac8 might also belong to this complex, but a complete holo-complex
  as depicted has not been identified
