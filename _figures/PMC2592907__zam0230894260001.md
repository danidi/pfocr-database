caption: Pathway for the biosynthesis of ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine. The biosynthetic
  route for the production of ectoine is shown; it is taken from the proposals made
  by Louis and Galinski () and Ono et al. (). The enzymes responsible for ectoine
  biosynthesis are l-2,4-diaminobutyrate transaminase (EctB), l-2,4-diaminobutyrate
  acetyltransferase (EctA), and ectoine synthase (EctC). The enzymatic conversion
  of ectoine into 5-hydroxyectoine by the EctD protein (ectoine hydroxylase) is based
  on results obtained by Bursy et al. ().
