caption: 'Regulation of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine homeostasis. Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAMe) content is regulated by the concerted activity of methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT) and glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT). Methionine is mainly metabolized by
  the liver where is converted to SAMe by the enzyme MAT using ATP as co-substrate.
  SAMe, the main cellular methyl donor, is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
  by a legion of methyltransferases (MTs) that catalyze the methylation of multiple
  substrates (DNA, proteins, phospholipids, small molecules, toxic and waist products).
  Excess SAMe is catabolized by GNMT, the most abundant hepatic MT, to prevent undesirable
  methylations. The GNMT-sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH) pathway recycles the excess
  of methyl groups via generation of methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF) and the
  methylation of homocysteine to regenerate methionine (not shown) to maintain SAMe
  homeostasis. SAH is converted to homocysteine, a metabolic crossroad that can be
  used for the regeneration of methionine (not shown) or the synthesis of glutathione
  depending on whether the concentration of SAMe is low or high, respectively. SAMe
  is an allosteric activator of GNMT and an inhibitor of the re-synthesis of methionine
  via the CH2-THF pathway (broken lines). CH2-THF: 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate;
  Gly: Glycine; GNMT: Glycine N-methyltransferase; MAT: Methionine adenosyltransferase;
