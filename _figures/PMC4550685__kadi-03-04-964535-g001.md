caption: Intracellular pathways of factors regulating adipogenesis, lipogenesis and
  lipolysis in the adipocyte. To simplify, only mechanisms that are primary targets
  of maternal nutrition manipulations have been represented. Triglycerides (TG) circulate
  in blood in the form of lipoproteins. Free fatty acids (FFA) that are released from
  lipoproteins, catalyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), diffuse into the adipocyte.
  Intracellular FFA are converted to fatty acyl-CoA, and are then re-esterified to
  form TG using glycerol-3 phosphate (glycerol-3P) that is generated from glucose
  metabolism. FFAs may also originate from acetyl-CoA (de novo lipogenesis) driven
  by the lipogenic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS).
  Lipolysis occurs via a cAMP-mediated cascade, which results in the phosphorylation
  of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), an enzyme which hydrolyzes TG into FFA and glycerol.
  These FFA are then free to diffuse into the blood. Leptin binding to its receptor
  (Ob-Rb) induces activation of Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), receptor dimerization,
  JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of intracellular part of Ob-Rb, phosphorylation and
  activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Activated
  STAT3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to transactivate target genes. Insulin
  binding to its receptor (InsR) induces receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation, activation
  of insulin receptor substrates (IRSs)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
  kinase B (Akt/PKB) signaling pathways. Leptin and insulin action is both linked
  to the common PI3K signaling pathway. Insulin enhances the storage of fat as TG
  by increasing LPL and lipogenic enzyme activities. It also facilitates the transport
  of glucose by stimulating GLUT4 glucose transporter. In addition, phosphorylation
  and activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases 3B (PDE3B) is a key event
  in the antilipolytic action of insulin, decreasing cAMP level in adipocyte. In contrast,
  leptin presents anti-lipogenic effects by suppressing expression and activity of
  lipogenic enzymes (i.e., fatty acid synthase [FAS]). Both hormones may also activate
  adipogenesis. Adipogenesis is driven by the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic
  transcription factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ),
  CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα, β, γ), the sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1c (SREBP1c) as well as the expression of specific lipid-metabolizing enzymes
  such as FAS. Noradrenaline released from the sympathetic autonomic nervous system
  binds β-adrenoreceptor (β-AR) and activates lipolysis. Glucocorticoids (GC) bind
  intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and/or mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
  and can also modulate adipogenesis and/or lipogenesis. This may be due either to
  an increase in circulating GC and/or to an increase in adipose tissue 11β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity that amplifies local GC actions by converting
  inactive GC metabolites (11-dehydrocorticosterone, 11DHC) to active GC (corticosterone)
  (in rodents) or inactive cortisone to active cortisol (in humans). 11β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) that degrades active GC to inactive metabolites
  is also found in adipose tissue.
