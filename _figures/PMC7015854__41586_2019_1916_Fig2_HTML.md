caption: 'a, Genome-based metabolic reconstruction of MK-D1. Metabolic pathways identified
  (coloured or black) and not identified (grey) are shown. For identified pathways,
  each step (solid line) or process (dotted) is marked by whether it is oxidative
  (red), reductive (blue), ATP-yielding (orange) or ATP-consuming (purple). Wavy arrows
  indicate exchange of compounds: formate, H2, amino acids, vitamin B12, biotin, lipoate
  and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which are predicted to be metabolized or synthesized
  by the partnering Halodesulfovibrio and/or Methanogenium. Biosynthetic pathways
  are indicated with a yellow background. Metatranscriptomics-detected amino-acid-catabolizing
  pathways are indicated (black dots above amino acids). DHDH, 4,5-dihydroxy-2,6-dioxohexanoate;
  DHDG, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-d-gluconate; DHDG6P, 3-dehydro-3-deoxy-d-gluconate 6-phosphate;
  Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA; uro, urocanate; Fo-Glu, formyl glutamate; CH3=H4F, methylene-tetrahydrofolate;
  CH≡H4F, methenyl-tetrahydrofolate; Fo-H4F, formyl-tetrahydrofolate; 2OB, 2-oxobutyrate;
  Prop-CoA, propionyl-CoA; ACAC, acetoacetate; GB-CoA, γ-amino-butyryl-CoA; But-CoA,
  butyryl-CoA; Fd, ferredoxin; XSH/X-S-S-X, thiol/disulfide pair; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; PPP, pentose-phosphate pathway. b–e, NanoSIMS analysis of a highly purified
  MK-D1 culture incubated with a mixture of 13C- and 15N-labelled amino acids. b,
  Green fluorescent micrograph of SYBR Green I-stained cells. Aggregates are MK-D1,
  and filamentous cells are Methanobacterium sp. strain MO-MB1 (fluorescence can be
  weak owing to the high rigidity and low permeability of the cell membrane (Extended
  Data Fig. ; see also ref. ). c, NanoSIMS ion image of 12C (cyan). d, NanoSIMS ion
  image of 12C15N/12C14N (magenta). e, Overlay image of b–d. d, The colour bar indicates
  the relative abundance of 15N expressed as 15N/14N. Scale bars 5 μm. The NanoSIMS
  analysis was performed without replicates due to its slow growth rate and low cell
  density. However, to ensure the reproducibility, we used two different types of
  highly purified cultures of MK-D1 (see ). Representative of n = 8 recorded images.
  The iTAG analysis of the imaged culture is shown in Supplementary Table .'
