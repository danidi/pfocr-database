caption: DAMPs recognition by C-type lectin-like receptors and signaling pathways
  C-type lectin-like receptors (CLRs) of the “Dectin family” recognize not only pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs), but also various self-derived ligands such as damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs). This recognition triggers activation of immune-receptor
  tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), leading to the recruitment and activation
  of SYK family kinases. Subsequent activation of the Card9–Bcl10–Malt1 complex through
  SYK induces NF-κB activation and gene transcription of various chemokines and cytokine
  (CLEC4E alias MINCLE). Alternatively, CLEC4E can also signal through PLCγ2 to induce
  the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Alternatively, immune response can be regulated through
  increase of ROS and IL-1β production (CLEC8A) modifying gene expression and releasing
  ROS to the extracellular matrix. By contrast, activation of immune-receptor tyrosine-based
  inhibition motif (ITIM) induces the recruitment and activation of protein tyrosine
  phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 and the dephosphorylation of activation motifs
  to inhibit cellular activation mediated by other pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)
  (CLEC12A). CLEC9A, via Hemi-ITAM (HITAM) plays a key role in CD8+ T cell cross-priming.
  In addition, CLEC9A can activate SHP-1 to exert inhibitory feedback and restrain
  excessive immune response.
