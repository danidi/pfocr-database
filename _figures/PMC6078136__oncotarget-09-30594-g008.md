caption: EGFR is transactivated by PAR2 agonists, and EGFR activation increases TF
  expression. TF-FVIIa binary complex mediates the activation of PAR2, revealing the
  presence of a positive feedback loop. EGFR transactivation by PAR2 agonists upregulates
  COX2 expression. COX2-derived PGE2 also transactivates EGFR in several models, suggesting
  a second positive feedback. In this way, EGFR may be the central pillar of different
  signaling circuits promoted by GPCRs, inducing chemoresistance. Thus, EGFR, PAR2
  and COX2 emerge as novel targets for the treatment of cervical cancer.
