caption: A. Bladder. Shh derived from bladder epithelium, upregulated in response
  to injury, activates Gli transcription factors in the bladder stroma, which induce
  transcription of secreted factors including proliferative factors (Wnt2/4) and differentiative
  factors (Bmp4/5) that regulate the activity of epithelial stem cells.B. Mammary
  gland. Tgfβ produced by mammary epithelial cells induces expression in adjacent
  stromal cells of the major Hedgehog pathway transcriptional effector, Gli2. Gli2
  in turn activates transcription of receptors for the mammatrophic hormones estrogen
  and growth hormone (Esr1, Ghr), thereby entraining the niche to regulation by mammatrophic
  hormones that control pubertal growth. The targets that respond to Gli2 and/or mammatrophic
  hormones include a set of secreted paracrine signals (Wnt2, Igf1, Hgf, Fgf7, Bmp7),
  some of which are known to support mammary epithelial stem cell proliferation/renewal,
  and others likely to play roles in differentiation and ductal morphogenesis.
