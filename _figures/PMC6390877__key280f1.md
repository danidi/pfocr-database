caption: 'Structural simplicity of the JAK–STAT signalling pathwayAfter the engagement
  of cytokine receptors constitutively bound to JAK, JAK is activated and in turn
  phosphorylates the cytokine receptors, resulting in phosphorylation of STAT, which
  subsequently translocate into the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression. Different
  from other kinase such as MAPK and NF-kB, such a structural simplicity of the JAK–STAT
  signalling pathway may lead to the simplicity of tolerable safety and marked efficacy
  of the JAK inhibitors, which have led to the success of their development. JAK:
  Janus kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB;
  STAT: signal transducers and activators of transcription.'
