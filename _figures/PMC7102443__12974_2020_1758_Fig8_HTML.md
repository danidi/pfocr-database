caption: Pleiotropic functions of Htt in the TLR-4 signal transduction system in BMMCs.
  Upon LPS stimulus, TLR-4 is translocated to the perinuclear area in Htt-containing
  vesicles by a mechanism depending on the activity of dynamin. This process leads
  to the activation of the ERK1/2-ELK-1 signaling pathway, which is involved in the
  accumulation of c-fos and TNF mRNAs, along with the secretion of TNF via TACE activation.
  The expression of mHtt in BMMCs not only impairs the ERK1/2 signaling cascade, but
  also decreases IKK phosphorylation, which has been associated with the phosphorylation
  of SNAP23 and TNF secretion upon TLR-4 triggering in this cell type. Anaphylactic
  degranulation triggered by FcεRI seems to be independent on the function of Htt
