caption: The Shh signaling pathway. Hedgehog ligands, such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh),
  bind to and inhibit the Patched receptor on the cell surface. The binding prevents
  Patched from antagonizing a second transmembrane protein, Smoothened. Once activated,
  Smoothened regulates the Gli transcription factors through a mechanism that is poorly
  understood. Active Smoothened prevents of the generation of the Gli transcriptional
  repressor forms (GliRep) and promotes the activity of the Gli activator forms (GliAct).
  The IFT machinery acts in several different ways. For example, kinesin II and the
  complex B IFT proteins are required for GliAct function and for the formation of
  GliRep, whereas complex A IFT proteins such as Ift122 are required to restrict GliAct
  function in the absence of ligands.
