caption: Requirement of the Arf6-based mesenchymal pathway in both mesenchymal-type
  and amoeboid-type cancer invasion. Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including
  those for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), as well
  as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), are known
  to activate RhoA and Rac1 to promote cancer invasiveness; in which RhoA is preferentially
  required for amoeboid-type invasion, whereas Rac1 is required for mesenchymal-type
  invasion. We show that the Arf6-AMAP1-EPB41L5 pathway, activated either by EGF or
  by LPA, is essential for both mesenchymal-type and amoeboid-type invasion. EPB41L5
  is a mesenchymal-specific protein primarily induced by ZEB1 in breast cancer. ZEB1,
  as well as EPB41L5, are also necessary for both mesenchymal-type and amoeboid-type
  invasion. We propose that, for cancer therapeutics, blocking Arf6, such as by inhibition
  of the mevalonate pathway, might be more effective than blocking RhoA or Rac1. It
  should be noted that blocking Arf6 may also effectively decrease the drug resistance
  of cancer cells, if cells overexpress the Arf6-based pathway (see text).
