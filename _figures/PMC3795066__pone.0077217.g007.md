caption: 'In plants, CKs are synthesized mainly through two pathways, namely cis-zeatin
  (cZ) biosynthesis and trans-zeatin (tZ) biosynthesis. Dimethylallyl diphosphate
  (DMAPP) is the common substrate for both pathways and is formed through isomerization
  of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), catalyzed by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase
  (IPI). Trans-zeatin biosynthesis, which is the main pathway for cytokinin synthesis
  in most plants, produces isopentenyladenine (iP)-type and tZ-type CKs. Adenylate
  isopentenyltransferases (IPT) catalyze the reaction between DMAPP and AMP/ADP/ATP
  to produce iP-nucleotides, which are then converted to tZ-nucleotides by cytokinin
  trans-hydroxylase (CYP735A). For ABA biosynthesis, farnesyl diphosphate synthase
  (FPS) catalyzes the synthesis of the isoprenoid precursors from both IPP and DMAPP
  and xanthoxin dehydrogenase (XD) catalyzes the last step in ABA formation. The up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes in paulownia after PaWB Phytoplasma infection are indicated
  in red and green, respectively. cZR: cZ riboside, GPP: geranyl diphosphate, FPP:
