caption: The suppression of antitumor immunity activated by the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
  in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of lung cancers. The core of this network is
  tumor-specific T cells. The PD-1 protein is expressed both on activated T cells
  by the combination of major histocompatibility (MHC) complex with T cell receptor
  (TCR), and also exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex). PD-L1 is expressed on various immune
  cells and stromal cells in TME. The engagement of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway facilitates
  the transformation of Texs and the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg).
  Meanwhile, the secretion of IFN-γ by infiltrating immune cells mentioned in the
  figure upgrades the expression of the PD-L1 protein.
