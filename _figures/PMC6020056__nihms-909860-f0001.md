caption: 'The complement cascades. (a) The three pathways of complement activation
  are shown. Although each is independently triggered, they all merge at the step
  of C3 activation. The classical pathway (CP) is initiated by the binding of antibody
  (Ab) to antigen (Ag) and the lectin pathway (LP) by the binding of lectin to an
  oligosaccharide. The alternative pathway (AP) turns over continuously, generating
  small amounts of 3(H2O) (the thioester-hydrolyzed form of C3) and C3b, which it
  amplifies in the presence of pathogens or injured tissue. C3(H2O) behaves like C3b
  in that it can bind factor B (FB) to initiate the AP (see below). Activation of
  the complement system leads to inflammation (release of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a),
  opsonization (the coating of targets with C3b and/or C4b), and membrane perturbation
  (formation of the membrane attack complex, MAC). (b) The AP’s feedback loop of complement
  activation. First, C3b attaches to the surface of a target, such as a pathogen or
  self-debris. Next, C3b binds to FB, and then factor D (FD) cleaves FB to form the
  AP C3 convertase (i.e., an enzyme that cleaves C3 to C3b). This convertase is stabilized
  by the binding of properdin (P). The C3 convertase triggers the amplification loop
  via the generation of more C3b. The initial C3b can be generated by the CP and LP
  or tick over [formation of C3(H2O), which can also bind FB to trigger the AP]. Abbreviations:
