caption: Proposed differences in fatty acid oxidation pathways between low (LBW) and
  normal birth weight (NBW) individuals. LBW individuals may have an increased beta‐oxidation
  in mitochondria of skeletal muscle (upper panel) and liver (bottom panel) that is
  not matched by an equivalently increased TCA cycle flux, resulting in an accumulation
  of acetyl‐CoA in the mitochondrial matrix and following of acetylcarnitine in the
  cytosol. Also, an excess of acetyl‐CoA could lead to an increased ketogenesis in
  the liver and following an accumulation of 3‐hydroxy‐butyrylcarnitine (not shown).
  Furthermore, LBW individuals may have an increased omega‐oxidation in the endoplasmic
  reticulum of the liver along with an increased beta‐oxidation of dicarboxyl‐fatty
  acids in peroxisomes, leading to an accumulation of hydroxyl‐ and dicarboxyl‐acylcarnitine
  species. Omega‐oxidation may be a scavenger pathway for oxidation of fatty acids
  that otherwise could be available for synthesis of lipotoxic lipid species such
  as ceramides and diacylglycerols that impair insulin signaling.
