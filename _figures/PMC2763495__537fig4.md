caption: The AMPK–p53 pathway in metabolic adaptation. Activation of the tumor suppressor
  p53 by AMPK promotes physiological adaptation to metabolic stress by multiple mechanisms.
  AMPK-dependent p53 activation negatively regulates cell cycle progression via the
  cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21. Impairment of glycolytic flux by TIGAR,
  combined with increased activation of β-oxidation and electron transport through
  expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase Ic (Cpt1c) and SCO2, respectively,
  results in a p53-dependent metabolic shift toward OXPHOS. Transcriptional regulation
  of DRAM by p53 induces autophagy, the products of which can also fuel OXPHOS.
