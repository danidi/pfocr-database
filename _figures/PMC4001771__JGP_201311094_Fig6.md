caption: Proposed mechanism for the UVR phototransduction cascade in HEMs. (A) UVR
  stimulates a G protein–coupled receptor in a retinal-dependent manner, and leads
  to activation of Gαq/11 and PLCβ, which hydrolyzes PIP2 into DAG and IP3. PIP2 hydrolysis
  regulates the activity of TRPA1 at the plasma membrane to mediate Ca2+ influx, whereas
  IP3 activates IP3R to mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The increase
  in intracellular Ca2+ leads to early melanin synthesis. (B) Predicted contribution
  of IP3R- and TRPA1-mediated Ca2+ responses to UVR-induced Ca2+signaling kinetics.
  IP3R contributes to the rapid initial increase in Ca2+, whereas TRPA1 contributes
  to sustained Ca2+ influx.
