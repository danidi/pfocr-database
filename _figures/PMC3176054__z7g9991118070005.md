caption: Proposed model of early pathologic events occurring in the lacrimal glands
  of C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 male mice defined by changes in gene expression. (a) Pre-autoimmune
  phase turnover of interepithelial junctions of lacrimal glands, with the migration
  of leukocytes into the glands to form lymphocytic foci, a hallmark biomarker of
  SjS. The interepithelial junctions, consisting of tight junctions, gap junctions,
  adherens, desmosomes, and focal adhesions, maintain cell-cell homeostasis and tissue
  integrity and at the same time tightly regulate solute movement through the paracellular
  spaces. Cellular emigration between cells requires changes in the interepithelial
  junctions, opening a pathway for cells to move through the tissues. The present
  study has shown changes in gene expression for proteins within each of the molecular
  complexes composing the interepithelial junctions. Of special interest for future
  studies are changes in the desmosomes and ZO molecules because of their associated
  signaling pathways. (b) Model of FA maturation during the early changes in lacrimal
  gland homeostasis of SjS-predisposed C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice. Integrins represent
  the principal cell surface adhesion receptors mediating cell-ECM adhesion plus lateral
  association with cell surface proteins that, in turn, provide bidirectional signaling
  across membranes. Integrin clustering occurs through ECM contact, an event that
  initiates intracellular aggregation of signaling molecules that then activate nonreceptor
  tyrosine kinases and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins subsequently
  recruited to the integrin-ECM adhesion. The specific makeup of the integrin-binding
  proteins such as talin, adapter molecules such as paxillin or vinculin, and enzymes
  such as Src that are subsequently recruited, determines the downstream function.
  In the present study, the differentially expressed genes suggest cell emigration
  and contractility, consistent with the immunohistochemical staining of lacrimal
  gland tissue during the development of disease.
