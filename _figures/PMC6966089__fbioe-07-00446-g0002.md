caption: 'The methanol condensation cycle (MCC) for assimilation of methanol into
  higher alcohol with maximal carbon conservation. The MCC is a combination of the
  RuMP with part of the NOG allowing to avoid pyruvate decarboxylation and to bypass
  ATP dependency. It results in the net production of acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) from 2 methanol.
  Here, it is represented the metabolic pathway leading to the production of n-butanol
  which requires 4 methanol. Enzymes abbreviations are: Medh, NAD+-dependent methanol
  dehydrogenase; Hps, hexulose-6P synthase; Phi, phosphohexuloseisomerase; Tkt, transketolase,
  Fxkp, F6P/Xu5P phosphoketolase; Tal, transaldolase; Rpe, ribulose-5-P epimerase;
  Rpi, ribose-5-isomerase. Abbreviation for metabolites as in .'
