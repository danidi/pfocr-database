caption: A model of the modulation of LRRK2 by arsenite and H2O2. LRRK2 is constitutively
  phosphorylated at Ser910/Ser935, and its kinase activity can modulate this through
  a signal loop pathway involving other kinases, whereas phosphorylation is inhibited
  by kinase inhibition. Arsenite or H2O2 induces the loss of Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation
  through PP1 in signaling events independent of the kinase activity of LRRK2. This
  induces dissociation from 14-3-3 and mobilization promoting formation of LRRK2 dimers
  that may be assembled into larger protein complexes. Modulation of its dimerization
  is linked to altered GTP binding and influences substrate binding and kinase activity.
  Oxidative stress signaling ultimately controls the balance between activation of
  LRRK2 and the removal of LRRK2 protein by UPS.
