caption: Mechanism of radiation-induced bystander effects. IR activates the intercellular
  signal transduction pathway in targeted cells, one of which is NF-κB, and bystander
  factors are secreted into the medium. They stimulate transcription of genes, including
  COX-2 and iNOS, whose products then augment synthesis of ROS and NO, thereby perpetuating
  bystander responses. Bystander signals are also transmitted to the neighboring cells
  through GJIC. COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; GJIC, gap-junctional intercellular communication;
  IL, interleukin; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; IR, ionizing radiation;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the
