caption: 'For roles played by the bona fide diphthamide genes DPH1–DPH5 in steps 1
  and 2 of the pathway, see main text. The ill-defined step 3, conversion of diphthine
  to diphthamide by amidation, is highlighted (red label). It likely involves ATP
  and ammonium cofactors in a reaction catalyzed by unidentified DPH gene product(s).
  Step 4 indicates diphthamide can be hijacked for eEF2 inactivation and cell death
  induction by antifungals, i.e. sordarin and bacterial ADP ribosylase toxins (ADPRtox);
  alternatively, it has been reported to undergo cell growth related physiological
  ADP ribosylation (ADPRphys?) by elusive cellular modifier(s). ACP, 2-[3-amino-carboxyl-propyl]-histidine;
  SAM: S-adenosylmethionine.'
