caption: Diagram of oxidative phosphorylation pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  combined. These pathways were identified as two of the significant pathways by IPA.
  Proteins which are outlined in purple are present in our dataset of animals undergoing
  compensatory growth compared to feed restricted animals (R2 v R1). The inner green
  colour indicates these proteins are down-regulated in animals undergoing compensatory
  growth compared to feed restricted animals.
