caption: Proposed molecular mechanisms of MYB transcription factor in the regulation
  of expression of target genes []. (A) Anthocyanin synthesis is initiated in binding
  directly to target gene by the MYB activator. (B) The MYB activator, WD40 repeat
  (WDR), and bHLH1 proteins form an MBW activation complex that activated structural
  genes and promoted the accumulation of anthocyanin. (C) The MYB activator, WDR,
  and bHLH1 proteins form an MBW activation complex that activated the expression
  of bHLH2 and structural genes and promote the accumulation of anthocyanin. (D) MYB
  repressors are activated by the MBW complex, that binding to the promoter of the
  terminal structural gene in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. (E) MYB repressors
  could inhibit anthocyanin biosynthesis by incorporating into the MBW activation
  complex as a corepressor or by binding to the promoter of target genes directly.
  (F) Feedback inhibition is provided by R3-MYB repressors; these are activated by
  the MBW complex and inhibit the formation of new MBW complexes by titrating bHLH
  factors.
