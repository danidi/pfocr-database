caption: Schematic representation of the proposed IR signal diversification by ligand-induced
  crosstalk with molecular partners. (a) In cells and tissues with predominant IR-B
  expression, IR-B activation by insulin is normally phasic (postprandial) and favors
  “metabolic” downstream signaling, which may be affected by the IR-B crosstalk with
  tissue-specific molecular partners (MPs) such as Met, GPER, Cav1/2, DDR1, and GM3.
  These molecules, in turn, may autonomously activate additional signaling. (b) In
  cells predominantly expressing IR-A and producing IGF-2, such as fetal or cancer
  cells, IR-A activation by IGF-2 elicits a steady IR-A interaction with molecular
  partners (MPs), favoring “nonmetabolic” effects, including mitogenesis and cell
  migration. In insulin-resistant patients, hyperinsulinemia, and perhaps proinsulin,
  may elicit similar effects. The line thickness indicates the strength of signaling
  pathway activation.
