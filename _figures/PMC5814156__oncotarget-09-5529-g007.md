caption: NEDDylation inhibition by pevonedistat induces eIF2α de-phosphorylation which
  reduces the cellular level of STIM1 and in turn changes the stoichiometric ratio
  between Orai1:STIM1, leading to CRAC activation and concomitant increase of Ca2+
  influx. De-phosphorylation of eIF2α also contributes ER stress which may also contribute
  to activation of SOCE with pevonedistat-mediated NEDDylation inhibition in ALL cells.
  Pevonedistat-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ will activated PKC and its
  downstream pro-survival MEK/ERK signaling cascade to promote phosphorylation and
  inhibition of the pro-apoptotic BIM activity. Treatment with SEL will inhibit the
  MEK/ERK pathway, and promote de-phosphorylation of BIM to increase its pro-apoptotic
  activity, resulting in synergistic cell death in pevonedistat-treated ALL cells.
