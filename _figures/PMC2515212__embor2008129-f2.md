number: Figure 2
caption: Possible mechanisms controlling O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase
  activity and the consequences of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modifications. O-GlcNAc
  protein modifications mediated by OGT have different outcomes, some of which are
  summarized in this figure. OGT itself is under the control of different regulatory
  mechanisms. On O-GlcNAc modification, proteins (for example, transcription factors)
  translocate into the nucleus (outcome 1). O-GlcNAc modification can affect protein
  stability (outcome 2). O-GlcNAc modification occurs on serine/threonine (Ser/Thr)
  residues that are also targets of protein phosphorylation (outcome 3); this can
  result in competitive regulation of target proteins with different outcomes. O-GlcNAc
  modification might have additional (not yet well-characterized) effects on target
  proteins such as structural consequences, effects on catalytic activity and hetero-homodimer
  formation (outcome 4). OGT function can be regulated by cellular re-localization,
  such as recruitment to the plasma membrane (outcome 5). OGT activity depends on
  the concentration of its substrate UDP-GlcNAc, which is strongly coupled to the
  metabolic state of the cells (outcome 6). HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway;
  O-GlcNAc, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine; OGT, O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate; Pr, protein; Pr-GlcNAc, O-GlcNAc-modified
  protein.
