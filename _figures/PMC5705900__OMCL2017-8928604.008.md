caption: Possible mechanisms through which crocetin and AS101 reverse the early adaptive
  response of the ovary to CPM. Based on our results and current literature, CPM causes
  the activation of the PI3K/AKT/FOXO3A signalling pathway that ends with the activation
  of primordial follicles (“burnout” hypothesis). Increased oxidative stress, which
  probably arisen from reduced GSH due to ovarian PM detoxification, is evidenced
  by reduced SOD2 levels and upregulation of the OS sensors SIRT1 and SIRT3. Upregulation
  of SIRT1 may contribute to CPM-induced follicle activation; upregulation of SIRT3
  along with reduction of PGC1-α and SOD2 marks the CPM-induced mitochondrial damage.
  By contrast, the finding that crocetin and AS101 exert fertoprotective effects,
  prevent SIRT1 and SIRT3 rise, and maintain pFOXO3a, PGC1-α, and SOD2 levels provides
  evidence for a link between the burnout hypothesis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial
  damage.
