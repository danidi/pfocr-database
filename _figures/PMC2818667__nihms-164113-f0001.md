caption: 'BAT: its location, cellular composition and thermogenic regulation. A. In
  humans brown adipose tissue (BAT) is located in interscapular and supraclavicular
  regions of the thorax, and is innervated by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) neurons
  that originate in the hypothalamus (HT) (). Cold temperatures and excessive food
  intake activate the SNS resulting in increased BAT thermogenic activity. B. Cellular
  features of BAT. The principal cell of BAT is the brown adipose (BA) cell which
  contains large numbers of mitochondria that utilize energy substrates and O2 and
  generate heat which is transferred to circulating blood. BAT also contains brown
  adipose progenitors (BAP) which are capable of dividing and differentiation into
  BA cells. BAT is innervated by axons from sympathetic neurons that employ the neurotransmitter
  norepinephrine (NE). C. Thermogenic signal transduction in brown adipocytes. NE
  released from SNS presynaptic terminals activates adrenergic receptors (R) on the
  surface of BA cells, resulting in the activation of the GTP-binding protein gs which,
  in turn, activates adenylate cyclase (AC) to generate cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP). Cyclic AMP then activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) which then
  phosphorylates and thereby activates lipases that hydrolyze triacylglycerols to
  generate free fatty acids (FFA). The FFA are then transferred into mitochondria
  where they undergo β-oxidation to generate acetyl Co A (AcCoA) which enters the
  citric acid cycle (CAC). As a result of b-oxidation and the CAC the energy substrates
  FADH (flavanine adenine dinucleotide) and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)
  are generated. BA cells express high amounts of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) which,
  when activated by the pathway just described, mediates a proton leak that uncouples
  the electron transport chain resulting in heat production.'
