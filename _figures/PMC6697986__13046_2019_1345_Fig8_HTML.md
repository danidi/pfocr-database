caption: A schematic model shows how CRABP2 regulates Lats1 to affect EMT, metastasis
  and invasion in ER+ and ER− breast cancer. In ER+ mammary cancer cells, the interaction
  of CRABP2 and Lats1 suppresses the ubiquitination of Lats1 to activate Hippo pathway
  to inhibit the invasion and metastasis of ER+ mammary cancer. However, in ER− mammary
  cancer cells, the interaction of CRABP2 and Lats1 promotes the ubiquitination of
  Lats1 to inactivate Hippo pathway to promote the invasion and metastasis of ER−
  mammary cancer
