caption: 'Ratio of transcripts and metabolite levels in the glutathione-ascorbate
  cycle and the glutathione peroxidase cycle in Gb and Gh fiber. The pathway is adapted
  from []. Metabolites: Graphs show the level of detected metabolites across DPA in
  Gb (grey bars) and Gh (white bars) fiber, with each X-axis tick representing 10,
  15, 18, 21, or 28 DPA. The Y-axis shows the scaled imputed means for metabolite
  concentrations, with the maximum value shown numerically at the top. The detected
  metabolites are indicated by chemical structures, except for NAD+ that was omitted
  for clarity Oxidized or reduced glutathione are indicated with the subscripts ‘ox’
  or ‘red’. Asterisks indicate a significant difference in the cross-genotype comparison
  (p ≤ 0.05). Ratios of transcripts: The heat maps show the ratio of expression of
  different loci in Gb vs Gh fiber, with each DPA represented on the horizontal. Each
  row represents a different gene, portrayed in the same order for each gene type
  as in Fig. . Enzyme names putatively corresponding to the transcripts are shown
  adjacent to reaction arrows. Forward or reverse reactions are indicated by solid
  or dashed lines. All of the transcripts shown had a significantly different expression
  level between Gh and Gb fiber on at least one DPA, except where NS is shown in two
  cases'
