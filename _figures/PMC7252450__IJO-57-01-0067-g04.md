caption: Functions and clinical significance of circRNAs in glioma. (A) Representative
  diagram of circRNAs involved in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation, migration,
  invasion, etc. Multiple identified circRNAs act as miRNA sponges and subsequently
  upregulate the relevant target gene expression level. These target genes or proteins
  further regulate downstream factors associated with cancer signaling pathways via
  acting as transcriptional factors or regulatory proteins and other mechanisms. For
  example, circ-NFIX activates the Notch signaling pathway through miR-34a-5p. (B)
  Representative diagram of circRNAs involved in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation,
  migration, invasion, etc. Multiple identified circRNAs act as miRNA sponges and
  subsequently downregulate the relevant target gene expression level. These target
  genes or proteins further regulate downstream factors associated with cancer signaling
  pathways via acting as transcriptional factors or regulatory proteins and other
  mechanisms. For example, cir-ITCH activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  through miR-214. circRNA, circular RNA.
