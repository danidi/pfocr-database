caption: Schematic model of the paracrine networks acting downstream of epithelial
  ESR1 in the mouse uterus during implantation. In the preimplantation uterus, E contributed
  by the preovulatory surge at the estrous stage acts through its receptor, ESR1,
  to induce LIF production in the glands during days 1–3 of gestation. LIF, secreted
  from the glands, acts via the LIF receptors on the luminal epithelium to activate
  ERK signaling pathway in a synergistic fashion by acting in concert with P, which
  acts through its receptor PGR. The JAK-STAT3 pathway is not activated by LIF in
  the luminal epithelial cells at this time. Activated ERK1/2 then induces the expression
  of Ihh in the luminal epithelium. IHH secreted from the luminal epithelium activates
  the IHH-PTCH1-COUPTFII signaling cascade in the uterine stromal cells. This chain
  of signaling events promotes stromal proliferation and differentiation, which are
  key events during implantation. BMP2, bone morphogenetic protein 2; LIFR, LIF receptor.
  EGF, Epidermal growth factor; HBEGF, Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor.
