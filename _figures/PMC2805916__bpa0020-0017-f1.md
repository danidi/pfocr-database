caption: 'Galectins, integrins and cell migration. The interaction of galectins with
  integrins modulates cell migration as well as other processes. Galectin-1 (Gal-1)
  interacts with the β1 integrin subunit inducing the phosphorylation of FAK, which
  modulates cell migration (). Binding of Gal-1 to integrin is involved in cell adhesion
  (). Moreover, Gal-1 was shown to regulate the expression of the protein ADAM-15
  that is involved in integrin-mediated adhesion (). Gal-1 also induces growth inhibition
  via its interaction with α5β1 (). This interaction results in the inhibition of
  the Ras–MEK–ERK pathway and the consecutive transactivation of Sp1, which induces
  p27 transcription (). In addition, Gal-1 is involved in the PKCε/vimentin controlled
  trafficking of integrin β1, a process that is important for cell migration (). However,
  it is not known with which molecule(s) Gal-1 is interacting, or in which intra-
  or extracellular location this interaction is taking place in order to initiate
  this signaling. Finally, Gal-1 is also involved in cell motility via the Gal-1-induced
  expression of RhoA and the alteration of the polimerization of the actin cytoskeleton
  () Once again, the receptor to which Gal-1 bind to initiate this signaling is not
  known. Galectin-3 (Ga-3) regulates cell adhesion via binding to α1β1 (). Gal-3 also
  forms a complex with α3β1 and the proteoglycan NG2 (). This interaction regulates
  endothelial cell motility and angiogenesis. Finally, Gal-3 has been shown to regulate
  the expression of integrin α6β1 and actin cytoskeleton organization (). However,
  it is not known with which molecule(s) Gal-3 is interacting to initiate this signaling.
  Galectin-8 (Gal-8) interacts with several integrins including α1β1, α3β1, α5β1 and
  α6β1. These interactions are involved in cell adhesion and apoptosis (). Abbreviations:
  ERK = extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK = focal adhesion kinase; MEK =
