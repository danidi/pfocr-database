caption: Proposed model of the role of TOX in innate lymphoid cell development. We
  propose that IL7Rlo cells represent a CLP to CHILP transitional cell population
  that requires TOX for progression. Notch signaling in CLP may initiate ILC differentiation
  but is terminated upon downregulation of Notch at the IL7Rlo transitional stage,
  and TOX could influence regulation of Notch gene targets. The NK cell lineage originates
  from a pre-CHILP stage (EILP), possibly via the αLP progenitor that is also TOX
  dependent. In the absence of TOX, rNKp cells fail to develop, but a population of
  Lin−CD122+ cells of unknown origin or function remains. Development of tissue resident
  NK cells is less affected by loss of TOX than are cNK cells, possibly indicative
  of a distinct pathway of development. Similarly, ILC3s are found in the gut of TOX-deficient
  mice, but whether this is due to a TOX-independent pathway of development or homeostatic
  proliferation is not clear.
