caption: Schematic model for molecular mechanisms underlying aging modulatory effects
  on NKA isoforms. Aging can either increase the production of ROS, such as superoxide
  radical and hydrogen peroxide, or induce NO• release by impairing Ca2+ homeostasis
  and subsequently increasing intracellular Ca2+ (nNOS-mediated NO• production). NO•
  is a free radical and can generate peroxynitrite, which may cause neurotoxicity
  by lipid peroxidation, mitochondria disruption, mutations of DNA and proteins, apoptosis
  and impairment of α1 activity. Strategies that induce NMDA activation can also activate
  the cGMP pathway, which, in turn, may lead to neuroprotective signaling, partly
  by upregulating α2 and α3 (cGMP, cyclic GMP; GLU, glutamate; NKA, Na+,K+-ATPase).
