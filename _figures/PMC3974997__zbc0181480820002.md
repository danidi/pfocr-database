caption: 'Interference with the host NF-κB signaling pathways by STPKs of pathogenic
  bacteria: LegK1, OspG, and NleH1. In the canonical NF-κB pathway, in response to
  stimulation, the IKK trimer (IKKα/IKKβ/NEMO) phosphorylates IκB inhibitor (here,
  IκBα), which normally sequesters the NF-κB (p50/p65) dimer in the cytoplasm. Once
  phosphorylated, IκBα dissociates from NF-κB dimer, which then translocates into
  the nucleus and activates genes implicated in the immune response. The dissociated
  phospho-IκBα is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitinylation system (E1, E2, and E3) and
  is addressed to and degraded in the proteasome. In the non-canonical pathway, the
  IKKα dimer phosphorylates p100, the precursor of p52 that is an inhibitor of the
  NF-κB dimer. Once phosphorylated, p100 is processed to p52, and the p52/RelB NF-κB
  dimer thus activated is translocated into the nucleus. The Legionella STPK LegK1
  mimics IKKs in both canonical (A, left) and non-canonical (B) pathways and induces
  activation of the NF-κB pathways in the host. A (right), the Shigella sp. STPK OspG
  interacts with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, blocking phospho-IκBα degradation
  and thus silencing the inflammatory response of the host. C, the RPS3 protein interacts
  with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, and when phosphorylated by IKKα, RPS3 is translocated
  into the nucleus and determines the regulatory specificity of NF-κB for target genes.
  The E. coli STPK NleH1 inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation and thus inhibits the host
  NF-κB response mechanism. CRKL could be involved in this inhibition, but the exact
  mechanism remains to be elucidated.'
