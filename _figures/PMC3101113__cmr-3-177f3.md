caption: 'Model of canonical IL-6 signaling versus IL-6 trans-signaling in tumor progression
  and metastases. In the canonical IL-6 signaling pathway, the IL-6 receptor subunit
  is membrane bound and forms a heterotrimer with two gp130 subunits. When IL-6 binds
  to the receptor, STAT3 is activated in a JAK-dependent manner that leads to increased
  RANKL expression. IL-6 may also activate AKT via increased JAK-dependent PI3K activity
  and result in cell survival and anti-apoptosis signaling. Concomitantly, increased
  MAPK activity downstream of JAK activation can lead to upregulated cell growth,
  proliferation, and mitosis. In the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway, IL-6 first binds
  to the truncated sIL6R. The IL-6/sIL6R complex then binds to the membrane-bound
  gp130 dimer to form an IL-6 trans-signaling complex. Due to the fact that the sIL-6R
  lacks a membrane signaling domain, there appears to be significant differences in
  the intracellular signaling pathways. While IL-6 trans-signaling also leads to phosphorylation
  and activation of STAT3, increased cell survival, proliferation, and mitosis occurs
  in an AKT-and MAPK-independent manner. The exact mechanisms for IL-6 trans-signaling
  leading to increased cell survival, proliferation, and mitosis are not yet known.Abbreviations:
  IL-6, interleukin 6; JAK, Janus kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor
  κB ligand; sIL6R, soluble IL-6 receptor; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3.'
