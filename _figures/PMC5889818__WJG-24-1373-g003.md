caption: 'Schematic overview of three different modes of cell death: apoptosis, necrosis
  and necroptosis. When FasL or Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) bind to their
  death receptors (DRs), death domains of DRs are oligomerized and form death-inducing
  signalling complex (DISC), which recruits caspase-8. Active caspase 8 cleaves Bid
  into cleaved Bid (tBid), which translocates to mitochondria and cooperates with
  Bax. Meanwhile, JNKs are activated by Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
  and pJNK also translocates to the mitochondria via binding to the Sab protein. ROS
  accumulation and ATP depletion in the mitochondria aggravate mitochondrial damage
  and induce membrane permeability transition (MPT), resulting in release of cytochrome
  C, in turn promoting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Activated caspase-3
  then leads to hepatocyte apoptosis. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of hepatocyte
  apoptosis are linked, because hepatocytes require mitochondrial amplification activating
  caspase-3 for cell death execution. The mitochondrial injury and MPT are also key
  factors in cascade of events leading to necrosis. Necroptosis shares the upstream
  pathway with apoptosis. When cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAPs) are depleted,
  Receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)1 and RIPK3 interact with each other via
  membrane permeability transition (RHIM) domains to form the necrosome, and further
  recruit and phosphorylate MLKL to initiate necroptosis.'
