caption: 'Monoclonal antibodies: types and mechanisms of action. (a) Naked monoclonal
  antibody (mAb). Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC): natural killer
  cell (NK) binds to the Fc region via the Fc-receptor and releases lytic factors
  such as perforin and granzymes. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC): interaction
  between the Fc region and protein C1q activates the classic complement pathway that
  results in the formation of membrane attack complex (MAC) and cell lysis. Antibody-dependent
  phagocytosis (ADP): the binding of macrophages induces activation of phagocytosis.
  Direct effects: induction of apoptosis directly or through cross-linking; effects
  depending on specific antigen functions (e.g., inhibition of intracellular signaling,
  blocking of enzymatic functions). Checkpoint inhibitors: blockade of programmed
  cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) preventing
  immune response suppression. Immunomodulation: interaction of mAb with stroma cells,
  which inhibit T cell activation restoring the immune response against neoplastic
  cells. (b) Antibody–drug conjugate. Upon antibody binding to the target, a cytotoxic
  payload is released in the target cell. (c) Bispecific monoclonal antibodies. Ig-like:
  two binding sites with different specificity and an Fc region that binds to the
  Fc-receptor. Non-Ig-like: two different single-chain variable fragments (variable
  regions comprised only of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains). Bispecific
  monoclonal antibodies usually bind a tumor antigen and an immune effector antigen
  (e.g., CD3 on the T-cell surface), in order to activate the immune cells against
  the neoplastic cell. Abbreviations: +/++/+++, low/moderate/high; Fab, fragment antigen
  binding; FC, fragment crystallizable region; Treg, regulatory T cell; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cell; NK, natural killer cell; ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity;
  CDC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity; MAC, membrane attack complex; ADP, antibody-dependent
  phagocytosis; APC, antigen-presenting cell; ADCs, antibody–drug conjugates; BiAbs,
