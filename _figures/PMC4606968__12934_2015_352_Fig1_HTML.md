caption: Schematic presentation of the EMC pathway providing ethylmalonyl-CoA extender
  unit (a) and of the proposed ALL pathway (b) for biosynthesis of allylmalonyl-CoA
  extender unit, part of the FK506 biosynthetic machinery. The step of potential cross-activity
  of ccr homologues from EMC and ALL pathways is marked by a two-way arrow
