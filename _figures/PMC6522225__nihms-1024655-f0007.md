caption: Acute methamphetamine (Meth) effects on altering astrocyte activity are mediated
  by TAAR1-coupled signaling and K+ channel dysfunction. Astrocytes play a key role
  in regulating extracellular K+ homeostasis in the brain. Meth alters this dynamic
  function of astrocytes in regulating K+ homeostasis by suppressing K+ efflux through
  dysfunctional Kv, K2P and Kir channels. Acute Meth effects on altering K+ efflux
  through Kv channels are mediated by disrupting the TAAR1-coupled cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway. The mechanism underlying acute Meth effects on suppressing K2P channel
  activity [leading to resting membrane potential (RMP) depolarization] could be mediated
  by dysfunction of the Gs/cAMP/PKA and/or Gq/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase
  C (PKC) signaling pathway. Meth is a potent agonist for TAAR1. Direct activation
  of TAAR1 by Meth promotes the TAAR1/Gs/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, as well as the
  TAAR1/Gq/PLC/PKC signaling pathway, thereby enhancing PKA/PKC-induced phosphorylation
  of Kv/K2P channels, respectively. Enhanced phosphorylation of Kv/K2P channels reduces
  their activity to conduct outflowing K+. Reducing K+ efflux from astrocytes via
  Kv/K2P channels decreases extracellular K+ levels ([K+]o). The Goldman-Hodgkin Katz
  equation indicates that reduced [K+]o results in Vm hyperpolarization of surrounding
  neurons; and therefore decreases their excitability. The mechanism, by which toxic/fatal
  level of Meth suppresses Kir channel activity, remains to be identified. These findings
  suggest that Meth disturbs functional and dynamic activity of astrocytes by altering
  the functional activity of Kv and K2P channels through the cAMP/PKA and likely PLC/PKC
  signaling pathway, respectively; and that could affect their interactions with neurons
  in the brain.

  description: Acute methamphetamine (Meth) effects on altering astrocyte activity
    are mediated by TAAR1-coupled signaling and K+ channel dysfunction. Astrocytes
    play a key role in regulating extracellular K+ homeostasis in the brain. Meth
    alters this dynamic function of astrocytes in regulating K+ homeostasis by suppressing
    K+ efflux through dysfunctional Kv, K2P and Kir channels. Acute Meth effects on
    altering K+ efflux through Kv channels are mediated by disrupting the TAAR1-coupled
    cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. The mechanism underlying acute Meth effects on suppressing
    K2P channel activity [leading to resting membrane potential (RMP) depolarization]
    could be mediated by dysfunction of the Gs/cAMP/PKA and/or Gq/phospholipase C
    (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Meth is a potent agonist for TAAR1.
    Direct activation of TAAR1 by Meth promotes the TAAR1/Gs/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway,
    as well as the TAAR1/Gq/PLC/PKC signaling pathway, thereby enhancing PKA/PKC-induced
    phosphorylation of Kv/K2P channels, respectively. Enhanced phosphorylation of
    Kv/K2P channels reduces their activity to conduct outflowing K+. Reducing K+ efflux
    from astrocytes via Kv/K2P channels decreases extracellular K+ levels ([K+]o).
