caption: Modulation of the PI 3-kinase pathway by RNAi. A schematic representation
  of growth factor-induced activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway is shown. Growth
  factor stimulation of cells leads to activation of their cognate receptors at the
  cell membrane, which in turn associate with and activate intracellular signalling
  molecules such as PI 3-kinase. PTEN interferes with PI 3-kinase-mediated downstream
  responses and ensures that activation of the pathway occurs in a transient manner.
  Three known potential downstream effectors including Akt, PDK and JNK are indicated.
  RNA-mediated gene silencing was attempted for five components of the PI 3-kinase
  pathway, the PI 3-kinase catalytic subunits p110α, p110β, the downstream kinases
  Akt1 and Akt2 and the phosphatase PTEN.
