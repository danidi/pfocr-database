caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways regulating TREM2 phagocytosis
  and TREM2 modulation of NFκB phosphorylation/activation. (Right) Schematic representation
  of the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of phagocytosis by TREM2. Overall
  our data show that TREM2 leads to an activation of SYK and of the PI3K/AKT pathways.
  Genetic suppression or inhibition of SYK activity with BAY61-3606 does not prevent
  the induction of the PI3K/AKT pathway in HEK293 TREM2/DAP12 cells suggesting that
  SYK activation and PI3K activation are triggered independently by TREM2. The PI3K
  inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 prevent AKT phosphorylation in TREM2/DAP12 cells
  showing that the TREM2 stimulation of AKT phosphorylation is mediated by PI3K while
  suppression of SYK expression as well as SYK inhibition with BAY61-3606 do not affect
  AKT phosphorylation. Interestingly, both SYK inhibition with BAY61-3606 or suppression
  of SYK expression, PI3K inhibition with wortmannin and LY294002, PLCγ inhibition
  with U-73122 and PKC inhibition with Go6983 and Ro32-0432 are all antagonizing TREM2
  phagocytosis in HEK293 TREM2-DAP12 cells highlighting the involvement of these signaling
  elements in TREM2 mediated phagocytosis. (Left) Schematic representation of signaling
  elements involved in the regulation of p65NFκB phosphorylation by TREM2. TREM2-DAP12
  prevents the degradation of IKBα induced by PMA, suppresses p65 NFκB phosphorylation
  induced by PMA and also prevents NFκB transactivation induced by PMA showing globally
  that TREM2-DAP12 antagonizes NFκB activation induced by PMA. Overall, the suppression
  of p65NFκB phosphorylation by TREM2 (either full length or TREM2-CTF) in response
  to PMA is not affected by SYK inhibition, PI3K inhibition or PLCγ inhibition. In
  addition, MARCKS phosphorylation (direct substrate of PKCs) induced by PMA is not
  suppressed by TREM2 showing that TREM2 does not prevent PKC activation induced by
  PMA. These data suggest that TREM2 is acting downstream of PKC to suppress p65NFκB
  phosphorylation induced by PMA.
