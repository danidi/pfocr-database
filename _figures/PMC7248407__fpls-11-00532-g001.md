caption: Simplified GA metabolic pathway in flowering plants. All enzymes mapped to
  the GA metabolic pathway, except GA13ox from Tripterygium wilfordii, were verified
  with enzymatic assays and the chemical profiling of transgenic plants. P450s (ER
  membrane-associated proteins) in this pathway are highlighted in blue, while 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
  dioxygenases (2-ODDs, cytosolic proteins) are highlighted in purple. All dashed
  lines indicate enzymatic a step that has not yet been characterized at the genetic
  level in any flowering plant. The genes/enzymes characterized from Arabidopsis and
  rice are marked in black and blue, respectively. The carbon backbone of GA12 is
  labeled with numbers, and the bioactive GAs (GA1, GA3, GA4, GA7, and DHGA12) are
  marked in red. The Arabidopsis GA-deficient mutants (ga1 to ga5) used for map-based
  cloning are shown in parentheses next to the corresponding genes. CPS, ent-copalyl
  diphosphate synthase; GAMT, GA methyltransferase; GAS2, gain of function in ABA-modulated
  seed germination 2; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; KAO, ent-kaurenoic
  acid oxidase; KO, ent-kaurene oxidase; KS, ent-kaurenoic acid synthase; MEP, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4-phosphate.
