caption: Schematic representation for possible mechanisms underlying the protective
  role of ALA against vascular calcification. In normal conditions, Gas6/Axl interaction
  and sequential Akt activation are involved in maintenance of VSMC survival in an
  autocrine mode. During Pi-induced calcification, VSMCs display a considerable decrease
  in survival because of down-regulation of Gas6/Axl/Akt signalling and an increase
  in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. This apoptosis is thought to cause mitochondria
  perturbation by insulting accumulated oxidants. ALA may protect against aortic calcification
  at least in part by rescuing Gas6–Axl survival pathway and by inhibiting mitochondrial-mediated
  apoptosis in VSMCs through improvement of mitochondria function by its antioxidant
  potential. The dashed line indicates an unresolved issue to be determined.
