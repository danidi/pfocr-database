caption: Schematic outline of PC metabolism in yeast. The PC-DRP is indicated by red
  arrows. The PC-DRP includes deacylation of PC to GPC by PLB1 or NTE1 followed by
  stepwise reacylation of GPC to LPC by GPC1 and LPC to PC by ALE1. The de novo PC
  synthesis routes are indicated by dotted arrows. Gene names are in italics. PLA,
  phospholipase A; PLB, phospholipase B.

papertitle: The glycerophosphocholine acyltransferase Gpc1 is part of a phosphatidylcholine
  (PC)-remodeling pathway that alters PC species in yeast.
