caption: 'Identification of differentially regulated genes within the cellular assembly
  and organization, cellular function and maintenance and cell death and survival
  network. (A) Gene interactions for Network ID 3 in Figure  were generated by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software. Red‐coloured genes are significantly up‐regulated and
  green‐coloured genes are down‐regulated; the more intense the colour, the higher
  the level of differential gene expression; uncoloured molecules are not differentially
  expressed but involved in the network. Solid lines indicate a direct interaction
  and dashed lines an indirect interaction. The overlay highlights genes specifically
  involved in cell death and survival mechanisms: ACTB, β‐actin; AGRN aagrin; AHSA1,
  activator of HSP90 ATPase activity 1; DAG1, dystroglycan 1; DKK3, dickkopf WNT signalling
  pathway inhibitor 3; HSPB1, heat shock protein binding protein 1; INPPL1, inositol
  polyphosphate phosphatase like 1; MDK, midkine transcript variant 3; MFN2; NDRG2,
  N‐myc downstream regulated gene 2; PDPK1; PLD1, phospholipase D1; PP2A, protein
  phosphatase 2; RABL6, RAB member RAS oncogene family like 6; SYNM, synemin. (B)
  Cellular location of differentially regulated genes, which interact with DOX (extracellular)
  and Nox2 (CYBB; at the cytosolic‐plasma membrane junction). Solid lines indicate
  a direct interaction and dashed lines an indirect interaction. Seven genes specifically
  involved in cardiomyocyte cell death are highlighted in blue: HSBP1; HSPD1; MDK;
  MFN2; MMP2; PDPK1; PPARGC1A.'
