caption: Proposed role of metformin in inhibiting neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-induced
  tumor cell metastasis. In addition to decreasing neutrophil recruitment (not shown),
  metformin has been shown to inhibit protein kinase C beta II (PKCβII) translocation
  to the plasma membrane and prevent the downstream activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX)
  that would otherwise result in the expulsion of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)
  components into the extracellular space []. Tumor cells have been shown to adhere
  to NETs, which contain DNA, histones, neutrophil elastase, and other proteins. In
  the case of ovarian cancer (OvCa), NET formation was especially critical to the
  ability of tumor cells to colonize the omentum in vivo, while having no effect on
  the primary tumor or other intra-abdominal sites []. The ability for metformin to
  inhibit this NET-dependent adhesion and colonization of the omentum has not yet
  been investigated but is a potential mechanism for its antitumor activity. Cited
  experiments are denoted by their respective reference numbers [,]. Blue arrows indicate
  activation, red arrows indicate inhibition, red T symbols indicate direct inactivation,
  and red X symbols indicate inhibition of this pathway by metformin.
