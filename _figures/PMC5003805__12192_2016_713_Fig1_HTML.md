caption: 'Schematic diagram of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway and its regulation by
  Ca2+signaling in myocytes. Ca2+ uptake by myocytes activates calmodulin and calpain1,
  which activate calcineurin as a result. Activated calcineurin removes the phosphate
  group on NFAT transcription factors, allowing for nuclear translocation, where it
  can regulate the expression of genes essential for muscle growth. When intracellular
  Ca2+ levels decrease and calcineurin becomes inactive, and NFAT is phosphorylated
  and exported by several different kinases including GSK3β, PKA, and Dyrk1a. Abbreviations:
  NFAT nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)'
