caption: 'Methotrexate mode of action. Methotrexate (MTX) is actively transported
  into the cell by the reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1; also known as SLC19A1) and
  is then polyglutamated by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) to form MTX polyglutamates
  (MTX PG), which are kept inside the cell [] and are responsible for MTX anti-inflammatory
  intracellular actions [,]. Glutamates can be removed by γ-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH)
  and MTX monoglutamate is rapidly effluxed from the cell via membrane transporters
  of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family [], especially ABCC1-4 and ABCG2 [,]. Inside
  the cell, MTX PG exert their anti-inflammatory actions through inhibition of essential
  enzymes of the folate pathway: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) [], blocking the conversion
  of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF) and ultimately leading to depletion
  of methionine and decreased DNA methylation; thymidylate synthase (TYMS) [,], interfering
  with de novo pyrimidine synthesis; and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carbox-amide ribonucleotide
  (AICAR) transformylase (ATIC) [,], an enzyme of the de novo purine synthesis, causing
  accumulation of AICAR, which will finally result in increased secretion of adenosine,
  a strong anti-inflammatory mediator [,]. The enzyme 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR) is not directly inhibited by MTX, but is affected by it because
  of its action in the folate pathway []. ADA, adenosine deaminase; AMPd, adenosine
