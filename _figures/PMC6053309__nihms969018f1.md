caption: FAM19A5 secreted from healthy adipocytes binds to the S1PR2 receptor in vascular
  smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which triggers downstream G12/G13 and RhoA signaling
  pathway to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration, thereby protecting against
  neointima formation. In obesity, impaired FAM19A5 release from dysfunctional adipocytes
  fails to restrain VSMC growth, thus leading to enhanced neointima formation.
