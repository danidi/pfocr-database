number: Figure 4
caption: (a,b) ATM pathway in HD-CAV-2 (a) and LV (b) cells at 5 days posttransduction.
  In red are highlighted the upregulated genes, in green, the downregulated ones,
  in white genes not modulated in the chip; IPA p-value, HD-CAV-2 1.68×10−8, LV 5.11×10−11.
  (c) The legend in the panels is valid for (a) and (b). (d) Single gene alterations
  were evaluated by qPCR 2 h, 5 and 10 days posttransduction. Data are presented as
  fold change expression of each transcript normalized with respect to the endogenous
  control and calculated as compared to the mock sample considered as 1. Red dashed
  lines display the threshold set at ±1.5, as for microarray data. Data are reported
  as mean of three independent experiments with SD; one-way ANOVA (vectors versus
  mock), * p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
