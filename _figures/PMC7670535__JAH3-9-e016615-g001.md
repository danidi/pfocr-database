caption: Role of AKAP13 in cardiac function. GPCR signaling is directed by the type
  of ligand binding to this receptor. The nature of the ligand would favorably shift
  the equilibrium to a specific conformation of the receptor, which signals through
  a distinct G protein. For AKAP13 and GPCR signaling in the heart, it has been associated
  with 2 distinct G protein–signaling pathways (Gα12 and Gαs). A, When stimulation
  of β‐AR stabilizes its conformation to signal through Gα12, AKAP13 signalosome is
  attracted near the receptor. AKAP13 interacts with Gα12 allowing Rho‐GEF stimulation.
  Upon Rho‐GEF stimulation, both SRF (Rho‐GEF guanosine triphosphatase) and myocyte
  enhancer factor 2C (transcription factor) activities are increased. However, the
  mechanism of their activation depends on different regions of AKAP13. Activation
  of myocyte enhancer factor 2C depends on the carboxyl region of AKAP13 (BRX), whereas
  SRF activation depends on the GEF region of AKAP13. Collectively, this suggests
  that increased gene expression of factors associated with cardiac development may
  be partially dependent on AKAP13. B, AKAP13 has been reported in the cardiac hypertrophic
  signaling. Under states of increased hemodynamic load, it is usually accompanied
  by a favorable state of Gαs pathway signaling within the cardiomyocytes. AKAP13
  signalosome releases PKD to phosphorylate HDAC5. Phosphorylation of HDAC5 activates
  MEF2, which drives the transcription of genes associated with cell growth, Ca2+
  handling, and contraction. The aforementioned multistep process of PKD release starts
  with PKA activation as a response to the Gαs pathway. PKA further phosphorylates
  PKC. Phosphorylation of PKC activates PKD, leading to its dissociation from the
  signalosome. α12 indicates α subunit of Gα12 protein; αs, α subunit of Gαs protein;
