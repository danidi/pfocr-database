caption: Schematic view of microglial activation and cross-talks between microglia
  and other immune factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. With regard
  to PD pathogenesis, microglial activation and microglia-mediated inflammatory responses
  play essential roles. The M1 polarized state can be induced by TNF-α, IFN-γ, and
  LPS; present phenotype markers such as MHC-II and CD86; are associated with the
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α),
  chemokines (CCL-2, CCL-20) and CXCL-10; are capable of releasing cytotoxic substances
  (ROS, RNS, NO, EAA) and PGE2 due to the activation of NADPH oxidase, iNOS, as well
  as expression of COX-2, contributing to the enhanced oxidative stress. Neuroinflammation
  and oxidative stress interact with each other to engender a vicious cycle, exerting
  toxic effects on dopaminergic neurons and leading to the exacerbation of the neurodegenerative
  process. On the other hand, M2 can be induced by IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13; generally
  present intracellular components (e.g., SOCS3), cell surface markers (SRs, CD206,
  CD86, and MHC-II); are capable of producing mediators such as anti-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β), glucocorticoids, neurotrophic factors
  (e.g., BDNF and IGF-1), and extracellular matrix proteins; exert anti-inflammatory
  and neurotrophic effects and play vital roles in tissue repair. Notably, activated
  microglia may exist along a dynamic continuum rather than be simply polarized into
  two categories, which is regulated by interactions with other cellular elements,
  including astrocytes, neurons, infiltrating T cells and mast cells. TREM2-DAP12
  signaling complex, the CD200-CD200R and the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axes are considered to
  be involved in the astrocyte-microglia and neuron-glia cross-talks. Activated mast
  cells could induce microglial activation via the MAPK signaling pathway. In turn,
  microglia-derived IL-6 could induce surface TLR2 and TLR4 expression and consequent
  cytokine release of mast cells, which contribute to the recruitment of immune cells
  to the injured areas. In addition, microglial activation has been indicated to promote
  the prion-like behavior of α-syn misfolding and aggregation. In turn, misfolded
  α-syn act as chemoattractants to direct microglial migration toward damaged neurons,
  promote the pro-inflammatory microglia, and exert toxic effects on neurons. Dopaminergic
  neurons in a death process can trigger microglial activation and inflammatory factor
  production which can promote recruitment of peripheral leucocytes (mainly T cells).
  In this way, a complex inflammatory network forms and aggravates degeneration of
  dopaminergic neurons. A variety of agents or approaches might exert neuroprotective
  effects due to their regulatory roles on microglial activation. BBB, blood-brain
  barrier; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; COX, cyclooxygenase; CXCL, chemokine
  (C-X-C motif) ligand; DAP12, DNAX activation protein 12; EAA, excitatory amino acids;
  IFN, interferon; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IL, interleukin; iNOS, inducible
  nitric oxide synthase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NO, nitric oxide; PD,
  Parkinson’s disease; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; SR, scavenger
  receptor; TGF, transforming growth factor; TLR, toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis
  factor; TREM2, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; α-syn, α-synuclein.
