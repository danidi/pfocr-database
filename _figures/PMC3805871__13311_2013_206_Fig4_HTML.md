caption: A scheme represents an epigenetic mechanism that abnormal activity of histone
  H3K9-specific methyltransferase (ESET) leads to synaptic failure and striatal dysfunction
  in Huntingdon’s disease (HD). ESET-induced and H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin
  condensation results in the repression of the CHRM1 gene and subsequent reduction
  of CHRM1 protein in medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Down-regulation of CHRM1 fails
  to respond to acetylcholine (Ach) from cholinergic interneurons and to transduce
  the G-protein-coupled intracellular Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway, which affects
  on the synaptic function of MSNs. Consequently, deregulation of CHRM1-dependent
  striatal synaptic function contributes to neurodegeneration in HD. This figure is
  reproduced from []. PLC = phospholipase C; Ins(1,4,5)P3 = inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate;
  ER = endoplasmic reticulum
