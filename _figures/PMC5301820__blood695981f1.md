caption: CSF3R mutations activate kinase signaling to promote the expansion of neutrophils.
  CSF3R has an N-terminal extracellular domain comprising an Ig-like domain (dark
  green) and fibronectin type-III repeats (light green). The T618I and T615A (not
  shown) mutations in the extracellular domain and the T640N mutation in the transmembrane
  domain (purple) cause ligand-independent receptor activation. Truncation mutations
  in the cytoplasmic domain (gray) cause increased cell-surface expression of the
  receptor. CNL-associated mutations in CSF3R cause activation of downstream kinase
  signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, ultimately driving neutrophil
  production. P, phosphorylation.
