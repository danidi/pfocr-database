caption: The microglia in Alzheimer’s disease. A) Microglia are drawn to the site
  of amyloidosis and astrogliosis via NTBI ATP and Aβ chemotaxis. B) Microglia recognize
  Aβ via the CD36-CD47 receptor system leading to the phagocytosis Aβ fibrils and
  bound iron. C) Amyloid is normally degraded via the lysosomal pathway and ferrous
  iron is stored in ferritin. In the Alzheimer’s disease state, excess iron and amyloid
  overwhelm the lysosome and the decreased pH provides a suitable environment for
  amyloid aggregation. D) ROS/RNS produced from redox cycling of iron impairs the
  lysosomal breakdown of Aβ and promotes cleavage and neurotoxicity of tau,. E) Ferritin
  can be secreted from microglia through a non-classical secretory pathway. This process
  is impaired in AD, leading to an imbalance of iron transport to oligodendrocytes.
  F) Microvesicles secreted from activate microglia interact with soluble Aβ to form
  amyloid oligomers that cause oligodendrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. G) Macropinocytosis
  of exosomes produced by damaged oligodendrocytes cause microglia to facilitate myelin
  degradation and inflammation. H) Hypoxic conditions increase IRPs and TfR expression,
  leading to an increase in ROS and further cytokine release.
