caption: Pathways of homocysteine and methionine metabolism. In cells, homocysteine
  is derived from methionine after its utilization as a methyl group donor in biological
  methylation reactions. In this cycle, methionine is activated by condensation with
  ATP to give the ubiquitous methyl donor, SAM. SAM is transformed into S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) by donating its methyl group to the substrates of methylation reactions. Subsequently,
  SAH gives rise to homocysteine in a reversible reaction that favors SAH over homocysteine
  production. Because SAH is a potent inhibitor of most methyltransferase enzymes,
  homocysteine must be constantly removed through the folate- and vitamin B12-dependent
  remethylation of homocysteine to methionine or by the irreversible vitamin B6-dependent
  degradation of homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway. When intracellular
  homocysteine accumulates, excess homocysteine can be exported into circulation for
  clearance by kidney and liver. Methionine enters the cycle primarily from diet,
  but it can also be salvaged from endogenous protein degradation. Methionine can
  be removed from the cycle for use in protein and polyamine synthesis, or by homocysteine
  and the transsulfuration pathway. SAM acts as a coregulator of the methylation and
  transsulfuration pathways by stimulating cystathionine β-synthetase, the first step
  in the removal of homocysteine and inhibiting methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase,
  which generates the folate coenzyme used in the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine
  (). Saturation of the transsulfuration pathway by excess methionine and B6 deficiency,
  or by inhibition of homocysteine remethylation due to folate or B12 deficiency,
  can lead to the production of intracellular homocysteine, which is then exported
  from cells into plasma. B6, vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; B12, vitamin B12,
  methylcobalamin; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
