caption: LAT1 binds with 4F2hc (SLC3A2), which are located on the plasma membrane.
  This complex is responsible for transporting amino acids, hormones, and some drugs.
  LAT1 regulates cell growth and metabolism through the mTOR and MYC pathway and participates
  in insulin signaling, immune response, and cell autophagy. LAT1 also plays an important
  role in tumor occurrence and development. BCH and JPH203 are the two main inhibitors
  of LAT1, which can inhibit the growth of tumor cells and has considerable application
  prospect in tumor treatment.
