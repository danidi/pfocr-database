caption: Proposed WhiE PKS biosynthetic pathway from genetic recombination studies
  (, , ). (A) Cartoon representation of the whiE gene cluster with each open-reading
  frame (ORF) annotated with the putative or proposed function. (B) Proposed WhiE
  PKS biosynthetic pathway from genetic recombination studies showing the products
  in the presence of absence of WhiE ARO/CYC. In the presence of WhiE ARO/CYC there
  was exclusive production of a 24-carbon polyketide product with C9-C14, C7-C16 cyclizations
  (TW95a (1) and TW95b (2)). When WhiE ARO/CYC is absent there are many shunt products
  with varying carbon lengths and cyclization patterns.
