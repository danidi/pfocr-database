caption: A schematic underlies the pathway of mitochondrial free radical generation
  and their enzymatic antioxidant defences. The mitochondrial O•¯2 is subsequently
  converted to H2O2 either by manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) or
  copper, zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD), and then ultimately reduced
  to water by glutathione peroxidase (GPx).
