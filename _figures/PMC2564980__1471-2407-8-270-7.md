caption: Higher expression of genes involved in O-glycan synthesis in the carcinoma
  compared to the papillary adenocarcinoma tumors. KEGG pathway analysis was performed
  using DAVID software. Light gray background – significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression
  in carcinoma; gray background – no significant difference; frame around background
  – over twofold difference. The underlined letters C (carcinoma) or P (papillary
  adenocarcinoma) which follow the gene name indicate the type of tumor in which gene
  expression is exclusively different from the mammary gland. The direction of the
  arrows indicates the type of change (up- or downregulation). One arrow – statistically
  significant (P < 0.05) difference. Two arrows – statistically significant and over
  twofold difference.
