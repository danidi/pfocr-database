caption: Regulation of photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis, a long-day plant, and
  in rice, a short-day plant. Upper panel. In Arabidopsis, CO is a central activator
  of flowering time, inducing expression of FT. FT protein acts as florigen, traveling
  from the leaf vasculature to the shoot apical meristem where it, together with FD,
  induces expression of the FLORAL MERISTEM IDENTITY (FMI) genes. CO transcription
  is repressed by the CDF proteins, which in long days are targeted for proteolytic
  degradation by the LOV/KELCH/F-BOX protein FKF1 complexed with GI. CO transcription
  is also independently activated by light-activated CIB proteins. In long days light
  signaling stabilizes CO protein through inhibition of proteolytic degradation of
  CO, which in short days is ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1. CO protein
  is also stabilized through interaction with the PRRs during the day, when they are
  maximally abundant. Please consult the main text for further details. Middle panel.
  In rice in inductive short days the OsGI/Hd1 (OsCO) pathway activates expression
  of Hd3a (OsFT). Hd3a expression is also activated by Ehd1 in a distinct pathway
  not found in Arabidopsis. Black indicates strong regulation and gray weak regulation.
  Please consult the main text for further details. Lower panel. In rice in non-inductive
  long days light signaling through PHYB converts Hd1 into a transcriptional repressor
  of Hd3a. Light signaling also induces Ghd7 which encodes a repressor of Ehd1 expression.
  Similarly, OsPRR37 represses Ehd1 and Hda3 expression. Black indicates strong regulation
  and gray weak regulation. Please consult the main text for further details.
