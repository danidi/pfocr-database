caption: (A) “Complement and coagulation cascades” and “Pathway in cancer_1”, “Hedgehog
  signaling pathway” and “Pathway in cancer_2”; (B) “Axon guidance” and “MAPK signaling
  pathway”. Each ellipse represents a gene in KEGG pathway or ppi network. For a given
  gene, the ellipse is divided into four parts (from left to right) corresponding
  to different molecular level with abnormal states (red) in mRNA expression, (green)
  DNA methylation, (yellow) copy number and blue (somatic mutation), respectively.
