caption: Tissue fragmentation and mechanical manipulation disrupt ovarian Hippo signaling
  pathway and promote follicle growth. (Left) Without tissue fragmentation and mechanical
  manipulation, Hippo signaling is activated. Kinase complexes consisting of the mammalian
  sterile-20 like serine/threonine kinase 1/2 (MST 1/2) and Salvador (SAV) are phosphorylated.
  Subsequently, large tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2) phosphorylates Yes-associated
  protein (YAP)/ transcriptional co-activator PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), leading to
  the degradation of YAP/TAZ or retention of YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm. Consequently,
  transcriptional enhanced associate domains (TEADs) cannot promote the expression
  of target genes. (Right) Ovarian fragmentation leads to actin polymerization, resulting
  in nuclear translocation of YAP. Nuclear YAP interacted with TEADs to increase the
  expression CCN growth factors and baculoviral inhibitors of apoptosis repeat containing
  (BIRC) apoptosis inhibitors, resulting in follicle growth.
