caption: 'A hypothetical, step-by-step model of hypoxia response pathway interactions
  in C. elegans neurons is shown for conditions of either (A-D) normoxia or (E-H)
  hypoxia. (A) Under normoxia, oxygen binds to and activates EGL-9 (pink ovals). Oxygen
  also activates SEK-1 and PMK-1 (p38 MAPK, green and yellow ovals, respectively)
  through a mechanism that remains unknown. Activated p38 MAPK in turn phosphorylates
  one or more proteins (possible EGL-9 itself, as speculated in this cartoon with
  a ‘P’ in a yellow circle) that activate EGL-9 and trigger its recruitment to endosomes.
  Meanwhile, GLR-1 receptors (red channels) undergo continual endocytosis at the synapse.
  (B) Isoform EGL-9E, now bound to oxygen and possibly phosphorylated by p38 MAPK,
  becomes localized to endosomes, where it binds the PDZ-PTB domain protein LIN-10
  (orange oval) and recruits it to endosomes by preventing its phosphorylation by
  the CDK-5 kinase (purple oval). (C) Once at endosomes, LIN-10 promotes the recycling
  of endocytosed GLR-1 AMPARs (red channels in the endosome) back to the synapse.
  (D) The final outcome is that GLR-1 synaptic levels are maintained. (E) Under hypoxia,
  lack of oxygen results in lower SEK-1/PMK-1 p38 MAPK activity and inactive EGL-9.
  (F) In the absence of oxygen, EGL-9E does not bind to LIN-10. This exposes the LIN-10
  N-terminus (the localization domain of LIN-10) to CDK-5, which phosphorylates it,
  thereby inhibiting LIN-10 recruitment to endosomes. (G) Without endosomal LIN-10,
  GLR-1 AMPARs continue undergoing endocytosis from synapses but are not recycled,
  resulting in their accumulation in elongated endosomal compartments. (H) The final
  outcome is that GLR-1 synaptic levels become depleted.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12010.013'
