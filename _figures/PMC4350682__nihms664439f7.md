caption: Proposed model of MOTS-c as a mitochondrial signaling peptide encoded in
  the mtDNA that regulates metabolic homeostasis. MOTS-c targets the skeletal muscle
  and acts on the folate cycle (one carbon pool) and inhibits the directly tethered
  de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. This leads to the accumulation of the de novo
  purine synthesis intermediate AICAR that is also a potent activator of the metabolic
  regulator AMPK, thus partially mediating the metabolic effects of MOTS-c.
