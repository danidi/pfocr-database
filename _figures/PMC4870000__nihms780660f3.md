caption: 'Contribution of nitro-oxidative stress to mitochondrial dysfunction. During
  mitochondrial respiration, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway produces the proton
  gradient required for ATP production. Electrons leaking from the electron transport
  chain react with molecular oxygen to produce potentially damaging O2−, which has
  the potential to generate other reactive oxygen species and—via interaction with
  NO—peroxynitrite. Under normal conditions, the antioxidant defence system (including
  MnSOD, catalase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase) adequately reduces superoxide
  to water and molecular oxygen; however, if these mechanisms are overwhelmed, formation
  of peroxynitrite increases. In turn, peroxynitrite induces a bioenergetic deficit
  by disrupting the activities of metabolic enzymes, mitochondrial electron transport
  chain proteins, ATP synthase, and membrane transport proteins., Notably peroxynitrite-induced
  damage to MnSOD creates a feed-forward mechanism for enhancing its own production,
  thus facilitating the hazardous accumulation of superoxide., Blue lines indicate
  pathways for the formation of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, red
  lines indicate potential targets of peroxynitrite-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
