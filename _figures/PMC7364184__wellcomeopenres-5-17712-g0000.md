caption: Under normal circumstances, the presence of endothelial protein C receptor
  (EPCR)-activated protein C (aPC) on the endothelial surface is able to modulate
  the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) response (by cleavage of R46) to thrombin
  along a cytoprotective pathway. In the presence of IE, the binding site for aPC
  can be occupied by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) or EPCR
  expression can be reduced, both limiting the availability of EPCR-aPC and resulting
  in cytopathic responses due to unmodified thrombin cleavage (R41) of PAR1. P. falciparum-infected
  erythrocytes (IE) are also able to release soluble factors that can influence endothelial
  integrity directly.
