caption: 'DNA synthesis on damaged template. The localization of lesion in the DNA
  template influences the choice of DNA damage repair/tolerance pathway. The damage
  of already replicated DNA strand is subject to DNA repair by pathway dedicated to
  deal with particular lesion, such as BER, NER, HR, etc (left panel of the figure).
  When DNA lesion happens in ssDNA, e.g. in the replication fork (the middle part
  of the figure) or in ssDNA gaps left after replication (right panel of the figure),
  the DNA synthesis process has to be applied. However, replication over the lesion
  is not an easy task, and typically requires switching of polymerases. Various TLS
  polymerases are able to overcome the lesion that blocked DNA replication; switching
  back to DNA replicative polymerase resumes normal replication (one TLS polymerase
  scenario, A). Sometimes, the polymerase that is able to add the nucleotide opposite
  the lesion is unable to elongate synthesis. Therefore, resumption of synthesis requires
  the cooperation of three DNA polymerases (B). To fill the gap one more, RPA-dependent
  step is needed: the recruitment of a sliding clamp to the 3′-OH end of the DNA gap.
  Then the repair can proceed as described above.'
