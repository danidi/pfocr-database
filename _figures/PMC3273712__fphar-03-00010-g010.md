caption: According to these data in primary VSMCs we propose that BAY stimulates sGC
  and promotes synthesis of cGMP which directly activates PKG and phosphorylates VASP
  pSer239 thus inhibiting cell migration (Chen et al., ). Cyclic GMP can also inhibit
  PDE3, thereby inhibiting degradation of cAMP and increasing the duration of its
  signal. An increase in cAMP can lead to stimulation of PKA and phosphorylation of
  VASP pSer157, resulting in proliferation of VSMCs (Chen et al., ). Our data indicate
  that an increase in cAMP in the presence of an increase in cGMP leads to negative
  regulation of VASP phosphorylation. Additionally, cyclic AMP can also stimulate
  PKG directly and activate its signaling pathway (Cornwell et al., ). These data
  also argue for crosstalk among the kinases where PKA can phosphorylate pSer239 and
  PKG pSer157. Lastly, PDE4 can regulate the increases in cAMP and therefore regulate
  phosphorylation of VASP.
