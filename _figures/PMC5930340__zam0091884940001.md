caption: Biosynthesis of melanins from T4HN in bacteria and fungi. (A) The pathway
  of biosynthesis of 1,8-DHN by bacterial and fungal enzymes. The bacterial and fungal
  enzymes are represented in plain and italic letters, respectively. Under the enzyme
  description, family names of enzymes are given in brackets. (B) HPQ melanin and
  mompain biosynthesis by bacterial enzymes. Boldface numbers represent compound numbers.
