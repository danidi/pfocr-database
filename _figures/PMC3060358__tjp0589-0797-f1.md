caption: Metazoan cells have evolved to be capable of sensing levels of physiological
  gasses in the microenvironment through highly conserved pathways in the control
  of gene expression. Acute O2 and CO2 sensing leads to neuronally mediated changes
  in processes such as respiratory control and olfactory sensation, respectively.
  Molecular oxygen (O2) is sensed by prolyl and aspariginyl hydroxylases, which confer
  oxygen-dependent instability upon the HIF transcription factor. Activation of this
  pathway in hypoxia leads to the expression of adaptive genes. The sensor for regulation
  of NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to changes in CO2 has yet to be defined.
  However, elevated CO2 leads to repression of the NF-κB pathway and decreased levels
  of genes which promote innate immunity and inflammation.
