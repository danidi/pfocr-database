caption: Targeting the Notch pathway in tumorigenesis. Several therapeutic approaches
  against cancer target the Notch pathway at different levels. Gamma secretase blockers
  are inhibiting the process of S3 cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD),
  thereby blocking downstream gene transcription. Agents blocking receptor–ligand
  interaction, namely antibody OMP21M18 binds the Notch extracellular domain (NECD),
  thereby preventing proteolytic cleavage. While MEDI0639 inhibits the direct interaction
  of ligand and receptor. The decoy N1110-24 blocks JAG1/JAG2 mediated Notch1 signaling,
  while N11-13 blocks DLL1-DLL4-mediated NOTCH1 signaling. The blocker of transcription
  IMR-1, disrupts the recruitment of Mastermind-like1 to the Notch activation complex
  on chromatin. Whereas the mastermind-like proteins (MALM) peptide competes with
  endogenous MAML in the cell, reducing the affinity of the endogenous MAML binding
  to NICD and CSL in the transcription complex.
