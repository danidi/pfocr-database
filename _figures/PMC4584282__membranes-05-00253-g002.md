caption: 'Schematic representation of ligand-mediated receptor endocytosis and trafficking
  pathways: Ligand-binding to cell surface receptors leads to a selective recruitment
  of ligand-receptor complexes (cargo) into clathrin-coated pits. The coated pit represents
  a small area of the plasma membrane, which invaginates and pinches off into vesicles
  in the cytoplasmic compartments. The coated vesicles trigger the recruitment of
  APs for example AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, AP-4, and AP-5 as well as other interacting protein
  molecules such as disabled-2 (Dab-2) and Golgi-localizing gamma adaptor homology
  domain binding protein (GGA). The clathrin-dependent routes require dynamin to achieve
  the fission of membrane invaginations and subsequent internalization of vesicle
  into the cell interior. The ligand-receptor complexes within the vesicles entering
  via clathrin pathway are usually directed to early endosomes. Within the endosomes,
  ligand-receptor complexes are sorted and directed to various subcellular compartments,
  where the internalized receptors are either routed to degradative compartments such
  as late endosomes, multi vascular bodies, and/or lysosomes, or recycled back to
  the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Alternatively, the internalized cargo
  may be sequestered in endosomes for a longer period of time and continue to spark
  signaling events. Some early and late endosomes also contain membrane structures
  in the lumen, which are referred to as multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs). The endosomes
  and lysosomes can also transmit and receive cargo from trans-Golgi network (TGN)
  involving vesicular intermediate carriers. The key proteins involved in the trafficking
  of molecules at different locations may include: AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, AP-4, AP-5, Dab-2,
  and GGA.'
