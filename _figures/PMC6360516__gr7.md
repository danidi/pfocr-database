caption: LIMK2-Mediated Cofilin1 Phosphorylation Signals TGF-β1-Induced GC InsensitivityPhospho-cofilin1
  is implicated as a key link in the chain of signalling behavior of TGF-β1-induced
  GC insensitivity. The activation of LIMK2 appears to be independent of known upstream
  regulators ROCK or Cdc42. Phospho-cofilin1-activated PLD mediates SMRT induction,
  which limits GR target gene regulation. The interventions including small-molecule
  inhibitors and siRNA are summarized in boxes.
