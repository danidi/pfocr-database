caption: '(A) PD-1 signaling pathway. The binding of PD-L1 or PD-L2 to its receptor
  PD-1 results in the phosphorylation of PD-1''s ITSM and ITIM tyrosine motifs, which
  are located on its cytoplasmic domain. Phosphorylation leads to the recruitment
  of protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as SHP2. SHP2 subsequently inhibits two important
  pathways: One, it competes with kinases to prevent the activation of PI3K by phosphorylation.
  This inhibits phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3, thereby inhibiting Akt activation.
  Deactivation of serine-threonine kinase Akt reduces T cell proliferation, increases
  apoptosis, and promotes T cell exhaustion. Effector functions such as cytokine production
  and cytolytic function are also reduced. Two, SHP2 inhibits the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway.
  Dephosphorylation of ZAP-70 and LCK antagonize the positive downstream effects of
  the MHC-TCR pathway, leading to deactivation of PLC-γ, Ras-GRP1 and MEK/ERK1. ERK1
  normally activates transcription factors that induce T cell proliferation and differentiation.
  Thus, decreased ERK1 activation reduces proliferation and differentiation potential.
  (B) Blockade of PD-1. In the presence of a PD-1 blocking antibody, the engagement
  of PD-1 and its ligands is inhibited. Consequently, SHP2 is not activated and neither
  PI3K/Akt pathway nor Ras-MEK-ERK pathway are repressed. Activated AKT and ERK support
  T cell cytokine production, proliferation, and differentiation. Furthermore, PD-1
  blockade reduces T cell exhaustion and the rate of apoptosis. ITSM, immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based switch motif; ITIM: immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif;
  SHP2, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; PIP2, phosphoinositide-3,4-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate;
  Ras, rat sarcoma; MEK, MAK-/ERK-kinase; ERK1, extracellular-signal regulated kinases
  1; Zap-70, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70; LCK, lymphocyte-specific protein
  tyrosine kinase; PLC-γ, Phosphoinositide phospholipase C-γ.'
