caption: Schematic representation of the metabolic engineering strategy for glutarate
  production by recombinant C. glutamicum. The biosynthetic pathway for glutarate
  production was implemented by heterologous expression in a L-lysine producer and
  coupled with endogenous L-glutamate synthesis. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle; AR, anaplerotic reactions; glnA, glutamine synthase gene;
  gltBD, glutamine aminotransferase complex genes; gdh, glutamate dehydrogenase; ldcC,
  L-lysine decarboxylase; patA, putrescine transaminase; patD, γ-aminobutyraldehyde
  dehydrogenase; gabT, GABA/5AVA amino transferase gene; gabD, succinate/glutarate-semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase gene. Magenta arrows depict transamination reaction in the 5AVA pathway.
  Green arrows depict transamination reaction in the glutarate pathway. Gray shadowed
  genes are originally from E. coli and were added by heterologous overexpression.
  Green shadowed genes are originally from C. glutamicum, P. putida, P. syringae,
  or P. stutzeri and were added by heterologous overexpression.
