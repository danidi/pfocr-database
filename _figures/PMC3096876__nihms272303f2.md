caption: Mitochondria-targeted neuroprotective interventions for acute injury to the
  immature brain. One common early trigger of neuronal injury following either cerebral
  ischemia or head trauma is an abnormal elevation of intracellular Ca2+, which if
  unabated, will directly lead to cellular necrosis through activation of degradative
  enzymes, e.g., phospholipases and proteases. Elevated Ca2+ can also induce delayed
  cell death by inducing mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, e.g., through activation
  of the permeability transition pore (PTP), and by stimulation of activating enzymes
  that produce reactive O2 species (ROS), e.g., NADPH oxidase (NOX) and nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS). The ROS contribute to mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, stimulate
  cellular inflammatory responses, e.g., microglial activation, and modify many different
  molecules throughout the cell including lipids, proteins, and DNA. DNA damage activates
  poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, which consumes NAD+, thus impairing energy metabolism.
  Pro-apoptotic molecular pathways, including those activated by inflammatory cytokines,
  lead to the release of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins, e.g., cytochrome c (Cyt
  c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Calpain cleavage of molecules, e.g., AIF
  and Bid, also promotes the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Potentially
  neuroprotective interventions that target these pathways include the PTP inhibitor
  2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), the ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener diazoxide,
  normoxic resuscitation, the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane (SFP), calpain inhibitors,
  the PARP inhibitor 3-amino benzoamide (3ABA), estrogen, which induces Bcl2 expression,
  Bax inhibitors, and several agents that stimulate aerobic energy metabolism, including
  free carnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine, β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), NAD+ or its precursor
  nicotinamide, and pyruvate.
