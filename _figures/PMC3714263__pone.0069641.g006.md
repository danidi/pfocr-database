caption: Depicted is a model of ERK positive feedback with quantitative U0126-treated
  to DMSO-treated SILAC ratio heatmaps beside individual proteins, corresponding to
  the changes in phosphorylation between the two conditions across the four time points
  of TCR stimulation. Heatmaps were calculated from the averages of four biological
  replicate experiments. Green represents elevated phosphorylation in response to
  U0126 treatment relative to DMSO-treated controls, whereas red represents a decrease
  in phosphorylation relative to DMSO-treated controls. Blanks in the heatmap indicate
  that a clearly defined SIC peak was not observed for that phosphopeptide in that
  time point. Black represents no change. White dots within the heatmap indicate a
  statistically significant difference (q value <0.02) in the comparison between U0126-treated
  and control DMSO-treated SILAC ratios for that time point. Below each heatmap square
  is a color bar representing the percent CV for that time point. Orange represents
  a high degree of variation, while black represents a low degree of variation amongst
  the replicate analyses. Blanks indicate a lack of replicate data required to accurately
  determine the CV.
