caption: Model of the effects of the growth factor Wnt in receptor-mediated endocytosis
  (micropinocytosis) and in receptor-independent endocytosis of proteins from extracellular
  fluids (macropinocytosis). The Wnt coreceptors Lrp6 and Fz are incorporated into
  receptor-mediated small microendocytic vesicles, triggering an as yet unknown signal
  that causes actin cytoskeleton remodeling in the lamellipodium at the leading edge
  of the cell, forming membrane ruffles and macropinocytic cups that engulf large
  amounts of the surrounding liquid. Both types of endosomes fuse into common MVBs/late
  endosomes that contain GSK3 and PRMT1 and require the ESCRT machinery for their
  formation. In the presence of Wnt, BSA incorporated by macropinocytosis is channeled
  to degradation in lysosomes, providing a source of nutrition for cells in which
  Wnt signaling is activated. The recycling of membrane from macropinocytic vesicles
  may help drive the considerable increase in microautophagy observed in MVBs/late
  endosomes shortly after Wnt treatment ().
