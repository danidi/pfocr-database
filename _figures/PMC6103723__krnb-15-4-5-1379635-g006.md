caption: Activation and cross-regulation of the GAAC and TOR pathways. Both the GAAC
  and TOR pathways respond to changes in amino acid availability. The TORC1 complex
  monitors the availability of nitrogenous compounds and in response to nitrogen limitation,
  mounts a stress response by freeing Sit4p from its complex. Sit4p then dephosphorylates
  Gln3p, facilitating dissociation from Ure2p and allowing for translocation of Gln3p
  to the nucleus to activate NCR gene transcription. Sit4p also dephosphorylates S577
  on Gcn2p. Gcn2p is subsequently able to efficiently bind deacylated tRNA during
  periods of amino acid starvation. Activated Gcn2p phosphorylates eIF2α, decreasing
  levels of translation while increasing translation of Gcn4p. Gcn4p enters the nucleus
  and facilitates transcription of amino acid biosynthesis genes. Gcn4p and Gln3p
  co-regulate a subset of stress response genes which are common to both stress response
  pathways. The intersection of the aa-tRNA pool with the TOR pathway (blue arrows)
  occurs through Gcn2p, yet the exact mechanism of the interaction is unclear.
