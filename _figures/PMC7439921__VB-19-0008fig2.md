caption: Proposed model for exercise-induced changes in EC metabolism promoting angiogenesis.
  (Panel A) ECs are highly glycolytic and produce 85% of their energy glycolytically.
  Mitochondria do not significantly contribute to energy production but rather maintain
  NAD+/NADH balance. (Panel B) During exercise, increased CGL activity leads to H2S
  generation. CGL-derived H2S downregulates endothelial OXPHOS by inhibiting complex
  IV activity. This leads to increased glucose uptake, glycolysis and pentose phosphate
  pathway flux in an AMPK-dependent fashion. In addition, exercise-induced angiogenesis
  requires adequate activation of SIRT1, at least partially because endothelial SIRT1
  is required for VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. SIRT1 also controls EC function by inhibiting
  Notch (NICD indicates active Notch) and via inactivating FOXO1 (forkhead box O1,
  not shown). 3PG, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; AMPK, 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; CGL, cystathionine γ-lyase; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; NAD, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Pyr, pyruvate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT1,
  Sirtuin 1; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR2, vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor 2.
