caption: In the suggested fat mobilization pathway, SHP represses Hes6 expression
  via RAR. Decreased level of Hes6 then derepresses HNF4α-regulated PPARγ2 expression.
  Eventually, the overexpressed PPARγ2 induces fat accumulation via turning on lipogenic
  programs in the liver. On the contrary, RAR ligand atRA results in fat utilization
  via shutting down PPARγ2 expression. Purple and orange represent protein and gene,
  respectively. Arrow indicates promoter region binding and activation.
