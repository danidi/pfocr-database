caption: 'Schematic model for the regulation of parthenocarpic fruit formation by
  the components of hormonal signaling pathways. Parthenocarpy is induced by the action
  of several components involved in the signaling pathway of various hormones, especially
  ethylene, auxin, gibberellin and cytokinin. SlTPR1 and SlTIR1 could act as positive
  regulators of fruit set initiation, while AUCSIA, SlARF7, SlIAA9, SlDELLA and SlCHS
  could act as negative regulators of fruit set initiation. Three pat mutations, pat,
  pat2 and pat3/pat4, may be associated with GA synthesis or signaling. AUCSIA: auxin
  cum silencing action, SlARF7: Solanum lycopersicum auxin response factor 7, SlCHS:
  Solanum lycopersicum chalcone synthase, SlDELLA: Solanum lycopersicum DELLA, SlTIR1:
  Solanum lycopersicum transport inhibitor response protein 1, SlTPR1: Solanum lycopersicum
  tetratricopeptide repeat protein 1.'
