caption: DC restriction and type I IFN response. HIV-1 utilizes CD4 and chemokine
  receptors for entry. The restriction of cDC to HIV-1 infection occurs at the entry
  (fusion) and post-entry level. Of note, in order to investigate the step at the
  post-entry level, VSV-pseudotyped virus is frequently utilized, which enters cells
  by endocytosis. After entry, APOBEC3G and arsenic sensitive factor inhibit reverse
  transcription. However, Vpx can counteract this restriction in DC by either degrading
  (1) SAMHD1-nucleotide pool-reverse transcription pathway or (2) nuclear transport.
  In addition, because the proteasome inhibitor MG132 works in a similar fashion to
  Vpx, it is possible that Vpx interferes with the proteasomal degradation step of
  endocytosed virions by degrading DC factors other than SAMHD1. Whatever the case,
  Vpx causes the accumulation of numerous virus products in the cytosol (red arrows).
  Importantly, the accumulation of viral DNA and RNA may trigger the innate immune
  signaling, resulting in type I IFN production, followed by the maturation of DC.
