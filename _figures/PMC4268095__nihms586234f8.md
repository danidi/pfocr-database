caption: a. Like classic oncogenes (e.g. Ras and Raf), ICN1 induces senescence via
  intact cell-cycle checkpoint functions. In normal human esophageal keratinocytes,
  the p16INK4A-Rb pathway may have a predominant role in ICN1-induced senescence;
  however, the p14ARF, p53 and others may constitute alternative pathways to mediate
  senescence when the p16INK4A-Rb pathway is impaired. When cell-cycle checkpoint
  functions are fully impaired (e.g. concurrent Rb and p53 inactivation), cells fail
  to undergo senescence in response to ICN1, resulting in malignant transformation.b.
  Endogenous Notch1 may serve as a tumor suppressor by mediating TGF-β-induced senescence.
  TGF-β has been implicated in replicative senescence as well as oncogene-induced
  senescence, . TGF-β requires p53 to transactivate p21. Notch1 may be targeted for
  inactivation by HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 during malignant transformation. E6 may
  suppress Notch1 by degrading p53 . E7 also targets Rb for degradation or sequestration.
  We find that HPV E6 and E7 inhibit TGF-β signaling to prevent the activation of
  endogenous Notch1 and induction of p16INK4A and p21. While TGF-β may induce CDKIs
  independent of Notch1, Notch1 may regulate the SABG activity independent of cell-cycle
  regulation. Since oncogeneinduced senescence may involve autophagy and lysosomal
  functions, Notch signaling may regulate the activity of SABG, a lysosomal enzyme
