caption: Model for the impact of deubiquitylation on TGF-β responsiveness. Schematic
  of events within a cell stimulated by a TGF-β ligand activating the canonical Type
  I receptor kinase (RI) pathway. RI activation leads to phosphorylation of R-Smad
  (blue) directly on its C-Terminus (purple P). A blue arrow indicates the direction
  of phosphate transfer from RI to R-Smad. C-terminal phosphorylated R-Smad moves
  into the nucleus (rightmost black arrow). Cells normally contain pools of monoubiquitylated
  Co-Smads (pink with green ubiquitin) and one or more deubiquitylases (in this example
  USP9X in dark green). A subset of Co-Smads are deubiquitylated by USP9X (red arrow)
  allowing them to move into the nucleus (leftmost black arrow). In the nucleus the
  deubiquitylated Co-Smad and the phosphorylated R-Smad form an activated complex
  (middle arrows) that drives TGF-β responses. The magnitude of the response is dictated
  by the relative frequency of R-Smad phosphorylation and Co-Smad deubiquitylation—as
  seen in Drosophila embryonic dorsal ectoderm cells ().
