caption: STRA6 binds extracellular holo-RBP4 and mediates transport of retinol to
  receptor-associated cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1). Retinol transfer
  triggers phosphorylation of STRA6, resulting in recruitment and activation of JAK2
  and its associated transcription factors STAT3/STAT5. Activated STAT translocates
  to the nucleus where it induces target gene expression. Upon binding retinol, CRBP1
  dissociates from STRA6 and delivers retinol to lecithin:retinol acyl transferase
  (LRAT) which catalyzes the formation of retinylesters. STRA6 (GeneID 64220RBP) was
  drawn in accordance with prediction of a model generated by the software http://bp.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp/sosui.
