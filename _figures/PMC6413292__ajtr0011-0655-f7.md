caption: After the skin was injured to form a wound, the alarm signal has bound and
  activated the NLRP3 inflammasome by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  sustained a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype (M1) and inhibited upregulation
  of the pro-healing macrophage phenotype (M2). However, our studies results showed
  that metformin regulated AMPK/mTOR/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling axis to promote
  the M2 macrophages polarization which will accelerate the wound healing.
