caption: The protective or pathogenic roles of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in liver
  diseases. The hepatic ILC subsets are involved in the immune regulation of liver
  diseases (viral hepatitis, mechanical liver injury, and fibrosis). ① In hepatic
  adenovirus (Ad) or HCV infection, hepatic ILC1s play an important role in maintaining
  liver tolerance. Hepatic viral infection increases NKG2A expression on ILC1s, and
  NKG2A signaling in ILC1s inhibits CXCL9 expression, which is required for the accumulation
  of IFN-γ+CD49b+ NK cells (cNK cells). This, in turn, results in the loss of IFN-γ
  production, which is crucial for the enhanced priming of CD8+ T cells. ② Hepatic
  ILC1s and cNKs contribute to liver regeneration. cNK cells and ILC1s produce a high
  level of IL-22 in response to elevated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and IL-23 in
  an ATP receptor P2X1 (P2-type nucleotide receptors)-dependent manner; IL-22 promotes
  hepatocyte growth via activation of the STAT3 pathway. ③ Hepatic cNK or ILC1s limit
  liver fibrosis. The inflammatory cytokine TNFα increases expression of TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on cNK cells, and then enhances cNK cell-mediated
  hepatic stellate cell (HSC) killing. The high expression of TRAIL may lead to hepatic
  ILC1s having similar effects to the killing of activated HSC, thus limiting liver
  fibrosis. ④ In Ad-induced liver inflammation, ILC2s exhibit a hepatoprotective role.
  The expression of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 in the liver are increased, and the
  ILC2s expand in response to IL-33 and limit liver injury by suppressing TNFα production
  in hepatic T cells and macrophages. ⑤ In Con A-induced hepatitis, hepatic ILC2s
  are activated and expanded in response to IL-33, further amplifying inflammatory
  immune responses via IL-5-mediated recruitment of eosinophils. The inflammatory
  activity of ILC2s might be regulated by IL-33-expanded CD4+Foxp3+regulatory T cells
  (Treg). ⑥ In CCl4-or thioacetamide (TAA)-induced chronic hepatocellular stress,
  IL-33 activates ILC2s, producing IL-13, leading to HSC activation through IL-13Rα1-
  and STAT6-dependent signaling. ⑦ Hepatitis B virus infection induces IL-23 production
  by antigen-presenting cells, and the increased IL-23 contribute to liver damage
  via IL-17 production, possibly by activating the IL-23 receptor-expressing ILC3s.
  ⑧ In CCl4-induced acute hepatitis, the IL-22-producing ILC3s inhibit liver injury
  via IL-22 production. ⑨ In the pathogenesis of hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury
  (IRI), RORγt-expressing NKp46+ cells are capable of ameliorating hepatic IRI in
  an IL-22-dependent manner.
