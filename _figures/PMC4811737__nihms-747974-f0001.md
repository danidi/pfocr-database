caption: Cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in regulating the balance between
  tolerance and rejection in the mouse liver transplant model. Donor-derived cells,
  such as dendritic cells (DC) are found in lymphoid tissues in long-surviving, fully
  allogeneic mouse liver transplant recipients. Donor-derived DC and NKT cells, but
  not Kupffer cells, have been reported to play an important role in the establishment
  of mouse liver transplant tolerance. Enhanced production of IL-12 by donor DC (as
  the result of Flt3L administration to the liver donor) or exogenous IL-2 can promote
  cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and leads to graft rejection. The transmembrane adaptor
  protein DNAX-activating protein of 12kDa (DAP12) expression by the allograft appears
  to be a critical molecule that regulates the induction of liver transplant tolerance
  since its absence results in enhanced host CTL and reduced regulatory T cells. Similarly,
  IFNγ signaling appears to be required for mouse liver allograft acceptance; host-derived
  IFNγ induces programed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) up-regulation on donor-derived stellate
  cells that in turn, promote apoptosis of graft-infiltrating CTLs. The Fas/FasL pathway
  also appears to play a critical role in mouse liver transplant tolerance, but the
  exact mechanisms have not yet been elucidated.
