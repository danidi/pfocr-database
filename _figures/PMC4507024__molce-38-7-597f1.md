caption: The ethylene biosynthetic pathway and its intermediates. S-adenosyl methionine
  (SAM) synthase uses methionine as a precursor for SAM. SAM is subsequently converted
  to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in the first committed step in the
  ethylene biosynthesis by a family of ACC synthase (ACS) proteins, resulting in the
  release of methylthioadenosine (MTA). ACC is then finally converted to ethylene
  by ACC oxidase (ACO). MTA is recycled back to Yang cycles. Dashed line indicates
  additional enzymatic steps in the Yang cycle.
