caption: A conserved regulatory pathway determines the accumulation of Ups1 and Ups2
  in the intermembrane space, which regulate the phospholipid composition of mitochondrial
  membranes. Ups1 and Ups2 are unstable proteins that are degraded by the i-AAA protease
  Yme1 and in the case of Ups1, also by Atp23. Binding of Mdm35 stabilizes Ups1 and
  Ups2 against proteolysis and ensures accumulation of both proteins in the intermembrane
  space. Both Ups1 and Ups2 have been found to be membrane associated (; ) but are
  shown as soluble proteins in the IMS for simplicity. See text for details. IM, mitochondrial
  inner membrane; IMS, mitochondrial intermembrane space; OM, mitochondrial outer
  membrane.
