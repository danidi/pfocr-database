caption: Upon activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, Frizzled (dark blue
  line) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) activate
  the protein Dishevelled (DSH), leading to Axin recruitment. The β-catenin (β-cat)
  “destruction complex”, composed of the proteins Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli
  (APC), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3β) and GSK3-binding protein (GBP), is not
  able to phosphorylate β-cat, resulting in its accumulation and translocation into
  the nucleus. Interaction of nuclear β-cat with CREB-binding protein (CBP) leads
  to an active transcriptional complex for downstream target genes by binding to T-cell
  factor (TCF)- and lymphoid enhancer-binding protein (LEF)-family transcription factors.
  The Wnt inhibitor small molecule ICG-001 specifically binds to CBP thereby disrupting
  the interaction of CBP with β-cat. In the presence of Gal-4, overall β-cat levels
  in the cell are decreased and thus less ICG-001 is required to disrupt the interaction
  of CBP with β-catenin. Gal-4 can bind to axin, β-cat and APC, as shown in CRC [].
  Possibly, Gal-4 cross-links these components, thereby stabilizing the destruction
  complex, and enhancing degradation of β-cat. Furthermore, Gal-4 is shown to inhibit
  the IL-6/NF-kB/STAT3 pathway [], to induce expression of the Wnt signaling inhibitor
  protein Naked1, and is involved in maintaining p27 levels in CRC [, , ]. Collectively,
  these effects due to involvement of Gal-4 might contribute to reduced cell migration.
