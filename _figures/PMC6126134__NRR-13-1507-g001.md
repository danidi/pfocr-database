  pathway: the canonical pathway is inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK)-dependent and
  IκB-dependent. Stimulation through receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  and T cell receptors (TCRs) leads to the activation of IKK complex, which phosphorylates
  IκBα and leads to its proteasomal degradation. Following the degradation of IκBα,
  heterodimer p65/p50 translocates to the nucleus and activates downstream gene transcription.
  Non-canonical NF-κB pathway: the non-canonical pathway is strictly dependent on
  IKKα, but independent of IKKβ, NF-κB essential modulator regulatory subunit (NEMO),
  and IκBα. Ligand-induced activation of receptors such as CD40 leads to the activation
  of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). NIK specifically phosphorylates and activates IKKα
  homodimers. IKKα phosphorylation induces the polyubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation of the NF-κB2 (p100) precursor to its active form, p52. Then, the newly
  formed heterodimer RelB/p52 translocates to the nucleus, resulting in the transcription
  of target genes. Atypical NF-κB Pathway: the atypical pathway is IKK-independent
  but IκBα dependen. This pathway is usually activated by the stimulation of the tyrosine
  kinase receptor or after oxidative challenge. After stimulation, IκBα is phosphorylated
  on Tyr 42 or on serine residues in the IκBα PEST domain. IκBα phosphorylation leads
  to the release of p65/p50, which translocates to the nucleus and transcribes the
  target genes. BCR: B cell receptors; IL-1R: interleukin-1 receptor; UV: ultraviolet;
