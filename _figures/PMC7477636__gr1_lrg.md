caption: Schematic illustration of the hepatic uptake of the LNPs via the ApoE-HSPG-LDLR
  pathway and the GalNAc-ASGPR pathway.Regarding the former pathway, the blood clearance
  rate is rapid due to ApoE-mediated binding to hepatic HSPGs, resulting in accumulation
  in the space of Disse. After this accumulation, the LNPs are taken up by hepatocytes.
  Regarding the latter pathway, the LNPs are gradually cleared from the blood circulation
  and are taken up by hepatocytes in a sequential manner. ApoE; apolipoprotein E,
  ASGPR; asialoglycoprotein receptor, GalNAc; N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, HSPG; heparan
  sulfate proteoglycan, LDLR; low density lipoprotein receptor, LNP; lipid nanoparticle,
  LSEC; liver sinusoidal endothelial cell. This figure is reprinted from [] with permission
