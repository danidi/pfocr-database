caption: Ad attachment to the host cell is initiated by the fiber protein interacting
  with the cellular CAR receptor or CD46, followed by interaction between the Ad penton
  base and cellular integrin (1). Ad enters the cell through the endocytic pathway
  and the viral particle is partially degraded inside the endosome before being released
  into the cytosol (2). At the nuclear-pore complex, the viral particle is disassembled
  (3). The Ad DNA-core protein VII complex is transported through the nuclear-pore
  complex and VII proteins are released from viral genome by early gene transcription
  (4). E1A is the first viral protein expressed (5) during Ad infection and induces
  the expression of other early genes that facilitate viral replication and counteract
  cellular responses to infection (6). After replication occurs (7), the major late
  promoter is activated to produce late proteins, which are required for the formation
  of empty procapsids (8). Following encapsidation of the viral genome (9), a viral
  encoded protease proteolyzes multiple viral proteins inside the virus particle to
  generate a mature virion that is released from the infected cell (10).
