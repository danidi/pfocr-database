caption: Schematics illustrating the role of DCs in triggering HIV-1 reactivation.
  AIDS-associated pathogens (such as M. bovis BCG) or bacterial compound LPS mature
  DCs to secrete TNF-α into the supernatant to reactivate HIV-1 from latency. Alternatively,
  co-culture with HIV-1 latently infected T cells mature DCs through CD40-CD40L signaling
  pathway, and these matured DCs secrete TNF-α to activate T cells, allowing HIV-1
  reactivation.
