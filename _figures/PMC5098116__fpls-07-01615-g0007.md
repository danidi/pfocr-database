caption: 'Schematic representation of the supply of precursors for the anthocyanin
  biosynthetic pathway. The formation of two reaction substrates in anthocyanin biosynthesis,
  malonyl-CoA and 4-coumaroyl-CoA, were linked to glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway,
  shikimate pathway, and fatty acid metabolism. Enzymes identified by proteomics (marked
  with a dotted square) or SSH (marked with a dotted circle) were shown in bold uppercase
  letters (AccD, acetyl-CoA carboxyltransferase, β subunit; PFP, pyrophosphate: fructose
  6-phosphate 1- phosphotransferase; PFK, 6-phosphofructokinase; FBA, fructose-bisphosphate
  aldolase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ENO, enolase; PK: pyruvate
  kinase; PPDK: pyruvate phosphate dikinase; PDHB, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit
  β; TAL: transaldolase).'
