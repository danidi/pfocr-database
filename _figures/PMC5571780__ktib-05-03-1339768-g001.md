caption: Small GTPases in endothelial barrier regulation. Schematic, as seen from
  above, represents disorganized junctional complex versus organized junctional complex.
  Solid arrows depict pathway activation and dotted arrows indicate inactive pathway.
  (A) Pro-inflammatory cytokines or growth factors bind and activate their corresponding
  GPCRs or RTKs and activate the RhoA/ROCK/pMLC signaling pathway, which promotes
  formation of stress fibers and disrupts junctions causing an increase in paracellular
  permeability. (B) Activation of EPAC via cAMP or cAMP analog activates Rap by promoting
  GTP exchange. Rasip1 localizes to the junctional complex by binging HEG1 and interacting
  with active Rap at the cell border. Rasip1 can dimerize via its RA domain and bind
  2 Rap molecules at the plasma membrane. The active Rap-rasip1 complex and radil
  activates ArhGAP29, which inhibits RhoA activity and prevents loss of barrier.
