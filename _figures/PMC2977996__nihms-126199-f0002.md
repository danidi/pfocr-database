caption: ssDNA and RPA act as a substrate that is processed for HR. BRCA2/DSS1 helps
  to load Rad51 onto ssDNA and Rad51 polymerizes along the ssDNA to form a Rad51 nucleoprotein
  filament. As it does so, RPA is displaced from ssDNA. The factors that regulate
  BRCA2 recruitment and the putative ‘switch’ of ssDNA/RPA from signaling to Rad51
  loading functions are unknown. The Rad51 nucleoprotein filament invades a homologous
  dsDNA molecule, assisted by other recombination proteins (not shown)
