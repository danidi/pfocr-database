caption: NF-κB signaling pathway, inflammation, and carcinogenesis induced ROS. Excessive
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from mitochondrial membrane, xenobiotics,
  and enzyme reactions activate IKK. Activated IKK phosphorylates IκB and leads to
  ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of IκB, releasing NF-κB proteins, such
  as p50 and p65. The free p50 and p65 translocate into nuclei and drive target gene
  expression, such as inflammatory cytokines, leading to inflammatory lesions and
  carcinogenesis.
