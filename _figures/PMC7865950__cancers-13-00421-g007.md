caption: Schematic model of Treg prevalence in intestinal-type GC. Early-stage intestinal
  GC, that do not present vascular and perineural invasion, display higher density
  of Tregs. In vitro results indicate that Tregs might induce IL2Rα expression at
  the membrane of tumor cells, which might associate with activation of MAPK signaling
  pathway, increased proliferation, and spheroid growth. Further studies are required
  to understand the mechanism behind IL2Rα expression in tumor cells and its implications
  in future IO therapies.
