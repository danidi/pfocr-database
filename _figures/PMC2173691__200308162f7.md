caption: Mechanisms of E-cadherin regulation in sparse and dense cultures of colon
  cancer cells. In sparse cultures, E-cadherin expression is suppressed by two different
  mechanisms. One involves activation of ERK (P-ERK) by receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTK), such as ErbB-1 and ErbB-2. ERK activation induces Slug that inhibits E-cadherin
  expression by binding to the E-box of E-cadherin. The other pathway includes Slug
  induction by the β-catenin–TCF pathway. In dense cultures, the ERK pathway is inactive,
  the levels of ErbB-1, ErbB-2, and Slug are repressed and E-cadherin expression increases.
  This leads to recruitment of nuclear β-catenin to adherens junctions together with
  E-cadherin and the inhibition of β-catenin signaling. This further reduces Slug
  expression and relieves the inhibition on E-cadherin transcription resulting in
  elevated E-cadherin expression.
