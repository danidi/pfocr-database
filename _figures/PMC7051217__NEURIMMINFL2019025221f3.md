caption: 'Highly simplified cartoon of complement amplification loop pathways indicating
  (left, normal healthy condition) how C3/C3b levels reflect an equilibrium between
  2 cycles: one of C3 cleavage to form C3b that interacts with factor B, which is
  then cleaved by factor D to form the C3 convertase (C3bBb) to cleave more C3 and
  a CFI-dependent C3b inactivation cycle. In factor I deficiency (right), a lack of
  C3b inactivation causes uncontrolled accumulation of C3b, rapid consumption of C3,
  and activation of the downstream terminal pathway. Excessive activation of the C3b
  amplification loop can be inferred from CFB levels that are markedly reduced because
  of consumption. CFB = complement factor B; CFI = complement factor I.'
