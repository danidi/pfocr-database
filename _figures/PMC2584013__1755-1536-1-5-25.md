caption: 'ER stress and ROS in NAFLD/NASH. This figure describes the most relevant
  features of ER stress following excess accumulation of FFAs in hepatocytes and also
  involving oxidative stress and ROS (the latter may originate in NAFLD from deranged
  mitochondria, CYP2E1 and CYP4A isoforms, or from peroxisomes). On the basis of what
  is described in the text (sections ''ROS and oxidative stress-related reactive intermediates
  in NAFLD and NASH: their generation and the role in causing steatosis'' and ''Free
  fatty acids, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress and cell death: hepatocyte
  injury in NAFLD but not only''), the following major features can be offered. a)
  When the UPR response fails to solve the problem of protein folding caused by different
  conditions able to induce ER stress (see text for details), including increases
  in FFA levels, this is followed by an induction of apoptotic cell death that can
  use both mitochondrial pathways as well as other independent pathways. b) ROS and
  oxidative stress are able to disrupt ER functions, a major cause seemingly being
  ROS-dependent increased release of calcium from ER stores: excess calcium has been
  reported to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and, in turn, increased
  mitochondrial ROS release as a further contribution to increased intracellular levels
  by other sources and causes operating in NAFLD-related hepatocytes. c) In such a
  complex scenario, ER stress can result in apoptosis by a number of mechanisms, including:
  damage to mitochondria leading to cytochrome release, apoptosome formation and related
  sequential activation of executioner caspase 9 and 3; IRE-1 recruitment of TRAF-2
  in order to activate either ASK-1 and then JNK, a potentially pro-apoptotic pathway
  that can be further sustained by ROS, or (at least in mice) caspase 12, which, in
  turn, can activate caspases 9 and 3; and activation of PERK and ATF6 (p90), which
  can lead through nuclear translocation of ATF4 and ATF6(p50), respectively, to transcriptional
  up-regulation of CHOP, a factor that promotes apoptosis by either inhibiting expression
  of Bcl-XL or up-regulating expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Gadd34,
  Trb3 and Dr5.'
