caption: A, the ability of a MEK to interact with its cognate MAPK both by an active
  site-target residue interaction (1) and by a docking interaction (2) comprises,
  in principle, a “double selection” that has the potential to promote the efficiency
  and fidelity of MAPK activation. To aid conceptualization, these two interactions
  are shown as occurring simultaneously. Alternatively, they may occur in kinetically
  distinct steps (, ). The region of the MAPK that is phosphorylated by the MEK is
  represented by a chain of five circles. B, view of scaffolding as special case of
  docking (or visa versa). Compare with A, the scaffold protein is indicated by an
  S. C, overlapping roles of docking and scaffolding in promoting MAPK cascade signaling.
  MAPK activation is promoted by direct MEK-MAPK binding via the active site (1) and
  the docking site (2), and by binding of both MEK and MAPK to a scaffold (S) protein
  (3). In support of the scheme shown, it is known that the catalytic domain of Ste7
  binds to Ste5 (, ), whereas the N terminus of Ste7 binds to Fus3 (this study and
  Refs.  and ). It is likely, therefore, that Ste7 can bind to both Ste5 and Fus3
  simultaneously. We have shown here that mutations in the MAPK-docking site of MEK
  (2), combined with mutations in the MEK-binding site (3) of the scaffold Ste5, or
  with deletion of the scaffold entirely, leads to a synergistic reduction in MAPK
  activation in the yeast mating pheromone response pathway.
