caption: Model for cellular response to temperature up-shift and AZC treatment. AZC
  misfolds cellular protein into which it is incorporated. Misfolded protein specifically
  activates HSF, causing induction of HSE-driven transcripts and (by unknown mechanisms)
  subsequent repression of the ribosomal protein (rp) genes and G1 arrest. Temperature
  up-shift causes protein misfolding and thereby triggers the HSF-dependent events.
  The thermal trigger for the STRE regulon is unknown (?) but is independent of protein
  misfolding. The Pkc1 pathway is activated by thermal stress to the cell surface
  independently of misfolded proteins.
