caption: Potential therapeutic benefits of Selective D2R-β-arrestin2 ligands in prefrontal
  cortex and basal ganglia in schizophrenia. β-arrestin2 (βarr2)-biased ligands, such
  as UNC9994, can act as a D2R-βarr2 agonist in the hypodopaminergic prefrontal cortex
  but a D2R-βarr2 antagonist on hyperdopaminergic tone of striatopallidal MSNs. (A)
  In the hypodopaminergic state in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), D2R-βarr2 ligands
  can act as an agonist, which evokes action potential firing of cortical GABAergic
  fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) and promotes neurite outgrowth through the AKT/GSK3β
  pathway. In parallel, the reduced Gi activity induces the rise of intracellular
  cAMP levels, resulting in the transcriptional changes of neuronal plasticity-related
  genes including egr-1, and Bdnf. This cAMP increase also potentiates NMDA receptor
  activity through cAMP/PKA, eventually leading to transcriptional changes. These
  events would participate in long-lasting effects on the neuronal circuit to ameliorate
  cognitive impairment in the disorder. (B) In the hyperdopaminergic state of striatopallidal
  MSNs, D2R-βarr2 ligands can act as antagonists, promoting heterodimerization of
  A2a receptor (A2A) with D2R and leading to the activation of AKT, which in turn
  inhibits GSK3β activation. Meanwhile, D2R-βarr2 ligands have no effect on the Gi/o
  pathway. These events would ameliorate positive symptoms of schizophrenia with less
  adverse events (AEs) such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).
