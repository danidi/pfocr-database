caption: A, Proposed function of frataxin in normal mitochondria. B, Consequences
  of frataxin deficiency. Ferrochelatase catalyzes the final step of the heme biosynthetic
  pathway, which involves the insertion of Fe2+ into protoporphyrin IX (IX). This
  enzyme is localized to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is
  believed to be able to bind Fe2+ immediately after its reduction by the respiratory
  chain (Taketani et al. ). The initial step in the iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster biosynthetic
  pathway involves Fe2+ binding by the Isu1 and Isu2 proteins, which serve as scaffolds
  for cluster assembly (Muhlenhoff and Lill ). These proteins are localized to the
  mitochondrial matrix and may depend on frataxin for a sufficient supply of Fe2+.
  Both decreased biosynthesis and oxidative damage may contribute to Fe/S enzyme defects.
  ΔΨ = mitochondrial inner-membrane potential.
