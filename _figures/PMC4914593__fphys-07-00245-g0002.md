caption: Schematic representation of the colonocytes showing how deficiency in intestinal
  CaSR results in increased gut permeability and inflammation. Central panel, illustrates
  a current model of self-amplifying pathway for intestinal disease (Turner, ) where
  a small amount of luminal bacteria or bacteria-derived molecules pass across the
  epithelium to activate lamina propria immune cells, leading to secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., TNFα) and subsequent activation of their receptors (e.g., TNFR)
  in the epithelium. The latter increases MLCK transcription and activity and phosphorylation
  of myosin light chain (MLC), resulting in increased contractility of perijunctional
  actin-myosin ring and increased epithelial permeability. The consequences are greater
  access leakage of luminal materials, greater immune activation, and even greater
  barrier defects. The presence of CaSR ligands and signals limits amplifying of this
  cascade through activation of phosphodiesterase (PDE) (Geibel et al., ) and inhibition
  of MLCK (Cheng et al., ), leading to MLC dephosphorylation and barrier stabilization.
  Thus, in the presence of intact CaSR signaling, as in CaSR+∕+ mice, immune tolerance
  or only low-grade inflammation is seen (Right panel). However, in the absence of
  CaSR signal, as in CaSR−∕− mice, the limiting of this cascade amplification is lost,
  leading to immune activation and uncontrolled inflammation (Macleod, ; Cheng et
  al., ) (Left panel).
