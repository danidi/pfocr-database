caption: Gene expression profiles of glucosinolate (GS) and camalexin biosynthesis,
  as well as modification pathways, in response to Agrobacterium infection. Indole
  glucosinolate (iGS) and camalexin (a) and aliphatic glucosinolate (aGS) (b) pathways.
  The orange squares mark iGSs (a) and aGSs (b). Four squares next to the aGS pathway
  present the fold changes of key genes in shoots (top) and roots (bottom) at 2 h
  post‐infection (hpi) (left) and 24 hpi (right). The fold changes are shown in red
  for up‐regulation and green for down‐regulation as log2 values and Benjamini–Hochberg
  test correction [false discovery rate (FDR), P < 0.05]. The expression levels and
  P values of all the genes are also shown in Datasheet S2.
