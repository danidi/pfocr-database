caption: (Scheme 1). (a) Gene therapy illustration. The delivery of QR-siRNA nanoplexes
  suppress the expression of DARPP-32, EPK, and PP-1 protein which belong to dopaminergic
  signaling pathway. The reduced activation of this pathway results in less addiction
  behavior. (b) siRNAs were conjugated to QR by the electrostatic force (QR+) and
  the carbon-sulfur bond (QRmal).
