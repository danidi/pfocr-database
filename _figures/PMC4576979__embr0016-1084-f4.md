caption: As the major fuel for mammalian cells, glucose is first metabolized to pyruvate
  through anaerobic glycolysis. In the bulk of cancer cells, the majority of pyruvate
  is further fermented to lactate, even in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect).
  Only a minor portion of pyruvate is catabolized via the TCA cycle in the mitochondria.
  Although inefficient in ATP generation, the rapid flux of glycolytic pathway is
  advantageous to provide metabolic intermediates as biosynthetic substrates to support
  daughter cell production (anabolism). The glycolytic pathway is regulated by signaling
  pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and LKB1/AMPK pathways. The metabolic programs in
  CSCs are more divergent than the bulk of tumor cells. For some cancer types, CSCs
  also preferentially uses aerobic glycolysis. In other cancers, CSCs appear to rely
  on oxidative metabolism. Targeting metabolic programs in CSCs represents a promising
  strategy for cancer therapy. In glioma CSCs, for instance, DCA drives a metabolic
  shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. This is associated with increased
  expression of FOXO3 and p53, which further upregulates pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins.
  As a consequence, DCA treatment sensitizes glioma CSCs to Bax-dependent apoptosis
  in response to chemotherapy or irradiation. In the hematopoietic tissue, leukemia
  stem cells depend on FAO. Inhibition of FAO sensitizes apoptosis induction by Bcl-2
  antagonist. G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  PDK, PDH kinase; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; DCA, dichloroacetate.
