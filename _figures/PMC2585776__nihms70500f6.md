caption: Animals pretreated with vehicle and then with DOI (5mg/kg) showed the characteristic
  Fos response in both the lesioned (6A-1) and intact (6A-2) striatum, as well as
  the characteristic pERK1/2 response (6C-1) in the neonatal lesioned striatum. Pretreatment
  of neonatal lesioned rats with Ketanserin (40mg/kg), completely blocked DOI (5mg/kg)
  induced Fos-IR (6B-1, 6B-2) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (6D-1). Therefore ERK1/2
  phosphorylation in striatal neurons is mediated via drug induced activation of 5-HT2
  receptors. Scale bar = 1mm in 6A, 6B, 6C and 6D; 100μm in all other photomicrographs
