caption: The induction pathway of immunogenic cell death (ICD). In the figure, there
  are three main pathways of ICD induction. Most ICD inducers are endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress dependent, inducing the expression of damage‐associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) and triggering classic immunogenic cell death. Mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP) is another factor that stimulates NF‐κB activity and subsequently
  induces caspase‐independent cell death (CICD), which is also regarded as ICD
