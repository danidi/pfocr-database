caption: Different mechanisms of RTK signal attenuation. (A) Ligand-sequestration
  and binding inhibition. This panel illustrates the inhibitory role of the secreted
  protein Argos, which negatively regulates DER signaling sequestering the DER-activating
  ligand Spitz and preventing Spitz binding to DER. (B) Inhibition of RTK autophosphorylation.
  Examples of this type of inhibition include the cytosolic adapter/scaffold protein
  Mig6/Ralt/Gene33 and the PTP1B phosphatases. Mig6 binds to the intracellular domain
  of the EGFR and inhibits its autophosphorylation. Another way by which EGFRs can
  become deactivated is by the action of PTP1B protein tyrosine phosphatases that
  reduce ErbB2 receptor phosphorylation. (C) Inhibitory proteins that counteract downstream
  signaling. Trophic factor stimulation activates the Ras-Erk1/2 pathway, which ends
  in the induction of the Sprouty gene. Then, Sprouty in a negative-feedback loop
  deactivates this cascade by inhibiting the pathway at undetermined intermediates.
  The role of the phosphatidylinositol phosphatase PTEN as a specific attenuator of
  the RTK-PI3K-Akt pathway is also indicated. (D) Ligand-induced receptor ubiquitination
  and degradation. This panel illustrates the mechanism of RTK down-regulation mediated
  by the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Trophic factor binding to a RTK induces receptor
  autophosphorylation via receptor dimerization, followed by the subsequent activation
  of the Ras-Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. The ubiquitin-ligase c-Cbl interacts
  with the tyrosine-phosphorylated RTK and mediates its multi-ubiquitination. Receptor
  ubiquitination facilitates endocytosis and posterior lysosomal degradation of activated
  RTKs.
