caption: In the fed state, food-derived CoA is likely the main source of Pan, which
  is released in the bloodstream by the action of the extracellular degradation pathway
  in the intestine. The concentration of Pan in the blood is also regulated by urinary
  excretion. In the liver, feeding after a fast stimulates the intracellular degradation
  pathway to achieve a net decrease in total intracellular CoA levels, mainly driven
  by a decline in the concentration of free CoA. In the fasted state, systemic VNN1
  levels raise considerably in the blood and this enzyme could be involved in the
  recycling of Pan released from damaged cells or exocytosis. Another source of Pan
  is the microbiota. The contribution of recycled cellular content and microbiota
  to the circulating levels of Pan is currently unknown (dotted lines). Supported
  by decreased urinary excretion, Pan levels in the blood increase in the fasted state,
  making more substrate available for the increase in CoA synthesis observed in the
  liver. Concurrently, hepatic NUDT7 expression decreases. While NUDT8 levels remain
  unchanged with fasting and feeding, other mechanisms (allosteric and/or post-translational
  regulation) could modulate the activity of this mitochondrial enzyme, which would
  be expected to be higher in the fed state compared to the fasted state.
