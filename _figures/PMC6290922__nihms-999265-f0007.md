caption: a | In CD8+ T cells, T-bet (encoded by Tbx21) expression is induced by T
  cell receptor (TCR) and interleukin-12 receptor (IL-12R) signalling, whereas eomesodermin
  (EOMES) is upregulated later in a runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3)-dependent
  manner. RUNX3, T-bet and EOMES regulate the expression of interferon-γ (IFNγ), granzyme
  B (encoded by Gzmb), perforin (encoded by Prf) and CD122 in CD8+ effector cells.
  b | Strong TCR and IL-12R signalling promotes the terminal differentiation of short-lived
  effector cells (SLECs) by enhancing and maintaining the activity of the kinase mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream of signal transducer and activator of transcription
  4 (STAT4). mTOR simultaneously induces T-bet and represses EOMES expression through
  inhibition of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). The IL-2R–STAT5 pathway induces the expression
  of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1), inhibiting the expression
  of B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6), which is a transcriptional repressor of the Tbx21
  gene. Inhibition of mTOR activity by rapamycin or by activators of AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK), such as metformin, supports the development of memory precursor
  effector cells (MPECs). Similarly, enhanced MPEC formation is observed in low IL-2
  and IL-12 conditions. c | EOMES expression increases and T-bet levels decline in
  memory CD8+ T cells. Minimal levels of T-bet are maintained for proper expression
  of CD122, which promotes the homeostatic proliferation of memory cells. T-bet expression
  is associated with a more differentiated phenotype of effector memory T (TEM) cells
  and secondary and tertiary memory cells. d | P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1)hi
  LY6ChiT-bethi cells are terminally differentiated T helper 1 (TH1) effector cells.
  PSGL1hiLY6ClowT-betint cells are less differentiated, are longer lived and give
  rise to TH1 effector cells after re-challenge. T-bet is expressed at very low levels
  in T follicular helper (TFH) and TFH memory cells, as a result of BCL-6 expression.
  e | T-bet is a selective inducer of IFNγ-mediated IgG2a class-switching in B cells.
  T-bet is required for the survival of IgG2a+CD38hi memory B cells and it promotes
  the migration of IgG2a+ B cells to inflammatory foci through the transcriptional
  regulation of CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) expression. CCR7; CC-chemokine receptor
  7; IFNγR, IFNγ receptor; KLRG1; killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member
  1; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
