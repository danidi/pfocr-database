caption: Bile acid synthesis pathways. The classic and alternative bile acid synthesis
  pathways and major enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis. Major enzymes in the
  pathways are shown. CYP7A1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic bile acid
  synthesis pathway. In humans, hepatic bile acid synthesis produces the primary bile
  acid cholic acid and CDCA. In the small and large intestine, primary bile acids
  can be deconjugated by BSH and then modified by bacterial enzymes to produce secondary
  bile acids. Bacterial 7α-dehydroxylase removes C7 hydroxyl group to convert cholic
  acid to DCA and CDCA to LCA. Other secondary bile acids also exist at very low abundance
  in the bile acid pool. CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; DCA, deoxycholic acid; LCA,
  lithocholic acid; BSH, bile salt hydrolases.
