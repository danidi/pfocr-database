caption: 'A) Acute Kidney Injury: MSC EV provided reno-protection by horizontal transfer
  of IGF-1R mRNA to renal tubular cells and by activating ERK½ MAPK; B) Myocardial
  Infarction: MSC EV contained: 1) Integrins that could home exosomes to cardiomyocytes
  that expressed ICAM-1, a ligand for integrins, or to VCAM-1 on endothelial cells;
  2) CD73, present on the surface of exosomes, activated reperfusion injury salvage
  kinases by increased expression of pro-survival protein kinases such as Akt and
  ERK½; 3) CD59 (protectin), a widely expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
  membrane protein, prevented the formation of membrane attack complexes and inhibited
  complement-mediated lysis; 4) Glycolytic enzymes that could ameliorate energy deficit
  and potentially increase glycolytic flux and ATP production in the reperfused myocardium;
  5) Active 20S proteasomes, which is responsible for the degradation of approximately
  90% of all intracellular protein damaged by oxidation; 6) And microRNAs, such as
  the anti-apoptotic effect of miR-22, which directly targeted Mecp2 and reduced the
  expression of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis via miR-221; C) Liver Injury:
  MSC EV inhibited epithelial to mesenchymal transition and collagen production by
  suppressing the activation of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. MSC EV administration
  was also associated with higher expression of proliferation proteins (PCNA and cyclin
  D1), the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-xL, and STAT3; D) Brain Injury: MSCs transferred
  to injured neural cells EV microRNAs, such as miR-133b, which were involved in regeneration
  of motor neuron axons.'
