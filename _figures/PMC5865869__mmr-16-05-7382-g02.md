caption: Differentially-expressed gene pathway network generated using CluePedia.
  Interaction pathway networks for the identified (A) downregulated and (B) upregulated
  genes. The size of the circle indicates the number of genes involved in the pathway,
  and the color of the circle represents the P-value. The threshold for the analysis
  was set at P<0.05 and FDR<0.05. FDR, false discovery rate; NGF, nerve growth factor;
  NRAGE, MAGE family member D1; NRIF, neurotrophin receptor interacting factor; NADE,
  NAD synthetase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; NOD, atrophin
  1; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; HIF1, hypoxia-inducible factor
  1; HTLV-I, human T-lymphotropic virus I; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88; TRIF, toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 2.
