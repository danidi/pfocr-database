caption: EV71 induces neural cell apoptosis and autophagy through promoting ACOX1
  downregulation and ROS accumulation. In normal conditions, antioxidant response
  elements (AREs) are bound by small Maf dimers or other repressive factors like Bach1.
  Reactive oxidative stress (ROS) causes the nuclear translocation of NRF2. The activation
  of NRF2 is further promoted by positive pathway modulators like DJ-1. As a result,
  antioxidant response genes, like HO-1, are transcriptionally induced, and oxidative
  damage is minimized. In neural cells, including SK-N-SH cells and U251 cells, EV71
  infection results in ACOX1 downregulation through 3D protein, further leads to peroxisome
  reduction. ACOX1 and peroxisome reduction increase ROS generation. ACOX1 knockdown
  downregulates DJ-1, NRF2, and HO-1 expression. ROS generation increase and antioxidant
  response downregulation together result in ROS accumulation, which further leads
  to caspase-3 activation and cell death. Treatment of antioxidants, including NAC
  and α-LA, inhibits EV71 replication, scavenges ROS production, and protects neural
  cells from death.
