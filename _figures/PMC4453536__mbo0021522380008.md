caption: Overview of the regulation pathway from HBV infection to complement activation.
  HBx/HBV and several other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-cell
  lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as
  immune activators such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), can
  induce miR-146a expression by activating NF-κB signaling. miR-146a suppresses the
  expression of CFH, as well as multiple other genes, by binding to the 3' UTRs of
  its targets. Together with several other negative regulators of complement activation,
  CFH inhibits the formation of C3 convertase (C3bBb), thus inhibiting constitutive
  complement activation via the alternative pathway. HBx may also enhance the expression
  of CD59 and CD46, while HBc may inhibit CD59 expression. The HBx–miR-146a–CFH–complement
  activation pathway could play a central role in chronic HBV infection-related liver
  inflammation.
