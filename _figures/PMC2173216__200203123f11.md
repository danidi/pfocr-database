caption: Role of SPP-1 in biosynthesis and trafficking of sphingolipids and apoptosis.
  Scheme depicting the bioactive intermediates of sphingolipid biosynthesis. In brief,
  dihydroceramide and ceramide biosynthesis takes place at the cytosolic surface of
  the ER. In the membrane recycling/salvage pathway, sphingosine produced from sphingolipids
  in the lysosome is phosphorylated in the cytosol to S1P and dephosphorylated in
  the ER by SPP-1, where it is reutilized for synthesis of ceramide. Dihydroceramide
  and ceramide are transported to the cis-Golgi by vesicular transport, and nonvesicular
  transport to the TGN where they are converted to sphingomyelin and glucosylceramides.
  See text for more information.
