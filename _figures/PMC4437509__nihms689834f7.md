caption: The role of JNK MAPK in the circadian clock. The diagram presents the most
  representative tissues in mammals with regard to the function of JNK—the SCN, fibro-blasts,
  or liver, lung, and kidney. The oscillator in the center of the triangle represents
  the cellular oscillator in the respective tissues. The arrows that are drawn toward
  the oscillator represent a circadian input pathway. The lines that are drawn away
  from either the oscillator or the JNK MAPK represent output pathways. The labels
  indicate the functions of pathways or perturbations on the activity of JNK.
