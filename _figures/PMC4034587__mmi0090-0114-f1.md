caption: 'Schematic representation of acetate metabolism in procyclic trypanosomes
  grown in glucose-rich conditions. Black arrows indicate enzymatic steps of glucose,
  proline and threonine metabolism, dashed arrows symbolize steps supposed to occur
  at a background level or not at all, and double line arrows represent de novo sterol
  and fatty acid biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA. Excreted end-products of metabolism
  of glucose, proline and threonine are boxed. Indicated enzymes are: 1, threonine
  3-dehydrogenase (TDH); 2, 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase; 3, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase complex (PDH); 4, acetate:succinate CoA-transferase (ASCT); 5, acetyl-CoA
  thioesterase (ACH); 6, succinyl-CoA synthetase; 7, AMP-dependent acetyl-CoA synthetase
  (AceCS); 8, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; AOB, amino
  oxobutyrate; CIT, citrate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; KG, 2-ketoglutarate; MAL, malate; OA, oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PYR, pyruvate.'
