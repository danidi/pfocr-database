caption: Comparison of phospholipid (PL) synthesis and lipoprotein (LP) formation
  pathways between 0.16, 2.5 and 10 g salmon. Colored triangles indicate the significantly
  (q < 0.05) up (red) or down (green) regulation of the highest expressed genes found
  in each enzymatic step of the pathways. Asterix indicates genes only significantly
  (q < 0.05) changed between 0.16 g and 10 g. a PL de-novo synthesis, lyso-PL synthesis
  and PL turnover pathways in fish. Glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) is first acylated
  by acyltransferases to phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), which can be transferred into
  diacylglycerol (DAG) or CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) by phosphatidate phosphatase
  (plpp and lpin) or CDP-DAG synthetase (cds). DAG is utilized with CDP-choline (CDP-Cho)
  and CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) for synthesizing of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)
  and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). CDP-DAG is utilized for synthesizing of phosphatidylserine
  (PtdSer), phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and Cardiolipin.
  b LP formation pathway in enterocyte of fish. PtdCho is synthesized on the membrane
  of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through de-novo synthesis, turnover or lyso-PL pathway
  before used for pre-lipoprotein (Pre-LP) formation. Pre-LP is a nascent lipoprotein
  assembled by PtdCho, triacylglycerol (TAG), cholesterol (CH), apolipoprotein B (apob)
  and apolipoprotein AIV (apoa4). Pre-LP is then targeted to the Golgi apparatus via
  pre-lipoprotein transport vesicle (PLTV) generated by ER. The maturation of Pre-LP
  happens in Golgi, where apolipoprotein AI (apoa1) is added before secreting into
  circulatory system
