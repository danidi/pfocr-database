caption: 'Multiple transduction mechanisms induced at the FSHR. The Gαs/cAMP/protein
  kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway has classically been considered as the key signaling
  mechanism triggered at the FSHR. Over the last decade, mounting evidence have shown
  that FSHR also engages other transduction mechanisms mainly coupling to other Gα
  subunits, β-arrestin-dependent signaling, EGFR transactivation, and APPL1-mediated
  signals. Bibliographic references are indicated on the map by the first author’s
  name with two digits for the year of publication. The CellDesigner program has been
  used to represent signaling pathways as shown in Figures –7. Complexes are surrounded
  by a box. Dashed lines indicate indirect reactions. The following semantic has been
  used: proteins (); active protein (); receptor (); transcript (); gene (); catalysis
  (); association (); dissociation (); inhibition (); phosphorylation (); degradation
  (); known transition omitted (); unknown transition ().'
