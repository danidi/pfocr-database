caption: The networks were generated using IPA software and were from the direct comparisons
  of imig- vs. vela-treated data sets without normalization to WT. The pathway included
  DEGs with decreased expression (imig/vela, green symbols) and the DEGs with expression
  level-increased (imig/vela, red symbols). The gene symbols and their interactions
  are as indicated. (A) The cell division/proliferation network is composed from total
  42 DEGs determined by microarray (12 genes, red star) and mRNA-Seq (37 genes, blue
  star) which includs 7 common genes (blue and red stars) (see gene list in ). A general
  decrease in DEG expression levels was found in cell division/proliferation network
  from imig-treated vs. vela-treated spleen. (B) Hematopoietic system network was
  composed of total 54 DEGs determined by microarray (16 genes, red star) and mRNA-Seq
  (49 genes, blue star). Among them, 11 were common genes (red and blue stars) ().
  (C) Inflammatory response/macrophage network was composed of total 41 DEGs determined
  by microarray (5 genes, red star) and mRNA-Seq (40 genes blue star), of those 4
  were common genes (red and blue stars) ().
