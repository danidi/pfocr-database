caption: The binding of MSLN to MUC16 present on the pancreatic cancer cell surface
  activates a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway, which in turn upregulates MMP-7 synthesis,
  resulting in increased invasive and migratory potentials. In the absence of MUC16
  expression by pancreatic cancer cells, MSLN is capable of upregulating MMP-7 expression
  via activation of an ERK-dependent pathway.
