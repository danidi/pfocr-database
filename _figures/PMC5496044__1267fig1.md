caption: Schematic diagram of domain structure for LRP1 and LDLR. The large extracellular
  domain of LRP1 has four ligand binding domains (I–IV) with 2, 8, 10, and 11 cysteine-rich
  complement-type repeats, respectively, while that of LDLR has one ligand binding
  domain with seven such repeats. The extracellular domain of LRP1 is cleaved by furin,
  and attached with the C-terminal domain via a noncovalent association. Cysteine-rich
  EGF repeat and YWTD β-propeller domain in the extracellular portion facilitate dissociation
  of ligands within the endocytic pathway under acidic conditions. In the cytoplasmic
  tail, in addition to the two NPXY motifs, LRP1 has an YXXL motif adjacent to the
  second NPXY motif, enabling rapid endocytosis.
