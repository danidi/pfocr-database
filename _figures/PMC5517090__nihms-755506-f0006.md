caption: 'A schematic graphic model of the topotaxis in invasive and non-invasive
  cells. The directionality of topotactic migration depends on differential conformity
  of cellular membrane to local topographic structure. The degree of conformity depends
  on the cell rigidity, which in turn is controlled by the interplay between two ECM
  activated signaling pathways: PI3K-Akt increasing the degree of conformity and matrix
  penetration and ROCK-MLCK decreasing the degree of conformity. The balance between
  the activities of these pathways can be determined by the local ECM signaling input
  or genetic changes affecting these pathways, and can be modulated by pharmacological
  perturbations. The relatively higher activity of the PI3K-Akt pathway in the invasive
  melanoma cells (a) can lead to differential penetration of the matrix and lead to
  a higher matrix contact in the sparser vs. denser matrix zones, generating bias
  for migration from the denser to sparser matrix density. In the other hand, at high
  enough ECM signaling inputs, the relatively higher activity of the ROCK-MLCK pathway
  in noninvasive melanoma cells limits cell penetration into the matrix, leading to
  haptotactic migration up the density gradient (b).'
