caption: A model of how ECSIT may participate in Toll/IL-1 signaling. The major signaling
  pathways leading to NF-κB and AP-1 from TNF and IL-1/Toll receptors are indicated.
  The different proteins indicated do not form multiprotein complexes, probably reflecting
  the dynamic nature of the signaling pathways; for example, IRAK is rapidly degraded
  upon signaling. The order of the different proteins in the pathways has been deduced
  from a combination of experimental approaches, including use of dominant-negative
  mutants. It is important to note that this figure does not represent the totality
  of information available about these signaling pathways but is a selective depiction
  of the key molecules discussed in the paper.
