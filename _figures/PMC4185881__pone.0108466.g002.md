caption: The reduced BRN of TLR4 and JAK/STAT signalling pathway is derived from .
  Nodes represent entities, whereas interactions between them are shown as edges.
  Sign on the edges represent the type of interaction between nodes i.e. positive
  for activation (solid arrows) and negative for inhibition (dotted arrows). Integers
  “1” and “2” on the edges represent the threshold levels of entities (see  section).
