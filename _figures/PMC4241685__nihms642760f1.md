caption: 'Cytolytic activity of NDV in cancer cells proceeds through direct and indirect
  mechanisms. The direct mechanisms include formation of multinucleated syncytia,
  activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, activation of the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway, activation of ER stress pathway, and involvement of MAPK pathways. The
  indirect mechanisms include secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
  which recruit mediators of both innate and adaptive immune responses such as NK
  cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Anti-tumor immune responses are further facilitated
  by the enhanced adhesion of leukocytes through binding to the viral glycoproteins
  expressed on the surface of infected cells, by upregulation of MHC and cell adhesion
  molecules, which serve to activate tumor-specific lymphocytes, and by activation
  of macrophages. MHC: major histocompatibility complex, LFA-3: lymphocyte function-associated
  antigen-3, ICAM-1: intercellular adhesion molecule-1, IFNβ: interferon β, RANTES:
  regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted, IP-10: interferon
  gamma-induced protein-10, ADA: adenosine deaminase, iNOS: inducible nitric oxide
  synthase, TNFα: tumor necrosis factor α, TRAIL: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.'
