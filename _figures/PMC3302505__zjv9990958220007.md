caption: Inhibition of IFN induction by paramyxovirus V proteins. Paramyxovirus V
  proteins block both mda-5-dependent and RIG-I-dependent IFN induction. Replication
  potentially generates ligands for both mda-5 and RIG-I, and transcription of the
  PIV5 L gene has been shown to generate a ligand for mda-5 (). Inhibition of mda-5
  occurs through a direct interaction between V and mda-5 which prevents ligand binding
  and consequent activation of the signaling pathway leading to IRF-3 and NF-κB activation.
  V proteins inhibit RIG-I signaling by interacting with LGP2 and promoting the formation
  of an inhibitory complex between RIG-I and LGP2 which is refractory to activation
  by viral RNA.
