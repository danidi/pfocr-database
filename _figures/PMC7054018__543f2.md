caption: Signaling that promotes mesoderm invagination. (A) Pathway for Spätzle activation
  and Dorsal nuclear translocation. Spätzle is produced in an inactive proform and
  is cleaved by a serine protease (Easter) that is activated within the Pipe domain.
  Binding of cleaved Spätzle to Toll releases the inhibiting prodomain. Active Spätzle
  bound to its prodomain is free to diffuse. Prodomain is generated preferentially
  outside the Pipe domain leading to diffusive flux of Spätzle toward the ventral
  midline. (B) Genetic pathway for cytoskeletal activation in the Drosophila mesoderm.
  Domain organization of DRhoGEF2 protein is shown, see text for description.
