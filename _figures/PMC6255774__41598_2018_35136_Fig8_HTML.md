caption: A simplified diagram of fatty acid synthesis, modification and assembly into
  triacylglycerol in developing Arabidopsis seeds. The diagram illustrates the role
  of LPCAT in acyl partitioning between the cytosolic acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) and phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) pools used for microsomal elongation and desaturation. Major acyl groups made
  (or present) in the plastidial acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) and cytosolic acyl-CoA
  and PC pools are shown. 2:0 is acetic acid; 16:0 is palmitic acid, 18:0 is stearic
  acid, 18:1 is oleic acid, 20:0 is eicosanoic acid, 20:1 is eicosenoic acid, 18:2
  is linoleic acid and 18:3 is linolenic acid. DAG is diacylglycerol, TAG is triacylglycerol,
  LPCAT is acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase, FAE is fatty acid elongase,
  FAD is fatty acid desaturase, PDCT is PC:DAG cholinephosphotransferase, PDAT is
  phospholipid:DAG acyltransferase and DGAT is acyl-CoA:DAG acyltransferase. The dotted
  arrow represents the first three catalytic steps of the Kennedy pathway responsible
  for acyl-CoA dependent formation of DAG from glycerol-3-phosphate.
