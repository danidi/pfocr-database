caption: (A) In darkness, photoreceptor metabolism is similar to adult neurons. Glucose
  is catabolized through glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation,
  generating NAD+ and a large amount of ATP along with ROS. (B) In light, photoreceptor
  metabolism is similar to that of stem cells. Glucose undergoes glycolysis to form
  pyruvate, which is not further catabolized by the TCA cycle but is metabolized by
  the pentose phosphate pathway, generating several molecules of NADPH. NADPH is used
  for anabolic production of fatty acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and 11-cis retinal.
