caption: Biosynthesis of Rifamycin B. RifA is primed with AHBA, derived from amino-DHS
  by action of AHBA synthase (RifK). The loading module consists of an adenylation
  domain (A) for AHBA activation and a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP). Subsequently,
  ten cycles of C2-elongation are carried out by RifA-RifE. Each cycle plus reductive
  modifications is catalyzed by one module being comprised of a β-keto synthase domain
  (KS), an acyl transferase domain (AT), an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and optionally
  a keto reductase domain (KR) or a dehydratase domain (DH, inactive in module 1).
  Premature chain release after module 3 of RifA gives rise to the shunt product P8/1-OG
  (or the derived lactone 2). Macrolactamization of the fully assembled polyketide
  chain is catalyzed by amide synthetase RifF leading to proansamycin X, which undergoes
  post-PKS modifications finally yielding rifamycin B.
