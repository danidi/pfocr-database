caption: IDH1WT/IDH1MUT and IDH1MUT/IDH1WT ratios indicate contribution of a particular
  pathway as calculated on the basis of gene expression levels in IDH1WT and IDH1MUT,
  respectively. IDH1WT glioma catabolize glucose in the glycolysis with lactate as
  end product, whereas IDH1MUT glioma prefers production of pyruvate from lactate
  and use the TCA cycle to generate isocitrate. Glucose, lactate and glutamate replenish
  the TCA cycle in IDH1MUT glioma, to facilitate α-KG production for consumption by
  IDH1MUT to generate 2-HG, whereas acetate anaplerosis is important in IDH1WT glioma.
