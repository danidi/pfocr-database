caption: The beta2-adrenergic receptor and CD86 signaling pathways converge to induce
  an increase in the level of IgG1 produced by an activated B cell. The β2AR engagement
  on an activated B cell activates cAMP/PKA/ CREB, while CD86 engagement on an activated
  B cell activates lyn kinase, CD19, Akt, IkB, and NFkB. The signaling pathway activated
  by β2AR and CD86 engagement cause an increase in the co-activator protein OCA-B
  and the transcription factor Oct-2, respectively. OCA-B and Oct-2 interact and translocate
  to the nucleus and bind to the 3'IgH-enhancer to increase the rate of IgG1 transcription,
  which increases the level of IgG1 produced by the cell. The increase in IgG1 is
  not due to an increase in the number of naïve B cell switching to the production
  of IgG1.
