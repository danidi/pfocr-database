caption: Mitochondria-targeted Therapies. (A) Checkpoint Inhibitors. Mitochondrial
  activity is strongly affected by both immune checkpoints and metabolism checkpoints.
  Either alone or the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD1/PDL1
  and CTLA-4 inhibitors and metabolism checkpoint inhibitors such as bezafibrate (an
  agonist of PGC-1α/PPAR complexes) and agents target PI3K-AKT-mTOR-PGC1α pathway
  could enhance glycolysis and/or FAO, and proliferation in tumor-reactive T cells,
  or reduce glycolysis and proliferation in tumor cells. (B) OXPHOS inhibitors. Cancer
  cells with elevated OXPHOS metabolism was associated with increased hypoxia in tumor
  regions, which forms a barrier to T cell activity, increases T-cell exhaustion and
  decreases antitumor immunity. OXPHOS inhibitors that target the transport of electrons
  (complexes I, II, III, IV, and V) would alleviate antitumor resistance in process
  of antitumor treatment in those cancers. (C) CAR-T. The activity, survival, and
  persistence of a CAR-T cell are dictated by its transduced costimulatory domains.
  CAR-T cells with 4-1BB, IL17, and IL15 in the engineered vector evokes enhanced
  mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS, with central memory T cells and long-term effect,
  whereas inclusion of CD28 and IL2 signaling evoke decreased mitochondrial biogenesis,
  enhanced glycolysis and favor the establishment of effector memory T cells with
  a short-term effect. (D) Radiation Therapy. Irradiation led to increased amounts
  of mtDNA and mitochondrial biogenesis. It can also inhibit mitochondrial respiration.
  The primary mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, MnSOD, has been linked with radioresistance.
  Thus, suppression of MnSOD sensitized the cells to radiation-induced cell death.
  Mitochondrial dysfunction has key roles in oxidative stress via increased ROS production,
  which causes mitochondrial membrane depolarization and triggers intrinsic apoptosis
  pathways. Treatments that increase mitochondrial membrane depolarization have had
  pro-apoptotic effects. Mitochondrial permeability is regulated by permeability transition
  core complexes, which can be triggered by agents that increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations
  or stimulate ROS generation, resulting in cell death. Irradiation led to decreases
  in the activity of mitochondrial cell-membrane Na+-K+ and Ca2+/Mg2+ ATPase and ATP
  content, which in turn led to apoptosis via the intrinsic cell death pathway. Triggering
  of ROS generation can also promote sensitivity to radiation by stimulating the generation
  of ceramide, an important pro-apoptotic mediator that increases cytochrome c release
  and suppresses anti-apoptotic gene activity. OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  CAR-T, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA.
