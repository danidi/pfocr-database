caption: A. Good prognosis colorectal cancers. CYP51A1, CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP46A1,
  CYP39A1 and CYP8B1 expression profile is low. This results in a lower concentration
  of oxysterols. Low oxysterol levels have less impact on promoting tumour invasion,
  metastasis, tumour cell survival and growth leading to a better survival outcome.
  However, increased expression of CYP7B1 correlates with good prognosis and this
  has been observed in breast cancer and prostate cancer. B. Poor prognosis colorectal
  cancers. CYP51A1, CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP46A1, CYP39A1 and CYP8B1 expression is increased
  in comparison with good prognostic tumours. This results in a significant increase
  in oxysterols. Oxysterols promote invasion and metastasis through LRX target genes
  and facilitates tumour cell survival and growth through immune system evasion and
  chemo-attraction of proangiogenic neutrophils.
