caption: 'The role of YAP in tumour immunity: Transcription regulator YAP acts a crucial
  inhibitor in multiple immunological cells. The YAP activation in T cells regulates
  the differentiation and functions of Tregs and CD8+ T cells, which influences tumour
  progression further. The YAP activation in TAMs triggers the differentiation and
  functions of M2 phenotype. YAP expression in tumour cells recruit MDSCs and TAMs
  via releasing relevant cytokines include IL-6 and Cxcl5. TAMs, tumour-associated
  macrophages; MDSCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells.'
