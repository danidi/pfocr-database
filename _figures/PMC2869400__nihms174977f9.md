caption: A model of Gfi-1-mediated repression of CDKN1A and other Miz-1 target genes.
  (A) In the absence of TGFβ or if the TGFβ signaling pathway is defective, Gfi-1
  and Myc are expressed and recruited to CDKN1A and other Miz-1 target genes via Miz-1,
  leading to transcriptional repression and augmented cell growth. (B) TGFβ downregulates
  the expression of Gfi-1 and c-Myc. As a consequence, Miz-1 binds to CDKN1A and other
  Miz-1 target genes to activate their expression, causing reduced cell proliferation.
