caption: The ASHM Mechanism Can Prevent Hypersecreting Clone Expansion—at the Cost
  of Risk of Autoimmune DiseaseASHM T cells recognize antigens in the secretion pathway
  to selectively eliminate cells that secrete more than their neighbors. When overactivated,
  the same cells can set off a persistent immune response including B cell activation
  that kills much of the tissue, except for hyposecreting clones.
