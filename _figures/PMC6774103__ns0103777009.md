caption: Scheme of permeability pathways in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)
  and their relationship to metabolism. Components of the TCA cycle appear at thetop
  with emphasis on those substrates and reactions that generate NADH for complex I
  of the electron transport chain (ETC; in center of diagram of IMM). Components in
  the IMM are described from left to right. The various substrate transporters (STs)
  are responsible for substrate transport into the matrix. The Pi transporter uses
  the H+ gradient to provide Pi for ATP production. The F1F0ATPase uses the oxidatively
  produced H+ gradient to phosphorylate ADP. FCCP uncouples the ETC from oxidative
  phosphorylation by facilitating H+ influx. The ETC uses NADH in complex I and FADH2
  in complex II (SDH) to reduce O2 and extrude H+, establishing the mitochondrial
  electrochemical potential, Δp = ΔpH + Δψ. The adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT)
  exchanges ADP and ATP across the IMM. The high-conductance mitochondrial permeability
  transition (mPT) is permeable to molecules up to 1500 D. The low-conductance Ca2+-activated
  pathway (bold) described in this paper is permeable to H+ and maybe other ions.
  The Ca2+uniporter (Ca2+Uni) is the Ca2+ channel of the IMM. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
  (NCE) is a normal pathway for mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion that together with the
  uniporter can lead to Ca2+ cycling. The permeable outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM)
  contains large-conductance porin channels that may contribute to mPT formation at
  points of apposition between the IMM and OMM. Glu, Glutamate; Asp, aspartate; aKG,
  α-ketoglutarate; AAT, aspartate amino transferase;Fum, fumarate; Succ, succinate;SDH,
  succinate dehydrogenase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase.
