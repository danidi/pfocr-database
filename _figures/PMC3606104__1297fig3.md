caption: Identification of genetic networks that regulate the induction of filamentous
  growth. (A) The overexpression screen data set was analyzed for enrichment of pathways
  annotated in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Enriched pathways
  are shown (cell cycle sce04111, meiosis sce04113, and MAPK signaling sce04011) along
  with genes identified in the screen that are annotated as belonging to the respective
  pathway. (B) Network connectivity map was built for the MAPK signaling, meiosis,
  and cell cycle networks from interactions annotated in KEGG. In-house programs were
  used to parse the pathway maps into nodes and edges for visualization using Cytoscape.
  The numbered circles indicate a subset of the genes identified in the overexpression
  screen that belong to the respective networks. Blowups of central portions of the
  cell cycle, meiosis, and MAPK signaling networks are provided, with key network
  components indicated in larger circles. Components of a given pathway in the map
  are indicated with a dashed line to highlight the overlap between networks. Two
  key connections between the MAPK signaling modules and the cell cycle/meiosis networks
  involving the Kss1p and Hog1p signaling cascades are shown in blue within the inset
  box.
