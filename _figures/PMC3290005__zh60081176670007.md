caption: Model of E2 action on D2 receptor (D2R) signaling in the lactotroph. On diestrus
  II (left), the D2R is not coupled to the GIRK channel. Rising levels of circulating
  E2 (dashed line) during this time, however, result in a functional switch in DA
  signaling to include GIRK channel activation. This transduction pathway is complete
  by the morning of proestrus (right), when DA activates membrane hyperpolarization
  (ΔVM). The more negative membrane potential “primes” the lactotroph population by
  removing inactivation (illustrated as a ball-and-chain blocker) of voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels (VGCC). When DA levels delivered to the AP via the portal vessels
  (dashed-dotted line) drop on the afternoon of proestrus, the primed lactotrophs
  depolarize, initiating increased Ca2+ influx through VGCC to support PRL release
  and to contribute to the PRL surge (solid line). E2 does not induce this functional
  switch in signaling by acting on the D2R, but by significantly increasing the expression
  of GIRK channel subunits (solid arrow). E2 may also regulate expression of the G
  protein βγ subunit isoforms (dotted arrow, ?), which are known to directly bind
  to and activate the GIRK channel.
