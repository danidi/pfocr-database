caption: A selective Jak3 antagonist inhibits Janus kinase (Jak) activity, blocking
  early cytokine signalling and resultant signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) activation. The drug, CP-690 550, abrogates cytokine dependent gene regulation
  and subsequent lymphocyte activation. In this manner it blocks transplant rejection.
  STATs also have critical functions in mediating cytokine signalling and in principle,
  targeting STATs would also be useful to generate novel immunosuppressants.
