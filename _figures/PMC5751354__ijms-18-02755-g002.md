caption: Molecular changes driving the Warburg effect. The shift to aerobic glycolysis
  in tumor cells reflects multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. Downstream from an
  active RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase, PI3K, Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activates
  AKT, protein kinase B/Akt strain transforming, stimulating glycolysis by directly
  regulating glycolytic enzymes. It also activates mechanistic target of rapamycin,
  mTOR, a protein kinase altering metabolism in various ways, including enhancement
  of three key transcription factors; the avian Myelocytomatosis viral oncogene proto-oncogene
  homologue (MYC); Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
  (NF-κB); and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), to promote a hypoxia-adaptive
  metabolism. NF-κB subunits bind and activate the HIF-1α gene. HIF-1α increases expression
  of glucose transporters, GLUT, glycolytic enzymes and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase,
  PDK, that blocks pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, PDC driven entry of pyruvate into
  the tricarboxylic acid, TCA cycle. Transcription factor MYC cooperates with HIF-1α
  to activate several genes encoding glycolytic proteins, yet also stimulates mitochondrial
  biogenesis whilst inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, favoring substrates for
  macromolecular synthesis in dividing cells. Tumor suppressor p53 ordinarily opposes
  the glycolytic phenotype via Phosphatase and Tensin homolog, PTEN but loss of p53
  function (dashed line) is frequent in tumor cells. Octamer binding protein 1 (OCT1)
  activates transcription of genes that drive glycolysis and suppress oxidative phosphorylation.
  Change to the pyruvate kinase M2, PKM2 isoform affects glycolysis by slowing the
  pyruvate kinase reaction, diverting substrates into an alternative biosynthetic
  and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, (NADPH)-generating pentose
  phosphate pathway, PPP. Phosphoglycerate mutase, PGAM and α-enolase, ENO1 are commonly
  upregulated in cancer as is the pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme, PKM2 allowing a high
  rate of nucleic acid synthesis, especially in tumor cells. Lactate dehydrogenase,
  LDH enhances production of lactate, a signaling molecule that can stabilize HIF-1α
  and accumulate in the tumor microenvironment via Monocarboxylate Transporters, MCT,
  nourishing adjacent aerobic tumor cells that convert lactate to pyruvate for further
  metabolic processing. Solid black arrows, influenced targets; solid purple arrows,
  metabolite transition pathways; dotted purple arrows, reduced metabolite transition
  pathways; thin solid black arrow, coenzyme transition; dotted T-bar, inhibition.
