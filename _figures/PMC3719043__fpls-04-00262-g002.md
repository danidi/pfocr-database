  TMTT, 4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3(E),7(E),11-tridecatetraene. The lipoxygenase pathway
  starts with the dehydrogenation of linolenic and linoleic acids at C9 or C13 position
  by lipoxygenases forming 9-hydroperoxy and 13-hydroperoxy derivates of polyenic
  acids (; ). These compounds are further cleaved by hydroperoxide lyases into oxoacids
  and C6-aldehydes. These aldehydes can be converted into the corresponding alcohols
  by alcohol dehydrogenases (; ; ). Terpenoids originate from isopentenyl diphosphate
  (IDP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMDP), which are synthesized via two different
  pathways. The cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway starts with the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA
  (), while the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP pathway) starts with condensation of pyruvate and
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (; ). The route in plastids provides precursors for the
  biosynthesis of isoprene, mono-, and diterpenes, while the cytosol-localized pathway
  for sesqui- and triterpenes. Precursors of terpenes have been experimentally demonstrated
  to be transported from plastids to the cytosol (; ), referred to as the “cross-talk”
  between the MEP- and MVA-pathways (for recent reviews on terpenoid synthesis see
  ; ; ). Aromatic volatiles are formed via the shikimic acid pathway, starting by
  condensation of erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP. After numerous steps via 3-dehydroshikimic
  acid and chorismate, phenylalanine (Phe) is produced. Phe is further converted to
  trans-cinnamic acid by phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Trans-cinnamic acid is a starting
  point for the synthesis of phenylpropanoids, (e.g., phenylethanol, phenylethylbenzoate)
  and benzenoids (benzaldehyde, methyl benzoate, methyl salicylate etc.; ; ). Additionally,
  tryptophan (Trp), which is the precursor of volatile indole, is biosynthesized via
  shikimic acid pathway () in chloroplast, while indole itself is synthesized in cytosol
  ().'
