caption: Simplified CoA and ergosterol biosynthesis pathways in yeast. Shown is a
  schematic representation of key intermediates in the metabolic pathways for CoA
  and ergosterol biosynthesis in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The CoA biosynthesis and
  ergosterol biosynthesis pathways are each boxed to demonstrate their separate treatment
  and lack of link in the current literature. The red arrow represents our novel conclusions,
  demonstrating the regulation that the CoA biosynthesis pathway exerts over the ergosterol
  biosynthesis pathway. Solid arrows represent single enzymatic steps between intermediates.
  Dashed arrows indicate multiple steps between intermediates. Further detailed enzymatic
  steps involved in these processes are shown in .
