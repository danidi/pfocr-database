caption: 'Binding of selective agonists to the IPR or βAR results in activation of
  Gs and, subsequently, AC leading to increases in cAMP. In the IPR pathway, increases
  in cAMP are regulated by PDE3 while in the βAR pathway, cAMP is hydrolysed by PDEs
  2 and 4. In both pathways increases in cAMP activate PKA and, subsequently, CFTR.
  The final conduit for ATP release in the IPR signalling pathway is VDAC while the
  distinct channel responsible for ATP release in the βAR signalling pathway remains
  to be determined. Abbreviations: β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; IPR, prostacyclin
  receptor; Gs, heterotrimeric G protein; PDE3A, phosphodiesterase 3A; PDE2, phosphodiesterase
  2; PDE4, phosphodiesterase 4; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; AMP, adenosine
  monophosphate; AC, adenylyl cyclase; PKA, protein kinase A; CFTR, cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane conductance regulator; VDAC, voltage dependent anion channel; ATP,
  adenosine triphosphate; (+), activation; (−), inhibition. Both phosphodiesterase
  5 (PDE5) () and exchange proteins activated by cAMP (EPACs) () are present in erythrocytes
  and their interaction with the IPR and βAR signalling pathways is under investigation.'
