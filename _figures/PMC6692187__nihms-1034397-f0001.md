caption: IRE1α structure, activation and potential roles in cancer. IRE1α is an ER
  transmembrane protein containing both protein kinase and RNase domains on its cytoplasmic
  side. Schematic of IRE1α activation in response to the accumulation of unfolded
  proteins in the ER by dimerization and trans/autophosphorylation (left). Signaling
  from IRE1α includes activation of the JNK pathway, splicing of the mRNA for XBP1
  and targeted degradation of specific RNA in a process called regulated IRE1-dependent
  decay or RIDD. Schematic of IRE1α domain structure and the location of specific
  mutations that are found in human cancers and described in the manuscript text (right,
  not to scale). ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IRE1α, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α; JNK,
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase; mRNA, messenger RNA; RIDD, regulated IRE1-dependent decay;
  XPB1, X-Box Binding Protein 1 [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
