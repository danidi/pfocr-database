caption: Pathway differential analysis. In sample 1, the mapped enzymes (filled rectangles)
  form a sub-graph with density = 1.475, the number of 0 in/out degree = 0.11 and
  p-value = 0.5. In Sample 2, the mapped enzymes (filled rectangles) form a sub-graph
  with density = 1.375, the number of 0 in/out degree = 0.22 and p-value =.74. Based
  on these p-value, we say that this pathways is differentially significant
