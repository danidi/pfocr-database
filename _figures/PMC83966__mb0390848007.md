caption: Ras effector pathways in NGF stimulated PC12 cells. Constitutive activation
  of Raf or PI3 kinase promotes cell cycle arrest and differentiation of PC12 cells
  into a neuronal phenotype. In contrast, constitutive activation of Ral-GEF promotes
  proliferation and blocks differentiation upon NGF stimulation. Of the two signaling
  molecules thought to be influenced by Ral-GEF, PLD and RalBP1, the latter appears
  to play a more important role in influencing neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. NGF
  activates Ras and all three known Ras effector pathways. Ras and the Raf pathway
  are activated for hours, and this chronic activation is required for NGF-induced
  neurite outgrowth. In contrast, the Ral-GEF pathway (as assessed by the content
  of GTP-Ral) is activated by NGF for only ∼20 min. Thus, Ral-GEF signaling may function
  to delay the onset of cell cycle arrest and neurite outgrowth upon NGF stimulation.
  Dissociation of the Ral-GEF pathway from Ras activation may be necessary to allow
  NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells to occur.
