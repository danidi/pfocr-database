caption: Co-regulation of hepatic wound healing and regenerative responses via TWEAK-
  and LTβ-mediated cellular cross-talk. In chronic liver injury liver progenitor cell
  (LPC) proliferation is induced via macrophage/natural killer (NK) cell-produced
  TWEAK activation of the NFκB pathway. Interaction between LPCs and activated hepatic
  stellate cells (HSCs)/myofibroblasts via Notch pathway and other potential mediators
  may drive LPC differentiation to cholangiocytes. LPCs and ductular reaction cells
  produce chemokines, such as CCL2 (red) and CX3CL1 (orange), which promote chemotaxis
  of inflammatory/myofibroblastic cells. Interactions between lymphotoxin-β (LTβ)
  expressed on LPCs and the LTβ receptor (LTβR) on activated HSCs triggers NFκB-driven
  expression of chemotaxis-associated factors ICAM-1 (blue) and RANTES (green) by
  HSCs, which may play a role in mediating recruitment of LPCs, HSCs, and leukocytes
  for wound healing, fibrogenesis and regeneration during chronic liver injury (,
  –).
