caption: HIF-mediated suppression of ROS. Hypoxia stimulates ROS production, which
  can damage macromolecules such as proteins, lipids and DNA. HIF signalling upregulates
  synthesis of the antioxidant tripeptide glutathione by multiple means. HIF upregulates
  expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, GCLM, as
  well as proteins which increase the cellular levels of the three constituent amino
  acids of glutathione. Cysteine import is increased by upregulation of SLC7A11, while
  glutamate synthesis is increased by upregulation of GLS1. Glycine synthesis is increased
  by increased serine metabolism, first by its synthesis from glycolysis-derived 3-PG,
  via HIF-dependent upregulation of PHGDH, and second through its conversion to glycine
  via upregulation of the folate cycle enzyme SHMT2. The folate cycle also produces
  NADPH, which is utilised by GR to recycle glutathione disulphide (GSSG) to the ROS
  scavenging GSH. HIF signalling also upregulates the expression of SOD2, a mitochondrial
  enzyme capable of converting the superoxide free radical to H2O2. Subunit switching
  is another way the HIF pathway reduces ROS production is also reduced by HIF-mediated
  subunit switching of the ETC complexes. The HIFs upregulate expression of an alternative
  subunit of CI (I), NDUFAL2 which produces less ROS than isoform 1. Similarly, HIFs
  upregulate an alternative subunit of CIV (IV), COX4-2 which produces less ROS, as
  well as LON, which degrades isoform 2 (COX4-1)
