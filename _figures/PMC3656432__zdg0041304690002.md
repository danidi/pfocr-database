caption: 'A: model for a calcineurin-dependent pathway linking specific patterns of
  motor nerve activity to distinct programs of gene expression that establish phenotypic
  differences between slow and fast myofibers. MEF2 is shown to represent the requirement
  for collaboration between activated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) proteins
  and muscle-restricted transcription factors in slow fiber-specific gene transcription,
  but other proteins (not shown) also are likely to participate. [Ca2+]i, intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration; CnA, catalytic calcineurin subunit. [Reproduced, with permission,
  from Ref. .] B: summary of the roles of the IGF-I/Akt pathway and forkhead box O
  (FOXO) in muscle atrophy (right) and hypertrophy (left). The schematics indicate
  that a decrease in Akt phosphorylation elicits increased binding of FOXO1 to nuclear
  DNA, which results in increased transcription of atrogin-1 and muscle-specific RING
  finger protein 1 (i.e., ubiquitin ligases), thereby increasing protein degradation.
  Additionally, a decrease in the phosphorylation level of Akt is associated with
  a decrease in protein synthesis due to dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase
  (GSK)-3, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and S6 kinase (S6K). PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase. Factors and pathways in bold are activated. [Reproduced, with permission,
