caption: A proposed model explaining the function of OsASR5 in the regulation of stomatal
  status and drought stress tolerance. Under drought stress, the expression of OsASR5
  was up‐regulated,resulting in up‐regulation of ABA biosynthesis and responsive genes,such
  as OsNCED4 and OsNCED5,RAB16A and RAB16C, leading to ABA accumulation and increased
  sensitivity to exogenous ABA. Up‐regulation of OsASR5 also affected the activity
  of H2O2‐scavenging enzyme, APX, and suppressed DST and its downstream gene, peroxidase
  24 precursor, leading to H2O2 accumulation. ABA and H2O2 accumulation promotes stomatal
  closure, resulting in increased water content and finally enhancing drought tolerance.
  Furthermore, OsASR5 functioned as molecular chaperone and interacted with HSP40
  and 2OG‐Fe (II) oxygenase family protein, may prevent those drought stress‐related
  proteins from inactivation under drought stress conditions. However, the function
  of those interacted proteins for drought stress tolerance remains to be elucidated
  in future studies.
