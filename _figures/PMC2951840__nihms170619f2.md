caption: Lower branch. Inductive signaling along the dorsoventral axis of the neural
  tube involves the graded actions of sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt proteins (not shown)
  secreted by the floor plate and adjacent ventral cells, and the patterned expression
  of homeodomain (HD) proteins by ventral progenitor cells and post-mitotic neurons.
  This dorso-ventral patterning pathway recruits expression of the LIM homeodomain
  proteins Lhx3 and Lhx4 by newly generated motor neurons, assigning a median motor
  column (MMC) – like identity. In primitive ancestral vertebrates such as the lamprey
  and hagfish the dominance of this inductive pathway confers all motor neurons with
  a MMC fate, providing the neural substrate for undulatory locomotor behaviors.Upper
  branch. Over the course of ∼500 million years of evolution, rostro-caudal inductive
  signals mediated by retinoids (RA) and fibroblast growth factors (FGF) establish
  the patterned expression of Hox homeodomain proteins in motor neuron progenitors
  and post-mitotic motor neurons. The engagement of Hox transcription factors, and
  an essential Hox accessory factor, FoxP1, drives motor neuron columnar and pool
  diversification, resulting in the formation of lateral motor column (LMC) neurons
  and their resident motor pools. This diversification process permits the spinal
  motor system to innervate the more complex set of peripheral motor targets that
  characterizes higher vertebrates and underlies intricate tetrapod gait patterns.The
  key intermediate step in this diversification process is presumed to involve the
  attenuation of non-canonical Wnt signaling, permitting the generation of motor neurons
  that lack Lhx3 and Lhx4 expression and progress to a hypaxial motor columnar (HMC)
  fate (not shown). This ground-state HMC-like column provides the neuronal substrate
  for the actions of the Hox/FoxP1 transcriptional program. For details, see text
