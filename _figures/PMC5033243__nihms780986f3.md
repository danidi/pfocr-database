caption: A simple model of the response and progression of a tumor treated with a
  therapeutic targeting the initial driving oncogenic pathway. Inhibitor A blocks
  Oncogene A (Onc-A), which attenuates signaling to multiple downstream effectors,
  including mTORC1. If the Onc-A pathway is the primary, non-redundant route to mTORC1,
  a robust anti-tumor response will be observed. Acquired resistance can develop due
  to bypass activation of a parallel pathway through Oncogene-B (Onc-B) resulting
  in sustained mTORC1 signaling in the presence of Inhibitor-A. This resistance can
  be overcome through combination therapy with an mTOR inhibitor in settings of both
  innate (i.e. initial non-responsive) and acquired resistance.
