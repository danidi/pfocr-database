caption: Targeting GSK3β results in neuroprotection from IR-induced neurotoxicity.
  Model depicting potential targeting of GSK3β-NHEJ signaling pathway to decrease
  neurotoxicity and increase the therapeutic index of anti-glioma treatment. Inhibition
  of GSK3β results in the upregulation of DNA-PK dependent NHEJ repair in neural but
  not tumor cells. By targeting GSK3β, neurons, but not GBM cells, gain enhanced DNA
  repair functionality, and therefore protected from IR-induced neuronal cell death.
