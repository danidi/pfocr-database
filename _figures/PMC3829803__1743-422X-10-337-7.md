caption: Retinoid action during paramyxovirus infection. (A) 1) Jak/STAT signaling
  is inhibited as a result of viral infection and ATRA treatment is unable to effectively
  promote unregulation of ISGs and type I IFN production. 2) Cells exposed to the
  products of the primary infection and primed with ATRA can more efficiently secrete
  type I IFN upon infection. (B) 3) Exposure to ATRA and type I IFN in the supernatant
  signals through the Jak/STAT pathway with the combination of nuclear localization
  of STAT1/2 heterodimer and activation of the RAR/RXR complex results in the transcription
  of multiple ISGs, importantly IRF1. For simplicity, only IFNα and its receptor IFNAR1/2
  are shown to promote Jak/STAT signaling. 4) RIG-I expression is greatly up-regulated
  under these conditions, by IRF1 binding to the interferon response element (IRE)
  on its promoter. 5) Increased cytoplasmic quantities of RIG-I provide protection
  in the bystander cell upon virus infection. RIG-I detects viral RNA and associates
  with the adaptor protein MAVS, which initiates downstream activation of NFκB and
  IRF3/7. Nuclear translocation to their respective promoter elements induces transcription
  of antiviral genes, i.e., type I IFN and IRF1/7 production. It is not clear what
  role the second cytoplasmic RNA helicase (mda5) plays in this cascade although mda5
  has been implicated in responses to several Paramyxoviridae. 6) These proteins feedback
  onto their respective pathways and promote RIG-I expression, further improving the
  antiviral state of the cell. 7) Increased production of type I IFN from the retinoid-primed
  bystander cell provides both an autocrine and paracrine signal to further protect
  the uninfected cells in culture.
