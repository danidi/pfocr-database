caption: UVB acts at both the switch and the switched pathway to trigger UV-induced
  apoptosis. DNA photoproducts trigger phosphorylation of P53 and Mdm2, thereby reducing
  P53 degradation. In many systems, the elevated P53 triggers apoptosis by transcriptionally
  activating Bax, Bak, Puma, PIGs, and Noxa, as well as acting directly at mitochondria.
  For UVB-induced apoptosis, however, a larger signal proceeds through a pathway in
  which UV-induced P53 inactivates E2f1, as described in the text. Graded doses of
  UV cause the P53–E2f1 regulatory apparatus to transition from a fully OFF p53−/−-like
  state to a fully ON E2f1−/−-like state. The apoptosis-inhibitory activity of E2f1
  acts through Bcl-2, which suppresses the information flow in a direct pathway that
  is triggered by UV even when the P53–E2f1 regulatory apparatus is removed. P53 disinhibits
  this pathway. Two secondary signaling pathways (dotted lines) are appreciable when
  basal Bcl-2 is low, as described in the text.
