caption: (A) Diagram depicting the hypothesized interactions between activating NKG2D
  and inhibitory Ly49 pathways. Binding of H60 with NKG2D receptor leads to phosphorylation
  of DAP10 or DAP12, resulting in recruitment of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) belonging
  to the SFK family. The subsequent activation of PTKs results in the phosphorylation
  of downstream signaling proteins, eventually leading to nuclear translocation of
  NF-κB. Phosphorylation of ITIM sequences at the cytoplasmic domain of Ly49 molecules
  recruits and activates phosphatases, which in turn dephosphorylate substrates that
  are part of the NKG2D activation pathway. This results in the impaired translocation
  of NF-κB into the nuclei. (B) Gel-shift analysis was performed using nuclear extracts
  from fresh NK cells incubated with indicated target cells at a 40:1 E / T ratio
  for 2 hours at 37°C. Supershift analysis was performed on nuclear extracts from
  NK cells incubated with ST63 in the presence of 32P-labelled oligonucleotide and
  a mAb specific for NF-κB subunit, p50. Data presented are representative of 2 independent
  experiments.
