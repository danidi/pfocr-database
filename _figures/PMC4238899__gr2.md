caption: Schematic of the Notch signalling pathway. In brief, activation of the Notch
  membrane receptor requires binding by a member of the membrane-bound ligand Delta
  family (primarily Delta-like, Dll 1 and 4 and Jag 1 in the crypt) []. Binding of
  ligand to the receptor leads to release of the Notch intracellular domain (ICD)
  by protein cleavage. NICD translocates to the nucleus and associates with the CSL
  complex (CBF-1/RBP-J, Su(H), Lag1), displacing transcriptional repressors. This
  complex now associates with transcriptional co-regulators of the MAML family, resulting
  in upregulation of multiple downstream targets including Hes (Hairy/Enhancer of
  Split) proteins. Notch signalling via Hes proteins act to potentiate stem cell maintenance
  and inhibit secretory via regulation of bHLH transcription factors. For many more
  details see [].
