caption: During survival such as in the presence of growth factors, growth factor
  stimulation of cognate receptors results in the activation of PI3-K, and the subsequent
  recruitment and activation of the Serine/Threonine kinase Akt through phosphorylation
  at Threonine 308 and Serine 473. Activated Akt phosphorylates FOXO3a at Threonine
  32, Serine 253, and Serine 315, thereby resulting in the exclusion of FOXO3a from
  the nucleus and its inability to target the expression of genes that antagonize
  cell survival. On the contrary, in the absence of growth factors, FOXO3a is uninhibited
  by Akt, and is therefore not phosphorylated, and in the nucleus. See text for details.
