caption: (A) In studies using social defeat stress in mice (applied over 10 days),
  an increase in the firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons was observed, but only in
  the “susceptible” group (those animals that developed anhedonic-like behaviors following
  stress) [–]. Chronic mild stress (4–7 weeks) decreased the number of spontaneously
  active VTA dopamine neurons [,,]. (B) Some work suggests that increased mPFC excitability
  could suppress activity in the mesolimbic pathway [,]. (C) Endogenous CRF release
  in VTA seems to mediate the effect of restraint stress on motivation to work for
  food reward, likely by decreasing phasic dopamine responses to reward []. (D) GLP-1
  signaling appears to mediate the hypophagic effects of restraint stress [], likely
  by decreasing the rewarding value of food []. GLP-1 neurons in cNST project directly
  to VTA and NAc [], where they appear to influence dopaminergic functioning, although
  the direction of the effect is unclear [–]. More research is needed to assess whether
  GLP-1 neurons (and other homeostatic energy systems) contribute to stress-induced
  anhedonia. (E) Inflammation may inhibit dopamine availability [], either by inhibiting
  the function of enzymes in the dopamine biosynthetic pathway (see []) or by creating
  oxidative stress through increased kynurenine []. BST, bed nucleus of the stria
  terminalis; cNST, caudate nucleus of the solitary tract; CRF, corticotropin-releasing
  factor; DA, dopamine; GLP-1, glucagonlike peptide-1; mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex;
  MSN, medium spiny neuron; NAc, nucleus accumbens; PVN, hypothalamic paraventricular
  nucleus; VTA, ventral tegmental area.
