caption: The 5' end of all RNA polymerase II transcripts is modified with a 7mGpppN
  cap. The required enzymes of the synthesis pathway are depicted in green. Either
  the fully formed cap or its precursors can be removed by various decapping enzymes
  (red). Alternatively, after the bulk of the transcript is degraded by an exonuclease,
  the residual 7mGpppN cap structure can be degraded by the scavenging decapping enzyme
  (DcpS). For comparison, the bacterial RNA pyrophosphatase RppH (blue) is included.
