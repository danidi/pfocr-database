caption: Propagation of Tau mediated by microglia. Tau is a microtubule-associated
  protein, stabilizes microtubule, and supports cargo transport. On abnormal hyperphosphorylation,
  Tau protein detaches from the microtubule and aggregates in the form of oligomers
  to further accumulate in the form of neurofibrillary tangles inside the neuron.
  The aggregated Tau protein, especially oligomers, has the tendency to spread within
  the neuron and cause template-dependent misfolding of normal Tau protein which is
  called seeding effect of Tau. One of the mechanisms for the spreading of Tau is
  exosome-mediated spreading. Exosomes are further taken up by microglia, which can
  either undergo degradation pathway or can be re-released in the brain environment
  enhancing Tau propagation. Due to the presence of aggregated Tau protein, microglia
  become activated and influence the inflammatory response through cytokine secretion
  (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α). The inflammatory cytokines enhance Tau pathology by reciprocating
  enhancement of expression of phosphorylation-dependent kinases CDK5 and GSK-3β in
  neuron increasing Tau hyperphosphorylation. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids repress
  the inflammatory response by enhancing the synthesis of lipid mediator’s resolvins
  and protectins by microglia. We hypothesize that the lipid mediators can resolve
  the inflammatory phase and hence can reduce Tau pathology by decreasing expression
  of Tau phosphorylating kinases
