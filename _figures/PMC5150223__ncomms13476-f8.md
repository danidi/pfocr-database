caption: 'Left: at the plasma membrane, the IFNAR complex, assembled by type-I IFNs
  binding to IFNAR2 and to IFNAR1, is internalized by clathrin-dependent endocytosis,
  which triggers activation of the JAK kinases and STAT1 phosphorylation (pSTAT1).
  Middle: the VPS26-29-35 cargo recognition retromer complex is recruited via Rab7
  to the early endosome and controls the timely separation of IFNAR1–IFNAR2 subunits
  that is required for JAK/STAT signalling termination. Right: inhibiting retromer
  activity results in prolonged IFNAR1-IFNAR2 association at the early endosome, perturbed
  IFNAR trafficking and abnormally prolonged activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and
  gene transcription.'
