caption: NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation.Signal 1 (priming, left) is mediated
  by the engagement of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, which detects
  structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes and leads to NF-κB-mediated
  up-regulation of intracellular level of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Signal 2
  (activation; right) is provided by a wide range of pathogens-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as pore forming
  toxins, particulate matters and ATP, that converge to K+ efflux, Ca2+ influx, lysosomal
  disruption and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production. The assembly
  of NLRP3 inflammasome requires NEK7 and culminates in the activation of caspase-1,
  which in turn converts pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms. Caspase-1
  also cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), whose active N-terminal fragment inserts and forms
  pores in the plasma membrane, inducing pyroptosis as well as releasing IL-1β and
  IL-18 to the extracellular milieu.
