caption: 'Two classical signalling pathways control inducible immune responses to
  bacteria and fungi in D. melanogaster: the Toll pathway and the immune deficiency
  (Imd) pathway. The Toll pathway is active in the fat body and, together with the
  Imd pathway, controls the systemic production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
  The Imd pathway is also active in barrier epithelial surfaces including the gut,
  and functions in antimicrobial responses together with reactive oxygen species (ROS)‑generating
  enzymes, such as dual oxidase (Duox). These pathways are activated in response to
  the detection of microbial cell wall components. Peptidoglycan recognition protein
  LC (PGRP‑LC) and PGRP‑LE recognize the diaminopimelic acid (DAP)‑type peptidoglycan
  from Gram‑negative bacteria and certain Gram‑positive bacteria, and activate the
  Imd pathway. PGRP‑SA and Gram‑negative bacteria‑binding protein 1 (GNBP1) recognize
  the lysine‑type peptidoglycan of Gram‑positive bacteria, and GNBP3 recognizes the
  β‑glucans of yeasts and fungi to activate Toll signalling. In addition, the Toll
  pathway can be activated through the sensing of danger signals — including microbial
  proteases — or abnormal cell death, triggering the maturation of the protease Persephone.
  In all variations of the Toll pathway, immune recognition activates a proteolytic
  cascade that culminates in the maturation of the cytokine Spätzle, which is mediated
  by the protease Spätzle‑processing enzyme (SPE). Toll activation ultimately leads
  to the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) transcription factor
  Dif, to induce the expression of AMP genes such as Drosomycin, as well as other
  target genes. Activation of the Imd pathway leads to the nuclear translocation of
  the NF‑κB transcription factor Relish to activate the expression of AMP genes such
  as Diptericin. ROS also have important roles in antimicrobial defence and Duox activity
  is triggered by the recognition of uracil, which is a pathogen‑derived small molecule
  that activates an unidentified G protein‑coupled receptor (GPCR) and promotes the
  release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, both the Imd
  pathway and GPCR signalling, through a phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)‑dependent pathway,
  lead to the activation of a Mekk1–p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)
  axis that promotes the sustained expression of Duox upon infection. Atf2, activating
  transcription factor 2; Dredd, death‑related ced‑3/Nedd2‑ like caspase; Fadd, FAS‑associated
  death domain orthologue; Gαq, G protein αq‑subunit; IKK, inhibitor of NF‑κB kinase
  (also known as Ird5); MKK3, MAPK kinase 3 (also known as Licorne); modSP, modular
  serine protease; Tak1, TGFβ‑activated kinase 1.'
