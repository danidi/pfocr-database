caption: 'Signalling pathways that were altered in the high serum [P] group. The Ingenuity
  Pathway software was used to identify the functional pathways associated with genes
  that were differentially expressed between the prereceptive and receptive endometrial
  stages in the high [P] group. The majority of genes related to mitotic entry (a)
  and cell cycle (b) were downregulated. In this network, edge types are indicatives:
  a plain line indicates direct interactions, a dashed line indicates indirect interactions,
  a line without arrowhead indicates binding only, a line finishing with a vertical
  line indicates inhibition, and a line with an arrowhead indicates “acts on”. Green,
  downregulated; red, upregulated.'
