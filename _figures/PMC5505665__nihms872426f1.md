caption: A Activation of immune cells results in substantial remodeling of epigenetic
  landscapes. Genes associated with the naive state are repressed and effector genes
  become active through deposition of repressive marks (i.e. H3K9me3 and H3K27me3)
  and activating marks at promoters and enhancers (i.e. H3K27ac and H3K4me1). Diversity
  in epigenetic landscapes correlates with diversity in responses and plays a role
  in specifying differentiation. B Classical activation of macrophages elicits increased
  glycolytic metabolism and reduced reliance on mitochondrial respiration. These gross
  alterations in metabolic pathway usage underlie specific changes in the abundance
  of several metabolites. In particular, increased glycolytic metabolism drives production
  of lactate and supports a pool of acetyl-CoA by slowing the TCA cycle resulting
  in a buildup of citrate that can be converted to acetyl-CoA as well. Reduced flux
  through the TCA cycle, also reduces the production of 2-oxoglutarate and increases
  the production of itaconate. Alternatively, TLR stimulation of macrophages along
  with IL-4 reduces glycolytic metabolism and drives increased mitochondrial respiration
  and oxidative phosphorylation. C TCR and co-receptor stimulation of Th1, Th2, Th17,
  Tr1, and CD8+ T cells drives a general increase in both glycolytic metabolism and
  mitochondrial metabolism as measured by extracellular flux analysis. Glucose transport
  is increased substantially to facilitate glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial
  mass increases as well. Tregs on the other hand do not exhibit as dramatic an increase
  in glucose uptake and glycolytic metabolism, but increase reliance on oxidative
  phosphorylation and FAO. Biosynthetic pathways are engaged to fuel proliferation,
  in particular serine-driven folate metabolism, a branch of one-carbon metabolism,
  that promotes nucleotide synthesis. Extensive characterization of metabolic changes
  that occur during memory CD8+ T cell differentiation show that in general memory
  CD8+ T cells exhibit reduced metabolic activity, glycolytic and mitochondrial, with
  metabolic heterogeneity exhibited within the memory pool. Tcm maintain high mitochondrial
  mass, substantially increased SRC fueled by increased FAO. Tem maintain lower levels
  of SRC and can be supported by high levels of glycolytic metabolism. Examination
  of Trm metabolism show that skin Trm uniquely rely on high levels of fatty acid
  import to fuel FAO and SRC.
