caption: Biosynthesis of Sec and de novo synthesis of Cys. The complete synthesis
  of Sec on its tRNA in eukaryotes and archaea wherein selenite and ATP are substrates
  for SPS2 yielding selenophosphate that interacts with SecS, and the intermediate,
  likely dehydroalanine, to generate Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec is shown on the right in the
  upper pathway. In the lower pathway, the de novo synthesis of Cys is shown in mammals
  wherein sulfide and ATP are substrates for SPS2 yielding thiophosphate that interacts
  with SecS, and the intermediate, likely dehydroalanine, to yield Cys-tRNA[Ser]Sec.
