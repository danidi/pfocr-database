caption: 'Extinction of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6 metabolic pathway visualization in differentiated
  HepaRG cells using molecular networking. Differentiated HepaRG were incubated with
  quetiapine (13 µM) during H24 with or without cytochrome inhibitors. Ketoconazole
  (10 µM) is used as a CYP3A4 inhibitor and quinidine (10 µM) is used as a CYP2D6
  inhibitor. Each experimental condition is depicted in a specific color: quetiapine
  in orange, quetiapine + quinidine in red and quetiapine + ketoconazole in grey.
  Nodes are labelled with the exact protonated mass (m/z), chemical structures and
  retention times (RT in minutes) and the links are labelled with the exact mass shift.'
