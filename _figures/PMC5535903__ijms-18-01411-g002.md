caption: The nucleolar response to DNA damage. (a) DSBs in the rDNA cause nucleolar
  segregation and nucleolar cap formation. While DSBs outside the nucleolus result
  in a global nuclear response, DNA damage inside the nucleolus elicits only a localized
  response. DNA damage kinases, ATM and DNA-PK, inhibit RNA Pol I to cease transcription
  and subsequent rRNA processing and ribosomal assembly. Ribosomal proteins and possibly
  nucleolar proteins activate the P53 pathway. Damaged DNA is predominantly repaired
  by NHEJ, while HR, when activated, contributes to rDNA instability. (b) DSBs outside
  the nucleolus also induce nucleolar segregation and cap formation. RNA Pol I is
  inhibited by ATM and DNA-PK kinases while nucleolar proteins translocate to the
  damaged site in the nucleoplasm to participate in DNA repair as well as to the cytoplasm
  to activate the stress response.
