caption: Proposed model of how MUC1 promotes the progression and tumorigenesis of
  HCC and the targeted therapies in preclinical and clinical trials. MUC1 mediates
  autocrine TGF‐β signaling by activating the JNK/AP‐1 pathway in HCC cells. In addition,
  on the one hand, HCC cells affected by MUC1 undergo transition from the tumor suppressive
  TβRI/pSmad3C/p21WAF1pathway to the oncogenic JNK/pSmad3L/c‐Myc pathway; on the other
  hand, MUC1‐mediated activation of JNK enhances autocrine TGF‐β via AP‐1, further
  leading to the phosphorylation of Smad2C. In addition, MUC1‐mediated activation
  of JNK directly phosphorylates Smad2L, and then the phosphorylated Smad2L and Smad2C
  promote MMP‐9‐mediated cell migration and invasion of HCC cells. These findings
  indicate MUC1, JNK and TGF‐β as attractive targets for HCC therapy. To date, various
  strategies for targeting MUC1 (monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and aptamers), JNK
  (ATP‐competitive and ATP‐non‐competitive inhibitors), and TGF‐β (inhibitors target
  TGF‐β1/2 or TβRI/II) have been studied in preclinical and clinical trials.
