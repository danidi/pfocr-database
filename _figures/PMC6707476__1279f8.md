caption: 'A scheme based on our results: (A) Based on the recent findings, the MZ
  of the late larval lymph gland consists of two distinct domains. While one domain
  (cayenne) is sensitive to Hh signals received from the PSC/niche, the other domain
  (cyan), which is juxtaposed on the dorsal vessel, is Hh-insensitive. Within the
  Hh-sensitive domain, two distinct pathways primarily regulate the maintenance of
  Ci expression in the MZ. Hh signaling from the niche and ADGF signaling from the
  differentiated cells enhance full-length Ci (Ci-155) expression to support progenitor
  maintenance in a PKA-dependent manner. (A’) We demonstrate a third axis of Ci regulation
  independent of PKA coupled with cell adhesion and the activity of the actomyosin
  network essential for progenitor homeostasis. Here, cell–cell adhesion and the actomyosin
  network regulate morphogen-dependent patterning of the developing lymph gland progenitors
  of Drosophila via Ci-155 activity. This combination defines the tight zonation that
  evolves within the developing lymph gland and is instrumental in setting up of the
  hierarchy of progenitors at different levels of maturation. Loss of any one component
  Shg, Sqh, or Zip leads to initiation of the differentiation program. Ance is a genetic
  interactor of this pathway described. Dotted arrows indicate mechanisms yet to be
  understood.'
