caption: 'Hepatic fructose metabolism: A highly lipogenic pathway. Fructose is readily
  absorbed from the diet and rapidly metabolized principally in the liver. Fructose
  can provide carbon atoms for both the glycerol and the acyl portions of triglyceride.
  Fructose is thus a highly efficient inducer of de novo lipogenesis. High concentrations
  of fructose can serve as a relatively unregulated source of acetyl CoA. In contrast
  to glucose, dietary fructose does NOT stimulate insulin or leptin (which are both
  important regulators of energy intake and body adiposity). Stimulated triglyceride
  synthesis is likely to lead to hepatic accumulation of triglyceride, which has been
  shown to reduce hepatic insulin sensitivity, as well as increased formation of VLDL
  particles due to higher substrate availability, increased apoB stability, and higher
  MTP, the critical factor in VLDL assembly.'
