caption: Proposed schema of the pathways underlying renal protection conferred by
  xenon (Xe) preconditioning. Xenon preconditioning upregulates miR-21 expression,
  which downregulates its proapoptotic target effector phosphatase and tensin homolog
  deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), resulting in activation of protein kinase B (Akt)
  and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, inactivation of caspase-3, subsequently reducing apoptosis.
  In addition, miR-21 downregulates its proinflammatory effector programmed cell death
  protein 4 (PDCD4), resulting in a reduction of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity,
  and a decrease of inflammatory cytokines production, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
  and interleukin (IL)-6, an increase of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, subsequently
  inhibiting inflammation. Meanwhile, anti-inflammation contributes to antiapoptosis.
