caption: Schematic diagram showing involvement of signal transduction pathway PLC/IP3/Ca2+/CaMK
  in SKF83959-modulated biosynthesis of FGF-2 in striatal astrocytes. Based on the
  data shown in the present study and others, it is hypothesized that neurotransmitter
  dopamine, glutamate, and PI-linked D1-like receptor (PI-linked D1LR) ligand(s) may
  work together to tightly regulate the basic level of FGF-2 in astrocytes via either
  elevating or suppressing cytosol calcium levels.
