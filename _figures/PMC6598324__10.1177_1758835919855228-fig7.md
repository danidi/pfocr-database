caption: The potential mechanism of FOXP3-mediated regulation of cancer cell stemness.
  NNK could decrease EGFR-AS1 but increase HIF2A and FOXP3. The transcription factor
  HIF2A may bind to the FOXP3 promoter to increase the expression of FOXP3, promoting
  lung cancer cell stemness through the activation of the Notch pathway. In contract
  to HIF2A, the long noncoding RNA EGFR-AS1 may interact with the FOXP3 promoter to
  suppress the expression of FOXP3, thus inhibiting lung CSCs. CSC, cancer stem cells;
  EGFR-ASI, EGFR antisense RNA 1; HIF2A, hypoxia-inducible factor-2A; NNK, 4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone.
