caption: 'Model of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB
  activation mechanisms in response to intermittent hypoxia (IH). IH-induced hypoxic
  condition decreases PHD activity. As a result, NF-κB is induced to activate via
  the activation of I-κB kinase-β (IKKβ), which activates both the NF-κB mediated
  inflammation pathway and the NF-κB mediated up-regulation of HIF-1. Activation of
  NF-κB and HIF-1 induces inflammation and adaptation to IH, resulting in angiogenesis
  via the proliferation and migration of VSMC. PHD: prolyl hydroxylases.'
