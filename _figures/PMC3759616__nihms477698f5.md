caption: The schematic diagram illustrates that TNF-α on binding to its specific cell
  surface receptor, leads to caspase-8 activation which cleaves cytosolic BID to truncated
  BID (tBID). Translocation of cytosolic tBID to mitochondrial membrane triggers intrinsic
  apoptotic signaling resulting in release of cytochrome c, which in turn executes
  the final step in the apoptotic pathway by activating caspase-3. The active caspase-3
  then disrupts the adherens junctional protein complex, along with causing organizational
  changes in the actin cytoskeletal framework compromising barrier function of the
  endothelial cells. Mitochondrial anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL can protect
  the mitochondrial physiology from the apoptotic stimulus and thus attenuate the
  downstream apoptotic cascade.
