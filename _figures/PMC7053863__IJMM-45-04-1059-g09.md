caption: Schematic diagram of the anti-tumor function of scutellarein in colon cancer.
  Scutellarein treatment reduced the expression of RAGE via the CDC4-mediated ubiquitination
  degradation pathway, which then inhibited cell proliferation, tumorigenesis and
  induced cell apoptosis in colon cancer. RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end
  products; CDC4, cell division control protein 4.
