caption: Proposed pathway for biosynthesis of cyclothiazomycin. Eight proteins, CltB,
  CltC, CltD, CltE, CltF CltG, CltM, and CltN, are the candidate enzymes involved
  in posttranslational modification, and one transport protein, CltO, is predicted
  to transport the final product. Reaction a, dehydration reaction to produce thiazolines
  (red); reaction b, selective dehydrogenation reaction to produce thiazoles (green);
  reaction c, dehydration reaction to produce dehydroamino acids (blue); reaction
  d, simultaneous hetero-Diels-Alder cyclization and LP cleavage to produce a dehydropiperidine
  intermediate (purple); reaction e, deamination of the amino group generated by LP
  cleavage to form a trisubstituted pyridine (purple); reaction f, Michael addition
  reaction to generate the putative thioether intermediate; reaction g, molecular
  rearrangement suggested to generate a tertiary thioether.
