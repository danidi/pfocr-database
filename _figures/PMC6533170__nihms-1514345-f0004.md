caption: Pathway analysis was performed on significantly altered metabolites between
  CF groups and non-CF. The top regulators and their effect networks are displayed
  for A) CF Resp and CF LL versus non-CF and B) CF LW versus non-CF. A color-coded
  prediction legend displays predicted activation/inhibition as well as intensity
  of measurement.
