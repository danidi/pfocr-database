caption: Nonsplicing roles of the SF3b complex. The SF3b complex and its components
  participate in various molecular and cellular events that are beyond its canonical
  role in splicing. These events are sorted as either U2-dependent (labeled with circled
  numbers, ② for the 3′-end processing of histone pre-mRNA [], ③ for PcG-mediated
  Hox gene repression [] and ④ for the inhibition of AAV vector transduction []) or
  U2-independent (⑤ for novel mRNA export pathway mediated by THO []) for the SF3b
  complex in the nucleus. SF3b components are also engaged in several biological events
  that occur in different cellular compartments (⑥ for SF3b3 and SF3b5 containing
  the SAGA complex [, , ], ⑦ for SF3b1 containing the B-WICH complex [], ⑧ for SF3b3
  containing CRLs [, ], ⑨ for the SF3b4-p180 complex in ER translational control [],
  and ⑩ for the SF3b3-Mincle-mediated inflammatory response in necrotic cells []).
  The splicing pathway of the SF3b complex (labeled with ①) is also depicted for completeness
  and comparison
