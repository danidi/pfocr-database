caption: Representation of proteins and protein complexes involved in the “Autophagy
  – animal” KEGG pathway. This figure was taken from the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko04140)
  and modified. Blue boxes mark the proteins that are associated with AD. Orange boxes
  mark additional proteins that are not originally included in the pathway. These
  genes are associated with both AD and autophagy, and are discussed in the present
  review. Red, blue, and violet lines mark partners with which the additional proteins
  interact (red color means activation, blue color means inhibition, and violet color
  means unspecified or complex (e.g., both inhibitory and stimulatory effect) according
  to STRING database). The interactions data were extracted from the STRING database
  (http://string-db.org). To assure that the presented data is reliable, we have included
  only interactions that showed at least medium STRING confidence score and were either
  identified in an experiment or are annotated in manually curated databases. Additionally,
  we have added interaction between GFAP and LAMP, which was not included in STRING
  database but was found by manual literature search. Permission to use KEGG figure
  was granted.
