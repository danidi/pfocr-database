caption: A model illustrating the positive and negative regulation of PanK2 activity.
  Human PanK2 is proposed to localize in the IMS of mitochondria, where it phosphorylates
  pantothenate (Pan) to form 4′-phosphopantothenate (P-Pan). P-Pan translocates to
  the cytosol and is converted to CoA by the CoA biosynthetic pathway. Fatty acid
  β-oxidation in the matrix requires the carnitine shuttle system, which converts
  acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine in the IMS by the action of carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  I (CPTI); acylcarnitine is shuttled into the matrix by the carnitine:acylcarnitine
  translocase (CT) and converted back to acyl-CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  II (CPTII). Acyl-CoAs, including acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA), potently inhibit PanK2 activity
  by competing with the ATP substrate. Palmitoylcarnitine reverses the acetyl-CoA
  inhibition on PanK2 by competing with acetyl-CoA for the enzyme. The existence of
  both negative and positive regulation of PanK2 activity provides a mechanism to
  ensure ample supply of CoA for β-oxidation by controlling the activity of the mitochondria-localized
  PanK2, a rate-limiting step in the CoA biosynthetic pathway. OMM, outer mitochondrial
  membrane; IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane.
