caption: TGF-β signal transduction in iT reg versus Th17 cells. Upon binding of TGF-β
  to its receptor, the R-Smad components Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated. In iT
  reg cells, Smad2/3 then associate with Smad4, forming a heterotrimeric complex that
  mediates canonical TGF-β signaling. Smad2/3/4 translocate to the nucleus and enhance
  transcription of a regulatory gene signature, notably Foxp3 and Il10. Here,  describe
  a related but contrasting signaling pathway in Th17 cells. Phosphorylated Smad2/3
  associates with Trim33, forming a signaling complex that mediates noncanonical TGF-β
  signaling. Trim33 may also cause the degradation of Smad4 via ubiquitination. Upon
  translocation to the nucleus, Smad2/3/Trim33 cooperate with RORγt to repress Il10
  and amplify Il17a transcription, thereby optimizing Th17 cytokine responses.
