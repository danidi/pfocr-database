caption: 'Expression differences in males and females in response to reduced insulin
  signaling for immune response genes. For genes in the Toll/Imd signaling pathway
  (KEGG: dme04624), the expression differences are indicated by color, with color
  gradations from − 1 or less, to 1 or greater, using KEGG graph and Pathview [].
  Female control vs female InRDN-expressing flies (a) and male control vs male InRDN-expressing
  flies (b) are shown. The data in this figure was not filtered by a statistical cut-off.
  Green indicates higher expression in InRDN-expressing flies and red indicates higher
  expression in control flies'
