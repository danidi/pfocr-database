caption: Regulation of protein trafficking, receptor signaling, and protein clearance
  by ubiquitination in Alzheimer's disease. Improper processing of APP and Tau contribute
  to the pathology of AD. Excessive or improperly folded APP is cleared from the ER
  by HDR1 and Fbxo2 through the addition of K-48 linked chains. Ubiquitin-mediated
  processes are indicated by dashed lines. Maturation of APP is arrested in the early
  secretory pathway by non-degradative, K-63 linked ubiquitination that is stimulated
  by Ubiquilin 1. Surface APP is endocytosed to the late Golgi, where it is cleaved
  by secretases including BACE-1 and PS-1, whose levels are regulated by the E3 ligases
  Fbxo2 and FBXW-7, respectively. The cleavage of APP results in the production of
  Amyloid-Beta, which can be targeted for degradation by CHIP. Uncleared Amyloid-Beta
  is exocytosed to the extracellular space, where it aggregates to form plaques. Amyloid-Beta
  can influence NMDA receptor signaling. NMDA receptor activation stimulates the kinase
  Cdk5, which results in the downstream inhibition of the E3 ligase APC and blocks
  the degradation of cyclin B1. NMDA receptor signaling also increases the activation
  of GSK3B, which phosphorylates Tau. GSK3B is targeted for degradation by NUB1, which
  also blocks the interaction between GSK3B and Tau. GSK3B activity is increased by
  complexing with p53, whose levels are regulated by the E3 ligase MDM2. Under conditions
  of cellular stress, MDM2 auto-ubiquitinates and targets itself for degradation.
  The E3 ligase CHIP targets Tau, but can have divergent effects on its handling.
  When working in combination with Hsp70, CHIP targets Tau for degradation. However,
  when Hsp90 is involved, CHIP facilitates an alternative ubiquitination of unknown
  linkage type, resulting in the accumulation of phosphorylated tau. Through an unknown
  mechanism, this accumulated Tau then forms insoluble protein aggregates.
