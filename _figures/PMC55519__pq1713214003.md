caption: Pathway showing possible sequence of events in tumorigenesis. Following  mutations
  in the APC gene, a subset of tumors have  inactivation of mismatch repair genes
  and so diverge along a pathway  that includes mutations of the TGFβRII gene, and
  is  characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI+). A  subset of the remaining
  tumors acquire mutations in the  SMAD4 gene, accompanied by loss of the wild-type  chromosome
  18, and this either precedes or causes another subset of  tumors to diverge along
  a chromosomal instability (CIN+)  pathway with aneuploidy/polyploidy. The remaining
  tumors are  MSI−/CIN−.

  instability, but after divergence of the microsatellite  instability pathway.
