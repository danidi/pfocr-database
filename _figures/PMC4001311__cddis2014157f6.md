caption: Schematics of the regulation of the HMOX1 expression under normal (a and
  b) and stress conditions (c and d) and without (a and c) or with (b and d) BRD4
  knockdown. Under normal conditions, BRD4 directly activates the HMOX1 promoter over
  SP1-binding sites. In the presence of stress, HMOX1 expression is mainly regulated
  over the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway where BRD4 regulates KEAP1. The table summarizes the
  regulation of HMOX1 under varying BRD4 concentrations
