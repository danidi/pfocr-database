caption: 'Left: A metazoan hippo pathway in which a LATS–Mob1 complex is activated
  by MST/hippo kinases and inhibits the Yki/YAP transcriptional coactivator, based
  on research from Drosophila and mammalian cells. Right: Budding yeast have two distinct
  hippo pathways, the mitotic exit network (MEN), in which the LATS-related Dbf2 or
  Dbf20 kinase in complex with Mob1 controls mitotic exit and cytokinesis, and the
  RAM network, in which the NDR-related Cbk1 kinase in complex with Mob2 controls
  cell separation and morphogenesis.'
