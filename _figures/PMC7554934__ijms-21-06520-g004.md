caption: 'Working model for urethral dysfunction in PD. Schematic of our working model
  for urethral dysfunction. The active urethral closure mechanisms are regulated by
  the spinobulbospinal pathway. Intact: Descending signals of serotonergic and noradrenergic
  pathways from neurons in the raphe nucleus (RN) and locus coeruleus (LC), respectively.
  This neural circuit is under the control of the supraspinal regions and maintains
  urethral closure mechanisms. The descending signals travel downward to Onuf’s nucleus
  to innervate the external urethral sphincter and the pelvic floor muscle. Therefore,
  this neural system maintains active urethral closure mechanisms in the presence
  of increased inter-abdominal pressure. Under intact conditions, tonic inhibition
  (–) from supra-mesaticephalic sites suppresses bladder overactivity (+) and enhances
  urethral pressure (–). Parkinson‘s disease: PD dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
  nigra pars compacta (SN) are lost, and excitation (+) from the striatum is, therefore,
  decreased, leading to loss of the inhibitory functions of supra-mesaticephalic sites,
  including those of the cortex and supplementary motor areas (SMA). The loss of control
  results in facilitation of bladder overactivity (+) and inhibition of active urethral
  responses against increased intraabdominal pressure (–). 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine;
  NE, norepinephrine; PAG, periaqueductal grey; PMC, pontine micturition center.'
