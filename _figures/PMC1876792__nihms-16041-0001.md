caption: Schematic illustration of anti-apoptotic pro-survival signaling mechanisms,
  termed the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway, that have been proposed
  to protect the heart from reperfusion injury. Reperfusion is believed to promote
  opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which induces both apoptotic
  and necrotic cell death due to the release of mitochondrial proteins and loss of
  ATP-generating capacity. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (opioid and potentially
  adenosine receptors) or growth factor receptors during reperfusion is believed to
  initiate signaling mechanisms involving phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI-3k),
  akt, p42/p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mammalian target of rapamycin
  (TOR), p70s6 kinase, and glycogen synthase kinase β (GSKβ) that prevents opening
  of the MPTP. It has been proposed that an isoform of the ATP sensitive potassium
  channel (KATP) may also be expressed in the mitochondria that regulates MPTP opening.
