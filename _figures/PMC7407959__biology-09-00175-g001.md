caption: 'Surgery and temporal sequence of icv. injections, electrophysiological recordings.
  (A) Implantation of a guide cannula in the left ventricle for icv. vehicle or Aβ25–35
  administration. The photomicrograph serves as histological verification of cannula
  position (black arrow). (B) Bipolar stimulating electrodes were implanted at the
  right Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway of the dorsal hippocampus, and a recording
  electrode was placed at the ipsilateral stratum radiatum underneath the CA1 area.
  Photomicrographs illustrate the location (black arrows) of the stimulating (right
  photomicrograph) and recording (left photomicrograph) electrodes. (C) Representation
  of the fPSPs evoked in the CA1 hippocampal region after paired-pulse stimulation
  (interval of 40 ms) of the Schaffer collaterals. The recording was obtained from
  a representative animal and illustrates the averaged (n = 50) profile of the postsynaptic
  response. Two different components were identified for amplitude analysis: (1) A
  glutamatergic fEPSP (Glut), with a latency of appearance of 2.25–4 ms after Schaffer
  collateral stimulation; and (2) a GABAergic fIPSP dependent on GABAA receptors (GABAA),
  with a latency of 12–15 ms. For each component or postsynaptic potential, the maximum
  amplitude (peak-to-peak value) was measured for the analysis. (D) Vehicle or Aβ25–35
  administration was performed on days 1–3 (D1–D3). Local field potential (LFP) recordings
  were collected before (D0) and after Aβ25–35 administration (D1-D6). From days 6
  to 9 (D6–D9), the effect of Aβ25–35 on long-term potentiation (LTP) was checked.
  LTP was induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Schaffer collateral pathway.
  The responses to paired-pulse stimulation were collected before LTP induction (Baseline;
  BL) and after the HFS session (LTP1-4). Scale bars, 500 μm. RV, right ventricle;
  LV, lateral ventricle; DG, dentate gyrus; St., stimulus; D, dorsal; M, medial; L,
  lateral; V, ventral; Glut, glutamate.'
