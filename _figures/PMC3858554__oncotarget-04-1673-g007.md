caption: (A) Under normal conditions, PCa cells display downregulation of SIRT1, thus,
  sirtuin 1 is unable to promote H2A.Z negative regulation directly, through its degradation,
  and indirectly, through mTOR pathway repression, leading to upregulation of c-Myc
  and other oncogenes. (B) When exposed to TSA, alone or combined with 5-aza-dC, or
  resveratrol, levels of sirtuin 1 are restored, leading to decreased levels of H2A.Z,
  partially due to mTOR pathway inhibition, but mostly via direct interaction between
  sirtuin 1 and the histone variant. Similarly, c-Myc levels decrease after treatment
  with those drugs.
