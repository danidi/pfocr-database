caption: TGF-β induced signaling crosstalk network converges to SNAIL1. Reconstructed
  literature-based pathway crosstalk for TGF-β induced SNAIL1 expression. The node
  “others” refer remaining SNAIL1 activation pathways that have minor contributions
  to the time window under study and thus are not explicitly treated
