caption: Nucleotides are sensed by TLRs in endolysosomes in order to allow for the
  efficient discrimination between pathogen-associated and self-derived nucleic acids.
  Viral genomes are protected by their capsids until they are released within the
  endolysosomal compartment, whereas extracellular self-derived nucleic acids are
  degraded by DNases before reaching endolysosomes. Endosomal TLR responses are also
  limited by controlling their intracellular trafficking. Endosomal TRLs associate
  with gp96, PRAT4A, and UNC93B1 in the ER. These chaperone proteins facilitate the
  transport of intracellular TLRs through the Golgi via the conventional secretory
  pathway to the endolysosome (denoted by ()). In some instances, however, full length
  TLRs may be trafficked to the plasma membrane (denoted by ()). These mislocalized
  TLRs cannot signal since they are not processed to their active form at the plasma
  membrane like they are in the endolysosomal compartment by proteases, such as cathepsins.
