caption: Comparison of apple breeding parameters between standard breeding using phenotypic
  selection in the field, and genomics-assisted breeding where progeny are raised
  in conditions that promote flowering, and foreground marker assisted selection (MAS)
  is applied for major gene ‘must-have’ traits, followed by genome wide selection
  (GWS) for traits controlled by multiple loci (modified from Ref. 49). In standard
  breeding (pathway at left), elites are selected on the basis of breeding values
  for fruit traits calculated from phenotypic data (EBVs). In standard breeding programs
  under traditional orchard conditions, phenotypic evaluation for cultivar development
  occurs after a minimum of 5 years from seed. This is also the earliest that elites
  can be advanced as parents to the next cycle of breeding and material can be further
  evaluated for potential as commercial cultivars. Breeding programs using genomic
  technologies for selection of elites (pathways at right), coupled with promotion
  of early flowering, can advance selected progeny to phenotypic evaluation for cultivar
  development as early as 2 years from seed. As flowering of the first individuals
  in the breeding populations is at 27 months and the remainder at 36 months, the
  advance of elites as parents of the next generation can occur 5 years earlier, relative
  to time in standard breeding programs. In effect, the length of each breeding cycle
  is reduced by at least 4 years (Volz, pers. comm.). Two cycles of genotyping are
  employed. First, MAS is used to identify plants possessing simple traits critical
  to the success of a cultivar (in apple this is generally pest and disease resistance).
  Only this subset of the original breeding population is genotyped, employing a dense
  marker set to enable GWS for fruit traits under more complex genetic control, thus
  minimizing the cost of genotyping. Genotyping for GWS currently uses an 8K SNP array,
  but is likely to transition to ‘genotype-by-sequencing’ in the near future. GEBVs
  are calculated from genotypic data exclusively. The application of GWS relies on
  the use of a training population for development of the model for association of
  genetic markers with phenotypic traits and this population must be both genotyped
  and phenotyped. It should be genetically closely related to the selection population,
  and in practice the model is cyclically redeveloped following phenotyping of each
  generation of progeny. EBV, estimated breeding value.
