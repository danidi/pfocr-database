caption: TGF-β signaling. The pathway is activated when aTGF-β superfamily ligand
  binds to a TGF-β type II receptor dimer, which recruits and phosphorylates a type
  I receptor dimer forming a hetero-tetrameric complex with the ligand. The type I
  receptor goes on to phosphorylate R-Smads. Phosphorylated R-SMADs have a high affinity
  for the effector protein, coSMAD, and consequently forms a complex with coSMAD.
  R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate and enter the nucleus where they activate transcription.
