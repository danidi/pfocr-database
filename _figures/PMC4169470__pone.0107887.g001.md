caption: 'All genes, except for the mau cluster (gray), are present and >95% identical
  in M. extorquens PA1. M. extorquens AM1 and M. extorquens PA1 were grown on various
  C1 and multi-C substrates (blue) for this study. Genes highlighted in red were deleted
  in M. extorquens PA1 to uncover that the metabolic network involved in methylotrophy
  in M. extorquens PA1 is identical to M. extorquens AM1. TCA: Tricarboxylic acid
  Cycle and EMC: Ethyl-malonyl CoA Pathway.'
