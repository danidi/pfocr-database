caption: 'Schematic diagram represents the T cell receptor signaling pathway populated
  by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis using genes assigned to all three classes detected
  throughout the time course of activation. Shapes in green represent the class of
  genes with differential expression without alternative splicing (DE). Shapes in
  red represent the class of genes that are alternatively spliced with constitutive
  gene expression (AS+CE). Shapes in blue represent genes both alternatively spliced
  and differentially expressed (AS+DE). Legend for Ingenuity-Mapped Interactions:
  A  =  Activation, C  =  Causes/Leads to, CP  =  Chemical-Protein Interaction, EC
   =  Enzyme Catalysis, I  =  Inhibition, M  =  Biochemical Modification, P  =  Phosphorylation/Dephosphorylation,
  PP  =  Protein-Protein binding, RE  =  Reaction, TR  =  Translocation. An arrow
  pointing from A to B signifies that A causes B to be activated.'
