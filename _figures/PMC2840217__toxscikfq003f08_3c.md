caption: Alteration in Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) in response to MG132 (A),
  methylmercury (MeHg, B), and cadmium (Cd, C) in MEF cells. A knowledge-based UPS
  pathway was built in GenMAPP program. Differential gene expression was based on
  treatment versus control expression change (1.5-fold and p ≤ 0.05, t-test). Red
  or green indicates a significant upregulated or downregulated level of expression
  after treatment. Gray indicates that the selection criteria were not met, but the
  gene is presented on the array. White boxes indicate that the gene was not present
  on the chip. The comparison of the UPS pathway mapping among metals (Cd and MeHg)
  and proteasome inhibitor MG132 revealed both common and unique targets on the UPS
  in the MEF. Cd, MeHg, and MG132 treatment in MEF cell induced significant upregulation
  of proteasome regulatory complex 19s (PA700) and deubiquitination gene Uchl1 and
  significant downregulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ube2C, 2700084L22Rik.
