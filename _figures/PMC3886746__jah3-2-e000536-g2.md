caption: cGMP signaling and myocardial dysfunction and remodeling in HFpEF. Comorbidities
  induce a systemic proinflammatory state with elevated plasma levels of interleukin
  (IL)–6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α, soluble ST2 (sST2), and pentraxin 3. Coronary
  microvascular endothelial cells reactively produce reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAMs), and E‐selectin. Production of ROS leads
  to formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability,
  both of which lower soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activity in adjacent cardiomyocytes.
  Lower sGC activity decreases cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentration and protein
  kinase G (PKG) activity. Low PKG activity increases resting tension (Fpassive) of
  cardiomyocytes because of hypophosphorylation of titin and removes the brake on
  prohypertrophic stimuli inducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. VCAM and E‐selectin
  expression in endothelial cells favors migration into the subendothelium of monocytes.
  These monocytes release transforming growth factor β (TGF‐β). The latter stimulates
  conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which deposit collagen in the interstitial
  space. cGMP indicates cyclic guanosine monophosphate; COPD, chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Adapted

  description: cGMP signaling and myocardial dysfunction and remodeling in HFpEF.
    Comorbidities induce a systemic proinflammatory state with elevated plasma levels
