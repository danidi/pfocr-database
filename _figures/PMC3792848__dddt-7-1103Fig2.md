caption: 'Putative mechanisms of α-synuclein neurodegeneration in familial PD.Notes:
  The presence of Lewy bodies in PD is caused by a failure to properly dispose of
  α-synuclein. Point mutations in α-synuclein and the recently described Iowan functional
  duplication lead to excessive intracellular accumulation of α-synuclein, resulting
  in spontaneous oligomerization of this protein. Mutant α-synuclein can inhibit proteasomal
  activity, potentially leading to enhanced accumulation; soluble α-synuclein protofibrils
  and intracellular protein aggregates have been shown to impair the proteasome. Dopamine
  may also form stable adducts with protofibrils, potentially enhancing this toxicity.
  Genetic mutations associated with the UPP pathway, including parkin and UCH-L1,
  are associated with familiar PD. Combined with other cellular stress, this leads
  to neuronal loss.Copyright © 2003. Elsevier. Reproduced with permission from Eriksen
