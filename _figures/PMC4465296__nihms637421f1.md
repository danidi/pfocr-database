caption: 'More than 90% of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients have mutations (G12D/G12V)
  in codon 12 of KRAS that results in its constitutive activation and hyper activation
  of its downstream signaling pathways accompanied by increased proliferation, motility
  and survival of PC cells. KRAS targeting miRNAs like miR-217, -96, -126, -143/145
  and Let-7 are significantly down regulated in PC patients that results in increased
  KRAS expression. Restoration of these miRNAs expression may result in abrogation
  of KRAS mediated signaling pathways such as (A) RAF/MEK/ERK that will result in
  decreased PC cell proliferation, (B) PI3K/AKT pathway abrogation will decrease PC
  cell survival, C) Inhibition of NF-κB and ETV4 will result in decreased cell invasion
  and metastasis by up regulating E-Cadherin expression and (D) Down regulation of
  Tiam1 and Ral-GEF will effect cell polarity, vesicular trafficking, cell cycle and
  transcriptional dynamics in pancreatic cancer (miRNAs in color in green indicates
  downregulated in PC). RAF: Raf/mil family of serine/threonine protein kinases; MEK:
  Mitogenactivated protein kinase; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases; ETS:
  E-twenty-six family transcription factors; ELK1: ELK1, member of ETS oncogene family;
