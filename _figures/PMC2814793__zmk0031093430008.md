caption: Role of G protein subunits in the K. lactis mating pathway. The three subunits
  of the trimeric protein play positive roles in the transmission of the pheromone
  stimulus. Although the Gβ subunit is the main transducer, Gα is required at some
  degree, and Gγ is dispensable. To be active, Gβ has to be tethered to the membrane
  by action of Gα and/or Gγ. Soluble Gβ is unable to activate the mating system. Gβ
  fused to a CCAAX motif (curved arrow) partially bypasses lack of Gα and Gγ. Gβ subunit
  defective in its interaction with Gα (indicated by the black star) can function
  only in presence of Gγ.
