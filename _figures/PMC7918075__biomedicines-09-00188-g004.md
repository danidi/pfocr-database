caption: Putative model for the involvement of cell signaling pathways in the induction
  of survival by type I (α/β) and II (γ) IFNS in CLL cells. By binding to their respective
  IFN-receptors, type I and II IFNs likely lead to the activation of JAKs (TYK2 and
  JAK2 respectively) and an Src member kinase, which in turn activate STAT3. STAT3
  dimer enters the nucleus and binds the MCL1 promoter. Following MCL1 transcription,
  Mcl-1 protein accumulates in the cytoplasm, and Mcl-1 exerts its anti-apoptotic
  activity by preventing mitochondrial depolarization, leading to the inhibition of
  caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation, ultimately favoring cell resistance
  to apoptosis. Both type I and II IFNs increase ROS mitochondrial concentrations,
  possibly through the sequential activation of STAT3 and its target gene LPL that
  shifts the metabolic program of CLL cells towards the utilization of lipids and
  then to an abundant ROS production into the mitochondria; increase .
