caption: 'IRS4 signaling in malignant cells and therapy resistance. (A) Simplified
  IRS (insulin receptor substrate) 2-induced phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase
  (PI3K) signaling cascade in normal cells expressing IRS1 and IRS2 (left) or cells
  expressing IRS4 (right). In most normal cells either IRS1 or IRS2, or both IRSs
  are expressed, whereas IRS4 is rarely expressed. IRS1 and IRS2 activity is kept
  in check by negative feedback via SHP2 (Src homology phosphatase 2) mediated tyrosine
  dephosphorylation. In cancer cells, various mutagenic events may activate IRS4,
  which is irresponsive to SHP2 mediated feedback and hyperactivates the PI3K pathway
  leading to tumor growth. (B) Tumorigenesis requires continues stimulation of the
  PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathways. The HER2/HER3 (human
  epidermal growth factor receptor 2/3) heterodimer may provide both these signals
  in a subset of tumors, where HER2 provides the MAPK signal and HER3 the PI3K signal.
  IRS4 synergistically enhances HER2-induced tumorigenesis by hyperactivating the
  PI3K pathway. Trastuzumab (humanized monoclonal antibodies against HER2) and lapatinib
  (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibiting HER2 kinase activity) prevent the oncogenic
  signals of HER2 and HER3, but this is circumvented by IRS4-induced hyperactivation
  of the PI3K pathway, leading to therapy resistance. NRG1 and NRG2: ligands for HER3.
  RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase. Thickness of the arrows indicates strength of signaling.
  Red “X” indicates no interaction.'
