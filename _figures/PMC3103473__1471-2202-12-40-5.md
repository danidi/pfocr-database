caption: Shear stress modulates the endothelial bioenergetic pathway. Panel A and
  B Enzimatic pathways of glycolysis and Krebb's cycle. Note the change in the expression
  of genes encoding for the key regulator enzymes of glucose metabolism and how the
  exposure to flow greatly favoured the more efficient aerobic pathway. The gene array
  data were confirmed by measurements of glucose consumption versus lactate production
  in DIV-BBB model developed with and without l endothelial exposure to intraluminal
  flow (Panel C). Comparative analysis of the expression level of key enzymes regulating
  the glycolitic and the aerobic (Krebb's cycle) pathways strongly supported the gene
  array data (Panel D). Note that the lactate production/glucose consumption ratio
  measured in the flow-exposed in vitro BBB modules was ≈ 1. Complete anaerobic metabolism
  would produce 2 lactates/glucose (ratio = 2) thus, indicating that at least 50%
  of the glucose consumed underwent aerobic metabolism.
