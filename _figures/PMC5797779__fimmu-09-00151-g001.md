caption: The biochemical function and regulation of indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1).
  (A) The kynurenine (Kyn) pathway of tryptophan (Trp) catabolism. l-Trp is metabolized
  in three separate biochemical pathways (indicated by arrows). In the Kyn pathway,
  IDO1/IDO2 and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) catalyze the first and rate-limiting
  step of Trp degradation that gives rise to N-formylkynurenine. N-formylkynurenine
  is then transformed into l-Kyn and formic acid by kynurenine formamidase. l-Kyn
  is converted to anthranilic acid by kynureninase or l-hydroxykynurenine by kynurenine
  hydroxylase. Non-specific hydroxylation of anthranilic acid results in l-hydroxykynurenine.
  Kynureninase converts l-hydroxykynurenine to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid that is further
  metabolized by hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase to aminocarboxymuconic semialdehyde.
  The semialdehyde spontaneously forms quinolinic acid that is a precursor of NAD+synthesis,
  or a decarboxylase enzyme converts it to aminomuconic semialdehyde. Aminomuconic
  semialdehyde is then converted to picolinic acid or glutaryl-CoA that is metabolized
  in the tricarbonic acid cycle and terminal oxidation. Metabolites that are highlighted
  in red have been directly implicated in immunosuppressive mechanisms and cancer
  development. (B) The structure of the IDO1 gene. IDO1 is located on chromosome 8
  [39771328–39786309 forward (+) strand; 14,982 base pairs] comprising 10 exonic region
  (red bars). The promoter region (green section upstream the transcription start
  site) contains several transcription factor-binding sites that have been identified
  by ChIP sequencing. ChIP peaks were collected from the GTRD database of transcription
  binding sites (). Only normal (non-transformed) cell types were considered. (C)
  The role of IDO1 in cancer immunoediting. In the first phase of immunoediting (“elimination”),
  sporadically arising transformed cells are destroyed by the innate and adaptive
  immune systems. Activated B cells produce tumor reactive antibodies to eradicate
  most transformed cells. Natural killer (NK) cells and effector T cells release inflammatory
  cytokines, such as IFN-γ, which activate dendritic cells (DCs) that secrete low
  levels of IDO1. IDO1 depletes the essential amino acid Trp from the tumor microenvironment
  that inhibits tumor growth. In the “equilibrium” phase, surviving tumor cells are
  still controlled by the immune system; however, they rapidly accumulate mutations.
  When the immune system can no longer block the abnormal and autonomous growth of
  “edited” cells, the tumor becomes clinically manifested (“escape”). The escape phase
  is associated with high IDO1 level that is primarily produced by tumor cells and
  tolerogenic immune cells [e.g., tolerogenic DCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells
  (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)]. Trp depletion and Kyn accumulation
  lead to immunosuppression and tolerogenicity by inhibiting effector T cell and NK
  cell functions and stimulating regulatory T cells. IDO1 also promotes the expansion
  and activation of MDSCs and induces polarization of macrophages to a tolerogenic
  phenotype. Increased Kyn levels activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that
  switch the activity of DCs from immunogenic to tolerogenic. Elevated CTLA4 expression
  of regulatory T cells results in further increase of IDO1 secretion by DCs. IDO1-induced
  expansion and activation of regulatory T cells, tolerogenic DCs, and MDSCs suppress
  the activity of antitumor effector T cells. Other immunosuppressive agents (e.g.,
  PD-L1/PD-1, CTLA4) also inhibit effector T cell functions. Oncological immunotherapy
  aims to reverse immunoediting (backward arrow) by inhibiting and activating local
  immunosuppressive and tumor eradication mechanisms, respectively.
