caption: Note that both OXPHOS and the glycolytic pathway jointly contribute to ATP
  production. Doxycycline inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS, by acting
  via mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs); Vitamin C inhibits glycolytic metabolism
  by targeting and inhibiting the enzyme GAPDH. Therefore, their use together, as
  a sequential drug combination, will more severely target cell metabolism and energy
  production, thereby preventing or blocking the propagation of CSCs.
