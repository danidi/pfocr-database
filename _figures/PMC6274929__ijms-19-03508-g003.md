number: Figure 3
caption: 'p8I inhibits T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction and NFAT activation:
  p8I is a proteolytic product of p12I in the ER membranes, the protein traffics to
  plasma membrane and localizes in the immunological synapse; p8I interacts with and
  inhibits the phosphorylation of the transmembrane protein called linker for activation
  of T cells (LAT) and by doing so, p8I disables LAT to transmit signals from TCR
  and to interact with other proteins, such as phospholipase C gamma 1, Vav proteins,
  and lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (shown in red, cyan and green) on
  the TCR signaling pathway.'
