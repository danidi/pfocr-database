caption: Pathways involved in physiological and in pathological cardiac hypertrophy
  actuated in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Signal transduction pathways pave
  the way for cellular mechanisms controlling gene expression; a cascade of molecules
  leading to the activation of one or more specific transcription factors is actuated.
  The extracellular signals in the form of ligands/effector molecules, which bind
  to specific receptors to initiate the hypertrophy producing pathways, are transcribed
  across the sarcolemma via an assortment of second messengers. In physiological forms
  of cardiomyocyte/myocardial growth only direct mechanotransduction routes and the
  PI3K(p110α) lipid kinase - Akt serine/threonine kinase pathway are activated, downstream
  from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), leading to left ventricular (LV) remodeling
  involving replication of cardiomyocyte sarcomeres both in-parallel and in-series
  and an eccentric LV hypertrophy pattern with enhanced myocardial performance. On
  the other hand, in the pathological form of hypertrophy that is induced in conjunction
  with the LV pressure overload of CAVD (or hypertension), there ensues activation
  of a diverse, wider variety of signaling pathways, involving G Protein-Coupled Receptors
  (GPCR). GPCR mediate pathological cardiac hypertrophy through downstream mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2),
  and calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase that controls hypertrophic gene transcription
  by dephosphorylating transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells
  (NFAT). This ultimately leads to the identifiable expression of a maladaptive genetic
  program, with activation of protein translation concluding with replication of cardiomyocyte
  sarcomeres in-parallel and a typically concentric LV hypertrophy; these are complicated
  by cellular apoptosis and ECM fibrosis, by (subendocardial) ischemia with diastolic
  and systolic dysfunction, and by transition to heart failure with subsequent LV
  chamber dilatation (see particulars in text).

  description: Pathways involved in physiological and in pathological cardiac hypertrophy
    actuated in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Signal transduction pathways

    which bind to specific receptors to initiate the hypertrophy producing pathways,

    In physiological forms of cardiomyocyte/myocardial growth only direct mechanotransduction
