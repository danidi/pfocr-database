caption: Simplified working model of chloroplast redox regulation. (A) Classically
  recognized “light-side” reaction. In response to light-dependent excitation of electron
  transport chain (ETC), redox-regulated proteins are reduced via the FTR/Trx pathway.
  (B) Newly emerging “dark-side” reaction. Redox-regulated proteins are oxidized via
  the TrxL2/2CP pathway. Several other factors may also be involved in this process
  directly or indirectly. See the main text for details. Ox, oxidized form; Red, reduced
  form.
