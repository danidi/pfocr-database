caption: Inflammation induces binding of cytokines and inflammatory ligands to their
  receptors, which in turn activate the corresponding transcription factor signaling
  pathways. Binding of HH to the transmembrane protein PTC reverses the inhibitory
  effect on SMO, which again releases GLI transcription factors from their inhibitory
  complex and finally initiates nuclear translocation. The activation of the pathway
  can be blocked by inhibitors of SMO such as cyclopamine and its derivatives currently
  in clinical studies, GDC-0449 and IPI-926. Interactions with the NF-κB signaling
  pathway are illustrated by the dashed arrowhead which indicates activation of the
  HH pathway mainly through the regulation of the expression of its ligand SHH. Binding
  of EGF or IL-6 activates IKKβ kinase which stimulates degradation of IκBα. Subsequently,
  NF-κB proteins are released to the nucleus, where they mediate gene transcription
  alone or in cooperation with STAT proteins. Curcumin, Quercetin, Isoflavone and
  proteasome or GSK-3 inhibitors interfere with NF-κB signaling mainly through inhibition
  of NF-κB activation. Thereby, p-STAT3 binding to p-p65 induces histone acetyl transcerase
  p300 and retains active p65 in the nucleus. Synthetic terpenoids can either block
  isolated NF-κB and STAT3 activation, or inhibit the interaction of both pathways.
  A putative binding of p50 to STAT3 is shown by the dashed circle. The STAT3 signaling
  pathway can as well be activated by the aforementioned inflammatory stimuli. Upon
  binding of the ligands to the transmembrane receptors (receptor-bound) kinases,
  such as JAKs, SRC or ABL, are activated and in turn phosphorylate STAT3 proteins.
  EGFR inhibitor erlotinib as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZD0530 and dasatinib
  have shown to efficiently block STAT3 activation. The subsequent dimerization leads
  to nuclear translocation and target gene transcription, partially by interaction
  with NFAT transcription factors. The interaction on target promoters is not dependent
  on STAT and NFAT phosphorylation, illustrated by dashed circles. The canonical NFAT
  signaling pathway is activated by intracellular Ca2+ rises leading to activation
  of the phosphatase Calcineurin and dephosphorylation of NFAT proteins which shuttle
  to the nucleus and bind to their target promoters. Calcineurin inhibitors CsA and
  FK506 block NFAT dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NFAT phosphorylation
  does not exclude nuclear localization and binding to partner proteins, shown by
  dashed white circles. The dashed arrow indicates a possible interaction with p65,
  which has been demonstrated for other non-pancreatic tissues. GSK-3 inhibitors successfully
  disrupt NFAT binding to partner proteins such as STAT3 as well as NFAT transcriptional
  activity in the nucleus. Finally, the network of inflammatory transcription factors
  regulate numerous target genes mediating inflammation, growth, invasion, angiogenesis
  and metastasis, thereby contributing to pancreatic carcinogenesis. PTC, indicates
