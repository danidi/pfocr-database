caption: A schematic model for the function of RPL6 in regulating the HDM2-p53 circuit.
  In response to ribosomal stress, RPL6 relocates into the nucleoplasm, where it interacts
  with HDM2 and inhibits HDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently,
  overexpression of RPL6 leads to p53-dependent cell growth inhibition. In turn, the
  binding of RPL6 with HDM2 triggers RPL6 ubiquitination and degradation, thus forming
  an autoregulatory loop. The decreased level of RPL6 makes p53 come back to the basal
  level.
