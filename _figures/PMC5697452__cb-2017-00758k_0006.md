caption: Overview of the mechanism by which MMP-9 regulates formation of focal adhesion
  junctions. (A) During exocytosis and upon being secreted into the extracellular
  space, proMMP-9 forms a large complex with itself that can then act as a scaffold
  for promoting outside-in signaling. In our model, PEX-9 scaffolding promotes the
  association of β1 integrin-EGFR-CD44. Interaction with CD44 results in enhanced
  EGFR activation in addition to increased phosphorylation of its downstream targets
  AKT and Erk 1 + 2 (through the MAPK/Erk pathway). While complexed to β1 integrin,
  EGFR then goes on to transactivate Src kinase after it is recruited to the α4 integrin
  subunit during the generation of a new focal adhesion contact site. After activation,
  Src can then directly phosphorylate FAK currently associated with the β1 integrin
  subunit resulting in its maximal catalytic activity. This active Src–FAK complex
  can then bind and activate PAX, resulting in a mature FAK-PAX complex necessary
  for the formation of focal adhesion junctions. Formation of a complex between FAK
  and PAX results in final translocation to ECM–integrin junctions at the cell surface
  where they regulate cytoskeletal interactions resulting in enhanced cellular adhesion,
  migration, and invasion of cancer cells. (B) Treatment with PEX-9 inhibitor (depicted
  as red triangle) prevents MMP-9 scaffolding, thereby preventing downstream signaling
  driven by EGFR activation.
