caption: 'Hypoxia contributes to Aβ deposition by activating BACE1 transcription.
  Hypoxia activates BACE1 by three distinct mechanisms: generation of oxidative stress
  and the subsequent activation of the JNK pathway; activation of HIF-1 transcription
  factor which activates BACE1 promoter directly or indirectly through the activation
  of NF-κB and RAGE; activation of calpain and cdk5 resulting from increased calcium
  concentrations. By activating BACE1 transcription, hypoxia thus leads to Aβ deposition.
  Aβ, amyloid peptide; AGE, advanced glycation end products; BACE1, β-secretase βAPP
  cleaving enzyme 1; cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor
  1; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; RAGE, receptor for advanced
  glycation end products.'
