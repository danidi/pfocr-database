caption: Snapshot of the RPGeNet generated graph, where the nodes have been reordered
  to show the interactions, captured when searching for nodes at distance 1 of CEP250
  upon the level 1 subnetwork. This query using a non RP-gene retrieved a sub-network
  that includes 8 RP/LCA-genes (four of which are non-syndromic). As described in
  the Results section, CEP250 conforms a specific pathway relating NEK2 (RP gene)
  to USH2A (a gene causing RP and Usher syndrome), via NINL (edges highlighted in
  red). These bridging genes are all good candidates to contribute to retinal dystrophies.
  The RP/LCA genes are highlighted by a violet border, while border color for “parent”
  and “child” nodes is indicated by light blue and green, respectively. The shape,
  border and core color, as well as node size, are defined as in .
