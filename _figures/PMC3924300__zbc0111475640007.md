caption: Roles proposed for the epoxygenase the regulation of renal sodium reabsorption
  and plasma volume. Ascending and descending arrows denote increases and decreases
  in boxed parameters, respectively. Dashed arrows are used to indicate that the mechanisms
  by which changes in dietary salt alter EGF signaling and/or Cyp2c44 expression,
  changes in plasma/extracellular fluid volume regulate Cyp2c44 epoxygenase activity
  and/or expression, and the EETs regulate the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway remain to be
  characterized. Red and blue arrows indicate pro- and antihypertensive effects, respectively.
