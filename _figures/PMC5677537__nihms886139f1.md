caption: Ethanol upregulates TNF-α in Kupffle cells via the activation of multiple
  pathways Ethanol administration activates the TLR4 pathway, ROS production and complement
  activation to increase the expression of TNF-α. First, alcohol uptake increases
  intestine permeability and induces gut bacterial overgrowth. LPS from the intestinal
  bacteria will translocate into the liver via the portal vein and activates the TLR4
  pathway. Upon activation, TLR4 will dimerize and recruit complicated adaptor proteins
  to initiateMyD88 dependent and independent pathways. A MyD88 dependent pathway mediates
  the activation of NF-κB, which transactivates the Tnfa gene transcription. A MyD88
  independent pathway activates another transcription factor IRF3 to increase the
  transcription of Tnfa gene transcription. Moreover, the TLR4 signal also activates
  ERK and p38 MAPK pathways through multiple signal cascades. Activation of ERK increases
  the activity of EGR-1, an important transcription factor to enhance the expression
  of Tnfa gene. The p38 signal pathway contributes to the Egr-1 mRNA stabilization
  in the presence of ethanol, which also increases TNF-α protein production. Second,
  ethanol treatment increases the ROS production from NADPH oxidase, which may enhance
  the ERK and p38 pathways. Finally, the C3 and C5 complements are also activated
  in ethanol-fed mice. The C3aR and C5aR mediated signals increase the Tnfa mRNA through
  yet unknown mechanisms.
