caption: Pathways for the biosynthesis and recycling of β-alanine. (A) After its release
  from the photoreceptor terminal, where it acts on the dendrites of large monopolar
  cells (LMC), histamine (HA) is recycled by a glial shuttle pathway in the lamina
  that requires β-alanine (β-A) in the epithelial glia (EG) for the biosynthesis of
  β-alanyl-histamine (carcinine, CA) under the influence of Ebony, and that releases
  β-alanine along with histamine in the photoreceptor terminal (R1–R6) under the action
  of Tan. (B) In insects, β-alanine is synthesized from aspartate or uracil by two
  main pathways, regulated either from aspartate by aspartate decarboxylase (black),
  or from uracil (C) in succession by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [Pyd1, encoded
  by su(r)1], dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase (dihydropyrimidase, Pyd2) and β-ureidopropionase
  (β-alanine synthase, Pyd3). Synonyms for the corresponding Drosophila genes involved
  in the synthesis of β-alanine from uracil are indicated. Mutant black1 (b1) lacks
  the first pathway, mutant su(r)1rC lacks the second pathway and double mutant su(r)1rC;
  b1 lacks both pathways (B).
