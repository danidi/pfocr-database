caption: 'Life cycle of hepatitis B virus.Entry: HBV is tethered to HSPG, and this
  facilitates entry via its receptor NTCP. HBV is endocytosed into the cell and released
  into the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte.Nuclear transport: After uncoating of the HBV
  virion in the cytoplasm, the partially double-stranded DNA is transported to the
  nucleus, where its genomic rcDNA is repaired by host enzymes to form cccDNA, the
  template for HBV replication.Transcription: cccDNA generates pgRNA that produces
  the core protein and viral polymerase, precore mRNA that produces HBeAg, and the
  subgenomic RNAs that produce HBsAg and HBx proteins.Encapsidation: The HBV core
  protein (core) is critical for formation of replication complexes containing the
  pgRNA and polymerase, forming an immature nucleocapsid. After RT of the pgRNA, a
  mature nucleocapsid containing DNA is formed. Core is also required for intracellular
  trafficking, and encapsidated HBV genomes are imported back into the nucleus via
  the intracellular conversion pathway, partly replenishing the pool of cccDNA minichromosomes.Assembly
  and secretion: Mature nucleocapsids are enveloped with HBsAg (pre-S1, pre-S2, and
  S) proteins through the ESCRT machinery in the Golgi, resulting in the secretion
  of mature virions and releasing excess HBsAg as filamentous subviral particles.
  The HBsAg subviral 22-nm particles are produced in great excess and secreted via
  the ER-Golgi apparatus. HBeAg is a soluble and secreted product of precore mRNA.'
