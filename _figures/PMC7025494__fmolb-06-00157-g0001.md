caption: Cytoskeletal Regulation of the Hippo pathway in Drosophila and Mammals. Schematic
  diagram shows the core kinase cascade of the Hippo pathway and its interplay with
  upstream cytoskeletal regulators in Drosophila and mammals. Corresponding colors
  and shapes are used to indicate homologous components in both systems. When Hippo
  signaling is off, the nuclear effector Yki/YAP/TAZ can bind to the transcription
  factor Sd/TEAD to turn on target genes. Upon phosphorylation of Hpo/MST1/2 by upstream
  stimuli, Wts/LATS1/2 is activated and phosphorylates Yki/YAP/TAZ, which makes the
  later ones retain in the cytosol or further undergo degradation. The cytoskeletal
  regulators can also control the nuclear translocation of Yki/YAP/TAZ without their
  phosphorylation by Wts/LATS1/2. See text for further details. Hpo, Hippo; Sav, Salvador;
  Wts, Warts; Mats, Mob as a tumor suppressor; Yki, Yorkie; Ex, Expanded; Mer, Merlin;
  Crb, Crumbs; Sd, Scalloped.

    When Hippo signaling is off, the nuclear effector Yki/YAP/TAZ can bind to the
