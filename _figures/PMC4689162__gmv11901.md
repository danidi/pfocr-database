caption: Beclin-1 interaction complexes Atg14L and UVRAG/Bif-1 activate the Beclin-1
  complexes and induce the formation of autophagosomes in a mutually exclusive manner.
  UVRAG also potentially functions to promote autophagosome maturation and endocytic
  trafficking through pathways independent of its interaction with Beclin-1. VMP-1
  and PINK1 are two other interacting partners and inducers of autophagy. NIF-1 is
  a component of the PI3K complex contributing to the interaction of Beclin-1 and
  Bcl-2 at the ER surface. Bcl-2/Bcl-XL has similar function in Beclin-1 binding and
  autophagy inhibition. JNK1 and DAPK are autophagy inducers that phosphorylate Bcl-2
  and Beclin-1, respectively, to disrupt their interaction with each other. HMGB1
  (high-mobility group box 1), a p53 interacting chromatin protein, induces autophagy
  for cell protection against damage in a similar fashion. TRAF6 and USP13 are reported
  to play a role in Beclin-1 ubiquitination. Survivin is a Beclin-1-binding anti-apoptotic
  protein to regulate TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Rubicon binds Beclin-1 to inhibit autophagosome
  formation and maturation. Dissociation of upstream activators TAB1/2 in TAK1-IKK
  pathway is thought to be necessary for autophagy induction. GAPR-1 binds Beclin-1
  to inhibit autophagy; however, the mechanism is not entirely clear.
