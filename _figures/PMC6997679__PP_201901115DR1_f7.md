caption: Model illustrating the influence of pheophorbide a homeostasis on JA signaling.
  The middle (wild type [WT]) shows the PAO/phyllobilin pathway under normal senescence
  conditions, leading to the complete degradation of chl to vacuole-localized phyllobilins.
  Left and right show modulation of catabolite homeostasis caused by mutations of
  either nye1-1 or pph-1 (left) or pao1 (right), and the respective observed downstream
  modulation of the JA response (dashed arrows). Arrow sizes schematically represent
  relative flux (metabolite) and response (JA signaling) intensities. Among the few
  genes differentially expressed in nye1-1 and pph-1, jasmonate-ZIM domain genes were
  downregulated compared to wild type. On the other hand, in pao1, JA biosynthesis
  and signaling genes as well as some JA bioactive derivatives were induced. DNCC,
  dioxobilin-type nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolite; NCC, nonfluorescent chlorophyll
  catabolite; pFCC, primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite.
