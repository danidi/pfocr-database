caption: 'Representative simplified scheme summarizing the main findings discussed.
  The diagram outlines the interaction between NO and H2S in physiological (HEALTHY)
  and pathological (IBVD) conditions. HEALTHY: In endothelium, eNOS is bound to CAV‐1,
  a resident protein of caveolae that keeps eNOS in a less active state. When intracellular
  Ca2+ rises, Ca2+‐calmodulin complex is formed and binds eNOS. This event contributes
  to the displacement of eNOS from the negative control of CAV‐1, leading to enzyme
  activation and NO production. At the same time, Ca2+‐calmodulin complex also activates
  CSE, leading to H2S biosynthesis. Being gases, NO and H2S diffuse into smooth muscle
  cells reaching their own targets: sGC for NO and PDE for H2S. NO activates sGC leading
  to cGMP increase, while H2S inhibits PDE reducing cGMP degradation. cGMP, by interacting
  with PKG, activates the downstream signalling that leads to vasodilatation. In addition,
  H2S acts as an opener of KATP channels, expressed on smooth muscle cells leading
  to efflux of K+ ions from the cells. This event reduces calcium influx into the
  cells contributing to vessel relaxation. CSE is also expressed in smooth muscle
  cells where it actively produces H2S. IBVD: vascular diseases are characterized
  by an overproduction of ROS that induce oxidative stress. This condition damages
  the endothelium, impairing both eNOS and CSE activity with consequent reduction
  of both NO and H2S biosynthesis. The oxidative stress can also affect KATP channel
  activity. The limited amount of NO provided by a damaged endothelium, still can
  activate the signal transduction pathway relying on the contribution of smooth muscle
  cell‐generated H2S that in turn, by inhibiting PDE, allows a production of cGMP
  within the threshold necessary to trigger the downstream signal. Solid line: activation;
  dotted line: inhibition.'
