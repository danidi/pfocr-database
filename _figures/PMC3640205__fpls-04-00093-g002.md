caption: Overview of the raffinose synthesis pathway and of its relationship with
  the sucrose and starch synthesis pathways. This figure shows that glucose 6-phosphate
  (Glc6P) can be used either for the synthesis of starch in chloroplasts or for the
  synthesis of sucrose or myo-inositol and raffinose in the cytosol. After TOR inactivation,
  or mutations in the TORC1 components RAPTOR and LST8, an accumulation of starch
  and sucrose was observed together with a decrease in the synthesis of raffinose
  in stress conditions. This suggests TOR inactivation triggers a redirection of C
  fluxes toward starch and sucrose for, respectively, storage and export. Pgm, phosphoglucomutase;
