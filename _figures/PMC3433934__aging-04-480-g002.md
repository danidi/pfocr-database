caption: (A) Diagram of tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent pathway of methionine trans-methylation
  to homocysteine and the trans-sulfuration pathway from homocysteine to glutathione
  (GSH) synthesis. MS, methionine synthase; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAHH, SAH
  hydrolase; GSSG, oxidized glutathione disulfide; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; MTase,
  methyltransferase. (B) Schematic depiction of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis
  through the de novo and salvage pathways. Because the biosynthetic pathways within
  the one-carbon network compete for a limiting pool of folate cofactors and folate-binding
  proteins can serve as “sinks” that sequester specific folates and thereby inhibit
  folate-dependent pathways, metformin-induced sequestration of 5-formimino-THF can
  simultaneously impairs the de novo nucleotide biosynthetic pathway while promoting
  GSH depletion. The conversion of thymidine and hypoxanthine to nucleotides via the
  folate-independent salvage pathway can partially rescue breast cancer cells from
  metformin's toxicity. TK, Thymidylate Kinase; HGPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltrans-ferase.
