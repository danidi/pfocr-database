caption: 'CD95L is a chemoattractant for inflammatory T cells and triple-negative
  breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Left panel: CD95L is expressed by endothelial cells
  in damaged organs in lupus patients and in TNBCs. Cleavage of CD95L by metalloproteases
  releases a soluble form of the ligand. In TNBCs, s-CD95L acts as a chemottractant
  for tumor cells promoting metastasis. Right panel: In chronic inflammatory pathologies
  like systemic lupus erythematosus, s-CD95L enhances the trafficking of Th17 T cells
  in damaged organs through the activation of sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) pathway.
  Infiltrating Th17 cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines. Th17 recruitment can
  be blocked by S1P or CD95 inhibitors.'
