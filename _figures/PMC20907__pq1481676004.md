caption: The biosynthesis of purine nucleoside monophosphates from aminoimidazole
  carboxamide riboside monophosphate. The present pathways are indicated by solid
  arrows. The dotted arrow shows a one-step pathway for the synthesis of GMP, instead
  of the present three-step pathway. A two-step pathway through XMP is also possible.
  The shorter routes would be expected if GMP, or guanine, was used when the pathways
  developed.
