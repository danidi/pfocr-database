caption: Abbreviated fatty acid synthesis pathway. This pathway shows the utilization
  of Acetyl-CoA in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Palmitoleic acid is synthesized
  from palmitate by the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA desaturase. Palmitate can also be elongated
  to form stearate which can then be further elongated to form longer saturated fatty
  acids. The numbers in parentheses next to the names of the fatty acids are lipid
  numbers which have the form C:D, where C is the number of carbon atoms and D is
  the number of double bonds in the fatty acid
