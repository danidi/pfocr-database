caption: Metabolic redistribution in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 upon simultaneous
  blocks to protein and carbohydrate sinks. Protein (amino acids), carbohydrates (mainly
  glycogen), and lipids represent the major metabolic sinks in Synechococcus sp. PCC
  7002. When metabolic flux to glycogen and amino acids were simultaneously blocked,
  through inactivation of ΔglgC and elimination of nitrogen from the culture medium
  (red crosses), a suite of organic acids were secreted from the cell as overflow
  metabolites from central metabolism (red boxes). There is potential to redirect
  these spill-over intermediates toward biotechnologically relevant pathways to increase
  yields of engineered products, such as limonene and α-bisabolene via the terpenoid
  biosynthetic pathway.
