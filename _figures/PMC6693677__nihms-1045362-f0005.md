caption: a | Positive growth signals activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to phosphorylate
  and inactivate RB, whereas negative growth regulators (DNA damage and transforming
  growth factor-β (TGFβ)) augment CDK inhibitors. Inactivation of RB in the canonical
  pathway leads to E2F target gene transcription. b | Non-canonical RB functions are
  best defined by their ambivalence to CDK regulation. Signals that likely activate
  non-canonical RB include stresses that activate p38 MAPK phosphorylation and DNA
  damage that stimulates P300-associated factor (PCAF)-dependent acetylation and SET
  domain-containing protein 8 (SET8; also known as KMT5A) or SET and MYND domain-containing
  protein (SMYD)-dependent methylation. With the aid of recruitment factors (RFs),
  often transcription factor E2F1, RB is capable of maintaining genome stability by
  localizing to sites of DNA breaks and stimulating non-homologous end joining or
  homologous recombination repair in complex with the DNA binding proteins X-ray repair
  cross-complementing protein 5 (XRCC5), XRCC6 or transcription activator BRG1. RB
  also ensures fidelity of DNA replication and chromosome condensation through direct
  interactions with condensin II complexes and the indirect influence of cohesin recruitment.
  Lastly, RB recruits enhancer of zeste homologue 3 (EZH2) to trimethylate histone
  H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and inhibit enhancers to control lineage commitment and
  to silence expression of repetitive sequences. Importantly, this diverse grouping
  of functions is facilitated by the association of RB with the genome over a much
  larger scale than proximal promoters. DP, dimeric partner.
