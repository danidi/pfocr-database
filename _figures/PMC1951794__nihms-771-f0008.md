caption: GnRH up-regulates the expression of its receptor (GnRHR) and COX-2 involved
  in the synthesis of prostaglandins. This is associated with elevated synthesis and
  release of various prostaglandins (PGI2, PGF2α, and PGE2). Prostaglandins (namely
  PGI2 and PGF2α, but not PGE2) limit the effect of GnRH on target cells by down-regulating
  the expression of the GnRHR. Moreover, elevated PGF2αsynthesis (but not PGI2 or
  PGE2) can have diverging effects on the GnRH-induced release of gonadotropins from
  the pituitary, with negative effect on LH release but no effect on FSH release.
