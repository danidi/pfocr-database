caption: Model summarizing the regulation of GR by TTC5. Cellular stress regulates
  the complex formation between GR and TTC5. Through binding to GR, TTC5 stabilizes
  it by preventing the action of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP), possibly
  by preventing the action of the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Upon hormone binding, GR
  translocates to the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements in the
  regulatory regions of its target genes. TTC5 is present at GR regulated promoters
  and can regulate the transcriptional activity of GR, acting as a coactivator or
  corepressor, in a gene-specific manner. Hsps, p300, and JMY have all been shown
  to interact with TTC5 and could regulate GR transcriptional activity. In being sensitive
  to cellular stress, TTC5 can link the response of cells to glucocorticoids with
  cellular stresses, such as heat shock and DNA damage.
