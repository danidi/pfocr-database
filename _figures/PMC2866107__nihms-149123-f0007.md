caption: Coagulation is occurring continuously within the blood stream, but is normally
  restrained by a network of inhibitory pathways involving endothelial proteins such
  as thrombomodulin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (Panel A). Increased
  coagulation is normally initiated when endothelium retracts or becomes “activated”
  by injury, in part because von Willebrand factor (vWF) is expressed and tissue factor
  (TF) is liberated into the circulation. The coagulation cascade then becomes amplified
  by the factors shown (VIIa/TF complex, IXa and Xa) which in turn activate thrombin.
  Thrombin amplifies the clotting cascade by a) activating XIa (not shown), b) activating
  platelets, c) cleaving fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that form the primary clot
  matrix, and d) activating factor XIIIa (not shown), which cross-links fibrin monomers
  into an insoluble clot.TFPI and thrombomodulin normally inhibit coagulation on healthy
  endothelium, while soluble antithrombins inhibit thrombin by forming a complex with
  its active site.Porcine EC activation – whether by xenoantibodies, complement, or
  other factors – results in loss of natural anticoagulant proteins (TFPI, thrombomodulin)
  and acquisition of a procoagulant phenotype (Panel B). In addition functional incompatibilities
  in the coagulation system between pigs and humans cause both inappropriate or accelerated
  thrombin formation and inefficient restraint of clot activation. Our current hypothesis
  is that xenografts succumb to an otherwise insignificant humoral or cellular immune
  response which amplifies endothelial injury and intravascular thrombosis, and becomes
  manifest as TM.Blue arrows designate cascade amplification steps, while red lines
  identify loci of inhibition. The relative intensity of clot formation, the net product
  of coagulation pathway enzyme effects, is symbolized by arrow weight at the thrombin
  and fibrin steps. Pathways where pig endothelial proteins inefficiently dampen coagulation
  are indicated with hatchmarked red lines in Panel B. For simplicity, only the activated
  clotting factor intermediaries and key points at which regulation occurs are shown.
