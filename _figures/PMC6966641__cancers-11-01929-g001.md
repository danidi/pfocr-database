caption: Major pathways involved in muscle loss in cancer cachexia. The ubiquitin-proteasome
  system and autophagy are the major modes of proteolysis in cancer cachexia. Native
  proteins destined to non-lysosomal degradation are polyubiquitylated by E3 ubiquitin
  ligases like MuRF1, MAFbx, and MUSA before being fragmented into smaller peptides
  by the 26S proteasome. Autophagy removes defunct organelles and protein aggregates
  by assembling them into phagophores followed by autophagosome formation. Autolysosomes
  are then formed by fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, which degrade the engulfed
  components. Growth stimulating ligand binds to receptor tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate
  and activate Akt, which consequently triggers mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway to increase rate of protein synthesis and decrease protein degradation.
  SMAD2 and the energy sensor kinase AMPK can also regulate cellular protein level
  by inhibiting Akt and mTOR, respectively. Phosphorylated Akt also prevent the nuclear
  localization of FOXO proteins by phosphorylating them, however, in cachexia, pAkt
  is inhibited resulting in mTOR pathway suppression and nuclear translocation of
  FOXO proteins. FOXO proteins in nucleus trigger transcription of genes encoding
  proteins for autophagy mechanism and atrogenes like MAFbx, MuRF1, and MUSA. Transcription
  of these genes are also promoted by NF-κB and p38 MAPK activated by pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, Toll-like receptor/MyD88, Activin/Activin receptor axis.
