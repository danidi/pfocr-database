caption: Platelets secrete TGFβ1, which activates the TGFβ/Smad pathway in tumor cells.
  Upon direct platelet-tumor cell contact, the NF-κB pathway is also activated in
  tumor cells and synergizes with TGFβ/Smad signaling to induce a rapid EMT, enhance
  invasiveness and promote metastasis. Activation of neither the TGFβ/Smad nor the
  NF-κB pathway alone is sufficient to promote metastasis. Thus, platelet-tumor cell
  contact triggers a synergistic interaction between TGFβ/Smad and NF-κB pathways
  that is necessary for efficient metastasis. The metastatic potential of tumor cells
  therefore continues to evolve outside of the primary tumor site in response to platelet-to-tumor
  cell signaling.
