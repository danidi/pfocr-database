caption: The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and ingenuity pathway analysis
  (IPA). (A) The PPI network, as shown in the confidence view, created by the STRING
  database. DDX3X is controlling hub, and black squares show the protein clusters;
  (B) The IPA predicted signaling pathways transcriptionally regulated through DDX3X;
  and (C) The DDX3X-regulated genes including ESR1, and transcription factor SP1 were
  validated in normal brain tissue and human glioma cell lines. Protein lysates of
  glioma cell lines including LN229, U87MG, GBM8401 and U118MG were applied to SDS-PAGE
  and Western blot analysis to quantitate DDX3X, ESR1, and SP1 protein expression.
  These results are representative of two independent experiments. β-actin served
  as a loading control.
