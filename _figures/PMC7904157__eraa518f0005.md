caption: SlKLUH expression is associated with genes involved in ‘Cutin synthesis and
  transport’ pathway. Schematic overview of the ‘Cutin synthesis and transport’ pathway
  was modified from the ARABIDOPSIS ACYL-LIPID METABOLISM database (http://aralip.plantbiology.msu.edu/pathways/pathways).
  For additional details on genes involved in this pathway, see http://aralip.plantbiology.msu.edu/pathways/cutin_synthesis_transport
  and http://aralip.plantbiology.msu.edu/pathways/cutin_synthesis_transport_2. The
  filled upright and inverted triangles indicate up- and down-regulated DEGs in the
  RNAi-2Q1 line compared with fw3.2(ys), respectively. The open upright triangle indicates
  up-regulated DEGs in fw3.2(wt) compared with fw3.2(ys); red gene ID indicates the
  DEGs shared between the two DEG datasets.
