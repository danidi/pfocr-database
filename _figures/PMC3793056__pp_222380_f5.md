caption: Predictive metabolic pathway of  biosynthesis in M. truncatula seeds. A,
  Sugar contents were analyzed during late seed maturation. Sugar data are means ±
  se of five replications using five seeds. According to their annotations, expression
  profiles of putative enzymes involved in the  pathway are represented. B, Network
  based on correlation between major  sugars and the expression of enzymes involved
  in the  pathway. Red and green lines represent positive and negative correlations,
  respectively. GS, Galactinol synthase; IMP, myoinositol monophosphatase; INV, invertase;
  MIPS, myoinositol phosphate synthase; RAF, raffinose; RFS, raffinose synthase; SPP,
  Suc phosphate phosphatase; SPS, Suc phosphate synthase; STACH, stachyose; STS, stachyose
  synthase; SUC, Suc; VERB, verbascose. Probe sets indicated in boldface are represented
  in the network in B.
