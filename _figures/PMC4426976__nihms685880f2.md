number: Figure 2
caption: This figure shows the dichotomous roles of WNT signalling in the expansion
  and maintenance of potency in stem cells, as well as in the initiation of differentiation
  and lineage commitment. Frizzled and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins
  (LRPs) on the surface of stem cells bind WNTs to regulate the nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin and activation of its transcriptional role in stem cell gene expression
  via recruitment of the kynurenine aminotransferase 3 (KAT3) co-activators CREB-binding
  protein (CBP) or E1A-associated protein p300 (part a). Enzymatic interaction of
  the transmembrane E3 ligases RING finger protein 43 (RNF43) and zinc/RING finger
  protein 3 (ZNRF3) can — through a negative feedback loop — lead to abrogation of
  WNT signalling via endocytosis of the Frizzled–LRP complex (part b). However, when
  R-spondin is present (as in part a) and recruited to leucine-rich repeat-containing
  G protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) and LGR5, RNF43 and ZNRF3 interact with R-spondin,
  resulting in membrane clearance of the complex and the potentiation of WNT signalling.
  WNT signalling is important for proliferation and maintenance of potency as well
  as the differentiation of stem cells.
