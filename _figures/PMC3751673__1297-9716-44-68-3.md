caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of the top-ranked network. The top- ranked network
  is “Humoral Immune Response, Protein Synthesis, Inflammatory Response” with a P-score
  of 48 based on Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base. Analysis used differentially-expressed
  genes from the Affymetrix Gene Array with ≥ 1.5 fold change, p-values of ≤ 0.05
  and a FDR of 0.15. The shape of the nodes indicates the major function of the protein
  expressed by that gene. Red coloured nodes (genes) are up-regulated and the density
  relates to expression levels. Uncoloured nodes represent genes not identified as
  differentially-expressed in the current study. A solid line indicates direct evident
  and a dashed line indirect evidence of interaction. The arrow head show the direction
  of interaction.
