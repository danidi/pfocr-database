caption: Cannonical pro-fibrotic TGFβ signaling is initiated by the binding of active
  TGFβ to TGFβ receptors. Type I receptors phosphorylate receptor-Smads 2 and 3, which
  associate with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus the Smad complex
  interacts with Smad binding elements, promoting gene expression. Among the many
  genes influenced by TGFβ signaling are collagens I and III, α-SMA, fibronectin,
  TIMPs and periostin. Additionally, increased Smad7 expression creates a negative
  feedback loop, limiting pathway activation. The pro-fibrotic roles of periostin
  are summarized here. Via interactions with the ECM and BMP-1, periostin facilitates
  collagen crosslinking through activation of lysyl oxidase. Periostin’s influences
  on cell behaviours include altered proliferation, migration and adhesion. Recent
  evidence suggests that periostin plays a role in liberation of TGFβ from the latency-associated
  proteins in an MMP-2/9 dependent manner
