caption: 'Components whose mRNAs are associated with PUM1 are depicted in yellow,
  those bound by both PUM1 and PUM2 are shown in red. Messages that contain a PUF
  motif are shown with a thick black border. (A) Regulators of angiogenesis. PUM associated
  messages code for the tyrosine kinase receptors fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1),
  which is the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, fibroblast growth factor
  receptor 1 (FGFR1) and EPH receptor B4 (EPHB4) and its ligand ephrin-B1 (EFNB1).
  These receptors and their ligands can trigger signals that induce angiogenesis ,
  , . ARAF (v-raf murine sarcoma 3611 viral oncogene homolog) and MAPK1 (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 1) are part of the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway that can activate ETS (E26
  transformation specific sequence) family transcription factors that promote angiogenesis
  . Human PUM proteins commonly target messages of both canonical (Wnt/ß-catenin)
  and non-canonical (Wnt/calcium signaling and planar cell polarity) pathways: WNT5A
  (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 5A) activates non-canonical
  Wnt signaling , which induces proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro. WNT5A
  is thought to promote the expression of the angiogenic effectors MMP1 (matrix metallopeptidase
  1), and TEK (endothelial TEK tyrosine kinase, TIE-2) . PUM1 and PUM2 commonly target
  components of the “ß-catenin destruction complex” consisting of the serine/threonine
  kinase GSK3A (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha), which phosphorylates ß-catenin
  marking the protein for ubiquitylation and rapid degradation by the proteasome,
  the tumor suppressor APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), and the scaffold protein
  AXIN1. PUM1 further associates with mRNAs coding for the co-factors TCF/LEF1 (transcription
  factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1) that become activated when ß-catenin
  enters the nucleus. This includes TCF4 and TCF7L27 (transcription factors 4 and
  7-like 2), that stimulate the transcription of genes implicated in cell growth regulation
  . (B) Activators and effectors of RAS , . PUM bound messages code for EGFR (epidermal
  growth factor receptor), adaptor proteins GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2) and SHC1 (Src homology 2 domain containing transforming protein 1), which activate
  Ras proteins upon recruitment of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS (son
  of sevenless). RAS interacts specifically with ARAF, MAP3K1 (mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase 1), PIK3CB (phoshoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, beta polypeptide)
  and TIAM2 (T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 2), which can initiate cascades
  of protein-protein interactions and further activate more specific signaling pathways.
  Components of the Raf/MEK/ERK and the MEKK/SEK/JNK pathways are covered by PUM1
  targets encoding mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK1 and MAPKAPK5 (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase-activated protein kinase 5), and RPS6AK3 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase,
  polypeptide 3). These pathways target the transcription factors JUN (jun oncogene),
  ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2) and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator
  of transcription), which commonly induce cell proliferation . The PI3K-mediated
  (PIK3CB) signal is further triggered by activation of protein kinase B (AKT1, v-akt
  murine thymoma viral homolog 1) and phosphorylates GSK3A. PUM1 also targets effectors
  downstream of TIAM such as the GTP-binding protein RAC1 (ras-related C3 botulinum
  toxin substrate 1) and the Ras homologs gene family members B, F and J (RHOB, RHOF,
  RHOJ), which are all components of the TIAM/RAC/RHO signaling pathway implicated
  in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . The RAC effector PAK2 (p21 protein-
  activated kinase 2) is involved in cell migration and invasion , and EXOC2 (exocyst
  complex component 2) induces vescicle trafficking upon RAL (Ras-related) activation
