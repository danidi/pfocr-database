caption: Tyrosine is degraded via a five-step metabolic pathway. Shown are the chemical
  structures of the intermediates and enzymes involved in catalyzing each step. Also
  indicated are the locations of the tatn-1(baf1) and hpd-1(ok1955) mutations and
  fah-1(RNAi) used to manipulate levels of the reactive metabolites maleylacetoacetate
  and fumarylacetoacetate.
