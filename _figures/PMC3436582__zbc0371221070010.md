caption: Model of Ang-II signaling to the endothelial cytoskeleton via MARCKS and
  H2O2. This scheme shows that the Ang-II-dependent activation of the AT1R receptor
  in vascular endothelila cells leads to Rac1 activation and to increased levels of
  H2O2, both of which are required for MARCKS phosphorylation and cytoskeleton responses.
  The AT1R blocker losartan blocks downstream Ang-II-stimulated signaling responses.
  siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rac1 attenuates Ang-II-stimulated MARCKS phosphorylation
  and translocation, as does the enzymatic degradation of H2O2 after PEG-catalase
  treatment. MARCKS phosphorylation leads to increased levels of free PIP2 and to
  the translocation of phospho-MARCKS from the membrane to internal sites, where phosphorylated
  MARCKS binds actin and promotes formation of adhesion complexes containing vinculin.
  siRNA-mediated knockdown of cAbl attenuates MARCKS phosphorylation, implicating
  this protein kinase in the pathway modulating MARCKS phosphorylation. Conversely,
  siRNA-mediated knockdown of MARCKS leads to an attenuation of c-Abl phosphorylation,
  suggesting reciprocal regulatory interactions between these two signaling proteins.
  Taken together, these observations help to establish a central role for MARCKS in
  Ang-II signaling in the vascular endothelium.
