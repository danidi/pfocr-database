caption: Regulation of ER-stress by p38 and tumor dormancy. (A) Simplified overview
  of pathways of the UPR relevant to this review. ER-stress induces dissociation of
  BiP from PERK and IRE1 and their subsequent activation via trans-phosphorylation.
  IRE1 activation leads to the noncanonical splicing of XBP-1 mRNA, causing a frame-shift
  in the ORF resulting in a potent transcription factor. Active PERK phosphorylates
  eIF2α on Ser 51, inhibiting translation and causing G0/G1 arrest. Preferential translation
  of ATF4 mRNA by phospho-eIF2α also induces (along with XBP1) the expression of UPR
  genes. P = phospho-group. ERSE = ER stress response element. Dephosphorylation of
  eIF2α by GADD34-PP1 restores translation. (B) Activation of p38 signaling in HEp3
  cells regulates a program that favors growth arrest and survival through the activation
  of an ER stress response. While p38-dependent activation of PERK-eIF2α pathway coordinates
  both growth arrest and survival signaling, upregulation of BiP expression inhibits
  Bax activation and promotes survival and drug resistance in dormant cells without
  affecting the dormancy of the tumor cells.
