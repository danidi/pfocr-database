caption: LCAT functions potentially affecting the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.
  LCAT is considered an important driving force behind the RCT pathway, a process
  that describes the HDL-mediated removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues,
  including macrophages in the arterial wall, and subsequent delivery to the liver
  for biliary excretion. Upon association of cholesterol with ndHDL particles, it
  is esterified by LCAT, leading to partitioning of the cholesterol esters into the
  core of the particle and conversion of the ndHDL into mature HDL3 or HDL2 particles.
  Upon esterification of cholesterol in HDL, LCAT maintains the gradient of free cholesterol
  between the cellular membrane and the surface of the HDL particle, which is thought
  to generate a continuous flow of cholesterol from the cell to lipoproteins and prevent
  the transfer of cholesterol back to the cell. In addition to its essential role
  in the first step of the RCT pathway, LCAT is suggested to enhance the delivery
  of cholesterol to the liver. Furthermore, LCAT directly or indirectly interferes
  with several other physiological processes that might affect the development of
  atherosclerosis, including HDL antioxidant function by hydrolyzing oxidized phospholipids
  in oxidized LDL (oxLDL), adrenal steroidogenesis, insulin sensitivity and protection
  against obesity, and platelet function.
