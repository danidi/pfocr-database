caption: Proposed ACE2/ANG-(1–7)/Mas signaling pathways in the central nervous system.
  ANG II is produced by ACE from ANG I and cleaved by ACE2 to form ANG-(1–7). ANG
  II binding to AT1 receptors activate MAPK kinase, p38, Erk1/2, and this effect can
  be attenuated by ANG-(1–7) activation of the Mas receptor. STAT3 can be stimulated
  by both ANG II and ANG-(1–7). Following activation by the Mas receptor, Src homology
  2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) inhibits MAP kinases activity.
  Kinases and phosphatases signaling exert a mutual inhibitory effect on each other.
  In the central nervous system, kinase activity determines neuronal firing, norepinephrine
  (NE) release, and sympathetic outflow. AT1 receptor-mediated activation of NADPH
  oxidase leads to the formation of superoxide (O2·−) acting with nitric oxide (NO)
  to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). NO release can result from the activation of both
  Mas and B2 receptors via Akt phosphorylation (pAkt). Several agonists (green arrows)
  and antagonists (red lines) have been developed for the various components of this
  system. ARB, angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker; MLN-4760, antagonist GL-1001;
  NAAE, N-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridine-ethanamine; XNT, xanthenone; DIZE, diminazene
  aceturate; CGEN-856 and CGEN-857, agonists of the Mas receptor; BK, large-conductance
  Ca2+-activated K+ channel; NOS, nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Solid arrows, stimulation
  pathways; dashed lines, inhibitory pathways.
