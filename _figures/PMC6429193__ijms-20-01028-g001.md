caption: 'The JAK2-STAT5-SOCS pathway and domain structure of STAT5. (a) Upon cytokine
  binding to respective cytokine receptor chain(s), a conformational change in the
  transmembrane domain triggers activation of associated Janus kinase (JAK) kinases
  that bind to the BOX1 and BOX2 membrane proximal motifs. Subsequently, antiparallel
  STAT5 dimers are efficiently recruited and JAK dimers then activate STAT5 by tyrosine
  phosphorylation. STAT5 then undergoes a drastic conformational change to form parallel
  dimers. Furthermore, serine/threonine phosphorylation of STAT family members triggers
  shuttling in and out of the nucleus as well as transcriptional elongation. STATs
  are usually inactivated by tyrosine phosphatases, which are much more highly expressed
  than the rate limiting JAK kinases. In contrast, inhibition of cytokine receptor
  and JAK kinase signaling is executed via ubiquitination by SOCS family members,
  downstream targets of STATs that provide negative feedback control. JAK2 glycosylation
  is also observed (our unpublished data). (b) The STAT5A domain structure is schematically
  illustrated with the O-GlcNAc modification depicted at T92 (indicated by asterisk)
  within an ATQL motif (highlighted in black) in the N-domain. STATs consist of six
  domains: N-terminal domain (blue), coiled coil domain (purple), DNA binding domain
  (green), linker domain (orange), SH2 domain (yellow) and transcriptional activation/stability
  domain (red) [,,]. Reported phosphorylation sites and respective kinases are also
  shown. OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; OGA, O-GlcNAcase.'
