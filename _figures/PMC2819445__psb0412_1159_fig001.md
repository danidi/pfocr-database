caption: Overview of male gametophyte development in arabidopsis (a) and model of
  germ cell cycle progression and specification in the male germline (B). (A) Schematic
  of the distinct morphological stages of male gametophyte development in arabidopsis.
  Diploid pollen mother cells undergo meiotic division to produce a tetrad of haploid
  microspores. the released microspores undergo a highly asymmetric division to produce
  a bicellular pollen grain with a small germ cell engulfed within the cytoplasm of
  a large vegetative cell. Whilst the vegetative cell exits the cell cycle, the germ
  cell undergoes a further mitotic division to produce twin sperm cells. (B) a schematic
  model integrating the control of cell proliferation and sperm cell specification
  in male germline development of arabidopsis. after microspore division, the cell
  cycle inhibitors KrP6 and KrP7 are present in the newly formed germ cell. transient
  expression of FBL17 leads to the degradation of these KRPs, allowing CDKA/CYCD to
  phosphorylate RBR, thereby relieving RBR-mediated repression of the E2F/DP pathway
  and progression of the germ cell through S-phase. Gamete specification begins shortly
  after germ cell division, where the co-expression of DUO1 and DUO3 in the germ cell
  leads to the activation of common and distinct germline differentiation genes. Once
  S-phase is complete, the DuO1-dependent activation of the G2/m phase regulator CYCB1;1
  promotes germ cell cycle progression and entry into mitosis. In parallel, DUO3 also
  controls G2/m transition, by an unknown mechanism that acts independently of cYcB1;1
  expression. DUO1 and DUO3 therefore integrate germline differentiation with cell
  cycle progression. Ultimately, the cooperation of these parallel pathways results
  in a pair of fully differentiated sperm cells equipped with a complement of essential
  germline factors such as GcS1 that are required for successful gamete fusion.
