caption: 'Intercellular lactate exchange in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The
  TME is a complex ultrastructure containing different cell types, including tumor
  cells, stromal cells, immune cells, blood vessels and cellular metabolites such
  as lactate. Oxidative tumor cells (orange nuclei) and stromal cells (gray cytoplasm)
  are supported by a favorable location with high nutritional and O2 availability.
  Oxidative tumor cells (orange nuclei) express MCT1 transporter which preferentially
  promotes lactate import. The glycolytic tumor cells (pink nuclei) produce lactate
  by the glycolytic pathway that culminates in the final reaction mediated by lactate
  dehydrogenase LDHA, and exhibit high expression of MCT4 favoring lactate export.
  Lactate can be used as an energetic source through its conversion to pyruvate via
  LDHB and then go to into the Krebs cycle for energy generation. Thus, the glycolytic
  tumor cell (pink nuclei), and stromal cell (gray) interchange of lactate with oxidative
  tumor cells (orange nuclei) increases tumor cell survival and proliferation. CD147:
