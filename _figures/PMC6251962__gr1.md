caption: 'Innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity (green): Pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs), lipopolysacharides (LPS) and bacteria act as stimuli
  to Toll like receptors (eg. TLR9, TLR2) resulting in increased reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), inflammation, and decreased sinonasal epithelial barrier function. Damage
  associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) directly stimulate the release of cytokines
  (IL-25, IL-33, TSLP) leading to Th2 activation. Taste receptor T2R38 has also been
  shown to be stimulated by LPS and in turn creates a nitrous oxide dependent immune
  response. Adaptive immunity (red): Activation of the Th2 pathway via IL-4, IL-5
  and IL-13 results in increased epithelial barrier permeability in part through down
  regulation of tight junction proteins. An IgE mediated immune response results in
  mast cell degranulation.'
