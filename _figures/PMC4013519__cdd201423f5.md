caption: cdc-42 regulates engulfment in response to PAT-2/CED-1–UIG-1 signaling. Genetic
  model of cell corpse clearance in C. elegans. cdc-42 acts downstream of pat-2/3,
  downstream of or in parallel to the ced-1/6/7 pathway. See text for details. Components
  involved in phagosome maturation are not shown. GTPases, GEFs and GAP are shown
  in gray, orange and blue boxes, respectively. Dashed arrows indicate potential regulation
