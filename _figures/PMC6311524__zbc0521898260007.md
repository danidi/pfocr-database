caption: 'Proposed model. Three primary sources of the mitochondrial dTMP pool are
  shown. Red, source 1: salvage dTMP synthesis using dT from cytosolic and mitochondrial
  pools. Salvage synthesis of dTMP is independent of folate status; it relies on TK2
  activity to convert dT to dTMP. Mitochondrial pyrimidine nucleotide transporter
  PNC1 facilitates the import of dT from cytosolic pools. Blue, source 2: de novo
  dTMP synthesis using dUMP from mitochondrial and cytosolic pools. Cytosolic dUMP
  is imported into the mitochondria via PNC2, where it participates in folate-dependent
  de novo dTMP biosynthesis. Purple, source 3: transport dTMP from cytosolic pools,
  to be incorporated into the mitochondrial dTMP pool. dTMP synthesized in the cytosol
  via the salvage pathway or de novo pathway is imported into the mitochondria to
  help sustain mtDNA synthesis; the mitochondrial import of synthesized dTMP is perturbed
  under MPV17-deficient conditions.'
