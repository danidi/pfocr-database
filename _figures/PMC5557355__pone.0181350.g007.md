caption: Coarse hypothetical scheme of the Engrailed signaling pathway in the normal
  and autistic brain. Engrailed proteins are known to be mainly expressed by GABA
  neuronal cells [], and to signal between cells upon secretion (reviewed in []).
  In normal conditions (black lines), low levels of endogenous secreted En1 (from
  GABA cell for instance) could participate to dendritogenesis (1), spinogenesis (2)
  (insert), and mTOR signaling (3) in neighbor glutamatergic neurons. In a pathological
  context, such as autism (red lines), a rise of En2 expression and secretion would
  generate additional effects, i.e. the increase in dendritic complexity of GABA cells
  (4), a decrease of clustered PSD95 (5), and the mispairing of glutamatergic synapses
  (6) (insert). Engrailed proteins require cellular internalization to be active,
  but functional priming at the cell membrane through an uncharacterized protein “R”
  is not excluded.
