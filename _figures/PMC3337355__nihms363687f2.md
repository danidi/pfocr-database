caption: RUNX3 integrates with various cellular signaling pathways for its tumor suppressor
  activity. (A) RUNX3 suppresses ERα signaling in breast cancer. Binding of RUNX3
  to ERα induces the ubiquitination and degradation of ERα by an unidentified E3 ligase
  (X). The low levels of ERα maintain the normal growth of mammary epithelial cells.
  When RUNX3 is inactivated, the cellular levels of ERα are enhanced, leading to the
  enhanced response to estradiol (E2), the hyperproliferation of breast cells, and
  eventually the formation of breast cancer. (B) RUNX3 could either act as a downstream
  target of a tumor suppressor pathway (e.g, TGF-β signaling) or function as a suppressor
  in an oncogenic pathway (e.g., Wnt signaling) to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis,
  and cell migration. By interacting with various signaling pathways, RUNX3 might
  also have a role in breast cancer carcinogenesis by regulating the EMT and breast
  cancer stem cell development.
