caption: A proposed model of keloid disorder showing embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like
  cells within keloid-associated lymphoid tissues (KALTs), regulated by a microenvironmental
  niche with resultant proliferation and accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts
  in the keloid lesion (KL) via a mesenchymal stem cell intermediate through an endothelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (endo-MT). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in
  the microenvironmental niche with complex interactions with the immune system/inflammation,
  vitamin D, vitamin D deficiency (VDD), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and hypertension.
  VDD which is caused by reduced sunlight/UVB radiation, and leads to increased RAS
  activity and the resultant hypertension. VDD also directly leads to hypertension.
  Increased RAS activity also activates the immune system. The complex interactions
  between these elements lead to activation of various pro-fibrotic signaling pathways
  leading to generation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Hypertension has a direct
  pro-fibrotic effect and contributes to the conducive microenvironment for the ESC-like
  cells within the KALTs. VDD increases RAS activity, with activation of the immune
  system/inflammation leading to an altered microenvironmental niche via the IL-6
  and IL-17 axis. This increased RAS activity activates TGF-β/Smad signaling to promote
  EndoMT. Binding of vitamin D to VDR results in a genomic effect which counteracts
  the profibrotic signaling pathways. VDR transcriptional activity inhibits keloid
  fibroblast proliferation. VDR transcriptional activity also inhibits the pro-fibrotic
  TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, down-regulates genes for EndoMT, and so may influence
  the formation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts within KLs. ECM, extracellular matrix;
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; MMP-1, matrix metalloproteinase-1; TIMP-1,
  tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1; IL, interleukin; UVB, ultraviolet B; VEGF,
  vascular endothelial growth factor. “+” signifies a positive effect; “−” signifies
  a negative effect.

  description: A proposed model of keloid disorder showing embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like

    VDD also directly leads to hypertension. Increased RAS activity also activates

    of various pro-fibrotic signaling pathways leading to generation of fibroblasts

    RAS activity activates TGF-β/Smad signaling to promote EndoMT. Binding of vitamin
    D to VDR results in a genomic effect which counteracts the profibrotic signaling
    pathways. VDR transcriptional activity inhibits keloid fibroblast proliferation.
    VDR transcriptional activity also inhibits the pro-fibrotic TGF-β/Smad signaling
