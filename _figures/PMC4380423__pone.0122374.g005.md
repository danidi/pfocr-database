caption: The relationships between the biological functions and cytokines/chemokines
  of (A) DC+TCL+Cp, (B) DC+TCL+Am, (C) DC+TCL+[Am+Cp] and (D) DC+TCL+LPS were analyzed
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. The cytokine/chemokine expression
  was determined by specific cytokine array (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and the
  expression levels that were altered more than two-fold in TCL groups were used in
  an IPA study. The signaling hubs (functions) include the differentiation of lymphocytes
  and dendritic cells, proliferation of helper T cells and monocytes, recruitment
  of phagocytes, chemotaxis of lymphocytes and inhibition of tumor growth.
