caption: Notch receptors have an extracellular domain comprising a variable number
  of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (36 for Notch1-2, 34 for Notch3 and
  29 for Notch4) and three Lin-12 Notch repeats (LNR). Ligand binding triggers sequential
  receptor cleavages involving ADAM family metalloproteases and the γ-secretase complex,
  ultimately leading to the cytoplasmic release of the intracellular domain (NICD).
  This comprises a RAM domain, six ankyrin repeats between two nuclear localization
  sequences (NLS) and a transactivation domain. A PEST sequence is also present at
  the C-terminus of all four Notch receptors, with a transactivation domain present
  in Notch1-2. After cytoplasmic release, this intracellular domain translocates into
  the nucleus where it exerts its transcriptional activity. Both Delta-like and Jagged
  ligands comprise of Delta-serrate-Lag2 (DSL) domains followed by a variable number
  of EGF-like repeats (8 for Delta-like1 and 4, and 6 for Delta-like3), with an additional
  cysteine-rich domain present in Jagged ligands. The Jagged ligands both have 18
  EGF-like repeats.
