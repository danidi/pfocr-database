caption: BS and M chloroplast distribution of proteins involved in primary carbon
  metabolism. Proteins include the Calvin cycle and photorespiration, the OPP pathway,
  proteins leading up to starch synthesis, the malate shuttle, as well as C3 homologues
  of malate shuttle proteins (PPDK and MDH). Tentative transporters are indicated,
  and assignment is based on . BS-M bar diagrams and color coding are as described
  in the legend to . Relative accumulation levels (based on nSAF) of proteins averaged
  across BS and M chloroplasts are shown as colored squares, with the scale indicated.
  Abbreviations are explained in the text and in Supplemental Table S3.
