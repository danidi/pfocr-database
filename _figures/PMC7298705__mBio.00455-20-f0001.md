caption: Fumonisin (FUM) biosynthetic gene cluster, and proposed biosynthetic pathway
  toward fumonisin B1 (FB1). Genes encoding FB1biosynthetic enzymes are depicted in
  black. FUM21 (white) encodes the cluster-specific transcription factor, while the
  coregulated cluster genes FUM15 to FUM19 (gray) do not participate in FB1 biosynthesis.
