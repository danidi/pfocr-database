caption: Proposed mechanism of Th1 cell polarization by inhalation of allergen contaminated
  with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). At high levels, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces
  IFN-γ production by airway structural cells, such as epithelial cells, macrophages
  or NK cells. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) uptake allergens, and then migrate to
  draining lymph nodes (DLN). During allergen uptake by DC, IFN-γ, produced in response
  to high-level LPS, induces DC maturation, expression of costimulatory molecules,
  and upregulation of DC IL-12 expression. In DLN, mature DCs induce proliferation
  of naïve T cells (T cell priming), which subsequently differentiate into Th1 cells,
  via IL-12 and the STAT4 signaling pathway.
