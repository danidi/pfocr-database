caption: 'Liver autophagy and hyperammonemia. In hepatocytes under normal conditions
  (left): i) MTORC1, involved in a major signaling pathway controlling autophagy,
  is regulated by various signals including growth factors, energy and nutrients such
  as amino acids (AA) and alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG); and ii) ammonia (NH +) is cleared
  by synthesis of urea through the urea cycle and glutamine (Gln) by GLUL/glutamine
  synthetase. During hyperammonemia (right), ammonia-induced depletion of a-KG and
  its consequent inhibition of MTORC1 induce autophagy. Metabolite recycling induced
  by increased autophagy makes ammonia removal more efﬁcient because it stimulates
  ureagenesis by furnishing key urea cycle intermediates (aspartate [Asp] and glutamate
  [Glu]), acetyl-coA, and ATP. Autophagy enhancement by gene transfer of Tfeb or treatments
  with the autophagy enhancers rapamycin (Rapa) and Tat-beclin 1 (TB-1), increases
  ureagenesis and can be exploited to reduce hyperammonemia.'
