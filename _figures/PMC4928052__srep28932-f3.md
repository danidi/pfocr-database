caption: 'The gene with the highest average intensity was selected as the representative
  of each pathway. The data are presented as relative mean levels ± SD (N = 95 in
  each group), where the levels in the normal tissues were set to 1. The statistical
  significance of the differences between measurements in the cancerous and normal
  tissues was assessed using a paired Student’s t-test with FDR adjustment as follows:
  ***P < 0.001; NS, not statistically significant. The abbreviations are defined in  and
