caption: Biosynthetic reactions targeted during the construction of E. coli strains
  KPM318 and KPM404. The late acyltransferases LpxL and LpxM of the constitutive pathway
  transfer laurate and myristate, respectively, to Kdo2-lipid IVA to form the characteristic
  acyloxyacyl units of hexaacylated Kdo2-lipid A. In contrast, LpxP, PagP and EptA
  are regulated in response to certain stimuli such as incorporation of palmitoleate
  in place of laurate by LpxP at low growth temperatures or PagP-catalyzed palmitoylation
  of lipid A upon phospholipid translocation to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane,
  for example, in strains defective in LPS biosynthesis. The acyl-acyl carrier protein
  (ACP) serves as the preferred acyl donor for various lipid A-acyltransferases.
