caption: 'Role of TRAFs in the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways.
  NF-κB can be activated via the canonical or non-canonical signaling pathways. The
  canonical pathway is controlled by TAK1 kinase activation, which activates the IKK
  complex and leads to ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of IκB family members,
  resulting in the release and nuclear translocation of NF-kB1/p50–RelA/p65 and NF-κB1/p50–c-Rel
  dimers. RelA/p65 is dispensable for TFH differentiation but c-Rel regulates the
  expression of IL-21 and CD40L and is required for TFH differentiation. TRAF2 and−6
  favor IKK complex activation by TAK1 and TRAF1 and−5 are required for optimal IκB
  degradation. The activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway depends on the NF-κB-inducing
  kinase NIK. NIK can phosphorylate and activate IKKα, which in turn promotes p100
  processing to generate NF-κB2/p52 and allows nuclear translocation of NF-κB2/p52
  and RelB. In the absence of activating signals, constitutive ubiquitylation and
  degradation of NIK ensures repression of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. NIK deficiency
  in T cells does not impact TFH differentiation. TRAFs regulate the non-canonical
  NF-κB pathway by modulating NIK expression levels: TRAF6 is involved in transcriptional
  regulation of Nik whereas TRAF2 and−3 contribute to its degradation. TRAF1 restrains
  the non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation by inhibiting p100 processing.'

  description: 'Role of TRAFs in the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways.
    NF-κB can be activated via the canonical or non-canonical signaling pathways.
    The canonical pathway is controlled by TAK1 kinase activation, which activates
    the IKK complex and leads to ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of IκB
    family members, resulting in the release and nuclear translocation of NF-kB1/p50–RelA/p65

    c-Rel regulates the expression of IL-21 and CD40L and is required for TFH differentiation.
    TRAF2 and−6 favor IKK complex activation by TAK1 and TRAF1 and−5 are required
    for optimal IκB degradation. The activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway
    depends on the NF-κB-inducing kinase NIK. NIK can phosphorylate and activate IKKα,

    TRAFs regulate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway by modulating NIK expression levels:
    TRAF6 is involved in transcriptional regulation of Nik whereas TRAF2 and−3 contribute
    to its degradation. TRAF1 restrains the non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation
