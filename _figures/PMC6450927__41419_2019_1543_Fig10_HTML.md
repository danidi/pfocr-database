caption: a Direct effects. Lico A could induce autophagy activation and Nrf2 upregulation
  to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress through the inhibition of Txnip-NLRP3
  as well as TLR4-NF-κB and -MAPK signaling pathway activation, which improves LPS/GlaN-caused
  by ALI. b Compensatory effects. Knockout of Nrf2 may promote compensatory effects
  of autophagy activation which reduces the sensitivity of mice to LPS/GlaN; and strengthen
  Lico A-induced autophagy activation which enhances the ability of Lico A to protect
  liver injury in Nrf2−/− mice
