caption: Irinotecan is a prodrug that, after administration, is activated in liver
  by the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by carboxylesterases (CES1, CES2) of the microsomal
  system of hepatocytes, with the release of the more active metabolite SN-38. In
  cancer cell nuclei, SN-38 acts as inhibitor of the topoisomerase I, a key enzyme
  in DNA replication. The SN-38/enzyme/DNA complex causes major breaks in the DNA
  replication fork, with subsequent activation of cancer cells apoptosis. In liver
  cells, irinotecan and SN-38 may be oxidated by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP 3A4
  and 3A5) to form pharmacologically inactive metabolites (NPC, APC). The Uridine
  diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) catalyzes the subsequent conjugation
  reaction of SN-38 with glucuronic acid making its excretion possible through the
  bile in the intestinal lumen. Adenosine-triphosphate binding cassettes (ABC) transporters
  (ABCB1/ABCB2) are transmembrane proteins which make possible the absorption of SN-38
  from plasma into hepatocytes and hence in interstitial and the excretion of irinotecan
  and its metabolites by bile into the intestinal lumen. An increased bioavailability
  of SN-38, i.e. for the reduced efficiency of UGT and CYP 3A4/3A5 reactions, seems
  to justify the onset of diarrhea and neutropenia as specific side effects of chemotherapy.
  CES – carboxylesterases; CYP - cytochrome P-450; UGT - uridine diphosphate (UDP)
  glucuronosyltransferases; ABC - adenosine-triphosphate binding cassettes.
