caption: IDO- and cell-mediated immunosuppression. Tryptophan is an essential amino
  acid that is catalyzed by the IDO enzyme into kynurenine. The kynurenine pathway
  is immunosuppressive in nature because the catabolites have inhibitory effects on
  lymphocytes, and the depletion of tryptophan leads to T cell cycle arrest and reduced
  proliferation. PD-1 and CTLA-4 are immune checkpoint molecules expressed on T cells,
  which also negatively regulate T cell immunity upon recognition of their cognate
  ligands on antigen-presenting cells. D-1-MT is an inhibitor of the IDO enzyme.
