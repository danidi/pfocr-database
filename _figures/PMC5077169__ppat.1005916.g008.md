caption: HTLV-1-infected T-cells express the transactivator Tax that upregulates Fascin
  expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Not only Tax-induced Fascin, but also
  endogenous (endog.) Fascin is required for virus release and cell-to-cell transmission.
  Beyond, adhesion of infected cells occurs Fascin-dependently, which may favor dissemination
  of infected cells in vivo. Functionally, Fascin makes room for gag clusters reminiscent
  of viral biofilms at the virological synapse (VS) and Fascin-containing short-distance
  membrane extensions clutch uninfected T-cells. Additionally, Fascin localizes with
  gag in long-distance connections between chronically infected and newly infected
  T-cells. A “mini VS” may be shaped at the tip of the long-distance connection towards
  the target cell. Overall, Fascin seems to be important for the transport of viral
  proteins to foster polarized budding, virus release and cell-to-cell transmission
  of HTLV-1.
