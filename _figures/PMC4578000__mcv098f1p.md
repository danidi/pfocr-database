caption: Signalling role of H2O2 in the seed germination process. During the process
  of germination, H2O2 triggers seed storage protein carbonylation (PCB) that induces
  the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) which supplements NADPH to thioredoxin
  (TRX) for seed germination. Furthermore, it stimulates an increase in GAs and a
  decrease of abscisic acid (ABA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)
  through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (; ; ; , ; ; ). Upon mobilization
  of reserves, seed germination takes place with resurgence of metabolism. For dormancy
  alleviation, the ABA content should be high to maintain the dormant state after
  fruit ripening and, in the non-dormant state, GAs could be high, leading to germination
  ().
