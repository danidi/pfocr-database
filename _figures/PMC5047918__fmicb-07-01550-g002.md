caption: A simplified view of B. cereus central metabolism. This schematic shows our
  current understanding of how glycolysis (blue), the PPP (purple), the fermentation
  pathways (red), the TCA cycle (green) and aerobic respiratory chain (brown) are
  interconnected in growing B. cereus cells. The fermentation end products are shown
  in bold. The electron transport in the respiratory chain goes through dehydrogenation
  of NADH, as a first step. Electrons are transferred from NADH to menaquinone pool
  (Q), which serves as an electron carrier, and then, the pathway goes through two
  main branches. The first is one in which electrons go through the bc complex, cytochrome
  c and cytochrome oxidase caa3, in turn. The second contains only quinol oxidases
  (cytochromes bd or aa3). In each branch, electrons are finally accepted by oxygen
  molecules. The transfer of electrons is coupled to the formation of a proton gradient
  across the membrane which is tapped by F1F0-ATPase to generate ATP from ADP and
  Pi. ROS are generated as by-product from this process. Ldh, lactate dehydrogenase;
  Pdh, pyruvate dehydrogenase; Pfl, pyruvate formate lyase; NDH, NADH:menaquinone
  reductase; SDH, succinate:menaquinone oxidoreductase; GDH, glycerol-3-P:menaquinone
  reductase.
