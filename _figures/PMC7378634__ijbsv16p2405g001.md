caption: Cellular sources and effects of IL-22. IL-22 is produced mainly by cells
  of the hematopoietic system. During steady-state, ILC3 are the main producers of
  IL-22 in the mucosae of the large and the small intestine. During infections, Th1/Th17/Th22
  cells will expand and produce amounts of IL-22. In addition, γδT cells and NKT cells
  have also been shown to capable of producing IL-22. Some reports have also found
  that neutrophils produce IL-22. IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines,
  all of which share common features in their receptors. Functional IL-22R is a heterodimer
  composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2. Each of these receptors signals through the Jak1/Tyk2-STAT
  pathway, although there is evidence that IL-22 can also signal through MAPK and
  p38 pathways. (ILC, innate lymphoid cell; Th, T helper cell; NKT, natural killer
  T cell; IL, interleukin; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases).
