caption: The role of MMP-3 in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. Emerging evidence
  suggests that MMP-3 plays a key role in dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Under
  stress conditions, MMP-3 is induced in dopaminergic neurons generating proMMP-3.
  Activation of MMP-3 might be achieved in cytoplasm as well as extracellular space.
  Catalytically active MMP-3 (actMMP-3) triggers microglial activation resulting in
  release of proinflammatory cytokine such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6. Microglial substrates
  for act MMP-3 and signaling event leading to microglial activation are yet to be
  elucidated. NADPH oxidase (NOX2)-mediated ROS generation was also observed in microglia
  treated with actMMP-3. In addition, MMP-3 could be also activated intracellularly
  by unknown serine proteases upon stress such as 6-OHDA or MPP+, a selective dopaminergic
  toxin. Activated MMP-3 could cleave α-synuclein into several fragments by C-terminal
  truncation. These fragmented peptides are prone to aggregate and result in increased
  cytotoxicity. MMP-3 could also degrade DJ-1 and impair its antioxidant function
  resulting in increased oxidative stress. Intracellular actMMP-3 is directly linked
  apoptotic pathway in dopaminergic cells as well.
