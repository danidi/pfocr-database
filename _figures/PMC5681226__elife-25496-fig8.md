caption: The PSC is drawn in grey. Wasp parasitism increases ROS in PSC cells that
  activate Toll/NF-κB and Spitz secretion (sSpi). Toll/NF-kB activation in PSC cells
  requires SPE in the same cells for Spätzle processing (c-Spz). sSpi non cell-autonomously
  activates the EGFR pathway in lymph gland progenitors. Both EGFR and Toll/NF-κB
  activation are required for lymph gland lamellocyte differentiation, lymph gland
  disruption and wasp egg encapsulation.
