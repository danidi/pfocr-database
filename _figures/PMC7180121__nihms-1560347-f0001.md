caption: 'Metabolic interrelationships in SSADH Deficiency. Shown are the GABA catabolic
  pathway, GABA shunt, fatty acid metabolism, and the Krebs cycle. Abbreviations:
  4-GBA, 4-guanidinobutyric acid; L-Arg, L-arginine; L-His, L-histidine; Gln, L-glutamine;
  L-Gly, L-glycine; Guac, guanidinoacetic acid; GABA, 4-aminobutyric acid; GHB, γ-hydroxybutyric
  acid; SSA, succinic semialdehyde; D-2-HG, D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid; α-KG, α-ketoglutaric
  acid (or 2-oxoglutaric acid); 4,5-DHHA, 4,5 dihydroxyhexanoic acid. Enzyme abbreviations:
  GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase; GABA-T, GABA-transaminase (also aminobutyrate
  aminotransferase); AKR, aldo-keto reductase; SSADH, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  (the site of the block in patients with SSADHD, indicated by the cross-hatched box);
  TH, D-2-hydroxyglutarate transhydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex;
  LCFA, MCFA and SCFA, representing long-chain, medium-chain and short-chain fatty
  acids, respectively. The reaction normally catalyzing the conversion of L-glycine
  and L-arginine to guanidinoacetic acid is catalyzed by arginine:glycine amidinotransferase,
  the first step of creatine and creatinine formation. When elevated, GABA is postulated
  to interfere with this reaction, replacing L-glycine with GABA to yield 4-GBA. Potential
  interference of β-oxidation by SSA or GHB is shown by T-bars. The site of entry
  of amino acids shown to be dysregulated in the current study (aspartic acid, glutamine,
  serine, lysine, methionine, valine, isoleucine) into the Kreb cycle is also shown,
  as well as their relative alterations compared to control tissues (upward arrows,
  elevated; downward arrows, decreased). Directional arrows (upward) also show elevations
  for GABA-related intermediates as well as guanidinoacetic acid. A question mark
  next to the latter indicates a paradoxical finding in view of the elevation of 4-GBA'
