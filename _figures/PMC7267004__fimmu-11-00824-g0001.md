caption: Phagocytic receptors and modulating factors functioning in the phagocytosis
  as well as the antigen-presenting effect to naïve T cells in teleost phagocytic
  B cells. (1) Fc, C3a, and C5a receptors presenting at the surface of teleost B cells
  are involved in phagocytosis. CD22 plays regulatory roles in the micropinocytosis-dependent
  pathway to internalize large particles by turbot and Japanese flounder IgM+ B cells,
  but the contribution of BCR remains to be further studied. The PRRs recognize a
  wide variety of PAMPs to initiate phagocytosis, and TLR9 ligation is mediated by
  CpG ODN, resulting in the phagocytic capacities of splenic IgM+ B cells being up-regulated.
  Other PRRs, including RLRs, NLRs, and CLRs, remain to be explored. (2) Some cytokines
  are involved in the phagocytosis regulation of teleost B cells; specifically, IL-10,
  CK9, and IFN I-3 up-regulate phagocytosis, while IL-6 and BAFF have no significant
  effect. Other factors, such as antimicrobial peptide (cathelicidin) or micronutrients
  (vitamin C), have been proved to have an up-regulation function on teleost B-cell
  phagocytosis. (3) Pathogens (such as bacteria and viruses) are recognized by teleost
  B cells and engulfed into a vesicle as phagosome, with subsequent formation of maturated
  phagolysosome with a lysosome. The phagocytic B cells digest the internalized contents
  into component parts and proceed to antigen presentation with MHC II, which activates
  naïve T cells. However, no direct evidence has yet clarified how CD80/86 interact
  with CD28 in naïve T cells when B cells proceed to antigen presentation. “?” means
  as yet unknown; “NS” indicates no significant effect; “↑” means up-regulation.
