caption: 'Putative intracellular cascades activated by cyclic di‐nucleotides. In this
  schematic representation, TLRs are separated in two major groups, those associated
  to the membrane and those located in the endosomal compartment. For the sake of
  clarity, in this scheme there is no discrimination between the different TLR at
  either the membrane or endosomal compartment (for details in TLRs pathways see review
  by ). The membrane‐bound TLRs (TLR‐1, TLR‐2/1, TLR‐2/6, TLR‐4 and TLR‐5) detect
  PAMPs and DAMPs on the cell surface and bind to specific TIR domain containing adapters,
  such as TRIF, MyD88, TIRAP and TRAM. Other TLRs, such as TLR‐3, TLR‐7 and TLR‐8,
  are localized in intracellular vesicles and recognize RNA, whereas the intracellular
  TLR‐9 recognizes DNA. The important players downstream in these signalling cascades
  are TRAF6, TAK1 and TBK1, which in turn phosphorylates IRF‐3 and IRF‐7, leading
  to their homo‐dimerization and translocation into the nucleus, where they drive
  transcription of IFNs. This signalling cascades result in the activation of NF‐κB
  and MAPK, which in turn are leading to the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines
  and type I IFN. On the other hand, TLR‐independent recognition of PAMPs is mediated
  by the intracellular receptors NLRs (NODs) and RLRs (RIG‐I, MDA‐5) present in the
  cytosol, which after activation trigger a subset of responses, which are similar
  to those promoted by TLRs. Exogenous or viral dsRNA is recognized by the RNA helicase
  RIG‐I (or MDA‐5), and signals through the mitochondrial antiviral signalling adaptor
  MAVS (also known as IPS‐1), which activates TBK1, thereby leading to phosphorylation
  of IRF‐3, NF‐κB release, translocation of the transcriptional regulators and gene
  induction. DNA is sensed by DAI, leading to activation of the same TBK1/IRF pathway
  as RIG‐I/MDA‐5. The ER‐localized STING protein was shown to be critical for regulating
  the production of IFN in response to cytoplasmic DNA virus. In vitro and in vivo
  studies suggest that c‐di‐GMP and c‐di‐AMP are sensed through a cytosolic pathway
  leading to type I IFN induction. The induction of type I IFNs by c‐di‐nucleotides
  is dependent on TBK1/IRF‐3 signalling, although it is independent of known cytosolic
  receptors. The adaptor molecule STING also seems to be required for the type I IFN
  responses induced by c‐di‐nucleotides. Preliminary studies suggest that the adjuvanticity
  of c‐di‐GMP relies on activation by IRF‐3/IRF‐7. However, it is still unclear if
  c‐di‐nucleotides need to reach the cytosol to exert their activity or they are acting
  via up‐to‐now uncharacterized surface receptors. It is also unknown to which extend
  the induction of type I IFN is sufficient to explain the complex and pleiotropic
  adjuvant properties of these molecules. Additional information is also needed, to
  assert the molecular processes responsible for the observed differences between
  the biological activities of different c‐di‐nucleotides. Red lines: putative c‐di‐nucleotide
  driven pathways for which strong experimental evidence exists. Green lines: Presumptive
  pathway for which preliminary data is available. Black lines: non c‐di‐nucleotide
  driven pathways.'
