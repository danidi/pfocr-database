caption: A simplified view of siRNA-enhanced DNA-mediated IFN-λ1 signalling pathway.
  (A) RIG-I and IFI16 formed a protein complex in the presence of siRNA. (B) IFI16
  dissociated with the RIG-I–siRNA–IFI16 complex and bound with invaded DNA or DNA
  virus. (C) The dissociation of IFI16 initiated the downstream STING-TBK1-IRF3 signalling
  pathway. RIG-I/MAVS pathway also partially contributed the type III IFN induction
  pathway, but how MAVS interact with downstream TBK1 or STING remains unclear, where
  is indicated by a question mark and a dashed line.
