caption: 'Schematic diagram of cholesterol metabolism showing the physiological compartments
  involved. Also shown are the key enzymes, receptors, transfer proteins, and lipoproteins
  participating in cholesterol synthesis, transport, and degradation. Abbreviations:
  ACAT, acyl-coA: cholesterol acyltransferase; CE, cholesterol ester; TG, triglyceride;
  apoB, apolipoprotein B; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; SR-B1, scavenger
  receptor class B type 1; ABC A1, ATP binding cassette transporter A1; FC, free cholesterol;
  LCAT, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase; CETP, cholesterol ester transfer protein.
  Reverse cholesterol transport involves transport of free (unesterified) cholesterol
  from peripheral cells to HDL. This is initiated by the ATP binding cassette transporter
  A1 (ABC A1). It is subsequently esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase
  (LCAT). CETP mediates the transfer of cholesterol ester from HDL to VLDL and LDL,
  for disposal via the LDL receptor pathway, and of triglyceride in the opposite direction
  (plasma panel). Lack of CETP causes accumulation of cholesterol ester in HDL and
  thus increases the HDL cholesterol concentration in plasma'
