caption: Overview of TLR4 and JAK/STAT signalling pathway adopted from previous experimental
  studies and databases associated with signalling pathways , –. TLR4 activates two
  separate signalling pathways, including MyD88 and TRIF dependent pathways . TIRAP/Mal
  and TRAM are recruited by TLR4 as adaptor proteins to activate MyD88 and TRIF dependent
  pathways, respectively , . Following MYD88 activation, IRAK4 is phosphorylated by
  MyD88-MAL complex, which ultimately results in the phosphorylation of IRAK1 protein.
  Phosphorylated IRAK1 activates TRAF6  which after forming a complex with TAK1-TAB1/2
  activates Iκκ complex . Iκκα and Iκκβ catalyse the phosphorylation of IκB, resulting
  in its dissociation from NFκB. Afterwards NFκB translocate into nucleus  and transcribes
  PICyts which results in the subsequent induction of SOCS-1 , . Along with PICyts,
  SARM and A20 are also transcribed by NFκB which inhibit TRIF and TRAF6, respectively
  , . Interaction of SOCS-1 with MAL results in its polyubiquitylation and degradation
  of MAL . SOCS-1 also result in the degradation of NFκB after binding with its p65
  subunit . Moreover, it is also responsible for inhibiting PICyts mediated JAK/STAT
  signalling . The alternate pathway for the MyD88 independent induction of NFκB is
  TRIF which associates with RIP-1 and induce TRAF6 . Cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 associates
  with TRAM and TRIF, and interacts with a complex of TBK1 and Iκκi to induce phosphorylation
  of IRF3 . After dimerization, phosphorylated IRF3 translocate into nucleus which
  results in the production of type I IFNs. IFN-β is responsible for the downregulation
  of PICyts through a shift of TH1 to TH2 responses and induce immune regulation.
  Recently SOCS-1 mediated downregulation of IFN-β has been observed .
