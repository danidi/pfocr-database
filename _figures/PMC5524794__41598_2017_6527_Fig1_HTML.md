caption: Schematic representation of protoporphyrin IX biosynthetic pathway in the
  shell gland of brown egg laying hens. Glycine is transported from the cytosol to
  the matrix of mitochondria through the possible transporter SLC25A38. Succinyl coenzyme
  A and glycine are oxidized by aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) to δ-aminolevulinic
  acid, which is transported back to the cytosol through unknown transporter/s. The
  δ-aminolevulinic acid is converted into porphobilinogen through the action of aminolevulinic
  acid dehydratase (ALAD). The porphobilinogen is further reduced into hydroxymethylbilane
  through porphobilinogen deaminase (PGBD). In the next two steps, uroporphyrinogen
  III and coproporphyrinogen III are synthesized through the actions of uroporphyrinogen
  III synthase (UROS) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), respectively. The
  coproporphyrinogen III is transported back to mitochondria and is converted to protoporhyrinogen
  III through the action of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX). The protoporphyrinogen
  III is converted into protoporphyrin IX through protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX)
  that deposits into eggshell. It is not known, how the protoporphyrin IX is inhibited
  from being converted into heme, a part of haemoglobin.
