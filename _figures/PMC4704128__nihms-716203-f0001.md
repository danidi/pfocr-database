caption: 'AMPK is activated by high AMP (adenosine monophosphate) levels and by AMPK-kinase.
  It acts by enhancing glucose and lipids metabolism in order to elevate intracellular
  ATP. The enzyme also regulates the creatine kinase activity to reduce the ATP depletion.
  AMPK is also implicated in cardiac development, growth, and regeneration acting
  through PKB activation and insulin sensitivity. The dysfunction of the enzyme caused
  by mutations in its γ2 regulatory subunit can cause alterations in numerous secondary
  pathways and to the unregulated activation of nuclear transcriptional factors. All
  these effects can lead to cardiac hypertrophy, improper glycogen accumulation, ion
  channel dysfunctions, altered atrio-ventricular (AV) septation and ATP utilization
  by sarcomere, which seem to be the substrates for the various clinical features
  of PRKAG2 syndrome.PKB: protein kinase B; Red arrows: pathological pathway; Yellow
  arrows: normal pathway.'
