caption: Increased STAT5 initiates cancer and decreased STAT5 diminishes cancer promotion
  in genetically engineered mouse models. Increased levels of STAT5 expression and/or
  activation either directly by transgene-mediated STAT5 overexpression or indirectly
  through genetically engineered loss of caveolin-1 leads to initiation, promotion,
  and progression to mammary cancer. Decreased levels of STAT5 expression reduce cancer
  promotion initiated by transgene-mediated overexpression of prolactin, transforming
  growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), and estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) as well as mammary-targeted
  simian virus 40 T antigen. STAT5, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  5.
