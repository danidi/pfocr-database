caption: Model of RAN1 Function.Copper ion (filled circle) is hypothesized to be transported
  into the cell and brought to the RAN1 protein by the Arabidopsis homologs of the
  yeast CTR1 and ATX1 genes, called COPT1 and CCH1, respectively. The RAN1 protein
  (open circle) then delivers copper ion to the ETR1 apoprotein (apo), which then
  becomes functional and possibly is transported to the plasma membrane. In the absence
  of ethylene, ETR1 functions to activate CTR1, which is a negative regulator of the
  ethylene response pathway. Analysis of the ran1-3 mutant suggests that the protein
  also is required for the function of additional cuproenzymes, which are represented
  by the open triangle. Arrows indicate either direct or indirect interactions between
  elements. See the text for additional details.
