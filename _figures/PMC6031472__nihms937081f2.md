caption: Nucleotide excision repair (NER) system is the major DNA repair pathway that
  is utilized in UV-irradiated cells because of the high number of bipyrimidine dimers
  induced by UVR and takes place via a dual incision mechanism (involving the XPF
  and XPG endonucleases) that removes bipyrimidine dimers (indicated by a thymine
  dimer T<>T) from DNA in form of a small (~30-nt-long) oligonucleotide. DNA synthesis
  and ligation complete the repair reaction to restore the duplex to its native state
  (indicated in red). Base excision repair (BER) is utilized to repair oxidized base
  damage (such as 8-oxo-guanine [8-oxoG] residues) in UV-irradiated cells. BER involves
  a glycosylase that first removes the damaged base from the DNA before the action
  of AP Endonuclease, which incises the phosphodiester backbone 5’ to the apurinic
  (AP) site. DNA synthesis and ligation then restore the duplex. DNA double-strand
  breaks also form in UV-irradiated cells and can be repaired by either non-homologous
  end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). NHEJ simply involves re-ligating
  two broken ends to one another without significant end processing. In HR, more extensive
  end processing and end resection takes place, which allows for strand invasion and
  pairing to homologous DNA sequence elsewhere in the genome. DNA replication allow
  for missing sequence to be synthesized before resolution of the HR intermediate
  and restoration of the DNA duplex.
