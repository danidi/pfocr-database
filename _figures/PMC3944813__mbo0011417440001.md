caption: 'Targeting indispensable enzymes of NAD biosynthesis is expected to cause
  global metabolic catastrophe. In the simplified diagram of genomics-based reconstruction
  of NAD biogenesis and homeostasis (upper panel; for details, see  in the supplemental
  material), the key intermediary metabolites are shown by abbreviations in circles
  as follows: Asp, aspartate; Na, nicotinic acid; Nm, nicotinamide; NmR, nicotinamide
  riboside; NaMN, nicotinic acid mononucleotide; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide;
  NaAD, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide. Enzymes are indicated as products of
  the respective genes above corresponding biochemical transformations (arrows). Essential
  enzymatic steps are outlined in red, and two enzymes selected as targets in this
  study, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NadD) and NAD synthetase (NadE),
  are marked by an asterisk (*). Our study results suggest that the NadR-dependent
  pathway of NmR salvage is nonfunctional in M. tuberculosis (shown by grey and indicated
  by question marks), which has no typical PnuC-like NmR transporter. The NadR homolog,
  which is present in M. tuberculosis but not in M. smegmatis, appears to lack both
  of the enzymatic activities, corresponding to NmR kinase and NMN adenylyltransferase,
  reported for the bifunctional NadR enzyme from some gammaproteobacteria. As NAD
  constantly undergoes nonredox degradation (only some of NAD-degrading enzymes are
  shown), blocking its de novo synthesis, salvage, and recycling pathways via inactivation
  of a downstream enzyme(s), NadD or NadE, would impair the homeostasis of all four
  functional forms of NAD-related cofactors (middle panel). A resulting cofactor shortfall
  would suppress metabolic flux in hundreds of redox reactions comprising all essential
  pathways of central carbon and energy metabolism (lower panel).'
