caption: Signaling via CD27-CD70 pathways provides positive immune regulation. When
  stimulated with appropriate agonist such as anti-CD27 or anti-CD70 or cell lines
  made to express these molecules relay signals through TRAF2/5 resulting in long-term
  survival of cells via induction of NIK and NF-κB. Signals also result lead to the
  expression of PI3 kinase, ERK1/2, PLCγ leading to robust cell division.
