caption: PtdOH biosynthesis and metabolism. PtdOH is an intermediate in de novo triacylglycerol
  (TAG) biosynthetic pathway (i.e., the Kennedy pathway). It starts with glycerol-3-phosphate
  produced in the cell either via glycerol phosphorylation by glycerol kinase (GK)
  or from glucose via dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G3P dehydrogenase). Glycerol-3-phosphate is sequentially acylated first at the
  sn-1 position by the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT; there are
  four known isoforms) using Acyl-CoA as a fatty acid donor to form LPA. This reaction
  is reversible and is catalyzed by PLA. LPA can be dephosphorylated to monoacylglycerol
  via lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP), or as part of the Kennedy pathway, is further
  acylated at the sn-2 position again using Acyl-CoA as the fatty acid donor and carried
  out by 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, also known as lysophosphatidic
  acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) to generate PtdOH. This reaction is also reversible
  and catalyzed by LPA. PtdOH and DAG are “partners” in a synthetic route involving
  LPP also known as lipin or phosphatidic acid phosphatase, to generate DAG, which
  could be converted into PtdOH by diacylglycerol kinase (DGK; 10 known isoforms).
  Alternatively, DAG can be synthesized via acylation of monoacylglycerol by monoacylglycerol
  acyltransferase (MGAT) (also a reversible reaction). The final step is DAG esterification
  by diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT; two known isoforms) to triacylglycerol.
  The reverse reaction is carried out by adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL). PtdOH
  is also a product of PC hydrolysis catalyzed by PLD (two known isoforms). The remodeling
  pathway (Lands’ cycle) depends on the coordinated actions of PLA2 and lysophospholipid
  acyltransferases (LPLATs). Thus, PC can be hydrolyzed by PLA2 to form LPC, which
  can feed back into LPA via autotaxin (ATX)–carried out hydrolysis. Conversely, LPC
  can be reacylated back into PC with different fatty acyl substituents, supplied
  by Acyl-CoA and the action of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT).
