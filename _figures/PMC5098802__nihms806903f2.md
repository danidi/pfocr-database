caption: Following stroke or cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, complement can
  be activated by the direct binding of C1q and MBL to stressed cells, or via natural
  antibodies that recognize danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Reperfusion
  and activation of serum proteases like thrombin and plasmin can also provide an
  extrinsic mechanism to activate complement after stroke. Following initial activation,
  complement activity is amplified by the alternative pathway leading to deposition
  of opsonins, MAC and release of anaphylatoxins, all of which are involved in injury
  and recovery after stroke. Signaling through C3aR and C5aR1 has been implicated
  in promoting expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial surfaces, and to directly
  stimulate activation and migration of neutrophils and monocytes/microglia. Complement
  anaphylatoxins have also been shown to play a role in promoting neuronal stem cell
  proliferation and migration after stroke. C3d and other complement opsonins can
  also serve as targets and activators for phagocytic cells, but can also contribute
  to exacerbated loss of function after stroke by promoting synaptic and neuronal
  uptake by microglia and other phagocytic cells. Through a similar mechanism, complement
  opsonins can also beneficially assist with the clearance of apoptotic and dead cells,
  the resolution of inflammation, and synaptic remodeling after stroke. Finally, although
  several studies have shown MAC deposition in the brain after stroke, the role of
  MAC in post-stroke injury and recovery is still not well understood.
