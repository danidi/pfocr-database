caption: Schematic diagram of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
  pathway. Exposure to extracellular ligands leads to dimerization, autophosphorylation,
  and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). This triggers recruitment of
  adaptor proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (not shown) that enhance GDP/GTP
  exchange leading to RAS activation (RAS-GTP). RAF, the first MAPK of the cascade,
  is activated through a multistep process including RAS binding, recruitment to the
  plasma membrane, conformational change, phosphorylation (P), and dimerization. Activated
  RAF phosphorylates and activates the gatekeeper kinase MEK which in turn phosphorylates
  ERK. Activated ERK directly or indirectly regulates a plethora of cytoplasmic and
  nuclear substrates including transcription factors (TF), such as transcriptional
  regulators of MYC expression. In addition, ERK directly phosphorylates the transcription
  factor MYC which enhances its stability. TF-mediated alterations of gene expression
  profiles are relevant for cell cycle progression and proliferation. The different
  modes of negative feedback regulation of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling are not shown.
