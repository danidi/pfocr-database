caption: Overview of stealth strategies of Brucella. TLR signaling pathway is involved
  in the recognition of Brucella which mediates the secretion of TNF-α and IL-12 by
  DCs and Møs during the initial stages of infection that favor intracellular survival
  and replication. Brucella produces Btp1/TcpB protein that inhibits TLR2/4 signaling
  pathway while flagellin inhibits TLR5. Brucella LPS O-antigen binds with C3 preventing
  activation of complement cascade. Brucella inhibits activation of NK cells and neutrophil
  degranulation to interfere with innate immune response of host. Btp1/TcpB produced
  by this bacteria inhibit dendritic cells maturation, and Brucella LPS inhibits of
  antigen presentation, coupled together ultimately interfere with innate and adaptive
  immunity of host facilitating chronic infection. Brucella lipoprotein increases
  apoptosis of T cells which is dependent upon TNF-α secretion that directly inhibits
  the T cell response. Furthermore, Brucella inhibits macrophage apoptosis and autophagolysosomal
  fusion which are among the key stealth strategies of this pathogen. The final consequence
  of interfering with these mechanism results in the clinical manifestations of human
  brucellosis and in the natural hosts.
