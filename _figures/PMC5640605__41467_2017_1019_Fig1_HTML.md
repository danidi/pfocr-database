caption: Schematic overview of initial glucose metabolism in yeast and its connection
  to activation of the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway. Extracellular glucose is transported
  by facilitated diffusion into the cells after which it is phosphorylated by one
  of the two hexokinases or by glucokinase. The activity of the two hexokinases, but
  not glucokinase, is feedback-inhibited by Tre6P, the intermediate in trehalose biosynthesis.
  Glu6P is further converted into Fru6P, Fru1,6bisP, the triose phosphates DHAP and
  GAP, and the latter is subsequently converted to pyruvate and the fermentation product
  ethanol. Galactose is taken up by its own carrier, phosphorylated to Gal1P and further
  converted into Glu6P, where it joins the glucose catabolic pathway, effectively
  bypassing the hexokinase catalyzed step in glycolysis. The Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway
  exerts major control over cell proliferation, fermentation rate, stress tolerance
  and developmental pathways in yeast. As in mammalian cells, cAMP is synthesized
  by adenylate cyclase (Cyr1) and binds to the Bcy1 regulatory subunits of PKA, causing
  their dissociation from the catalytic Tpk subunits with activation of the latter
  as result. Yeast adenylate cyclase is activated by a glucose-sensing G-protein coupled
  receptor (GPCR) system, composed of the Gpr1 receptor, the Gα protein Gpa2, and
  its GAP factor Rgs2, similar to activation of adenylate cyclase by GPCR systems
  in mammalian cells. As opposed to mammalian cells, however, yeast adenylate cyclase
  is also activated by the Ras1,2 proteins, which are controlled by the Cdc25 (and
  Sdc25) guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and the GTPase activating proteins
  (GAP) Ira1,2. Ras and its regulators are highly conserved between yeast and mammalian
  cells (the GEF Sos and the GAP NF1, respectively). Although it was known that glucose
  catabolism in glycolysis is required for glucose activation of the Ras proteins
  and cAMP synthesis, the molecular connection remained unknown. In the present paper,
  it is shown that Fru1,6bisP functions as activator of Ras by interacting with Cdc25
  and that this connection between glycolysis and Ras is conserved between yeast and
  mammalian cells
