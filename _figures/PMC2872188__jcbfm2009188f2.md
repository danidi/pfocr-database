caption: A generalized depiction of the energy cost of neurovascular coupling and
  its impact on astrocytic glucose utilization (CMRglc). After enhanced synaptic activity,
  increases in extracellular levels of ATP, glutamate (glut), and K+ occur (shown
  in red on the left hand margin of the figure). It has been suggested that these
  factors, paricularly glutamate, arise from pre-synaptic neuronal elements, at least
  at low to moderate increases in synaptic activity. However, at higher levels of
  activity, post-synaptic contributions may come into play (). Glutamate enters the
  astrocyte through the glut-3Na+ cotransporter [1], whereas key K+ routes of entry
  include the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter [2], and, in exchange for the increased Na+
  from [1] and [2], the Na-K ATPase [3]. Glutamate and ATP can activate their respective
  metabotropic receptors [4] leading to IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER. Depletion
  of ER Ca2+ promotes Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels [5]. In addition,
  the elevated intracellular Na+ may be exchanged for extracellular Ca2+, through
  the plasma membrane Na-Ca exchanger operating in reverse mode [6], contributing
  further to the elevation in intracellular Ca2+. The Ca2+ rise provides a proximal
  stimulus for a variety of vasodilating pathways. Some of the major paracrine vasodilating
  factors arising from these pathways are shown in green on the right hand margin
  of the figure. This includes arachidonic acid (AA) derived from Ca2+-activated phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) [7]. The AA can be further metabolized, through cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1),
  to vasodilating prostanoids, primarily PGE2, and/or converted to epoxyeicosatrienoic
  acids (EETs) by a cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (; ). Arachidonic acid itself can
  act as a direct vasodilator (). An increase in K+ levels (up to 15–20 mmol/L) in
  the extracellular milieu provides a potent vasodilating stimulus through acting
  on smooth muscle inward rectifier K+ channels (). A key conduit for astrocytic release
  of K+ is the large-conductance Ca2+-operated K+ (BKCa) channel [8]. Those channels
  are well expressed in astrocyte foot processes (), along with IP3-sensitive Ca2+
  storage and release sites [9] (; ). The latter is thought to provide the localized
  elevations in [Ca2+] necessary for channel activation. Increased cytosolic Ca2+
  may also promote ATP exocytosis () [10], although Ca2+-independent and plasma membrane
  hemichannel routes may also exist (). The released ATP is rapidly hydrolyzed to
  adenosine (ADO) by astrocytic ecto-nucleotidases (). The ADO is returned to the
  cell through nucleoside transporters [11] to enter the adenosine kinase-mediated
  adenine nucleotide salvage pathway [12]. There are multiple sites of ATP consumption
  that, in turn, may trigger increased CMRglc. Some of the key sites that can be directly
  linked to astrocyte-derived vasodilating factors are shown. Principal among these
  is the plasma membrane Na-K ATPase [3]. Other ATP-consuming sites depicted in the
  figure are glutamine (gln) synthase-mediated conversion of glut to gln [13], the
  ER Ca-ATPase [14], the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase [15], and adenosine kinase-mediated
  formation of ADP and AMP [12].
