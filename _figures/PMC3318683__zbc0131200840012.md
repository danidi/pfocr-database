caption: A model of MMP-9 sorting and trafficking in activated macrophages. Activated
  macrophages exhibit increased levels of stable cytoplasmic MTs with increased production
  and trafficking of MMP-9. MMP-9 is processed through the biosynthetic pathway and
  is sorted in discrete vesicular organelles that contain calreticulin and PDI and
  do not colocalize with markers of neutrophil tertiary granules or intracellular
  degradation. Shown are MMP-9 vesicles being trafficked along stabilized MTs by the
  molecular motors kinesin 5B and 3B.
