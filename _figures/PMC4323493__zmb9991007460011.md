caption: The Egr-C/EBPβ axis is regulated by Arf and oncogenic Ras. In normal cells,
  growth factors induce immediate early genes, including Egr genes. Egr proteins in
  turn activate Cebpb and other transcriptional targets. Depending on the cellular
  context, the outcome could be proliferation or differentiation (e.g., adipogenesis
  []). In cells expressing oncogenic Ras, the phenotype depends on the presence of
  p14/p19Arf. When Arf is present, Egr expression is downregulated by Ras. However,
  Egr protein activity increases, thus activating Cebpb and other genes (e.g., PTEN
  and p53) whose products inhibit transformation and/or induce OIS. In addition, through
  a negative feedback loop, C/EBPβ can downregulate Arf. In Arf null cells, Egr and
  Cebpb mRNA levels are decreased further by RasV12, and the Egr proteins display
  reduced DNA binding. This effect is presumably due to the loss of specific posttranslational
  modifications on Egr proteins. Posttranslational activation of C/EBPβ by RasV12
  is also predicted to be suppressed in Arf-deficient cells (). Decreased expression
  and/or activity of the Egr-C/EBPβ network thus facilitates senescence bypass and
  malignant transformation.
