caption: The intrinsic pathway to apoptosis is initiated by activation of BH3-only
  protein. Among the BH3-only proteins, whose expression is often transcriptionally
  induced following an apoptotic stimulus, BID is unique in that it is activated by
  caspase cleavage (by caspases-2 and -8/10); cleaved BID, termed tBID. BH3 proteins
  trigger the activation of multi-BH domain proteins by direct binding or by inhibition
  of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family proteins. Once activated, multi-BH
  domain proteins form oligomers that induce MOMP. MOMP prompts pro-apoptotic proteins
  SMAC and cytochrome c to be released to the cytoplasm, where cytochrome c induces
  the formation of the Apoptosome. The initiator caspase-9 activated within the Apoptosome
  initiates the activation of executioner caspase-3 and -7, resulting in apoptosis.
  Of note, caspase-2 is activated via formation of the PIDDosome, a complex which
  consists of the adaptor proteins PIDD (p53-induced death domain protein) and RAIDD
  (RIP-associated protein with a death domain). However, despite identification of
  this complex, the precise mechanism of caspase-2 activation remains elusive. In
  addition, only a few cellular substrates of caspase-2, including BID, have been
  identified. Colored triangles denote that the indicated gene or gene product may
  be transcriptionally (blue), translationally (red), and post-translationally (green)
  up- or down-regulated in cancer cells (see text and ).
