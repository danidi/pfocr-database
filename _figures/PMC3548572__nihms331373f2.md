caption: VEGFA and BMP pathways have distinct as well as overlapping intracellular
  targets. The VEGFA pathway is known to phosphorylate and activate, among other factors,
  MAPK signaling cascades, which includes both p38 and ERK. Canonical BMP signaling
  activates Smads however BMP stimulation has been shown to effectively activate MAPK
  signaling cascades as well. During angiogenesis, BMP requires activation of ERK
  and not p38 [].
