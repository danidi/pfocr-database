caption: In cancer cells with a functional RB pathway, treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors
  usually induces quiescence or senescence. In some tumor types, senescence can be
  enforced by combined treatment with MEK inhibitors. The combination of a CDK4/6
  inhibitor with a PI3K inhibitor can change the cell fate towards apoptosis, which
  is rarely seen in a monotherapy setting. Senescent cells have a characteristic phenotype
  that includes an enlarged and flattened morphology, increased senescence-associated
  β-Galactosidase activity (“blue cells”) and the senescence-associated secretory
  phenotype (SASP). The SASP promotes changes in the tumor microenvironment, like
  vascular remodeling (allowing for increased uptake of chemotherapy in pancreatic
  cancer) or recruitment of cytotoxic T cells. CDK4/6 inhibitors also induce enhanced
  expression of MHC-I complexes on cancer cells, facilitating activation of cytotoxic
  T cells. Combination treatment with checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. an anti-PD-1 antibody)
  can further improve the immune-mediated clearance of senescent cancer cells. In
  some tumors, treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors can also reduce levels of immunosuppressive
  regulatory T cells or attract NK cells and promote NK-cell mediated cancer cell
  death.
