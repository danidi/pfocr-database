caption: Putative mechanisms involving ET-1 system whereby MPs released under VEGFi
  treatment causes endothelial cell dysfunction. VEGF/VEGFR inhibition causes an increase
  in ECMPs release which suggests an endothelial injury. In addition to carry ET-1,
  MPs induce endothelial cells damage by increasing ET-1 production, inflammation
  and ROS production through ETA and ETB activation but also by down-regulating eNOS/NO
  signalling. The dysregulation of endothelial cell function induced by MPs may induce
  vascular tone alterations and endothelial dysfunction, and may explain, at least
  partially, molecular mechanisms underlying VEGFi-associated hypertension.
