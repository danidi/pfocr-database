caption: Signaling cascades mediated by the interaction between PrPC and Aβ oligomers.
  A Binding between PrP and Aβ oligomers activates Fyn, which phosphorylates the NR2B
  subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, leading to its degradation. B An alternative
  pathway induced by PrP binding to Aβ oligomers, recruiting mGluR5, activating Fyn
  and leading to calcium accumulation and phosphorylation of eEF2, resulting in loss
  of neuron plasticity. The correlation between these two pathways remains to be determined.
