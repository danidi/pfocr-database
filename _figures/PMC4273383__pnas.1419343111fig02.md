caption: The IRE-1 pathway is one of the pathways that make up the UPR. IRE-1 is a
  transmembrane protein that initiates UPR when excess unfolded proteins accumulate
  in the ER. When activated, IRE-1 splices mRNA located in the cytosol to produce
  the protein XPB1, a transcription factor that travels to the nucleus where it up-regulates
  UPR target genes that encode a variety of proteins that reduce the load of unfolded
  proteins in the ER. © Cassio Lynm.
