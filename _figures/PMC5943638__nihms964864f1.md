caption: 'The figure depicts schematically the current consensus within the biology
  of aging community as to pathways that are important in order to target aging and
  indicates at which points metformin has been shown to have effects (see text). Key
  take-away: outside of the cell (1, top), metformin has been shown to affect the
  receptors for cytokines, insulin, IGF-1, and adiponectin, all pathways that are
  activated with aging and, when modulated, are associated with longevity. (1) Intracellular
  (2, middle) metformin inhibits the inflammatory pathway and activates AMPK, increasing
  inhibition of mTOR, which seems to be a major target to modulate aging. Through
  some of these mechanisms, it also modulates oxidative stress and removes senescent
  cells (the mitochondrial pathways are not shown, and the mechanisms by which metformin
  induces senescent cell removal remain unclear). (2) These processes jointly (3,
  bottom) affect inflammation, cellular survival, stress defense, autophagy, and protein
  synthesis, which are major biological outcomes associated with aging/longevity.
