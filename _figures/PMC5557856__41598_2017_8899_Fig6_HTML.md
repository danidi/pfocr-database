caption: Proposed mechanism by which CoQ10H2 improves metabolic function and inhibits
  insulin resistance in KKAy mice. In the liver, CoQ10H2 inhibited phosphorylation
  of CaMKII by enhancing the function of SERCA2, and reduced cytoplasmic Ca2+, thereby
  inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the transcription factor C-FOS by regulating
  the CaMKII-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. PDE4 gene expression was then inhibited
  and intracellular cAMP was increased. The increase in cAMP, however, promoted AMPK
  activity. On the one hand, expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α was increased and mitochondrial
  function was enhanced to promote the decomposition of fatty acids. On the other
  hand, triglyceride and cholesterol biosynthesis was inhibited. In adipose tissue,
  CoQ10H2 can prevent the excessive accumulation of visceral fat and promote the function
  of BAT, thereby improving obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome.
