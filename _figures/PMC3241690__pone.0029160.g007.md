caption: During early odontoblast differentiation, p-Smad2/3 induced by TGF-β1 signaling
  increased binding to NFI-C in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, MAPK activation
  by TGF-β1 signaling increased the interaction of phosphorylated NFI-C and Smurf1/2.
  Collectively, TGF-β1 and MAPK activation enhanced the interaction and formation
  of Smad2/3-NFI-C-Smurf1/2 complex and resulted in the degradation of NFI-C. In contrast,
  during late odontoblast differentiation and mineralization, NFI-C signaling resulted
  in the dephosphorylation of p-Smad2/3. Consequently, TGF-β1 induces odontoblast
  differentiation through the Smad signaling pathway in early odontoblast differentiation,
  while NFI-C signaling modulates late odontoblast differentiation and mineralization.
