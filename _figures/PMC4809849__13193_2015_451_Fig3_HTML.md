caption: 'miRNA biogenesis pathway: The primary transcript of miRNA, called pri-miRNA
  is transcribed by RNA polymerase II, following which it is cleaved by Drosha. The
  precursor (pre)-miRNA so formed is exported into the cytoplasm where it is process
  by Dicer. The passenger strand is degraded when the mature miRNA strand is loaded
  onto Argonaute proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The mature
  miRNA within the RISC complex mostly binds to the 3′UTR of mRNAs to cause either
  mRNA degradation or translational repression'
