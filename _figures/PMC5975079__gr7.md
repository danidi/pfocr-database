caption: Salient features of vit C-induced dormancy. (1) Response to hypoxic stress.
  Scavenging O2 by vit C induces the DevR regulon through DevS and DosT, including
  chaperone HspX, DNA repair protein NrdZ, hibernation promoting factors (Hpf; Rv1738
  and Rv0079) and triacylglycerol synthase (Tgs1). Tgs1 (and other Tgs) activity induces
  the accumulation of TAGs, which is utilized as a fuel during vit C-induced dormancy
  and re-growth through lipases and eventually generates acetyl-CoA that enters the
  TCA cycle. The enhanced expression and activity of Fe-S cluster containing enzyme
  aconitase (Acn) and isocitrate lyase (Icl) with concomitantly lowered expression
  and activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh) indicate the preferable usage of
  the glyoxylate pathway for metabolism. (2) Response to reductive stress. The reducing
  equivalents accumulated from a slowdown of growth processes are a stimulus for the
  redox regulator WhiB3 that activates lipid anabolic processes which serves as a
  reductive sink. The expression of mycothiol (MSH) and ergothioniene (EGT) redox
  buffers-synthesizing and reducing enzymes is also up-regulated. (3) Drug tolerance.
  Bacterial tolerance to INH, RIF and STR is mediated by the accumulation of TAGs,
  enhanced activity of efflux pumps and Icl, reduced availability of targets to drugs,
  and possibly through toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. (4) Increased susceptibility
  to PZA. Vit C induces the expression of pncA (PZase) and acidifies the medium to
  pH 5.5. The enhanced conversion of PZA to active POA, and subsequent formation of
  HPOA reduces the membrane potential. Increased susceptibility is attributed to membrane
  potential-lowering and dormancy-inducing properties of vit C. (5) Protective response
  of Mtb to oxidative stress. Vit C-mediated Fenton reaction leads to the formation
  of ROS that can affect the vital cellular components including DNA, protein, iron-sulfur
  (4Fe-4S) clusters and lipids. The enzymatic degradation of ROS by catalase-peroxidase
  (KatG), superoxide dismutase and alkyl hydroperoxidase (AhpC complex), Fe2+ efflux
  as well as chemical quenching of ROS by vit C effectively neutralizes oxidative
  stress. Further protection by DNA binding and repair proteins GroEL1 and NrdZ, respectively,
  protein refolding by chaperones and repair of iron-sulfur clusters provides molecular
  basis of cell adaptation to oxidative stress.
