caption: A proposed model of the RPL-11.2/RPL-5-PHA-4-mediated lipogenesis pathway
  required for nucleolar stress-induced lipid accumulation. Nucleolar stress is triggered
  by perturbation of pre-rRNA transcription and processing, activates PHA-4 expression,
  which is mediated by RPL-11.2/RPL-5 in C. elegans. Both RPL11 and RPL5 are conserved
  ribosomal proteins that are required for the nucleolar stress response in mammalian
  cells. PHA-4 subsequently binds to and transactivates the expression of the lipogenic
  genes pod-2 encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fasn-1 encoding fatty acid synthase,
  and dgat-2 encoding diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2. Upregulated POD-2, FASN-2,
  and DGAT-2 expression further promotes the biosynthesis of fatty acids and triacylglycerol
  (TAG), leading to excessive lipid accumulation. Furthermore, the increased lipid
  accumulation promotes worm survival under starvation
