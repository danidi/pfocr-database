caption: Responses to chromosomal instability. Errors of the mitotic machinery and
  its control mechanisms, such as the SAC, can trigger chromosomal instability. Diploid
  cells, including epithelial cells and stem cells, can undergo a mis-segregation
  of chromosomes, for example through multipolar mitosis. This can lead to aneuploidy,
  which describes the divergence from a diploid karyotype. In turn, the JNK stress
  signalling pathway is activated due to aneuploidy. This stress signalling mediates
  the removal of the damaged cells through apoptosis. For example, this is the case
  for wing imaginal epithelial cells. However, a resistance to apoptosis of cells
  can lead to tumorigenesis. This is the case for intestinal stem cells that generally
  do not undergo apoptosis. Epithelial cells that suppress apoptosis, for example
  through genetic manipulation, trigger tumorigenesis as well.
