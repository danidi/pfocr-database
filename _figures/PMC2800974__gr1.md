caption: Two examples of autophosphorylation in cell biology. (A) In Src family kinase
  (SFK) signaling pathway, the phosphorylation of a membrane receptor, from R to R∗,
  is catalyzed by an activated SFK. The activation of the SFK, however, is assisted
  by its association with phosphorylated receptor and the formation of R∗SFK complex.
  Dephosphorylation of R∗ is catalyzed by a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). (B)
  In endocytic pathway, the activation of Rab5 GTPase, from its GDP-bound state GGDT
  to GTP-bound state GGTP, is catalyzed by activated Rabex-5, a guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor. The activation of the Rabex-5, however, is assisted by its association
  with the GGTP via another regulator called Rabaptin-5. The GTP hydrolysis carried
  out by Rab5 is accelerated by a GTPase accelerating protein (GAP).
