caption: Structure and synthesis of teichoic acid in B. subtilis 168. (A) Chemical
  structure of poly(glycerol phosphate) teichoic acid attached to peptidoglycan. Gray,
  peptidoglycan; blue, GlcNAc; red, ManNAc; green, glycerol phosphate. (B) Teichoic
  acid biosynthetic pathway. The solid arrows indicate steps in the pathway that are
  catalyzed by the identified enzymes. The dashed arrows indicate the steps at which
  various nucleotide activated precursors are involved. For an explanation of the
  colors see above.
