caption: The putative mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 has two surface
  proteins and single-strand RNA with nucleocapsid proteins. S1 protein binds to the
  host ACE2 by cleavage with TMPRSS2 and furin. After this attachment, the virus enters
  the host cell via fusion or endocytosis. In the endosome, cathepsins B and L activate
  the S2 protein of the virus for membrane fusion. The virus components are recognized
  by TLR7, leading to the release of proinflammation cytokines (IL-6, NFκB, VEGF,
  and MMP9) via the MyD88 pathway in immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes,
  and dendritic cells. Once the virus RNA is released in the host cytoplasm, the virus
  polypeptide chain with ribosome translation is processed in the replication/transcription
  complex by virus RNA polymerase. Replicated virus RNA and proteins are assembled
  and packed with the host membrane in the host cytoplasm. Virus is released from
  the cell by exocytosis or the host cell’s burst. ARB/ACE-I, angiotensin receptor
  blocker/ACE inhibitor; Cat L, cathepsin L; CatB, cathepsin B; IκB, inhibitory proteins
  of κB family; MMP9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells;
  rhACE2, recombinant human ACE2 protein; TLR7, Toll-like receptor 7; TMPRSS2, transmembrane
  protease serine 2.
