caption: A simplified model showing transcriptional changes in gene expression of
  metabolic enzymes that characterize the progression from a normal liver to cirrhosis,
  which culminates in HCC. One of the most pronounced transcriptional changes during
  the transition from normal to HCC is the suppression of HK4 and ALDOB followed by
  the induction of the high affinity HK2 and ALDOA. This allows glucose to enter in
  the cells and be converted into pyruvate. PKM2 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA/LDHB),
  the last two enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, are essentially needed to maintain
  the high glycolytic rate of liver carcinomas by fast removal of accumulating upstream
  intermediates to favor the entrance into other metabolic pathways such as the oxidative
  phase of PPP. Surprisingly, those metabolic changes mostly occur early on the premalignant
  stage (cirrhosis) during hepatocarcinogenesis. While in cirrhotic livers glycolysis
  provides both biosynthetic building blocks and anti-oxidant defenses needed for
  the survival (as opposed to apoptosis) of damaged cells, in livers with HCC glycolysis
  cooperates with OXPHOS and TCA cycle to sustain energy needed for fast proliferation
  and metastasis. Our analyses suggest that the expression of glycolytic enzymes such
  as HK2, ALDOA, and PKM2 (marked by asterisks) in precancerous, chronically inflamed
  livers may be considered as new predictive biomarkers to prevent the development
  of liver cancer. Figure was created modifying illustrations provided by Servier
