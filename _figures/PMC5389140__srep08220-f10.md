caption: The four major phenazines of P. aeruginosa bind to hyphae and penetrate the
  cell. Few PCA penetrates due its negative charge (Lime green pathway,). Phenazines
  act at the level of mitochondria and induce the production of superoxide anion (O2·−)
  and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (Red pathway,). MnSod2p enzyme converts O2·− to hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2) and a catalase-independent mechanism allows its detoxification into
  H2O. The anion ONOO− formed from O2·− and nitric oxide (NO·) is also detoxified
  by MnSod2p (Red pathway,). PYO, PCN and PCA reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) which penetrates
  the A. fumigatus cell through the iron ferroxidase FetCp/permease FtrAp complex
  (Green pathway,). 1-HP also reduces Fe(III) to Fe(II) and two 1-HP molecules can
  chelate the newly formed Fe(II) (Orange pathway,). This chelating activity induces
  iron starvation which causes HapXp activation. The biosynthetic pathway of triacetylfusarinine
  C (TAFC) is then activated and allows Fe3+ acquisition to stimulate the growth of
  the fungus (Orange pathway,).
