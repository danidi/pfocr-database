caption: 'Overview of biosynthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids and its multiple
  cellular actions in the brain. The endocannabinoid system is composed of cannabinoid
  receptors (CB1 and CB2), endocannabinoids (2-AG and AEA), and its synthesizing (DAGL
  and NAPE-PLD) and degrading enzymes (MAGL, and FAAH). CB1 receptors are abundant
  in the central nervous system, particularly in the cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus,
  hypothalamus, and cerebellum. CB2 receptors are primarily present in microglia and
  immune system and are highly inducible following tissue injury or during neuroinflammation.
  As a lipid signaling molecule, 2-AG readily cross the membrane and activate CB1
  receptors located in the presynaptic neurons. Activated CB1 receptor inhibits neurotransmitter
  release through the suppression of calcium influx and activates potassium (K+) channels,
  as well as induces the activation of AKT and MAPK survival pathway. Although 2-AG
  mainly mediates retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, AEA also activates presynaptic
  CB1 receptors and intracellular CB1 receptors as well. 2-AG functions as the primary
  cannabinoid receptor signaling molecule. 2-AG is also a significant precursor for
  AA and therefore plays a substantial role in pro-inflammatory pathways. 2-AG is
  synthesized from DAG by DAGL, while AEA is synthesized from NAPE by NAPE-PLD. MAGL
  is the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of 2-AG. 2-AG also modulates the
  activity of microglia and astrocytes. These glial cells also are a source for brain
  endocannabinoids. Increased number of microglia and astrocytes are typically found
  in the ischemic brain and result in increased production of proinflammatory cytokines.
  This process leads to a change towards a more proinflammatory milieu in the brain.Abbreviations:
