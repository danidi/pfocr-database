caption: Outline of the canonical TGFβ1 signaling pathway. Upon activation, TGFβ1
  binds to its cognate receptor, which consists of two type I (ALK5) and two type
  II (TGFβRII) subunits. Initial ligand binding is to TGFβRII induces the recruitment
  of ALK5. TGFβRII subunits phosphorylate ALK5 subunits initiating their activation.
  ALK5 subunits then phosphorylate the receptor-activated Smad proteins Smads 2 and
  3. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 complex with Smad4 and then translocate to the nucleus
  to facilitate induction of expression of target genes, including profibrotic genes
  such as those for collagens, CTGF, periostin and αSMA. Canonical myostatin signaling
  proceeds in an analogous manner, but with different cognate receptors.
