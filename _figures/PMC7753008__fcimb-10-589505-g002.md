caption: Heparan Sulfate expression increases during the initial stage of viral infection
  to enhance viral attachment to cells. Virus inside of cell induces activation of
  cathepsin L in lysosome and promotes upregulation of heparanase expression through
  the NF-kB signaling pathway. Heparanase protein is activated by Cathepsin L and
  is translocated to the cell surface for the removal of heparan sulfate to facilitate
  viral release. HPSE, heparanase gene; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa beta. (Created
