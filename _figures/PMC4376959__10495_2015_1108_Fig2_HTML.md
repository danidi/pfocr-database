caption: 'Overview of sphingolipid metabolism. Central in the sphingolipid metabolism
  is ceramide. Ceramide is de novo synthesized at the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)
  with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase
  (SPT) being the first step. Further reduction and acylation by a ceramide synthase
  (CERS1-6) yields dihydrosphingosine (dHSph), which after desaturation results in
  the formation of ceramide. At the ER ceramide can be modified into galactosylceramide
  (GalCer), yet the majority of ceramide modification takes place at the Golgi in
  a manner depending on their further utilization. At the Golgi ceramide is used in
  the synthesis of sphingomyelin (SM) and glycosphingolipids in reactions catalyzed
  by sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) and glycosphingolipid synthases (GCSs), respectively.
  From the Golgi, SM and glycosphingolipids are transported to the plasma membrane
  (PM). Here SM can be turned into ceramide again by the actions of secretory and
  neutral sphingomyelinases (sSMase and nSMase, respectively). The ceramide can then
  be metabolized into ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), or
  be resynthesized back into SM. Complex sphingolipids residing in the PM can also
  be used as a pool for recycling of ceramide by entering the endolysosomal pathway.
  In this pathway acid SMase (aSMase) and glycosidases (GCase) produce ceramide, which
  in turn can be hydrolyzed into sphingosine and reused in the synthesis of ceramide
  or be degraded by phosphorylation into S1P followed by breakdown to hexadecenal
  and ethanolamine-1-phosphate (EA1P). In the Golgi, ceramide kinase (CERK) can phosphorylate
  ceramide thereby generating ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). Other abbrevations: 3KSR
