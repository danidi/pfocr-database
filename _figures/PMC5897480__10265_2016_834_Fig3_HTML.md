caption: Synthesis and degradation of l-Ara-containing molecules. UDP-l-Arap is synthesized
  in the de novo pathway in the Golgi apparatus and cytosol, which is shown in the
  left side. UDP-l-Arap is further converted to UDP-l-Araf in the cytosol. UDP-l-Araf
  and UDP-l-Arap serve as donor substrates in the synthesis of l-Ara-containing molecules.
  l-Ara-containing molecules undergo degradation by various glycoside hydrolases in
  the cell walls. The released l-Ara is recycled to UDP-l-Arap in the salvage pathway
  shown in the right side. The figure combines several reactions routes found in various
  plant species and is not to be understood to depict pathways found in any one particular
  plant. The enzymes in the de novo and salvage pathway are listed in Table
