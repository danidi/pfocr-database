caption: Extracellular signals activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the cell
  membrane, leading to the activation of RAS and subsequent activation of PI3K. Activated
  PI3K catalyses the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDK1; also known as PDPK1), which consequently associates with
  AKT and leads to phosphorylation (P) and activation of AKT by PDK1. Phosphorylated
  AKT, which is an activated form of AKT, enters the nucleus where it induces tumour-promoting
  genes. In the cytoplasm, phospho-AKT also activates other signalling molecules or
  pathways, a prominent one being the mTOR pathway, which has an important role in
  tumorigenesis by promoting translation. Phospho-AKT can also directly phosphorylate
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and consequently inactivates it. GSK3β normally
  inhibits β-catenin, thus the effect of phospho-AKT is to relieve GSK3β-mediated
  suppression of β-catenin. Consequently, β-catenin can enter the nucleus where it
  promotes the expression of tumour-promoting genes. In the nucleus, phospho-AKT can
  phosphorylate forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) on its AKT-specific motif. Such phosphorylated
  FOXO3 is translocated out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it binds 14-3-3
  proteins to be sequestered in the cytoplasm, thus terminating the pro-apoptotic
  activities of the FOXO3 pathway. The downward arrow for the FOXO activities in the
  nucleus in the figure indicates this negative effect of AKT on pro-apoptotic genes
  in the FOXO pathway, which would otherwise be upregulated by the FOXO3 pathway.
  This unique coupling of phospho-AKT to the three pathways provides a powerful driving
  force for thyroid tumorigenesis. The major negative regulatory mechanism of the
  PI3K–AKT pathway is PTEN, which is a phosphatase that converts PIP3 to PIP2, thus
  terminating the activation of the pathway. The inset shows the self enhancement
  mechanism of PI3K–AKT signalling in which genetic-alteration-driven activation of
  the pathway causes PTEN methylation and silencing with consequent loss of termination
  of the signalling, thus maintaining the pathway in full and constitutive activation.
