caption: Altered glycerophosphocholine (GPC) metabolism present in newborn cardiac
  tissue immediately following birth (A) and fetal serum before birth (B) due to chronic
  maternal cortisol exposure in late gestation. Cardiolipin was also found to be significantly
  elevated in CORT cardiac tissue but is not pictured in this pathway. Metabolites
  in red are significantly elevated in CORT compared with control specimens, while
  metabolites in blue are significantly elevated in control compared with CORT specimens.
