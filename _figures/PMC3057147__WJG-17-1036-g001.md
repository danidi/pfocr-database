caption: 'Top associated network functions for miR-141 and miR-200c. A: Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis predicted that the top associated network functions for miR-141
  were gene expression, cell death and cell cycle (P = 1 × 10-35). B: The top associated
  network functions for miR-200c were cell morphology, cellular assembly and organization,
  cellular function and maintenance (P = 1 × 10-38). Predicted targets of miR-141
  or miR-200c are highlighted in grey. Uncolored entries represent molecules that
  are associated with the pathway but are not predicted miR-141 or miR-200c targets.
  The P values were derived from a right-tailed Fisher’s exact test to calculate the
  probability that each predicted miRNA target matches the ascribed network function
  due to chance alone.'
