caption: Glucose is transported into the cell, phosphorylated and converted to pyruvate
  through glycolysis. The pyruvate that is not converted to lactate is metabolized
  into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria, which is processed in the TCA cycle to yield
  citrate. Citrate is shunted into the cytoplasm where it is converted to acetyl-CoA
  by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL). The resulting acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to malonyl-CoA
  by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Then, acetyl-CoA (1 molecule) and malonyl-CoA (7
  molecules) are condensed, dehydrated, reduced, and hydrolyzed by the seven domains
  of fatty acid synthase (FASN) [malonyl/acetyl-transferase (MAT), ketoacyl synthase
  (KS), b-ketoacyl reductase (KR), b-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (DH), enoyl reductase
  (ER), acyl carrier protein (ACP), and thioesterase (TE)] to synthesize the fatty
  acid palmitate. Palmitate can then be utilized for multiple cellular processes,
  including membrane synthesis.
