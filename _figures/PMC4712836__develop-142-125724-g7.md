caption: Cardiac contraction activates endocardial Notch signaling in a primary cilia-dependent
  manner to regulate trabeculation. Schematic diagram. (Blue boxes) Cardiac contraction
  activates a regulatory Notch-Ephrin B2a-Neuregulin 1 pathway in endocardial cells
  to activate ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes to promote trabeculation. (Red box)
  Given that Notch activation in non-contractile hearts is not sufficient for trabeculation,
  cardiac contraction also stimulates parallel pathways to promote trabeculation.
  (Purple boxes) Cardiac contraction causes blood flow, which is likely to be detected
  by primary cilia to activate Notch1.
