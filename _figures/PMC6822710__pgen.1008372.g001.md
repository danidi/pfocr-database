caption: Upon DNA damage, Mck1, together with Dun1, antagonizes the repressor function
  of Crt1 via phosphorylation, which allows the derepression of RNR2/3/4 transcription.
  Meanwhile, Mck1 inhibits the expression of the RNR inhibitor Hug1 in a Crt1-independent
  manner. This mechanism allows the cell to maintain appropriate dNTPs levels according
  to the degree of stress. Yeast Mck1 has been shown to phosphorylate the cell cycle
  regulators Cdc6, Hst3, and Sld2, the calcineurin regulator Rcn1 to stimulate calcineurin
  signaling, Pyruvate Kinase 1 (Pyk1), and the PKA regulatory subunit Bcy1 and to
  have roles in meiosis, sporulation, and heat stress resistance.
