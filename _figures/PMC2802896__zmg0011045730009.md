caption: 'Signaling by the sst2A receptor upon activation by different somatostatin
  analogs. Top, In HEK293 cells, SS-14 and octreotide (SS/Oct) inhibit adenylyl cyclase
  (AC) and stimulate cytosolic calcium via Gi/Go, whereas they increase ERK phosphorylation
  by two distinct mechanisms: a Gi/Go-mediated pathway, which is inhibited by pertussis
  toxin, as well as a pertussis toxin-insensitive process, shown by X. Although SOM230
  and KE108 (Som/KE) behave as full agonists to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, they antagonize
  the pertussis toxin-sensitive process that leads to an increase in intracellular
  calcium. Moreover, because the effect of SOM230 and KE108 to stimulate ERK phosphorylation
  is completely blocked by pertussis toxin, this action occurs solely via Gi/Go, and
  these analogs antagonize SS-14 stimulation of ERK phosphorylation by this pertussis
  toxin-insensitive pathway. Bottom, In AR42J cells, SS-14 and octreotide (SS/Oct)
  inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC) via Gi/Go but act by the pertussis toxin-insensitive
  G protein G14 to stimulate ERK phosphorylation and increase cytosolic calcium. SOM230
  and KE108 (Som/KE) are only able to activate Gi/Go signaling and act as antagonists
  for sst2A receptor signaling via G14.'
