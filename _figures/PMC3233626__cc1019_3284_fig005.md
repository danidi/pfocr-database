caption: 'The NIRF interaction network. The PPI information for the core cell cycle
  proteins (cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, cyclin E1, pRB and p53) were retrieved
  from the Pathway Commons database. Our NIRF interaction data were merged with the
  retrieved information using the Cytoscape software as described in the Materials
  and Methods. The symbols are as follows: yellow, cyclins; yellow-green, CDKs; blue,
  two major tumor suppressors; green, NIRF-interacting proteins included in the retrieved
  database information. The thicker black lines indicate interactions demonstrated
  by more than two methods. The interactions between NIRF and PCNA or HDAC1 were shown
  by both the antibody macroarray and the database information. The thinner black
  lines denote interactions shown by either the antibody macroarray or the pre-existing
  information in the database. Gray lines indicate other PPI information from the
  database.'
