caption: a The NFAT structure. The domains depicted are retained in NFATc1 and NFATc2
  isoforms. The N-terminal homology region (NHR) comprises the transactivation domain
  (TAD), the calcineurin docking sites (a, b), the nuclear localization sequence (NLS),
  the serine-rich regions SRR1–3 and the serine/proline-rich motifs SP1–3. Blue circles
  indicate phosphate groups in the SRR and SP domains that are removed by calcineurin.
  The red circle in the SRR-2 region indicates a calcineurin independent phosphorylation
  site with unclear function. RHR = Rel-like homology region. b The NFAT regulatory
  loop. A rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels leads to stepwise activation of the phosphatase
  calcineurin, which dephosphorylates multiple phosphoserines on NFAT proteins, leading
  to the rapid translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. NFAT proteins bind
  DNA target sequences in cooperation with partnering transcription factors (TF).
  Nuclear export is induced by rephosphorylation of the N-terminus of NFAT proteins
  by specific kinases such as GSK3β, CK1 and DYRK1. c Signal integration by NFAT and
  partner transcription factors. Activated NFAT factors rapidly bind to and induce
  transcription from a consensus (GGAAA–) promoter sequence localized within the serum
  responsive element of the c-Myc promoter. NFAT binding to this promoter region enhances
  the net histone acetylase activity associated with the c-Myc promoter and subsequently
  allows recruitment of a second Ras-MAPK signaling regulated transcription factor
  (ELK-1) to induce c-Myc expression.
