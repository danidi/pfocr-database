caption: Roles of Pin1 in virus infection. (A) In HIV, the Ser16-Pro17 motif of the
  capsid protein is phosphorylated by ERK2. Pin1 specifically binds the motif and
  rearranges the capsid structure to release HIV RNA. Pin1 inhibits expression of
  catalytic polypeptide A3G to prevent incorrect coding of HIV cDNA during reverse
  transcription. Pin1 binds to the Ser57-Pro motif of integrase after its phosphorylation
  by the cellular kinase JNK, thus enhancing the stability of the integrase and promoting
  integration of HIV cDNA into the host cell DNA. (B) The viral protein NS5A/NS5B
  contains multiple phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. Interaction of overexpressed
  Pin1 with NS5A/NS5B increases HCV RNA replication and enhances HCV infection. (C)
  BALF5 is a key enzyme that regulates EBV DNA replication. Pin1 binds to the Thr178-Pro
  motif of BALF5 and actively regulates EBV DNA replication by regulating the conformation
  of the enzyme. Pin1 can also promote proliferation of EBV-infected nasopharyngeal
  carcinoma cells by upregulating expression of cyclin D1. (D) Viral oncoprotein Tax
  plays an important role in cell proliferation and viral replication. In HTLV-1-infected
  cells, Tax activates the RB/E2F pathway to increase expression of Pin1, which maintains
  the stability of Tax. Pin1 binds to the Ser160-Pro motif of Tax after its phosphorylation
  by mitotic kinase, which enhances the ability of Tax to directly bind IKKγ, activate
  NF-κB signaling, and finally promote cell proliferation and tumor occurrence. (E)
  In HPV-infected cells, overexpression of Pin1 causes NF-κB nuclear retention and
  activation of STAT3. Viral protein E2 can target and enhance the activity of Pin1
  to increase the likelihood of cancer caused by HPV infection. (F) The viral protein
  HBx is a trans-activator of liver cancer. HBx activates cyclin D1 and the signaling
  pathway Wnt/β-catenin. Pin1 binds to the Ser41-Pro motif of HBx, which stabilizes
  the activity of HBx and induces overexpression of cyclin D1 and β-catenin, thus
  promoting liver cancer in HBV infection.
