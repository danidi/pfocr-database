caption: Schema of signaling pathway involved in IL-1β-induced inflammation in microglia.
  IL-1β induces inflammation by binding to its specific receptor IL-1R1 present on
  the cell surface and leads to the enhanced expression of HSP60 in microglia. HSP60
  is secreted by the microglia into the surrounding and binds to TLR4 and further
  induces the inflammatory process by the activation of MEK3/6 which leads to increased
  phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase pathway resulting in increased production of pro-inflammatory
  factors including TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6. HSP60, thus plays an important role in
  further increasing the intensity of inflammation by forming a feed-forward loop
  of inflammation in microglia
