caption: 'Functionally related pathways of aberrantly methylated and differentially
  expressed genes in immortalized MEFs. Merging Networks were generated by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis® (IPA®: v 9.0), using the gene lists in  and Supplementary Table
  S2 (ac versus bc). The convergence of genes involved in the MEK–ERK pathway, one
  of the most frequently disrupted pathways in human cancer (), is highly notable.
  Red and green nodes represent up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively.
  Yellow nodes are indicative of hypermethylated targets and white nodes show molecules
  that are not included in the datasets but interact with other components of the
  networks. Canonical pathways (CP: Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer) are outlined in
  blue.'
