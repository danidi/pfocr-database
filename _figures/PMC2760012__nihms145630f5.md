caption: 'A proposed mechanism by which T2DM increases the risk for AD. In T2DM brain,
  decreased level of GLUT3 leads to a decrease in glucose uptake/metabolism. Decreased
  intraneuronal glucose metabolism results in decreased level of UDP-GlcNAc, which
  is a metabolic product of glucose via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).
  Because protein O-GlcNAcylation is mainly regulated by intracellular level of UDP-GlcNAc,
  a decrease of the latter then causes decreased tau O-GlcNAcylation. Because the
  latter regulates tau phosphorylation negatively, decreased O-GlcNAcylation thus
  facilitates hyperphosphorylation of tau, which, in turn, forms toxic tau oligomers
  and causes neurofibrillary degeneration and cognitive impairments. All these resultant
  consequences play active roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Abnormal hyperphosphorylation
  of tau also leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a hallmark
  brain pathology of AD. In this figure, G on tau protein represents the O-GlcNAc
  group, and P represents the phosphate group. Abbreviations used in this figure:
  ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  Glc, glucose; GlcNAc, β-N-acetylglucosamine; Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate; GLUT,
  glucose transporter; OGA, O-GlcNAcase; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; UDP, uridine diphosphate.'
