caption: Proposed model for the role of DAPK1‐mediated Beclin‐1 phosphorylation and
  TTP‐mediated Bcl‐2 mRNA destabilization in autophagy leading to the suppression
  of inflammatory responses by gAcrp in macrophages. Bcl‐2 protein binds to Beclin‐1
  through its BH3 domain. The activation of DAPK1 by gAcrp facilitates Beclin‐1 phosphorylation
  at Thr119 and inhibits binding to its inhibitory protein Bcl‐2, which leads to autophagosome
  formation. For the other way, the level of Bcl‐2 protein itself is reduced by gAcrp
  through TTP‐mediated mRNA instability. AMPKα1/FoxO3A axis signalling acts as an
  upstream pathway that leads to the induction of TTP protein. The Adipo1 receptor
  (AdipoR1), rather than the Adipo2 receptor, plays a predominant role in the modulation
  of DAPK/Beclin‐1 signalling and AMPK/FoxO3A/TTP/Bcl2 axis by gAcrp in macrophages.
  Both DAPK1 activation and TTP induction are involved in autophagy activation via
  the modulation of Beclin‐1 and Bcl‐2 protein interaction, which inhibits LPS‐primed
  inflammatory cytokines expression
