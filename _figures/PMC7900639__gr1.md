caption: 'Interplay between autophagy and apoptosis: An alternative to Atg1-dependent
  pathway could be the Tor-induced autophagy or Atg6/Beclin dependent autophagy. Initial
  low level stress detected by TOR might activate autophagy response by ATG4 mediated
  proteolytic cleavage of ATG8, and the exposed C-terminal glycine in ATG8 might be
  conjugated to PE(phosphatidylethanolamine) through the catalytic actions of the
  E1-like and E2-like enzymes of putative Leishmania homologs of ATG7 and ATG3 respectively.
  This is followed by the binding of ATG5-12 complex and autophagosome formation.
  The interplay between autophagy and apoptosis might be controlled by ATG6/Beclin
  or calpain processed ATG5 during high cellular level of stress. The presence of
  a BH3 domain-containing BH3AQP indicates the possible presence of Bcl-like protein
  whose interaction with cleaved ATG5 fragment might trigger apoptosis-like death
  in Leishmania.'
