caption: The left panel depicts the seminiferous epithelium of a normal rat testis
  at stage VII of the epithelial cycle. As described in the text, at the time of spermiation
  (see right panel), MMP-2 cleaves laminin-333 to release biologically active fragments
  at the time of apical ES disruption (Step i), which can either destabilize BTB (Step
  ii) directly by reducing the steady-state level of integral membrane proteins at
  the site via protein endocytosis and endosome-mediated degradation, or indirectly
  by perturbing the hemidesmosome function by reducing the steady-state level of β1-integrin.
  The disruption of the hemidesmosome (Step iii), in turn, perturbs the BTB integrity
  via a mechanism remains to be investigated. However, it likely involves FAK and/or
  cSrc. The endocytosed proteins may also be re-used to assemble ‘new ’ TJ-fibrils
  behind the primary spermatocyte in transit via transcytosis. Using such a mechanism,
  the events of spermiation and BTB restructuring that take place at the opposite
  ends of the seminiferous epithelium can be coordinated at stage VIII of the epithelial
  cycle.
