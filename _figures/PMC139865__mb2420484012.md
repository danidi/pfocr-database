caption: Innate immunity pathways in Drosophila. Triggering the antifungal pathway
  leads to the activation of Drosomycin transcription. This cascade is initiated when
  Spätzle binds Toll, recruiting the adapters DMyD88, Pelle, Tube, and possibly DTRAF2.
  The latter interacts with Ref(2)P, which also binds DaPKC. Both Ref(2)P and DaPKC
  are essential for Toll-induced Drosomocyn expression, but they are not required
  for Cactus degradation. Instead, we propose that they stimulate Dif and/or Dorsal
  transcriptional activity. A parallel pathway is triggered by gram-negative bacteria,
  which leads to the activation of Diptericin and Attacin transcription. This cascade
  signals through the receptor peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LC and the
  adapter Imd and activates a Drosophila IKK complex. The D. melanogaster IKK complex
  regulates Relish endoproteolytic activation, via the caspase Dredd, and thus controls
  Diptericin expression. In parentheses are shown the names of the mammalian homologues
  of Pelle, DTRAF2, Ref(2)P, Dorsal, Dif, Imd, and Relish.
