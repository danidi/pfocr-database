caption: 'SE inhibited apoptosis of H/R-induced HK-2 cells by upregulating the mitochondrial
  damage-dependent-JNK expression to downregulate Caspase-3 expression, modulating
  the JNK/Caspase-3 signaling pathways. H/R: hypoxia/reoxygenation. The solid arrows
  represent positive feedback; the dotted arrows represent negative feedback. The
  red line represents the JNK/Caspase-3 signaling pathway; The green represents the
  action route of SE and target.'
