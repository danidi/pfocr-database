caption: The coagulation pathway and target sites for anticoagulant drugs., The coagulation
  pathway is a cascade of enzymatic conversions, each activating the next enzyme (Factor)
  in the sequence. The final enzyme in this pathway is thrombin, also called Factor
  IIa, which catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin strands. Warfarin (W)
  acts by inhibiting synthesis of factors in the liver. In contrast, heparin (H) acts
  to inhibit factors that have become activated within the bloodstream. Thrombin can
  be activated by either of 2 pathways. The intrinsic pathway is initiated within
  the bloodstream by platelet thromboplastin. H influences this pathway by inhibiting
  Factor IXa. However, it also inhibits Factors Xa and IIa within the common pathway,
  and its activity must be monitored using the activated partial thromboplastin time
  (aPTT). The extrinsic pathway functions outside the bloodstream, initiated by tissue
  thromboplastin. This pathway is influenced most by W because it inhibits hepatic
  synthesis of Factor VII, the most essential factor in this pathway. The anticoagulant
  activity of W is monitored using the prothrombin time (PT), which is now standardized
  as the international normalized ratio (INR). Newer agents, commencing with the low–molecular-weight
  Hs (L) have greater specificity for inhibiting Factor Xa and thrombin within the
  common pathway and generally do not require therapeutic monitoring.
