caption: The purinosome—a naturally occurring enzyme cluster? a Protein–protein interactions
  within the purinosome. Each holoenzyme of the purine biosynthesis pathway is shown,
  with the number of subunits reflecting the dominant oligomeric state of each. The
  grey lines indicate experimentally demonstrated pairwise protein–protein interactions.
  PPAT phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, ADSL adenylosuccinate lyase,
  ATIC 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/5′-inosinemonophosphate
  cyclohydrolase, FGAMS phosphoribosyl formylglycinamidine synthase, GART phosphoribosylglycinamide
  synthetase/phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase/phosphoribosylaminoimidazole
  synthetase, PAICS phosphoribosyl aminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase. b
  Potential organisation of the purine biosynthesis enzymes within the purinosome
  enzyme cluster. The first three enzymes of the pathway, PPAT, GART and FGAMS, form
  a core complex that interacts with an ADSL–PAICS pair and with ATIC. In this way,
  multiple copies of the core complex are assembled via interactions with ADSL–PAICS
  and ATIC
