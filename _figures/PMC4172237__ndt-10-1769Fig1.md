caption: 'Neurobiology in FXS.Notes: (A) In the normal neurobiology of the synapse,
  FMRP regulates the expression of GABA receptors and the metabolism and catabolism
  of GABA. (B) The affected neurobiology in FXS, with reduced GABA synthesis and transport,
  fewer GABAA and GABAB receptors, and therefore overall reduced GABAergic activity.
  (C) The neurobiology in FXS with GABAergic treatments. The sites of action for the
  medications are indicated by stars on the various receptors and enzymes. Arbaclofen
  focuses on the presynaptic GABAB receptors to increase their activity with a secondary
  inhibitory effect on the presynaptic release of glutamate. Ganaxolone, acamprosate,
  and riluzole all work on the GABAA receptors to increase the reduced activity. Ganaxolone,
  however, has higher affinity to the extrasynaptic δ subunit containing GABAA receptors.
  Vigabatrin reduces the resynthesis of GABA to glutamate, which is already increased
  in FXS.Abbreviations: FMRP, fragile X mental retardation protein; FXS, fragile X
  syndrome; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid; GABA-T, gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase;
  GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase.'
