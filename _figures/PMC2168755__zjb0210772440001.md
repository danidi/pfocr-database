caption: Schematic representation of the biosynthesis of CPS by the Wzy-dependent
  pathway. The biosynthesis of the CPS of serotype 23F is represented. UDP-linked
  components of the repeat CPS unit are synthesized by genes encoded within the cps
  locus or are available from central metabolism (). Repeat unit biosynthesis is initiated
  by the transfer of glucose phosphate to the lipid carrier by the IT WchA (), followed
  by sequential addition of the other components of the repeat unit, catalyzed by
  the GTs (), and the lipid-linked repeat unit is transferred across the membrane
  by the Wzx flippase () and polymerized by Wzy to result in lipid-linked CPS ().
  Finally, the lipid-linked CPS is linked to the cell wall by a poorly understood
  process involving the Wzd/Wze complex, with release of the undecaprenyl phosphate
  carrier (). The genes in the representation of the cps locus and their gene products
  are color coded; a key is given for the repeat unit constituents (modified from
  reference ).
