caption: Mechanisms of YAP regulation in early stages of prostate cancer. a. Heat
  shock protein 27 (Hsp27) induces MST1 ubiquitin-mediated degradation, which in turn
  causes LATS1 and MOB1 dephosphorylation and thereby inactivation, consequently inducing
  YAP nuclear translocation []. b. Two different mechanisms were proposed by which
  polarity protein (Par3) regulates YAP; (1) Par3 inhibits YAP activity through inducing
  the recruitment of Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2/Merlin) and LATS1 to the membrane.
  As a result, LATS1 is activated, which induces YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic
  retention []. (2) Par3 induces YAP activation through the dissociation of kidney-
  and brain-expressed protein (KIBRA) from its canonical complex (KIBRA/NF2/ FERM
  domain-containing protein 6 (FRDM6)) and drives the recruitment of KIBRA to the
  Par3/aPKC/KIBRA complex. Thus, the interaction between KIBRA and LATS1 is disrupted,
  which induces LATS1 dephosphorylation and thereby YAP activation []. c. E26 transformation-specific
  (ETS) transcription factors trigger YAP induction. (1) ETS-regulated gene (ERG)
  activation drives YAP activation in old aged mice. ERG induces YAP and TEAD4 promoter
  activity and thereby triggers YAP target gene expression []. (2) ETS translocation
  variant 1 (ETV1) drives YAP activation by recruiting lysine specific demethylase
  (JMJD2A) to the YAP promoter [].
