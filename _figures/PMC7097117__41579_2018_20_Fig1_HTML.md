caption: a | Induction of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15. The expression of ubiquitin-like
  protein ISG15 and members of the ISG15 conjugation pathway is strongly induced by
  type I interferons (IFNs). Upon type I interferon stimulation, interferon regulatory
  factor 9 (IRF9) interacts with phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 and forms the interferon-stimulated gene factor
  3 (ISGF3) complex, which recognizes the interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE)
  promoters of ISG15 and its conjugation enzymes to induce their expression. During
  chronic viral infection, both IFNβ and type III interferons lead to the formation
  of an unphosphorylatyed ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) complex, which is composed of IRF9 and unphosphorylated
  STAT1–STAT2 (refs,), to induce the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs), including ISG15 (ref.). Additional stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), foreign DNA or RNA, retinoic acid and DNA-damaging agents, are also able
  to induce the expression of ISG15. LPS was shown to induce ISG15 expression via
  TIR domain-containing adapter protein inducing IFNβ (TRIF; also known as TICAM1)–IRF3
  signalling pathways, but this stimulation still functioned in a type I interferon-dependent
  manner. Retinoic acid can also induce ISG15 expression through its induction of
  type I interferons,. By contrast, the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
  could induce ISG15 expression via IRF3 in an interferon-independent manner. IRF3
  forms a complex with CREB-binding protein (CREBBP)/p300 and binds to the ISRE elements
  to induce ISG15 expression,. Bacterial DNA can also induce ISG15 expression independent
  of type I interferon and can signal through a cytosolic surveillance pathway that
  requires stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), serine/threonine-protein
  kinase TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7 (ref.). Notably, the expression of ISG15 and its conjugation
  enzymes is controlled by the ISRE elements, mediated by various IRFs. However, a
  recent study found that ISG15, as well as its conjugation enzymes, including ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme E1 homologue (UBE1L), ubiquitin/ISG15-conjugating enzyme E2 L6 (UBCH8) and
  E3 ubiquitin/ISG15 ligase TRIM25, possess cellular tumour antigen p53-responsive
  elements in their promoters. DNA-damaging (for example, ultraviolet light or doxorubicin)
  or agents (for example, camptothecin) induce p53, which binds to these p53-responsive
  elements to transactivate the ISG15 pathway. b | The ISG15 conjugation pathway.
  ISG15 is initially expressed as a 17 kDa precursor protein that is then processed
  into its mature 15 kDa form via protease cleavage,. Conjugation of ISG15, commonly
  referred to as ISGylation, utilizes a three-step enzymatic cascade similar to that
  of ubiquitination. The activating E1 enzyme UBE1L functions only in the ISG15 pathway,,
  forming an ATP-dependent thioester bond with ISG15 (ref.). Following activation,
  ISG15 is transferred to the active-site cysteine of the ubiquitin/ISG15-conjugating
  enzyme E2 L6 (UBCM8) (in mouse) and UBCH8 (in human),. Finally, an E3 ligase facilitates
  the conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins. Although several enzymes, including
  E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ARIH1 and TRIM25, have been found to act as E3 ligases
  within the ISG15 pathway,, human HERC5 (mouse HERC6) appears to be the dominant
  E3 ligase that coordinates the conjugation of the majority of substrates to ISG15
  (refs,–). However, during DNA-damage responses (DDRs),TRIM25 also serves as a p53-specific
  ISG15 E3 ligase. Notably, its corresponding E2 enzyme for ISG15 conjugation has
  not been identified. HERC5 associates with polyribosomes and appears to target newly
  synthesized proteins, including viral proteins and many interferon-induced proteins.
  ISGylation is also reversible via the specific removal of ISG15 from conjugated
  proteins by the deconjugating enzyme Ubl carboxy-terminal hydrolase 18 (USP18),.
