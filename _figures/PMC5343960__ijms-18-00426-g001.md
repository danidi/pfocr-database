caption: Schema outlining the early-life insults that drive the potential mechanisms
  that may underpin the developmental programming, leading to developmental origins
  of health and disease (DOHaD)-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in adulthood.
  There is a link between melatonin synthesis and signaling pathway close to oxidative
  stress, epigenetic regulation, glucocorticoid effect, and renin-angiotensin system
  (RAS). Early intervention with melatonin could be a reprogramming strategy to prevent
  the development of DOHaD-related NCDs in later life.
