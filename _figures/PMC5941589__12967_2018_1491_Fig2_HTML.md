caption: Antitumor and protumor functions of γδ T cells. γδ T cells have both direct
  and indirect antitumor effects. Direct antitumor effects are mediated by lysing
  the tumor through the perforin-granzyme pathway, providing an early source of the
  inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, eliminating Fas+ and TRAIL-R+ tumor
  cells, and ADCC. The indirect antitumor role of γδ T cells is mediated by polarized
  γδ Tfh cells, which promote B-cell antibody secretion. Besides, γδ T cells also
  present antigens for αβ T cell priming, trigger dendritic cell (DC) maturation,
  and induce robust NK cell-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity to play indirect antitumor
  role. With regard to their protumor effect, γδ T cells can polarize into FOXP3+ γδ
  Treg cells, and γδ T17 cells. In addition, Vδ1 T cells are another subset of γδ
  T cells that possess protumor activity. γδ T cells are able to directly impair αβ
  T cells and DC antitumor immunocyte function. γδ T cells can also enhance MDSC,
  SPM, and neutrophil immunosuppressive functions. Together, these actions promote
  tumor angiogenesis, growth, proliferation, metastasis, and immune escape(Parts of
