caption: AOverview of the glycolytic pathway and the entry into the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle. Drosophila gene symbols of enzymes are given. PDC stands for pyruvate
  dehydrogenase complex.B–B″Two Glyceraldehyde‐3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (Gapdh2)
  transcripts are annotated in the Drosophila genome. Grey boxes indicate 5′ and 3′
  untranslated regions (UTR). Exons are indicated by beige boxes and introns by the
  black line (adapted from FlyBase). Red arrowheads mark the position of primers used
  to detect fully spliced cDNA; orange arrowheads mark the position of primers used
  to detect unspliced cDNA. (B′) Representative result of semi‐quantitative RT–PCR
  analysis of Gapdh2 transcripts upon knock‐down of ecd in the whole wing disc using
  C765‐GAL4 (C765>ecd RNAi, see  for the expression pattern of C765‐GAL4). The expression
  of the translation initiation factor eIF‐4a serves as an internal normalization
  control. (B″) Levels of spliced (red) and unspliced (orange) Gapdh2 mRNAs upon knock‐down
  of ecd, shown as a fold change relative to control. Levels of Gapdh2 transcripts
  were normalized to the levels of eIF‐4a. Error bars indicate ± SD, n = 6. t‐test,
  **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001. Loss of Ecd reduces the levels of spliced Gapdh2 mRNA
  but increases the levels of unspliced Gapdh2 mRNA.C–C″Two Pyruvate kinase (PyK)
  transcripts are annotated in the Drosophila genome (adapted from FlyBase). (C′)
  Representative result of semi‐quantitative RT–PCR analysis of PyK transcripts upon
  knock‐down of ecd. (C″). Levels of spliced (red) and unspliced (orange) PyK mRNAs
  upon knock‐down of ecd, shown as a fold change relative to control. Levels of PyK
  transcripts were normalized to the levels of eIF‐4a. Error bars indicate ± SD, n = 6
  (red, spliced), n = 4 (orange, unspliced). t‐test, ns =  not significant, ***P ≤ 0.001.
  Loss of Ecd increases unspliced PyK mRNA.D–D″Four Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  (Pdk) transcripts are annotated in the Drosophila genome (adapted from FlyBase).
  (D′) Representative result of semi‐quantitative RT–PCR analysis for Pdk transcripts
  upon knock‐down of ecd. (D″). Levels of spliced (red) and unspliced (orange) Pdk
  mRNAs upon knock‐down of ecd, shown as a fold change relative to control. Levels
  of Pdk transcripts were normalized to the levels of eIF‐4a. Error bars indicate ± SD,
  n = 3. t‐test, *P ≤ 0.05. Loss of Ecd reduces Pdk mRNA levels, consistent with results
  from mammalian cell culture (Dey et al, ).  Source data are available online for
  this figure.
