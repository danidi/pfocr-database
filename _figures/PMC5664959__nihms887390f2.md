caption: Mutant p53 gains new functions to promote tumorigenesis by activation of
  the metabolic melanovate pathway or upregulation of epigenetic enzymes. Drugs that
  target the melanovate pathway (simvastatin, GGTI-2133) or epigenetic enzymes (MLL1,
  MOZ inhibitors) show promise for the treatment of p53 mutant cancers. Cytoplasmic
  mutant p53 also promote tumor growth through activation of mTOR signaling, providing
  an opportunity to using mTOR inhibitors to treat cancers with cytoplasmic mutant
  p53. In addition, mutant p53 often gains novel function(s) to promote tumor invasion
  and metastasis through activation of cell invasion pathways (PDGFRβ signaling, RhoA/ROCK,
  EGFR/integrin recycling, Myo10, Pla2g16). Small molecular inhibitors (ROCK inhibitor,
  EGFR inhibitor, Myo10 inhibitor and Pla2g16 inhibitor) have been used to target
  each pathway to inhibit the metastatic ability of p53 mutant cancers.
