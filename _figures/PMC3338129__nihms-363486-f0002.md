caption: ABCA1 null macrophages have an enhanced pro-inflammatory response to ligands
  for TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 compared with wt macrophages, likely reflecting increased
  cholesterol and TLR assembly in lipid rafts. ABCG1 null macrophages have a similar
  TLR-hyperresponsive phenotype. Conversely, apoA-I suppresses cytokine induction
  through an ABCA1-activated JAK2-STAT3 pathway and perhaps also through disrupting
  rafts, while HDL suppresses the type I interferon response pathway downstream of
  TLR4, by promoting translocation of the TLR adaptor TRAM to intracellular compartments.
  SR-BI also suppresses TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation. Pathogens in turn interfere
  with LXR signaling by stimulating TLR3/4-dependent activation of IRF-3, which is
  thought to interact with the LXRE on LXR target genes, such ABCA1 and ABCG1. HDL
  and apoA-I can also activate the ectodomain shedding of ADAM17 substrates, such
  as TNFR2, TNFR1, and TNFα, leading to their release.ABC, ATP binding cassette; Adam,
  a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; HDL, high density lipoprotein; IRF, interferon
  regulatory factor; Jak, Janus kinase; LXR, Liver X Receptor; SR-BI, scavenger receptor
  class B type I; Stat3, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TLR, Toll
  like Receptor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor.
