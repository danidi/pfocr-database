caption: The Hedgehog signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of Hedgehog (HH) ligand,
  Patched (PTCH) blocks the ciliary localization of Smoothened (SMO), and a repressor
  form of GLI (mainly GLI3R) suppresses the induction of GLI target genes. (B) Signaling
  is activated in the presence of HH ligand. The binding of HH ligand to PTCH prevents
  PTCH inhibition of SMO, and SMO then interacts with the Ellis van Creveld Syndrome
  (EVC)–EVC2 complex and translocates into primary cilia to be fully activated. SMO
  then activates GLI family transcription factors, mainly GLI2. GLI2 up-regulates
  the expression of GLI1, as well as GLI target genes. GLI1 is also activated downstream
  of SMO. Activated GLI2 (GLI2A) and GLI1 further upregulate the expression of various
  GLI target genes. This figure has been adapted from our previous work [].
