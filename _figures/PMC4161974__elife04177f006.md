caption: 'Dectin-1 expressed by DCs and macrophages recognizes N-glycan structures
  on tumor cells and signals to activate IRF5 pathway and other pathways, thereby
  activating NK cells. Thus, NK cells require tumor recognition and signaling by these
  innate immune cells for their effective tumoricidal action. Although INAM is depicted
  here, the DC-mediated activation of NK cells would involve other molecules and this
  Dectin-1-IRF5-INAM pathway may represent only a part of the entire picture. It remains
  to be further characterized as to whether and how this and/or other effector ligands
  induced by Dectin-1 signaling contribute to NK activation in full. It is possible
  that DCs/macrophages are secondarily activated by yet unknown factors from NK cells
  (see dashed arrow).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04177.034'
