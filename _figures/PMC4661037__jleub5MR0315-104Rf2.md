caption: Schematic view of systems investigation integrating multiple components of
  immune function. Collection of blood or tissue samples from enrolled subjects (older
  and younger) can be assessed for multiple assays, including DNA polymorphisms and
  genotyping; phenotyping of surface receptor expression; signaling pathway activity;
  and ligand-stimulated responses, which may be correlated with clinical parameters
  of study subjects for a more comprehensive view of immune status. Computational
  models can be tested and refined in a validation cohort. GWAS, genome-wide association
  studies; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; RNA-seq, RNA sequencing.
