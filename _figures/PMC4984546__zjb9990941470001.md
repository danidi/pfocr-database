caption: Proposed catabolic pathway for ethanolamine in P. aeruginosa PAO1. The PA4022-eat-eutBC
  operon encodes a central catabolic pathway for ethanolamine. Ethanolamine enters
  the bacterium through simple diffusion and/or transport mediated by Eat (PA4023).
  Intracellular ethanolamine is hydrolyzed into ammonia and acetaldehyde by ethanolamine-ammonia
  lyase, which is composed of large EutB (PA4024) and small EutC (PA4025) subunits.
  The acetaldehyde intermediate is converted into acetate via an NAD+-dependent acetaldehyde
  dehydrogenase, PA4022 and/or ExaC (PA1984). Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthetase
  (AcsA) is required for acetate utilization in P. aeruginosa () and therefore is
  predicted to be responsible for the activation of acetate into acetyl-CoA during
  ethanolamine catabolism. The results of the current study suggest that the EBP PA4021
  activates transcription of the PA4022-eat-eutBC operon from an RpoN promoter in
  response to acetaldehyde; a mechanism that is essential for ethanolamine catabolism.
