caption: A proposed mode of action for RHOA to maintain TE characteristics in the
  expanding blastocyst. RHOA acts on two separate pathways to regulate maintenance
  of the TE. One pathway is to preserve the integrity of the blastocyst cavity, possibly
  either through modulation of actin filament or activation of ROCK. The other pathway
  is to retain the TE-specific gene expression program, through control of HIPPO-YAP
  signaling, which may involve the core components LATS/AMOT/NF2. TE-specific gene
  expression program may also have influence on the integrity of the blastocyst cavity.
  See Discussion and Table  for further details.

  signaling and to maintain the trophectoderm-specific gene expression program in
  a ROCK/actin filament-independent manner.
