caption: Proposed model for possible mechanism of MUC4-mediated resistance to apoptosis.
  In a viable cell, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bax, Bak) and BH3-only
  proteins, such as Bad, are antagonized by anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-XL,
  Bcl-2. In response to an apoptotic stimulus, Bad are activated and prevent anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 members from inhibiting pro-apoptotic members. Pro-apoptotic members then
  form pores into the mitochondrial membrane and release pro-apoptotic factors, such
  as cytochrome c into the cytosol, which subsequently activates the caspase cascade
  leading to apoptosis. In response to the gemcitabine treatment in CD18/HPAF/Scr
  MUC4-expressing pancreatic cancer cells, MUC4 phosphorylates anti-apoptotic protein
  Bad through MUC4-HER2-ERK-mediated pathway. Phosphorylation of Bad facilitates its
  binding with scaffolding protein 14-3-3 and, thereby, inhibits translocation of
  Bad to the mitochondria to deactivate the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. These findings
  suggest that MUC4-mediated increased phosphorylation of Bad through HER2/ERK pathway
  might be responsible to protect pancreatic cancer cells from the gemcitabine-induced
  apoptosis.
