caption: Experimentally determined phosphorylated proteins at 5 min (green with orange
  P) with pathway proteins (blue) that were not experimentally observed to be phosphorylated
  after 5 min of mechanical strain. Associations based on literature searches and
  phospho-site annotation (HSPB1 represented here as HSP27).
