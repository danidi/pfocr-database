caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathways that regulate Drosophila metabolism.
  Functional interactions described in the text are depicted for a fat body cell under
  both fed and starved conditions. Solid lines and arrows represent signaling interactions,
  while dotted lines and arrows represent regulatory effects that occur in the absence
  of that signaling pathway. In the fed condition (top), DILPs and nutrients signal
  through the insulin and TOR pathways, respectively, resulting in retention of FOXO
  in the cytoplasm and increased translation, driving growth. Sugars and fatty acids
  are stored as glycogen and TAG, while energy-producing metabolic pathways are down-regulated.
  In starved animals (bottom), insulin and TOR signaling is attenuated, directing
  FOXO nuclear translocation and reducing protein synthesis, restricting growth. Glycogen
  and TAG are mobilized by AKH and lipases such as Brummer, while energy producing
  metabolic pathways are up-regulated. See text for more details.
