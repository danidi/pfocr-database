caption: De novo and salvage pathway synthesis of dTMP in the nucleus. 1C metabolism
  is required for the synthesis of purines, dTMP, and methionine. Formate is a major
  source of 1C units, which are generated in the mitochondria. Mitochondrial-derived
  formate can enter the cytoplasm and function as a 1C unit for folate metabolism
  through the activity of MTHFD1. At S phase, the enzymes of the dTMP synthesis pathway
  undergo SUMO-dependent translocation to the nucleus. The 1C is labeled in bold.
  Inset shows the thymidylate synthesis cycle, which involves the enzymes MTHFD1,
  SHMT1, SHMT2α, TYMS, and DHFR as well as the salvage pathway. AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  AICAR Tfase, aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine;
  DHF, dihydrofolate; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; dUMP, deoxyuridine monophosphate;
  GAR Tfase, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase; MTHFD1 (C), MTHFD1 C activity;
  MTHFD1 (D), MTHFD1 D activity; MTHFD1 (S), MTHFD1 synthase activity; MTR, methionine
  synthase; MTHFR, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like
  modifier.
