caption: Diabetes mellitus induced regulation of skeletal muscle. Diabetes mellitus
  (DM) induced elevated blood glucose is the major source of advance advance glycation
  end product (AGE) which binds with its receptor advance glycation end product (RAGE)
  to activate the signal cascade into myocyte. RAGE activation enhances the generation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of nicotinamide adenine
  diphosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase. Ang-II also induce the production ROS not
  only by activating NADPH oxidase but also by inducing the mitochondria. ROS may
  exert its effects on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) through Rac1-Mkk6 and Ras mediated
  pathway or accelerate the damage of muscle protein through Ca2+ depended pathway.
  Beyond the generation of ROS, RAGE also activates PI3K which in turn activates NF-κB
  through Csp3- PKR and Akt mediated pathway. Activated PKR may induce the activation
  of eIF2α that inhibits protein synthesis. DM induced Proinflammatory cytokines interleukin
  6 (IL-6) activates the gene through JAK-STAT signaling pathway and TNF activates
  the factor NF-κB via IKK or MAPKP38 induced pathway. Ang-II induced GC also have
  role in muscle atrophy and GC exerts its effect through GC-GCR complex mediated
  pathway. Insulin signaling is also important for muscle growth because it sequesters
  the activity of Csp3 through inducing the production of cIAP-1 and MEK which are
  potential inhibitor of Cap3. Type 1 DM reduces the production of insulin and type
  2 DM makes the cell insulin resistance, so due to the deficiency of insulin it limits
  the functioning of cIAP-1 and MEK.
