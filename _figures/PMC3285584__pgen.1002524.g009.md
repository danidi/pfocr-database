caption: A tentative model is shown that describes the data presented here. Briefly,
  Tgifs limit Smad2 transcriptional activity, which is required for activation of
  Fgf8 expression. Tgif regulation of the Nodal-Smad2 pathway is required for the
  correct balance between Gli3 and Shh activity in the Shh pathway. Dashed lines indicate
  that the links from the Nodal-Smad2 pathway to Shh signaling components may not
  be direct, and that the regulation may be of both Shh and Gli3, or may occur primarily
  via one of them.
