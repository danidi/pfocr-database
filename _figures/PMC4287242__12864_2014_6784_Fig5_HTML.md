caption: Signaling pathways associated with capacitation-related proteins. The pathway
  was drawn using Pathway Studio 9.0 after a database search in PubMed. Red denotes
  the proteins that were abundantly expressed after-capacitation, while blue denotes
  proteins that were abundantly expressed before-capacitation. At least 8 proteins
  were implicated in different sperm-specific process among the 10 proteins.
