caption: SARS-CoV-2 infection may activate and promote the adhesion and accumulation
  of naïve B cells to the mediastinal lymph node with β2 integrin (LFA-1) and α4β1
  integrin. The increased infiltration of naïve B cells activated by spike proteins
  from SARS-CoV-2 secretes large amounts of IgM to promote extrafollicular response
  and humoral immune response. Monocytes are recruited and differentiate to macrophage
  in response to the robust humoral immune response. Secreted IgM simultaneously activates
  the complement system and Fc receptor in dendritic cells and macrophage to increase
  antigen presentation and phagocytosis to facilitate innate and adaptive immunity.
  On the other hand, high affinity or abundant SARS-CoV-2 presented by antigen-presenting
  cell (APC) such as dendritic cell may stimulate IL-12-dependent plasma cell differentiation
  in naïve B cells to produce more IgM, instead of promoting B cell proliferation
  and differentiation by CD40/CD40L signaling mediated germinal center formation.
  Ibrutinib inhibits B-cell growth by specifically inhibiting Bruton kinase, which
  is thought to be critical for the BCR signaling pathway; Natalizumab reduces B-cell
  migration by blocking α4β1 integrin. Fingolimod reduces B-cell egress out of the
  lymph node by stimulating S1PR1/3 to internalize the receptors.
