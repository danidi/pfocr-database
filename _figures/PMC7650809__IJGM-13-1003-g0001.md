caption: 'CTLA-4 pathway: (A) T cell activation in response to the tumor-associated
  antigen requires 2 signals. The first signal is achieved when the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell (APC) recognizes the
  T-cell receptor (TCR) of the T cell. The second signal is the binding of CD80/86
  (also known as B7) on the APC cell with the CD28 receptor on the T cell. This will
  lead to the activation of the immune response against the tumor cells. (B) CTLA-4
  (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4), a homolog of CD28, is a checkpoint
  present on T cells that limits proliferative response of activated T-cell by competing
  with CD28 for its ligand CD80/86. This inhibition will interrupt the second signal.
  (C) Monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 block CTLA-4 and will lead to T- cell activation
  and proliferation against the tumor cells.'
