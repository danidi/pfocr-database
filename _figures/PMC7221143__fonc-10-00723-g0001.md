caption: 'Intracellular cysteine pool supply. Extracellular oxidized cystine is imported
  at the expense of one glutamate molecule via Xc− system composed of two subunits:
  xCT transporter and the chaperone CD98. This complex xCT is also associated with
  the stem-like cancer cell marker CD44v. Imported cystine is then reduced to cysteine
  by cystine reductase (CR) (). Methionine conversion leads to cysteine synthesis
  via the transsulfuration pathway (). Two important steps in this synthesis are conversion
  from homocysteine to cystathionine by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and synthesis
  of cysteine from cystathionine by cystathionase (CTH). Degradation of glutathione
  (GSH) via CHAC1 intracellularly provides cysteine supply (). GSH, either from exogenous
  sources or exported from cells via Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 exporter (MRP1),
  is cleaved extracellularly by γ-Glutamyl transferase (GGT) forming γ-Glutamyl-X
  substrate and Cysteinyl-Glycine. This Cysteinyl-Glycine dipeptide can either be
  potentially transported via PEPT2 or cleave by dipeptidase releasing cysteine and
  glycine (). γ-Glutamyl moiety can be complexed to available extracellular cyst(e)ine
  forming γ-Glutamyl-cysteine. Cysteine supply from GSH is one of the main function
  of γ-Glutamyl-cycle (). Available extracellular cysteine is then transported via
  ASCT family members but can also be oxidized and imported via xCT.'
