caption: Up-regulation of BIRC3 transcription by NPD1-dependent c-REL expression.
  Stimulus-driven proteosomal degradation of IκB proteins is mediated by the IKK complex,
  which liberates NF-κB dimers and results in their further translocation into the
  nucleus and transcriptional activity. NF-κB signaling often is divided into two
  types of pathways. The canonical pathway (yellow) is induced by most physiological
  NF-κB stimuli and is represented here by TNFR1 signaling in an IKKβ- and NEMO-dependent
  manner, with resulting activation of RelA containing heterodimers. In contrast,
  the non-canonical pathway (purple) is stimulated by certain TNF family cytokines,
  such as CD40L and lymphotoxin-β, and it involves IKKα-mediated phosphorylation and
  generation of p52-RELB complexes in a NIK-dependent manner, which is subject to
  a complex regulation by TRAF3, BIRC3, and other ubiquitin (UB) ligases. Activation
  of both pathways could generate c-REL containing hetero- or homodimers. NPD1, which
  is synthesized in response to oxidative stress in the eye and brain, triggers the
  production of c-REL-containing dimers independent of both the canonical and non-canonical
  NF-κB pathways, possibly by modifying the c-REL TBK1/IKKϵ axis via activation of
  a putative receptor (blue).
