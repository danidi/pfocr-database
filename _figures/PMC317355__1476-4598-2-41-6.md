caption: TGFβ signaling in normal colonic epithelium and cancer cells. Panel A describes
  the functional pathway of TGFβ signaling in normal colonic epithelial cells. TGFβ
  ligand binding with TGFβRII recruits TGFβRI into a tetrameric receptor complex resulting
  in transphosphorylation and activation of TGFβRI. After phosphorylation, the TGFβRI
  becomes an active kinase which phosphorylates Smad 2 and Smad3. SARA (Smad Anchor
  for Receptor Activation), a scaffolding protein facilitates interaction between
  Smad2, Smad3 and TGFβRI. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 allow the formation of homo-
  and heterodimerization complex, including Smad4. The Smad complex then translocates
  into nucleus, binds with DNA, and stimulates the expression of target genes including
  p15 (inhibitor of cell cycle kinase that controls cell cycle into G1 phase) and
  PAI-1 (inhibitor of protease 1 that degrades extracellular matrix proteins during
  metastasis). Panel B shows the abnormal pathway of TGFβ signaling in colon cancer
  cells. Many colon cancer cells with microsatellite instability (MSI) due to defective
  mismatch repair (MMR) activity induce mutations in TGFβRII gene. Often, these are
  frameshift mutations that insert or delete one or two adenine bases located within
  a 10 base-pair polyadenine repeat region (base-pairs 709–718, codons 125–128; referred
  to as BAT-RII) of TGFβRII gene. These mutations encode TGFβRII proteins truncated
  between 129 and 161 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain which causes functional
  inactivation of these proteins. Thus, the loss of TGFβ signaling may abolish cell
  cycle control and induce metastasis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting p15 and
  PAI-1 genes expression, respectively.
