caption: Lipid biosynthesis in cancer cells. FAs are required by cells to build cell
  membrane as phospholipids and for energy storage as TG, which is stored in LDs and
  catabolized in the mitochondria through β-oxidation to provide energy. Lipids can
  be transported from extracellular source or synthesized by cells using glucose,
  glutamine, and acetate as carbon source. Cell signaling pathways can also increase
  lipid biosynthesis. Ligand binding to RTK, which activates PI3K phosphorylation
  of PIP2 to PIP3, activates AKT and mTOR pathway resulting in activation of the transcription
  factor SREBP. SREBP can upregulate citrate transporter SLC25A1 and lipid synthesis
  enzymes ACLY, ACSS2, ACC, FASN, and SCD. Hypoxia also plays a part in lipid biosynthesis,
  where Hif-1α upregulates glucose uptake, several enzymes in lipid biosynthesis,
  and reduces flux of glucose to acetyl-CoA through the mitochondria by upregulating
  PDHK1/4, kinase that inhibits PDH. Enzymes colored in yellow were those targeted
  with inhibitors. Metabolites are in square white boxes, enzymes are in oval boxes,
  transcription factors are in hexagonal boxes, and metabolic pathways are in bold
  and italics. Red arrows represent upregulation of expression by transcription factors.
