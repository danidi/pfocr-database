caption: 'NetworkAnalyst visualization of Reactome pathway “neutrophil degranulation”
  genes with elevated expression in individuals from Endotype A. All genes with significantly
  higher expression in Endotype A that appeared in the Reactome PA category “neutrophil
  degranulation” (R-HSA-6798695) were visualized as a protein:protein interaction
  network using NetworkAnalyst. The color of each node reflects fold change between
  Endotypes A and B where green indicates higher expression in Endotype A. Gray nodes
  are genes that are not themselves differentially expressed (DE) but interact with
  other DE neutrophil degranulation genes. The size of each node (gene) reflects the
  number of documented interactions with other DE genes in the network. Thus, the
  largest circles have the greatest number of DE interacting partners and are predicted
  to be the most important regulators (“hub proteins”) of this network: inflammatory
  biomarker S100A8/A9, mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAPK14 (p38
  MAPK), heat shock protein HSPA1B, the lysosome-associated glycoprotein LAMP2, tubulin
  TUBB4B, and Toll-like receptor protein TLR2 and its regulator/adaptor TOLLIP.'
