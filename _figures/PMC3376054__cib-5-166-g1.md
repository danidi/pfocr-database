caption: 'Under basal condition (), glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampal CA1
  region is coupled to proteins required to induce synaptic plasticity (SP), such
  as N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptor (AMPAR), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, Nramp1), neuronal NADPH
  oxidase and a large number of kinases that are activated by calcium (e.g.: ERK 1/2).
  At hippocampal dendrites, the endoplasmic reticulum, an intracellular calcium reservoir
  containing the ryanodine receptors (RyR), which are activated by calcium and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). In the nucleus, regulatory sequences within the genes involved
  in SP (CpG islands), are frequently methylated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).
  Methylation of cytosine at position 5, leads to the formation of 5-methyl-cytosine
  (5mC) which is recognized by methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) preventing the
  binding of transcription factors activated by calcium, such as cAMP response element-binding
  (CREB). Neuronal activity () triggers critical events for expression of SP, such
  as insertion of AMPAR to the synapse; superoxide generation and subsequent dismutation
  to hydrogen peroxide; iron uptake that promotes oxidative reactions; NMDAR activation
  that allows the calcium influx from the synaptic cleft, which coupled with redox
  modifications of RyRs, amplifies the signal of calcium in a process known as calcium-induced
  calcium release. This process activates calcium signaling pathway such as ERK/MAPKs
  that phosphorylate the transcription factor CREB, regulating genes involved in SP.
  Iron may modulate the binding of these transcriptional regulators, forming adducts
  such as 8-hydroxyguanosine (8OHG) or 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5HmC).'
