caption: A possible mechanism underlying the therapeutic benefits of LMDIR treatment
  in AD. In the Aβ-overexpressing brains, a vicious cycle between neuronal loss and
  glial activation is established and promotes the onset of AD. Aβ induces neuronal
  loss and synaptic degeneration, and the degenerating neurons then release microglial
  activators, resulting in the activation of glial cells. In addition, activated microglial
  cells produce neurotoxic cytokines. Interestingly, the NF-κB signaling pathway is
  associated with upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine from glial cells.
  LMDIR treatment inhibits neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation by inhibiting the
  NF-κB signaling pathway. Stimulatory pathways are indicated by + arrows and − arrows
  indicate inhibitory pathways. Low–moderate dose ionizing radiation (LMDIR); AD,
  Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ, amyloid-β; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B.
