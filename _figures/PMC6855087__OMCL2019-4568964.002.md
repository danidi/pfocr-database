caption: 'Strategies for inhibition of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Several agents
  targeting various nodes of STAT3 cascade have been developed. Agents that act on
  nodes 1 and 2 indirectly switch off STAT3 signaling. Compounds at node 3 directly
  target STAT3 protein or its DNA-binding downmodulating STAT3 activation. p-STAT3:
  phosphorylated STAT3; p-JAKs: phosphorylated JAKs.'
