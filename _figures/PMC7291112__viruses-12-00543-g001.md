caption: 'Schematic diagram of the roles of gga-miRNAs in host response to infectious
  bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection. IBDV infection affects the expression of
  miRNAs in host cells. These miRNAs promote or inhibit IBDV replication by directly
  targeting the IBDV’s genome or the mRNA of the host genes involved in the immune
  signaling pathway. Seg A: IBDV genome segment A; Seg B: IBDV genome segment B; SOCS1:
  suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; SOCS3: suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; SOCS5:
  suppressor of cytokine signaling 5; SOCS6: suppressor of cytokine signaling 6; TANK:
  TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator; IRF2: interferon regulatory factor
  2; MDA5: melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; Bcl2: B-cell lymphoma 2, an
  anti-apoptosis protein; p53: a tumor suppressor with a mass of around 53 kDa; IFN:
  interferon.'
