caption: (A) Potential mechanisms involved in propagation of α-syn. Spreading mechanisms
  of α-syn in neighboring cells are multiple and can occur via (1) passive transmission
  through membrane fusion; (2) classical exocytosis and endocytosis; (3) packaged-exosomes;
  (4) tunneling nanotubes (a direct connection between two cells); (5) axonal transport
  and transsynaptic junction; and (6) receptor-mediated internalization. (B) Molecules
  and signaling pathways involved in α-syn-mediated microglial activation. Excessive
  microglial activation can increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and INF-γ), and induce an oxidative stress response, including
  the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) as well as the
  production of NADPH oxidase. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a vital role in recognizing
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiating innate immune responses
  via distinct signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK activation. Activation
  of TLR2 resulted in the accumulation of α-syn as a result of the inhibition of autophagic
  activity through regulation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Other receptors that are involved
  in the α-syn-induced microglial response include FcγRs/CD36/P2 × 7R/EP2/Mac-1/Ion
  channels. Also, α-syn induced the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
  and stimulated the activities of MAPK, NF-κB, and AP-1. In addition, MMPs may activate
  microglial protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) in an autocrine or paracrine manner
  and increase microglial inflammatory signals (not shown in the diagram). Furthermore,
  major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) and Th1 cells were targeted recently
  for the activation of microglia. Exosomes are specifically and efficiently taken
  up by microglia via a macropinocytotic mechanism and are released via activation
  of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2a, 2b, and 5-HT4) receptors. Activated exosomes expressed
  a high level of MHC–II, which may be a potentially important pathway for the activation
  of microglia. In contrast, regulator of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10), RING finger
  protein 11 (RNF11), and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) inhibitors exert negative
  regulation on NF-κB signaling, producing a dampened immune response. Finally, microglial
  cells are also able to phagocytose different forms of extracellular α-syn, via ubiquitin-proteasomal
  system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), presenting a mechanism of clearance
  that might be even beneficial for neuronal survival. The CD36 (a scavenger receptor),
  FcγRs (Fc gamma receptors), Mac-1 (macrophage antigen-1 receptor), EP2 (prostaglandin
  E2 receptor subtype 2), P2 × 7R (purinergic receptor P2×, ligand-gated ion channel
  7), and plasma membrane ion channels.
