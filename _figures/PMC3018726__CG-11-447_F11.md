caption: Abbreviated schematic of metabolic pathways leading to the de novo biosynthesis
  of RNA and DNA precursors. Purines are synthesized from a branchpoint intermediate,
  inosine monophosphate (IMP). In the primidine pathway, deoxyuridine and deoxythymidine
  intermedates are made from deoxycytidine diposphate. ATP, is predominantly synthesized
  from ADP in the mitochondria, and is the most used cofactor in the cell. Deoxynucleotides
  are made from ribonucleotides.
