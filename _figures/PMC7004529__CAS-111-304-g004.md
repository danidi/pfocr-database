caption: The cGAS‐STING pathway plays two different roles in liver tumorigenesis.
  DNA damage induces cellular senescence in hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and hepatocytes
  in the liver. Accumulation of cytosolic DNA leads to activation of the cGAS‐STING
  pathway, resulting in production of senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  factors. Short‐term exposure to SASP factors drives recruitment of immune cells
  to clear pre–malignant cells and senescent cells, thereby preventing tumorigenesis.
  However, long‐term exposure to SASP factors generates chronic inflammation and promotes
  tumorigenesis in obese mice
