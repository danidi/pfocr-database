caption: 'Schematic model of the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism pathway and
  its relationship with methylation reactions. Folate undergoes two reduction steps
  to produce THF. Vitamin B6 serves as a co-factor of SHMT to catalyze the synthesis
  of 5,10-CH2 THF. Vitamin B2 serves as a precursor of the co-factor for MTHFR to
  produce 5-CH3 THF. The vitamin B12-dependant enzyme MS uses 5-CH3 THF to convert
  homocysteine to methionine, the precursor of SAM. Finally, SAM mediates various
  methylation reactions. The blue arrows indicate that high intake of vitamin B6 and
  folate leads to increased DNA synthesis, stability, and repair. The red arrows indicate
  that high intake of B12 is associated with abnormal DNA methylation. Abbreviations:
  DHF, dihydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; 5-CH3 THF, 5-methytetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH2
  THF, 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase;
  SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; MS, methionine synthase; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine;
  DNMT, DNA methyltransferase.'
