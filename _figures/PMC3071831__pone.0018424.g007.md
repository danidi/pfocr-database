caption: Insulin Receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)
  are activated by Insulin and/or IGF1 signaling at the insulin receptor level. PDK1
  and Akt are recruited to the plasma membrane by products of PI3K, PIP2, PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5 trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4 bisphosphate). After this event
  there is phosphorylation and activation of Akt by mTORC2 complex (mTOR + mLST8+
  Rictor). This leads to a chain of activation of numerous targets by Akt. The TSC1/2
  complex is also phosphorylated in this fashion. By the mechanism inactivation of
  TSC2's GAP activity for the small G protein Rheb is initiated. Now mTORC1 complex
  (mTOR + mLST8+Raptor) is activated by GTP-bound Rheb and phosphorylates proteins
  like S6K. This starts a negative feedback loop to modulate auto-activity, through
  S6K-mediated pathway decrease in the activation of PI3K. IGF1R antibody inhibits
  IGF1R signaling and rapalogs (Temsirolimus in this case) inhibit mTORC1 short term,
  and eventually inhibit mTORC 2 with chronic exposure, and also suppresses EWS-FLI1
  which drives tumorigenesis in Ewing's sarcoma. EWS-FLI1 suppresses nestin.
