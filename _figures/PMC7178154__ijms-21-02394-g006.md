caption: The carotenoid (A) and chlorophyll (B) metabolic pathway in tobacco leaves
  during curing. Up-regulated proteins or increased metabolites are marked with upward
  red arrows, while down-regulated proteins or decreased metabolites are marked with
  downward green arrows. The numbers represent the fold change. The left arrows or
  numbers represented the difference of proteins or metabolites during 0–48 h, the
  middle arrows or numbers indicated the difference during 0–72 h, and the right indicated
  the difference during 48–72 h. Gi numbers and ratios of the DEPs are shown in .

  ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase; LCYB, lycopene β-cyclase;
  LCYE, lycopeneε-cyclase; BCH, β-carotene hydroxylase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase.
