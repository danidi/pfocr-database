caption: Figure 1. Most clinical DC vaccine studies to date have employed “IL-4 DCs.”
  These DCs are generated by in vitro differentiation (1) of monocytes for 5–6 d in
  the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4
  (IL-4). These immature IL-4 DCs then undergo maturation (2) for 1–2 d by adding
  a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines (A). We have previously designed an alternative
  protocol for the generation of monocyte-derived DCs, termed “IL-15 DCs.” These IL-15
  DCs are generated by rapid (24–48 h) differentiation of monocytes using GM-CSF and
  interleukin-15 (IL-15), followed by maturation induction for 16–20 h through triggering
  of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8 signaling pathway (B).
