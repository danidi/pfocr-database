caption: 'A working model for the CblSTR signal transduction pathway. (i) Upon receiving
  a signal from the environment via their periplasmic domains, the CblS and/or CblT
  hybrid sensor kinases undergo autophosphorylation at the histidine H322 or H344
  residues, respectively, catalyzed by hydrolysis of ATP by the transmitter domain.
  It is also possible that CblS and CblT form homodimers and/or heterodimers, which
  may lead to cross-phosphorylation. (ii) Phosphotransfer reactions (indicated by
  arrows and circled P) are carried out between the transmitter, receiver, and HPt
  domains of CblS and CblT. The transfers of phosphoryl groups may occur intramolecularly
  and/or intermolecularly. (iii) The aspartate D60 in the receiver domain of the CblR
  response regulator is phosphorylated through interactions with the CblT HPt domain,
  leading to activation of CblR and transcription of the cblBACDS operon, possibly
  by directly binding the cblB promoter. Abbreviations: HPt, histidine phosphotransfer
  domain; HTH, helix-turn-helix domain; PBPb, bacterial periplasmic substrate-binding
  protein domain; Cp, cytoplasm; CM, cytoplasmic membrane; Pp, periplasm; OM, outer
  membrane.'
