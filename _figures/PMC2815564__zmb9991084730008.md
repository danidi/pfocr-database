caption: Conserved interactions of the ESCRT machinery with components of the Pal/Rim
  signaling pathway and retroviral Gag proteins. A schematic representation (not to
  scale) of the two components of the Pal/Rim pathway in S. cerevisiae, Rim8 and Rim101
  (PalF and PacC in A. nidulans), and the retroviral Gag proteins of Rous sarcoma
  virus (RSV), HIV-1, and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) shows the positions
  of the PXY, SXP, and YPX(L/I) motifs in the yeast proteins and the related PPXY,
  P(S/T)AP, and YPXL motifs in retroviral Gag proteins. Protein monoubiquitination
  is indicated. The conservation of the ESCRT machinery and associated proteins in
  fungi and vertebrates is highlighted. Double arrows indicate protein-protein interactions.
