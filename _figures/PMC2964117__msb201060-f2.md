caption: Small-molecule inhibition of the parasite nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase
  (NMNAT). (A) Schematic of the P. falciparum NAD(P) synthesis and recycling pathway
  determined from the genome sequence. Nicotinamide (NM) and nicotinic acid (NA) can
  be scavenged from the host. Compound 1_03 is an inhibitor targeting NMNAT. (B) Compound
  1_03 causes growth arrest of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum. Cultures were resuspended
  in niacin-free medium containing 0 or 100 μM of compound 1_03 at early ring stage
  and observed for 66 h (see Materials and methods). Untreated parasites undergo normal
  development and reinvasion, whereas drug-treated parasites arrest at the trophozoite
  (‘troph') stage and do not reinvade. NM, nicotinamide; NA, nicotinic acid; NaMN,
  nicotinate mononucleotide; NaAD, nicotinate adenine dinucleotide; NAD(P)+, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), reduced; NMase, nicotinamidase; NPRT, nicotinate
  phosphoribosyltransferase; NMNAT, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase;
  NADS, NAD synthase; NADK, NAD kinase.
