caption: Schematic diagram of LIM kinase-dependent inhibition of n-cofilin activity
  by Reelin. Binding of Reelin to the transmembrane receptor ApoER2 induces reciprocal
  activation (arrows) of the receptor-associated cytosolic adapter protein Disabled-1
  (Dab1) and neuronal Src family kinases (SFKs). This leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K), which is required for the phosphorylation of LIM kinase1 (LIMK)
  at threonine 508 through unknown upstream regulators (dotted arrow). The subsequent
  phosphorylation at serine 3 renders n-cofilin unable to depolymerize F-actin, thereby
  contributing to stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in the leading processes
  of migrating neurons in the developing cortical plate (). This pathway is primarily
  mediated by ApoER2, whose genetic ablation blocks Reelin-dependent phosphorylation
  of cofilin, whereas the second Reelin lipoprotein receptor, VLDLR, seems to be dispensable
  ( E, F). Other Reelin-induced signaling cascades that potentially modulate the actin
  cytoskeleton and microtubule stability include the activation of the small GTPase
  Rap1 and the inhibition of the Tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), which
  involves the PI3K-dependent activation of the protein kinase Akt (; ; ). C3G, Crk
  SH3-binding guanine nucleotide-releasing protein; mTor, mammalian target of rapamycin.
