caption: The GSR in Alphaproteobacteria is regulated by the sigma factor EcfG, which
  is sequestered by the anti-sigma factor NepR in the inactive state (top). Activation
  of the pathway via phosphorylation of the response regulator PhyR (bottom) leads
  to freeing of the sigma-like domain of PhyR, which titrates NepR away from EcfG,
  allowing it to bind to EcfG binding sequences in the genome and turn on transcription
  of multiple genes.
