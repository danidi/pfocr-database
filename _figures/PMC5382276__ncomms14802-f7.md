caption: The TNF pathway activates the translocation to the nucleus of NFKB1. Upstream
  unknown factors, bind to closed DNA, making SE constituents accessible to NFKB1
  binding, which in turn activate SEs and recruit BRD4 to these SEs promoting the
  interaction between the distal SE(s) and the promoter of the gene to initiate transcription.
  Dotted lines indicate indirect interactions while solid lines indicate direct interactions.
