caption: Model for biphasic expression and up-regulation of HWP1 at the bud-hypha
  transition. (A) In the initial-expression phase, environmental signals activate
  undetermined signal transduction pathways, allowing for small-scale HWP1 gene expression
  as shown by the gray arrow. Stabilized actin is not required for this gene expression.
  This initial HWP1 expression occurs simultaneously with polarization events resulting
  from Cdc42 interactions with Bni1 in conjunction with other proteins, such as Mea1p,
  that lead to localized Hwp1 deposition on the cell wall surface. While Cdc42 interactions
  with Bni1 may be promoting formin-based actin filamentation at this stage, HWP1
  gene expression is not contingent on the presence of these filaments. (B) Actin
  structures play a direct role in the amplification and sustaining phase. Bni1-nucleated
  F-actin aggregates act as a platform for Srv2/Cap1 aggregation, which in turn serves
  as a regulatory conduit in the activation of the cAMP pathway and its effectors,
  leading to the production of ROS. These cAMP/PKA effectors are joined by a number
  of independently up-regulated activators and down-regulated repressors (, , , ,
  , , ) that may act upon HWP1 in a direct or indirect manner. Work by other groups
  has suggested that these factors may be regulated in part by Cdc42 (, , , ). These
  changes in regulatory factor expression allow for increased HWP1 gene expression
  levels in response to various environmental signals, as represented by the large
  black arrow.
