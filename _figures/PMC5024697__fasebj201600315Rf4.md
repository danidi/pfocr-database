caption: 'Dysregulation of glycolysis and bioenergetic pathways in PBMCs from asymptomatic
  and FXTAS-symptomatic premutation-bearing individuals. In control cells, glucose
  is mainly used by oxphos, followed by glycolysis (as judged by ATP production) with
  almost negligible values shunted to the pentose phosphate pathway. The production
  of ATP is mainly derived from mitochondria compared to that of glycolysis (2-fold).
  In cells from premutation carriers, the glycolytic flux is enhanced with glucose
  also shunted to the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH to provide reducing
  equivalents to the antioxidant defenses. Some pyruvate is directed to mitochondria
  in cells from FXTAS-free premutation but, because of higher uncoupling and lower
  citrate synthase of these cells compared to controls, the ratio of mitochondrial
  ATP to glycolytic is 0.6. Proteomic data supported a more predominant role for the
  second half of the Krebs cycle (from α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate) probably sustained
  by the anaplerosis of Glu/Gln (as judged by the higher abundance of glutamate dehydrogenase).
  The ensuing lower production of citrate may result in lower fatty acid and cholesterol
  syntheses as well as arachidonate-derived products (prostaglandins). Oxaloacetate
  will be then used to generate Asp, Ala, pyruvate, and others. In the case of cells
  from carriers affected with FXTAS, a more significant flux of glucose is shunted
  to the pentose phosphate pathway (higher abundance of glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase
  than controls and FXTAS-free carriers) and glycolysis (higher levels of glycolytic
  ATP than controls but not than FXTAS-free carriers). The production of ATP is mainly
  glycolytic (ratio of mitochondrial ATP to glycolytic is 2.75) supported by the higher
  uncoupling (vs. controls and FXTAS-free carriers) and lower citrate synthase (vs.
  controls) of these cells. Based on proteomic data, lower overall Krebs cycle activity
  is expected with (based on functional data) increased production of mitochondrial
  ROS and increased proton leak. The total ATP levels are visualized as a bar in which
  the proportion of ATP derived from glycolysis is depicted in black and that of oxphos
  in white. The bars representing the ATP content in cells from carriers, are characterized
  as a percentage of that in control cells, to visualize the lower ATP content of
  these cells (61 and 49% of controls, for FXTAS-free and -affected carriers, respectively).
  Thicker and thinner arrows symbolize increased and decreased fluxes, respectively.
