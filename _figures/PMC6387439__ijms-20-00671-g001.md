caption: 'Salicylic acid biosynthesis and signaling pathway. (A) Proposed model for
  salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Upper panel: the isochorismate
  pathway revealed by genetic studies. Lower panel: the phenylpropanoid pathway revealed
  by biochemical studies. (B) A simplified model for the SA signaling pathway according
  to Ding et al. [] and Mou et al. []. In cells with low SA levels, NPR1 forms oligomer
  and remains in the cytosol, NPR3 and NPR4 bind residual NPR1 in the nucleus to prevent
  NPR1 function. In cell with high SA levels, NPR1 becomes monomeric and enters the
  nucleus, where SA binds to NPR3 and NPR4 to block their transcriptional repression
  activity. NPR1 interacts with TGAs in SA-responsive promoters, leading to the activation
  of defense responses. Abbreviations: BA2H, benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase; ICS, isochorismate
  synthase; IPL, isochorismate pyruvate lyase; NPR, non-expresser of pathogenesis-related
  genes; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; SA, salicylic acid; TGA, TGACG-binding
  factor.'
