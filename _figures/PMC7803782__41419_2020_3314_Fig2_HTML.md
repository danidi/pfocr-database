caption: 'Notch receptor involved in several biological processes has three domains:
  NECD, NTD, and NICD. The NECD comprises a set of EGF-like repeats which undergo
  glycosylation. (1) The properly folded EGF repeats of NECD are modified with glycans
  added by glycan-specific enzymes and (2) these glycans are further extended in the
  Golgi apparatus or even also in the ER. (3) Sugar decorated Notch is transported
  to the cell membrane through membrane-bound vesicles. (4) After ligand (Delta, Jagged)
  binding, the ADAM proteases and γ-secretases execute Notch S2 and S3 cleavage, respectively,
  ultimately releasing the NICD that moves to the nucleus (5) where it binds the Notch
  pathway effector proteins to induce the expression of Notch target genes.'
