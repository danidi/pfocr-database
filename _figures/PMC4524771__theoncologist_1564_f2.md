caption: 'Proposed anticancer effects of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) involving
  the mevalonate pathway. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the mevalonate
  pathway. This pathway is not only responsible for membrane and glycoprotein synthesis
  but also results in protein isoprenylation, a process that is required for proper
  functioning of cell signaling cascades including those of the Ras oncoprotein. Reproduced
