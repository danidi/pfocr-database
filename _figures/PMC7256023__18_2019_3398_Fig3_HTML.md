caption: The TCA cycle is active in TGFβ-induced EMT. The TCA cycle occurs in the
  matrix of mitochondria and is a key metabolic pathway for providing intermediates
  to generate glucose, amino acids, lipids, nucleotides and most importantly, ATP.
  Altered activity of fumarate hydratase (FH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and
  isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are connected to EMT. The chromatin-remodeling factor
  lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH) can promote EMT through recruiting the epigenetic
  silencer factor G9a to suppress FH expression. Furthermore, the accumulation of
  fumarate also enhances EMT by inhibiting miR-200. Reduced levels of SDHB stimulate
  EMT by activating the TGFβ signaling pathway. IDH converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate
  but the oncogenic IDHR132H leads to the production of the oncometabolite 2HG. 2HG
  interferes with chromatin remodeling enzymes and downregulates miR-200 expression
  via inhibition of TET, subsequently stimulating EMT
