caption: CdGAP mediates cross talk between the Ras/MAPK pathway and the regulation
  of Rac1 activity. Upon PDGF stimulation, Ras activates the MAPK pathway, leading
  to gene expression and phosphorylation of many cytoplasmic and membrane proteins.
  In addition, Ras causes cytoskeleton remodeling by activating a guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor (Tiam-1) for Rac1. We propose that ERK downregulation of CdGAP activity
  is an additional mechanism by which Ras can maintain active Rac1 in response to
  growth factor stimulation.
