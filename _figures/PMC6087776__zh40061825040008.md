caption: 'Summary of the role of muscle-specific A-kinase anchoring protein (mAKAP)
  polymorphisms in the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. A: the S1653R single-nucleotide
  polymorphism, named here as a mAKAP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) mutant, showed lower
  cAMP levels coupled with higher PDE4D3 binding at baseline. These changes might
  be the possible reasons for lower PKA activity. When stimulated, along with lower
  PDE4D3 binding, cAMP levels and PKA activity were found to be abruptly higher. B:
  E2124G, named here as a mAKAP-PKA mutant, showed lower PKA binding at baseline with
  no changes in cAMP levels and PKA activity. After stimulation, coupled with significantly
  higher PKA binding and abrupt cAMP increase, PKA activity was found to be significantly
  higher. PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A.'
