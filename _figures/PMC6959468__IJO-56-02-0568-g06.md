caption: IPA further clusters the biological functions that may be exerted by each
  sub-network of transcriptional regulators to find a common regulatory-function network.
  The important role of FASN in the overall regulatory network is through its involvement
  in processes including cell migration, cell proliferation and tumor necrosis, and
  its association with a variety of signaling pathways. IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis;
  FASN, fatty acid synthase.
