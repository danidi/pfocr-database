caption: Molecular mechanisms in allergic inflammation. Epithelial leakiness and activation
  and their proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine (TNF‐α, IL‐13, TSLP, IL‐25, IL‐33)
  production induce inflammation and contribute to the Th2 response. Highly activated
  epithelial cells undergo apoptosis and shedding takes place. Chemokines are essential
  players for the recruitment of inflammatory cells followed by survival and reactivation
  of migrating inflammatory cells and their interaction with resident tissue cells
  and other inflammatory cells. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) play a role in T‐ and
  B‐cell activation and recruitment and are early providers of type 2 cytokines and
  T‐cell recruitment‐related chemokines. The Th2 type of an immune microenvironment
  is characterized by IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐9, IL‐13, IL‐25, IL‐33 production by Th2 cells,
  ILCs, mast cells, and tissue cells. Eosinophilia is induced by IL‐5, IL‐25, and
  IL‐33. Local and systemic IgE production takes place in allergic patients with the
  involvement of IL‐4 and IL‐13. Other effector T‐cell subsets, such as Th9, Th17,
  and Th22 cells, also play partial roles in inflammation, mucus production, and tissue
  healing. Smooth muscle, myofibroblast activation, and bronchial hyperreactivity
  are related to IL‐4, IL‐9, IL‐13, IL‐25, and IL‐33. Several chemokines, and arachidonic
  acid pathway molecules and other small molecules play roles in the inflammatory
  cell recruitment and further augmentation of the inflammatory cascades. Treg and
  Breg cells play a role on control of inflammation and extensive cellular activation
  by using IL‐10 and TGF‐β as well as many other suppressive mechanisms
