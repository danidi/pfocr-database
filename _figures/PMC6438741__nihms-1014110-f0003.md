caption: In large pre-B cells, IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) signalling activates AKT and
  the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)
  pathway. This inhibits Iglk gene transcription and accessibility, inhibits recombination-activating
  gene (RAG) expression by causing degradation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1)
  and promotes proliferation and survival of large pre-B cells, in part, through inhibition
  of the apoptosis regulator BAX by PIM1-mediated and AKT-mediated phosphorylation
  of BCL-2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD). b | In small pre-B cells, loss
  of IL-7R signalling leads to increased activity of tyrosine protein kinase SYK and
  B cell linker protein (BLNK), which augments signalling through the pre-B cell receptor
  (pre-BCR), leading to the induction of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) expression
  and induction of Iglk gene transcription and accessibility. Loss of AKT signals
  results in FOXO1-driven expression of Rag1 and Rag2 and loss of IL-7R-mediated proliferative
  and survival signals. Pre-BCR signals can also drive proliferation, although not
  as strongly as IL-7R signals. c | The initiation of Iglk gene rearrangement and
  the generation of RAG double-strand breaks (DSBs) leads to the activation of ataxia
  telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which initiates both a canonical DNA damage response
  (cDDR) and a non-canonical DNA damage response (ncDDR). The ncDDR is mediated, in
  part, by the activation of a nuclear factor-κB1 (NF-κB1)-dependent and NF-κB2-dependent
  genetic programme. The induction of SPIC represses Iglk gene transcription and antagonizes
  pre-BCR signals by inhibiting SYK and BLNK expression. This ncDDR genetic programme
  also promotes survival through the induction of PIM2, which phosphorylates BAD to
  inhibit BAX. p53 and PIM2 also enforce the G1 to S checkpoint. ATM activation leads
  to reduced Rag expression through inhibition of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible
  protein GADD45α expression and through direct phosphorylation and inhibition of
  RAG2. RAG DSBs also trigger an ncDDR that inhibits the production of IL-7 by local
  stromal cells. Collectively, these ncDDR pathways prevent the generation of additional
  RAG DSBs, promote survival and block proliferation in cells with existing RAG DSBs.
