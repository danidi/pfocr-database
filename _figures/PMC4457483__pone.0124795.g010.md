caption: The pentose phosphate pathway generates NADPH, ribose 5-phosphate, and intermediates
  of the glycolytic pathway. The NADPH is utilized for reductive pathways, such as
  fatty acid biosynthesis and the glutathione defense system against injury by reactive
  oxygen species. Ribose 5-phosphate provides the sugar for nucleotide synthesis.
  Increased levels of pentose phosphate intermediates may indicate altered glucose
  and/or nucleotide metabolism.
