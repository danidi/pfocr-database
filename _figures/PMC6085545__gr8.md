  Proliferating human DAECs and their fate after induction and feeder removal in vitro.
  Treating the cells with high doses of the Notch pathway inhibitor dibenzazepine

  epithelial cell phenotype. (B) Lineage-negative epithelial progenitors (LNEPs) and

  upon tissue damage in mice (e.g. influenza infection) [, , ]. Vaughan et al. proposed
  that murine LNEPs require Notch signalling to activate the ΔNp63 and CK5 program,
  and conversely Notch blockade promotes generation of alveolar epithelial cells [].Abbreviations:
