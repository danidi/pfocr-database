caption: 'Glutamine/glutamate utilization in proliferating cells. Glutamine (Gln)
  and glutamate (Glu), shown in dark green text, donate carbon and/or nitrogen to
  diverse biosynthetic processes in proliferating cells. Glutamine is taken up from
  the extracellular environment by a number of SLC superfamily transporters, or synthesized
  de novo from glutamate and ammonia by glutamine synthetase (GLUL). A heterodimer
  of SLC7A5 (LAT1) and SLC3A2 couples glutamine efflux to uptake of aromatic and branched-chain
  amino acids, and SLC7A11 (xCT) couples glutamate efflux to cystine uptake. In the
  cytosol, glutamine donates its amide nitrogen (yielding glutamate) to a number of
  biosynthetic reactions catalyzed by glutamine amidotransferases, including reactions
  in the purine, pyrimidine and hexosamine biosynthetic pathways and also the asparagine
  synthetase reaction. In the mitochondrion, glutamine is converted to glutamate by
  glutaminases (GLS or GLS2), with the amide nitrogen released as ammonia. Cytosolic
  and mitochondrial glutamate can exchange via the aspartate/glutamate carrier SLC25A13.
  In the cytosol, glutamate together with glycine and cysteine form the antioxidant
  tripeptide glutathione. Reversible transaminases, some of which have cytosolic and
  mitochondrial isoforms, interchange glutamate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), coupled
  to the interchange of α-ketoacids and amino acids including serine, alanine and
  aspartate. In the mitochondrion, glutamate can also be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase
  (GLUD1/2) to yield α-KG and ammonia. Glutamate can also be directly incorporated
  in the proline synthesis pathway. Thick blue arrows indicate multistep pathways
  and blue text indicates their products. Abbreviations: AA, amino acids;α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
