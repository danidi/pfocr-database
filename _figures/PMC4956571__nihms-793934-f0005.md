caption: Integrin αvβ3 a receptor for extracellular matrix proteins on bone metastatic
  tumor cells bind to osteopontin expressed by bone stromal cells causing activation
  of FAK, which recruits other signaling molecules including c-Src. C-Src enhances
  proliferation and survival through JNK pathway by phosphorylating CAS in addition
  to the recruitment of BMDCs by phosphorylating integrin β3. [FAK, focal adhesion
  kinase; CAS, Crk-associated substrate; BMDC, bone marrow derived cells]
