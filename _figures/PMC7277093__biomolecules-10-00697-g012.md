caption: 'Multiple modes of AOAA’s action on H2S producing pathways and other transaminases
  in cancer cells. AOAA suppresses cellular H2S levels by directly inhibiting CBS
  and CSE activity, by suppressing H2S formation through the 3-MST pathway via inhibition
  of cysteine amino transferase (CAT), and by inhibiting the non-enzymatic formation
  of H2S from vitamin B6 or PLP. In addition, AOAA also inhibits a variety of transaminases
  (including GOT1, a key enzyme of the malate/aspartate shuttle). In a cancer cell,
  these combined effects of AOAA may produce synergistic inhibition of cellular bioenergetics,
  resulting in an impairment of cancer cell proliferation and viability. By inhibiting
  CBS-derived and 3-MST-derived H2S, AOAA suppresses mitochondrial electron transport
  and cancer cell bioenergetics by preventing the donation electrons at complex II,
  by suppressing the H2S-induced direct stimulation of ATP synthase and by lifting
  the H2S-mediated inhibition of intramitochondrial adenylate cyclase (this latter
  effect is not shown on this scheme). The malate-aspartate shuttle translocates electrons
  that are produced in glycolysis across the semipermeable inner membrane of the mitochondrion
  to support oxidative phosphorylation. These electrons enter the electron transport
  chain at Complex I. The shuttle system is required because the mitochondrial inner
  membrane is impermeable to NADH (a primary reducing equivalent of the electron transport
  chain). In humans, the cytoplasmic enzyme (GOT1) is one of the key enzymes in the
  malate shuttle: it catalyzes the interconversion of aspartate and α-ketoglutarate
  to oxaloacetate and glutamate using PLP as a cofactor. By inhibiting GOT, AOAA reduces
  the transfer of electron donors to the mitochondria, thereby providing an additional
  mode for the suppression of cancer cell bioenergetics. Finally, many tumors up-regulate
  their metabolism through glutaminolysis. In this process, glutamine is taken up
  into the cells, and it rapidly deaminated by deaminases to yield glutamate (the
  uptake and the conversion is not shown in the current scheme). In turn, glutamate
  (Glu) is converted by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymes, in particular by glutamate
  pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) to α-ketoglutarate and enters the TCA cycle. Because
  AOAA inhibits ALT/GPT2, this process is inhibited, and the tumor cells become deprived
  from an important metabolic fuel. The current figure is a modified version of a
  figure that was reproduced by permission from [].'
