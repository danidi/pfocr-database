caption: Schematic diagram of different steps of autophagy. Autophagy is initiated
  by inactivation of the mTOR pathway and induction of numerous autophagy-related
  proteins. Pre-autophagosome synthesis involves the coupling of LC3 with ULK1 and
  Vps34 proteins. Importantly, AMPK-mTOR signaling are involved to initiate pre-autophagosome
  or phagosphore formation. Sometimes, mTOR independent pathways are associated to
  initiate phagosphore formation. Subsequently, the pre-autophagosome forms the double
  membrane vesicle that sequesters cytoplasmic contents and forms the mature autophagosome.
  Finally, the mature autophagosomes fuse with the lysosomes wherein the contents
  are degraded and recycled back into the cytoplasm which may further be used as nutrients.
