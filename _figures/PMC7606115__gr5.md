caption: Mitochondrial death includes apoptosis and necroptosis. Apoptosis is regulated
  by outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) permeabilization, mitochondrial membrane potential
  reduction, caspase-9 activation. Necroptosis is induced by the activation of RIPK3/MLKL
  pathway and the mPTP opening. Then, mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction
  and tricarboxylic acid cycle termination contribute to ATP exhaustion, cytoplasmic
  swelling, and membrane rupture.
