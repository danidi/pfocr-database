caption: Simplified scheme of the reactions involved in triacylglycerol biosynthesis
  in seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana.Fatty acids are synthesised in the plastids, and
  16:0 and 18:1 are massively exported toward the cytosolic compartment as CoA esters.
  Glycerol backbones are derived from cytosolic dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)
  through the action of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The enzymes of the Kennedy
  pathway catalyse triacylglycerol assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. The contribution
  of the acyl-CoA independent phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) is
  presented. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FAD2, oleoyl desaturase; FAD3, linoleoyl desaturase.
  Letters in a diamond indicate metabolic links with pathways presented on figures
  2 and 3
