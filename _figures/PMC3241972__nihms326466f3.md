caption: Sufficient mTOR activity induces effector CD4 T helper subsets. On the other
  hand, a complete or strong block of the signaling prevents the generation of these
  effector cells, instead promotes Treg differentiation. The effects of partial inhibition
  of mTOR activity in vivo on effector versus regulatory T cell differentiation are
  not fully understood. The role of mTOR pathway in development of Tfh as well as
  memory CD4 T cells is yet to be defined.
