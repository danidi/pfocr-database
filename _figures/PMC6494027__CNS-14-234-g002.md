caption: Proposed metabolic pathway of resveratrol. Metabolites were identified in
  rat or human urine and in human liver microsomes. The asterisk indicates the metabolites
  identified as cis‐ and trans‐isomers but were excluded for image clarity. Cis‐isomers
  are glucuronidated and sulfated faster than trans‐isomers. Data obtained by Piver
  et al. [], Wang et al. [], and Urpi‐Sarda et al. [].
