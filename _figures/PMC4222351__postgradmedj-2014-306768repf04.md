caption: P-21 activated kinase (PAK)1 in canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signalling.
  NF-κB signalling regulates transcription of target genes via two separate cascades
  known as the canonical and non-canonical pathways. In the canonical pathway, TNFα
  elicits PAK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation. Subsequent phosphorylation
  of IKKα/β by JNK initiates phosphorylation of IκB. Consequently, RelA is released
  from the IκB complex and translocates into the nucleus. IκB is tagged by ubiquitin
  for proteasomal degradation. LPS is a known activator of non-canonical NF-κB signalling.
  LPS may elicit PAK1 activation through an unknown mechanism. PAK1 phosphorylates
  and activates NF-κB interacting kinase (NIK), which activates IKKα. In turn, IKKα
  phosphorylates p100 and the p100–RelB complex is released. P100 is processed into
  p52 which dimerises with RelB and translocates to the nucleus to activate target
  genes.
