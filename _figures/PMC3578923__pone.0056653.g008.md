caption: In red genes associated with MSUD and in blue pathophenotypic similar genes.
  (A) Pathophenotypic similarity gene sub-network for MSUD causing genes. It can be
  noteworthy that there are no inferred relationships between MSUD genes and the rest.
  (B) Map of branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway from. This map has been
  extracted from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, hsa:00280) developed
  by Kanehisa Laboratories. Enzymes encoded by human genes are in green. (C) Pathophenotypes
  shared between genes in the same metabolic module.
