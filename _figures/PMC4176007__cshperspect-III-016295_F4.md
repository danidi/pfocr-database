number: Figure 4
caption: IL-6 receptor system and IL-6 blocker, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody
  tocilizumab. IL-6 binds to soluble and transmembrane IL-6R and the complex, then
  induces homodimerization of gp130, leading to activation of the signaling system.
  A humanized anti-IL-6R antibody, tocilizumab, blocks IL-6-mediated signaling pathway
  by its inhibition of IL-6 binding to both receptors. JAKs, Janus kinases; SHP-2,
  SH2-domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2.
