caption: Model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis and assembly pathways for Gram-negative
  bacteria and a schematic representing the predicted functional role(s) of PbgA/YejM
  in phospholipid trafficking, remodeling, and homeostasis. The left side of the model
  shows the LPS biogenesis pathway for Salmonella enterica (blue background). Briefly,
  LPS is synthesized from two precursors, lipid A-core molecules and O antigens, by
  two pathways. LPS assembly involves the ligation of O antigens to lipid A-core molecules
  and results in the formation of short, long, and very long LPS modalities for S.
  Typhimurium. O-antigen synthesis begins at the inner leaflet of the inner membrane
  (IM) by a sequential transfer of monosaccharides from sugar-nucleotide donor molecules
  to the undecaprenyl phosphate carrier (Und-PP carrier or C55-PP) lipid to form a
  Und-PP-linked unit. In S. Typhimurium, the repeating unit is a four-residue branched
  structure (galactose [Gal], rhamnose [Rha], mannose [Man], abequose [Abe]) synthesized
  by the glycosyltransferases (GTs) WbaP, WbaN, WbaU, and WbaV, respectively. Lipid
  A-core biosynthesis begins in the cytoplasm and continues in parallel with O-antigen
  synthesis upon the IM inner leaflet, evoking nine conserved enzymes of the Raetz
  pathway. Two 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) residues are added to serve
  as acceptors for the sugar groups composing the core oligosaccharide. The flippase
  MsbA inverts lipid A-core molecules into the periplasmic leaflet of the IM. Next,
  the O-antigen and lipid A-core structures are joined with WaaL also known as RfaL
  into one LPS superstructure. The Lpt complex spans the dual bilayers of the envelope
  and drives unidirectional LPS transport across the periplasm. The right side of
  the model depicts the predicted PbgA also known as YejM involvement in the phospholipid
  trafficking pathways necessary for Enterobacteriaceae to catalyze cyclopropane ring
  formation on phospholipids during stress (yellow background). Cyclopropanated fatty
  acids (Cfa) are formed by the addition of a methylene group from S-adenosylmethionine
  (S-AdoMet) across the carbon-carbon double bond of unsaturated fatty acids. This
  takes place at the cytosolic surface of the IM and is catalyzed by Cfa, which functions
  as a dimer. For bacteria to remodel unsaturated fatty acids on the phospholipids
  that exist within the inner leaflet of the OM at the time of stress, they must traffic
  the molecules back to the IM and somehow invert them into the cytosolic leaflet.
  Many protein systems involved in these trafficking mechanisms remain undiscovered,
  but the Mla system is the most well studied example of an intermembrane bacterial
  phospholipid transport system. VL O-Ag, L O-Ag, and S O-Ag, very long, long, and
  short O antigens, respectively; LOS, lipooligosaccharide.
