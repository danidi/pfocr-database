caption: Viral invasion into the cells leads to the appearance of viral RNA fragments
  in cytosol, which are detected by RLR monomers. Either binding or linkage of polyubiquitin
  would stabilize the active RLR / vRNA complex, which with the support of zyxin,
  is able to interact with inactive MAVS on mitochondria, freeing the MAVS CARD domains
  for forming helical filaments. The helical filaments of MAVS serve as a platform
  for bringing downstream effectors together and activating IRF3 or NFκB, and inducing
  the production of IFNs. Adapted from Dr. Hui Xu’s PhD dissertation in .
