caption: The effect of stress and its relationship with Ras/Rac1/MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway and epigenetic mechanisms regulation. Ras/Rac1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway
  seems to be regulated by and regulates superoxide anion production during melan-a
  anchorage blockade, and its activation could be responsible for the high Dnmt1 protein
  level and changes in global DNA methylation during the loss of cell adhesion. Anchorage
  blockade might promote epigenetic reprogramming in order to adapt the melanocytic
  cells to the new microenvironmental condition and contribute to the acquisition
  of a malignant phenotype (from []).
