caption: Figure 1. Model of the regulation of STAT signaling by PC1. During renal
  development, membrane-anchored, full-length PC1 may cause direct activation of STAT1
  and STAT3 via JAK2 that is associated with its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Direct
  STAT1/3 activation by PC1 would be an intrinsic pathway that is independent of growth
  factors. It is currently unknown how the direct activation of STAT1/3 by full-length
  PC1 is regulated. It is possible that an—as yet unidentified—extracellular ligand
  may trigger STAT1/3 activation, or that the extracellular domain of PC1 engages
  in homotypic interactions. It is also possible that fluid flow may regulate this
  activity. During renal injury and in PKD, PC1 appears to undergo proteolytic cleavage
  that releases its cytoplasmic tail into the cytoplasm. This turns “off” the ability
  of the remaining membrane-anchored portion of PC1 to activate STAT1/3. However,
  the soluble PC1 tail can now translocate to the nucleus and co-activate STAT3 that
  has been activated by prior growth factor signaling. In addition to STAT3, the cleaved
  PC1 tail can also co-activate STAT6 (bottom) and STAT1 (not shown here). Therefore,
  the cleaved PC1 tail would have the ability to amplify different signaling pathways
  that lead to different cellular responses depending on the growth factor and cytokine
  environment.
