number: Figure 4
caption: 'The average CV per metabolic pathway for the Development and Abiotic microarray
  studies are plotted with the significance of each spot within the two studies represented
  by both color and shape: Pink squares = pathways with a significant deviation from
  the whole genome in both studies; red diamonds = deviation from the whole genome
  in Abiotic only; dark blue diamonds = deviation from the whole genome in Developmental
  only; light blue circles = no observed deviation from the whole genome average.
  The inset expands the lower left part of the graph. Significantly differing pathways
  are annotated to indicate biosynthesis (‘bio’) or degradation (‘deg’). GLS stands
  for glucosinolate. FAE stands for fatty acid elongation. CN stands for cyanate.'
