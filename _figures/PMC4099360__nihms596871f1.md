caption: 'A. Strong activation of the TLR4-MD2 receptor complex is achieved when smooth
  and rough LPS first bind to LBP and CD14 to then trigger TLR4-MD2 activation. This
  activation is mediated by a conformational change of MD2 after LPS binding resulting
  in TLR4 dimerization and activation of two major pathways: I. MyD88-induced signals
  (marked in orange) predominantly activate NF-κB, IRF-7 and JNK. II Trif-dependent
  signals (marked in blue) predominantly activate NF-κB and IRF-3. B. Rough LPS and
  free Lipid A may induce TLR4 activation even in the absence of LBP and CD14. This
  pathway leads to TLR4 activation that is restricted to the MyD88 pathway, and results
  in a lower amplitude activation. Abbreviations: IRF-7, interferon regulatory factor-7;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa B; TLR, toll-like receptor; Trif TIR domain-containing adapter inducing
  IFNβ; LBP, LPS-binding protein.'
