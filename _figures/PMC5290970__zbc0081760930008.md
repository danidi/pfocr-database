caption: Signaling switch between hyperglycemia and normoglycemia. During hyperglycemia,
  IRS-1 is down-regulated, and a signaling complex that includes SHP-2, p52shc, and
  Grb2 localizes on SHPS-1 in response to IGF-I receptor-mediated SHPS-1 tyrosine
  phosphorylation. This leads to MAPK and PI3K activation as well as specific pathophysiologic
  changes in vascular cell function. During normoglycemia, IGF-I signaling is mediated
  via the IRS-1/PI3K-dependent pathway, and the SHPS-1 signaling complex is not assembled.
  An important function of IRS-1 is to maintain vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation.
