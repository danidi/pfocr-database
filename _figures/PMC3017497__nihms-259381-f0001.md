caption: In haploid yeast cells, mating is initiated by the binding of pheromone to
  a G protein-coupled receptor. Gβγ (shown) then binds to the scaffold/adaptor protein
  Ste5. Ste5 binds to all three tiers of the MAPK cascade and promotes transmission
  of the mating signal via Ste20 (not shown) to Ste11 (MEKK) and thence to Ste7 (MEK).
  The pheromone receptor, the G protein, and Ste5 are all mating-pathway-specific
  components. In filamentous invasive growth, unknown filamentation-pathway-specific
  components couple to the Ste20-Ste11-Ste7-Kss1 MAPK cascade. Nutrient limitation
  signals initiate filamentation () but if or how these couple to the MAPK cascade
  is unclear.(A) In the model (; ), Fus3 is presumed to be the MAPK for mating; Fus3,
  but not Kss1, is activated by the pheromone response pathway. Activation of Fus3
  stimulates transcription of mating genes, driven by pheromone response elements
  (PREs) as well as by G1 arrest (data not shown). Phosphorylation of Kss1 by the
  invasive growth pathway stimulates the transcription of genes driven by filamentation
  response elements (FREs; ).(B) The model suggests that in the absence of Fus3, Kss1
  gains illicit access to the mating pathway and is thereby activated by pheromone
  stimulation. Mating proceeds, albeit at reduced efficiency. However, filamentation-specific
  genes (driven by FREs) are now erroneously induced by mating pheromone.
