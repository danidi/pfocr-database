caption: In response to environmental or host signals, the core ESCRT machinery (ESCRT-I,
  II and III) participates with PKA to activate Rim101 and influence capsule attachment
  via regulation of cell wall composition. The bulk of the ESCRT influence on capsule
  formation occurs through activation of Rim101 given the shared defects in attachment.
  PKA may make a contribution to capsule formation in addition to its influence on
  Rim101 because expression of the N-terminal portion of Rim101 in double mutants
  defective for both the regulatory subunit of PKA and ESCRT functions (e.g., vps23
  pkr1) did not restore capsule size to the level of the pkr1 mutant (). Additionally,
  the cAMP/PKA pathway is known to influence the transcription of genes for capsule
  synthesis as well as components of the secretory pathway (; ). The ESCRT machinery
  contributes to iron acquisition from haem via Rim101 and Cig1-dependent and independent
  mechanisms. ESCRT mutants have a growth defect on haem and expression of the N-terminal
  portion of Rim101 in the mutants only slightly improved growth. The remaining growth
  defect may reflect a requirement for ESCRT participation in endocytosis of haem,
  and the minor improvement with activation of Rim101 may in part reflect the expression
  of Cig1 for haem uptake. The involvement of PKA is more complex because pka1 and
  pkr1 mutants do not show growth defects on haem (G. Hu, unpublished data).
