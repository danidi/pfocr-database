number: Figure 1
caption: (A) Schematic representation of the hypothesized downstream pathways to ASCL1
  and MYT1L during transdifferentiation. Also, the hypothesized KMT2B role is reported.
  (B) Schematic hypothesized myogenic pathway switched off by MYT1L during transdifferentiation.
  iN indicates induced neuronal cells; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
