caption: Workflow. Expression data as measured with microarrays or RNA-seq is tested
  for enrichment of specific functional gene sets, e.g. as defined in the Gene Ontology
  or the KEGG pathway annotation. Additional information from regulatory networks
  annotated in specific databases such as the RegulonDB or Yeastract can be exploited.
  Implemented methods can be carried out individually and combined by selected ranking
  criteria. Resulting gene set rankings can be browsed as HTML pages allowing detailed
  inspection (as illustrated in Fig. )
