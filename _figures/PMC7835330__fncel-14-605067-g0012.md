caption: Schematic diagram showing adenosine- and melatonin/dopamine-mediated circadian
  clock pathways in the fish retina. Results in this study show that a circadian clock
  in the retina itself increases extracellular adenosine at night. The retinal clock
  is proposed to increase energy metabolism at night so that the extracellular level
  of adenosine increases. This in turn enhances activation of A2ARs on rods and cones.
  As a result, intracellular cAMP and PKA activity levels in photoreceptors increase,
  thus enhancing the conductance of rod-cone gap junctions so that rod input to cones
  and then to cHCs is enhanced. Conversely, a clock-induced decrease in energy metabolism
  in the day lowers extracellular adenosine and A2AR activation. This lowers intracellular
  cAMP and PKA which closes rod-cone gap junctions so that rod input to cones and
  cHCs is decreased. This clock-controlled adenosine pathway is parallel to the clock-controlled
  melatonin/dopamine system. Previous work has shown that a retinal circadian clock
  increases melatonin synthesis and release during the night, which inhibits the release
  of dopamine from dopaminergic amacrine cells sufficiently so that D4Rs on photoreceptor
  cells are not activated. In contrast, the retinal clock decreases melatonin in the
  day, which enhances dopamine release, resulting in volume diffusion of dopamine
  throughout the retina and activation of D4Rs on rods and cones. This decreases intracellular
  cAMP and PKA activity levels in photoreceptors, which lowers the conductance of
  rod-cone gap junctions so that rod input to cones and cHCs is reduced. Note that
  separate circadian clocks may influence adenosine vs. melatonin/dopamine although
  one clock is depicted here controlling both pathways. See “Discussion” section for
  further details.
