caption: The linker region being targeted in this work is shown in the lower center
  region of the figure and the rhamnosyl biosynthetic pathway is shown in the lower
  right hand region of the figure. The two enzymes, RmlC and RmlD, which were screened
  for inhibitors herein, are shown in the boxed region of the rhamnosyl biosynthetic
  pathway.
