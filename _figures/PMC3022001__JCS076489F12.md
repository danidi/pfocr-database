caption: Schematic representation of effect of depletion of the syntaxin-5 complex
  on the autophagic pathway. The endoplasmic reticulum is the site of synthesis and
  maturation of proteins entering the secretory pathway. Depletion of the syntaxin-5
  SNARE complex impairs the ER-to-Golgi transport normally occurring in eukaryotic
  cells (light blue arrows). As a consequence, the anterograde transport and therefore
  the activity of lysosomal proteases is reduced, resulting in the lysosomal compartment
  dysfunction, accumulation of autophagosomes and decreased degradation of autophagic
  substrates.
