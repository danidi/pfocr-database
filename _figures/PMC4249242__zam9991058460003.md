caption: Schematic representation of the presumptive NAD+/NADH recycling mechanism
  adopted by strictly heterofermentative lactobacilli. Heterofermentative metabolism
  via the pentose-phosphate pathway generates 1 mol of ATP when acetyl phosphate (acetyl-P)
  is used as the electron acceptor to synthesize ethanol (A) or 2 mol of ATP in the
  presence of other electron acceptors (B), which enables additional ATP synthesis
  through the conversion of acetyl phosphate to acetate. Alternative electron acceptors
  suggested by this study are caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids, which may be
  reduced to dihydrocaffeic, phloretic, and dihydroferulic acids, respectively. glucose-6-P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; glyceraldehyde-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
