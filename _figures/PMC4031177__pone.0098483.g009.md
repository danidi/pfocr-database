caption: In response to an Ang II stimulus, TGF β-Smad signal pathway is activated
  in cardiac fibroblasts. More phosphorylation of Smad2 translocates into nucleus
  to form a Smad2-CBP complex, which might facilitate fibrotic gene transcription
  and accelerate cardiac fibroblast proliferation. Beraprost binds to cell surface
  prostacyclin receptor (IP), phosphorylates of CREB at Ser133 and translocates into
  nucleus of cardiac fibroblasts, which sequestrates CBP and then prevents Smad-related
  transcription from performing an anti-fibrotic response. Beraprost may also inhibit
  TGF β-Smad signal pathway directly to attenuate cardiac fibroblast proliferation
  but the detailed mechanism needs further study.
