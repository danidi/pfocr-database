caption: 'Extracellular Tau Undergoes Unconventional Secretion in Cell Lines and Induces
  Synaptic Deficits when Derived from Trisomy, Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)
  Neurons. (A) Work by Katsinelos et al. []: extracellular tau derived from its overexpression
  in neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines showed evidence
  of export via unconventional pathway secretion type 1 (UPS 1). The secretion of
  extracellular tau is facilitated by sulfated proteoglycans (PGs) at the cell surface,
  where tau clusters before its release into culture medium. Tau is then taken up
  by neighboring cells, where it appears to aggregate. Thus, the transcellular spread
  of tau follows UPS 1 secretion. (B) Work by Hu et al. []: extracellular tau and
  its fragments were found along with amyloid beta (Aβ) in secretomes of human-derived
  iPSCs differentiated into neurons with trisomy 21, modeling Alzheimer’s disease
  (AD). Secretomes injected into the rat brain caused synaptic dysfunction through
  extracellular tau. Immunodepletion of tau, but not Aβ, blocked secretome-induced
  synaptic deficits measured by in vivo electrophysiology. Of note, extracellular
  tau secreted from amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) duplication or PS1 mutation
  neurons did not induce acute synaptic deficits. Not shown in either panel are characteristics
  or mechanisms of tau not examined in the two studies, including vesicular tau secretion,
  mechanisms of tau uptake, aggregation and/or phosphorylation status of tau, or propagation
  of tau.'
