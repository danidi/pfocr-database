caption: Targeting cancer kinases with inhibitors in dementias. (1) The intracellular
  pathway involving Fyn kinase has been demonstrated to be altered in Alzheimer's
  disease (AD), in which Fyn modulates both amyloid beta (Aβ)‐driven synaptic dysfunction
  and neurotoxicity. At postsynaptic terminal, the extracellular soluble Aβ oligomers
  bind with nanomolar affinity to cellular prion protein (PrPC) on neuronal cell surface,
  thus triggering the activation of the downstream intracellular signaling pathway
  involving Fyn kinase. This activation of Fyn kinase by oligomeric Aβ‐PrPC, which
  requires the participation of mGluR5, leads to the activation of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate
  receptors (NMDA‐Rs) by phosphorylating their intracellular segment NR2B subunit,
  inducing dendritic spine loss. In addition, Fyn triggers the downstream phosphorylation
  of tau, by possibly contributing to neurofibrillary tangles formation. Saracatinib,
  a Fyn inhibitor, has been repurposed as disease‐modifying therapy in AD. (2) At
  neuronal cell surface, Aβ fibrils increase c‐Abl kinase activity, thus stimulating
  the nuclear translocation of c‐Abl and inducing apoptosis and neuronal loss through
  c‐Abl‐mediated p73 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the activation of c‐Abl kinase
  by Aβ fibrils promotes tau phosphorylation, both directly and indirectly, by activating
  the tau kinase Cdk5. c‐Abl has been found to be hyperactivated in human AD and PD
  brains, as well as in Lewy body dementia (LBD), and its inhibitor nilotinib has
  been repurposed for PD, LBD, and AD. Moreover, in neurons, the overactivation of
  GSK‐3β and p38α contributes to tau phosphorylation. Tideglusib, a GSK‐3 inhibitor,
  and neflamapimod, a p38α inhibitor, have been repurposed in AD as potential disease‐modifying
  therapies. Moreover, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently granted fast‐track
  designation to neflamapimod for the treatment of LBD. (3) In microglia, several
  extracellular and intracellular signals trigger the consequential activation of
  MAPK3, MAPK2, and p38α, stimulating the synthesis and release of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines, thus promoting neuroinflammatory processes. Neflamapimod has been investigated
  as therapeutic approach to counteract neuroinflammation in AD. Finally, the activation
  of the stem cell factor (SCF)/c‐kit pathway mediates neuroinflammatory responses
  and the c‐kit inhibitor, masitinib, has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment
  of rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and as add‐on therapy to riluzole in amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis
