caption: acu-3, acu-5 and acu-6 mutants are known to be lethal when acetate is the
  sole carbon source, because the glyoxylate cycle is blocked . We correctly predict
  these mutants can be rescued by sucrose, and we additionally predict they can be
  rescued when supplemented with fructofuranose and glucose, because the enzymes encoded
  by acu-3, acu-5, and acu-6 are upstream of these sugars in the gluconeogenesis pathway.
