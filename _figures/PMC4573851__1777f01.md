caption: The role of FANCM and partner proteins in coping with template lesions during
  DNA replication. MHF forms a complex with FANCM and FAAP24 and stabilizes FANCM.
  This complex localizes to ICL sites through its DNA-binding attribute. FANCM carries
  out several FA-independent functions at ICL sites and in other replication blockage
  situations. FANCM–MHF promote ICL traversal, allowing replication to proceed past
  the lesion without repair. FANCM also can catalyze replication fork regression under
  certain circumstances. In addition, FANCM and FAAP24 interact with the checkpoint
  protein HCLK2 to activate the ATR checkpoint signaling pathway (other means by which
  FANCM can promote checkpoint activation are not depicted here). In the FA pathway,
  FANCM–MHF–FAAP24 recruits the FA core complex to the ICL sites. The subsequent monoubiquitination
  of FANCI and FANCD2 leads to multiple repair steps, including ICL incision, DNA
  gap filling, and recombinational repair. The recruitment of the BLM–topoisomerase
  IIIα (Topo IIIα)–RMI (BTR) complex by FANCM enables double Holliday junction (dHJ)
  dissolution.
