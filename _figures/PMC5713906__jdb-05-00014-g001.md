caption: 'Schematic illustration of Hh signaling and how pathogens may modify pathway
  activity. (A) In the absence of Hh ligand, the receptor Ptch inhibits Smo activation.
  Ci/Gli is retained in the cytoplasm tethered to microtubules (in flies) or primary
  cilia (in mammals) through a complex of several proteins, simplistically termed
  here as “transcription factor inhibitory complex” (TFIC). This complex promotes
  Ci/Gli phosphorylation, which results in partial proteolysis to a repressor form
  that can readily enter the nucleus and repress expression of some Gli targets. (B)
  When Hh ligand binds to Ptch, inhibition upon Smo is relieved and the C-terminus
  of Smo is phosphorylated which promotes the release of Ci/Gli from the TFIC. The
  activated form of Gli/Ci can enter the nucleus and activate expression of Hh targets.
  Examples of canonical Gli target genes as well as those involved specifically in
  proliferation, immunity, and migration are given. Helicobacter Pylori (H.p.) has
  been proposed to act, in part, by repressing expression of the Hh ligand. Influenza
  NS1 and HBV X protein have been proposed to interact directly with Gli/Ci, but the
  precise mechanism by which they affect transcriptional activity has not been fully
  elucidated. The diagram also shows the pathway components which can be inhibited
  by FDA-approved small molecules: Vidmodegib and Sonidegib inhibit the activity of
  Smo, whereas arsenic trioxide (ATO) inhibits the activity of Gli1/2.'
