caption: 'PCSK9 and apoB-containing lipoproteins metabolism. PCSK9 regulates surface
  LDLR levels via targeting of both proteins to lysosomal degradation (1). The main
  consequence of the decreased PCSK9 interaction with the LDLR is the increase in
  the intracellular cholesterol pool which promotes: (2) a reduction of the activity
  of the SRE-dependent pathway and of intracellular cholesterol synthesis, (3) a reduction
  in the expression of non-SRE genes involved in lipogenesis, (4) a reduction of apoB
  lipidation, and (5) a reduction of apoB/apoE particle uptake and degradation.'
