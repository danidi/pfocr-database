caption: Biosynthetic pathway of PNP to the coenzyme PLP and the salvage pathway of
  PLP in E. coli. PNP is synthesized by the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)-dependent
  pathway. It is subsequently oxidized by PNP/PMP oxidase (PdxH) to produce PLP. PLP
  is recycled through a salvage pathway involving pyridoxal kinase (PdxK and PdxY),
  pyridoxal phosphatase (YbhA), and PdxH. The putative reactions in this pathway are
  represented by broken arrows.
