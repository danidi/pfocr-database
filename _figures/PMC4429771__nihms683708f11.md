caption: In an environment with abundant glucose the sugar will be taken up by the
  glucose-specific PTS and enter the glycolytic pathway yielding lactate, which is
  excreted. The abundance of glucose also results in inhibition of GlpK by phosphorylated
  EIIAGlc (crr). In a glucose-limiting state (e.g. fed larvae or nymphs), the spirochete
  will utilize alternative energy sources. B. burgdorferi encodes a lactate permease
  (LctP, BB0604) whose expression is significantly induced in both feeding larvae
  and nymphs. This will promote lactate uptake resulting in conversion of lactate
  to pyruvate and production of NADH. The elevated pyruvate level alters the PEP/pyruvate
  ratio resulting in lower levels of phosphorylated EIIAGlc (crr), thus decreasing
  the import of glucose. In addition, inhibition of GlpK will be relieved, allowing
  uptake and utilization of glycerol. Cellular levels of NAD+, required for continued
  glycolysis, would be replenished by CoADR.
