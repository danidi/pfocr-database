caption: 'Fourteen of 16 differentially expressed genes are down-regulated. One gene
  ‘mDia’ has one family member up-regulated (DIAPH1) and one family member up-regulated
  (DIAPH2). Homo sapiens specific genes in the pathway are indicated by black font
  in green boxes. Genes that showed expression on the array are indicated by black
  font in blue boxes. Differentially expressed genes are indicated by red font in
  a green box. The fold change in expression is indicated numerically with the direction
  of change indicated by ‘D’ for down-regulated genes, ‘U’ for up-regulated genes,
  and ‘ND’ for genes where no signal was detected. Gene names, gene identifications
  in parentheses, and KEGG gene abbreviations for differentially expressed genes in
  this pathway are: actinin, α1 (ACTN1), ACTN; cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), CDC42;
