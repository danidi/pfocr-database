caption: 'Multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms coexist in tumor microenvironment.
  A: PD-1regulates T-cell activation through binding to its ligand PD-L1. CTLA-4 can
  stop potentially autoreactive T cells at the initial stage of naive T-cell activation.
  B: Overexpression of DCs and TAMs or IDO and tryptophan 2,3‑dioxygenase (TDO2) in
  tumor leads to extracellular tryptophan depletion and tryptophan production, subsequently
  causing defective antigen presentation of DCs and Tregs activations and effector
  T cell function suppression. C: Upregulation of arginase 1 (ARG1) in tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) results in arginine
  the depletion, leading to MDSC-mediated immune suppression and impaired CD4+ T cell
  function. D: Chemokines CXCL1, CXCL12, CCL2, and CCL5 are secreted by the tumor
  then spread to the vasculature leading to the recruit and activity of immunosuppressive
  MDSCs, TAMs and Tregs through interacting with their receptors: CXCR1, CXCR4, CCR2
  and CCR5. E: ATP is dephosphorylated to adenosine by CD39 and CD73. Extracellular
  adenosine interacts with their receptors A2AR and A2BR overexpressed on Tregs, DCs,
  and T cells to regulate immunosuppressive functions through boosting upregulation
  of CTLA-4, PD-1 and B7 proteins. F: COX2 is overexpressed on tumor cells TAMs and
  MDSCs to stimulate PGE2 production and then enhance the tumor proliferation and
  immunosuppressive function of TAMs and MDSCs. In addition, enhancing TGF-β production
  by MDSCs can inhibit the function of NKs. G: Secretion of the high-mobility-group
  box 1 (HMGB1) protein by dying tumor cells can stimulate the expression of CD80
  and CD86 on DCs by binding to TLR4 overexpressed by DCs, which contributes to the
  differentiation if naïve and/or activated T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper
  2 (Th2). H: Activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is able to boost expression of immunosuppressive
  cytokines, chemokines, and checkpoint ligands and recruit regulatory immune cell
  subsets such as MDSCs and Tregs into tumor. RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway plays a critical
  role in CD8 T cell activation, proliferation, and survival by regulating the production
  of IL-2. The activation of VEGF-A/VEGFR axis enhances PD-1 expression on CD8+ T
  cells leading to the exhaustion of anti-tumor immune cells. In addition, VEGF-A/VEGFR
  could enhance the pathway of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2.'
