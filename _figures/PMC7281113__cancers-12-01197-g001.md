caption: 'Schematic representation of HOTAIR role in breast cancer (BC) drug resistance
  mechanisms with details of the main molecular pathways involved. In anti-HER2 treatment-resistant
  BC cells, the overexpression of HOTAIR leads to: (i) deregulation of HER2-related
  genes by upregulating the signal transduction pathway PI3K-Akt and downregulating
  the tumor suppressor gene PTEN with the consequent increase in proliferation, cell
  growth, and survival; (ii) inhibition of apoptosis by the downregulation of cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor p27; (iii) induction of EMT by TGF-β, Snail and Vimentin upregulation,
  and decrease in E-cadherin expression. In endocrine therapy resistant BC cells,
  the overexpression of HOTAIR leads to the repression of ER and the activation of
  ER-responsive genes, such as GREB1, TFF1, and c-MYC, promoting cell proliferation.
  In BC radio-resistant cells, the overexpression of HOTAIR leads to: (i) promotion
  of cell growth and proliferation by upregulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway; (ii) blockage
  of apoptosis by downregulating the pro-apoptosis gene BAD and miR-218, normally
  involved in the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage; (iii) induction of metastatic
  spread by silencing of HOXD10, a metastasis suppressor gene. In chemo-resistant
  BC cells, the overexpression of HOTAIR leads to: (i) promotion of cell growth, differentiation,
  and proliferation by upregulating Cyclin D1, the PI3K-Akt pathway, and the wnt/β-catenin
  pathway; (ii) inhibition of apoptosis by downregulating cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitors p21 and p27, miR-34a and miR-216, both involved in promoting programmed
  cell death. The red arrows indicate the upregulated genes, the blue arrows the downregulated
  genes. HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinases,
  Akt: protein kinase B, PTEN: Phosphatase and tensin homolog, TGF-beta: Transforming
  growth factor beta 1, EMT: epithelial–mesenchymal transition, ER: Estrogen Receptor,
  GREB1: Growth Regulating Estrogen Receptor Binding 1, TFF1: Transcription Termination
  Factor 1, c-MYC: myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog, BAD: BCL2 antagonist of
  cell death, HOXD10: Homeobox D10.'
