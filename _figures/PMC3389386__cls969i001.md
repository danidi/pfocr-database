caption: After entering the cell via a glucose transporter and being converted into
  glucose 6-phosphate (glucose-6P) by a hexokinase and into fructose 6-phosphate (fructose-6P),
  glucose can either be used in the glycolytic pathway or the HBP. The HBP uses fructose
  6-phosphate to form glucosamine 6-phosphate (glucosamine-6P), with glutamine serving
  as the donor of the amino group. The reaction is catalysed by the rate-limiting
  enzyme GFAT. Glucosamine 6-phosphate is rapidly acetylated through the action of
  acetyl-CoA:D-glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GAT) and isomerized to
  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) and activated, via the action of UDP-GlcNAc
  pyrophosphorylase (AGX), to UDP-GlcNAc that serves as the donor of O-GlcNAc for
  OGT activity. Glucosamine can also enter the cell through the glucose transporter
  and is rapidly phosphorylated by hexokinase yielding glucosamine 6-phosphate, thereby
  bypassing the rate-limiting first step of the HBP. S, serine; T, threonine;
