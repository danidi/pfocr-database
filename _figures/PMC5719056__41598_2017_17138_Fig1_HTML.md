caption: The mevalonate pathway leads to cholesterol synthesis. Acetoacetyl CoA and
  acetyl CoA are converted to squalene, which is subsequently converted to cholesterol.
  Important enzymes in the pathway include 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A
  reductase (HMGCR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FDPS), and farnesyl diphosphate
  farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1, also commonly called squalene synthase). Each of these
  enzymes can be inhibited by statins, bisphosphonates, and zaragozic acid, respectively;
  cholesterol can be depleted using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD).
