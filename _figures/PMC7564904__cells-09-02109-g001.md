caption: Mechanisms of in vitro Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) training. Naive monocytes
  are stimulated with BCG, then rested for several days. Phagosomal digestion of BCG
  causes the release of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), as well as a metabolic shift towards
  glycolysis through the Protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway. MDP binds nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein
  2 (NOD2) to induce epigenetic histone alterations, which are interconnected with
  the metabolic changes. Epigenetic modifications result in increased access to the
  promoter regions of genes related to inflammatory pathways, such as cytokine and
  pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Trained monocytes express higher levels of
  PRRs and produce increased levels of cytokines following stimulation with heterologous
  pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).
