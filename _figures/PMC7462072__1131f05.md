caption: 'Summary of the lignin biosynthetic pathway in higher plants. Enzymes are
  abbreviated as follows: (PAL) phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; (C4H) cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  (4CL) 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; (C3H) p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; (C3′H) p-coumarate
  shikimate 3-hydroxylase; (HCT) shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; (CCR)
  cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; (CAD) cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; (CSE) caffeoyl shikimate
  esterase; (COMT) caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; (CCoAOMT) caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  (F5H) ferulate 5-hydroxylase. Enzymes in red were found to be directly connected
  to MYB125 in the gene expression network and to be differentially expressed when
  MYB125 is overexpressed in poplar transgenic roots. The enzyme in green was not
  directly connected to MYB125 in the gene expression network, but single regression
  analysis showed significant association with the local-regulatory SNPs of MYB125.
  The box includes the most recent step discovered in the lignin biosynthesis pathway
  in plants.'
