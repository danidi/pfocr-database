caption: (A) Anaerobic microbial metabolism of trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Hyp) is
  catalyzed by Hyp dehydratase (HypD), a glycyl radical enzyme (GRE). The product
  of this transformation, (S)-Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), is an intermediate
  in many primary metabolic pathways. Hyp can be used to generate ATP for energy metabolism,
  converted to other amino acids for protein synthesis, and catabolized to form sources
  of carbon and nitrogen. (B) General mechanism proposed for GREs. A [4Fe-4S]-cluster
  dependent radical S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) activating enzyme (AE) generates
  a radical species on a conserved glycine residue in the GRE, using S-adenosylmethionine
  and an electron, and forming 5'-deoxyadenosine (5'dA) and methionine. The glycyl
  radical generates a thiyl radical species on a conserved Cys, and this thiyl radical
  initiates catalysis by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate (S). Upon
  product (P) formation, the thiyl radical is regenerated to complete the catalytic
  cycle.
