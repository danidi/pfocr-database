  description: Interplay between virus-induced cellular aggregates and inclusions.
    The replication of viruses triggers ER stress. This causes the release of BiP/GRP79
    into the cytoplasm and the subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response
    (UPR). This could ultimately lead to the clearance of toxic proteins by autophagy.
    Alternatively, virus infection directly activates innate immune responses capable
    of causing translational shutdown and stress granules (SGs) formation. Cellular
    and or viral proteins could appear as misfolded or toxic proteins and are recruited
    to the chaperon pathway for productive refolding and/or to the proteasomal pathway.
    However, when these pathways are blocked, the misfolded proteins are sequestrated
    in the aggresomes and are cleared by autophagy–aggrephagy. BiP/GRP78, binding
    immunoglobulin protein/glucose-regulated protein 78, ATF4, activating transcription
    factor 4, eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha, ATG, autophagy-related
