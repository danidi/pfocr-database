caption: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) signal through Srchomology-2 domains to Src.
  It in turn activates the pathway to KRAS, RAF, to ultimately activate the mitogen-activated
  kinase, MAPK, pathway via MEK to ERK. An activating mutation in KRAS (shown in red),
  such as the codon 12 and 13 mutations described in low grade serous ovarian cancer,
  can drive downstream activation of the MAPK pathway without upstream the otherwise
  needed upstream stimulation by RTK. Similarly, an activating mutation in BRAF (shown
  in green), such as V600E
