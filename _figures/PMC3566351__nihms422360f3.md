caption: Cartoon showing the molecular components involved in modulating Ca2+si gnal
  for regulating gonadal sheath cell contraction. Oocytes secrete EGF ligand (LIN-3),
  which binds with EGF receptor (LET-23). Sperm secrete MSP which bind with VAB-1/Epherin
  receptor. Extracellular Matrix components surrounding sheath cell bind with integrin
  (PAT-3). Ligands-recptors interactions trigger signal transduction pathway that
  likely activates PLC-γ that results in the generation of Inositol triphosphate (IP3).
  LFE-2 phosphorylates IP3 to form IP4. IPP-5 dephosphorylates IP3 to form IP2. IP3
  binds with IP3 receptor (ITR-1) found on the endoplasmic reticulum to mobilize Ca2+
  from ER. Depletion of Ca2+ from ER is sensed by ER Ca2+ sensor, STIM-1, which then
  activates Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel (CRAC), ORAI-1 present on the plasma
  membrane to replenish the internal Ca2+ store.
