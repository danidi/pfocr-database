caption: A model of the purinergic pathway in vascular cells. ATP is converted to
  pyrophosphate and AMP by ENPP1. CD73 converts AMP to inorganic phosphate and adenosine,
  which binds to plasma membrane receptors that induce intracellular signaling. This
  lowers tissue neutral alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), an extracellular, membrane-bound
  protein. In the absence of TNAP, extracellular pyrophosphate levels increase, inhibiting
  mineralization.
