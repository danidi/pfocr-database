caption: Depiction of how D1 and c-Myc proteins regulate CDDP-induced cell death,
  with arrow indicating induction and hyphen (-|) indicating inhibition. CDDP causes
  an increase in the c-Myc level but a slightly latent decrease in the D1 level. D1
  induces but c-Myc inhibits RelA, RelB, Nfκb1 and Nfκb2 expression, resulting in
  an increased or decreased NF-κB activity, respectively. The expression of Bcl-2
  and Mcl-1 as critical NF-κB targets is changed accordingly. D1 also induces BIRC5
  but inhibits Noxa while c-Myc induces Noxa without affecting BIRC5 expression. c-Myc
  is known to have other molecular pathways to cause cell death but whether D1 also
  has other pathways is currently unclear. Moreover, D1 and c-Myc may repress each
  other, thus affecting the other's apoptotic pathway as a secondary (i.e. indirect)
  mechanism to elicit its effects on cell death
