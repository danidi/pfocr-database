caption: Control and distribution of ATP and reducing equivalents derived from glycolysis
  and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Under normal aerobic conditions, most glycolysis-derived
  pyruvate produced by quiescent or slowly growing cells is converted to acetyl-CoA
  (AcCoA) in the mitochondria, with little being converted into lactate. This provides
  the mitochondrial reducing equivalents, in the form of NADH and FADH2, to power
  the electron transport chain (ETC), to generate a proton gradient (ΔΨM) and to establish
  the protomotive force necessary to drive ATP generation via Complex V. Excess cytoplasmic
  reducing equivalents in the form of NADH may be transferred to the mitochondria
  via the glycerol-3-phosphate and malate–aspartate shuttles and can potentially support
  OXPHOS when AcCoA levels are low. During hypoxia, glucose uptake, glycolytically
  derived ATP synthesis, and the “A” isoform of LDH (LDH-A)-catalyzed conversion of
  pyruvate to lactate are accelerated due to an inability of the ETC to reduce molecular
  oxygen to water and generate TCA cycle-derived ATP. Most pyruvate will be converted
  to lactate, thereby generating more NAD+ and sustaining anaerobic glycolysis. This
  positive feedback loop ensures a constant and balanced source of ATP as an energy
  source and the regeneration of NAD+ to serve as an electron acceptor for continued
  glycolysis. By contrast, dividing cells have “divided loyalties” with regard to
  the disposition of glycolytic intermediates, with some being used to generate pyruvate
  and others being used as anabolic building blocks. Just as glycolysis and lactate
  production engage in a positive feedback loop to provide a balanced amount of NAD+
  and NADH in support of one another’s activity, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  and the biosynthesis of fatty acids and sterols, generate NADPH and NADP+, respectively,
  to support each others’ pathways. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which
  includes pyruvate dehydrogenase, is the key enzymatic complex that connects glycolysis
  to the TCA cycle. It catalyzes the conversion of the last product of glycolysis,
  pyruvate, to the entry-level substrate for the TCA cycle, AcCoA. In doing so, it
  contributes one-fourth of the NADH that is produced by a single round of the TCA
  cycle.
