caption: Illustration of p53 TIAs in lymphocytes. TIAs of p53, via protein-protein
  interactions with Bcl-2 family members and the mTOR pathway, induce mitochondria-mediated
  apoptosis and inhibit autophagy. The mechanism for p53-mediated apoptosis is clear,
  whereas the autophagic role of p53 is not well elucidated. Under stress, PUMA sequestrates
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), which associate with cytoplasmic p53. Within 30 minutes, cytoplasmic
  p53 and proapoptotic proteins translocate to mitochondria. In mitochondria, p53
  releases BAX, BAK, BIM, and BID from Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), BCL2A1, and Mcl-1; BIK, BAD,
  and Noxa act in similar ways as p53. Their interactions with antiapoptotic Bcl-2,
  Bcl-X(L) BCL2A1, and Mcl-1 in the cytoplasm are also shown. In addition, transient
  association of p53 with tBid (BID cleaved by caspase-8 as a result of death-inducing
  signaling complex activation in extrinsic apoptosis pathway; not shown) or with
  BAX, BAK, BID, and BAD activates these proapoptotic proteins through structural
  changes. BAX, BAK, and BID form homo- or hetero-oligomers and trigger mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and consequently cytochrome c (cyt c) release.
  Cyt c then associates with APAF-1, together activating the downstream caspase cascade
  leading to apoptosis, preceding a second wave of apoptosis triggered by p53 transcription-dependent
  activities. The effectors in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis might vary in
  different cells by different stimuli. Green arrows indicate positive protein-protein
  interactions, and red lines, negative protein-protein interactions. Ub indicates
  ubiquitination; and VDAC1, voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1.
