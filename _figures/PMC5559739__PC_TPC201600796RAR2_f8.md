caption: 'A Model for Polyisoprenoid Biosynthesis in the Context of Leaf Isoprenoid
  Metabolism. and  are synthesized by both the cytosolic  and plastidial  pathways.
  The formation of trans-prenyl diphosphates from  and  in these respective cellular
  compartments results in a spatially distinct pool of plant polyisoprenoids: Cytosolic  is
  utilized for dolichol biosynthesis and the plastidial pool of  is the precursor
  for polyprenol biosynthesis. Polyprenols, as well as other -derived isoprenoids,
  are incorporated into the thylakoid membranes and also into the envelope membranes
  of plastids. Intermediates: farnesyl diphosphate, ; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,
  G3P; geranyl diphosphate, ; geranylgeranyl diphosphate, . Dotted lines indicate
  multiple steps in the biosynthetic pathway. ω and α represent the terminal isoprene
  units in dolichols and polyprenols.'
