caption: Overview of TNFR1 activation pathway. Flow diagram for TNFR1 activation contrasting
  the outcomes of inflammatory cytokine production versus cell death. The top panels
  depict formation of the core signaling complex with recruitment and assembly of
  TRAF2/5, cIAP 1/2 and RIPK1 at the death domain of TNFR1, and subsequent recruitment
  of LUBAC. The middle and lower panels show the divergence of potential pathways
  from formation of the core complex. On the left, complete ubiquitination of RIPK1
  results in formation of Complex I, which leads to recruitment of NEMO and TAK1 that
  activate NFκB and JNK, respectively. On the right, incomplete ubiquitination of
  RIPK1 leads to formation of complex IIa or IIb, with assembly of FLIPL, FADD and
  pro-caspase 8 or 10, leading apoptosis via activation of the latter. Below this,
  the formation of Complex IIc in the absence of sufficient caspases leads to necroptosis
  via activation of MLKL via the necrosome formed by assembly of RIPK1 and RIPK3.
  Stars indicate phosphorylation, blue bursts represent ubiquitination, purple bursts
  represent M1 ubiquitination.
