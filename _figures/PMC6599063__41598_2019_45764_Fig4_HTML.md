caption: Simplified schematic representation of the affected pathways in an emerging
  honeybee worker that impact Varroa and DWV symptoms via their interactions. Multiple
  markers indicated that Varroa mite salivary compounds promote TGF-β signaling, which
  strengthens Smad2/3 pathway signaling, but alternative signaling pathways are propagated.
  Connection of the activated Wnt and Hippo pathways, which undergo crosstalk disruption,
  leads to aberrant tissue growth, which is the likely cause of the increased probability
  of wing deformity. Considering that Varroa overrides DWV-induced proteome changes,
  as shown in Fig. , this suggests that the mite suppresses mechanisms that normally
  facilitate DWV infection. Thus, there are conflicts in JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling.
  We indicate the collective effect of Varroa and DWV on JNK, the domination of p53-induced
  apoptosis and that JAK/STAT is hyperactivated and the p53-BCL-6 feedback loop is
  disrupted. The cooperating effect is the facilitation of viral endocytosis by the
  mite. The activated Akt/mTOR (through upregulated p18/Lamtor1) pathway inhibits
  autophagy and recycling of cells damaged by ROS, which are activated by p53. The
  high number of damaged cells decreases the efficacy of ATP acquisition, resulting
  in loser cell status.
