caption: Schematic representation of how CRLF1 promotes HLF formation. TGF-β1 can
  promote the transcription of pro-fibrotic mRNA. CRLF1 signaling is required to regulate
  the translation of pro-fibrotic factors by activating the ERK pathway. Inhibition
  of CRLF1 can reduce fibrosis caused by multiple upstream stimuli.
