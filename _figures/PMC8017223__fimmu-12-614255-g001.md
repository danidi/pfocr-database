caption: IL-23 receptor polymorphism associated disorders. The IL-23 cytokine pathway
  has been firmly linked to ocular, cutaneous, intestinal disease and arthropathy
  at the genetic and cellular immunology level. There is considerable immunological
  heterogeneity in different organ responses. For example, the TNF-Fc fusion protein,
  etanercept does not work for IBD and is generally not effective for anterior uveitis.
  The role of IL-23 blockers for anterior uveitis awaits further definition but it
  is generally considered that anti-IL-17A blockers are not effective in this SpA
  domain All the agents of that antagonise the IL-23/17 axis show remarkable efficacy
  for psoriasis compared to joint disease. With respect to gut disease, the IL-17
  blockers have an important role in barrier function at this site which may explain
  exacerbations of IBD under anti-IL-17A therapy. All three cytokines including TNF,
  IL-17A and IL-23 may be equally important for peripheral arthritis in PsA and also
  for enthesitis in the peripheral skeleton because good responses are seen following
  therapeutic antagonism. The anti-p40 IL-12/23 may be less effective than the other
  three categories of drugs for Psoriatic arthritis although further studies are needed.
  Finally, only TNF and IL-17 blockers have shown efficacy in the axial skeleton where
  IL-23 blockade with either p40 or p19 blockers has not worked. The site-specific
  compartmentalisation of immunity has come into sharp focus in the past few years
  and likely reflects tissue specific factors and microbiota interactive factors shaping
  diverse immune responses.
