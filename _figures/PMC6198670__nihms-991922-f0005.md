caption: Schematic representation of ARG1-arginine-immune suppression-fatigue pathway.
  EBRT induces the increase in arginase 1 at transcriptional level (ARG1) or the increase
  in arginase accumulation; arginase 1 is the key enzyme to catalyzes arginine and
  can lead to deficiency or depletion of arginine at cellular or plasma level. The
  latter results subsequently in the suppression of T lymphocytes by down-regulation
  of the expression CD8, CCR7, CD27, CD28 and CD3, which are essential to lymphocyte
  activation, differentiation, proliferation and survival. Arginine deficiency induced
  T lymphocyte suppression plays a central role in immune response associated chronic
  fatigue syndrome. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that EBRT-related changes
  in the arginine metabolism pathway by triggering the arginase 1 activity lead to
  the subsequent reciprocal interplay of arginine deficiency and suppression of T
  cell mediated immunity response, which may play the important role in the initial
  fatigue development and intensification in these cancer patients undergoing radiation
  therapy.
