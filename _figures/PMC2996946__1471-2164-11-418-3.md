caption: Genes altered in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in starved and infected
  fish. Diagram shows key pathway of cholesterol metabolism. Enzymes circled in blue
  were found to be differentially expressed during microarray analysis. Those proteins
  boxed in red are also found altered in expression. 1Cu indicate up regulated in
  PSL relative to PFL, 2ACu indicates up regulated in AFL and PSL relative to PFL
  and, 3Bd indicates down regulated in ASL group relative to AFL. Expression levels
  are shown in supplementary Table S1.
