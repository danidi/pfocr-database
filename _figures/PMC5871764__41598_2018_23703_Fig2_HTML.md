number: Figure 2
caption: Summary of significant and nominally significant findings in Notch pathway
  mRNA expression between the bipolar disorder and the healthy control group after
  controlling for age, gender and Bmal1. Results are given as p-values, adjusted for
  multiple testing, where significant results are indicated in red/dark blue (for
  increased/decreased mRNA expression) and nominally significant results (0.001 < p < 0.05)
  are shown as pink/light blue (for increased/decreased mRNA expression). Non-significant
  results are depicted as boxes with white background. The figure is based on the
  Notch signaling pathway in the KEGG database (hsa04330, version date 5/9/17). Hey1
  is included by the authors due to its known role as a target gene for Notch signaling.
