caption: 'Hypothesized model linking functional and temporal hierarchies of molecular
  responses to fluctuating thermal cues during TSD. Temperature is initially transduced
  into a biological signal via one or more thermo-sensory mechanisms. Possible mechanisms
  include TRP channels which alter intracellular calcium levels, HSPs, CIRBP, RNA
  thermosensors, or CLK4 which phosphorylate serine arginine-rich proteins with roles
  in alternative splicing. Upstream epigenetic regulators, JARID2 and KDM6B, are proximate
  targets of this cellular thermo-sensory mechanism and their transcription and post-transcriptional
  regulation respond rapidly to thermal fluctuations as a result (1) In particular,
  transcript abundance of JARID2 and KDM6B increases in the bipotential gonad following
  exposure to transient female-promoting thermal signals. Intron–retention in JARID2
  also responds rapidly to temperature potentially leading to the generation of a
  truncated protein with altered function or sequestration of “sentinel RNAs” in the
  nucleus that are later spliced and translated. Once translated, JARID2 and KDM6B
  influence H3K27me3 marks at the promoters of genes associated with the male and
  female pathway resulting in incremental changes to the chromatin landscape (2) in
  response to temperature. Over time, the repressive H3K27me3 mark accumulates at
  the promoters of genes involved in the male-pathway via the actions of JARID2 in
  complex with PRC2, while genes involved in the female-pathway progressively lose
  H3K27me3 at their promoters via actions of KDM6B. As a result, expression of genes
  involved in the female-pathway increases gradually (3) until reaching a threshold
  (asterisks) for sexual fate commitment. ( References: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9
