caption: A model for the v-Crk-mediated signaling pathway. v-Crk binds through its
  SH2 domain to multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated target molecules such as p130Cas
  or paxillin that supposedly localize to the focal adhesion. A guanine nucleotide
  exchange protein C3G, which associates with SH3 domain of v-Crk, can presumably
  activate Ras-like small G protein and generate signal for the activation of Jun
  kinase. The well established Grb2-mediated signaling pathway from tyrosine-phosphorylated
  receptor localized in the plasma membrane through Sos to the activation of MAPK
  is also described as a comparison of different signaling pathways mediated by two
  adaptor molecules.
