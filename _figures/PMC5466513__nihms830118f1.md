caption: Autophagy is initiated upon activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. AMPK
  can be activated by p53 and Sesn2 in response to cellular stress. AMPK then activates
  TSC1/2 to inhibit mTORC1. mTORC1 is further negatively regulated by PTEN to activate
  autophagy. ULK1 is activated by inhibition of mTORC1, direct phosphorylation by
  AMPK, or p53-mediated transcriptional upregulation. ULK1 then forms a complex which
  activates Beclin1. Beclin1, which binds to Bcl-2 in normal conditions, dissociates
  from Bcl-2 and binds to UVRAG. UVRAG, a p53 target gene, promotes the formation
  of the Beclin1 complex to initiate phagophore nucleation. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation
  systems facilitate the lipidation of LC3-I to form LC3-II, and elongation of the
  burgeoning phagophore. E1-like activating enzyme Atg7 leads to the activation of
  E2-like enzyme Atg3 (System 1) or Atg10 (System 2), subsequently the activation
  of the E3-link enzyme complex Atg5-Atg12 conjugate with Atg16, and subsequently
  the generation of LC3-II. LC3-II binds to an adaptor protein or autophagy receptor,
  such as p62, which in turn binds to cargo with modifications such as polyubiquitination.
  The autophagosome encloses the cargo and subsequently fuses with a lysosome to form
  an autolysosome. Adaptor and cargo are degraded at the autolysosome and the resulting
  molecules are recycled to the cytoplasm.
