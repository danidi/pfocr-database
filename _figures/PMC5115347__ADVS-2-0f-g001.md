caption: 'Schematic representation of the degranulatory signaling cascade of RBL‐2H3
  (adapted from refs. and). Degranulation occurs when FcεRI are cross‐linked by antigen‐bound
  IgE, resulting in the recruitment of tyrosine kinases, tyrosine‐protein kinase (LYN)
  and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) to the transmembrane immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based
  activation motif (ITAMs) of the receptor. This results in the phosphorylation of
  tyrosines within the transmembrane adaptor molecule Linker for Activation of T cells
  (LAT) that coordinates the downstream signaling of multiple cytosolic adaptor molecules,
  including, GRB2‐related adaptor protein (GADS), SH2‐domain‐containing leukocyte
  protein of 76 kDa (SLP76), among others not shown for simplicity. As well, the exchange
  factor, VAV and the signaling enzyme, Phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ), which regulates
  calcium mobilization and activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC), mediate the exocytosis
  of degranulatory products, such as β‐hexosaminidase. VAV also activates the RAS‐MAPK
  (ERK) pathway, which stimulates the production of transcription factors that generate
  cytokines and contributes to degranulation. Two experiments were designed to test
  the effects of NP exposures on various components of the degranulatory pathway.
  Experiment 1 was designed to test the effects of NP‐exposed RBL‐2H3 cells degranulation
  by measuring: 1. IgE binding FcεRI (Figure a,c,e), 2. MAPK ERK phosphorylation (Figure
  a,c,e), and 3. Exocytosis of degranulatory products (i.e., β‐hexosaminidase) (Figure
  a,c,e). Experiment 2 tested the effects of NP‐exposed IgE antibodies on identical
  endpoints of the degranulatory pathway as were measured in Experiment 1 (i.e., Figures
  , , b,d,f).'
