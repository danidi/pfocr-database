caption: JNK signaling in normal stem cells. (A) In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the
  JNK pathway inhibits definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation and maintains the
  undifferentiated status. C-JUN activated by JNK1 binds transcriptional enhancers
  of ESC genes with OCT4, NANOG, and SMAD2/3 and maintains chromatin accessibility
  at the ESC stage. During the ESC-DE transition, SMAD2/3 becomes free due to decreased
  activity of JNK–C-JUN signaling and co-occupies DE enhancers with other DE transcriptional
  factors. (B) The evidence for the role of JNK signaling in iPSCs is minimal. A few
  conflicting reports suggest that JNK signaling is either suppressed or promoted
  during the reprogramming of terminally differentiated cells (e.g., fibroblasts)
  to iPSCs. (C) Most hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) stay quiescent in the absence
  of stress, and the JNK–C-FOS/C-JUN pathway negatively controls cell cycle progression
  to maintain a dormant status. (D) In ISCs, the JNK signaling pathway modulates WNT
  signaling strength to regulate intestinal homeostasis. JNK1–C-JUN/AP-1 signaling
  upregulates WNT target genes, including Lgr5, Ccdn1, and Axin2, to promote proliferation
  and differentiation of ISCs. (E) WNT3A activates the JNK-ATF2 signaling pathway
  during neuronal differentiation, and ATF2 promotes neuronal gene expression.
