number: Fig. 4
caption: 'Diagram of glycolysis is shown, including enzymes whose transcripts were
  more highly expressed in GRMD (red) or wild type dogs (green). Metabolic transporters
  are also shown. The information was compiled using various public databases, and
  the figure was produced using Protein Lounge pathway builder software (ePath3D).
  The hemoglobin molecule was obtained from the Protein Databank (www.rcsb.org). The
  embedded dog illustration showing dystrophic musculature (top left) is an original
  work of art produced by Dave Carlson (Carlson-Art.com). Note: Common protein symbols
  are shown, some of which are represented by several different synonyms or have different
  names for their respective transcripts. For instance, MCP1 and 2 are also called
  BP44 and BP44L. PFK2 is encoded by PFKFB3'
