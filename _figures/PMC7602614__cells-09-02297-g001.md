caption: The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  signaling pathway. Membrane cytokine receptors have cytoplasmic tails in which inactive
  JAKs associate constitutively. The interaction of cytokines or growth factors with
  their receptors (type I and II) induces dimerization/oligomerization of these receptors.
  It should be mentioned that some cytokine receptors, such as GHR and EpoR, show
  pre-formed dimers. In both cases, the interaction between the cytokine and its receptor
  induces a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain. This interaction results
  in the juxtaposition of JAKs, leading to their autophosphorylation or transphosphorylation
  by other JAKs or other families of tyrosine kinases. The activated JAKs then phosphorylate
  the receptor’s cytoplasmic tails on tyrosine residues, creating sites that allow
  the binding of other signaling molecules that contain an SH2 domain (such as STAT
  proteins). Cytoplasmic STATs then bind to phosphorylated receptors, becoming substrates
  for JAKs, which phosphorylate STATs on highly conserved tyrosine residues. After
  their phosphorylation, STATs form homodimers or heterodimers that are capable of
  translocating to the nucleus and activating gene transcription. The JAK/STAT pathway
  is negatively regulated by the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), as well
  as by the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) and protein tyrosine phosphatases
  (PTPs).
