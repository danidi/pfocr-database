caption: Ecc15 Virulence Antagonizes L. plantarum-Mediated Enhancement of Host Protein
  Digestion Capacities Impeding Drosophila Juvenile Growth PromotionUpon undernutrition,
  the Drosophila’s mutualist L. plantarum promotes host proteases expression in enterocytes
  partly through the PGRP-LE/Imd/Relish signaling cascade. The resulting enhanced
  protease activity in the midgut increases the digestion and uptake of dietary proteins
  into dipeptides and AAs. AAs accumulation is sensed in endocrine tissues by the
  TOR kinase pathway and promotes increases production of dILPs and Ecdysone, which
  together drive systemic growth. Upon infection by the foodborne pathogen Ecc15,
  L. plantarum-mediated systemic growth promotion is attenuated. Ecc15 virulence causes
  a transcriptional switch whereby immune genes expression is promoted in enterocytes
  while intestinal proteases expression is silenced.
