caption: Mechanisms of leptin action in granulosa cells. The cartoon shows the signaling
  pathways that mediate the leptin effects on granulosa cells. Sam68 contains a domain
  for the RNA binding activity and it may interact with both RNA targets, as well
  as other proteins containing Src homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domains through proline-rich
  sequences and tyrosine-phosphorylated residues, respectively. Sam68 is a scaffold
  protein recruited in various signal transduction pathways linking signaling pathways
  (PI3K and MAPK pathway) and RNA metabolism regulation. Sam68 functions are mainly
  regulated by phosphorylation. This tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68 has been implicated
  in cell proliferation, growth as well as in differentiation processes through different
  mechanisms. Finally, Sam68 has been related to leptin-dependent PI3K and MAPK pathways
  activation, where it has been shown to be associated to Grb2, GAP and PI3K regulatory
  subunit in a different cellular system.
