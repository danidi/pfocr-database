caption: The methionine cycle and alternative homocysteine degradation regulate DNMT
  and HMT activity. HMT and DMMT catalyze histone and DNA methylation, respectively.
  The donor of the methyl group is the metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which
  is then converted into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is regenerated into SAM
  during the methionine cycle (red lines) where the loss of adenosine induces its
  transformation into homocysteine. The methyl group of 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MethylTHF)
  from the folate cycle (orange lines) is then transferred to homocysteine to form
  methionine. Depending of the metabolic needs, homocysteine can be catabolized into
  sulfate, taurine or cysteine. This alternative pathway is represented by dotted
  lines. The regeneration of SAH into SAM is then compromised and negatively impacts
  HMT and DNMT activity. Created with BioRender.com.
