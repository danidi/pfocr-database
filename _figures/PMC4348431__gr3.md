caption: Calcium signaling and canonical pathways were constructed using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analyses System. Protein–protein interaction pathways showing a well-coordinated
  network of interactions between proteins that were dysregulated post-HIV-infection
  (RYRs) or expressed exclusively in HIV-infected cells. All 12 proteins identified
  to be expressed or overexpressed in HIV-infected cell were found within the calcium
  signaling protein–protein interaction networks. All proteins are highlighted in
  different colors and the symbols represent the different families described in the
  following diagram. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
