caption: Association of chemokines and NASH. In adipose tissue of the obese, bone-marrow-derived
  monocytes are recruited from the bloodstream, predominantly via MCP-1-CCR2 signaling.
  The RANTES-CCR5 pathway also plays an important role in monocyte recruitment in
  adipose tissue. Infiltrated macrophages in obese adipose tissue undergo a phenotypic
  switch from alternative M2 macrophages to classical M1 macrophages. The latter secrete
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, which result in insulin resistance, adipokine dysfunction,
  and excess lipid accumulation in the liver. In the fatty liver, the recruitment
  and activation of immune cells, including Kupffer cells, contribute to hepatic inflammation,
  which is involved in hepatic stellate cell activation.
