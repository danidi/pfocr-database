caption: Schematic diagram of the nitric oxide signaling pathway in the penis for
  mediating the erection response. The diagram shows the molecular basis for erection
  physiology that may transition between flaccidity (erectile tissue contraction)
  and erection (erectile tissue relaxation) depending upon the extent of sexual stimulation.
  Nitric oxide is generated constitutively from L-arginine by catalysis of neuronal
  nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and endothelial NOS localized to neurons and endothelial
  cells, respectively. After its release from generator cells in the penis, nitric
  oxide diffuses locally to corporal smooth muscle cells whereby it activates guanylate
  cyclase to convert 5′-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3′, 5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate
  (cGMP). This cyclic nucleotide then exerts downstream effects resulting in penile
  erection. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) degrades cGMP to its inactive form, 5′-GMP,
  which is subsequently reformed into GTP. A PDE5 inhibitor blocks PDE5 activity,
  thereby potentiating effector actions of cGMP.
