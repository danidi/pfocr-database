caption: Schematic of the mechanism by which involvement of cav-1 and caveolae in
  CM-induced beta cell apoptosis in pancreatic beta-cells. Cytokine mixture treatment
  into beta cells inhibited insulin secretion and induced apoptosis. Cytokine mixture
  treatment increased caveolae structure as well as cav-1 expression and cytokine
  receptors (TNFR1 and IL1-R1) were recruited into caveolae. Therefore, activation
  of NF-kB signaling pathway increased the expression level of inflammatory response
  genes, which leads to beta cell apoptosis.
