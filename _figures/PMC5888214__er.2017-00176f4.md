caption: The SREBP pathway regulates cellular cholesterol metabolism. (a) In sterol-depleted
  cells, the relative absence of cholesterol and oxysterols located in the endoplasmic
  reticulum prevents feedback inhibition of the SREBP pathway by inactivating INSIG
  (retention protein) and activating SCAP (escort protein). SREBP1 and SREBP2 proteins
  are transported to the Golgi apparatus for proteolytic processing by proteases.
  The newly generated mature SREBP1 and SREBP2 are then capable of translocating into
  the nucleus and serving as transcription factors. They increase expression of genes
  encoding proteins that regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism (e.g., LDLR, NPC1,
  HMG-CoA synthase, and HMG-CoA reductase). (b) In sterol-enriched cells, the relative
  abundance of cholesterol and oxysterols located in the endoplasmic reticulum promotes
  feedback inhibition of the SREBP pathway by activating INSIG and inactivating SCAP
  to prevent transport of SREBP1 and SREBP2 to the Golgi apparatus for proteolytic
  processing. (c) In NPC1-deficient cells, cholesterol accumulates in the late endosomes/lysosomes.
  Because cholesterol is unable to gain access to the endoplasmic reticulum to activate
  INSIG and inactivate SCAP, impaired feedback inhibition of the SREBP pathway results
  in increased cholesterol synthesis and receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDLs although
  the cell has an abundance of cholesterol. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HMGCR, HMG-CoA
  reductase; LDLR, LDL receptor; LE/L, late endosome/lysosome; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating
  protein; SRE, sterol regulatory element.
