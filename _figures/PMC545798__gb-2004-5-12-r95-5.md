caption: LinearActivePaths analysis finds that virtually all genes in active metabolic
  networks confer sensitivity to arsenic when deleted. (a) Serine, threonine, glutamate
  amino-acid synthetic pathways; (b) the shikimate pathway. The paths that compose
  these networks all have individual p-values of < 0.05. The coloration for these
  figures is based on red for any gene ranked in the top 50 significant genes, yellow
  for 51-100, and green for >101.
