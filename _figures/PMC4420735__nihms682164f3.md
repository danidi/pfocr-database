caption: A model of telomerase RNP biogenesis. Active telomerase localizes to the
  telomere through a complex pathway. TERT protein expression follows the canonical
  eukaryotic transcription, RNA maturation, and nuclear export to the cytoplasm (pale-red)
  for translation. The TERT protein (grey) is then imported back into the nucleus
  and localizes to the nucleolus (pale-violet) prior to assembly with the TR (black).
  The TR precursor, synthesized by RNA polymerase II and TMG capped, is bound by two
  copies of the protein complex formed by dyskerin (red), NOP10 (violet), NHP2 (green),
  and GAR1 (yellow) for 3′ end processing and internal modifications. The RHAU RNA
  helicase (light-blue) resolves the G-quadruplex at the 5′ end. TCAB1 (dark-blue)
  binds to the CAB box for localization of the mature TR to Cajal bodies (pale-blue).
  TERT localizes to Cajal bodies for assembly with the TR, aided by the chaperone
  proteins hsp90 (orange) and p23 (cyan). The now fully assembled active telomerase
  complex localizes to the telomere (blue) for telomeric DNA synthesis.
