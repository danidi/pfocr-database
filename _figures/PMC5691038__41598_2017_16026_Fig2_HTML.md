caption: 'Comparison of Gibbs free energy changes of reactions under anaerobic condition
  in PKP and EMP pathway. The transformed Gibbs free energy changes of reactions (highlighted
  in red color) in the pathways were calculated using eQuilibrator, for pH 7.2, ionic
  strength (0.1 M) and intracellular metabolite concentrations (1μM-10mM). For expanded
  names of all metabolites (black) and reactions (blue) (except, PFK: phosphofructokinase
  and FBA: Fructose bisphosphate aldolase, which are absent in L. mesenteroides),
  see Supplemental data .'
