caption: 'Proposed mechanism of Hb (and its oxidized species)-induced toxicity: Hb
  undergoes oxidation to higher oxidation states, such as HbFe3+ and HbFe4+. These
  products activate the NF-κB pathway, leading to release of chemokines. The oxidized
  species lose heme-iron easily, leading to increased HO-1 and ferritin synthesis.
  HO-1 translocates into the mitochondria, leading to possible dysfunction. Free heme
  and CO generated by HO-1 can also inhibit mitochondrial respiratory chain function
  (electron transport chain [ETC]/mitochondrial transmembrane potential [ΔΨm]). Hp
  attenuates the Hb-induced effects, possibly by diffusing Hb radicals. Caveoli and
  some unknown pathways may also be involved in endocytosis of Hb. BV, biliverdin;
  HBOC, Hb-based oxygen carrier; Hpx, hemopexin; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4.'
