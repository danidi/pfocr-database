caption: The compound collection was screened for inhibitors of MDP-induced IL-8 secretion
  in 293/hNOD2 stable cells. Active inhibitors were then tested for selectivity against
  IL-8 induced by alternative pathways including NOD1, TNFR1 and TLR2 as well as for
  direct inhibitors of RIP2 kinase. The activity of selective NOD2 inhibitors was
  then confirmed in cells expressing NOD2 endogenously and against agonist-independent
  NOD2 signaling.
