caption: NF-κB signaling pathway and its regulation by ORFV-encoded proteins ORFV024,
  ORFV121, and ORFV002. ORFV024 inhibits the phosphorylation of IκB kinases IKKα and
  IKKβ by targeting steps upstream of the IKK complex. ORFV121 binds to and inhibits
  the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB-p65. ORFV002 binds to and
  inhibits the p300-mediated acetylation of NF-κB-p65, likely by disrupting the association
  of p300 and NF-κB-p65.
