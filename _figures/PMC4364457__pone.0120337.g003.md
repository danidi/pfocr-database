caption: 'There was no difference in the networks identified using pairwise proteomics
  data based on single time points from 3 or 12h after EGF treatment. Anti-apoptotic
  genes coloured in pink, pro-apoptotic genes coloured in light blue, genes with no
  reported involvement in apoptosis coloured in yellow. Octagonal shape indicates
  up-regulated genes. Squares for down-regulated genes. MicroRNAs negatively correlated
  with respect to target have red edges while MicroRNAs positively correlated with
  respect to target have blue edges. Diamonds indicate targets with isoforms that
  are both up and down regulated. Represented protein classes include: chaperone (TCP1
  and CCT6A), cytoskeletal protein (EZR, DSTN, CAP1, TUBA1B and ACTB), isomerase (PPIA)
  and nucleic acid binding (XRCC6).'
