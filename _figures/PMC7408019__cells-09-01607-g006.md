caption: KLF4 acts as a negative regulator of wt-CFTR but has its function disrupted
  in the F508del–CFTR cells. Our data suggest that the AKT pathway is a positive regulator
  of wt-CFTR while being a negative regulator of F508del–CFTR in a way that is possibly
  at least partially mediated by KLF4, which in turn seems to be negatively regulated
  by AKT signaling in wt-CFTR cells. GSK3β, on the other hand, seems to be a negative
  regulator of CFTR, which is KLF4-dependent in wt-CFTR and KLF4-independent in F508del–CFTR
  expressing cells.
