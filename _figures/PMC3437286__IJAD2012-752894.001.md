caption: Intracellular vesicular trafficking pathways. Endocytosed surface proteins,
  such as APP, are delivered to the endosomal system by internalization. Internalized
  membrane proteins can be sorted into intralumenal vesicles of the MVB by sequential
  activity of ESCRTs 0, I, II, and III or delivered to the extracellular environment
  by the recycling endosome. Mature MVBs fuse with either the autophagosome of the
  autophagic pathway to form the amphisome or directly with the lysosome, which donates
  degradative hydrolases, creating the autolysosome where complete degradation of
  the sequestered material occurs. Alternatively, the multivesicular body can fuse
  with the plasma membrane, resulting in the exosomal secretion of the intralumenal
  vesicles and their internalized cargo.
