caption: 'Expression of Insulin/IGF signaling components is modulated by miRNAs. Insulin
  Receptor (INSR) and Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF) receptors are preferentially
  located into plasma membrane macrostructures (caveolae) characterized by caveolins
  proteins (e.g., Caveolin-1) and lipids, which stabilize their structures. Ligands
  binding to their specific receptors induces the activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) and of other downstream components, mediated by the recruitment
  of scaffold elements (e.g., IRS1 and IRS2 protein members). PI3Kactivation, which
  triggers phosphorylation of PIP2 into PIP3, regulates insulin metabolic effects
  by phosphorylation of AKT through several intermediate kinases (e.g., PDK1), thus
  resulting into increased glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis and decreased gluconeogenesis.
  On the other side, insulin signal transduction induces a pro-survival status through
  the direct inhibition of Bad (pro-apoptotic) and activation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (proliferation). MiRNAs negatively regulate multiple
  target genes involved in insulin/IGF signaling pathway and are indicated as dashed
  lines. MiRNAs targeting insulin signaling factors and identified as deregulated
  in insulin sensitive tissues in metabolic disease in man are depicted in red. The
  orange rounds with P in it represent phosphate groups; the grey arrows pointing
  down indicate negative regulation of those specific process and the grey arrows
  pointing up indicate positive regulation of those specific process. Factors reported
  in brown represent the main effectors of insulin signaling metabolic activations;
  factors reported in dark red represent the activated effectors acting on proliferation
  and pro-survival cues; factors reported in light blue represent phosphatases and
  kinases; factors reported in dark blue represent interactors /effectors of Akt signaling.
