caption: Genetic model depicting the role of RgdA in A. fumigatus. RgdA negatively
  regulates the cAMP-PKA signaling and SakA MAP kinase pathway. The lack of RgdA leads
  to the enhanced activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and SakA MAP kinase
  pathway, which in turn leads to increased expression of gli genes, dpr genes, and
  rod genes.
