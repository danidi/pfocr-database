caption: Phosphoproteomic analysis of SK-ChA-1 cells after ZPCL-PDT. The data (n = 4
  per group) were analyzed with the Phosphopath plugin in Cytoscape []. Increased
  and decreased phosphorylation of proteins in the PDT-treated groups versus the control
  group are indicated in red and green, respectively. Straight lines and arrows indicate
  protein interactions (derived from the Biogrid database []) and kinase-substrate
  interactions (imported from PhosphoSitePlus []), respectively. Wikipathways was
  used for pathway analysis [], where the dataset was queried against this database
  to identify pathways. For this figure, EGF, VEGF, insulin, FAK, and MAPK signaling
  pathways were selected
