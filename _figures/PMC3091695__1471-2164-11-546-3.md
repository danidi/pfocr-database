caption: 'Stress-induced pathways in the PVN of the hypothalamus of DBA/2J (A) and
  C57BL/6 (B) mice. Using a pathway building program, connections between the group
  of genes regulated at 4 h and the group of genes regulated at 8 h after stress were
  determined, as well as connections within groups. Gene names identified on the microarray
  are circled, the direction of expression change is indicated by plus or minus signs.
