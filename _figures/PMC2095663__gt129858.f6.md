caption: A hypothetical schematic representation of the effects of the combination
  of 9‐cis‐retinoic acid (RA) plus ciglitazone (cig) on growth and gene expression
  in colon cancer cells. When peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
  is activated by ligand binding, it is able to heterodimerise with retinoid X receptor
  (RXR) and activate target gene expression by binding to the peroxisome proliferator‐responsive
  element (PPRE) in various genes in normal colonic epithelial cells (A). In colon
  cancer cells, the Ras/mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway phosphorylates
  RXRα, which impairs its function as a heterodimeric partner for PPARγ (B). In the
  presence of MEK inhibitor PD98059, RXRα can escape phosphorylation by Erk (C). A
  point‐mutated RXRα T82A/S260A, which mimics the unphosphorylated form of RXRα, can
  form a heterodimer with PPARγ and thereby activate target gene expression by binding
  to the PPRE (D). Combined treatment with 9‐cisRA plus cig can activate the transcriptional
  activity of PPRE and synergistically inhibit the expression of c‐Jun, thus inhibiting
  the transcriptional activity of AP‐1 and the expression of cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 (COX‐2)
  in colon cancer cells (E). These combined effects may contribute to growth inhibition
  in colon cancer cells.
