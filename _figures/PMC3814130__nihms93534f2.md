caption: When the B-RafV600E oncogene is generated through a point mutation, activation
  of the MAP kinase pathway becomes constitutive, inducing cells to proliferate indefinitely
  and initiate tumor formation. B-RafV600E shows a dramatically increased basal kinase
  activity (increased phosphorylation, PO4−), ~480-folds higher than wild-type B-Raf
  activity. Response to B-RafV600E is independent of extra-cellular mitogens and Ras
  signaling, creating a deregulation of transcription mechanisms. The B-RafV600E-activated
  phospho-ERK1/2 pathway transforms human normal cells both in vitro and in vivo.
  In addition, B-RafV600E induces senescence in normal human foreskin fibroblasts
  by stimulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4a.
