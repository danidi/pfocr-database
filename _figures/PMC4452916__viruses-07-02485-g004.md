caption: Schematic representation of the effects of hrHPV on antigen presentation.
  The proteasome processes proteins into peptides, which are transported into the
  ER via TAP1. Aided by several chaperone proteins, MHC-I is folded and loaded with
  peptide after which it exits the ER to travel via the Golgi apparatus to the plasma
  membrane were the peptides are presented to T cells. HPV proteins (red) attenuate
  gene expression of critical components of this pathway, as well as actively retains
  MHC-I in the ER and Golgi apparatus. MHC-II forms in the ER and complexes with the
  invariant chain. The complex travels via the ER and Golgi apparatus to lysosomes
  where the invariant chain is degraded and MHC-II is loaded with processed peptides
  from endocytosed proteins. Loaded MHC-II then travels to the plasma membrane to
  present the peptides. Upon IFNγ stimulation, HPV E5 (red) blocks invariant chain
  degradation and peptide loading, as well as inhibits endosome acidification and
  maturation.
