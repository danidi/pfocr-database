caption: 'The signaling pathways in the epididymitis induced by UEPC. The signaling
  pathway mainly includes two parts: (1) UPEC could activate TLR4 and TLR5 on epithelial
  cells and macrophages and induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through
  the classical inflammatory NF-kB signaling pathway. (2) Epididymal cells can also
  limit pathogen infections by secreting defensins after infection with UPEC. UPEC,
  uropathogenic Escherichia coli; TLR4, toll like receptor 4; TLR5, toll like receptor
  5; MyD 88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; IL-1,
  interleukin-1; IL-6, interleukin-6; IL-10, interleukin-10; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.'
