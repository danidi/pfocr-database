caption: '(A) Schematic for insulin maturation pathway in pancreatic β-cell. (B) Human
  orthologs of secretory proteins are identified, insulin: proinsulin binding ratios
  are calculated and plotted on a logarithmic (base2) scale. In the inset, silver
  stain of eluate from MIN6 cells immunoprecipitated with Control IgG (lane 1) or
  Protein G beads alone (lane 2) or with antibodies to proinsulin (18D2, lane 3) or
  insulin (K36ac10, lane 4) is shown. (C) Proteins that belong to the secretory compartment
  of insulin BIN are denoted as nodes (ovals; hexagons were used for proteins previously
  identified in proteomic studies of insulin secretory granules from INS1-E cells
  (; )). Proteins are arranged according to their location in the secretory pathway.
  Color of the node represent more binding to insulin (green), proinsulin (red) or
  to both (grey) based on log2 values of insulin to proinsulin binding ratios and
  statistical confidence (proteins with p ≥ 0.5 for differential binding to insulin/proinsulin
  based on a t-test are always grey). Grey lines represent the edges in the network
  that show direct or indirect interaction with insulin identified by insulin BIN,
  black straight lines represent interactions between nodes in the interactome based
  on PINA and blue lines connect insulin to proteins that have previous described
  function in insulin folding, trafficking or secretion or an association with diabetic
  conditions. (D) Heatmap of fifty proteins with highest fractional spectral coverage
  in insulin and proinsulin immunoprecipitate is shown. See also .'
