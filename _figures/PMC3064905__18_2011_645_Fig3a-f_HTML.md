caption: 'Blueprint of amino acid biosynthesis and nutritional upgrading in the A.
  pisum/Buchnera APS symbiosis. Essential amino acids are shown in purple, while non-essential
  amino acids are in green. A. pisum enzymes are shown with red arrows, while Buchnera
  enzymes are shown with blue arrows. Green boxes around metabolites indicate a phloem
  sap source and purple boxes highlight the importance of glutamine (Gln), which is
  a dominant amino acid in hemolymph [] actively taken up by bacteriocytes and converted
  to glutamate (Glu, orange boxes). Glutamate then actively crosses the symbiosomal
  membrane [, ] where it serves as an amino donor and metabolic precursor for the
  synthesis of nonessential amino acids. a Asparagine (Asn), the dominant amino acid
  in the phloem sap diet of the pea aphid [], aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu) and
  glutamine (Gln) are the four amino acids of central importance to the aphid/Buchnera
  symbiosis; at least one of these four is required as the primary source of all protein
  amino acids for the holosymbiont []. b–d Both A. pisum and Buchnera APS retain glycolysis

  across the Buchnera APS membrane where it serves as the metabolic precursor of the
  essential amino acids isoleucine (Ile), lysine (Lys), and threonine (Thr). Synthesis
  of the branched-chain essential amino acids valine (Val), leucine (Leu), and isoleucine
  (Ile) requires within-pathway metabolic collaboration between symbiotic partners

  pathways presented were constructed using the AcypiCyc Acyrthosiphon pisum (genome
