caption: Steroidogenesis in adrenocortical cells is regulated by the binding of ACTH
  to MC2R, activating PKA pathway through the release of the catalytic subunit (C)
  by the action of cAMP in specific domains of the PKA, followed by the phosphorylation
  of transcription factors (TFs) in the nucleus that will increase the transcription
  of steroidogenic enzymes, leading to cortisol production. In addition to this classic
  signaling, PMAH cells can be abnormally regulated by aberrant receptors that mimic
  the action of ACTH when activating PKA; additionally, the activation of PKA regulates
  the production of ectopic ACTH within the hyperplastic nodules that will once again
  activate PKA independently of pituitary ACTH, allowing a certain independency to
  cell steroidogenesis. Additionally, mutations in ARMC5 are the main molecular events
  associated with PBMAH; ARMC5 decreases steroidogeneis, induces cell apoptosis and
  might also be involved in cell proliferation by mechanisms so far unknown.
