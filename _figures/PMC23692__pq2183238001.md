caption: Role of DGAT in glycerolipid metabolism. DAG used by DGAT potentially originates
  from hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid (PA), from the esterification of 2-monoacylglycerol
  (MAG), or from triacylglycerol (TAG) or phospholipid (PL) hydrolysis. The MAG pathway
  is thought to be especially important in enterocytes of the small intestine ().
  P, phosphate; LysoPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidyl choline; PE, phosphatidyl
  ethanolamine.
