caption: Model for how IGF-1R/AKT activation affects apoptosis sensitivity in response
  to Nutlin. P53 induced by Nutlin promotes AKT activation dependent on IGF-1R. IGF-1R/AKT
  activation also promotes the accumulation of p53. Activated AKT can reduce apoptosis
  and promote survival by regulating the activity of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors
  that localize to the mitochondria, such as bcl-2, bax, and bim. AKT also inhibits
  autophagy, which can promote survival.
