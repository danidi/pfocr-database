caption: 'Metabolic-flux distribution at dilution rates of 0.05 h−1 (A), 0.1 h−1 (B),
  0.2 to 0.3 h−1 (C), and 0.4 h−1 (D) in glucose-limited continuous cultures. The
  exact growth rates for the top, middle, and bottom values were as follows: (A) 0.044,
  0.048, and 0.056 h−1, respectively; (B) 0.09, 0.09, and 0.11 h−1, respectively;
  (C) 0.19, 0.29, and 0.31 h−1, respectively; and (D) 0.40 (bottom) and 0.41 h−1 (top).
  Relative to the glucose uptake rate, assuming Gaussian error propagation, the confidence
  intervals were less than 40% for the TCA cycle, the glyoxylate shunt, and the lower
  part of the EMP pathway, while they were below 15% for all other fluxes. Arrowheads
  indicate the direction of a given flux. CoA, coenzyme A; DHAD, dihydroxyacetone-P;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-P.'
