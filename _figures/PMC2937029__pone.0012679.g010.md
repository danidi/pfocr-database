caption: In agreement with the results of the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation
  assays (  –), we postulate that a phosphoryl group is sequentially transferred from
  PEP to EINtr, NPr, and finally to the EIIAMan-like protein. By binding both an unknown
  ligand (possibly 2-oxoglutarate) through its GAF domain and autophosphorylating
  in response to the PEP/pyruvate ratio, EINtr might sense the metabolic status of
  the cell and communicate it to the EIIAMan-like protein that would regulate the
  2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity accordingly. In addition, HprK/P is expected
  to slow phosphorylation of the EIIAMan-like protein by hindering the phosphotransfer
  through the PTS in response to changes in the FBP concentration or other metabolites.
  Solid arrows indicate metabolic reactions, large open arrows represent phosphoryl
  transfer between PTS proteins, and dashed arrows show putative regulatory processes.
  The enzyme HprK/P was also included in this scheme since it phosphorylates NPr on
  a conserved serine. The names of the genes encoding B. melitensis PTS and HprK/P
  proteins are put between brackets. The pentose phosphate pathway, which connects
  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glycolysis in B. melitensis, and the connection between
  TCA cycle and nitrogen metabolism starting from 2-oxoglutarate are indicated in
  grey. FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; CoA, coenzyme A;
  TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; NH4+, ammonium. P∼H-X and P∼S-X indicate PTS
  enzymes phosphorylated on histidine or serine, respectively.
