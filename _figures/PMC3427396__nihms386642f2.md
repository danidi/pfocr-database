caption: Termination steps during IgE-mediated activation. The cartoon expands on
  the behavior of SHIP presented in . This multi-domain enzyme is capable of regulating
  the presence of PIP3 which recruits various activation enzymes to the plasma membrane.
  But at the C-terminal end of SHIP, near the proline rich domain (PRD), a tyrosine
  phosphorylated by a src-family kinase, can recruit the adaptor protein dok (downstream
  of kinase) for which there are several forms. Dok recruits a rasGAP protein which
  down-regulates the activity of p21 ras, another small G-protein that is crucial
  in the initiation of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) pathway and other
  pathways to secretion. The MAPK kinase pathway (raf->MEK->Erk) specifically regulates
  cPLA2 and the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway but p21Ras controls other pathways
  as well. On the right side of the cartoon is a representation of the potential role
  of SHP-1 (SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase). SHP-1 represents a family of tyrosine
  phosphatases that are actively recruited into activation cascades, but there are
  also constitutively acting tyrosine phosphatases that control set-points for activation.
  The cartoon represents only a small subset of the negative feedback loops that operate
  during activation, but these two phosphatases act as negative feedback on early
  steps of the cascade.
