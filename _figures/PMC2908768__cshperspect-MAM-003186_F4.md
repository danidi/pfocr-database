caption: Cytokine signaling through the Jak/Stat pathway in mammary gland development.
  Sequential activation of Stat6 and Stat5 control alveologenesis during pregnancy.
  These Stats are activated in response to specific ligands, IL-4 and IL-13 (Stat6)
  and Prl (Stat5) that bind to receptors of the cytokine family. During involution,
  cell death is mediated by Stat3, which is activated by LIF and then by OSM, which
  share the common gp130 receptor. Stat signaling is negatively regulated by the family
  of SOCS proteins that are direct transcriptional targets of each Stat factor. Once
  activated, Stats bind to similar consensus sequences but activate transcription
  of distinct sets of target genes to control mammary gland development.
