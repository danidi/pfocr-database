caption: Glucose activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway. AC is activated by glucose through
  two different G-protein-coupled systems. The Gpr1-Gpa2-Rgs2 GPCR system senses extracellular
  glucose, while the Cdc25,Sdc25-Ras1,2-Ira1,Ira2 system senses intracellular glucose
  through glucose catabolism in glycolysis in a way that is not yet understood. The
  glucose-sensing GPCR, Gpr1, and the Cdc25,Sdc25 proteins stimulate guanine nucleotide
  exchange on Gpa2 and Ras1,2, respectively. Rgs2 and Ira1,2 act as GAPs on Gpa2 and
  Ras1,2, respectively. cAMP binds to the Bcy1 regulatory subunits of PKA causing
  dissociation and activation of the catalytic subunits, Tpk1-3. The Krh1,2 kelch
  repeat proteins mediate a cAMP-independent pathway triggered by the glucose-sensing
  GPCR system for direct activation of PKA, by lowering the affinity between catalytic
  and regulatory subunits. Metabolic reactions are depicted by dotted arrows; regulatory
  and signaling interactions by full arrows.
