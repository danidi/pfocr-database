caption: (A) Evaluation of Fas and FasL expression in SKOV3 cells transfected with
  control, BRCA1 or JNK siRNA and incubated or not with 5% ascites. (B) Model of ascites-induced
  apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Malignant ascites could induce JNK pathway and
  thus, expression of BRCA1, Fas and FasL. BRCA1 may be also involved in Fas and FasL
  upregulation. Overexpression and cytoplasmic localization of Daxx allows sensitization
  of the Fas-mediated apoptosis. FasL binding to death receptor Fas results in induction
  of apoptosis.
