caption: H2S and NO biosynthetic pathways in blood vessels. (A) L-cysteine is the
  substrate for the formation of H2S through three H2S-producing enzymes, L-cysteine
  is catalyzed by CSE to produce pyruvate, ammonia, and thiocysteine, the latter is
  then decomposed to cysteine and H2S. The endogenous H2S production by CBS is related
  with the condensation of homocysteine with L-cysteine, followed by the formation
  of cystathionine and H2S. Direct reaction of L-cysteine and α-ketoglutarate by CAT
  yields the release of 3-MP and L-glutamate, 3-Mercaptopyruvate is transported into
  the mitochondria where it is catalyzed to sulfurous acid, pyruvate and thiosulfate
  by 3-MST. In the presence of reduced glutathione, the thiosulfate is reduced to
  glutathione disulfide and H2S. It is well accepted that H2S can increase eNOS activity
  and thereby subsequent NO production directly or through AMPK/Akt signaling pathway.
  (B) NO is produced in all tissues by NOS-dependent (L-arginine-NO pathway) and -independent
  (nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway) pathways. A recently discovered pathway for NO generation
  is the serial reduction of the inorganic anions nitrate and nitrite. With the assistance
  of three isoforms of NOS including nNOS, eNOS, and iNOS, L-arginine is oxidized
  into L-citrulline with NO. NO is found ro increase CSE activity and expression and
  then stimulate H2S production. (C) In endothelial cells, vasoconstrictor agonists
  stimulate the release of Ca2+ and cause formation of calcium-calmodulin (CaM) via
  the PLCβ/IP3/DAG pathway. Then, CaM can simultaneously activate eNOS and CSE that
  yield NO and H2S, respectively. H2S, hydrogen sulfide; NO, nitric oxide; 3-MP, 3-mercaptopyruvate;
  CAT, cysteine aminotransferase; CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase;
