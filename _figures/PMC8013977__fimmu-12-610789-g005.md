caption: IL-15-JAK-STAT5 signaling for NK cell development. The IL-15Rα–IL-15 complex
  primarily induces the activation of the JAK–STAT5 pathway via recruiting JAK1 and
  JAK3. For signal transduction, JAK1 binds to the IL-2/IL-15Rβ and JAK3 combines
  with γc, inducing the recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT5. By oligomerizing
  into dimers and tetramers, phosphorylated STAT5a and STAT5b translocate into the
  nucleus to drive the expression of STAT-target genes encoding proteins related with
  NK cell development, survival, proliferation, and function, including MCL-1, BCL-2,
  and VEGF-A. Specifically, IL-15–JAK–STAT5 signaling also promotes the transcription
  of SOCS family members. SOCS proteins comprise a negative feedback loop to retrain
  the JAK–STAT5-mediated pathway in NK cell development.
