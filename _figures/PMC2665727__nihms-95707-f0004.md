caption: 'L1 retrotransposition pathway. The L1 retrotransposon is transcribed in
  the nucleus from an internal Pol II promoter and the resulting full-length RNA is
  exported to the cytoplasm. ORF1 and ORF2 are translated and subsequently form an
  RNP which may form a higher order structure. The resulting RNP is transported into
  the nucleus where retrotransposition takes place by TPRT. Steps are as follows:
  (1) transcription, (2) export to cytoplasm and translation, (3) RNP formation, (4)
  first strand cleavage, (5) cDNA synthesis, (6) second-strand cleavage, (7) second-strand
  cDNA synthesis, (8) repair, (9) ligation. Host factors involved are indicated in
  green (stimulatory) or red (inhibitory) at their putative site of action.'
