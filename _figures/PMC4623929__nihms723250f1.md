caption: Normally, the principal route for adrenocortical androgen production is via
  the classic pathway (solid line arrows). In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, large amounts
  of 17OHP are converted to androstenedione via this classic pathway and these are
  the common biomarkers used in CAH to estimate disease control. Accumulating 17OHP
  can also be converted to pdione via an alternative route termed the backdoor pathway
  (dotted arrows). Androsterone is produced by both the classic and backdoor pathways.
  The end product for both pathways is ultimately dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most
  potent androgen receptor agonist.
