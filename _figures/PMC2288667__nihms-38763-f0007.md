caption: Data from the genomes of the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella vectensis and
  the demosponge, Amphimedon queenslandica suggest that the origin of the Hedgehog
  signaling molecule arose in the eumetazoan ancestor (). The choanoflagellate, Monosiga
  ovata possesses a hint/intein “hog” containing gene (), but no gene possessing a
  signal or “hedge” domain has been found. The demosponge, A. queenslandica possesses
  both hint/intein genes as well as a gene possessing a “hedge” domain tethered to
  a fat-like cadherin (). An ortholog of this gene has been found in the N. vectensis
  genome. However, N. vectensis also possesses two true hedgehogs as well as three
  hint/intein genes. While Hint/intein containing genes have not been identified in
  most bilaterians surveyed, C. elegans, which lacks true hedgehog genes (; ), possesses
  two families of Hint/intein containing genes, with novel N-terminal domains (warthog
  and groundhog). However, a true hedgehog gene has been identified in the slowly
  evolving nematode, Xiphinema index (M. Blaxter pers. comm.). Based on phylogenetic
  analyses () it appears likely that nematode groundhog, warthog, and quahog genes
  are derived from an ancestral nematode true hedgehog gene (solid arrow), however
  additional data may be necessary to rule out the possibility that these genes could
  also be derived from non-bilaterian hint-only genes (dashed arrow) The hedgehog
  ligands diversified within the Vertebrata.
