caption: The model illustrates the mechanism for the effect of DAPT on modulating
  F-actin polymerization through PI3K/AKT/Cdc42 signaling by Non-canonical Notch pathway
  during cancer cell migration. (A) Rac1 and Cdc42 compete each other for G-actin
  to form different protrusive structures in cell migration. (B) DAPT activates PI3K/AKT/Cdc42
  pathway through non-canonical Notch signaling. Activation of Cdc42 enhance its competition
  with Rac1 to bind with G-actin, which polymerizes spike-like filopodia and inhibits
  Rac1-based lamellipodia formation, leading to the decrease of force generation at
  the front of cell and the reduction of cell migration.
