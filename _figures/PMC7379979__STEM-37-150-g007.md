caption: Model of the mechanisms of RhoA‐mDia1‐ and Cdc42‐regulated Activin B‐induced
  bone marrow‐derived mesenchymal stromal cell (BMSC) migration. The RhoA‐mDia1 pathway
  regulates Activin B‐induced BMSC migration by promoting membrane ruffling, microtubule
  morphology and focal adhesion signaling dynamics. Cdc42 mediates Activin B‐induced
  Golgi complex polarization at the leading edge of moving BMSCs. mDia1 is involved
  in the wound healing process mediated by BMSCs and induced by Activin B.
