caption: The different regulatory mechanisms of BANCR in different human malignancy.
  (A). BANCR induced proliferation via the activation of the Ras‐1/ERK and JNK pathway.
  BANCR also promoted migration and invasion in melanoma. BANCR promotes the proliferation
  and invasion of melanoma by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA to upregulate
  Notch2 expression by sponging miR‐204. (B). BANCR promote cell proliferation, migration,
  and invasion by activating MEK/ERK1/2 signalling pathway that regulates MMP1 and
  MMP2 in endometrial cancer. (C). BANCR induced cell proliferation and inhibited
  apoptosis via the upregulation of MiroRNA‐9 targeted NF‐kB1 expression in gastric
  cancer. (D). BANCR inhibited cell apoptosis and induced cell proliferation, migration
  and invasion via activating the ERK and JNK pathways. BANCR also induced invasion
  by EMT (upregulated vimentin, and downregulated E‐cadherin) in hepatocellular carcinoma.
  (E). BANCR inhibited cell proliferation by increasing p21 protein, and induced apoptosis
  by induction of G0/G1 arrest in colorectal cancer. BANCR promoted cell migration
  by EMT in colorectal cancer. (F). BANCR inhibited proliferation, migration, metastasis
  by inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in papillary thyroid carcinoma. It also
  induced apoptosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma. BANCR increased papillary thyroid
  carcinoma cell proliferation by activating autophagy, as well as activating cell
  cycle via EZH2/TSHR/Cyclin D pathway. (G). BANCR inhibited proliferation, migration
  by inhibition of JNK and P38 pathways in lung cancer. BANCR inhibited invasion of
  lung cancer by inhibition of EMT. Radiation upregulated BANCR's expression via the
  upregulation of HDAC3 and HDAC3 reversed the BANCR's protective effect on radiation‐induced
  cell death reversed radiation induced cell in lung cancer
