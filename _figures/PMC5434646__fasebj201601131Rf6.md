caption: Proposed mechanism of the interplay between mitochondrial complex II and
  FH in the stabilization of the HIF-α signaling pathway. Mitochondrial complex II,
  located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, consists of SDH-proteins and catalyzes
  the conversion of succinate to fumarate. FH, another mitochondrial enzyme, converts
  succinate to malate. In the case of a mutation in one of the SDH subunits (SDHA,
  SDHB, SDHC, or SDHD gene mutations) or FH genes, the intracellular concentration
  of succinate and fumarate rise, resulting in inhibition of 2-oxyglutarate-dependent
  dioxygenases, including PHD, KDMs, and the TET enzymes, and leading to HIF-stimulated
  increase of transcription of the gene encoding TH, and to hypermethylation of the
  DA D2-receptor gene (, , , , , ).
