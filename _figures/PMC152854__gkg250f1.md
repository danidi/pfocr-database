caption: Identification of a complete deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate pathway for isoprenoid
  synthesis. The dexoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) protein, for which a homolog
  had already been annotated in both H.pylori genomes (HP0354/JHP0328), is responsible
  for the first enzymatic step of the three distinct pathways that synthesize isoprenoid,
  thiamin and pyridoxol. Proteins involved in the subsequent enzymatic reactions had
  not been characterized biochemically in H.pylori or identified genetically in general.
  Therefore, the genome analysis data did not make it possible to draw any conclusions
  concerning the ability of H.pylori to synthesize de novo isoprenoid precursors,
  IPP and DMAPP. We were subsequently able to reconstitute the complete metabolic
  pathway for the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP by combining systematic sequence similarity
  searches and a review of recent literature. Note that the last step of IPP and DMAPP
  synthesis is catalyzed by the same protein (IspH) with a ratio of 5:1, respectively,
  in E.coli ().
