number: Figure 2
caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis and expression profiles of genes involved in apoptosis
  that were uniquely up regulated in ER+ cells in response to EPA. Cells were incubated
  with EPA for 6 and 24 hrs. RNA samples were isolated and hybridized on the cDNA
  microarray slides as detailed in materials and methods. Images were analyzed using
  GenePix 6.0 and data were analyzed using GeneSpring 10.1
