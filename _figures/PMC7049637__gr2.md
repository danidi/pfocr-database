caption: Proposed mechanisms involved in the anti-fibrotic activity of curcumin by
  inhibiting the activation of PSCs to acquire myofibroblast-like phenotypes. Curcumin
  attenuates the production of TNF-α-induced MCP-1. Besides, it can also significantly
  reduce the activation of MAPKs signaling, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
  P38 MAPK and ERK, which are pivotal in stimulating the production of inflammatory
  cytokines and mediators. Additionally, curcumin further down-regulates NF-κB signaling
  pathway by reducing its subunit P65. Apart from these, curcumin can notably reduce
  the gene expression of α-SMA, IL-1β, Col I and Col III as well as diminish PSCs
  activation by downregulating the mRNA expression levels of several fibrogenic mediators,
  including Acta 2, Col-α1 and FN1, under the stimulating effects of TGF-β.
