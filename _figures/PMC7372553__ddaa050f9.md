caption: Model of CTNND1 function in systemic disease. (A) CTNND1 mutations are not
  only implicated in conditions that affect epithelial structures but also systemic
  conditions that originate from mesenchymal roles of p120-catenin. Structures in
  pink circles have been described in previous publications on CTNND1 (,); structures
  in blue circles have been implicated previously in CTNND1-related disorders (,)
  and in this study. Structures in yellow circles have been identified in this study.
  (B) BCD is primarily due to disturbances in E-cadherin/p120 interactions. The inclusion
  of other organ systems described here highlights the involvement of other known
  molecular functions of p120, such as its role in the WNT signalling pathway and
  its interactions with Rho-GTPases, demonstrating its mesenchymal roles in producing
  these systemic conditions.
