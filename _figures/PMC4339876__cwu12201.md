caption: Phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in C. elegans. (A) The structures of choline
  and PG-choline are shown. (B) The de novo choline or Kennedy pathway (gray box)
  converts choline (Cho) into phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). The Kennedy enzymes are
  found ubiquitously in eukaryotes, except in Giardia lamblia. The nematode phosphobase
  methylation pathway (white box) converts phosphoethanolamine (pEA) into phosphocholine
  (PCho). The multiple methylation of pEA to PCho also occurs in plants and Plasmodium
  falciparum, catalyzed by a single phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase, PEAMT.
