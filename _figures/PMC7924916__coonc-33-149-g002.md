caption: 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses’ lifecycle and possible
  mechanisms of interference with p53 and its regulatory pathways. Panel a: severe
  acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) lifecycle,
  from entry into cells to release of newly synthetized virions. Viral particles recognize
  host receptors via spike glycoprotein (S protein), enter host cells by membrane
  fusion, releasing the RNA genome into the cytosol, where it is translated into the
  replicase proteins (see panel b). Replication occurs in virus-induced double-membrane
  vesicles (DMVs) derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in which incoming positive-strand
  genome serves as a template for full-length negative-strand RNA and sub genomic
  (sg)RNA, the translation of which results generates structural proteins and accessory
  proteins (N, S, M, and E). Maturation into the ER–Golgi complex leads to virion
  assembly and release from the plasma membrane. N, S, M, E: nucleocapsid, spike,
  membrane and envelope viral proteins, respectively. Panel b: viral genome and open
  reading frames, highlighting ORF1a encoding the viral polyprotein PP1a and PP1b
  (top) supporting the production of 16 nonstructural proteins (middle), including
  the multidomain protein nsp3 (bottom). Panel c: two antagonist mechanisms of interference
  with p53. Left, interaction of SUD-PLpro domains of nsp3 with RCHY1, inducing p53
  degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Right, interaction of nsp2 with
  prohibitins (PHB) 1 and 2, disrupting mitochondrial metabolism and causing the release
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn may activate p53 through a DNA-damage-dependent
  pathway.'
