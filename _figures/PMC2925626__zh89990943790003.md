caption: NF-κB signaling pathway was the most significant canonical pathway in HBMEC
  up-regulation. Genes, differentially regulated in HBMECs in response to Pf-IRBC
  coincubation, were clustered into canonical pathways using Ingenuity tool (Ingenuity
  Systems). The NF-κB pathway was statistically most significant (P = .001). Colored
  genes were up-regulated in the presence of Pf-IRBC.
