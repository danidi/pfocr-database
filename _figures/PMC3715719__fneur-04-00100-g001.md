caption: Comparison of known mitophagy pathways (Reticulocytes, PINK1/Parkin, and
  Fertilized oocyte) in four major steps. (1) Upstream signaling or mitochondrial
  damage activates mitophagy pathways. (2) The initial mitochondrial signaling or
  mitochondrial damage converges at a flagship protein, which amplifies the signal.
  (3) Mitochondria are transported to isolation membrane-rich sites and marked for
  either proteasomal or autophagic degradation. (4) Mitochondria are enveloped by
  isolation membranes and delivered to autophagosomes. Δψ, mitochondrial membrane
  potential; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; LGG-1, LC3, GABARAP,
  and GATE16 family 1; Mfn2, mitofusin 2; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NIX, NIP3-like
  protein X; PINK1, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1; Ub, ubiquitin; VDAC, voltage-dependent
  anion channel.
