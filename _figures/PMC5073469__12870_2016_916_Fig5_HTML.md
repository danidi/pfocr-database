caption: Overview of major metabolic pathways associated with Psy1 down-regulation
  in transgenic lines. Genes that were 2-fold greater up- or down-regulated are shown
  in red or blue, respectively. The number of candidate genes in a relevant pathway
  is indicated in brackets, and the detail of candidate genes in each pathway is listed
  in Table S7. 1,3BPG, 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate; 3PG, 3-phospho-D-glycerate;
  FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PSY, phytoene synthase; ZDS, zeta-carotene
