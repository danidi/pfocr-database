caption: 'The biosynthesis of fatty acids FAs begins with a primer molecule, usually
  acetic acid, in the form of its CoA ester or attached to an acyl carrier protein
  (ACP), which forms malonyl-CoA by the activity of the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
  Successive chain elongation, executed by adding malonyl-CoA as a chain extender
  to the single primer molecules through repeated multiple-step cycles catalyzed by
  the multifunctional FA synthase builds saturated short-chain FAs or medium-chain
  FAs. Acetyl-CoA is shown as primer example for even-numbered straight-chain FAs,
  and isovaleryl-CoA for odd-numbered monomethyl branched-chain FAs. Middle left:
  Long-chain-fatty-acid (LCFA) biosynthesis. Straight and branched medium-chain FAs
  are further elongated in two-carbon units using malonyl-CoA as donor through repeated
  four-step (condensation, reduction, dehydration and reduction) cycles catalyzed
  by an enzyme complex with four distinct enzymes. mmBCFA biosynthesis uses specific
  enzymes for some reactions. In C. elegans, for instance, ELO-3 condenses straight
  chain- and FAs, and ELO-5 and ELO-6 condense branched-chain FAs, whereas LET-767
  is used for the reduction of either. Middle Right: Biosynthesis of unsaturated FAs.
  Saturated FAs are desaturated to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FAs (MUFAs
  and PUFAs) by a wide range of desaturase-(delta 5-, 6-, 9, 12 and omega-3) and PUFA
  elongase-(omega-3 and 6) activities to generate a variety of unsaturated FAs with
  different lengths and different numbers of double bonds. In contrast to higher plants
  and mammals, C. elegans possesses all of the enzymes required for the de novo biosynthesis
  of 20:4(n-6) and 20:5(n-3) FAs. Starting with the primer acetyl-CoA, the biosynthesis
  of the PUFA 20:5(n-3) by this route involves ~ 30 distinct enzymes and 70 reactions.
  Bottom: Complex lipids. Products serve as building blocks for complex lipids, with
  saturated FAs dominating sphingolipids (SLs) and desaturated FAs dominating glycerols
  and phospholipids. Corresponding metabolic enzyme genes with experimentally confirmed
  functions in C. elegans are indicated in red.'
