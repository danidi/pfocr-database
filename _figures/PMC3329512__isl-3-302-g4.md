caption: Figure 4. The pyruvate/citrate and pyruvate/isocitrate pathways are initiated
  by the conversion of pyruvate to both oxaloacetate (via PC) and acetyl-CoA (via
  PDC), allowing the formation of citrate and subsequently isocitrate. Both citrate
  and isocitrate can be transported to the cytosol by the citrate-isocitrate carrier
  (CIC), where citrate can be converted to isocitrate by cytosolic aconitase. Cytosolic
  citrate can be cleaved by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate.
  Oxaloacetate can be converted to malate by cytosolic MDH (cMDH), also generating
  NADH, and then the coupling factor NADPH can be generated by conversion of malate
  to pyruvate by cME (as in the pyruvate/malate pathway). Pyruvate can then re-enter
  the mitochondria completing the cycle. Since the pyruvate/citrate cycle also forms
  cytosolic acetyl-CoA, it can generate malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA serves both as an
  intermediate in FA synthesis and also a potent inhibitor of FA oxidation at the
  level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1. Cytosolic isocitrate can directly
  yield NADPH by its conversion to 2OG by cICDH. Potentially, 2OG can be converted
  to oxaloacetate by cAAT, thereby “joining” the pyruvate/citrate cycle, generating
  NADPH a second time at the level of cME or alternatively, enter the mitochondria
  via OGC and join the TCA cycle, at the step subsequent to mICDH, and be metabolized
  to oxaloacetate. AAT, aspartate aminotransferase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACL,
