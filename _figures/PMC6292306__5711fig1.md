caption: 'Calcium movement into the mammary gland regulates maternal calcium homeostasis
  during lactation. Calcium flux into the mammary gland through the calcium release-activated
  calcium channel protein 1 (ORAI1) channel increases during lactation to support
  milk synthesis. Calcium is primarily exported out of the mammary gland in 2 ways:
  1) 60% is actively pumped out via the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA2) transporter
  on the apical membrane and 2) 40% is bound to milk proteins, primarily casein. Calcium
  concentrations are sensed by the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) on the basolateral
  side of the mammary epithelium. Calcium enters the golgi apparatus through calcium-transporting
  ATPase type 2C member (SPCA2). Calcium is also stored in the endoplasmic reticulum
  and is taken up by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA). As milk calcium
  concentrations increase and maternal blood calcium concentrations decrease, synthesis
  and secretion of PTHrP by the mammary epithelium increases. Then, parathyroid hormone
  related-protein (PTHrP) will bind to the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R)
  on the osteoblast (OB) cells. This, in turn, increases osteoclast (OC) differentiation
  and activity and subsequently increases calcium resorption in bone. This occurs
  through the production of receptor activated nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)
  by the OB, which binds to its receptor, receptor activated nuclear factor kappa
  B (RANK) on the OC. This pathway allows maternal calcium homeostasis to be restored.'
