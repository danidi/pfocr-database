caption: Cellular localization of OCRL1. A) OCRL1 (blue hexagons) has been localized
  to a number of cellular compartments. It is present at the TGN and various compartments
  of the endocytic pathway, where it resides at late-stage clathrin-coated pits, clathrin-coated
  vesicles, signaling endosomes, early or sorting endosomes and on recycling endosomes.
  OCRL1 has also been localized to the basal body of primary cilia, and it may also
  localize to the cilium itself. In maturing epithelia, OCRL1 transiently localizes
  to adherens and tight junctions. OCRL1 is recruited to phagosomes at a late stage
  in their formation, and is important for closure of the phagocytic cup as well as
  signaling events that occur post-sealing. OCRL1 is recruited to phagosomes generated
  by invading pathogenic bacteria such as Yersinia or Listeria, and has also been
  localized on intracellular inclusions generated by certain bacteria, e.g. Legionella
  or Chlamydia. B) OCRL1 localizes to the midbody in cells undergoing cytokinesis.
  C) OCRL1 has been localized to the lamellipodia of migrating fibroblasts.
