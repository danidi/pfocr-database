caption: Schematic representation of OTULIN regulating the NF-κB pathway in ischemic
  stroke. Ischemic stroke induced rapid activation of the NF-κB pathway, mainly shown
  by the activation of IKKs, the degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, and the
  increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. The activated NF-κB pathway leads
  to microglial activation along with a sharp increase in the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and the occurrence of inflammatory responses in the brain. LUBAC, which
  consists of HOIP, HOIL-1, and SHARPIN, participates in the assembly of ubiquitin
  chains on IKK complexes. The deubiquitinase OTULIN interacts with HOIP to cleave
  the Met-1 Ub on IKKγ, thus resulting in depression of the NF-κB pathway. OTULIN
  overexpression obviously inhibited the excessive activation of microglia and the
  production of inflammatory responses through suppressing the phosphorylation and
  degradation of IκBα and subsequently attenuating the nuclear translocation of NF-κB
  p65
