caption: There are two coagulation cascades, intrinsic and extrinsic, which converge
  into the common pathway. These cascades are advanced through proteolytic cleavage
  of coagulation factors.   represents factor prior to cleavage,   represents the
  cleavage product and   represents a proteolytic cleavage. HK, High molecular weight
  kininogen.
