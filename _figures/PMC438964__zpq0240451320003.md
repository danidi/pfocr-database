caption: Schematic representation of the regulation of transcription of hepcidin by
  the iron pathway (above) and inflammatory (LPS/IL-6 pathway) (below). The iron pathway
  requires Hfe, hemojuvelin, and probably tfr-2 outside of the hepatocytes. These
  components are not required for the inflammatory pathway. Although IL-6 is an effective
  mediator of the response to LPS, some other mediators formed in response to LPS
  may also stimulate the transcription of hepcidin, although the evidence for this
  is unclear.
