caption: The model for miR-214 regulation upon CC cell progression. SRF could bind
  to the miR-214 promoter region, located on chromosome 1 q24.3, and repress its expression.
  The restoration of miR-214 lowers the expression PTK6, thereby inhibiting the activity
  of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which in turn inhibits CC cell proliferation, migration,
  invasion, tumorigenesis, and metastasis.
