caption: 'Figure 1. Origin and fate of TMA in the human gut, and the Archaebiotics
  concept. Gut microbiota synthesis of TMA is realized from TMAO, choline, PC and
  L-carnitine. The TMA is then absorbed and goes to the liver, routes (A or (B). In
  the case of route (A), a partial or total defect in FMO3-oxidation into TMAO leads
  to increased level and diffusion of TMA in breath, urine and sweat. When FMO3 liver
  oxidation is functional (B), the increase of TMAO in blood is associated with atherosclerosis.,,
  Therefore, converting TMA directly in the gut using Archaebiotics belonging to the
  seventh methanogenic order, naturally-occurring in the gut, route (C) should be
  envisaged. Interestingly, these archaea are only able to perform methanogenesis
  using methyl compounds (see ), because the two other pathways are absent (CO2 reduction
  with H2 and aceticlastic pathway): this would increase the efficiency of TMA conversion.'
