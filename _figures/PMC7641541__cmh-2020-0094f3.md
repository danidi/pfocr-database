caption: Schematic graph showing that the complement system participates in the development
  of alcohol-induced liver disease. C3 convertase cleaves C3 to form C3a and C3b.
  ASP is the degraded product of C3a. C3b is an important component of C5 convertase.
  CR2-Crry is a site-targeted complement inhibitor that blocks all complement pathways
  at the C3 activation step. When anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a bind with their respective
  receptors, the TLR4/NF-κB pathway can be activated, resulting in the release of
  the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which participates in AFLD, either directly or
  indirectly, through the induction of insulin resistance. C3a and ASP bind to their
  receptor C5aR2 to promote the expression of Cyp2E1, which induces the production
  of ROS. The induced oxidative stress subsequently leads to the increased expression
  of Gly-tRF, which leads to AFLD via regulating the SIRT1 signaling pathway. The
  inflammatory response contributes to the development and progression of ALD. CR2,
  complement receptor 2; Crry, complement receptor 1-related protein y; ASP, acylation
  stimulating protein; Cyp2E1, cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily E, polypeptide
  1; GlytRFs, glycine tRNA-derived fragments; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR, toll-like
  receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; AFLD, alcoholic fatty liver disease;
  ALD, alcohol-induced liver disease.
