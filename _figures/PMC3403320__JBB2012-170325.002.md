caption: Multiple functions of the p21 tumor suppressor. This protein plays a crucial
  role in the p53 signaling pathway owing to its ability to inhibit cell cycle progression
  (e.g., by interacting with PCNA and cyclin/CDK complexes), influence gene expression
  indirectly, through interfering with DNA methyltransferase (MeTase) activity, and
  directly, by controlling the transcription of genes involved in senescence and mitosis,
  down-regulating apoptosis (e.g., through interaction with ASK-1), and positively
  regulating ATM and p53.
