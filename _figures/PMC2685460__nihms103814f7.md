caption: The model is based on the current findings and our previously published studies
  (, –). P. gingivalis fimbriae interact with the CD14/TLR2 complex leading to TLR2
  activation. Activated TLR2 induces TIRAP/MyD88-dependent signaling for NF-κB activation
  and induction of proinflammatory cytokines (proinflammatory pathway), and TIRAP/MyD88-independent
  signaling for transactivation of the CR3 adhesive activity (proadhesive pathway).
  The latter pathway proceeds via Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 (Cyt-1). Cytohesin-1
  is likely to function immediately downstream of PI3K, since it was previously shown
  to use PI3K-generated PIP3 for membrane docking and interaction with the CD18 cytoplasmic
  tail ().
