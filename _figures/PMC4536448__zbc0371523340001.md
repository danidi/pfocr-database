caption: HS biosynthetic pathway and reaction catalyzed by NDST-1. A, enzymatic modification
  steps required to produce HS. The polymerization step to form the polysaccharide
  backbone (-GlcA-GlcNAc-) is not shown. After NDST-1 modification, the polysaccharide
  undergoes C5-epimerization and 2-O-sulfation followed by 6-O-sulfation and more
  limited 3-O-sulfation. The shorthand keys for the symbols are depicted on the right
  side of the panel. B, reactions catalyzed by NDST-1. Two steps are involved to convert
  a GlcNAc residue to a GlcNS residue. First, NDST-1 removes the acetyl group to form
  GlcNH2, and the activity at this step is designated as N-deacetylase activity. Second,
  a sulfo group is transferred from the sulfo donor PAPS to the amino group to form
  GlcNS. C, locations of N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase domains in NDST-1. TM
  represents the transmembrane domain.
