caption: TORC1-dependent regulation of Gap1. The schematic diagram is based on literature
  evidence for the known interactions. Each node in the signaling pathway is annotated
  with the rank of its information flow score from TORC1 and colored with its functional
  classification. Yellow nodes represent kinase associated proteins, red nodes are
  transcription factors, and blue node (Sit4) is a phosphatase. The rest of nodes
  have a default color of grey. Ranking of nodes based on their information flow scores
  coincides with our prior knowledge on the structure of this pathway. Top/bottom
  ranked nodes are discriminated using the computed cutoff value (l) based on differentially
  expressed genes. The “?” indicates an unknown underlying mechanism, yet to be discovered,
  that connects TORC1 to the rest of transcription factors.
