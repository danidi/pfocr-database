caption: Representative post-injury CNS neuron in a robustly regenerating state. Acting
  as the effective driving force of CNS axon regeneration, some pro-growth receptor
  ligands (growth factors such as CNTF, etc.) coordinate with intracellular retrograde
  injury-sensing signaling pathways (the Stat3–Socs3 pathway), convergingly activating
  TFs and/or chromatin regulators to transmit the cellular signals into the cell nucleus.
  Direct manipulations on these nuclear elements (Sox11-OE, Klf6/7-OE, or p300-OE)
  could result in similar outcomes. The hub TFs and chromatin regulators may establish
  specific pro-regeneration chromatin states by influencing both the local accessibility
  and the distal cis interaction of the whole genome. DNA methylation is represented
  by '-Me' in the diagram. Histone modifications leading to the closed heterochromatin
  are represented by red dots, whereas histone modifications leading to the open euchromatin
  are represented by green dots. Such epigenome eventually results in a pro-regeneration
  transcriptional program. Meanwhile, the most efficient manipulation should also
  activate robust ribosomal protein synthesis to translate such pro-regeneration transcriptome
  into an entity of functional effector proteins, some for the upstream pathways and
  some for the transcriptional, and other terminal effector proteins transported to
  the growth cone and functioning to rebuild a penetrating growth cone, which could
  effectively reextend through the inhibitory environment around the injury site,
  and guide the axon toward certain temporal pathfinding cues.
