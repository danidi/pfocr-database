caption: 'The flagellar transcriptional regulatory cascade for Campylobacter jejuni
  and Helicobacter pylori. The flagellar genes and respective proteins included in
  the flagellar transcriptional cascade are shown. These factors are color-coded on
  the basis of their classification in the transcriptional regulatory cascade: red
  (class 1 genes), blue (class 2 genes), and green (class 3 genes). fliA (encoding
  σ28) and flgM are included as class 2 genes in C. jejuni, but these genes are dependent
  only partially on σ54 for expression. Formation of the flagellar T3SS (which is
  composed of FlhA, FlhB, FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR) has been proposed to create
  a signal detected by the FlgS sensor kinase, resulting in autophosphorylation of
  the protein. Phosphotransfer to the FlgR response regulator activates the protein,
  allowing for interactions with and stimulation of σ54. The FlhF GTPase is likely
  involved in a separate pathway that converges with or functions downstream of the
  FlgSR-T3SS pathway to fully activate expression of σ54-dependent class 2 genes.
  The T3SS facilitates the ordered secretion of the class 2 rod, ring, and hook proteins
  to complete the HBB complex. Secretion of the antisigma factor FlgM through the
  HBB complex relieves repression of σ28 activity, resulting in expression of class
  3 genes. The class 3 genes include flaA, which encodes the major flagellin, and
  those for other minor filament proteins. Other class 3 genes of C. jejuni appear
  to encode proteins not involved in motility and, instead, may be involved in virulence
  or colonization of C. jejuni. Abbreviations: HBB, hook-basal body; T3SS, type III
  secretion system.'
