caption: Crosstalk between the insulin/IGF signalling pathways and the potential targeting
  of let-7. The upregulation of let-7 microRNAs may block the overexpression of components
  of the INSR/IGF pathways resulting in reduced cell proliferation and increase sensitivity
  to therapy. Blue and yellow networks indicate shared pathways (INSR/IGF pathway)
  and protein domains (N- and C-domains), respectively. The node sizes are inversely
  proportional to the gene score rank determined by GeneMANIA. Shaded nodes indicate
  genes inputted into the software. Red circles are used to highlight key genes involved
  in the INSR/IGF pathway. The interacting network was generated from GeneMania. Microsoft
  PowerPoint v2013 was also used to make additional drawings including let-7 node,
  arrows indicating upregulation, inhibition and the subsequent possible effect of
  this inhibition INSR, insulin receptor; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor 1; IGF2,
  insulin-like growth factor 2; IGFBP, Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein;
  INS-IGF2, Insulin, isoform 2; INSL, Insulin-like; INSRR, insulin receptor-related
  receptor; INS, insulin; PAPPA2, pappalysin-2; RLN, relaxin.
