caption: Under hypoxic and ischemic conditions, accumulated succinate was released
  to extracellular milieu. Extracellular succinate activated GPR91 receptor and its
  downstream PKCδ/ERK1/2 signaling cascades. Succinate increased the translocation
  of Drp1 to mitochondria via PKCδ activation, and induced MFF phosphorylation via
  ERK1/2 activation both in a GPR91-dependent manner, leading to mitochondrial fission
