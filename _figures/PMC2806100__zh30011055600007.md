caption: 'Scheme of the signaling mechanism-mediated apoptosis in pancreatic parenchymal
  cells during pancreatitis. A: 2 pathways mediate apoptosis in pancreatitis. The
  mitochondrial pathway is initiated by cytochrome c release followed by caspase activation
  (). The p53-mediated pathway also stimulates activation of caspases. Inflammatory
  cells inhibit the p53-mediated pathway but do not affect the mitochondrial pathway.
  B: detailed scheme of the p53-mediated pathway. Inflammatory cells inhibit this
  pathway through upregulating Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53.'
