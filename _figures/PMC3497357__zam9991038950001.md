caption: 'Schematic representation of the de novo CCM biosynthesis pathway. The central
  intermediates of the pathway shown are PEP (step 1), E4P (step 2), DAHP (step 3),
  3-dehydroquinate (3-DHQ; step 4), 3-DHS (step 5), PCA (step 6), catechol (step 7),
  CCM (step 8), and adipic acid (step 9). Adipic acid can be produced by chemical
  hydrogenation (dashed arrow). Bold arrows indicate heterologous enzymatic reactions:
  3-DHSD, 3-DHS dehydratase; PCA-DC, PCA decarboxylase; CDO, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase.
  Undesired yeast metabolic reactions are indicated by gray arrows.'
