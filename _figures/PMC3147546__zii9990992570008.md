caption: Working model for Hk1/Rrp1 and Rrp2/RpoN/RpoS TCS during the enzootic cycle.
  At the onset of feeding, Hk1 senses unique host- and/or tick-derived molecules generated
  within the feeding site. These feeding-specific molecules must be small enough to
  rapidly traverse the spirochete's outer membrane and engage Hk1's D1 and D2 periplasmic
  sensor domains. During acquisition, spirochetes first encounter these molecules
  as they migrate into the feeding site, while spirochetes within flat nymphs (or
  larvae infected by immersion) would encounter these ligands solely within the midgut
  (). The Hk1/Rrp1-directed synthesis of c-di-GMP initiates an adaptive response that
  enables spirochetes either to evade killing by noxious substances within midgut
  epithelium as feeding progresses (, , , , ) or to adjust metabolically to growth
  within the arthropod vector. In contrast to the Rrp2/RpoN/RpoS pathway, which is
  active (ON) only within feeding nymphs, the Hk1/Rrp1 TCS is essential for survival
  during both the larval and nymphal blood meals.
