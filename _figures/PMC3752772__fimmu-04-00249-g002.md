caption: NF-κB activation pathways triggered by TNF family signaling. Interaction
  of TNF family ligand (RANK ligand, CD40 ligand, and lymphotoxin α and β complex)
  with their respective receptors (RANK, CD40, and LtβR) induces activation of NF-κB
  pathways. Interaction between the ligand and its receptor induce the binding of
  TRAF-family proteins to the cytoplasmic domains of TNF receptors. TRAF-family proteins
  in turn activate downstream serine/threonine kinase cascade. These kinases trigger
  the degradation of inhibitory proteins that sequester NF-κB in cytosol, thereby
  leading to the translocation and transcriptional activation of NF-κB members. NF-κB
  pathways are classified into classical and non-classical pathway. In the non-classical
  pathway, NF-κB complex consisting of RelB and p52 is activated. NIK is critical
  for the non-classical NF-κB pathway. TRAF6, a member of the TRAF protein family,
  was reported to regulate only the classical NF-κB pathway, which causes nuclear
  translocation of mainly the RelA complex. On the other hand, other TRAF members
  function in the non-classical NF-κB pathway by binding to the TNF family receptors.
