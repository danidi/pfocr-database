caption: '2.1. BDNF released by glial cells (and activation of the tropomyosin receptor
  kinase B [TrkB]) has protective effects in dopaminergic cells that can potentially
  be associated with the regulation of neuronal bioenergetics. 2.2 In astrocytes,
  energy can be stored as glycogen or it can be metabolized via glycolysis to meet
  energy demands. Glucose metabolism is also directed to lactate production that can
  be shuttled to neurons. In neurons PFKFB3 is constantly degraded and thus, they
  depend primarily in oxidative phosphorylation to meet their energy demands. GPI
  has been demonstrated to exert a protective effect against α-synuclein toxicity
  via glycolysis. 2.3. Downstream the glycolytic pathway a number of enzymes have
  been shown to be altered / regulated in PD and by PD-related risk factors. Aldolase
  (ALDO), GAPDH and enolase (ENO) are found aggregated and oxidized in PD. Amyloid-like
  α-synuclein fibrils are expected to interact with and likely inhibit metastable
  glycolytic enzymes such as ALDO. Other groups have reported on the role of Parkin
  inhibiting PKM activity by ubiquitination. 2.4. Spontaneous generation of methylglyoxal
  is thought to account for 0.1–0.4% of glycolytic flux. Accumulation of AGEs and
  dopamine-related methylglyoxal derivatives is linked to PD. DJ-1 is a cofactor-independent
  GLO III system that detoxifies methylglyoxal while also generating D-lactate that
  can contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial function. DJ-1 is a redox-sensitive
  protein whose protective effects against PD-related insults can be impaired by oxidative
  stress. 2.5 In neurons, glucose is primarily metabolized via the PPP to generate
  NADPH that provides reducing equivalents for antioxidant defense. Astrocytes have
  higher levels of NADPH and G6PD, and in glial cells, NADPH also has a pro-oxidant
  role by providing reducing equivalents for the generation of ROS by NOX and NOS.
  In addition, the ribose-5-P from the PPP is used for the generation ADP-ribose that
  is used during DNA-damage repair as a substrate for PARP-1 mediated ADP-ribosylation.
  NADPH is also regenerated by IDH1 in cytosol (2.6) and in the mitochondria by Nnt
  (2.7), and both systems have been reported to protect against PD-related insults
  MPP+ and paraquat. 2.8. Alterations in the TCA cycle have also been found associated
  with PD. In the mitochondria, pyruvate decarboxylation by PDH is a necessary step
  for the generation of acetyl-CoA and Mn (manganese), a PD-risk factor has been reported
  to inhibit its activity. Aconitase (ACO) inactivation by oxidative stress is a biomarker
  of oxidative damage induced by PD-related insults or PINK1 mutants, while a decrease
  in OGDH is found in PD. 2.9. A decrease in Complex I activity is found in PD. In
  addition Complex I has been reported to be targeted by environmental toxicants acting
  as Complex I inhibitors or inducing oxidative stress. PD-related genes DJ-1 and
  PINK1 regulate Complex I activity via direct interaction or phosphorylation of its
  subunits. 2.10. The mitochondrial shuttles enable electrons and precursors transport
  across the inner membrane. Glutamate is metabolized to glutamine by GS an enzyme
  exclusively present in the astrocytes. Glutamine is shuttled from astrocytes to
  neurons where it is metabolized back to glutamate by GLS. A number of metabolites
  act as substrates for the activity of signaling proteins (highlighted in green circles).
  Prolyl hydroxylase (PDH)-dependent hydroxylation of HIF-1α requires 2-oxoglutarate.
  2.11. One-carbon metabolism of serine to glycine and cysteine (via the transsulfuration
  pathway) contribute to the formation of GSH. 2.12. Neurons very poorly metabolize
  FFA to obtain energy due the high O2 demand and resultant generation of superoxide
  anion (O2•−) from β-oxidation. However, 20% of total adult brain energy comes from
  FFA oxidation, mostly in astrocytes, but its functional relevance is unclear. Enzymes
  highlighted in blue circles are those within central carbon metabolism found to
  be modulated by oxidative stress and PD-related risk factors. PD-related genes are
