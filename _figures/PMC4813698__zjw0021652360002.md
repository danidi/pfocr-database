caption: H4K20me2 stabilizes 53BP1 on sites of DNA-damage through its Tudor domain.
  a and b, upon DNA-damage Ku70 (purple) binds to the exposed DNA-ends and recruits
  Set8 (orange). SETD8 mono-methylates H4K20 (red lollipop) at the site of damage.
  c, subsequently SUV4-20H1 and/or SUV4-20H2 (blue) use the H4K20me1 as a substrate
  and convert in into H4K20me2 (double-red lollipops). 53BP1 (green) binds to sites
  of damage and gets stabilized on chromatin by directly interacting with H4K20me2
  through its Tudor domain followed by other proteins in the DNA-damage repair pathway.
  d, alternatively, H4K20me1 is stabilizing 53BP1 at the sites of damage and induces
  DNA-damage repair.
