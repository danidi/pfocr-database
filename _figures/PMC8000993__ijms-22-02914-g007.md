caption: Simplified schematic of crosstalk between JA and ABA signaling pathways.
  The interaction between JAZ and ABI3 and ABI5 plays an important part in JA and
  ABA synergy. JA-mediated JAZ degradation releases ABI3 and ABI5, the positive TFs
  of ABA signaling. ABA also induces JA biosynthesis, which is thought to be mediated
  by the ABA-activated AREB/ABF TF members based on a recent study in rice. Antagonistically,
  the ABA receptor PYL6 interacts with MYC2 and negatively regulates its activity
  in an ABA-dependent manner. KEG acts as a negative regulator of both JA and ABA
  signaling by stabilizing JAZ12 and triggering ABI5 degradation. The transcriptional
  activity of ABI5 is also repressed through physical interaction with ICE1. ICE1,
  as a negative regulator of ABA signaling, is repressed by DELLA proteins of the
  GA signaling pathway. ABI5, ICE1, and DELLA proteins are also targets of JAZ proteins.
