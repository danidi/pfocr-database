caption: Arf is induced by potentially oncogenic signals stemming from overexpression
  of oncogenes such as c-Myc, E2F-1, and activated Ras. This induction quenches inappropriate
  mitogenic signaling by diverting incipient cancer cells to undergo p53-dependent
  and -independent growth arrest or cell death. Arf expression is repressed by a number
  of nuclear proteins, such as Bmi1, Twist, Tbx2/3, and Pokemon. Dmp1 is unique in
  that it directly binds and activates the Arf promoter and induces cell cycle arrest
  in an Arf-dependent fashion. Both Dmp1-null and heterozygous mice show hypersensitivity
  to develop tumors in response to carcinogen DMBA and γ-irradiation. This phenotype
  could be explained by the inactivation of the Arf-Mdm2-p53 pathway in the absence
  of the functional Dmp1 protein, although it is possible that Dmp1 has targets other
  than Arf. D-type cyclins inhibit Dmp1’s transcriptional activity in a Cdk-independent
  fashion when E2Fs do not bind to the same promoter; however, D-cyclins cooperate
  with Dmp1 to activate the Arf promoter. The Dmp1 promoter is efficiently activated
  by the oncogenic Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK-Jun pathway but is repressed by overexpressed c-Myc,
  E2Fs, and by physiological mitogenic signaling. The induction of Arf by oncogenic
  Ras is largely dependent on Dmp1. We recently reported that the Dmp1-Arf pathway
  was inhibited by NF-κB proteins in response to genotoxic stress signaling ().
