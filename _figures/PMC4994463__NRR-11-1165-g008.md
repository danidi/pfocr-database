caption: 'Schematic of “Inhibition of MMPs” signaling pathway at 1, 4, 7, and 14 days
  after nerve crush injury.Differentially expressed genes are shown in red (up-regulated)
  and green (downregulated). Stronger colors represent higher fold changes. MMP: Matrix
  metalloproteinase; ADAM: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin
  motifs; TIMP: tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase.'
