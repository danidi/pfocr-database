caption: 'OI genes involved in collagen biosynthesis and maintenance of bone homeostasis.
  Growth factors and cytokine signal through cell surface receptors to initiate an
  intracellular signal cascade (a). The transduction of the signal results in the
  nuclear translocation of transcription factors to regulate the expression of genes
  involved in osteoblast differentiation or function and collagen biosynthesis. Several
  regulated genes encode proteins that upon secretion influence osteoclast formation
  and activity (RANKL, osteoprotegerin, sclerostin; not shown). The α1- and α2-chains
  of collagen type I, the main collagen produced in osteoblasts, are translated into
  the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (b). Molecular chaperones support the folding
  of collagen chains enabling hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues by hydroxylases
  as well as subsequent glycosylation that is indispensable for proper formation of
  triplehelical collagen (c). The procollagen is secreted by a coat protein complex
  II (COP II)-mediated vesicular transport through the Golgi network into the extracellular
  space. Molecular chaperones and modifying enzymes dissociate pH-dependently from
  procollagen in the Golgi intermediate compartment and circulate COP I-mediated back
  to the ER (d). Integral proteins in the ER and Golgi membranes, such as ion channels
  or ER stress sensors, maintain the intracellular homeostasis and in that way preserve
  the secretory pathway (e). The N- and C-propeptides of the secreted procollagen
  are cleaved off by extracellular peptidases (f) and the processed, mature collagen
  molecules form a collagen network that is crosslinked and mineralized. Several collagenous
  and non-collagenous proteins interact with type I collagen to form the bone extracellular
  matrix (ECM) (g). Genes, in which mutations have been linked to osteogenesis imperfecta
  or related diseases, are indicated. These genes are involved in signal transduction
  and gene expression (grey), translation (brown), post-translational modification
  (red), ER homeostasis (purple), proteolytic processing (blue) or ECM structure,
  and mineralization (green). *MESD is an ER-resident chaperone for LRP proteins,
  co-receptors of the WNT signaling pathway. #SPARC can act as a chaperone in the
  ER as well as support mineralization of the collagen matrix extracellularly'
