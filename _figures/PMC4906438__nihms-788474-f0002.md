caption: 'Summary of mechanisms regulating FGF gradient formation: FGF ligands from
  the source cell are bound by HSPG side chains to prevent their diffusion farther
  away from the source tissue. FGF ligands bound to the receptors initiate FGF signaling
  cascade that is subject to feedback regulation at various levels, mainly by FGF
  inhibitors. Alternatively, FGF mRNA can undergo decay as cells move away from the
  local expression domain. FGF ligands and receptors can also be endocytosed to follow
  a mostly degradative pathway. FGF ligands can also be locally sequestered by the
  formation of microluminal structures.'
