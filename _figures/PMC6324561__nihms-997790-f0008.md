caption: Postsynaptic ASIC1a channels are activated by drops in the pH in the synaptic
  cleft associated with striatal synaptic activities, leading to cation (such as Na+
  or Ca2+) influx. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates the downstream CaMKII-ERK
  signaling pathway. Whereas CaMKII presumably contributes to actin dynamics to promote
  structural remodeling of dendritic spines and regulates postsynaptic distribution
  and function of NMDAR, ERK signaling presumably participates in the activity-dependent
  transcriptional regulation of a set of neuronal proteins, which, in turn, drive
  long-term synaptic plasticity. Together, the ASIC1a-CaMKII-ERK signaling cascade
  represents a novel molecular mechanism that facilitates synaptic remodeling in the
  striatum, which is important for procedural motor learning.
