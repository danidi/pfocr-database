caption: Hypothesized asthma cascade in hapten immune contact sensitized mice, consist
  of B-1 cell- to immunoglobulin M- (IgM) to complement-driven airway responses. The
  postulated cascade of events are shown from immunization to airway antigen challenge
  in order to elicit airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) just 1 day later. Trinitrophenyl
  (TNP) hapten skin contact immunization (upper left) activates TNP antigen-specific
  B-1 cells in pleural and peritoneal cavities to migrate to the lymphoid tissues.
  There, the B-1 cells probably mature into cells that secrete IgM which enter the
  systemic circulation (centre). Then, subsequent TNP airway challenge at 1 day results
  in the formation of local immune complexes of anti-TNP IgM binding with TNP-self
  conjugates formed in the airway tissues. These antigen–antibody complexes (upper
  right) activate complement, and component C5 generates C5a. The C5a (lower right)
  then either directly binds and activates C5a receptors in the airways, or acts indirectly
  by activating local mast cells or platelets via their C5a receptors to release bronchoconstrictive
  mediators. Either pathway then induces an immediate airway response (IR) peaking
  at 15–30 min and subsequent AHR measured at 24–48 hr (lower right).
