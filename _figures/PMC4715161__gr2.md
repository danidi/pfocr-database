caption: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) activation
  by TGF-β in mesangial cells. In the absence of TGF-β1 stimulation, TAK1 associates
  with TGF-β receptor type I (TβRI) through complex formation with TAB2 and TRAF6.
  Upon TGF-β1 stimulation and formation of TβRI–TβRII heterotetrameric complexes,
  autopolyubiqitination of TRAF6 leads to polyubiquitination (Ub) of TAK1, by which
  TAK1 is released from the receptor complexes. The released TAK1 interacts with TAB1,
  which in turn induces autophosphorylation of TAK1 for activation. TAK1 is activated
  by TGF-β1 stimulation in a TβRI kinase activity-independent manner. TAK1 transmits
  TGF-β1 signal to downstream signaling pathways such as MKK3–p38 or MKK4–JNK and
  promotes degradation of Inhibitory κ-B (Iκ-B), which in turn lead to the activation
  of transcription factors such as Activating Transcription Factor 2 (ATF2), Activator
  Protein 1 (AP-1), and NF-κB, respectively, to regulate the expression of ECM, including
  collagens and fibronectin, and inflammatory cytokines. TAK1 also crosstalks with
  the Smad pathway, and I-Smads regulate TAK1 function positively and negatively.
