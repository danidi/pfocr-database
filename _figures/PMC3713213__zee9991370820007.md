caption: Signaling pathways showing mechanisms involved in the protective effects
  of cardiac-specific CYP2J2 transgenic mice subjected to diabetic stress. In case
  of high glucose and AngII, GLUT4 expression on the cell membrane is deceased, reduces
  the ability of glucose transport, and finally increases intracellular calcium, promotes
  NFTA into the nucleus, enhances transcription, leading to cardiac hypertrophy. CYP2J2/EETs
  directly increase the transfer of GLUT4 to the cell membrane and may also via IRS-1-PI3K/AKT
  activation indirectly, thus reversing the process of cardiac hypertrophy. On the
  other hand, CYP2J2/EETs alleviate cardiac hypertrophy through activation of IRS-1-PI3K/AKT
  pathway, up-regulation of AMPK and eNOS, and down-regulation of c-Jun. Meanwhile,
  CYP2J2/EETs raise the expression amount of PPARγ, inhibit PDK4, reduce the toxicity
  of FFA, and relieve myocardial hypertrophy.
