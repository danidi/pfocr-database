caption: a) Dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC) are capable of responding to bacterial
  insult and directly respond to Gram-negative bacteria via recognition of the lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) component of the bacterial cell membrane, which leads to production of effector
  cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-2. DETC
  also respond to Staphylococcus aureus infection and aid in the recruitment of neutrophils
  by producing IL-17A. The abundant presence of the skin commensal, Staphylococcus
  epidermis (S. epidermis) tunes IL-1 signaling in the skin by inducing keratinocyte
  production of IL-1α and IL-1 Receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), which in turn induce
  both DETC and dermal γδ T cells to produce IL-17A. In doing so, S. epidermis mediates
  effector T cell responses in the skin and promotes protection against Leishmania
  major infection. S. epidermis also aids proper wound healing by providing an optimal
  inflammatory environment through the production of small molecules that act on keratinocytes
  via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) to dampen the TLR3-induced production of the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines TNFα and IL-6. Germ-free mice have faster wound healing and no scarring
  when compared to conventionally housed mice, indicating that the skin microbiota
  has a negative effect on wound healing and scaring. To date, the role of the host
  microbiome in DETC function is unknown. b) The microbiome conditions γδ IEL effector
  functions through an intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88 (MyD88) pathway. Microbiome conditioning of γδ IEL leads
  to production of several AMP, including Regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma
  (RegIIIγ) and collectively facilitate early protection against invasion by intestinal-resident
  bacteria. Activated γδ IEL further induce an anti-viral response by producing Type
  I/III IFNs which in turn induce up-regulation of anti-viral IFN-responsive genes
  in intestinal epithelial cells. Upon intestinal epithelial damage, γδ IEL again
  aid in host protection by mounting an anti-bacterial response which includes RegIIIγ
  production. This response is also shaped by the microbiome which acts directly on
  γδ IEL, through a MyD88-dependent mechanism, to limit early penetration by opportunistic
  bacteria following tissue injury. γδ IEL further produce pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-1β) and chemokines that recruit additional effector cells to the site of damage.
