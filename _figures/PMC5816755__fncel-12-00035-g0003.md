caption: Non-pharmaceutical interventions restore proper signaling within the HPA
  axis and between higher structures. Exercise increases dendritic complexity and
  BDNF expression in the hippocampus, which restores negative input onto the hypothalamus
  to restore proper HPA axis output (1). Decreased CRF release stabilizes MC activation
  and infiltration associated with chronic pain disorders (2), thereby reducing peripheral
  nociceptive input. Exercise influences the descending pain pathway, likely through
  release of endogenous opioids, increasing neuronal activity, and balancing excitatory
  and inhibitory transmission (3). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alters the intrinsic
  functional connectivity (iFC) between brain regions associated with pain management,
  including connections between the prefontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala and somatosensory
  cortex and the basal ganglia network (BGN) (4). Cortical and hippocampal gray matter
  densities are also increased in patients following CBT (5).
