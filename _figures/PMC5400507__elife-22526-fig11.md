caption: 'During the G/S phase transition, changes in the expression of two NPFs and
  their receptors act in concert to regulate the NO level, thus shaping phase-related
  locomotor plasticity. During crowding, the levels of two NPF systems decrease and
  promote NO level, resulting in higher locomotor activity. During isolation, the
  levels of two NPF systems increase and reduce NO level, thus leading to lower locomotor
  activity. Arrows indicate increased or decreased levels or activity.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22526.033'
