caption: 'During ALI, production of reactive oxygen species activates Nrf2 and autophagy.
  Nrf2 pathway. The transcription factor Nrf2 binds to Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex to be ubiquitinated and degraded. During ALI/ARDS, ROS modify cysteine
  151 in Keap1 (C151), affecting its interaction with Nrf2. As a result, Nrf2 is no
  longer ubiquitinated and is stabilized. Newly synthesized Nrf2 accumulates in the
  cytosol, translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes with small Maf proteins, and binds
  to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the regulatory regions of its target
  genes to promote their transcription (Canonical Nrf2 activation). Nrf2 can also
  be regulated by autophagy during ALI/ARDS. The autophagy substrate protein p62 binds
  to Keap1, sequestering it into the autophagosome and allowing for Nrf2 accumulation
  (Non-canonical Nrf2 activation). Autophagy pathway. ALI/ARDS induce autophagy, a
  bulk degradation pathway that occurs in three main stages: i) initiation, ii) elongation,
  and iii) fusion. Initiation involves the formation of the phagophore, which then
  elongates to encapsulate damaged proteins and organelles in a double membrane bound
  autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with the lysosome, and the damaged cargo
  is degraded by lysosomal hydrolases.'
