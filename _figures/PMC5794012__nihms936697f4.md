caption: An overview of the main metabolic pathways affected by the storage lesion
  in RBCs during routine storage in the blood bank. Lipolysis and lipid oxidation
  are excluded for simplification. Of note, omics technologies, such as proteomics
  and interactomics,, have revealed the unanticipated complexity of the RBC metabolic
  machinery, suggesting that cytosolic versions of Krebs cycle enzymes (e.g., malate
  dehydrogenase, alanine and aspartate transaminases, ATP citrate lyase, fumarase,
  and pyruvate carboxylase) might allow the mature RBC to metabolize tri- and dicarboxylates,
  as an alternative route to generate reducing coenzymes NADH and NADPH other than
  glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Malate levels in RBCs stored in AS-3
  are adapted from D’Alessandro et al. Oxidative stress–dependent modulation of metabolic
  enzymes (G6PDH) and functional proteins involved in oxygen transport and oxygen-dependent
  metabolic modulation are adapted from Wither et al. and Haines et al. (under review).
