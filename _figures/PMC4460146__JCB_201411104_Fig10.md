caption: Model of the role of Sag in regulation of KrasG12D-induced papillomagenesis.
  Under Sag+/+ conditions, Kras activation initiates the MAPK signaling pathway to
  generate high levels of ROS, which block mTORC1 activity to induce autophagy and
  senescence in a subset of keratinocytes, delaying the process of skin papilloma
  formation. Upon Sag deletion, Sag substrates, Erbin, and Nrf2 accumulate. Increased
  Erbin binds to Sur8 to block Kras–Raf signaling, leading to reduced ROS production,
  whereas increased Nrf2 causes transcriptional activation of several antioxidant
  proteins () to scavenge ROS. Reduced ROS relieves mTORC inactivation to block autophagy
  and senescence, leading to an accelerated papillomagenesis with a much shortened
  latent period and increased incidence.
