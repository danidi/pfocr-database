caption: Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in RAF265 responding versus
  nonresponding tumors. Ingenuity software was utilized to recognize pathways connecting
  genes that were differentially expressed in RAF265 responding versus nonresponding
  patients. A, Pathway analysis of genes involved in cell development and growth regulation
  that are differentially expressed in BRAFWT responding tumors to RAF265 versus those
  not responding to RAF265. B, Pathway analysis of genes involved in cell signaling,
  nucleotide metabolism, and small molecule biochemistry that are differentially expressed
  in BRAFWT tumors responding to RAF265 versus those not responding to RAF265. C,
  Pathway analysis of genes involved in cell signaling interactions that are differentially
  expressed in RAF265 responding versus nonresponding tumors, irrespective of BRAF
  mutation status.
