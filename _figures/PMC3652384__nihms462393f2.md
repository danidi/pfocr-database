caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanism of late PC. The PC stimulus activates
  at least two signaling pathways: The PKCε-Src/Lck-NF-κB pathway and the JAK1/JAK2-STAT1/STAT3
  pathway. PKCs activates the Src and Lck tyrosine kinases leading to tyrosine phosphorylation
  of IκBα (the inhibitor of NF-κB); in addition, PKCε directly activates IKKα/IKKβ,
  leading to inhibition of IκBα. NF-κB translocates to the nucleus where it binds
  to its cognate sequence on the promoter region of target genes, including iNOS and
  COX-2. The PC ischemia also activates JAK1 and JAK2, which then tyrosine phosphorylate
  and activate STAT1 and STAT3. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, full activation
  of STAT1 and STAT3 requires also serine phosphorylation via a PKCε-Raf-1-MEK1/2-p44/42
  MAPK signaling pathway. The activated STAT1/STAT3 hetero-dimer translocates to the
  nucleus where it binds to the promoter of target genes. The combinatorial actions
  of NF-κB and STAT1/STAT3, and almost certainly other transcription factors, result
  in transcriptional activation of iNOS, COX-2, HO-1, and ecSOD, leading to the synthesis
  of the respective proteins. (A multitude of transcription factors are likely to
  be mobilized during late PC and to lead to the recruitment of cardioprotective genes,
  acting in concert.) iNOS produces NO which directly protects the myocardium; in
  addition, NO activates COX-2, leading to the synthesis of cardioprotective prostanoids,
  mainly PGI2 and PGE2. It follows from this scheme that the activity of newly-synthesized
  COX-2 protein requires iNOS-dependent NO generation whereas the activity of iNOS
  does not require COX-2-dependent prostanoid generation; thus, COX-2 is downstream
  of iNOS in the pathophysiological cascade of late PC. In addition, NO can also induce
  HO-1. Thus, iNOS-derived NO can protect the myocardium from recurrent ischemia via
  direct actions, via activation of COX-2-dependent synthesis of cardioprotective
  prostanoids, and via generation of HO-1 byproducts (CO and biliverdin). Among the
  products of COX-2, PGE2 and/or PGI2 appear to be the most likely effectors of cytoprotection.
  A similar upregulation of COX-2 can be elicited pharmacologically by δ-opioid receptor
  agonists but not by adenosine A1 or A3 receptor agonists'
