caption: S-nitrosylation in classical TNF-NF-kB signaling. When TNFα binds its receptor
  TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), it stimulates the formation of complex I that results in
  the recruitment of TNFR-associated via death domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), cellular
  inhibitor of apoptosis cIAPs (cIAP1 and cIAP2). The cIAPs, via their E3 ubiquitin
  ligases activities, promote the ubiquitination (through K63-linked ubiquitin chains)
  of RIPK1, TRAF2, and themselves which subsequently allows the recruitment of other
  complexes. Linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) associates with ubiquitin
  linkages attached to cIAPs, transforming growth factor-β activated kinase (TAK1)/TAK1-binding
  2 (TAB2)/TAK1 binding 3 (TAB3) associates with ubiquitin linkages attached to RIPK1
  and inhibitor of kappaB alpha (IkBα) kinase (IKK) complex associates with ubiquitin
  linkages attached to TRAF2. LUBAC ubiquitylates (through M1-linked ubiquitin chains)
  IKKγ and stably recruits the IKK complex. The IKK complex (IKKβ) is then phosphorylated
  by TAK1/TAB2/TAB3. IKKβ in turn phosphorylates IkBα that leads to the addition of
  K48-linked ubiquitin chains and its proteasome-mediated degradation with the subsequent
  activation and nuclear translocation of the NF-kB transcription factor heterodimer.
  S-nitrosylation of IKKβ subunit prevents the phosphorylation of IkBα and its degradation.
  S-nitrosylation of either p50–p65 NF-kB subunits inhibits DNA binding and transcriptional
  upregulation of NF-kB target genes. In the absence of cIAPs or in presence of CYLD,
  which allows the removal of K63-linked ubiqtuitin chains, RIPK1 translocate to the
  cytoplasm to induce the formation and activation of complex II that leads to apoptosis.
