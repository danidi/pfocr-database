caption: Filovirus replication cycle showing host and viral proteins that either promote
  (green boxes) or block (red boxes) virion assembly and release. Following viral
  attachment and entry into the host cell (1), the nucleocapsid, containing genomic
  RNA, is released into the host cell cytoplasm (2) and transcription of filovirus
  genes (3) and genome replication occurs. Replication is catalysed by the polymerase
  and viral cofactors NP, VP30 and VP35 (4). In the magnified diagram (5), nucleocapsids
  are transported to the plasma membrane by hijacking endosomal sorting complexes
  required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and the multivesicular body (MVB) trafficking
  pathway. Simultaneously, the major matrix protein, VP40, oligomerises as it moves
  towards the plasma membrane, while the full length glycoprotein is sent to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA) for processing and is subsequently transported
  in vesicles to the plasma membrane in its trimeric form. Nascent virions assemble
  at lipid rafts and bud from the host cell. In the case of Marburg virus, budding
  occurs from actin filopodia. Host factors that promote viral egress (green boxes)
  include actin and myosin, calcium ion channels, neural precursor cell expressed
  developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (Nedd4), Itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase
  (ITCH), WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1), suppressor of
  cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101), ALG-2-interacting
  protein X (Alix), and vacuolar protein sorting 4 (Vps4). Host factors that interfere
  with viral egress (red boxes) include tetherin, interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15)
  and BCL2 associated athanogene 3 (Bag3).
