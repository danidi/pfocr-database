caption: Upon the invasion of mycobacteria, cellular TLRs trigger a MyD88-depentent
  TLR signaling cascade to initiate an inflammatory response. During the course of
  infection, the activated TLR signaling components and their down-stream target genes,
  particularly MyD88, are capable of inducing miR-124 expression, which in turn inhibits
  TLR signaling by directly targeting multiple components of the TLR pathway. The
  net result of miR-124 expression is an attenuation of the mycobacteria-triggered
  inflammatory response. The dashed lines indicate undefined functions.
