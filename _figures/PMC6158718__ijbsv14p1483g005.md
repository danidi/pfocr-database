caption: In chronic energy excessive conditions, the causes of insulin resistance.
  In chronic energy excessive conditions, lipid accumulation is saturated and results
  in an increase in lipolysis in adipose tissue, causing excess FFAs. Lipid ectopic
  accumulation in skeletal muscle causes reduce of glucose transport and glycogen
  synthesis; excess circulating FFAs also destroy β cell function and insulin secretion;
  and in liver, insulin action is normal, but inhibition of extra-hepatic insulin
  signalling and lipid ectopic accumulation causes increase of HGP and excess insulin
  causes increasing DNL; and in brain, excess FFAs causes glucose and lipid metabolism
  disorder. All those ultimately impair PI3K/AKT signal, causing insulin resistance,
  and insulin resistance further exacerbates PI3K/AKT signalling, forming a vicious
  circle. Black arrow indicates activation or augment. Red arrow indicates reduction.
