caption: Proposed faecal immunochemical testing-based triage pathway for colorectal
  cancer 2-week wait referralsSchematic demonstrating the patient pathway to colorectal
  cancer investigation through primary and secondary care using faecal immunochemical
  testing (FIT) and NICE NG12 criteria to facilitate triage. *May include CT of the
  abdomen and pelvis or CT colonography/colon capsule endoscopy where the likelihood
  of conversion to colonoscopy is considered to be low. 2WW, 2-week wait.
