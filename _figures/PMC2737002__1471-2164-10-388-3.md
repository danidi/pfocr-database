caption: KEGG pathway diagram including the 11 oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS)
  genes selected by microarray analysis. In the upper part are shown the five respiratory
  chain complexes with the corresponding E.C. numbers. In the bottom part, as rectangles,
  are indicated the subunits of each respiratory chain complex. The subunits encoded
  by genes selected by microarray analysis are shown by colored (pink shaded) rectangles.
