number: Figure 1
caption: 'The pathway of glycine and two pathways of serine synthesis. A. Glycine
  and serine synthesis as part of the photorespiration. B. A non-photorespiratory
  pathway of serine synthesis. Reactions denoted as numbers are catalyzed by following
  enzymes:(1) ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, (2) phosphoglycolate
  phosphatase, (3) glyoxylate synthase, (4) alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase /
  serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase, (5) glycine decarboxylase + serine hydroxymethyl-transferase,
  (6) hydroxypyruvate reductase, (7) glycerate kinase, (8) 3-phoshoglycerate dehydrogenase,
  (9) phosphoserine transaminase, (10) phosphoserine phosphatase. Abbreviations used:
  3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; RuBP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.'
