caption: 'IL-6 cell signalling can occur three ways: (A) Classic pathway (or cis pathway)
  involves membrane bound IL-6R and gp-130 whereas; (B) Trans pathway involves IL-6
  binding with soluble (sIL-6R) along with gp-130. Both classic and trans pathway
  mediate JAK/STAT signalling to mediate CRS (C) Trans presentation occurs via dendritic
  cells (DC) which trans-present IL-6 via their own IL-6R to cognately interact with
  T cells (termed IL-6 ‘cluster signalling’), resulting in their differentiation to
  Th17 cells via JAK-STAT signalling. The JAK/STAT signalling (by both cis and trans
  signalling) and RAS-RAF, SRC-YAP-NOTCH and AKT-P13K promote the transcription of
  multiple downstream genes associated with T-cell clonal amplification, B-cell differentiation,
  acute phase response production.'
