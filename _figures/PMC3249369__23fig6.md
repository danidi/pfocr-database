caption: Mechanisms of signal integration among regulatory proteins and pathways that
  control filamentous growth. (A) Multiple signaling pathways converge on the FLO11
  promoter to modulate gene expression (). Both Snf1 and Rim101 are thought to function
  through the transcriptional repressors Nrg1 and Nrg2 (; ). (B) Multiple signaling
  pathways regulate the activity of the filamentation MAPK pathway, adapted from ().
  Rtg refers to the retrograde mitochondrial signaling pathway (). Other pathways
  also converge on FLO11 that are not shown here ().
