caption: 'The hexosamine pathway. In panel A, the steps of the hexosamine pathway
  (HP) from frutose-6P to UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine. Notice that glutamine (Gln), Acetyl-CoA
  and UTP are key substrates in this pathway. The rate-limiting step is catalyzed
  by glutamine:fructose-6P aminotransferase (GFAT). In panel B, a schematic representation
  of the structural changes during N-acetyl-glucosamine synthesis. The first reaction
  is the amination of fructose-6P (fructofuranose) to glucosamine-6P (glucopyranose).
  It is worth noting that, in step six, carbon 1 of glucopyranose binds to the hydroxyl
  of serine or threonine of the protein target. In fact, this is a reaction of O-linked
  β-N-acetylglucosaminylation, but for simplification, the nomenclature widely used
  is O-GlcNAcylation. However, this gives the wrong idea that linking occurs at the
  acyl group. It would be better to use NAGylation, since NAG is another (and the
  simplest) abbreviation of N-AcetylGlucosamine, found in some polymers. Herein, we
  will maintain the use of the term “O-GlcNAcylation.” Abbreviations: OGT, O-GlcNAc
  transferase; OGA, O-GlcNAcase; Pr, protein.'
