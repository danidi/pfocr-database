caption: In our model we propose that in PASMCs DXM activates the canonical T2R signaling
  cascade to cause significant increase in IP3 production resulting in increase in
  global [Ca2+]i levels. The increased [Ca2+]i subsequently leads to activation of
  myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) thus resulting in an increase in the phosphorylated
  form of MLC (pMLC). Increase in pMLC ultimately leads to the constrictor effects
  observed in the pulmonary arterial rings. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying
  T2R mediated relaxation of the airways was studied by different groups. Deshpande
  DA, et al,  showed that T2R activation results in localized [Ca2+]i mobilization
  which opens up large-conductance Ca2+ activated K+ (BKca) channels leading to ASM
  membrane hyperpolarization and relaxation. Recently, Zhang C, et al,  demonstrated
  that activation of T2Rs in airways (resting state) leads to increase in global [Ca2+]i
  levels, however, these are not sufficient to impact airway contractility. In a second
  pathway, they proposed bitter tastants inhibit L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
  (VDCCs) via a G-protein βγ dependent process, to induce bronchodilation of pre-contracted
  ASM.
