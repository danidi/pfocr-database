caption: Schematic representation of the IMD pathway and its regulation by Die and
  WntD. Die, acting through an unknown receptor, suppresses activation of the IMD
  pathway in response to endogenous signals or following SINV infection. WntD, acting
  through the receptor Fz4, suppresses activation of the IMD pathway by the intracellular
  bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, which is detected by the cytosolic receptor PGRP-LE.
  Both cytokines down-regulate expression of IMD target genes, including edin.
