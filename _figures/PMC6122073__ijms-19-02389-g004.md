caption: SSB signaling. Left panel demonstrates replication-independent SSB signaling.
  Following initiation of SSB end resection, APE2 is recruited and activated by PCNA
  interaction and ssDNA association. SSB end is resected by APE2 in the 3′–5′ direction
  to generate ssDNA for RPA recruitment and assembly of ATR DDR protein complex including
  ATR, ATRIP, TopBP1, and the 9-1-1 complex. Activated ATR phosphorylates Chk1 and
  RPA32. Right panel shows replication-dependent SSB signaling. When replication fork
  (rightward or leftward) meets SSB site, one-end DSB and new SSB are generated. The
  replication-derived SSB may proceed with 3′–5′ SSB end resection and subsequent
  ATR DDR pathway. The one-end DSB triggers MRN complex recruitment and ATM DDR activation
  including γ–H2AX and Chk2 phosphorylation.
