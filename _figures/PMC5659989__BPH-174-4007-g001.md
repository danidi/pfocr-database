caption: Overview of the role of adiponectin in the crosstalk between AT and the cardiovascular
  system for the regulation of cardiovascular redox state. Adiponectin, originating
  from adjacent perivascular fat or from ‘remote’ AT depots via the systemic circulation,
  has direct antioxidant and anti‐atherogenic effects on the human vascular wall (A).
  In particular, it is able to reduce the enzymatic activity of NOX1 and NOX2 isoforms
  of NADPH‐oxidases via phospho‐Akt mediated inhibition of Rac1 and p47phox translocation
  to the cell membrane, resulting in a reduced generation of superoxide (O2.−) and
  increased bioavailability of BH4 (A). Adiponectin also phosphorylates eNOS at its
  activation site Ser1177 via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway; these effects result
  in reduced oxidative stress, improved eNOS coupling and increased NO bioavailability
  (A). Moreover, end‐oxidation products such as 4‐HNE that are generated in the vascular
  wall because of oxidative stress are able to diffuse towards the adjacent PVAT,
  where they up‐regulate the expression of PPARγ, a potent upstream inducer of ADIPOQ
  expression (A). Similarly, adiponectin exerts antioxidant effects on the human myocardium
  via phospho‐AMPK mediated inhibition of Rac1 and p47phox membrane translocation
  and consequent reduction of NADPH‐oxidase enzymatic activity, while the generation
  of oxidation products such as 4‐HNE is able to up‐regulate ADIPOQ expression in
  EpAT via PPARγ signalling (B). In parallel, adiponectin expression is under the
  opposing regulation of the stimulatory BNP as well as the inhibitory local and systemic
  inflammatory stimuli (B). These loops constitute novel bi‐directional circuits that
  allow PVAT and EpAT to act as recipients of vascular or myocardial redox‐driven
  signals and subsequently respond appropriately as local defence mechanisms against
  oxidative stress. The responsiveness of such loops might, however, be dependent
  on anatomical parameters as well as systemic factors such as insulin resistance.
