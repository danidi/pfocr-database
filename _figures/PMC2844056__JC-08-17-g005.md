caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of genes up regulated in ER+ cell in response
  to AA shows that the ERK/MEK pathway was significantly associated with ER+. Cells
  were treated with AA at 6 and 24 hrs. RNA was isolated and hybridized on the cDNA
  microarray slides as detailed in materials and methods. Images were analyzed using
  GenePix 6.0 and data were analyzed using GeneSpring 10.1
