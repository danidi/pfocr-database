caption: Cartoon comparing canonical Hippo signaling with signaling by Legionella
  LegK7. In the canonical Hippo pathway, MST1 phosphorylates the NTE (T12 and T35)
  of MOB1A to promote formation of the MOB1A–LATS1 kinase complex. The activated MOB1A–LATS1
  kinase complex phosphorylates the transcriptional regulators YAP1/TAZ, which results
  in degradation or cytoplasmic retention of YAP1/TAZ and, consequently, expression
  of genes involved in cell proliferation or differentiation. During infection, L.
  pneumophila translocates the effector kinase LegK7 into host cells where it directly
  phosphorylates T12 and T35 on the NTE of MOB1A. Similar to LATS1, LegK7 interacts
  with phosphorylated MOB1A and becomes highly active. LegK7 exploits the NTE of MOB1A
  to recruit downstream substrates, possibly YAP1, for further phosphorylation and
  manipulates the conserved Hippo pathway to promote infection.
