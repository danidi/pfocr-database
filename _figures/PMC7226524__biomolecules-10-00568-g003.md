caption: Possible connection between the Warburg and Hoffman effects. Glycolysis is
  connected to the methionine cycle through the folate cycle, whereby serine derived
  from 3-phosphoglycerate provides one-carbon units. This pathway is important in
  cancer cells because the folate cycle feeds both nucleotide and SAM biosynthesis.
  SAM levels are especially impacted by the folate cycle because it is important for
  re-methylation of homocysteine to methionine, as well as ATP synthesis. Both methionine
  and ATP are substrates for formation of SAM.
