caption: Pathway for DIP biosynthesis using l-[1-13C]myo-inositol-1-phosphate as a
  labeled precursor. The asterisks highlight the positions of labeled carbon atoms
  in the several intermediate metabolites and end products as established in this
  work from 13C- and 31P-NMR analyses of reaction mixtures containing the bifunctional
  enzyme IPCT/DIPPS (see the text for details). Dashes are used to designate the carbon
  atoms in the phosphorylated inositol moiety.
