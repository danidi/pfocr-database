caption: Ciliary-vesicle-dependent steps of ciliogenesis, and modular organization
  and mechanism of the IFT machinery. (a) A pathway for ciliogenesis involves a ciliary
  vesicle and the small GTPases Rab8 and Rab11. The mother centriole uses distal appendages
  (which mature into transition fibres) to interact with a Rab11-associated ciliary
  vesicle (1). Rabin8 and coat protein small GTPase tethering complexes (including
  TRAPPII) are recruited to the ciliary vesicle (2). Rab8 is then recruited and seems
  to mark a Rab11-to-Rab8 switch, although this event is not clearly defined spatiotemporally
  (3). A transition zone (TZ) emerges (4), from which axoneme extension occurs (5),
  either before or following fusion of the invaginated ciliary vesicle with the plasma
  membrane (6). Both the transition fibres on the basal body and mature TZ help to
  seal the ciliary compartment, which is identifiable by the presence of Rab8. (b)
  Model for IFT-mediated transport. A complete anterograde IFT particle (including
  kinesin motor(s), IFT sub-complexes A and B, and the BBSome) assembles near or at
  the basal body transition fibres in association with the periciliary membrane, from
  components trafficked to the base of the cilium and centriolar satellites (1,2).
  Ciliary cargo is loaded onto IFT particles (3) and transported to the tip of the
  cilium (4) using one or more anterograde motors. Heterotrimeric kinesin-2 (Kin-II)
  is normally required for this motility, although additional kinesins may be used,
  including Kif17 (OSM-3). Remodelling at the tip (5) prepares the IFT machinery for
  retrograde transport (6), and at the base completes the IFT cycle (7). How the dynein
  and kinesin machineries move to the tip and back, respectively, remains unclear
  (shown as question marks). Cilia possess a proximal axoneme composed of doublet
  microtubules (MTs), and often have a distal axoneme with singlet MTs. In many C.
  elegans cilia, Kin-II and OSM-3 operate coordinately along doublet MTs, whereas
  OSM-3 acts alone in the distal segment. On the right, the composition and organization
  of the IFT machinery are depicted together with their various structural and functional
  domains (including β-propeller and TPR/solenoid motifs, small GTPases, coiled-coils
  and pleckstrin homology (PH) phosphatidylinositol lipid-binding module).
