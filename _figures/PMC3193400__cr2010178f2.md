caption: 'Activation of NF-κB and regulation of downstream transcriptional antioxidant
  and pro-oxidant targets. NF-κB is activated primarily by two pathways: the canonical
  pathway (shown on left) and the noncanonical pathway (shown on right). Downstream
  binding of the NF-κB proteins to DNA regulates downstream transcriptional targets.
  Shown are many potential antioxidant and pro-oxidant targets that have been proposed
  in the literature.'
