caption: In the assembled B cell receptor (BCR), CD79A–CD79B is weakly bound by Src
  family kinases (SFKs). Antigen binding promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of CD79A
  and CD79B on their immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs),. Phosphorylated
  ITAMs recruit spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and upregulate its kinase activity,.
  CD19 functions as a BCR co-receptor, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation within
  YXXM motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of CD19 that recruit the p85 regulatory subunit
  of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),, (left). PI3K activation mediated through this
  pathway or by the adaptor protein B cell adaptor for PI3K (BCAP) mediates phosphorylation
  of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2), generating phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PtdInsP3), which recruits AKT, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1),
  Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and other enzymes that are essential for signal propagation.
  In a distinct pathway (right), B cell linker protein (BLNK) functions as a scaffold
  and substrate for SYK- and SFK-mediated phosphorylation, promoting the recruitment
  of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), BTK, VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor proteins
  and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2). Activated PLCγ2 hydrolyses PtdInsP2
  to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), which promotes
  Ca2+ mobilization through the InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) and opening of the plasma
  membrane Ca2+ channel ORAI. DAG recruits protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and RAS
  guanyl-releasing proteins (RASGRPs). During positive selection of immature B cells,
  AKT activity suppresses forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) nuclear localization, which
  turns off recombination-activating gene (RAG) expression, and increases production
  of the transcription factor MYC, which (together with AKT) promotes cell survival.
  Another BCR-triggered pathway involves the guanine nucleotide exchange factor son
  of sevenless 1 (SOS1), the small GTPase RAS, the serine kinase RAF1, MAPK/ERK kinase
  (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Ca2+ mobilization through
  InsP3R and ORAI promotes the activation of calcineurin and the nuclear localization
  of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). PKC activation promotes activation
  of nuclear factor−κB (NF−κB). PI3K and its downstream activities seem to be promoted
  in immature B cells by the unligated BCR, whereas BCR ligation activates the BLNK
  pathway transiently. This leads to BCR internalization and reduced signalling through
  both pathways, and drives RAG expression, developmental arrest and cell starvation.
