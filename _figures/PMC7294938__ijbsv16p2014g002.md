caption: Components and roles of mechanical microenvironment in regulating cytoskeleton.
  Potential roles of biomechanical and biochemical factors in tumor microenvironment
  (TME). The TME embeds tumor cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs), and their derivatives. The mechanical environment is mainly
  composed of extracellular matrix and its components such as proteoglycans (PGs),
  glycoproteins (GAGs) and collagenous fibers. The increased ECM deposition elevates
  its stiffness and rigidity. With the increasing rigidity of the ECM, mechanical
  force applied on tumor cells also increases. Mechanical force activates tumor cell
  progression directly by exerting pressure on the cell membrane or indirectly by
  putting force on integrins. The Rho/ROCK pathway is subsequently activated and contributes
  to the reorganization of F-actin. In addition, TGF-β and other growth factors are
  stored within the ECM and released in a tension-dependent manner. TGF-β combines
  with its ligands TβR-I/TβR-II. TGF-β regulates the actin cytoskeleton by promoting
  EMT, which is characterized by dramatic changes in cytoskeletal structure through
  the SMAD pathway. TGFβ-SMAD signaling activates the expression of EMT transcription
  factors, and SMAD complexes cooperate with these transcription factors to increase
  their transcriptional activities. In another way, TGF-β and hypoxia activate the
  CAFs which release α-SMA. α-SMA is transduced to the intracellular plasma and accelerates
  the formation and organization of the cytoskeleton. These biomechanical and biochemical
  parameters act together and lead to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the
  formation of lamellipodia, which act as the motile force and stimulate tumor cell
  invasion and metastasis.
