caption: A, EPI-002 inhibits transcriptional activity of FL-AR and AR-Vs which results
  in reduced expression of target genes such as PSA and UBE2C respectively. EPI reduces
  mTOR-regulated pS6. B, mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus (EVE) and low dose of
  BEZ blocks mTOR with concomitant increases in levels of FL-AR and AR-V. Increased
  levels of FL-AR lead to increased levels of expression of its target gene, PSA.
  Levels of AR-V7 target genes such as UBE2C are inhibited possibly by decreased transactivation
  of AR NTD or other unidentified mechanisms. C, Increased transcriptional activity
  of FL-AR due to increased levels in response to mTOR inhibition is blocked by AR-NTD
  antagonist. Combination of AR-NTD antagonist (EPI) and mTOR inhibitor blocks mTOR-regulated
  pS6 and transcriptional activity of AR-V7 to reduce levels of its target gene, UBE2C.
  Lines represent effects on activity. Thick arrows represent changes in levels of
  expression.
