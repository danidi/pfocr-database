caption: Chk2 is activated either by ATM (in response to DNA damage) or by ATR (in
  response to replication stress). The activation is initiated by Thr68 phosphorylation
  which leads to dimerization of Chk2. The dimerization facilitates further intermolecular
  trans-phosphorylations at Thr383, Thr387 and Ser516. The dimer then dissociates
  into monomers. Both multi-phosphorylated dimers and monomers of Chk2 are enzymatically
  active and able to phosphorylate several substrates. Phosphorylation of the Cdc25C
  and Cdc25A phosphatases by Chk2 opens a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins, sequestrates
  them within the complex with 14-3-3 and thereby prevents their translocation into
  the nucleus and dephosphorylation of inhibitory phosphorylations at Thr14 and Tyr15
  on cyclin/CDK complexes, which stalls cell cycle progression at the G2 to M and
  G1 to S transitions, respectively (). Phosphorylation of Cdc25 phosphatases also
  accelerates their proteasomal degradation (). Cell arrest in G1 can also be mediated
  by Chk2 through phosphorylation of p53 which may lead to upregulation of the cdk2
  inhibitor p21WAF1. Phosphorylation of p53 may also result in upregulation of Bax,
  which promotes apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis is additionally promoted by phosphorylation
  of PML and E2F-1, while phosphorylation of BRCA1 (mediated by both ATM and Chk2)
  engages the DNA repair pathway.
