caption: The host phosphorylation system is targeted during different stages of L.
  pneumophila encounter with host cells. (A) The initial contact and subsequent uptake
  into the host cell is thought to be dependent on PI3Ks and respective downstream
  signaling in macrophages (Tachado et al., ; Charpentier et al., ). (B) Alterations
  in PI levels at the vacuole contribute to differential protein recruitment and could
  interfere with endocytic trafficking to vacuole (Weber et al., , ; Ragaz et al.,
  ; Brombacher et al., ). (C) After contact with cells of higher eukaryotes, the NF-κB
  pathway is activated, which alters cytokine production, host cell survival, and
  intracellular replication of L. pneumophila (Losick and Isberg, ; Abu-Zant et al.,
  ; Shin et al., ; Bartfeld et al., ; Fontana et al., ). (D) The MAPK signaling pathway
  is also modulated during infection and proper regulation is necessary for L. pneumophila
  replication in amebae and cytokine production in macrophages (Welsh et al., ; Losick
  and Isberg, ; Shin et al., ; Li et al., ).
