caption: 'Tumor suppressor p53 signaling pathway. p53 protein is accumulated and activated
  in cells in response to various stress signals. Once activated, p53 transcriptionally
  regulates the expression of select target genes to regulate different cellular processes,
  including cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, metabolism and ferroptosis.
  MDM2 and MDM4 play a critical role in negative regulation of p53 in cells. p53 RE:
  p53-responsive element.'
