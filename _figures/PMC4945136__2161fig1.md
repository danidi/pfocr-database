caption: 'Aminoglycerophospholipids and CL biosynthetic pathways in yeast. PE biosynthesis
  in yeast is accomplished by three major pathways: 1) Psd1-catalyzed decarboxylation
  of PS in the mitochondria, 2) Psd2-catalyzed decarboxylation of PS in endosomal
  compartments, and 3) incorporation of Etn via the cytosolic/ER Kennedy pathway.
  PC is produced by two major pathways: 1) formation of Pem1 and Pem2 PC by successive
  methylation of PE, and 2) incorporation of choline via the Kennedy pathway. CL biosynthesis
  occurs exclusively in the mitochondria, where premature cardiolipin (CLp) is synthesized
  from phosphatidylglycerol (PG) by Crd1. The resulting CLp is deacylated by the phospholipase
  Cld1 to produce monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) and reacylated by Taz1 to form mature
  cardiolipin (CLm). CDP, cytidine diphosphate; CTP, cytidine triphosphate; CMP, cytidine
  monophosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; PI, phosphatidylinositol;
  PDME, phosphatidyl­dimethylethanolamine; PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate.'
