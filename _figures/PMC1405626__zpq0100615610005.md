caption: Central versus peripheral muscarinic cholinergic regulation of the systemic
  inflammatory response (proposed mechanism). In rodents, the endotoxin-induced systemic
  TNF release is inhibited by cholinergic signaling derived from efferent vagus-nerve
  fibers (, ). This cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway (CAP) is mediated through
  α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAchR) on macrophages (). Central muscarinic
  cholinergic activation by stimulation of M1 acetylcholine muscarinic receptors (MAchR,
  postsynaptic) or inhibition of M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) M2AchR, presynaptic)
  inhibits systemic TNF release in endotoxemic rats and activates efferent vagus-nerve
  activity. Activation of the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway by electrical vagus
  nerve stimulation reduces systemic TNF levels during endotoxemia through peripheral
  muscarinic receptor (MAchR)-independent and α7nAchR-dependent mechanisms (see text
  for details).
