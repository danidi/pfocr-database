caption: Proposed model summarizing the effect of streptolysin S on keratinocyte signaling
  during Streptococcus pyogenes infection. During infection, SLS induces osmotic stress,
  which leads to loss of phospho-Akt and subsequent activation of the p38 MAPK pathway.
  Activation of p38 leads to NF-κB nuclear localization, which drives the production
  of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that this inflammatory cytokine production
  leads to an autocrine signaling loop through cytokine and/or death receptor proteins,
  ultimately culminating in the induction of programmed cell death in infected keratinocytes.
  Nec-1, necrostatin-1.
