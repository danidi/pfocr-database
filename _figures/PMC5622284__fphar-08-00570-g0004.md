caption: Upregulated genes involved in apoptosis signaling at 1 day after a single
  dose of 2 Gy Fe ions. Arborescence diagram indicates apoptosis pathway with the
  identified upregulated genes indicated in green. Pathway diagram was adapted from
  Wikipathways and modified with Pathvisio. Changes are shown compared to gene expression
  in sham irradiated cells (N = 3, n = 12).
