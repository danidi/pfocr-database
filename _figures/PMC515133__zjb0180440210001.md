caption: Regulation of arginine biosynthesis in L. plantarum. (A) Simplified arginine
  biosynthesis in L. plantarum FB331. CP is a common precursor between arginine synthesis
  and the de novo pyrimidine pathway. Wild-type L. plantarum harbors CPS. Strain FB331
  has CPS-P, the pyrimidine-regulated CPS, deleted so CP synthesis is entirely dependent
  on the arginine-regulated CPS (CPS-A) encoded by the arginine-repressed operon carA.
  The genes coding for enzymes that synthesize citrulline from glutamate, ATP, and
  CO2 are organized on the divergently transcribed carAB and argCJBDF operons (, ).
  The last two steps that synthesize arginine from citrulline are encoded by the argGH
  genes. The overlapping argG and argH genes suggest coupled translation and transcription.
  (B) Model for arginine-dependent repression of arginine biosynthetic operons. The
  arginine-dependent repression of the three tested operons requires both the argR1
  and argR2 gene products, which suggests that the active repressor may be a hexamer
  composed of ArgR1-ArgR2 molecules, but this hypothesis needs to be experimentally
  tested. The arrows beneath the genes represent the directions of transcription.
  (C) Mutation mapping of the Arg operators of the bipolar carA/argC genes. Transcription
  start sites (+1) are indicated with arrows and were determined experimentally for
  carA () and argC (data not shown). The proposed nucleotides of the −10 and −35 promoter
  boxes are underlined. The nucleotide sequence of the carA-argC intergenic region
  in mutant FB331-14 (Δ4732 to 4780) is detailed at the top. The additional 48 nucleotides
  found in the wild-type L. plantarum are listed in the rectangle (EMBL database accession
  no. X99978). The star indicates the T→C mutation found in strain FB331-13. The dotted
  boxes represent ARG boxes, with bases that are highly conserved among studied E.
  coli operators and in operators from other organisms in boldface (); mismatched
  bases found in the proposed L. plantarum ARG box are in lowercase.
