caption: Metabolic pathways leading to excess triglyceride deposition in the liver
  and the effect of increased glucocorticoids on the pathways. The steady-state hepatic
  triglyceride content is determined by rates of TG formation and TG metabolism or
  secretion from hepatocytes. Several pathways and sources directly and indirectly
  serve to increase hepatic triglyceride content. These include 1) Increased appetite
  and food consumption. Following digestion of food, the bulk of the absorbed glucose
  is taken up by the liver (by GLUT2 transporters) and the rest is avidly taken up
  by the skeletal and cardiac muscle and adipose tissue by GLUT4 transporters that
  are stimulated by elevated insulin levels. The rise in blood glucose leads to increased
  secretion and blood levels of insulin, a response that is exaggerated by GC treatment.
  Amino acids are taken up mostly by liver and skeletal muscle. Chylomicrons release
  fatty acids (FA) and glycerol due to action of plasma LPL, and the released FA are
  taken up by adipose tissue, skeletal muscle as well as by the liver. GC excess stimulates
  tissue hormone-sensitive lipase and increases fatty acid and glycerol release from
  adipose tissue. 2) The uptake of FA by the liver represents the major pathway of
  lipid deposition in liver and this transport process is stimulated by GC. 3) Upon
  entry into the liver, amino acids and glycerol as well as glucose metabolites can
  form glucose through gluconeogenesis, a pathway that is stimulated by GC and inhibited
  by insulin. Finally, the elevated blood glucose and insulin both stimulate de novo
  fatty acid synthesis (lipogenesis), and excess GC in conjunction with elevated insulin
  synergistically stimulates this process. Two pathways mediate the decrease of triglycerides
  in intracellular stores. These include 1) the production and release of triglycerides
  as VLDL particles into the bloodstream, a process that is mildly stimulated by glucocorticoids
  and 2) β-oxidation of fatty acids, a metabolic pathway that is inhibited by glucocorticoids.
  All the major steps of TG metabolism in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle
  are affected by increased GC action. In sum, the net effect of excess glucocorticoids
  is to increase hepatic triglyceride stores leading to fatty liver.
