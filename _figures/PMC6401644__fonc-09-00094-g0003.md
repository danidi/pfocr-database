caption: 'PIN1 acts at multiple levels of cooperating cellular pathways. NOTCH receptor
  and RAS-dependent pathways are indicated as examples of signal transduction pathways
  that are regulated by PIN1 at multiple levels. Furthermore, PIN1 enables active
  cross-talk between different pathways, e.g., by promoting nuclear translocation
  of PKM2 after EGFR-stimulated phosphorylation by ERKs, that in turn serves to enhance
  c-MYC transcriptional activity. (Left) The NOTCH pathway is activated by a ligand-dependent
  cleavage of the membrane-bound receptor that releases the Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD), which translocates into the nucleus where it promotes the transactivation
  of several target genes. This signal is turned off by the E3-ubiquitin ligase FBXW7
  as a safeguard mechanism against excessive NOTCH signaling. PIN1 is harnessed by
  the NOTCH pathway to sustain its own signaling, indeed PIN1 boosts the cleavage
  of the NOTCH1 receptor and prevents the interaction of NICD1 and NICD4 with FBXW7,
  increasing in this way pathway activation, protein stability and transcriptional
  activity. In some contexts, PIN1 can also directly block FBXW7 activity. Moreover,
  some NOTCH transcriptional targets, such as CYCLIN D1 and c-MYC, are also direct
  PIN1 targets, thus suggesting that PIN1 may amplify also the NOTCH transcriptional
  program. Notably NICD1 and NICD4 directly promote Pin1 transcription. Blue color
  indicates PIN1-activated proteins, red color indicates PIN1-inhibited proteins.
  Arrows and blocked lines show positive and negative effects, respectively. (Right)
  In response to growth stimuli, RAS activates the Raf kinase, which in turn activates
  downstream MAPKs that phosphorylate c-FOS and c-JUN causing the formation of the
  AP-1 transcription factor that transactivates the CYCLIN D1 gene. CYCLIN D1-CDK4/6
  complex, in turn, blocks pRb, unleashing the transcription factor E2F, boosting
  in this way cell cycle progression. PIN1 itself is a direct transcriptional target
  of E2F and strongly promotes the RAS/MAPKs/CYCLIN/CDK cascade at multiple levels:
  (i) by blocking negative feed-back regulation of RAF by MAPKs, (ii) by enhancing
  both transcription and protein stability of CYCLIN D1, and (iii) by blocking the
  activity of pRB.'
