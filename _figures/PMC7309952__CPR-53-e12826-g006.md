caption: The regulatory network of the BCL2 family in gynaecologic and breast cancer.
  A‐E, The regulatory network of the BCL2 family members with 30% alteration frequency.
  The networks from cBioportal analysis show alteration frequency, mRNA expression,
  copy number and mutation coding by various colours in different circular areas across
  gynaecologic cancers. F‐H, The co‐mutation/amplification signatures for TP53, PIK3CA
  and BCL2L1, for which gene mutation or amplification/upregulation was found more
  frequently. I, The BCL2 family‐mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in gynaecologic
  and breast cancer. In the death signal pathway, upstream signalling unleashes initiator
  proteins, including sensitizers (BIK, PMAIP1, etc) and activators (BID, etc). Subsequently,
  these proteins are bound and immediately sequestered by guardian proteins (including
  BCL2L1). Because the transcriptional expression of the BCL2L1 gene tends to have
  more amplification events and chromatin accessibility, BCL2L1 protein never reaches
  a state of saturation. Guardian proteins prevent effector proteins from oligomerizing
  and causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which prevents
  cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Without cytochrome c, APAF1 cannot dimerize
  with procaspase‐9 to form the apoptosome. Thus, guardian proteins mediate the immortalization
  of cells
