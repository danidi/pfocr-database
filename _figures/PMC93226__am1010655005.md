caption: Hypothetical scheme illustrating how oxic conditions cause a shift in the
  flow of reductant ([e−]) by RD-1. The acetate formed under oxic conditions is derived
  from the oxidation of glucose (upper portion of scheme) rather than reductive synthesis
  from CO2 via the acetyl-CoA pathway (depicted as the acetate that is produced as
  a reduced end product under anoxic conditions (lower left branch of figure).
