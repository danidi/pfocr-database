caption: Thioredoxin (TXN) is a main constituent in an antioxidant pathway that neutralizes
  Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2−), to prevent oxidative damage. TXN
  exists in active (reduced) and inactive (oxidized) states. Thioredoxin Reductase
  1 (TXNRD1) is responsible for reducing 2HC-TXN (TXN with attached double hydrocarbon)
  into its active form. Therefore, in the presence of more ROS, an increased expression
  of TXNRD1 occurs to protect the cells from oxidative damage.
