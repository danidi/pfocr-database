caption: Cpx pathway integrates environmental information at several levels. 1, CpxP
  integrates signals resulting from misfolded proteins; 2, the periplasmic domain
  of CpxA integrates CpxP-dependent (P-dep), NlpE-dependent (E-dep), and CpxP- and
  NlpE-independent (P-, E-ind) signals; 3, by receiving phosphoryl groups from several
  donors, CpxR integrates CpxA-dependent signals and CpxA-independent signals. The
  CpxA-independent signals include the undefined CpxR-dependent response to ethanol
  (EtOH) and signals that emanate through acetyl-P and a proposed noncognate SK (SKX).
  The activity of this SK depends on the status of the Pta-AckA pathway. Disruption
  of this pathway permits accumulation of a molecule, Y, which directly or indirectly
  inhibits the transfer of phosphoryl groups from SKX to CpxR. The mediator of the
  ethanol response, Z, in theory could be SKX.
