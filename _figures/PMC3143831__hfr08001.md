caption: AKT signalling in the heart. The short-term activation of AKT protects the
  cardiomyocyte against environmental stressors via the inhibition of cell death and
  the promotion of cell growth and cardiac angiogenesis. The short-term activation
  of JNK is cardioprotective as well. JNK phosphorylates AKT at threonine 450 and
  potentiates its interaction with its downstream effectors. It remains unclear as
  to why these favourable effects of AKT are lost with its prolonged activation. One
  hypothesis is that other signalling pathways dominate and override the interaction
  of AKT with its downstream effectors. This hypothesis clearly needs to be investigated
  in the future. IGF-R, insulin-like growth factor receptor; PI3K1, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase 1; mTORC2, mammalian target of rapamycin 2; 3 MA, 3-methyladenine; PKC,
