caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of the significantly altered miRNA found in the
  follicular fluid showing that 12 of these miRNA were related to the genes involved
  in the Organismal Injury and Abnormalities, Reproductive System Disease pathway.
  Strongly upregulated and downregulated miRNA are represented with dark red and green
  color and vice versa.
