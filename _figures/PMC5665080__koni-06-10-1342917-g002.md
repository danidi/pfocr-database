caption: The metabolic reprogramming associated with immune cell activation engages
  the mevalonate pathway. Immune cell stimulation activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
  and promotes uptake of glucose via glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins followed
  by glycolysis and oxidation of glucose-derived pyruvate in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) cycle, which drives oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Activated
  immune cells also export citrate to the cytosol, where it is converted back to acetyl-coenzyme
  A (acetyl-CoA) by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). Cytosolic acetyl-CoA serves as a metabolic
  precursor not only for fatty acid (FA) synthesis and protein acetylation but also
  for mevalonate metabolism (the lipogenic pathways). mTOR signaling also leads to
  the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), which are
  the main transcription factor for mevalonate pathway-associated genes in immune
  cells. In a feed-forward loop, enhanced mevalonate metabolism facilitates prenylation
  of Ras proteins and thus further enhances pathway activity. In an apparently futile
  cycle of concurrent synthesis and oxidation, de novo synthesized fatty acids (FA)
  are stored in the lysosome. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) catalyzes the release of
  these FA, which are shuttled into the mitochondria for ATP generation through ß-oxidation.
