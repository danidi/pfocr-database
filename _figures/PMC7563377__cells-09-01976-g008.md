caption: Model illustrates targeting of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling using PSMA aptamer
  conjugated PBM-NPs inhibits prostate cancer tumorigenesis. The Hh pathways induces
  chemoresistance through regulating the transcription of ABC transporter gene. Moreover,
  the Hh pathway include the activation of SHH which bind to the receptor PTCH1, followed
  by inhibition of the seven-transmembrane protein smoothened (SMO) and subsequently
  triggering GLI-dependent transcription. A GLI activity is regulated by loss of function
  mutation in suppressor of fused (SUFU), which binds to all three GLIs (GLI-1, GLI-2,
  and GLI-3) and controls the expression of downstream proteins. We demonstrated the
  mechanism by which thymoquinone (TQ) encapsulated A10 aptamer-conjugated PBM-NPs
  (A10-TQ-PBM-NPs) specifically bind to the PSMA receptor, expressed on cell surface.
  The aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles were efficiently internalized through the receptor
  via endocytosis and inhibited thee ABC drug efflux protein (MDR1). The PBM-NPs binds
  to SHH protein, thereby arresting cell proliferation and affecting other properties
  of PCa cells.
