caption: Model of ERK pathway signaling and outcomes in the M. tuberculosis-regulated
  macrophage. TLR2 signaling represents a major macrophage-intrinsic signaling pathway
  in response to M. tuberculosis infection, and downstream ERK activation shapes the
  macrophage response to outcomes that favor establishment of latent M. tuberculosis
  infection. TLR2-ERK signaling drives macrophages to enhance IL-10 production and
  diminish IL-12 production. ERK signaling also promotes arginase 1 expression and
  inhibits expression of MHC-II and iNOS. These phenomena collectively result in reduced
  presentation of M. tuberculosis antigen to T cells, reduced stimulation of T cells
  into a Th1 polarization state, and reduced innate macrophage microbicidal mechanisms,
  such as NO elaboration. If ERK signaling is selectively blocked, M. tuberculosis
  infection of macrophages results in less expression of IL-10 or arginase 1; higher
  levels of IL-12, iNOS, and MHC-II; and enhanced Th1 polarization.
