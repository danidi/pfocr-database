caption: 'TSLP and CRLF2 positive leukemias: a hypothetical model. In the pre-leukemic
  phase, B-cell progenitors over-expressing the TSLP receptor are expanded in response
  to TSLP. In the leukemic phase, acquired activating mutations in the pathway (e.g.
  in JAK2) make the cells hypersensitive to TSLP, causing their dramatic expansion.'
