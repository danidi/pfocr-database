caption: Proteins used in this study. (A) The alternative pathway produces, spontaneously,
  low levels of C3b from inert C3. Nascent C3b can attach to nearby surfaces via its
  TED. C3b also binds FB, forming C3bB. Factor D (FD) cleaves the FB portion of C3bB,
  yielding C3bBb. C3bBb converts C3 to C3b (+ C3a), establishing a positive-feedback
  loop for C3b production. On a self-surface, FH competes with FB for C3b binding
  and accelerates decay of C3bBb. C3b can be degraded to iC3b by FI with FH as cofactor
  and then via C3dg (+ C3c) to C3d, equating to the TED of C3b. (B) Ovals represent
  CCPs 1–20 in FH; locations of N-glycans are indicated by rectangles. Horizontal
  lines above the ovals designate CCPs involved in binding C3b (ovals with thicker
  outline), self-surface markers (pale shading), and C3d (pale shading plus thicker
  outline); dashed lines indicate constitutively occluded binding sites. (C) N-terminally
  His6-tagged SUMO fusions (s) with sequences from the N-terminal domain of D39 PspC
  (residue numbering includes signaling sequence) were created. The sPspCN37–140 or
  the product (PspCN) following cleavage of and removal of the fusion partner was
  used for most experiments.
