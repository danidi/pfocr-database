caption: Proposed regulation of the Cbr/Crc system in a P. donghuensis HYS-C. elegans
  slow-killing assay. Under normal conditions, CbrA functions through CbrB to promote
  the transcription of crcZ and crcY. The small RNAs CrcZ and CrcY bind to the Crc
  protein to inhibit its binding to virulence-related genes. Thus, the P. donghuensis
  HYS strain exhibits virulence characteristics. When encountering C. elegans, P.
  donghuensis HYS virulence may trigger a host response through the PMK-1/p38 MAPK
  innate immune pathway.
