caption: (a) Day 1- Genes in this network are responsible for cellular development,
  connective tissue disorder and metabolic disease. (b) Day 3- Genes in this network
  are responsible for cellular function and maintenance, molecular transport and inflammatory
  response. Red color indicates induction, while green represents repression; color
  intensity correlates with fold change.
