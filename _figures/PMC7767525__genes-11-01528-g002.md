caption: Major mechanisms of double-strand break repair. NHEJ, Non-Homologous End
  Joining. DNA ends are protected by KU70/KU80, which prevents their end-processing.
  When the ends are incompatible, a segment of up to four nucleotides is detected,
  Artemis eliminates the remaining incompatible segments and ligation is carried out
  by LIGIV-XRCC4. This pathway can repair a DSB without chromosome modification; however,
  during S/G2 and in the presence of several DSBs, it is considered prone to generate
  chromosomal alterations. HR, Homologous Recombination. This pathway is only available
  during the S/G2 phases of the cell cycle since it requires a homologous template;
  HR is the best choice to maintain sequence fidelity because in general it repairs
  in an error-free manner. A ssDNA 3′ overhang is produced by the action of the MRN-CtIP
  complex; it is first covered by RPA proteins which are later replaced by RAD51 to
  form the nucleoprotein strand that will carry out the invasion of the DNA of the
  sister chromatid in order to use it as a template to restore the continuity of the
  original nucleotide sequence. MMEJ, Microhomology-Mediated End Joining. PARP1 prevents
  KU70/KU80 binding to DNA ends and allows the recruitment of MRN-CtIP to initiate
  end-resection, creating a short 3′ overhang. This overhang is preferentially covered
  by HMCES which channels the damage to be repaired by MMEJ instead of HR. PARP1-POLQ
  search for microhomology of 2–20 bp and align the strands. The resulting flaps are
  eliminated by XPF/FANCQ-FEN1. Alternatively, POLQ can direct DNA synthesis to add
  nucleotides to make DNA ends compatible; this end processing generates in situ deletions
  and duplications. In addition, if this pathway is active during S/G2, and several
  DSBs coincide in time and space, gross chromosomal aberrations are formed because,
  similar to NHEJ, they do not require long stretches of homology to ligate the DNA
  ends [,]. * RPA or HMCES (5-hydroxymethylcytosine binding, embryonic stem cell-specific
