caption: Highly simplified schematic showing relevant anatomical connectivity of the
  laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) within known addiction-related pathways in the rat
  brain. The LDT contains separate populations of cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic
  neurons. A subset of these cells sends projections to the ventral tegmental area
  (VTA) synapsing on GABAergic and dopamine-containing cells in this nucleus which
  project to the nucleus accumbens (nAC). The prefrontal cortex (PFC) exerts control
  over the VTA via direct projections to this nucleus and via an indirect pathway
  synapsing within the LDT.
