caption: Notch signaling modulates endothelial cells’ (EC) fate associated with neointimal
  hyperplasia. (A) EC proliferation reduces neointimal hyperplasia. Notch signaling
  may have dual function in EC proliferation, which is dependent on the relative level
  of p21 expression. If the expression of p21 is above the level, Notch activation
  inhibits EC proliferation, however, ECs grow and proliferate when the expression
  of p21 is below the level. In addition, activation of Notch blocks EC regeneration
  and induces neointimal hyperplasia; (B) EC apoptosis contributes to neointimal hyperplasia.
  Upregulation of Notch-1, Notch-2, Notch-3 and downregulation of Notch-4, promote
  EC apoptosis, which further promotes neointimal hyperplasia; (C) Endothelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EndMT) contributes to neointimal hyperplasia. Notch activation can trigger
  EndMT and promote neointimal hyperplasia. The canonical EndMT inducer TGF-β (transforming
  growth factor-β) also can activate the Notch signaling pathway. FSP-1, fibroblast-specific
  protein 1; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1).
