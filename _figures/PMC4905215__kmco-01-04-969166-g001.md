caption: Endothelial-specific loss of GRK2 impairs maturation and vascular remodeling
  in adult and developmental angiogenesis. (A) Functional angiogenesis encompasses
  several sequential and interdependent steps that require proper control of GRK2
  expression. The initial activation phase involves perivascular cell detachment from
  pre-existing vessels, and the specification of activated endothelial cells into
  tip and stalk populations as a result of the integration of VEGF, ALK1, and PDGF
  signals with the Notch pathway. During the resolution phase, ECs cease to migrate
  and proliferate and, instead, initiate tubulogenesis and membrane basement formation.
  Downmodulation of GRK2 deregulates the downstream signaling to such co-operating
  factors of endothelial specification, which might alter tip/stalk specification
  and/or the maintenance of activated ECs. Vessel maturation and remodeling also occur
  in the resolution phase, as mural cells are recruited for endothelial tube investment.
  Increased secretion of the mural cell attractant PDGF by GRK2-deficient endothelial
  cells could disturb the local gradients needed to drive adequate intercellular apposition
  of pericytes with ECs. (B) GRK2 regulates the TGFβ-dependent state of the endothelium
  via simultaneous modulation of the ALK5 and ALK1 pathways. GRK2 downmodulation not
  only decreases direct inhibition of Smad2/3 (in a kinase activity-dependent manner)
  but could also alleviate ALK1 signaling-mediated lateral inhibition of the ALK5
  pathway. Stronger activation of ALK5 with concurrent attenuated ALK1 signaling might
  alter the balance between the activation and resolution phases of angiogenesis,
  thereby impairing sprouting and maturation. ALK, activin receptor-like kinase; EC,
  endothelial cell; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; TGFβ1, transforming growth
  factor beta 1; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
