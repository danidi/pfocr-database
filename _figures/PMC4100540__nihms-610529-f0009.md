caption: Role of PTEN in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and cell proliferation following
  growth factor binding to its receptor. Growth factors such as epidermal growth factor
  (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) bind to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).
  Ligand-induced receptor dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of distinct
  tyrosine residues creates docking sites for various membrane targets via distinct
  adaptor molecules. Depicted here is the lipid kinase PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase),
  consisting of regulatory subunit p85 and catalytic subunit p110, that phosphorylates
  PIP2 to generate the second messenger PIP3. Increase in cellular PIP3 levels results
  in the recruitment and activation of protein kinase AKT, thus initiating diverse
  cellular pathways leading to increase in proliferation, migration, gene transcription,
  cell cycle progression, and cell survival and changes in cell metabolism. For brevity,
  only the mTOR/S6K components of the pathway are shown here. Active small GTPase
  K-Ras also acts on PI3K and activates the mTOR pathway. Hyperactivation of the mTOR
  pathway causes aberrant cell proliferation and cancer. Therefore, PTEN, a lipid
  phosphatase, continuously removes a 3′-position phosphate group (P) in the inositol
  ring and converts PIP3 to PIP2. Decrease in PIP3 levels keeps the signaling via
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in check. Later, PIP2 is hydrolyzed by phospholipase Cb
  (PLCb) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3); both molecules are
  involved in distinct calcium-dependent signaling events. Thus, since PTEN plays
  a central role in cell physiology and growth by regulating a myriad of downstream
  signaling events, understanding PTEN structure and its correlation to function is
  critical to modulating PTEN activity via targeted molecular therapies.
