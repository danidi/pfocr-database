caption: Model for cooperativity between PfCDPK5 and PfPKG. The progress along the
  parasite egress pathway is promoted by activation of PfPKG. At low levels of PfPKG
  activation, the protease cascade and calcium signaling pathway are initiated. PfCDPK5
  activation, together with PfPKG, leads to further progression of the protease cascade
  and triggered release of micronemes required for parasite egress (detected by PfAMA1
  translocation, shown in red). Under physiological conditions, this step requires
  both PfCDPK5 and PfPKG. The discharge of micronemes completes the egress process
  with the release of invasive merozoites. The requirement for PfCDPK5 can be bypassed
  by supraphysiological activation of PfPKG by either BIPPO or physical disruption.
  PVM, parasitophorous vacuolar membrane.
