caption: (A) In the initial stages of the primary response, stimulation of CD8+ T
  cells by antigen and interleukin-2 (IL-2) leads to transcription and translation
  of the components of the Hippo pathway as well as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  protein 4 (CTLA-4), and its ligand, CD80. However, contact between antigen-specific
  cells is unlikely, and intra-nuclear Yes-associated protein (Yap) is maintained
  because the Hippo pathway is not activated. This circumstance enables Yap-dependent
  transcription to suppress a commitment to terminal differentiation, which may be
  mediated by the ‘memory’ associated transcription factor, Eomesodermin (EOMES).
  (B) As clonal expansion increases the frequency of activated antigen-specific T
  cells, contact between these cells is more likely to occur, leading to surface expression
  of CTLA-4 and its ligation by CD80, thereby triggering the Hippo signaling cascade.
  Ultimately, this activates the serine/threonine kinase, Large Tumor Suppressor Homolog
  (LATS), which phosphorylates Yap at 5 serine residues, one of which, pS112, leads
  to Yap being trapped in the cytosol, and another, pS382, causes its ubiquitinylation
  and proteasomal degradation. This loss of Yap is associated with the expression
  of PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domain (PRDM1) and terminal differentiation.
