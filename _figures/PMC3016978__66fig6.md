caption: Model for a meiotic gene regulatory cascade initiated by inactivation of
  a pathway that promotes turnover of meiotic transcripts produced in vegetatively
  growing cells. During proliferation (top), Mei2p is maintained in the inactive phosphorylated
  state by the Pat1p kinase (Iino and Yamamoto, ), and Mmi1p is available to target
  certain transcripts for destruction by the nuclear exosome, which contains Rrp6p.
  Upon entry into meiosis (below dotted line), Mmi1p is sequestered in a nuclear dot
  via association with Mei2p and the noncoding meiRNA (Harigaya et al., ), thereby
  allowing its substrate RNAs to accumulate. The only middle meiotic transcript known
  to be a direct target of the mmi1 pathway is mei4, which encodes a transcription
  factor that in turn regulates a large number of target genes (bottom). Some of these
  transcripts, highlighted in bold in both halves of the figure, also display enhanced
  accumulation in one or more surveillance mutants (B). For most of the mei4 target
  genes, there is no discernible peak in transcription (A; middle right); these genes
  include mei4 itself, which is subject to autoregulation (Abe and Shimoda, ). Two
  genes containing the Mei4p recognition element (see text under “Not all targets
  of the Mei4p transcription factor…“) show a spike in transcription at 3 h, whereas
  seven show a peak at 5 h (bottom left). Only two genes fit none of the regulatory
  paradigms defined to date (bottom middle).
