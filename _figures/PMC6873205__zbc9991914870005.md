caption: Biosynthesis of fatty acid-like/polyketides in birds, insects, and urchins.
  A, canonical biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides starts by the condensation
  of the acyl starter unit with the extender unit (malonyl), resulting in a β-keto
  ester. This 2-carbon elongation step is followed by reactions involving a series
  of tailoring enzymes, KR, DH, and enoylreductase, that fully reduces the keto ester
  to the alkyl ester. B, in MuPKS, inactivity of the enoylreducatse domain (ER°) leads
  to accumulation of polyene pigments giving rise to bird color. C, structure of echinochrome
  from sea urchins and carminic acid from beetles. Only DcUGT, the glucosidase from
  beetles, has been experimentally confirmed, but these compounds are thought to arise
  from a PKS pathway.
