caption: gp130-dependent cytokines promote axon regeneration and SOCS3 act as a critical
  negative regulator of the signaling pathway. Injury-induced cytokines act on their
  receptor complexes with a shared component gp130 and activate the JAK-STAT cascade
  in both PNS and CNS neurons. Phosphorylated STAT-3 is translocated to the nucleus
  and initiate gene expression for axon regeneration. However, in the adult CNS, the
  activation of this pathway leads to the up-regulation of SOCS3 which will inhibit
  JAK2 and STAT3 and in turn inhibit this pathway. Thus, in SOCS3 deleted RGCs, both
  endogenous and exogenous cytokines such as CNTF promote significant axon regeneration
  [ 50**].
