caption: The renin-angiotensin system is a pivotal regulator of hypertension, which
  controls the homeostasis of main electrolytes and body fluids. It starts with liver
  synthesis of the angiotensin (Ang) peptide precursor, named angiotensinogen. Subsequently,
  the potent vasoconstrictive peptide Ang II is cleaved by ACE, which increases blood
  pressure through the activation of Ang II type 1 (AT1R). In contrast, ACE2 inactivates
  Ang II by removing the C-terminal phenyl alanine residue to yield heptapeptide Ang
  (1–7), which exerts its opposing effects through the Mas receptor. Ang I is also
  cleaved to Ang (1–7) and Ang (1–9) by the action of neprilysin and ACE2, respectively.
  Then, Ang-1–9 is cleaved with the help of either NEP or ACE to produce Ang-1–7 in
  a minor pathway. Higher levels of Ang (1–7) originate from Ang II rather than Ang
  I and Ang (1–9).
