caption: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls circadian rhythms through its
  projections to hypothalamic regions. Rhythms in aggression propensity are regulated
  by the SCN via the subparaventricular zone (SPZ), which receives the majority of
  SCN axonal output and projects to neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)
  that promote attack behavior, including those that express estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1).
  SPZ neurons also innervate the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), forming a circuit
  by which the SCN regulates circadian rhythms of sleep-wake, locomotor activity,
  and feeding behavior. DMH neurons also innervate two key centers for sympathetic
  responses during “fight-or-flight” stress, the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM)
  and raphe pallidus (RPa), forming a pathway that likely underlies the rhythmic autonomic
  support during temporal changes in aggression propensity. Similarly, DMH projections
  to the paraventricular nucleus (PV) are thought to modulate the corticotropin-releasing-hormone
  (CRH) response to stressful stimuli and also modulate circadian rhythms of corticosterone.
  The DMH also projects to orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which
  have been suggested to regulate the hyperarousal during fight-or-flight responses.
  Finally, DMH neurons also receive innervation from the region of the VMH associated
  with promoting aggression, representing the possible pathway by which aggressive
  behavior reciprocally influences circadian autonomic regions. Hatched lines represent
  relatively sparser projections from the SCN to the DMH and PV, compared to SCN projections
  to the SPZ.
