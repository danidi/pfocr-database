caption: Genes comprising simple linearly ordered pathways operate in a network context.
  A The classic view of TGF-β signaling (Alberts ) involves Tgfbr2 as a key component.
  Tgfbr2 was recently identified and validated as an obesity susceptibility gene.
  B The genes comprising the TGF-β signaling pathway are correlated with hundreds
  of other genes in the liver network (Schadt et al. ) so that components of this
  pathway affect and are affected by many different parts of the network
