caption: 'Notch Pathway: Interaction of Notch with Jagged on the neighboring cell,
  leads to the release of NICD that translocate into the nucleus and binds to CSL
  thereby aiding in transcription of Hes family of repressor proteins. Hes functions
  by blocking the transcription of pro neural genes. Green arrow: activation. Red
  cross: inhibition of transcription. Abbreviation: NICD: notch intracellular domain;
  CSL: CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1.'
