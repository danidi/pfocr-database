caption: Schematic outline highlighting the complex regulation of BMP-2-induced osteoblastogenesis.
  BMP-2 binding to the BMP-2 Receptor (BMPR) activates the canonical BMP signaling
  pathway that regulates osteoblastic differentiation. Our present results suggest
  that BMP-2 downregulates the expression of miR-203 and miR-320b, in turn upregulating
  the transcription factor Dlx5 (Distal-less Homeobox 5). Dlx5 up regulation activates
  both the transcription factors Runx2 and Osx, promoting osteoblast differentiation.
  This in turn results in the upregulation of genes important for bone formation and
  calcification, e.g., collagen type I (COL1A1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Osteopontin
  (OPN) and osteonectin (ON).
