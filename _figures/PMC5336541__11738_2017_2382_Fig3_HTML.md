caption: Putative crosstalk among Ca2+, ROS and apoptosis in cassava storage roots
  during PPD. The network was generated with Pathway Studio software default. Regulation
  is marked as an arrow with R, MolSynthesis as an arrow with Ms, Chemical Reaction
  as an arrow with C, MolTransport as an arrow with Mt, Direct Regulation as an arrow
  with D, Expression as an arrow with E and Binding as an arrow without any marks
