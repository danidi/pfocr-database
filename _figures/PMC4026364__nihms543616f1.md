caption: p53 is able to transcriptionally repress glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4
  along with the insulin receptor (IR) to inhibit cellular glucose uptake in to the
  cell. Through transcriptional activation of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis
  regulator (TIGAR), p53 decreases the rate of glycolysis and redirect glycolytic
  intermediates into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Glycolysis is also dampened
  by negative regulation of phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) by p53. In contrast, transcriptional
  activation of hexokinase II (HK II) by mutant p53 stimulates glycolysis. The mitochondrion
  is the site of ATP generation via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron-transport
  chain (ETC). p53 promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) through transcriptional
  activation of synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2), a regulator of complex
  IV and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) that acts directly on complex 1. By regulating
  transcription and stability of ribonucleotide reductase subunit (p53R2), p53 maintains
  mitochondrial homeostasis and mitochondrial genome integrity. p53 is able to transcriptionally
  regulate and interact with the nuclear encoded mitochondrial transcription factor
  A (TFAM) and play a role in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and in regulating
  mtDNA content. Genotoxic stress signals trigger cytoplasmic p53 to undergo MDM2-dependent
  mono-ubiquitination that induces translocation of p53 to the mitochondria. P53 is
  then deubiquitinated by herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP),
  which generates a mitochondrially-restricted, apoptotically capable pool of p53
  protein. Mitochondrial p53 has been shown to interact and inhibit anti-apoptotic
  members of the Bcl-2 protein family and can directly trigger apoptosis by interacting
  with Bax and Bcl-xL. Combined role of transcriptional and mitochondrial functions
  of p53 in regulating apoptosis is evident in involvement of Bcl-xL, PUMA, and NOXA.
  Mitochondrial p53 has been demonstrated to block the antioxidant function of manganese
  superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Role of p53 in regulating metabolic pathways is an
  emerging rapidly moving area of research, and the influence of p53 on metabolism
  is likely to be much more complex than illustrated here.
