caption: A schematic diagram of Tryptophan (Trp) metabolic pathways. Three major Trp
  metabolic pathways are also known. The conversion of Trp to 5-hydroxytryptamine
  (serotonin, 5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) via the serotonin (5-HT)
  pathway (A), and to indole metabolites, such as indoleacetic acid (IAA), via the
  transamination pathway (B). The kynurenine (Kyn) pathway, which is the central pathway
  for Trp degradation in the liver (C). over 95% of dietary Trp, which is not used
  in protein synthesis, is metabolized by this pathway (C). Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
  (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) are the initial and rate-limiting key
  enzymes in the same step of the Kyn pathway.
