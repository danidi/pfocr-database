caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed pathways that regulate astroglial
  CNTF. This study identifies an inhibitory pathway (Red) where ligands such neuronal
  Thy-1 bind to astrocyte αvβ5 integrin resulting in FAK phosphorylation. Subsequently,
  JNK is activated and phosphorylates STAT3 at an inhibitory serine-727 (s727) residue
  potently repressing transcription of CNTF. Conversely, the CNTF-stimulatory pathway
  is activated by neural cytokines such as CNTF, LIF and IL-6 which bind to their
  respective gp130 (gp) receptor complexes (CNTF: CNTFαR/LIFβR/gp130; LIF: LIFβR/gp130;
  IL-6: IL-6αR/gp130/gp130; Lβ indicates LIFβR), triggering recruitment of JAK to
  activate STAT3 by phosphorylation at the pro-transcription residue tyrosine-705,
  y705; Green). CNTF is known to activate STAT3 in astrocytes in vitro [,-] and in
  vivo []. FAK may simultaneously stimulate the activating pathway, potentially representing
  another component of the tightly regulated CNTF gene expression under physiological
  conditions.'
