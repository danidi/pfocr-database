caption: The schematic diagram depicts the mechanism of CPP-induced enhancement of
  sensitivity to TRAIL in ESCC cells. In ESCC cells, high expression of FoxP3 can
  inhibit the expression of DR4 and DR5. CPP could upregulate the expression of DR4
  and DR5 through downregulating the expression of FoxP3. In the presence of a sufficient
  level of DR4/DR5, TRAIL could induce the downstream death signaling. On the other
  hand, CPP could affect the nuclear localization of β-catenin to inhibit the activity
  of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thus inhibiting the transcription of Survivin, which further
  promotes apoptosis of ESCC cells. Therefore, CPP can enhance the sensitivity of
  ECSS cells to TRAIL treatment in vitro and in vivo
