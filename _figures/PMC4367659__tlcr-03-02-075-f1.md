caption: 'In normal tissue repair NF2 activates the Hippo pathway, an essential regulator
  of cell proliferation. Key components of the Hippo pathway include two kinases:
  Mst and Lats. The sequential activation of these kinases leads to phosphorylation
  of the transcription factor YAP. When Hippo signaling is attenuated, e.g., in NF2-deficient
  cancer cells, YAP phosphorylation is reduced, resulting in its nuclear localization
  and regulation of target genes such as CTGF, Cyr61, AXL and survivin. Survivin is
  also controlled by nuclear NF2.'
