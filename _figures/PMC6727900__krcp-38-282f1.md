caption: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway bridges the nervous and immune
  systems. Afferent vagus nerves are stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines. The
  signal activates efferent vagus nerves via the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)
  and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) in the brain. Activated efferent vagus
  nerves stimulate splenic nerves, resulting in release of norepinephrine (NE). CD4-positive
  T cells in the spleen release acetylcholine (ACh) after NE binds to β2 adrenergic
  receptors (β2AR). Alpha 7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR)-positive
  macrophages receive Ach, leading to anti-inflammatory responses such as release
  of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The dotted lines are strongly suggested,
  though not conclusively proven, pathways.SGN, sympathetic ganglionic neuron; SPGN,
  sympathetic preganglionic neuron.
