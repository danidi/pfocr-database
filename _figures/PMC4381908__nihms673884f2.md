caption: A schematic illustration of the current concepts of mechanism by which adjudin
  perturbs apical ES function in the seminiferous epithelium to induce germ cell loss
  from the seminiferous epithelium. During spermatogenesis, such as in the seminiferous
  epithelium of a stage VII tubule (left panel), the expression of EPS8 is high at
  the apical ES for the maintenance of F-actin organization via its actin bundling
  activity to stabilize that apical ES. The integrity of the apical ES in this stage
  VII tubule is also maintained via an elevated expression of p-FAK-Tyr397, perhaps
  being used to maintain the proper phosphorylation status of the constituent proteins
  at the apical ES (), as well as to recruit additional adaptors (e.g. p130 Cas, vinculin)
  to the site to reinforce cell adhesion (). As spermatogenesis proceeds (lower panel),
  ARP3, whose expression is also high at the apical ES in stage VII (), causes ‘debundling’
  of actin filaments by promoting actin branching. At the same time, endocytosis facilitates
  recycling of apical ES proteins for the assembly of ‘new’ apical ES that arises
  via spermiogenesis such as newly formed step 8 spermatids (). At stage VIII of the
  seminiferous epithelial cycle when spermiation occurs, the apical ES is destabilized
  as the result of ‘debundling’ of actin filament due to the down-regulation of EPS8
  with concomitant actin branching promoted by ARP3 (, ). On the other hand, new apical
  ES is being assembled for developing step 8–9 spermatids, such as via protein transcytosis
  and/or de novo synthesis of ‘new’ apical ES proteins. When rats are treated with
  adjudin (right panel), the above-described events, which only take place for step
  18–19 spermatids during stage VII–VIII tubule, are ‘triggered’ to occur ‘prematurely’
  at the apical ES in other stages of tubules with step 8–19 spermatids. Therefore,
  spermiation takes place ‘prematurely’ in developing spermatids in other staged tubules
  besides stage VIII. In addition, p-FAK-Tyr397 is highly expressed at the apical
  ES for the induction of the integrin/FAK/PI3-kinase/p130Cas/MAP kinase signaling
  pathway () to further destabilize apical ES to cause ‘premature’ spermiation in
  spermatids from steps 8 to 19.
