caption: Wild type C. albicans enters the glycolysis pathway by converting mannitol
  to mannose, a step catalyzed by the NAD+-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase whose
  activity is sustained by CI via producing NAD+. CI dysfunction by deleting NUO2
  inhibits hyphal growth, biofilm formation and gastrointestinal commensalism through
  at least two distinct mechanisms. For the first mechanism, deletion of NUO2 blocks
  the glycolytic pathway by decreasing availability of NAD+ and therefore inhibits
  hyphae and biofilm formation through an as yet uncharacterized way. For the second
  mechanism, cells lacking NUO2 produces high levels of ROS which triggers a mannitol-dependent
  signaling pathway involving Hog1 MAPK activation and Brg1 repression. In consequence,
  downregulation of HSGs inhibits the hyphal growth and biofilm development in a mannitol-dependent
  manner. By responding to nutrients available in gastrointestinal tract, C. albicans
  cells adjust CI activity to coordinate pathways required for hyphal morphogenesis
  and biofilm development that possibly promotes commensalism.
