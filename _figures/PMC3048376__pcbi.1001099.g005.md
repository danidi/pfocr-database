caption: Topologies of the family of filtered cFL models trained to the HepG2 dataset.
  Unprocessed cFL models can be found in  and fit of the filtered models to the data
  in . Nodes represent proteins that were either ligand stimulations (green), inhibited
  (orange), measured by a phospho-specific bead-based antibody assay (blue), or could
  not be removed without introducing potential logical inconsistency (white). The
  grey/black intensity scale of the gates corresponds to the proportion of individual
  models within the family that include that gate. Thus, links colored black were
  present in all models whereas links colored grey were present in a fraction of the
  models. Where visually feasible, cFL gates are labeled with a numerical value that
  corresponds to a quantitative sensitivity of the input-output relationship. Sensitivity
  is calculated as described in the . The larger this value, the lower the level of
  the input nodes' activity required for generating significant output node activity
  (i.e. a gate with a high sensitivity indicates that the output node is sensitive
  to a low value of its input node). The uncertainties in these values arise from
  the various best-fit EC50 for each individual model. The graph of the cFL models
  was generated by a CellNOpt routine using the graphviz visualization engine (www.graphviz.org)
  followed by manual annotation in Adobe Illustrator.
