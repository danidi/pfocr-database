caption: The mechanism by which Ang II mediates vasoconstriction. The binding of Ang
  II to the AT1-R activates the heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathway which leads
  to phospholipase C (PLC) activation. This releases inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). IP3
  binds to its receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing for Ca2+ efflux. Ang
  II also promotes an influx of external Ca2+ via calcium release activated calcium
  (CRAC) channels. Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and activates myosin light chain kinase
  (MLCK), which phosphorylates the myosin light chain and enhances the interaction
  between actin and myosin, resulting in enhanced vasoconstriction.
