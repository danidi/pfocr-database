caption: Working model proposing how TFAP2C and TEAD4 promote formation of the apical
  domain, which in turn, negatively regulate LATS1/2 activity in the outside polar
  cells. Between the eight-cell to morula transition TFAP2C positively regulates the
  expression of Pard6b and Rock1/2 genes. TEAD4 positively regulates the expression
  of key actin regulators such as ARP2/3 to promote actin polymerization. Par-6 family
  cell polarity regulator beta (PARD6B) contributes to formation of the apical domain
  by forming a complex with PAR3 and PKCζ. The TEAD4-ARP2/3 axis promotes localization
  of apical domain proteins to the outside membrane. Rho and Rho-associated coiled-coil
  kinases 1 and 2 (ROCK1/2) reinforces the apical localization of cell polarity proteins
  and represses LATS1/2 activity. Depletion of TFAP2C, TEAD4, PARD6B or ARP2/3 or
  inhibition of ROCK1/2 activity disrupts apical cell polarity and triggers the activation
  of LATS1/2 in the outside cells.
