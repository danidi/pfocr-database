caption: 'Purine biosynthesis: synthesis of IMP. Various atoms of the purine ring
  originate from different sources, i.e. N3, N9 derive from the amido group of Gln
  (blue), N7, C5, C4 derive from Gly (green), C6 from CO2 (black), N1 from the amino
  group of Asp (red) and C2, C8 from N10formyl-tetrahydrofolate. Enzyme names: (1)
  glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT); (2) glycinamide ribotide
  synthase (GART); (3) glycinamide ribotide transformylase (GART); (4) formylglycinamide
  synthase (PFAS); (5) aminoimidazole ribotide synthase (GART); (6) aminoimidazole
  ribotide carboxylase (PAICS); (7) succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide synthase
  (PAICS); (8) adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL); (9) aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide
  transformylase (ATIC); (10) IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC). IMP is the common precursor
  of AMP and GMP. The pathway from IMP to GMP and AMP are shown in Supplementary Figure
  S2.'
