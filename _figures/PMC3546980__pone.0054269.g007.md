caption: iRF decreases the capacity of cell migration through inhibition of MMP-9
  and MMP-2 activities as well as expression. Furthermore, the expression of a physiological
  inhibitor of MMPs, TIMP-1, was augmented by iRF. In addition, cell survival mediator,
  mTOR, was less active as well as Src kinase, an important key player of cell invasion.
  As we have shown previously in other cancer cell lines, iRF also induced B16F10
  cells death by apoptosis since the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is
  reduced. Bcl-2 acts by inhibiting Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein responsible to cytochrome-C
  release, and activation of caspases, leading cells to apoptosis. Furthermore, the
  expression of cIAP, a caspase 3, was diminished. HH is another pathway that seems
  to be important for iRF antimelanoma action. iRF inhibits HH pathway by downregulating
  GLI-1 and PATCH expression and overexpression of SUFU. GLI-1 can be sequestered
  by SUFU forming a complex with kif7 (Cos homologue in mice), thus keeping GLI-1
  in the cytoplasm and preventing translocation to the nucleus, making it unable to
  activate the transcriptional program of the HH pathway.
