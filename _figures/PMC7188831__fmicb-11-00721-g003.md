caption: Adaptors of Salmonella autophagy. (A) NDP52 functions as a scaffold for the
  assembly of a TBK1-Sintbad-Nap1 signaling complex, transports Salmonella marked
  by ubiquitin (Ub) or damaged SCV membranes marked by galectin-8 into the autophagic
  pathway through an interaction with LC3C. (B) P62 serves as an autophagy adaptor,
  was recruited to ubiquitinated Salmonella targeted by autophagy. The ring finger
  protein 166 (RNF166) is vital for the recruitment of the autophagy adaptor p62 to
  ubiquitinated Salmonella. (C) OPTN recognizes ubiquitinated Salmonella and targets
  them for autophagy. Phosphorylation (P) of OPTN by TBK1 promotes its interaction
  with LC3. (D) TAX1BP1, a close homolog of NDP52, also acts as an autophagy adaptor
  in Salmonella autophagy. In response to membrane damage caused by bacteria, LAMTOR2
  is recruited to the damaged membrane and associates with galectins. LAMTOR2 then
  recruits TAX1BP1 to promote the formation of autophagy.
