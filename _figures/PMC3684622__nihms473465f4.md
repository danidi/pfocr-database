caption: (A) miRNAs as negative feedback to dampen the expression of multiple positive
  signaling molecules. (B) miRNAs as a positive feedback to dampen a single negative
  signaling molecule. (C) miRNAs as a negative tuner of immune signaling by controlling
  the expression of multiple negative signaling molecules. (D) Effects of miRNA control
  on the strength and threshold of immune signaling. A1, A2, and An represent positive
  signaling molecules in the pathway (i.e. the positive kinases). B1, B2, and Bn represent
  negative signaling molecules in the pathway (i.e. the phosphatases that inactive
  positive kinases).
