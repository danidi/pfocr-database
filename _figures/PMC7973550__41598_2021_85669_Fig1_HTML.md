caption: 'Experimental and data analysis workflow. Longitudinally collected blood
  samples including: C (pre-irradiation), SD1 (day 1 post-irradiation), SD2 (day 2),
  SD3 (day 3), SD35 (day 35), SD60 (day 60) were collected from 7 NHPs for NextSeq
  500 paired-end sequencing analyses and downstream bioinformatics analyses. Differential
  gene expression and functional pathway analysis were performed for gaining insight
  into radiation response in the survivors and non-survivors. Figure is created by
  the author using Microsoft PowerPoint (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint).'
