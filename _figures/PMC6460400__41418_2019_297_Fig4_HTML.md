caption: Role of autophagy in antigen presentation by dendritic cells. Autophagy promotes
  the presentation of antigens on MHC class II molecules, but hinders their presentation
  on MHC class I molecules. a Autophagy supports presentation of exogenous phagocytosed
  antigens on MHC class II molecules. Extracellular proteins are phagocytosed, and
  LC3-II is recruited to phagosomal membranes enhancing fusion between phagosomes
  and lysosomes. Recruitment of MHC class II molecules to phagolysosomes and their
  loading with antigenic peptides is facilitated, leading to upregulation of MHC class
  II molecules on the surface of DCs and stimulation of CD4+ helper T cells. b Autophagosomes
  can target cytosolic proteins for lysosomal degradation, delivering them to the
  MHC class II loading compartment. This classical autophagy pathway enables MHC class
  II presentation of intracellular antigens and gives rise to a CD4+ helper T cell
  response. c Autophagy compromises the presentation of antigens on MHC class I molecules
  through their increased internalization. LC3-II molecules recruit the internalization
  machinery to MHC class I molecules on the surface of DCs and target them for intracellular
  transport, reducing CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses
