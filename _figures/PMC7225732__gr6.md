  diet produces an excess of acetyl-CoA, which is the energy source for generation
  of ATP. The excess of acetyl-CoA can also be used for synthesis of cholesterol and
  subsequently for synthesis of oxysterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol by key enzymes,
  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (C25HL)
  (). 25HC activates LXR and upregulates SREBP-1C expression, which results in increasing
  biosynthesis of free fatty acids and triglycerides in a known pathway. On the other
  hand, 25HC enters nuclei and activates DNMT1, which selectively methylates CpG in
  promoter regions and silences gene expression, leading to down-regulation of many
  signaling pathways including PI3K, cAMP, insulin, NAFLD, and metabolic pathways.
  The dashed blue lines represent known pathways, and the red solid lines represent
  the proposed pathways. The proposed pathways play an important role in the occurrence
  of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome.
