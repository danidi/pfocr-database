caption: Signaling pathways involved in the exocytic insertion of canalicular transporters
  promoted by cAMP and by TC and TUDC. cAMP effect involves elevation in cytosolic
  Ca2+ and activation of the PI3K-dependent pathway. Formation of the CaM complex
  promotes apical insertion of transporters via unidentified mediators, and is counter-regulated
  by activation of cPKC. PI3K promotes exocytic insertion of canalicular transporters
  by activation of PKCδ and Erk-1 and Erk-2 of MAPK, via the Ras/Raf- MAPK kinase
  (MEK)-Erk-1/2 pathway. TC and TUDC also evoke the PI3K-dependent signaling pathway
  and promote insertion of canalicular transporters via the Ras/Raf-MEK-Erk-1/2 pathway.
  TUDC also stimulates canalicular carrier insertion by activation of MAPKs of the
  p38MAPK type, by an unknown mechanism.
