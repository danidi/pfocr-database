caption: High-affinity IgE is derived from the CD80+ pro-PC subset of IgG1 memory
  cells in mouse memory responses. Two subsets of mouse IgG1 memory cells identified
  by differential expression of CD80 and CD73 have distinct differentiation potential
  upon activation. (A) CD80+CD73+ pro-plasma cell (Pro-PC) IgG1 memory cells generate
  with fast kinetics IgG1 PC and IgE PC enriched in high affinity clones. IgE antibodies
  derived in this pathway mediate anaphylactic responses. (B) CD80−CD73− pro-germinal
  center (Pro-GC) IgG1 memory cells respond to activation with slower kinetics. They
  preferentially differentiate into IgG1 GC cells, and also generate a late response
  of low affinity non-pathogenic IgE PC.
