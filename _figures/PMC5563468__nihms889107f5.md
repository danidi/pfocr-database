caption: Regulation of the ROCK/MRTF/SRF pathway in fibroblasts. ROCKs activate myocardin-related
  transcription factor (MRTF) and serum response factor (SRF). which leads to profibrotic
  gene expression in myofibroblasts. RhoA/ROCKs activation by extracellular stimuli
  promotes the assembly of F-actin, which enables MRTF to dissociate from G-actin,
  leading to its nuclear translocation and subsequent binding to SRF. SRF/MRTF initiates
  transcription of several profibrotic genes. ROCKs, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing
  kinases; TGF, transforming growth factor.
