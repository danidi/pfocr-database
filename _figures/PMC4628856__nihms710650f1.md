caption: 'The synthesis of purines involves a multi-step pathway that builds the purine
  ring on top of the pentose ring of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). In the fourth
  step, FGAR aminotransferase (FGARAT, or PurL in prokaryotes) catalyzes the transfer
  of an amino group from glutamine (Gln) on to the pre-formed ring on formylglycineamide
  ribonucleotide (FGAR), resulting in the formation of formylglycineamidine ribonucleotide
  (FGAM). The aminotransferase domain of FGARAT shares structural homology with that
  of the fifth step enzyme AIR Synthetase (PurM in prokaryotes), which closes the
  ring of FGAM to form 5-Aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR). This multi-step pathway
  (10 steps in eukaryotes, 11 steps in other organisms) ultimately results in the
  complete purine ring on the purine precursor: Inosinate (IMP). In the middle steps,
  R denotes the 5-phospho-D-ribosyl group. Figure adapted from [].'
