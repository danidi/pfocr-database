caption: Signaling pathway of HMGB1 in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Following
  thrombosis, the pressure in the veins and capillaries is higher and blood return
  is limited, leading to tissue hypoxia. Subsequently, damaged tissue can actively
  or passively release HMGB1, triggering downstream inflammatory responses, participating
  in BBB disruption, apoptosis and nerve damage, and further aggravating brain damage.
  HMGB1, high mobility group box B1; BBB, blood brain barrier; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor α; IL, interleukin; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; TLR-4, Toll-like
  receptor 4.
