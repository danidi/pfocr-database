caption: Pentose phosphate pathway. All the enzymes required were detected in mass
  spectrometry experiments. The red arrow in the pathway refers to the significant
  enzymes that belong to clusters 3 or 4. The green arrow refers to the significant
  enzymes that belong to clusters 1 and 2. The blue arrow refers to the enzymes that
  were detected in mass spectrometry but were not significantly changing over time.
