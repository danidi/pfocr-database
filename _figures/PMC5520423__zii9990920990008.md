caption: AtvR and the complex regulation of denitrification genes in P. aeruginosa.
  The structural genes for each electron transfer complex, nitrate (Nar), nitrite
  (Nir), nitric oxide (Nor), and nitrous oxide (Nos) reductases (gray boxes), are
  regulated by the Anr transcription activator, the TCS NarXL, the Dnr activator,
  and the newly discovered AtvR. Black arrows, electron transfer pathway; colored
  and solid arrows, positive transcriptional regulation; red dashed arrows, factors
  that affect the activity of the regulators are shown, in which the arrows point
  to the targets.
