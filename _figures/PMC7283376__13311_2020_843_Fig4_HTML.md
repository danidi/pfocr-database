caption: General depiction of brain metabolism. Diagram of glucose metabolism. Glucose
  can be processed through 3 main metabolic pathways. The first metabolic pathway
  is glycolysis (i), which gives rise to 2 molecules of pyruvate as well as one molecule
  of ATP and NADH each. Then, this pyruvate enters the mitochondria, where it is metabolized
  through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, producing ATP
  and CO2 using oxygen as electron acceptor (iv). Lactate dehydrogenase, during hypoxia
  or depending on the cellular metabolic profile, reduces pyruvate to lactate, which
  can be liberated to extracellular by monocarboxylate transporter. Compared to glycolysis
  (2 ATPs), the complete oxidation of glucose produces larger amounts of energy in
  the form of ATP in the mitochondria (30–36 ATPs). Alternatively, the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) can process the glucose-6P (ii), leading to the production of reducing
  equivalents in the form of NADPH, which is important for defense against oxidative
  stress. Then, the glutathione reductase uses NADPH as an electron donor to recycle
  back the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) formed to glutathione. In astrocytes, glucose-6P
  can also be used to store glucosyl units as glycogen (iii). Reprinted from Magistretti
