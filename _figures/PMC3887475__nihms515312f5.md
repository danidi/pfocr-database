caption: When we conducted further studies to test whether the oxidation pathway could
  be generalized, we found that cyclopentenones with exocyclic double bonds could
  be obtained in good yields from several other substrates with electron-withdrawing
  aromatic substituents (62–92% yield; ). The isomerization of the C1–C2 olefin of
  9 was also observed by 1H NMR during its conversion to 10 (, Entry 1). Interestingly,
  substrates 13 and 15 were transformed into products 14 and 16 exclusively (, Entries
  3 and 4). The stereochemistry of compound 14 was assigned by NOE analysis. The result
  obtained with substrate 17 was initially surprising (, Entry 5). We did not observe
  a second [1,2]-phenyl shift, as might be expected based on the result shown in .
  The result may be understood by comparing intermediates 4 and 4’ (). The C5 to C1
  phenyl shift is probably hindered by the C2 phenyl in 4’, whereas in 4, the C2 phenyl
  is not in a position to impede the second [1,2] phenyl shift. Lastly, when substrate
  19 was refluxed with one equivalent of tBuBox-Cu(SbF6)2 in an open vessel, oxidation
  product cyclopentenone 20 was obtained (, Entry 6). In this case, the use of (MeCN)5Cu(SbF6)2
  as promoter led to the exclusive formation of the classical Nazarov cycloadduct.
