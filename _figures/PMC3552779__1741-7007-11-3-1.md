caption: Aerobic glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and key glycolytic shunts. The
  diagram depicts glycolysis and ending with pyruvate and lactate. Intermediates are
  named and shown with space-filled models. The GLUT transporter and enzymes are shown
  with key rate-limiting steps highlighted in red. Reactions branching to the left
  are the pentose phosphate pathway, which produces ribose and NADPH; phosphofructokinase-fructose
  bisphosphatase (PFKFB), which produces fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric
  activator of phosphofructokinase (PFKM); PFKM production of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  and phophoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH)-mediated production of serine. The last
  two allosterically activate pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Pyruvate is shown converted
  to acetyl-CoA for further oxidation through the citric acid cycle depicted with
  intermediates forming in the mitochondrion. HK2, hexokinase 2; GPI, glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase; ALDA, aldolase A; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGK1,
  phosphoglycerate kinase 1; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase; ENO1, enolase 1; LDHA,
  lactate dehydrogenase. Allosteric regulation is depicted by green dotted lines.
