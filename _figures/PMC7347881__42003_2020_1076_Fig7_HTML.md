caption: a Differential H3K27me3 binding events to super-enhancer (SE) regions are
  depicted as a cartoon model leading to derepression of downstream pathways and feed-forward
  overexpression of oncogenic NOTCH signaling and neurogenesis pathways. b NOTCH signaling
  pathway consists of upstream ASCL1 expression, leading to inter-cell activation
  and cleavage of NOTCH1 by γ-secretase, with eventual translocation of NICD to the
  nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors, including RBPJ, thereby inducing
  transcription activation of genes, such as HES5. Increased NOTCH signaling has been
  described as a hallmark of some cancers leading to increased cell cycle transitions.
  We showed H3.3 mutant glioma cells have elevated expression of NOTCH pathway genes.
  Transient overexpression (OE) of ASCL1 is sufficient to increase cell viability
  of H3.3WT-reverted gliomas. siRNA knockdown (KD) of ASCL1 and RBPJ as well as drug
  inhibition of γ-secretase with DAPT or RBPJ with RIN1 lead to decreased cell viability
  of H3.3K27M glioma cells in culture. While this model shows ASCL1 OE upstream and
  ASCL1 KD downstream in the pathway, changes in ASCL1 expression could act in either
  position to affect cell viability.
