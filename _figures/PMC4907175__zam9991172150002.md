caption: Schematic representation of partnership between a diazotrophic bacterial
  cell and a nodulating plant cell during symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Rhizobia induce
  the formation of nodules on legumes using either Nod factor-dependent or Nod factor-independent
  processes. In the Nod factor-dependent strategy, plants release signals, such as
  flavonoids, that are perceived by compatible bacteria in the rhizosphere. This activates
  the nodulation (nod) genes of rhizobia, which in turn synthesize and release bacterial
  signals, mainly lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) (Nod factors), which trigger early
  events in the nodulation process. Synthesis of the Nod factors backbone is controlled
  by the canonical nodABC genes, which are present in all rhizobia, but a combination
  of other nodulation genes (nod, nol, or noe) encode the addition of various decorations
  to the core structure. In the Nod factor-independent process, bacteria enter in
  the plant via cracks in the epidermis. Accumulation of cytokinin synthesized by
  the bacteria in these infection zones might trigger nodule organogenesis. In the
  mature nodule, bacteria progressively experience lower oxygen concentrations and
  differentiate into bacteroids, fixing diffused nitrogen gas using their nitrogenase
  enzyme complex. NH3 produced by nitrogenase from the bacteria (nif, fix, and cytochrome
  bd) can be incorporated into amino acids via the glutamine synthetase-glutamate
  synthase (GS-GOGAT) pathway. NH3 can also diffuse through the bacterial membrane
  and be transported to the plant cytoplasm via ammonia transporters (e.g., AmtB),
  where it is assimilated into nitrogen compounds (amino acids, proteins, and alkaloids)
  in exchange for food molecules, e.g., glucose, amino acids, and other saccharides.
  The plant provides amino acids to the bacterial cell and in return the bacterial
  cell cycles amino acids back to the plant for asparagine synthesis. Other nutrients
  have to be made available for the microbe, including phosphorus, sulfur, molybdenum,
  and cobalt. Asn, asparagine; Asp, aspartate; αKG, alpha ketoglutarate; AmtB, ammonia
