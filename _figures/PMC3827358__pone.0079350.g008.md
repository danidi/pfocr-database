caption: LPS treatment down-regulates caveolin-3 levels via TLR4-mediated iNOS activation,
  which in turn reduces the expression of Cx43. LPS also induces JNK phosphorylation,
  resulting in GJIC inhibition, gap junction disassembly, and Cx43 degradation by
  the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.
