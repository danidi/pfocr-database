caption: Figure 1. Gln metabolism is rewired in pancreatic cancer to facilitate NADPH
  production. (A) Canonical anabolic Gln metabolism. Gln-derived Glu is processed
  into αKG through mitochondrial GLUD1, which is used for anaplerotic filling of the
  TCA cycle (green circle). The TCA cycle is coupled to the malate-aspartate shuttle
  (blue circle), which is used to bring reducing equivalents derived from glycolysis
  into the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation. (B) In pancreatic cancer, Gln
  metabolism is reprogrammed through the mutant Kras-mediated activation of GOT1 expression
  and repression of GLUD1. Repression of GLUD1 promotes the mitochondrial aspartate
  aminotransferase (GOT2)-mediated generation of Asp in the mitochondria. This Asp
  is released into the cytosol and converted through a series of reactions into pyruvate
  and reducing potential in the form of NADPH. This series of reactions decouples
  TCA cycle activity from the malate-aspartate shuttle. Enzymes that facilitate this
  pathway are presented in upper-case letters. Metabolites are presented in lower-case
  letters. Cit, citrate; Fum, fumarate; Pyr, pyruvate; Iso, isocitrate; Suc, succinate.
