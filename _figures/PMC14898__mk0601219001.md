caption: Sec14p pathway in yeast. The PtdCho- and PtdIns-bound forms of Sec14p are
  proposed to independently regulate inositol and choline phospholipid metabolism
  (reviewed by ). PtdCho-bound Sec14p down-regulates flux through the diacylglycerol
  (DAG)-utilizing CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis. PtdIns-bound Sec14p
  stimulates PtdIns-4-P synthesis via the Pik1p pathway. PtdIns-4-P is a precursor
  for PtdIns-4,5-P2, which is required for activation of PLD. PLD hydrolyzes PtdCho
  to PtdOH and choline. PtdOH is dephosphorylated by PtdOH-phosphohydrolases to DAG.
  Evidence to support individual roles for PtdCho, DAG, PtdOH, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns-4,5-P2
  in modulating yeast Golgi secretory function exists. However, the lipid regulators
  that directly interact with the Sec14p pathway are unclear. Bypass-Sec14p mutations
  used in this study inactivate choline kinase (CKIase; cki1), choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase
  (CCTase; pct1), the SacIp phosphoinositidase (sac1), and the Kes1p oxysterol-binding
  protein homologue (kes1). Known execution points for these enzymes/proteins are
  given. The precise execution point for Kes1p remains unclear.
