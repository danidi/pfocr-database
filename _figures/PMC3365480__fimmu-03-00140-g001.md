caption: Pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of heat and heat shock proteins. Fever
  range temperature exerts both positive and negative effects on macrophage pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production. We proposed that these opposing effects may depend on the activation
  stage of macrophages as well as the cellular location of heat shock proteins. First,
  in the initiation phase of macrophage activation, fever range temperature enhances
  the production of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and NO. (1)
  This thermally enhanced cytokine production is associated with an induction of HSP70/72
  in these cells. (2) HSP70 can then be released into the extracellular environment,
  and (3) exerts its cytokine effect through the CD14/TLR pathway. (4) This leads
  to the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathway and subsequent cytokine gene transcription.
  On the other hand, fever-range temperature can also suppress LPS-induced TNF-α,
  IL-6, and IL-1β production and HMGB-1 release. (5) This is due to thermally induced
  HSF-1 binding directly to the heat shock response element in the cytokine promoter
  region and functions as a transcriptional repressor. (6) In addition, LPS and heat
  treatment can also induce HSP70 expression. HSP70 then binds to TRAF6 or IKK and
  inhibits subsequent NF-κB activation and cytokine production.
