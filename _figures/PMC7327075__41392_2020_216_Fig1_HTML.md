caption: The excessive production and failure of elimination of LPO are key causes
  of ferroptosis. The pathways of eliminating LPO includes system /GSH/GPX4 axis and
  NADPH/FSP1/CoQ10 axis. The cystine ingested by system  is catalyzed to GSH by γ-GCS
  and GSS. GPX4 converts GSH to GSSH to reduce LPO and inhibit ferroptosis. FSP1 catalyzes
  CoQ10 to ubiquinol by NADPH, which acts as a lipophilic radical scavenger that reduces
  LPO. The PUFA-OOH is the main source of LPO. Main peroxidation target PUFAs are
  AA/AdA mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment. After catalyzed
  by ACSL4, LPCAT3, and 15-LOX, AA/AdA is converted to PE-AA-OOH/PE-AdA-OOH to promote
  ferroptosis. The Fenton reaction mediated by Fe2+ produces a large number of HO•
  to promote the peroxidation of PUFA. P53 transcriptionally inhibits SLC7A11, leading
  to the production of 12-LOX-mediated PUFU-OOH upon ROS stress. In addition, transsulfuration
  pathway, MVA pathway and glutaminolysis also participate in the regulation of ferroptosis
