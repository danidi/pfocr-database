caption: 'When melanocortin peptide ligands bind to MCRs, which are prototypical G
  protein coupled receptors, they causes a conformational change in the MCR, which
  allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The MCR can then activate
  an associated G-protein by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP. The G-protein’s α
  subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits
  to further affect intracellular signaling proteins, including adenylyl cyclase and
  phospholipase C, thus trigger the two principal signal transduction pathways involving
  MCRs: cAMP signal pathway and phosphatidylinositol signal pathway. The cAMP-PKA
  pathway regulates the downstream signaling cascades, including the MAPK/ERK mediated
  pro-survival/anti-apoptosis pathway that might protect the glomerular cells, such
  as podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells, from injury and death; the CREB/NFκB
  pathway that balances the pro- and anti-inflammatory reaction as well as the immune
  tolerance and autoimmune response; and the cytoskeleton regulatory signaling pathway
  that might be involved in cytoskeleton remodeling in glomerular cells such as podocytes.
  MEK, MAPK kinase; MCR, melanocortin receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP
  response element binding protein; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; ERK, signal-regulated
  kinase; NFκB, nuclear factor κB.'
