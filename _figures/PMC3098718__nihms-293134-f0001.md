caption: (a) Dissected adult hermaphrodite gonad arm stained for activated MPK-1 (dpMPK-1,
  red) and germ cell nuclear morphology (DAPI, blue). For all Figures, distal (marked
  with *) is to the left, proximal to the right. In the distal region, germ cell sexual
  fate is specified (male/sperm or female/oocyte) while in the medial and proximal
  germline, activated MPK-1 is necessary for physiological control of the oogenesis
  production-line, including membrane organization. (b) Schematic representation of
  the adult hermaphrodite germline, showing a surface view of hexagonally organized
  cells and their membranes from the distal tip through end pachytene (medial-to-loop),
  and an internal view of growing diplotene to diakinesis oocytes in the proximal
  region. Cross-section show cells on the surface of the gonadal tube, each with an
  interior opening to the Rachis that provides cytoplasm to growing oocytes; the interior
  surface can be visualized by anilin staining with non-staining windows representing
  the interior openings. (c) Part of the pathway for germline sex determination is
  shown, with the NOS-3/FEM-CUL-2/TRA-1 module highlighted in blue. (d) Model for
  physiological control of membrane organization during oogenesis. The NOS-3/FEM-CUL-2/TRA-1
  module is regulated by MPK-1 ERK, active (ON) during ongoing oogenesis in the presence
  of sperm/MSP signaling and inactive (OFF) in the absence of sperm/MSP signaling
  when oogenesis is arrested. (See also Figure , , and ; )
