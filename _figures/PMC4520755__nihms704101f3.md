caption: 'The canonical Wnt signalling pathway and pharmacological inhibitors under
  investigation in cancer. Various proteins, including Porcupine and Wntless, regulate
  the secretion on Wnt proteins. LGK974 is an investigational agent that targets Porcupine
  to inhibit Wnt-ligand secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum. Once released, Wnt
  protein binding to Fz-family receptors on neighbouring cells results in intracellular
  signal transduction and gene expression with diverse consequences of relevance to
  cancer. Small molecules and mAbs targeting either the Wnt proteins or Fz receptor
  complexes have been developed to inhibit ligand–receptor interactions. The anti-Fz
  mAb vantictumab and the Wnt decoy receptor OMP-54F28 are currently being tested
  in clinical trials. Activation of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway leads to
  β-catenin accumulation as a result of disruption of a multiprotein destruction complex
  (dashed arrow), mediated by phospho-Dvl, which enables β-catenin to influence gene-expression
  patterns that determine cell differentiation. Small molecules that stabilize the
  multiprotein destruction complex and, thus, promote β-catenin degradation, such
  as tankyrase inhibitors, are in preclinical development. PRI-724 is an investigational
  agent to disrupt β-catenin–CBP complex, which might shift the balance from β-catenin-mediated
  gene-expression patterns that block differentiation (and thus promote cell ‘stemness’)
  to those that promote differentiation, is currently undergoing testing in clinical
  trials. Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli protein; BCL9, B-cell lymphoma
