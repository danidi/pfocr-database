caption: Cartoon representation of DGK signaling in cancer. Upon their activation,
  DGKs phosphorylate DAG to form PA, which results in a series of signaling events
  resulting from the alterations in the signaling of several molecular targets. Several
  studies reported that DGKs regulate cancer cell survival and proliferation via MAPK
  and Akt/mTOR pathways. In addition, DGKs regulate migration via the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway and the Rho GTPase family members. On the other hand, DAG activates several
  critical proteins including both conventional and novel PKCs, mammalian Unc-13,
  chimaerins which activate Rac GTPase, and RasGRPs, which are involved in cell proliferation
  and migration.
