caption: (A). In HER2-amplified primary BC, signals transduced from HER2 through SRC/PKCα/NF-κB
  leads to HER2 and PLAUR mRNA co-expression, but no frequent HER2 and PLAUR co-amplification
  has been observed. (B). However, in an early-stage aggressive HER2-positive BC condition,
  we propose that hyper-activation of HER2 transduces strong signals (bold arrows)
  through SRC or PKCα or NF-κB individually or in a concerted manner, leading to activation
  of members of ETS or KLF family. Consequently, binding of ETS or KLF family members
  on the promoter region of HER2 or PLAUR gene, leads to their co-amplification, thereby
  facilitating the high expression of uPAR and HER2 in HER2-positive BC subtype. Depending
  on the downstream effectors (SRC or PKCα or NF-κB) mediating the signaling pathway,
  one or more members of the ETS and KLF family will be involved in the regulation
  of HER2 and PLAUR gene amplification. According to literature, high expression of
  uPAR is associated with invasive potential of BC. Therefore, it can be assumed that
  high uPAR expression gives the invasive advantage to the early stage aggressive
  HER2-positive BC condition, which is reflected in the high metastatic potential
  of most of the HER2-positive BC subtype that co-overexpress uPAR. Also, depending
  on the availability and binding of endogenous uPA to uPAR, the signaling cascade
  initiated from uPAR in association with integrin family of receptors or GPCRs can
  also increase the expression of HER2 and uPAR at the cell surface following signaling
  mediated by SRC/PKCα/NF-κB (represented by dotted arrow), leading to the activation
  of ETS and KLF transcriptional factors that regulate HER2 and PLAUR gene amplification.
  Green box represents binding site of ETS on HER2 or uPAR promoter region. Red box
  represents binding site of KLF on HER2 or PLAUR promoter region.
