caption: Notch signaling pathway. Notch receptors are synthesized as precursor proteins
  that are cleaved during transport to the cell surface where they are expressed as
  heterodimers. Following the binding of the ligand, placed in the surface of a neighboring
  cell, Notch is activated by two consecutive proteolytic cleavages that release its
  intracellular domain (NICD). The first proteolytic cleavage is mediated by the metalloprotease
  TACE, which cleaves the receptor on the extracellular side near the transmembrane
  domain. The second cleavage occurs within the transmembrane domain and is mediated
  by γ-secretase activity. This final cleavage liberates the NICD, which subsequently
  translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the transcription factor CBF1. This
  interaction converts CBF1 from a transcriptional repressor into a transcriptional
  activator by displacing nuclear co-repressor proteins (CoR) and by recruiting nuclear
  co-activator proteins (CoA).
