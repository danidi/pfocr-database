caption: 'Pathways of complement activation with complement regulators and inhibitors
  highlighted. The complement system is activated primarily through three pathways—classical
  pathway (CP), lectin pathway (LP), and alternative pathway (AP). The CP is activated
  by the recognition of antigen–antibody complexes formed on the surface of the pathogen
  or pathogen-infected cells by the C1 complex (C1qr2s2), whereas the LP is activated
  by the recognition of specific carbohydrate moieties present on the surface of pathogens
  (PAMPs) by the MBL/ficolin–MASP 1/2 complex. Upon recognition, the complexes so
  formed cleave C4 and C2 into C4a and C4b and C2a and C2b, respectively. The C4b
  so formed binds to the membrane and associates with C2a to form the C4b2a complex,
  the CP/LP-C3 convertase. The C3 convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. The C3b
  so formed further associates with C4b2a to form the C5 convertase, C4b2a3b. AP,
  on the other hand, is constitutively active in the plasma by a mechanism called
  the “tick-over,” wherein the autohydrolysis of labile thioester bond in C3 forms
  C3(H2O). The latter binds to factor B and serine protease factor D. Factor D cleaves
  factor B into Ba and Bb and forms C3(H2O)Bb, the initial fluid-phase AP C3 convertase.
  It then cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. The C3b associates further to factor B, and
  factor D cleaves factor B into Ba and Bb and results in the formation of surface-bound
  AP C3 convertase, C3bBb, stabilized by properdin. AP C3 convertase cleaves many
  native C3 molecules into C3a and C3b to form a positive amplification loop, with
  each C3b capable of forming new AP convertases. The newly formed C3b can also bind
  to C3bBb and forms C3bBb3b, which is the AP C5 convertase. All the pathways converge
  at the terminal step where the C5 convertase cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. The C5b
  binds to the cell surface to which binds C6, C7, C8, and multiple molecules of C9,
  inserting itself into the membrane to form a multiprotein transmembrane pore called
  the membrane attack complex (MAC), which ultimately results in the lysis of the
  cell. The events in the activation cascade are regulated at various levels by a
  group of host proteins called the regulators of complement activation (RCAs). The
  regulators either can be soluble in nature (C1INH, C4BP, and FH) or are membrane-bound
  (CD55, CD46, CD35, and CD59). The regulatory proteins are highlighted within blue
  boxes. Key: CD55 (Decay accelerating factor, DAF), CD46 (Membrane cofactor protein,
  MCP), C1INH (C1 inhibitor), CD35 (Complement receptor 1, CR1), and FH (factor H).'
