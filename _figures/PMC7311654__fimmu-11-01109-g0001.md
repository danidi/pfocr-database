caption: Exploiting the hypoxia response pathway for CAR-T therapy. (A) Expanding
  CAR-T cells ex vivo under reduced oxygen concentrations (1–5% O2) might support
  the enrichment of memory-like T cells, a process mediated by S-2HG. (B) CAR expression
  can be gradually modulated by increasing levels of HIF-1α in T cells, generating
  a hypoxia-responsive CAR-T with increased CAR expression in hypoxic tumors and reduced
  CAR expression in the periphery. (C) Selection of TAAs that are upregulated under
  hypoxic conditions in solid tumors might limit off-tumor CAR-T cell activity. HIF-1α,
  Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha; S-2HG, S-2-hydroxyglutarate; TAA, tumor associated
  antigen.
