caption: Gene Regulation Pathways for siRNA, miRNA, Anti-miR, and ASO(A and B) RNAi
  pathway. (A) First, miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or III (pol
  II/III) into long (60- to 100-nt) primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) sequences with stem-loop
  structures that are further cleaved by the Drosha–DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical
  region gene 8) complex to form ∼70-nt precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) structures containing
  2-nt overhangs at their 3′ ends.,  After being transported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5,
  pre-miRNAs are processed by Dicer into mature (∼22-nt) miRNAs. (B) siRNAs can be
  obtained directly by chemical synthesis. They can also be generated from the cleavage
  of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), DsiRNA, or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) by Dicer.,  shRNA
  is transcribed by pol II from an shRNA-expressing plasmid. A chemically synthesized
  siRNA-, dsRNA-, DsiRNA-, or shRNA-expressing plasmid can be exogenously added into
  the cell. Then, mature miRNA and siRNA will be assembled into the RNA-induced silencing
  complex (RISC). RISC contains AGO (Argonaute), TRBP (HIV-1 transactivation responsive
  element [TAR] RNA-binding protein), and other proteins. The antisense (guide) strand
  of siRNA/miRNA remains in the RISC, forming activated siRISC or miRISC. Activated
  siRISC finds its target mRNA in a complete-match way, cleaves the target mRNA, and
  thus blocks its translation (A). Meanwhile, activated miRISC binds to target mRNA
  by forming a bulge sequence in the middle and inhibits its expression by either
  translation repression or mRNA cleavage (B). Translationally repressed mRNA is either
  stored in P bodies or enters the mRNA decay pathway for destruction. (C) When anti-miRs
  are added into the cell, they can specifically associate with Argonaute-bound miRNAs,
  preventing association with target mRNAs, which leads to increased expression of
  the targeted mRNAs. (D) ASOs commonly have a phosphorothioate backbone with flanks
  that are modified with 2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe) or 2′-MOE or S-cEt residues (highlighted
  in purple). Flank modifications can improve the binding affinity and nuclease resistance
  of ASOs and reduce immune stimulation of the PS backbone and do not support RNase
  H cleavage. The unmodified “gap” in a gapmer-mRNA duplex will recruit RNase H, resulting
  in degradation of duplexed mRNA.
