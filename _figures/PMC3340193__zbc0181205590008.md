caption: A scheme to explain the increased production of HA in fro/fro (NSMase2−/−)
  mouse fibroblasts. The NSMase2 gene deletion reduces Cer by 50% in fro/fro fibroblasts,
  the decreased Cer induces decreased phosphorylation and activity of PP2A, increased
  expression and phosphorylation of PI3K, PDK1, AKT, mTOR, and p70S6K leading to increased
  expression of HAS2 and synthesis of HA. Transfection of the Smpd3 gene into fro/fro
  (NSMase2−/−) fibroblasts or addition of exogenous C2-ceramide reverses the increased
  phosphorylation of Akt, and consequently the expression and production of HAS2 and
  HA is decreased. Akt and PI3K inhibitors also inhibit the production of HA by blocking
  HAS2 activation, whereas an inhibitor of NSMase2 has the reverse effect. This is
  the first time a connection between sphingolipid and glycosaminoglycan metabolic
  pathways has been made and involves regulation of the PI3K-PDK1-AKT-mTOR-p70S6K
  signaling pathway.
