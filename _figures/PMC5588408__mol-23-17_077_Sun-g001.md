caption: Canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes. A typical inflammasome contains
  a sensor protein belonging to either the NLR or ALR family of pattern recognition
  receptors, an adaptor protein ASC and pro-caspase-1. NAIP-NLRC4 is activated by
  bacterial flagellin and type III secretion system proteins, NLRP1 is activated by
  lethal toxin and muramyl dipeptide, AIM2 is activated by cytosolic dsDNA and NLRP3
  is activated by a variety of activators including ATP, uric acid, alum, β-amyloid,
  MSU and nigericin. Activation of these inflammasome complexes results in proteolytic
  cleavage of zymogen pro-caspase-1 into its enzymatically active form, which then
  leads to maturation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. In the noncanonical
  inflammasome pathway, pro-caspase-11 expression is induced by a variety of Toll-like
  receptor ligands, or via type I interferon signaling. Caspase-11 is self-oligomerized
  and activated by cytosolic LPS, which subsequently leads to caspase-1 activation,
  as well as gasdermin D–mediated pyroptotic cell death in macrophages.
