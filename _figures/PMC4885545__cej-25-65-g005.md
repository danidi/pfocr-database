caption: Possible molecular targets whereby luteolin (Lut) inhibits the invasion of
  cancer cells. Luteolin inhibits hypoxia-induced EMT, at least in part, by inhibiting
  the expression of integrin β1 and FAK. Luteolin prevents cancer cell migration by
  activating the modulator protein of cell division, Cdc42, which modulates PI3K/AKT
  activity by facilitating its degradation through the proteasomal pathway. Luteolin
  acts as a novel HGF/c-Met inhibitor by suppressing phosphorylation of c-Met tyrosine
  kinase, induced by HGF, thereby inhibiting cancer cell invasion. Because it can
  reduce AKT phosphorylation, luteolin mediates inhibition of mdm2, upregulating E-cadherin.
  Of note, downregulation of E-cadherin results in the loss of cell–cell adhesion.
  Luteolin could interfere in the PI3K–Akt–NF-κB–Snail pathway, thus attenuating TGF-β1-induced
  EMT of cancer cells. Luteolin reduces the expression of VEGF mRNA by inhibiting
  NF-κB transcription activity, thus inhibiting VEGF secretion. Furthermore, luteolin
  suppresses VEGF-A-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream
  protein kinases AKT, ERK, and mTOR, thus reducing cell viability and possibly leading
  to apoptosis. Cdc42, cycle 42; EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FASN, fatty acid synthesis;
  HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; ; mdm2, mouse double minute 2 homolog; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TGF-1, transforming growth factor-1;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
