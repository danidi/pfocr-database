caption: Overview of Raf/MEK/ERK Pathway. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is regulated by
  Ras as well as various kinases (PKC, PAK, PKA). Many kinases serve to phosphorylate
  S/T and Y residues on Raf. Some of these phosphorylation events serve to enhance
  Raf activity (black P in a white circle) whereas others serve to inhibit Raf activity
  (white P in a black circle. Moreover there are phosphatases such as PP2A, which
  remove phosphates on certain regulatory residues. The downstream transcription factors
  regulated by this pathway are indicated in diamond-shaped outlines. Raf can also
  exert effects which are independent of MEK/ERK and can interact with mitochondrial
  proteins to regulate apoptosis.
