caption: The proposed regulatory mechanism illustrating the role of hypoxic BMSC‐derived
  EVs containing miR‐328‐3p in lung cancer. miR‐328‐3p can be delivered from BMSCs
  to lung cancer cells by hypoxic BMSC‐derived EVs, thereby targeting NF2 in lung
  cancer cells. The down‐regulation of NF2 leads to the inhibition of the Hippo pathway,
  which promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of lung cancer cells
