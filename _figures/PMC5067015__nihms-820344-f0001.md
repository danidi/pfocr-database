caption: 'The RANKL/OPG system plays a critical role in regulating bone metabolism,
  the immune system, and cardiovascular disease. (1) Activation of the RANKL/RANK
  pathway is essential for normal osteoclast differentiation and activation, whereas
  OPG has also been identified as a regulator of bone formation. (2) On the other
  hand, changes in the RANKL/OPG system have also been associated with changes in
  macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes (reviewed in ), which are involved in
  systemic inflammation, osteoclastogenesis, and atherogenesis. (3) RANKL and OPG
  are found not only in bone, but also in the blood vasculature and increased RANKL:OPG
  ratio increases activity of matrix metalloproteinases leading to increased atherogenesis.
  (4) Increased ratio of circulating RANKL:OPG in the setting of systemic inflammation
  promotes osteoclastogenesis and atherogenesis. OPG: osteoprotegerin; RANK: receptor
  activator of nuclear factor kappa-B; RANKL: receptor activator of nuclear factor
  kappa-B ligand.'
