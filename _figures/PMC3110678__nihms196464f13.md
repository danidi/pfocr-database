caption: Fungal PKS-NRPSs containing the Dieckman cyclase (DKC) releasing domain.
  a Two possible product release mechanisms in cAATrp (50) formation in the CPA (49)
  biosynthetic pathway. Dieckman cyclization/releasing (pathway A) and reductive releasing/cyclization/reoxidation
  (pathway B). b Major compounds isolated from A. oryzae M-2-3 transformed to express
  tenS (52–54) or to co-express tenS and orf3 (55). c Proposed biosynthesis and production
  of aspyridones (56 and 57) after activation of the regulator in apd gene cluster
