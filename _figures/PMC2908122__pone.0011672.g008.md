caption: Both wildtype virus (wt; black) and ORF4 mutant virus (ΔORF4; grey) initially
  activate – in an ORF4-independent manner – the Akt pathway (a). After being endocytosed,
  the wt virus is able to maintain the activation of Akt in an ORF4-dependent manner
  which aids to leave the endosome rather quickly (b). In contrast, due to the lack
  of ORF4, ORF4 mutant virus is trapped much longer in the endosome and escapes with
  delay, most likely by additional, ORF4-independent mechanisms (c).
