caption: Regulation of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90A) function by arginine methylation
  of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) via the N‐myc downstream‐regulated
  gene 2 (NDRG2)/protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex (NDRG2/PP2A). Heat shock protein
  (HSP) 90, an ATP‐dependent molecular chaperone, is essential for oncogenic transformation
  through supporting a wide variety of activated oncoproteins, kinases, transcription
  factors and others. Although the activity of HSP90 is regulated by many protein
  modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, we first reported a mechanism
  for the activity regulation of HSP90 by arginine methylation through PRMT5. Moreover,
  the NDRG2/PP2A complex regulates the arginine methyltransferase activity of PRMT5
  by its phosphorylation status. (A) In normal cells, the NDRG2/PP2A complex dephosphorylates
  PRMT5 and unphosphorylated PRMT5 is mainly localized to the nucleus and leads to
  arginine methylation of histones; however, cytoplasmic PRMT5 cannot catalyze the
  arginine residues in HSP90. (B) In adult T‐cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) or other
  cancer cells with low expression of NDRG2, PRMT5 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm
  and is highly phosphorylated by the downregulation of NDRG2, and induces the methylation
  of HSP90A arginine residues, leading to the enhancement of its chaperone activity
  (AHA1 and p23) and stabilization of client proteins, including AKT, NF‐κB essential
  modulator (NEMO) or others, contributing to enhanced cell growth and anti‐apoptosis.
  In the right half of the figure, knocking down PRMT5 expression in NDRG2‐deficient
  tumors induces cell apoptosis via the reduction of HSP90A function and the degradation
  of client proteins via activation of the ubiquitin‐proteasome pathway, suggesting
  that enzymatic inhibition of PRMT5 is a potential therapeutic target because it
  causes synthetic lethality in NDRG2‐deficient cancer or ATLL cells. This figure
