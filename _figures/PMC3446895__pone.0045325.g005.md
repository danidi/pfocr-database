caption: An overview of the intestinal epithelial lining is given in B, with a villus
  and a crypt being depicted. Proliferating cells in the crypts migrate towards the
  tip of the villus, undergoing differentiation, and are shed at the tip of the villus
  after cell death. Giardia trophozoites sit all along the epithelial surface (with
  exception of the Paneth cells that are most down in the crypts) . A trophozoite
  attached to an IEC is shown in A. Dotted lines indicate molelcules released by the
  trophozoite. Arginine is actively taken up by the parasite and converted into CO2,
  NH3 and ornithine along the dihydrolase pathway, indicated by the enzymes ADI (arginine
  deiminase), OCT (ornithine carbamoyl transferase) and CK (carbamate kinase). Ornithine
  is released via an arginine-ornithine antiporter, blocks the cationic amino acid
  transporters (CAT) of IECs and thereby uptake of arginine. In addition, arginine
  is degraded extracellular by ADI and OCT released from Giardia upon interaction.
  All this leads to reduced arginine availability within the host IEC. As shown within
  this study, the consequences are reduced polyamine levels in IECs that result in
  cell cycle arrest via upregulation of cell cycle block genes (GADD45A, BTG3). This
  reduced cell proliferation in the crypts could lower intestinal cell turnover and
  reduce cell differentiation along the villus-axis, allowing the parasite to live
  in a more stable environment. The reduced arginine availability in IECs also leads
  to decreased production of the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (NO) via nitric
  oxide synthases (NOS) in all cells of the intestinal epithelial lining.
