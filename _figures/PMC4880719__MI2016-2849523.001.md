caption: 'Model of the IL-2R signalling pathway. Zhou et al. [] propose the model
  as follows: (a) the first molecule activated is JAK3 and the next molecule in the
  pathway is JAK1; Syk functions as a downstream element of the JAKs in IL-2 signalling.
  JAK3 may regulate Syk and STAT activity indirectly via JAK1. Our model proposed
  for cervical cancer cells is shown in (b). The crossed arrows represent the steps
  that are not performed in cervical cancer cells but appear in the normal cell model.
  The rectangle shows a step that is not found in the normal cell model.'
