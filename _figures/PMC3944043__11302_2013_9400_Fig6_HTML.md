caption: 'Potential effects of renal ectonucleotidases and consequences for activation
  of purinoceptor subtypes. The major enzymes involved in each degradative pathway
  are shown in bold print; for more details, see text. The information given in the
  figure indicates the relative potencies of ATP and ADP with respect to P2X and P2Y
  receptor subtypes. At sufficiently high concentrations, ATP can activate all P2
  receptors other than P2Y6 and P2Y14. It is important to note that nucleotides derived
  from other bases are also hydrolysed/synthesised by these enzymes, but have been
  omitted for clarity. Uracil-based nucleotides are particularly significant: UTP
  is a potent agonist of P2Y2 and P2Y4 subtypes, and its dinucleotide derivative UDP
  is the major naturally occurring agonist of the P2Y6 subtype. The mechanism(s) of
  ATP exit from renal cells has/have not been defined. NDP nucleoside diphosphate,
  NTP nucleoside triphosphate (reproduced from [], with permission from Springer)'
