caption: The biosynthetic pathway of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. In sorghum,
  the pathway is catalyzed by CYP79A1 and CYP71E1, two multifunctional membrane-bound
  P450s, and by a soluble UDPG-glucosyltransferase. The glucosylated intermediates
  and metabolites that are detected in transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco expressing
  one or both P450s are indicated. The retention time (rt) of the TMS derivatives
  observed upon GC analysis is shown below each structure.
