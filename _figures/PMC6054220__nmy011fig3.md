caption: Amino acid signals mediate the mTORC1 pathway and autophagy. Amino acids
  control the metabolic status of cells via the mTORC1 pathway. Withdrawal of amino
  acids will eliminate mTORC1 activity, which will trigger autophagy. Arginine, leucine,
  and glutamine are 3 amino acids that strongly regulate mTORC1 and autophagy through
  different pathways. Arginine can bind to CASTOR1 homodimer, which will cause CASTOR1
  to be released from the GATOR2 complex to activate the GATOR2 complex. The activated
  GATOR2 will inhibit the GATOR1 complex, which will activate mTORC1. Leucine activates
  mTORC1 by activating the GATOR2 complex via inhibition of Sestrin associated with
  GATOR2. Glutamine has a different way to activate mTORC1, via ARF1 other than GATOR2/Rag
  GTPase and Ragulator. ARF1, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-1 GTPase;
  CASTOR1, cellular arginine sensor for mTORC1; GATOR, GTPase activating proteins
  toward Rags; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3; mTORC1, mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; SLC, solute
  carrier; V-ATPase, vacuolar type H+-ATPase.
