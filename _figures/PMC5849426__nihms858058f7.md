caption: Putative model illustrating the interplay between RANK/NFκB-dependent and
  Hdac3-dependent control of mTEC development. Hdac3 and NFκB together are necessary
  for induction of the mTEC-specific transcriptional program; however, Hdac3 is also
  needed for the repression of the early TEC and cTEC programs, including the Notch
  signaling pathway. Upregulation of Hdac3 by the Notch pathway serves as a negative
  feedback loop likely controlling the duration and the intensity of Notch signaling
  in TEC progenitors.
