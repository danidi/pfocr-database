caption: 'Simplified biosynthetic pathway from β-carotene to orobanchol. The steps
  from β-carotene to carlactone are believed to require only three enzymes: one isomerase
  and two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, all of which are found in the plastid.
  The subsequent conversion to strigolactones such as orobanchol is less well understood
  but apparently occurs outside the plastid and requires a cytochrome P450 enzyme.'
