caption: 'Pathway analysis of 43 genes differentially expressed in HFBUTTER (HFB)
  vs. CTL groups. The major networks involved are estradiol, progesterone, ERK/MAPK,
  NFk-B, VEGF, and ubiquitin (Ub) C signaling. Ingenuity pathway analysis shows the
  most significant gene networks of the HFB group. A, estradiol and progesterone network:
  11 genes were mapped principally to this network as distinct node. B, ERK, NFk-B,
  and VEGF network: 16 genes were mapped to these networks as a distinct node. C,
  Ub network: 13 genes were mapped to a network with Ub as a central node. The intensity
  of the node color indicates the degree of up- or downregulation. Genes in uncolored
  nodes were not identified as differentially expressed in our array experiments and
  were incorporated into individual networks on the basis of the IPA knowledge database,
  indicating a relevance to this network.'
