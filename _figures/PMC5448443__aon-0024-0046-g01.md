caption: Amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing of the APP. The top part of
  the figure shows the 2 main paths in the processing of APP, the most important elements
  involved, and the main alterations associated with the amyloidogenic pathway of
  APP. The bottom part of the figure shows potential modulators of the secretase activity
  (activation of receptors, growth factors, cytokines, hormones). α, α-secretase activity;
  β, β-secretase activity; γ, γ-secretase activity; BACE1, β-site – APP – cleaving
  enzyme 1; βA, amyloid β peptide; ADAM, α-secretase; APPsα and APPsβ, soluble portions
  produced by the effect of α- and β-secretase; C83, fragment of 83 amino acids of
  the carboxyl terminal portion produced by the effect of α-secretase; C99, fragment
  of 99 amino acids of the carboxyl terminal portion produced by effect of β-secretase;
  p3, peptide resulting from γ-secretase; AICD, carboxy-terminal fragment referred
  to as the intracellular domain of APP; T, Tau protein; mAChRs, muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptors; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptors; 5HT, serotonin receptors; CRHR1,
  receptor 1 of the corticotropin-releasing hormone; PAC1R, receptor 1 of pituitary
  adenylate cyclase; FGF, EGF, NGF, growth factors of fibroblasts, epidermis and the
  nervous system respectively; DOR, opioid receptor δ; A2AR, adenosine receptor 2A;
  β2-AR, β2 adrenergic receptor; GPR3, receptor 3 coupled to protein G; CXCR2, chemokine
  receptor 2.
