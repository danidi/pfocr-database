caption: Regulation of (p)ppGpp metabolism in γ-proteobacteria. (A) Synthetase activity
  of RelA is triggered by uncharged tRNA in the ribosomal A-site upon amino acid starvation
  or after intoxication by the HipA toxin. (B) Upon nitrogen starvation (i.e. glutamine
  deprivation), the GlnD pathway is activated and promotes the phosphorylation of
  the σ54-dependent response regulator regulator NtrC, which, in turn, enhances relA
  transcription. (C) The Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) is a fatty acid sensor that binds
  the TGS domain of SpoT and stimulates its synthetase activity according to the fatty
  acid status of the cell. (D) Rsd and CgtA regulate the hydrolase activity of SpoT.
  Whereas Rsd induces the hydrolase activity of SpoT during carbon downshift in a
  phosphotransferase system-dependent (PTS-dependent) manner, CgtA stimulates (p)ppGpp
  hydrolysis in nutrient-rich environments. In each figure, solid and dashed lines,
  respectively, indicate direct and indirect processes. Red and blue lines represent
  stressful and non-stressful conditions, respectively.
