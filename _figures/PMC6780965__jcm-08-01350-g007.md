caption: Graphical abstract of TSLP function during sepsis. Production of TSLP is
  induced via the MDM2/NF-κB signaling pathway in E. coli-stimulated macrophages.
  TSLP affects inflammatory cytokines production and organ dysfunction during sepsis.
  Cisplatin protects mice against lethal sepsis by inhibiting the series of reactions.
  TSLP can be induced directly by E. coli or other proinflammatory stimuli. Multiple
  cell types such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and T cells
  might be involved in sepsis.
