caption: The alternative pathway of Aβ biogenesis in Alzheimer’s disease. At the top,
  exon sequences containing circAβ-a and Aβ peptides (in red) are aligned with the
  full-length APP gene (not drawn to scale). On the left, linear APP mRNA transcribed
  from the APP gene locus undergoes the canonical splicing pathway before being translated
  into full-length APP protein. Proteolytic processing of APP protein generates Aβ
  peptides (e.g., Aβ40, Aβ42, in red color), which may play causative roles in the
  AD pathology. On the right, circAβ-a is synthesized by back-splicing of the APP
  gene. The open reading frame (ORF) is in blue, with the Aβ sequence in red. The
  presumed translational start codon is depicted by a green arrow and the stop codon
  by a black bar. Translation of circAβ-a produces Aβ-related peptide (Aβ175), which
  is further processed to form Aβ peptides.
