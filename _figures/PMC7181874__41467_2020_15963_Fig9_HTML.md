caption: Circulating ApoJ is dominantly produced by the liver. Liver-derived ApoJ
  then transports to skeletal muscle where it binds to its receptor LRP2 on the cell
  surface, leading to increased molecular interaction between LRP2 and IR. The complexes
  of LRP2 with the IR then undergo co-endocytosis, which is an essential step of insulin
  signaling in skeletal muscle. As a result, downstream signaling components activate,
  leading to enhanced glucose transport system activity. Thus, the ApoJ → LRP2 signaling
  pathway is central in regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling.
