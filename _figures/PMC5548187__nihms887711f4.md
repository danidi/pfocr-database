caption: Two proposed models permitting TERT immortalization of PrECs. In Model A,
  a subset of PrECs activates the p16/RB pathway in response to tissue culturing.
  The remaining proliferating cells eventually undergo replicative senescence due
  to activation of the p53 pathway in response to critical telomere shortening. Introduction
  of TERT to early passage PrECs prior to stasis immortalizes the subset of cells
  that would have otherwise undergone replicative senescence. In Model B, all cells
  senesce by activating either the p16/Rb pathway or the p53 pathway. Introduction
  of TERT to early passage PrECs allows cells to bypass both stasis and replicative
  senescence.
