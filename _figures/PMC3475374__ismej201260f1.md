caption: 'Conceptual schematic of M. maripaludis and D. vulgaris syntrophic interaction,
  highlighting the central energy-generating and -consuming the pathways of the methanogen.
  Relative changes () in transcript abundance during syntrophic growth are indicated
  by red (increase) and green (decrease) coloration. Blue coloration indicates no
  statistically significant change as specified in the Materials and methods section.
  Hydrogen-limited monocultures served as the control growth condition. Oxidation
  of formate to CO2 and H2 coupled with coenzyme F420-reduction (not depicted) is
  catalyzed by two alternative formate dehydrogenases, Fdh1 and Fdh2. One of two membrane-bound
  energy-conserving hydrogenases (Eha and Ehb) couple the chemiosmotic energy of ion
  gradients to H2 oxidation and ferredoxin reduction. Of these, Ehb generates the
  low potential electron carrier used for anabolism, whereas Eha is hypothesized to
  function primarily in the energy-generating methanogenesis pathway, generating low
  potential-reducing equivalents for the reduction of CO2 to formylmethanofuran ().
  Two different formylmethanofuran dehydrogenases catalyze this first step in methanogenesis,
  tungsten (Fwd) and molybdenum (Fmd) forms. Transfer of the formyl group from methanofuran
  to methanopterin by Ftr and subsequent elimination of H2O by Mch yields methenyl-H4-methanopterin.
  Two different enzymes can then reduce methenyl-H4-MPT to methylene-H4MPT, one (Mtd)
  using H2 as reductant and the other (Hmd) using reduced coenzyme F420. M. maripaludis
  has an Hmd paralog of unknown function (Mmp1716, HmdII) that may also function in
  this step (). Reduction of methylene-H4MPT by another F420-dependent reductase (Mer)
  yields methyl-H4MPT. The reduced coenzyme F420 required for the formation of methyl-H4MPT
  by these two steps is generated by one of two alternative F420-reducting hydrogenase
  (Fru and Frc). The final steps to methane production are catalyzed by a methyl transferase
  (Mtr) and a reductase (Mcr) coupled to two forms of a F420-nonreducing hydrogenase
  (Vhu and Vhc). The mixed disulfide (CoM-CoB) produced by reduction of methyl coenzyme
  M is then reduced by one of two forms of the heterodisulfide reductase determined
  by the composition of the HdrA subunit (HdrAU or HdrAV). Fdh/ Hdr/Vhu/ Fwd are reported
  to have protein–protein interactions (). (Note: The interaction with Fwd could not
  be depicted here without compromising the clarity of the figure. Vhc is not part
  of this interaction). Other reactions include the transport of alanine (AlsT), and
  subsequent coversion to pyruvate via an alanine racemase (Alr) and dehydrogenase
  (Ald). Additional M. maripaludis proteins shown: pyruvate oxidoreductase, acetyl-CoA
  decarbonylase/synthase. The D. vulgaris metabolic pathway is based upon results
  as described in  and is updated to include an unspecified sodium/alanine transporter
  (Na+/ala sym). Other D. vulgaris proteins shown: lactate permease (lac per), lactate
  deydrogenase (ldh), membrane-bound Coo hydrogenase (Coo), high-molecular weight
  cytochrome (Hmc), periplasmic hydrogenases (Hyd and Hyn), cytochrome c3 (Cyt c3)
  and oxidized and reduced ferredoxin (Fd).'
