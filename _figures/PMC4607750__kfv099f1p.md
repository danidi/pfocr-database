caption: 'Schematic showing the main connections of the basal ganglia with a special
  emphasis on the SNpc and VTA midbrain nuclei. The major basal ganglia pathways consist
  of (1) the corticostriatal and thalamostriatal glutamatergic projections to the
  striatum, (2) the “direct” pathway: GABAergic afferents from the striatum that directly
  innervate the basal ganglia output nuclei, (3) the “indirect” pathway: striatal
  GABAergic afferents that indirectly innervate the output nuclei via the GPe and
  STN, (4) the GABAergic innervation of the thalamus by the GPi and SNr, and (5) the
  dopaminergic and GABAergic projections from the SNpc and VTA to the dorsal and ventral
  striatum, respectively. Note that for simplicity some connections are not depicted
  in this figure, and many of the illustrated nuclei share reciprocal connections.
  Line thickness indicates degree of connectivity between two brain structures. Abbreviations:
  GABA, γ-Aminobutyric acid; GPe, external segment of the globus pallidus; GPi, internal
  segment of the globus pallidus; SNpc, substantia nigra pars compacta; SNr, substantia
  nigra pars reticulata; STN, subthalamic nucleus; VP, ventral pallidum. See , , and  for
  more details.'
