caption: PE intoxication pathway. Native PE can be divided into two fragments with
  functions of receptor binding (B) and catalytic activity (A). After secretion into
  the extracellular environment, PE is cleaved by a carboxypeptidase (1) to remove
  the C-terminal lysine residue and expose the ER localization signal (REDL). The
  B fragment subsequently recognizes its cell-surface receptor, LRP1 or LRP1B (2),
  and is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits (3).
  Within the endocytic pathway, PE encounters the endoprotease furin, which cleaves
  at a site in domain II and separates the polypeptide backbone between the A and
  B fragments (4). A disulfide bond preserves a covalent linkage between the two fragments.
  While in the endocytic pathway, PE can either follow a productive trafficking route
  to the Golgi (5b) or continue to the lysosome for terminal degradation (5a). In
  the Golgi, PE encounters KDEL receptors that recognize the REDL C-terminal signal
  and transport PE to the ER in a retrograde manner (6). At an undetermined point
  in the pathway, possibly by PDI in the ER, the disulfide bond connecting the A and
  B fragments is reduced and the two fragments separate (7). The A fragment is subsequently
  transported into the cytosol (8), possibly by exploiting the ERAD pathway through
  the Sec61 translocon. In the cytosol PE transfers an ADP-ribosyl (ADPr) group from
  NAD+ to the diphthamide residue of eEF2 (9). This halts protein synthesis (10) and
  ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death (11). RITs based on PE (I) target tumor-associated
  cell surface receptors for internalization (II), and are generally thought to undergo
  an intoxication pathway similar to that of PE (III).
