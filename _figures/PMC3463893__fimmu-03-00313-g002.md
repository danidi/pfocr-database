caption: Schematic representation of the inductive and effector sites for the mucosal
  B-cell response in CD. Through yet unknown mechanisms, gluten peptides (GP) cross
  the epithelium and become deamidated gluten peptides (DGP) by the action of transglutaminase
  2 (TG2). These peptides are then transported, possibly by dendritic cells, to local
  lymphoid tissue structures where a strong, proinflammatory T cell response takes
  place. Some native peptides may reach the lymphoid tissue and may become targeted
  by TG2 there. In lymphoid tissues TG2-specific B cells likely interact with gluten-specific
  T cells, according to the hapten-carrier-like model described in the text which
  builds on the ability of TG2 to form TG2-GP/DGP complexes. The B cell response generated
  follows either a canonical germinal center (GC) pathway or an extrafollicular pathway,
  resulting in massive plasmablast generation. The plasmablasts migrate via the blood
  to the lamina propria, where they mature as plasma cells (PC), secrete antibodies
  (Abs) and survive for extended time in what is called a PC survival niche. In active
  CD, this results in plasmacytosis and sustained secretion of IgA dimers (dIgA) –
  as well as IgM pentamers – which are transported across the epithelium to the lumen
  as secretory IgA (sIgA). TG2-specific antibodies produced at this site are also
  deposited on the subepithelial layer of TG2. BCR, B cell receptor; FDC, follicular
  dendritic cell; TCR, T cell receptor.
