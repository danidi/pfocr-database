caption: The multifaceted roles of ER stress responses in myeloid cells. ER stress
  mediators play an important role in modulating development and function of innate
  immune cells. Immature dendritic cells (in light blue) require IRE1/XBP1 activation
  in order to differentiate in mature DCs. Mature DCs, upon encountering DAMPs and
  PAMPs activate PERK/CHOP pathway to accomplish a full activation and the release
  of IL-23. In macrophages IRE1/XBP1 promotes activation of proinflammatory IL-6 and
  TNF. However, in disease context, excessive activation of ER stress upon lipid accumulation
  lead to the formation of foam cells, cell death and impaired resolutive response.
  In neutrophils, activation of ER stress is associated with increased cell death
  during development and upon tissue damage. In the context of hyperinsulinemia, mast
  cells accumulate lipid bodies that cause ER stress response IRE1/XBP1, which results
  in inhibition of degranulation. Eosinophil precursor (EoP) constitutively activate
  XBP1 in order to give rise to mature eosinophils.
