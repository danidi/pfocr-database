caption: A schematic representation of the Wnt pathway in off (A) and on (B) conformations
  and the non-canonical Wnt pathway (C). (A) In the absence of Wnt ligand, the destruction
  complex forms in the cytoplasm bringing together APC and Axin, and presenting β-catenin
  for phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3. Phosphorylated β-catenin is ubiquitylated and
  degraded by the proteasome, and does not enter the nucleus where gene expression
  is repressed by TCF in complex with the repressor Groucho/TLE; (B) Upon Wnt ligand
  binding, the activation complex forms at the membrane where the kinase activity
  of CK1 and GSK3 is redirected toward LRP5/6 in complex with Axin and Dsh. β-catenin
  is no longer phosphorylated, enters the nucleus, and takes part in transcription
  along with TCF; (C) The non-canonical Wnt pathway uses a variety of transmembrane
  proteins like Ror to affect cellular polarity both within the plane of the tissue
  (PCP) or even within the cell (apico-basal polarity). Figure was adapted from Schlesinger
  et al. [].
