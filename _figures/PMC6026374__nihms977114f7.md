caption: (A) Early stage axon behavior and neurotrophic signaling during sympathetic
  neuron development. Diagram depicts sympathetic neuron growing along intermediate
  target (e.g. blood vessel) en route to final target (e.g. heart). NT3-TrkA signals
  through RAS/MAPK, PI3K, and GSK3β to control axon growth and branching.(B) Middle
  stage axon behavior and neurotrophic signaling during sympathetic neuron development.
  The growing axon has reached its final target and is exposed to target-derived NGF.
  NGF-TrkA results in the expression of Coronin-1 in the sympathetic neuron.(C) Late
  stage axon behavior and neurotrophic signaling during sympathetic neuron development.
  NT3-TrkA still activates RAS/MAPK and PI3K, but these pathways are uncoupled from
  axon growth and branching. NT3-TrkA activates P-GSK3β through an unknown pathway
  to control axon growth. NGF-TrkA-Coronin-1 signaling slows axonal growth and causes
  innervation of the final target.(D) Role of NT3 and NGF in the developmental stages
  of sympathetic axon projection and innervation of final target. Comparison of pathways
  involved in axon growth and branching examined here and in .
