caption: Potential mechanisms of nicotine plus HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in obese
  mice. Nicotine plus a HFD promotes abdominal lipolysis, resulting in free fatty
  acid (FAA) release from adipose tissue into the circulation, thereby contributing
  to the buildup of lipids as triglyceride in the liver. In addition, nicotine plus
  a HFD may also promote de novo lipogenesis through inactivation of AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) and activation of its downstream target acetyl-coenzyme A-carboxylase
  (ACC), leading to the development of hepatic steatosis. Inactivation of AMPK can
  also stimulate lipogenesis through upregulation of key genes in the lipogenic pathway,
  such as fatty acid synthase (FAS) and ACC, by activating the transcription factor
  sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 c (SREBP-1c). Intrahepatic lipid accumulation
  can also trigger hepatocellular apoptosis through generation of oxidative stress
  coupled with activation of c-Jun NH2-termina kinase (JNK)-mediated apoptotic signaling.
  AMPK inactivation could further sensitize liver cells to nicotine plus HFD-induced
  apoptosis. There is also growing evidence that chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress
  through regulation of several pathways leading to oxidative stress, inflammation,
  perturbed hepatic lipid homeostasis, apoptosis, and autophagy, can also induce hepatic
  steatosis and its progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Evidence also suggests
  a central role of the gut microbiota in obesity and its related disorders, including
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is possible nicotine plus a HFD through
  changes in short-chain fatty acids metabolism, increased intestinal permeability
  and lipopolysaccharides activation of Toll-like receptors and inflammasomes, endogenous
  ethanol production, decreased choline availability and increased trimethylamine
  (TAM) production could cause NAFLD. The multiple mechanisms of nicotine and obesity-induced
  hepatic steatosis can results from both its nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated
  and non-receptor effects.
