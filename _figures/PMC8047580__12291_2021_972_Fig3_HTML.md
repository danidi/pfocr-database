caption: The hypothetical explanation of crucial mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection
  supported hypoxia which is accountable for the induction of coagulation cascade - a
  Due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the alveoli of lungs, the phenomenon of oxygen exchange
  becomes disturbed due to deposition of proteinaceous liquid and fluid in the alveoli
  and interstitial space respectively and the capillaries become leaky. The resulting
  condition causes the deprivation of an adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level,
  generally known as hypoxia, b. the alveolar hypoxia signal is propagated retrogradely
  along the vascular endothelium and thereby also conveys its damaging effects on
  vasculature directly by activation of varied signalling cascades, c. In the endothelial
  cell, hyoxia as a stress signal induces major molecular sensors, mainly HIF-1 by
  activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway which subsequently causes recruitment of HIF-1
  α and β in complex with CBP and p300 transcriptional coactivators to the nucleus,
  d. Further, HIF-1 α and β in complex with CBP and p300 binds to the region of HRE
  and thereby enhance the gene expression of HIF-1, e. the activated HIF-1 in the
  endothelial cells mediates TLR3 signalling through eRNAs as ligands which causes
  the nuclear translocation of transcription factors, namely, NF-κB and AP-1, e. the
  stimulation of TLR3/TRIF signalling pathway causes the activation of NF-κB, f. Consecutively,
  TLR3/TRAF6/TAK signalling cascade also supports AP-1 induction, g. All together,
  these signalling mechanisms may affect coagulation cascade, for example, HIF-1 prompts
  neutrophil activation which in turn, form NETs via PAD4-mediated histone citrullination
  responsible for inducing a strong coagulatory response, h. HIF-1 augments endothelial
  adhesion to fibrinogen via integrins which induces platelet activation and aggregation,
  essential for thrombosis, i. Moreover, activated HIF-1 upregulates the expression
  of TF and thereby, leads to TF dependent coagulation pathway. At the same time,
  HIF-1α also inhibits thrombomodulin-protein C, an anticoagulant system in addition
  to plasminogen activator of fibrinolysis. Subsequently, this contributes to enhance
  the pro-coagulant activity of endothelial cells, j. Likewise, HIF-1 induced both
  NF-κB and AP-1 also facilitates TF dependent (extrinsic) coagulation pathway dependable
  for clot formation. The dashed arrow( ) designates mechanistic pathway undergo through
