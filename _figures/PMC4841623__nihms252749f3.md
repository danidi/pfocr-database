caption: A. In wild type, putative EGF-binding proteins HPA-1 and HPA-2 function as
  negative regulators (possibly sequestering EGF ligand) to inhibit LIN-3/EGF LET-23/EGFR
  signal transduction, conferring the wild-type aging rate.B. When HPA-1 or HPA-2
  are knocked down or absent, EGF signaling through EGFR is increased, activating
  downstream phospholipase Cγ and IP3 receptor (more ER calcium release) to promote
  extended healthspan and lifespan. Note that HPA-1 knockdown impacts all assays of
  animal healthspan, whereas HPA-2 exerts its effect primarily on locomotory healthspan.
