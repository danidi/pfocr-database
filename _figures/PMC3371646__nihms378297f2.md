caption: Multicompartment model for receptor signaling. Early endosome (EE) vesicles
  can form from the cell membrane. EE vesicles can be of two types, smooth and coated
  pit, with different receptor complex internalization characteristics. Smooth and
  coated pit EE vesicles also have different trafficking dynamic rates. These vesicles
  can either recycle back to the plasma membrane or merge into the sorting endosome,
  which regulates the eventual protein degradation process through the lysosome pathway.
  The number of EE vesicles changes in time according to the system dynamics. Each
  compartment is represented with its own receptor signaling network, which is essentially
  a more complex version of the example given in . Further details can be found in
  , ).
