caption: An integrated view of therapeutic strategies targeting the transcriptional
  network and signaling pathways promoting neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis. Diagrammed
  are the anterograde and retrograde signaling crosstalks between the nucleus (blue)
  and mitochondria (orange). The OXPHOS system is depicted with green circles, while
  wild type and mutated mtDNA molecules are illustrated with blue and red circles,
  respectively. The signaling and transcriptional cascades are limited to the PGC-1α-NRF-1-NRF-2
  axis, given its important regulatory role for neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis.
  Pharmacological manipulations of key regulators for mitochondrial biogenesis and
  bioenergetics are illustrated in blue in the diagrammatic summary. PGC-1α expression
  can be pharmacologically enhanced by bezafibrate, an agonist of PPARα, which leads
  to increased expression of the NRF-1 and NRF-2 genes. In addition, PGC-1α directly
  stimulates the transcriptional activity of the NRF-1 and NRF-2 transcription factors
  via protein-protein interactions. Consequently, PGC-1α-mediated increased expression
  levels and activity of NRF-1 and NRF-2 lead to stimulation of gene expression relevant
  to mtDNA replication via the TFAM protein, OXPHOS activity (ETC), import of nuclear-encoded
  proteins, the mitochondrial translation machinery, and diverse mitochondrial and
  cellular metabolic pathways. The major retrograde signaling pathway is under the
  control of the AMP/ATP ratio, which augments upon decreased ATP levels. Increased
  AMP/ATP ratio activates AMPK, which subsequently phosphorylates the PGC-1α protein.
  In neuronal cells, activation of AMPK is also under the control of the LKB1 and
  CAMMKβ kinase. Phosphorylated PGC-1α migrates to the nucleus, where it stimulates
  the expression levels of the NRF-1 and NRF-2 genes as well as their transcriptional
  activities. In a neuronal context, AMPK activity can be modulated via several pharmacological
  means, such as AICAR, resveratrol, and metformin, which are depicted in blue in
  the diagrammatic summary. AMPK also influences the activity of the NAD+-dependent
  deacetylase SIRT1 via fatty acid oxidation (FAO), resulting in increased NAD+ levels.
  Subsequently, SIRT1 is activated via phosphorylation, which can occur independently
  of AMPK upon increase of the NAD+/NADH ratio. Isoflavones and the pharmacological
  agent SRT1720 also activate SIRT1, which in turn deacetylate PGC-1α, thereby linking
  the cellular metabolic status to a network of gene expression relevant for mitochondrial
  biogenesis.
