caption: 'Characterization of network connectivity between highly expressed interferon
  (IFN) response genes. As shown by the lines connecting individual genes, a network
  of highly correlated genes is expressed in the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  cohorts, the majority of which have been identified previously as IFN response genes.
  There is, however, substantially greater complexity of the IFN network than has
  been previously described (for additional information, see Patients and Methods,
  and Supplementary Material, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at
  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39950/abstract). Briefly, the Weighted
  correlation network analysis module (“Yellow module”) containing this network is
  correlated with all 3 clinical end points: (IFN signature [ρ = 0.90, P < 2 × 10−308],
  Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment version of the SLE
  Disease Activity Index [ρ = 0.22, P = 5 × 10−21], anti‐DNA activity [ρ = 0.32, P = 4
  × 10−43]) (see Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 3, available on the
  Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39950/abstract)
  and is enriched for the MetaCore‐defined SLE disease pathway (P = 1.14 × 10−32 by
  hypergeometric test) and the gene ontology (GO) “response to type I interferon”
  gene set (GO:0034340 [P = 6.60 × 10−36]) (see Supplementary Figure 1, available
  on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39950/abstract).'
