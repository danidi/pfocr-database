caption: (1) The role of the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway in antioxidative stress related
  to radio- and chemoresistance. Phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), which subsequently recruits and activates protein kinase B (PKB/AKT). However,
  these processes can be inhibited by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which
  dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2. As radiation and chemotherapy continuously generate
  ROS via the redox reaction of water and direct production of ROS, respectively,
  increased intracellular ROS activate the PI3K-AKT pathway by directly promoting
  PI3K and AKT and inhibiting PTEN. PI3K-AKT signalling serves as defence against
  ROS by promoting NADPH production. Activated AKT regulates NADPH metabolism in direct
  and indirect ways via NAD+ kinase (NADK) and rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), respectively.
  NADK is the unique cytosolic enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of NAD+ to
  NADP+, enlarging the size of the NADP+ and NADPH pool. Downstream of mTORC1, sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) stimulates the expression of G6PD, 6PGD,
  IDH1, and ME, reducing NADP+ to NADPH. (2) The loop formed between AKT and Nrf2.
  Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) act
  as a linker to connect AKT with Nrf2. PI3K-AKT signalling inhibits the Keap1-independent
  degradation of Nrf2 by phosphorylating GSK3. Activated Nrf2 translocates to the
  nucleus and upregulates the transcription of PDGF, binding with its cognate receptors
  to stimulate AKT.
