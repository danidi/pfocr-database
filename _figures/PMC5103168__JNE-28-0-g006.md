caption: 'Top significant network generated by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showing
  the the down‐regulated genes (green) and up‐regulated genes (red) in the hippocampus
  (score: 39) in response to the overall and cumulative effects of pre‐ and post‐natal
  exposure to B regardless of timing (gene lists obtained by vector analysis, behavioural
  categories I and II combined together). The network is displayed with nodes (i.e.
  genes) and edges (i.e. biological interactions among nodes); in white, the not user‐specific
  genes added into the network as a result of interactions with the submitted (i.e.
  user‐specific) genes. Solid lines connecting the genes indicate direct interactions
  between the nodes and dashed lines implied indirect interactions.'
