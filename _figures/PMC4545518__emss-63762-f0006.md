caption: Simplified schematic of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. (A) The EGF-repeat
  domain of Notch is known to be glycosylated by EOGT in mammalian cells. Activation
  of the Notch signaling cascade is initiated by the binding of one of five ligands
  through direct contact of adjacent cells. (B) Ligand activation leads to cleavage
  and release of NICD, which translocates to the nucleus to form an active transcriptional
  complex with RBPJ, mastermind (MAML) and transcriptional co-activators (CoA). (C)
  In the absence of Notch activation, RBPJ complexes with co-repressor proteins (CoR)
  to repress transcription of downstream genes. Mutations in EOGT and RBPJ have previously
  been identified in AOS.
