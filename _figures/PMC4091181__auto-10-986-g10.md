caption: Figure 10. GABARAPL1 function in breast cancer cells. Our studies indicate
  that GABARAPL1 plays an important role in autophagic flux, mitochondrial homeostasis,
  metabolic programming, and control of cell proliferation in breast cancer MDA-MB-436
  cells. GABARAPL1 knockdown induces a disruption of the autophagosome-lysosome pathway
  leading to a decrease of lysosome number and accumulation of damaged mitochondria,
  increased mitochondrial biogenesis and number, and increased mitochondrial respiration,
  mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial proteins, and mtDNA damage. This
  is further evidenced by an increase of HNE-protein adducts, increased antioxidant
  response, and increased ATP levels. The increase of mitochondrial number, cellular
  glutathione, and cellular ATP may contribute to resistance to cell death and increased
  proliferation.
