caption: Schematic representation of the possible molecular mechanisms of AMR-Me-mediated
  chemoprevention of experimental mammary carcinogenesis. DMBA activates NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which in turn, results in elevated expression of target genes, including
  COX-2, Bcl-2 and cyclin D1. Activation of all these molecular pathways contributes
  to sustained inflammation, accelerated proliferation, and evasion of apoptosis which
  consequently lead to the development of mammary tumor. AMR-Me blocks activated NF-κB
  signaling cascade and thereby facilitates suppression of subsequent cellular events,
  including anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and apoptosis-inducing effects,
  contributing to chemoprevention of mammary tumorigenesis. ↓, activation and ⊥, downregulation.
