caption: Activation of the transcription factor CREB by the NMDA signal transduction
  pathway. Activation of NMDA receptors causes Ca2 + influx (A). Ca2 + interacts with
  kinases and phosphatases that act as messengers in signal transduction pathways.
  Kinases and phosphatases alter the phosphorylation patterns of TFs and, thus, influence
  their ability to stimulate the synthesis of mRNA. For example, CaM kinases, activated
  by Ca2 +, can translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate the TF CREB (; ; ). Phosphorylated
  CREB stimulates the synthesis of many different mRNAs, which are translated into
  proteins. These proteins alter neuronal properties and contribute to memory formation
  and synaptic strength. For instance, the newly synthesized proteins are incorporated
  into synapses. An active synapse can increase in size, and may even split into two
  synapses (B). An inactive synapse can decrease in size and may be even disassembled
  (C). PSD, postsynaptic density.
