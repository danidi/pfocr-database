caption: Notch receptors at the surface of the signal-receiving cell bind ligands
  presented by the signal-sending cell, resulting in structural changes in Notch that
  trigger its sequential cleavages by ADAM and γ-secretase proteases. Notch proteolysis
  leads to the release and nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD), which directly regulates target gene transcription. Therapeutic strategies
  to modulate Notch pathway function include chemical and immunological targeting
  of Notch, its ligands, the ADAM and γ-secretase proteases, and the downstream transcriptional
  factor Mastermind, as indicated.
