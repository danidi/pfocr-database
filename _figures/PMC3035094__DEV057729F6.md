caption: Cic regulatory elements mediate Torso and EGFR responses. (A) Sequential
  activation of the Torso (gray) and EGFR (blue) RTK pathways downregulates Cic along
  the AP and DV embryonic axes. Both pathways relieve Cic repression mediated by common
  cis-regulatory elements. Developmental stages (St.) are indicated. (B) EGFR signaling
  (blue) induces argos expression via Cic sites; activation of the pathway in vein
  cells leads to downregulation of Cic repressor activity, thereby derepressing argos
  transcription.
