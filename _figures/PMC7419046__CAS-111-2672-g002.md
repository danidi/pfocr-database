caption: TGF‐β signaling regulates lncRNA expression and mechanisms of TGF‐β signaling
  control by lncRNAs. TGF‐β signals through Smad2/3/4 proteins to regulate the expression
  of lncRNAs, acting as effector molecules that mediate the physiological responses
  of the signaling pathway (listed on the right hand‐side). lncRNAs target TGF‐β signaling
  at different stages of the pathway. At the level of Smad2/3 activation by TGFβRI,
  lnc‐LFAR1 (1) enhances the association of Smad2/3 with TGFβRI, leading to increased
  activation of the pathway. lnc‐TSI (2) blocks the interaction of Smad3 with TGFβRI,
  attenuating the pathway. In the nucleus, MALAT1 (3) shifts the Smad2/3 levels toward
  the non‐phosphorylated state, by promoting the association of the phosphatase PPM1A
  to Smads and inhibiting TGF‐β‐mediated responses. TGFB2‐AS1 (4) epigenetically silences
  TGF‐β‐target genes by recruiting the PRC2 repressive complex to their promoters
