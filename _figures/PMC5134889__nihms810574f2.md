caption: Upon TCR stimulation, TCR interacts with peptide-MHC complex presented on
  antigen presenting cells, leading to the activation of LCK and PI3K. Activation
  of LCK results in phosphorylation of the CD3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motifs (ITAMs) as well as ZAP70 and downstream adaptors LAT and SLP-76. Following
  PI3K activation, ITK is brought from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. There,
  ITK interacts with the activated complex of SLP-76 and LAT adaptors, leading to
  its phophorylation on the activation loop (Y511) by Lck. Activated ITK autophosphorylates
  Y180 in its SH3 domain and phosphorylates its downstream target PLCγ1. Activated
  PLCγ1 hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce inositol-3-phosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
  IP3 binds to receptors on intracellular organelles and cause Ca2+ release from the
  intracellular store, leading to sustained Ca2+ influx and downstream activation
  of transcription factors including NFAT. DAG activates two signal pathways. One
  is mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway which leads to the activation
  of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and the other one is Protein Kinase
  C (PKC). pathway which activates nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and c-Jun amino-terminal
  kinase (JNK).
