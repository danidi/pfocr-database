caption: CpG DNA or ODN can activate TLR9 on pDC, cDC, and B cells. Activation of
  pDC leads to production of mainly type I IFNs such as IFN-α and IFN-β, which then
  act on various cell types, including NK cells, T cells, and cDC. Activated NK cells
  produce IFN-γ, which in turn activates cDC. Activation of cDC promotes their maturation
  and function in antigen presentation, as well as production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, both of which are critical for the activation of CTL and Th1 differentiation.
  cDC also activate NK cells and B cells by cell–cell contact or soluble factors.
  Th1 differentiation can promote both CTL and Th1-biased B cell response and suppress
  Th2 response. CTL exhibit cytotoxic response to combat against tumor and eliminate
  pathogens. Th1-biased B cell response leads to enhanced production of IgG2a, which
  increases neutralizing antibody titers against pathogens. Th1 also suppresses Th2
  response, leading to reduced levels of IgE production, and thus inhibits allergic
  reactions.
