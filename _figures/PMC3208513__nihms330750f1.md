caption: Recognition of microbes in the intestinal mucosa. When the intestinal mucosal
  barrier is intact (A), bacteria come into contact with the epithelial cell solely
  on the apical membrane. The expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the apical
  surface is sparse, and TLR ligation results in inhibition of the proinflammatory
  nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Dendritic cells sample intestinal contents
  by opening tight junctions and extending dendrites expressing TLRs to the gut lumen.
  When the integrity of the epithelium is compromised by immaturity or inflammation
  (B), bacteria translocate within and between enterocytes and bind to TLRs on the
  basolateral surface of the epithelial cells. An inflammatory immune response is
  launched via the NF-κB pathway. IL—interleukin.
