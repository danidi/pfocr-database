caption: Example of a pathway reconstruction experiment. KLF11 targets in Panc1 cells
  were identified using pathway-specific arrays. Subsequently, a pathway was reconstructed
  using software that processes the data using semantic algorithms to search for available
  knowledge in literature databases (Pathway Assist; http://www.stratagene.com). The
  pathway depicted show interactions among proteins from a subset of proteins involved
  in transforming growth factor-β signaling.
