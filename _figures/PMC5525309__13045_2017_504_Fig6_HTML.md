caption: 'Working model of metabolic risk factor-induced two-way stimulatory immune
  checkpoint amplification and systemic/tissue inflammation. Metabolic risk factors,
  such as HHcy, uremic toxins, and other RF,, stimulate two-way stimulatory immune
  checkpoint amplification in TC, APC (MC), and possibly in PL via MADS recognition.
  In response to metabolic RF stimulation, metabolic sensors mediate TC activation
  via MAPK/NF-κB/calcineurin pathway, APC inflammation via STAT3MAPK/NF-κB pathway,
  MC differentiation via DNA hypomethylation, and possibly sCD40L production in PL
  via MAPK/NF-κB activation. TC activation and APC inflammation finally result in
  inflammatory cytokine production and systemic/tissue inflammation. Words in red
  emphasize our newly proposed signal pathway. Abbreviation: APC antigen present cell,
  HHcy hyperhomocysteinemia, MC monocyte, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase, MADS
  metabolism-associated danger signal, NF-κB nuclear factor κB, RF risk factor, PL
  platelet, STAT3 signal transducers and activator of transcription-3, sCD40L soluble
  CD40 ligand, TC T cell'
