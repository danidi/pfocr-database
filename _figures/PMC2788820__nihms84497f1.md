caption: 'The cardiolipin (CL) biosynthetic pathway: PGS1 encodes phosphatidylglycerol
  phosphate (PGP) synthase, which converts glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) and CDP-diacylglycerol
  (CDP-DAG) to PGP. PGP is dephosphorylated to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) by PGP phosphatase.
  CRD1 encodes CL synthase, which converts CDP-DAG and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to
  CL. In the proposed remodeling pathway, CL is deacylated to monolysocardiolipin
  (MLCL) by a phospholipase that has not been identified. MLCL is then reacylated
  to mature CL by Taz1p.'
