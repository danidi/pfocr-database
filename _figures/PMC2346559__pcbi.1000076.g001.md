caption: 'The solid arrows show enzymatic reactions. Dashed arrows indicate the allosteric
  regulatory influence of metabolites to enzymes. Red and blue colors indicate activation
  and inhibition respectively. Besides its role in protein synthesis, methionine is
  a substrate for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which is a ubiquitous
  methyl donor for numerous methyltransferases and is a precursor for polyamine synthesis.
  A product of the methyltransferase reactions is S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy),
  which in turn, is cleaved to adenosine and homocysteine in a reaction catalyzed
  by S-adenosylhomocysteinase (AHC). Homocysteine can be remethylated to methionine
  using the methyl group of methyl tetrahydrofolate (MTHF), or betaine, in reactions
  catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS) and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT), respectively. In many tissues, homocysteine is also metabolized via the
  transsulfuration pathway to generate cysteine, the limiting substrate for synthesis
  of glutathione (GSH), a major intracellular antioxidant. Enzyme abbreviations: AHC:
  adenosylhomocysteinase; BHMT: betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase; CBS: cystathionine
  β-synthase; GNMT: glycine-N-methyltransferase; MATI, III: methionine adenosyltransferase
  I, III; MS: methionine synthase; MTHFR: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Metabolite
  abbreviations: AdoHcy: S-adenosylhomocysteine; AdoMet: S-adenosylmethionine; Hcy:
