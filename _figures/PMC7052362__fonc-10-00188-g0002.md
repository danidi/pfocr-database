caption: The role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in promoting tumor progression
  and related mechanisms. TAMs can secrete chemokines and cytokines that promote tumor
  development, such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Furthermore, various molecular mechanisms
  play a large role in immunosuppression. The PD-1/L1 signaling pathway promotes the
  possibility of tumor immune escape because it can inhibit the normal function of
  macrophages. The SIRPα/CD47 pathway is referred to as the “do-not-eat-me” signal,
  while tumor cells with CD47 expression can be recognized as self-normal cells. LILRB1/MHC
  class I component β2-microglobulin is also a significant mechanism of tumor escape.
  In breast cancer and ovarian cancer, CD 24 on tumor cells can promote immune escape
  through the interaction of Siglec-10. In addition, recent researchers have found
  that TAMs can promote the development of tumors through exosomes.
