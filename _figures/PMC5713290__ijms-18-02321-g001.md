caption: Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR)-nuclear PTHRP pathway. CaSR activation through
  cAMP levels increases PTHRP production. The increased PTHRP at nuclear level decreases
  the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 and inhibits accumulation of apoptosis
  activator AIF (apoptosis inducing factor). Therefore, proliferation and cell survival
  are promoted (also see text).
