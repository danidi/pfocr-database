caption: 'Mechanism leading to CRS and ICANS and potential role of IL-1 blockade.
  Activated CAR T cells induce cytokine production from myeloid cells through different
  mechanism: (1) direct interactions between CD40-expressing myeloid cells and CD40L+
  T cells or (2) indirect interactions via secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., GM-CSF, TNFα, IFNγ). Activated myeloid cells produce high amounts of cytokines
  such as IL-1 and IL-6, which subsequently activate endothelial cells and disrupt
  vascular integrity. Endothelial cell-derived mediators (e.g., Ang-2 and vWF) can
  further stimulate endothelial cells, increase permeability and induce coagulopathy.
  IL-1-receptor antagonists are under investigation to inhibit the IL-1–IL-6 pathway.
  CRS, cytokine release syndrome; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating
