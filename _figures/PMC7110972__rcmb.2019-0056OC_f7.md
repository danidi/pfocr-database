caption: Proposed rES/ID1/TSP-1 signaling pathway. In the absence of rES, ID1 regulates
  growth factor (BMP and TGF-β) signaling by acting as a transcriptional repressor
  via dimerization with other basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors. This results
  in maintenance of vascular homeostasis via regulation of PEC proliferation, migration,
  and activation; via alterations in endothelial progenitor cell migration and proliferation;
  and via modification of the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype. In our
  proposed pathway, in the presence of rES, ID1 is degraded via the proteasome, alleviating
  transcriptional repression of ID1 target genes, including THBS1. Increased TSP-1
  protein expression promotes PEC apoptosis, inhibits migration and proliferation,
  and conversely promotes SMC proliferation. TSP-1 has also been implicated in TGF-β
  activation, regulation of nitric oxide (NO) signaling, and promoting reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), all of which are pathways implicated in the molecular pathobiology
  of pulmonary arterial hypertension. BMP = bone morphogenetic protein; EC = endothelial
  cell; PASMC = pulmonary artery vascular smooth muscle cells; TGF-β = transforming
  growth factor-β; VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor.
