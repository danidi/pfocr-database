caption: 'CD44/CD44v6 and CIC apoptosis resistance: (A–H) CD44 becomes engaged in
  apoptosis resistance by several mechanisms. (A) CD44v6 interferes with receptor-mediated
  apoptosis induction by preventing FAS trimerization. Antibody blocking of CD44v6
  rescues FAS receptor initiated apoptosis; (B) Upon HA-crosslinking, CD44-associated
  src becomes activated, the CD44 complex which additionally contains HSP70 and CDC37
  phosphorylates ERBB2/ERBB3, which binds neuregulin and activates the anti-apoptotic
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. In addition, Cox2 transcription becomes promoted. The
  latter stimulates PEC2 and blocks caspase 3 activation, which prohibits the execution
  phase of apoptosis. (C) Activation of c-Met via CD44v6-bound HGF promotes activation
  of the PI3K/Akt and the PKC-Ras-ERK pathway, activated ERK1/2 contributing to Akt
  phosphorylation, supporting anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and BclXl liberation. (D) Under
  stress, Merlin binds to the CD44-ICD leading to activation of the Hippo pathways
  that promotes caspase 3 cleavage, which initiates the execution phase of apoptosis.
  In the presence of CD44v3, merlin does not associated with the CD44-ICD; activation
  of the Hippo pathway is attenuated accompanied by increased apoptosis resistance.
  (E) CD44v3 contributes to apoptosis protection by binding proHBEGF that becomes
  cleaved via recruited MMP7. After loading on ERBB4, anti-apoptotic pathways become
  activated. (F) CD44v6-associated MMP14 accounts for proMMP9 cleavage. Activated
  MMP9 interferes with TGFβ activation, prohibiting TGFβ-promoted apoptosis induction.
  (G) Both CD44 and HA contribute to drug resistance. MDR genes are associated with
  CD44 and CD44 regulates expression of drug transporters by HA-activated CD44 binding
  to Gab1, which promotes PI3K activation. Activated PI3K stimulates HA production
  as well as MDR transporter expression. Alternatively, HA binding to CD44 upregulates
  p300 expression and its acetyltransferase activity, which sustains acetylating β-catenin
  and NFκB-p65. β-catenin and NFκB are cotranscription factors for MDR1. HA crosslinking
  stabilizes the CD44-MDR1 complex. Instead, upon Hyal activation and HA degradation
  the complex becomes internalized, all components including S100A and Annexin II
  being recovered in the cytoplasm. (H) Via PKC activation CD44v3 promotes Nanog phosphorylation,
  which induced miR-21 production accounting for MDR1 release from repression.'
