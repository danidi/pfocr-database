caption: Schematic summary of ASK1-mediated apoptotic pathway in Aβ-induced CEC death.
  Aβ activates the PP2A–ASK1–MKK3/6–p38MAPK signaling cascade, leading to p53 activation
  and Bax expression in Aβ-induced CEC death. Approaches applied in the present studies
  are shown to support the causal role of each step in the cascade.
