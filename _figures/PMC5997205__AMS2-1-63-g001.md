caption: Immune system activation pathway following injury. The inflammasome is a
  large multiprotein complex that plays a key role in innate immunity by participating
  in the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)‐1β and
  IL‐18. They are both produced as inactive precursors, pro‐IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18, and
  share a common maturation mechanism that requires activated caspase‐1. The inflammasomes
  sense damage‐associated molecular patterns including pathogen‐associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) and the host‐derived signals known as alarmins. Cell death induced
  by inflammasome activation is known as pyroptosis. Alarmins also stimulate Toll‐like
  receptors (TLRs), which produce IL‐6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α in response
  to injury. NF‐κB, nuclear factor‐κB.
