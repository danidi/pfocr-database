caption: Proposed model for the role of mDia in SDF-1α– dependent axon outgrowth in
  cultured cerebellar granule neurons. Usually Rho and Rac antagonistically controls
  axon outgrowth. During the very early stages in the primary culture, ROCK action
  predominates to favor suppression of precocious outgrowth of axons from the cerebellar
  granule cells. However, as these neurons express a high amount of mDia1 gradual
  decline in ROCK activity facilitates expression of Rho-dependent mDia1 activity
  and a subsequent recruitment of a signaling complex, which in concert with the Rac-dependent
  signaling cascade may help the transition from inhibition to stimulation of axon
  outgrowth and elongation. Thus, the SDF-1α/Rho/mDia1 pathway may play a critical
  role in defining and modulating the balance between the Rho- and Rac-based signaling
  pathways during axon outgrowth.
