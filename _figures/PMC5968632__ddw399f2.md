caption: 'Pathways significantly enriched for: (A) Loci associated with the vertical
  cup-disc ratio, cup area and intraocular pressure (P-value <7.0 × 10-6 in the GWAS).
  In total 11 meta-pathways were identified after clustering the 57 pathways identified
  by DEPICT. B) Loci associated with vertical cup-disc ratio, cup area and disc area
  (P-value <1.0 × 10-5). In total 17 meta-pathways were identified after clustering
  the 100 pathways identified by DEPICT. In both figures, meta-pathways are represented
  by nodes coloured according to statistical significance, and edges are scaled according
  to the correlation between meta-pathways. *The pathway “Abnormal eye morphology”
  clustered with the meta-pathway “Chordate embryonic development”. ELL2 = Elongation
  Factor, RNA Polymerase II, DVL3= Dishevelled Segment Polarity Protein 3, THBS1 = Thrombospondin
