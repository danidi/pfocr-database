caption: Complement activation pathways. (a) Activation of the classical, lectin,
  and alternative pathways results in the generation of C3 convertases that cleave
  C3 into C3b and C3a. C1 of the classical pathway and mannose-binding associated
  serine proteases (MASPs) of the lectin pathway cleave C4 and C2, and the resultant
  larger fragments then form the classical/lectin pathway C3 convertase. C3 is cleaved
  by C3 convertases into C3b, which deposits on the cell surface, and C3a, an anaphylatoxin,
  which recruits and activates effector cells. C3b may rapidly amplify through a positive
  feedback loop termed the C3b alternative pathway amplification loop. C3b may also
  trigger activation of C5 through the generation of the C5 convertases, which are
  composed of C3b attached to a C3 convertase. This structure alters the substrate
  specificity of the convertase to favor C5. C5 convertase cleaves C5 and results
  in the generation of C5a (an anaphylatoxin) and assembly of the membrane attack
  complex (MAC) beginning with C5b (plus C6, C7, C8 and many C9s). (b) The amplification
  or feedback loop of the alternative pathway. Factor H (FH), factor I (FI), and membrane
  cofactor protein (MCP) are the key regulators of the alternative pathway and interrupt
  the feedback loop. Excessive activation via this loop secondary to a decrease in
  regulatory activity or a gain of function in a component like FB or C3 predisposes
  to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Also see . FI is a serine protease; in conjunction
  with a cofactor protein (FH or MCP), it cleaves C3b to iC3b, which cannot form a
  C3 convertase, i.e., the feedback loop cannot be engaged. C3bBbP is the alternative-pathway
  C3 convertase.
