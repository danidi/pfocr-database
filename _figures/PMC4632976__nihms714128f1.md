caption: The enzymes of the type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway localize
  to apicoplast lumen (green). A starter molecule is synthesized by condensation from
  CoA activated precursors on acyl carrier protein (ACP). The molecule is sequentially
  reduced, dehydrated and reduced to yield a fully reduced fatty acyl chain. This
  process is repeated in multiple rounds to generate myristate or palmitate as the
  final products. The fatty acid elongation (FAE) pathway unfolds on the cytoplasmic
  face of the endoplasmic reticulum and its membrane bound enzymes catalyze a similar
  set of reactions. An elongase (ELO) condenses a malonyl-CoA molecule with a fatty
  acyl-CoA, for ELO-A the fatty acid is palmitate derived from the FASII pathway.
  T. gondii harbors three elongase enzymes, with catalytic specificity determined
  by length and saturation of the fatty acid. The products of all three elongases
  are then reduced, dehydrated and reduced by a ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KCR), hydroxyacyl-CoA
  dehydratase (DEH) and enoyl-CoA reductase enzymes (ECR). The enzymes that are the
  focus of this study are highlighted in red. Note that the carbon source for the
  two pathways is distinct, and that only the elongation pathway is efficiently labeled
  using acetate isotopes.
