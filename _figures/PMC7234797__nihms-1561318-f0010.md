caption: Huntington’s disease (HD) pathology is characterized by the intracellular
  accumulation and aggregation of the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT), which results
  in subsequent cell death, and the spread of pathology due to cell-to-cell transmission
  of extracellular mHTT. Other hallmarks of HD pathology include pro-inflammatory
  signals (e.g., SEM4D/plexinB1 signaling pathway), and down-regulation of cell survival/neurotrophic
  signals (e.g., BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway). HD progression may potentially be blocked
  by passive immunotherapy strategies that target one or more aspects of this pathology.
  For example, anti-HTT antibodies (e.g., intrabodies) may be used to target intracellular
  mHTT. It is important to note that anti-HTT intrabodies typically bind to both normal
  HTT and mHTT. The ratio of mHTT to normal HTT is indicative of HD pathology and
  mHTT mRNA transcripts were found to exceed normal HTT in the cortex and striatum
  of nearly 75% patients in an HD clinical study . The increase in mHTT compared to
  normal HTT may be attributed to increased transcription of the mHTT allele, or decreased
  clearance of mHTT, or both . Therefore, engineering antibodies that recognize and
  bind with higher affinity to mHTT than normal HTT may be important since an equimolar
  inhibition of mHTT and normal HTT may increase the mHTT to normal HTT ratio . Additionally,
  normal HTT is thought to play a role in promoting cell survival and depleting it
  may further exacerbate disease pathology and clinical outcome .
