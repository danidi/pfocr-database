caption: When Bc enters the lungs, it is recognized by alveolar macrophages and taken
  up by these phagocytes. TLR4 sensing in the endosome leads to Ifnb1 transcription
  via the TRIF/TRAM pathway. However, bacterial escape to the cytosol allows for the
  integration of other signaling pathways like cGAS-STING and the RLR-MAVS pathway,
  which also contribute to Ifnb1 transcription, and allow for prolonged IFNβ production.
  IFNβ acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion by binding to its receptor, IFNAR, leading
  to the transcription of various ISGs, including components of the LUBAC complex
  such as HOIP, HOIL-1, and SHARPIN. The LUBAC proteins then tag the cytosol-dwelling
  Bc for destruction via the autophagy pathway.
