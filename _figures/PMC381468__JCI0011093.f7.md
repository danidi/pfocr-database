caption: The pathway leading from sarcomere protein gene mutation to hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy and the role of an abnormal Ca2+response. CsA and FK506 may increase
  cytoplasmic Ca2+ through interaction with calcineurin or by activation of the L-type
  Ca2+ channel. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ enters the sarcoplasmic reticulum by way of an ATPase-dependent
  calcium pump (SERCA) and exits by way of the inositol triphosphate receptor (InsP3R)
  and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). Small increases in Ca2+ trigger Ca2+-induced Ca2+
  release (CICR) primarily through the RyR. Considerable Ca2+ is stored in the sarcomere.
  We hypothesize that sarcomeres containing mutant myosins (denoted by asterisks)
  store more Ca2+ than normal sarcomeres, causing a reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+ that signals a hypertrophic response. Most Ca2+ in the sarcomere and sarcoplasmic
  reticulum is bound to carrier proteins, whereas most Ca2+ in the cytoplasm is free.
  Diltiazem is an inhibitor of the L-type Ca2+ channel, whereas minoxidil is an activator
  of the K+ channel.
