caption: Schematic of serpinin formation, its signaling pathway, and PN-1-dependent
  biogenesis of secretory granules in (neuro)endocrine cells. CgA is proteolytically
  cleaved to form serpinin, which is secreted in an activity-dependent manner. Secreted
  serpinin binds to a cognate receptor and induces cAMP elevation followed by PKA
  activation. Then, Sp1, a transcriptional factor translocates into the nucleus to
  up-regulate PN-1 transcription. The increase in PN-1 protein stabilizes the secretory
  granule proteins at the Golgi apparatus to increase their levels, which then promotes
  biogenesis of DCG. DCG, Dense-core granule; GP, granule protein; RER, rough endoplasmic
  reticulum.
