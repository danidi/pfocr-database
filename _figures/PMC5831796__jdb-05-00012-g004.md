caption: GLI1-expressing hair follicle stem cells and their roles. The expression
  of GLI1 and other markers define molecularly distinct zones in the telogen hair
  follicle, including regionalization of the bulge into the upper, middle, and lower
  bulge. GLI1-expressing cells in the upper bulge receive a HH signal from hair follicle-associated
  nerve cells, and are functionally distinct from cells in the middle bulge, lower
  bulge, and matrix in their ability to become epidermal stem cells during wound repair.
  The roles of each GLI1+ bulge stem cell population are described in orange text
  on the right.
