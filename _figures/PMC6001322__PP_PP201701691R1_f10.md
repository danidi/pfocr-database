caption: Proposed model for CK signaling in bud outgrowth regulation. Canonical CK
  signaling via the type-B ARR1 results in feedback-mediated down-regulation of CK
  levels as part of signal perception. Members of the type-A ARR family are transcriptionally
  induced by ARR1 and/or other type-B family members and dampen type-B-mediated signaling,
  including the feedback-mediated down-regulation of CK levels. The basal plasma membrane
  accumulation of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 in xylem parenchyma cells in the main stem
  is enhanced by CK by an unknown mechanism. In parallel, the expression of other
  bud regulatory genes such as BRC1 may be targeted by the canonical CK signaling
  pathway.
