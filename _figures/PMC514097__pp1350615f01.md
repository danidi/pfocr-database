caption: The SOS signaling pathway for the regulation of Na+ homeostasis and salt
  tolerance in Arabidopsis. High Na+ stress triggers a calcium signal that activates
  the SOS3-SOS2 protein kinase complex, which then stimulates the Na+/H+ exchange
  activity of SOS1 at the plasma membrane. SOS2 also activates Na+/H+ (AtNHX) and
  Ca2+/H+ (CAX1) exchangers on the vacuolar membrane. The protein phosphatase ABI2
  has been shown to physically interact with SOS2 and is proposed to inactivate SOS2.
  The SOS pathway may down-regulate the activity of Na+ influx transporters (AtHKT1
  and NCS). SOS1 in gray indicates that this transporter may also have a sensory role.
  Dotted lines indicate possible regulation.
