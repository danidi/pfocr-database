caption: We propose that there are 2 different pathways in the amelioration of insulin
  resistance induced by the PPARγ agonists TZDs, such as pioglitazone and probably
  rosiglitazone. One involves an adiponectin-dependent pathway and the other an adiponectin-independent
  pathway. TZDs increase adiponectin levels, ameliorating insulin resistance, increasing
  AMPK activation, and decreasing gluconeogenesis in the liver. On the other hand,
  independently of adiponectin, TZDs decrease adipocyte size, serum FFA levels, and
  expression of TNF-α and resistin, thus contributing to amelioration of insulin resistance
  in skeletal muscle.
