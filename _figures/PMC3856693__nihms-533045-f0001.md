caption: 'Interaction of a cytokine ligand with the extracellular domains of its cognate
  receptor initiates the cytokine signaling. Common elements of this signaling (“stem
  signaling”) is represented by the activation of JAKs resulting in their own phosphorylation.
  Activated JAKs then signal “forward” to phosphorylate the intracellular domains
  of the receptor and recruited STAT proteins that become activated and alter the
  transcriptional program of a cytokine-exposed cell. Concurrently, the “eliminative:
  signaling mediated by JAKs promotes downregulation of associated receptors often
  coupled with their proteolytic degradation via lysosomal or/and proteasomal pathway.'
