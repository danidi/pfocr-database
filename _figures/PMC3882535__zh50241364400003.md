caption: 'Novel GPCR-based signaling mechanisms in ASM. A: effect of bitter tastants
  such as chloroquine and saccharin on bitter taste receptor (TAS2R) GPCRs in ASM
  has been a topic of substantial recent interest. Working through a Gq protein-coupled
  mechanism (where the α-subunit may represent gustducin, transducin, or α1), TAS2R
  activation leads to increased SR Ca2+ release via IP3 receptor channels and elevated
  [Ca2+]i levels but intriguingly results in bronchodilation via mechanisms that remain
  to be established. Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BKCa) and inhibition of voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels are thought to be involved, but pathways such as inhibition of other
  Ca2+ influx mechanisms, mitochondria, or contractile mechanisms downstream to Ca2+
  may also be relevant. B: a novel, intriguing GPCR mechanism recently identified
  in ASM is an extracellular pH-sensitive pathway, ovarian cancer G protein-coupled
  receptor 1 (OGR1/GPR68), that on the one hand appears to work via Gq to increase
  [Ca2+]i via the IP3 mechanism, but on the other hand also activates the protein
  kinase A cascade either directly through Gq or perhaps through interactions with
  Gs. VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. C: in contrast to the novel TAS2R
  and OGR1 pathways, there is now increasing evidence that the GABA and dopaminergic
  systems (well known in neuroscience) also have interesting effects in ASM. Activation
  of the metabotropic GABA-B receptor results in a Gi-coupled cross activation of
  Gq-coupled receptors of bronchoconstrictor agonists, leading to increased [Ca2+]i.
  On the other hand, prolonged dopaminergic signaling via a D2-like, Gi-coupled pathway
  leads to enhancement of the Gs-coupled β2-adrenoceptor (β2AR) system, thus increasing
  cAMP and promoting bronchodilation. GRK3, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; RGS4,
  G-protein signaling 4.'
