caption: IL-27 induces IRF-1 expression through WSX-1/STAT1 signaling, resulting in
  up-regulation of TRAIL expression. IL-27 also augments TLR3 expression in IRF-1-dependent
  and -independent manner. Thus, due to the augmented TLR3 expression by IL-27, IL-27,
  and a synthetic TLR3 agonist, poly(I:C), cooperatively enhance TRAIL expression
  and greatly inhibit tumor growth partly in a TRAIL-dependent manner.
