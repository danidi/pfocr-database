caption: Regulation of HIF-α subunits by O2 availability and other intracellular metabolites.
  In oxygen replete cells, the HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) are active, resulting
  in the hydroxylation of proline residues in HIF-α and their targeted degradation
  via the pVHL-proteosome pathway. “Factor-inhibiting HIF” (FIH) hydroxylation of
  an asparagine residue in the C-terminus of the HIF-α subunit, blocks p300 co-factor
  recruitment. This results in the inactivation of HIF-α subunit transcriptional activity.
  All of these processes are inhibited when O2 levels decrease or cells exhibit increased
  levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other metabolites such as fumerate,
  succinate, and nitric oxide (NO). Here, the HIF-α subunits are stabilized, they
  recruit co-activators such as p300, and activate HIF target genes, as described
  in .
