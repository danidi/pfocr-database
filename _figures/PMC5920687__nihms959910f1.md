caption: '(A) Our previous work with phenoxazine PCs focused on noncore modified PCs
  and core modified PC 1. (B) Proposed general photoredox cycle that proceeds via
  an oxidative quenching pathway. 1PC: ground state PC; PC*: excited state PC, which
  can be either in the singlet (1PC*) or triplet (3PC*) excited state; 2PC•+: radical
  cation of the photoredox catalyst.'
