caption: The diagram shows how mTOR/AMPK/Ulk1 signaling axis directs mouse ESC pluripotency
  upon resveratrol treatment. Serum-based culture of mouse ESCs is characterized by
  heterogeneous expressions of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Klf4 proteins and by upregulated
  mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. mTORC1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits Ulk1,
  suppressing autophagy. Upon resveratrol treatment, abrogation of differentiation
  occurs by prevailing the AMPK/Ulk1 pathway activation over the mTOR pathway when
  the high autophagic flux maintains ESC identity by guarding their pluripotency capacity.
