caption: Pictorial representation of un-inhibited Avian avulavirus 1 (APMV-1)-induced
  type I interferon (IFN) response in waterfowl cells. After the fusion of virion
  and plasma membrane, the viral RNA enters the cytoplasm, where it is recognized
  by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene
  5 (MDA5), or toll like receptor (TLR) 3 and initiates downstream signaling mediated
  through mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). Activated MAVS, stimulate
  the translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to the nucleus, leading
  to the transcription of type I IFNs (IFN-α and β). These upregulations of IFNs may
  last for is 8–12 h (early phase). Then, these IFNs stimulate JAK–STAT pathway leading
  to phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 molecules, which (together with factors that
  are currently unknown in waterfowl) results in the formation of the IFN-stimulated
  gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription factor complex. This multifunctional transcription
  factor initiates the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which
  subsequently establish the antiviral state against the invading viruses. Several
  well-characterized ISGs are revealed in the figure.
