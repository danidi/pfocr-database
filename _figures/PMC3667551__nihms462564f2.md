caption: Inositol polyphosphates in insulin homeostasis. Inositol pyrophosphates (5-IP7)
  facilitate insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells (). The secreted hormone signals
  through its receptors in insulin-responsive tissues and activates the protein kinase
  Akt through the PI 3-kinase pathway. Insulin also increases inositol pyrophosphate
  concentrations, which decreases Akt activity in liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose
  tissues () and thereby maintains homeostasis between insulin release and its signaling.
