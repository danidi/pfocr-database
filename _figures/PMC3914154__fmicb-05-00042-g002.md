caption: 'Elementary flux modes of aerobic glucose and xylose catabolism for a strain
  with engineered pentose phosphate pathway enzymes. Elementary flux mode for catabolism
  of glucose in cells with knocked-out edd and overexpressed heterologous gnd via
  the Entner–Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathway, involving both NADH- and NADPH-oxidizing
  activity of the respiratory chain, is shown. ScrumPy modeling software EFM drawing
  algorithm (Pentjuss et al., unpublished) was used for visualization. Inset: complete
  list of elementary flux modes of glucose and xylose catabolism in Z. mobilis, involving
  the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, pentose phosphate pathway and the respiratory chain,
  with ethanol and carbon dioxide as the sole products. The explicitly shown elementary
  flux mode is shaded in gray.'
