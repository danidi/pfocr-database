caption: 'Schematic representation of the brain microvasculature features and corresponding
  Impact of TS: a Schematic illustration of a cross sectional view of a brain capillary.
  Note the endothelial cells are surrounded by supporting astrocytic end feet processes
  and pericytes along with the ensheathing basal lamina. b Paracellular passage of
  substances across the BBB endothelial layer is restricted by junctional protein
  complexes consisting of TJ proteins (such as occludin, claudins, JAMs); along with
  adherens junction protein VE-cadherin and catenins. Note that the cytoplasmic accessory
  protein ZO-1 intercalates these intercellular proteins with the cytoskeleton. c
  TS-produced ROS promotes oxidative stress responses at the BBB endothelium. These
  include the activation of several transcription factors including Nf-κB and the
  antioxidant response system via nrf2-ARE pathway. This latter in turn activates
  anti-oxidant and detoxification genes. The downstream effect of TS exposure leads
  to the down regulation of TJ proteins; increase in vascular permeability and activation
  of pro-inflammatory responses leading to BBB dysfunction'
