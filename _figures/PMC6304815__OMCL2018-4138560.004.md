caption: Signaling pathways of kallistatin in protection against vascular senescence,
  oxidative stress, and inflammation in EPCs and endothelial cells. Kallistatin via
  its heparin-binding site blocks TNF-α/H2O2-modulated NADPH oxidase activity and
  ROS formation and thus ICAM-1 and PAI-1/p16INK4a expression. Kallistatin through
  its active site stimulates Let-7g synthesis, to inhibit miR-34 and stimulate SIRT1-eNOS
  pathway, thereby elevating NO levels, further leading to reduced ROS levels.
