caption: HPAT can recover three of seven pathways patented for use in the production
  of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) starting from pyruvate. The seven pathways are
  numbered according to Jiang et al. []. Intermediates that are underlined represent
  hub compounds from the 50 in-degree (I) hub table (see Table  for details). Arrows
  represent reactions linking intermediates where the color of the arrow indicates
  if they are found by the HPAT search where at least one carbon is conserved. Solid
  green arrows represent reactions that were found by the HPAT search, solid orange
  arrows represent reactions that were not found in the search, dashed arrows are
  require multiple reactions, and an X marks those reactions that are absent from
  KEGG and cannot be found by the search, grey arrows represent alternative reactions
  found by the search but not associated with the seven pathways, and the green highlight
  represents entire pathways between pyruvate and 3-HP that are recovered. a Reactions
  identified in the HPAT search connecting TCA cycle intermediates, succinate, malate,
  and fumarate, to Pathways III and IV (b) and viable acetate and malonate to Pathway
  II (c)
