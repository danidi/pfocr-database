caption: MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway interactions in melanocytic tumors. Extracellular
  growth factors trigger the dimerisation of receptor tyrosine kinases (ALK, NTRK1,
  RET, ROS1, MET or KIT), leading to autophosphorylation and activation of intracellular
  signaling cascades such as the MAPK/ERK or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Among a variety
  of other functions, these signaling pathways increase cell proliferation and survival.
  BRAF serves as a mitotic signal transporter in the MAPK pathway causing activation
  and phosphorylation of MEK which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK. Activation
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is propagated through PI3K which catalyses the production
  of PIP3. The later binds to PDK1 and AKT allowing of both proteins to the cell membrane,
  followed by their activation. As a consequence of this co localization, AKT is fully
  activated. PI3K is antagonized by PTEN through dephosphorylation of PIP3, thereby
  preventing AKT activation. Upon activation, AKT in turn activates mTOR involved
  in the translation machinery through inactivation of 4E-BP1, the repressor of mRNA
  translation, and activation of S6K1, the promoter of mRNA translation. PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  can interact directly or indirectly with the MAPK pathway. NRAS plays an important
  role in both pathways. Mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, and BRAF lead to activation of
  the MAPK pathway only, while mutations in KIT and NRAS can activate both pathways.
  In addition, GNAQ, GNA11 as well as KIT mutations activate PKC which is a negative
  regulator of AKT. Different inhibitors can be applied in targeted therapy of advanced
  melanoma patients, and their points of action are indicated as strokes. Dashed arrows
  indicate indirect or probable interactions between molecules.
