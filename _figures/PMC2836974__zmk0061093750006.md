caption: 'Model of the Rap1 pathway in Dictyostelium regulating adhesion and cell
  morphology. Dictyostelium Rap1 switches between an active GTP–bound and inactive
  GDP–bound state. GbpD is one of the GEFs that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP,
  thereby activating the Rap1 protein. Phg2, a serine/threonine kinase, is necessary
  for Rap1-regulated adhesion. PI3K directly interacts with active Rap1, thereby regulating
  PIP3 formation and subsequently adhesion and basal cell morphology. Binding of cAMP
  to the cAR1 receptor results in the rapid activation of GEFs and subsequently Ras
  at the leading edge. RasG activation is essential for regulating PIP3 signaling
  and subsequently essential for amplifying the initial signal, establishing cell
  polarity and actin polymerization at the leading edge. Rap1 activation in response
  to cAMP occurs downstream of RasG. Rap1 may regulate leading edge formation through
  two mechanisms: it amplifies and stabilizes the initial PIP3 gradient, and it activates
  Phg2, which directly or indirectly phosphorylates MHCKa that controls leading edge
  myosin II disassembly thereby facilitating actin-mediated leading edge protrusions.'
