caption: (a) Rational metabolic engineering strategies to optimize a xylose-assimilating
  pathway consisting of the XYL1, XYL2, and XYL3 genes and to overcome acetate toxicity
  (ald6Δ), (b) evolutionary engineering to isolate mutants (SR7e1, SR7e2, SR7e3) that
  grow faster on xylose and to identify genetic changes (pho13Δ) of the mutants through
  genome sequencing, and (c) targeted analysis to confirm inhibitory effect of Pho13p
  on xylose metabolism by engineered S. cerevisiae.
