caption: Schematic illustration of the core elements of rice specific protein-processing
  pathway and UPR signaling network. Proteins labled in red indicate that the upregulated
  proteins by the iTRAQ assay, whose orthologous in Arabidopsis were labled in bracket.
  Chaperones that have diversity functions were listed out briefly.
