caption: Over-view of aging, proteotoxicity and Hsps. Three pathways, the sex-determination
  pathway (X/Y), the insulin/IGF1-like signaling pathway (IIS), and the target of
  rapamycin pathway (TOR) promote differentiation, sexual differentiation and growth.
  This differentiation and growth is epistatic to the antagonistic pleiotropic activities
  of numerous genes, thereby inhibiting optimal maintenance of the genome and mitochondria.
  Mitochondrial failure results in decreased production of ATP and increased production
  of ROS, resulting in the accumulation of abnormal proteins and proteotoxicity. Denatured
  proteins and ROS cause chronic induction of Hsp genes (indicated in red) providing
  one predictive biomarker of aging. Lipids, proteins and carbohydrates undergo complex
  cross-linking and biochemical changes to produce the autofluorescent age pigment
  called lipofuscin (indicated in red), another biomarker of aging. Normally regulated
  expression of Hsps can favor longevity by counteracting proteotoxicity, inhibiting
  apoptosis, and possibly other mechanisms.
