caption: Schematic illustrating hypothesized role of PARV+ striatal interneurons in
  controlling the responses of nearby SP-containing direct pathway striatal neurons
  to their driving input from IT-type corticostriatal neurons. Rapid feed-forward
  inhibition of SP+ neurons by cortically activated PARV+ neurons is hypothesized
  to suppress the responses of SP+ striatal neurons in nearby domains but not within
  the domain of the PARV+ interneuron itself. In the illustration, by suppressing
  cortical activation of SP+ neurons controlling behavior B, the PARV+ interneuron
  ensures that IT-type cortical input activates SP+ neurons controlling behavior A.
  In the absence of the PARV+ interneuron, the conflicting behaviors A and B would
  both be initiated, leading potentially to dystonia if A and B involve opposing muscle
  groups. PARV, parvalbumin; PARV+, parvalbuminergic; SP, substance P; IT, intratelencephalically
  projecting.
