caption: Proposed mechanism for Vinorelbine’s radio sensitizing effect. Radiotherapy
  induces DNA damage that activates the p-ATM/p-ATR/p-Chk2/γH2AX pathway, which in
  turn activates the cell cycle control protein, leading to G2/M cell cycle arrest
  and DNA repair. Under normal circumstances where DNA is repaired, cells continue
  to proliferate. However, failure to repair damaged DNA leads to cell death. Radiotherapy
  also induces vascular remodeling by increasing vascular density, which may facilitate
  the delivery of Vinorelbine. Vinorelbine alone inhibited microtubule polymerization,
  leading to mitotic arrest and cell death. Furthermore, Vinorelbine inhibited the
  p-ATM/p-ATR/p-Chk2 pathway, thus reducing cellular DNA repair, which results in
  increased cell death. Increased levels of DNA damage, the inability to repair DNA,
  inhibition of FGFR expression, and prolonged mitotic arrest due to inhibition of
  Cdc25C, Aurora B, survivin, and p-Cdc2 by the combination of RT/Vinorelbine led
  to more cell death, indicated by elevated levels of cleaved caspase 3.
