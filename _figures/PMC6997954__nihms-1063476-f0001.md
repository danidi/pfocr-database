caption: The MEP pathway is essential in Mtb. The terminal products from IPP and DMAPP
  include hopanoids which modify membrane properties, menaquinones or vitamin K2 that
  play essential roles in the respiratory electron transport systems, and polyprenyl
  phosphates that are crucial for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. DXP, the product
  of the first enzymatic reaction in the MEP pathway, is a precursor to vitamins B1
  and vitamin B6.
