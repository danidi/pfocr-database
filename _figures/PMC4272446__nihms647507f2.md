caption: NOD2 interacts directly with intracellular bacterial PGN fragments containing
  the MDP motif. Ligand recognition relieves intra-molecular autoinhibitory interactions
  leading to NOD oligomerization. Recruitment of the downstream RIPK2 Ser/Thr kinase
  occurs through CARD-CARD domain interactions. Subsequent activation of the NF-κB
  and MAPK pathways results in the transcriptional up-regulation of pro-inflammatory
  and host defense genes. Multiple steps in the pathway are regulated either positively
  or negatively by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and pUb
  events. Multiple regulatory genes act to influence various steps in the pathway
  often in a cell-type dependent manner.
