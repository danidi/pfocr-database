number: Figure 4
caption: 'High levels of glucose inhibit and high levels of insulin activate glutathione
  synthesis via the enzyme γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Legend to   Connection arrows
  with color red represent inhibition and color green represent activation. Purple
  hexagons represent metabolites; purple hexagons with white star represent metabolites
  measured with one of the metabolic profiling platforms; orange symbols represent
  enzymes. Red arrows upwards indicate that higher plasma concentration levels were
  found in the diclofenac treated group in response to oral glucose tolerance test.
  Abbreviations: AA, amino acid; Cys-Gly, cysteinylglycine. These figures were created
  by using MapEditor version 2.1.0 (GeneGo Inc, St Joseph, MI).'
