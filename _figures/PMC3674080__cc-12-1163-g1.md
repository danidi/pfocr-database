caption: Figure 1. Pathways that can contribute to cancer cell survival. Replication
  stress activates the ATR pathway leading to activation of CHK1 through phosphorylation
  of Ser345 and Ser317; Ser296 is autophosphorylated and serves as a marker of activated
  CHK1. ATR also phosphorylates ATM on Ser1981. CHK1 activity is required for active,
  nuclear PP2A. Inhibition or depletion of CHK1 decreases nuclear PP2A and increases
  (through unknown mechanisms) an inhibitory phosphorylation of PP2A on Tyr307. Inhibition
  of PP2A results in enhanced phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser235 and S296 and ATM on
  Ser1981. Basal signals that activate ATM may come from ATR acting at replication
  forks that are stalled at natural barriers or, after collapse of stalled forks,
  auto-activation by DNA double-strand breaks.
