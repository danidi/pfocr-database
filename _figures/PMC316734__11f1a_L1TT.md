caption: (A) Model of the calcium signaling pathway in yeast. Calcineurin activation
  by binding calcium and calmodulin inhibits the H+/Ca2+ exchanger Vcx1p and induces
  expression of the Ca2+ pump Pmc1p through activation of the transcription factor
  Tcn1p. (B) Multiple sequence alignment of Rcn1p from S. cerevisiae and predicted
  proteins from other fungi (Candida albicans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Neurospora
  crassa, and Aspergillus nidulans), protozoans (Dictyostelium discoideum), and animals
  (Caenorhabditus elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens) was generated
  using the Clustal algorithm. Residues identical in at least three of the seven sequences
  are highlighted and the most conserved central motif corresponding to the DS-24
  peptide is underlined. GenBank accession numbers are NP_012763 (S.c.), Q09791 (S.p.),
  P53806 (C.e.), AAD33987 (D.m.), D83407 (H.s. ZAKI-4), AAF01684 (H.s. DSCR1L), and
  U85266 (H.s. DSCR1). Other sequences were obtained from ongoing genome sequencing
  projects (C.a., D.d., and N.c.) or from a compilation of EST sequences at GenBank
  (A.n. and D.d.). Note that some sequences were truncated at amino- and/or carboxyl
  termini and three small deletions (●) were introduced into the C. albicans sequence.
