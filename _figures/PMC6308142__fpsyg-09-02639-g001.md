caption: Sagittal representation of the mesocorticolimbic system and the brain stress-related
  areas. (A) The mesocorticolimbic system is composed of dopamine projection neurons
  (green arrow) that innervate the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC).
  Drugs of abuse such as cocaine or amphetamine increase the activity of VTA neurons
  and lead to dopamine release in the NAc and PFC. The HPA axis comprises the paraventricular
  nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the anterior pituitary gland (AP) and the adrenal
  cortex (AC). Stressful stimuli activate the PVN, which releases CRF (blue arrow)
  in the AP and stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (orange arrow) secretion
  into the bloodstream. In turn, ACTH reaches the AC to induce release of corticoids
  (CORT, brown arrow). Activation of the HPA is terminated by a negative feedback
  mechanism induced by corticoids in the PVN and AC. Acute and chronic exposure to
  stress lead to vulnerability to drug addiction by strengthening plasticity across
  the mesocorticolimbic pathway. Indeed, stress induces DA release in the PFC and
  NAc and “sensitizing” VTA neurons (). (B) Relevant stress-related areas and their
  interaction with the brain’s reward system. Corticosteroids from the adrenal gland
  stimulate the VTA and the extended amygdala [bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
  (BNST), amygdala (AMY), and the shell of the NAc]. The arousal system and the noradrenergic
  projections from the locus coeruleus (LC) is also represented (dashed lines).
