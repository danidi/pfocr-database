caption: Normal endothelial cell metabolismA schematic of the principal pathways in
  healthy EC metabolism and the rate-limiting enzymes, carriers, and transporters
  (shown in blue). For simplification, not all metabolites or enzymes of the indicated
  pathways are shown. Glucose is transported via the constitutively expressed GLUT-1.
  ECs mainly depend on glycolysis to generate the needed energy to perform their functions.
  Mitochondria in ECs generate survival and angiogenic signals through ROS, and provide
  building blocks (such as acetyl-CoA) via TCA cycle for macromolecule synthesis.
  Glycolysis intermediates are shunted into side pathways for anti-oxidant defense
  and nucleotide synthesis (oxPPP and non-oxPPP) and glycosylation purposes (HBP).
