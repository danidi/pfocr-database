caption: The quinate/shikimate catabolic and shikimate biosynthetic pathways. Quinate
  is catabolized to form protocatechuate through the three reactions catalyzed by
  quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (C. glutamicum QsuD), dehydroquinate dehydratase
  (QsuC), and dehydroshikimate dehydratase (QsuB). Shikimate is converted to dehydroshikimate
  by quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (QsuD). Protocatechuate is subsequently metabolized
  by the β-ketoadipate pathway. Dehydroquinate dehydratase and shikimate dehydrogenase
  reactions are also involved in the shikimate biosynthetic pathway, which converts
  phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate, intermediate metabolites of glycolysis
  and the pentose phosphate pathway, respectively, to chorismate. Chorismate is a
  starting metabolite of branched pathways leading to the biosynthesis of various
  aromatic compounds.
