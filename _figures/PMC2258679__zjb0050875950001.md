caption: The benzoate degradation pathway identified in P. putida KT2440. (A) The
  genes are organized into three units. The products of the ben genes transform benzoate
  into catechol. The enzymes encoded by the cat genes allow the conversion of catechol
  into β-ketoadipate-enol-lactone, while those encoded by the pca genes allow further
  assimilation of this compound into acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, which are fed into
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The point of entry of the products generated
  by the protocatechuate branch of the β-ketoadipate pathway is indicated. (B) Organization
  of the ben, cat, and pca genes. The expression of the benABCD genes requires the
  BenR transcriptional activator and benzoate as an effector, while that of the cat
  genes is regulated by the CatR transcriptional activator, which requires cis,cis-muconate
  as an effector (). The expression of the pcaDC, pcaIJ, and pcaKF genes requires
  the PcaR transcriptional activator and β-ketoadipate as an effector ().
