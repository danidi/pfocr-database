caption: The precursor of myostatin is promyostatin and consists of a propeptide that
  binds to myostatin noncovalently to form an inactive complex. When myostatin is
  activated, it binds to its receptor; activin A bound to the extra cellular domain
  of a type II receptor (ActRIIB), which is present on muscle membranes. In turn ALK4
  or ALK5 phosphorylates intracellular proteins called Smad2/3 and the Smad complex
  translocates into the nucleus and causes changes in gene transcription that ultimately
  result in muscle wasting and cachexia. Akt activity is also inhibited. FOXO becomes
  dephosphorylated and migrates to the nucleus where ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and Atrogen
  1 are synthesized. As a result, muscle proteins are degraded through the ubiquitin
  proteasome pathway.
