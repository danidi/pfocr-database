caption: A hypothetical model of candidate rpr9 gene disrupting the RMRL, Rpg1 and
  root length signaling pathway. Our topmost candidate rpr9 genes are SCF and F-box
  protein coding, associated with ubiquitin mediated protein degradation pathway.
  Rapid phosphorylation of Rpg1 dual kinase protein followed by protein degradation
  is required for Pgt race HKHJ resistance. Similarly, Ubiquitination plays an important
  role in root development and hormone signaling. Thus, we hypothesize rpr9 mutation
  disrupts the Rpg1, RMRL and hormone signaling pathway by inhibiting the possible
  intermediate ubiquitination step resulting in compromised phenotype
