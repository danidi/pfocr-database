caption: Mechanisms proposed for the NETosis in response to Aspergillus fumigatus.
  (A) Recognition of A. fumigatus triggers NETosis by a Mac-1/Src kinase/Syk and class
  I PI3Kδ mechanism, inducing a NET-releasing pathway that requires ROS generation
  by the NADPH oxidase but occurs independently of the PAD4-mediated histone citrullination
  (). (B) A. fumigatus extracts, as well as β-glucans, induce NETosis through a Mac-1
  and PAD4-dependent mechanism (). (C) A. fumigatus opsonized hyphae promote NETosis
  through a NADPH oxidase-independent pathway ().
