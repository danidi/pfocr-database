caption: Overview of the pathogenic model of C. difficile infection (CDI). The upper
  panel (Figure A) displays the dominant role of epigenetic activity and the cross-talk
  interplay mechanisms between Caco-2 cells and C. difficile during the early stage
  of infection. The lower panel (Figure B) shows the molecular and epigenetic activities
  during the late stage of CDI and the outcome of both organisms. The cross marks
  signify the dysfunction or the breakdown of proteins and structures accordingly;
  the solid arrow lines represent the protein-interaction/cellular-response with literature
  support; the dash arrow lines denote the identified/predicted response; the red
  lines denote crucial epigenetic activities; the red dots in the endoplasmic reticulum
  of Caco-2 cell signify misfolded proteins; and the definitions of epigenetic activities
  are the same as those defined in Figure . In (A), the epigenetic activities dominate
  the initialization of host responses toward bacterial invasion. The acetylation/deacetylation
  of heat shock proteins (HSPs) lead to the formation of misfolded proteins, the ubiquitination
  of FPR1 allows pathogen toxins enter Caco-2 cells via endocytosis and then trigger
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, and the glucosylation of GTPases impair
  the homeostasis of cytoskeleton. In this situation, Caco-2 cells utilize DNA damage
  response and autophagy as defense mechanisms, and eliminate pathogens via ROS with
  the promotion of microRNA silencing. Between two stages, the acetylation of CD0663
  and fibronectin 1, and the presence of CD46 and CD1466 serve as the turning points
  of the progression of infection, resulting in enhanced ROS production and severe
  inflammation as shown in (B). The acetylation activity results in the dysfunction
  of HSPs and the assembly of NF-κB complex, inducing not only the production of IL8,
  which recruits neutrophils, but also the apoptosis process of host cells. To avoid
  the recruited phagocytic neutrophils and human-produced ROS, C. difficile cells
  activate the sporulation pathway to transform to endospore.
