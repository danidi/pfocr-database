caption: Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. Folate-activated one-carbons  are
  utilized in the synthesis of purines, thymidylate (dTMP), and the  methylation of
  homocysteine to methionine. Methionine can be converted to a  methyl donor through
  its adenosylation to AdoMet. Mitochondria-derived formate  traverses to the cytoplasm
  where it is incorporated into the folate-activated  one-carbon pool. Nuclear folate
  metabolism occurs through the small  ubiquitin-related modifier-dependent import
  of the de novo  thymidylate synthase pathway from the cytoplasm to the nucleus  (,  ).
  SHMT isozymes are present  in each of these three compartments and function to generate
  single carbons  from the hydroxymethyl group of serine in the form of 5,10-methylene-THF.
  The  one-carbon unit is labeled in boldface.
