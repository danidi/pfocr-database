caption: Model to explain the role of UBE2D3 phosphorylation in the differentiation
  of PrE. The model shows the proposed effect of phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138 by
  Aurora B on signaling through the FGFR1 RTK. The dashed box delineates pathways
  that have been shown in this study to be directly affected by UBE2D3 phosphorylation.
  Activation of FGFR1 by binding of FGF to the receptor triggers a feedback mechanism
  through monoubiquitination of FGFR1 by the CBL E3 ligase (), using UBE2D3 as an
  ubiquitin donor. Monoubiquitination promotes lysosomal localization and degradation
  of FGFR1 following internalization of the activated receptor (). Phosphorylation
  of UBE2D3-S138 by Aurora B downregulates UBE2D3 levels, reducing CBL activity. This
  in turn reduces lysosomal degradation of FGFR1, thereby enhancing FGFR1 signaling
  and promoting PrE differentiation. Signaling through FGFR1 activates the RAS/MEK/ERK
  pathway leading to increased levels of phosphorylated ERK in the nucleus. Activation
  of the ERK pathway has been shown to increase Aurora B expression in melanoma cells
  (). This suggests a potential positive feedback mechanism, whereby ligand-mediated
  activation of FGFR1 would increase Aurora B levels through activation of the ERK
  pathway. This would, in turn, suppress CBL activity by reducing the level of UBE2D3,
  further increasing the level of FGFR1. Reduced CBL activity would also increase
  the level of PDGFRα, which has been shown to promote survival and proliferation
  of PrE ().
