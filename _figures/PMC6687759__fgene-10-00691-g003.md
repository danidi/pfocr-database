caption: Proteoglycans in cancer-predicted pathway. This figure highlights two of
  the four proteoglycans in cancer pathways, chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate
  (CSPG/DSPG) and keratan sulfate (KSPG). These networks show that there are multiple
  genes (orange and yellow boxes) related to cytokine signaling and viral entry that
  are being targeted for inhibition that would cause host dysregulation and impair
  the ability to properly respond or maintain homeostasis during infection. Additionally,
  genes shown in previous HP-PRRSV transcriptome studies to be downregulated are shown
  to be targets of the upregulated miRNAs. DCN and LUM are DAMPs, which lead to downregulation
  of inflammatory DAMP signals and downstream TGF-Beta signaling, which is involved
  in anti-viral immunity.  shows upregulated miRNAs only from all time points. Figure
  created using Mirpath V3 software and adapted for inclusion. Figure based on KEGG
  pathways. Figure legend refers to if gene in pathway has 1 (yellow) or >1 (orange)
  miRNAs targeting it.
