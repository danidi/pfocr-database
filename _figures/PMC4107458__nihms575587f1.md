caption: Schematic diagram of neutrophil derived S100a8/S100a9 protein potentially
  contributing hypertensive cardiac fibrosis induced by Ang II. Induction and secretion
  of S100a8/a9 from activated neutrophils plays a central role in triggering NFkB
  pathway and subsequent inflammatory responses in cardiac fibroblasts via RAGE. Blockade
  of S100a8/S100a9 function by anti-S100a9 antibody attenuates the inflammatory response
  and cardiac fibrosis. MPO indicates myeloperoxidase; RAGE, receptor for advanced
  glycation end products; TLR-4, Toll-like receptor 4; NFkB, nuclear factor-kB; and
  MMP-9, matrix metalloprotease-9.
