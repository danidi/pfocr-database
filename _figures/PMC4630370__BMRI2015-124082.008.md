caption: 'Proposed mechanism for NF-κB signaling inhibition mediated by the antitumor
  peptide CIGB-552. Different proteins, which regulate NF-κB pathway, were differentially
  modulated by CIGB-552 treatment (TAX1BP1, SKP1, PSMA2/A2, and PSMA7/A7). In addition,
  the CIGB-552 target profile includes proteins that regulate RelA function (ETHE1,
  SETD7, and MAPK signaling: MAP2K6, MAPK14). Such interactions ultimately could repress
  the transcription of NF-κB target genes. Altogether, by modulating the function
  of these proteins CIGB-552 could inhibit cell proliferation and induces apoptosis
  of tumor cells.'
