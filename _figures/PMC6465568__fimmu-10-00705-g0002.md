caption: Signal crosstalk in NF-κB transcriptional regulation. (Left) An example of
  a simplified NF-κB signaling model wherein a pathogen is recognized by a PRR (e.g.,
  TLR4), which (1) signals through MyD88 to (2) initiate NF-κB-mediated transcription
  and (3) subsequent cytokine production. (Right) A more accurate model of NF-κB signaling
  wherein a pathogen is recognized by a PRR (e.g., TLR4) on the surface of the cell,
  leading to (2) NF-κB activation via MyD88. (4) Subsequently, the pathogen is brought
  into a sub-cellular compartment where it is sensed by an alternate PRR (or, in the
  case of TLR4, the same PRR but in a new sub-cellular context) which signals through
  a second adaptor TRIF (5), leading to the activation of more NF-κB dimers as well
  as other transcription factors, such as IRF3, leading to type I IFN production,
  and AP-1, which is activated via the MAPK pathway. Upon translocation to the nucleus,
  these multiple transcription factors act to synergize or antagonize each other,
  more precisely tailoring the inflammatory response to the pathogen. (6) In this
  example, NF-κB and AP-1, each activated by multiple inputs, together produce significantly
  greater amounts of TNF than singly activated NF-κB on its own. (7) It should be
  noted that, while both MyD88 and TRIF are known to activate MAPKs, it remains unclear
  what their relative contributions are in regard to AP-1 activation and TNF production
  in the context of LPS stimulation.
