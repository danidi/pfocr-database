caption: Model for signaling in neutrophils to induce NETosis after Entamoeba histolytica
  engagement. In human neutrophils, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) can directly
  activate (dashed arrows) protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn leads to activation
  of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. These kinases finally promote NETs formation. PKC is
  also required for NADPH-oxidase activation to form reactive oxygen species, which
  are required for NETs formation after PMA stimulation. In contrast, E. histolytica
  trophozoites are recognized by neutrophils via a, yet unknown, receptor, which connects
  to the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Also the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is activated
  to promote NETs formation. The antibody receptor FcγRIIIb also induces NETs formation
  via spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase
  1 (TAK1), which connects to MEK (Alemán et al., ). Other signaling molecules (not
  shown), such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and p38 MAP kinase are not
  involved in E. histolytica signaling to NETs formation.
