caption: Biogenesis and functions of miRNA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are usually transcribed
  by polymerase II in the nucleus to generate primary microRNAs (pri-miRNA) transcripts.
  In the canonical pathway, the maturation of miRNAs is then performed by the microprocessor
  complex comprising of DROSHA, RNase III, and DCGR8. The microprocessor complex cleaves
  both strands of pri-miRNAs near the base of the primary stem loop, generating pre-miRNAs.
  Following cleavage, pre-miRNAs are actively transported from the nucleus to the
  cytoplasm by the Exportin 5/Ran-GTP complex. In the cytoplasm, RNase III endonuclease
  Dicer recognizes and cleaves pre-miRNA near the terminal loop, releasing a small
  RNA duplex. Subsequently, either strand (-5p or -3p) of the miRNA duplex is loaded
  into an AGO protein to form a miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Functionally,
  miRNAs direct the miRISC complex to target genes and modulate its expression by
  promoting either mRNA degradation and/or translation inhibition in the cytoplasm.
  The AGO protein of miRISC complex binds GW182 family proteins, which serve as scaffolds
  for multiple proteins including PAN2/3, and CCR4-NOT complexes. While the miRISC
  complex hinders the binding of eIF4F complex, PAN2/3 and CCR4-NOT mediate the poly(A)
  deadenylation of target mRNAs. The target mRNA is further decapped by a decapping
  complex and subjected to degradation via the exoribonuclease XRN1. In addition,
  the miRISC complex can be transported into the nucleus via Importin 8/RAN-GTP complex
  and binds to target gene promoters to regulate its transcription.
