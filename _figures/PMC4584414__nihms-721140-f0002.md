caption: Antiviral activities of Dicers(A) Domain architectures of Dicers from Drosophila
  melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, and human. Dicer-1 has the truncated Hel1
  (indicated by X), thus lacking the functional helicase property.(B) Antiviral activities
  of Drosophila Dicer-2. Dicer-2 functions as an antiviral effector molecule by cleaving
  viral dsRNA upon recognition. At the same time, it functions as a PRR-like sensor
  by having the cleavage product, siRNA, act as a signal to activate the downstream
  effector, RISC, for gene silencing and the TRAF-Rel2 signaling pathway for expression
  of Vago. Vago is then secreted and systemically spread to uninfected cells to establish
  the antiviral response.
