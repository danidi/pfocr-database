caption: Insulin signaling pathway analysis in subordinate (SUB) and dominant (DOM)
  mice fed standard diet compared to controls (CON), based on PCR data from tissues
  shown in . Representation of insulin pathway in liver, skeletal muscle, and pWAT.
  Sub-pathways significantly upregulated in the condition of interest (SUB or DOM)
  compared to CON are represented with all this group of nodes in red. Sub-pathways
  significantly downregulated are represented with all the nodes in blue. SUB mice
  showed a downregulation in all the sub-pathways in the insulin pathway for both
  liver and muscle. In contrast DOM showed only an upregulation of glycolysis in skeletal
  muscle, and glycolysis and lipogenesis in liver. Both SUB and DOM mice showed an
  upregulated antilipolysis sub-pathway in pWAT. Further details on the representation
  of the pathway analysis are in Figure S4. This figure will be best described with
  colors at the online version.
