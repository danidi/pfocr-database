caption: Fig. 8. Steps in the regulation of apoptosis by PKCδ. (1) PKCδ is translocated
  to the nucleus. We have shown previously that expression of KN PKCδ inhibits an
  early event in the apoptotic pathway that occurs at, or prior to, the mitochondria
  (). Our current studies suggest that this PKCδ-dependent event occurs in the nucleus,
  and that it may regulate entry into the apoptotic pathway. We show that PKCδ is
  translocated into the nucleus during apoptosis, and that nuclear PKCδ activity is
  required for apoptosis. (2) PKCδ functions in the nucleus to regulate apoptosis.
  Expression of GFP–CFδ, which localizes to the nucleus, induces apoptosis, whereas
  nuclear expression of GFP–KN-CFδ blocks apoptosis. These studies suggest that nuclear
  PKCδ can regulate the cytosolic apoptotic machinery, resulting in caspase activation
  and DNA fragmentation. One possibility is that nuclear PKCδ may regulate the expression
  or activity of key apoptotic molecules which act at, or upstream of the mitochondria.
  (3) Caspase cleavage of PKCδ facilitates nuclear translocation and amplifies the
  apoptotic pathway. Our data show that caspase cleavage of PKCδ facilitates its nuclear
  import, hence caspase cleavage of PKCδ may function to amplify the apoptotic response
  by enabling rapid import of PKCδ into the nucleus of apoptotic cells.
