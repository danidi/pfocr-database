caption: Pathway of succinate accumulation during ischemia/reperfusion. Despite minor
  production via regular Krebs cycle - which is diminished due to excessive synthesis
  of NADH -, the reverse activity of succinate dehydrogenase has been shown to be
  the leading cause of succinate increase during ischemia. The sources of fumarate,
  which is then reduced into succinate, are mainly the Purine Nucleotide cycle – shown
  on the left - and the Malate/Aspartate Shuttle – similar to the Krebs cycle to run
  in reverse, which is favored by high levels of NADH
