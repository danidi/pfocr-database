caption: Major apoptotic pathways in SGNs induced by oubain treatment. Genes that
  respond to intrinsic stimulation are believed to be involved in the mitochondrial
  pathway, and two major factors appear to be important, namely cytochrome C and apoptosis
  inducing factor (AIF). The pathway began with Caspase-9 activation, which was followed
  by executioner Caspases that resulted in proteolytic activity and nuclear damage
  (DNA fragmentation). The extrinsic pathway-responding genes were triggered first
  by cell-surface occupation of receptors belonging to the TNF/TNF R superfamily,
  which activate Fas causing the recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death
  domain (FADD). Then, Caspase-8 cleaves other pro-Caspases, which effectively initiates
  a Caspase cascade that ultimately drives apoptosis. Caspase-8 activation can also
  activate Bak, Bid, and Bax, which enhance mitochondrial damage and promote leakage
  of cytochrome C. Since many groups of genes are involved in the intrinsic and extrinsic
  pathways, many of which belong to the p53 superfamily, it was inevitable that the
  p53 signaling pathway was involved in ouabain-induced apoptosis.
