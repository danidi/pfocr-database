caption: Molecular pathways affected by Gcm. (A) Hedgehog signaling pathway. (B) JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway. (C) Notch signaling pathway. The proteins and genes in black
  and red are targeted by Gcm, according to the DamID screen. The genes in red were
  previously characterized as downstream targets of Gcm, and underlined genes were
  validated by qPCR in FACS-sorted S2 cells in this study. The proteins in gray are
  part of the pathway but are not targeted by Gcm.
