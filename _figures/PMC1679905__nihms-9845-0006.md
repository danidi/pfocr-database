caption: The temporal dynamics of signalling networks is described by ordinary differential
  equations, which are known as chemical kinetics equations and are derived similarly
  to the Michaelis-Menten equation, familiar to any biologist. The derivation begins
  with listing all chemical transformations thereby providing a kinetic scheme of
  a pathway. , part A shows a simplified scheme of the signalling routes emanating
  from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), including the Shc, Grb2-SOS, GAP
  and phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) signalling branches, and the RasGDP/RasGTP circuit
  (phosphorylated proteins are indicated by added “P” after protein name, R is EGFR,
  molecules within complexes are abbreviated, and the designations are given in Supplementary
  Table S2). The scheme is translated into differential equations, one for each time-dependent
  molecular species. The rate of the concentration change is the sum of the reaction
  rates producing a given species minus the sum of consuming rates. Numerical integration
  (simulations) gives the time-course of the concentrations (see , parts B and C where
  EGF-induced responses were simulated using the scheme shown in part A,).
