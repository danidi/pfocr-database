caption: Proposed mechanism of this study. The proposed mechanism of the present study
  is that compressive force, applied on brain cancer cells, could activate MEK1/Erk1
  pathway through EGFR/Ras/Raf activation, which as it is widely known, is just upstream
  of MEK1. Subsequently, MEK1/Erk1 could regulate the expression of several migration-related
  genes including GDF15, in order to re-organize the compression-disrupted actin cytoskeleton,
  which eventually facilitates cell migration. Finally, through a possible negative
  feedback loop, GDF15 could bind to its receptor and then suppress MEK1/Erk1 activation
  in order to regulate its levels in compressed cells. In this diagram, the arrows
  are of different width, so that thick arrows indicate a stronger compression-induced
  effect in the less aggressive cells, while thin arrows indicate a weaker effect
  in the highly aggressive cells, which could permit a possible tumor suppressing
  pathway to hinder the compression-induced MEK1/Erk1 mediated migratory effect.
