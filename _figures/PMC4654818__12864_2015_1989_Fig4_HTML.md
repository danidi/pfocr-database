caption: A drive for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis with low-level spore wall
  production. The heatmap shows the levels of expression of genes within the chitin
  biosynthesis pathway, with blue representing low levels of expression and red as
  high. GFA1, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase; GNA1, glucosamine-6-phosphate
  N-acetyltransferase 1; UGP1, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase; PCM, phosphoacetylglucosamine
  mutase; CHS, chitin synthase; CDA, chitin deacetylase; ACS, acetyl-CoA synthetase.
  The significantly lower expression levels of chitin synthases compared to the rest
  of the pathway leading to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine production suggest that chitin
  synthesis is not very active in this sample, consistent with the low expression
  of other enzymes involved in spore wall formation
