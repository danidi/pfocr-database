caption: 'Modulation of phenotype and function of colonic macrophages as the main
  mechanism for mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (MSC-EV)-based
  attenuation of ulcerative colitis: MSC-EVs reduced cleavage of caspase-3, -8 and
  -9 and alleviated release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from injured
  gut epithelial cells, resulting in attenuated activation of NF-κB signaling pathway
  in colon macrophages. Through the delivery of miR-146a, MSC-EVs inhibited TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression, down-regulated
  phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and inhibited generation of inflammatory M1 phenotype
  in macrophages, which was manifested by down-regulated expression of inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS), significantly reduced production of nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory
  cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and chemokines (CCL-17 and CCL-24) and resulted in
  reduced influx of circulating neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes in the inflamed
  gut. Additionally, MSC-EVs induced polarization of colon macrophages in anti-inflammatory
  M2 phenotype, manifested by increased secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines TGF-β
  and IL-10 and alleviation of colitis.'
