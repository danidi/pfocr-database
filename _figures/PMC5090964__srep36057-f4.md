caption: In spring when female jerboas are under negative energetic balance, elevated
  level of kisspeptin (Kp) stimulates the reproductive axis by activating GnRH neurons
  and inhibits food intake via activation of POMC neurons and inhibition of RFRP-3
  neurons, the latter exerting an increase in orexigenic Npy and a decrease in anorexigenic
  Pomc. Of note, the orexigenic effect of RFRP-3 is found independent of season.
