caption: Schematic representation of carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in sweet orange
  (Citrus sinensis) fruit indicating main enzymes involved in carotenoid compositional
  changes during ripening. The predominant flux in immature and full ripe fruit tissues
  is indicated in green and red arrows, respectively. The discontinuous arrow indicates
  a enzymatic step not yet characterized. The structure of the main carotenoids involved
  in sweet orange fruit pigmentation is background colored. Representative pictures
  of ‘Pinalate’ sweet orange mutant and its parental genotype ‘Navelate’ are positioned
  in the pathway close to the most abundant carotenoid in mature fruit tissues. PSY,
  phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; Z-ISO, 15-cis-ζ-carotene isomerase;
  ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; CRTISO, lycopene isomerase; βLCY1, lycopene β-cyclase
  1; βLCY2, chromoplast-specific lycopene β-cyclase2; εLCY, lycopene ε-cyclase; CYP97A
  and CYP97C, heme-containing cytochrome P450 hydroxylases; βCHX, non-heme β-carotene
  hydroxylase; ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase; CCD4b, carotenoid
  cleavage dioxygenase type 4; 9-Z-ISO, 9-Z-violaxanthin isomerase. GGPP, Geranyl
  geranyl pyrophosphate. Carotenoid structure images were obtained from http://carotenoiddb.jp/
