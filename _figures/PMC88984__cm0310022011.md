caption: 'Enzymatic pathway for the synthesis of N-acetylgalactosamine, the major
  carbohydrate portion of the cyst wall. Activities for all these enzymes have been
  shown in reference () in a mixture of vegetative and encysting trophozoites, and
  a proposed pathway was presented. The enzymes are labeled as follows: 1, glucosamine-6-phosphate-isomerase
  (, , ); 2, glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetylase; 3, phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase;
  4, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (, ); 5, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4′
  epimerase.'
