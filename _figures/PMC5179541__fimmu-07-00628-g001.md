caption: Interferon (IFN)-λ polymorphisms are associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV)
  spontaneous resolution and response to treatment. (A) In HCV acutely infected individuals,
  IFN-λ3 rs12979860 CC and IFN-λ4 rs368234815 TT favorable alleles are strongly associated
  with spontaneous resolution. Hepatocyte infection triggers the production of IFN-λ
  that then induce the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).
  In individuals carrying the favorable alleles, production of IFN-λ is moderate,
  and the ISGs induction is more focused, leading to an effective antiviral state
  and increased rate of spontaneous resolution of infection. On the other hand, carriers
  of the unfavorable alleles exhibit stronger IFN-λ production and a more diverse
  array of ISGs can be detected. This will also induce the expression of USP18, an
  inhibitor of the IFN signaling pathway, leading to an impaired antiviral state and
  an increased rate of chronic HCV infection. (B) In chronically infected individuals
  carrying the favorable allele, basal level of IFN-λ and ISGs is relatively low and
  treatment with IFN-α can induce a potent antiviral state leading to viral clearance
  or SVR. In individuals carrying the unfavorable allele, a high basal level of IFN-λ,
  ISGs, and USP18 will lead to a refractory state and unresponsiveness to the IFN-α
  treatment and failure to clear the infection.
