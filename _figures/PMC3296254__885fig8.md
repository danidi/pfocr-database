caption: Transcriptional regulation of biosynthetic pathways by metabolic intermediates.
  The expression of genes encoding catalytic components in the lysine (green), leucine
  (red), pyrimidine (blue), and purine (black) is controlled by pathway-specific transcription
  factors that induce transcription upon binding a metabolic intermediate of the pathway.
  In these pathways, feedback inhibition by the end product of the first and committing
  step of the pathway provides the means to decrease the production of the inducer
  and cause the apparent repression of the pathway. This dual-sensing mechanism permits
  fine-tuning of biosynthetic pathways by integrating both the final end-product concentration,
  whether synthesized or transported into cells via salvage mechanisms, and the flux
  in the pathway (as sensed via the concentration of strategic metabolic intermediates).
