caption: Figure 2. Hedgehog and Wnt Signaling in Kidney, Limb, and Neural Tube. A
  cartoon to show the effects of the Wnt signaling pathway on renal cystic disease,
  of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in the developing limb, and of both pathways in the
  neural tube. In the kidney, the balance between canonical (β-catenin dependent)
  and non-canonical Wnt signaling must be maintained; dysregulation of either branch,
  whether up- or downregulation, leads to development of cysts. In the limb bud, a
  gradient of Hh signaling is required to pattern the digits; where upregulation of
  Hh occurs, the gradient is expanded and additional digits are specified whereas
  when Hh is downregulated, the gradient becomes restricted and a reduced number of
  digits is specified. In the neural tube, a Wnt (and, to perhaps a greater extent,
  BMP) gradient is involved in dorsal cell fate determination; the gradient is counteracted
  by a ventral Hh gradient. Up- or downregulation of either pathway perturbs this
  balance and affects axis specification in the developing neural tube. Wnt signaling
  also has important effects on neuronal migration in the developing brain, leading
  to numerous other CNS effects.
