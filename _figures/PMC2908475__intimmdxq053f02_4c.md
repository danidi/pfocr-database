caption: Model of the intracellular signaling network regulating T-cell trafficking
  and differentiation. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are activated following engagement
  of the TCR with cognate peptide antigen presented in the context of MHC-I (p–MHCI).
  TCR triggering together with inflammatory cytokines of the γc and IL-12 families
  can regulate T-cell trafficking and differentiation largely through the PI3K pathway.
  IL-2 signaling appears to be very central in this process as both TCR engagement
  and IL-12-mediated signaling enhance CD25 expression, whereas IL-21-mediated signaling
  inhibits CD25 expression. In terms of PI3K activation, both IL-2 and IL-12 strongly
  activate PI3K, whereas IL-15 and IL-21 weakly activate the PI3K pathway. Strong
  activation of PI3K results in conversion of PI(4,5)P2 into PI(3,4,5)P3. Accumulation
  of PI(3,4,5)P3 results in the recruitment of both PKB/Akt and PDK1 to the cell membrane.
  PDK1 can then phosphorylate PKB/Akt, resulting in its activation. PKB can then phosphorylate
  Foxo proteins, which results in their exclusion from the nucleus and degradation,
  which ultimately results in cells being unable to express Foxo target genes, such
  as Il7ra and Klf2. Inhibition of Foxo-dependent expression of Klf2 will also alter
  expression of Klf2 target genes, such as Sell (L-selectin/CD62L), Edg1 (S1P1) and
  Ccr7. PKB can also activate the mTORC1 complex. Activation of mTOR is known to enhance
  T-bet expression while repressing Eomes expression, which can regulate the fate
  of the responding CD8+ T cell, but whether Blimp1 or Bcl6 expression is altered
  by mTOR remains unresolved; furthermore, mTORC1 activity directly regulates Klf2
  function. The mTORC1 complex can also be regulated by AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)
  activity, which inhibits mTORC1 activity. AMPK is a nutrient-sensing pathway that
  is activated by TNF receptor associated factor 6. Interestingly, rapamycin and metformin
  can have adjuvant-like functions by targeting the mTORC1 complex and AMPK, respectively.
