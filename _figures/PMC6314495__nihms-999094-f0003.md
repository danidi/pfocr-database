caption: a | In immature dendritic cells (DCs), up to 75% of all MHC class II molecules
  reside in lysosome-like antigen-processing compartments. It is in these compartments
  that peptide–MHC class II complexes are generated (albeit slowly in immature DCs).
  The predominant intracellular localization of MHC class II in immature DCs is due
  to robust synthesis of invariant chain (Ii)–MHC class II complexes and the movement
  of these complexes to antigen-processing compartments. Although some peptide–MHC
  class II complexes formed in these compartments do traffic to the plasma membrane,
  much of the MHC class II that is synthesized in immature DCs is degraded in lysosomes.
  Maturation of DCs by pathogen uptake and/or Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation
  leads a transient burst in Ii–MHC class II biosynthesis, efficient generation of
  peptide–MHC class II complexes that traffic to the plasma membrane in tubular endosomes
  and degradation of residual MHC class II present in lysosomes. Fully mature conventional
  DCs do not synthesize Ii–MHC class II and therefore express very little MHC class
  II in antigen-processing compartments. Arrow thickness indicates prominence of a
  particular pathway and dashed arrows indicate minor pathways. In mature DCs, any
  internalized MHC class II is simply recycled to the plasma membrane where peptide–MHC
  class II complexes can interact with naive antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Note that
  after DC activation, structures such as antigen-processing compartments still exist
  in the mature DC, but peptide–MHC class II complexes do not accumulate in these
  compartments. b | In resting B cells, large amounts of MHC class II are present
  on the plasma membrane and in peripheral early endosomal vesicles. Binding of antigen
  to the B cell receptor (BCR) triggers BCR endocytosis and recruits the peripheral
  MHC class II-containing vesicles towards the antigen–BCR-containing lysosome-like
  antigen-processing compartments. Internalized antigen is processed into peptides
  in these compartments and the resulting peptide–MHC class II complexes traffic to
  the plasma membrane for recognition by primed antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. TCR,
  T cell receptor.
