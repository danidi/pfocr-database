caption: Scheme showing probable mechanism by which diabetogenic viruses, streptozotocin
  (STZ), and alloxan induce the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM).
  The same mechanism may occur in non-obese diabetic (NOD) and other animals that
  are known to develop type 1 DM. Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an
  agonist of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), inhibits type 1 DM. LPS administered to
  NOD mice during the prediabetic state delays the onset and decreases the incidence
  of diabetes. A multiple-injection protocol of LPS is more effective than a single
  LPS intervention. LPS administration suppresses spleen T lymphocyte proliferation,
  increases the generation of T regulatory cells [indicated as (+) in the figure],
  and reduces the synthesis of T-helper 1 pro-inflammatory cytokines [indicated as
  (−) in the figure], and downregulates TLR-4 and its downstream MyD88-dependent signaling
  pathway and enhances IL-4 and IL-10. Multiple injections of LPS induce tolerogenic
  dendritic cell (DC) subset with low TLR-4 expression and, thus, prevent development
  of type 1 DM in NOD diabetic mice see text, Figure , and Wang et al. (). Alloxan
  and STZ and other diabetogenic molecules, including viruses, may block activity
  of desaturases and, thus, decrease the formation of arachidonic acid, eicosapentaneoic
  acid, and docosahexaenoic acid that, in turn, leads to deficiency of lipoxins, resolvins,
  protectins, and maresins, potent anti-inflammatory substances. Polyunsaturated fatty
  acid and their products may alter gut microbiota and regulate Treg and Teff cells.
  Bioactive lipids inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and possess cytoprotective
  actions that may explain their ability to prevent type 1 DM (see Figures –).
