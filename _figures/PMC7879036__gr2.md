caption: 'Catabolism and salvage pathway of purine nucleotides and physiologic roles
  of uric acid.AMP, GMP, IMP and XMP are the monophosphate nucleotides of adenine,
  guanine, hypoxanthine and xanthine, respectively. The purine salvage pathways are
  indicated with red arrows. The reactions catalyzed by xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR)
  are indicated with yellow arrows and the boxes corresponding to irreversible products
  are colored in green []. The physiologic functions of uric acid are reported: 1.
  Uric acid supports blood pressure, even in the absence of an adequate dietary intake
  of salt, counteracting the nitric oxide-induced vasodilation, increasing cyclooxygenase-2
  expression and activating the renin-angiotensin system []. 2. Uric acid is a free
  radical scavenger that takes part in the non-enzymatic defense system against oxidative
  stress in biological fluids. The antioxidant activity of uric acid plays an essential
  function in preventing cancer, cardiovascular diseases [] and other pathological
  conditions []. Indeed, a correlation has been proposed in different species between
  levels of uricemia and their life expectancy []. 3. During tissue injury, intracellular
  uric acid is released from dead cells, stimulating macrophages and inducing the
  inflammatory response by acting as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
  []. 4. Uric acid promotes fat accumulation, which can help to overcome periods of
  starvation, as well as hepatic gluconeogenesis, thus elevating blood sugar [,].'
