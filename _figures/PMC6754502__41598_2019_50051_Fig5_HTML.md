caption: Broiler thymus predicted to have less cell migration in response to the Thermoneutral + LPS
  treatment compared to Fayoumi. IPA (QIAGEN, Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis)
  identified a subset of genes (red = increased, green = decreased) regulated by TNF
  and predicted to inhibit (z-score ≤ −2.0) cell migration functions. Predicted relationships
  include inhibition (blue dashed line), not conclusive (grey dashed line) and inconsistent
  (yellow dashed line). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
  tumour necrosis factor (TNF).
