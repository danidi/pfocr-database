caption: 'Intracellular signaling pathways regulating growth. PI3K/TOR, Hippo, and
  MAPK pathways regulate growth by modulating protein translation, cell cycle progression,
  and apoptosis. Schematic of pathways showing key components. Genes highlighted in
  red are mutated in human genetic syndromes that manifest growth deficiency or overgrowth.
  (A) Growth hormone acts systemically through its regulation of IGF-1, which activates
  phosphotidyl-inosine-3 kinase (PI3K) by binding the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Subsequent
  activation of downstream kinases results in increased protein translation and ribosome
  biosynthesis, leading to cellular growth. The pathway is inhibited by the phosphatase
  PTEN and integrates multiple other signals, such as nutrient/energy levels, through
  the master kinase target of rapamycin (TOR). TOR activates the ribosomal S6 kinase
  and facilitates eIF4E activity to promote translation and transcription initiation.
  (B) The Hippo pathway restricts growth to control organ size and prevent tissue
  overgrowth and tumorigenesis. The pathway is currently best defined in Drosophila,
  where the cell polarity protein Crumbs (Crb) and the protocadherins Fat and Dachsous
  (Ds) activate Hippo kinase, which in turn activates Warts kinase. The signaling
  cascade negatively regulates the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) by retaining
  Yki in the cytoplasm. This restricts cell proliferation and promotes cell death,
  as Yki promotes G1 progression over G0 cell cycle exit through transcriptional up-regulation
  of Cyclin E (CycE) and the E2F transcription factor. Yki also has an anti-apoptotic
  effect by inducing inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP). The core pathway is conserved
  in mammals: Mst1/2 (Hippo), Lats (Warts), and Yap (Yki). Homologs to Fat and Ds
  or the target gene bantam have not yet been identified in mammals. (C) The MAPK
  (ERK) signaling cascade transduces mitogen signals, driving cellular proliferation
  by promoting G1-to-S-phase progression (). Downstream, ERK kinase activates the
  proproliferative transcription factors Myc and E2F as well as decreases levels of
  the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27. Rather than being entirely discrete
  signaling pathways, these three signaling pathways (A–C) overlap; for instance,
  Akt inhibits Hippo activity, while ERK phosphorylates, and thus activates, TOR.'
