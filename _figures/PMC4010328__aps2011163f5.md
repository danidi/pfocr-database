caption: TOB1 was involved in regulation of tumor growth and metastasis via the PI3K/PTEN
  signaling pathway. The binding of EGF to the corresponding EGF receptors activates
  PI3K and downstream signaling pathways, including Akt and ERK/p38 MAPK, leading
  to the activation of NF-κB gene expression. Consequently, the expression of cyclin
  D1 and MMPs are increased, resulting in the promotion of lung cancer tumorigenesis
  and metastasis. Despite its activation of NF-κB, Akt can also inhibit β-catenin
  expression, which plays an important role in mediating cellular adhesion together
  with α- and γ-catenin/cadherin complexes. In the present study, TOB1 was identified
  as a negative regulator of EGFR expression, increasing the expression of PTEN, which
  functions as the central negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway in controlling
  tumorigenesis and metastasis. The protein–protein interaction between TOB1 and PTEN
  was detected for the first time in cultured lung cancer cells; hence, TOB1 may be
  a regulator of PTEN activity.
