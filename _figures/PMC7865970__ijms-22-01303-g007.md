caption: Proposed model of the flowering regulatory pathway controlled by RFS. RFS
  downregulates Ghd7 in LDs and upregulates Ehd1 in LD and SD conditions to induce
  the floral transition. Arrows represent upregulation, and lines ending with bars
  represent downregulation. Solid and dashed lines indicate direct and indirect regulation,
  respectively.
