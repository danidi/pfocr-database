caption: Diagrammatic representation of the signalling pathways activated in the unfolded
  protein response following ER stress. The sensor molecules, PKR-like endoplasmic
  reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring 1 (Ire1) and activating transcription
  factor 6 (ATF6), are transmembrane proteins normally held inactive by the binding
  of GRP78/BiP, but are released when the GRP78 preferentially binds to misfolded
  proteins accumulating in the ER lumen. The UPR aims to restore homeostasis within
  the ER, but there are also links to the inflammatory response through the Ire1 pathway
  and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2).
