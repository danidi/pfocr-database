caption: 'Overall strategy used in this study. a To produce tyrosine from acetate,
  the SCK1 strain, with amplification of the pathway from PEP to tyrosine, was used
  []. To further amplify the linear pathway from acetate to PEP, acs (encoding acetyl-CoA
  synthetase) and pck (encoding phosphoenolpyruvate synthase) were overexpressed.
  Thereafter, the glyoxylate cycle pathway was precisely controlled by varying the
  expression of aceA (encoding isocitrate lyase). b A schematic showing the pathway
  optimization strategy. Acetyl-CoA produced from acetate can be metabolized via two
  different pathways: oxidation into CO2 and generation of ATP and NADH via TCA cycle,
  or assimilation as metabolites and cell biomass via the glyoxylate cycle. Replenishment
  of precursors (PEP from OAA) and energy consumption for tyrosine production should
  be considered for efficient tyrosine production. This can be implemented by precise
  control of the glyoxylate cycle. OAA oxaloacetate, CIT citrate, ICT isocitrate,
  α-KG α-ketoglutarate, SUC succinate, MAL malate, GLY glyoxylate, PEP phosphoenolpyruvate,
  G-6-P glucose-6-phosphate, E-4-P erythrose-4-phosphate, DHAP dihydroxyacetone phosphate,
