caption: 'Schematic representation of the engineering strategies for enhanced lycopene
  production in S. cerevisiae. a The engineered lycopene biosynthetic pathway in S.
  cerevisiae. Genetic modifications are noted by thick arrows. Red arrows indicate
  the heterologous lycopene biosynthetic pathway consisting of CrtE, CrtB and CrtI,
  which starts either from FPP (solid arrow) or directly from IPP and DMAPP (dashed
  arrow). The enzyme overexpressed in the described lycopene-producing strain is highlighted
  in blue. b Construction of plasmids and integration modules. c The rationale of
  experiment design: combinatorial engineering of host cell and heterologous pathway'
