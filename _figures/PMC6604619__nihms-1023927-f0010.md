caption: Functions of ACSL1 in hepatic and extra-hepatic tissues and its role in maintaining
  hepatic cholesterol homeostasis.ACSL1 plays critical roles in catabolic pathway
  of FA metabolism to produce energy in extra hepatic metabolic tissues such as heart;
  in liver tissue, ACSL1 channels fatty acyl-CoA into anabolic pathways for synthesis
  of TAG, PL, ceramide, and the newly identified bile acids (left panel). Transcription
  of Acsl1 is upregulated by SREBP2 and downregulated by FXR. ACSL1 generates fatty
  acyl-CoA substrates that can be utilized in CE synthesis and this pathway is induced
  by SREBP2. Hypothetically, some ACSL1 produced acyl-CoA species might serve as endogenous
  ligands for PPARα to upregulate the expression of its target genes involved in BA
  synthesis including Cyp8b1 to convert cholesterol into BA. Increased hepatic BA
  concentrations activate FXR as a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit Acsl1 expression
  to repress BA synthesis (right panel).
