caption: (A) IL-33 is released by secretion from stressed cells (17,18, 25) or cell
  death/damage [], where it can target ST2+ immune cells, including DC, Treg, and
  ILC2. In the absence of (B) non-self molecule (i.e. bacteria or alloantigen [, ],
  IL-33 drives a regulation and reparative pathway. In this pathway DC are stimulated
  to secrete IL-2, which works with IL-33 to support Treg proliferation []. Expansion
  of the Treg pool would be expected to suppress inflammation and related T cell response.
  Likewise, IL-33 stimulation of both ILC2 and Treg induces their expression of Areg,
  which can facilitate tissue repair [, ]. In the presence of non-self, IL-33 can
  contribute to a pro-inflammatory pathway. Specifically, DC are stimulated to secrete
  IL-12, which promotes a Th1 response, but also up-regulates ST2 on CD8. CD8 expression
  of ST2 allows IL-33 to augment their production of Type 1 cytokines []. Likewise,
  IL-23 directly counteracts the IL-33-driven function of ST2+ Treg [].
