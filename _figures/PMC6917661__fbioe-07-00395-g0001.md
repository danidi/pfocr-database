caption: Schematic of the primary and secondary phases of hemostasis. (A) Initiation
  of hemostasis by an injury to a blood vessel. (B) Illustrates three phases of initiation,
  amplification (platelet activation happens during the initiation phase, and is probably
  mediated through multiple platelet signaling pathways and thrombin), and propagation
  triggered by extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Extrinsic pathway is triggered by
  tissue factor (TF)-activated coagulation factor VII (fVIIa) and consequently TF-fVIIa
  complex triggers Ca++ (calcium) ion-dependent enzymatic reactions in response to
  injury of blood vessels composed of endothelial cells and the vessel wall. Intrinsic
  pathway also is initiated by contact with collagen and XII will be activated as
  XIIa (a = activated). When XIIa is present, factor XI will be activated. Then, XIa
  will activate factor IX. Also, factor Xia together with factor VIII will convert
  factor X into Xa. Finally, Xa will activate the Prothrombin-activator; triggering
  the Common Coagulation Pathway. Von Willebrand factors (vWFs) bind factor VIII,
  which is a key clotting protein, and it helps in forming a platelet plug during
  the clotting process. (C) TEG signal at the bottom shows the changes in the viscoelastic
  properties vs. time. Reaction time (R) represents delay time from test initiation
  until beginning of fibrin formation, measured as an increase in amplitude of 2 mm.
  The clotting time (K) is the time to clot formation, measured from the end of R
  until an amplitude of 20 mm is reached. The angle (a) represents the kinetic of
  fibrin accumulation and bonding. Maximum amplitude (MA) represents clot strength.
