caption: An ambivalence model of PI3K/AKT/SOX2 signaling and DNA damage control in
  various stem cell conditions. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is a versatile molecular
  module that branches into intertwined downstream relays, each of them linked to
  cognate cell biological outputs such as cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and
  stem cell maintenance. For comprehensiveness, each relay is represented by a select
  number of key constituents and critical intermediary nodes. In particular, the pluripotency
  factors SOX2, OCT4, and Nanog are illustrated as mediators of stemness (grey), BAX,
  BAD, and BIM as examples of apoptosis regulators (green), p21 and CDK2 for cell
  cycle control (purple), and ARF, MDM2, and p53 as an intermediate relay linked to
  DNA damage control (yellow). The interplay of these modules is adaptively tailored
  to physiological requirements and thus varies between individual stem cell conditions.
  Stem cell dormancy (left) is primarily characterized by self-sustained maintenance
  signaling and an overall cell cycle arrest that compromises stringent DNA surveillance
  but facilitates apoptosis as an alternative maintenance strategy for a pristine
  stem cell pool. Proliferative stem cell settings (center), are characterized by
  synergist functional effects between PI3K/AKT sustained stemness, cell cycle progression,
  and anti-apoptosis, that are balanced by counteracting relays (i.e., DNA damage
  control or pathway inactivation by PTEN). In dysregulated stem cell conditions,
  e.g., upon transformation (right), the PI3K/AKT axis is often mutationally distorted
  so that growth and stemness are constitutively enforced. These effects are further
  exacerbated in cancers where DDR components (mostly p53 and/or ARF) are co-mutated.
  Here, proliferation is largely uncoupled from counterbalancing control mechanisms.
