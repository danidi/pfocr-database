caption: Bcl-2 as an attractive target for modulating different modes of cell death
  in cancer therapy due to close communications with mediators of apoptosis, programmed
  necrosis, and autophagy. Sharing the common upstream TNF receptor, apoptosis and
  programmed necrosis seem to diverge when programmed necrosis protein RIP and pro-apoptotic
  caspase-8 compete to bind the adaptor molecule FADD for their activation. Bcl-2
  is also shown here to block the VDAC and consequent disruption of mitochondrial
  permeability necessary for the release of programmed necrosis factors. On the other
  hand, Bcl-2 induces VEGF and NF-κB production that can suppress programmed necrosis.
  Downstream of caspase-8 lies the apoptotic pathway involving Bid and Bax oligomerization
  and consequent permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane for cytochrome c release.
  Bcl-2 here acts to suppress the effects of Bid and Bax. Lastly, autophagy is activated
  when the inhibitory binding of Bcl-2 to Beclin 1 is relieved either by BH3-domain
  proteins or JNK phosphorylation of Bcl-2.
