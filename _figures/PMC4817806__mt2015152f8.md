caption: Proposed mechanism by which DZNep epigenetically reactivates Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling to promote osteogenic differentiation of osteoporosis BMSCs. During osteoporosis,
  EZH2 is activated to enhance H3K27me3 signature on promoters of Wnt genes, resulting
  in suppression of Wnt signaling. Inhibition of Wnt signaling shifts the lineage
  commitment of BMSCs to adipocytes. DZNep, an inhibitor of histone methylation, effectively
  suppresses EZH2 function to decrease H3K27me3 levels and reactivate canonical Wnt
  pathway. DZNep treatment significantly recovers osteogenic differentiation defect
  of OVX BMSCs, which promotes BMSC-mediated bone formation. Since epigenetic regulation
  can be maintained persistently, our findings provide a potential BMSC-based strategy
  for osteoporosis treatment and bone regeneration.
