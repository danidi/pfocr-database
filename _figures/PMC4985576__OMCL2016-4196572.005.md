caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the effects of HIV-1 Tat on occludin, RAGE,
  and LRP1 in brain endothelial cells. Exposure to HIV-1 Tat resulted in RAGE overexpression,
  which downregulated occludin and LRP1, stimulating the transfer of Aβ from the blood
  into the brain. HF protected against these effects. Exposure to HF inhibited HIV-1
  Tat-induced dysregulation of occludin, RAGE, and LRP1.
