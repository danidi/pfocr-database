caption: The figure illustrates the steps that lead to the activation of ATR. The
  common signal for initiating an ATR dependent response is the presence of ssDNA.
  Due to the work of replicative helicases, ssDNA is most abundant during S phase,
  but there are other situations that can lead to ssDNA such as exposing the telomeric
  overhang, double-nicks generated during NER and resected DSB. ssDNA is rapidly coated
  by stabilizing proteins. RPA-coated ssDNA independently brings together the two
  components of the pathway. One one hand, RPA recruits ATRIP, which is in a complex
  with ATR and thus brings the kinase to the lesion. On the other hand, RPA recruits
  Rad17, which loads the 9-1-1. This complex is then essential to recruit and position
  the alosteric activator TopBP1. On close proximity, TopBP1 activates ATR.
