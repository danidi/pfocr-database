caption: Possible routes for entry of cysteamine into the brain and its metabolism
  to the potent anti-oxidant AECK-DD. Cysteamine–cysteine mixed disulfide is structurally
  similar to lysine and is predicted to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) on the
  lysine transporter. Once within the brain, the mixed disulfide is reduced to free
  cysteamine. A β-replacement reaction between serine (or cysteine) and cysteamine
  catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase generates thialysine. Thialysine is a substrate
  of glutamine transaminase K (GTK). The α-keto analogue of thialysine generated by
  this reaction spontaneously cyclizes to a ketimine (AECK), which is either reduced
  in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction to 1,4-thiomorpholine-3-carboxylate or spontaneously
  decomposes to AECK decarboxylated dimer (AECK-DD). RSH can be cysteine, GSH or protein
  –SH. RSSR can be cystine, GSSG or disulfide linkages in proteins. The proposed metabolic
  pathway from thialysine to the heterocyclic compounds is based on work by Cavallini
  and colleagues [–].
