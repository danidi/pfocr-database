caption: 'The NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires two
  critical steps: (a) Priming: the first step of NLRP3 activation, referred to as
  priming, is mainly provided by engagement of toll-like receptors (TLR) by TLR ligands
  that include both pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and damage-associated
  molecular pattern (DAMP). Engagement of TLR promotes activation of NFκB and MAPK
  signaling pathway, which ultimately promotes upregulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β.
  (b) Activation: the second signal, known as the activation step, includes PAMP and
  DAMP which promote NLRP3 oligomerization and complex formation. PAMP and DAMP such
  as nigericin (via Pannexin1), ATP (via P2X7 receptor) and particulate crystals (lysosomal
  rupture), the known activating signals, ultimately promote potassium efflux. Change
  in the potassium concentration initiates oligomerization of NLRP3 and formation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex consisting of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1. Within
  the NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase-1 is activated, which cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  to generate mature bioactive IL-1β and IL-18. In addition, active capase-1 also
  cleaves GSDMD to release N-terminal fragment (N-GSDMD), which forms pores in the
  cell membrane to induce pyroptosis'
