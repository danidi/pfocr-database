caption: Current model of BR signal transduction. Brassinolide binds to the extracellular
  domain of the BRI1 receptor kinase, promoting BRI1 kinase activity. BRI1 then phosphorylates
  the negative regulator BKI1 on Y211, releasing it from the membrane and allowing
  BRI1 to associate with BAK1 or its homologs BKK1 and SERK1. BRI1 transphosphorylates
  BAK1 on KD residues and the activated BAK1 then transphosphorylates BRI1 on specific
  JM and CT residues, which enhances the signaling capacity of BRI1, leading to phosphorylation
  of BSK1 and its release from the receptor complex. Activated BSK1 associates with
  and activates BSU1, which dephosphorylates the BIN2 kinase on Y200, inactivating
  it. The unphosphorylated forms of BES1 and BZR1 transcription factors then accumulate
  (with aid of PP2A) and bind to the promoters of BR-regulated target genes, eliciting
  a specific physiological response such as cell elongation. Positive regulators of
  the pathway are shown in black, with negative regulators in red. For simplicity
  the nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of BSU1, BIN2, BES1 and BZR1 are not shown
  in this model. Reproduced with permission from  of Clouse ().
