caption: Mechanism of estradiol-dependent repression of GD3S in ER-positive breast
  cancer cells. GD3S gene (ST8SIA1) transcription is activated by NF-κB pathway upon
  TNF stimulation, leading, in ER-negative breast cancer cells, to an increased expression
  of GD3S in the Golgi apparatus and disialoganglioside (GD3 and GD2) at the cell
  surface, increasing cell migration and proliferation. In ER-positive breast cancer
  cells, estradiol (E2)-ERα complex represses the TNF-induced up-regulation of GD3S
  by inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation [].
