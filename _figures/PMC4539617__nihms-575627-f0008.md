caption: Bombesin activates GRPR receptor that is linked to Gαq and Gα12/13 proteins.
  Gαq and Gα12/13signaling involves Rho, that stimulates a variety of transcription
  factors, such as NFkB. Activation of NFkB increases production of Shh, which in
  turn activates Gli through Ptch and Smo membrane receptors on the same cell (autocrine
  signaling) or neighbouring cells (paracrine signaling).
