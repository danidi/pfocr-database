caption: 'Abbreviated biosynthetic pathway of carotenoids from  to β-carotene in Dunaliella
  spp. (). Commonly, the carotenogenic pathway is made up of three main parts:  biosynthesis,
  lycopene generation, and the formation of carotenoids with cyclohexene and their
  derivatives. Metabolites are shown in boldface, whereas enzymes for relative conversions
  are displayed in italics. Dashed arrows represent one or more intermediates being
  generated under the catalysis of related enzymes. [See online article for color
  version of this figure.]'
