caption: Molecular pathways involved in necroinflammation. Necrotic renal cells release
  DAMPs and alarmins that activate DAMP or alarmin receptors on immune (and parenchymal)
  cells, respectively (). Activation of immune (and parenchymal) cells induces the
  secretion of numerous proinflammatory cytokines that in turn can induce several
  forms of regulated necrosis (e.g., necroptosis, pyroptosis). The necroptosis signaling
  pathway involves auto- and transphosphorylation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 and the recruitment
  of MLKL. Activation of caspase-1 induces release of IL-1β and IL-18, which causes
  inflammation. Certain DAMPs and proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α or IL-8,
  directly activate neutrophils for the formation of NETs. NET formation expels large
  amounts of histones into the extracellular space. Extracellular histones have direct
  cytotoxic impact on renal cells and in addition induce TLR2-/TLR4- and NLRP3-related
  immune cell activation. GPX-4, glutathione peroxidase; MOMP, mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization; p-MLKL, phospho-mixed lineage kinase domain-like; Ripk1,
  receptor-activating protein kinase 1; Ripk3, receptor-activating protein kinase
  3.
