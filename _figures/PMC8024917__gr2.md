  (). The nitrogen incorporation occurs in the earlier phase of the biosynthesis from
  cholesterol (). The genes names in tomato are shown as yellow entries, while the
  blue entries are the enzyme activities. 3βHSD, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase;
  3KSI, 3-ketosteroid isomerase; S5αR, steroid 5α-reductase; 3KSR, 3-ketosteroid reductase.
