caption: Connections between the cAMP/PKA pathway and virulence-related functions
  in C. neoformans. A variety of functions act at the cell surface to sense potential
  signals of relevance to mammalian hosts. These include iron sensing via the high
  affinity uptake system (Cft1-Cfo1), the ESCRT pathway and master iron regulator
  Cir1. The ESCRT pathway also participates in the pH-response RIM pathway. In response
  to alkaline pH, Rim101 is phosphorylated by PKA, cleaved by the protease Rim13,
  and relocalized to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of genes involved
  in cell wall remodeling. The cAMP/PKA and HOG pathways have opposing influences
  on capsule formation. In presence of glucose, cAMP activates PKA, which in turns
  phosphorylate the transcription factor Nrg1 that promotes expression of capsule
  synthesis gene and represses transcription of PBS2 and HOG1. Capsule enlargement
  requires increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity, which generate
  increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS triggers Hog1 activation via its
  phosphorylation by Pbs2. Phosphorylated Hog1 translocates to the nucleus and reduces
  capsule biosynthesis by potentially accelerating mRNA degradation. The cAMP/PKA
  and RIM pathways as well as GPCR Gpr5 are required for titan cell elaboration.
