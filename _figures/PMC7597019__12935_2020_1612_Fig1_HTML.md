caption: Metabolic and non-metabolic nuclear function of PKM2. PKM2 was originally
  known to serve as a pyruvate kinase in the glycolytic pathway, where it transferred
  a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, producing pyruvate and ATP. In
  addition to this so-called metabolic function, increasing evidence demonstrates
  that PKM2 can function as a protein kinase to phosphorylate a variety of protein
  targets and be involved in multiple physiopathological processes
