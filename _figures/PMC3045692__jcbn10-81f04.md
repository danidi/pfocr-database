caption: A network of genes commonly regulated after pioglitazone treatment. Seven
  genes that were up-regulated in pioglitazone-treated stomach were analyzed by the
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool. The shown major network that was found to be significantly
  up-regulated by pioglitazone was associated with cell cycle, cell-to-cell signaling
  and interaction, and cancer. Shaded genes are the genes identified by microarray
  analysis and others are those associated with the regulated genes based on the pathway
  analysis. The meaning of the node shapes is also indicated. Asterisks indicate genes
  that were identified multiple times.
