caption: Physiology of the human and rodent β- and α-cell. a Insulin secretion from
  β-cells (blue) is triggered at high glucose concentrations. Glucose enters the cell
  mainly via GLUTs. The contribution of SGLT to glucose uptake in β-cells is not yet
  confirmed. Intracellularly, glucose is phosphorylated by the glucokinase and converted
  to pyruvate during glycolysis. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria where it is metabolized
  in the Krebs cycle, resulting in the generation of ATP. Elevation in the ATP/ADP
  ratio induces the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) leading to
  the depolarization of the cell membrane. Opening of voltage-gated sodium channels
  (VGSC) causes a further depolarization by the influx of sodium ions (Na+) causing
  an influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) via voltage-gated calcium channels (VGGC). Elevation
  of the intracellular Ca2+-concentration [Ca2+]i triggers the exocytosis of insulin-filled
  vesicles by which insulin is released. Insulin secretion is mediated by the triggering
  pathway, which includes the rapid increase of [Ca2+]i resulting in a fast insulin
  response, as well as by the metabolic amplifying pathway that generates a second,
  continous release of insulin. Glucagon secretion from α-cells is less well understood.
  Of the several theories, which are currently discussed, one possible mechanism is
  illustrated in the displayed α-cell (yellow). According to this idea, α-cells share
  many features of the β-cells including uptake glucose via GLUTs and presumably SGLT1.
  Contrary to β-cells, KATPs are thought to close already at a low ATP/ADP ratio resulting
  in glucagon secretion, whereas a further increase of intracellular ATP induces the
  closure of VGSCs and VGGCs, thereby inhibiting glucagon release. Insulin and glucagon
  have opposing effects on peripheral cells and mediate signals for a reduction or
  rise of plasma glucose levels. b Analysis of glucose transport of human and rat
  β- and rat α-cells measured by the uptake of 3-O-Methyl-d-glucose (3-OMG).  In the
  rat β-cell (left) glucose uptake via specific glucose carriers (orange) is faster
  than the subsequent glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase. The activation of the
  triggering pathway as well as the metabolic amplifying pathway results in a biphasic
  insulin secretion in response to a rapid increase of glucose concentrations. Human
  β-cells (middle) exhibit a different subset of glucose transporters (yellow) that
  presumably results in a slower glucose uptake and a smaller gap between glucose
  uptake and usage compared to rat β-cells. Glucose uptake rate in rat α-cells (right)
  is comparable to human β-cells and similarly mediated by a specific subset of glucose
  transporters (red). Glucose-stimulated glucagon secretion decreases at high glucose
  concentration
