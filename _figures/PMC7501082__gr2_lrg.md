caption: 'Diagram of the involvement of host and viral proteases in SARS-CoV-2 life
  cycle. Activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases occurs at
  different stages in the viral life cycle and in different cell localizations. The
  ACE2-dependent infectious entry at the cell membrane is triggered through the S
  protein cleavage by host proteases: furin (1) and/or TMPRSS2 (2). Intracellular
  activation of S protein is mediated by cathepsin in lysosomes (3) and/or by Furin
  in trans-Golgi network (TGN) (4). After the receptor recognition, the viral genome
  is released into the cytoplasm of the host cell (5), RNA attaches directly to the
  host ribosome for translation of two polyproteins (not shown). Polyprotein (pp)
  maturation into mature fragments is catalysed by viral Cys proteases (Mpro and PL
  pro) (6). RNA is translated into DNA and inside the nucleus (N) replication amplifies
  the number of virus genome copies (7). The viral genome produces pps, which help
  to take command over host ribosomes for their own translation process; protein biosynthesis
  starts at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and follows the constitutive secretory
  pathway along Golgi compartments (8). The virion assembly occurs (9) and the newly
  packed viral particles can egress (10).'
