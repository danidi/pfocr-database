caption: Defective respiration of Δisc1 in the post-diauxic  phase. A, induction ratio
  of carbon source metabolism pathway  genes across diauxic shift in WT and Δisc1.
  Carbon source  metabolism pathway was modified from a review by Schuller  (). Red
  boxes  indicate the genes more induced across the diauxic shift in  Δisc1 relative
  to WT according to the ratio of WT (24 h)/WT (4  h)/Δisc1 (24 h)/Δisc1 (4 h). Blue
  boxes  indicate the genes less induced across the diauxic shift in  Δisc1 relative
  to WT. Thickness of the boxes indicates  the fold change as shown in the figure.
  The results are representatives of at  least two independent experiments. B, Venn
  diagram of the number of  whole genome (blue), diauxic up-regulated (orange),  glucose-repressed
  (green), and Isc1p-dependent diauxic up-regulated  (purple) genes. A cohort of glucose-repressed
  genes was extracted  from glucose pulse experiment  (). C, growth of WT  and Δisc1
  in ethanol-containing media. WT and  Δisc1 cells in the post-diauxic phase were
  inoculated to fresh  YPethanol and incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. D,  oxygen
  consumption rate of whole cells (WT and Δisc1) in the  post-diauxic phase was measured
  during incubation with 2% ethanol. The results  are represented as mean ± S.E. of
  at least two independent  experiments.
