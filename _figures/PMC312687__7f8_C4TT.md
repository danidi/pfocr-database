caption: 'Model for the function of Xsprouty2 in Xenopus gastrulation. At least two
  signaling pathways emanate from the FGFR during gastrulation: a Xsprouty2-insensitive
  signal through the Ras/MAPK pathway results in mesoderm induction/maintenance as
  well as Xsprouty2, Xbra, and indirectly eFGF and Xwnt11 expression. The second Xsprouty2-sensitive
  pathway results in Ca2+ mobilization and convergent extension, two processes known
  to require Xwnt11 signaling. Thus, Xsprouty2 functions to coordinate the distinct
  roles of the FGFR in mesoderm induction and morphogenesis. See discussion for further
  details.'
