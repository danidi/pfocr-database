caption: The morphine biosynthetic pathway downstream of (S)-N-methylcoclaurine with
  the results of expression analysis of selected morphine biosynthetic genes, CYP80B3,
  4'OMT, SalAT, T6ODM, COR (alleles Cor1-1 and Cor2-1), and CODM by RT-PCR. Actin
  was used as an experimental control. Presumably, the pathway via oripavine (dotted
  pathway) does not exist in the P. somniferum Japanese cultivar “Ikkanshu” which
  we have used in this study [,].
