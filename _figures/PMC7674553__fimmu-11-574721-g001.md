caption: Proposed schematic representation of how amino acids metabolism and immune-modulation
  occur in crustaceans. Nitric oxide (NO) is generated from arginine (Arg) by the
  action of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which counteracts pathogen-induced oxidative
  stress and promote immune response. Polyamines, as downstream products of Arg metabolism,
  promote immune response, while arginine kinase (AK) can catalyze the conversion
  of Arg to arginine phosphate, which can be coopted to promote replication of white
  spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Tryptophan (Trp) and its metabolite melatonin can activate
  the antioxidant system (ADS) and promote the expression of immune proteins as well
  as counteract oxidative stress. Melatonin also promotes the repair of oxidative
  stress induced organelle damage. Trp could also suppress inflammatory response through
  the kynurenine pathway. Some amino acids such as Met, Cys, Pro, Gly, etc., have
  direct antioxidant activity due to their chemical properties. IDO, Indoleamine‐2,3‐dioxygenase;
  ARG, Arginase; Met, methionine; Cys, cysteine; Pro, proline; Gly, glycine.
