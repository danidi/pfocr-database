caption: AMPK controls the main metabolic pathways in PCa cells. PCa cells are characterized
  by exacerbation of lipogenesis associated with hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway.
  Physiological and pharmacological activation of AMPK by LKB1/CaMKK and AMPK activators,
  respectively, can inhibit these pathways by direct phosphorylation of key lipogenic
  enzymes (ACC, in particular isoform 1, HMG-CoA reductase) and key kinases (the complex
  TSC1/TSC2 and the mTOR-associated factor Raptor) or by regulating transcription
  through SREBP1c. Black and red arrows indicate activation and inhibition, respectively.
  Tumour suppressor genes are represented in violet boxes. AMPK, AMP-activated protein
  kinase; CaMKK, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase; SREBP1c, sterol regulatory
  element binding protein-1c; ACLY, ATP citrate lyase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  FASN, fatty acid synthase; HMG-CoA reductase, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; PTEN,
  phosphatase and tensin homologue; TSC2/TSC1, tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2; RHEB,
  Ras homologue enriched in brain; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; 4EBP1, 4E-binding
  protein 1; S6K1, S6 kinase 1; eiF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E.
