caption: The model shows that β1 integrins enhance downregulation of Egfr signaling
  through endocytosis. Egfr signaling inhibits Hh expression. Hh signaling is paracrine
  in the intestinal with Shh and Ihh secreted by the intestinal epithelial cells which
  bind to their cognate receptor Patched (Ptc) expressed on intestinal stromal cells.
  Hh signaling in stromal cells is mediated by Smoothened (Smo) and Gli transcription
  factors, and, culminates in the induction of Bmp-2/-4 expression. Bmp signaling
  is paracrine as well since Bmp receptors are expressed by intestinal epithelial
  cells. Bmp signaling inhibits proliferative signaling, especially the Wnt pathway,
  and inhibits Shh transcription in intestinal epithelial cells.
