caption: QS maybe involved in communication between intestinal bacteria and host cells
  under physiological or pathological conditions. In the physiological state, several
  QS signal molecules are implicated in the crosstalk between host cell and parasitic
  bacteria. AI-2 activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in IEC cells to upregulate
  the level of cytokine IL-8. AI-2 promotes TNFSF9 gene expression in macrophages.
  3-oxo-C12:2 (AHLs) decreases IL-8 secretion in IL-1β-stimulated IECs. Indole enhances
  the epithelial barrier function via activating pregnane X receptor (PXR) and aryl
  hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Meanwhile, IECs produce AI-2 mimic signals that can
  be recognized by AI-2 receptor, and regulate QS related genes expression in bacteria.
  Under pathological states, for example, Clostridium difficile infection, indole-producing
  bacteria sense QS signals and create a unique environment with high levels of indole,
  which inhibits common intestinal bacteria recovery and benefits C. difficile self-survival.
  “lactic acid bacteria” (LAB) such as Bifidobacterium can inhibit enterohemorrhagic
  Escherichia coli (EHEC) virulence by AI-2 signals. Ruminococcus. obeum restricts
  Vibrio cholerae colonization through AI-2 signals.
