caption: Proposed model TG1-1 cells, in presence of ethanol and estrogen, activate
  its pro-survival AKT pathway, leading to enhanced secretion of pro-angiogenic factors,
  such as VEGF, eNOS and MMP9. These proangiogenic factors in turn act on SVEC4-10
  endothelial cells resulting in enhanced activation of MEK thus leading to increased
  endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis. Overall, the events described consequently
  lead to enhanced breast cancer angiogenesis and progression.
