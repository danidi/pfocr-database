caption: Overview of the Notch signaling pathway. Binding of the Notch ligands (Delta-like
  1, Delta-like 3, Delta-like 4, Jagged 1 and Jagged 2) to the transmembrane Notch
  receptors (Notch 1–4) results in proteolytic cleavage events by ADAM and γ-secretase
  to mediate the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD then enters
  the nucleus and interacts with cofactors to regulate the expression of target genes
  involved in EndoMT, angiogenesis, and CSC biology.
