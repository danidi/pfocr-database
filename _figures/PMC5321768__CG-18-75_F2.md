caption: Proposed model for topoisomerase inhibitor mediated cellular death. Inhibition
  of DNA topoisomerases by catalytic topoisomerase inhibitors or topoisomerase poisons
  interferes with DNA replication, recombination, transcription and decatenation,
  and causes DNA damage. These generate cellular stress, lead to cell cycle arrest
  and ultimately induce apoptotic cell death pathway.
