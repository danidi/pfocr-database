caption: Pharmacological regulation of pluripotency circuitry establishment during
  cellular reprogramming via the FEN-stimulated PPARα regulatory pathway. Nr5a2 increased
  by FEN may interact with Nr0b1 and function in Oct4 upregulation together, resulting
  in the target activation of Oct4 itself, Rex1, and Nanog. Nanog was also identified
  as a direct target of PPARα and then transcriptionally activated with or without
  coactivators.
