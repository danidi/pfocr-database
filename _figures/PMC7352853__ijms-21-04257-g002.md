caption: Sphingolipids implicated in pulmonary fibrosis, their structure, and metabolizing
  enzymes. An overview of de novo pathways of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Formation
  of the precursor 3-keto dihydrosphingosine from palmitoyl-CoA and L-serine catalyzed
  by SPT is the initial rate-limiting step, followed by generation of complex sphingolipids
  catalyzed by specific metabolic enzymes resulting in the generation of ceramides,
  sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), ceramide-1-phosphate and glucosyl ceramide.
  S1P or Dihydro S1P is hydrolyzed by S1PL to ∆2-hexadecenal or hexadecanal, respectively,
  and ethanolamine phosphate. S1P or dihydro S1P is also converted back to sphingosine
  by SPP. Dysregulation of the metabolic pathway intermediates is involved in the
  pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. CerS1-6—Ceramide synthase 1-6, DEGS1—Delta 4-Desaturase
