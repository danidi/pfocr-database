number: Figure 3
caption: Signaling pathways elicited by stabilin-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic
  cells. Stabilin-1 and stabilin-2 directly binds to phosphatidylserine on the surface
  of apoptotic cells, resulting in activation of Rac1 (Rac family small GTPase 1),
  which reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton for apoptotic cell engulfment via a Gulp1-dependent
  mechanism. However, intermediate signaling molecules between Gulp1 (phosphotyrosine-binding
  domain-containing engulfment adaptor protein 1) and Rac1 remain to be characterized.
  In the Gulp1-independent pathway, stabilin-2 interacts through its fasciclin I (FAS1)
  domains with integrin β5, which in turn activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and
  recruits the CrkII (CRK adaptor protein)-ELMO1 (engulfment and cell motility 1)-DOCK1
  (dedicator of cytokinesis 1; also referred to as DOCK180) complex, leading to activation
  of Rac1 and induction of cytoskeletal rearrangement.
