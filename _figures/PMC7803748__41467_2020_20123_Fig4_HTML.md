caption: IKK phosphorylates the inhibitory of NF-kB, named IkB, that undergoes proteasomal-dependent
  degradation leading to NF-kB release and nuclear translocation. IKK activation leads
  also to inhibition of the insulin pathway by blocking IRS1. Tweak, another member
  of TNF family, binds to the receptor, named Fn14, which upon activation recruits
  proteins such as TRAF6 to induce NF-kB as well as FoxO activation.
