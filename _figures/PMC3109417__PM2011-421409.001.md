number: Figure 1
caption: The figure shows the complex interplay involving RAGE, reactive oxygen and
  nitrogen species, antioxidants, profibrotic cytokines, and their signalling pathways,
  and, in red, the most relevant effects of pathway activation. The molecules investigated
  in the present study are coloured in blue. The numbers in square brackets refer
  to bibliography citations.
