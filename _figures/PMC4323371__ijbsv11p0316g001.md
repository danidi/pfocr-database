caption: TERRA regulation of telomere length for the protection of chromosome ends
  involving TRF2. CTCF recruits RNAPII to the CpG-island promoter and promotes TERRA
  transcription, CTCF and cohesin stabilization and TRF1/TRF2 binding to subtelomeres
  prevents telomere DNA damage signaling. The binding of TERRA to TRF2 hinders the
  formation of T-loops and activates the ATM kinase pathway. The THO complex enables
  the packaging of TERRA into RNPs and inhibits unscheduled TERRA expression, which
  could avoid the redundant removal of TERRA from the T-loop. TERRA interacts with
  the Exo1-inhibiting Ku70/80 dimer and promotes Exo1-dependent resection at chromosome
  ends to shorten the telomere.
