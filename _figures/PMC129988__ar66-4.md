caption: Attenuation of cytokine signaling. Suppressor of cytokine    signaling (SOCS)
  proteins are induced in response to cytokines and suppress    signal transduction
  in two ways. Some SOCS proteins bind directly to janus    kinases (Jaks) and inhibit
  their catalytic activity, whereas others like    cytokine inducible src homology-2
  protein (CIS) can bind to activated    receptors and prevent docking by signaling
  intermediates such as the Stats.    SHP-1 can either dephosphorylate Jaks or activated
  receptor subunits, depending    upon the pathway activated. Protein inhibitors of
  activated Stats (PIAS) family    members inactivate Stat dimers by an as yet unknown
  mechanism. Stat dimers are    also probably downregulated by degradation and dephosphorylated
  by unknown    mechanisms. The accumulation of STATs in the nucleus could be regulated
  at the    level of nuclear import, nuclear export, or a combination of the two;
  the    mechanisms that control these processes are not well characterized. Finally,    molecules
  like Bcl-6 can bind to consensus Stat binding sites and function as    repressors.
