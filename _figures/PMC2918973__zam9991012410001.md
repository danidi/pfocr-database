caption: 'Simplified scheme of carbon assimilation cycles in Methylobacterium (modified
  from reference ). Reactions of the PHB cycle are given in detail. PHB cycle enzymes
  are as follows: 1, β-ketothiolase; 2, NADPH-linked acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; 3,
  PHB synthase; 4, PHB depolymerase; 5, R-3HB dehydrogenase; 6, acetoacetate-succinyl-CoA
  transferase. Lipoic acid-dependent enzymes are as follows: 7, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  8, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Enzymes of the proposed alternative R-3HB utilization
  pathway are as follows: 9, acyl-CoA synthetase (putative enzyme [dotted line]);
  10, (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase.'
