caption: Probable mechanisms underpinning PERK signaling pathway’s effects on SBI.
  After SBI, PERK signaling was activated and p-PERK and p-eIF2α amounts were increased.
  In addition, the protein levels of ATF4 were increased and led to neuronal apoptosis.
  GSK2606414 intervention reversed these effects, reducing neuronal apoptosis and
  necrosis, which played a protective role in brain injury after SBI.
