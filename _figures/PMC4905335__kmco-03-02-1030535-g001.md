caption: Mechanism of retention of BRCA1/BARD1 complexes at DNA double-strand break
  sites. In response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), ATM mediates chromatin decondensation
  in part through KAP1 phosphorylation and activates RNF8/RNF168 pathway that recruit
  BRCA1/ABRAXAS complex as well as 53BP1/RIF1, the effectors of non-homologous end-joining
  (NHEJ). BARD1/HP1/H3K9me2 interaction is also mediated by ATM, but not by RNF168,
  and is required for homologous recombination repair (HRR) and inhibition of RIF1.
  KAP1, CAF1, macroH2A1, and RPDM2 may be involved in the process of chromatin recondensation
  in HRR together with the BARD1/HP1 interaction. HKMT, histone lysine methyltransferase;
  me, methylation, P, phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitin, blue boxes, BRCT domain.
