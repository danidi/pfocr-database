caption: LPS-TLR4-NFκB signaling pathway is an established potentiator of TNFα-dependent
  inflammation in metabolic disorders. NFκB (e.g. p50-p65) is activated by reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and by signaling from Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), tumor necrosis
  factor-α (TNF-α) receptor (TNFR), and other receptors (labeled with “?”). Vitamin
  C is hypothesized to improve gut barrier function to reduce the absorption of endotoxin
  (LPS), and its consequent signaling via hepatic TLR4. Thus, decreasing LPS will
  interrupt the cycle of NFκB activation at the intestine and the liver otherwise
  driven by inflammatory mediators, e.g. TNF-α.
