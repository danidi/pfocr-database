caption: An MKL2/TGFβ signaling pathway is required for vascular patterning and stabilization
  of the great arteries during embryonic development. The transcriptional co-activator
  MKL2 transduces multiple signals in vascular SMCs that promote translocation of
  MKL2 (bound to G-actin) to the nucleus, where it physically associates with SRF.
  This, in turn, promotes SRF binding to CArG boxes, which activates transcription
  of the Tgfb2 gene and other genes encoding TGFβ signaling molecules. Activation
  of TGFβ signaling activates expression genes that encode key components of the ECM,
  including fibronectin, fibrillin and Col4a1. The ECM, in turn, feeds back on vascular
  SMCs, reinforcing the contractile SMC phenotype and leading to organization of the
  tunica media that is required for stabilization of the great arteries. In addition,
  MKL2 promotes SMC differentiation of the great arteries via binding to SRF, which
  in turn binds to CArG boxes that control expression of genes encoding SMC contractile
  proteins. Expression of SMC contractile proteins influences expression of TGFβ signaling
  and TGFβ-regulated genes encoding ECM, and visa versa, serving to define an MKL2/SRF
  molecular program required for vascular development and patterning in the embryo.
  Pathways identified in the experiments described in this work are shown in red.
