caption: 'In cancer cells an increased uptake of glucose occurs as well as diversion
  of glycolytic intermediates to biosynthetic pathways including nucleosides, amino
  acids and lipids, which support cell growth and proliferation. Up and down arrows
  indicate cancer-associated upregulation/activation or downregulation/inhibition
  of enzymes. Alterations in red can be caused by the activation of HIF-1.CA9 and
