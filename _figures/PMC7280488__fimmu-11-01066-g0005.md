caption: Complement receptor signaling for phagocytosis. The complement receptor 3
  (CR3 integrin) binds the complement molecules (iC3b) deposited on the target particle,
  and activates a signaling pathway that leads to activation of the GTPase Rho. Then,
  active Rho induces actin polymerization via two mechanisms. Rho activates Rho kinase
  (ROCK), which phosphorylates and activates myosin II, inducing accumulation of Arp2/3
  and actin assembly at the phagocytic cup. Rho also promotes accumulation of mDia1
  (mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1), which stimulates linear actin polymerization.
  In addition, mDia1 binds directly to the microtubule-associated protein CLIP-170
  providing a link to the microtubule cytoskeleton.
