caption: C. elegans cell death pathways. A. The now classical core apoptosis pathway
  occurs in development and the germ line, but rarely in the adult soma. Upstream
  regulators block activation of the caspase, CED-3. B. The neurodegenerin pathway
  was first described in mechanosensory neurons and stimulated by mutations that elicit
  excitotoxic injury. A rise in [Ca2+]i triggers peptidase activity that kills the
  cells over several hours. Although not pictured, lysosomal injury and acidification
  of the cytoplasm may contribute to injury. The necrosis pathway is triggered after
  different types of stress (hypotonic, thermal, oxidative, hypoxic) and is most evident
  within the intestinal cytoplasm. C. An intracellular serpin (SRP-6) protects the
  lysosome from stress-induced injury and also protects the cell itself from lysosome-induced
  damage. There is strong genetic, biochemical and morphological evidence for the
  conservation of these pathways in higher eukaryotes, including humans.
