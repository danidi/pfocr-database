caption: During initial TCR-mediated activation of resting Tregs, signals via the
  Akt and mTOR pathways can potentially destabilize the Tregs and cause reprogramming
  into a pro-inflammatory helper-like phenotype (“ex-Tregs”). To prevent this, some
  signal must inhibit the mTOR/Akt axis during activation. If the antigen-presenting
  cell expresses IDO (e.g., due to up-regulation by apoptotic cells or other inflammatory
  signals) then this can inhibit mTORC2 signaling via a process mediated by low tryptophan
  and GCN2 kinase. In principle, depletion of other amino acids such as arginine (by
  local Arginase I) could create a similar GCN2-mediated inhibition of mTORC2. Potentially,
  other metabolic stresses in the tumor microenvironment might likewise affect mTORC1
  and the feedback loop to mTORC2 and Akt. By whatever pathway, if Akt phosphorylation
  on the activating Ser473 residue is blocked, then the Treg is able to maintain expression
  of FoxO3a and acquire a highly suppressive phenotype that includes up-regulation
  of cell-surface PD-1 and the lipid phosphatase PTEN. PD-1 can signal via PTEN to
  inhibit PI3K activity, and thus block phosphorylation of the activating Thr308 residue
  on Akt. This self-sustaining feedback loop acts to stably maintain the inhibition
  of Akt long-term, even if the original IDO or other metabolic stress is removed.
  Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) can also activate PTEN, and thus may be able to establish a
  similar stable activation state in the Treg.
