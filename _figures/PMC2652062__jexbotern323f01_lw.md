caption: 'The flavonoid pathway in Arabidopsis. Shown are the locations of the transparent
  testa mutations included in these experiments (in brackets). Mutations tt1, tt2,
  tt8, and ttg are in regulatory genes involved in several points of the pathway.
  The gene products affected by these regulatory mutations are TT2 which is a R2R3
  repeat MYB transcription factor; TT8 which is a bHLH transcription factor; and TTG
  which encodes a WD40 repeat gene. These proteins operate as a complex to induce
  BANYLUS expression to form anthocyanins as downstream products of the pathway. TT1
  is a WIP family zinc finger transcription factor and TTG2 is a WRKY type transcription
  factor that acts downstream of TTG1. The mutated genes and the affected products
  are: TT3 (DFR: dihydroflavonol reductase); TT4 (CHS: chalcone synthase), TT5 (CHI:
  chalcone isomerase), TT6 (F3H: flavonol 3-hydroxylase), TT7 (F3′H: flavonol 3′-hydroxylase),
  and TT10 an enzyme for biflavonol conversion and oxidizing procyanidins to proanthocyanidins
  in the seed testa. The figure is adapted from , (www.plantphysiol.org), Copyright
