caption: Enzymes in the starch and sucrose metabolic pathway in apical and mature
  leaves responded differentially to changing environment at two time points (morning,
  A and midday. G). Upregulated (activated) in apical leaves (blue), upregulated in
  mature leaves (red), downregulated (repressed) in apical leaves (orange box), downregulated
  in mature leaves (green box)
