caption: 'Itch-scratch cycle model in the central nervous system. The sensorimotor
  regions, such as SI, MI, SMA, and cerebellum, play an important role in processing
  itching signal. All the above signals may be learned, re-encoded, and memorized
  in the cerebellum, which may be modified by the reward system. In CSU, the sensorimotor-reward-cerebellum
  pathway (blue line) may be responsible for projecting itch-scratch signals to the
  cerebellum through cerebellar afferent nerve. And then, “through learning” in the
  cerebellum, the cerebellum-reward-sensorimotor pathway (red line) may be responsible
  for projecting imitative signals to the sensorimotor and reward regions through
  the cerebellar efferent nerve and play a key role in the neuropathology of chronic
  itch. Green line: the sensory signal from skin to the cerebellum'
