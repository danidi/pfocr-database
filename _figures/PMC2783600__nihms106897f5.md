caption: A metabolic map for Vibrio cholerae (), produced by Pathway Tools. The complete
  map is on the left hand side of the figure. It contains many more pathways than
  actually occur in V. cholerae, but the other data used in network inference will
  constrain the pathways in the final model. In this representation, the pathways
  are represented discretely, meaning that the same enzymes can appear more than once
  in the map. This preserves the traditional textbook representation of the pathways.
  The circle on the right hand side shows that part of the map that includes the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
  degradation pathway, which is traced by the green arrows. Enzymes are shown in red,
  substrates not in this pathway are in black, and substrates that are in the pathway
  are shown in green.
