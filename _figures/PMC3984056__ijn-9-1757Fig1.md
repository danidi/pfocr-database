caption: 'The blood–brain barrier (BBB).Notes: (A) The BBB is formed by endothelial
  cells at the level of the cerebral capillaries. These endothelial cells interact
  with perivascular elements, such as the basal lamina and closely associated astrocytic
  end-feet processes, perivascular neurons (represented by an interneuron here), and
  pericytes to form a functional BBB. (B) Cerebral endothelial cells are unique in
  that they form complex tight junctions (TJs) produced by the interaction of several
  transmembrane proteins that effectively seal the paracellular pathway. These complex
  molecular junctions make the brain practically inaccessible for polar molecules,
  unless they are transferred by transport pathways of the BBB that regulate the microenvironment
  of the brain. There are also adherens junctions (AJs), which stabilize cell–cell
  interactions in the junctional zone. In addition, the presence of intracellular
  and extracellular enzymes, such as monoamine oxidase (MAO), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase
  (γ-GT), alkaline phosphatase, peptidases, nucleotidases, and several cytochrome
  P450 enzymes, endow this dynamic interface with metabolic activity. Large molecules,
  such as antibodies, lipoproteins, proteins, and peptides can also be transferred
  to the central compartment by receptor-mediated transcytosis or nonspecific adsorptive-mediated
  transcytosis. The receptors for insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), iron transferrin
  (Tf) and leptin are all involved in transcytosis. Reprinted by permission from Macmillan
