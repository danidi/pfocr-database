caption: Model of TGF-β1-induced Erk activation and EMT being blocked by U0126. TGF-β1
  may activate the Erk pathway through upstream factors, such as Ras/Raf, or directly
  through more downstream factors, such as MEK or Erk. To investigate the role of
  Erk signaling in TGF-β1-mediated EMT, the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, was used to block
  Erk phosphorylation in NMuMG and MCT cells. In these cells, TGF-β1 induction of
  Erk activity and EMT was blocked by U0126. However, TGF-β1 may activate other pathways,
  such as p38, JNK, PI3-kinase, and RhoA, to induce EMT in other cell types.
