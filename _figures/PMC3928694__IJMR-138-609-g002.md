caption: 'TLR signalling pathways: TLRs signal through myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88 (MyD88) or/and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β
  (TRIF)-dependent pathways. TLRs 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 require the adaptor MyD88 for their
  action, whereas TLR3 signals through TRIF-dependent pathway. TLR4 on the other hand
  activates both MyD88 and TRIF dependent pathways and may induce pro-inflammatory
  cytokines as well as IFNβ. MyD88 recruits TNF receptor associated factor-6 (TRAF6)
  and members of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, which
  in turn causes phosphorylation of IκB, after proteasomal degradation of which NFκB
  dimers are translocated into the nucleus where they cause induction of proinflammatory
  cytokines. TRIF recruits TRAF3, which through its interaction with serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKi causes phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3). Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus where
  it causes induction of interferon β (IFNβ). TIRAP, TIR domain-containing adaptor
  protein; NEMO, NF-kappa-B essential modulator.'
