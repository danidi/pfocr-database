caption: Components of the NO-cGMP signaling pathway and the drugs that were used
  to target them in the present experiments. PTIO, a nitric oxide (NO) scavenger,
  was used to temporarily deplete NO from intact Lymnaea.l-NAME was used as an inhibitor
  of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme, and ODQ was used as an inhibitor of the
  soluble guanylyl cyclase enzyme (for details, see Materials and Methods).
