caption: Main steps in the trafficking of the signaling protein Hh. The Hh protein
  is expressed in the sending cell (on the left) and undergoes posttranslational modifications,
  particularly cleavage and the addition of palmitic acid and cholesterol (1). This
  lipid-coated form of Hh is secreted by the apical surface, but perhaps because of
  its high affinity for membranes, it is retained there (2). The Hh protein is subsequently
  internalized in endocytic vesicles, a process that requires the proteins Shi (Dynamin)
  and several members of the Rab family (3). In an internal vesicular compartment,
  most likely early endosomes, Hh binds the 12 transmembrane-pass protein Dispatched
  (Disp), which drives Hh to the basolateral plasma membrane (4). There, direct protein
  interactions between Disp, Ihog, and the glypican protein Dally-like (Dlp) lead
  to the release of Hh to the intercellular space, perhaps as part of a complex or
  a specialized type of extracellular vesicle (5). At the plasma membrane of the receiving
  cell (on the right), the Hh protein binds its receptor, the seven transmembrane
  protein Patched (Ptc) (6). This binding activates the Hh signaling pathway in the
  receiving cell, leading to the posttranslational activation of the Ci transcription
  factor (7). In turn, Ci activation leads to the expression of Hh target genes, such
  as collier, dpp, and ptc itself. Finally, binding by Ptc leads to internalization
  and degradation of the Hh protein in the receiving cell.
