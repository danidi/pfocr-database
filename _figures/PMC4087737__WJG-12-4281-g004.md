caption: 'A: The intestinal mucosal barrier is maintained by a series of lateral membrane
  specialisations near the apical pole of the epithelial cell. It comprises tight
  junctions, adhesion belts, desmosomes and gap junctions that prevent the movement
  of pathogens across the epithelial monolayer. Constitutive expression and activities
  of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is important
  for maintaining adequate blood flow, anti-inflammatory, anti-thromobotic (-) and
  anti-apoptotic effects on endothelium, neutrophils, platelets, and enterocytes,
  respectively. HO-1 activity produces the antioxidant bilirubin to limit oxidative
  damage; B: The loss of mucosal integrity results in the translocation of pathogens
  and establishment of an inflammatory response by the following series of events.
  (1) Initiation of synthesis of proteases by bacteria erode tight junction complexes
  between epithelial cells. (2) Binding of bacterial motifs activates toll like receptors,
  initiating the NF-kB pathway. (3) Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  chemokines and endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules. (4) Leukocytes extravasate
  and increased permeability of capillaries increases fluid accumulation (5) Phagocytic
  cells produce myeloperoxidase which combines with peroxide to form hypochlorous
  acid that damages pathogen and host systems alike. (6) Peroxide produced by enterocytes
  in combination with ferrous iron can produce superoxide anions that damage lipids,
  DNA and proteins. (7) NO is produced at high concentrations that combines with peroxide
  to form the pro-oxidant peroxynitrite. (8) Platelets also bind to the endothelial
  surface to induce hemostasis. (9) Presentation of antigens by dendritic cells via
  major histocompatibility class 1 to cytotoxic T-cells leads to antibody presentation
  and destruction of infected epithelial cells.'
