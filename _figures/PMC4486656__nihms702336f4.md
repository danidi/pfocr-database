caption: (A) The AMPK pathway is influenced by adenylate concentration. AMPKα is activated
  by phosphorylation on Thr172 of its activation loop by the kinases LKB1, TAK1, or
  CaMKKβ. LKB1 promotes enhanced AMPK phosphorylation under a high AMP:ATP ratio.
  One biological output of AMPK activity is the inhibition of mRNA translation under
  low-energy conditions through inhibition of mTORC1 activity. (B) α-KG– dependent
  enzymes (in yellow) are a class of enzymes regulated by TCA cycle intermediates
  that require molecular oxygen (O2) and α-KG for their enzymatic activity. Oxygen,
  α-KG, ascorbate, and iron (green) are positive regulators of these enzymes, whereas
  the TCA cycle intermediates fumarate and succinate (blue) antagonize their reactions.
  PHDs destabilize HIF-1α protein, resulting in decreased expression of HIF-1α targets
  and a reduction in glycolysis. TET2 hydroxylates 5-methylcytosine residues to promote
  DNA demethylation, whereas JmjC promotes demethylation of trimethylated histones
  in chromatin.
