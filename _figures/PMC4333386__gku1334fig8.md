caption: The functional interaction between RecQ helicases and the FA pathway. (A)
  A speculative model that proposes RECQL5 and the FA core complex suppresses chromosomal
  defects in an additive manner. (B) RECQL5 and BLM have different effects on FA-defective
  cells after exposure to CPT and MMC that could impact cancer treatment. (i) RECQL5
  also suppressed cell death in fancbΔex2 cells exposed to MMC.
