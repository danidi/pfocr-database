caption: The revised bacterial F420 biosynthesis pathway. The revised pathway is a
  modified scheme showing that phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) acts as the substrate for
  the FbiD/CofC enzymes to produce enolpyruvyl-diphospho-5ʹ-guanosine (EPPG) or enolpyruvyl-diphospho-5ʹ-adenosine
  (EPPA) (in the case of CofC). The immediate reaction product formed from Fo and
  EPPG/EPPA is dehydro-F420-0, which is reduced to F420-0 through the newly described
  reductase activity of the C-terminal domain of FbiB in mycobacteria. A separate
  enzyme in archaea and some bacteria is expected to catalyze this reduction step
  (CofX). FbiB/CofE subsequently adds a poly-γ-glutamate tail to form F420. “Fbi”
  refers to bacterial proteins, whereas “Cof” represents archaeal ones
