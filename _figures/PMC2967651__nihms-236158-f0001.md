caption: A model for interplay between alloimmunity and autoreactivity in graft rejection.
  Graft damage elicited by alloreactive T and B cells primed through the direct and/or
  indirect allorecognition pathways results in the release of alloantigens and self-antigens.
  Auto and alloantigens shed from the injured graft are processed and presented through
  the indirect recognition pathway by host antigen presenting cells in the context
  of HLA class II molecules. The development of autoreactive cellular and humoral
  immune responses to self-antigens is secondary to alloimmune responses where repeated
  exposure of recipient CD4+ T cells to self-antigens and pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-2, INF γ, IL-17a) overrides the threshold for self-tolerance.
