caption: A model of the rapid glucocorticoid actions in PVN parvocellular neurons.
  The proposed mechanisms include glucocorticoid (CORT) binding to a G-protein-coupled
  glucocorticoid receptor (GRmb) and activation of an intracellular signaling pathway
  (dashed arrow) that leads to endocannabinoid synthesis (+). Endocannabinoid (CB)
  is released from the PVN neuron and binds to a G-protein-coupled CB1 cannabinoid
  receptor (CBR) on presynaptic glutamate terminals, activating a signaling cascade
  (dashed arrow) that leads to the inhibition of glutamate (GLU) release onto the
  PVN neuron-leading to decreased PVN neuronal activity and hormone secretion.
