caption: A schematic diagram of the DM effect on cell adhesion-mediated activation
  of signaling and osteogenesis. DM increased the expression of Col-I, Integrin α2
  and β1 expression, which led to activation of FAK, followed by ERK activation and
  Runx2 expression, resulting in mMSC differentiation towards osteoblast.
