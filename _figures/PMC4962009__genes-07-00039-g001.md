caption: Replicative aging cooperates with other aging mechanisms to activate the
  p53 and/or Rb signaling pathways. ATM and ATR are sensors of DNA double- and single-strand
  damage induced by replicative senescence or other DNA damage. Activated ATM and
  ATR trigger checkpoint responses to induce cell cycle arrest. A stronger stimulation
  of p53 may lead to apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.
  Telomere length and cell function can be preserved by the reserve transcriptase
  telomerase, which synthesizes the new telomeric DNA from the RNA template. Telomerase
  may help to avoid senescence and to rejuvenate tissues, but is also permissive for
  carcinogenesis. Senescence may help to prevent tumor growth but can also be overcome
  by a process called crisis, and then has paracrine and other pro-tumorigenic effects.
