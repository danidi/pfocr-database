caption: 'Model of hexokinase-dependent glucose pathways in C. zofingiensis. Hexokinase
  (CzHXK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose (Glc) to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)
  in the first step of glycolysis. G6P can be used in a variety of downstream processes,
  including glycolysis, starch and cell wall biosynthesis, and the pentose phosphate
  pathway. There are two possible mechanisms for CzHXK1-dependent glucose responses:
  (1) glucose-bound CzHXK1 initiates a signaling cascade with unknown intermediaries
  to regulate gene expression and (2) metabolic intermediates or derivatives of the
  glycolytic pathway are required to induce the glucose phenotype. These pathways
  may also work in tandem for glucose signaling and glucose responses. CzHXK-derived
  G6P feeds into glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in the accumulation
  of TAGs and cytoplasmic lipid droplets'
