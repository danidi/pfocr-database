caption: Seventeen molecular interactions in apoptotic cells were considered in the
  model. The input of the model was radiation-induced activation of C3, C7, and NFκB.
  Through the pathway, the activated molecules could result in secretion of PGE2 into
  the cell's microenvironment. The secreted PGE2 may promote proliferation of stem
  cells, progenitor cells, and tumor cells in surrounding regions. The mathematical
  model was used to simulate the dynamics of PGE2 synthesis and how inhibitions of
  different molecular players in the pathway affected PGE2 synthesis.
