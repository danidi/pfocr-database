caption: A schematic illustration of the SILAC-based quantitative whole proteomic/phosphoproteomic
  pipeline. Two populations of MEFs were cultured in ‘light’ or ‘heavy’ medium, separately.
  The cells grown in ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ medium were incubated in the presence of
  vehicle and 4-OHT, respectively. After lysis, the samples were mixed, digested with
  trypsin, desalted on a C18 column and subjected to lyophilization. 80% of the peptide
  mixture was subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-based phosphopeptide enrichment.
  The residual 20% of the peptide mixture was fractionated by SCX. The 90% of the
  SCX-fractionated peptides were merged and subjected to TiO2-based phosphopeptide
  enrichment. The enriched phosphopeptides from both enrichment methods were analyzed
  by LC-MS/MS. The residual 10% of SCX-fractionated peptides were also merged and
  analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The resulting high-resolution mass spectra reveal the changes
  of the phosphorylation status on each site and of the expression level of the protein
  by inducible deletion of OGT.
