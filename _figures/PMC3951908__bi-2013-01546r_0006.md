caption: Legionaminic acid biosynthetic pathway in C. jejuni. The initial steps in
  the pathway afford the GDP-GlcNAc intermediate utilized in the formation of GDP-diNAcBac.
  The bifunctional GlmU* was used as the acetyltransferase for the formation of GDP-GlcNAc
  in these studies; however, the enzyme responsible for this reaction in vivo has
  not been characterized. The final three steps in the conversion of GDP-diNAcBac
  into CMP-legionaminic acid are conducted by C. jejuni homologs of LegG, LegI, and
  LegF.
