caption: Schematic representation of molecular events involving IRFs in immune responses.
  (A) Role of IRFs in IFN signalling. In type I IFN responses, IFN‐α/β binds to its
  receptor and activates JAK1/Tyk2, leading to the recruitment and phosphorylation
  of STAT2/STAT1. IRF9 forms a complex with the phosphorylated STAT factors, translocates
  to the nucleus, and activates IFN‐inducible genes. In type II IFN signalling, the
  STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 and STAT1/STAT1/IRF9 complexes form in a similar pathway. (B) IRFs
  in cytosolic PRRs. In response to viral infection, RIG‐I or MDA5 recognizes viral
  RNA and binds to CARDIF/IPS1/MAVS/VISA, leading to the phosphorylation of IRF3 and
  IRF7 through TBK1. The phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 undergo homo‐ or hetero‐dimerization
  and nuclear translocation, thereby binding to ISRE DNA sequences and activating
  IFNs and other target genes. In some cases, IRF5 and IRF8 also participate in PRR
  signalling. (C) IRFs in TLR signalling. Depending on adaptor types, TLR signalling
  is divided into MyD88‐dependent and TRIF‐dependent pathways. TLR3 and TLR4 respond
  to stimuli and activate IRF kinase TBK1 mainly through a MyD88‐independent pathway.
  TBK1 subsequently phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7, resulting in their dimerization
  and translocation to the nucleus. In contrast to IRF3 and IRF4, TLR7 and TLR9 trigger
  IRF activation mainly through a MyD88‐dependent pathway. IRF5 and IRF7 directly
  bind to MyD88 or TRAF6, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus. IRF4 inhibits
  the interaction of IRF5 with MyD88.
