caption: Smad-dependent signaling and Smad-independent BMP signaling originate from
  distinct endocytic routes of the BMP receptors. Smad-dependent signaling is initiated
  upon BMP-2 binding to PFCs, which exist in an inactive state at the cell surface
  prior to ligand binding (). Activation of this signaling cascade by BMP-2 binding
  results in the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 by the type I receptor. This step in Smad
  signaling occurs while the receptors reside at the plasma membrane; inhibition of
  endocytosis (treatment with chlorpromazine or expression of dominant negative dynamin)
  does not affect BMP-2-mediated Smad phosphorylation. Subsequent endocytosis of the
  receptors through CCPs, however, is needed to transmit the Smad signal into the
  nucleus to control the transcriptional activity of target genes. Treatment with
  lovastatin to perturb cholesterol-dependent plasma membrane regions does not affect
  Smad signaling but reduces BMP-2-mediated ALP induction through a Smad-independent
  cascade. This signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of BMP-2 to high-affinity
  BRI, and a subsequent recruitment of BRII into the signaling receptor complex BISC
  occurs (). From the data presented here, we conclude that Smad-independent signaling
  resulting in ALP induction starts from receptors (BISCs) residing in cholesterol-enriched
  plasma membrane regions.
