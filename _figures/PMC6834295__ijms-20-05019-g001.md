caption: Metabolic rewiring in the different Rubisco dependent E. coli (RDE) screens.
  All RDE screens contain arabinose inducible BAD promoter-regulated prk genes whose
  product, phosphoribulokinase (PRK), phosphorylates ribulose 5-phosphate (R5P, produced
  in the pentose phosphate pathway, PPP) into RuBP. The toxicity of this reaction
  can be alleviated by expressing Rubisco to catalyse RuBP carboxylation into metabolically
  compatible 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA). Cell growth can also arise from mutations
  that silence PRK to produce false positives (in which colony growth is independent
  of Rubisco activity). (a) The frequency of false positives in wild-type E. coli
  RDE screens is high (~0.5% of plated cells, left panel) reducing the number of colony-forming
  units (cfu) that can be effectively screened per plate. (b) The false positives
  frequency is >5-fold lower in the MM1 RDE system (middle panel) in which the gapA
  gene is deleted to stop flux through the glycolysis pathway []. (c) In RDE2, expressing
  PRK as an neomycin phoshotransferase II (NPTII) fusion prevents false positive selection,
  as silencing PRK co-suppresses NPTII expression, resulting in kanamycin sensitivity
  [].
