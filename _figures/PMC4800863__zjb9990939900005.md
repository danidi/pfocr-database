caption: 'Schematic illustrations of l- and d-proline metabolism in Sinorhizobium
  meliloti. The biosynthetic and catabolic pathways for l-proline biosynthesis from
  l-glutamate are shown, as is the proposed pathway for d-proline catabolism. l-Proline
  and d-proline are highlighted by gray shading. The association of proteins to each
  biochemical reaction is based on the work reported here and elsewhere (, , , , ).
  Abbreviations: Pyr5C, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate; Pyr2C, Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate;
  γ-glutamyl-5-P, γ-glutamyl-5-phosphate; Pi, phosphate.'
