caption: Tentative metabolic pathway model of membrane-bound electron transport in
  Methanoperedens. Reverse methanogenesis produces F420H2 and the thiol cofactors
  CoM-SH and CoB-SH as well as reduced ferredoxin (Fdred). F420H2 may be oxidized
  by the F420H2 dehydrogenase (Fqo) and electrons transferred to menaquinone (MQ,
  menaquinone; MQH2, menaquinol). The heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) reaction is
  reversed resulting in quinone reduction upon CoM-S-S-CoB (heterodisulfide) production.
  Menaquinol can be oxidized by a Rieske-cytochrome b complex comprising two additional
  cytochrome c subunits. Electrons are transferred to an unusual nitrate reductase
  (Nar) complex, presumably via soluble cytochrome c (cytcox/red, oxidized/reduced
  cytochrome c), to reduce nitrate to nitrite. A small part of the nitrite can further
  be reduced to ammonium by nitrite reductase (Nrf) with menaquinol as electron donor.
  The fate of reduced ferredoxin is unclear. It could either be oxidized by Ech hydrogenase,
  by FrhB or FqoF (homologous to each other) alone or by the hypothesized confurcating
  HdrABC-FrhB enzyme complex. For more details, see text. Methyltransferase (Mtr)
  and A1AO ATP synthase make use of the proton motif force built up by the respiratory
  chain. This metabolic construction is solely based on genome analysis. HCO II, heme
  copper oxidase subunit II like proteins; cytb, cytochrome b; cytc, cytochrome c;
  FeS, iron-sulfur cluster; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide;
  MPT, molybdopterin; NiFe, nickel-iron center.
