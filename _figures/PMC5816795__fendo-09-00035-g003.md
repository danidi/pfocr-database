caption: The Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  signaling pathway initiated by the activated growth hormone receptor. Activated
  JAK2 phosphorylates tyrosines on the intracellular domain of the receptor. Inactive-STAT5
  dimers bind these phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptor, and the STAT5
  is subsequently phosphorylated by JAK2 forming different active-STAT5 dimers that
  are translocated to the nucleus, bind DNA, and act as transcription factors. STAT1
  and STAT3 are phosphorylated and activated by JAK2. Active STAT1 and STAT3 form
  homodimers or heterodimers, are translocated to the nucleus, bind DNA, and act as
  transcription factors.
