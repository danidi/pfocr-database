caption: General model for basigin promotes the membrane localization of CD98 and
  activation of β1-integrin. Basigin could facilitate the membrane localization of
  newly synthesized CD98 in the ER (blue arrow). Prototypical CIE cargo proteins enter
  cells through Arf6-positive endocytic vesicles that either fuse with or mature into
  Rab5a-positive early endosomes (sorting endosomes), where internalized proteins
  converge and are sorted for recycling (green arrow) or degradation (red arrow).
  Basigin and CD98 are internalized by a pathway associated with flotillin-1 and the
  small G protein Arf6. Thereafter, basigin and CD98 could recycle back to the membrane
  through the fast recycling pathway (green arrow A) mediated by hook1, Rab22a, microtubules
  and their own cytoplasmic sequences. Other internalized proteins, including integrins,
  could recycle through the slow recycling pathway (green arrow B). By promoting the
  membrane redistribution or translocation of CD98, basigin activates β1 integrins
  and plays a critical role in liver cancer progression
