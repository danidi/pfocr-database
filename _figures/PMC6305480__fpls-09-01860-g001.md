caption: Schematics of carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways with key enzymes, metabolites,
  and transporters in determinate nodules and indeterminate nodules. Sucrose in the
  plant cytosol is split into glucose and fructose by AI or UDP-Glc and fructose via
  SS, which is then catabolized via glycolysis to PEP. Carbon from PEP and carbonic
  acid is diverted to OAA and then malate by PEPC and the neMDH, respectively. OAA
  may be further converted to succinate or fumarate. Carbon sources are transported
  across the peribacteroid and bacteroid membranes and enter the TCA cycle in the
  bacteroid to be metabolized. Transport of inorganic ions and cofactors required
  for SNF across the SM is indicated. The ammonia produced by the SNF is transported
  back to the plant and assimilated by GS and GOGAT into Gln and Glu (blue arrows).
  In indeterminate nodules, Glu and Gln are further converted to Asp and Asn by AAT
  and AS, respectively (red arrows). In determinate nodules, Gln enters purine synthesis
  pathway and is converted to ureides (brown arrows). AI, alkaline invertase; UDP-Glc,
