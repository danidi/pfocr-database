caption: a A signalling molecule (AMP) is produced by the Sender population and diffuses
  to the Receiver population, where it is perceived, processed, and an internal response
  is generated. The Response Cascade encapsulated in the Receivers is capable of signal
  amplification by allosteric activation of the first enzyme in a cascade that ultimately
  generates NADH, which is an important anabolic metabolite and here specifically
  used as fluorescent reporter of successful communication. b The signal amplification
  in the Receivers permits communication over long distances, despite strong dilution
  of the chemical signal in the external milieu.
