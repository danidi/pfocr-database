caption: Core biosynthetic pathway for Amaryllidaceae alkaloids. Phenylalanine is
  converted to trans-cinnamic acid by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and then to
  4-hydroxycinnamic acid by CYP73A1. 4-hydroxycinnamic acid is potentially converted
  to 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by CYP98A3 or to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and then to
  3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde potentially by a VpVAN paralogue. Tyrosine is converted
  to tyramine by tyrosine decarboxylase. 3,4-dihyroxybenzaldehyde and tyramine are
  condensed to form a Schiff-base that is reduced by an unknown reductase into norbelladine.
  Norbelladine is methylated by norbelladine 4′-O-methyltransferase (N4OMT) into 4′-O-methylnorbelladine.
