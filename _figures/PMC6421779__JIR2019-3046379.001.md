caption: Canonical pathway for miRNA biogenesis. Transcription of miRNA genes results
  in the formation of primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). Cleavage of pri-miRNA by the Drosha-DiGeorge
  Syndrome Critical Region 8 (Drosha-DGCR8) complex produces precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA).
  Pre-miRNAs are then transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the exportin
  5/RanGTP transport complex followed by terminal loop cleavage by endoribonuclease
  Dicer to produce mature miRNA/miRNA duplex. Red and blue strands in mature miRNA/miRNA
  duplex represent passenger and guide strands, respectively. The duplex is loaded
  into the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins, and the passenger strand of the duplex
  is degraded while the guide strand is retained, forming the miRNA-induced silencing
  complex (miRISC). The guide strand directs miRISC to target mRNAs, resulting in
  mRNA degradation and/or translational repression. miRISC directly cleaves target
  mRNA with perfect compatibility with miRNA. For mRNA with a partial complementary
  target site, miRISC suppresses its translation initiation by disturbing the formation
  of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), a multiprotein complex composed
  of eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A subunits. Besides, GW182 proteins which are recruited
  to the miRISC cause translational repression and deadenylation of target mRNAs by
  the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT and Pan2/Pan3 deadenylase complexes.
