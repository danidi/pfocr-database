caption: piRNAs related to the epigenetic control of pathways involved in vesicles
  transport, phagocytosis, demyelination, apoptosis, inflammation, loss of sensation,
  and pain are differentially expressed in leprosy patient (LP). DE piRNAs do not
  act on the same targets of miRNA, but they synergistically regulate the same pathway,
  e.g., infection route by AKA1, TMEM59 and ITSN1 involved in mycobacterial endocytosis
  in neurons and anti-apoptotic pathways (CARF). Skin anesthesia or hypoesthesia and
  pain are characteristic of leprosy and have been related to calcium and potassium
  channel proteins, including SHISA6, KCNMA1, KCNQ2, KCNH1, CACNA1C, SLC1A2 and KCNK13,
  which are all targets of piRNAs DE. Inflammation and neuropathic pain are part of
  leprosy clinical aspects and may be moderated by MAPK, HOMER1, PLEKHG4, SLC4A2,
  GLI4, and DUSP8 by RHOA pathways. ETV6 and CARF are associated with neural regeneration
  and differentiation of stem cells into Schwann cells. Other important mechanisms
  of regulating SC maturation and axon regeneration after nerve injury are promoted
  by pro-regenerative macrophages and are dependent on GGCX, vitamin K, IL-6R and
  DUSP8 induced by GAS6 stimulation. Pro-regenerative macrophages clear debris in
  the nerve microenvironment and are essential for axon regeneration. The permanence
  of pro-regenerative macrophages in the lesional microenvironment promote remyelination
  and SC differentiation, reducing immature SC density.
