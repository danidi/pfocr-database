caption: The pathway of PUFA synthesis in C. elegans. Horizontal or slanted arrows
  represent fatty acid desaturation. Vertical arrows represent fatty acid elongation.
  For the desaturation steps, the desaturase activity is noted above the arrow, and
  the C. elegans gene encoding this enzymatic activity is listed below the arrow.
