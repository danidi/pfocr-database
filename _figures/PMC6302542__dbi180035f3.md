caption: 'Leptin regulates fatty acid oxidation in muscle by activating AMPK. A: Leptin
  activates α2-AMPK in red skeletal muscle through two distinct mechanisms. Early
  activation of AMPK after intravenous leptin administration appears to be direct,
  whereas later activation depends on the hypothalamic–sympathetic nervous system
  axis. Leptin’s effect to activate AMPK is associated with suppression of acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC) activity and results in stimulation of fatty acid oxidation. Panel
  A reprinted from Minokoshi et al. (). B: Leptin inhibits α2-AMPK activity in the
  arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), and this is necessary to decrease
  food intake in response to leptin. Panel B reprinted from Minokoshi et al. (). C:
  Schematic of how white adipose tissue regulates whole-body metabolism. Through its
  endocrine actions—in this case, leptin—white adipose tissue can modulate AMPK signaling
  in other tissues. This is fundamental to maintaining energy supplies at the cellular
  level, and this pathway stimulates fatty acid oxidation in muscle. In addition,
  leptin secreted from white adipose tissue inhibits the AMPK pathway in the hypothalamus
  to regulate food intake and energy expenditure and ultimately body weight. Our early
  work with leptin and AMPK provided strong evidence that adipose-derived molecules
  could modulate fundamental cellular pathways that have regulatory effects on the
  whole body.'
