caption: 'DR4 and DR5 Agonistic mAb-induced Apoptosis: Regulation of TRAIL/Apo2L Resistance
  by HDACi. Anti-DR4 and -DR5 agonistic mAbs induce apoptosis by binding to and trimerizing
  death receptors in place of TRAIL/Apo2L. Recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) can also
  be used, however, mAbs are more effective due to longer half-life in vivo. Ligation
  of anti-DR4 (4H6, AY4, HGS-ETR1) and anti-DR5 (such as MD5-1, KMTR2, TRA-8, and
  Drozitumab) agonistic mAbs to their cognate receptors (DR4 and DR5, respectively)
  leads to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and apoptosis
  (as detailed in ). HDACi such as SAHA and VPA, enhance death receptor mediated apoptotic
  signaling by decreasing cellular levels of anti-apoptotic molecules including c-Flip,
  reducing the expression levels of Bcl-2 and c-IAP family members, and increasing
  levels pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (BAK, BAX, BID, BAD, BIK). SAHA and VPA
  also increase surface expression of death receptors DR4 and DR5. By altering the
  dynamics of intracellular signaling pathways and changing the ratio of anti/proapoptotic
  molecules, HDACis favor the formation of a proapoptotic milieu and increase the
  efficiency of mAbs as anti-cancer agents, thus, overcoming resistance.'
