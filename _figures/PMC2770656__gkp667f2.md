caption: A visualized example of sub-pathway mining. (a) A metabolic pathway in KEGG,
  citrate cycle (TCA cycle). (b) The metabolic pathway is converted to the undirected
  graph using our pathway simplification programming (the function updateGraphs in
  SubpathwayMiner). (c) A 3-clique sub-pathway in which distance between any two enzymes
  is no >3. It is mined from the undirected graph that the pathway corresponds to
  (surrounded by a black line in a and b).
