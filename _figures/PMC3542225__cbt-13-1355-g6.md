caption: 'Figure 6. De novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. The de novo purine
  nucleotide biosynthetic pathway from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to IMP
  is shown. The numbered reactions are catalyzed by the following monofunctional enzymes:
  1, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (GPAT); 4, formylglycinamide
  ribonucleotide synthase (FGAM synthetase); and 8, adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL).
  Reactions 2, 3 and 5 are catalyzed by the trifunctional glycinamide ribonucleotide
  (GAR) formyltransferase (GARFTase) which contains GAR synthase (GARS; reaction 2),
  GAR formyltransferase (GARFTase; reaction 3) and 5-amino-4-imidazole ribonucleotide
  synthase (AIRS; reaction 5) activities. Reactions 6 and 7 are catalyzed by the bifunctional
  phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase/ phosphoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide
  synthetase (PAICS) enzyme, which contains carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthase
  (CAIRS; reaction 6) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-(N-succinylocarboxamide) ribonucleotide
  synthase (SAICARS; reaction 7) activities. Reactions 9 and 10 are catalyzed by a
  bifunctional enzyme, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) formyltransferase
  (AICARFTase)/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC) that sequentially catalyzes the last two
  steps in the pathway for de novo synthesis of IMP. Folate-dependent reactions (reactions
  3 and 9) in which 10-CHO-THF serves as the one-carbon donor are catalyzed by GARFTase
  and AICARFTase. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA) and AICAR can be metabolized
  to AICAR monophosphate (ZMP) by adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) and adenosine
  kinase (AK), respectively, thus circumventing the reaction catalyzed by GARFTase.'
