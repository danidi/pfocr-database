caption: A schematic diagram showing our conclusion that O2.− is locally produced
  from Nox4 in the SR of CAMs in response to M1 receptor activation and that this
  local O2.− production is regulated by cADPR-RyR-Ca2+signaling pathway. Given the
  great sensitivity of RyRs to redox changes, increased local O2.− level may enhance
  the activation of these receptors, leading to a feed forward regulation of both
  redox and Ca2+signaling in CAMs.
