caption: HG stimulation induces upregulation of Orai1. Then, Orai1-mediated Ca2+ entry
  targets CnA to inhibit Drp1 phosphorylation at S637, inducing cardiac hypertrophy.
  Orai1-mediated Ca2+ entry also targets p-ERK1/2 to induce Drp1 phosphorylation at
  S616. Phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616 is increased, while phosphorylation of Drp1
  at S637 is decreased, promoting mitochondrial fission and accelerating HG-induced
  cardiac hypertrophy. Inhibition of the Orai1–Drp1 signaling pathway could prevent
  cardiac hypertrophy induced by HG.
