caption: The Ca2+ toolkit in endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC). Growth factors,
  such as VEGF, and chemokines, such as stromal derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), bind to
  specific RTK and Gq/11PCR, thereby activating multiple PLC isoforms, which in turn
  cleave PIP2 into InsP3 and DAG. InsP3 triggers ER-dependent Ca2+ release through
  InsP3R, while DAG gates TRPC3 exclusively in umbilical cord blood-derived ECFCs.
  SOCE is the major Ca2+ entry pathway also in ECFC, in which it is mediated by the
  dynamic interplay among STIM1, Orai1 and TRPC1. Endogenous Ca2+ release is further
  supported by NAADP, which evokes EL Ca2+ release through TPC1. SERCA and PMCA contribute
  to maintain resting Ca2+ levels and clear cytosolic Ca2+ after a pro-angiogenic
  Ca2+ signal. Pro-angiogenic Ca2+ signals may also be delivered by TRP Vanilloid
  1 (TRPV1) and TRPV4. See . (SDF-1α) and . (VEGF and NAADP) for further details.
