caption: 'Working Model for regulation of prostate cancer. Schematic diagram shows
  the proposed mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of I3C and DIM on LPS induction
  of IL-1β mRNA and protein, mediated through AHR, and not the CD84-mediated pathway.
  I3C and DIM down-regulated CD84 mRNA, but not protein levels in an AHR-dependent
  manner. Activation of AHR is indicated by upregulation of CYP1B1, a well-documented
  AHR-responsive gene. The classic AHR ligand, b-NF, exerts similar effects as I3C/DIM
  on IL-1β, CD84, and CYP1B1 mRNA, but only b-NF inhibited LPS-induction of IL-6 mRNA
  levels. Solid line: Effects of I3C/DIM. Dotted line: Effects of b-NF. Bold X: Based
  on our data, the pathway does not occur. DIM is known to be an acid condensation
  product of I3C. The effectiveness of I3C and DIM on the pathway examined is best
  differentiated by dose dependence of the compounds. Specifically, DIM elicits an
  effect at a much lower concentration than I3C. However, our results indicate that
  both I3C and DIM can influence the AHR pathway. Hence, I3C and DIM may directly
  influence immune cells and also modulate cancer cell-stromal cell interaction to
  exert their cancer protective effects. The overall effect would reduce monocyte/macrophage
  infiltration, inflammation and potential for angiogenesis in the prostatic tumor.
  Further investigations are necessary to validate this hypothesis in vivo in prostate
  cancer.'
