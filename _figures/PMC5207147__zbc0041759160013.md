caption: Proposed model on the cross-talk between HGF/c-Met and SphK1/S1P/Spns2/S1P1signaling
  axis in HGF-mediated lamellipodia formation. In this model, HGF initiates activation
  of its receptor c-Met, which initiates phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. Activation
  of ERK by HGF stimulates SphK1 phosphorylation, which in turn converts sphingosine
  into S1P. HGF-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt pathway phosphorylates S1P transporter,
  Spns2, which facilitates efflux of intracellular S1P to extracellular milieu. The
  secreted S1P binds to its receptor S1P1 to initiate downstream pathways mediating
  lamellipodia formation of lung ECs. This proposed schema is a static model and does
  not convey the possibility that in a dynamic model the interacting partners might
  function differently over time.
