caption: A schematic diagram elucidating signalling pathway of TLR4 and TLR9 responsible
  for GFNs-induced cytotoxicity. GFNs can be recognized by TLRs, thus activate IKK
  and IκB by a MyD88-dependent mechanism, resulting in the release of NF-κB subunits
  and initiating the translocation into the nucleus. Thus, pro-inflammatory factors
  were transcribed and secreted out of nucleus, modulating the immune responses initiating
  programmed autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis
