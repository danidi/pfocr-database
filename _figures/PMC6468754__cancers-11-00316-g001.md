number: Figure 1
caption: Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  link the angiogenesis signaling pathways. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) results in
  constitutive activation of the HIF pathway and VEGF. The tumor hypoxic environment
  leads to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by inducing regulatory T cells
  (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and M2 tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs). Antiangiogenic therapy results in blood vessel regression by suppression
  of neovascularization, leading to tumor starvation and tumors falling into dormant
  states. CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; iDCs, immature dendritic cells; mDCs,
  mature dendritic cells; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; VCAM-1, vascular
  cell adhesion molecule 1.
