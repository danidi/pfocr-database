caption: Schematic diagram showing the mechanisms contributing to the development
  of lung disease of ZZ-AT homozygotes. The left side of the diagram details our new
  findings; the right side (separated by the dashed line) shows what is already established
  in the study of α1-antitrypsin (AT) deficiency. Severe deficiency of AT is the main
  predisposing factor to emphysema. In addition, there is baseline intracellular polymerization
  and aggregation in alveolar epithelial cells, which activates endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress. Oxidants from cigarette smoke (CS) and inflammatory cells potentiate
  this process by accelerating the formation of oxidized-polymeric Z-AT, which in
  turn activates protein kinase RNA–like ER kinase (PERK)-dependent nuclear factor
  (NF)-κB production of inflammatory mediators contributing to lung damage. Confirmation
  of this pathway is provided by the interruption of this process by (1) targeting
  the structural differences in Z-AT by directly preventing polymerization (with 4M),
  (2) by inhibiting oxidant-mediated acceleration of polymerization with an antioxidant
  (N-acetylcysteine), and (3) inhibiting PERK with the PERK inhibitor I (GSK2606414).
  CS-induced ER overload response markers; PERK, activator transcription factor (ATF)
  4, and regulator of G-protein signaling protein 16 (RGS16), and the ER chaperone
  calnexin could be inhibited below the expression level of non–CS exposed Z-AT cells
  independently by both the inhibitor of Z-AT polymerization, 4M or an antioxidant,
  N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Diagram also shows the previously reported effect of oxidants
  on inducing polymerization of extracellular Z-AT in plasma and lung, further resulting
  in reduced inhibitory activity of Z-AT and an effect on neutrophil chemotaxis (,
  ).
