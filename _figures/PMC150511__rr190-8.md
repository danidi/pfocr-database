caption: Schematic diagram of HIF-1α activation circuits and oxygen-signaling mechanisms
  in hypoxia. The reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) forms reduced glutathione
  (2GSH), capable of inducing HIF-1α activation. GSSG recycling to GSH is blocked
  by 1,3- bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), a specific glutathione reductase
  inhibitor, thus increasing intracellular [GSSG], a potent inhibitor of DNA binding.
  In oxidative stress, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase is transformed from the native,
  inactive form (nγ-GCS) to the active form (γ-GCS), which increases de novo synthesis
  of GSH. This pathway is blocked by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), an irreversible
  inhibitor of γ-GCS, thus affecting HIF-1α activation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  derived from oxygen metabolites (ROOH), tend to block the activation of HIF-1α.
  N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, releases this inhibitory effect by scavenging
  ROS. NAC, in addition, is a major precursor of GSH, a thiol antioxidant, thereby
  elevating [GSH] (↑GSH) and inducing HIF-1α activation. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate
  (PDTC) is an antioxidant; although it possesses ROS-scavenging properties, its ability
  to activate HIF-1α under reducing conditions is not established. PDTC (as a pro-oxidant),
  like other dithiocarbamates, lowers the GSH/GSSG ratio by oxidizing GSH. The elevated
  [GSSG] (↑GSSG) has the potential to block HIF-1α activation. Upon HIF-1α binding
  to the hypoxia response element (HRE), hypoxia-responsive genes are upregulated.
