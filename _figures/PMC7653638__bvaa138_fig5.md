caption: Model of FGFR1 and KLB effect on endocrine vs canonical FGF signaling. A)
  The endocrine FGF (FGF21) requires the binding of FGFR1 and a transmembrane cofactor
  KLB. This allows for diffusion through the blood stream and mediates its endocrine
  effects. B) The D1 domain of FGFR1 acts to sterically inhibit binding of FGF21 to
  the binding pocket between the D2 and D3 domains. KLB helps facilitate this interaction,
  strongly potentiating the binding of FGF21 to FGFR1. Binding of FGF21 to the FGFR1-KLB
  receptor complex activates an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain leading the downstream
  signaling, including the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK). Hypothetically the missense mutations may prevent the formation of the FGFR1-KLB
  receptor complex. C) In contrast to endocrine FGF signaling, canonical FGF signaling
  (i.e., FGF2) depends on heparin/heparan sulfate as a cofactor. Thus, this acts in
  a paracrine fashion. Binding of FGF2 to the FGFR1-Heparin complex stimulates activation
  of the tyrosine kinase domain, and subsequent ERK phosphorylation. D) Hypothetically
  heparan sulfate is able to overcome the FGFR1 missense mutation leading to intact
  downstream signaling.
