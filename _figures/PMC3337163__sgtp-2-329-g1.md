caption: Ras activation of RalA leads to engagement of multiple effector pathways.
  The RalGEF-Ral signaling pathway is a key effector pathway downstream of activated
  Ras. Activation of RalA in turn leads to activation of several downstream signaling
  pathways affecting diverse cellular processes, including exocytosis, endocytosis,
  actin dynamics and transcription. New evidence also indicates that following phosphorylation
  by Aurora A, RalA and its effector RalBP1 play a key role in the regulation of mitochondrial
  fission during mitosis by regulating the phosphorylation of Drp1 and its recruitment
  to mitochondrial membranes. “*” denotes proteins whose expression or activity have
  been reported to be elevated in human cancer.
