caption: The upregulated HCV gene signature is enriched for interferon (IFN) pathway
  genes. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to find significantly enriched pathways
  and networks among the genes that were upregulated in chronic HCV infection. (a)
  The IFN pathway was found to be significantly enriched (P<0.0001), with several
  signature genes (shaded) occurring downstream of Jak-Stat signaling. (b) Many direct
  (solid arrow) and indirect (dashed arrow) interactions were identified among the
  signature genes (shaded), and others related to the IFN response.
