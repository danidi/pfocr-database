caption: 'Insulin signaling cascades regulate GLUT4 trafficking by intracellular itinerary.
  (a) PI3K-mediated insulin signaling pathway: Being active by insulin binding, this
  pathway leads to the involvement and phosphorylation of IRS adaptor proteins. Tyrosine
  phosphorylated IRS proteins bind with PI3K. The interaction of IRS proteins and
  PI3K consequences in the activation of PI3K and this catalyzes the successive synthesis
  of PIP3 from PIP2 at the plasma membrane. PIP3 in turn acts as a docking site for
  several pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing Serine/threonine kinases that
  are implicated in glucose uptake, including phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
  (PDK1) and AKT. Through dual serine/threonine phosphorylation, PDK1 and mammalian
  target of rapamycin 2 (mTORC2) activate AKT. AKT then stimulates the small GTPases,
  AS160 and the RAL-GAP complex (RGC) which are involved in GLUT4 vesicle translocation,
  directed to the plasma membrane. (b) APS-dependent insulin signaling pathway: Insulin
  binding also initiates an APS-dependent insulin signaling cascades by recruiting
  and tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein APS. Upon IR phosphorylation,
  APS recruits a complex that includes c-CBL (protein encoded by CBL gene) and catabolite
  activator protein (CAP). This causes insulin receptor-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation
  of c-CBL. Phosphorylated c-CBL then activates the adaptor protein CRK, which is
  in intricate with C3G which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). C3G in
  turn activates TC10 which is originated in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. Active
  TC10 (a member of small GTP-binding proteins) regulates GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis
  by interacting with several effector proteins. One TC10 binding protein, CIP4, recruits
  a stable complex with the RAB GEF GAPEX5. This regulates GLUT4 vesicles retention
  and translocation. Another EXO70 (a subunit of exorcist complex), TC10 effector
  protein and a subunit of the exocyst tethering complex, has been implicated in GLUT4
  vesicle targeting.'
