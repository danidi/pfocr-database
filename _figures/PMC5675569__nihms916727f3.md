caption: 'Network of selected factors influencing myofibroblast survival/resistance
  to apoptosis. Several integrin-activated signaling pathways are involved in myofibroblast
  survival. The prominent role of the AKT survival pathway is demonstrated by the
  convergence of multiple pathways. Recent results showing the role of WNT/βcatenin,
  TWIST1 and FIZZ1 pathways are also illustrated (The question marks indicate where
  literature or our own studies suggest an effect, but mechanism is unknown. See text
  of article). Abbreviations: AKT, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog; APAF-1,
  apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1; Bcl-2, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2; CASP, caspase;

  endothelin 1; FAK, PTK2 protein tyrosine kinase 2; FasL, FAS (TNF receptor superfamily,
