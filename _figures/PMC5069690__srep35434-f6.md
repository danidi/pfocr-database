caption: Chlorpromazine induces oxidative stress, which is associated with the disruption
  of the F-actin cytoskeleton integrity, leading to intracellular BA accumulation.
  The oxidative stress is further synergistically enhanced by chlorpromazine and the
  accumulated BAs at toxic concentrations. In addition, chlorpromazine inhibits the
  expression of ABCB11, encoding BSEP, further aggravating BA accumulation. The accumulated
  toxic BAs induce DR5 expression, leading to the activation of the death receptor
  signalling pathway. Collectively, these events result in cell death.
