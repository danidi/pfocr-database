caption: Regulation of Wnt signaling in Xenopus CNC. Wnt signaling is involved in
  the induction and specification of the CNC via the canonical pathway mediated by
  Wnt-11, Fz-7 and Dsh, stabilizing β-catenin to promote Lef/TCF-dependent gene transcription.
  Alternatively, Dsh stabilizes p120-Cat to promote expression of these same genes,
  including Wnt-11; thus, providing a positive feedback loop. Cadherin-11 binds to
  both β-catenin and p120-catenin maintaining a membrane bound pool. In addition,
  Cadherin-11 binds to the (GEF)-Trio and activates small GTPases of the Rho family
  to promote cell protrusion. Fz-7 and Dsh can complex with both PTK-7 and Synd-4
  to mediate either the activation of RhoA and Rac or the inhibition of Rac, respectively.
  In the CNC, Pescadillo expression depends on the presence of Wnt-4 and Fz-3. Knockdown
  of Pescadillo increases apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation and cell migration.
  Apoptosis and cell proliferation defects can be rescued by knocking down p53.
