caption: Expansion of the yeast signaling model using the experiments proposed by
  MEED. The yeast model is depicted in the center of the figure. The identified modules
  are presented, with additional dashed edges connecting the regulators in the pathway
  to their regulatory programs (nodes labeled with regulators and having a boundary
  color-coded according to their regulation function). The ambiguous modules, highlighted
  with dashed yellow squares, are presented as gray-filled nodes, labeled with their
  size and connected by edges to all their matching regulatory program nodes. The
  two ambiguous modules were subject to an additional MEED iteration, which succeeds
  to distinguish their regulatory programs using only two additional experiments.
  Matrices showing the expression measurements of target genes (rows) across the eleven
  experiments proposed using MEED (columns) are presented only for the modules that
  contain at least seven genes. The columns of the expression matrices are ordered
  from left to right according to the order proposed by MEED. For clarity, only subsets
  of the large Ste12 and Kss1/Fus3 matrices are shown. The predicted profiles appear
  as separate rows above the matrices. For most modules, the expression profiles agree
  well with the predicted profiles. Blue arrows exemplify experiments in which majority
  of the module genes disagree with the predicted profile.
