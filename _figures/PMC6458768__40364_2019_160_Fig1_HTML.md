caption: 'CD22 structure and signaling pathway. CD22 molecule is a transmembrane protein
  from SIGLEC (Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins) family. It has three
  parts: (i) V-type Ig domain with sia-binding site, (ii) C1-type Ig domain, (iii)
  C2-type Ig domain. The CD22 intracellular region contains ITIMs (Immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs). The tyrosine residues of the ITIMs become phosphorylated
  with the ligand binding, which leads to activation of SHP-1 (Src homology region
  2 domain-containing phosphatase-1), SHP-2 (Src homology region 2 domain-containing
  phosphatase-2), SHIP-1 ((Src homology region 2 domain-containing inositol 5′ polyphosphatase-1).
  These phosphatases act as negative regulators for down-streaming signaling from
  B-cell receptors'
