caption: Predicted pathways of lactate and pyruvate utilization in D. reducens based
  on proteomic analysis. (A) Dred_0367-9 is proposed to perform lactate oxidation
  in D. reducens. These proteins share similarity with a lactate-oxidizing complex
  recently described in Acetobacterium woodii to operate through flavin-based electron
  bifurcation (FBEB) (Awo_c08730, 20, and 10; Weghoff et al., ). Similarity between
  D. reducens proteins and those from A. woodii is displayed as percent sequence identity
  across percent query coverage (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). (B) Model of lactate
  and/or pyruvate utilization in D. reducens. In lactate-fed cultures, lactate is
  oxidized to pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted to acetate (along with CO2 or formate),
  and H2 is produced during pyruvate fermentation. In lactate-fed conditions, H2 is
  not formed, and instead reduced ferredoxin could be utilized in other pathways,
  including the lactate oxidation pathway. Pathways predicted to be involved in lactate-fed
  cultures are denoted with a blue L. Pathways predicted to be involved in pyruvate-fed
  fermentative cultures are denoted with a green F. Abundance comparisons for proteins
  displayed are in Supplementary Table .
