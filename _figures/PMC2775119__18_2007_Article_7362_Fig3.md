caption: 'Ciliary functions of cystoproteins: mechanosensation and cell cycle control.
  Polycystin-1 (PC-1), polycystin-2 (PC-2) and other cystoproteins (not shown) are
  expressed in primary cilia, basal bodies or centrosomes. The primary cilium forms
  in fully differentiated cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. A cilium protrudes
  from the basal body (centrosome) formed by two centrioles, a mother centriole (blue
  cylinder) and a daughter centriole (orange cylinder). As cells enter the cell cycle,
  the cilium is resorbed, and the centrosome can act as a mitotic spindle pole organizer.
  Flow-induced bending of cilia in renal epithelial cells triggers Ca2+ influx mediated
  by PC-2 in association with PC-1.The role of ciliary proteins in cell cycle control
  is supported by several findings: (1) In the normal state, PC-2 sequesters Id2 [proproliferative
  helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein] in the cytoplasm, preventing it from entering the
  nucleus. In PKD, when PC-1 or PC-2 are inactivated, Id2 translocates to the nucleus
  and interacts with E-protein, blocking its ability to induce growth-suppressive
  genes and resulting in increased activity of cdk2 and activation of cell proliferation;
  (2) PC-1 can activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, resulting in the induction
  of p21waf1 and cell cycle arrest in G0 and G1; (3) The intraflagellar transport
  component IFT88/polaris is capable of controlling G1/S transition of the cell cycle.
  IFT88/polaris remains associated with the centrosome throughout the cell cycle,
  where it forms a complex with Che-1, thus modulating its binding to Rb protein.'
