caption: Multiple components of the RNAi cascade are critical toward maturation of
  miRNA and siRNA complexes in humans. Altered expression of these entities is associated
  with poor outcomes and may limit RNAi function in cells. Introduction of exogenous
  RNAi sequences, such as siRNA, that bypass this machinery, may provide a novel pathway
  toward drug development in cancer therapeutics.
