caption: The proposed new aerobic metabolic pathway of benzoate in A. evansii, with
  a possible mechanism of 2,3-epoxybenzoyl-CoA dihydrolase (BoxC) in detail. Oxygen
  atoms deriving from O2 are indicated in black, and oxygen atoms deriving from H2O
  are in gray. The subsequent conversion of 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA
  and acetyl-CoA is not completely resolved and is therefore shown by a dashed arrow.
