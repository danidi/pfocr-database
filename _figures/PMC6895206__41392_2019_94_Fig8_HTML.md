caption: The activated DNA-PKcs/p53 pathway enhanced Drp1 transcription and migration
  to the mitochondria, inducing mitochondrial fission. Meanwhile, p53 also increased
  the expression of CK2, impairing FUNDC1-required mitophagy via the phosphorylation
  of FUNDC1 at Ser13. The excessive fission and badly structured mitophagy were associated
  with mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to hepatic apoptosis and the progression
  of ARLD.
