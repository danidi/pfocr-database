caption: Schematic of the hypothesized mechanisms of suppression of proinflammatory
  responses by DAEC strain SK1144. DAEC can dilate tight junctions, permitting flagellin
  to reach TLR5 molecules located on the basolateral side of the epithelial cells.
  Subsequent signaling through the NF-κB pathway provides enhanced transcription of
  genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines. However, Hcp, a component of the T6SS
  needle shaft, employs an unknown mechanism to suppress the translation of the cytokine-encoding
  mRNAs.
