caption: 'Figure 2. The different mechanisms by which autophagy is controlled by intracellular
  Ca2+-signaling events. (Left) In basal conditions, constitutive Ins(1,4,5)P3R-mediated
  Ca2+ release toward mitochondria enhances mitochondrial ATP production, inhibiting
  autophagy through inactivation of AMPK. This Ca2+ signal can be abrogated by Xestospongin
  B, but not by BAPTA. (Middle) Upon addition of Ca2+-mobilizing agents, like thapsigargin,
  the ER Ca2+ store is emptied and the cytosolic [Ca2+] gradually increases. The latter
  activates autophagy through a pathway putatively involving CaMKKβ and AMPK. Right:
  Upon rapamycin treatment or after nutrient starvation, the Ins(1,4,5)P3R becomes
  sensitized through the recruitment of Beclin 1 and the increased ER Ca2+-store content,
  both enhancing Ins(1,4,5)P3R-mediated Ca2+signaling, thereby stimulating autophagy.
  These Ca2+ signals are not only suppressed by Xestospongin B but also by BAPTA,
  implying these occur outside the ER-mitochondria microdomains. The target may hence
  be cytosolic and localized at the ER (e.g., CaMKI) or may be connected with the
  lysosomes.'
