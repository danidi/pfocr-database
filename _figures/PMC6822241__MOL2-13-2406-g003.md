caption: Reactome pathway analysis of significant transcripts. Significantly different
  transcript abundances in LUSC (N = 1979) and LUAD tumours (N = 931). The top 15
  over‐represented pathways in LUSC (A) are shown. The level of significance is indicated
  by the intensity of red on the −log10 scale P‐value. Cell cycle and ECM‐receptor
  interaction signalling are the most significant in both LUSC and LUAD. However,
  p53 signalling is only significantly upregulated in LUSC tumours (B) and not in
  LUAD tumours (C). Genes that were found to be differentially expressed in the tumours
  in comparison with normal tissues are shown in red (more abundant) or green (less
  abundant). Genes that were found not to be significant are shown in grey.
