caption: Molecular pathways leading to CRC. The classic pathway accounts for 30-70%
  of CRCs and results in the progression from adenoma to carcinoma. Germline mismatch
  repair mutations lead to Lynch Syndrome, which accounts for approximately one quarter
  of all MSI CRCs. These inherited mutations lead to carcinoma when a second hit occurs
  to result in loss of the wild-type copy. The Serrated/Methylated pathway occurs
  due to the epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 by hypermethylation resulting in a sporadic
  MSI phenotype. CRC, colorectal cancer; MSI, microsatellite instability.
