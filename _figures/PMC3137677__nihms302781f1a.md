caption: In part A, the neuron expresses NAAG synthetase I (NAAGS I), an enzyme that
  mediates the synthesis of NAAG but not NAAG2. In this cell, NAAG is co-released
  with a primary amine transmitter, such as glutamate, under conditions of elevated
  neuronal activity. While the primary transmitter is released into the immediate
  synaptic space, the peptide is released perisynaptically where it activates presynaptic
  and glial type 3 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR3). NAAG is inactivated
  by glutamate carboxypeptidases II (GCPII) and III (GCPIII), forming N-acetylaspartate
  (NAA) and glutamate (Glu), which are transported into glial cells. While GCPIII
  is expressed by neurons and glia in cell culture (), its localization on presynaptic
  ending is purely speculative. High levels of glutamate-mediated neurotransmission
  are associated with several clinical disorders including traumatic brain injury,
  stroke, peripheral neuropathy, inflammatory pain and schizophrenia. NAAG inhibits
  glutamate release by activation of presynaptic mGluR3 receptors. Inhibition of the
  peptidases GCPII and GCPIII by a NAAG peptidase inhibitor, such as ZJ43, reduces
  inactivation of NAAG. In animal models of these disorders, the NAAG peptidase inhibitor-mediated
  elevation of peptide levels increases the activation of mGlu3 receptors on axon
  endings, inhibiting further glutamate release and reducing the pathology. In a second
  neuroprotective pathway, NAAG activation of mGlu3 receptors on glial cells stimulates
  the release of a trophic factor, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β).In Part B,
  the neuron expresses NAAG synthetase II (NAAGSII), an enzyme that mediates the synthesis
  of NAAG and NAAG2. In this model, we propose that NAAG2 and perhaps NAAG are co-released
  with a primary amine transmitter, again as it the case for other neuropeptides,
  under conditions of elevated neuronal activity. The receptor that NAAG2 might activate
  has not been identified but is likely to be defined in the near future. Since GCPII
  hydrolyzes both NAAG and NAAG2, peptidase inhibitors such as ZJ43 can be predicted
  also to elevate levels of NAAG2 and increase its activity.
