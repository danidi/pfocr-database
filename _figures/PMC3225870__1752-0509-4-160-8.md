caption: Metabolic responses of the iNJ661v network to fatty-acid-limited growth.
  Metabolite flow was characterized for enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and
  the glyoxylate shunt pathway. The numbers in the graph indicate ratios of normalized
  flux-range midpoints. These were calculated based on flux variability analysis for
  slow and fast growth conditions, where the fluxes were normalized by dividing by
  the corresponding total growth rates. This normalization removes artifacts introduced
  by the lower absolute reaction fluxes associated with induced slow growth []. CS,
  citrate synthase; ACONT, aconitase; ICDHy, isocitrate dehydrogenase; OXGDC, 2-oxoglutarate
  decarboxylase; SSAL, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; FRD, fumarate reductase;
  SUCD, succinate dehydrogenase; FUM, fumarase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; MALS, malate
  synthase.
