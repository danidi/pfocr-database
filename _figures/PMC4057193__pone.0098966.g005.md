caption: Glycogen synthase kinase-3 is not exclusively involved in glycogen synthase
  (GS) regulation, but also acts as a downstream component of the Wnt signaling pathway
  and regulates elF2B, an induction factor for protein synthesis. Glycogen phosphorylase
  (GP) mobilizes glycogen into glucose subunits. Hexokinase is involved in glucose
  phosphorylation, acting as an important glycolysis enzyme, the major pathway of
  pyruvate production. Other possible glucose-6-P routes in carbohydrate metabolism
  were omitted for simplicity.
