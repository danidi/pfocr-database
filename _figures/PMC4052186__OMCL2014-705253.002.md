caption: Cross-talk between mitochondrial metabolism and the IIS pathway is required
  to trigger the mitohormetic response in C. elegans. The C. elegans IIS pathway contains
  components that are nearly identical to those of mammals []; under conditions of
  nutrient supply, the IIS pathway is initiated by the binding of DAF-28 or INS-7
  [, ] to DAF-2 [, ], subsequently triggering a cascade of phosphorylation events
  to activate specific kinases that inactivate the transcriptional factor DAF-16 and
  its target genes (e.g., sod-3) [, ]. A similar mechanism occurs for the transcriptional
  factor SKN-1 via the kinases AKT-1/2 and SGK-1. Conversely, the transcriptional
  activity of SKN-1 is augmented by some stressors, such as oxidative stress, as a
  consequence of OXPHOS activity via PMK-1 kinase, culminating in the nuclear translocation
  of SKN-1 and its interaction with the DNA-binding sites (AREs) of its target genes
  (gst-10,   gcs-1, and sod-1). Finally, an antioxidant response is activated to prevent
  ROS-mediated cellular damage, which may support the mitohormetic theory. DAF-28
