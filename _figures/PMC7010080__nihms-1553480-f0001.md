caption: 'Overview of the compartmentalized NAD+ metabolome in humans. NAD+ is synthesized
  via two major pathways: the de novo biosynthesis pathway from tryptophan (Trp),
  and the salvage pathway from various extracellular and intracellular precursors
  including nicotinic acid (NA), NA riboside (NAR), nicotinamide (NAM), and NAM riboside
  (NR). The precursors can cross cell membrane via different transporters, including
  solute carrier (SLC) transporters for Trp and NA, and equilibrative nucleoside transporters
  (ENTs) for NAR and NR. In the de novo synthesis pathway, Trp is degraded to quinolinic
  acid (QA), which can be converted to NA mononucleotide (NAMN) by quinolinic acid
  phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRT). In the salvage synthesis pathway, NA and NR can
  be converted to their corresponding mononucleotides NAMN and nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN) by nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT), respectively. NAMN and NMN can also be generated from phosphorylation of
  the nucleosides, NAR and NR, by NR kinases (NRKs). NMN may be generated from NAM
  by extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT), although the secretion and function eNAMPT has
  not been elucidated, and whether or not NMN can enter cells is a subject of some
  debate in the field. The formation of dinucleotide NAAD or NAD+ from NAMN or NMN
  is catalyzed by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs). Human
  NMNAT comprises three isoforms that are localized in the nucleus (NMNAT1), cytosol
  (NMNAT2), and mitochondria (NMNAT3), although the presence and function of NMNAT3
  is still under question. In cytosol, NAD+ can be reduced to NADH in glycolysis,
  and electrons from NADH can enter the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)
  via glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle or malate-aspartate shuttle. NADH is oxidized to
  NAD+ when pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In mitochondria,
  NAD+ is reduced to NADH by tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and can be regenerated
  from NADH by the ETC complex I. Whether NAD+ or its precursors can enter mitochondria
  is still unclear. Cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD+ can be converted to NADP+ by
  cytosol NAD+ kinase (cNADK) and mitochondrial NADK (mNADK), respectively. NAD+ is
  consumed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and sirtuins (SIRTs) at different
  subcellular compartments. Intracellular NAD+ is released from cells through connexin
  43 (Cx43) and possibly pannexin (Panx) hemi channels. Extracellular NAD+ can be
  degraded by membrane-bound glycohydrolases CD38/CD157 to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)
  and ADPR, or by CD73 to NMN and further to NR. Extracellular NAD+ can modulate inflammatory
  response by activation of P2X7 and P2Y11 purinergic receptors.'
