caption: 'Involvement of the 2C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the
  biosynthesis of photosynthetic co-factors. The MEP pathway produces isopentenyl
  and dimethylallyl diphosphate (IDP and DMADP, boxed) in the plastid, which supplies
  PQ (plastoquinone), Chl (chlorophyll a and b), and PhyQ (phylloquinone) biosynthesis.
  Mutants (blue italics) and herbicides (red, bold) used in this study are shown next
  to the affected steps. Enzymes are shown in bold on the left. The mevalonate pathway,
  which yields IDP and DMADP in the cytosol, is enclosed in the solid box. The MEP
  pathway is directly linked to the formation of photosynthetic machinery by providing
  IDP and DMADP which are condensed into geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) by the
  prenyl transferase GGDP synthase (GGDS). GGDP undergoes three subsequent reductions
  to form phytyl diphosphate through dihydrogeranylgeranyl diphosphate and tetrahydrogeranylgeranyl
  diphosphate. Phytyl diphosphate provides the phytyl tail for phylloquinone and chlorophyll.
  The MEP pathway further supports photosynthesis through 8 total step-wise condensations
  of IDP with DMADP to form SDP, which becomes the hydrocarbon tail for plastoquinone.
