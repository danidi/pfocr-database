caption: 'Proposed model for the flow of electrons during sulfate respiration in D.
  vulgaris Hildenborough. Abbreviations: QmoABC, Quinone-interacting membrane-bound
  oxidoreductase (DVU0848–0850); Ldhs, lactate dehydrogenases (nine annotated); Coo
  Hase, CO-induced membrane-bound hydrogenase (DVU2286–2293); Hase(s), periplasmic
  hydrogenases (four annotated); TpI-c3, Type-1 tetraheme cytochrome c3 (DVU3171);
  QrcABCD, Type-1 cytochrome c3:menaquinone oxidoreductase, formerly molybdopterin
  oxidoreductase (DVU0692–0695); DsrMKJOP, (DVU1290–1286); and MK, Menaquinone pool.
  Red, dashed lines and (?) indicate metabolic pathways for which less evidence is
  available. The reaction arrows were drawn as unidirectional for clarity of the model
  and electron flow. Pathway description is given in text.'
