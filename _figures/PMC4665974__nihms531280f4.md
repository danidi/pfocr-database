caption: Two scenarios are provided, one for long chain fatty acids (LCFA (SFA, MUFA,
  PUFA), left) and one for highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA, right). The LCFA
  saturated (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and the polyunsaturated fatty
  acids (PUFA) are transported across the plasma membrane (PM) by a FATP2-dependent
  process and are activated by a specific long chain acyl CoA synthetase (Acsl (?))
  to generate specific pools of acyl-CoA, which then enter the phospholipid biosynthetic
  pathway through PA. In this scenario, the exogenous fatty acids that are trafficked
  into PA end up in the different classes of phospholipid with little selectivity.
  In the scenario on the right, the HUFAs (e.g., C20:4 and C22:6) enter the cell and
  are activated by FATP2; it is unknown whether this occurs at the PM or the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). For FATP2 mediated activation to take place at the ER, these fatty
  acids must traverse the PM through a mechanism that has not been fully defined (?).
