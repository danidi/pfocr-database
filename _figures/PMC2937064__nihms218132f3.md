caption: The CD28 signaling pathway in T cells is equivalent to the IGF-1 pathway
  in the whole organism. Stimulation of the CD28/PI-3K/AKT pathway and thereby inhibition
  of the FOXO signaling axis is a unique mechanism developed to separate T cells from
  the major glucose metabolic system. This would confer a great evolutionary advantage
  on the organism, because the signal that triggers T-cell co-stimulation by CD28
  also triggers the energy utilization of T cells. However, life-long over-utilization
  of this pathway is associated with acceleration of T-cell senescence, including
  loss of CD28 expression and development of AICD-resistant T cells.
