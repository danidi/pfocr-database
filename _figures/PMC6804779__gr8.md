caption: Model of Anti-tumor Effects of Reovirus Combined with KU60019In general,
  the phosphorylation of ATM protein is induced when DNA double-strand breaks are
  caused by UV or radiation. We newly found that reovirus infection activated the
  ATM protein unaccompanied with DNA double-strand breaks, at the late time points
  of reovirus infection (after 12 h) (A) (). This indicates that reovirus may cause
  an atypical ATM signaling pathway, which is abrogated by KU60019 (B). The combination
  treatment of reovirus and KU60019 leads to enhancement the virus replication (C),
  followed by cell cycle arrest at G2/M and caspase-dependent apoptosis, potentiating
  anti-tumor effects. However, the mechanism between upregulation of lysosomal activities
  and reovirus cytotoxicity is still unknown.
