caption: P2Y receptor (P2YR) signaling in neurons counteracts oxidative stress and
  Alzheimer’s pathology. Astrocytes release interleukin-6 after P2Y1 receptor activation.
  Interleukin-6 protects neurons from oxidative stress by an unknown pathway involving
  the Il-6 receptor ➀. Activation of P2Y2 receptors induces protective neurite outgrowth
  ➁. P2Y2 receptors inhibit apoptosis via ERK ➂. P2Y2 receptors induce ADAM10/17 activity
  to cleave APP to the soluble non amyloidogenic sAPP ➃. The P2Y13 receptor protects
  against oxidative stress by upregulation of HO-1 via Nrf-2 ➄. Activation of the
  P2Y13 receptor leads to activation of ERK and blocks apoptosis ➅
