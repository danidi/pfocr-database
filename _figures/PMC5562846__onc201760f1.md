caption: A simplified scheme of chromatin changes in response to double-strand break
  (DSB) occurrence highlighting a central role of the ATM kinase. DSBs are recognized
  by the MRN complex (MRE11; RAD50; NBS1), which leads to activation of the ATM kinase.
  In parallel DNA damage-induced chromatin changes lead to c-Abl tyrosine kinase activation.
  C-Abl phosphorylates TIP60 (also known as KAT5) acetyltrasferase, which acetylates
  ATM to elicit full activation of this kinase. Interaction between ATM and TIP60
  is facilitated by FOXO3A transcription factor. Binding of TIP60 to methylated histones
  (predominantly H3K9me3) is required for its action on ATM and other histone substrates
  (e.g., H4). TIP60 acetylates histones leading to the formation of open relaxed chromatin
  structure. This step is facilitated by p400 histone chaperone-mediated variant histone
  exchange at DSBs (H2A.X is replaced by HA2.Z) occurring in close proximity to DSBs
  (up to ca 3,5 kb away from a DSB). The main substrate of ATM kinase is histone H2A.X
  and phospho-H2A.X (termed γH2A.X) spreads away from the DSBs into megabase sized
  domains. Phospho-H2A.X is recognized by MDC1 adapter protein, which is also the
  substrate of ATM.,  Phospho-MDC1 in turn recruits RNF8 ubiquitin ligase. Linker
  histone H1 is the main substrate of RNF8 and ubiquitinated H1 is recognized by RNF168
  ubiquitin ligase. RNF168 ubiquitinates histone H2A on K13/15, which facilitates
  recruitment of the key adapter protein 53BP1. Stable binding of 53BP1 also requires
  its association with methylated histone H4 (K20me2).,  Of note histone methylation
  is a constitutive chromatin mark, whereas both histone acetylation and ubiquitination
  are dynamic DNA damage-induced modifications. 53BP1 serves as critical regulation
  of DSB repair pathway choice and promotes NHEJ repair by inhibiting DNA resection
  (a critical step in homologous recombination (HR) repair). ATM is also implicated
  in the repair of heterochromatin DSBs by phosphorylating KAP1 protein, which in
  turn promotes opening of heterochromatin to allow for the access of the DNA repair
  machinery.
