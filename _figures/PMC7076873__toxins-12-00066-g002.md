caption: Postulated therapeutic effects of bee venom and melittin against neuroinflammation
  in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. The tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) pathway
  (illustrated in a simplified way) is an important mechanism by which inflammatory
  processes are activated and is overstimulated in various neurodegenerative disorders
  (red arrows), including Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (ALS). The protective effects of bee venom and melittin (shown
  with black arrows for activation and black bar-headed arrows for repression) are
  controversial (illustrated as question marks in the figure). Further research is
  required to characterize these effects and to evaluate, whether they are caused
  by a reduction in neuroinflammation or by other mechanisms. TNFR1/2 = Tumour necrosis
  factor receptor 1/2; IL-1α = Interleukin 1α; NF-κB = Nuclear factor kappa-light
  chain enhancer of activated B cells.
