caption: PTEN knockout in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFPTEN−/−) results in an accumulation
  of PIP3 produced by PI3K at the plasma membrane. The recruitment of Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDK1) by PIP3 is mediated via their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains.
  The phosphorylation at Ser473 by mTORC2 and that at Thr308 by PDK1 leads to a fully
  activated Akt  which then phosphorylates mTORC1. 4E-BP1, the downstream target of
  mTORC1, on phosphorylation becomes inactive as a repressor of protein translation
  as it is not able to bind to eIF4E . This leads to the initiation of protein translation
  of RC components as shown in this study, contributing to enhanced OXPHOS in MEFPTEN−/−.
  Likewise, knockdown of PTEN in MEFWT or of 4E-BP1 in MEFWT and MEFPTEN−/− by RNA
  silencing also increased RC expressions. Conversely, attenuation of the hyper-activated
  Akt in MEFPTEN−/− by LY294002 or Akt inhibitor IV leads to lower RC activities and
  expressions. Together, the data presented supports our hypothesis of a link between
  Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 and mitochondrial respiratory function.
