caption: 'The crucial steps of ether lipid biosynthesis take place in peroxisomes,
  which are in close interaction with other organelles via various recently identified
  contact sites (reviewed in ()). Accordingly, multiple factors may influence the
  synthesis and levels of ether lipids in such a complex environment: The production
  of fatty alcohols from fatty acyl-CoA for generation of the ether bond has been
  proposed as rate-limiting step for ether lipid biosynthesis (). Accordingly, substrate
  availability and activity of FAR1 are essential regulators of the whole pathway
  (1). Owing to the localization of the enzymes carrying out the initial steps, ether
  lipid biosynthesis critically depends on peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation
  (2), processes which themselves are subject to regulation by multiple factors. Polymorphisms
  and mutations in biosynthetic enzymes can have a dramatic impact on ether lipid
  levels (3). Based on current knowledge, contact sites may be crucial for the exchange
  of ether lipid precursors between organelles (4). For example, tethering to the
  ER was shown to be required for maintenance of plasmalogen levels () and is influenced
  by cellular oxidative stress and other factors. After exiting the peroxisome by
  an unknown mechanism (indicated by a question mark), further enzymatic modification
  of the ether lipid precursor is accomplished at the ER or in the cytosol, thus producing
  the wide range of different ether lipid species. These are continuously exposed
  to remodeling (e.g. by phospholipases) or catabolic steps (5). Apart from endogenous
  biosynthesis, ether lipids can, to a lesser extent, also be derived from dietary
  sources (6).AADHAPR, acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase; ADHAPS, alkyl-DHAP synthase; DHAP,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate; DHAPAT, DHAP acyltransferase; FAR, fatty acyl-CoA reductase.'
