caption: A proposed mechanism of the p75NTR as a mediator of synaptic changes during
  SD. This diagram depicts the signaling pathway by p75NTR in mediating LTP and associative
  memory impairment after sleep loss. SD increases PDE4A5 level and this protein can
  interact directly with p75NTR, which leads to a reduced level of cAMP. Moreover,
  SD also decreases ERK1/2 activity. Both cAMP and ERK pathways are important in regulating
  gene expression at the transcriptional level via CREB, which promotes upregulation
  of expression of proteins, for example BDNF that will consolidate labile memories
  into long-term memories. Both CREB and BDNF levels are decreased in SD. The BDNF
  and TrkB receptor have been shown to be involved in STC process, which is critical
  for memory consolidation, are impaired during SD. In addition, SD modulates the
  cAMP-PKA-LIMK1 pathway. Modulation of this pathway increases the activity of cofilin,
  which leads to loss of spine density. SD also increases RhoA level leading to an
  increase in ROCK2 activity, which has been implicated in regulating spine density.
  As a whole, p75NTR mediates PDE4A5-cAMP–CREB-BDNF, cAMP-PKA-LIMK1-cofilin, and RhoA-ROCK2
  pathways, which eventually lead to changes in both functional and structural plasticity.
  As a consequence, LTP and associative memory are impaired after sleep loss. Red
  arrow indicates increases. Green arrow indicates decreases.
