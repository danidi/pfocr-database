caption: The scheme shows SP effects on sensitive cancer cells and supposed mechanisms
  of action as derived from the integration between experimental data and literature
  background. The alteration of ROCK/HDAC6 pathways leads to tubulin abnormalities
  and this could be responsible of mitotic catastrophe in the major part of treated
  cells (∼80 %). Longer incubation with SP leads to induction of premature senescence
  through p53/p21 pathway activation in a significant amount of surviving cells (∼15
  %).
