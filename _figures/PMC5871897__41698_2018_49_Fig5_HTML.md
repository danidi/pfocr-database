caption: Pathological significance of the synergistic cooperation in the colorectal
  tumorigenesis by both APC and KRAS mutations and supporting mechanism. a Loss-of-function
  mutations of APC, observed in 90% of CRC patients, disrupt the destruction complex,
  lead to accumulation of β-catenin and RAS and thereby initiate adenoma formation.
  b When both APC and KRAS mutations occur, mutant KRAS proteins are accumulated by
  stabilization due to absence of its phosphorylation by inactivated GSK3β by APC
  loss. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling is strongly enhanced by its initial stabilization
  and further activation via the stabilized oncogenic mutant KRAS by APC loss. The
  additional activation of β-catenin signaling by the oncogenic KRAS occurs via a
  positive feedback loop through the MEK-ERK pathway, although in the detailed mechanism
  is not illustrated. The strong activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling involves
  malignant transformation accompanying the activation of CSCs
