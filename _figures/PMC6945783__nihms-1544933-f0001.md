caption: The scheme of the functional patterns within the glycolytic pathway in beta
  cells in health and type 1 diabetes. (a) In health (without diabetes), glucokinase
  (GCK) limits and regulates glucose flux through glycolysis due to a Km of ~10 mmol/l.
  (b) Available RNA-Seq data from humans with type 1 diabetes indicates that, apart
  from GCK, HK1/2, with a Km of ~0.1 mmol/l, are upregulated, facilitating flux through
  glycolysis. Moreover, the rate-limiting subsequent step in glycolysis (conversion
  of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate) is enhanced in type 1 diabetes
  by upregulation of PFKFB3, increasing pyruvate production. In type 1 diabetes, the
  extra pyruvate generated is directed to lactate rather than to the TCA cycle by
  upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDHA). In health (a), pyruvate is metabolised to citrate (solid line) since pyruvate
  conversion to lactate is a disallowed pathway in adult beta cells (dotted line).
  In contrast, in type 1 diabetes (b), pyruvate is converted to lactate (solid line)
  rather than to citrate (dotted line). BP, bisphosphate; P, phosphate; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway.
