caption: mTOR is required for cardiomyocyte growth and for the preservation of cardiac
  structure and function in unstressed conditions. However, partial inhibition of
  mTOR appears to be beneficial during the aging process. The pharmacological modulators
  of mTOR and the animal models with genetic modifications of the components of the
  mTOR signaling pathway that have been used in the studies focused on the role of
  mTOR in cardiac physiology are displayed.
