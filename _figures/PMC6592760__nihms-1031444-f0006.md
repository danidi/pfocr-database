caption: Owing to high glycolytic rate and associated biosynthetic reactions, proliferating
  cells face the problem of an elevated NADH to NAD+ ratio and thus, maintaining redox
  homeostasis is critical during cell proliferation. Mechanisms to maintain NADH to
  NAD+ ratio include the malate–aspartate shuttle, which regenerates cytosolic NAD+
  to sustain constant flow through biosynthetic pathways. Also, an increase in lactate
  production supports regeneration of NAD+. At the same time, proliferating cells
  face the problem of increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily
  derived from electron transport chain in mitochondria and NADPH oxidases (NOXs).
  Excessive ROS cause oxidative stress, which curbs cell proliferation and viability.
  Thus, proliferating cells require efficient antioxidant systems to counteract the
  destructive activity of ROS. The two key cellular antioxidant defense systems include
  the thioredoxin system (not shown) and the glutathione system. Glutathione is synthesized
  from glutamate, cysteine and glutamine. Glutamine importantly regulates this process
  by supplying glutamate and promoting cystine uptake. Additionally, NADPH is required
  for efficient ROS detoxification as it is involved in generating reduced glutathione
  — which is active against ROS — from its oxidized form (not shown). NADPH is supplied
  by the conversion of glycolysis intermediates in the pentose phosphate pathway as
  well as by mitochondrial serine metabolism in the folate pathway. Antioxidant defense
  has been shown to be important for cancer cell survival and tumour growth. For example,
  cancer cells were demonstrated to rely on glutathione synthesis and to upregulate
  mitochondrial folate pathway (highlighted in red).MCT, monocarboxylate transporter;
  THF, tetrahydrofolate; x(c)(−), cystine–glutamine antiporter.
