caption: Targeting the lncRNA-dependent noncanonical Hedgehog pathway by LNA in combination
  with classical Hedgehog pathway inhibitors. (A) Canonical activation of the GLI2
  pathway occurs through Hedgehog (HH) ligands, such as binding of SHH to the PTCH
  receptor, followed by SMO activation, which induces GLI2 phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation for binding to the downstream target genes. SMO inhibitors have been
  developed that target the canonical Hedgehog signaling pathway to treat some types
  of cancers; however, acquired resistance has occurred. In our studies we demonstrated
  that binding of the lncRNA BCAR4 to SNIP1 and PNUTS in the presence of CCL21 treatment
  releases the inhibitory activity of SNIP on p300-dependent histone acetylation.
  The resulting H3K18ac binds to PNUTS, which relieves inhibition of RNA Pol II via
  activation of the PP1 phosphatase. This mechanism activates a noncanonical hedgehog/GLI2
  signaling pathway and may contribute to drug resistance in some types of cancers.
  (B) Depletion of BCAR4 by LNA significantly impairs breast cancer metastasis in
  vivo. We propose that a rational combination of SMO inhibitors and LNA targeting
  BCAR4 would be more efficacious for the treatment of some types of human cancer.
