caption: Innate recognition of fungal cells by PRRs like Dectin-1 and TLR2 leads to
  the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF. The pathogen recognition
  together with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines induces the secretion of
  chitinases (e.g. chitotriosidase) from neutrophils and macrophages. Chitin digestion
  leads to the generation of small sized chitin particles that are taken up by the
  mannose receptor and induce IL-10 secretion via the TLR9 and NOD2 pathway. The anti-inflammatory
  cytokine IL-10 dampens the inflammatory response by down-regulating pro-inflammatory
  cytokine secretion.
