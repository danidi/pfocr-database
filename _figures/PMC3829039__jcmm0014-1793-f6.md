caption: Proposed model for t-PA regulation by retinoids in human amnion. (A) First-step
  regulation of t-PA by a RAR-α-dependent pathway. Before and up to 12 hrs, retinoids
  simultaneously stimulate t-PA and RAR-β expression through RAR-α signalling. (B)
  Second-step regulation of t-PA by a RAR-β-delayed pathway. After 12 hrs, RAR-β is
  able to induce a higher t-PA expression than in the first step.
