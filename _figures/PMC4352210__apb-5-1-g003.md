caption: In another study, it has been observed that methimazole will oxidized to
  N-methylhydantoin and also N-methylthiourea (). Again, the methyl thiourea is formed
  through this metabolic pathway, and might be responsible for methimazole toxicity
  in liver (). Nevertheless, the other metabolite, N-methylhydantoin has not been
  evaluated for its toxicity toward hepatocytes yet ().
