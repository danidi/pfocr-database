caption: Model for relationship between PRs and MCs. MCs are PK-deficient, so glycolytic
  intermediates can be used for anabolic activities. MCs are AGC1-deficient, so mitochondrial
  oxaloacetate in MCs is not diverted away from the pathway that leads to Gln synthesis.
  To compensate for these metabolic deficiencies, PRs produce Lac that MCs can oxidize
  to Pyr to fuel their mitochondria. PRs also export Asp that MCs can use to oxidize
  Lac. Nitrogen for the amino group of Gln comes from Asp, and nitrogen for the amide
  group of Gln comes from NH4+. Mal, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate; OGC, oxoglutarate
  carrier; Succ, succinate. Double-membrane compartments within the cells represent
  mitochondria. Green circles represent Glu, and green cylinders represent Glu receptors.
