caption: Negative regulation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)–like 2 (NRF2)
  under normal conditions and activation under pathological conditions. Under normal
  conditions, NRF2 is bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), maintaining
  it in the cytosol. KEAP1 acts as adaptor of the Cullin 3 (CuI3) ubiquitin ligase
  that ubiquitinates NRF2, leading to its degradation by proteasome 26S. Under pathological
  conditions, in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or covalent modifiers,
  the KEAP1 structure is modified, liberating NRF2 in the cytosol; thereafter, it
  translocates to the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with small masculoaponeurotic
  fibrosarcoma (sMaf) proteins to bind the antioxidant response element (ARE) sequences,
  promoting the expression of phase II genes. This mechanism is known as the “hinge
  and latch” NRF2 activation mechanism. Moreover, NRF2 is tightly regulated by additional
  mechanisms. It can be over-activated by the action of p62, since it can induce KEAP1
  degradation by the autophagy lysosome pathway. In the opposite, under pathological
  conditions, in which the kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is over-active,
  it can directly phosphorylate NRF2, facilitating its interaction with the Cul1 ligase
  adaptor β-transducing repeat-containing protein (β-TrCp) to induce its degradation.
