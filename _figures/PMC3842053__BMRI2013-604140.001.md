caption: Altered arginine metabolism in sickle cell disease (SCD). Dietary glutamine
  and glutamate serve as a precursor for the de novo production of arginine through
  the citrulline-arginine pathway. Arginine is synthesized endogenously from citrulline
  primarily via the intestinal-renal axis []. Arginase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
  compete for arginine, their common substrate. Asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA)
  is an arginine analog and NOS inhibitor that is elevated in SCD [–]. In SCD, bioavailability
  of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) is decreased by several mechanisms linked to hemolysis
  [, , , ]. The release of erythrocyte arginase during hemolysis increases plasma
  arginase levels and shifts arginine metabolism towards ornithine production, limiting
  the amount of substrate available for NO production []. The bioavailability of arginine
  is further diminished by increased ornithine levels because ornithine and arginine
  compete for the same transporter system for cellular uptake (cationic amino acid
  transporter—CAT) [, ]. Despite an increase in NOS, NO bioavailability is low due
  to low substrate availability [], NO scavenging by cell-free hemoglobin released
  during hemolysis [], and through reactions with free radicals such as superoxide
  and other reactive NO species [–]. Superoxide is elevated in SCD due to low superoxide
  dismutase activity [, ], high xanthine oxidase activity [], and potentially as a
  result of uncoupled NOS [, ] in an environment of low arginine and/or tetrahydrobiopterin
  concentration or insufficient NADPH. Superoxide will react with NO to form reactive
  nitric oxide species (RNOS) including peroxynitrite [], which can contribute further
  to cell damage and cell death. Endothelial dysfunction resulting from NO depletion
  and increased levels of the downstream products of ornithine metabolism (polyamines
  and proline) likely contributes to the pathogenesis of lung injury, pulmonary hypertension,
  and asthma in SCD. This model has implications for all hemolytic processes. This
  new disease paradigm is now recognized as an important mechanism in the pathophysiology
  of SCD. Reproduced/modified with permission from the American Society of Hematology
