caption: Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS signaling in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The intrinsic
  pathway is activated by internal stimuli such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, or
  hypoxia. Bcl-xL inhibits the activation of Bax and Bak, preventing a loss of mitochondrial
  outer membrane (MOM) integrity and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Therefore,
  the Bcl-xL isoform is anti-apoptotic. On the other hand, Bcl-xS can inhibit Bcl-xL;
  thus, the activation of Bax and Bak results in a loss of MOM integrity. Cytochrome
  c is then released into the cytoplasm, which forms a complex with Apaf-1 and caspase-9
  to form the apoptosome. The apoptosome goes on to activate caspase-3, resulting
  in cell apoptosis. Therefore, the Bcl-xS isoform is pro-apoptotic.
