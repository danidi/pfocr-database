caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed Orai-Ca2+-IGFBP3 signaling complex
  transduction pathway. Increased level of glucose might promote the overexpression
  and interactions of IGFBP3 and Orais in HCAECs and thus induce increased intracellular
  Ca2+ mediated by SOCE. Subsequently, increased intracellular Ca2+ may cause increased
  proliferation, permeability, and migration of endothelial cells. ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; HCAECs, human coronary artery endothelial cells; HG, high glucose; IGFB3,
  insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; STIM1,
  stromal interaction molecule.
