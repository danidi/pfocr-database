caption: Approaches to turn a “cold tumor” into a “hot tumor”. Some representative
  approaches that lead to increased T-cell infiltration and improved efficacy of immune
  checkpoint inhibitors are highlighted here. (A) Oncolytic viruses, local thermal
  ablation therapy (e.g., radiofrequency ablation), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy
  are all capable of inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) to promote T-cell priming
  and activation. Local administration of immune adjuvants such as TLR agonists promotes
  the activation of dendritic cells (DCs). Epigenetic modification inhibitors can
  promote T-cell priming by increasing the expression of tumor antigens and by restoring
  antigen processing and presentation mechanisms. (B) Cancer vaccines and adoptive
  cellular therapies, such as CAR-T cells, can promote the expansion of tumor-specific
  T lymphocytes. (C) Intrinsic oncogenic pathway inhibitors, epigenetic modification
  inhibitors, antiangiogenic therapies, TGFβ inhibitors, and CXCR4 inhibitors promote
  T-cell trafficking and enable T cells to infiltrate the tumor more effectively.
