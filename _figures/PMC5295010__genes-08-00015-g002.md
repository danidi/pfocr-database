caption: The ComRS quorum sensing (QS) pathway controls competence, and the BlpRH
  QS system regulates bacteriocin production in S. mutans strain UA159. The ComS pre-peptide
  is exported and processed via an unknown mechanism (denoted as a dotted line and
  gray box) into XIP. In a chemically defined, peptide-poor medium (CDM) XIP is re-imported
  via oligopeptide permease (Opp) and binds ComR. The ComR/XIP complex binds upstream
  of comS and sigX at PComR-box sites []. The alternative sigma factor, SigX, facilitates
  RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding at Pcin-box sites []. Genes regulated by SigX include
  the DNA-uptake and transformasome machinery as well as the murein hydrolase, LytFsm,
  among others [,]. Non-specific peptides present in high concentrations in peptide-rich
  media are thought to prevent intracellular transport of XIP via Opp []. Recently,
  a link between the bacteriocin and competence pathways was determined to be mediated
  by SigX at a Pcin-box site upstream of blpRH (formerly referred to as comDE, see
  ). The BlpRH QS pathway pheromone, MIP, is exported and processed by the ABC transporter
  complex NlmTE into the 21 amino-acid long precursor peptide, MIP-21 []. Cleavage
  of MIP-21 by the protease SepM results in fully active MIP-18 []. MIP-18 is thought
  to bind to BlpH, resulting in activation and phosphorylation of BlpR similarly to
  CSP binding and activation of ComDE in S. pneumoniae []. BlpR~P binds at PBlpR-box
  sites upstream of bacteriocin loci such as cipB and nlmAB, among others []. Although
  the mechanism is unknown (represented by the dotted circle surrounding CipB), the
  activity of CipB is required for the indirect induction of SigX observed when cells
  are grown in peptide-rich media and treated with MIP [,,]. Multiple other regulatory
  pathways are observed to feed into the ComRS/BlpRH QS networks, such as the CiaHR,
  HdrRM, and the RcrRPQ systems [,,,,,]. These additional inputs along with possible
  contribution through the BlpRH-regulated QS pathway (i.e., via cipB expression [])
  may help S. mutans to integrate environmental cues into the competence signaling
  cascade, allowing for fine tune control of natural transformation (depicted by the
  blue block arrow).
