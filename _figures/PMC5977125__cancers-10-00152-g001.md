caption: 'Overview of the cap-dependent translation initiation. Cap-dependent translation
  initiation can be divided in four main steps: (1) 43S-PIC formation, (2) 48S-PIC
  assembly, (3) start codon recognition and (4) formation of the 80S mature ribosome.
  The Met-tRNAi-bound to eIF2 and several eIFs (1, 1A, 3 and 5) are recruited to the
  40S small sub-unit ribosome to form the 43S-PIC (1). The 43S-PIC is recruited to
  the cap of the mRNA through the interaction with the eIF4F complex in order to form
  the 48S-PIC (2). The eIF4F complex is composed of three proteins: the cap-binding
  protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eiF4A and the scaffolding protein eiF4G that allows
  43S-PIC binding to the mRNA cap through eIF3. Formation of eIF4F complex is mainly
  regulated by mTOR signaling pathway, mTOR phosphorylating the translation repressor
  4E-BP1 that inhibits eIF4F complex formation through the binding of eIF4E. Moreover,
  a «closed loop» structure of the mRNA is formed through the interaction of the PABP
  to the mRNA poly (A) tail to increase translation initiation efficiency by favoring
  the binding of eIF4E to the cap. Then, the 48S-PIC scans through the mRNA 5′UTR
  until the start codon (3). The start codon is recognized by the Met-tRNAi that induce
  the hydrolysis of eIF2-GTP bound and release of eiF2-GDP and the other eIFs (1,
  3, 5 and eIF4F). The large subunit 60S of the ribosome will then join the 40S ribosome
  to form the 80S ribosome and start translation (4). (AAAAA)n: poly (A) tail; CDS:
  mRNA coding sequence; eIF: eukaryotic initiation factor; Met-tRNAi: initiator-methionyl
