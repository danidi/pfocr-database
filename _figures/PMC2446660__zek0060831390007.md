caption: A model for the role of Plc1p in PKA regulation and expression of Msn2p-dependent
  genes. Plc1p likely acts together with Gpr1p and Gpa2p in a pathway separate from
  the Ras1p/Ras2p pathway, and the two pathways converge on cAMP synthesis and PKA
  activity. plc1Δ mutation results in decreased cAMP synthesis and PKA activity and
  increased recruitment of Msn2p to promoters of stress-responsive genes. In addition,
  it appears that Plc1p affects expression of stress-responsive genes by an Msn2p/Msn4p-independent
  mechanism (for details, see Discussion).
