caption: Lineage-committed mononuclear phagocytes are generated primarily in the BM
  through the tightly regulated differentiation of HSCs to progressively more committed
  cell populations. Key steps in this pathway include the formation of the CMP, GMP,
  MDP, and cMoP populations. The recently identified cMoP represents the least differentiated,
  committed monocyte population. CSF-1 has been shown to be a critical regulatory
  factor in the generation of monocyte populations, both in instructing myeloid cell
  fate through activation of the transcription factor PU.1 and in promoting the differentiation
  of GMP to mononuclear phagocytes. The transcription factor MafB functions to repress
  the activity of CSF-1 in the HSC. Sca-1, stem cell antigen-1.
