caption: Diagram showing the different molecular mechanisms of canonical nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3
  (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. The first step is regulated by toll-like receptors
  (TLRs)–adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) pathway
  and/or tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), which activate pro-IL-1β and NLRP3
  transcription via nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activation. TLR4 stimulation by pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) and/or damage-associated molecular pattern molecules
  (DAMPs) can activate also the receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)–FAS-associated
  death domain protein (FADD)-caspase-8 protein complex, which, in turn, promotes
  NF-kB transcription. The second step results in NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization,
  leading to caspase-1 activation as well as IL-1β and IL-18 release. Permeabilization
  of cell membranes to potassium efflux (i.e., mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein
  (MLKL) activation, exposure to pore-forming Gasdermin D, P2X7 receptor activation
  by extracellular ATP, lysosomal damage, and cathepsin release) leads to a massive
  release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA, increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and cardiolipin externalization, which, in turn, promote NLRP3 inflammasome
  oligomerization and activation. α-Syn and Aβ protein accumulation, and post-translational
  NLRP3 modifications (i.e., phosphorylation and ubiquitination) can also promote
  the second step of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
