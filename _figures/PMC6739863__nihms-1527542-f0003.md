caption: After injury both pediatric and adult brain have impaired mitochondrial oxidative
  metabolism of glucose as depicted by impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Both
  exhibit increased glycolysis and lactate production as indicated by the large red
  arrows. In injured adult brain, an increase in pentose phosphate pathway flux has
  been observed but this has not been studied in pediatric TBI. Ketone supplementation
  has been demonstrated to have beneficial metabolic and neurological outcomes in
  pre-clinical models of pediatric TBI but was not beneficial in adult TBI. BCAA supplementation
  in adult TBI improved outcomes but has not been studied in pediatric patients or
  pre-clinical models. The role of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation during and after
  injury is not well understood nor is the role of gluconeogenesis nor mitochondrial
  pyruvate transport. The cell represented here reflects general metabolic perturbations
  that have been observed largely from studies of whole brain. The cell -type specificity
  of these metabolic responses to injury remains to be determined. Overall, multiple
  nutrients contribute to meeting brain energetic and biosynthetic demands, and those
  that are known to be altered in TBI are summarized here.
