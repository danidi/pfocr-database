caption: Brief schematic representation of the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway. Glucose
  is converted into uridine diphosphate–N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) through a
  number of enzymatic steps (not shown), which is converted to N-acetyl-D-mannosamine
  (ManNAc) via a rate-limiting reaction calalyzed by GNE. ManNAc undergoes conversion
  to cytidine monophosphate–sialic acid (CMP-sialic acid), which provides feedback
  inhibition to the rate-limiting GNE-calalyzed reaction. Exogenous ManNAc supplements
  enters the pathway after this rate limiting step. A substantial part of the sialic
  acid is incorporated into N- and O-linked glycan residues in structural and secreted
  glycoproteins. Modified from Luchansky et al with permission of The American Society
  for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
