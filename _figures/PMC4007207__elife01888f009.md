caption: 'EPI−/− mice lack three cornified envelope proteins, resulting in a defective
  epidermal barrier. Topical application of DMBA induces H-Ras mutations, as in wild-type
  mice. Topical TPA treatment elicits an exaggerated atopic response, characterized
  by altered keratinocyte differentiation and an enhanced inflammatory response. Epidermal
  production of TSLP and activation of the ligand-NKG2D pathway on immune cells are
  proposed to contribute to tumour protection.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01888.011'
