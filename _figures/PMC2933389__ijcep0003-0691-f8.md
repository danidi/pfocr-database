caption: 'The proposed sequence of events that take place from “genes” to “histopathology”
  is the following: the genetic defect in diffuse PHHI is inactivating mutations in
  SUR-1 and Kir 6.2 genes; the consequence is inactivation of ATP-sensitive potassium
  channels, with a secondary effect of increased intracellular influx of calcium.
  The increased level of intracytoplasmic calcium and the amino acids, especially
  leucine, activates m-TORC1 (Raptor + pmTOR) [, ]. (plasmalemmal aspect of acinar
  and ductal cells, causing them to enter cell cycle, where they arrest in G0/G1 phase.'
