caption: (A) Rapid association of Ku to DSBs promotes NHEJ by recruiting DNA-PKcs.
  Sequential phosphorylation events on multiple DNA-PKcs amino acid clusters favors
  the initial processing of DNA ends by ARTEMIS, followed by DNA-PKcs-dependent protection
  of DNA ends required for DNA ligation. (B) Alternatively to NHEJ, MRN, which is
  initially recruited to DSBs by PARP in competition with Ku, mediates the initial
  stages of DSB resection together with CtIP and BRCA1 to promote homologous recombination
  in S and G2. 53BP1 has an inhibitory role on DSB resection and is negatively regulated
  by BRCA1 by unknown mechanisms. The MRN/CtIP/BRCA1 complex can also promote DSB
  resection following deprotection of DNA ends when NHEJ fails. Extensive DSB resection
  and formation of RPA-coated 3′-ssDNA ends is induced by EXO1 and BLM. ATM plays
  a central role in the regulation of DSB resection as described in the main text.
  Displacement of RPA from the 3′-ssDNA ends and assembly of RAD51 filaments mediated
  by BRCA2 leads to strand invasion into homologous DNA sequences. Recruitment of
  RAD51 to ssDNA ends is regulated by the ATR pathway, which is activated following
  DSB resection. D-loop structures formed after strand invasion can be cleaved by
  MUS81/EME1 or displaced by RTEL1 during SDSA to generate crossover or non-crossover
  events, respectively. Non-crossovers are generated also by dissolution of Holliday
  junctions (HJs) by the BLM/TOPOIII complex, whereas HJ resolution by the nucleases
  GEN1 and SLX1/SLX4, which associates with MUS81/EME1, can generate both crossover
  and non-crossover events. (C) Limited DSB resection carried out by CtIP and MRN
  in G1 results in alternative NHEJ. (D) Following DSB resection, 3′-ssDNA ends with
  homologous sequences can be directly annealed by RAD52. Post-translational modifications
  are indicated as in .
