caption: 'Potential targets and inhibitors for phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine
  synthesis. (A) Potential inhibition points for the de novo pathway. The phosphatidylserine
  (PS) synthase from fungi (Cho1) and some bacteria (PssA) that convert cytidine diphosphate
  diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) and serine (Ser) to PS would be good candidates for inhibitor
  development. In addition, the PS decarboxylase enzyme (PSD) that converts PS to
  phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which could potentially impact parasite, fungal and
  select bacterial pathogens is a good point for intervention, and the compound MMV007285
  has been reported to inhibit PSD activity in Plasmodium falciparum. (B) The ethanolamine
  kinase activity of the Plasmodium falciparum choline kinase (PfCK) in the Kennedy
  pathway can be inhibited by the compounds BR23 and BR25 and appears to be a good
  point for intervention. Red lines describe points where inhibitors have been discovered
  (MMV007285 and BR23 and BR25) or are lacking, but would be good points for intervention
  (??). Other abbreviations: Etn—ethanolamine; Etn-P—phosphoethanolamine, CDP-Etn—cytidyldiphosphate-ethanolamine.'
