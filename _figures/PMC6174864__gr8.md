caption: A working model illustrating HHcy-induced ER oxidative stress and inflammation
  in endothelial cells. At steady state, the Ero1α/GPx7/PDI triad safeguards ER redox
  homeostasis during oxidative protein folding. In this scenario, O2 is consumed by
  Ero1α to produce H2O2, which is further utilized by GPx7, with H2O being released.
  An elevated Hcy level increases the GSH/GSSG ratio in the ER of endothelial cells,
  which, in turn, generates additional reduced PDI (PDIred) from oxidized PDI (PDIoxi).
  Reduced PDI quickly activates Ero1α, leading to the accumulation of H2O2, which
  results in ER over-oxidation. On one hand, ER oxidative stress can cause inflammatory
  activation by upregulating the expression of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 adhesion molecules and
  HIF-1α. HIF-1α positively regulates the expression of Ero1α and may further amplify
  H2O2 accumulation and oxidative stress. On the other hand, over-oxidation of ER
  can also activate UPR signaling and elicit a cellular antioxidant response through
  NRF2. In particular, NRF2 induces GPx7 expression to scavenge Ero1α-produced H2O2
  and to re-establish ER redox homeostasis. However, in chronic HHcy pathology, the
  NRF2-GPx7 antioxidant pathway is restrained in endothelial cells, which exaggerates
  ER oxidative stress and further contributes to endothelial inflammation and vasculopathy.
