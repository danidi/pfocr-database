caption: A. A model of prostate cancer-stroma interaction mediated by FGFR and ligands.
  FGFR1 is expressed by prostate cancer cells, osteoblasts and endothelial cells.
  FGF2 is produced by prostate cancer cells and induces osteogenesis, bone remodeling,
  and angiogenesis. Angiogenesis in turn favors prostate cancer progression. Prostate
  mesenchymal cell production of FGF2/FGF10 activate FGFR1 in prostate cancer cells
  leading cancer progression. FGF8/FGF9 is produced by prostate cancer cells during
  growth in bone (bone metastases) and induces osteogenesis and bone remodeling. Activated
  osteoblasts induce angiogenesis. B. Inhibition of the FGF pathway can affect tumor
  progression by targeting multiple biological pathways.
