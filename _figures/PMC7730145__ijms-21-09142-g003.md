caption: A novel strategy to facilitate neuronal Cl− extrusion and EGABA by coincident
  NKCC1 inhibition and KCC2 activation by inhibiting the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 kinases. Mammalian
  neurons that are challenged with multiple neuropsychiatric conditions (such as seizures,
  neuropathic pain, spasticity, schizophrenia, and others) are usually driven by hyperexcitable
  circuits, intraneuronal Cl− ([Cl−]i) levels are elevated due to increased NKCC1
  activity, and/or decreased KCC2 activity, promoting GABAAR-mediated membrane depolarization
  and excitation. In healthy mature neurons, [Cl−]i is low due to the opposite activity
  profile of the CCCs, promoting GABAAR-mediated hyperpolarization, which is critical
  for the proper balance of excitation–inhibition in neuronal circuits. WNK-SPAK/OSR1
  inhibition, via the coincident effects of NKCC1 inhibition and KCC2 activation (the
  main Cl− extrusion mechanism in neurons), might be a potent way of facilitating
  neuronal Cl− extrusion to restore ionic inhibition in diseases that are characterized
  by disordered Cl− homeostasis and GABA disinhibition. ZT-1a, a novel molecular compound,
  can specifically inhibit SPAK signalling pathway, thus interfering SPAK regulation
  of GABA signalling via NKCC1 inhibition and KCC2 activation []. Activation of protein
  kinase C (PKC) and brain-type creatine kinase (CKB) are likely to increase KCC2
  cell surface expression, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear.
