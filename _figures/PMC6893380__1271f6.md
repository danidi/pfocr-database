caption: Tel1 regulates telomere length in a pathway distinct from the DNA damage
  response. Diagram demonstrating the distinctions between Tel1 pathways in the DNA
  damage response and telomere length regulation. (A) The DNA damage response is most
  strongly regulated by Mec1 and Rad53 as indicated with the bold arrows, although
  Tel1 signaling through Rad53 and MRX plays a role. The MRX complex is both upstream
  and downstream of Tel1 in the DNA damage response. (B) For telomere length regulation,
  Tel1 does not require MRX after activation and Rad53 does not plan a role in the
  Tel1 telomere length regulation pathway. The Tel1/MRX pathway plays the major role
  in telomere length compared to a minor role of Mec1/Rad53 pathway.
