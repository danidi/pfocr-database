  kodakarensis. A modified Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway generates ATP and reduced
  ferredoxin(s) (Fdred; red). The alternative pathways proposed to regenerate Fdox
  (brick red) are illustrated with enzyme/complexes identified by name and the encoding
  T. kodakarensis gene number(s). The same colors are used to report the results obtained
  with each enzyme/complex in  through . Electron transfer to protons by the membrane
  bound hydrogenase (Mbh) complex (yellow; TK2080–93) generates H2 (red square). Mbh
  activity also produces a proton-gradient that can be exploited for ATP-production.
  A cytosolic hydrogenase (cyan; TK2069–72) can consume H2 to generate NADPH, and
  NADPH may also be produced by ferredoxin-NADPH oxidoreductases (blue; TK1684–5,
  purple; TK1325–6). An NADPH:sulfur reductase (brown; TK1299) and NADPH:polysulfide
  reductase (pink; TK1481) are predicted to generate H2S when S° is available. A membrane
  bound oxidoreductase (Mbx) complex (green; TK1214–26) is predicted to functionally
  replace the Mbh complex when S° is present, although no efflux function for Mbx
  has been established. SurR (red; TK1086) is a redox-sensitive transcription regulator.
  When reduced, SurR activates transcription of the Mbh operon and represses transcription
  of the S° regulon. Transcription of the genes (TK1260–61) encoding SipA and SipB
  (orange) is highly induced by the presence of S°. A glutamate-dependent alanine
  aminotransferase (grey; TK1094) converts pyruvate to alanine, generating 2-oxoglutarate
  from glutamate, and the regeneration of glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase (TK1431)
  oxidizes NADPH to NADP.
