caption: TGF-β mediates metastasis. TGF-β produced by cancer cells can alter the bone
  microenvironment by inducing the expression of osteolytic factors like PTHrP and
  IL11. The osteoclast bone resorption via RANKL production by osteoblasts results
  in more release of TGF-β, which in turn acts on tumor cells thereby creating a positive
  feedback loop called a “vicious cycle”. Chemokine receptor CXCL4 and angiogenesis
  inducer connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are also key modulators induced by
  TGF-β in this process. Another important factor of this metastatic preference is
  the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf 1 (DKK1); cells that highly secrete DKK1 tend to metastasize
  to bone, while low DKK1-secreting tumor cells tend to metastasize to the lung. TGF-β
  leads to transcriptional upregulation of proangiogenic factors, including CTGF,
  matrix metalloprotease (MMP)2, MMP-9, and MMP10, or inhibition of TIMP to mediate
  the formation of new blood vessels. TGF-β inhibits the proliferation of T cells
  and B cells and inhibits the production of immune factors by B lymphocytes. In addition,
  TGF-β-induced angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) via the SMAD signaling pathway is proangiogenic
  and can disrupt lung capillary walls and seed pulmonary metastases. Inhibitory signals
  are indicated with inhibitory red arrows; Stimulatory signals are indicated with
  green arrows.
