caption: An integrative schematic view of the human and plant terminal telomeric complex.
  (A) Human active telomerase is associated with Hsp90 and p23 chaperones as well
  as with TR associated conserved scaffold proteins of box H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs
  (dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, GAR1). Mammalian shelterin proteins (TRF1/2, RAP1, TIN2,
  TPP1, and POT1) modulate access to the telomerase complex and the ATR/ATM-dependent
  DNA damage response pathway. The CST complex (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) affects telomerase
  and DNA polymerase α recruitment to the chromosomal termini, and, thus, coordinates
  G-overhang extension by telomerase with fill-in synthesis of the complementary C-strand
  (blue dashed line). G-quadruplexes, D-loops, and t-loops during telomere replication
  are resolved by RTEL helicase. HOT1 directly binds double strand telomere repeats
  and associates with the active telomerase. Telomere nucleosomes show a shorter periodicity
  than that in the other parts of chromosomes. For human telomere histone modifications,
  see . (B) Arabidopsis telomerase is associated with TRB proteins as well as with
  POT1a that interacts with the dyskerin orthologue CBF5. Plants possess all orthologue
  proteins of conserved scaffold box H/ACA of small nucleolar RNAs (CBF5, GAR1, NOP10,
  NHP2). Moreover, TRB proteins interact with the telomeric sequence due to the same
  myb-like binding domain as that in mammalian TRF1/2. TRB proteins interact with
  TERT and POT1b, and, when localized at chromosomal ends, they are eligible to function
  as components of the plant shelterin complex. An evolutionarily conserved CST complex
  is suggested to coordinate the unique requirements for efficient replication of
  telomeric DNA in plants as well as in other organisms. In addition, plant RTEL contributes
  to telomere homeostasis. For the sake of clarity, only the situation in telomere
  with 3′ overhang is depicted. For plant telomere histone modifications, see .
