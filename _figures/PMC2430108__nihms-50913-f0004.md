caption: Choline metabolism (selected pathways). Metabolism of choline intersects
  with the homocysteine metabolism. Choline is phosphorylated to phosphocholine by
  choline kinase in the first step toward phosphatidylcholine synthesis. In an alternate
  pathway, choline serves as a methyl donor (through betaine) for the methylation
  of homocysteine to methionine.
