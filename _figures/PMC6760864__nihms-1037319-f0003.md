caption: Small GTPases are important regulators of the MK cytoskeletons, DMS biogenesis,
  and proplatelet formation. Activation of CDC42 is dependent on the GPIb-V-IX complex,
  filamin A, and the F-BAR proteins, CIP4 and PACSIN2 (grey boxes). CDC42 affects
  the activity state of ADF/COFILIN via PAK2/LIMK signaling for proper DMS formation
  (blue boxes). WD40 repeat protein 1 (WDR1) forms a complex with COFILIN. Downstream
  of RHOA, ROCK controls F-actin levels via ADF/COFILIN and bending via MLC and non-muscle
  myosin (NMM-IIA) (green boxes). Macrothrombocytopenia (macroTP), an abnormal DMS,
  and impaired PPF are common to mutant mice with defects in RHOA/ROCK or CDC42/PAK2
  signaling pathways. However, mice deficient in CDC42 show additional defects such
  as ectopic platelet release into the bone marrow niche and increased clearance of
  platelets from the circulation. Similar defects are observed in mice deficient in
  WASP, ARP2/3, PROFILIN1, and ADAP (orange boxes), suggesting that these proteins
  are part of the same signaling pathway. Micro-thrombocytopenia (microTP), an altered
  tubulin cytoskeleton in platelets, abnormal DMS polarization, and defective proplatelet
  extension are additional defects characteristic for these mice. The small GTPase
  RAC1 can partially compensate for deficiency in CDC42 (not shown). Listed in red
  font are the main MK and platelet phenotypes in mice with defects in the respective
  signaling molecules.
