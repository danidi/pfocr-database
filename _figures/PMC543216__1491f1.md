caption: Biosynthetic Pathways of Sterols Required for Normal Plant Development.Cycloartenol,
  a polycyclic sterol intermediate unique to plants, is alkylated at C-24 by SMT1
  to produce a triene in a series of steps (dashed arrow). FK, a C-14 sterol reductase,
  and HYD1, a Δ8-Δ7 isomerase, act on the triene to yield 24-methylenelophenol, a
  branch point in the pathway. Parallel pathways lead to the membrane sterols sitosterol
  and campesterol. SMT2 controls the ratio of the two sterols. Campesterol also serves
  as the progenitor of brassinosteroids, which are required for normal postembryonic
  development. Defects in embryogenesis are observed in mutants upstream of 24-methylenelophenol
  (in red) but not in downstream mutants (in blue or green). Mutants shown in green,
  such as dwf7/stel (pictured), show typical brassinosteroid-deficient phenotypes
  that can be rescued by brassinosteroid treatment.(A) Morphological differences between
  wild-type (left) and fk (right) embryos at the heart stage. The arrow shows the
  lack of normal cell division and elongation in the central cells.(B) An adult fk
  mutant shows some of the characteristics of brassinosteroid-deficient mutants, but
  it cannot be rescued by brassinosteroid treatment.(C) The fk mutant often has multiple
  cotyledons.
