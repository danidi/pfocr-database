caption: We analyzed the signaling pathways network of dynamic regulation during somitogenesis
  at three different time points including12h, 24h and 48h. Fc epsilon RI signaling
  pathway was only significantly regulated in 12h, PPAR signaling pathway and Insulin
  signaling pathway were significantly regulated in 24h, Jak-STAT signaling pathway
  and B cell receptor signaling pathway were significantly regulated in 48h. 2 signaling
  pathways played roles at both 12h and 24h. Erb signaling pathway can activate Neurotrophin
  signaling pathway via MAPK signaling pathway. Jun, regulated by MAPK signaling pathway,
  induce neurotrophin activation. 5 signaling pathways regulated significantly at
  24h and 48h, TGF-β signaling pathway activated Wnt signaling pathway via the expression
  of TGF-β1. Wnt1 is target gene of Wnt signaling pathway and Wnt1 can induced the
  activation of mTOR signaling pathway. 3 signaling pathways regulated significantly
  at 12h and 48h. 9 signaling pathways regulated at three different time points. MAPK
  and Hedgehog signaling pathways can activate Notch signaling pathway by activating
  Akt2 and Gli2 respectively. Notch1 and Hes1 are the downstream effectors of Notch
  signaling pathway and Hes1 is the target gene of Notch1. Hes7 can inhibit Notch
  target genes, so we hypothesize that Hes1 may have the similar effect. For simplicity,
  several target genes, gene products, and regulatory interactions are not shown.
