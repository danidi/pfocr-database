caption: Microbial infection or stimuli can robustly activate a variety of cell surface
  receptors linked to TRAF proteins that serve as critical intermediary signaling
  proteins to mediate cytokine synthesis and release. The F box protein Fbxl2 serves
  as a sentinel inhibitor of TRAFs by mediating their polyubiquitination (red circles)
  and proteasomal degradation in cells. Fbxl2 specifically targets at a conserved
  tryptophan domain within all TRAF 1-6. During microbial infection, another F box
  protein, Fbxo3, targets Fbxl2 for its ubiquitination and degradation at K201; this
  process is facilitated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) phosphorylation (green
  circle) of Fbxl2 at T404. WT Fbxo3 in this pathway potently activates cytokine driven
  inflammation, whereas a naturally occurring Fbxo3V221I polymorphism is hypofunctional.
  A small molecule Fbxo3 inhibitor, BC-1215, reduces inflammation by antagonizing
  actions of Fbxo3 on TRAF–cytokine signaling.
