caption: Schematic representation of possible mechanisms releasing mitochondrial components
  into the circulation. Dysfunctional but not yet depolarised mitochondria are targeted
  to degradation by serine/threonine-protein kinase PTEN-induced putative kinase 1
  (PINK1) and Parkin. This priming process may also assist in the generation of mitochondrial-derived
  vesicles (MDVs). MDVs reach out the endolysosomal system and form multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) that are unloaded outside the cell as exosomes. Impairment of mitochondrial
  quality control processes may also lead to accumulation of intracellular oxidised
  components that can be released as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  following a vesicle-free pathway. In particular, damaged mitochondrial transcription
  factor A (TFAM)-bound (green circles) or unbound (red circles) mitochondrial DNA
  (mtDNA) particles can be released as DAMPs. These molecules are pro-inflammatory
  and can activate three distinct signalling routes via interaction with (1) toll-like
  receptors (TLRs), (2) nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptor
  family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and (3) cytosolic cyclic GMP-AMP
  synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) DNA-sensing system. IFN,
  interferon; IL, interleukin; IRF-1, interferon regulatory factor 1; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor κB; OPA1, optic atrophy 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TBK1, TANK-binding
  kinase 1; TNF-α, tumour necrosis factor alpha.
