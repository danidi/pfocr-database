caption: Overview of the inflammatory reflex in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The central
  nervous system (CNS) detects peripheral inflammation through the afferent vagus
  nerve and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The signals act at different levels via (i)
  activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which reduces inflammation;
  (ii) the cerebral cortex; and (iii) nuclei in the brain stem. The efferent branch
  of the vagus nerve is activated via the activation of alpha-7 subunit of nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) on macrophages, resulting in decreased cytokine
  production. This mechanism is called the “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.”
  The combination of inflammation in peripheral tissues, signaling of this information
  to the brain, and the subsequent efferent neuronal response comprises the “inflammatory
  reflex.” The activation of α7nAChRs on macrophages can occur locally in the RA joint
  or in the spleen. The sympathetic fibers of the splenic nerve are activated in the
  celiac ganglion, leading to noradrenaline (NA) production in the spleen. NA binds
  to α/β-adrenergic receptors (α/β-ARs) on choline acetyltransferase-positive T cells,
  which then produce the anti-inflammatory parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine
  (Ach), in turn activating α7nAChRs and leading to the reduced production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. In the joint, the activation of a7nAChRs on fibroblast-like synoviocytes
  or other immune cells also reduces cytokine production. TNF, tumor necrosis factor;
  IL, interleukin; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1.
