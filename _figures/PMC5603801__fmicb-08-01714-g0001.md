caption: (A) Proposed pathway for PNP catabolism in Pseudomonas sp. strain WBC-3 (modified
  after Zhang et al., ) pnpA and pnpB are PNP 4-monooxygenase and p-benzoquinone reductase
  respectively; pnpCDEF encode α- and β-subunits of hydroquinone dioxygenase, γ-hydroxymuconic
  semialdehyde dehydrogenase and maleylacetate reductase, respectively. (B) Schematic
  of the regulatory circuit of the PNP catabolic cluster in Pseudomonas sp. strain
  WBC-3 (figure not drawn to scale, modified after Zhang et al., ). Four ellipses
  stand for PnpR tetramer, and four diamonds stand for PnpM tetramer. The curved and
  dotted arrow stands for binding of para-nitrophenol (PNP) with PnpR or PnpM. The
  down arrows stand for PnpR's activating four operons of pnpA, pnpB, pnpCDEFG, and
  pnpR. The up arrows stand for PnpM's activating two operons of pnpCDEFG and pnpA1M.PnpR
  regulates transcription initiation in four regions pnpA, pnpB, pnpCDEFG, and pnpR.
  PnpM regulates transcription initiation in two regions pnpCDEFG and pnpA1M.
