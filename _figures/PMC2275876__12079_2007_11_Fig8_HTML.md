caption: Schematic representation of the regulation of SCD1 gene transcription in
  hepatic cells. Schematic representation of the regulation of SCD1 gene transcription
  in hepatic cells. The top part of the figure represents the signaling pathway implicated
  in the insulin regulation of SCD1 gene transcription. The large grey arrow represents
  the promoter where the different 5′-deletion constructs are indicated. The lower
  part represents the transcription factors implicated in the regulation of SCD1 gene
  transcription in liver in response to activation of the indicated signaling pathway
