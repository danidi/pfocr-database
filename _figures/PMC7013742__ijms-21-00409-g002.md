caption: 'Putative SUR1 molecular signaling pathways beyond cerebral edema in brain
  injury. (A) Some key Sur1 signaling pathways after brain injury. This schematic
  illustrates upstream regulators of Sur1 (Abcc8) transcription such as Hif1-α, SP1
  and TNF-α. The precipitating injury (e.g., hypoxia, TBI, mechanical stimulus) is
  listed in green. Downstream consequences of inhibiting upregulated Sur1 (via glyburide/glibenclamide
  or genetic knockout) on three major categories (blood brain barrier integrity, neuroinflammation,
  and cell death) are shown in red. Specific references that have demonstrated these
  effects are listed contextually and categorized by disease model. (B) Neuroinflammation,
  Sur1-Trpm4, and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2). This illustration shows effects
  of Sur1-Trpm4 activation on nitric oxide (NO) production in microglial cells (pathway
  in green). Toll like receptor-4 (TLR4) activation induces de novo upregulation and
  activation of Sur1-Trpm4. Resultant depolarization, decreases the inward driving
  force for Ca2+, yielding low-amplitude repetitive oscillations of Ca2+. This activates
  calcineurin (CN), which dephosphorylates cytoplasmic NFAT and allows nuclear translocation.
  Nuclear NFAT is a transcription factor that upregulates transcription of Nos2, and
  thereby increases expression of NOS2 and production of NO. Inhibition of Sur1-Trpm4
  by glyburide (glibenclamide) shown in the red pathway, increases intracellular calcium
  which activates calmodulin dependent protein kinase-II (CAMKII). CAMKII phosphorylates
  CN thereby inactivating it and preventing dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation
  of NFAT. Thus, Nos2 transcription is inhibited and NO production reduced. (C) Blood–brain
  barrier integrity: Sur1-Trpm4 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Tissue plasminogen
  activator (tPA) converts plasminogen to plasmin, resulting in the cleavage (at Arg41)
  of protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1). Activated PAR1, via G protein receptor
  signaling (GPCR), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphatidylinositol biphosphate (PIP2)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG) activates transient receptor potential channel-3 (TRPC3,
  red) facilitating calcium entry and phasic MMP-9 secretion. Sur1-Trpm4 activation
  (orange) causing Na+ influx and depolarization, results in negative feedback of
  TRPC3, thereby inhibiting Ca2+ influx. Inhibition via glyburide (glibenclamide)
  despite increasing the drive for Ca2+ influx, reduces phasic MMP-9 secretion via
  a yet to be determined mechanism. One potential hypothesis includes phosphorylated
  CAMKII mediated PAR1 desensitization and internalization. BAX = Bcl-associated X
  protein; BCL2 = b cell lymphoma 2; CAMKII = calmodulin dependent protein kinase-II;
