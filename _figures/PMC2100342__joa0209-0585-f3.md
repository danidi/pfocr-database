caption: 'Activation of NF-κB via the classical and the alternative pathway. Signalling
  via the LTβR can initiate both NF-κB activation pathways. The classical pathway
  leads to the expression of the inflammatory molecules VCAM1, MIP-1β and MIP-2, and
  an increase of p100. The first step in this cascade is the activation of the β unit
  of the IKK complex. This activated IKKβ complex leads to phosphorylation and ubiquitination
  of the IκBα, which allows the p50-RelA heterodimer to translocate to the nucleus
  and bind to the DNA. The alternative pathway follows a similar mechanism: after
  activation of the IKKα complex, p100 is phosphorylated and processed to p52. The
  remaining p52-RelB heterodimer induces the expression of the homeostatic cytokines
  CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13 and CXCL12, after translocation into the nucleus. (Modified
