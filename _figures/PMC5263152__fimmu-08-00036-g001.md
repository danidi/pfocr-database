caption: 'Mechanisms of canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  Diagram showing the canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and
  representation of the molecular mechanisms through which several compounds inhibit
  NLRP3 activation and counteract intestinal inflammation. Left panel: first step
  of canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation by TLRs–MyD88 and/or TNFR, which activate
  pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 transcription via NF-κB activation. The second step results
  in NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization, leading to caspase-1 activation as well as
  IL-1β and IL-18 release. Extracellular ATP, degradation of extracellular matrix
  components, increase in potassium efflux, ROS, cathepsin activation, and deubiquitination
  promote NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization and activation. Caspase-1 activation
  promotes also pyroptosis and HMGB1 release. Right panel: first step of non-canonical
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Gram-negative bacteria (i.e., Citrobacter rodentium,
  Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae) activate the TLR4–MyD88 and TRIF pathways,
  with consequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which promotes the transcription
  of IL-1β, IL-18, and NLRP3 as well as IRF-3 and IRF7 genes. The IRF3–IRF7 complex
  (1) elicits the expression of IFN-α/β (2) that binds the IFNAR1/IFNAR2 receptor
  (3), leading to activation of the JAK/STAT pathway (4) and transcription of caspase-11
  gene (5). In the second step, unidentified scaffold proteins or receptors induced
  by Gram-negative bacteria cleave and activate caspase-11, which induces pyroptosis
  as well as HMGB1 and IL-1α release, and promotes the activation of NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1
  pathway. Abbreviations: NLRP3, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine
  rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3; TLRs, toll-like receptors; MyD88,
  adaptor molecules myeloid differentiation primary response 88; TNFR, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; ATP, adenosine triphosphate, ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; TRIF, toll/IL-1 receptor homology
  (TIR)-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor; IFN, interferon; IFNAR, interferon-α/β receptor; IL, interleukin; P2X, purinergic
  receptor 7; JAK/STAT, janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription;
  NRF2/ARE, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/antioxidant response element.'
