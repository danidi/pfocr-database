caption: Upon TLR stimulation, the adaptor protein MyD88 is recruited to the receptor
  complex. MyD88 then recruits IRAK4 and IRAK1 which results in the accumulation of
  hyperphosphorylated IRAK1. This leads to the activation of TRAF6 which triggers
  NF-κB activation via MAP3 kinases such as TAK1 and NIK. While the canonical pathway
  can be activated by a number of upstream kinases, the noncanonical pathway is strictly
  dependent upon NIK. Monarch-1 is capable of blocking both pathways through its interactions
  with IRAK1 and NIK. Monarch-1 suppresses canonical NF-κB activation by blocking
  the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated IRAK1. The noncanonical pathway is also
  inhibited as the association of Monarch-1 with NIK leads to rapid proteasome dependent
  degradation of the kinase.
