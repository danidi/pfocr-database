caption: 'Metabolic network related to NADPH production. Black arrows indicate enzymatic
  steps of glucose and proline metabolism of procyclic trypanosomes grown in glucose-rich
  conditions, whereas white arrows correspond to proline metabolism in the absence
  of glucose (). Dashed arrows symbolize steps for which no evidence of flux is available.
  The proposed NADH/NADPH converting cycle or transhydrogenase-like shunt is indicated
  by green arrows. For simplification, only NADP+/NADPH and NAD+/NADH involved in
  the putative transhydrogenase-like shunt are shown. Excreted end products of glucose
  and proline metabolism are indicated by a black background. The pools of metabolites
  shared by different subcellular compartments are indicated by gray areas. Experimental
  evidence for most of the intracellular transmembrane translocation is missing. The
  abbreviations used are: α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; 1,3-BPGA, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate;
  3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fum, fumarate; GAP,
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Mal, malate; Oxac, oxaloacetate; Pyr, pyruvate; R5P,
  ribulose 5-phosphate; Suc, succinate; Suc-CoA, succinyl-CoA. Key enzymes are: 1,
