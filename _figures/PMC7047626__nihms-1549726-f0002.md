caption: (A) Autophagy involves removal of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components
  like proteins, lipids or organelles. Broadly, autophagy is classified as 1. Macroautophagy-
  It is the most extensively studied form of autophagy for bulk degradation of cellular
  components. It involves formation of phagophore, a double membrane structure around
  the targeted components. Autophagosome formed around the target merges with the
  lysosome leading to formation of autophagolysosomes to enable degradation of engulfed
  contents. Micro autophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy involves direct uptake
  of targeted contents into lysosomes via lysosomal invagination or binding of chaperon
  tagged proteins to lysosomal-associated membrane protein LAMP-2A. (B) and (C) Mitophagy
  is a type of macroautophagy targeting mitochondria specifically. (C) Mitophagy receptors
  can tag mitochondria for phagophore formation in ubiquitin-dependent, LIR-motif
  protein-dependent and lipid-mediated pathway. The ubiquitin-dependent pathway involves
  ubiquitination of OMM proteins to form poly ubiquitin chains with the help of E3
  ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes. The polyubiquitin chains are detected by NDP52,
  OPTN, NBR1 and p62 which contains both UBD and LIR motifs. These proteins aid in
  interaction of ubiquitinated mitochondria to LC3 containing phagophore. LIR-motif
  protein-dependent pathway involves regulation of expression and modification of
  LIR-motif containing OMM proteins. Proteins like NIX, BNIP3, FUNDC1 helps with the
  interaction of targeted-mitochondria to LC3-containing phagophore. Lastly, lipid-mediated
  mitophagy involves accumulation of LC3 interacting lipids including cardiolipin
  and ceramide on OMM, tagging mitochondria for phagophore interaction.
