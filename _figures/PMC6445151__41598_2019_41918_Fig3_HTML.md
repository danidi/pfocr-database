caption: 'The differential network for the pathway “Signaling by NOTCH1” in the lateral
  compartment. Tan edges are associations that are stronger in the anterior domain,
  and red edges are stronger in the posterior domain. Edges are scaled proportional
  to the DC score, and nodes are scaled proportional to the fold change in expression
  between the two domains. Here, Jag2 is the only gene that is significantly DE. If
  the monotonized p-values for edges are preferred, then two edges remain significant:
  Maml2-Maml3 and Notch1-Maml1.'
