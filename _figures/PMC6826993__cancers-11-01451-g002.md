caption: (A) After co-culture between adipocytes and breast cancer (BC) cells, high
  levels of miR-144 and miR-126 were released by exosomes by BC cells. This miRs delivery
  leads to final adipolysis and remodeling of adipose tissue driven by miR-144 through
  the downregulation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 8/Mitogen-Activated
  Protein Kinase 3/1/Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (MAPK3/ERK1/2/
  pPPARγ) and by miR-126 through the Protein Kinase AMP-Activated Catalytic Subunit
  Alpha 1 (AMPK)/ autophagy pathway, causing adipocyte-induced tumor growth []. BC-derived
  exosomes after adipocytes interaction carry a higher level of miR-155, which promotes
  adipocytes differentiation and remodeling in surrounding adipocytes targeting pPPARγ,
  thus facilitating tumor progression []. Increased adipocyte-derived interleukin-8
  (IL-8) is responsible for neutrophils and macrophages recruitment, leading to the
  production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS),
  which act as a threat to tumor initiation. (B) Interaction of adipocytes with BC
  cells increase the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading
  to an upregulation of miR-3184-5p and downregulation of miR-181c-3p in BC cells,
  with the modulation of their respective target genes, forkhead box P4 (FOXP4) and
  PPARα; increased release of adipocyte-derived proinflammatory cytokines and adipokins
  such as leptin (LEP), IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is responsible
  for the induction of janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription
  (JAK/STAT) and through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PIK3/AKT) pathways.
  Resistin (RETN) promotes BC progression through the Toll like receptor 4/nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells/ signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (TLR4/ NF-κB /STAT3) axis. As a result, EMT, migration and invasion
  pathways are enhanced in BC cells []. Likewise, after adipocytes and BC cells co-culture,
  there is an increase of proinflammatory cytokines secretion, with an activation
  of Src that upregulates SRY-Box transcription factor 2 (SOX2), cMYC and Nanog. SOX2
  induces miR-302b transcription that, in turn, further stimulates cMYC and SOX2 expression,
  increasing the cytokine-induced cancer stem cell-like properties []. Conversely,
  adiponectin (APN) has anti-tumoral properties by inhibiting mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) and NF-κB pathways. (C) Treatment with the anti-tumor compound
  shikonin (SK). SK-treated adipocytes release high levels of miR-140, which block
  tumor progression of co-cultured BC cells targeting SOX9 signaling [].
