caption: The leptin–melanocortin pathway. Simplified schematic of the leptin–melanocortin
  signalling pathway, which has a critical role in energy homeostasis by acting as
  a nexus through which information about energy status in the periphery can be relayed
  to the central nervous system (CNS) and integrated to control food intake and energy
  expenditure. ARC, arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus; POMC, proopiomelanocortin;
  LepR, leptin receptor; PVN, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; MSH, melanocyte-stimulating
  hormone (α-MSH, β-MSH, γ-MSH); MC4R, melanocortin-4 receptor; SIM1, single-minded
  1.
