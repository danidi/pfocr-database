caption: '(A) Results of pathway analysis of metabolomics data. Pathway analysis based
  on “Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes” (KEGG).The color and size of each circle
  is based on p-values (yellow: higher p-values and red: lower p-values) and pathway
  impact values (the larger the circle the higher the impact score) calculated from
  the topological analysis, respectively. Pathways were considered significantly enriched
  if p < 0.05, impact >0.1 and number of metabolite hits in the pathway >1. PTC, papillary
  thyroid carcinoma. (B) The significantly enriched pathways involved in the pathogenesis
  of papillary thyroid carcinoma, including Aspartate metabolism, Glutamate metabolism,
  Urea cycle, and TCA cycle.'
