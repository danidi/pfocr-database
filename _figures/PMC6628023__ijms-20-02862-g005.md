caption: Schematic illustration of the molecular pathway of AhR and its effects on
  FSHR and survival. Upon binding to a ligand in the cytoplasm, the AhR–ligand compound
  translocates into the nucleus and heterodimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator
  (ARNT). The complex binds to the dioxin response elements (DRE). AhR activates FSHR
  transcription by binding to the promoter of this gene (not shown in the figure).
  In our study, depicted in the yellow box, we found that ovarian cancer patients
  with low FSHR levels had a better outcome than patients with a high number of FSH
  receptors. In the green box, we wanted to illustrate our hypothesis further. Ovarian
  cancer patients with high levels of FSHR could benefit from a gonadotropin-releasing
  hormone (GnRH) modulation therapy as it would lead to reduced FSH levels and thereby
  potentially reduce the responsiveness of FSHR.
