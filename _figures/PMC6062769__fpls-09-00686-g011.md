caption: Mapping of the tyrosine metabolism pathways involved in CmPht1;2 Oe1 response
  to LP compared with WT based on KEGG. Blue circles indicate metabolites that were
  downregulated in the CmPht1;2 Oe1 compared with WT. Red circles indicate metabolites
  that were upregulated inCmPht1;2 Oe1 compared with WT. Boxes indicate the enzymes
  involved in this pathway.
