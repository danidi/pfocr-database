caption: The sRNA GcvB targetome contains amino acid/peptide transporters and amino
  acid biosynthesis genes. A sponge RNA SroC, originated from one of the targets,
  base pairs with sRNA GcvB and recruits RNase E. Degradation of GcvB causes derepression
  of its targetome, including the parental mRNA of SroC (cross talk is indicated by
  dashed arrows in this figure). In this regulatory circuit, the sponge interacts
  with multiple mRNAs that are physically unlinked but functionally works in the same
  pathway. Another example is the chb sponge that degrades ChiX sRNA in a similar
  RNase E-dependent manner leading to expression of an outer membrane protein ChiP.
