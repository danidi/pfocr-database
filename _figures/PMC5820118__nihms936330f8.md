caption: The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a complex
  process involving more than 30 enzymes. A simplified version is shown here, highlighting
  the step of mevalonate synthesis, which is inhibited by statins so as to reduce
  intracellular cholesterol levels; through several interposed steps, these lead to
  upregulated expression of the LDLR gene. Enhanced LDLR expression increases receptor-mediated
  endocytosis of LDL and thus lowers serum LDL; the liver produces/contains the most
  LDL receptors and therefore it removes most LDL from blood. Notable is the adverse
  side-effect of the attendant impaired synthesis and lowered body's levels of coenzyme
  Q10, which is important in cellular energy generation processes and as a powerful
  antioxidant, reducing free radicals that can damage cells and DNA. Taking CoQ10
  supplements can help increase CoQ10 levels and may reduce statin side effects.
