caption: 'Graphical illustration of the metabolic pathway in cyanobacteria for the
  biosynthesis of value-added products. During the reduction of compounds into their
  target molecules, energy is required, which is supplied by photosystem in cyanobacteria
  where sunlight energy transferred H2O into energy-rich ATP and NADPH molecules.
