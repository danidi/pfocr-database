caption: Expression profile-based integration of HERVs/MaLRs in immunity genes related
  pathways. a The gene-centred network illustrates HERV/MaLR integration in the “role
  of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses” pathway
  (PRR). Seven genes specific for this pathway are depicted (oval frames) together
  with their parental chromosome. HERV/MaLR elements associated with these unique
  genes were identified using both Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and co-expression between
  HERVs/MaLRs and genes. Tolerisable and non-tolerisable elements are represented
  by empty or green boxes, respectively. Ten HERV/MaLR elements belong exclusively
  to the PRR pathway (top rectangular frames), while 22 HERVs/MaLRs loci are shared
  by several pathways (bottom rectangular frames). Five HERV/MaLR elements are located
  at a distance of less than 40 kb from the OAS3 and OAS2 or C5AR1/C5AR2 genes (dark
  blue font and turquoise connectors, C5AR2 absent from the microarray). Four HERV/MaLR
  elements are located in a 40 kb window (large turquoise rectangle) flanked by IFI44
  and IFI44L genes (connected by a dotted line as absent from the microarray). b HERVs/MALRs
  integration in several pathways. The HERV/MaLR-centred network illustrates the integration
  of HERVs and MaLRs elements within 11 networks (grey boxes). Tolerisable and non-tolerisable
  elements are represented by empty or green boxes, respectively. Ten out of 15 tolerisable
  HERV/MaLR elements are exclusively linked to the 4 pathways at the top (red connectors),
  “activation of IRF by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors”, “role of pattern
  recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses”, “interferon signalling”
  and “role of RIG1-like receptors in antiviral innate immunity”. Three elements are
  exclusively associated with 3 pathways (2 out of the 3 non-tolerisable elements
  and 1 tolerisable element), “dendritic cell maturation”, “TREM1 signalling”, and
  “LXR/RXR activation” (green connectors)
