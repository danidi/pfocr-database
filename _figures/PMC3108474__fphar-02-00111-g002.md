caption: Membrane type-MMPs regulate vascular cell signaling in cancer. MT1-MMP regulates
  cell migration through both ECM proteolysis and non-proteolytic-dependent TIMP-2
  activation of ERK1/2 pathway. MT1-MMP regulates VEGF gene expression through Src,
  Akt, and mTOR activation and stimulates tumor angiogenesis. In addition, it induces
  RANKL shedding and signaling through Src leading to cell migration. MT1-MMP cooperates
  with platelet derived S1P to induce signaling through G protein-coupled-receptors
  (GPCRs) and regulates endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis. MT1-MMP regulates
  TGFβ bioavailability and its signaling through ALK5 leading to vessel maturation.
  Shedding of Tie-2 or degradation of decorin by MT1-MMP stimulates angiogenesis,
  but shedding of endoglin from endothelial cell surface inhibits angiogenesis. ProTGFβ
  can also be activated by MMP2 and MMP9. MT1-MMP activates PDGFRβ signaling and regulates
  pericyte migration and vessel maturation. MT4-MMP a metastatic MMP, is highly expressed
  by cancer cells and induces tumor vessel destabilization through pericyte detachment.
