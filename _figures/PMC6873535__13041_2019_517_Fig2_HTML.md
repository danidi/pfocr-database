  description: Effect of RAS signaling components on neural stem cell differentiation.
    Neural stem cells are able to generate progeny cells that terminally differentiate
    into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. a NF1 inactivation led to decreased
    neurogenesis in neonatal and adult mouse brains []. PTPN11 positively regulates
    neurogenesis at the expense of gliogenesis []. b NF1 negatively regulates gliogenesis,
    thus NF1 inactivation increases the number of glial progenitor cells and gliogenesis
    [, , , , , ]. PTPN11 suppresses gliogenesis by directly interacting with the JAK-STAT
    pathway, which promotes gliogenesis [, ]. c Hyperactivation of RAF1 induces the
    increase of glial lineage populations, including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells
    and astrocytes []. MEK is required for gliogenesis, and the hyperfunction of MEK1
    leads to increase in glial populations [, ]. d BRAF and RAF1 positively regulate
    neuronal differentiation, and the disruption of BRAF or RAF1 impairs the ability
    of progenitor cells to differentiate into mature neurons in mouse brain [, ].
    In consistent, iPSC containing hyperactivated BRAF mutant showed early maturation
    of neurons []. e Oligodendroglial lineage potential is restricted by NF1 in the
    adult hippocampus, and inactivation of NF1 allows the adult hippocampus to generate
    oligodendrocytes []. f BRAF is required for oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination
    during postnatal development []. g Hyperactivated HRAS leads to an acceleration
