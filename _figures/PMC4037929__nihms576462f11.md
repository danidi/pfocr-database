caption: Purinergic autoregulation model of mechanosensitivity in human ECs. In a
  majority of hEC, mechanically evoked 5-HT release is tightly autoregulated by corelease
  of ATP via 3 distinct purinergic signaling mechanisms. In the remainder of cells,
  either autoregulation does not occur or it involves nonpurinergic mechanisms. A,
  Mechanical stimulation releases ATP (or ADP) to activate a slow P2Y1-PLC/IP3-Ca2+-dependent
  mechanism in 48% cells, leading to stimulation of 5-HT release. B, In a distinct
  subset of hEC, a slow P2Y12AC/cAMP signaling pathway is activated by ATP (or ADP)
  release leading to attenuation of 5-HT release. C, ATP release in 19% cells can
  alternatively activate a fast ATP-gated P2X3 ion channel to stimulate 5-HT release.
  D, Purinergic pathways are very sensitive to inflammation, and severe downregulation
  of P2X3 channels occurring in UC is expected to alter 5-HT release and contribute
  to abnormal signaling, physiology, and visceral sensation. In this model, purinergic
  autoregulation does not occur in all hEC. 5-HT release evoked by mechanical stimulation
  is not regulated by ATP in about 25% to 30% of hEC. Overall, mechanical stimulation
  coreleases 5-HT, ATP/other purines (ADP and adenosine), or other mediators (prostaglandins
  and PACAP). 5-HT, ATP, and perhaps other mediators can trigger gut motor reflexes
  and visceral sensation, and any disruption in purinergic autoregulation and fine
  tune modulation of 5-HT release could have important consequences in IBD.
