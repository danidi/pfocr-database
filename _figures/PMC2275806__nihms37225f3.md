caption: Regulation of SIRT1 enzymatic activity. SIRT1 catalyzes a NAD+-dependent
  protein deacetylase activity. This biochemical reaction is regulated by different
  metabolic inputs as well as several polyphenols. Moreover, several metabolic pathways
  including NAD+de novo biosynthesis from tryptophan and increasing the NAD+ salvage
  pathway influence SIRT1 enzymatic activity.
