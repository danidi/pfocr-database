caption: (A) Schematic representation of a tarsal joint of a dys640 wild type (left)
  and dys640Su(H)-1+2 where the two Su(H) binding sites are mutated (right). See text
  for description. (B) Model for tarsal joint formation. Blue and brown arrowheads
  mark proximal and distal joints, respectively. In a tarsal joint, Notch ligands
  Dl and Ser (blue) activate the Notch pathway in the distal adjacent cells. Notch,
  in turn, activates dys expression, which regulates the high levels of P-Mad observed
  in the joint. Dys also controls the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes rpr and
  hid and the RhoGTPases modulators RhoGef2 and RhoGap71E. The sharp boundary of Dpp
  signaling also regulates rpr expression via JNK pathway activation. The expression
  domains of E(spl)mβ, dys, rpr, hid, RhoGef2 and RhoGap71E are indicated.
