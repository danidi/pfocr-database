caption: A schematic overview of the Notch signaling pathway showing the proteolytic
  events. During maturation and transport of the receptor to the membrane Notch gets
  cleaved in the Golgi system at Site-1 (S1) by a furin-like convertase, resulting
  in a heterodimeric transmembrane receptor. At the cell surface in the absence of
  ligand the receptor is proteolysis-resistant. Only upon binding of ligand, inducing
  a substantial conformational change, the metalloprotease ADAM10 is able to cleave
  Notch at the newly exposed Site-2 (S2). This sheds off the NECD which can be transendocytosed
  into the ligand-expressing cell. On the receptor-expressing cell S2 cleavage results
  in a NEXT fragment that either is directly cleaved at the membrane at Val1744 (NICD-V)
  by the γ-secretase complex, or NEXT is internalized and processed in endocytic compartments
  by γ-secretase at Ser1747 (NICD-S). NICD translocates to the nucleus where it participates
  in a co-activator complex binding to CSL and starts target gene transcription. An
  additional cleavage at Site-4 (S4) is mediated by the γ-secretase in the centre
  of the transmembrane domain resulting in the N fragment, probably meant to clear
  residual Notch fragments from the membrane.
