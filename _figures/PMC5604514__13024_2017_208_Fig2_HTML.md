caption: The activation of HSF1 and its binding to DNA is regulated by a multi-step
  pathway that involves nuclear accumulation, intramolecular and intermolecular protein
  interactions, and post-translational modifications. (1) In the absence of stress,
  HSF1 is maintained in a monomeric state through the regulatory actions of several
  post-translational modifications, intramolecular contacts, and interactions with
  Hsps in inhibitory complexes. Cellular stress results in the accumulation of misfolded
  and damaged proteins, which compete with HSF1 for binding to Hsps. (2) HSF1 monomers
  are released and undergo a conformational change conducive to trimerization. (3)
  Concurrent nuclear accumulation, HSE-binding and hyperphosphorylation of trimeric
  HSF1 occur. (4) This process releases RNA PolII from a paused to an active state
  to initiate the transcription of stress-induced genes. (5) SUMOylation at K298 and
  binding of Hsp40/Hsp70 represses the transcriptional activity of HSF1 trimers. (6)
  Acetylation at K80 disrupts HSF1 binding to DNA and HSF1 trimers dissociate and
  re-join the monomeric pool in the cytosol. Stress-inducible Hsps participate in
  a negative-feedback loop to inhibit further HSF1 activation
