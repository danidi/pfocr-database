caption: Schematic representation of the photorespiratory pathway (in black) and the
  three circumvent pathways designed to overcome the photorespiratory losses. The
  reactions of bypass 1 (in red) are entirely realized into the chloroplast and comprise
  the transformation of glycolate to glycerate, introducing glycolate dehydrogenase,
  glycine decarboxylase and tartronate semialdehyde reductase similar to the E. coli
  glycolate catabolic pathway (Kebeish et al., ). Bypass 2 (in green) follows the
  E. coli glyoxylate catabolic pathway in the peroxisomes by introducing glycine decarboxylase
  and hydroxypyruvate isomerase (Carvalho et al., ). Bypass 3 (in blue) oxidizes glycolate
  to CO2 in the chloroplast, using exogenous (glycolate oxidase and catalase from
  the peroxisomes, and malate synthase from the glyoxysomes) and endogenous (malic
  enzyme and pyruvate dehydrogenase) enzymes (Maier et al., ). In all three bypasses
  release of ammonia in the mitochondrion is abolished; 75% of the glycolate redirected
  toward bypasses 1 and 2 is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-PGA; bypasses
  1 and 3 dislocate CO2 released from the mitochondrion to the chloroplast. Reactions
  stoichiometry is not taken into account; the numbers of carbon atoms of each metabolic
  compound are in italic; 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.
