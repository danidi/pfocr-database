caption: (a) Outline of the putative biosynthetic pathway of haem d1 in bacteria in
  which 5-aminolevulinic acid is synthesized through the C-5 pathway. The C-4 pathway,
  through condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine, found only in proteobacteria is
  omitted in this figure. The catalysis of the second half of haem d1 biosynthesis
  as well as incorporation of haem d1 into cytochrome cd1 are still largely unknown
  and thus labelled with question marks. (b) Structure of haem d1. Based on current
  knowledge, modifications of most of the moieties of uroporphyrinogen III to produce
  haem d1 are performed by unknown enzymes (circled and labelled with ?).
