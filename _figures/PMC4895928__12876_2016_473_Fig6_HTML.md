caption: Schematic diagram showing the potential mechanism of cancer cell proliferation
  and growth regulated by the JNK/FOXO1 pathway in gastric cancer. As depicted, JNK
  activation induces cancer cell proliferation and growth by suppressing the transcriptional
  activity of FOXO1. When JNK is activated by phosphorylation, FOXO1 is phosphorylated,
  leading to its nuclear export and inactivation
pmcid: PMC4895928
papertitle: c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation has a prognostic implication and is
  negatively associated with FOXO1 activation in gastric cancer.
