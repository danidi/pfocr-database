caption: CD40 signaling regulates angiogenesis. (A) CD40-induced signaling pathway
  in endothelial cells. Interaction of CD40L with CD40 on the surface of endothelial
  cells results in activation of the Ras signaling pathway. Ras associates with PI3
  to induce the expression of VEGF, which in turn stimulates angiogenesis. Platelets
  are likely to be a major, but not unique, source of CD40L (see The two faces of
  CD40). (B) Platelets induce neoangiogenesis. Activation of platelets causes them
  to release a soluble form of CD40L, which can bind CD40 on the surface of endothelial
  cells. Stimulation of CD40 on endothelial cells activates them and, in a tumor,
  leads to neovascularization of the tumor. The antiplatelet drug Clopidogrel blocks
  CD40L secretion by platelets and thereby inhibits neovascularization.
