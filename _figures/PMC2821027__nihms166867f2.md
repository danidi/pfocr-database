caption: a. Other than general functions of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP),
  adipocyte FABP (A-FABP; FABP4) interacts with hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) to
  potentially modulate its catalytic activity and integrates several signalling networks
  that control inflammatory responses potentially through JNK/inhibitor of kappa kinase
  (IKK) and insulin action in the adipocyte. In addition to regulating fatty-acid
  influx, A-FABP is also important in controlling adipocyte lipid hormone production
  to regulate distant targets. The transcriptional events resulting from these actions
  are not fully understood. b. In the macrophage, A-FABP regulates inflammatory responses
  via the IKK-nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and attenuates cholesterol efflux
  through inhibition of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)-liver
  X receptor-α (LXR-α)-ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) pathway. In both macrophages
  and adipocytes, A-FABP has a critical role in integrating lipid signals to organelle
  responses, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). AP1, adaptor protein
  1; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; TNF, tumour
  necrosis factor.
