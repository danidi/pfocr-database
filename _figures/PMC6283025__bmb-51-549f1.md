caption: Mitochondrial proteins, functions and dynamics. (A) Major function of mitochondria
  is energy production through OXPHOS. Glycolysis occurring in the cytosol produce
  pyruvate, which is necessary to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) is a shunt for glycolysis. Through the PPP, cells acquire
  required components for other cellular processes including nucleotide synthesis.
  In mitochondria, beta-oxidation occurs as the other mechanism of converting lipid
  to generate energy. (B) Most proteins localized in the mitochondria are produced
  from the nuclear genome (nDNA) and transported into mitochondria. Mitochondria contain
  its own genome (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA) and produce 13 proteins comprising oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex. (C) Dynamically changing morphology of mitochondria
  through continuous cycle of fusion and fission.
