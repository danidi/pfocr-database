caption: Schematic drawing showing proposed mechanisms of action of Curcuma longa
  (curcumin). Curcumin action reversing mechanisms in AD. In stage A curcumin binds
  beta amyloid plaques significantly reducing their formation and avoiding the hyperphosphorylation
  of the tau protein, avoiding the toxicity and cellular stress, then the dendrites
  of the neurons remain branched and there is a decrease in the production of ROS
  and free radicals by electron mismatching. In step B, curcumin prevents mitochondrial
  dysfunction as it acts by enhancing the action of enzymes of the antioxidant defense
  system SOD, catalase and GSH that converts the hydrogen peroxide to H2O and O2 avoiding
  lipid peroxidation. In step C, curcumin works by inhibiting the apoptotic pathway,
  represented succinctly as these were evaluated in the reviewed studies, so curcumin
  is seen to reduce BAX channel activation, which accelerates programmed cell death
  and increases Bcl-2 regulation, and is repressive of apoptosis. In addition curcumin
  prevents hyperactivation of Apaf-1 and subsequent activation of procaspases that
  activate effector caspase 3. In D curcumin prevented hyperexcitation caused by excessive
  intracellular Ca+2 influx, inhibiting the formation of B-amyloid by APP and avoiding
  the deregulation of the MAPK and AKT pathways, reducing hyperexcitation. Stage E
  shows significantly reduced glial hyperactivation in the hippocampus, reducing neuroinflammation.
