caption: Ubiquitination of RIP1 is an early pro-survival checkpoint in TNF signaling.
  TNFR1 ligation triggers formation of a complex of TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, cIAP1 and
  cIAP2 and the latter three enzymes catalyse the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin
  chains on lysine 377 of RIP1. The K63-linked polyubiquitin chains form a docking
  site for proteins that contain a ubiquitin recognition motif such as TAB2, TAB3
  and NEMO. These adaptor proteins recruit and activate the TAK1 and IKK complexes,
  which lead to phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Formation of this complex
  on the ubiquitinated RIP1 prevents RIP1 from interacting with Caspase 8 and activating
  the apoptotic machinery. If the lysine 377 ubiquitin acceptor site of RIP1 is mutated
  or the E3 ligase enzymes cIAP1 and cIAP2 are degraded by treatment with SMAC mimetic
  or through TNFR2 ligation, non-ubiquitinated RIP1 rapidly forms a complex with Caspase
  8 and turns on the apoptotic machinery. RIP1 and RIP3 are themselves substrates
  for Caspase 8, which may prevent them from triggering the alternate death pathway
  of programmed necrosis. If the activity of Caspase 8 is inhibited, RIP1 forms a
  complex with RIP3 and triggers cell death by necrosis, which is dependent on the
  kinase activity of RIP1 and RIP3. While binding of NEMO to ubiquitinated RIP1 is
  an important factor in this early pro-survival event, it remains unclear what contribution
  the binding of TAB2 and TAB3 or other proteins with a ubiquitin recognition domain
  might make in this pro-survival step. Similarly, it remains to be seen whether the
  TAK1 and IKK kinase complexes participate in a transcription-independent manner
  in this early pro-survival checkpoint, prior to long-term anti-death gene expression
  programs coming into effect.
