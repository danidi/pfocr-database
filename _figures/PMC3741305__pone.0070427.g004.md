caption: The activation of TGF-β pathway triggers Runx3−/−p53−/− GIF-14 gastric epithelial
  cells into EMT, concurrently inducing a stem cell-like and tumorigenic state. The
  data presented in this report show that TGF-β1 induces an EGFR/Ras gene expression
  signature marked by increased Egfr expression, which sensitized GIF-14 cells to
  EGF. The activation of EGFR/Ras pathway promotes stemness and tumorigenicity in
  GIF-14 cells in a MEK1/2-dependent manner that did not involve increased EMT.
