caption: The proposed brassinolide biosynthetic pathway and the quantification of
  endogenous sterols and BRs from bri1-4 (a null allele), bri1-5 (a weaker allele),
  and wild type (Ws-2). Values in top, middle, and bottom represent endogenous levels
  (per gram fresh weight) in bri1-4, bri1-5, and the wild type, respectively. Most
  of the data for the wild type have been already published (). Data quantifying teasterone
  were not available in our previous study because of low recovery. In this study,
  we repeated the analysis using the same plant materials. Endogenous teasterone was
  not detected, while recovery of the internal standard ([2H6]teasterone) was very
  good.
