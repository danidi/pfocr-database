caption: An example of activating crosstalk. (A) The Notch signaling pathway. When
  the Delta ligand binds to Notch, the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is cleaved
  and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to CSL. The NICD:CSL complex controls
  the transcription of developmental genes. (B) The TGF-β signaling pathway. The binding
  of TGF-β to its receptor results in the heterodimerization of SMAD3 and SMAD4 and
  the subsequent phosphorylation and translocation of the complex to the nucleus.
  Here, this complex regulates the transcription of genes involved in differentiation.
  (C) Crosstalk from the Notch signaling pathway to the TGF-β signaling pathway occurs
  when NICD binds to SMAD3 to further promote complex formation between SMAD3 and
  SMAD4. After crosstalk, the transcriptional complex includes NICD (not shown in
  the figure).
