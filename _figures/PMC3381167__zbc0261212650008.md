caption: A proposed model for hYAP regulation in response to SN2 alkylating agents.
  Cell-cell contact triggers Hippo pathway signaling that up-regulates Ser-127 phosphorylation
  of hYAP and thus its cytoplasmic retention via binding to 14-3-3 protein. SN2 alkylating
  agents damage DNA, leading to a reduction in Ser-127 phosphorylation of hYAP. Non-phosphorylated
  hYAP is released from the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 complex and translocates into the nucleus.
  Within the nucleus, CBP and/or p300 activated by SN2 alkylating agent-mediated DNA
  damage induce hYAP acetylation at Lys-494 and Lys-497. Concurrently, deacetylation
  of these residues is mediated by SIRT1. Thus, tight regulation governs the state
  of hYAP acetylation induced in response to SN2 alkylating agents.
