caption: 'The left part of the diagram (in blue) depicts the mechanism of CICR, in
  which an action potential activates the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel, leading
  to a small Ca2+ influx. This Ca2+ entry opens the RyR2 channel in the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum (SR), resulting in SR Ca2+ release and muscle contraction. The right part
  of the diagram (in red) denotes the mechanism of SOICR, in which spontaneous SR
  Ca2+ release or Ca2+ spillover occurs under conditions of SR Ca2+ overload caused,
  for example, by stress via the beta-adrenergic receptor (b-AR)/protein kinase A
  (PKA)/phospholamban (PLB) signaling pathway. SOICR can activate the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
  (Na/CaX), which, in turn, can lead to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered
  activities. (Illustration Credit: Cosmocyte/Ben Smith).'
