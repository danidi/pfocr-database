caption: 'Schematic pathway for mcl-PHA biosynthesis consisting of odd-chain and even-chain
  monomers. Genes overexpressed or deleted and metabolic intermediates in the recombinant
  E. coli are marked. After every cycle, two carbons were added to the initial acyl-CoA
  thioester (indicated as Cn + 2) was generated. Dashed lines indicate multiple steps.
  Dashed lines without arrowheads connect acyl-CoA intermediates of different chain
  length. Genes in bold were expressed to obtain mcl-PHAs from the reversed β-oxidation
  cycle. Marked genes: ptsG, glucose-specific PTS permease, IIBC component; poxB:
  pyruvate oxidase; pflB: pyruvate formate-lyase; yqeF, thiolase; fadB, hydroxyacyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase; ter, trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase from T. denticola;
  phaJ1Pa, (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase from P. aeruginosa PAO1; phaC2Pa, polyhydroxyalkanoic
  acid synthase from P. aeruginosa PAO1; tesB/yciA, thioesterase; prpP, propionate
  permease; acs, acetyl-CoA synthase; prpE, propionyl-CoA synthase; pct, propionate-CoA
  transferase. The left yellow dotted box indicates the even-chain precursor (acetyl-CoA)
  supply module. Purple arrows indicate the odd-chain precursor (propionyl-CoA) supply
  module in the right yellow dotted box. Blue arrows indicate the reversed β-oxidation
  cycle module'
