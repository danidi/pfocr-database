caption: 'Detoxification of methylglyoxal formed spontaneously from glycolysis or
  Calvin cycle during stress by glyoxalase pathway involving Glyoxalases I (Gly I)
  and II (Gly II) to help reduce glutathione (GSH). A novel Glyoxalase III (Gly III)
  enzyme catalyzing a single step reaction was recently discovered. AGEs: advanced
  glycation end-product residues; GSH: glutathione; ROS: reactive oxygen species.
  Methylglyoxal is also referred to as pyruvaldehyde or 2-oxopropanal'
