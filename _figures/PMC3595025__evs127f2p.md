caption: 'Schematic representation of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Based
  on information from , , ,  and . The different metal chelatases are represented
  in bold and colored according to their sequence and/or structural similarity. The
  numbers correspond to the different steps of the common core of (bacterio)chlorophyll
  pathway. UroIII, the last common intermediate of all tetrapyrroles, can either be
  methylated by CysG (or CobA) to form precorrin-2 or suffer decarboxylation and oxidation
  to form Protoporphyrin IX via the O2-dependent route (HemE, HemF, HemY) or the O2-independent
  route (HemE, HemG, HemN). Precorrin-2 is the branching point for F430 (a Ni2+-containing
  tetrapyrrole), the cobalamin O2-dependent route, and Sirohydrochlorin. Iron can
  be inserted into Sirohydrochlorin by SirB or by multifunctional oxidases such as
  Met8p or CysG to form siroheme. Siroheme can be further modified to form heme d1
  or heme, according to the alternative archaeal heme synthesis pathway. Protoporphyrin
  IX is the branch point to hemes and chlorophylls. Iron is inserted into protoporphyrin
  IX (classical pathway). (A) Specific (bacterio)chlorophyll steps: the incorporation
  of Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX occurs by the action of (B)ChlHID complex (step 1),
  resulting in the formation of Mg-protoporphyrin. A methyl transferase (B)ChlM subsequently
  converts Mg-protoporphyrin into Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (step 2),
  which is the substrate for a cyclase reaction, involving water (B)ChlE (step 3)
  or molecular oxygen (AcsF, step 4). The cyclase forms divinyl protochlorophyllide
  a, an intermediate that contains a fifth ring (ring E), characteristic of all (bacterio)chlorophylls.
  The next reaction consists in the reduction of the 8-vinyl group by an 8-vinyl reductase,
  BciA (step 5) or BciB (step 6). Finally, the reduction of the IV pyrrole ring of
  protochlorophyllide to form chlorophyllide is performed by the action of the light-dependent
  LPOR (step 7) or the light-independent (DPOR) complex formed by (B)Chl LNB. (B)
  Alternative pathways for cobalamin synthesis. In the O2-independent cobalamin pathway,
  cobalt is inserted into Sirohydrochlorin to form the Co-Sirohydrochlorin intermediate,
  via one of the three homologous chelatases CibK, CibXS, or CibXL, homologs to the
  SirB chelatase and the HemH chelatase from the classical heme pathway. Co-Sirohydrochlorin
  is then sequential converted into Cob(II)yrinate a,c diamide by the action of 10
  enzymes (Cbi LHFGDJETCA). In the O2-dependent pathway, CobI performs the methylation
  of precorrin-2 originating precorrin-3A that will be oxidized by one of the two
  O2-dependente enzymes (CobZ or CobG) originating precorrin-3B. A series of reactions
  involving cob JMFKLHB genes occur until hydrogenobyrinate a,c diamide is formed.
  At this stage, Co2+ ion is inserted into the ring by the CobNST (homologous to BChl
  HID chelatase from the (bacterio)chlorophyll pathway) forming Cob(II)yrinate a,c
  diamide, the merger point between the two cobalamin pathways.'
