caption: Mechanisms of myeloma-mediated bone destruction. The cartoon depicts a myeloma
  lesion and the events that occur, leading to formation of an osteolytic lesion.
  (1) Myeloma cells secrete DKK1 and FRP2 that inhibit Wnt pathway signaling, thus
  blocking osteoblastogenesis. (2) RANKL (blue triangles) expression on the surface
  of osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells is elevated, and expression of OPG
  (orange circles) is suppressed. In addition, OPG binds to syndecan-1 on the surface
  of myeloma cells and is internalized and degraded further shifting the balance toward
  osteoclastogenesis. (3) Myeloma cells express high levels of either cell surface
  or soluble RANKL. (4) The high levels of RANKL in the lesion lead to hyperstimulation
  of myeloid precursor differentiation into osteoclasts. Once mature, the osteoclasts
  degrade bone and release factors (green triangles) that stimulate myeloma growth.
  The net effect of these processes is extensive loss of bone at sites of myeloma
  foci leading to radiologically identifiable osteolytic lesions as shown in the X-ray
  on the right (arrow points to lesion).
