caption: Our previous work suggests that Pam-3-cys, which signals DCs through TLR2,
  induces robust IL-10 and IL-6 but little IL-12(p70) (13, 14). Induction of IL-10
  and impaired IL-12(p70) production appear to be critically regulated by ERK activation,
  which results in the phosphorylation and stabilization of c-Fos, a repressor of
  IL-12 (13, 14). Such a DC cytokine profile appears to bias toward the Th2 pathway.
  In the present paper, we demonstrate that zymosan signals to DCs via both TLR2 and
  dectin-1, inducing the expression of abundant IL-10 but little IL-12(p70) or IL-6.
  Unlike the case with Pam-3-cys, impairment of IL-12(p70) and induction of c-Fos
  are not dependent on c-Fos. Induction of IL-10 represses the induction of proinflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-12, IL-6, and TNF-α. In addition to these effects on DCs,
  zymosan also induces biologically active TGF-β in macrophages. In this case, the
  robust induction of IL-10 and TGF-β coupled with impaired induction of IL-6 and
  IL-12(p70) appears to induce immunological tolerance.
