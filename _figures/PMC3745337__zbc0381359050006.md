caption: Simplified hypothetical model of signaling leading to P450c17 phosphorylation.
  We suggest that hormones and other factors activate an intracellular pathway that
  may include ROCK1, eventually leading to an M3K; the number of steps involved and
  potential sites of cross-talk remain undetermined. An activated M3K would activate
  a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, such as MKK3, -4, or -6, which would
  then activate p38α, permitting phosphorylation of P450c17 and the acquisition of
  17,20 lyase activity. P450c17 is dephosphorylated by PP2A, which in turn can be
  inhibited by the phosphoprotein SET. Potential cross-talk with other second messenger
  pathways is not shown. Steps that have been established experimentally are shown
  with closed arrowheads, and hypothetical steps are shown with open arrowheads.
