caption: During wound healing, activation of the Periostin signaling circuitry is
  initiated by the extracellular accumulation of Periostin secreted by fibroblasts,
  and by intracellular periostin originated after mechanical stress. Following, activation
  of the mTOR pathway occurs. Notably, the mTORC1 is required for Periostin-driven
  accelerated epithelial migration, while activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is required
  for epithelial proliferation.
