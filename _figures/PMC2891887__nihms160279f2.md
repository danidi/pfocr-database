caption: 'Panel 1: Inflammation, hypoxia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) up-regulate
  expression of pro-lymphangiogenic factors VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGF-A produced by
  both tumor neoplastic and tumor-associated stromal cells (e.g. macrophages and fibroblasts).
  Panel 2: New lymphatic vessels are formed mainly in the peritumoral region but in
  some cases also intratumorally. The formation of new lymphatic vessels involves
  activation of VEGFR-3 by VEGF-C/-D and VEGFR-2 by VEGF-A as well as mature forms
  of VEGF-C/-D. Following, LEC proliferate, migrate and assemble into new vessels.
  The process may include incorporation of tumor-recruited circulating LEC progenitor
  cells. Panel 3: Tumor cells might actively invade intratumoral or peritumoral lymphatic
  vessels, or might be passively encapsulated by lymphatic vessels. Both types of
  interactions promote LVI leading to lymphatic metastasis to the sentinel lymph node.
  The active metastasis includes chemotactic recruitment of tumor cells expressing
  CCR7 or CXCR4 receptors by corresponding chemokines (CCL21 and SDF-1) expressed
  by the local lymphatic system. Panel 4: Unknown tumor-secreted factors that may
  include, but not limited to VEGF-A and VEGF-C, elicit profound morphological changes
  in the sentinel LN culminating in lymph node lymphangiogenesis (LNL) and lymphatic
  hypertrophy. Dramatically increased lymph flow in and out of the sLN promotes both
  lymphatic metastasis and further dissemination to distant organs. Panel 5: The pathway
  to distant organs may occur through both blood and lymphatic vasculature. Following
  dissemination through lymphatic vessels to the sentinel LN, tumor cells may enter
  the blood circulation through nodal blood vessels, or proceed with the lymphatic
  flow and enter the venous circulation via the thoracic duct, both pathways leading
  to distant organ metastasis.'
