caption: A typical PDA cell is depicted showing schematics of representative metabolic
  pathways that are altered in the disease in response to oncogenic Kras. Enzymes
  whose expression is increased by Kras are indicated with an asterisk. Increased
  glucose uptake fuels glycolysis (leading to increased lactate production), anabolic
  pathways such as the non-oxidative arm of the PPP (producing ribose for nucleotide
  biosynthesis) and the HBP (producing precursors for glycosylation). Glutamine is
  a key metabolite that is utilized to fuel the TCA cycle and maintains redox homeostasis
  in PDA through a novel pathway (shown in orange) that leads to NADPH production.
  PDA are efficient metabolic scavengers and use autophagy (intracellular) and macropinocytosis
  (extracellular) to provide metabolic substrates through cargo degradation via the
  lysosome. Lipids are also taken up extracellularly to provide fatty acids. HK1/2,
  hexokinase 1 and 2; PFK1, phosphofructokinase 1; ME1, malic enzyme; GOT1/GOT2, aspartate
  aminotransferase 1 and 2; MDH1, malate dehydrogenase; GLS, glutaminase; GFPT1, glutamine
