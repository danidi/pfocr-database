caption: a Gene activity prior to vernalisation (winter wheat). b Gene activity in
  response to vernalisation. c Gene activity in response to vernalisation and long
  days, associated with transition to flowering. d Black arrows depict gene action,
  colour (grey vs. green) illustrates gene expression state (inactive vs. active)
  and circular arrows represent the feedback loop.
