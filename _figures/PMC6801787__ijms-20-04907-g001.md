caption: 'Schematic illustration vitamin D synthesis pathway and signalling mechanisms
  relevant to PAD formation. The main forms of vitamin D in nature are vitamin D3
  (cholecalciferol) that is synthesized in the skin of animals and humans in response
  to sunlight and obtained through diet. The vitamin D3 travels in the circulation
  bound to DBP. Vitamin D must undergo several hydroxylation steps to become an active
  metabolite. The synthetic pathway involves 25- and 1-alpha-hydroxylation of vitamin
  D3 and D2, in the liver and kidney, respectively. The first hydroxylation occurs
  in the liver resulting in the formation of 25(OH)D3 or calcidiol and the second
  hydroxylation occurs mainly within the kidneys and intestinal epithelial cells and
  immune cells and generates the most biologically active hormonal form of vitamin
  D: 1, 25(OH)2D, or calcitriol. The biologically active form of vitamin D3 is involved
  in the regulation of numerous cell cycle regulatory mechanisms protecting the vasculature
  from pathological conditions. Abbreviations: Ca2+, calcium; DBP, vitamin D binding
  protein; PAD, peripheral arterial disease; Vit D3, vitamin D3.'
