caption: 'Effect of statin on the mevalonate pathway. Statin interrupts the enzymatic
  reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate by inhibiting the activity of HMGCR. The interruption
  inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids such as farnesyl-PP and geranylgeranyl-PP

  transitions in the mevalonate pathway'
