caption: A working model of the function of ephrin-B–RGS pathway. Our results indicate
  that the RGS-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling pathway is required for the maintenance
  of neural progenitor cells. As the RGS domain acts as an inhibitor of Gα subunit
  signaling, our data suggest that Gα subunit may function as an activator of progenitor
  differentiation. Future studies are required to investigate this potential role
  of Gα subunit. In addition, whether and how EphB functions in the activation of
  ephrin-B–RGS pathway in neural progenitor cells will also need to be further studied.
