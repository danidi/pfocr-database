caption: The origins of Etn moieties in plant phospholipids. Dotted arrows show the  Kennedy
  pathway, which proceeds from Etn to PtdEtn via phospho and CDP  derivatives of Etn.
  CDP-DAG, CDP diacylglycerol; CMP, cytidine  5′-phosphate; P, phospho; Ptd, phosphatidyl;
  SDC, Ser decarboxylase;  PSD, Ptd-Ser decarboxylase; PSS, Ptd-Ser synthase; BE,
  base exchange. Note  that when PSD and base exchange act together, they constitute
  a cycle.
