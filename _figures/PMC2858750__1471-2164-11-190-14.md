caption: 'Changes in gene expression in flavonoid biosynthesis of the glu1-2 mutant.
  Simplified schematic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the
  genes showing different expression levels in glu1-2 leaves and root. Gene IDs indicated
  in blue are upregulated whereas those indicated in red are downregulated. Enzymes:
  (1) phenylalanineammonia lyase (PAL), (2) cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, (3) 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase, (4) chalcone synthase, (5) chalcone isomerase, (6) flavanone 3-hydroxylase,
  (7) flavonoid 3''-hydroxylase, (8) flavonol synthase, (9) flavonol glycosyltransferase.
  The figure is based on []. The detailed data of the genes depicted in this figure
  are presented in Additional file .'
