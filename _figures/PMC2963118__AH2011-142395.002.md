caption: The HRS cell and its cellular microenvironment. Significant interactions
  with impact in patients outcome are depicted. Increased Galectin1 and IL-10 secreted
  by HRS (Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg) cells lead to decreased TCL (T cytotoxic) and
  Th1 responses, together with a Treg increase which, in turn, suppresses both Th2
  and PD1+ T cell activity [–]. PD1+CD4+ T cell activity is additionally suppressed
  by direct interations trough PD1-PD1L immunological synapse (T cell exhaustion)
  []. This leads to a decreased IFNγ production. Additionally, increased TAM (Tumor
  Associated Macrophages) contribute to T cell deletion trough STAT1 signaling pathway
  [, ].
