caption: 'Bradykinin effect on TJs: bradykinin (BK), interacting with its receptors
  B1R and B2R, induces the intracellular release of Ca2+ that can affect occludin
  polymerization as well as increase the production of nitric oxide that relaxes the
  junctions. The activation of this pathway is also associated with a decrease in
  TJ mRNA expression.'
