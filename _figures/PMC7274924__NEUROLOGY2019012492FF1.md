caption: The portion of the figure in the green box represents the direct pathway
  (promotes movement) and the section in the blue box represents the indirect pathway
  (inhibits movement). In Huntington disease, it is the indirect pathway that degenerates
  first, leading to lack of inhibition and involuntary movements (chorea). The cerebellum
  is integrated into striatal circuity through the indirect pathway. Thus the cerebellum
  could compensate for a faulty indirect pathway, restoring balance and preventing
  the development of involuntary movements. Red arrows indicate where the cerebellum
  is integrated into the indirect pathway. GPe = globus pallidus externa; GPi = globus
  pallidus interna; STN = subthalamic nucleus. Figure adapted from .
