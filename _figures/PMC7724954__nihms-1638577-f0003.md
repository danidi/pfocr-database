caption: Caspofungin-induced CWD regulation by Rlm1. Following caspofungin-induced
  CWD, Rlm1 is activated via an unknown regulatory pathway. In the nucleus, Rlm1 activates
  transcription of Rlm1-dependent genes. The C. albicans Rlm1 DNA-binding consensus
  motif is depicted in the inset. Rlm1-dependent gene activation leads to the upregulation
  of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis/integrity,macromolecular localization
  and secretion, and organelle localization. Rlm1 also indirectly activates Sko1 signaling.
  Dotted arrows represent unknown or hypothetical processes, while solid arrows indicate
  confirmed relationships and processes. This figure was adapted from  and created
  with BioRender.com
