caption: Fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation is increased in nitrate treated primary
  white adipocytes characteristic of the browning response. (A) 13C-enrichment of
  palmitate (C16:0) was significantly increased in nitrate treated adipocytes (One-way
  ANOVA, P ≤ 0.01). (B) 13C-enrichment of myristate (C14:0) was significantly increased
  in nitrate treated adipocytes (One-way ANOVA, P ≤ 0.05). (C) 13C-enrichment of laurate
  (C12:0) was significantly increased in nitrate treated adipocytes (One-way ANOVA,
  P ≤ 0.05). (D) 13C-enrichment of citrate was significantly increased in nitrate
  treated adipocytes (Two-way ANOVA, P ≤ 0.0001, Control vs. 50 μM NaNO3 P ≤ 0.0001,
  Control vs. 500 μM NaNO3 P ≤ 0.001) (E) 13C-enrichment of succinate was significantly
  increased in nitrate treated adipocytes (Two-way ANOVA, P ≤ 0.05, Control vs. 500
  μM NaNO3 P ≤ 0.05). (F) 13C-enrichment of malate was significantly increased in
  nitrate treated adipocytes (Two-way ANOVA, P ≤ 0.05, Control vs. 500 μM NaNO3 P
  ≤ 0.05). Red highlighting indicates increased enrichment. Cumulative data from a
  total of 4 independent observations are shown. Data are represented as Mean ± SEM.
