caption: Schematic representation of homocysteine metabolism and intersection with
  glutathione (GSH) production and folate cycle. Methionine derived from protein degradation
  is converted into homocysteine by the methylation cycle. Homocysteine is then converted
  into cysteine by the transsulfuration pathway, providing the substrate for GSH synthesis.
  The synthesis and catabolism of GSH occurs by a regulated series of enzymatic and
  membrane transport steps that are collectively referred to as the glutathione cycle.
  Folate (THF) cycle is also reported.
