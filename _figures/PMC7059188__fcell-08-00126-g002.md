caption: Soluble factor-activated signaling pathways in fibroblastic cells in CNT-exposed
  mouse lungs. Certain pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediator-regulated signaling
  pathways, including the canonical NF-κB pathway, the canonical, Smad-dependent TGF-β
  pathway, and the ERK signaling, have been reported to be activated in fibroblastic
  cells in CNT-exposed lungs. These pathways exert crucial functions in promoting
  the development of fibrosis induced by CNTs. They demonstrate the activities and
  roles of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, as well as the connections between immune
  factors and fibrosis development, in the lung under CNT exposure.
