caption: 'A simplified network for the canonical NF-κB pathway consisting of active
  IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB are represented in a navigational map (A) and in a schematic
  diagram (B). Many upsteam signals (factors like Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, Interleukin-1,
  and Lipopolysaccharide, or cell surface receptor signaling from T cell/B cell receptors)
  induce the kinase activity of IKK. Phosphorylation of two specific serines in IκBα
  by IKK initiates the degradation of IκBα by the proteasome. Free NF-κB then translocates
  to the nucleus and activates IκBα gene transcription. Newly synthesized IκBα binds
  to NF-κB in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. Numerous molecular mechanisms down-regulate
  the post-stimulus kinase activity of IKK. IKKO indicates an inactive form without
  catalytic activity. NF-κBnuc represents the nuclear species. NF-κB itself exists
  most predominantly as a heterodimer of p65 (transcriptionally active) and p50 subunits.
  Symbols were used in the navigational map (A) according to the WIRE guideline: Briefly,
  a circle indicates a protein molecule. Boxed circles are protein complexes. A ‘+’
  sign in an arrow represents a positive (activating) effect.'
