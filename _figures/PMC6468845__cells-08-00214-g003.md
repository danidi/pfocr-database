caption: Reprogramming of lipid metabolism under hypoxia. Hypoxia enhances lipogenesis
  by HIF-dependent modulation of proteins involved in fatty acid (FA) uptake, synthesis,
  storage and usage. Uptake of extracellular FA is promoted under hypoxia by activation
  of the transcription factor PPARγ and the increased expression of FABPs 3, 4 and
  7. Endocytosis of lipoproteins is enhanced by the upregulation of LRP1 and VLDLR,
  while ceramide levels are increased by upregulation of NEU3. To maintain de novo
  FA synthesis under hypoxia, preservation of citrate levels and synthesis of acetyl-CoA
  is achieved by stimulation of reductive glutamine metabolism, mediated, at least
  in part, by induction of GLS1 and proteolysis of the OGDH2 subunit of the α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase complex (αKGDH) by SIAH2. Adequate FA supply is further supported
  by activation of SREBP-1, which in turn upregulates the expression of FASN. To avoid
  lipotoxicity and/or replete lipid stores, FAs are converted to neutral triacylglycerols
  (TAGs), which are stored in lipid droplets (LDs). Formation of LDs under hypoxia
  is favored by the upregulation of the TAG biosynthesis pathway enzymes AGPAT2 and
  lipin-1, and the LD membrane proteins PLIN2 and HIG2. Finally, lipid accumulation
  under hypoxia is additionally supported by the inhibition of β-oxidation through
  downregulation of PGC-1α, CPT1A, PGC-1β, MCAD and LCAD. The proteins upregulated
  or activated under hypoxia are shown in red and the proteins downregulated or inhibited
  under hypoxia are shown in green. See text for details and references.
