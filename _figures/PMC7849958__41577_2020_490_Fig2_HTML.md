caption: a | Changes in lipid and glucose metabolism that occur in myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs) and in tumour cells in the tumour environment are shown.
  MDSCs in the tumour microenvironment show an upregulation of fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) and glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). They
  also show increased lipid accumulation and increased production of the metabolites
  methylglyoxal, arginine, tryptophan and cysteine. Key changes in the tumour microenvironment
  are depicted in the yellow boxes. b | Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the
  unfolded protein response (UPR) in MDSCs. The UPR is characterized by an orchestrated
  upregulation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol requiring enzyme
  1 (IRE1α) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). The transcription factor
  C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) is a critical mediator of the PERK pathway, whereas
  spliced X-box binding protein 1 (sXBP1) is a mediator of the IRE1α pathway. ER stress
  induced the expression of TNF-related apoptosis-induced ligand receptors (DR5) and
  lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1) and the conversion of neutrophils to
  polymorphonuclear MDSCs. The reduced NRF2 signalling favoured the accumulation of
  cytosolic mitochondrial DNA and consequent expression of antitumour type I interferon,
  in a STING-dependent manner.
