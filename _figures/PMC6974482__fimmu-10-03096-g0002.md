caption: The integrated role of IL-17 in the cytokine- and inflammation-related regulatory
  network of insulin signaling. In general, inflammation reduces insulin sensitivity
  and insulin receptor signaling via IRS-1 by a myriad of different mediators. Cellular
  glucose disposal needs glucose transport via specific glucose transporters such
  as GLUT4 in adipose tissue and in striated muscle. Activation of the NFκB and the
  JNK pathway via different lipids and cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17 (but also
  TNF, IL-1, and others) decrease insulin signaling. Lipids and cytokines are known
  to activate certain types of kinases that cause an inhibitory phosphorylation of
  IRS-1. Phosphorylation takes place at the wrong sites leading to less effective
  insulin signaling. Stress pathways such as hypoxia, ROS, ER activation, lipids,
  fatty acids, and cytokines are all integrated with insulin signaling via inhibitory
  mechanisms by JNK activation. Taken together, inflammation and stress always induce
  insulin resistance by common mechanisms. JNK represents the central kinase connecting
  stress and inflammation with insulin signaling. ACT1, nuclear factor-kappa-B activator;
  AKT, protein kinase AKT; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Glut4, glucose transporter-4;
