  NF‐kB contributes to the expression and activity of HIF‐1α together with ROS, including
  XOR‐derived ROS . Peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPAR)‐γ is a
  ligand‐activated intracellular transcription factor, included in the nuclear hormone

  mammary epithelium of mice, XOR expression is essential to maintain lactation ,
  possibly because XOR regulates the binding of fat droplets to the apical cell membrane
  and their secretion . Pluristratified epithelium orthokeratinization was associated
  to XOR expression and conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) to xanthine oxidase
  (XO) in ovariectomized mice after hormonal induction of vaginal epithelium hyperplasia,
  suggesting that XOR activity is required for the orthokeratinization pathway of
  differentiation . Adipogenesis is controlled by a cascade of factors that includes
  XOR as a regulator of the adipogenic process. Indeed, in vivo the level of XOR expression
  correlates with fat accumulation in mice and XOR activity was linked to the adipogenic
  transcription factor PPAR‐γ . Epithelial to mesenchymal transition was observed
  in primary renal epithelial cells from XOR−/− mice . Not only the cell morphology
  changed from a cuboidal to a myofibroblastic shape, but also immunohistochemical
  analysis showed a positive staining for markers of mesenchymal cell type, suggesting
  that XOR expression is needed for epithelial differentiation in mouse kidney. Migratory
  capacity in vitro was inversely correlated with XOR expression in epithelial cell
  lines derived from breast cancer .
