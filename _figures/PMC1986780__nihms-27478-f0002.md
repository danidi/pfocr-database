caption: Role of XIAP in the extrinsic and intrinsic cell death signaling pathways.
  Two different pathways can initiate apoptosis. The death-receptor mediated (extrinsic)
  pathway involves the activation of caspase-8 following stimulation of the receptor
  by ligands such as Fas. The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway is initiated by a
  variety of stimuli including DNA damaging agents such as UV and chemotherapy resulting
  in the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of caspase-9.
  Both pathways converge to activate caspases- 3 and -7, effector caspases responsible
  for the death of the cell. XIAP regulates both pathways by its ability to directly
  bind and inhibit caspase-3, -7 and -9. The mitochondrial proteins, Smac and Omi,
  antagonize the caspase inhibitory properties of XIAP.
