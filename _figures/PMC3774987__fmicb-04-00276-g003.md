caption: Essential TLR-associated signaling pathways and cytokine production. Upon
  ligand stimulation, all TLRs, except TLR3, recruit the adaptor MyD88. In turn, MyD88
  binds to a protein complex composed of IRAK4, IRAK1, and TRAF6. TRAF6 undergoes
  self-polyubiquitination resulting in the phosphorylation of TAK1. In turn, TAK1
  activates IKK complex that leads to the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation
  of IκBα. This allows NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus. Simultaneously, the
  TAK1-containing complex activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway triggering the activation
  of AP-1. Together, NF-κB and AP-1 induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  TLR4 and TLR2, in combination with TLR1 or TLR6, recruit TIRAP that serves as a
  link adaptor for the recruitment of MyD88. Moreover, TLR4 recruits a second link
  adaptor namedTRAM that allows interaction with the adaptor TRIF. Upon stimulation
  with an agonist, TLR3 recruits TRIF. TRIF-mediated activation of NF-κB and AP-1
  also occurs through a TRAF6-dependent pathway. Upon stimulation, TRIF also binds
  TRAF3, which activates TBK. TBK phosphorylates IRF3 and permits its homodimerization
  and nuclear translocation. IRF-3, along with NF-κB and AP-1, cooperate to induce
  the expression of type I IFNs. AP-1, activator protein-1; CBP, cyclic AMP response

    Upon ligand stimulation, all TLRs, except TLR3, recruit the adaptor MyD88. In

    undergoes self-polyubiquitination resulting in the phosphorylation of TAK1. In
