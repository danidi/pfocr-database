caption: Regulatory network of flavonoid biosynthesis after flooding stress in bud
  and flower bloom stages. (A) The synthesis pathway of flavonoids metabolites. The
  left half of the rectangle represents the change of metabolites in the BS, and the
  right half represents the change of metabolites in the FBS. Blue means no change
  of metabolites, red means increase, and white means not detected. (B) The fold change
  of key enzyme genes after flooding stress in two stages. CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, flavanone 4-reductase; FNS, flavone synthase; ANS,
  anthocyanidin synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; GT, glycosyltransferase.
