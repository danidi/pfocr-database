caption: 'DSBs are required to initiate CSR at S regions, and the MMR pathway plays
  a significant role promoting DSB formation. Similar to SHM, the MutSα heterodimer
  senses the AID-generated U:G mismatch, but here, the coordination of EXO1 nuclease
  activities and the MutLα heterodimer composed of MLH1 and PMS2, relays the MMR signaling
  cascade to favor the formation of DSBs. While Polη does not play a major role during
  CSR, PCNA ubiquitylation has been shown to be important for efficient CSR, therefore
  suggesting additional role(s). Once the break is produced, canonical DSB sensors
  like 53BP1, the ubiquitin ligases RNF8/RNF168 and the phosphorylated form of H2AX
  (γH2AX) ensure the initiation of recombination and ligation of the S junctions through
  non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mechanisms. At this stage, MMR scaffolding functions
  and yet unknown regulating signals fine tune processing of the S-S junctions, balancing
  the use of two seemingly distinct versions of NHEJ: the canonical pathway and the
  alternative pathway.'
