caption: A model for the role of the Wnt-Sox2 pathway in the transition from a  progenitor
  to a differentiated cell. (A) Wnt signaling activation  in a neuroepithelial cell
  activates Sox2 and the proneural genes, but through  Sox2 and Notch it blocks proneural
  activity and neuronal differentiation. Wnt  also independently maintains proliferation,
  and this leads to progenitor  maintenance and expansion. (B) The build-up of Sox2
  switches off Wnt,  inhibiting proliferation (B1), and then the accumulation of proneural
  activity  switches off Sox2, relieving the inhibition of neuronal differentiation
  and  leading to neurogenesis (B2). (C) Alternatively, if Sox2 levels remain  high
  it will limit proneural activity and neuronal differentiation will be  blocked,
  but Wnt signaling will also be inhibited, leading to cell cycle exit  and glial
  differentiation.
