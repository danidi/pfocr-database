caption: Oncogenic activating BRAF mutations (e.g., V600E) in melanoma cells drive
  the rapid and constitutive internalization of MHC-I molecules from the cell surface
  and their subsequent sequestration within LAMP1-positive endolysosomal compartments
  (left). This redistribution process requires the conserved serine-335 phosphorylation
  site (S) found within the cytoplasmic tail of MHC-I. Pharmaceutical inhibition of
  MAPK signaling can inhibit MHC-I internalization, thus altering the equilibrium
  and resulting in reduced endolysosomal sequestration and enhanced MHC-I surface
  expression within hours (right). This augmented MHC-I surface expression in turn
  leads to increased tumor cell recognition and function of melanoma antigen-specific
  CD8+ T cells.
