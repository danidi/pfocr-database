caption: A schematic diagram summarizing the isoform-specific effects of the Numb
  proteins on the activation of the Notch pathway and the regulation of cellular Ca2+-regulating
  systems in PC12 cells under stress conditions. In addition to activation of the
  Notch pathway, trophic factor withdrawal-induced stress promotes an early switch
  in the expression of the alternatively spliced Numb isoforms that differentially
  modulate Notch signaling strength. Whereas the LPTB-Numb isoforms reduce the dwelling
  time of the internalized Notch in Rab5-labeled early endosomes, the SPTB-Numb proteins
  increase the retention of Notch and its processing to NICD in these endocytic compartments.
  Consequently, the stress-induced accumulation of Numb-SPTB promotes NICD-dependent
  transcription of TRPC6, which assembles into native ROCs and SOCs on the plasma
  membrane. Increased Ca2+ entry through these channels leads to the subsequent activation
  of calcineurin in cells expressing the SPTB-Numb isoforms.
