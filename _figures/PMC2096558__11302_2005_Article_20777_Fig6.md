caption: 'Finding alternative Ca2+ entry mechanisms in ductal epithelia afflicted
  with polycystic kidney disease: A possible therapeutic benefit? In both genetic
  forms of PKD, proteins affected by mutation appear to cluster in the apical central
  monocilium in renal collecting duct epithelia and in ductal epithelia from other
  tissues. In mouse and human forms of PKD, this cilium is deficient (either abnormal
  in function or malformed). Apical monocilia have been shown to mediate touch- or
  flow-induced Ca2+ entry. The latter would be a physiological stimulus for the collecting
  duct, where tubular fluid flows over it continually. In the absence of a competent
  monocilium, opening of an alternative Ca2+ entry channel or pathway could recover
  this cilium-specific Ca2+signaling.'
