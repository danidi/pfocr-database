caption: Glycerol-gluconeogenesis is directly interrogated by determining the fraction
  of 13C3 enrichment in blood glucose using NMR spectroscopic quantification of 13C-labeled
  glucose isotopomers. Total 13C enrichment in plasma glucose is measured by the sum
  of all glucose isotopomers with excess 13C. Additional information about specific
  pathways is derived from specific glucose isotopomers. Initially, glycerol is phosphorylated
  in the liver by glycerol kinase and is converted to DHAP and GA3P. Direct production
  of glucose via gluconeogenesis occurs by condensation of DHAP and GA3P to form carbons
  1–3 and 4–6 of glucose, respectively. Therefore, quantification of [1,2,3-13C3]
  glucose and of [4,5,6-13C3] glucose reflects primarily direct hepatic gluconeogenesis
  from ingested [U-13C3] glycerol (black filled circles). Passage of [1,2,3-13C3]
  G6P through the PPP produces [1,2-13C2] F6P and subsequently [1,2-13C2] glucose
  so that the quantification of [1,2-13C2] glucose reflects PPP activity (red filled
  circles). Metabolism of [U-13C3] glycerol to [U-13C3] pyruvate followed by either
  decarboxylation to [U-13C2] acetyl-CoA or carboxylation to [1,2,3-13C3] oxaloacetate
  allows rearrangement of 13C in the TCA cycle to form PEP. Two possible PEP isotopomers
  through glycerol metabolism in the TCA cycle are [1,2-13C2]- and [2,3-13C2] PEP.
  Conversion to PEP and metabolism to glucose will produce [4,5-13C2]- or [5,6-13C2]
  glucose (green filled circles). Since the PPP does not disrupt carbon-carbon bonds
  in carbons 4–6 of glucose, the presence of [4,5-13C2]- or [5,6-13C2] glucose indicates
  metabolism of [U-13C3] glycerol through the TCA cycle prior to gluconeogenesis.
  DHAP= dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GA3P= glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; G6P=glucose
  6-phosphate; F6P= fructose 6-phosphate; NMR=nuclear magnetic resonance; PEP= phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PPP=pentose phosphate pathway, TCA=tricarboxylic acid; TPI= triose phosphate isomerase
