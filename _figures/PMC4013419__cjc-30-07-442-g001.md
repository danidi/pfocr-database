caption: In the absence of Shh, the negative regulator patched 1 (PTC1), localized
  at the plasma membrane, inhibits signaling through the activating mediator smoothened
  (SMO). In the presence of Shh ligand, Shh binds to PTC and derepresses its negative
  regulation on SMO, activating signaling by inducing the expression of transcription
  factors including MycN and GLI in the nucleus. The Shh pathway can be negatively
  regulated by suppressor of fused (SUFU) in the cytosol.
