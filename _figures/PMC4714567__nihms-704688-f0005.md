caption: In the NC-XRE pathway, as in the canonical pathway, the AHR is activated
  by endogenous or exogenous ligands, tostimulate nuclear translocation. Unlike the
  canonical pathway, the NC-XRE pathway relies on an AHR association with KLF6 and
  recruitment to NC-XRE binding sites flanking target genes, including PAI-1 and p21cip1.
