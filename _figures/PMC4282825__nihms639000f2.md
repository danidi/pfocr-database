caption: Antigen-presenting cells (APC) take up antigens (Ag) released from cancer
  cells and present to T cells. Cancer cells can also present Ag to activated T cells
  in the context of MHC. Upon T cell activation, PD-1 receptors are expressed on T
  cells and inhibit immune responses by engagement of PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands on APC
  and PD-L1 on cancer cells. Therefore, monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated specific
  blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway can enhance anti-tumor immunity. In addition
  to binding to PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 also bind B7-1 and repulsive guidance molecule
  B, respectively. In addition to T cells and APC, PD-1 and PD-L1 can be induced on
  other immune cells.
