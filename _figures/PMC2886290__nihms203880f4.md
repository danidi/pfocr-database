caption: 'Type II FAS pathway as found in P. falciparum. MCAT catalyzes the production
  of malonyl-ACP, which is a substrate for both KASII and KASIII. KASIII catalyzes
  the condensation of malonyl-ACP with acetyl-CoA, forming acetoacetyl-ACP. This product
  enters an elongation cycle catalyzed by KAR, HAD, ENR, and KASII. The KASII reaction
  extends the carbon chain by 2 carbons, noted by increasing the number (n) of CH2
  groups in the acyl chain by 2 (n+2). MCAT: malonyl-coenzyme A:ACP transacylase;
  KAS: β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase; KAR: β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; HAD: β-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  dehydratase; ENR: enoyl-ACP reductase.'
