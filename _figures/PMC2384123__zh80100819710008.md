caption: Possible model for CCL5-mediated mRNA translation in CD4+ T cells. CCL5 activates
  the mTOR pathway and subsequent phosphorylation of p70 S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Hyperphosphorylation
  of 4E-BP1 leads to its release from eIF4E where it binds to eIF4G to form the eIF4F
  initiation complex. Through eIF4E, eIF4F binds to the mRNA 5′-cap structure and
  facilitates ribosome binding and unwinding secondary structure in the 5′-UTR. Translation
  initiation leads to a rapid up-regulation of cyclin D1 and MMP-9 protein levels
  to “prime” T cells for directed cell migration. S6K1 has been shown to phosphorylate
  eIF4B (RNA-binding protein that enhances activity of the eIF4A helicase) in response
  to insulin ().
