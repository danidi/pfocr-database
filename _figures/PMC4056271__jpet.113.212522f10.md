caption: Schematic diagram demonstrating the effects of cytokines on signaling pathways
  mediating initial Ca2+-dependent contraction in colonic smooth muscle cells. Initial
  contraction in response to ACh is mediated by Ca2+ influx and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  activation of MLCK and MLC20 phosphorylation. Activation of AMPK via CaMKK provides
  a negative feedback regulation of MLCK activity. IL-1β or TNF-α stimulates NF-κB
  pathway involving phosphorylation of IκBα by IκB kinase (IKK) 2 leading to degradation
  of IκBα and nuclear translocation of p65/p50 proteins. Degradation of IκBα releases
  the catalytic subunit of PKA. Phosphorylation of AMPK at Ser485 by PKA causes decrease
  in phosphorylation at Thr172 by CaMKK and suppression of its activity in response
  to ACh. Inhibition of AMPK activity augments MLCK activity, MLC20 phosphorylation
  and muscle contraction in response to ACh.
