caption: T cell immune response in the asthmatic airways. naﾑ要e T cell is received
  allergen presentation by DCs. The pathway begins with the development of Th2 cells
  and their production of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. These cytokines stimulate
  allergic and eosinophilic inflammation as well as epithelial and smooth-muscle changes
  that contribute to asthma pathobiology. Th9 cell can be induced and stimulate mast
  cells by IL-9. naﾑ要e T cell is also differentiated to Th1 or Th17 cells depending
  on the existence of cytokines in the microenvironment. Th1 cell and Th17 cell stimulate
  and induce neutrophilic inflammation. EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal-myofibroblast
  transition; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MBP, major basic protein; LT, leukotriene.
