caption: Mechanisms whereby betaine inhibits IL-1β release. (A) The activation of
  ATP-mediated P2X7R promotes IL-1β and caspase-1 localize to secretory lysosomes
  together with the lysosomal enzymes secretion. Mechanistically, the above process
  is associated with the P2X7R-induced K+ efflux, which enhances the activation of
  PLC, thus increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration, enabling Ca2+-dependent PLA2
  activation and promoting exocytosis of the IL-1β-containing lysosomes. Actually,
  PLA2 activity has been showed to be regulated by phosphorylation by ERK1/2 and ROS.
  Betaine inhibits IL-1β release via suppressing exocytosis of the IL-1β-containing
  lysosomes through reducing the activity of PLA2 by blocking the ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway and/or lowering the ROS level. (B) ATP-induced P2X7R activation promotes
  the C-terminal domain interacts with Src-K, phosphorylating the subsequent p38 MAPK,
  inducing acidic A-SMase delivers from the inner to the outer plasma membrane. Subsequently,
  A-SMase hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to generate ceramide, altering membrane fluidity,
  promoting the formation of plasma membrane blebs and resulting in shedding of IL-1β-containing
  microvesicles. And microvesicle shedding is preceded by flip of PS to the outer
  leaflet of the plasma membrane. Interestingly, A-SMase can be activated by proteolytic
  cleavage of pro-A-SMase by caspase-8 and caspase-7 or ROS. Betaine inhibits IL-1β
  release via blunting the IL-1β-containing microvesicle shedding by blocking the
  activation of A-SMase through inhibiting caspase-7/8 activation. (C) Betaine inhibits
  IL-1β release by restraining the IL-1β-containing microvesicle shedding by reducing
  ROS level. (D) IL-1β release is also involving exocytosis of exosomes; besides,
  MVBs formation and IL-1β and caspase-1 accumulation can be tightly modulated by
  inflammasome complex. Betaine lowers the release of IL-1β by inhibiting the formation
  of MVBs and exosomes via inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. (E) Moreover,
  IL-1β is passively released alongside DAMPs following plasma membrane rupture. Betaine
  blunts the passive efflux of IL-1β through its effects on protecting cell membrane
  from external membrane-perturbing compounds-induced rupture. PLA2, phospholipase
  A2; ERK1/2, extracelluar signal-regulated kinase; A-SMase, acidic sphingomyelinase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; MVBs, multivesicular bodies.
