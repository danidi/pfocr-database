caption: PI3K–AKT signalling promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  by repressing the forkhead box O (FOXO)-mediated stress response. This is accompanied
  by increased glycolysis and activation of mTOR, which promotes cell cycling of haematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs) (indicated by green background). MYC controls the balance between
  HSC self-renewal and differentiation, (indicated by pink background). Gln is converted
  to glutamate by glutaminase, which is under the control of MYC, in part through
  microRNA-23 (miR-23), and its role in stem cell homeostasis is currently being elucidated.
  The promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML)–peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-δ
  (PPARδ) pathway for fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is required for long-term haematopoietic
  stem cell (LT-HSC) self-renewal and quiescence (indicated by orange background).
  Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) are a family of enzymes that are responsible for
  catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into α-chetoglutarate (αKG).
  IDH1 functions in the cytosol and peroxisomes, whereas IDH2 and IDH3 are both localized
  in the mitochondria. Dashed arrows indicate transport between mitochondria and the
  cytosol. Question marks indicate interesting links between metabolic programmes,
  although these connections have not been formally tested in stem cells. Acetyl-CoA,
  acetyl-coenzyme A; FASN, fatty acid synthase; LKB1, liver kinase B1; PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle.
