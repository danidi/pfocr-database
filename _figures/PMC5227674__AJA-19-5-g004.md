caption: Transmembrane ion transport proteins and mechanisms thought to be involved
  in the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) of sperm. Reduction of cell volume is characterized
  by H2O removal via aquaporins (blue tubules) due to K+ and Cl− efflux via K+ and
  Cl− channels and co-transporters (red tubules) and coupled Cl−/HCO3− exchangers
  (brown tubules). Protein kinase-C (PKC) and tyrosine kinase (TK) are believed to
  be involved in the signaling sequence that leads to deactivation of the regulatory
  mechanism by closing and keeping closed the anion channel (inactive state). Inhibition
  of PKC, probably by dephosphorylation of the residues phosphorylated by PKC, which
  results in activation of the channel, increases the isotonic cell volume. Protein
  phosphatase 1 (PP1) may be involved in the signaling sequence that leads to the
  activation of the regulatory mechanism, possibly by the opening the ion channels
  (active state) and thus reducing the cell volume. The inhibition of PP1 results
  in blocked RVD. The TK and tyrosine phosphatase (TP) are believed to be involved
  in the activation and regulation of PP1 activity. Besides PP1, PKC, TK, and TP regulation
  is also assumed that cAMP-dependent pathway and Ca2+ channels (not represented)
  are also involved in regulation of sperm volume. Under hypotonic conditions, forskolin,
  a potent stimulator of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), activates sAC that in turn
  leads to an increase in cAMP levels. This increase of cAMP levels may cause an activation
  of the mechanism of RVD (opening the ion channels). By contrast, activation of phosphodiesterase,
  an enzyme belonging to a group of enzymes that degrades the phosphodiester bond
  in the second messenger molecules cAMP, results in decrease of cAMP levels with
  opposite effects.
