caption: Within the epithelium of the normal colonic mucosa, stem cells are located
  at the base of the crypts. Following asymmetric division, the daughter cells undergo
  differentiation and migrate upwards to give rise to transient amplifying cells and
  terminally differentiated cells. Colonic stem cells generate three types of differentiated
  cells; the absorptive columnar cells, the hormone-producing enteroendocrine cells,
  and the mucus-secreting goblet cells. Pericryptal myofibroblasts surround the crypt
  base, which is thought to comprise a stem cell ‘niche’. These cells regulate epithelial
  stem cell function by paracrine secretion of growth factors and cytokines. Notch
  activation is observed within the proliferative zone located within the lower region
  of the crypt. Meanwhile, KLF4 is expressed in the differentiated epithelial cells
  at the top half of the crypt. Since Hes 1, the direct transcriptional target of
  Notch, is a transcriptional repressor of KLF4, it is generally assumed that the
  KLF4 expression is restricted to the differentiated cryptal cells.
