caption: 'Four methanogenic pathways of Methanosarcina. Each pathway shares a common
  step in the reduction of methyl-CoM to methane; however, they differ in the route
  used to form methyl-CoM and in the source of electrons used for its reduction to
  methane. The CO2 reduction pathway (red arrows) involves the reduction of CO2 to
  methane using electrons derived from the oxidation of H2, while the methylotrophic
  pathway (light blue arrows) involves disproportionation of C1 substrates to methane
  and CO2. These two pathways share many steps, with overall metabolic flux occurring
  in opposite directions (shown by red- and light blue-shaded arrows). In the aceticlastic
  pathway (green arrows), acetate is split into a methyl group and an enzyme-bound
  carbonyl moiety (shown in brackets) by the enzyme acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase
  (ACDS). The latter is oxidized to CO2, producing reduced ferredoxin that provides
  electrons for reduction of the methyl group to methane. Lastly, in the methyl reduction
  pathway (dark blue arrows), C1 compounds are reduced to CH4 using electrons derived
  from H2 oxidation. Dashed lines depict the diffusion of H2, which occurs during
  the transfer of electrons between the oxidative and reductive portions of the methylotrophic
  and aceticlastic pathways. The steps catalyzed by the Frh, Vht, and Ech hydrogenases
  are indicated. Note that in wild-type M. barkeri, hydrogenases are involved in all
  four pathways. Abbreviations: Hdr, heterodisulfide reductase; MF, methanofuran;
  H4SPT, tetrahydrosarcinapterin; CoM, coenzyme M; CoB, coenzyme B; CoM-S-S-CoB, heterodisulfide

  and F420red, oxidized and reduced cofactor F420, respectively; MPox and MPred, oxidized
  and reduced methanophenazine, respectively.'
