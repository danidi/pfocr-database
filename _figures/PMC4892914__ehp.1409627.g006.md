caption: Selected mechanisms potentially involved in TGF-β–mediated epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). (A) Under normal conditions, GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of
  nuclear SNAIL-1 allows its nuclear export and subsequent cytosolic degradation ().
  (B) In our study on BEAS-2B cells, chrysotile exposure induced early production
  of ROS (1), which we hypothesize subsequently activates the latent form of TGF-β
  (2). Upon release, TGF-β is stabilized and directly presented to its receptors,
  which then associate and activate a variety of signaling pathways. Both Smad-mediated
  (3) and non–Smad-mediated (6) pathways are involved (; ). Increased levels of TGF-β
  result in the activation of the Smad-mediated pathway, suppression of epithelial
  genes (e.g., E-cadherin), and induction of EMT mesenchymal markers (4) through activation/induction
  of and coassociation with a variety of transcription factors (including SNAIL-1)
  (5). We hypothesize that the non–Smad-mediated pathway leads to Akt activation (6)
  and GSK-3β inactivation (7), and induction of SNAIL-1 nuclear stabilization and
  genes targeting promotion (8), thus contributing to EMT. In addition, we hypothesize
  that MMPs secreted by cells (9) may promote the late activation of TGF-β (10), resulting
  in potentially continuous autocrine cell stimulation that may further reinforce
  signaling for EMT promotion (11).
