caption: Functional roles of the arenavirus Z protein in the viral life cycle. Regulation
  of viral RNA synthesis. Transcription and replication of arenaviruses takes place
  in the host cell cytoplasm. Z protein regulates these processes through interaction
  with the viral polymerase. Orchestration of viral assembly and budding. Z protein
  drives particle release at the plasma membrane. Through interaction with GP and
  viral RNPs, Z mediates their incorporation into nascent virions. Interaction with
  host cell proteins. Z protein interacts with several host cell factors, such as
  PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein), eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  4E), PRH (proline-rich homeodomain protein), and ribosomal P proteins. The assumed
  biological effects of these interactions on arenavirus replication are discussed
  in the text. Interferon antagonism. Z proteins from various NW arenaviruses participate
  in IFN antagonism.While Z protein inhibits the activation of RIG-I-mediated downstream
  signalling pathway through direct interaction with RIG-I, NP, which is the main
  arenavirus interferon antagonist, causes a block in the IRF-3 activation pathway
  and prevents nuclear translocation of IRF-3.

    Z protein drives particle release at the plasma membrane. Through interaction

    The assumed biological effects of these interactions on arenavirus replication
    are discussed in the text. Interferon antagonism. Z proteins from various NW arenaviruses

    downstream signalling pathway through direct interaction with RIG-I, NP, which
