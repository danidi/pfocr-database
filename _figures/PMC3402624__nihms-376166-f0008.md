caption: Upd from the hub activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in adjacent GSCs
  and CySCs. In CySCs, activation of Stat92E leads to expression of its targets ZFH1
  and Chinmo, which are both required for CySCs self-renewal. Similarly, Ken is cell-autonomously
  required for CySC self-renewal in a Stat92E-independent manner. Stat92E activates
  Socs36E and represses Ptp61F expression. Whether Ptp61F behaves as an inhibitor
  of Stat92E in the testis remains unknown (dashed line). See text for details.
