caption: Activated Notch signaling in ECs mediates CKD-induced neointima formation.
  Complications of CKD (such as TGF-β1) induce activation of Notch signaling that
  stimulates the expression of mesenchymal markers in ECs of AVFs. This leads to EC
  barrier dysfunction and enhances infiltration of inflammatory cells. These responses
  promote the formation of neointima and loss of dialysis access. Knockdown of Notch
  pathway in ECs suppresses CKD-induced neointima formation.
