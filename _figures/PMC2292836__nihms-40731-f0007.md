caption: 'Diagram of a male gonad. Anterior is to the left. Sexual dimorphism of three
  cell types is controlled non-autonomously via different types of male-specific cell-cell
  signaling from the SGPs: Wnt2 expression induces PC precursor formation, the JAK/STAT
  pathway regulates male germ cell development, and an unknown signal promotes msSGP
  survival in male gonads. Inset shows a model for PC specification, in which Wnt2
  is regulated by dsx to induce male PC fate in surrounding fat body cells. Although
  Wnt2 is genetically downstream of dsx as indicated, our data indicate that dsx acts
  in the female gonad to directly or indirectly repress Wnt2 expression.'
