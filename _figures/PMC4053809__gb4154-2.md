caption: Potential models for selecting transcripts for piRNA processing. (a) A unique
  chromatin state of piRNA-producing loci can guide channeling of RNA transcribed
  from these regions to the piRNA processing machinery. Bidirectional piRNA clusters
  are enriched in the HP1 homolog Rhino. Rhino colocalizes with UAP56, which binds
  long piRNA precursors and shuttles them from the nucleus to cytoplasmic nuage granules.
  These interactions could facilitate targeted export of cluster transcripts directly
  to the processing machinery. (b)Trans-generationally inherited piRNAs can guide
  selection of the transcripts processed to piRNA. Maternally transmitted piRNAs loaded
  into Aub and Ago3 complexes can initiate processing of complementary transcripts
  through the Ping-Pong cycle. Alternatively, inherited piRNAs bound to the nuclear
  Piwi protein could identify nascent transcripts and induce deposition of chromatin
  marks such as H3K9me3 that lead to processing of transcripts into piRNAs using the
  pathway shown in (a).
