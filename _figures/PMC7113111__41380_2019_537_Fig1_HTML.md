caption: Signaling pathways from three ER transmembrane stress sensors during unfolded
  protein response (UPR) in schizophrenia. a ER stress stimulates the activation of
  the three ER transmembrane stress sensors, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK),
  activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α),
  that are involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR). a Under basal, unstressed
  conditions, the UPR sensors are present within the ER membrane. The heat shock protein
  BiP (Grp78) binds these receptors and prevents them from forming homodimers and
  from translocating out of the cell. b After dissociation of BiP, ATF6 translocates
  to the Golgi where it is cleaved and trafficked to the nucleus, while PERK and IRE1α
  form homodimers and autophosphorylate. Activation of the PERK pathway leads to phosphorylation
  of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and increased expression
  of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), while activation of the IRE1α pathway
  leads to unconventional mRNA splicing of the transcription factor x-box binding
  protein 1 (XBP1). In addition, IRE1α activation recruits TNF receptor associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2) and results in phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase
  1 (ASK1), which then phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK). ATF6, ATF4, and spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) function as transcription factors of
  UPR target genes, such as ER chaperones, the ER quality control system (ERQC) and
  ER-associated degradation (ERAD)

  description: Signaling pathways from three ER transmembrane stress sensors during
