caption: Canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB signaling is initiated when a PRR
  or cytokine receptor recognizes its ligand, starting a signaling cascade (1) that
  converges on the phosphorylation of the IKK2 complex. IKK2 then phosphorylates IκBα
  (2), leading to its polyubiquitination and (3) subsequent degradation by the proteasome.
  This releases NF-κB dimers from negative regulation and (4) allows them to translocate
  to the nucleus to (5) initiate inflammatory gene transcription. (6) De novo synthesis
  of IκBα acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB-dependent transcription, limiting
  inflammation in the absence of further signaling events. (7) Primary response genes
  include those encoding cytokines such as TNF. (8) Release of these proteins leads
  to autocrine signaling through cytokine receptors. This, or (9) continued PRR ligation,
  create a positive feedback loop wherein NF-κB is periodically activated until these
  signals are eliminated.
