caption: Schematic illustration of the DOI-mediated pathway for the enhancement of
  liver regeneration. Exogenous DOI (1) stimulates endothelial cells to express and
  release VEGF (2), which binds to endothelial Vegf receptors and opens fenestrae,
  eventually improving hepatic perfusion (3). The open fenestrae enable the adhesion
  of platelets to sinusoids after injury. The activated platelets release endogenous
  serotonin to initiate a regenerative response. The improved porosity and blood flow
  increase the availability of additional factors and nutrients required for the initiation
  and completion of liver regeneration (4).
