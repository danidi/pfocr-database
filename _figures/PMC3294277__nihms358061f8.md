caption: Regulation of insulin sensitivity by electrophiles through adduction and
  inhibition of PTP1B. Phosphatases play a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis
  by regulating and limiting phosphorylation and downstream signaling. In particular,
  the insulin receptor and its signaling pathway are tightly regulated by phosphorylation
  and dephosphorylation reactions. Activation of the insulin receptor leads to its
  phosphorylation and triggers the phosphorylation of the IRS protein family, resulting
  in downstream activation of kinases and modulation of metabolic enzymes and pathways.
  PTP1B exerts a tight control of these phosphorylation events. Adduction of PTP1B
  by electrophiles at the catalytic cysteine results in catalytic inhibition, prolonging
  the effects and intensity of regulated pathways, thus impacting glucose homeostasis
  and insulin sensitivity. Electrophiles modulate this pathway both directly (through
  covalent binding to PTP1B) and indirectly (through activation of the general metabolic
  regulator PPARγ).
