caption: NPC1 is a multipass transmembrane glycoprotein whose folding is facilitated
  by the calnexin/calreticulin machinery. Folding is also promoted by binding cholesterol
  or oxysterols at sites in the NTD and perhaps in more C-terminal regions, such as
  the sterol sensing domain (highlighted by grey oval). The natively folded protein
  traffics through the Golgi to late endosome/lysosomes, where it facilitates efflux
  of unesterified cholesterol. Both WT and NPC1-I1061T, a missense mutant that causes
  disease, are degraded by the proteasome if they fail to properly fold. While components
  of the ERAD pathway that participate in this process have not been defined, cytosolic
  machinery including Hsp70 and CHIP have been implicated in the clearance process.
  Ubiquitination of NPC1 occurs on three lysine resides (318, 792 and 1180) which
  face the cytosol. Also implicated in the clearance of misfolded multipass transmembrane
  proteins is ER-phagy. Through this pathway, membrane proteins in the ER are engulfed
  by pre-autophagosome structures (PAS), which subsequently form autophagosomes, fuse
  with lysosomes, and lead to substrate degradation in autolysosomes. The extent to
  which this pathway contributes to NPC1 degradation is currently unknown.
