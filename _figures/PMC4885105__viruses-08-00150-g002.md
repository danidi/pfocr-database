caption: Infection cycle of HCV. The infection of HCV is initiated by the attachment
  and entry of virus particle through a number of cell surface receptors. The HCV
  RNA binds to ribosome and translates a single large polyprotein, which is a process
  into structural and non-structural proteins. Accumulation of viral proteins induces
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress response that leads to proliferation of ER-membranes
  and formation of membranous web structure. HCV replication produces many new genomic
  positive strand and negative strand RNA. Genomic HCV positive strand RNA packages
  into complete infectious virus particles that release through secretory pathway.
