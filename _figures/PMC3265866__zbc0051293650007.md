caption: Model of PGC-1α- and AMPK-mediated regulation of IL1Rn expression in hepatocytes.
  Fasting and physical exercise increase blood concentration of glucagon, leading
  to increased cAMP level in hepatocytes. cAMP induces PGC-1α, which in turn triggers
  expression of PPARα and IL1RN in a PPARα-dependent manner. Consequently, IL1RN interferes
  with IL1β-mediated inflammation and inhibits expression of acute phase proteins
  (CRP and haptoglobin) in hepatocytes. Fasting, physical exercise, and antidiabetic
  drug metformin also activate AMPK. AMPK phosphorylates PGC-1α and increases its
  transcriptional activity in the context of the Il1rn promoter. In addition, AMPK
  and metformin affect IL1RN expression in a mechanism independent of the PGC-1α and
  PPARα pathway.
