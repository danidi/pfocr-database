caption: 'Transport pathway of irinotecan.Notes: A prodrug, irinotecan, is moved into
  hepatic cells by passive effusion. Activation to an active form, SN-38, is mediated
  by CES1/2. Deactivation to an inactive form, SN-38G (glucuronidated SN-38), is mainly
  mediated by UGT1A1. A part of SN-38G is hydrolyzed to SN-38 by bacterial β-glucosidase.
  Moreover, irinotecan is degraded to APC and NPC metabolites by CYP3A4/5. Irinotecan
  and metabolites are transported by P-glycoprotein, a protein of the cell membrane
  that pumps foreign substances out of cells, which is encoded by ABCB1 gene. Biliary
  excretion of SN-38G is mainly mediated by the MRP2/ABCC2.Abbreviations: APC, 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic
  acid)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin; CES1/2, carboxylesterases 1 and 2;
  CYP3A4/5, cytochrome P450 isoforms 3A4 and 3A5; MRP2/ABCC2, multidrug resistance
  associated protein-2; NPC, 7-ethyl-10-(4-amino-1-piperidino) carbonyloxycamptothecin;
  SN-38, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin; UGT1A1, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase
