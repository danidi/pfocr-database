caption: Modulating the repair-associated inflammatory response in liver fibrosis
  by the injury-related activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. (A) In healthy
  liver, there is lack of detectable activity of Hh pathway because of low Hh ligand
  expression and relatively high Hh ligand antagonist (Hhip) expression in liver sinusoidal
  lining cells [quiescent hepatic stellate cells (Q-HSCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial
  cells (LSECs)]. (B) In injured liver, various types of injury stimulate liver epithelial
  cells (mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes) to produce and release Hh ligands,
  repress the expression of Hhip in liver sinusoidal lining cells, and then unleash
  a cascade that results in aberrant activation of Hh signaling pathway. The cell
  populations that are involved in liver inflammation, regeneration, and fibrogenesis
  are consequently expanded, and most of these cells are Hh-producing cells and/or
  Hh-responsive cells. The extensive enrichment of Hh ligands, the proximity of Hh-producing
  and Hh-responsive cells in anatomical structure, with the addition of the complex
  autocrine and paracrine Hh signaling loops consist of the injury-related intrahepatic
  signaling niches of Hh, which in turn has an impact on the roles of these cell populations,
  in particular immune cell population, during liver fibrogenesis. (1) Hh ligands
  can induce the transdifferentiation of Q-HSCs into myofibroblastic HSCs (MF-HSCs)
  and further stimulate the production of Hh ligands by MF-HSCs. (2) Hh ligands secreted
  by injured liver epithelial cells and MF-HSCs can promote the proliferation and
  survival of liver progenitor population, and then the accumulation of liver progenitor
  population contributes to the regeneration of the injured liver. (3) Hh ligands,
  as viability factors for natural killer T (NKT) cells, contribute to the recruitment
  of circulating NKT cells into the injured liver, prolong their intra-hepatic survival
  and increase their opportunities for the exposure to potential antigen-presenting
  cells. Moreover, pro-fibrogenic cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-13) and OPN were secreted
  by Hh ligand-induced NKT cells, which, as well as Hh ligands produced by NKT cells
  themselves, further expand the population of liver myofibroblasts by promoting transdifferentiation
  of Q-HSCs into MF-HSCs. (4) Both Hh ligands and Hh-induced OPN can act as chemoattractants
  for monocytes and recruit bone marrow-derived monocytes into the injured liver.
  Furthermore, Hh ligands can autocrinally induce the alternative activation of macrophages
  while OPN can paracrinally stimulate the pro-inflammatory phenotype of hepatic macrophage,
  both of which contribute to the transdifferentiation of Q-HSCs into MF-HSCs. (5)
  Besides Hh ligands, Hh-induced cholangiocytes also secrete several chemokines that
  recruit different types of immune cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages,
  and T and B lymphocytes, into the injured liver. These infiltrating inflammatory
  cells, in turn, produce more Hh ligands and amplify Hh signaling cascade. Meanwhile,
  these cells also produce pro-fibrogenic cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-4, IL-13, and
  transforming growth factor β1) that mediate duct injury and repair, and myofibroblastic
  differentiation of portal fibroblasts. (6) The accumulative effect of Hh ligands
  on LSECs is to promote LSEC capillarization. When capillarized, LSECs lose their
  abilities to maintain the quiescence of HSCs, and instead promote intrahepatic vasoconstriction
  and the development of fibrosis.
