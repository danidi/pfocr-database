caption: DCs are differentiated in bone marrow from hematopoietic progenitor cells
  (HPC) alongside two major pathways. One is a myeloid-cell pathway that include common
  myeloid precursors (CMP) and immature myeloid cells (MDSC). The latter cells represent
  the population of immediate precursors of myeloid cells (granulocytes, macrophages,
  and DCs). In the periphery MDSC differentiate into immature DCs (iDC), which after
  encounter of different stimuli become activated or mature DCs (mDCs). The other
  pathway of DC differentiation includes common lymphoid precursors (CLP) and precursors
  of plasmacytoid DCs (ppDCs). These cells in the periphery become plasmacytoid DCs
  (pDC). Through a number of tumor-derived factors, tumors alter DC differentiation
  that results in increased production of pDC, accumulation of iDC, and immunosuppressive
  regulatory DCs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). All these populations
  of cells are able to suppress antigen-specific immune response in cancer via different
  mechanisms.
