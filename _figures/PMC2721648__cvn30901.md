caption: Regulation and function of sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1). (A) The diagram depicts
  some of the negative and positive regulators of SK1 activity and the synthesis and
  location of the SK1/S1P pathway either present in the heart or derived experimentally.
  A key feature of this pathway is the conversion of the ubiquitous membrane lipid
  sphingomyelin by several sphingomyelinases manufactured intracellularly that act
  both at the membrane level and extracellularly. This results in the generation of
  ceramide that is deacylated by neutral ceramidase, yielding sphingosine, which is
  then converted to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by the action of SK1. (B) A second
  isoform of SK (SK2) is also responsible for S1P generation. The location of S1P
  generation within the cell may determine its effect, but the outcomes of such location-based
  effects have not been determined. The recycling pathway for the conversion of sphingosine
  into pro-apoptotic ceramide is dependent on SK2, acting in concert with S1P phosphohydrolase
  1. As shown in the figure, SK2 (like SK1) is activated by ERK 1/2 and is also responsible
  for phosphorylation of the immunomodulator FTY720. SK2 resides in the nucleus and
  its export is dependent on the activity of protein kinase D.
