caption: Proposed strategies to reinforce protective TREG functions to abolish cancer
  and restore overall health. Cancer immunotherapy strategies to date focus primarily
  on boosting the antitumoral immunological responses of the cancer patient. In that
  way, TREG are viewed as an obstacle in tumor immunotherapy and a target for elimination.
  Recent data suggests that tumor survival and progression are instead vitally dependent
  on elevated and sustained local and systematic proinflammatory signaling. This raises
  the possibility that interrupting this proinflammatory loop of signals may be a
  more direct and constructive route to tumor eradication and restoration of overall
  health. Thus blocking TNF-α or the STAT3 inflammatory signaling pathway have been
  shown to rapidly and efficiently abrogate growing cancers in mouse models. Blocking
  these proinflammatory factors rapidly restores beneficial TREG functions and epithelial
  homeostasis. An emerging concept of overall health is systemic benefit of gut microbiota
  to reinforce beneficial effects of IL-10-dependent anti-inflammatory TREG cells.
  Adoptive-transfer studies in mice have shown the unsurpassed ability of gut bacteria-primed
  TREG to rapidly restore homeostasis in tissues of the GI tract and also in extraintestinal
  sites. It was surprising that transfer of TREG actually suppressed established carcinoma
  in mice. One therapeutic challenge will be to overcome redirection of TREG in the
  proinflammatory tumor environment. Harnessing antineoplastic potential may involve
  ex vivo cultivation, expansion and stabilization of human TREG for individualized
  therapies using autologous transfusions. Broader population-based reinforcement
  of TREG could be achieved by dietary habits undertaken earlier in life including
  probiotics or other bacterialbased modalities, or supplementation with retinoic
  acid and vitamin D.
