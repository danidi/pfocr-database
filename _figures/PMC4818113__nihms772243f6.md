caption: (a) The canonical sulfide oxidation pathway found in most tissues resides
  in the mitochondrion and involves four enzymes. In the first step of the pathway,
  sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) oxidizes sulfide to persulfide, which is transferred
  from the active site of SQR to a small molecule acceptor, such as glutathione (GSH).
  The glutathione persulfide (GSSH) product can be oxidized by persulfide dioxygenase
  (PDO) to sulfite or can be used in a sulfurtransferase reaction catalyzed by rhodanese
  (Rhd) in the presence of sulfite, to form thiosulfate. In the final step, sulfite
  is oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase (SO). (b) Heme-dependent sulfide oxidation
  pathway. An alternative pathway for sulfide oxidation involves ferric heme–dependent
  conversion of H2S to a mixture of thiosulfate and polysulfides. This newly discovered
  mechanism has been established for human hemoglobin and could be an activity of
  other heme proteins as well. For clarity, the fate of the H2S sulfur atom is highlighted
  in red and other reactants and reaction stoichiometries are omitted.
