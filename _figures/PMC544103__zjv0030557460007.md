caption: A model depicting the role of the γ134.5 protein in inhibiting signaling
  through the integrated stress response pathway. HSV-1 infection triggers cellular
  responses involving PKR and PERK. The dsRNA produced by HSV early in infection activates
  PKR. In addition, viral proteins accumulated during infection activate PERK in the
  ER. Activation of PKR and PERK leads to eIF-2α phosphorylation and thereby shuts
  off protein synthesis. To block cellular responses, the γ134.5 protein recruits
  PP1, forming a complex that dephosphorylates eIF-2α. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α also
  activates the expression of GADD34, which serves as a feedback loop to mediate eIF-2α
  dephosphorylation by binding to PP1.
