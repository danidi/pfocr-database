caption: Schematic illustration of the role of Panx3 in dental pulp inflammation.
  TNF‐α could down‐regulate the expression of Panx3 via activating proteasome pathway,
  meanwhile the NF‐κB might balance the effect. In addition, Panx3 could suppress
  NF‐κB signalling pathway, leading to inhibition of TNF‐α‐induced inflammatory response.
  The black lines indicate that the interactions have been clearly established in
  previous studies. The purple lines indicate the connection established in this study.
  MG132, a proteasome inhibitor; BAY 11‐7082, a NF‐κB inhibitor.
