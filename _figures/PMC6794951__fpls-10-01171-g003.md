caption: Zn and camalexin, a phytoalexin essential for A. thaliana resistance against
  Alternaria brassicicola, showed a joint effect in the Arabidopsis response to Alternaria.
  High leaf Zn concentration could not substitute the role of camalexin in the Arabidopsis
  camalexin-deficient mutant, pad3, infected with A. brassicicola. Nonetheless, in
  the wild type, Zn supplementation greatly enhanced the JA-ET-dependent defense signaling
  pathway and the expression of PAD3, an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in camalexin
  synthesis.
