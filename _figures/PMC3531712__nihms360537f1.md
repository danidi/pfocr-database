caption: p62-interacting partners and functions. The PB1 domain of p62 binds and inhibits
  ERK1, which is crucial for the negative regulation of adipogenesis and obesity and
  the ensuing inflammation. p62 also interacts with PKCζ through a PB1-PB1 interaction.
  The ZZ zinc-finger domain binds RIP, which links p62 to NF-κB activation in the
  TNF pathway. The TB domain binds TRAF6, which is relevant in RANK-induced osteoclastogenesis,
  as well as in Ras-induced tumorigenesis. p62 also interacts with raptor, which restrains
  autophagy through mTOR activation. This inhibition of autophagy, because of p62’s
  ability to interact with LC3, serves to control p62 levels. The interaction with
  Keap1 might be important for the regulation of Nrf2 and the control of ROS levels.
  Finally, the UBA domain regulates the interaction of p62 with polyubiquitylated
  proteins targeted for degradation by the proteasome or autophagy.
