caption: A) Glutathione synthesis - The tripeptide glutathione is synthesized in two
  ATP-consuming reactions. Event (a) represents the condensation of cysteine and glutamate
  to form the dipeptide γ-glutamylcysteine in a reaction catalyzed by glutamate cysteine
  ligase. Event (b) represents the addition of glycine to form the tripeptide in a
  reaction catalyzed by GSH synthetase. B) GSH-GSSG redox cycling - Glutathione peroxidases
  catalyze the reduction of H2O2 and organic peroxides at the expenses of electrons
  from GSH (event a). The oxidized glutathione generated by the GPx-catalyzed reaction
  can be reduced by glutathione reductase (event b), which uses NADPH generated mainly
  by the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (event c). C) GSH complexation
  with xenobiotics - The conjugation of glutathione with diverse xenobiotics is catalyzed
  by glutathione-S-transferases (event a), forming a xenobiotic-GSH conjugate that
  can be exported from the intra- to the extracellular environment via multidrug resistance-associated
  proteins (event b). D) Thiol oxidation - The formation of protein disulfides can
  occur via either the oxidation of two protein thiols (from a single or different
  proteins, events a and b, respectively) or when a single sulfhydryl protein forms
  a disulfide with GSH via glutathionylation, forming a mixed disulfide (event c).
  E) Glutaredoxins - Glutaredoxins use electrons from glutathione to reduce oxidized
  target proteins, restoring the reduced state in cysteine(s) from proteins (event
  a) or from a mixed disulfide (event b).GSH (reduced glutathione = γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine);

  γ-glutamylcysteine); GCL (glutamate cysteine ligase); GS (GSH synthetase); GPx (glutathione
