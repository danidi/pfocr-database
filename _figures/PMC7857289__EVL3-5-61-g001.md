caption: 'Simulations of color evolution using an anthocyanin pathway model. (A) The
  anthocyanin pathway, a portion of the larger flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (Winkel‐Shirley
  ), is shown with substrates at nodes and enzymes along arrows. Flux moves from PCoA
  at the top down through the branches of the pathway, terminating in the three types
  of pigments (pelargonidin (pel), cyanidin (cya), and delphinidin (del)), as well
  as the three flavonols kaempferol (kam), quercetin (que), and myricetin (myr). B)
  The simulations began with a naive state (all pathway parameters equal; see text)
  and moved first to blue (90% delphinidin), then to purple (90% cyanidin), and finally
  to red (90% pelargonidin). Substrates include: PCoA (P‐Coumaroyl‐CoA), cha (chalcone),
  nar (naringenin), DHK (dihydrokaempferol), DHQ (dihydroquercetin), DHM (dihydromyricetin),
  LCD (leucopelargonidin), LCC (leucocyanidin), LCD (leucodelphinidin). Enzyme abbreviations
  are: CHS (chalcone synthase), CHI (chalcone isomerase), F3H (flavanone‐3‐hydroxylase),
  F3''H (flavonol‐3''‐hydroxylase), F3''5''H (flavonoid‐3''5''‐hydroxylase), DFR (dihyroflavonol‐4‐reductase),
  FLS (flavonol synthase), ANS (anthocyanidin synthase).'
