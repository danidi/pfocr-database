caption: Model of mevalonate and Hippo pathways regulating YAP-controlled RHAMM transcription
  and cancer cell motility. Mevalonate pathway regulates activity of YAP, the downstream
  effector of Hippo pathway, which activates transcription of RHAMM that is required
  for ERK activation and cancer cell migration and invasion. YAP/TEAD activates RHAMM
  transcription by binding to RHAMM promoter at two specific TEAD-binding sites. Mevalonate
  pathway promotes and simvastatin inhibits YAP activity, and consequently RHAMM transcription,
  ERK activation, and cancer metastasis, via modulating YAP phosphorylation and nuclear-cytoplasmic
  distribution. The regulation of YAP-mediated RHAMM transcription and cancer metastasis
  depends on geranylgeranylation, Rho GTPase activity, and actin cytoskeleton assembly,
  but not the canonical MST/LATS cascade.
