caption: Simplified diagram of the main metabolic pathways involved in DNA damage/repair.
  Continuous activation of aerobic glycolysis can increase the capture of glucose
  into the cytoplasm by up-regulating the expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs)
  and substantially enhance the high rate of glucose influx via activating HK, PFK,
  and aldolase enzyme and promoting their expression, which in turn facilitates the
  aerobic glycolysis. The glycolytic switch in tumor cells allows the direct or indirect
  flux of glycolytic intermediates to many biosynthetic pathways (e.g., pentose phosphate
  pathway, serine synthesis pathway, MG pathway, and nucleotide synthesis), which
  provides the biomacromolecules and other materials required for prolonging the cancer
  cell survival via enhancing DNA repair, inhibiting DNA damage and decreasing chromatin
  remodeling
