caption: 'Mechanistic studies. A) One-pot competition secondary H/D KIE experiment.
  B) Hammett studies. In red: Relative rates of cyclization of 1b-1f promoted by catalyst
  7b. In blue: Enantioselectivities (expressed as –ΔΔG‡= RTln(enantiomer ratio), T
  = 25 °C) in the formation of 2b-2f promoted by 7a. C) Proposed catalytic cycle based
  on the KIE data and the experimentally determined rate law. D) Transition state
  model for the pathway leading to the major enantiomeric product in the cyclization
  of 1d. Key bond lengths are reported in Angstroms. Calculations were carried out
  at PCM (CyH) – B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G(d,p) // B3LYP/6-31G(d).'
