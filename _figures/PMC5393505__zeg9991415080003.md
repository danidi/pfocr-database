caption: Genomatix analysis output of genes displaying damaging mutations (nonsense,
  frameshift) with concurrent LOH of the remaining allele. The aggregation of genes
  were intimately associated to the TP53 pathway, highlighting the importance of this
  pathway in ACC tumorigenesis. Gene products are depicted as rounded rectangles,
  snip-sided rectangles signify proteins kinases and star-shaped symbols symbolize
  cofactors. The number of sources for a chemical association to established molecules
  (for pharmaceutic intervention purposes) is suggested in the top right corner of
  each symbol, whereas the lower right number denotes the number of recognized interactions
  within the signaling network in addition to the depicted association. Filled lines
  with arrows represent an activating effect; filled lines with stop line and circle
  designate inhibitory effect. Dotted lines symbolize evidence at the level of cocitation,
  as opposed to filled lines, which designate evidence at expert-curation level. Colored
  letter matrices suggest DNA-binding properties (known transcription factor).
