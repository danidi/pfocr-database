caption: Disrupted functions in dopamine receptor-, GABA receptor-, and NMDAR-mediated
  neurotransmission are commonly suggested to contribute to schizophrenia etiologies.
  The ErbB4 receptor is present in pyramidal glutamatergic neurons, GABA-producing
  interneurons, and dopamine (DA)-producing neurons. Reduced Nrg1 levels decrease
  ErbB4 signaling in these cells. The consequent reduction in DA transmission will
  impair synaptic function via the DA-D4R or DA-D1R pathway or decreased stimulation
  of GABA-producing interneurons. ErbB4 signaling is required for GABA release, which
  is required for synchronizing synaptic function in glutamergic neurons. Decreased
  Nrg1-ErbB4 signaling in glutamergic neurons can have a direct impact on NR2 (NR2A
  and NR2B) phosphorylation via fyn and pyk2 activity, while increased Nrg1 may inhibit
  src-mediated phosphorylation of NMDARs. PSD-95 has a PDZ domain, which mediates
  binding of Src/fyn to the ErbB4 receptor.
