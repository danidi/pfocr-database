caption: Model outlining the roles of GAI/RGA-like GA-signaling components in the
  plant life cycle. In this study, we have shown that RGL2 links an environmental
  cue (moisture) with the GA-signaling pathway during the regulation of seed germination.
  Sequence similarity suggests that RGL3 may also regulate seed germination in response
  to GA. Signaling through GAI and RGA mediates GA-promoted stem elongation and leaf
  expansion (, ; ; ; ; this work). Signaling through GAI, RGA, and RGL2 may mediate
  GA-promoted flower and pollen development (; S.C. Lee, H. Cheng, and J. Peng, unpubl.).
  The activities of GAI, RGA, and RGL1 may well be modulated in response to environmental
  variables at stages other than seed germination, and possible variables are shown.
