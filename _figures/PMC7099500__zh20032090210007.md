caption: A schematic summary illustrating the main concept of the present work demonstrating
  that Pik3c3 plays a pivotal role in mediating nephron deficit-induced compensatory
  nephron hypertrophy (CNH). Specifically, using a mouse model of uninephrectomy (UNX)
  to induce a 50% nephron reduction, the present study provides the first definitive
  evidence showing that Pikc3c plays an indispensable role in regulating the degree
  of CNH by generating Pik3c3 hypomorphic mouse model. Our hypertrophy data indicate
  that the degree of UNX-induced CNH is tightly regulated by the expression level
  of Pik3c3. Together with our previous demonstration that phosphorylated ribosomal
  protein S6 (rpS6) is a downstream effector of the mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTORC1)-S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) signaling pathway mediating CNH (), our signaling
  data examining the level of rpS6 phosphorylation in the present study indicate that
  Pik3c3 functions upstream of the mTORC1-S6K1-rpS6 pathway mediating increased protein
  synthesis to drive the development of CNH.
