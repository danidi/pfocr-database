caption: Model for the inhibition of bradykinin-induced cPKCs translocation by gelsolin
  in PC10 cells. Tumour promotion mostly depended on the PKC signal transduction pathway
  via the route that activated PLCβ stimulated through a G-protein-coupled receptor.
  Gelsolin sequesters PIP2 and suppresses production of DAG and IP3 by PLCβ, and thereby
  translocation to membrane fraction and activation of cPKCs is inhibited. As the
  PLCβ/cPKCs pathway is critical for growth of lung cancer cells, and overexpression
  of gelsolin in PC10 cells results in the loss of tumorigenicty.
