caption: 'A condensed scheme of glycerol-3-phosphate metabolism in plants. Glycerol
  is phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) by glycerol kinase (GK; GLI1). G3P
  can also be generated by G3P dehydrogenase (G3Pdh) via the reduction of dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP). DHAP is derived from glycolysis via triosephosphate isomerase
  (TPI) activity on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Gld-3-P), or from the conversion of
  glycerol to dihydroxacetone (DHA) by glycerol dehydrogenase (Glydh) followed by
  phosphorylation of DHA to DHAP by DHA kinase (DHAK). G3Pdh isoforms are present
  in both the cytosol and the plastids (represented by the oval). GLY1 is one of the
  two plastidial G3Pdh isoforms that plays an important role in plastidial glycerolipid
  biosynthesis. In the plastids, G3P is acylated with oleic acid (18:1) by the ACT1-encoded
  G3P acyltransferase. This ACT1-utilized 18:1 is derived from the stearoyl-acyl carrier
  protein (ACP)-desaturase (SACPD)-catalyzed desaturation of stearic acid (18:0).
  The 18:1-ACP generated by SACPD either enters the prokaryotic lipid biosynthetic
  pathway through acylation of G3P or is exported out (dotted line) of the plastids
  as a coenzyme A (CoA)-thioester to enter the eukaryotic lipid biosynthetic pathway.
  Membranous fatty acid desaturases (FAD) catalyze desaturation of FAs present on
  membranous glycerolipids. Other abbreviations used are: GL, glycerolipid; FAS, fatty
  acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Lyso-PA, acyl-G3P; PA, phosphatidic
  acid; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol;
  SL, sulfolipid; DAG, diacylglycerol.'
