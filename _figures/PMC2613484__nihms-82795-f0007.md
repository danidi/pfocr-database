caption: LTαβ specifically regulates the proliferation of CD8α- DC subsets in the
  spleen through a LTβR-NIK-RelB-dependent pathway during homeostasis. LIGHT expression
  in activated T cells can also increase DC proliferation through LTβR. Signaling
  through HVEM-BTLA provides inhibitory signaling that limits LTαβ-dependent proliferation
  of the CD8α- DC subsets. HVEM-BTLA expression in DCs and in stromal cells contributes
  to limiting DC proliferation ().
