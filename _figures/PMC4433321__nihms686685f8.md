caption: 'Hypothetical involvement of glucokinase (GK) and therefore glucokinase activators
  (GKAs) in the preservation and growth promotion of pancreatic β-cells. The interaction
  between GK and protein factors governing apoptosis [(BCL-2, BCL-XL, BAD, BAK, BAX)
  the latter two proapoptotic factors situated furthest downstream in the pathway
  but not shown] is highlighted. The P-BAD/GK complex and its association with mitochondria
  is shown [,]. For more details on P-BAD formation and the targeting of the proapoptotic
  factor to mitochondria and the ER, see [,]. The glucose and thus GK dependency of
  glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), insulin and acetylcholine initiated signalling
  processes is sketched in. It is hypothesized that activation of these pathways and
  their enhancement by GKAs protects β-cells from proapoptotic diabetogenic factors
  and enhances β-cell replication or neogenesis. It is further speculated that persistent
  deviations of free intracellular calcium from a basal set point may favour apoptosis
  but that transient, perhaps oscillatory changes of calcium may be beneficial. Note
  that for simplicity’s sake, the well established PKA, EPAC and PKC signalling in
  insulin release is not shown. Selected abbreviations: Akt or PKB, protein kinase
  B; Ach, acetylcholine; BAD, P-BAD, BCL-2 and BCL-x, mediators of apoptosis and antiapoptosis;
