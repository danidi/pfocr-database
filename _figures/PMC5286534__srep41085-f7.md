caption: Palmitic acid (PA)-induced endothelial dysfunction is characterized by increased
  ROS production, decreased NO level and reduced eNOS phosphorylation. Treatment with
  metformin or liraglutide alone can prevent endothelial cells from the PA-induced
  dysfunction. Combination treatment with metformin and liraglutide has a synergistic
  effect on the PA-induced endothelial dysfunction. In addition, metformin upregulates
  GLP-1R and its downstream PKA signalling, which may account for its synergistic
  protective effects with liraglutide in the PA-impaired endothelial cells. Metformin
  may also activate PKA signalling in a GLP-1R-independent manner. The above effects
  of metformin are mediated via AMPK pathway. The red arrows denote our novel findings
  in the present study.
