caption: 'Therapeutic strategy for downregulation of excess inflammatory mucus to
  normal physiological mucus levels, using a small-molecule kinase inhibitor of MAPK13.
  Left box: Depiction of the formation of excess inflammatory mucus in airway disease
  based on IL-4 and/or IL-13 activation of the IL-13 receptor (IL-13R) with activation
  of STAT6 and MAPK13 that in turn drives expression of CLCA1, MUC5AC, and MAPK13
  for subsequent packaging into mucin granules as APECs differentiate into airway
  mucous cells. Right box: Depiction of the formation of normal physiological levels
  of airway mucus when the same pathway is downregulated with a MAPK13 inhibitor.
  APEC = airway progenitor epithelial cell; CLCA1 = chloride channel accessory 1;
  MAPK13 = mitogen-activated protein kinase 13; MUC5AC = mucin 5AC; SMKI = small-molecule
  kinase inhibitor; STAT6 = signal transducer and activator of transcription 6. Adapted
