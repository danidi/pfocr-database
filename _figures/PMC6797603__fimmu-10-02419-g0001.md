caption: NLRX1 regulates immune system signaling. The Nod-like receptor NLRX1 has
  many diverse, multifaceted roles in innate immune system signaling, and cellular
  localization plays a key role in determining NLRX1's function. Localized on and
  within the mitochondria, NLRX1 interacts with a multitude of pathways. NLRX1 interacts
  with the complex III associated protein UQCRC2 to promote the production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). ROS in turn activates the JNK pathway, which promotes apoptosis.
  NLRX1 attenuates MAVS signaling through disruption of RIG-I activation via interactions
  with poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2). This negatively regulates the production
  of IL-6, IFN-1, and possibly NLRP3 inflammasome formation. When associated with
  the mitochondrial immune signaling complex (MISC) and TUFM, NLRX1 promotes autophagy.
  Lastly, in the presence of TNF, NLRX1 interacts with Caspase-8 to induce TNF-induced
  apoptosis, and this interaction may inhibit Complex I and III of the Electron Transport
  Chain. In the cytosol, NLRX1 inhibits NF-κB signaling by interacting with IκB kinase
  (IKK). Likewise, cytosolic NLRX1 may promote TRAFasome formation, which in turn
  inhibits NF-κB signaling. Lastly, NLRX1 may also inhibit the MAPK pathway.
