caption: BAFF and APRIL signaling pathways in B cells. Soluble BAFF multimers or cell-bound
  APRIL multimers trigger recruitment of TRAF2, TRAF5 and TRAF6 to TACI, thereby activating
  an IKK complex that mediates phosphorylation of IκBα, followed by proteasomal degradation
  of IκBα. In the absence of IκBα, p50–p65 and p50c-Rel (not shown), NF-κB dimers
  translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they activate genes involved
  in Ig CSR and production. A TACI highly conserved (THC) domain also recruits MyD88
  similarly to TLR4 (expressed by mouse but not human B cells), TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9,
  which are receptors for microbial lipolpolysaccharide (LPS), single-stranded RNA
  and CpG-rich DNA. These TLRs are particularly abundant in B cells and recruit MyD88
  through a TIR domain. MyD88 signals from TACI and TLRs activate IKK through IRAK-1,
  IRAK-4, TRAF6, TAK-1, TAB-1 (TAK-1-binding protein 1), and TAB-2 (TAK-1-binding
  protein 2). Soluble BAFF trimers induce recruitment of TRAF3 to BAFF-R, followed
  by TRAF3 degradation through a mechanism involving interaction of TRAF3 with TRAF2
  and MALT1. In the absence of TRAF3, NIK elicits phosphorylation of p100, followed
  by processing of p100 to p52 and translocation of p52-RelB complexes from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus, where they activate genes involved in B cell survival. BAFF-R can
  also activate the canonical NF-κB pathway through a mechanism that remains unclear.
