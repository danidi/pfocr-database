caption: '(A) Tail-anchored membrane protein 3A by binding and modulating GBF1/Arf1
  promotes PI4KIIIβ recruitment to the membrane bilayer at the expense of coat protein
  COPI. Recruited PI4KIIIβ will catalyze the production of a PI4P lipid micro-environment
  (red lipids) that will in turn facilitate the recruitment of 3Dpol from the cytosolic
  pool to the membrane and promote the synthesis of viral RNA.(B) Uninfected (0 hr):
  Steady-state exchange of membranes, Golgi enzymes, and cargo through bidirectional
  trafficking between the ERGIC and Golgi/TGN compartments. Golgi enzymes and cargo
  are sorted out of Sar1/COPII-labeled ER exit sites into ERGIC compartments whereupon
  GBF1/Arf1 and COPI coats mediate the trafficking to and from the Golgi/TGN compartments.
  PI4KIIIβ enzymes are recruited to Golgi/TGN membranes by Arf1 and catalyze the production
  of PI4P lipids at these membranes.2 hr: Upon infection, newly synthesized viral
  replication enzymes such as the membrane-bound 3A target to and assemble on secretory
  organelle membranes but concentrate and initiate viral RNA synthesis on the Golgi/TGN
  membranes, where the pre-existing (i.e., prior to infection) steady-state pool of
  PI4P lipids facilitates viral replication protein assembly and RNA replication.
  Rising levels of 3A combined with its modulation of effector recruitment by GBF1/Arf1
  will enhance the recruitment of PI4KIIIβ over COPI, leading to a decreased rate
  of anterograde transport out of the ERGIC and subsequent disassembly of the Golgi/TGN
  organelles.4 hr: Enhanced recruitment of PI4KIIIβ over COPI results in the formation
  of uncoated PI4P lipid-enriched organelles adjacent to ER exit sites. The PI4P lipid-enriched
  microenvironment of these organelles facilitates the ongoing assembly of newly synthesized
  viral replication proteins such as RdRp 3Dpol and viral RNA replication.'
