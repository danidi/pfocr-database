caption: Potential mechanisms of lactate-BDNF interaction following physical exercise.
  Physical exercise is associated with intensity-dependent increase of lactate levels.
  Lactate can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via different monocarboxylate transporters
  (MCT‘s). Furthermore, lactate binding to the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor (HCAR1)
  at the BBB can induce angiogenesis. In neurons, lactate exerts several neurotrophic
  and metabolic effects through transmembrane transport via MCT’s and direct binding
  to HCAR1. Firstly, lactate binding to HCAR1 on neurons inhibits the adenylate cyclase
  (AC) and thus decreases cAMP, resulting reduced BDNF expression and regulatory function
  in the control of blood flow, and synaptic functions. Secondly, lactate can induce
  the PGC1α/FNDC5/BDNF pathway through SIRT1 activation. Thirdly, lactate increases
  intracellular NADH, resulting in enhanced calcium levels and BDNF gene expression.
  Released BDNF can then enhance neuroplasticity via different neurobiological mechanisms
  (e.g., neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, growth of dendritic spines, long-term potentiation
  [LTP]).
