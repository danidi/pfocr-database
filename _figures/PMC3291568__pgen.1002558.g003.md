caption: The top panels (A–D) represent the algorithm schema and the bottom panels
  (E–H) represent the corresponding steps with data for an example pathway, C8 production.
  Cyan, green, and purple are used to denote different experimental conditions (1,
  2, and 3 and CB, PD4, and PD14 for the schematic and the C8 pathway data, respectively).
  GC/MS total ion chromatograms (orange box, A & E) are used to generate compound
  co-occurrence profiles (red box, B & F). These compound co-occurrence profiles are
  used to group and order the compounds based on patterns of correlation and anti-correlation
  to build a possible biosynthetic pathway (brown box C & G). Genes for which the
  expression profile matches the compound profile are considered correlated and therefore
  likely candidates for the biosynthetic pathway of interest (gray box D & H). Retrosynthesis
  is then used to match correlated genes with a reaction in the pathway, represented
  by roman numerals denoted on pathway arrows (brown box, C&G).
