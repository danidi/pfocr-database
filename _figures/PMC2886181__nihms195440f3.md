caption: Levels of the isoprenoids ubiquinone, dolichol, dolichyl-phosphate (dolichyl-P)
  farnesyl- (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) were reported to be modified
  in AD brain. It is known for many years that the long-chain isoprenoid dolichol
  is decreased in post-mortem AD brain tissue, while dolichyl-P and ubiquinone are
  elevated. Recent data showed that FPP and GGPP levels were significantly higher
  in brain tissue of AD patients, while cholesterol levels were unchanged. These data
  indicate distinct alterations of isoprenoid metabolism within the mevalonate/isoprenoid/cholesterol
  pathway. FPP and GGPP play a fundamental role in prenylation of small GTPases, which
  function as molecular switches in various signaling pathways. In AD pathology, small
  GTPases have been connected with oxidative stress, the generation of Aβ and synaptic
  dysfunction (for details, please refer to the text).
