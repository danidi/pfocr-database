caption: ATF4 is activated by the perturbation of mitochondrial function. Perturbation
  of mitochondrial function induces ATF4 activation. Genetic alteration or inhibition
  of OxPhos enzymes increases ROS production, which may induce ATF4 activation. ATF4
  is also activated by the dysregulation of other metabolic pathways, such as reactive
  aldehyde accumulation by dominant negative ALDH2 expression or perturbed iron homeostasis
  by FXN deficiency. Mitophagy regulates mitochondrial quality control by eliminating
  damaged, depolarized mitochondria. Defects in mitophagy induce the accumulation
  of impaired mitochondria and ATF4 activation. An imbalance in mitochondrial- and
  nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins caused by mtDNA deletion or mitochondrial
  ribosome inhibition by doxycycline confers ATF4 activation. FXN, frataxin; OxPhos,
  oxidative phosphorylation.
