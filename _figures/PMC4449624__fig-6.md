caption: Different metabolic pathways lead to oxidative stress in dCM and HF. In dCM,
  hyperglycemia induces both oxPPP and polyol pathway activation while glycolysis
  is reduced due to completion by FFA. Increased reducing equivalents feed the overexpressed
  NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox) and uncoupled NOS, thus increasing ROS generation. In HF,
  glucose utilization by cardiomyocytes is increased due to concomitant downregulation
  of FFA catabolism. A pathologically higher fraction of glucose may then be utilized
  by the upregulated oxPPP, which provides NADPH for Nox and uncoupled NOS, thus increasing
  ROS generation. On the other hand, the polyol pathway might play a very minor role
  in this pathological condition. HF, heart failure.
