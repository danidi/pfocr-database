caption: miR-200a is implicated in the type I interferon signaling pathway. (Top)
  Type I interferon signaling pathway comprised of miR-200a targets; (bottom) expression
  changes of miR-200a and its targets associated with the type I interferon pathway
  in r1918-infected samples. Red represents microRNA or targets that have increased
  expression in r1918-infected samples, relative to Tx/91-infected samples. Green
  represents microRNA or targets that have decreased expression in r1918-infected
  samples, relative to Tx/91-infected samples.
