caption: Light signaling controls the abundance of chromatin modifiers and the homeostasis
  of histone marks. (A) Light signaling modulates the sub-cellular partitioning of
  HDA15, a histone deacetylase that tends to relocate to the nucleus in response to
  light. In darkness, low amounts of HDA15 retained in the nucleus could target specific
  light-induced genes through physical association with PIF3. Under light conditions
  the bulk of HDA15 proteins locate in the nucleus and can associate with NF-YC and
  HY5. (B) The availability of chromatin remodeler subunits is influenced by light
  conditions. PICKLE and BRAHMA are abundant in darkness whereas BAF60 is expressed
  and stabilized under light where it may antagonize PIF4 activity. Direct interactions
  with key TFs of the light-signaling pathway have been demonstrated for PICKLE (with
  HY5 and PIF3) and for BRAHMA (with PIF1). (C) The co-transcriptional H2Bub histone
  mark is more abundant over most genes in light than dark-grown seedlings. The C3D
  complex associates to non-acetylated histone H2B and controls the stability of a
  de-ubiquitination module (DUBm), notably through targeted ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic
  degradation in darkness. Modulation of H2Bub homeostasis over the epigenome may
  be related to dampened RNA Pol II activity in cotyledon nuclei in darkness.
