caption: Polarization and guidance in neurons. (A) Axon formation. The elongation
  of a single neurite to form an axon establishes a polarized neuron. In vivo this
  decision is guided by extracellular cues, but in vitro, stochastic changes in signalling
  activities at neurite tips, amplified by positive feedback loops, initiate axon
  formation. Several small GTPases localize to the tip of a presumptive axon. The
  proposed Rap1–Cdc42–Rac pathway is reminiscent of Rsr1–Cdc42–Rho in yeast polarization,
  although in the neurite, PI3 kinase seems to be the key downstream effector of Cdc42.
  It is capable of initiating a feedback loop through the generation of PIP3, a known
  activator of GEFs for Cdc42 and Rac. PI3 kinase is also a target of Ras and this
  too has been proposed to promote a feedback loop, probably through a Ras GEF. Changes
  in the dynamic behaviour of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons at the neurite
  tip initiate axon extension. Rac directly regulates the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons
  through effector proteins such a LIM kinase and PAK kinase, but in addition the
  Par6–aPKC polarity complex, a direct target of Cdc42, localizes to the presumptive
  axon tip to promote stabilization of microtubules. This involves inhibition of GSK-3
  leading to accumulation of APC at microtubule plus ends, though there is some uncertainty
  whether GSK-3 inhibition is direct (i.e. by phosphorylation) or indirect. (B) Axon
  guidance. A large number of extracellular cues are involved in guiding axons to
  their final destination. Both repulsive and attractive cues interact with the growth
  cone to influence the direction of elongation of axonal microtubules. They are thought
  to act by modifying the actin cytoskeleton in a spatially restricted manner within
  the growth cone causing it to turn towards or away from the source. In its simplest
  form, localized activation of Rho might be expected to lead to actomyosin-dependent
  retraction of the plasma membrane and induce turning away from a repellant, whereas
  activation of Rac or Cdc42 (↑) and inactivation of Rho (↓) could promote membrane
  protrusion and turning towards an attractant. Activation of GTPases can be achieved
  through activation of GEFs (↑) or inactivation of GAPs (↓). The situation is, however,
  clearly more complicated. Rac, for example, is activated during plexin-mediated
  repulsion, and the response to some repulsive cues can be reversed if the balance
  of cAMP and cGMP present within the growth cone is altered. Changes in cytosolic
  calcium seem to be essential for guidance signalling. A detailed understanding of
  these responses is lacking, but probably is dependent on the GEFs, GAPs and targets
  present in the growth cone of different neurons and their responsiveness to the
  different guidance cues encountered.
