caption: High throughput screening work flow in translational research. An assay developed
  to modulate a druggable target identified by basic research is optimized and adapted
  for screening large compound libraries. The screen actives are modified by medicinal
  chemistry and several lead series are developed. The lead molecules with sub-uM
  activity and reasonable selectivity are utilized as chemical probes to study a mechanism
  of action of the target or to dissect a pathway of interest. The leads can also
  serve as starting points for drug discovery which requires intense medicinal chemistry
  and ADME optimizations.
