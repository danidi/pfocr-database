caption: Cholesterol is metabolized to oxysterols after internalization via cell surface
  receptors (LDLR, scavenger receptors) or biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA via the mevalonate
  pathway. Oxysterols activate LXR transcription factors, and, along with cholesterol,
  inhibit the SREBP transcription factors. LXRs heterodimerize with RXR and induce
  target genes that promote cellular cholesterol efflux (e.g. ABCA1, ABCG1) and degradation
  of LDLR, thereby reducing intracellular cholesterol. SREBPs, activated during sterol
  deficit, promote sterol accumulation by inducing LDLR and many of the enzymes of
  the mevalonate pathway. Extracellularly, cholesterol is trafficked on lipoproteins.
  The liver produces and releases VLDL, which is modified into LDL, serving as the
  major vehicle for cholesterol delivery to peripheral tissues via its receptor, LDLR.
  Cellular cholesterol effluxed to lipoprotein acceptors (e.g., HDL) via ABCA1/ABCG1
  is ultimately taken up by the liver via SR-BI before conversion into bile acids
  for release in the feces, completing the pathway of ‘reverse cholesterol transport’.
  ABCA, ATP Binding Cassette; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDLR, low density lipoprotein
  receptor; LXR, liver X receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; SR-BI, scavenger receptor
  B-I; SREBP, sterol response element binding protein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein.
