caption: Schematic representation of proteins associated with neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.
  AD is a disease caused by a complex talk between various pathologies and proteins
  associated with them. For example, amyloidogenic processing of APP results in the
  secretion of one major form of Aβ, i.e., Aβ-40, along with few minor species containing
  42 or 43 amino acid residues, which later on gets aggregated in the brain . Increased
  Aβ accumulation in the brain enhances APP/Go protein complex formation, which then
  initiates Go-GβΥ complex signaling and as a result, irregular activation of the
  MPAK-p38 pathway causes neurotoxicity. MCP-1 is primarily expressed by glial cells,
  i.e., astrocytes and microglia. Astrocytes rapidly express MCP-1 in ipsilateral
  thalamus as a primary response to brain injury. Later on, MCP-1 acts as a potent
  chemoattractant for monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells, as a result,
  it initiates a cascade of secondary responses in inflammation and causes neurodegeneration
  through direct apoptosis. ILs are also secreted during various pathological processes
  and further enhance neuroinflammation, e.g., IL-1 activates T cells and other inflammatory
  mediators, which initiate an inflammatory response and activate p38-MAPK. With the
  initiation of inflammation, neutrophils and macrophages secrete IL-6, which in turn,
  facilitates the production of C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein further promotes
  inflammation and increases the production of Aβ-42. Despite this, ubiquilin-1 facilitates
  the accumulation of insoluble Aβ peptides by affecting BACE1 activity and via assisting
  presenilin 1 accumulation, which afterward, results in presenilin-dependent γ-secretase
  degradation of APP. Copper-related protein CutA also interferes with BACE1 activity
  and indirectly affects APP processing. In AD, iron levels have been found to be
  elevated and facilitating cognitive decline. Mitoferrin-1 is associated with iron
  homeostasis and its up-regulation contributes to the excessive accumulation of iron
  in mitochondria, resulting in increased mitochondria induced oxidative stress. Moreover,
  aggregation of alpha-synuclein as Lewy bodies is potentiated by ganglioside lipids,
  which results in increased alpha-synuclein-mediated oxidative stress, neurotoxicity,
  and ultimately neurodegeneration. From CNS, Aβ is cleared out via perivascular circulation
  and glymphatic pathway where P-glycoprotein and LRP-1 along with SORLA facilitate
  its transportation. Disrupted functioning of SORLA prevents Aβ clearance from the
  brain. Moreover, SORLA facilitates calpain mediated proteolytic degradation of synapsins
  and thus, potentiating impaired regulation of neurotransmitters release at synapsis.
  In addition, overactivation of calpain-2 puts restrictions to the extent of LTP
  and aids Aβ accumulation via supplementing the expression level of β-secretase.
  On the other hand, CIP2A and CDK5RAP2 facilitate hyperphosphorylation of tau protein;
  as a result, disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport causes neuronal death and
  NFTs. In addition, ApoE4’s isoform-specific interactions with tau, PrPC-induced
  neurotoxicity, and disrupted Gap43 activities (such as synaptic transmission, membrane
  permeability, neuronal growth, etc.) also cause an upsurge in NFTs level in the
  brain. However, the role of CSPGs is remained unexplored yet; they are also found
  abundantly in Aβ-plaques and NFTs. (A higher resolution / colour version of this
  figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).
