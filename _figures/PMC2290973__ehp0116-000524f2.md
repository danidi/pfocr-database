caption: 'Pathway Studio diagram of common regulators of differentially expressed
  genes. Genes with statistically significant expression differences were queried
  against the Pathway Studio ResNet 5.0 database to identify common regulators. Biological
  relationships are represented by red arrows for positive effects and green arrows
  for negative effects. Genes are represented by colored shapes: those with increased
  expression with high arsenic exposure are shown in red; those with decreased expression
  in response to high arsenic exposure are shown in green. Other genes that are directly
  involved in the pathway, but were not significantly modified at the gene expression
  level by arsenic exposure status, are shown in gray.'
