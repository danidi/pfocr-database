caption: Different molecular mechanisms account for autophagy pathway dysfunction
  in Huntington's disease (HD). In HD, a polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (polyQ-Htt)
  protein is produced and accumulates in cells. The misfoldedpolyQ-htt elicits an
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (A), and through direct inhibition of
  the ER-associated degradation pathway, impairment of ER-to-Golgi trafficking, and
  disruption of ER and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, polyQ-htt ultimately yields
  ER stress-induced activation of the macroautophagy pathway. PolyQ-htt can sequester
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), resulting in disinhibition of macroautophagy;
  however, macroautophagy functions abnormally in HD, because the mutant polyQ-htt
  protein prevents recognition and loading of cargo into developing autophagosomes,
  resulting in an accumulation of autophagic vesicles (AVs) that are relatively empty,
  in terms of substrates for degradation (B). Lysosomal enzyme activity is reduced
  in HD, possibly because of an increased burden of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  given that HD cells contain markedly increased numbers of lysosomes containing nondegradedlipofuscin
  (B). PolyQ-htt interacts excessively with Hsc70 and the lysosomal translocation
  machinery, resulting in diminished chaperone-mediated autophagy function in HD (C).
  As the amino-terminal fragment of polyQ-htt enters the nucleus, it has been shown
  to interfere with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α
  (PGC-1α), a transcriptional co-regulator, recently found to promote transcription
  factor E-B (TFEB) expression. Thus, polyQ-htt transcriptional dysregulation leads
  to impaired TFEB transactivation of its target genes, which encode the proteins
  and enzymes required for autophagosome assembly, autophagosome-lysosome fusion and
  lysosomaldegradative enzyme activity (D). Hence, polyQ-htt appears capable of undermining
  autophagy pathway function for two branches of autophagy (macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated
  autophagy), and can act through multiple mechanisms for macroautophagy inhibition.
