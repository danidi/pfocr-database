caption: Figure 1. Model of Helicobacter pylori-mediated contact with host protein
  receptors on epithelial and immune cells to trigger bacterial binding and/or downstream
  signal transduction events. The interplay between gastric epithelial and various
  types of immune cells with bacterial pathogenicity factors modulates multiple host
  responses during the course of infection as indicated. (A) H. pylori expresses several
  adhesins, some of which can bind to a host protein receptor. One example is the
  AlpA and AlpB adhesins binding to the matrix protein laminin. Attached H. pylori
  or those swimming in the mucus can secrete virulence factors into the medium including
  VacA and urease. VacA is a pore-forming toxin and can bind to various host surface
  receptors such as the RPTP tyrosine phosphatases. Internalization of VacA into cells
  leads to the formation of large vacuoles and gastric damage, a hallmark of the ulceration
  process. VacA can also trigger p38 MAP kinase activation, nuclear responses and
  mitochondria-associated apoptosis. (B) The H. pylori urease complex has an important
  function in buffering the acidic pH in the human stomach. However, urease B can
  also bind directly to the CD74 [MHC-II (class II major histocompatibility complex)-associated
  invariant chain] receptor on host cells, possibly activating the pro-inflammatory
  transcription factor NFκB and IL-8 release. Another receptor, CD46, acts as a bactericidal
  factor as it can bind to the urease A subunit and inhibits H. pylori urease activity.
  (C) After adherence, H. pylori can translocate effector molecules, such as CagA
  and peptidoglycan, into the host cell using a type IV secretion system (T4SS)-dependent
  process. Peptidoglycan binds to the intracellular receptor NOD1, activating transcription
  factors NFκB or IRF7 to stimulate the secretion of IL-8 or interferon-γ (IFNγ),
  respectively. (D) Injection of CagA requires various indicated T4SS pilus components
  and a host protein receptor, integrin β1. Since integrins are normally basolateral
  receptors, it is not yet clear if injection of CagA appears at apical or basolateral
  surfaces. However, injected CagA can interact with a number of host cell signaling
  molecules to trigger several signaling cascades as shown. For example, CagA can
  bind to PAR-1 and E-cadherin, possibly affecting cell polarity. CagA also contributes
  to sustained NFκB activity, inhibition of gastric acid production and cell elongation
  by targeting the actin-binding protein cortactin. (E) The H. pylori T4SS can also
  activate a number of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3
  and c-Met which play various roles as indicated. Some yet undefined inhibitory activities
  on EGFR activation and wound healing have been attributed to VacA. (F) H. pylori
  targets the glycoprotein receptor GP130 using CagA (phosphorylated by Src and Abl
  kinases) to activate signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) signaling.
  (G) A novel CagL→integrin αvβ5signaling complex was characterized to trigger gastrin
  expression. CagL can also bind to another integrin member, αvβ3, but the resulting
  downstream signaling is not yet clear. (H) Targeting of tight junctions and E-cadherin-based
  adherens junctions by the serine protease HtrA and CagA contribute to the disruption
  of the epithelial barrier. These events may cause leakage of nutrients into the
  gastric lumen and the ability of H. pylori to cross the epithelial layer by a paracellular
  pathway. H. pylori and bacterial antigens reach the lamina propria. For example,
  VacA can bind here to fibronectin in the extracellular matrix. (I) VacA also exhibits
  suppressive effects on immune cell function in vitro. VacA can interact with the
  integrin member β2 (CD18) on T-cells, which inhibits the transcription factor NFAT
  and IL-2 secretion, resulting in a blockade of T-cell activation and proliferation.
  Interestingly, it seems that CagA has some counteracting activities by activating
  NFAT via Ca2+-dependent calcineurin (Cn) signaling. (J) Urease B and VacA can also
  inhibit antigen presentation in B cells, possibly by interfering with antigen loading.
  (K) VacA was also reported to prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages by
  recruiting the coat protein TACO (coronin 1) and can block integrin-linked kinase
  (ILK) to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus supporting
  bacterial survival. (L) In addition, infection with H. pylori is accompanied by
  the formation of large homotypic aggregates of macrophages in a T4SS-dependent manner.
  This occurs through upregulation and recruitment of the intracellular adhesion molecule
  ICAM-1 to the cell surface, which then mediates aggregation via its ligand LFA-1,
  a signaling pathway that may regulate cell-cell interactions, inflammatory responses
  or inhibits bacterial uptake. (M) There are also various reports showing that H.
  pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can activate the toll-like receptors TLR2 and/or
  TLR4 to stimulate NFκB and innate immune responses. (N) Recent data suggest that
  the H. pylori T4SS can also induce the host inflammasome in mice, which is regulating
  important innate immune functions. This requires the cooperative interaction among
  host innate immune receptors TLR2, NOD2, and NLRP3 as important regulators of caspase-1
  and IL-1β activation in dendritic cells as indicated. For more details and references,
