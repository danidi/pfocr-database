caption: 'Diagram connecting the insulin pathway and fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis.
  Insulin resistance may lead to steatosis by inducing the expression and/or the maturation
  of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1, leading to the increased
  expression of the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and FA synthase (FAS). Insulin
  also inhibits FA β-oxidation by increasing malonyl-CoA, a potent inhibitor of carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase type 1 (CPT)-1, responsible for FA mitochondrial import. Conversely,
  intermediates in the triglyceride synthesis pathway may induce insulin resistance
  by activating inhibitors of insulin signaling, including protein kinase C (PKC)-ɛ,
  by phosphatidic acid (PA), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by diacyglycerol
  (DAG). Ceramides can inhibit Akt-mediated insulin signaling. FFA: free fatty acid,
  LPA: lysophosphatidic acid. Numbers refer to the bibliographic references.'
