caption: NAD+ biosynthesis pathways. In yeast cells, NAD+ can be made by salvaging
  precursors such as NA, NAM and NR or by de novo synthesis from tryptophan. Yeast
  cells also release and re-uptake these precursors. The de novo NAD+synthesis (left
  panel) is mediated by Bna proteins (Bna2,7,4,5,1) leading to the production of NaMN.
  This pathway is inactive when NAD+ is abundant. The NA/NAM salvage pathway (center
  panel) also produces NaMN, which is then converted to NaAD and NAD+ by Nma1/2 and
  Qns1, respectively. NR salvage (right panel) connects to the NA/NAM salvage pathway
  by Urh1, Pnp1 and Meu1. NR turns into NMN by Nrk1, which is then converted to NAD+
  by Nma1, Nma2 and Pof1. This model centers on NA/NAM salvage (highlighted with bold
  black arrows) because most yeast growth media contain abundant NA. Cells can also
  salvage NaR by converting it to NA or NaMN. For simplicity, NaR salvaging is not
  shown in this figure. Arrows with dashed lines indicate the mechanisms of these
  pathways remain unclear. NA, nicotinic acid. NAM, nicotinamide. NR, nicotinamide
  riboside. NaR, nicotinic acid riboside. QA, quinolinic acid. L-TRP, L-tryptophan.
