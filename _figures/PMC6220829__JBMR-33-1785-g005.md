caption: 'Upregulated nucleotide production and oxidative phosphorylation in Flcn‐deficient
  osteoclast precursors. Comprehensive metabolome analysis was performed on siRNA
  transfected Raw264.7 cells by CE‐TOF/MS. Cells were transfected with siRNA followed
  by RANKL stimulation (40 ng/mL) after 24 hours of transfection and harvested after
  an additional 48 hours of culture. Amount of each metabolite was adjusted by cell
  number. Open bars indicate data of scramble siRNA transfected cells and closed bars
  indicate Flcn targeted siRNA transfected cells. Y axis indicates amol/cell. Data
  represent means ± SD (n = 3, unpaired t test: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
  ****p < 0.0001). Metabolites, including PRPP, which are produced by pentose phosphate
  pathway, were elevated in Flcn‐deficient cells. Purine nucleotides and adenosine
  were dramatically elevated in Flcn‐deficient cells.'
