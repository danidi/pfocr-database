caption: The core components of the mammalian Hippo signalling pathway. When active
  (left) Mammalian Ste20-like kinases (MST kinases) phosphorylate Salvador (SAV1)
  and downstream MOB kinase activator 1 (MOB1) and Large tumour suppressor (LATS)
  kinases, leading to phosphorylation and degradation of Yes-associated protein (YAP).
  When upstream kinases are inactive (right), non-phosphorylated YAP resides in the
  nucleus and binds to transcription factors to promote pro-survival and anti-apoptotic
  gene transcription.
