caption: A. NOD2 activates the NF-κB pathway upon induction with MDP, resulting in
  the expression of α-defensins. NOD2 interacts with ATG16L, which leads to the secretion
  of α-defensins. Commensal bacteria remain distant from Paneth cells. B. CD mutant
  NOD2 has reduced activation of α-defensin expression. It is unable to recruit ATG16L,
  decreasing secretion of α-defensins. Harmful bacteria can invade the mucosal layer
  with decreased protection. C. The structure of NOD2-activating ligand MDP.
