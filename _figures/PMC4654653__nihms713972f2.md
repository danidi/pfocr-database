caption: There are two pathways responsible for bile acid (BA) synthesis in the liver.
  In the classic pathway, the rate-limiting step in BA formation is conversion of
  cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Multiple
  sequential steps that modify the steroid nucleus and side chain produce two primary
  BAs, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). The main enzymes in those
  modification steps are 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B7), sterol
  12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), Δ4-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase (AKR1D1), 3α-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase (AKR1C4), and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). Through the alternative
  pathway, cholesterol is converted into CDCA and the key enzymes involved are CYP27A1
  and 25-hydroxycholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1). Free primary BAs are conjugated
  through two reactions. First, using BA-CoA synthase (BACS), BA-CoA is generated.
  Next, BA-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) amidates BA-CoA with either a taurine
  or a glycine. In the intestines, 7α-dehydroxylation of CA and CDCA converts the
  primary BAs into secondary BAs including deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic
  acid (LCA), respectively. The known bacterial species possessing 7α-dehydroxylation
  activity are members of the Firmicutes phylum (Clostridium and Eubacterium) [].
  The taurine or glycine conjugated BAs are catalyzed by bile salt hydrolases (BSHs)
  to become free BAs. BSH can be detected in bacterial genera including Bacteroides,
  Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Listeria []. Free BAs can be oxidized
  by hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDHs). For example, CA can be converted into
  3-dehyhydrocholic acid, 7-dehyhydrocholic acid, and 12-oxochenodehydrocholic acid
  by 3α-HSDH, 7α-HSDH, and 12α-HSDH, respectively, and further converted into isocholic
  acid, 7-epicholic acid, and 12-epicholic acid by 3β-HSDH, 7β-HSDH, and 12β-HSDH,
  respectively. HSDHs are expressed by Firmicutes phylum members, including Eubacterium,
  Peptostreptococcus, and Ruminococcus []. BAs, bile acids; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase;
