caption: Metabolic pathway of aerobic glycolysis, FAS and FAO. CPTI can be inhibited
  directly by ACC2-generated malony-CoA, a crucial intermediate in FAS. This effect
  prevents FAS and FAO from being activated simultaneously. FAO also takes the long-chain
  fatty acids as raw materials, which are the products of FAS. FAO and aerobic glycolysis
  are both significant energy-supplying processes in cancer. Acetyl-CoA generated
  from FAO serves as an essential source of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), which
  can finally produce malate to supplement pyruvate
