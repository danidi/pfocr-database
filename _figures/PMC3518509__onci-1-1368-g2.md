caption: Figure 2. CD40 ligation regulates IL-21-induced differentiation of B cells
  into either plasma cells or granzyme B-secreting cells. Partial CD4+ T-cell activation.
  In the early phase of an immune response (0–3 d), a broad spectrum of low-affinity
  and partly self-reactive CD4+ T cells are present in a pre-activated state and secrete
  interleukin-21 (IL-21) but do not express CD40L. In this setting, B cells that are
  activated by specific B-cell receptor (BCR) crosslinking differentiate into granzyme
  B (GrB)-secreting B cells, owing to CD4+ T cell-derived IL-21 in the absence of
  CD40 ligation (right). Full CD4+ T-cell activation. In a later phase (> 5 d), upon
  additional co-stimulation by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the
  draining lymph nodes, antigen-specific T cells arrive at the site of inflammation
  in a fully activated state. Such CD4+ T cells express both IL-21 and CD40 ligand,
  supporting the differentiation of activated B cells into plasma cells (left).
