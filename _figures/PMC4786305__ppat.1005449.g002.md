caption: During viral infection, the host cell detects type I IFNs through the IFN
  receptor, activating the JAK-STAT pathway and up-regulating several interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs), one of which is the kinase PKR. Once activated by one of its ligands
  (dsRNA or PACT), a major function of PKR is to phosphorylate the host translation
  initiation factor eIF2α to cause translational arrest and global inhibition of both
  viral and host protein synthesis. However, the HSV γ34.5 protein binds the host
  phosphatase PP1α and retargets it to eIF2α for dephosphorylation and restoration
  of mRNA translation. Viruses mutant in only the two amino acids required for PP1α-binding
  are significantly attenuated for disease in models of encephalitis, disseminated
  disease, and HSV keratitis.
