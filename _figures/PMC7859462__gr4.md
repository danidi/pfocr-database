caption: Impact of 3′UTR APA on its target mRNA and protein. (A) Summary of potential
  consequences of 3′UTR alternative cleavage and polyadenylation on the affected mRNA
  and its encoded protein. (B) Long 3′UTRs contain more cis elements than short 3′UTRs,
  influencing both the stability and translation rate of the isoforms. The α pathway
  depicts the effect of cis elements such as miRNA binding sites in the long 3′UTR,
  promoting degradation of the lengthened isoform. The β pathway depicts the effect
  of 3′UTR shortening in increasing the miRNA binding efficiency in the middle region
  of the 3′UTR, thus decreasing the stability of the shortened isoform. In addition,
  some cis elements in the 3′UTR contribute to translation efficiency differences
  between transcripts bearing a longer or shorter 3′UTR. (C) Transcripts that undergo
  APA at the distal PAS remain in the soma of neurons, whereas those that use proximal
  PAS preferentially localize to neurites. (D) Cis-regulatory elements in 3′UTRs can
  direct the cellular localization of the encoded protein by altering interactions
  with RNA-binding proteins. The 3′UTR of the long isoform of CD47 can be bound by
  HuR and recruits SET to the translation site, facilitating the nascent CD47 protein
  to join active RAC1 and translocate to the plasma membrane.
