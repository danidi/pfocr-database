caption: Potential intrafollicular predictors and regulators of oocyte quality within
  the oocyte–somatic cell regulatory loop. Oocyte-secreted factors (GDF9, BMP15, FGF8B
  and other unknown factors) can act on the adjacent cumulus cells via SMAD2/3, SMAD1/5/8
  or other pathways to induce the expression of genes from a variety of categories
  (e.g. cumulus expansion-related genes Has2 and Ptgs2). Some of the markers may be
  indirect and reliable parameters to assess oocyte competence. The oocyte-produced
  factors can regulate numerous cumulus cell functions such as cumulus expansion,
  apoptosis, metabolism (glycolysis and cholesterol synthesis), and these functions
  are critical in the development of oocyte competence. It is unclear whether oocyte-secreted
  factors can signal through autocrine pathway to regulate oocyte function. GDF9,
  growth differentiation factor 9; BMP15, bone morphogenetic protein 15; FGF8B, fibroblast
  growth factor 8B; Has2, hyaluronan synthase 2; Ptgs2, prostaglandin-endoperoxide
  synthase 2; Grem1, gremlin 1.
