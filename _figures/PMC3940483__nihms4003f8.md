caption: '(a) Mutating the c-Kit receptor at the Wv locus lead to a down-regulation
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway via reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, which resulted
  in enhanced active Gsk3β and increased inhibition of Pdx-1 and cyclin D1 expression.
  (b) Direct inhibition of active Gsk3β with 1-AKP preserved β-catenin protein level,
  along with maintained cyclin D1 and Pdx-1 expression that allowed improvement of
  β-cell proliferation and function and prevented the onset of diabetes in c-Kit Wv/+
  mice. “+”: enhanced; “−”: reduced; “↓”: stimulation; “⊥” inhibition.'
