caption: CRLs represent the largest subfamily of RING finger domain E3 ligases. These
  multisubunit ligases consist of a core cullin protein tightly associated with the
  RING finger domain–containing protein RBX1/2. Various interchangeable adaptor and
  receptor components facilitate diverse substrate recognition. The cullin protein
  must be modified by NEDD8 to activate holoenzyme ubiquitin ligase activity. Neddylation,
  similar to ubiquitination, is initiated by a specific E1 for NEDD8, NAE. NAE utilizes
  ATP to form NEDD8 adenylate; the NEDD8 is subsequently transferred to a specific
  cysteine within NAE, forming a NAE-NEDD8 thioester before transthiolation to the
  active site cysteine of UBC12 or UBE2F, E2s specific for the NEDD8 pathway. Conjugation
  of NEDD8 to cullin activates the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CRL, and removal
  of NEDD8 by the COP9 signalosome facilitates dissociation of CRL components. Unneddylated
  cullin-RING complexes bind to CAND1 until recruited to form a new CRL. The NAE-specific
  inhibitor MLN4924 forms a covalent adduct with NEDD8 in a reaction catalyzed by
  NAE, locking the enzyme in an inactive state.
