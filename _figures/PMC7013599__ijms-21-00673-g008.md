caption: The glycerol-induced resistance pathway. Upon Bgt infection, the TaGLI1 and
  TaSSI2 were induced, and TaACT1 was reduced, which might contribute to G3P and OA18:1
  accumulation. G3P accumulation might be an active defense process; OA18:1 accumulation
  might be not good for plant resistance. Exogenous application of glycerol increased
  the G3P levels and decreased the level of OA18:1. Glycerol induced some genes involved
  in JA synthesis (e.g., LOX, AOS, and OPRs), then induced the JA level. Glycerol
  reduced IAA and induced SA levels with cross-talk of plant hormones. Glycerol induced
  ROS accumulation, PR and Hsp90 genes expression, and cell death, then contributed
  resistance to Bgt in wheat.
