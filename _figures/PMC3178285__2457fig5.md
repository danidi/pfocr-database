caption: Proposed signaling of TNF-α− and leptin-induced EL upregulation in primary
  placental ECs. TNF receptor (TNFR) can induce NF-κB–related gene expression via
  TNF receptor type 1–associated death domain protein (TRADD) and receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIP), as well as via TNF receptor–associated factor
  2 (TRAF2)/NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK) (). Extracellular signal–related kinase (ERK)-1/2
  can be activated by TNF receptor via MAP kinase activating death domain (MADD) ()
  or via TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (). The leptin receptor (LEPR) can induce
  ERK1/2 activation via protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (SHP2)/growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and/or NF-κB–related gene expression by insulin
  receptor substrate (IRS)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB)
  signaling (). Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling by UO126 had no effect on TNF-α− and
  leptin-induced upregulation of the EL gene (LIPG) expression, whereas the NF-κB
  inhibitor BAY completely abolished TNF-α−induced EL upregulation. BAY only in part
  (not significantly) block leptin-induced EL upregulation in primary placental ECs,
  suggesting that another pathway is involved.
