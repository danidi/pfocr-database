caption: Autophagy (or macroautophagy) is a catabolic process in which double membrane
  vesicles called autophagosomes sequester and degrade organelles, proteins, and other
  cytoplasmic constituents in response to cellular stress. The autophagic pathway
  consists of several steps, including nucleation and sequestration of a phagophore,
  formation of an autophagosome, and its fusion with a lysosome to form an autolysosome.
  Initiation and nucleation of the autophagophore begins when several proteins, including
  ULK1 and Beclin-1, which are inhibited by mTORC1 activity and BCL-2 respectively.
  BNIP3, a hypoxically induced protein, displaces Beclin 1 from BCL-2. After nucleation,
  several ATG proteins are involved in the conjugation of phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) to LC3, to form LC3-II. LC3-II is necessary for autophagic membrane expansion,
  recognition of autophagic cargo, and the fusion of lysosomes to autophagosomes.
  Another hypoxically induced protein, BNIP3L, is involved in sequestering mitochondria
  to the autophagosome. p62 functions as an autophagy cargo receptor, which is ultimately
  degraded when autolysosome forms. Severe hypoxia (<.01% O2) can also activate autophagy
  in a HIF-independent mechanism through the UPR. Once the autophagosome has formed,
  it fuses with a lysosome to generate an autolysosome, leading to the degradation
  of the products inside. Autophagy can also modulate HIF-1α levels as well. Chaperone-mediated
  autophagy proteins HSC70 and LAMP2A traffic HIF-1α to lysosomes, where it is subsequently
  degraded.
