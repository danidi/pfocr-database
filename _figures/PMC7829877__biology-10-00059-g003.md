caption: 'Life cycle of CX26: CX26 can be co-translated and trafficked through the
  secretory route (standard life cycle). It can also be post-translationally incorporated
  into ER microsomes and trafficked by Golgi-independent pathway (alternative CX26
  life cycle). GJIC mediated communication is indicated between cells and paracrine
  signalling permitting ATP release indicated via the open hemichannels.'
