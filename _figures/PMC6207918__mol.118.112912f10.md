caption: TGF-β/ALK1 signaling at the BBB and regulation of the Slco1a4 gene. Based
  on data presented in this study, we propose that the ALK1 receptor is activated
  by BMP-9, which proceeds to phosphorylate substrate signal transducing proteins
  in the cytoplasm (i.e., Smad1/5/8). Activated Smad1/5/8 forms a heterotrimeric complex
  consisting of two pSmad1/5/8 and the common Smad (i.e., Smad4) and then translocates
  into the nucleus where it binds the SBE in the Slco1a4 gene promoter to induce transcription.
  This represents a novel mechanism that can be targeted pharmacologically to control
  CNS drug delivery at the BBB. Furthermore, this pathway can inform future studies
  aimed at developing novel strategies for treatment of neurologic diseases such as
  ischemic stroke.
