caption: miRNAs control inflammatory response in ECs. miRNAs control the expression
  of inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL1, predominantly indirectly by regulating
  expression of signaling molecules of the NF-κB pathway. miR-103 and miR-92a target
  NF-κB inhibitor KLF2 & KLF4 and increase CCL2 and CXCL1 expression in ECs. miR-181-b
  inhibits the NF-κB mediated CXCL1 expression by suppressing the expression of importin-alpha3.
