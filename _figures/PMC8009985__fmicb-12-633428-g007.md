caption: The spearman correlations between N-transformation pathways (A), as well
  as between environmental factors and N-transformation pathways (B), were depicted
  using Cytoscape. Environmental factors that shaped nitrogen cycle significantly
  (p < 0.05) are shown on pathway level (C) or gene level (D) for natural biocrusts
  with forward selection of RDA. For network (A,B), the connection stands for a significant
  spearman correlation (p < 0.001), and the edge width is proportional to the magnitude
  of correlation coefficient (|r|). EC, electrical conductivity; WC, water content;
  Eh, redox potential; DON, dissolved organic nitrogen; DOC, dissolved organic carbon;
  BC, biomass carbon.
