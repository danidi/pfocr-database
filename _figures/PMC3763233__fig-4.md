caption: The enzymatic reactive oxygen species (ROS)-detoxifying mechanisms in plant
  chloroplasts are dependent on metal-based reactions. In plant chloroplasts, ROS
  homeostasis mainly relies on a core machinery in which metalloenzymes are pivotal
  (triangle). Fe- and Cu-dependent enzymes are depicted with black-lined symbols.
  The superoxide ion produced through the photosynthetic activity is converted into
  molecular oxygen and H2O2 by SODs. SODs found in plant chloroplasts are all dependent
  on Fe or Cu cofactors. H2O2 is then subsequently reduced to water (H2O). The enzyme
  APX requires AsA and generates monodehydroascorbate (MDA). The enzyme glutathione
  peroxidase (GPX) requires GSH and generates glutathione disulphide (GSSG). The Fe-dependent
  APX is thought to be the major pathway used by plants for H2O2 removal. The catabolism
  of H2O2 through these cycles is described as the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. The
  regeneration of the reducing power (AsA and GSH) is allowed by the cyclic transfer
  of reducing equivalents (peripheric cycles). Within the chloroplast, MDA can be
  directly reduced to AsA by the MDA reductase (MDAR). MDA (two molecules) can also
  be spontaneously converted into AsA and dehydroascorbate (DHA). DHA is then reduced
  to AsA by the action of the DHA reductase (DHAR), using GSH as the source of reducing
  equivalents. The GSSG produced by both pathways is further reduced back to GSH using
  the NADPH as an ultimate electron donor, a reaction catalyzed by the glutathione
  reductase (GR). Oxidized and reduced forms for each molecule are indicated.
