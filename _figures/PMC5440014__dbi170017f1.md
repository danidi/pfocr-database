caption: The COX-2/PGE2/EP3/Gi/o/cAMP/GSIS pathway in the β-cell. The mechanism for
  IL-1β stimulation of PGE2synthesis is via increasing COX-2 mRNA and protein levels,
  which in the presence of AA increase synthesis of PGE2, which in turn binds to its
  receptor EP3. The postreceptor mechanism of action for EP3 is mediated by an increase
  in Gi/o activity, which in turn decreases intracellular cAMP levels with a consequent
  decrease in GSIS. When EPA rather than AA is the dominantly available substrate,
  PGE3 rather than PGE2synthesis is favored. PGE3 has only one-tenth of the PGE2 efficacy
  to decrease GSIS (). NS-398 and SC-236 are COX-2 inhibitors. Misoprostol is an EP3
  agonist. Information taken from Robertson et al. (), Tran and colleagues (,), and
  Seaquist and colleagues (,). IκB, inhibitor of κB; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB.
