caption: Under [1], melanocytes are exposed to stressors that [2] compromise their
  physiology and lead to generation of ROS. [3] Melanocytes secrete/release HSP70
  (in part chaperoning melanocyte-specific antigens) which [4] activates DC that migrate
  to skin-draining lymph nodes to [5] recruit CD4 and, particularly, CD8 T cells which
  [6] kill remaining melanocytes by the perforin/granzyme pathway. We propose to [7]
  apply mutant HSP70iQ435A to block HSP70 from activating and perpetuating autoimmunity
  and associated depigmentation, allowing [8] melanocyte stem cells to differentiate
  and migrate to depigmented areas of the skin during repigmentation.
