caption: Biosynthesis pathway of BSH and BSH-dependent detoxification. In the BSH
  synthesis pathway of Bacillus subtilis, the glycosyltransferase BshA first adds
  GlcNAc to malate-producing GlcNAc-Mal. Then, the paralog N-deacetylases BshB1 and
  BshB2 catalyze deacetylation of GlcNAc-Mal, and BshC adds cysteine (presumably in
  an unidentified activated form) to GlcN-Mal, producing BSH. Detoxification of toxins,
  xenobiotics, or electrophiles involves their conjugation with BSH by the BSH-S-transferase
  BstA, generating BS-conjugates that are cleaved by the deacetylase BshB2 (Bca) to
  CysS-conjugates and GlcN-Mal used for BSH recycling. The CysS-conjugates are exported
  from the cells as mercapturic acid derivatives. In S. aureus, only one BshB-like
  enzyme is present that functions both as deacetylase and amidase and is essential
  for BSH biosynthesis.
