caption: The molecular mechanism by which miR-134 aggravates atherogenesisMiR-134
  downregulates ANGPTL4 expression by directly binding to the 3′UTR of ANGPTL4, leading
  to increased expression and activity of LPL. LPL then interacts with LRP1 to form
  a protein complex. The LPL/LRP1 complex promotes lipid accumulation and the inflammatory
  response, both of which accelerate atherosclerosis development.
