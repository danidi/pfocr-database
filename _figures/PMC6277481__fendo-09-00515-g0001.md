caption: Genetics and molecular pathways for PPGLs Pathways for the New Genes; Placing
  the New into Perspective. Mutations of the highlighted genes have been discovered
  to play a role in the pathogenesis of PPGL. These genes can be classified in cluster
  1, 2, or 3. Cluster 1 would be implemented with FH, MDH2, PHD1 (EGLN2), EPAS1/HIF2A
  and the most recently discovered IRP1 that controls cellular iron metabolism and
  negatively regulates HIF2α mRNA translation. Cluster 2 would include H-RAS and ATRX,
  which belongs to the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling proteins, as their upregulation
  will activate the RAS/RAF/ERK signaling pathway resulting in tumor formation. Finally,
  cluster 3 would be implemented with both CSDE1 and UBFT fusion at MAML3. Alterations
  of any of this genes will result in increase of target genes involved in Wnt receptor
  and Hedgehog signaling pathways.
