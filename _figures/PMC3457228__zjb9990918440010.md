caption: Cellular products dependent on FabY (i.e., FabH-type) activity in P. aeruginosa
  PAO1. The β-acetoacetyl-ACP product of FabY is used as a primer for elongation by
  the FAS elongation machinery, whose products are directly incorporated into a multitude
  of essential cell components, cofactors, and quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecules.
  Some exoproducts, including rhamnolipids, are dependent on fatty acid precursors
  as well as being subject to transcriptional QS regulation. Molecular fragments originating
  from FabY enzymatic activity are shown in bold type (blue, red, or green). The depicted
  biotin pathway in P. aeruginosa PAO1 is based on the proposed bioC and/or bioH pathway
  of E. coli (). E2, (α)-ketoacid dehydrogenase subunit E2-containing lipoylation
  domain.
