caption: The cycle of cullin-RING ligase activation. 1, the KEAP1-dependent E3 ubiquitin
  ligase consisting of KEAP1, CUL3, and RBX1 binds to both the substrate, NRF2, and
  an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. 2, neddylation by Nedd8 (N8) of CUL3 induces
  a conformational change in the complex such that the ubiquitin-bound E2 is able
  to transfer the ubiquitin to an acceptor lysine within NRF2. 3, after multiple rounds
  of ubiquitination, the polyubiquitinated NRF2 becomes a substrate for degradation
  by the proteasome. In the absence of NRF2, the KEAP1-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase
  becomes a target for deneddylation, and thus inactivation, by COP9. 4, the deneddylated
  CUL3 is then bound by CAND1, which promotes the formation of new E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complexes, and the cycle of ubiquitination can begin again.
