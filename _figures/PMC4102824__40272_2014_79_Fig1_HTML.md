caption: Flow diagram of the monoamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis pathway. The
  initial substrates for dopamine and serotonin synthesis are aromatic amino acids
  tyrosine and tryptophan that enter the brain via the large neutral amino acid transporter.
  They are hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)
  to levodopa (l-dopa) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), respectively, and are both
  subsequently decarboxylated by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) to yield
  the active neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. AADC activity is dependent
  on its cofactor pyridoxal 5 phosphate. Dopamine and serotonin are further catabolized
  by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) to form 3-methyl
  4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and homovanillic acid (HVA) from dopamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
  acid (5-HIAA) from serotonin. These are the stable metabolites measured in the cerebrospinal
  fluid for neurotransmitter analysis, and are often the key to diagnosis of a childhood
  monoamine neurotransmitter disorder. l-dopa is metabolised by COMT to 3-OMethyldopa
  (3-OMD) and then Vanillactic acid (VLA). Both tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan
  hydroxylase activity require the co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Therefore
  enzymatic deficiencies in the pterin synthesis pathway that affect the levels of
  this essential cofactor will lead to reduced levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters.
  BH4 is synthesized in four steps from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that are dependent
  on the enzyme activity of guanine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH 1), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydrobiopterin
  synthase (PTPS), aldose reductase (AR), and sepiapterin reductase (SPR). The major
  site of regulation of BH4 biosynthesis is at the level of GTP cyclohydrolase. After
  coupling as an active co-factor to the aromatic amino hydroxylases (tyrosine and
  tryptophan hydroxylase), BH4 is regenerated through oxidation by tetrahydrobiopterin-4α-carbinolamine
  to form quinoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2) and is subsequently converted back to the
  active co-factor by dihydrobiopteridine reductase (DHPR). The biogenic amines are
  illustrated in blue boxes, with the sites of enzyme or cofactor deficiency leading
  to neurotransmitter disorder highlighted in red boxes with corresponding key for
