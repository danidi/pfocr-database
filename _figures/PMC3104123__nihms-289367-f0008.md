caption: (a) Two-step scheme for metabolically engineering a cell surface with complementary
  chemical properties to bind to a custom-designed tissue engineering scaffold, as
  described in more detail in panels (b) and (c). (b) In the first step, chemical
  functional groups – thiol groups situated at the N-acyl position of the ManNAc analog
  Ac5ManNTGc – are metabolically incorporated into the sialic acid pathway and replace
  Neu5Ac (the natural form of sialic acid most commonly found on human cells) with
  the thiolated Sia5TGc (ThioGlycolyl) form of this sugar. (c) In the second step,
  the thiolated cells are incubated with a chemically compatible biomaterial – in
  this case PES. As negative controls, neither unmodified PES (i) or animated surfaces
  (ii) were expected to bind the metabolically engineered cells. By contrast, bio-orthogonal
  bonds form between the thiolated sialic acids found on the cell surface and (iii)
  gold coated or (iv) malemide-derivatized surfaces promote new modes of carbohydrate-based
  cell adhesion.
