caption: 'Phloroglucinol (PG) is synthesized by the type III polyketide synthase PhlD
  in the DAPG biosynthetic pathway, and processed into PG-Cl and PG-Cl2 by the halogenase
  PltM encoded in the pyoluteorin gene cluster. The PG-Cl and PG-Cl2 putatively bind
  to regulator PltR and induce transcription of pyoluteorin biosynthetic genes and
  prompt production of pyoluteorin. In these two pathways, the final products (DAPG
  and pyoluteorin), the biosynthesis intermediate (PG) and its derivatives (PG-CL,
  PG-Cl2) can be released and used by bacteria and function as cell-cell communication
  signals.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22835.032'
