caption: In homeostasis, TGF-β signals regulate key processes in multiple tissues
  including their growth, regeneration and identity. In the immune system, TGF-β instructs
  tolerance and suppresses inflammation. This function is particularly relevant in
  the gastrointestinal tract. Center. Genetic alterations can modify the output of
  TGF-β signals in tumor initiating cells. During the initial stages of carcinogenesis,
  TGF-β operates as main tumor suppressor by imposing cytostatic and apoptotic programs
  in tumor cells. A proinflammatory environment fosters the onset of cancer. Loss
  of TGF-β signals in the microenvironment contributes to exacerbate inflammation
  in this context. Secretion of pro-survival factors and cytokines by stromal and
  immune cells pushes continuous regeneration in a harsh inflammatory environment,
  which eventually leads to the onset of cancer. Right. During tumor progression,
  selective pressure promotes loss of the cytostatic and tumor suppressor function
  of TGF-beta in cancer cells. In general, this process occurs via two distinct mechanisms.
  Acquisition of loss of function mutations in TGF-beta pathway components renders
  tumor cells resistant to TGF-β thus enabling growth in a TGF-β-rich environment
  present in many advanced cancers. Alternatively, TGF-beta signals are reinterpreted
  in cancer cells to instruct tumor-promoting functions such as the ability to migrate
  and colonize foreign organs. In the TME of several prevalent tumor types, TGF-β
  operates as central mechanism of immune evasion.
