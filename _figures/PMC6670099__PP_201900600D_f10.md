caption: The role of PLIP1 in TAG biosynthesis during development of wild-type (WT)
  and dgat1 seed. The top depicts an overview of TAG biosynthesis in wild-type seed;
  the bottom depicts the modified pathway in dgat1 seed. The bold arrows indicate
  increases in flux in the different seed. In wild-type seed, TAG is synthesized primarily
  through the acyl-CoA-dependent acylation of DAG by DGAT1. Polyunsaturated fatty
  acids (PUFA) are synthesized by FAD2 and FAD3 in the ER and incorporated into DAG
  through the action of PDCT. The plastid-localized lipase PLIP1 plays a minor role
  in the incorporation of PUFAs into PC by releasing 18:3 from 18:3/16:1-PG. In dgat1-1
  seed, PDAT1 is responsible for the synthesis of TAG in the absence of DGAT1. Increased
  expression of the desaturases FAB2, FAD2, and FAD3 result in more polyunsaturated
  substrate for PDAT1. Upregulation of LPCAT2 also allows the regeneration of PC for
  the synthesis of TAG. In addition, PLIP1 is upregulated to increase the flow of
  18:3 to PUFA-PC pool, thereby increasing the flux of PUFAs for incorporation into
  TAG via PDAT1.
