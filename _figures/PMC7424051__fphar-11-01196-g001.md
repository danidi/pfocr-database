caption: The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and the mode of action of potential therapeutic
  molecules. SARS-CoV-2 enters target cells through an endosomal pathway. The S protein
  of the virus binds to cellular receptor ACE2. Following the entry of the virus into
  the host cell, the viral RNA is unveiled in the cytoplasm. ORF1a and ORF1ab are
  translated to produce pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, which are cleaved by the proteases
  that are encoded by ORF1a to yield non-structural proteins that form the RNA replicase-transcriptase
  complex. The polymerase produces a series of subgenomic mRNAs by discontinuous transcription
  and finally translated into relevant viral proteins. Viral nucleocapsids are assembled
  from genomic RNA and N protein in the cytoplasm, followed by budding into the lumen
  of the ERGIC. Virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis.
  ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, ER-Golgi
  intermediate compartment. Drugs with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity are depicted
  on the corresponding stage of the virus life cycle which they are thought to interfere
  with.
