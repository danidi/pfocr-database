caption: 'Proposed corrinoid synthesis and cobinamide salvage pathways in the Thermotogales.
  The color box indicates that the Thermotogales group contains a protein homolog,
  whereas an empty box indicates no protein homolog. Thermotogales groups: Thermosipho
  group (Ts. melanesiensis, Ts. africanus TCF52B and H1760334, black); Thermotoga/P.
  mobilis/M. prima (Tt. maritima, Tt. RQ2, Tt. cell2, Tt. naphthophila, Tt. neapolitana,
  Tt. petrophila, P. mobilis, M. prima, light blue), Tt. lettingae (dark blue), Tt.
  thermarum (light green), F. nodosum (red), and K. olearia (yellow). Reactions using
  archaea-derived proteins are indicated by pink arrows. In Thermosipho species, the
  B12 de novo pathway is broken into two gene clusters that encode corrinoid synthesis
  and cobinamide salvage. Corrinoid synthesis consists of three parts: cobyrinate
  synthesis (from sirohydrochlorin to cobyrinate), siroheme synthesis (from glutamate
  to siroheme/sirohydrochlorin), and a cobalt ABC transporter for importing cobalt.
  The final steps in B12synthesis can also be used to salvage cobinamides. CM, cytoplasmic
  membrane; Cbi, cobinamide; AdoCbi, adenosylcobinamide; AdoCbi-P, adenosylcobinamide
  phosphate; AdoCbi-GDP, adenosylcobinamide guanosine diphosphate; Cbl, cobalamin;
  AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; Cby, cobyric acid; AdoCbr, adenosylcobyrinic acid; AdoCby,
  adenosylcobyric acid; Thr-P, threonine phosphate; AP-P, aminopropanol phosphate;
  a-R-P, α-ribazole; DMB, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole; a-DAD, α-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole
  adenine dinucleotide; Cbr, cobyrinic acid; Cbr(II), cob(II)yrinate a,c-diamide;
  Cbr(I), cob(I)yrinate a,c-diamide; Siro, sirohydrochlorin. Proteins that have been
  identified in other microbes but have no homologs in the Thermotogales genomes are
  indicated by question marks. The reaction pathways were predicted based on evidence
  from other microbes (; ; ).'
