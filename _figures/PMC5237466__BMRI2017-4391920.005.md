caption: Potential mechanism of UA-induced inflammation in endothelial cell. High
  uric acid stimulates the RAGE signaling pathway and activates NF-κB, which results
  in the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines, including the expression
  and extracellular release of HMGB1 in endothelial cells. As a high affinity ligand
  of RAGE, HMGB1 interacts with RAGE and contributes to the amplification of the inflammatory
  response and finally induces endothelial dysfunction. Blockade of RAGE by anti-RAGE
  antibody can suppress the HMGB1/RAGE signaling pathway, therefore alleviating endothelial
  dysfunction.
