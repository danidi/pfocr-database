caption: 'Bone remodeling cycle. Bone remodeling is initiated by microcracks or changes
  in mechanical loading and consists of four consecutive steps: activation, resorption,
  reversal, and formation. Activation of osteoclasts is controlled through the RANK/RANKL/OPG
  pathway. Following bone deposition, osteoblasts can differentiate to osteocytes
  (osteocytogenesis), turn to bone-lining cells, or enter apoptosis.'
