caption: Signalling pathways involved in isolated and syndromic Hirschsprung's disease.
  The figure shows the three main developmental pathways involved in the normal enteric
  nervous system development and in isolated and syndromic Hirschsprung's disease.
  The RET pathway interacts in humans and mice with the endothelin pathway but not
  with transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. EDNRB (endothelin receptor type
  B) acts as a modifier in Dom SOX10 mutant mice. This study shows that RET interacts
  with PHOX2B in CCHS patients. Conversely, no genetic interaction could be found
  in MWS. CCHS, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome; MWS, Mowat‐Wilson syndrome.
