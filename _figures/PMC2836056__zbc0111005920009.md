caption: Schematic representation of pathways affected by cyclic strain causing inhibition
  of migration of AECs. After injury, signals from integrin receptors in the extracellular
  matrix activate two signaling pathways, one that leads to phosphorylation of FAK
  and one that leads to activation of Rac via activation of PI3K. Both lead to phosphorylation
  of JNK and thus to cell migration. Both pathways may be down-regulated by cyclic
  mechanical stretch, and loss of either pathway slows cell migration.
