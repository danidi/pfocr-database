caption: 'Canonical Notch signaling pathway. Notch signaling is initiated by cell-to-cell
  contact allowing for interaction of Notch receptors and ligands. There are 3 major
  cleavage processes: S1 cleavage occurs in the trans-Golgi when a Furin-like convertase
  cleaves Notch receptors to produce heterodimeric receptors. Then, Notch receptors
  are transported to the cell surface of the receiving cell. When the extracellular
  domain of Notch receptor combines with its ligand, the Notch receptor is cleaved
  by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), ADAM17
  or TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) metalloprotease in S2 cleavage site, releasing
  an extracellular fragment. Afterwards, the remnant receptor is cleaved again by
  the γ-secretase complex in its transmembrane domain at S3 cleavage site, releasing
  the active intracellular domain of Notch (ICN). ICN translocates to the nucleus
  of the receiving cell and binds to the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL (CBF1/RBPJ-kappa/Su
  (H)/Lag1). Thereafter, ICN competitively replaces the co-repressor (CoR) followed
  by the recruitment of the co-activator mastermind-like 1(MAML) to form a complex,
  initiating the transcription of CSL-dependent Notch target genes.'
