caption: 'Cell cycle pathway in the target list of hsa-miR-181a-5p, based on TarBase
  6.0.Notes: hsa-miR-181a-5p can regulate a number of important proteins that control
  the cell cycle. Control of eukaryotic cell growth and division involves molecular
  circuits known as “checkpoints” that ensure proper timing of cellular events. Passage
  through a checkpoint from one cell cycle phase to the next needs a coordinated set
  of proteins that monitor cell growth and DNA integrity. Uncontrolled cell division
  or propagation of damaged DNA can contribute to genomic instability and tumorigenesis.
  The G1/S checkpoint controls progression of cells through the restriction point
  (R) into the DNA synthesis S phase. During G1, the tumor suppressor Rb binds and
  inhibits transcription factor E2F. Phosphorylation of Rb by CDKs in late G1 induces
  dissociation of Rb and permits E2F-mediated transcription of S phase-promoting genes.
  Responding to upstream signals, INK4 and Kip/Cip family inhibitors control CDK activity
  and prevent entry into S phase. DNA damage activates response pathways through ATM/ATR
  and Chk1/2 kinases to block CDK activity, leading to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair
  or cell death. The G2/M checkpoint prevents cells containing damaged DNA from entering
  mitosis. Activated CDK1/Cdc2 bound to cyclin B promotes entry into M phase. Wee1
  and Myt1 kinases and Cdc25 phosphatase competitively regulate CDK1 activity; Wee1
  and Myt1 inhibit CDK1 and prevent entry into M phase, while Cdc25 removes inhibitory
  phosphates. DNA damage activates multiple kinases that phosphorylate kinases Chk1/2
  and tumor suppressor protein p53. Chk1/2 kinases stimulate Wee1 activity and inhibit
  Cdc25C, preventing entry into M phase. Phosphorylation of p53 promotes dissociation
  between p53 and MDM2 and allows binding of the transcription factor to DNA. In addition,
  the spindle checkpoint ensures proper chromatid attachment prior to progression
  from metaphase to anaphase. The SCF and APC/C protein complexes play prominent roles,
  with APC-Cdc20 initiating the entry into anaphase by promoting ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation of multiple substrates, including cyclin B and the regulatory protein
  securing. Targets of hsa-miR-181a-5p are marked with a red star.'
