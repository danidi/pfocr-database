caption: APP and BACE-1 interact in acidic endosomes after internalization. Further
  sorting/retrieval pathways help degrade and/or recycle these proteins, limiting
  excessive APP β-cleavage in acidic endosomes. The retromer complex binds to the
  adaptor protein sorLA, which in turn binds to APP and mediates its retrieval to
  the trans-Golgi network. APP recycling back to plasma membrane is mediated by sorLA,
  SNX27, SNX15 and Par3/Numb. BECN1, CD2AP and PI3P/VPS34 modulate APP turnover and
  stability by sorting it into lysosomes. The retrieval pathway of BACE-1 is mediated
  by the retromer complex and sorting proteins GGA and PACS1. The recycling pathway
  of BACE-1 may be regulated by Rab11, and sorting of BACE-1 to lysosome for degradation
  is thought to be mediated by BIN1, Snapin, GGA3 and SNX4.
