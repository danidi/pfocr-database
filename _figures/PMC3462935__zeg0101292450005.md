caption: The schematic diagram depicting the potential interactions between EGF, S100A11,
  and Ca2+signaling pathway in human endometrial cell. EGF, acting through their receptor,
  up-regulates S100A11, which exerts its roles in calcium uptake and release from
  calcium store in ER. This cross talk influences some of the calcium-trigged signaling
  pathways to promote the expression of genes including EGFR, IL-15, and LIF, etc.,
  and further affect immunotolerance, cell proliferation, and endometrial receptivity
  to implantation, ensuring the successful execution of the implantation process.
  CaM, Calmodulin; IP3R, inositol trisphosphate receptor; RyR, ryanodine receptor;
  SERCA, sarco/endoplamic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase.
