caption: 'The exogenous κ-elastin enhances the mRNA expression of eNOS in the ECs
  [], and tropoelastin improves the protein expression for NO production, which is
  inhibited by L-NAME []. The TSP-1-mediated inhibition of NO synthesis and downstream
  effects is through two main mechanisms: (1) The high concentrations of TSP-1 and
  its peptide mimetics, ABT-510, via interaction with CD-36, inhibit the translocation
  of myristate to the cytoplasm, thus inhibit the membrane translocation of the Src
  responsible the activation of eNOS and generation of NO [,]. (2) At low concentration,
  and via its binding to CD47, TSP-1 inhibits the NO-mediated activation of sGC, cGMP
  generation from Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and activation of cGMP-dependent protein
  kinase (cGK-1) responsible for the enhanced cell proliferation, angiogenesis and
  metastasis [,]. The exogenous NO at a concentration of 1 µM only can decrease the
  protein expression of TSP-1 in the ECs, while activates sGC []. The scheme was created
  in Biorender.com.'
