caption: 'Cross-reactive, prM and fusion-loop Abs facilitate immature DENV entry through
  Fcγ receptor and mediate enhanced DENV replication by following the intrinsic ADE
  pathway. (Left half) DENV attaches to a host cell surface and is endocytosed followed
  by virus-endosomal membrane fusion leading to the release of viral genome. Post-release,
  viral RNA is translated and the viral genome is replicated. Virus assembly occurs
  on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, and immature viral particles mature
  into their infectious form in the Golgi network. These mature viruses are then released
  from the cell and ready to infect other cells. (Right half) Cross-reactive Abs bind
  with immature non-infectious particles turning into infectious virus-Ab immune complexes
  (V-Ab IC) which then bind with the Fc receptor bearing cells. This assembly down-regulates
  the DENV-specific pattern recognition receptor (PRRs) signaling, inhibits type I
  interferon (IFNα/β) release and activates production of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) which
  causes up-regulation of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) family. Henceforth,
  controlled mature DENV production is lost, resulting into manifold increase in wide-range
  of immature viruses which leads to the extrinsic-ADE pathway by infecting other
  cells via binding with cross-reactive Abs (Figure is adapted from Halstead et al.,  under
