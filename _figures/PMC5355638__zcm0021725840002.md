caption: Mechanisms of RSV T-cell interference as a potential immune evasion strategy.
  RSV infection is associated with an initial systemic T-cell lymphopenia that is
  quantitatively associated with disease severity. RSV may interfere with T-cell responses
  by inducing apoptosis (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) (A), inducing increased expression
  of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein, which is inhibitory to activated
  T cells (CD8+ T cells) (B), and promoting activation of the mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thus preventing memory CD8+ T-cell formation (C).
