caption: Schematic diagram outlining the steps in ENaC recycling and delivery to the
  apical membrane. Following synthesis and assembly (yellow Golgi apparatus), channels
  are transported to the apical surface (yellow vesicle) and can be localized in lipid
  raft membrane domains (Rafts). It is also possible that ENaC enters the regulated
  recycling pathway directly (? and arrow), but no support for this idea has yet emerged.
  Those channels retrieved from the apical surface (see ) and delivered to the ARE
  are trafficked back to the apical membrane through the involvement of Rab proteins
  (most likely Rab11, 27). Delivery of ENaC to the apical surface is regulated by
  RhoA and sorting nexin 3 (SN3) and vesicle fusion is mediated by SNARE proteins
  (SNAREs). Details of the mechanisms of ENaC delivery are provided in the text.
