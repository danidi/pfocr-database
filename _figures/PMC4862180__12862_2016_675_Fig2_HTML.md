caption: 'Core anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway adapted from Rausher []. Enzymes include:
  CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; DFR,
  dihydroflavonol reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; and UF3GT, UDP-glucose flavonoid
  3-O-glucosyl transferase. Several of the steps required for anthocyanin pigment
  production are shared with other uncolored flavonoid compounds (e.g., flavones and
  flavonols). The enzymes examined in this study are shaded in gray'
